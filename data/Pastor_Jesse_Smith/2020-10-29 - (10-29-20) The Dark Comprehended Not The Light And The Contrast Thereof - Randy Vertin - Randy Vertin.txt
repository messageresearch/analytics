trying to fight everybody and we're grateful for that because we know where our victory lies amen and uh maybe we'll just sing a song here before we get into the word do you guys have uh you might have the song in there the the wonder what a wonderful name it is they have the words [Music] i really like that song you know that's that's what we've come here to do is worship the lord jesus we're not here to lift up any any other thing any organization or any group of people or anything like that but we're here to lift up the name of the lord jesus christ you were the word in the beginning one with god the lord most high you're hidden glory in creation now revealing you our christ what a wonderful name it is what a wonderful name it is the name of jesus christ our king what a wonderful name it is nothing compares to this what a wonderful name it is the name of jesus you didn't want heaven without us so jesus you brought heaven down my sin was greater love was greater what could separate us now what a beautiful name it is what a beautiful name it is the name of jesus christ my king what a beautiful name it is nothing compared to this what a beautiful name it is the name of jesus what a wonderful name it is what a wonderful name it is the name of jesus christ our king what a wonderful name it is nothing compares to this what a wonderful name it is the name of jesus [Laughter] you didn't want heaven without us so jesus you brought heaven down [Music] my sin was great your love was greater what could separate us now what a powerful name it is what a powerful name it is the name of jesus christ our king what a powerful name it is nothing can stand against what a powerful name it is the name of jesus what a wonderful name it is what a wonderful name it is the name of jesus christ our king what a wonderful name it is nothing compares to this what a wonderful name it is the name of jesus amen praise the lord amen we thank the lord for his grace and his mercy amen let's turn into the word if we can to the book of john chapter one we'll just read the first five verses there and just bring greetings there from texas and my wife lindsay and she wishes she could be here you know but uh she's taking care of the pups there at home and uh but but don't feel bad texas is honestly right now basically just as cold and it's been just as wet as it is up here so we're uh we're not only one in the spirit but we're even one in the in the weather right now so uh but you know what the the fire of the gospel keeps us going on the inside man and uh we'll just uh read here the first five verses of the book of john chapter one it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not amen and uh let's just turn over to the book of genesis as well chapter one and i'll read verse three through five actually we just started first one we'll just read one verse one through five as well here in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the night the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day amen this is far our head's a little prayer heavenly father lord jesus so jesus come lord that this evening lord to hear from you oh god just to gather together lord in one accord to to read from your word lord and to have something lord that would maybe be said that would draw your people closer to you lord jesus that would be a benefit to your bride this evening but we just pray that you would have preeminence in the service oh god may lord you just have your perfect will and way amongst your people lord may just let me get out of the way lord all the ones that would have a desire to be here lord we know there are many that would desire to be here lord but the devils put up different roadblocks and obstacles but god we know that the word of god is is sharper than the two-edged sword lord and lord we just go forward knowing oh god that wherever two or three gathered you're there in the midst and lord even as i believe our brother paul said in the scriptures though he was absent in the flesh he was present in the spirit and we lo no lord god by the oneness of the holy ghost that you put in your bridal god that that your presence is here with us lord and it's with all the saints that would desire to be here lord and you can minister to them just as powerfully right now and lord we just ask that you're perfect this evening lord may you just have something said that would be pleasing to you lord god and that would be a benefit to your people we just ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and i need to be seated just maybe you want to preach a simple little sermon this evening probably won't keep you long um and uh you know we definitely know i believe by the by the signs of the times and the things that we see that we're living in the last days you know it's so tempting i was just talking with the brother before a little bit earlier today and and um it's so tempting because the the nature of man is always trying to figure things out you know and and with all the things going on there's no doubt that even the denomination and and all the the ones out there that that believe on the lord jesus they can there's a feeling that that a believer gets you know even to know that that the time is is nigh it's even at the door and there's there's an i believe an urgency in the air really in in the in the spirit of the people that we just know that the lord is soon to come amen even if we can't necessarily put our finger on it or as much as you know trying to to figure out the exact times and everything and i was talking with the brother and saying how with all the things going on with the election and things there's all these different ones out there oh this is definitely gonna happen and this is definitely going to happen and it's it's so easy to get caught into that because the spirit of the age is crying out for the lord you know we the there's their their people are are in gross darkness and they know that something's wrong but that so many don't know where to turn and and you know it really is it seems like a really an embodiment of the scripture where it says the blind would lead the blind and they'd both fall into the ditch and everyone's trying to find something because we know we had a word come in our day that showed us the truth of the gospel and the and the fact that the word of god is true amen that it's not just something that we had to guess at and and wonder about but the word of god is yea and amen and his promises are true and we don't have to question the word of god we just have to believe it amen you know but and we know in this hour that we're living in that the devil is coming with such a deception amongst the people always throwing distractions and different things but we want to speak about in this hour is if we just give a title to the sermon of contrasting attributes you know because god works by a law of contrast and we see that right even here in the beginning of the book of genesis you know the the spirit of the age is is that spirit of filial love it's a real strong spirit of what they of fleshly what the the devil tries to define his love one of the biggest things that the the devil's trying to do in this day is he redefines things all the time the things that used to be one way they just aren't the they aren't that way anymore you know i and and forgive me if it sounds really crude to say it this way but it used to be that the word gay meant a happiness or a joy you know it would be it would be oh well i feel i feel this way and and now we've redefined it to go in this other direction and and so many things that you could find of even the very definition of things is is trying is trying to take itself and the devil has tried to use intellect and intellectual uh reasonings and things to try to bring the people to a place where they've completely reasoned god out of their lives you know the scripture says that it would come to a place that they would not even like to retain god in their knowledge they've completely lost any any any semblance of of reverential fear for god let alone knowing what we know if if it's not just it's not just god is in just some great spirit that the the the world would try to find oh some great power like the the hindus would worship or or or some some a native american would just worship some great spirit but we know that god gave himself a name and that was the name lord jesus christ so we we understand that but meanwhile the devil is coming with intellectualism and and blinded the people so much with science and reasonings and all the things that we see in the world and granted there are many wonderful things i'm grateful for the fact that just earlier today i could be all the way in texas and just a few hours later here i find myself back in ohio you know and we're grateful for those things but we understand it's a it's a tree of knowledge of good and evil and we need to be so careful even though you know we have to partake of so many of the things just to survive you know we drive our cars and those things are wonderful we have our computers and we're grateful for those things but but the devil has twisted those things to to be a uh uh to not be a benefit for the people of god in so many ways we we see how how the computers and the cell phones and all the televisions and all these things that maybe in some aspect could be used for such a great a great ministry for the things of god the devil always just twists it down into the pits of hell but we understand that it has to be that way because there has to be god works by a law of contrast and we understand even right in the beginning in the book of genesis you know the world is operating in this this false idea of love of oh love just it brings everybody together no matter what and it doesn't matter what you believe and it doesn't matter you know whether or not we can you know whether or not we agree on anything you know we just need to all get along and and just tolerate one another and just let everybody do what they want to do and really as the scripture says they have the attitude of eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die they just well let's just do whatever we want whatever would feel good whatever makes you feel better whatever whatever just makes you feel like well this is just the way it's going to be so let's just you know i can get along with everybody it's not hurting me it doesn't really matter it doesn't mean it's wrong but but that is just an absolute perversion of real love because real agape godly love can only recognize the word of god real love in the heart of a believer can only recognize the word of god to be true and anything against that oh sure you know we're not going out and always pointing fingers in people's faces per se but just you don't realize that even your very life that you live the spirit that dwells within the believer is a rebuke to the world it's an absolute rebuke to the world so there's no wonder why the world would hate the believer even without a cause there's nothing that may have even been done but just like our lord jesus said he said if the world hated you it hated me first and the only reason the world can really hate you isn't because of you it's because of jesus christ who the world hated he dwells in you and so it's no wonder you know and it's it's something that has gotten into the youth of the day within the within the ranks of the believers because there's such a desire and such a spirit of wanting to belong to the people everybody wants to belong everybody wants to be loved and and appreciated by everybody but but we understand that if you're going to walk the road of a real christian it's going to be a harder road it's gonna be a road that's not filled with all the praise and adoration that the world tries to heap on their so-called celebrities and their so-called their idols that they've that they freely call them but it's gonna be a harder road where the real comfort because when it comes down to it the only comfort the believer can really have is in jesus christ amen the only comfort the believer can really have is in the holy ghost there is absolutely nothing no matter how good it might seem no matter how good it looks or how good it feels for a season that can comfort or bring you into a real fellowship other than the holy ghost amen other than a real fellowship with god himself through underneath the shed blood in the name of the lord jesus christ but the whole world has gotten into this idea of well you just have to you just have to accept everything you just have to take it because that's love that's what love is but see god in this hour just like he did in the beginning is trying to draw a contrast there is a law of contrast that has to exist and as you can see it seems you know sir i've been serving the lord by the grace of god for going on i'd say maybe 20 years or so since i first gave my heart to the lord and and then you know come to the knowledge of this word and what we have now in this hour uh for about 18 years or so now by god's grace and and it's just something to see because just when we don't think as believers that it can get any worse it just the world continues to find new ways to get worse but there's a purpose behind it because in order to express god's perfection there has to be a backdrop to it there it's just like a painting if you have a painting and you have a canvas you say this this monitor here is a canvas if i was gonna paint on it and i wanted to paint a bright background and a sunny sunny nice day well then i would have to start out with something along those lines you have to have a contrast to it if you want to have a light you there has to be darkness otherwise light can't be perfectly expressed we even find that in the book of genesis because god said let there be light and there was light and meanwhile the world is saying just as we know the scripture declares that there's a binding of the tares and a binding of the wheat going on there is a binding going on and there's a natural binding that they're trying to do a forced union where let's just accept everything let's just accept it we can break down the walls of whether or not we believe that god is one god we can break down the walls of whether we believe or not in the true baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ or we can break down the walls of holiness and living right before god in actually taking the word for what it says instead of what we want it to say but the world wants to break down all those barriers think oh well if god god is love god is love god is love but he's not the kind of love that the world is pushing upon the people he's not just a pushover grandfather that will just accept any old thing just for the sake of let's get along you know the scripture says that we need as much we live peaceably with all men as much lies within you and it's not that we're going out there just trying to pick fights believe you me if this hour the fight is coming to the believer you won't need to pick any fights brothers and sisters because the fight is coming to the believer why because your very life is an expression of everything contrary to what the devil is doing in the world right now you don't realize it but just by being here in this place or if you're listening on on on the internet or whatever listening because you're not able to be here or whatever it might be just you trying to enter into the channel of the word and receive something from god in this hour is setting you you are actively taking sides right now whether you know it or not just by the attitude you take towards the word of god you're choosing a side right now of where you're gonna stand are you gonna stand with the world that just says let's just do whatever it does well god is love god god accepts everybody god does this god does he does accept everybody on his conditions he accepts everyone on his conditions what are the conditions it's the word of god repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but everlasting life what is that but what proves he said if you love me there's that word again see the the world loves to throw that word around love love love oh we gotta you gotta have love how could jesus jesus wouldn't have done this jesus wouldn't say homosexuality is wrong jesus wouldn't condemn all the insanity going on now well he may not be out there marching in a political realm because i the the political realm is the devil's realm to do with what he wants but that's that's his thing to do now the lord is ultimately in control you know we're in that season now i'm sure everybody's thinking about it it's on everybody's mind with the election and all these different things going on we understand that that realm is satan's realm god let him have it he said he gave it to him for the season that he gets it but in the end it doesn't matter anyway because the scripture already gave us a backstop that god sets up kings and he takes them down so no matter what the devil's devices are it's all in the control of our lord jesus christ it's all under the control of god it doesn't matter what it looks like on the outside oh well we you know we can do what we have to do whether it be you know trying to live our lives the right way and all these things and you know maybe not partaking in those things you know everybody want the oh you got to get on this cause you got to get on this cause and this and that this and that the only cause i want to be a part of is the cause of the world amen praise the lord but we understand that there has got to be a contrast in this hour and and the people of god the bride of jesus christ has been called to be a contrasting element to the darkness of this world even now the word the scripture says that it would be a time that wouldn't be called day or night but in the evening time it shall be light you are right now that light in the evening time it is such a deceptive time it's that that gloomy that that they say the most deceptive time of the day is what they call twilight it's that evening time it's right before the sun goes down and and dusk and and twilight and all those things and then right before the sun comes up why because everything looks like it's kind of blending together the shadows get real long the darkness is pressing itself together it doesn't matter how much the darkness presses itself together brothers and sisters it can't stop the light it can't stop what god has placed inside of you it cannot do it but the question is it's it's whether or not we're gonna let that light shine even that just being here now just siding yourself with this word in your heart lord i believe your word i take every word of it to be true and i'm going to do everything in my power by your grace to live according to this word amen sets you apart from everybody else in the world that just says well that was just no i believe you know that if we believe on the lord jesus we'll be saved but i don't know i don't know about that holiness stuff you know i don't know i don't know about the holy ghost i don't know about why because there's so there's got to be a contrast brothers and sisters there is darkness upon the land and gross darkness on the people people you can see it in the way they act you can see it in the way they live their lives that they are groping looking for something that's why everybody gets attached to these causes everybody wants to jump on the bandwagon why because they're they're wanting something to believe in they are desiring to believe in something because a man and i say this bro man or woman you know brother or sister a man or woman without a purpose a man without a vision to see where they're going they have no drive don't become lackadaisical they don't they're confused why because there's got to be something that you're pushing towards there's got to be something that you're driving towards there's got to be movement somewhere i remember a long time ago i heard this and it's been a long time so maybe they've changed it i don't know science seems to change every two seconds for all i know but but i remember hearing this because you know scientists are always trying to figure things out right that's just what they do and they want to figure out what is life you know they can see it you know as far as the flesh goes like you're alive brother amen and and brother bang i'm alive right now and you know we're here and we'll do it we're doing that they can look at a dog and they can look at a a little plant and they can look at the cells and they say there's they can even look at the little bacteria and they'd say this thing it's alive there's a life to it and they define it different ways you know they'd say i think they say like viruses aren't technically alive because of this or that but but there's but there but we understand by the word in this hour by the message that there is a life behind that virus there's a life there so but but the one thing they said i remember hearing this or reading this a long time ago they said the one thing that that they find in common about all life no matter what it looks like it's movement it's it is a movement it is action and something going on he said brother well that doesn't make any sense i could go down in the bottom of the ocean and find a sea sponge and he doesn't move at all but if you were to take a piece of that sea sponge and zoom in all the way out into the cells you'd see all those little cells moving all the time you'd see all those little pieces of the the mitochondria and the little different things going on the cells in the uh i don't know if sea sponge has blood but whatever the equivalent of blood is for a sea sponge is moving around moving the nutrients here and there and filtering out the things from the ocean moving it here and there you know if brother brother amen sleeping in the bed and he maybe he's a i don't know what kind of asleep you are brother but maybe you're maybe you're a really good sleeper like brother simon who could just sleep like nobody's business where you almost think man bro is he even still alive maybe they're sleeping so good you don't know you got to put the mirror up to see if they're still breathing but even then take someone in a coma and they say oh they're brain dead or something you know but then they could go to the cellular level they can look and they see while they're still breathing their the cells are still moving there is life somewhere and so it was i remember hearing that it really struck me movement and then it started me thinking and i thought well that's the problem with people that become stagnant is when you stop moving when you stop pressing forward when you stop when you lose and i remember i preached this when i was here last time so forgive me if i'm kind of overlapping some things and i would admit to start on on stepping into the vision i believe it was and but it kind of goes along this line that if you lose the vision if you lose the purpose if you lose what the lord is trying to move you towards if you lose that you become stagnant you become you become you just become it just becomes filthy and the problem is is that once you once a body of water or once a being once something becomes stagnant what happens rap starts to set in parasites start to set in these problems start to happen i mean branham calls them all the wiggle tails and all the little the tadpoles and things that come along with it they start to set in why because there's no movement there's no direction there's no purpose as a believer we ought to have a purpose to our lives there needs to be that vision that god's given and there is a vision in this age it's to be a contrast with what the rest of the world is showing right now and you don't see the devil likes to try to beat the believer down because oh we live humble lives you know we have a small little church here you know there's a small little church here there's small little churches everywhere you know maybe just a few here and maybe some are a little bit bigger some a little bit smaller and the devil oh you're just insignificant you're this and you're that it has nothing to do with you brothers it's not about the flesh it's not about according to the natural yeah it's just like the one time when when gideon had all these soldiers and god said there's too many we got to whittle him down so we whittled him down and then he said the lord said no that's still too many we got to whittle him down and he winded him down and he said look the reason i'm doing this is to show you that it's not about numbers it's not about like what the what the the carnal mind can see it's about whether or not god is in the camp because i tell you what brothers and sisters as long as god is in the camp you might as well count that one as one billion because it doesn't matter because there be more for us than they could even see there'd be more for us than against us even now encompassed by a great crowd of witnesses yeah we may not have prophetic eyes to see into the spiritual realm but i know that the word says wherever two or three are gathered he'd be there in the midst that the angels of the lord encamp about them that fear him i like that in camping why they're pitching their tent around you there's a there's a holy perimeter that's a military thing that putting a perimeter around your brothers and sisters god's done it in this age and the devil tries to make you feel small and insignificant and you don't realize that you are the greatest light that the world is ever going to see right now and that's not here to just pump you up according to the flesh that's not the point because i think we've gotten too much of that but but we have to understand who we are and realize that there is something in you that you have to offer there is something in you as a believer as a holy ghost-filled christian who believes the revealed word of god for the hour that there is a life in you that there is a truth that that is in you that you have to offer that the world can't stand but every once in a while brothers and sisters you're going to come across one that's who they're going to see it oh it's a glorious thing it's becoming more few and far between it seems all the time but it's a glorious moment why because it proves that there's something deep down inside that that you can't see it with your natural eyes someone would have looked at me you know 20 years ago even probably 10 years ago even when i was going through a lot of trials i thought there was nothing to it doesn't really matter that's okay there was something on the inside that that man can't see and there's something in you that you have to offer god has made us a contrasting element in this age the world is just groped and they're just covered in darkness and and granted there are many out there that are that are christians that believe as much as as they've had revealed to them and as much as they can see but but brothers and sisters there's there's not much that that you know how rare it is in it again this is not to puff up according to the flesh i've talked about it here i've talked about it a lot of places i don't like the bride pride thing we're all we're just the pride of jesus christ we're this we're that no we're only anything because god had mercy upon us we're only anything because his grace and his mercy if it was up to me if it was up to my own i would have put myself out a long time ago but by the grace of god like paul said by the grace of god i am what i am i can't help but be what i am amen and thank the lord that he made me made us that way but i i want to say that if we would realize how rare it is to to say that you believe every word of this bible and actually mean it because there are so many you that would claim to believe the scripture but they'll come to a place where i just can't take that well i just don't think i can go that far how rare it is to that the lord has opened our eyes to see the truth of the scripture to know that when god says something he says what he means he means what he says his promises are true his word is yea and amen amen and we've had it revealed to us i mean it's such a humbling thing it ought to humble us just down below the floor because who are we to receive that but there's but there is there is a contrast to be had in this age because see the lord he puts the back it's just like an artist like we were talking about the painting or something along that line an artist when he's getting the situation ready to to show to show something that there needs to be a background to the to the art piece there needs to be a background to the painting there needs to be a background to the photograph or or the picture or whatever it might be to the sculpture whatever they're doing and what if if they do it properly there needs to be a contrast between the two because if you have you know those one of those white marble sculptures and you place it in front of a white marble wall then they're just going to get lost it won't be able to really you'll never really see what's laying there but if you take that and put it out of contrast all of a sudden it becomes revealed what was there and you can start to see the form of it you start to understand the purpose of it and that's what it is for the believers in this day kind of going back i know we kind of went off on attention we just kind of i forget you'll forgive me i know i i do that a lot i just try to go where the lord leads and but the thought is the world and i i we go so much of this because we understand that divine love is the only thing that's going to be there is real defined love not the the forgive me for saying this way i know it's not the garbage that the world spews that love is oh love is this love is that oh love just means you just gotta roll with whatever the devil wants you to do basically is what they're saying but real love if real divine love is the only thing that's going to be there and because the world is saying well love love love we gotta we just got to let everybody in and do whatever they want but from the beginning god shows that he's a separator amen from the very beginning god shows that he's separating light from darkness he's separating goats from sheep he's separating make believers from unbelievers and from real believers he's separating them sure we have our moments where yeah we understand three types of believers and all these different things but even now they're being separated why because as we're getting closer and closer to the top of that pyramid it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller and the roads becoming narrower and narrower and narrower and the battles become harder and people fall away and they just give up and say i can't do it anymore why because there's got to be a contrast there's got to be a contrast and in this day you could you could think of all the qualities about the bride versus versus the world you look at holiness the world wants to just do do whatever you want to do it doesn't matter going that they go into the churches and they play rock and roll now i mean it's just flat out they want to say that they they're believers and they play demonic rock and roll music in the churches the the the the people dress any kind of way the the that they're 90 naked you know and if they if they do have any clothes on it looks like a second skin painted on them you know it's absolute insanity but it shows that there there's a contrast there first holiness verse really living according to the word of god when it comes to those things and dressing in in a holy way that's that would be acceptable and meek before the lord not going and swatting yourself because his flesh is nothing anyway everybody wants to flaunt their flesh but it's nothing but a dead man anyhow the flesh is already condemned so much so that it's got to be totally changed you ain't taking it with you if it doesn't go in the ground it'll it'll change it before rapture and so no matter what you do it ain't going with you anyhow but they want to show it off however they want they want to do that they you know they they they'll just let you live any kind of way but see god isn't just about you know just letting these things go it's not about just there's got to be a standard and whether you know it or not your life is a living standard that the world sees and is preaching and crying out some some may understand it some don't many you know the scripture said they hate you without a cause they don't even know why but there's a spirit of the age that would do that they don't have they basically accept except they'd be underneath the blood and the holy ghost they won't even have a choice because the scripture said it would be so deceptive it would deceive the elect if it were possible if that be the case so we see the the the contrast there the holiness of the bride of jesus christ verses and but then even then many people in the world see hypocrisy and so even according to natural numbers many of them lose people and all they want is more members and more members so what do they do they start lowering standards they start not preaching the real gospel at all none of the gospel at all and now it just becomes this greater and greater thing so what happens is as the bride's getting smaller and smaller and smaller as we're getting closer and closer and closer the other half just enlarging enlarging enlarging so we see the contrast of that tiny little group that would stick with the word of god and then this the whole entire world that couldn't care less about the word of god and if you try to say anything like that you're just a hate monger you're just a person you you don't have any real love because jesus wouldn't be like that oh my if jesus were here they would have well that we already know what happened because we had a prophet preach an indictment crucifying the lord afresh that was only in the spiritual if he was hearing the natural now they would have done it a long time ago so we see there's there's got to be a contrast god is a separator he is not the lord is not just oh you know i think if i remember you know it wasn't oh the lord didn't say oh well i'll just go down and i'll come in the form of jesus christ and die and i just hope that someone feels bad for me and and maybe they'll just believe on me or or something like that no the lord didn't leave anything the chance he knew them that are his he knows that they are his he came to redeem those that are his yes he gave the opportunity to all he knew all wouldn't receive it but here you are trying your best in the devil see the devil doesn't like that because you know the desire of the believer is to be perfect our desire is to always walk perfect every time and the devil knows that so he always uses that against you you know he's uh it's always funny i i always think about i think about how the devil he loves to take both sides of the argument he's always ready to take both sides because he's the accuser of the brethren so he takes the one size and says oh you can't do it you can't do it you're not a real believer you're not a real believer y'all you know you know god can't do it anyway even if you didn't believe yeah you may believe it but it's not gonna happen and then as soon as something happens he's right there to say oh it didn't really happen anyway you didn't see it that way oh you know you know you just made this mistake anyway he's always on both sides of the argument and it's amazing because we fall victim to it all the time because our eyes get we lose our focus we lose our vision of where we're going you know but god has always been about contrast and there are attributes there are there is a there is a life the life of jesus christ the holy ghost that is looking to express itself in you the believer in order to contrast the world that we live in and if i tell you what brothers and sisters it's getting darker and darker it's getting harder and harder the battles are getting greater and greater the the the spiritual pressure is building and building and building why because there's there the more that they press the more that that darkness presses itself together they're all doing one thing and that's even though they don't know it is they're trying to hinder the work of god they're trying to hinder the rapture they're trying to hinder the coming of the lord they can't do it we know they can't do it but but the devil is only here just to try to trip you up just to try to make it take a little bit longer than than you thought you needed to he's here just to try to follow things up a little bit and get you off course just enough so you miss the mark remember just just a little bit left or right before you shoot the gun will put your feet off the target down the line you know we got to be so careful because if there's any thing we got to be so careful is is just getting if i say lackadaisical because as we've talked about that life has got to be moving that that if we're talk we're talking out of your belly shuffle rivers of living water it's not just a pool it's not a stagnant pool but they're rivers of living water a river a river ain't gonna find that stagnation in a river because the river's moving that river's flowing that river that river's always what is a moving river you put a little log or a stick on a moving river well it's always having a revival it's always pushing out the garbage it's always pushing out the trash towards that ocean it's trying to get rid of it and that's what we need in our lives is to understand that it's got to be always oppressing it's always oppressing paul said he said it's not i don't speak as though i've already attained the goal i don't i don't acted so i've already arrived he said but i forget those those things that are behind and i press forward i press towards the mark of the high calling in christ jesus and that pressing isn't just well i press without have arrived now we because now understand me there there is even a very distinction to be made here as well because there there there is such a thing as resting in the holy ghost but when it comes to to our our getting closer unto the lord and and pressing towards this rapture that it's still a continual pressing because until we are out of here until the lord calls us away in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we are going to be fighting and if we're fighting a battle then we got to be pressing so and many times the devil see the devil gets us because we've received the holy ghost we know who we are we accept the word of god we know that his word is true we don't question it we're doing everything we can and then the devil comes along and says well then if if what is this rest you speak of when every day you get up you're battling because it's not a rest in the sense that you don't do anything see when we think of rest as carnal we just think we just lay around and we just sit on the sit on the couch and eat some popcorn or eat an apple or something i guess those are two things i like to eat so you know you know when we think of rest we're thinking of a natural thing but when we're talking about resting it's that we've scripture says we've rested from our own works it's no longer our own works but we do a desire to do the works of god we desire to live a christian life before god and if you're gonna do that you're going to fight if you're going to live a life for jesus christ you are going to have to press every day you're going to fight every day because you've never even got see it's a paradox isn't it it's a paradox because the devil's on one side saying don't press don't press you know don't don't try to press to the holy ghost don't try to press into this don't and then you make it and then the devil said the devil says well well why are you fighting now and all he's there is he's there accusing you accusing you accusing you accusing you trying to hold you back why because many times we just think oh we've arrived and we have in the sense that once the sealed once the sealed vessel is there the work is finished but you see there there's still work to be done there's still life to be lived there's still a contrast to be made with the world and if we're going to fight you're going to press you're going to battle it's going to be an everyday affair because you didn't even join the fight until you receive the holy ghost you didn't even join the fight until you believed this word amen no doubt there's a lot of the israelites who thought when they crossed jordan well we got it this is it we made it the land flowing with milk and honey but now it was time to pull the sword and go to work that was the time to really pull the sword and go to work and now is the time brothers and sisters that it's time to pull that spiritual sword and go to work amen we got to pray like we've never prayed before he said brother it just sounds like works that you're it's not about words you see we can rest in the sense that i don't count on my prayer to save me the lord already did that but because he saved me i must fight if i must win increase my courage lord if if there's and desiring you for this rapture that it's time that we showed some fight that it's time to buckle down and say devil i see the darkness i see these things that are going on in the world but i'm gonna pull the sword and i'm gonna start chopping in all the things that i see in my life i'm going to start chopping with the worm all the things i see and maybe my brothers or my sister's life that they may be struggling with i'm going to go to prayer and i'm going to start chopping for them too and i'm gonna start chopping for my family now i'm gonna start fighting for my brothers and sisters and i'm gonna start fighting for for all those that we don't even know may be out there right now so we may not pray for the world in the sense oh lord just let the world be the way the way because we know it's not going to be that way until jesus comes but say lord help me to find those that you have predestinated help me to save it as many as i can you know you know and many times we don't even know you know when someone comes in your life and and does something kind for you or you know not a not a glass of water given that his name will be forgotten we don't even know what the lord's doing but the lord's working and the devil tries to make you think just because these battles are going on and and different ones in the church get sick and oh there's necessarily got to be something wrong that's not the case there's got to be battles brothers and sisters there's got to be battles because if you're going to be an overcomer then we've got to have obstacles to overcome there's another contrast if you're going to be in how can you how can you find the solution to a math problem except there be a problem to solve how can you overcome an enemy except there be an enemy to fight how can you win a victory except there are there has to be a battle that lies before you and the battle that lies before the pride of jesus christ is great and even though we have to press we've got to press we've got to press like paul said i press that's not that's not a one-time pressing that's not just just pressed for a short period but it's the continual pushing it's a continual pushing it's a continual pushing it's a continuous marching forward but the rest we can have is in the fact that we know the battle's already won amen but we merely march forward to bring to pass what he's already spoken of us you are a living embodiment of the word coming to pass in this day you are a living embodiment of the word of god coming to pass in this day can i say it this way you the bride of jesus christ are literally prophecy being fulfilled your life is prophecy being fulfilled when you walk forward in the name of jesus christ and stand with this word and don't give in to the wiles of the devil don't compromise on it but you stand there it may not look like anything from the outside but shadrach meshach and abednego daniel with the lion's den they didn't look like anything from the outside at the time but when the time came it was like contrast again wasn't it it was an entire kingdom against three hebrew boys it was an entire kingdom against one man who refused to give into the king's commandment that's what we're coming to right now i'm not trying don't want to get political in that sense but we understand that there are a lot of opposing viewpoints that are at play when it comes to freedom to worship god we understand that i'm not even going to go deep into it but we understand it i don't even have to say it we know and believe you me if it's if it's this time or if it's the next time or if it's the time after that i don't know what i do know is that it's coming to that place again where you better believe that they're going to be looking for people like us who refuse to compromise on the word that contrast is coming that contrast is already here spiritually and it's going to manifest in the natural i don't know how exactly i don't know what form it's going to take i wouldn't claim to know all these things it's part of the faith that we walk in it's to know that to know that we already have the victory and just like the three hebrew boys could say whether or not he'll deliver us deliver us in this fashion i don't know but what i do know is that i will not bow to anything other than the lord jesus christ and his word and it's going to be a contrast you realize when you when you sisters if you if you have jobs or whatever you go to work or even you just go to the store you are a contrast to the rest of the world and the women you are you are a rebuke to the women walking around where nothing you don't even maybe even realize it because because to you this is life this is who you are you're living it you don't feel uncomfortable living in holiness because that's part of you but you don't even know that your life is a contrast everywhere you go and brothers it may not be like that so much on the outside but spiritually speaking it's a contrast when you don't give in and go out with them and you tell the people that oh did you see this thing that happened on tv and you tell them no i i don't own a tv i was just actually i was just telling a guy the other day he was mentioning something about some tv show i said i don't know i said i'll be honest i haven't owned a tv in 20 years and he said what he about broke his neck turned his head so fast but that's just a simple thing but even the way you talk the the way the way you the way you speak the atmosphere that you have is is so different from the world whether or not they can put their finger on it whether or not they're consciously aware of it you are a contrast to everything about their life because it can't because you don't even know that the light the spiritual light that is shining off of your life is so much greater than even what you can see or hear that that you can't even imagine it's the grace of god that we stand so many times we can take if we're not careful we always take it for granted that we can actually believe this when the rest of the world is is constantly spiraling downward to insanity the scripture declared what it would be it said they would they would believe things that were that weren't even convenient things that didn't even make logical sense the bible even says that there'd be accusations of science that were falsely so-called they're calling it science it's not even science you know real real science will back up the word because any real real thinking man can only come to one conclusion and that's that god's word is true amen amen we'll just maybe just wind it down you know we've these contrasts that were coming you know i've talked a lot we spoke a lot this evening on the contrast with the world i forgive me if it seems kind of broken or something i'm not a very eloquent speaker so you forgive me i just try to speak whatever the lord puts on my heart and and even then many times i feel like it doesn't come out the way you desire to come out but i really just want to encourage you you know as we're just kind of starting here in these few days lord willing will have these four days of little meetings and things and and i just wanted to maybe the lord put on my heart to say to bring us into a place where we can really have faith for what we're standing for and who we are and have courage in the fact that the things that are going on the battles that you're fighting the because we're all fighting battles every one of us the the few of us that are here now you know all of all of the ones that are maybe watching on a live stream you know are either battling if we're not battling physically we're all battling spiritually because every day is that battle where that old man's trying to raise up and you got to put him down he raises up you got to put him down you got to you got to strike him down and behead him with the word of god every day you've got to because he's there to raise up every day that's the battle we're all we're all fighting that battle but we have to understand see the the age [Music] there's a purpose behind it though the the darker the age the age that we're living in as dark as it is it's here for a purpose you know the scripture says in in corinth and first i believe it's first corinthians that paul was talking about he says there there are he says i've heard that there are heresies among you he says and he said there must be heresies among you he said and he said he says so that those that are approved can be made manifest so paul is showing us that these issues even came into the church people bringing in heresies and things that were off the word were brought specifically the lord allowed it to happen so that he could show that his word and what was true and what wasn't so is it with us the believer you the believer brothers or sisters wherever you may be the bride of this age has been brought here in this dark age to manifest contrast to the world when you see the people that you may work with speaking ill one of another you have been brought for a purpose to bring a contrast of perfect love to the situation when you see people that have no hope that that can't understand why the world is as crazy as it is they don't understand why they they feel so depressed and they they just can't get out of the hole that they're in god has put within you a life that can contrast and can show that person that there is a peace in jesus christ that there is a hope and a real faith and a real love in jesus christ you have been brought specifically to contrast that if there be sickness you've been brought god has put in you the power to be a contrast with healing power in the name of jesus christ amen if there be someone that needs saving someone that needs holy ghost in their life you've been brought as a contrast to offer let me pray for you let me show you the word how to receive it let me show you that god is still alive and well that god still fulfills his promise that god still makes himself known amongst his people when the world is is doing those things that there is god put it within you the believer within your soul with the holy ghost that's in you it exists to be a contrasting light to the darkness that the world is showing but don't expect it to go over well with everybody don't expect it to be well received because we know that the hour is late it's gleaning time narrow is the way there's going to be very few that find the door that really find the door and we understand we read and john said the light shined in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not that's why you won't be understood it gets so easy i sit so much with like young the more more of the younger people and you know i ca i can only imagine you know i graduated almost oh lord it's 2020. so i graduated 18 years ago now it was really hard to believe but 18 years ago i've been i'm 36 now i've been out of high school as long as i was in school i was 18 and 18. so you know i but it's it's hard to imagine just in those 18 short years you know i remember being in that that place and if there's any younger people i just trust you're listening because i i guess i just kind of have a burden for that a lot because i've seen it and there's such a desire to be accepted and just to be part of something be a part of the body of christ the lord jesus will give you all the comfort that that drugs would love to offer you but can't give you that alcohol would offer to you but will never be able to satisfy that that that women and or men or whatever it is would would try to fill that hole but nothing can do it jesus christ is the only only one who can only one who can and so many are looking for that acceptance so i want to be part of this group or that group if you want to be a christian you'll never be accepted by those groups and we've and i see so many people struggling with that that battle because they want to be accepted by the world but they have a desire to live for god and there's got to be a choice made remember god is a separator and you're going to have to separate one from the other and make your choice and decide this day who you're going to serve and you've got to understand that you will not be accepted because the light shines in that darkness and the darkness can't understand it it can't comprehend it it cannot it will not if in the garden of eden god himself could try to explain to cain how to come the proper way and he could not do it how much less for us trying to shine the light to people that don't want anything to do with god so we've got to stop trying to be accepted by that and i i'm speaking now who am i going to obey my my my my empathy and my my desire to help my brother would be very strong no doubt having a love for brother jesse wanting to help and do that but but if the lord has given me a command said no this isn't the season no i don't want you to go this time it could make you no i believe don't believe brother jesse would get necessarily in a twist about it but there's no doubt that the devil would be right there to do that if i was saying no brother i don't feel led why because you know the accuser the devil he don't like to he he's not gonna put he's not going to let that go he's going to be right there maybe your brother jesse's here oh that brother he's just trying to make excuses you know he doesn't really love you if he did he'd come out or you know this and that and the devil's going to be right there and the devil's going to be right there in my ear oh are you really sure that the lord told you that you know if you really love brother jesse you'd go help him out and and this and but we understand who what is it better to obey god or man are we going to obey our own affections and our own thoughts and our own desires or are we going to obey the word of god to the point where as as we're told by brother branham we're just just the least little bit of his desire is what we run to do that's where we're supposed to be that's where we're going god has put that contrasting life inside each and every one of you you don't even know it the devil many times blinds us to it because we stumble and we fall we have our problems we have our struggles that we have but praise the lord even though we're pressing even though every day we're fighting paradoxically we're resting at the same time because we're not i'm not even though i'm fighting every day i'm not fighting by my own strength i'm fighting with the word that he gave us with the promises that he's promised to us that we're more than overcomers that he that begun a good work in you is faithful to complete it so i know even though i'm running the race there there's there's a me over there that's already made it why because it witnesses in here that there's something for me there and so all i do is i keep pressing pressing and that's what we're here to do by the grace of god over these next few nights that the lord will allow we'll see what the lord will do but just remember just keep pressing just keep pressing if you need something from god it's already done for you but all you got to do is press into it it's a paradox it's to hold on to it but at the same time relax and know that it's already over but but god gives us the grace to do that and so many how many times can we look back at our lives and say lord i don't even know how i'm still here i was i would i felt pressed beyond measure you know i felt i felt like my spirit was just like water i just felt like i just couldn't i couldn't see i couldn't even see how there was a way to tomorrow let alone the next five minutes but we're still standing by the grace of god we're still here we're pressing into the perfection of that statue of a perfect man the work has been completed in you right now you are a greater contrast every day to this insane world you know how crazy people think you are to show up with covet going on to show up on a thursday night when it's dreary and cold and rainy but you know what we're preston so praise the lord for the press praise the lord for for that desire to even to even serve god to really have a desire to put him first hey man let's just all stand i hope that was okay we just want to maybe bring some encouragement you know this age that we're living it's so it's so full of fear and everywhere you turn you know i work for the government i'm in air traffic control i work for the government so you know everywhere it's always we have this you know since i work for the government you see all the things that they're doing oh we have to do this and you have to do this and you have to be worried about this and then every time something happens everybody gets notified about it you got to look at this and this and be very careful because we're we're going to clean this and don't touch that and you know it's just the devil just working everything up he just you know he's just building the pressure building the pressure building the pressure praise the lord we can we can let off the pressure amen we can we can rest even though we're pressing even though it's a battle we can rest in his promises see the devil and i guess this is the crux of what i wanted to say i'm really grateful that the lord brought it back to my mind see the devil gets us so fixated on us trying to win a victory just because we understand he's made us overcomers he puts these obstacles in our way so that by his grace we can overcome them and prove his word prove to the devil even prove to ourselves that god is living that he's alive that his spirit is just as strong as it has ever been but the devil so many times puts the onus on us in the flesh so you got to win this victory you got to do this victory you got to do this you have to do that while we're pressing and we're pressing we're doing the best that we can but what the lord is trying to tell us is even though we're pressing and we're looking to win a victory we're not looking at the victory we're not looking just at the victory that we're trying to win for whatever obstacle is in your way now but we can look you say satan it's not about whether i can win the victory it's about the fact that the victory was already won and i'm resting i'm not resting in my ability to overcome this is what i want to say by the grace of god i'm not resting we cannot rest in our ability to overcome but we rest in the fact that he has already overcome for us if i could say it like that that would be the crux of the whole thing i don't rest in my ability to overcome i rest in the fact that jesus christ already overcame for me he said brother that's so simple if it was if it was but i tell you what brother it is simple but it's not just because it's simple doesn't mean it's easy and i can say it that way just because it's simple doesn't mean it's easy because we all know that he said it is finished we all know that greater is he that is in us that he that is in the world but somebody that gets our eyes focused on ourselves in our current situation no i don't look at my situation because he fixed the situation not just on calvary but before the foundation of the world the works were finished but we looked at calvary because that was the fulfillment of it and so i don't rest i'm gonna say it one more time i don't rest in my ability to overcome i rest in the fact that jesus christ has already overcome for me amen so just rest in that yeah you're gonna fight yeah we'll get weary that's why the scripture we we we would be fighting weariness we have to be fighting weariness otherwise the scripture wouldn't say don't be weary in well-doing why would the scripture encourage us not to be weary if there wasn't going to be weariness trying to bring you down so don't be weary in well-doing well you've done all you can do to stand stand yeah these are simple things but this is what's going to make bring us to a rapture oh we could we could the mysteries are wonderful those things are great but when it comes down to it when the rubber meets the road as we like to say it's are you going to take god at his word or not are you gonna believe that he overcame for you already or not because that's all the hebrew boys could do that's all daniel could do daniel said i've done all i can do i did not bow to the to the to the word of the king i prayed to my god i didn't bow the knee and then he said well that's all i can do but all i can do is stand on the fact that i what i know is true the three hebrew voice said we didn't bow the knee either i don't know i can't do anything else other than stand on the fact that i know that what we believe is true and i followed the word of god to the best that we could and that's what we're looking to do by the grace of god let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father lord as we just come before you this evening we're just once again reminded oh lord that the works were finished lord before the foundation of the world lord jesus lord even though we battle and we struggle every single day we wake up and it seems like the devil is he's always faithful in that sense that he's always there to accuse us in the fight in the battle and to try to hinder but lord we know that you were already faithful lord on calvary father and we've even understood by revelation that even beyond that lord jesus that before the foundation of the world you had this already said lord that you that you gave us promises that you wouldn't give us the promises if it wasn't to fulfill them lord that we can rest upon those promises lord and even though we're battling and fighting and and the world may think we're crazy but in a paradox that at the same time even though we're battling and fighting we can rest with blessed assurance oh god knowing that you've already finished the work lord that we don't have to look at our own ability lord we don't have to look at our own perfection but we're looking on the perfection of the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world that that lord brought us into your presence lord filled us with your spirit has brought us into this word and lord is even now perfecting us and drawing us closer piece by piece by piece lord as we've just come to start these little meetings that brother jesse had in his heart to have and lord no doubt that father want to do something marvelous with your people otherwise the devil wouldn't fight the way that he does we believe that lord and we're trusting in you with that lord we just pray that you just minister to each one as they would have need oh god lord i know my abilities are nothing and lord my my own ability to speak as an orator maybe not be anything special or anything father but just talking with ones before how they said it's not it's not about the intellectual because no doubt as paul said it wasn't with wisdom of words or speech but with power and demonstration of the holy ghost father and it's you that's the great interpreter that can take mixed up words of immortal lord and can quicken it into the heart of a believer and bring it unto fruits to everlasting life into perfection father that's a paradox lord for your word said that by the foolishes of preaching you chose to save them that are lost lord so that no man could glory but we heap all the praise and glory upon you our lord jesus we just want to glorify and lift you up lord we thank you for it father we pray that you'd be with everyone that was able to press their way out this evening for those that are maybe watching over a live stream lord we even we thank you lord for lord the the good that comes out of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil lord that we would even be able to do that father that that lord as it was even the day of when the prophet was speaking and how they would do radio hookups how we could even do it now to even have the sight lord to be able to see and we're grateful for those things father we pray that it would always be used for your glory and we would just magnify you for it lord jesus we thank you we just pray that you bless each and every one and may you just guide us and direct us lord let us be that contrast lord whenever we see lord the the evil that the world is wrought whether it be a sickness lord know that lord we have healing power that you put in us lord not that it's our that is our ability father but but your life that you put in the believer is a contrast to the sickness that the world would have that the peace that you put in us as believer is a contrast to the to the torment that the world has lord that the power that you've placed in the believer by your holy ghost is a contrast to the weakness and bondage that the world is in and oh god you've chosen us to be here in this hour lord not that we would glorify ourselves but just to show to be a proof a living proof and a living word in this hour that you are alive and well and oh god that you're here to express your life to the world lord even though the numbers may be smaller and smaller as we get closer and closer to that hour when you take your bride away and the and the children of the bond women be so many more than the children of the free woman but god we're resting upon your word lord god when you said you'd never leave us nor forsake us lord we're looking upon your word as we i just take such consolation of the the three hebrew boys lord that would stand against an entire empire lord god that daniel would stand against an entire empire oh god how paul could stand against the roman empire paul and those apostles that went before oh god and you've called us to to have another book of acts written behind your people oh god if we have to stand up against an american empire oh god and a worldly empire that would seek to destroy everything that would have the knowledge of the lord jesus christ give us the strength oh god not in our own ability but in standing and knowing that when we've all we've done all that we can do lord whether you deliver us in the flesh or not whatever it is oh god we know that we can stand firm lord holding our faith to the end fast oh god knowing that the reward lord is is worth the sacrifice of god because how great was the sacrifice you gave the lord we just love you we pray oh god that you would be glorified and we just ask that you'd be with us now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen he's alive and well living in me to tell the world that he is the same he's the same yesterday today [Music] is [Applause] [Music] and we're living in me to tell them that he's [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] in our hearts [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music]

in you to show that contrast amen he's living in you to prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever [Music] you know i just give you a testimony that he's alive and well he said the works that i do shall you do also you know a few months ago we had a uh you know my little dog came down with something they called a meningitis for dogs they didn't even know they could get it didn't know what happened poor guy couldn't even barely move his neck and he wasn't eating you know we prayed over him we trusted the lord we took the vets you know we took the medicine that the vet gave us we prayed over the medicine and said lord you know help him to get better and i tell you within a couple weeks he's been better and i'll tell you what the guy's been just as energetic and happy as he's ever been you know i when i pray i said lord if you can heal a possum if you can heal a little fish and get back into life yes i said neither one of those were even pets i said the lord you know i love my little dog oakley and we prayed over him and the lord raised him up and that was for a dog and then i i need to tell you my wife had a little issue it's a physical issue and you know we prayed laid hands on her and prayed and she said from the time we prayed that prayer she was it was all gone and it just the grace of god he's alive and well he put it in you to have the attributes of himself we didn't even go you could go so deep into it you know the word of god is so expansive and perfect you know but he wanted to express these attributes we understand those things and so what did he do he put that life in you so now you can express those attributes it's not about us but it's about our desire to express our lord jesus [Music] amen would maybe have brother amen sing another couple songs and just praise the lord and we just look forward to everything that the lord's doing god bless you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and fall when the choices are where [Music] [Applause] when we spend our resources [Music] in jesus name we press on [Music] and in jesus name we press on the lord with the price to press on [Music] when the valley is deep [Music] [Music] is [Music] when the choices are [Music] [Music] our resources [Music] jesus we press on [Music] jesus press on [Music] the lord with the pride [Music] [Music] with the prize [Music] [Music] to press on [Music] but i want to go where the rivers cannot overflow me where my feet are on the rock i want to hide where the blazing fire cannot burn me in your presence in your presence that's where i'm strong in your presence oh lord my god in your presence that's where i belong seeking your face touching your grace [Music] i want to hide [Music] i want to be where the skins of darkness cannot touch me in your presence oh god cause in your prayers [Music] [Music] [Music] touching your grace in the cleft of the rise in your presence [Music] so [Music] [Applause]
