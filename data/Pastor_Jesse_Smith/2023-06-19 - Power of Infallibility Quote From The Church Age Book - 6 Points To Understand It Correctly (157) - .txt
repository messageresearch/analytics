TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to examine and understand the quotation from the church age book that says brother Branham has the power of infallibility this quote is found on page 328 in chapter 9 of the church age book this video has six points I want to make about this quotation and let's start by reading the quotation quote on the basis of human behavior alone anyone knows that where there are many people there is even divided opinion on lesser points of a major doctor in which they all hold together who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in this last age for this last age is going to go back to manifesting the pure word bride that means we will have the word once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul I will tell you who will have it it will be a prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or even more thoroughly Vindicated than was any prophet in all the ages from Enoch to this day because this man will of necessity have the Capstone prophetic Ministry and God will show him forth he won't need to speak for himself God will speak for him by the voice of the sign amen end quote Point number one is that in the context it seems the author of this statement which was brother Lee Vale was referring to brother branham's Doctrine meaning brother Brown's Doctrine was exactly the same as Saint Paul's the first sentence of this paragraph refers to Major Doctrine and then the second sentence says brother Branham had the power of infallibility note also on the previous page the author Lee Vale said quote he is not Jesus Christ he is not the Son of God end quote so the context is clear the veil is not exalting brother Branham to equality with Jesus Christ the context is brother Brown's Doctrine was infallibly the same as Saint Paul's and I agree with that because brother Vale said major Doctrine and brother Vale did not say every Doctrine because we all know brother bran was not infallible on every single doctrine that he taught but he was infallible on the major doctrines because he spoke them with thus saith the Lord and they agree 100 percent with Saint Paul's Doctrine the second point I want to make about this statement is that there's other quotes from Brother Branham where he says I'm not infallible and he said it was one of the most awfulest things a person could do was to make brother Branham infallible as my previous videos has shown if you need that quote let me know also brother Bram said he was powerless which is the opposite of the definition of the absolute because the word absolute means Unlimited in power so brother man never made himself infallible brother Branham never made himself the absolute the only way to understand this statement from the church age book about the power of infallibility that makes sense is that brother Brandon would speak with thus saith the Lord which is infallible like every other true Prophet who ever lived like Moses Jeremiah Ezekiel and Saint Paul brother Brandon's major doctrines were taught infallibly and he spoke them with us saith the Lord such as water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the godhead and the fact there's only one person in the godhead the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the third work of Grace and marriage and divorce to name a few these major doctrines all agree 100 with Saint Paul's writings in the New Testament and of course all the other New Testament writers the third point I want to make about this quote is that brother Ram's accusers such as believe the sign use this quote to make it seem brother Adam's followers make him infallible which is not true about the faithful followers of brother Ram's teachings but it is true about the headquarters of the tape church or tape worship movement located in Jeffersonville Indiana USA it's clear brother Ram's accusers cannot understand the context of this quote but the context again remember was Major Doctrine and the only way we know those major doctrines are infallible is that brother random spoke them with thus saith the Lord and they agree 100 with Saint Paul Saint John Saint Peter and the rest of the New Testament writers a fourth point is that as far as I know brother Branham never said he was more Vindicated than any other prophet in all the ages so to me this seems the veil added this thought and then this statement by Lee Vale would seem to imply that brother Vale thought brother Branham would be raptured and not die like Elijah was raptured and did not die and Enoch was raptured and did not die but we all know brother Branham died on December 24th 1965. notice in this quote by Brother Vale he said more thoroughly Vindicated than was any prophet in all the ages from Enoch to this day so why did Brother Vale say Enoch I don't know but it seems brother Vale thought brother Brandon would be raptured and not taste death like Enoch was raptured and did not die a fifth point is that Lee Vale did not say other than Jesus in this quotation and what I mean is that brother Vale did not write more thoroughly Vindicated than was any prophet in all ages other than Jesus or except for Jesus so this proves brother Vale in my opinion was wrong he should have added any profit in all the ages except for the Lord Jesus Christ and that's because no Prophet could be more Vindicated than the Lord Jesus Christ because every Prophet before Jesus wrote about Jesus prophesying of him and then every Prophet after Jesus spoke of Jesus and all the times Jesus fulfilled the word of God so no one could be more Vindicated than Jesus Christ and I feel it was wrong that brother Vale left out those words except for the Lord Jesus or other than the Lord Jesus Christ and Friends voice of God or Jeffersonville or Branham Tabernacle does the same thing as I'll show later they openly say brother and was the greatest prophet of all time and they failed to say except for Jesus or other than the Lord Jesus Christ which shows their exalting brother random to being equal with Jesus Christ or maybe greater than Jesus Christ which is an awful sin the sixth and final point is that this topic naturally leads into the discussion on the church age book validity which I will cover in a future video Lord willing and if you recall from my top 10 books I've ever read video the church age book is the second most influential book I've ever read in my entire life I love the church age book but it must be rightly divided just like all the brothers sermons since Lee Vale added some content to the church age book if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
