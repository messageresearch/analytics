Description:
Some misinterpret William Branham's quote stating that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is "without sensation." The true understanding of this quote is Brother Branham meant there was not one particular sensation, like speaking in tongues, a person had to experience when he was born again. 

In the New Testament, every person who was born again experienced a supernatural sensation and this Holy Ghost experience can never change. Also, Brother Branham has quotes both before and after the "without sensation" quote that prove he believed each person must have a supernatural, sensational experience when being born again. 

Message believers cannot be fooled into believing the Holy Ghost baptism is a dead, unemotional experience. The elect cannot be deceived.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same sensation the same sensation greetings friends in the name above all names the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to answer the question what did brother branham mean when he said the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation some interpret this quote to mean there is no emotion or feeling when a person is baptized with the holy ghost did brother branham mean a believer will feel no sensation in his body human spirit or soul when he is born again by the baptism of the holy ghost i truly believe the answer is no based upon two proofs first the new testament proves every believer from every church age and as many believers as the lord our god shall call has some sort of sensation when he or she is born again as peter declared on the day of pentecost in acts 2 verse 33 and verses 38 and 39 and also in acts 11 15 peter said the father's promise of the holy ghost hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear and also in acts 2 verse 38 and 39 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call and of course the lord our god is still calling souls today to be baptized with the holy ghost acts 11 verse 15 says and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning the bible is clear that the gospel cannot change according to galatians 1 verses 6 through 12 and revelation chapter 22 verses 18 and 19. paul said we are to keep jesus's commandments without spot until the appearing of the lord jesus christ in first timothy 6 14. brother branham wrote in the church age book that the seventh angel could not change one word that was given to paul by jesus christ let's listen to the quote it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people that original word could not change not even a dot or dash of it paul knew it was god who had spoken to him so he said even if i come and try to give a second revelation try to make one little change in what i gave originally let me be accursed one of these days there is going to come a prophet to the laodicean church age and you will know if he is the real one sent from god or not yes you will for if he is of god he will be in that word exactly as god gave it to paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iota so when you take everything back to the bible like the without sensation quote you never find the baptism of the holy ghost or seal of the holy ghost changing so when brother branham said without sensation he was not changing the baptism of the holy ghost i believe he was simply saying there was no certain evidence as he said in another quote which we'll hear later in this video and again as acts 11 verse 15 said peter told us the holy ghost felt the same way on the day of pentecost as it did in corneas house it felt the same on jews as it did gentiles and remember jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever according to hebrews 13 verse 8. the second reason i believe every person needs a sensation or supernatural experience when they get the baptism of the holy ghost is because brother branham has quotes both before and after the quote about without sensation that prove he believed every person needed a definite emotional powerful experience with the holy ghost as vindication they were born again or baptized with the holy ghost in other words there are quotes before is this the sign of the answer sermon and there's quotes after is this a sign of the end times sermon where brother ranum supports that each person have a supernatural emotional powerful sensational experience when they're baptized with the holy ghost so it seems the quote without sensation means without a requirement or mandate to speak in tongues or produce one certain sensation or evidence here's the outline for the video first we'll examine the without sensation quote comparing it with scripture second we'll look at quotes before the without sensation quote third we'll look at quotes after the without sensation quote and fourth we'll look at three reasons some want the false without sensation interpretation examining the without sensation quote and comparing it with scripture let's listen to the without sensation quote from brother the branham of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation but the person of christ performing in you the same works that he did friend i have two observations about this quote first notice brother branham quoted no scripture so we don't know which verse he's referring to and all quotes from brother branham must be taken back to the bible to be proven as the bible says and also as brother branham taught us brother brahm said quote now we must prove all things by the scripture if it's contrary to my faith and yet the scripture says so the scripture is right and i'm wrong see the scripture is always right and the only way you can do anything is to come back to the scripture end quote again brother branham said quote well you say how do you know that you're not right then test me by the word come test your denomination by this word let's see who is right prove all things the bible said end quote if we go back to the scripture the holy ghost baptism experience is something that is poured out from god according to acts 2 verse 17. it is also seen and heard according to acts 2 verse 33 when the holy ghost baptism falls on a believer it has such a sensation upon them that others can observe it with their eyes and ears as peter said and an unbeliever would think the person who was filled with the holy ghost was drunk on natural wine according to acts 2 13. the spirit-filled believer would also declare the wonderful works of god with their mouth according to acts 2 verse 11. so we see the baptism of the holy ghost is poured out it's seen and heard people accuse them of being drunk and the believers declare god's works with their mouth i also call it the see and hear principle of being born again just like a natural birth of a baby is both seen and heard so is a spiritual baby's birth seen and heard remember this experience is to as many as would believe as peter said in acts 2 verse 39 as many as the lord our god shall call and remember acts 11 15 peter said the holy ghost fell the same on the jews as the gentiles acts 11 15 says and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning so in cornelius house when the holy ghost fell on the gentiles observers would have thought they were drunk on natural wine so of course they had the same sensation they had on the day of pentecost when the jews like peter and james and john went out into the streets praising god and declaring the wonderful works of god a second observation about though without sensation quote is that it reminds me of john 14 verse 12 where jesus said the works that i do ye shall do also friends as holy ghost filled believers we should be doing the works of christ we should ask ourselves what works am i doing as a message believer claiming to have the holy ghost that jesus did those who don't believe in the supernatural baptism of the holy ghost with signs wonders and miracles and sensations are denying this part of the quote and they're basically splicing this quote they're only saying baptism of the holy ghost without sensation but leaving out the works of christ let's not be guilty of splicing quotes let's not be guilty of refusing to take quotes back to the scripture so we should have a baptism of the holy ghost experience with sensations just like they did on the day of pentecost and in corneas house and then the works of christ should follow in our lives as the bible said in mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe here's another observation there's a quote in the same sermon as the without sensation quote which is is this the sign of the end times sir from december 1962 and brother branham said he was against the evidence of the holy ghost as being speaking in tongues so this proves brother branham could have been talking about tongues are not the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost when he was saying without sensation let's listen to the chicago quote association is going to challenge me on the baptism in the name of jesus christ the greater chicago ministerial association is going to challenge me on the evidence of the holy ghost speaking in tongues they're going to chase me on the serpent seed and on the creation of grace but also then later in the same sermon he said real believers have tongues he said our holy ghost filling should produce signs miracles and wonders speaking in tongues and the things that early church had let's listen to the quote will this be the mystery that would open up that would bring christ bring up power to the church uh see we've already we believe in repentance being baptized in the name of jesus christ we believe in receiving the holy ghost we have signs wonders miracles speaking in tongues and the things that the early church had and frankly there's been more done right here that's wrote in the book of acts this one little group of people this little bitty ministry of archer what about the world over furthermore in the sermon before is this the sign of the answers in the morning of december 31 1962 brother branham was contending for tongues prophecy and all the gifts of the spirit in other words he was showing that the supernatural power of god will follow a believer who's baptized with the holy ghost in other words they'll have sensations in their life i have experiences with the holy ghost that they'll see and hear let's listen to the quote we baptist even immersing it's good what about the baptism what about speaking with tom what about gifts of healing what about prophecy oh no we don't that was for another age oh boy that's it brother when a man comes to christ you don't want to take some word some secretary's word some something else you promised us don't take this out of there go to that absolute until you're right you're there is being born again and filled with the holy ghost and you see the bible being manifested in humility and love through your life oh then that's your absolute yes sir before moving on to the next section here's a quote a year and a half later after the without sensation quote which is also after the opening of the seven seals wherein brother branham said we have the same sensation as the day of pentecost so i'm going to play both quotes back to back i'm going to play the without the sensation quote and then followed up with this other quote from the mighty god unveiled before us a year and a half later in the first quote by the band will say without sensation and the next quote he'll say the same sensation let's listen to the quotes back to back the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation but the person of christ performing in you the same works that he did and now it's right to bring him back exactly like he was at the beginning the same ministry the same jesus the same power the same holy ghost the same one that come down in the day of pentecost is the same holy promises manifested today from barrier to parent to with the baptism of the holy ghost with the same sign same numbers same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same sensation it's from prayer and today [Music] friend the bible has no contradictions and god's prophet brother branham finished the mystery of god the baptism of the holy ghost is mysterious according to colossians chapter 1. the only logical conclusion about the quotes saying without sensation and same sensation is that brother branham supported a holy ghost baptism experience identical to acts chapter 2 and the without sensation quote means without a mandate to speak in tongues or have any other one single evidence quotes before the without sensation quote i'm going to share three quotes that brother branham gave before the without sensation quote that proved he believed the baptism of the holy ghost experience did have sensations feelings emotions the same sensations they had on the day of pentecost the first quote is from who is this 1959 brother ram said on the day of pentecost they acted like they were drunk and he said when the same spirit is poured out upon a congregation of people the same results will take place today let's listen to the quote on the day of pentecost when the holy spirit came into the people they acted like they were drunk even so much as they stopped and made fun of it said these men are full of new wine peter said you men of jerusalem and you that dwell in judea let this known unto you and hearken unto my words for these are not drunken as you suppose but this is that which is spoken by the prophet joel it'll come to pass the last day of god i pour my spirit out upon all flesh when that same spirit is poured out upon a congregation of people the same results will take place or you cannot put a life of a grapevine in a pumpkin and make it bear pumpkins it'll bear grapes by the fruits they are known the church is knowing the world's wondering the second quote was it wasn't so from the beginning 1960 brother brahm said every person will have the same reaction to the baptism of the holy ghost like they received at pentecost let's listen to the quote [Applause] under the power of the holy spirit he cannot change that he cannot [Applause] [Music] the third quote is from the rejected king 1960 brother ram said the same holy ghost that found the day of pentecost is the same holy ghost and it has to bring the same experience to you if not you have a different holy spirit than that was let's listen to the quote and the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost which we all know that that was the birth of the new church if that same holy spirit don't bring the same experience to you then you've got a different holy spirit from what that was that god if it don't make you live a sacrificial life and a life full of joy and pleasure and the baptism of the spirit leading you into signs and wonders and miracles and things that something happened jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe quotes after the without sensation quote in this section i'm going to share six quotes from after the without sensation quote that proved brother branham believed we had to have sensations we had to have supernatural experiences when we're baptized with the holy ghost the first is from pardon 1963 brother braham said when the same spirit comes upon you you act the same way let's listen to the was our quote [Music] no one will have to say but what or can say but what that the church was inaugurated on the day of pentecost and the same spirit that come upon them on that day every time without fail in the bible when the holy ghost came upon the people they acted the same way in this next quote from desperations 1963 i love this quote brother ram said the holy ghost has just not no certain evidence you might speak in tongues you might you might cast out devils you might have many different kinds of sensations but you will have some kind of sensation when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost let's listen to the quote and that token is your affair and now it shows that the blood has been shed and been applied to you the price has been applied to you and you have the token that the blood is applied to you and you're accepted get it now oh no no certain evidence see you say brother brown i feel it in your mind you see why will i know look what were you and where are you that's how you know what was you before this token was applied what are your hatred supplies and these other things just automatically go with that see it isn't like talking about say tongues is [Applause] and doing those things and preaching and whatever is the evidence that's there true but it's it's not it see it's the gift of it if i told you that you said uh i want you brother brown and i'll give you a gift see well that's not me that's my gift tongues is the gift of the holy ghost not the holy ghost a gift of the holy ghost and the devil can't impersonate any of those things but he cannot be the holy ghost he can impersonate these gifts but he can't be the holy ghost amen a third quote i love is from the fourth seal 1963 brother ram said you have to wait on the holy spirit until something happens like the apostles waited and received such a positive experience from the holy ghost and i love it he says i don't care what form it comes in just so it happened that's the main thing he said you might dance emotional shout he said but the main thing is make sure you're changed brother branham said the baptism of the holy ghost took the fear out of the apostles in acts chapter 2. and he said if that experience brought such a positive change that they sealed their testimonies with their blood we should have a very similar life-changing experience let's listen to the quote hello uh jesus told them luke 24 49 behold i send the promise of my father upon you but you go up to jerusalem and wait until what was the promise of the father joel 2 28 while we find out he's going to pour out the spirit now isaiah 28 19 how there'd be stammer lips and other tongues and all these things they went up there and as we went through it maybe one said well people waited long enough let's just accept it by faith that's good baptist doctrine but it didn't work with them so then the first thing you know it had to become a reality and they waited on their ministry for their word to be vindicated and when you come to seek the holy spirit you do the same yes you can't accept it by faith you have to accept christ by faith that's exactly right and you accept the holy spirit by faith but then let the holy spirit come and give the circumcision as a witness that he's accepted your faith you see and see abraham believed god it was imputed to him for righteousness but god gave him the sign of circumcision has a confirmation he had accepted his pain so that's the same thing we must do we must wait on the holy spirit tell us done something not necessary because we've spoken down and not because we danced we got emotional we shot it until we were changed until something actually happened i don't care what form it comes in just so it happened that's the main thing man speaking thomas doesn't do it do i speak with tongue of men and angels and have not charity and profit me nothing see no i could do it see so those things doesn't mean that you have the holy spirit but when he the person the immortal spirit of christ becomes your personal savior changes you and throws your views right straight into caliber into this world something's happening something has happened no one will have to tell you about it you'll know it when it happens and the new wine when it brings revelation then it's revealed and that's where it was at pentecost they know that there's supposed to be a spirit poured out upon and they waited till this happened and when the vindication of the revelation took place then stimulation was over and sure did they steamed up too they right out into the streets where there was afraid at the door shut and they were out in the streets or they've been afraid of a group of people of preaching the gospel see something happened because the true word of promise was vindicated now let's stop here if that brought such positive to that man that the nearly every one of them sealed their testimony with their blood no matter what come on as long as they live they never got over it it stayed there because it was the true word of promise vindicated the revelation become a vindicator and they died sealing your testimony with their own blood the fifth quote is from questions and answers part two 1964. they asked brother branham at the instant of receiving the holy ghost is there a difference and brother branham answered with a question could you imagine a mother giving birth to a baby and not knowing it so in other words yes something has to happen the person has to know something has changed when they receive the baptism of the holy ghost he said there's something that changes takes place in you let's listen to the quote question for sunday morning sorry this time at the instant of receiving the holy ghost or the baptism of the holy ghost is there a difference does a person speak with tongues if not [Music] always what manifestation is known well could you imagine a mother giving birth to a baby and not knowing it should have to be unconscious not to know it neither can you receive the holy ghost without knowing it there's something takes place in you see there's something that changes you your whole system your whole spiritual system is made new again and you become a new creature in christ as the bible puts it a new creation in christ you know it now you say brother brad then you don't believe that a man should speak with tongues to receive the holy ghost not to prove he's got the holy ghost i would that ever remember my church spoke with tongues i would like for him to do that and if i believe if you ask god god will grant it to you but let me tell you i know plenty people speak in tongues and hasn't got the holy ghost and there's not a minister's true with himself and with his congregation but while telling his congregation the same the devil can impersonate that the sixth and final quote is why it had to be shepherds and of course saints there's more quotes than this but i just wanted to give a sample brother brandon quotes acts 2 verse 39 and he says if god is still calling the same experience is for you if you'll follow the same prescription let's listen to the quote the first priest if you want to call him peter that had the keys to the kingdom how did he to say he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is to you and to your children and to all even as many as the lord are god shall call and if god is still calling the same experience is for you if you follow the same prescription if this congregation believes that three reasons somewhat the false without sensation interpretation now friends there could be more reasons why people don't want an emotional sensational baptism of the holy ghost experience but i found three simple ones from the scripture the first one is they'd rather foolishly waste their time than get down to business with god that's in ephesians 5 verses 15 through 17. paul said the wise christians redeem the time they understand the will of god they walk circumspectly or exactly but fools then would waste time so the reason some people don't want sensation at the moment they're born again is because they don't want to invest time into dying out and seeking god's face second reason people want no sensation is because they don't want to pray they don't want to ask and they don't want to fully die out luke 11 13 tells us this jesus said how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him some people just don't know how to pray they don't know how to see god's face they don't want to see god's face they just want to be saved but they still want to enjoy the foolish things of the world but a real believer will get down to business with god they'll ask jesus for the holy ghost and they'll keep asking until they receive it the third reason is they don't hunger enough according to matthew 5 6 jesus said blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled so jesus plainly tells us this we have a thirst in our soul we have a hunger in our soul for god's spirit to fill our souls but we've got to satisfy that thirst we've got to satisfy that hunger and the only way to do that is through prayer reading the scriptures obeying the word of god redeeming the time it reminds me of what stephen said in acts chapter 7 ye always do resist the holy ghost so people that falsely interpret the without sensation quote it's likely they're the ones that are resisting the move of the holy spirit they're afraid of what will happen they're afraid of what they'll have to give up if they do get born again just like the type of israel going into the promised land at kadesh barnea they were afraid of the giants some people are afraid of the battles they'll have to face if they get born again they're afraid of the persecution afraid of the struggles afraid of the criticism but a child of god just wants god's spirit the spirit of their father to indwell them and be the seal in their soul until the day of redemption in closing i hope this video was a blessing friends this was a question one of the viewers had and i had it a couple times within a week so i felt compelled perhaps i should make a video on this again friends we must take every quote back to the bible the bible says prove all things and if we have the holy ghost baptism and if we've had a sensational experience with the baptism of the holy ghost then the holy ghost will guide us into all truth and jesus said thy word is truth the holy ghost will always point us back to the word of god and when we do that we understand the holy ghost baptism experience can never change and that will help us interpret the without sensation quote to mean that brother branham is saying we don't have to speak in tongues to know we're born again there's no certain evidence for the baptism of the holy ghost but when you have a real holy ghost baptism experience it'll be something people can see and hear just as peter said on the day of pentecost and also in acts 11 15. if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
