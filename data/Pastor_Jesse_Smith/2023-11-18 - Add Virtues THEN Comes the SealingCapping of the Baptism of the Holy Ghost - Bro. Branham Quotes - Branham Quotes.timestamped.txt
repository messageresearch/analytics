[0:03] Faith virtue see come up knowledge

[0:11] brotherly kindness and then the love of
[0:14] God a holy ghost Christ in the person of
[0:18] the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the
[0:20] true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you
[0:23] got all these virtues sealed in you then
[0:26] God lives in a tabernacle amen amen
[0:31] called the building the living
[0:35] Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling
[0:38] Place amen when a man possesses these
[0:41] kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes
[0:44] upon him no matter you might speak with
[0:46] tongues you might impersonate any gift
[0:48] that God's Got You might do that but
[0:50] until these virtues here go into you
[0:54] you're still off the real true
[0:55] foundation of Faith right but when these
[0:58] virtues grow in and you added that to
[1:00] that then you are a living
[1:05] Monument you are a living moving
[1:11] aisle add to your faith
[1:15] virtue add to your virtue knowledge to
[1:18] your knowledge Temperance to your
[1:20] Temperance patience to your patience
[1:23] godliness to your godl brotherly love to
[1:26] your brotherly love the Holy Spirit and
[1:28] Christ will come because just beneath
[1:31] him the holy spirit is the spirit of
[1:34] Jesus Christ into the church to manifest
[1:36] those
[1:38] virtues bless you brother Neville so
[1:41] happy to be back in the church tonight
[1:44] just a teeny bit
[1:46] horse have a long message this morning
[1:50] and I'm sure happy it was here old and
[1:54] enjoyed it
[1:55] myself I'm bringing it and I hope you
[1:58] enjoy hearing amen don't forget now
[2:03] always remember this that these are the
[2:08] things that build the servant of
[2:13] christall Faith
[2:15] first than virtue and now remember the
[2:20] Holy Spirit
[2:22] cannot kep the building of God until
[2:26] these things are operating by the am no
[2:31] matter what you do those are the things
[2:34] that builds the body of Christ amen
[2:39] those things now don't forget that that
[2:42] this year is first is your faith virtue
[2:47] knowledge and so forth is to be added to
[2:49] it until the complete statue of Christ
[2:53] is made manifest then the Holy Spirit
[2:55] comes up on it and seals it as one body
[3:00] amen these things must be therefore
[3:03] Jesus said by their fruit they are known
[3:09] see fruit you could not bear fruit
[3:11] without these things to Bear it in you
[3:14] and then when all this takes the place
[3:16] of worldliness and and ungodliness and
[3:19] so forth then all unbelief is cast out
[3:22] and all the things of the world is
[3:24] passed away then there's nothing but a
[3:26] new creature in Christ and then a
[3:29] Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy
[3:31] spirit of God whereby you are
[3:35] sealed to the day of your Redemption
[3:39] sealed into the kingdom of God I don't
[3:42] forget that keep that in mind now takes
[3:44] these things
[3:46] first yes then the cealing is the Holy
[3:49] Spirit the cap that seals us into the
[3:54] body and now as in the individuals these
[3:57] virtues and things are knowledge and
[3:59] tempers is added to our faith then when
[4:02] the Capstone comes the Holy Spirit
[4:04] cement it together amen hall hallelujah
[4:08] there's the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[4:10] that's why it's so short
[4:12] today you remember the pyramid
[4:15] message it's the Capstone what did he do
[4:19] the Holy Spirit capped off the
[4:21] individual and seal it when we added to
[4:23] our faith righteousness and godliness
[4:26] and faith and so forth we kept adding to
[4:28] it till we got SA things and the seventh
[4:31] one was love which is God that's how he
[4:33] makes the individual and caps him and
[4:35] seals him with the Holy Spirit then if
[4:37] that be so he's got seven Church ages
[4:39] that he's had seven Mysteries that's
[4:41] been sounded away and they' fought for
[4:43] to bring back and now the cstone
[4:46] comes the cap off the
[4:49] church add to your faith virture and so
[4:52] forth all this in First Peter the first
[4:55] uh second Peter be the first chapter for
[4:57] it's all added to your Faith all these
[5:00] things godliness and Purity and Holiness
[5:03] and everything and then you're sealed by
[5:04] the Holy Ghost but it's just like
[5:07] somebody they people claim to have this
[5:10] when they haven't because they've been
[5:12] falsely
[5:13] taught the Methodist get a funny feeling
[5:16] used to it shake a little bit or or
[5:18] dance in the spirit the Pentecostal
[5:21] speak with tongues or or do something
[5:23] emotional I believe those things
[5:25] certainly but those things without these
[5:27] others is no good hey
