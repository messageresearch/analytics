TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] She shall not teach or serve any authority but to be in silence. Well, you say, "The Lord told me to do it." I don't doubt that one bit. Did you hear my message the other night about Balum? Balam got the first straight cut decision of God. Don't do it. But he kept on fooling around and finally God told him to go do it. God might permit you to preach. I don't say anything, but it's not according to his original word and plan. For she's to be under obedience as also saith the law. Greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question who is new to the message. Can women evangelize? So, this viewer has been visiting our church recently. He's a wonderful blessing to our service. He's new to the ministry of William Brandham. and he has a friend who believes women are not allowed to lead a congregation as far as being a pastor, but his friend had the question, can women evangelize? So, excellent question, especially from a person who's unfamiliar with brother Bram's message of the hour, the apostolic faith restored here in the end time. So, first I want to reference a video I put out October 5th, 2014. It's called Women Angels and Women Preachers. It's the eighth video I put out. It's only 13 minutes long, so it' be well worth your time if you haven't seen this video. The origin of that video was I had seen how some of the accusers of brother Brandham had said that Zechariah 5:9 was a proof of women angels. And that's a lie. Of course, they're wrong. Again, it's another proof that they're trying to slander brother Brandham, and they're not called to rightly divide the word of God. Anyone who studies that passage and even the writings of some of the commentators will know that those two women are not angels. They're nations likely Assyria and Babylon because they have stork wings. Why would the holy God of heaven allow his angels to have abominable wings because stors were an abomination to Israel? Makes no sense. and it shows these accusers make no sense when they're trying to discredit Brother Brandham. So anyways, that was the kind of origin of that video, but I also showed how there's no such thing as women preachers in the entire Bible. So before we answer this question about evangelizing, let's hit a few of those main points from that video. There's no women angels in the entire Bible. All the angels in the Bible are referenced as men. And the word angel means messenger. So, an angel is a messenger of the word of God, showing how women are not to carry the word of God with any authority over a man. Second, the Old Testament never had women priests. I think it's Leviticus 21 that goes through the requirements of priests and they were always men. So, the spiritual leadership of Israel was always men only, no women. Some people think Deborah was a preacher, but no, she just had the gift to prophesy, which means foretell future events in the name of the Lord. And she was a judge, which is equivalent to a judge today, who would sit in a courthouse and judge cases. And that's because the leadership of Israel was really low at that time. So Deborah was not a priest. She could not be because God's law refused women to be priests. And then the New Testament, there was never women apostles. Jesus never called a woman to go preach. So we see the same principle in the Old and New Testaments. In fact, one of those verses is Mark 3:14. And he Jesus ordained 12 that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach. Jesus only ordained men to preach the gospel. Romans 10:14-15 says, "How shall they hear without a preacher?" So God is only going to use preachers. And how shall they preach except they be sent? If Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever, which he is according to Hebrews 13:8, if he only sent men yesterday, then he'll only send men today by the grace of God. And I challenge anyone look up that word preach in the Greek lexicon. It's used 60 times. I went through everyone today, this morning. Not one of them mentions a woman preaching. Another word for that is publishing. God never asked a woman or sent a woman or ordained a woman to preach or publish the gospel of Jesus Christ. And just a few more quick verses. Uh Paul in Galatians 1:es 6-12 said, "If anyone preaches a different gospel, they're cursed." And so Paul never ordained a woman preacher. Of course, people know this if they read 1 Timothy 2 11-15. Paul said, "I did not suffer a woman to teach or assert any authority over a man." Because Adam was formed first, then Eve, and Eve was the one being deceived in the transgression. So that was Paul's reasoning. He went back to the beginning, Genesis, and the woman was deceived with the word of God. So therefore, she's not allowed to preach the word of God. And then 1 Corinthians 14:es 34-4, Paul says, "Women are to be silent in the church." And of course that has to refer only to being preachers because we know women can sing in the church. Women can operate in the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit. But it's not from the platform. It's not in the place of authority or leadership. It would be out in the congregation. They're not called to be leaders in any capacity in the house of God. Spiritual leadership is male only according to the Old Testament and the New Testament. And then Paul said, "We'll all be judged by his gospel." the secrets of men's hearts will be judged by Paul's gospel according to Romans 2:16. So there's no other gospel than Paul's and we're all judged by Paul's gospel. So if Paul did not suffer or allow a woman to teach men or to have any authority over men, then we'll all be judged by that and women will be judged by that who claim that they're called to preach. Okay, that's a summary there. Now let's go to this question. Can women evangelize? And as I was meditating on that, the thought came that the word evangelize is only used three times in the entire Bible. It's Acts 21:8, Ephesians 4:1, and 2 Timothy 4:5. So, we have to speak where the Bible speaks, right? And be silent where the Bible's silent. So, the Bible speaks on evangelists three times, and it's never referring to women. Acts 21:8 refers to Philip the Evangelist, male. And then 2 Timothy 4:5 refers to Timothy doing the work of an evangelist. Timothy is a man male. So those two witnesses are male only evangelists. And then Ephesians 4:1 goes through the five New Testament preaching gifts. Apostle, prophet, teacher, pastor, evangelist. So there's only five preaching gifts in the New Testament. And there's no Bible witness of a woman having any of those five gifts in the New Testament. Look up apostle. Every time it's used in the New Testament, it will never mention a woman as an apostle and so forth with pastor, teacher, evangelist, and prophet. There's never a woman prophet who led with spiritual leadership in the church of God. Not in the New Testament and not in the Old Testament. So with those three verses, there's never a woman evangelist. So women cannot evangelize in a service and have authority over men because it's against the word of God. I think it's interesting to point out in 1 Corinthians 14 34-40 Paul said women have to be silent which also saith the law. So Paul recognized there's this continuity or harmony between the old and new testaments that women are not to have spiritual leadership. And I read a few of the commentators like John Gil and Albert Barnes, Matthew Henry, and they take that phrase as also sayith the law of St. Paul and they reference Genesis 3:16 where God told Eve, "Your desire will be to your husband, and he shall rule over you." So those commentators believe Paul was referring back to Genesis 3:16 as proof women are not called to have authority in a spiritual assembly. And that aligns perfectly what Paul wrote in 1 Timothy 2:es 11-15. Eve was deceived, therefore she cannot teach or preach or have any authority in the house of God. Now, here's some verses I believe that will help women know their place better. Women can testify. That's in John 4:39. The woman at the well was discerned by the Lord Jesus with the Messiah sign, which God used in Brother Bram's life as well. Brother Ran was not the Messiah, but he pointed us to the Messiah. And the Bible said she testified to the men in the city and everybody all the things the Lord had told her and discerned in her life. So testify means to give a report. It's like a reporter. A reporter is supposed to just tell what he or she saw or heard. And that's what women can do. They can just tell the facts, testify of what happened. But they're not to rightly divide the word of truth. They're not to teach and herald and proclaim the gospel with spiritual authority in a public setting, but they can testify or report as a witness of what they saw and heard. Older women can also teach the younger women, but not in a church service, not with spiritual authority. That's in Titus 2:es 3-5. The older women can teach the younger women how to love their husbands, love their children, that the word of God not be blasphemed, but that is not behind a pulpit. It's not in a place of public authority. There's no implication in John 4:39 or Titus 2:es 3-5 that women can teach men or evangelize to men. They cannot do it. They can only testify and give a witness or recollection or an account of what they saw and heard. Another important scripture is Acts 18:26. Some think this scripture allows women to teach men because it says Aquilla and Priscilla expounded unto Apollos the more excellent way, which would have been the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But again, we can't make this verse allow women to teach men because you don't have two or three witnesses. The Bible said, "Let every word be established in the mouth of two or three witnesses." So you have no other verses in the entire Bible allowing women spiritual authority in the Old Testament priesthood or the New Testament five-fold preaching gifts. So it seems Priscilla was simply just testifying of the further revelation she had seen and heard that Apollos had not seen or heard. And of course her husband Aquilla was present. The Bible doesn't say Aquilla said, "Oh, I'd like my wife Priscilla to preach to Apollos." The Bible doesn't say that. So, it seems like Priscilla just testified, which would line up with John 4:39, the woman at the well. Or she could have used one of the nine gifts of the spirit. And of course, you have word of wisdom, word of knowledge, gift of faith, gift of miracles, tongues, interpretation, gift of discernment, all the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit. The women can be used of those, but not in the public setting where it's a service, where there's spiritual authority behind a pulpit or behind a platform. So women can have words of wisdom. They can have words of knowledge. But it's through their testimony. It's not through rightly dividing the word of truth in a public place of authority behind a pulpit. And those nine gifts are not preaching gifts. They're just simply gifts of the Holy Spirit used in a minor way. They're not leadership gifts as also saith the law as Paul says. I think I'll close with one quote from brother Brandham. I love this quote. It's from the choosing of a bride 1965. I've always shared this with people. Brother Bram said, "Many sisters told him, "The Lord called me to preach." And I love what brother Bram said. He said, "I'm not going to argue with you, but I'm going to tell you the word says you not to do it." And the woman would still say, "Well, the Lord told me to do it." Brother Ram said, "I don't doubt that one bit." Now, that's quite a statement. When I first heard this back in probably 2001 or 2002, I was shocked and surprised to hear him say that. But then brother Ram said, "Did you hear my message the other night on Balum?" Balam got the first straight cut decision of God. Don't do it. But he kept on fooling around till finally God told him to go do it. And then he tells the women, "God might permit you to preach. I don't say he didn't, but it's not according to the original word and plan." So this was such a wise answer. Brother Ram, again showing the difference between the perfect will of God and the permissive will of God. Women might be called to preach, but it wasn't God's first word. And women ought to fear God to know that if they are called to preach, it was God's permissive will and they're in the same shoes of Balum. So may God have mercy on those women who continue to preach, yet it would be in God's permissive will. And this also reminds me of a few years ago, Joseph Brandham said he had the word of the Lord that they're in the will of God by pressing play. And I said on my video, I don't doubt that. But it wasn't God's first word because pressing play and obey and sitting all the preachers down cannot be the perfect will of God because it goes against the Bible. God always had living men preaching the living word of God. And what the tape church ministry is doing is similar to what's found in Matthew 25. They're telling preachers to go bury your preaching gift in the ground. And that's a lazy and slothful servant. And of course, there's, you know, 23 other sins that the Brandom Tabernacle is guilty of propagating, which I have a video series on that if you're interested in that. But I don't doubt God told Joseph Brandham he's in his will for pressing play and obey. But it wasn't the first word of God because you never see that in the entire Bible. And if any man changes one thing Paul preached, they're curse according to the Bible and according to what brother Brandham reiterated from the Bible. So, the brand tabernacle has changed so many things about the gospel and preaching and the five-fold ministry. They will answer to God for that. But let's listen to this quote from the choosing of a bride. She persuaded him out of the will of God and caused him to do something that he should not have done and by it caused death to the whole human race. That's why the Bible forbids her to teach or to preach or to handle God's word. Amen. Amen. I know sisters, many of you say, "The Lord called me to preach." I'm not going to argue with you, but I'm going to tell you the word says you not to do it. She shall not teach or serve any authority, but to be in silence. Well, you say, "The Lord told me to do it." I don't doubt that one bit. Did you hear my message the other night about Balum? Amen. Balam got the first straight cut decision of God. Don't do it. But he kept on fooling around and finally God told him to go do it. God might permit you to preach. I don't say he didn't. But it's not according to his original word and plan. For she's to be under obedience as also sayeth the law. It's true. Therefore, she's not supposed to do it. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. I love revisiting some of these topics. It' been a long time since I put out a video about women preachers. So hopefully this was a help by the grace of God. We should be so thankful that we have the New Testament faith, the faith of the apostles restored to us through the ministry of the seven church age messenger, the seventh angel, God's prophet, brother William Brandham. It's such a privilege. God help us to stand with it, stay with it by the grace of God, not add to it, not take away from it by the grace of God. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. It never failed. [Music]
