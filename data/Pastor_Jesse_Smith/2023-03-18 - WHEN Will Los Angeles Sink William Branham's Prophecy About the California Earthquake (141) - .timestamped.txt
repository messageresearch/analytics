[0:00] [Music]
[0:11] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:14] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:16] when will the Los Angeles earthquake
[0:19] happen
[0:20] a viewer recently asked me my opinion so
[0:24] this video provides my answer by God's
[0:26] grace
[0:27] I have four points on this subject
[0:31] and so I'll start with the first point
[0:32] the first point is likely no one knows
[0:36] when the Los Angeles earthquake will
[0:38] happen
[0:39] I do not know when the Los Angeles
[0:41] earthquake will happen and it seems no
[0:43] one else knows as well only the Lord
[0:45] Jesus Christ knows that answer
[0:49] and before moving on to the second Point
[0:50] Let's listen to a few quotes from
[0:52] Brother Branham where he prophesied that
[0:54] Los Angeles will sink beneath the ocean
[0:56] let's listen to the quotes
[1:07] say of the Lord it will
[1:12] wash these
[1:13] or she's one hour I don't know
[1:15] it will son
[1:18] look here do you know what the Lord says
[1:21] about Los Angeles these places here
[1:22] she's gone you remember what I told you
[1:24] about two years ago how that earthquake
[1:26] could come and can't up here in Alaska I
[1:28] also tell you that Hollywood in Los
[1:31] Angeles is sliding into the ocean
[1:34] California you're doomed
[1:37] not only in California but you world
[1:39] your doomed Church unless you get right
[1:42] with God you're doomed
[1:44] thus saith the Holy Spirit have you ever
[1:47] heard me use that name unless it
[1:51] now let's look at Point number two
[1:53] brother random said Los Angeles would
[1:56] sink before the coming of the Lord but
[1:58] he didn't say which coming of the Lord
[2:00] in the sermon who do you say this is in
[2:03] 1964 brother Branham said quote I
[2:05] predict before the coming of the Lord
[2:07] Jesus that God will sink that place I
[2:10] believe that Hollywood and Los Angeles
[2:12] and then filthy places over there that
[2:14] God
[2:15] Almighty will sink them they'll go
[2:17] beneath the bottom of the sea end quote
[2:20] so a couple things to notice first
[2:22] notice this is a prediction brother
[2:23] Branham never said thus say the Lord it
[2:25] would be before the coming of the Lord
[2:27] Jesus
[2:28] and then also we have to remember we
[2:30] don't know which coming brother Branham
[2:31] was referring to
[2:32] for example is it the Rapture coming
[2:34] which is the snatching away or catching
[2:37] away of the Gentile bride of Jesus
[2:39] Christ before the tribulation sets in
[2:42] or does Los Angeles sink before Jesus
[2:44] comes to the 144 000 Jews and seals them
[2:48] with the Holy Ghost
[2:49] around the middle of the seven year
[2:52] Great Tribulation period
[2:54] or is it during the second half of the
[2:56] Great Tribulation period
[2:57] before Armageddon
[2:59] so at this point friends I don't know
[3:01] and I don't think anyone else knows so
[3:04] we just want to be humble with this
[3:05] question and the answer
[3:07] now my opinion the one that makes sense
[3:09] to me is that the Los Angeles earthquake
[3:12] would happen before the battle of
[3:14] Armageddon towards the end of The Seven
[3:17] Year Great Tribulation period
[3:19] but that's just my humble opinion
[3:21] now let's look at point three it would
[3:24] likely be one of the major earthquakes
[3:26] mentioned in the Book of Revelation and
[3:28] so to me it seems like Revelation 16
[3:30] Verse 18 would be the worst earthquake
[3:33] ever according to the Bible
[3:36] so the Book of Revelation lists five
[3:38] earthquakes total
[3:40] in The Sixth Seal in Revelation 6 verse
[3:42] 12 it mentions an earthquake and this
[3:45] might be the Los Angeles earthquake
[3:47] Where The Ram said The Sixth Seal was
[3:50] the tribulation seal initiated by Moses
[3:53] and Elijah or two men Anointed with
[3:54] their spirits
[3:56] second verse is in Revelation 8 verse 5.
[3:59] this might be the Los Angeles earthquake
[4:02] there's a higher possibility because
[4:03] it's after the reality form of the
[4:06] seventh seal happens or after the
[4:08] Rapture of the Gentile Church
[4:10] and this earthquake would likely be
[4:12] before the trumpets and vials
[4:14] the third earthquake is mentioned in
[4:16] Revelation 11 verse 13. I don't believe
[4:19] this is the Los Angeles earthquake
[4:21] because this is the Jerusalem earthquake
[4:23] right in the midst of Daniel's 70th week
[4:26] in the middle of the Great Tribulation
[4:28] and it seems like it's only in Jerusalem
[4:30] according to the context
[4:33] the fourth earthquake is Revelation 11
[4:35] verse 19. this might be the Los Angeles
[4:37] earthquake there's a higher possibility
[4:39] it could be this one the scripture
[4:41] speaks of hail and an earthquake after
[4:43] the seventh trumpet sounds
[4:45] the last earthquake mentioned is
[4:47] revelation 16 verse 18. in my opinion
[4:50] this is most likely the Los Angeles
[4:52] earthquake because Revelation 16 Verse
[4:55] 18 speaks of a great earthquake such as
[4:58] not since men were upon the Earth so
[5:00] mighty an earthquake and so great
[5:03] so my question is how could there be a
[5:05] worse earthquake than an earthquake that
[5:08] would cause Los Angeles to fall into the
[5:10] sea
[5:10] and again this is during the seventh and
[5:12] final vial in the Book of Revelation
[5:16] my fourth and final point is Billy
[5:18] Paul's testimony
[5:20] some people put weight on Billy Paul's
[5:22] testimony concerning Los Angeles sinking
[5:25] now I myself I do not put a lot of
[5:27] weight on Billy Paul's testimony the
[5:30] quote that Billy Paul shares is not on
[5:32] tape so I don't consider it
[5:35] I respect and have brotherly love for
[5:37] Billy Paul as he and I have exchanged
[5:39] letters in the mail but I believe he
[5:42] essentially worships the tapes whether
[5:44] he'll admit it or not or recognize it or
[5:46] not so I do not put a lot of weight on
[5:49] his words
[5:50] there's an excerpt from Peregrine's book
[5:52] called the acts of the prophet and it
[5:54] says quote after making this statement
[5:56] he turned to his son said Billy where
[5:58] are you standing downtown Los Angeles
[6:01] Billy Paul replied
[6:03] where are you standing query the prophet
[6:05] in front of the May Company downtown Los
[6:08] Angeles reply Billy at this brother
[6:10] Branham made a prophetic statement Billy
[6:12] he said I may not be here but you won't
[6:15] be an old man until sharks will swim
[6:17] right where we are standing end quote
[6:20] so there's a few things about this quote
[6:22] we don't understand again it's not on
[6:24] brother Ram's tapes so brother Brown
[6:26] never shared it publicly
[6:28] even in this quote there's no thus saith
[6:30] the Lord for brother Branham third some
[6:32] people say this quote is fulfilled
[6:33] because there's some type of aquarium
[6:35] where they were standing and there's
[6:37] currently an aquarium there right now
[6:38] again I don't know I've never been to
[6:40] that part of Los Angeles
[6:44] another thing about the quote from Billy
[6:45] Paws that
[6:47] apparently brother Branham said you
[6:49] would not be an old man and yet brother
[6:51] Billy Paul is over 85 years old
[6:56] so this doesn't seem to make sense
[6:57] because brother Branham called himself
[6:59] an old man when he was in his 50s
[7:01] so that's another reason I do not put a
[7:03] lot of weight on Billy Paul's story
[7:07] and also friends Billy Paul says just
[7:09] press play and press play and Obey but
[7:12] he and his church and his brothers
[7:14] Church do not allow the full bible-based
[7:17] fivefold ministry like brother Branham
[7:19] did
[7:20] my friends at brother Brandon was here I
[7:22] believe he'd be right behind five-fold
[7:23] Ministry preachers and not behind the
[7:26] Press Play and press play and Obey tape
[7:29] Church movement because that's what
[7:31] brother Branham said in 1964 let's
[7:33] listen to the quote
[7:35] would we still be on fire and preach the
[7:38] gospel or is the time over no keep
[7:41] preaching just as hard as you can preach
[7:43] brother stay with it I'm right behind
[7:44] you
[7:45] and since we're on this topic let me
[7:47] just add a few more quotes where brother
[7:49] Brown said don't change a thing to the
[7:50] Evangelistic Ministry and of course that
[7:53] includes the entire fivefold Ministries
[7:55] so brother Branham said don't change a
[7:57] thing and of course Jeffersonville is
[7:59] guilty of changing the fivefold ministry
[8:02] and then a final quote where brother
[8:04] random says the message of the hour is
[8:07] the fivefold ministry
[8:09] and he never said press play and obey
[8:13] or just press play
[8:15] or change the fivefold ministry in any
[8:17] way
[8:19] we cannot change the five-fold ministry
[8:20] nor any other part of the Gospel
[8:23] because in Galatians 1 Paul says anyone
[8:26] is cursed who changes the Gospel of
[8:28] Jesus Christ
[8:29] let's listen to the quotes
[8:32] uh should evangelists continue on the
[8:35] field
[8:37] in this hour of course what they mean
[8:39] certainly
[8:40] by all means don't change the thing
[8:43] if Jesus is coming in the morning Preach
[8:46] Today like if it's going to be 10 years
[8:47] someday but live life is going to be in
[8:49] this hour
[8:50] don't don't get scribbled up now that's
[8:53] why I'm trying to warn you about see
[8:55] just don't be odd for junior don't
[8:58] change nothing but if you're doing
[8:59] something wrong or doing evil repent
[9:02] all right come back to God continue on
[9:05] your Evangelistic service just as you
[9:07] always did
[9:09] worth the bride of Christ
[9:12] have a Ministry before the Rapture sure
[9:17] that's what's going on right now
[9:20] I've got a kind of serving it is a
[9:22] message of the hour amen I think the
[9:25] bride of Christ sure she's consisted of
[9:28] Apostles prophets teachers vastness and
[9:30] pastors is that right that's a bride of
[9:32] Christ or she's got a Ministry great
[9:34] Ministries the ministry of the hour
[9:36] it'll be so humble I remember I'm not
[9:39] even sure it's the first one on my last
[9:40] son see remember what I preached on
[9:44] humility
[9:46] oh don't forget that I'm going to stop a
[9:48] minute to warn that again remember when
[9:52] God predicts anything great to happen
[9:55] the people are looking so far away but
[9:57] their wisdom till they miss what happens
[10:00] When God says anything is great the word
[10:03] always said it that bunch of ignoramuses
[10:06] that's right but when the great world
[10:09] the great High Church said boy that's
[10:11] glorious God says a bunch of ignorance
[10:15] I believe brother Brandon was here he'd
[10:18] be right behind the five full ministry
[10:19] preachers and not tape worshipers
[10:22] because tape worshipers essentially deny
[10:25] Ephesians 4 verses 8-16 Noah not Billy
[10:29] Paul nor Joseph Branham can change the
[10:31] Gospel of Jesus Christ that he revealed
[10:33] to Paul in Ephesians 4 verses 8 through
[10:36] 16. the fivefold ministry cannot be
[10:39] changed to add a mandatory press play
[10:42] Dogma either before or after a living
[10:45] Minister preaches the word only living
[10:47] men are called to preach the Gospel of
[10:50] Jesus Christ as other videos of mine
[10:52] have shown
[10:54] in closing I hope this video was a
[10:56] blessing friends I've got numerous
[10:58] emails about this topic so I thought I'd
[11:00] make a short video about it and again
[11:02] I'm always open to correction by the
[11:04] word of God and by quotes
[11:06] really there's only one spirit that
[11:08] brings correction that's the spirit of
[11:09] Truth which is the Holy Ghost
[11:11] so friends the thing to do is fall more
[11:14] in love with the Lord Jesus Christ he
[11:16] promised if we're born again he would
[11:17] guide us into all truth we should search
[11:20] the Scriptures Daily for the Bible
[11:22] foundations that brother Brandon gave us
[11:24] if there's a great earthquake to come
[11:25] you would think it would be mentioned in
[11:27] the bible brother's Ministry came to
[11:29] point us back to the Bible
[11:31] so friends we're doing our best to
[11:33] rightly divide the word of Truth and
[11:34] we're preparing for the coming of the
[11:36] Lord Jesus Christ
[11:38] if you have any questions concerns or
[11:40] testimonies about this video please
[11:42] contact me
[11:44] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[11:46] the desire of your heart
