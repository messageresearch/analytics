[2:58] too if you want me to come back again in
[2:59] in the summer every other Thursday I'll
[3:01] be happy to do that by God's grace I
[3:02] would love to drive down here and be
[3:04] with the Saints and preach God's word uh
[3:08] I know uh I know how important it is you
[3:10] know uh to be established in the truth
[3:12] of the Bible uh you know when I first
[3:15] heard the message I would drive three
[3:17] hours across the state to Lima and
[3:20] that's where brother Craig Bo now he's a
[3:21] pastor in Connecticut and brother Isaiah
[3:23] Brooks he's now a pastor in Iowa that's
[3:25] where they would give me Bible studies
[3:27] and answer all my questions as much as
[3:29] possible I mean we don't know all the
[3:31] answers you know but we we sure got a
[3:33] lot of Bible Revelation by God's grace
[3:36] and so I just found that you know I did
[3:37] that for a number of years and I wrote
[3:39] down everything they said brother John I
[3:41] just made a list and eventually after
[3:43] the after I got into computers you know
[3:45] I started typing everything out so I got
[3:47] all these all these wonderful
[3:49] Revelations saved up there and uh I'm
[3:52] glad they're on the computer but I'm
[3:53] more grateful they're on the fleshly
[3:55] tables of my heart praise God because if
[3:57] I lose them that's fine uh the ible said
[4:00] the Holy Ghost will give me Remembrance
[4:01] in everything that I have need of
[4:03] Hallelujah I'm not trusting in the
[4:05] computer I'm trusting in the Holy Spirit
[4:08] Hallelujah but uh that's why I want to
[4:10] do that you know uh if you if you would
[4:12] like uh sermons there throughout the
[4:14] summer let me know we'll be happy to
[4:15] come down and Minister I'm grateful my
[4:17] wife could join me and my two little
[4:19] ones I'm very thankful my wife can come
[4:21] with us by God's grace so thank you
[4:23] honey for coming I appreciate that very
[4:25] much so I'd like to speak again this
[4:27] morning but in the days of The Voice of
[4:29] course this is looking at the ministry
[4:31] of God's Prophet uh brother brandham uh
[4:34] a Bible Prophet as you know and I like
[4:37] how you're all giving out those uh books
[4:39] you know uh as I told you you know the
[4:42] first time I heard brother brandham on
[4:44] tape uh listening to him I had
[4:46] headphones on I was I was chewing
[4:48] tobacco so I was still a I was a
[4:50] Christian but not a Sanctified one I was
[4:52] playing video games you know I was
[4:53] wasting my time playing video games and
[4:55] as I'm playing the video games I hear
[4:57] Brother Braham tell his life story and I
[4:58] just start crying
[5:00] I'm like I I've never heard a man preach
[5:01] like this I just had to turn off the
[5:03] video games and just listen to brother
[5:05] brandom eventually God delivered me from
[5:07] my tobacco addiction I'm thankful for
[5:09] that I've been uh many years free from
[5:11] that now by God's grace but just the
[5:13] power of the holy spirit in brother
[5:15] bram's voice and in his ministry was
[5:18] enough to shake me from my bad habits my
[5:21] worldly habits and direct me to one
[5:23] thing the word of God hallelujah how
[5:25] many feel that way today you're thankful
[5:26] for God's Prophet Hallelujah to direct
[5:29] you to the word of God Amen glad to hear
[5:32] that by the grace of the
[5:34] Lord so uh we'll take a few uh minutes
[5:38] here and uh look to the word of God I
[5:40] want to get my uh notes here kind of
[5:43] settled
[5:44] here so the Bible says in the days of
[5:47] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[5:48] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[5:50] should be finished as he has declared to
[5:53] his servants the prophets now I'm
[5:55] recording this I know brother Iran likes
[5:56] to record them too um I I found you know
[6:00] as a young believer now I'm not so young
[6:02] anymore believer I first heard the
[6:04] message at the end of
[6:06] 2001 so it's been about 23 years I've
[6:09] been in this
[6:10] message and uh I've been preaching it
[6:13] since 2004 so I just pass 20 years of
[6:17] preaching um but I found that it's good
[6:20] to record Ser services and go back and
[6:22] listen to them like our brother said you
[6:25] know it's like that there's so much
[6:26] Revelation I can't hardly contain it
[6:28] right
[6:30] uh it's such a load of Revelation
[6:31] brother brand called it a tape full of
[6:34] Revelation a tape load of spiritual food
[6:37] and due season
[6:39] Hallelujah and uh so if you if you do
[6:42] that I know God will reveal even more to
[6:44] you and you know the the purpose of this
[6:46] friends and and family of God the
[6:49] purpose of this the purpose of
[6:51] Revelation is what Jesus said in Matthew
[6:52] 16 that the Gates of Hell could not
[6:55] overcome us right when God Reveals His
[6:58] word to us uh then his will is made
[7:01] known to us and then that that
[7:04] Revelation is so clear to us that in the
[7:07] times of
[7:09] testing the Revelation that God showed
[7:12] to us is going to help us overcome amen
[7:15] hallelujah because again that Revelation
[7:18] is written on our
[7:20] hearts and then in that moment of test
[7:22] you know we we have two choices
[7:24] presented before us the way of
[7:25] transgression the way of righteousness
[7:28] and brother B said when it all boils
[7:29] down to it he said that anchor will hold
[7:32] in the midst of the storm so when we're
[7:34] going through tests and trials the
[7:35] anchor will hold us praise God and that
[7:38] anchor is the anchor into the word of
[7:40] God the Rock of Ages right that's what
[7:42] we've heard you know an anchor in a ship
[7:44] wants to it wants to catch on a rock
[7:47] hallelujah and that's what happens when
[7:49] we go through stormy trials the anchor
[7:51] in our soul it's founded on a rock and
[7:54] Jesus said you must build your house on
[7:56] a rock hallelujah your life must be
[7:58] founded upon the rock of Revelation amen
[8:04] glory so our verse here is the seventh
[8:08] angel now notice what happens when he
[8:10] begins to sound the mystery of God would
[8:14] be finished as he has declared to his
[8:16] servants the
[8:18] prophets so this ministry of brother
[8:21] brandham was to finish the mystery of
[8:23] God and brother brandom called it all
[8:25] the Loose Ends how many know that
[8:27] brother Bram said that all the loose end
[8:29] end this is what he said in is this a
[8:31] sign of the end sir brother Ram said but
[8:33] it is the seventh angel that had this
[8:35] type of message what was it notice his
[8:38] type of message finishing all the
[8:40] mysteries of God that are written in the
[8:42] book The Holy
[8:44] Bible the seventh angel is winding up
[8:47] all the Mysteries that's laying loose
[8:49] ended all throughout these organizations
[8:52] and denominations the seventh angel
[8:55] gathers them up and finishes the entire
[8:58] mystery that's what the Bible said
[9:01] finishes The Mystery of the written book
[9:04] Hallelujah so all all these
[9:06] denominations have some truth in
[9:09] them right we know the you know if you
[9:11] just go by history brother Ram says in
[9:13] the church age book you know the Sardis
[9:15] Church age that Martin Luther was was
[9:17] the beginning of the re Reformation
[9:19] right and he brought out that great
[9:20] Revelation the just shall live by faith
[9:23] we're not saved by works we're saved by
[9:25] grace and brother Ram said if I have to
[9:28] do anything to be saved then Jesus
[9:31] Christ died in
[9:33] vain Hallelujah is that a that a
[9:36] beautiful statement if you and I have to
[9:38] do anything to be saved then Jesus
[9:40] wasn't good enough for God amen amen
[9:44] right but if but if if we've been given
[9:47] a perfect sacrifice then we have perfect
[9:49] forgiveness amen hallelujah like the
[9:52] Bible says all all we have to do is
[9:54] repent of our sins that's all we have to
[9:56] do is repent
[9:57] believe Hallelujah and the rest of our
[10:00] life is just a dedication of it's our
[10:02] own Living
[10:04] Sacrifice Hallelujah that's what Revel
[10:07] Romans 12 says Paul said we must present
[10:09] our bodies as a Living Sacrifice that's
[10:12] our reasonable service once once once we
[10:15] accept Jesus's sacrifice for our sins
[10:17] we're saved we're on our way to heaven
[10:20] hallelujah our name's on the book of
[10:22] life amen now we believe a greater
[10:24] Revelation our names on the Lamb's Book
[10:25] of Life hallelujah amen I'm just talking
[10:27] about just being saved sure right the
[10:30] three works of Grace you got to be saved
[10:32] Sanctified and then filled with the Holy
[10:34] Ghost amen and Luther brought brought
[10:36] out the great revelation of
[10:38] justification you're saved by grace
[10:40] through faith Hallelujah as Ephesians 2
[10:43] 8-10 says amen so it's no it's it's no
[10:47] work that youed to be saved Jesus Paid
[10:49] It all all to him I owe sin had left a
[10:53] Crimson Stain but Jesus washed it white
[10:55] as snow amen oh my thank God Hallelujah
[10:59] for the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[11:02] and then you know so the the Lutheran
[11:04] Church has
[11:05] Revelation the Revelation is
[11:08] justification right but then uh John
[11:11] Wesley brought out the the revelation of
[11:13] the methods the Methodist the methods of
[11:16] living a dedicated
[11:17] life he believed you could dedicate your
[11:20] entire life and your entire life would
[11:22] be set up apart for God Hallelujah in
[11:26] other words we we we could we could uh
[11:28] grow in Grace and knowledge of the lord
[11:30] we could live a more holy life
[11:32] Hallelujah and he was right we could and
[11:36] he developed methods or habits and uh
[11:39] ways to to live a more Godly life and
[11:42] and brother Braham calls that the Bible
[11:43] calls it sanctification praise God I
[11:46] don't know if you saw it this week but
[11:48] it's really sad you know um the majority
[11:51] of United Methodist churches now lifted
[11:53] the ban on homosexual clergy yeah so now
[11:57] it's okay in Methodist churches for
[11:59] homosexuals to preach from their pulpits
[12:02] that would anger John Wesley if he was
[12:04] alive today amen because it's an
[12:07] Abomination he preached against it
[12:09] Martin Luther preached against
[12:11] it now what was interesting was a fourth
[12:14] of the Methodist churches have left
[12:16] their denomination so thank God for that
[12:18] forth they got enough Revelation to to
[12:21] leave based upon
[12:23] that but that this is a great Revelation
[12:25] justification you must be Sanctified and
[12:28] then you know through uh through Aus
[12:31] stre in 1906 they taught you had to have
[12:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost now they
[12:35] were right in one way but they were
[12:37] wrong in another way you know at the
[12:39] beginning in 1906 they said you had to
[12:41] speak in tongues now just so you know by
[12:44] the end of that movement William Seymour
[12:46] he was the man that God used to start it
[12:49] and he was praying six to eight hours a
[12:51] day before the Holy Ghost fell and
[12:52] started that Revival I just want to tell
[12:54] you what a godly man he was brother
[12:55] Brandon honor of that man William
[12:57] Seymour he was blinded in one eye
[12:59] but God used him in a mighty way brother
[13:02] Bram said 1906 Revival Inus stre was the
[13:05] greatest Revival since the day of
[13:06] Pentecost and the church
[13:09] said now at the beginning they believ
[13:11] tongues were the evidence but by the end
[13:12] they'd have all these they had all these
[13:14] tests and trials by the end he realized
[13:17] it's not the tongues that are the
[13:18] evidence it's a Christ centered life
[13:21] that's the evidence amen
[13:23] hallelujah and then brother brandom
[13:25] comes and he says that's the same thing
[13:27] the evidence is uh living recognizing
[13:30] the day your day and it's message
[13:31] recognizing the message of the hour and
[13:33] of course that means living all the word
[13:35] of
[13:36] God because we all know I know you might
[13:38] not but I know a lot of people that have
[13:40] spoken tongues that don't serve God
[13:42] anymore well that that's impossible if
[13:45] if tongues is the evidence then uh then
[13:48] anyone that spoke in tongues would
[13:49] always serve God
[13:51] Faithfully they would not transgress
[13:53] they wouldn't leave the way of Salvation
[13:55] right they wouldn't leave the way of
[13:56] righteousness so just in those examp ex
[13:59] that proves tongues are not the evidence
[14:02] and Paul said do all speak with tongues
[14:04] in 2 Corinthians 12:31 I believe it is
[14:07] is it if I'm not mistaken you know
[14:09] tongues cannot be evidence it's a gift
[14:11] but brother R tells us we can't seek the
[14:13] gift we got to seek The Giver of the
[14:15] gifts hallelujah amen that's what we
[14:18] need Hallelujah that's what we're
[14:19] seeking and if you've been born again
[14:21] then you just want more of God
[14:22] hallelujah but if you haven't been born
[14:24] again you must seek the Holy Ghost you
[14:27] must you must seek The Giver of the gift
[14:29] Hallelujah a personal experience with
[14:31] Christ Hallelujah where you know
[14:33] Christ's power entered into your life
[14:36] amen hallelujah that's what we all must
[14:38] seek for by God's grace you must be born
[14:41] again as Jesus said Hallelujah if you
[14:43] want the kingdom of God in you you must
[14:44] be born again
[14:46] Hallelujah but now getting back to this
[14:49] thought brother BR says the seventh
[14:51] angel winds up all the Mysteries that
[14:53] are laying loose
[14:54] here and so we have justification we
[14:58] have sanctification and we have the
[15:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'll say
[15:01] like this we have the gifts in the right
[15:03] place too that's what we're that's what
[15:05] you're learning that's what we're
[15:06] learning tongues can be a part of it but
[15:09] tongues have to obey the rest of the
[15:11] Bible
[15:12] commands praise the
[15:14] Lord
[15:16] amen and uh we we we take all these all
[15:19] the Bible must be tied together praise
[15:23] God brother Ram's Ministry was to finish
[15:26] the mystery of God any anything that was
[15:28] a Myster in the word of God that was
[15:30] called a mystery it should be explained
[15:32] today it should be revealed today I want
[15:35] to tell you it is by God's grace
[15:38] Hallelujah absolutely thank you Lord now
[15:41] after you notice you know I want to just
[15:43] point
[15:45] out uh Revelation 10 ver1 the mighty
[15:48] Angel comes down and he's clothed with a
[15:50] cloud the rainbow is on his head his
[15:53] face as it were the Sun and his feet as
[15:55] pillars of fire brother Ram tells us
[15:57] this is Christ
[15:59] Christ comes down in a theophany or a
[16:02] spiritual body or Christ comes down in a
[16:05] Angelic form which is a theophany body
[16:09] Hallelujah and he has that little book
[16:11] open in his hand and brother Ram tells
[16:13] us that was the Revelation the book that
[16:15] was in heaven Jesus Took the book he
[16:18] broke the seals and he comes down and he
[16:20] has a open book like all you got your
[16:22] open Bibles right now I love that amen
[16:24] that's what Jesus brought down an open
[16:26] book and brother Ram tells us that was
[16:29] the revelation of the Seven Seals and I
[16:32] preach it here to you by God's grace so
[16:33] we got the tape on that if you want to
[16:35] listen to that
[16:37] again and when he when he uttered when
[16:40] he come down he cried as when a lion
[16:42] Roth and seven Thunders utter their
[16:44] voices brother Ram plainly says two or
[16:47] three times he says the voices of the
[16:49] Thunders were the revelations of the
[16:52] Seven
[16:53] Seals so when brother random preached
[16:55] that first seal that was the Thunder
[16:57] that was the voice of God telling us
[16:59] what the first seal
[17:00] meant and then when he preached the
[17:02] second seal the next night in March of
[17:04] 1963 that was the second Thunder and
[17:07] then the third Thunder was the third
[17:09] seal and the fourth Thunder was the
[17:10] fourth seal how many remember that a
[17:11] little bit anybody got a little been a
[17:13] while I know that's been a while I think
[17:14] it was last summer you got a good memory
[17:17] if you remember some of that by God's
[17:18] grace then the fourth seal was the
[17:20] fourth Thunder the fifth Thunder sixth
[17:21] Thunder seventh
[17:23] Thunder and then that is what and and
[17:26] and then that's what we we come to you
[17:28] know John's not allowed to write those
[17:30] Revelations because they had to be
[17:32] revealed in the days of the seventh
[17:34] angel Hallelujah and once that was
[17:37] revealed verse 8 says John takes the
[17:41] book and he o and he has to eat it in
[17:45] verse n the angel says give me the
[17:46] little book take it and eat it up and it
[17:49] shall make thy belly bitter and thy
[17:51] mouth sweet as honey this is the same
[17:53] thing God told
[17:54] Ezekiel God revealed to Ezekiel all
[17:56] these things about the four beasts in
[17:58] heaven Ezekiel chapter 1 and 2 and God
[18:00] told Ezekiel eat the book so you can
[18:02] prophesy again hallelujah amen and the
[18:05] same thing repeats here at the end God
[18:07] gives an open book to a prophet
[18:09] hallelujah amen hallelujah and he he
[18:11] sounds the mystery of God and now it's
[18:14] us it's it's John John is the type of
[18:16] the Bride Hallelujah the eagle anointing
[18:18] amen the eagle Age The Prophet age
[18:21] Hallelujah and John is the type of us
[18:23] we're supposed to eat the
[18:25] book it's bitter in our bellies it's
[18:28] it's hard to live sometimes it's hard to
[18:30] face rejection sometimes but we're
[18:33] praying Hallelujah you keep praying
[18:34] Hallelujah we we've we've had some great
[18:37] victories but we had some great
[18:38] rejections as well right it's it's like
[18:41] brother Howard said it's it's so
[18:43] wonderful it just flows off your lips
[18:45] this is like honey oh the Bible's
[18:47] restored we know Jesus Christ God sent
[18:49] us a prophet we know the right water
[18:50] baptism we know God's one person we know
[18:53] women should dress modestly and men
[18:55] should dress modestly and women
[18:56] shouldn't cut their hair and only men
[18:58] should preach the gospel and the Roman
[19:00] Catholic Church is the mother heart all
[19:01] these things flow off so
[19:03] easily but when it comes down to living
[19:06] it and standing for that it can be
[19:08] bitter in our stomachs praise God it's
[19:10] hard to face the rejection I'll say like
[19:13] this it takes a real battle to live all
[19:15] the word of God that we've
[19:17] heard
[19:19] amen because Satan is going to be
[19:21] battling on every side but that's okay
[19:23] God told us it was going to happen Peter
[19:25] said he's he Satan's going to come like
[19:27] like a roaring line he's not a roaring
[19:29] lion there's only one roaring lion
[19:31] Hallelujah that's Jesus amen hallelujah
[19:33] so nothing to fear Satan's just an imp
[19:36] personator brother he's just a bluff
[19:39] just stay with the word of God he's just
[19:41] trying to scare us he's just trying to
[19:43] shake us but the Bible said our kingdom
[19:46] cannot be shaken hallelujah amen Hebrews
[19:49] chapter 12 we have a kingdom which
[19:51] cannot be moved
[19:53] Hallelujah so we stand with the true
[19:56] line of the tribe of Judah the Lord
[19:58] Jesus Christ amen and then in verse 10
[20:01] it says I took the little book out of
[20:03] the Angel's hand ate it up and was in my
[20:06] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[20:07] had eaten it my belly was bitter he said
[20:10] to me thou must prophesy again before
[20:11] many peoples Nations and tongues and
[20:15] kings and so this is something John did
[20:18] not do right so we know this this must
[20:22] be for someone else how is John GNA go
[20:25] prophesy again before many peoples
[20:27] Nations tongues and kings he wasn't he
[20:29] died of old age so e God wouldn't lie
[20:33] God wouldn't tell something wrong so
[20:35] this has to has a have to have a
[20:37] spiritual
[20:38] meaning God has to use someone else to
[20:40] do this praise the
[20:43] Lord now that's fitting to God did you
[20:45] know God did that before go to First
[20:48] Kings
[20:49] 19:15 God did this before
[21:08] First Kings
[21:14] 19:15 sister Ruth do you want to read
[21:16] verse 15 for us have you
[21:18] okay First Kings 19 yes First Kings
[21:22] 19:15 and the Lord said unto him go
[21:25] return on way to the Wilderness of
[21:28] [Music]
[21:31] anoint to be king
[21:34] over thank you now if you reading the
[21:37] scripture we're not going to take the
[21:38] time to do this because I just want to
[21:39] get to this point
[21:41] here God told Elijah now this is when
[21:43] Elijah is hiding in the cave brother
[21:46] Braham said that anointing left him
[21:48] that's why he was hiding in the cave
[21:50] just a few days before that he was he
[21:52] was so empowered he saw the fire come
[21:54] down from heaven consume the sacrifice
[21:56] he slayed 450 B
[21:59] prophets and that a powerful anointing
[22:01] left him all that boldness left him
[22:03] Jezebel said I'm going to kill you he
[22:04] ran from one woman brother said he just
[22:06] killed 450 prophets but then he runs
[22:08] from one
[22:09] woman because that powerful an that
[22:11] boldness of the Holy Spirit sometimes it
[22:13] leaves us right because we got to go
[22:15] through
[22:15] trials and then Elijah said God I'm the
[22:18] only one left just let me die God said I
[22:20] got 7,000 that haven't bowed their
[22:23] knees you don't want to die I'm going to
[22:25] take you home in a Rapture don't die
[22:27] amen you don't have to die Amen
[22:30] Hallelujah by God's grace there's going
[22:32] to be a generation that doesn't have to
[22:34] die Hallelujah it could be us amen
[22:39] hallelujah but if you read the Bible
[22:42] Second Kings we're not going to go there
[22:43] but just just hold your place in First
[22:45] Kings 19 but in 2 Kings 813 through1 15
[22:49] it was Elisha that anointed haziel now
[22:52] think about that God told Elijah you're
[22:54] going to anoint haziel but then he
[22:56] doesn't do it Elisha does it
[22:59] now is God a liar no we would never
[23:02] blashe and say that but what does this
[23:04] show God H God hides the truth from the
[23:08] wise and prudent and reveals it unto
[23:10] babes such as would
[23:12] learn right God told Elijah you're going
[23:16] to do it but what he means is I'm going
[23:17] to have somebody with the same Spirit do
[23:19] it because I'm taking you home now that
[23:22] perfectly applies to Revelation 10 don't
[23:24] don't lose that thought you and I are
[23:27] the ones that are supposed to take the
[23:28] message to every Kindred tongue nation
[23:30] and people hallelujah in other words now
[23:33] it's your job to take it to the rest of
[23:34] the Amish who God is predestinated to
[23:37] receive it praise God I was ordained to
[23:40] take it to akan amen you're ordained to
[23:42] take it to your families your friends
[23:44] the people in your area praise God I
[23:47] think you guys told me one time there's
[23:48] over 300,000 Amish communities or I
[23:50] looked it up online and most of them
[23:52] haven't heard the message well guess
[23:53] what now that's your job to fill
[23:55] Revelation 10:11 Hallelujah amen how
[23:59] many how many believe they deserve a
[24:00] chance to hear the message somebody's
[24:02] got to somebody's got to tell them
[24:06] Hallelujah just like you got a chance to
[24:08] hear it God wants them to have a chance
[24:10] to hear it too in fact that's what Jesus
[24:13] said he said uh the kingdom of God must
[24:17] be preached to Every Nation Kindred
[24:19] people tongue and then the end will come
[24:22] the tribulation won't come the Rapture
[24:24] won't come until every group has heard
[24:27] this message that We Believe
[24:29] Hallelujah that's why you know next year
[24:31] is 60 years since brother man went off
[24:32] the scene that's a small amount of time
[24:35] in the eyes of
[24:36] God remember a thousand years is like
[24:39] one day with God it's only been two days
[24:41] since Jesus rose from the dead in God's
[24:43] eyes two days what was two days ago
[24:45] Sunday Friday what' you do Friday you
[24:47] probably can't remember what you did
[24:47] Friday I can't remember I went to work
[24:49] that's about all I did but in God's mind
[24:52] it was just two days ago in other words
[24:54] God is very patient he's outside of time
[24:57] and he's going to some people to share
[25:00] this message because it's scriptural
[25:02] it's got to be shared with those who
[25:04] haven't heard it praise God and then all
[25:07] the elect will come in but notice the
[25:08] point I want to make is God told Elijah
[25:11] to do it he didn't do it it was Elisha
[25:14] that did
[25:15] it so in other words this shows God can
[25:18] interpret his word any way he
[25:21] wants hallelujah amen Lord now uh Sister
[25:27] Sarah could you read verse 16 starts
[25:29] with and
[25:30] J it's in First Kings
[25:34] 19:16 and
[25:36] [Music]
[25:46] [Music]
[25:47] the wonderful thank you now ju was
[25:51] anointed by a son of a prophet in 2
[25:54] Kings
[25:55] 91-113 it wasn't even Elisha
[25:59] it was a son of one of the prophets we
[26:02] don't even have his
[26:04] name so see God told Elijah you're going
[26:06] to do this but he himself didn't do it
[26:09] what he meant was the furtherance of the
[26:11] ministry hallelujah amen the furtherance
[26:14] of the ministry under the Same Spirit
[26:16] the holy spirit so that's why you and I
[26:19] can see ourselves in Revelation 10
[26:21] Hallelujah brother brandom finished the
[26:23] mystery of God but now we must eat it
[26:25] and we must go take it to everyone that
[26:27] we can Hallelujah
[26:30] and as you know the internet does a good
[26:31] job of taking the
[26:34] message you know uh some preachers can't
[26:36] get into certain Muslim countries but
[26:38] Jesus uses using the internet or or
[26:41] either that or he'll show himself to
[26:42] them in dreams or visions I think I told
[26:45] you this story but I was in South
[26:46] America I preached uh there four
[26:49] times and a brother told me he was a
[26:51] brother he'd stand at the door and he
[26:53] would slap the wall I'm not going to
[26:54] slap these walls but when when the Holy
[26:56] Spirit was started moving he'd slap the
[26:58] the walls and when we're preaching he
[26:59] say that's solid brother that's solid he
[27:01] say bam bam bam bam bam that's solid
[27:03] everybody was you know getting all
[27:04] stirred up and everything and I was
[27:07] always wondering why would that brother
[27:08] be so stirred up and then I heard his
[27:10] testimony he was a
[27:13] Muslim never believed in Jesus brother
[27:16] Howard he was sitting in his he said the
[27:18] living room he was drunk and high
[27:20] smoking weed watching dirty movies I
[27:22] don't even know what kind of movies they
[27:24] were probably filthy he said all of a
[27:26] sudden he felt a holy presence on his
[27:28] left side he said he looked over there
[27:31] there was Jesus Christ shining in white
[27:34] he said he instantly fell to his knees
[27:37] and he was instantly
[27:39] sober and he wept his way to
[27:42] Calvary
[27:44] Hallelujah see if preachers can't get in
[27:47] one thing I tell you you can't stop
[27:48] Jesus from getting in you might stop a
[27:50] preacher amen but you ain't going to
[27:52] stop the Holy Ghost
[27:53] Hallelujah all the elect seed shall be
[27:57] harvested
[27:59] Hallelujah Jesus said all that the
[28:01] father has given me will come and I
[28:03] shall not lose one hallelujah
[28:06] amen and so then all he knows is Jesus
[28:09] is his savior he's repented he's got to
[28:11] leave the Muslim faith and so he goes to
[28:13] the nearest church it was a message
[28:15] church then he found his wife there they
[28:17] had a beautiful little family this is
[28:19] about uh now it's probably 11 years ago
[28:22] by God's grace maybe 12 I wonder what
[28:24] how their fam are I'm sure they're doing
[28:26] good by God's grace I have to asked
[28:27] brother Maxwell they're doing but see
[28:30] this this message has got to be preached
[28:32] to Every Nation if we believe the
[28:35] mystery of God is finished then we've
[28:37] got to share it praise God
[28:40] hallelujah now the only one now those
[28:43] thank you sisters you read three men's
[28:45] names right Azel juu and Elisha the only
[28:49] one that Elijah anointed was
[28:53] Elisha and that was in uh 2 Kings 9 15 a
[28:58] double portion came on Elisha and that
[29:01] meant he did double the Miracles how
[29:03] many know that Elisha did eight I'm
[29:06] sorry Elijah did eight
[29:09] Miracles Elisha did 16 Miracles how many
[29:13] know that so if you're if you ask God
[29:15] for a double portion that means I'm
[29:17] going to get double the work done and
[29:19] the church said
[29:21] amen you really pray that say God give
[29:23] me a double portion and you want to do
[29:26] double the work
[29:28] right
[29:29] Hallelujah now I hear people say it all
[29:31] the time give me a double portion they
[29:33] don't even know what they're talking
[29:34] about right if you're asking for a
[29:37] double portion if I'm asking for a
[29:38] double portion then I going to win twice
[29:40] as many souls or I'm going to baptize
[29:42] twice as many people or I want to preach
[29:45] twice as many
[29:46] sermons
[29:48] right that's what the double portion
[29:50] means you do double the
[29:52] work you do double the works for God
[29:55] Almighty so next time let's think and
[29:57] pray before we ask God for a double
[29:59] portion because you got to know what
[30:01] you're asking for and like our brother
[30:03] said then we got to be willing to
[30:04] sacrifice more the more we do for God
[30:08] means the more we sacrifice of our
[30:10] natural lives means less farming more
[30:13] studying preaching testifying right
[30:16] brother that's what God's doing in his
[30:17] life amen
[30:19] hallelujah that's
[30:22] right so now I I want to just lay that
[30:25] out because that's important for you to
[30:27] see you and I are in Revelation
[30:31] 10 brother brandham said Revelation 10:7
[30:35] is history everybody say history ready
[30:37] history history brother Braham says it
[30:39] he said it and what is the attraction on
[30:41] the mountain 1965 you want to look it
[30:44] up he said That's History just a few
[30:46] months before he died in other words he
[30:49] knew God used him to tie all these
[30:52] Revelations together the gifts of the
[30:54] Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy
[30:55] Ghost oh my a justification
[30:58] sanctification the three works of Grace
[31:00] all the mysteries of God the Rapture I
[31:02] mean you just name it all these
[31:04] Revelations he tied them up he gave the
[31:06] right Revelation he said That's History
[31:09] right hallelujah amen he said in my
[31:12] ministry that's history so see church we
[31:14] are living in the days when the Bible's
[31:17] being fulfilled right we are right we
[31:20] are living in these days they're
[31:21] exciting days amen amen they're awful
[31:24] for the world but they're exciting to us
[31:26] hallelujah for those who we're in Christ
[31:30] Jesus so I hope you can see that now our
[31:32] responsibility as the bride type we're
[31:34] under the eagle anointing remember
[31:36] brother Ram said that's thus sayith the
[31:38] Lord remember that it was in the fifth
[31:40] seal brother Ram said those teachings on
[31:43] the four Beast remember there's four
[31:45] beasts around the throne let's read that
[31:46] Revelation chapter
[31:52] 4 I'll get the verse there I'm just
[31:55] revelation 4:7 there's four beasts
[31:58] they're called cherubims they're called
[32:00] beasts the first Beast was like a lion
[32:03] brother Ram said that was the boldness
[32:05] of the early
[32:06] church they were as bold as
[32:09] lions right one night remember in Acts
[32:12] chapter 3 they'd be arrested the next
[32:14] day they're bold as lions they're right
[32:15] back out in the public preaching not
[32:16] afraid to go to jail now how many people
[32:19] you know got that kind of
[32:21] boldness there's a few but that
[32:23] anointing was on all of them that was a
[32:26] lion anointing
[32:28] the boldness the power of the original
[32:31] Apostles the Bible said God gave them
[32:33] Great Signs wonders and miracles
[32:36] Hallelujah and the second beast was like
[32:39] a calf brother random said that was the
[32:41] anointing of sacrifice where the
[32:43] Christians freely gave themselves as
[32:46] Martyrs
[32:47] Hallelujah and if you if you haven't
[32:50] read this read the church age book it'll
[32:51] give you a great understanding on this
[32:53] and listen to the seven seal sermons and
[32:56] brother said what else could they do
[32:58] he said what else could they do but just
[33:00] give their lives freely because that's
[33:02] the anointing that they lived
[33:04] under you know like a sister like our
[33:06] sisters you can only live under the
[33:07] anointing for a sister you can't be a
[33:09] man you don't want to be a man God made
[33:11] you a woman right and brothers you can
[33:14] only live under anointing of a
[33:16] man and that's how it is with the
[33:18] Christians we can only live under the
[33:20] anointing that God's given us praise God
[33:23] God didn't give us the lon anointing uh
[33:25] the calf anointing the next one is a
[33:27] face as a man brother R said this was
[33:30] the wisdom of men like Martin Luther and
[33:32] John Wesley and uh George Whitfield and
[33:34] all these uh mighty intelligent Men He
[33:37] names them in the church age book as
[33:38] well uh Albert
[33:41] Barnes uh there's some so many other
[33:43] names like they're not coming to right
[33:45] now but he said they wrote the most
[33:47] books about God they preached the
[33:48] greatest sermons that was ever preached
[33:50] because they had the wisdom of
[33:52] man brother BR said Martin Luther had
[33:54] the wisdom to know that wafer that wafer
[33:57] of bre that the Catholics hold up that's
[33:59] not the body of Christ brother raham
[34:01] said that that cup of wine that's not
[34:03] the blood of Christ he said the wisdom
[34:05] of God gave him that praise God
[34:07] Hallelujah the wisdom of
[34:10] God but now Church we're the fourth
[34:13] Beast was like a flying eagle and we're
[34:16] under the eagle
[34:18] anointing how many know the Bible said
[34:20] that God said I'll carry Israel out of
[34:23] Egypt on eagles's wings how many
[34:24] remember that verse how did he carry him
[34:27] out On Eagle's Wings one was Moses one
[34:29] was
[34:30] Aaron Hallelujah I'll carry out on Eagle
[34:34] wings that's what the Bible said God
[34:36] delivered by Mo prophet and Aaron priest
[34:40] prophet and priesthood prophet and
[34:42] Ministry
[34:43] Hallelujah that's what we're carried out
[34:45] on brother Rams as a prophet and the
[34:47] ministry the fivefold ministry praise
[34:49] God carries us out didn't you know Aaron
[34:51] had four Sons Aaron plus his four Sons
[34:54] five five full
[34:55] ministry anybody know that
[34:58] yeah now remember two of them died
[35:00] because they tried to transgress but it
[35:03] was a type at the beginning it was a
[35:04] type you have Aaron and then his four
[35:06] sons and you have the prophet guiding
[35:08] them
[35:09] too that's what we have brother random
[35:11] and the fivefold ministry that what
[35:12] that's what leads
[35:14] us and don't forget church uh we're
[35:17] under five blessings from the five full
[35:20] Ministries so go back to Ephesians four
[35:21] I want to pull this out by God's
[35:26] grace because because you all here are
[35:29] led by the Holy Ghost you accept the
[35:31] fightful ministry remember there's
[35:32] churches that don't they say press play
[35:35] and Obey that's a
[35:37] lie brother Ram never told us to just
[35:40] press play and Obey and not have living
[35:41] preachers so you're under the right
[35:43] anointing today
[35:44] Hallelujah stay under that anointing
[35:47] there's a big deception in the land with
[35:49] brother Ram's family members trying to
[35:51] get everybody to shut down the preachers
[35:52] that's a lie from Hell brother Ram never
[35:56] said to do that the Bible never says
[35:58] that's the main thing the Bible never
[36:00] says to do
[36:01] that Hallelujah and I've called all the
[36:04] ones that will contact me I've sent them
[36:06] letters I sent them videos I've sent
[36:07] videos to brium Tabernacle books to Brom
[36:10] Tabernacle and they have no answers all
[36:13] they can do is a few quotes that they're
[36:15] misrepresenting they don't have any
[36:16] Bible to support their their
[36:18] teachings they try to twist some
[36:20] scriptures but it goes against
[36:22] everything the prophet of God taught now
[36:25] verse 11 and he gave some apostles those
[36:27] are missionaries and some prophets those
[36:31] those are revealers of Secrets and those
[36:33] who prophesy like brother brandom and
[36:34] some evangelist evangelists uh just go
[36:36] around from church to church and they uh
[36:39] they they s the people up and set them
[36:41] on fire and do Supernatural signs
[36:44] wonders and miracles pastors are of
[36:46] course Shepherds they stay home with the
[36:48] the Sheep most of the time and then
[36:50] there's teachers teachers can take you
[36:52] deeper in the word of God and give you
[36:54] instruction on the word of God how to do
[36:56] this how to do that how to understand
[36:58] that how to do that now what does this
[37:01] do church this perfects verse 12
[37:03] perfects the Saints which is equipping
[37:05] you in other words when you feed on the
[37:08] fivefold ministry you'll have the tools
[37:10] you need to live a Christian life I've
[37:13] seen it for all these years Brother
[37:15] anytime I need something brother irin
[37:17] God will send anytime I'm in a struggle
[37:18] God will send a preacher in at the right
[37:20] time Hallelujah and that'll be just
[37:23] exactly what we need to hear I've heard
[37:24] it countless times in my in my 18 years
[37:27] as past I've so many times people come
[37:31] up and say wow brother Jesse thanks for
[37:32] having that preacher that was just what
[37:34] I need to hear or somebody send me a
[37:35] text say that was just what I was
[37:37] wondering about that was just what I
[37:38] needed to
[37:39] hear that's what God promised hallelujah
[37:42] amen it perfects the Saints it equips
[37:45] you it works the ministry right it gives
[37:47] it labor it helps it the ministry to
[37:50] keep going edify third edifies is the
[37:53] body of Christ that means to build you
[37:55] up how many you want to be stronger when
[37:56] you leave this place
[37:58] that's what the Holy Ghost will do
[37:59] through right preachers Hallelujah the
[38:01] right kind of preachers will make you
[38:03] stronger because they're pointing you to
[38:04] the word of God
[38:08] hallelujah and then verse 13 till we all
[38:11] come in the unity of the
[38:13] faith see we'll be unified on the major
[38:17] doctrines brother R says there's majors
[38:19] and minors that's
[38:21] true brother R said in I forget the
[38:24] sermon maybe it'll come to me while I'm
[38:26] preaching
[38:27] brother said there was a man that said
[38:29] uh brother BR I differ with you he said
[38:31] I believe Jesus is coming back on the
[38:33] White
[38:33] Cloud and brother Ram said another man
[38:36] said I believe he's coming on a white
[38:38] horse and brother R said that's fine
[38:40] whether he's coming on a white cloud or
[38:41] a white horse he said that's a minor
[38:44] thing as long as we believe he's coming
[38:46] hallelujah amen hallelujah he said but
[38:50] the major thing is salvation getting
[38:53] people saved helping them to miss hell
[38:55] Hallelujah he said that's the the major
[38:57] we can't miss
[38:59] that and brother Bram said I'm not
[39:01] trusting in my merits to go to heaven
[39:04] brother Bram said I'm not trusting in
[39:06] the merits because I'm a Pentecostal
[39:08] preacher I'm going to heaven he said I
[39:11] have no merits that I can trust in to go
[39:13] to heaven the only merits I have is the
[39:15] merits of Jesus Christ Hallelujah am
[39:19] Glory now I know all of you most of you
[39:22] came out of churches that they made your
[39:24] merits a thick book outside the Bible
[39:26] that was your Merit
[39:28] and they said if you broke any of these
[39:30] you're lost and going to hell that's a
[39:32] lie that's a
[39:34] lie I'm going to say one more time
[39:36] that's a lie Hallelujah you're saved by
[39:39] the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[39:41] you're not saved by works or else then
[39:43] you can brag in heaven you're saved by
[39:46] grace through faith it is the gift of
[39:48] God
[39:50] hallelujah so see brother Irvin as you
[39:52] as you'll see too and I'm sure as you've
[39:53] heard with different preachers well
[39:55] brother Jeff might preach a little
[39:56] different than brother Jesse
[39:57] brother Jesse might have been preached
[39:59] different than brother Simon and we're
[40:02] brothers but on on the on all of them I
[40:05] believe this they're just
[40:07] minors the majors we all agree on what
[40:11] am I talking about the Holy Ghost is
[40:13] bringing us to a Unity of the faith
[40:15] Hallelujah am that's
[40:18] right I and my wife and I talk about
[40:21] this we all talk about it at our church
[40:22] too you know as we go along we just see
[40:26] we see what looks like more differences
[40:28] with other message churches but that
[40:30] that's only when we stop looking at all
[40:32] the similarities that we have right
[40:34] absolutely we all believe in modesty we
[40:36] all believe in the baptism of the Holy
[40:37] Ghost salvation we all believe in the
[40:39] operation of gifts right we all believe
[40:42] brother R was a prophet and the Seven SE
[40:44] we all believe on the church ages we
[40:47] have so many things that are in common
[40:49] we got to be careful the devil wants to
[40:51] try to get in there and makes roots of
[40:53] bitterness among
[40:54] us we've got to stop Satan at that
[40:58] we can't let Satan create roots of
[41:00] bitterness Among
[41:03] Us now here's how you know go to uh wait
[41:06] did I finish this no I didn't finish
[41:07] this then we'll go to 1 Timothy 2 but
[41:09] till we all come in the unity of Faith
[41:10] so that's what I see I've been in the
[41:11] message what I say 23 23
[41:14] years that's what I see the more I'm in
[41:17] it the more unified I am with other
[41:19] believers that believe the same
[41:21] thing Hallelujah that's what you'll see
[41:23] as
[41:24] well and of the knowledge of the son of
[41:27] God unto a perfect that means a mature
[41:29] man it doesn't mean you're going to get
[41:31] to a spot where you never sinned brother
[41:32] Ram said you'll fight against the devil
[41:34] all the days of your life right you
[41:37] won't the only time you get a victory is
[41:38] when you get a brand new body
[41:40] Hallelujah unto the measure of the
[41:42] stature of Christ and then verse 14 that
[41:45] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[41:48] to and fro carried about with every wind
[41:50] of Doctrine by the slight of man and the
[41:54] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[41:56] wait to deceive now think about that
[41:57] most churches are filled with preachers
[41:59] that are trying to deceive people and
[42:01] know giving them money or joining their
[42:04] church but the real five-fold Ministry
[42:06] won't try to deceive you the real
[42:08] five-fold ministry will try to unite you
[42:11] around the revealed word of God the true
[42:14] Revelation from Jesus Christ amen but
[42:17] false preachers are trying to get you to
[42:19] go from Doctrine to Doctrine to a
[42:21] different idea to different idea to this
[42:23] idea we never heard brother I've never
[42:24] said it like this but oh it's some
[42:26] different revelation that's not what the
[42:28] fivefold ministry does the fivefold
[42:30] ministry brings you maturity it edifies
[42:32] you it builds you up it brings Unity
[42:35] Hallelujah it brings a Perfection to the
[42:38] Saints ah Hallelujah I'm feeling good
[42:40] today hallelujah how you feeling
[42:41] everybody feeling good glory I feel free
[42:43] I always feel free when I come
[42:45] here
[42:48] hallelujah see the true Holy Ghost will
[42:50] give us the right
[42:52] Doctrine it also give us the right uh
[42:56] Revelations too let me share this nice
[42:57] little testimony we
[43:00] had this was uh back in March back in
[43:04] March there's a brother who lives in
[43:07] Illinois and he came down two years ago
[43:09] to visit us he he was a six 78y old man
[43:13] I think he's 80 now 70 year old man

[43:19] little church and he said you're my home

[44:20] that following Wednesday night we're
[44:21] going to church and I got a voicemail
[44:22] from him I thought it maybe might be his
[44:24] wife maybe it said that he passed away
[44:26] or something I couldn't listen to it
[44:28] because I was on the way to church and I
[44:30] then I forgot cuz I was getting ready to

[44:34] and he said brother Jesse he said tell
[44:35] your church that God change God heard
[44:40] your prayer and that prayer changes
[44:42] things that's what brother Ram taught us
[44:44] Prayer Changes
[44:46] Things he said he listed eight things

[45:11] sores are healed up and an ultrasound
[45:14] revealed another healing but then the
[45:16] the voicemail called it cut off there I
[45:19] told the church look at that God eight
[45:21] is the number of Eternity amen so God
[45:23] just set down he put a little eternity
[45:26] in his body amen hallelujah and it was
[45:29] just simple you know
[45:31] prayer death death was knocking at the
[45:33] door but when the saints pray God hears
[45:35] the Saints
[45:38] Hallelujah I just want to encourage you
[45:39] no no matter how Bleak it looks and and
[45:41] yes there are times God you know God
[45:43] would take people home right we know God
[45:45] takes people home at times but I just
[45:47] want to encourage you you can be
[45:49] standing right there at desk door but
[45:51] Jesus might close that door hallelujah
[45:53] amen keep praying to God all things are
[45:56] possible to them that believe
[45:58] hallelujah
[46:01] amen now he's in a rehab place with his
[46:03] wife he said oh everything's back to
[46:05] normal by God's grace I thought he was
[46:07] dying I thought we're losing
[46:09] him God is able to change the situation
[46:11] praise
[46:13] God
[46:15] now we all come in the unity of
[46:17] faith and so see the the the the the
[46:20] fightful ministry Ephesians 4:14 will
[46:23] make us mature adults in the faith not
[46:26] just little kids
[46:28] kids right we don't want to be little
[46:30] kids what do little kids do I'm I'm
[46:32] around little kids all the day I teach
[46:33] first grade I got a lot I got 20 years
[46:36] of experience with little
[46:39] kids what do they do whe they're happy
[46:41] for a while but as soon as one of them
[46:43] crosses another they just turn on each
[46:45] other they hate each other argue and cry
[46:47] and scream and that's what they at least
[46:49] in my classes maybe you all got better
[46:53] classes but see they're they're babies
[46:55] you know no not babies but they're
[46:57] immature they let little things upset
[47:00] well one day we're BFFs and the next day
[47:02] we're no longer friends and then the
[47:04] next day we're back to BFF
[47:08] fffs right and it's just back and forth
[47:12] but God doesn't want immature Christians
[47:14] God wants mature Christians praise God
[47:17] right in other words like a mature
[47:19] Christian you know a preacher and I
[47:21] brother irin and I or brother Simon and
[47:22] I we may differ on something but we're
[47:24] still Brothers right brother Ram said
[47:26] you ought to be able to sit down with
[47:28] someone he said you bitterly disagree
[47:31] with and tell them the very convictions
[47:34] of your heart but when you're done he
[47:37] said if your brothers Shake hand and hug
[47:39] each other around the neck and say how
[47:41] much you love
[47:42] them think about what would you bitterly
[47:44] disagree with someone
[47:46] on brother said that's what a Christian
[47:49] can do why because we're not little
[47:50] children we're mature Christians by
[47:52] God's grace
[47:54] amen amen
[47:58] I I don't think it hurt to say this you
[48:00] know there are certain things I disagree
[48:02] with on my own brothers that we talked
[48:03] about it they they believe the seven
[48:05] Thunders are going to be in the future I
[48:07] believe as I told you I believe they're
[48:08] already uttered but you know what
[48:10] they're still my brothers right and I
[48:12] know this too if I'm seeking the Holy
[48:14] Ghost every day like brother John said
[48:15] if we're praying as a family together
[48:17] and we're seeking more of God then if if
[48:19] the Thunders will be in the future I'm
[48:21] the one that's going to get it too right
[48:23] amen because I want more of God to I
[48:26] want all that God has for me how many
[48:28] want more all that God has for you so
[48:30] see I know either way either way and
[48:33] even Church even like this to me it's a
[48:36] minor anyway because I know as long as
[48:38] my soul has the baptism of the Holy
[48:40] Ghost then I will go out to meet the
[48:42] bridegroom amen Matthew 25 amen as long
[48:47] as I've got the oil as long as I've got
[48:49] the Holy Ghost I will go out to meet
[48:51] Christ hallelujah
[48:54] amen see that's what it's all about Mak
[48:56] sure you're born again and then Jesus
[48:58] said in John 16:13 he'll guide me into
[49:01] all truth
[49:03] hallelujah in other words all the truth
[49:05] that I need to live a Godly Christian
[49:07] Life God is going to reveal to
[49:10] me praise God thank you think about this
[49:14] thought now brother brother irin
[49:16] mentioned John 21 I think it's in that
[49:18] same chapter where all there was a
[49:20] saying amongst the apostles and the
[49:22] disciples that John was not going to die
[49:26] until they saw Jesus come back how many
[49:28] remember
[49:29] that church how many of those disciples
[49:32] did you think disagreed on that and yet
[49:35] God let them all die going down to the
[49:37] Grave thinking oh I wish I could live as
[49:39] long as John is then I'll go in the
[49:41] Rapture then I'll see
[49:43] Jesus and church now apply that to
[49:45] brother Ram brother Ram thought 1977
[49:47] would be the end of it God let him pass
[49:50] away God take him
[49:51] home letting him have these just human
[49:54] thoughts his own opinions his own
[49:55] convictions
[49:57] right God's a God in Mercy everybody
[49:59] understand what I'm
[50:00] saying you know guiding us into all
[50:02] truth doesn't mean you know we're going
[50:04] to understand and know every single
[50:05] thing but it means having the baptism of
[50:08] the Holy Ghost and the Bible said having
[50:10] all things there it is all things that
[50:12] pertain unto life and godliness amen
[50:14] there it is let's read that amen oh that
[50:16] was fresh
[50:17] Hallelujah let me look that up all
[50:18] things that pertain uh 1 Peter 13 there
[50:21] there it is that's it right there
[50:22] Hallelujah that's from the Holy Spirit I
[50:24] believe
[50:26] just inspiration while I'm preaching
[50:28] here uh second Peter 1:3 I'm sorry
[50:30] second Peter 13 and then we'll go to 1
[50:32] Timothy 2 I just read that this morning
[50:33] I thought it be a help to you by God's
[50:41] grace second Peter 13 2 Peter
[50:47] 13 brother John when you get that would
[50:49] you read that for us brother uh just
[50:50] verse 3 2 Peter
[50:52] 1:3 according as his divine power has
[50:55] given unto us all things that pertain
[50:57] unto life and godliness and through the
[51:00] knowledge through the knowledge of him
[51:02] that has called us to glory and virtue
[51:05] amen how many things does he give us all
[51:08] things amen anything we need on this
[51:11] Earthly Journey For Life and godliness
[51:14] he's given it to us so when Jesus said
[51:16] the Holy Ghost will guide you into all
[51:18] truth that's what he means everything
[51:20] you need for this Earthly Journey God
[51:22] has richly supplied it amen it's exactly
[51:26] right
[51:29] right so now go to First Timothy 2 I
[51:31] just think I'll would go there uh I just
[51:33] saw these scriptures this
[51:39] morning let me see I got to find the
[51:42] verse
[51:47] here I'm sorry second Timothy 2 I'm
[51:49] sorry second Timothy 2 my fault pardon
[51:52] me
[51:58] second Timothy
[51:59] 2 yes that's right that's right verse 14
[52:02] 2 Timothy 2:14 that's where I wanted to
[52:11] show of these things put them in
[52:13] remembrance charging them before the
[52:16] Lord a charging means to solemnly affirm
[52:19] or give them a charge give them a a
[52:23] testimony give them uh yeah testimony to
[52:27] attest to cause cause them to believe so
[52:31] cause them to believe before the Lord
[52:33] that they strive not about words to no
[52:37] profit now I've seen this over the years
[52:39] brother Iran you know brother John
[52:42] people will come in and they'll try to
[52:43] just bring up a topic that it really
[52:45] isn't going to profit us anything one
[52:47] way or the
[52:48] other
[52:50] right and so we got to be careful not to
[52:53] go down rabbit
[52:54] Trails or subjects that are are not
[52:56] going to help us be more Godly there's
[52:59] got to be something important that comes
[53:01] out of this
[53:02] Hallelujah like I'll give you some
[53:04] examples like recently people have been
[53:05] emailing me saying you know um was
[53:08] brother brandom's mom actually half
[53:10] Cherokee or half whatever and to me this
[53:13] this is this is that scripture I'm not
[53:16] going to strive with them about this
[53:18] topic because it doesn't it doesn't
[53:20] bring any profit to my walk with
[53:23] God it it doesn't
[53:26] I want to preach God's word I only have
[53:28] so much
[53:30] time another one is you know somebody
[53:32] said well did Brother Ram travel around
[53:34] the world seven times or was it four and
[53:37] to me I'm like it doesn't really matter
[53:40] I'm not going to spend my time striving
[53:42] on that I can't even I can't go back and
[53:44] prove it to you anyway like you can't
[53:46] prove what you're right I can't prove
[53:48] I'm
[53:49] right and what they're trying to do is
[53:51] they're trying to discredit God's profit
[53:54] shame on them
[53:57] Hallelujah but what the real five-fold
[53:59] Ministry does is point to us to the
[54:01] scripture to what the Holy Spirit wants
[54:03] to make real in our lives that will help
[54:06] us grow help us edify help us to be
[54:09] built up in the
[54:11] gospel how many know the gospel means
[54:13] good news when you heard brother's
[54:15] message you heard the good news of God
[54:17] hallelujah amen I know I did amen
[54:21] hallelujah verse 15 is where irin and me
[54:24] the preachers study to show thy self
[54:26] approved unto brother irin this helped
[54:28] me one time the Holy Spirit revealed
[54:29] this unto me unto
[54:31] God in other words we study and we make
[54:34] sure God approves of my sermon before I
[54:37] come out and preach
[54:39] it it's a big difference some people
[54:42] want to study so their Church approves
[54:44] of it that's what you all came out
[54:47] of we're studying so that God approves
[54:50] of the message amen
[54:54] hallelujah and you got to work at it
[54:56] it's a Workman that needeth not to be
[54:57] ashamed he rightly divides the word of
[54:59] truth that means to cut
[55:01] straight he cuts that sacrifice straight
[55:04] he makes a straight understanding a
[55:06] clear distinction am a clear distinction
[55:08] between good and evil
[55:10] Hallelujah clear understanding this is
[55:13] clearly the Bible truth this is clearly
[55:16] a true Doctrine this is a straight life
[55:20] this is a narrow walk
[55:22] amen rightly dividing the word of truth
[55:25] that also means brother we got to cut
[55:27] out any false doctrines cut that
[55:30] out right we got to cut out uh we got to
[55:33] cut out uh words that strive about to no
[55:36] profit got to say dear brother dear
[55:38] sister let's not focus on that there's
[55:41] no way for us to prove it we got to wait
[55:44] till we find out in heaven but really
[55:45] when we're in heaven we're probably
[55:47] going to care anyway I don't know about
[55:49] you but I'm going to be caring about
[55:50] Jesus in
[55:51] heaven I'm a going to be trying to
[55:52] figure out how much DNA of that person
[55:54] how much DNA I'm going to be saying I'm
[55:56] just saying where's Jesus let me worship
[55:58] him praise God I want to see the one
[56:00] that died for me
[56:02] Hallelujah that's what I'm going to be
[56:04] worried about in
[56:05] heaven amen where's the Savior where's
[56:08] where's my Lord where's the one I live
[56:10] for my whole life where's the one I
[56:11] preach about all these years let me see
[56:14] Jesus
[56:15] hallelujah hallelujah verse 16 but shun
[56:18] profane and vain babblings that's what a
[56:21] lot of people do just Babble
[56:22] today empty discussions
[56:26] useless matters where is this taking us
[56:29] right I'm talking about people that take
[56:30] away not here but people that take try
[56:32] to take you away from the word of
[56:34] God and now for us usually it's centered
[56:37] around brother brandom you know or the
[56:39] the preaching that he gave
[56:41] us for they now here's here's the key
[56:43] here's what I want to bring up and they
[56:45] will increase unto more what un
[56:48] godliness so the people that are going
[56:50] to be trying to distract us from the
[56:52] word of God are going to be living more
[56:55] worldly all the time and brother Ray
[56:59] brother
[56:59] Irvin I've seen it since this big move
[57:02] in 2012 where people are leaving the
[57:05] message at first they respected brother
[57:07] Brandon but now it's been uh 12 years
[57:10] now they just flat out ridicule him call
[57:14] him
[57:15] names and I I listen because I I know I
[57:18] I want to know what I'm talking about
[57:19] when I preach I record there just like
[57:22] they're watching mine I'm watching you
[57:23] too oh I'm watching your brother Jesse
[57:26] well I'm watching you too I'm going to
[57:28] call you out too and at first they uh
[57:31] they were very very respectful but now
[57:33] they say uh it's okay to get tattoos
[57:35] it's okay to open up uh tattoo parlors
[57:38] even one of the main leaders now says
[57:40] it's okay to have non-binary
[57:41] relationships like I I didn't even know
[57:43] what that meant I had to go look it up
[57:46] it non-binary means well one day I'm a
[57:48] man so I'm going to look for a woman
[57:49] relationship well next I might be a
[57:51] woman I'm going look for a man for a
[57:52] relationship that's what it means this
[57:54] perversion
[57:56] and what the Bible Years brother Daniel
[57:59] first they were so nice to brother brand
[58:01] so nice and now they're just increasing
[58:03] to more and more ungodliness a true
[58:06] child of God would never swallow down
[58:08] the LIE of a nonbinary relationship
[58:11] that's perversion that's confusion
[58:14] that's the spirit of
[58:17] confusion and then now they can say oh
[58:19] yeah we can listen to rock and roll now
[58:22] Bon Joi and ACDC and oh now it's not the
[58:24] devil they they say now oh the devil's
[58:27] not behind that now it's just artwork
[58:28] it's just
[58:30] expression it's the expression of the
[58:32] Devils it's very easy and I I know
[58:34] they're going to listen to this they'll
[58:35] probably email me on this fine go ahead
[58:37] and email me I'll probably delete it you
[58:39] know maybe not it depends what kind of
[58:41] spirit they come in because Jesus said
[58:44] at some point let the blind lead the
[58:46] blind right because they both fall into
[58:48] a
[58:50] ditch and that's just some of them
[58:52] Church there are so many more oh yeah
[58:54] and women can cut their hair but the
[58:55] Bible says you do that it's a dishonor
[58:57] you know what that word means in the
[58:58] Greek you know what it means
[59:00] repulsive that's what the word dishonor
[59:02] means in the Greek look it up it's a
[59:05] repulse like you know you see something
[59:06] disgusting it repulses you right that's
[59:09] what it is for a woman to cut her hair
[59:11] or a man to grow out his hair
[59:13] uncut it's a repulse and they allow
[59:16] their women to cut their hair now and
[59:19] wear makeup and wear
[59:22] pants right and they they say we're free
[59:27] no we're free Hallelujah you're deceived
[59:30] amen you're chained up the Bible say
[59:32] it's like a dog that goes back to its
[59:34] vomit it's like a pig that goes back to
[59:36] its wallow
[59:38] am that's what's happening and the Bible
[59:41] said they'd argue about all these little
[59:43] minor things and their lives will get
[59:45] increasingly more ungodly but our lives
[59:48] should be getting more holy hallelujah
[59:51] how many appreciate the Holiness of the
[59:53] Holy Spirit praise God how many know
[59:54] you're living a more holy life now than
[59:56] your previous
[59:58] church amen hallelujah I know that's a
[1:00:01] reality Hallelujah that's why I love
[1:00:03] this message amen look at verse 17 now
[1:00:05] here's one prime
[1:00:07] example and their word will eat as that
[1:00:10] a canker so all these arguments about
[1:00:12] these little things that don't matter it
[1:00:14] don't help you live a better Christian
[1:00:15] Life will eat like a canker a canker is
[1:00:18] like a flesh eating disease it's Gang
[1:00:21] Green how many know Gang Green in the
[1:00:22] Vietnam War they used to get gang green
[1:00:25] it would eat up their body parts and
[1:00:28] slowly eat away their bones until they
[1:00:31] have to have cut off right if you got
[1:00:32] Gang Green you have to amputate the arm
[1:00:35] and the Holy Ghost says that's what
[1:00:38] these false ideas are and this these
[1:00:40] vain uh vain arguments thank you sir God
[1:00:44] bless you God will reward you for that
[1:00:45] every every cup of water in the name of
[1:00:47] Jesus gets a reward I always tell him
[1:00:48] that he's going to have good reward
[1:00:50] Hallelujah all these vein babblings
[1:00:53] these profane shun things they're
[1:00:54] arguing about taking trying to get
[1:00:56] people away from the word of God it will
[1:00:58] eat like a cancer till the body starts
[1:01:01] missing
[1:01:03] parts until they're no longer
[1:01:05] recognizable they look like a different
[1:01:06] person and that's what we've seen these
[1:01:08] people that leave the message they're
[1:01:09] different people
[1:01:11] now right they're not the same people
[1:01:14] they're missing some of what they used
[1:01:15] to be they used to be sweet and humble
[1:01:19] but now they're prideful and arrogant
[1:01:20] and aggressive what happened they had
[1:01:23] some spiritual amputations done the
[1:01:25] devil's eating eating away all their all
[1:01:27] their testimony all their love for God
[1:01:30] he's eating it
[1:01:32] away of whom is hus and philus who
[1:01:35] concerning the truth have
[1:01:37] aired saying that the resurrection has
[1:01:40] passed already overthrowing the faith of
[1:01:43] some now look Paul gives a specific
[1:01:46] example hus and uh felus were saying oh
[1:01:50] the rapture's already happened
[1:01:52] guys just enjoy life the rapture's
[1:01:54] already happened we're in the Millennium
[1:01:55] right now
[1:01:57] or we're in the tribulation right now
[1:01:58] this Ain nothing read read about the
[1:02:00] seven trumpets to Israel brother said
[1:02:02] those seven trumpets are not for the
[1:02:03] Gentiles that's for the time of the
[1:02:05] Israel not on Israel but to judge all
[1:02:08] the the world where while God is saving
[1:02:12] Israel but look at that Paul said when
[1:02:16] when someone would say all the Rapture
[1:02:18] already happened it's a gang green that
[1:02:21] overthrows people's Faith see they're no
[1:02:23] longer having faith for Jesus is coming
[1:02:25] back Jesus is coming back and these lies
[1:02:27] have overthrown their faith and they
[1:02:30] spiritually think about that their
[1:02:31] spiritual amputees coming to church
[1:02:33] without hands no wonder they can't
[1:02:34] worship God like they ought to no wonder
[1:02:37] they can't walk straight you they just
[1:02:38] hop around the church you or they they
[1:02:41] wobble around the church they're
[1:02:43] spiritual ues they can't walk the way
[1:02:45] they're supposed to walk they can't move
[1:02:47] their hands they don't they're not
[1:02:48] they're not a real living Christian
[1:02:51] because they've accepted false doctrines
[1:02:53] that's why it's so important to have the
[1:02:54] Holy Ghost to know know the truth the
[1:02:56] truth shall set us free
[1:02:59] Hallelujah now I'm going to list some of
[1:03:00] these major ones around the message just
[1:03:02] so you're aware brother irin and all the
[1:03:05] saints some of these false caners are
[1:03:08] the tape Church worship press play and
[1:03:10] Obey which say preacher sit down just
[1:03:12] play brother R's tapes that's a canker
[1:03:15] that destroys the faith of
[1:03:17] many that's
[1:03:19] right there's another uh false Doctrine
[1:03:22] the return Ministry brother Ram has to
[1:03:24] come back and physically preach us into
[1:03:26] Rapture condition that's a lie brother
[1:03:29] R's going to come back but it's going to
[1:03:30] be when the dead in Christ rise first
[1:03:33] amen hallelujah in other words we'll see
[1:03:35] Paul we'll see Peter we'll see brother
[1:03:37] brandham and the Rapture just any moment
[1:03:40] Hallelujah that that's
[1:03:42] right another one is we're in the
[1:03:44] Millennium there's a actually a Ohio
[1:03:46] Church down near Dayton that believes
[1:03:47] that and they've got the eighth
[1:03:49] messenger and they're in the Millennium
[1:03:51] what a bunch of
[1:03:52] nonsense and they got false Doctrine in
[1:03:55] there you they got
[1:03:57] adulteries all kind of money issues and
[1:04:00] thefts and all kinds of things like that
[1:04:02] see every false Doctrine will produce
[1:04:05] this spiritual
[1:04:07] canker because false Doctrine is like
[1:04:10] leaven A little leaven leavens the whole
[1:04:13] lump if it's not cut out amen by a
[1:04:16] preacher that can rightly divide the
[1:04:17] word of truth if it's not cut out it'll
[1:04:19] make the whole church full of
[1:04:22] sin that's why you ought to Rejoice if
[1:04:24] your church is still walking holy after
[1:04:26] one year right April was the one year
[1:04:28] anniversary of when you started the
[1:04:30] church right if you're a year gone and
[1:04:32] there's no le in church you ought to say
[1:04:34] praise the Lord
[1:04:36] hallelujah amen our church will be 18
[1:04:38] years next month and by God's grace all
[1:04:40] the leavens out we're a unleavened loaf
[1:04:43] hallelujah we're unleavened uh article
[1:04:46] of God's bread all the sin has been kept
[1:04:49] out that's a miracle of the Holy Spirit
[1:04:51] praise God that's the work of Christ in
[1:04:53] the fivefold ministry
[1:04:56] Hallelujah another one is polygamy a lot
[1:04:59] of people misunderstand marriage and
[1:05:00] divorce because they don't listen to
[1:05:01] brother an's other
[1:05:03] tapes and so they allow men to marry two
[1:05:06] three four five wives it's sin it's
[1:05:09] wickedness it's mostly in Africa but
[1:05:11] there are some in America that's another
[1:05:14] uh canker
[1:05:15] Doctrine here's another one that's more
[1:05:17] close to us dead
[1:05:20] worship preachers don't want people
[1:05:22] screaming they don't want people dancing
[1:05:25] they don't want people shouting they
[1:05:27] don't want people crying that's a
[1:05:29] canker the Bible says quench not the
[1:05:32] holy spirit amen amen hallelujah that's
[1:05:36] right amen somebody clap Hall
[1:05:43] clap don't shut it off if you feel God
[1:05:46] the Bible say the Holy Ghost is like a
[1:05:48] Living Waters boiling up in you if you
[1:05:51] feel it boiling up don't shut it off Let
[1:05:53] It Go worship God give God praise praise
[1:05:56] Hallelujah and that might set somebody
[1:05:58] else free Glory that might help somebody
[1:06:02] else get in the holy
[1:06:03] spirit amen you know that's how it is
[1:06:06] church you know it takes somebody to
[1:06:08] start getting free that everybody else
[1:06:10] feels oh now I can stand or now I can
[1:06:12] clap or now I can dance it's always like
[1:06:15] that I've been a pastor for 18 years
[1:06:16] it's always been like that it takes
[1:06:19] somebody's got to let that living water
[1:06:20] flow not hey stop stop Holy Spirit stop
[1:06:24] no Let It Go
[1:06:26] just praise God just sing just clap just
[1:06:28] Rejoice whatever you got to do just
[1:06:30] worship God
[1:06:31] hallelujah
[1:06:33] amen I still dance we just danced last
[1:06:36] Saturday night you know I always laugh
[1:06:37] laugh with all you when I preach on
[1:06:40] Dancing here it was out in your garage I
[1:06:41] danced around here I had to make sure I
[1:06:42] didn't hit my head on that uh garage
[1:06:44] door thing I just want to be
[1:06:47] free I don't want the devil to take my
[1:06:52] worship but they'll say oh that's just
[1:06:54] Wildfire something like that they'll use
[1:06:56] these quotes the wrong
[1:06:58] way no church we don't have Wildfire we
[1:07:00] have the real fire of God I've got the
[1:07:03] real fire of God I've got a living fire
[1:07:05] burning in my life how many got a
[1:07:08] burning desire to love Jesus Christ you
[1:07:12] got the fire amen don't let that fire go
[1:07:15] out amen don't let somebody stifle that
[1:07:18] don't let somebody quench that let the
[1:07:20] fire of God consume all your worries
[1:07:22] consume all your doubts Let the Fire of
[1:07:24] God consume all that and and worship God
[1:07:26] the way he deserves to be worshiped
[1:07:29] amen
[1:07:31] hallelujah some people baptize in
[1:07:33] brother Ram's name that's a sin that's a
[1:07:36] lie that's idolatry that's a
[1:07:40] heresy and there's so many other more
[1:07:43] those are just a few examples now the
[1:07:45] one that's going to probably impact us
[1:07:46] the most is the one about worship we got
[1:07:49] to make sure we're free in the Holy
[1:07:51] Spirit right that at least that's what
[1:07:53] I've seen in Ohio brother
[1:07:55] brother Irvin now the reason I say that
[1:07:58] is because when I when brother Isaiah
[1:07:59] was my pastor
[1:08:01] Irvin he met with another Pastor in Lima
[1:08:04] who's no longer in the message and that
[1:08:07] Pastor made fun of his worship and his
[1:08:09] dancing and his praising God and His
[1:08:12] crying and shouting and rejoicing and
[1:08:14] brother Rooks preached at our church the
[1:08:16] in 2007 he said he didn't name the name
[1:08:18] but he said that man's going to fall and
[1:08:20] he
[1:08:21] fell uh would have been 6 years later he
[1:08:24] fell he left the message now he he he uh
[1:08:27] reviles brother
[1:08:28] Brandon and see brother Brooks knew it
[1:08:30] because the Holy Spirit won't make fun
[1:08:32] of the Holy
[1:08:34] Spirit if the holy spirit danc in David
[1:08:37] the Holy Spirit would dance in us
[1:08:39] hallelujah when it's time to dance it
[1:08:42] don't isn't always time to dance
[1:08:44] sometimes it's time to mourn but there
[1:08:46] are times it's time to dance Hallelujah
[1:08:49] we danced around the church last
[1:08:50] Saturday night brother Brooks was there
[1:08:51] that's right yeah we had a good time in
[1:08:53] the Lord yes it worked perfectly
[1:08:54] Hallelujah that worked out really good
[1:08:57] there but see that's just a great
[1:08:59] example there and that's kind of in this
[1:09:02] area of the North in in the United
[1:09:05] States now not so much in Africa we have
[1:09:07] saints that our church that used to go
[1:09:09] to Africa they dance every service for
[1:09:11] an
[1:09:12] hour we usually have a 30 minute song
[1:09:14] service right they're used to an hourong
[1:09:17] service all dancing they got the men on
[1:09:20] this side they're
[1:09:22] going they got the women on this side
[1:09:24] they're going right I don't know I can't
[1:09:25] dance like a woman I just dance like a
[1:09:28] man you know and that's what they're
[1:09:31] used to so when they come to America
[1:09:33] they're like where's all the joy where's
[1:09:34] all the dancing well you can find at our
[1:09:36] church praise God
[1:09:38] hallelujah and they want to find it at
[1:09:39] your
[1:09:41] church hallelujah mean they how how
[1:09:43] could they dance under the blood of
[1:09:44] bulls and goats but yet we can't dance
[1:09:46] under the blood of Jesus Christ which
[1:09:48] speaketh better things and that of Abel
[1:09:51] hallelujah oh my the Forgiveness of the
[1:09:54] blood of Jesus Christ is total complete
[1:09:57] Perfection
[1:09:59] hallelujah oh my thank God for his Mercy
[1:10:02] thank God for his grace I feel like
[1:10:04] dancing today praise God I like that
[1:10:06] Jesus rules he rules our life right
[1:10:07] there amen he rules our dance he rules
[1:10:10] our services amen
[1:10:11] am that's what's going to probably
[1:10:13] affect us here in
[1:10:16] Ohio is false doctrines like that
[1:10:18] probably not the tape
[1:10:20] church but I'm saying something I'm
[1:10:23] saying because that's kind of in Ohio
[1:10:24] that spirit is in in
[1:10:28] Ohio so we want to have the freedom and
[1:10:30] the liberty of the Holy Spirit now I
[1:10:33] understand there's a time right I
[1:10:34] understand you know tongues are not
[1:10:36] supposed to inter interrupt the
[1:10:37] preaching I understand
[1:10:40] that but there's also the aspect where a
[1:10:43] church is
[1:10:44] growing and so I I we've had this happen
[1:10:47] in our church I think three or four
[1:10:48] times now A a person has spoken in
[1:10:51] tongues and maybe it wasn't right at the
[1:10:53] exact right time I that's I said that's
[1:10:55] okay let's just pray for a few minutes
[1:10:57] and see if we get the interpretation
[1:10:59] well in each case the interpretation
[1:11:00] never came but I never bash the church
[1:11:03] for that brother R said if a if if your
[1:11:06] little baby's trying to talk these
[1:11:08] little todders are trying to talk and
[1:11:10] they don't say the word right they
[1:11:13] brother you're not going to smack them
[1:11:14] and say say the word right they're just
[1:11:16] learning how to
[1:11:17] talk brother said that's how it is with
[1:11:20] gifts you're just learning how to use
[1:11:21] the gifts you're just learning how to
[1:11:23] speak in tongues you're just learning
[1:11:25] how to you know have M gift of Miracles
[1:11:27] get the prophecy you're just learning in
[1:11:30] other words you just said at the wrong
[1:11:32] time but just pray next time and maybe
[1:11:34] God will help you be a little more
[1:11:35] mature and you'll say it at the right
[1:11:37] time praise
[1:11:39] God
[1:11:41] hallelujah
[1:11:43] Glory all right well this is turning out
[1:11:45] a lot different than I thought by God's
[1:11:46] grace so praise the Lord how many love
[1:11:48] the Lord today that's my way to kind of
[1:11:52] reset I try to find a place to close up
[1:11:54] here by God's Grace it's our
[1:12:01] 11:20 now I want to say this Revelation
[1:12:04] 10:7 the seventh angel is the same angel
[1:12:07] of Revelation
[1:12:08] 3:14 so let's go to Revelation 3:14 if
[1:12:11] you have your Bibles
[1:12:15] there good job good job good job
[1:12:18] buddy Ma's holding the baby what a good
[1:12:21] worker there boy that guy's a real good
[1:12:22] worker sister Miram do you want to read
[1:12:24] that when you get it Rev 3:14 brother R
[1:12:26] said Revelation 10:7 the seventh angel
[1:12:28] is the same Angel of the seventh letter
[1:12:31] the letter to the
[1:12:33] leans and that's true it is so whenever
[1:12:35] you want to read that
[1:12:41] [Music]
[1:12:45] sister amen amen
[1:12:48] hallelujah
[1:12:50] now we can clearly see how these seventh
[1:12:53] angels are the same angel
[1:12:56] here's three
[1:12:57] proofs think about this church why would
[1:13:00] God tell John to write a letter to an
[1:13:04] angel I mean I mean I'm talking about a
[1:13:06] Heavenly Angel does that make any sense
[1:13:08] to anybody has anyone ever seen that in
[1:13:10] the Bible how does a Heavenly Angel need
[1:13:12] a letter from a man when was the last
[1:13:14] time you wrote a letter to an angel did
[1:13:15] you ever write a letter to an angel
[1:13:17] could anybody think of a time in the
[1:13:19] Bible where a human had to write a
[1:13:20] letter so a Heavenly Angel could
[1:13:22] understand it no because when God want
[1:13:25] to talk to an angel he just says Angel
[1:13:26] come
[1:13:27] here wormwood come here Gabriel Michael
[1:13:30] come here right so that's that's the
[1:13:34] proof that this Angel to the Le ofans
[1:13:36] was a a man it's a
[1:13:40] preacher because God never tells men to
[1:13:43] write letters to
[1:13:44] angels and I got a little hunch here if
[1:13:46] you're writing letters to Angels I think
[1:13:48] it's the wrong
[1:13:51] Angel right the Fallen Angels you're
[1:13:54] trying to right from God to Angels I
[1:13:56] think you're under the wrong wrong
[1:13:57] Spirit there I think you're under the
[1:13:59] Fallen
[1:14:00] Angels a second reason David and Paul
[1:14:03] were called angels in the scripture how
[1:14:05] many know
[1:14:06] that anybody ever see those verses
[1:14:08] before okay let's let's read those
[1:14:09] that'd be
[1:14:12] good
[1:14:15] uh uh go to 1st Samuel
[1:14:20] 299 sister Ruth why don't you get that
[1:14:22] 1st Samuel
[1:14:23] 299 now how how many what the word angel
[1:14:25] means does anybody know just means
[1:14:28] messenger messenger that's all it means
[1:14:31] right because that's what an angel is
[1:14:31] it's a messenger from
[1:14:33] God but men are often called angels in
[1:14:36] the Bible too what is it it's God hiding
[1:14:39] a
[1:14:40] mystery remember the Seven Stars and the
[1:14:43] Seven candlesticks they're called a
[1:14:44] mystery in Revelation chapter 1 this is
[1:14:46] a mystery God's hiding it from the
[1:14:47] denominations revealing it to the bride
[1:14:51] so sister when you're ready uh 1st
[1:14:52] Samuel 29:9
[1:14:56] and answered and said to David I know
[1:14:59] that thou good in my sight as an angel
[1:15:01] of God notand the of philes have said he
[1:15:07] shall not up with us to the battle amen
[1:15:10] how many can say Amen to that amen David
[1:15:13] is called an angel he's like a messenger
[1:15:15] from God now next one is Galatians 4:14
[1:15:19] Sister Sarah do you want to read that
[1:15:21] Galatians 4:14
[1:15:38] reive amen let's say Amen to that amen
[1:15:42] so Paul and David were called Angels
[1:15:46] Messengers Hallelujah and then remember
[1:15:49] John the Baptist is called an I'm sorry
[1:15:51] messenger of the Covenant so we know
[1:15:53] John the Baptist would have been as an
[1:15:55] angel in the sight of God as well not a
[1:15:57] spiritual Angel but a human Messenger
[1:16:00] right okay so can everybody see that now
[1:16:02] you know that now brother B taught that
[1:16:04] it's in the church Age series because he
[1:16:07] dealt with the seven Church age
[1:16:08] Messengers or the seven angels to the
[1:16:11] seven churches all right everybody got
[1:16:15] that and then the other proof is the
[1:16:17] seventh angel of Revelation 10:7 he
[1:16:20] doesn't have a trumpet for
[1:16:23] judgment right the the other seven angel
[1:16:26] trumpets they all have
[1:16:28] trumpets so Revelation 10 is not a
[1:16:31] trumpet it's not a Heavenly angel with a
[1:16:33] trumpet it's a human Prophet it's a
[1:16:36] preacher who's finishing the mystery of
[1:16:38] God hallelujah if you want to see the
[1:16:42] seventh angel that has a trumpet that's
[1:16:43] Revelation 11:15 let's read that uh
[1:16:46] sister ly you want to get that
[1:16:47] Revelation
[1:16:50] 11:15 whenever you're ready and the
[1:16:53] seventh angels and there was great was
[1:16:55] it in heaven saying the kingdoms of this
[1:16:57] world are become the kingdoms of our
[1:17:00] Lord and of his Christ and he shall re
[1:17:02] forever and ever all right praise God so
[1:17:05] when that seventh trumpet
[1:17:08] sounds the day of man is ended and the
[1:17:11] day of the Lord Has Come brother said
[1:17:13] the day of the Lord starts when Jesus
[1:17:15] comes back at
[1:17:16] Armageddon because Jesus comes back he
[1:17:18] makes war with those Nations he destroys
[1:17:20] them all now it's the Lord's day it
[1:17:23] ain't man's day anymore it ain't China's
[1:17:25] day it ain't hamas's day it ain't
[1:17:27] America's day it's the Lord's Day
[1:17:30] Hallelujah and that Lord's day starts
[1:17:32] the Thousand Year period a day with the
[1:17:35] Lord is as what a thousand years he gets
[1:17:38] that seventh day honeymoon time amen
[1:17:41] honeymoon time for Christ in the bride
[1:17:43] amen
[1:17:45] glory so see there you got it by God's
[1:17:48] grace these wonderful Revelations hiding
[1:17:50] in there so Revelation 10:7 has to be a
[1:17:54] human preacher a human messenger who
[1:17:56] finishes the mystery of God and then the
[1:17:58] Saints eat it they eat the revelations
[1:18:01] it's sweet in their mouth but bitter in
[1:18:02] their belly and they got to go prophesy
[1:18:04] again to many nations Kindred people's
[1:18:06] tongues and that's what's happened for
[1:18:09] this last 60 years since brother bram's
[1:18:11] been off the scene preachers I know some
[1:18:14] of them have have uh traveled I know
[1:18:16] brother Maxwell the one from South
[1:18:17] America he has gotten in boats Saints
[1:18:20] when there's no more buses when there's
[1:18:22] no more roads he gets in a boat and go
[1:18:24] goes down the Amazon River to churches
[1:18:28] and makes new churches and brother
[1:18:30] Daniel all he does he just preaches the
[1:18:32] Lord Jesus Christ baptism and people
[1:18:34] will get saved and they'll start new
[1:18:36] message churches just down the river
[1:18:38] they they can't they don't have
[1:18:41] Wi-Fi that just a few years that was a
[1:18:43] couple years
[1:18:44] ago such remote
[1:18:47] areas but see what is brother what is
[1:18:49] his name is Maxwell Le what has that
[1:18:50] brother done Daniel he's eaten the book
[1:18:53] it's gone down into his belly and and
[1:18:54] now he's sharing the Prophecies of
[1:18:56] brother random he's prophesying again to
[1:18:58] many nations Kindred peoples and tongues
[1:19:00] hallelujah amen
[1:19:05] hallelujah see that's what's happening
[1:19:07] now so now can everybody see their place
[1:19:09] in the word of
[1:19:10] God your place is to grow up under the
[1:19:14] strength and the edification of the five
[1:19:16] full ministry and then when God uses you
[1:19:19] God's going to use you to witness this
[1:19:20] word to people that need to hear it like
[1:19:23] our sister I appreciate that testimony
[1:19:24] and brother what that's that's your
[1:19:27] greatest desire is to share the these
[1:19:29] prophecies share these words with other
[1:19:31] people is that right amen amen all right
[1:19:36] now few more things I want to
[1:19:41] say you remember brother Brandon went
[1:19:43] beyond the curtain of time I think it
[1:19:45] was in
[1:19:47] 1961 and he saw all the Saints running
[1:19:50] to him his
[1:19:52] converts right and then brother brother
[1:19:54] Ram said
[1:19:56] brother B asked you know are all these
[1:19:58] AR are all these brandom they said no
[1:19:59] they're your converts and the people
[1:20:02] shouted uh we're so glad you went
[1:20:04] brother
[1:20:05] Brandon and uh the voice said you're
[1:20:07] going to have to be judged for what you
[1:20:09] preached how many remember what the
[1:20:11] voice said does anybody remember what
[1:20:12] the voice
[1:20:15] said the voice said the preacher will be
[1:20:17] judged by what he preached and brother
[1:20:20] ramam said well I preached what Paul
[1:20:22] preached he said and all those millions
[1:20:25] of converts shouted back we're resting
[1:20:27] on that amen so there's people in heaven
[1:20:31] right now that heard brother ROM preach
[1:20:33] and they're in heaven because brother
[1:20:35] Brandon preached what St Paul preached
[1:20:39] Hallelujah in other words the
[1:20:40] revelations of the Bible that Paul
[1:20:43] preached have been restored through
[1:20:44] brother R's Ministry and then brother
[1:20:46] random preached them they receiv
[1:20:48] received it brother BR says it's the
[1:20:50] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:20:51] Jesus Christ is there's one God
[1:20:55] there's three works of Grace the baptism
[1:20:57] of the Holy Ghost the seven Church ages
[1:21:00] amen Israel's
[1:21:02] blindness all these Revelations had to
[1:21:04] be restored so that we can understand
[1:21:07] the book we can be edified we can be a
[1:21:09] mature Christian body
[1:21:12] Hallelujah we don't become cankered
[1:21:14] Christians and uh you know lose lose our
[1:21:17] strength and lose our position but no
[1:21:19] we're strong healthy Christians we're
[1:21:21] like a tree that's planted by the rivers
[1:21:23] of water Hallelujah
[1:21:25] am meditating day and night on the word
[1:21:27] of
[1:21:29] God and the Bible said all that we do
[1:21:32] all that we do will prosper so brother
[1:21:34] Howard I see some good prospering going
[1:21:35] on here by God's grace and then you got
[1:21:38] those baby on the way you're really
[1:21:39] prospering brother
[1:21:40] Hallelujah by God's grace and everybody
[1:21:43] has a time and season we just had a
[1:21:45] friend that have been married 10 years
[1:21:46] they could never have children they just
[1:21:47] had their first child down there in
[1:21:49] Texas Randy and uh
[1:21:52] Lindsay for 10 years they went through
[1:21:55] all these struggles how am I going to we
[1:21:56] can never have children can we have
[1:21:58] children God God you hear our prayers
[1:21:59] the whole time God like yeah I heard
[1:22:00] your prayers there's just a certain time
[1:22:02] in season for it right God's not worried
[1:22:05] about anything God knows the test and
[1:22:07] trials God hears your prayer
[1:22:10] Saints matter how long you got to wait
[1:22:12] God hears your prayers he'll strengthen
[1:22:16] you so see the Believers in heaven
[1:22:18] they're resting on the fact that brother
[1:22:20] Randon preached us the revelations of
[1:22:23] the Bible
[1:22:28] Hallelujah
[1:22:31] now how many know that brother brandom
[1:22:33] has at least six thus sayith the Lords
[1:22:35] that came to pass
[1:22:37] prophecies the people that I made a
[1:22:39] video about it if you haven't seen it
[1:22:40] back in August the people that leave the
[1:22:42] message they say brother R never had one
[1:22:44] prophecy they said he never even had one
[1:22:46] what a lie right in 1958 brother Ram
[1:22:50] said thus sayith the Lord he told a
[1:22:52] woman you've got to desire in your heart
[1:22:54] to have a baby you can't have a baby
[1:22:56] you've come from Denver Colorado thus
[1:22:58] sayith the Lord go home and receive your
[1:23:00] child God will give it to you if you
[1:23:02] believe well guess what she had to wait
[1:23:04] 10 years but in 1968 she had her first
[1:23:09] babyy he said go home and believe he
[1:23:11] didn't say go home and wait 10 years he
[1:23:13] just said go home and believe now how
[1:23:14] many could have waited 10 years you
[1:23:16] could if you were Abraham's
[1:23:17] seed absolutely and this woman she she's
[1:23:20] still
[1:23:21] alive she only had one child that was
[1:23:23] the one child that one brother BR gave
[1:23:25] her thus say the Lord on wow now see
[1:23:27] these Liars they're lying say oh there's
[1:23:29] no prophecies they don't know the truth
[1:23:32] right brother random foretold the death
[1:23:34] of one woman her name was Florence
[1:23:36] sharen now all the preacher she had
[1:23:38] cancer all the preachers around Florence
[1:23:40] Shear were saying she's going to be
[1:23:42] healed but brother R said no I saw a
[1:23:43] vision it's thus sayi the Lord God's
[1:23:45] taken her home and guess what she passed
[1:23:47] away now someone might the the people
[1:23:51] will say well it's not hard to predict
[1:23:52] someone's going to die of cancer well I
[1:23:54] agree agree brother brandom agreed but
[1:23:56] the point that was made is that all the
[1:23:57] preachers were saying she was going to
[1:23:59] be healed brother brandom was the only
[1:24:00] one that was saying no she's going to go
[1:24:02] she's going to
[1:24:03] pass that's why that's an important
[1:24:07] prophecy brother brand said in 1965
[1:24:09] anointed ones he said it's thus sayith
[1:24:12] the Lord them denominations will never
[1:24:15] break up they'll never come back to the
[1:24:17] word it's thus sayith the Lord they
[1:24:19] won't they'll go into the
[1:24:21] Antichrist that's fulfilled show me one
[1:24:24] denomination that's ever broken up and
[1:24:26] say we're no longer going to be
[1:24:27] methodists we're going to come back and
[1:24:28] be message Believers and believe all the
[1:24:30] Bible the exact opposite is what's
[1:24:31] happening now they're letting
[1:24:33] homosexuals preach to
[1:24:35] them praise God
[1:24:38] Amen fourth brother Ram said I see I see
[1:24:41] the church in America dancing to rock
[1:24:43] and roll I think I told you this one
[1:24:44] before right my mom was raised in the
[1:24:46] Assembly of God and my mom said they
[1:24:49] only played piano that was in the 50s
[1:24:51] and 60s she was born 1950
[1:24:55] and she thought I never thought in uh uh
[1:24:58] 60 no it'd be 50 years later around the
[1:25:01] year 2000 my mom went to the Assembly of
[1:25:03] God conference the teen
[1:25:05] conference and where all the teenagers
[1:25:07] go and they try to make them like
[1:25:09] dedicate their lives to God and think
[1:25:11] they're saved a lot of times they're not
[1:25:13] and she said I saw rap there they were
[1:25:15] rapping about Jesus and then rock and
[1:25:18] roll came a few years later and now they
[1:25:19] have hard I mean just crazy Wicked Music
[1:25:23] and that's what brother r said brother
[1:25:24] said I saw the Church of United States
[1:25:26] dancing to rock and roll and the women
[1:25:28] were basically almost naked right and
[1:25:30] that's what we see in churches today
[1:25:32] brother Ram predicted it in
[1:25:34] 1965 thus sayith the Lord it came to
[1:25:37] pass how many are thankful for a prophet
[1:25:39] of God hallelujah amen my I told my mom
[1:25:43] I said Mom you she don't believe in
[1:25:45] brother brand but I said you've
[1:25:46] literally seen this come to pass mom I
[1:25:49] said mom please get out of the Assembly
[1:25:50] of God denomination and she's still in
[1:25:53] there but we're still praying by God's
[1:25:54] Grace it's up to God brother Ram said
[1:25:57] Just remember thus sayith the Lord there
[1:25:59] will never in no more Gentile Church age
[1:26:01] ever see any sign to succeed this go
[1:26:04] greater this is the last sign to the
[1:26:06] church thus sayith the Lord what a
[1:26:09] statement Amen brother braham's sign was
[1:26:12] to have people come in the prayer lines
[1:26:14] you've read about it right you've
[1:26:15] listened to it and tell them all the
[1:26:17] secrets of their heart brother R said if
[1:26:19] anything Rises greater than this you can
[1:26:20] call me a false prophet thus sayith the
[1:26:22] Lord
[1:26:24] and nothing has even come close I met
[1:26:26] two people that came in the prayer lines
[1:26:29] and brother Ram didn't know them brother
[1:26:30] R told them the secrets of their heart
[1:26:32] they got
[1:26:33] well and uh of course there's other
[1:26:35] people that know many more right they
[1:26:37] they know more people than I do but I'm
[1:26:39] just a witness I met them it was
[1:26:41] Supernatural not only did he have the
[1:26:43] word he also had the gift of discernment
[1:26:45] praise God brother calls it the sign of
[1:26:48] the Messiah because that's what Jesus
[1:26:50] did Jesus discerned the thoughts of
[1:26:52] Nathaniel's heart I saw you under the
[1:26:54] fig tree before he called you John
[1:26:57] chapter 1 he told the woman at the well
[1:26:59] you're right you don't have a husband
[1:27:00] you've had five and the one you're
[1:27:01] living with is not your husband either
[1:27:04] she said I perceive you're a prophet
[1:27:06] hallelujah amen the sign of a messiah
[1:27:11] that's what brother R he told that woman
[1:27:12] uh Marilyn hickey's her name I see you
[1:27:14] can't have children you're from some
[1:27:16] mountainous area Denver thus say the
[1:27:18] Lord if you believe you'll have a baby
[1:27:21] 10 years later she had a baby Hallelujah
[1:27:24] that's the same Jesus from John chapter
[1:27:26] 1 and John chapter 4 how do you know cuz
[1:27:28] he preached the same word the same water
[1:27:32] baptism hope I'm not wearing you out
[1:27:34] today hope you feel good by God's grace
[1:27:36] look at this one brother said thus
[1:27:37] sayith the
[1:27:39] Lord this is the
[1:27:40] 1962 look what's happening down through
[1:27:43] the years she'll continue to strip
[1:27:45] herself he said that's thus sayith the
[1:27:48] Lord can't we all see women contining to
[1:27:50] strip themselves they got yoga pants and
[1:27:52] bikinis and even less than bikinis
[1:27:54] whatever they call those things brother
