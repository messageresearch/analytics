TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends and the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to emphasize the importance for Christians to have a morning routine in order to fulfill Jesus's command in Matthew 6:33 but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you there's a lot of morning routine videos on YouTube some of which I've enjoyed to an extent but most don't mention God's Word about this subject I felt led to approach this subject through a biblical perspective during this video I want to make seven points about a morning routine including my personal tips for maintaining your morning routine point number one a morning routine includes prayer singing Bible reading and discussion in order to obey Jesus's command to seek ye first the kingdom of God you learn from Jesus's own example to seek God first right away in the morning mark 1 verses 34 and 35 shows how Jesus rose up a great while before day in order to get in a private place to pray even after doing many miracles the day before this proves no matter how miraculous a ministry is the gifted servant of God must immediately humble himself in private prayer to crucify the lusts of the flesh pride of life and the lust of the eyes in order to overcome temptations Moses's Tabernacle in the wilderness had morning and evening sacrifices which included burning incense exodus 30 verse 7 and Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning when he dresses the lamps he shall burn incense upon it david says incense represents prayer in Psalms 141 verse 2 psalms 141 verse 2 let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice the Shema Israel's traditional morning and evening prayer includes the commands to discuss God's commands at night in the morning and throughout the day Deuteronomy 6 7 and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou rises up David a man after God's own heart wrote songs about his love to seek God early in the morning through prayer and singing Psalms 5 verse 3 my voice shalt thou hear in the morning O Lord in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and will look up Psalms 5517 evening and morning and at noon will I pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my voice Psalm 63 1 a psalm of David when he was in the would earn Asada oh God thou art my god early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee and a dry and thirsty land where no water is Psalm 63 7 my heart is fixed o God my heart is fixed I will sing and give praise a wake up my glory awake psaltery and harp I myself will awake early I will praise thee O Lord among the people I will sing unto thee among the nations point number two a morning routine begins by winning the battle of the mind becoming a Christian enlists you in God's army and you're instantly engaged in spiritual warfare and the battlefield is your mind in second Corinthians chapter 10 Paul says we are in a spiritual war but God has given us mighty weapons to cast down imaginations and every thought that goes against God's Word your mind is one of your three parts as man is a three-part being body human spirit or mind and soul your human spirit or mind is your consciousness we're thinking takes place and where all decisions are made your mind gets messages from both the soul and body the soul sends the message to commune with God meeting the spiritual needs the body sends messages to meet the physical needs so your mind is like a battlefield where Satan attacks you shooting arrows of Lies trying to influence you to meet only the physical needs the way to win the battle of the mind is to gird up the loins of your mind with truth as Peter and Paul say in 1st Peter 1:13 and Ephesians 6:14 1st Peter 1:13 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ Ephesians 6:14 stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness notice the loins gird about with truth are the first part of the Christians armor that Paul mentions every morning you must first win the battle of the mind each morning you must choose truth Jesus says the truth makes you free in John 8:32 the truth is you are in a spiritual battle and you're either getting stronger for Christ or weaker when you choose to believe and act upon truth you will begin to prepare for the spiritual battles for the day and carry out christ's orders for each day you will first meet the spiritual needs of your soul and then God promises to meet your natural needs point number three a morning routine helps keep your soul aimed at Christ in his kingdom to prove this point let's look at Matthew 6:33 in context Jesus is describing out most people seek food drink and clothes obtaining these necessities consumes their thinking but Jesus says seek first his kingdom I'll define his words the Greek word for seek is zto which means to seek for a met strive after ie require demand to crave demands something from someone Jesus is saying aim first strive first crave first for my kingdom where does the desire to seek Jesus come from again man has three parts body spirit and soul according to 1st Thessalonians 5:23 so it has to come from one of these parts friend your desires come from your soul your body has natural desires which Jesus mentioned food drink and clothing your spear or mine thinks plans reasons remembers and more but your desires come from your soul which is your nature Isaiah says the desire of our soul is to thy name with my soul have I desire thee in the night if you're seeking God first everyday your soul has peace with Christ the reason you may not be seeking God first is because your soul is not right with God so quickly repent say you're sorry to God and ask him to create in you a clean heart with a pure desire next the Greek definition of Kingdom is Dominion or rule Jesus says aim first for my Dominion or rule in your life Jesus is saying do not be dominated by seeking the gain of natural food drink and clothes aim to be dominated by searching and gaining spiritual food drink and clothing which is Christ's righteousness in your soul feed the inward desire to gain the Holy Ghost rule over your life next jeez says seek his righteousness in the Greek righteousness means integrity virtue purity of life rightness correctness of thinking feeling and acting Jesus says first seek aim and strive to be inwardly ruled by my integrity virtue purity or correct acting have Jesus meet your spiritual needs first and then he promises to meet your natural needs this reminds us of Peters words in 2nd Peter 1 verses 5 to 8 in which the Apostle tells us to give all diligence to add Christ character qualities to our being such as faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and charity you are seeking Christ's righteousness when you are asking God to add these qualities to your character notice in the next verse after the C key first command Matthew 6:34 Christ says don't worry about tomorrow just focus on today's spiritual needs take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof seeking Jesus's kingdom first is also called giving him preeminence or first place in your life Jesus wants 1st place in all things according to Colossians 1:18 Jesus deserves 1st place in your life in mine Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence the Holy Ghost wants the daily rule your mind and attitude finances health relationships family work life or school life and every other area for his glory in summary you learn Matthew 6 3 means this see key first aim first for the kingdom of God the rule or dominance of the Holy Ghost baptism and his righteousness his integrity virtue purity or correct acting and all these things food drink and clothes shall be added unto you point number four a morning routine is your opportunity to seek wisdom the principle thing as one of my recent video show Jesus says you will be one of two kinds of Christians wise are foolish according to Matthew 25 verses 1 to 13 for wise virgins a synonymous phrase for wisdom might be the perfect will of God the Holy Spirit through Solomon in proverbs 4 7 urged believers to seek or get wisdom above all else which agrees with Jesus's Sikhi first teaching therefore wisdom tells you to seek God first which obviously points to making our search for wisdom the first thing to do each and every day God's Word shows us we need to have a Christ centered and Kingdom seeking morning routine scripture has much to say on wisdom the Hebrew word for wisdom means skillful shrewdness so you learn wisdom is skillful decision making or intelligent judgment our God highly values wisdom proverbs 4 7 says wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding wisdom is the principle or chief thing or the beginning thing or the first thing a Christian needs to get this might remind you of another scripture psalms 111 verse 10 the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom the fear of the Lord is a healthy respect and reverence for God that causes you to constantly humble yourself recognize your littleness and remember Christ's awesome terrifying power you will become wise as you constantly remember how awesome God is and how weak and little you are but know this is a character trait you need to get according to proverbs 4 7 the way to get wisdom is to see God for it point number five a morning routine helps you redeem your time knowing it is Jesus's command and not a suggestion in Matthew 6:33 to seek God's kingdom and righteousness first you begin to see the importance of your time we all know there are a few things as precious as time Paul teaches the wise redeemed their time in Ephesians 5 14 through 17 and Colossians 4 verses 5 & 6 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give the light see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fool's but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will the Lord is walk and wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time let your speech be alway with grace seasoned with salt that you may know how ye ought to answer every man redeeming in the Greek means to buy up to buy up for oneself for one's use to make wise and sacred use of every opportunity for doing good so that zeal and well doing are as it were the purchase money by which we make the time our own all the time in your life is precious Paul says we must be wise with how we use our time it's our responsibility to use time for God's glory according to the Bible you can either be wise or foolish with your time wise Christians will daily seek first God's kingdom the inward ruling of the Holy Ghost wise Christians start their day seeking first Christ's integrity virtue purity and correct acting foolish Christians won't make the best use of their time they will seek natural needs first before seeking spiritual needs of Jesus's kingdom point number six a lack of a morning routine may reveal a lukewarm spiritual condition it's crucial to note that one of the greatest rebukes in the Bible is Jesus's chastisement of the rich Laodicean Church in revelation three verses 16 and 17 so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked in verse 16 Christ tells this church he is spewing them out of his mouth meaning they can no longer be his mouthpiece and speak for him because they are lukewarm it's true many churches today do not speak for Jesus Christ because they are lukewarm and feel no more need for Jesus's wisdom Jesus says this church cares more about physical needs than spiritual needs and are become wretched miserable poor blind and naked they need nothing from Jesus they prefer riches natural gold or money more than trial tested Gold of faith like Peter speaks of in 1st Peter 1:17 they lust after fancy clothes yet are spiritually naked lacking the white raiment of Christ righteous character a corner revelation 19 verse 8 thir they're spiritually blind rejecting the anointing of the Holy Spirit I self and cannot see or understand the kingdom of God because they are not born again like John 3 verse 3 says jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see or understand the kingdom of God which group of Christians are you associated with those interested in the physical needs gold or money fancy clothes and lust of the eyes or spiritual needs time-tested faith Christ's righteous people I cite point number seven here's four helpful tips for a christ-centered morning routine number one take care of your body meaning go to bed earlier so you can wake earlier each morning I begin with drinking lots of water to hydrate my body some mornings I'll do a little exercise like push-ups or squats to wake up my body it's also important to eat healthy and limit sugar intake for example I quit drinking pop about 20 years ago ii begin with prayer and the bible meaning get alone with god in your closet and pray to God just as Jesus commanded make a prayer list if needed play a worship song as you pray and sing along to glorify Christ then read a chapter in your Bible to feed your soul even daily journaling what you've learned and your questions number three avoid phone addiction meaning make something else your alarm clock rather than your smartphone or tablet I use my watch as my alarm keeping my phone turned off all night this helps me start the day without wasting time on social media or other apps and number four write out your goals meaning invest in a cheap journal and write out your goals each night and morning to increase your focus I've learned this through Michael Hyatt and John Maxwell in closing I hope this video was
