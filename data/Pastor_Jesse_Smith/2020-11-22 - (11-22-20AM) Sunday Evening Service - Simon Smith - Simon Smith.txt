and I'm going to be to be that singing you will he never be glorious and God will be [Music] let's go to uh first John 3:7 okay all right sounds good praise the Lord um let's head to uh First John 3 First John 3 verse 7 I read these scriptures by the grace of God we go into a little subject tonight 1 John 3:7 says little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil verse eight uh for the sin sinth or from the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of God do not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil exactly ties in Matthew 133 with the parable there yes and the interpretation uh whosoever does not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous man say say a word of Prayer Yes dear father Lord Jesus Lord we certainly come humbly Lord and reverently before you Lord Jesus Lord and Lord we thank you Lord for all that you've done Lord and Lord Jesus Lord the we are extremely happy Lord for the exceedingly precious promises you have for your bride in this last day Lord as many as the prophet uh spoke and how he said that if there's one day he want to live it be this day and Lord Jesus and that's because Lord You're Going to manifest Lord uh like you want to manifest Lord there will be a group of people Lord on the face of the Earth here God who be so yielded God and so uh Desir us Lord of your will that Lord they become dead to themselves literally Lord and and Lord they just walking vessels Lord walking tools for you Lord little Christ Lord little jesuses Messiahs Lord God that want to do your will Lord and fulfill your last uh bit of your plan for this hour and for this uh dispensation Lord and Lord just bless all the saints Lord for showing up Lord and uh we pray Lord you just be with the service Lord Speak Lord how you would want to speak God lord may we yield for it in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats there so this evening and it's evening because it's dark out when it's dark I get sleepy even if it's 4:00 and have [Laughter] my wife knows yeah that son is [Music] [Laughter] powerful um so uh want to thank brother Jesse for the kind words there after service and that was very fine uh um but I believe that brother Jesse's a very very gifted brother and I've never heard it quite so plain put his on his debate the brother was on his Sid side Jesse pretty much leads in the Apologetics of the message he has tape and video after video after tape after tape breaking down doctr as best as possibly can be done and we're thankful for that then if anyone in the message has a question on Doctor how many Souls have been touched by those videos I watched many of them even in Thailand just to refresh on a certain subject before I teach it and may God bless brother Jesse there's a lot of of uh a lot of uh riches that there'll be you'll see on the other side for those things U anyhow we're going to get into the topic here we read the scripture here just dealing obviously with Cain um and God's children the devil's children uh so we want to dive back in here to maybe the The Trail Of The Serpent and we'll have the the sub chop topic is Children of what so um you'll see at the in here it's uh very very simple but we want to let the Lord speak and amen there might be a little graphic things we're going to share tonight because we're heading down this Trail there's nothing good on this Trail there's absolutely nothing good on this Trail I mean literally I mean I mean the other Trail we could follow maybe the trail of the Lamb which is Christ and his children the Sheep Trail the trail of sheeps wool growing up like this 70 lbs of wool on me just cut me off and then I'm back to thin again so it's um garments clothing everything is made out of wool keeps you warm all those things I don't know maybe brother Jess will pick up on that um so we're going to deal with the trail of The Serpent and uh I want to hit this scripture because I noticed uh you know we know that when um God had dealt with Cain and Abel there and and then Cain to do did what he did and then uh God comes to Cain and um you know Cain never killed or God never killed Cain he just put a mark on him and and treat him treated him you know like a vigilante like a prisoner you know he was he was guilty and God made him feel like that he actually carried past a sentence and and he did those sort of things um but I want want you to read this here and we'll hit that last scripture there Matthew 13: 24 another Parable put he forth saying unto them Kingdom of Heaven the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man which SED good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and so tears among the wheat and went his way right he says but when the blade was sprung forth and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also so the Servants of the householder came and said to him sir did thou not so good seed in thy field from whence ha then hath the tears and he said to him an enemy has done this the servant said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather up but he said nay lest we while lest while we gather up the tears ye root up also the wheat with them now no look look look what he says here in verse 30 let both grow together until the end God does not even kill the tears he allows them to grow there's no judgment passed here there's nothing that says kill them Angels take them out shed their blood wipe them out of all existence no God says let them both grow there's no anger with Christ here there's no judgment here and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together the first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my bar amen sure yes uh now as we jump obviously to the interpretation Jesus said to him he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man the kingdom is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the Wicked on so we see we have two sets of seed lines here we know the serpent seed and God's seed right absolutely yes um so now um there's many prophecies uh and and things said about this seed line um and we're going to cover some of these by the grace of God tonight notice in John 16:1 says these things have I spoken unto you that you should not be offended they shall put you out of the synagogues y the time cometh that whosoever kth you will think that he doeth God serves right think of the very mindset someone has to the the the amount the level of deception that someone has to come under a delusion that someone must come under to actually think this right you think of hunters you think of uh men uh looking for big game uh they are they are going to get a prize right if I was hungry back 150 years ago I would have to go hunting for like maybe a raccoon or or or a beaver in America a deer you know whatever but I would be hunting it and I would have to kill it to eat it right now this kind of this kind of killing is not uh to to to uh suffice hunger outside of a bloodthirsty hunger this here is they literally are con vinced by Satan himself by the Devil by them demons that that that they are doing the very will of God right sure they're not to eat there but they think that they are performing a religious Duty a religious act something a service to God that no one else but them can do no one it's their personal revelation I know what it looks like it's it's it's disgusting it's bloody but it's a revelation it's it's what we're supposed to do is take out these Heretics and these things they they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me if it goes this far to where they take someone's life they have never even met God right amen amen sure now look what the Bible says here in Isaiah 591 he says behold the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear but your iniquities have separated between you and your God I'm not talking about this church I'm just talking to to the loss in general he says and your sins have have hid your his face from you and he will not hear you hear you for your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies he says your tongue have muttered perverseness none call for judgment or sorry Justice nor any pleading for truth they trust in vanity and speak lies he says they conceive mischief and bringeth forth iniquity this is all part of their little seed line there right right sure he says they hatch cockatrice his eggs and weave a spider's web so they bring forth these eggs and they start weaving what Spider's webs and those webs are what for traps to catch prey to devour he that eateth their eggs dieth notice it said they bring forth these eggs and someone if they were to eat these eggs they would actually die then that which is crust breth out into a v a Viper right but notice what I like how Barnes hits this he says he that eateth their eggs dieth that is he who partaketh in their counsels or in their plans which they form Shall Perish right Calvin said to the meaning says that whatsoever had that whosoever had anything to do with them would find themselves in destruction and wow whatever word that is similar phrases comparing the plans of a wicked of the Wicked with the eggs and The Brood of the serpent are common in common in the East it is said uh says Roberts speaking of India of the plans of a decidedly Wicked and talented men we're not dealing with people who are not intelligent or people that just some bum off the street but these are the high esteemed in society these guys got degrees and and Men of renown and those sort of things he says look he says these men he says no talented and wicked look what is said of them that wretch he hatches Serpent's eggs seeing a saying in the East Beware of the fellow his eggs are nearly hatched he says Ah my friend touch not Affair that Affair meddle not with that matter there is a serpent in the Shell these are sayings over there in the East dealing with serpents and their eggs absolutely sure So reading that once again he says they cat they hatch the these ideas and plans what and these ideas are plans for traps and then people decide to to do these things and whatever he says and then once and if it's and if one is crushed and it brings forth a serpent sure nothing but Bad Evil to from Evil to evil to evil to evil sure yes he says and their webs shall not become garments they don't want themselves to get in the Trap but they're sending them traps for others he says neither shall they cover themselves with their works if they do this evil thing they don't want have it even reflecting upon them as the Bible says in in proverbs 30 and 20 it says the the adulterous women wipe their mouth and says I've done no wickedness they don't want to take any blame for anything they've done Oh my he says their works are works of iniquity and the act of violence is in their hands their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood and their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and destruction are in their paths wherever if you could follow these people all you'll see is a ruins yes everything's destroyed wastelands uh howling forest or or deserts and fires everywhere it's just destroy them these people right the way of peace they know not and there is no judgment in their going they have Made Them Crooked pass whosoever goeth there shall not know uh shall not know peace amen sure now look what it says here in Romans 3 and12 he says they are all gone out of the way and there they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good know not one the Bible says right says their Thro is an open SE culture with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of Ashes their lips their mouth is full of cursings and bitterness their feet uh are Swift to shed blood look murder is always right there taking innocent life is always there he says destruction and misery are in their ways and the way of peace they have not known there is no fear of God before their eyes right right right what kind of children are these they're destructive right they're just yes and the only thing that separates us is the seed right that's it we have a seed of God within us and that is what does the SE God that's it through thousands of years these two seed lines have mingled in and out mingled this way mingled that way form this and more that and now we don't know who's a who we don't know what we we we can't even distinguish anything but what the word of God always makes manifest yes when the word of God is presented the truth is presented to someone they have now a choice to say well that's true or that's not right yes sir and a lot of time that's their choice right there yes sir uh but Jo jumping here to Matthew 23 and 13 it says notice this is the very first woe woe number one I had a dog and sometimes she would bark and she'd go whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa that's just how she spoke W wowow wowow CH relax that's just something in Matthew 23:13 he says but woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites he says look notice one of the first things they do for ye shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men what was one of the first things the Catholic Church did they shut up the kingdom of heaven if you get baptized wrong you're going to have the wrong results if you believe in a false god you'll never make Heaven oh my first thing they did was shut the Kingdom of Heaven yes right why would they change baptism because that baptism guarantees the Holy Ghost and when you get the Holy Ghost you'll start living the Christian Life and displaying Christ on the scene and destroying the devil's Kingdom and they had to figure out how to shut it down so they switch what the baptism name for titles right simple and how many have they killed this way spiritually right billions upon billions upon billions I just last month I had just listened to 50 years in a church in Rome on the way to work uh I I was driving an hour one way and an hour back and I was able to get through that entire book listen to it Charles Chinle saints of God the Catholic that that church is just you can't there's nothing good to say about it yes there's literally nothing good to say about it you know your mom always said hey uh if you ain't got nothing good to say don't say none at all you have that is pretty much what it is what did Christ say in the first seven Church ages Revelations 2 and three about that situation he said nothing good right yeah right right he said for a spa I even gave he said God said he I even gave her a space of time much longsuffering that she could repent but she repented not right what if God waited a thousand years after persecution after persecution after persecution and God waited for the her repentance he never did yes sir amen it goes through eight woes the seventh woe and then of course the eighth goes back to the beginning right you know what took place with Cain and that's the beginning the eighth woe woe unto you scribes and Pharisees and hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garish the sub cultures of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of their prophets now Christ is saying this has come out of your mouth that this is your testimony that these were your daddies and your masas and your great grandpas and all those things this is your seed line yes yes he's obviously quoting them he says wherefore ye be Witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets Christ is blasting out their seed line he's blasting out the trail he says just look at your GE geology or genealogy how Bloody are is your family but notice look at that he said that's good he said he said you your your fathers have done an absolutely a horrible job and that's right but now look what he tells them he says fill ye up the measure of your fathers if your daddy's going to do it you're going to do it too and then he calls them what Adam should have said when Eve called Cain a man from the Lord you know Eve said I've gotten a man from the Lord and the first Adam was silent he never corrected his wife but when the second Adam come he calls him exactly what it is yes amen amen he says ye serpents ye Generation of Vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell they could never be saved right yes now notice here he says ye serpents you generation how can you escape the damn Nation now wherefore behold I sended you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them you shall kill and crucify and some of them shall you Scourge in the synagogues and persecute them from City to city or from church age to church age this is he what he says he he say behold I send unto you prophets amen that's future tense absolutely they ran him all the way from Ephesus all the way to right now and theyve persecuted him exactly as Christ said yes sir amen that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the Earth from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of barakus whom he slew between the temple and the altar all that blood was compounding year after year after year on that seed line yes uh I think brother Jesse and brother cam had actually started preaching on curses and blessings at the exact same time without even kn the other and I watched the man he said he said you know generational curses start from one person in your seed line one daddy or one Mama that hates God and that takes on a curse and that curse then is passed on to the next Generation until maybe a seed of God comes up and stops the curse but this seed line that servant SE like continues to go on and on and on and on curses piling up the Bible says in second Peter calls them cursed children right right sure he says ver say to you all these things shall come upon this generation in other words he said they've killed so much there's coming a stopping point the Jewish people have killed God's prophets and and all and scribes and all those holy men he sent them for thousands of years he said then there's coming a stopping point when and I believe the historians say this is when what Titus or Nero however uh come in and Destroy Jerusalem it's done fulfilled right then and he wiped them out and they've been uh homeless for almost 2,000 years and now that God is restoring them back amen so now as I was listening to 50 years in the Church of Rome you know the the church the Catholic church is the absolute it's not even uh uh the priests it's not even the the monks or the arch Bishops and Cardinals it is the holy fathers they say and their teachings go all the way back to the original holy fathers and as Chinle was looking at the they said they said chin you're leaning too much you sound like a Protestant he's like I'm just reading the Bible he says well you need to quit reading that to read the Holy fathers he says and say what they say so chally put down the Bible he started reading the holy fathers you know what he found out about the fathers none of them agreed on anything and he told them he told he was pretty bold to his uh upper guys he said he said hey they don't even agree with one another he said well well then they dive off into another Rabbit Trail they always bypassed or sidestep the question right right like they always do but as he was reading the holy fathers I'll say like this why would why would the Catholic Church be such murder why would they why would the Jesuits and all those things exist so prevalently right because one of the Holy fathers was Thomas aquinus quinius or whatever you're called he says so according to this Thomas guys the issue at stake is the defined doctrines and the dogma of the Roman Catholic church if you knowingly contradict the papacy and doctrines of the Pope as the pope defines them then you are classified as a heretic okay so how many Heretics we have in here right all absolutely will always be following the following are four possible observations that that about tolerating Heretics they actually tolerate us the reason they did not take over in the 1800s in the in in Canada was because they were outnumbered by the Protestants and they've had many many uh the Protestants have had even the Catholic people themselves have had many many overthrows of priests and Catholics and those sort of things so they had to watch they could only go so far because and Chin kept warning the priest they said guys if we keep doing this if you guys keep doing this they're going to kill us because they did it in France they did it in this country they did that country because the people get tired right right nobody likes living under a dictator no people like their freedom people like to be happy people like to have joy in their life right yes with the question now whether Heretics should be tolerated here's what he answers it seems that Heretics ought to be tolerated for the Apostle says in second Timothy the servant of the Lord must not Wrangle or with modesty admin them with that resist the truth if pre-venture God may give them repentance to know the truth and they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil now if Heretics are not tolerated but put to death they lose the opportunity of repentance they use the same same scriptures we use therefore it seems contrary to the apostles command oh so they have tolerance with us he says furthermore whatsoever is necessary in the church should be tolerated now heresies are necessary in the church since the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians 1 or sorry 11 and 19 uh there must be heresies uh that they who are uh reproved uh may be made manifest among you therefore it seems Heretics should be tolerated okay okay there's another scripture further the master commanded his servants in Matthew 13 and3 to suffer the cockles to to grow until the Harvest so they're calling us then see see look it shows that God what has has uh or that they should as God let them grow that we should let them grow as well he says therefore Heretics should be tolerated on the contrary the Apostle says Titus 31011 a man that is heretic after the first and second admonition avoid knowing that he such a one is a is subverted okay so this is how they dial in whether somebody's a heretic I seen you didn't bow down to the pope yesterday's like yeah that's right and I call him out one time and I go back and say the next day like hey Mass you didn't down B down to the pop again I gave him two admition admonitions boom you're out of here I'm not going to talk to you anymore and that's how they that's how they did they did things right so and then at that time then you would be declared a heretic okay I'm just picking you know it's just story so once a heretic is is determined now they come to the question now what these what these holy fathers are is a bunch of books his books are specifically are like a bunch of questions and he answers each question it's like questions Q&A yeah now Thomas a queen's opinion on what should be done with Heretics this every priest everyone moving into the clergy of the Catholic Church reads these this is what they must do this is their Viewpoint they must listen to The Holy fathers I answer that with regards to regard to Heretics two points must be observed one on their own side the other on the side of the church on their own side there is the sin whereby they deserve not only to be separated from the church by excommunication but also to be severed from the World by death for it is much Graver matter to corrupt the faith that quickens which quickens the soul than to forge money which supports temporal life wherefore if forgers of money and other evildoers are forth with condemned to to death by the secular Authority look how look how slickly how they bring this a natural criminal is put to death what about the spiritual most important spiritual thing in the world is much more reason is there for Heretics as soon as they are convicted of heresy to not only be commuted but even put to death and this is what chinik admit even put it in his book this is what they are taught from day one but they cannot do it a lot of times out in the open or in public because they're just outnumbered on the part of the church whether there is Mercy which looks to the conversion of The Wanderer whether she condemns uh she condemns not at once or after the first and second admonition as the Apostle directs after that um if he is yet stubborn the church no longer hoping for his conversion when do we give up on people we never give up on Souls unless the Holy Spirit allow Quicken something to us don't pray for him right there's a time I our old Pastor brother Brooks he was talking to a certain brother and the Holy Spirit said that's a serpent and he left them alone let's read hold he says after that if ye if he is yet stubborn the church no longer hoping for his conversion looks to the Salvation of others by excommunicating him and separating from the church and furthermore delivers them to the secular tribunal a worldly one but I thought the church was supposed to judge oh my to be exterminated therefore thereby from the World by death for Drome come there's another church father Jerome right commented on Galatians 5 and9 a little 11 says cut off the decayed flesh expelled The Mangy sheep from the fold lest the whole house the whole Pace the whole body the whole flock burn perish die rot twisting the scriptures completely distorting misinterpreting the word of God how in the world can you get that from this when the Bible says to deliver such a one up to Satan amen and let what Satan deal with his flesh what that his soul might be saved amen they they take one scripture but they leave the rest out they can't even rightly divide the word of God right amen God help now we're going to move into this here there's in in a couple slides you're going to see something and uh if if the tactics are the same the tactics will remain in it'll happen exactly now let's just go into this a little bit here on August 24th 1572 the bloody St Bartholomew Massacre began this was to be the final blow to destroy the Protestant movement in France the king of France had cleverly arranged a marriage between his sister and Henry of nvar head of the Protestant Army so they arranged this without anyone knowing there was a great feast with much celebrating after four days of Fe in the soldiers were given a signal and an hour before Dawn all the houses of the Protestants in the city were forced open at once Admiral so and so the chief Protestant leader was killed his body thrown out of the window into the street his uh head was cut off sent to the pope uh everything and he was hung outside the city is the Catholic Church the same or has it changed this morning we talked about a trap being set they also slaughtered many well-known Protestants in the first three days over 10,000 were killed the bodies were thrown at the river blood ran through the streets into a river until it into a river until it appeared like a stream of blood so Furious was their rage that they even slew their own followers if they suspected they were not very strong in the faith in the Pope I had just witnessed to a young man or a I'm sorry a Catholic man in June and we sat together at lunch and we' go back and forth and he'd question me and i' question him and it was fun because I not fun but it was it was interesting we got to lock swords and I said sir I said would you bow down he goes he he made a comment he say I'll never bow down any man and then the next day I brought it up and I said you said you wouldn't bow down to would you ever bow down to the pope he said absolutely not he's just a man he'd be killed right right he's not a solid cat right right ruthless cold blood from Paris the destruction spread to all parts of the country over 8,000 more people were killed very few PRS escaped the fury of their persecutors now watch this watch this next one here this one's this one is a similar Massacre occurred in Ireland in 1641 the conspirators picked October 23rd the Feast of ignacius lyola the founder of the Jes order did you know igna or what's it called Ignatius Loy lyola he actually had to he actually developed a system for the Jesuits in in which he would work himself up into like a into like a fleshly carnal uh spiritual kind of Rage or just some kind of thing where he was like in a Euphoria and that's how they train their Jesuits you you have to read the book but uh it's pretty interesting how they he got into that he says they planned a general Uprising for the whole country the entire country at Mass they would secretly talk to each other the around the entire country send letters to Catholics all done secretly all Protestants would be would be killed at once to throw them off guard while the plan was being made extra acts of kindness were shown to Protestants using sweetness man they are really good people he just gave me two pieces of pie strawberry even and a cake and last week he gave my children little Trinkets and toys early in the morning the conspirators were armed and every Protestant they could find was immediately murdered they showed no mer no mercy from children to the age they were killed even invalids were not spared they were caught by complete surprise a trap was sprung a snare was happening they had lived in peace and safety for years and now found no place to run they were massacred by neighbors friends and even relatives not trying to bring it down I'm just letting you know the severity we better make sure we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes sir that is the way out you will escape all these things if we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen now look the prophet say he said now don't be confused and start thinking that the Church of Rome has repented over her Slaughter of the Saints because she is attempting to unite the Protestants by making her Creeds to line up with Protestant Creeds not once has she ever apologized and said she was wrong for mass murders and she won't either and no matter how mellow and sweet she appears at this particular time he says she will yet to rise to kill for murder lies in her evil and unrepented heart we can say you know thus say the Lord for that because we know the Book of Revelations we know the laws that are going to be passed we know the exactly what's going to take place right amen now I don't know if any of you guys are familiar with this the Church outline of History by the church of centuries maybe brother Jesse he brought this out maybe I'm sure you have um saints of God do you think it would be possible that there would be a law come up in America that if you don't believe the Trinity you'll be killed I'll say like this there already is a law and it's in Maryland close to the Virgin Nia remember this brother just the law of Maryland concerning religion Maryland who's Mary this is from 1649 16:49 he says that whosoever person or persons within the Providence in the islands where to belonging shall henceforth blashe God that is to curse him and shall deny Our Savior Jesus Christ to be the Son of God or shall deny the Holy Trinity the father son holy ghost or the godhead or any of the three-fold persons of the Trinity or the UN Unity of the the godhead uh or shall utter any reproachable Spees words language concerning the Holy Trinity or of the said threefold persons thereof shall be punished with death and confiscation of foreclosure of all his lands Goods property everything's taken America 1649 unreal right it's already there killing because you don't believe the same thing that's literally what happens every day in America husband and wife start fighting and this and that and one wants this way one this way and one kills the other two brothers I heard there was a story over uh near my way two brothers were arguing about something one one and they're both living at home one took a gun and shot the other over a disagreement a disagreement a disagreement on what they want to believe it is so petty it is so minute it's just unreal what's now this is this one's from brother Jesse here unbelievers living just lives will be saved here back there and was it 2000 no yeah 2000 Pope John Paul II whatever said the gospel teaches that those who live in accordance with the Beatitudes the poor in spirit loving heart those who love bear lovingly the sufferings of of life will enter God's kingdom all who seek God With Us in your sincere heart including those who do not know Christ and his church contribute under the influence of grace to the building of his kingdom they'll all be saved any good person will be saved look at they lock the Kingdom of Heaven up to others one of the greatest deceptions is not uh uh other than this who I just heard a brother brother or somebody preached this one of the greatest deceptions in the church today is that they allow people to come and join church and tell them you're good to go you have arrived right pay your ties if you want to get baptized pray on it whatever if you don't want to that's fine you doesn't matter if you P just come to Church you're going to be you're going to make it one of the biggest deceptions there yes yes amen put your name on the book here's my handshake now who's this guy handsome guy Peter Brisa Brisa kind of mentality comes with these things uh he was a creian fascist and uh in criminal War of the second World War II yeah second war uh before the war he was a scholar a scholar High grades very intelligent sharp at The Franciscan College of wherever that is in Herz govina and a member of the great Brotherhood of the Crusaders before the war he was uh was a scholarship student there this then or whatever uh and uh the great Brotherhood of shers and organization part of the Croatian Catholic movement he spent some time studying law very smart uh in this place and he became a member of the aachi youth member and later became measure of the me member of the Croatian fascist and he end up being from 41 to 45 one of the guards at the one of the concentration camps like a smart guy good guy he looking clean clean faed while he is known for beating an inmate to death in March 1943 he is notorious for having a won a contest in which he in which he used a carve carve bladed knife also called a well to kill nearly to kill to kill near newly arrived concentration camp prisoners he boasted of winning the contest by killing the largest number of prisoners thir 1,360 people in a night what did he use use this such a type of wheat sheath knife for cutting down wheat Trail of the serpent plural let's just say that right that's right it always comes down to this now there was a contest they had a whole shipment of uh inmates come in I think Jews or whatever or at that point SS of God they were killing everybody okay they just had all these people whether Jews is I don't know I'm not sure who they all had uh but there's many people then an order came to exterminate them and the guards around there's multiple guards placed BS said I'll take more than you no I'll do more than you and they put all their money down now here's what a Catholic priest named uh jerk said today it is no longer to kill a child of seven should such a child be opposed to our movement of the usachi there is absolutely no respect for life right right they see you as nothing more than opposition uh now as this Peter guy was over killing all these people there was another man killing him he gave his testimony or I say this his word he he gave a a account of the night I just want to run through this because saints of God this is what we're dealing with when when when you get close to people of other faiths you watch you watch them you watch them and pray for them don't ever lean you know don't trust trust the Bible says curse is a man who puts his trust in man that's right we must put our trust in Jesus Christ amen amen in fact that man won he says uh uh having been proclaimed the prizeman of the competition he was elected King of the Cutthroats a gold watch a silver service I'm guessing oh Silver Service and a roasted suckling pig and wine were his Rewards or murder why because in the Catholics it's okay they're Heretics now here's another uh testimony of uh FR franovic mile he was one of the contestants in this little Throwdown Saturday 29th August 1942 uh Peter won it but now here's his testimony here uh or his account The Franciscan and I bet to see who would kill more prisoners in one night the killing began and after an hour I killed many more than them I felt in the seventh heaven SS of God this is insane I had never felt such ecstasy in my life after a couple hours I had managed to kill 1,100 people while the others were weren't even close and then as I was experiencing my grandest ecstasy I noticed an old peasant standing quietly watching me as watching me as uh as I killed my victims and them that had died with the greatest of pain some old man was just watching I know this is a little rough for the young ones but uh uh he looks and sees this old man watching while he's doing his thing um that look struck me in the middle of my greatest ecstasy and suddenly I froze and for a while I could not move he's killing just going insane and sees an old man just staring at him and he stops and he can't take his eye off then I approached him and discovered that he was from the village of and that his family had been murdered and sent to this Camp after work having having worked in the forest he spoke with me with some he spoke to me with some incomprehensible peace that affected me more than the heartbreaking screams All Around Me suddenly I felt a need to destroy his peace Through Torture and thus through his suffering I could restore my state of ecstasy in order to continue to pleasure of inflicting pain I pulled him aside and made him sit with me on a log I order him to shout long live this guy H or I cut your ear off the man did not speak I ripped out an ear I said say it again or I'll rip your other ear out I ripped the other out he shouts uh he shouts this or I rip your nose out and then I will uh told him the fourth time to shout that and threaten to pluck his heart with my knife and look what this man says he looked at me and in his pain and agony said do your work creature he didn't even call him a human he called him a creature a beast a natural brute Beast those words confused me froze me and then he goes on to finish his job but he says something broke inside me that I could not kill anymore that night and The Franciscan Petro brisna won the bet because he had killed uh so many prisoners and I paid without saying a word this is sick this is the Trail of a serpent or the serpents I say like this it's nothing but Bloodshed hatred and they like it it does something for them now ever know who this guy is schmucker's glorious Reformation I have this book in this fact I took pictures of it did you know the Catholic Church actually has their own Bible written according and they've changed scriptures he says uh now notice it says here says merely on the priests or kept as a secret among them in other words they have this little secret Bible they call the real Bible and they pass it amongst the priests in secret and they change the scriptures in order to carry on persecution the mass of the people must be at least in some degree prepared for it and therefore the only copies of the scripture which were permitted to be read by the people the the D Bible and The ramish Testament have so falsified the sacred volume as to make it teach some the same Doctrine and breathe The Same Spirit of hatred and blood against Protestants thus the latter has the following comments in other words this is he's now diving into the secret book he had come into Matthew in Matthew 3 Heretics must be punished and suppressed and may an ought by Public Authority either spiritual or temporal be chastised or executed that's in Matthew 3 the secret Catholic Bible Galatians 1 and8 Catholics should not spare their own parents if they are Heretics that's not what my G Colossians say Hebrews 5:7 the translators of the Protestant Bible ought to be abored to the depths of hell that's not what my Hebrews 5 and7 says mine starts out in the days of his flesh Revelations uh and then he goes on how that's uh Protestants say that this is them and of course it is revelation 17:6 drunken with the blood of the Saints Protestants says the comment foolishly expound this of Rome for that they put Heretics to death and allow and allow of their punishment in other countries he says but their Butchery of 15 millions of Indians in South America Mexico and Cuba by uh Spanish papis so know words he's kind of showing right there that uh that's what they are the Catholic church is drunken with the blood of the Saints and martys of Jesus Christ as I was thinking of this South America 15,000 of Indians in South America why are all these what you ever see those uh those stories of they go like people are exploring down by the Amazon and they they fall upon this big giant city that was covered by and they say well where did these people go so mysterious how they just disappeared or they came Mur murdered by the Jesuits back in the 1400s and 1500s now it's recorded in Smuckers go Reformation the Catholic church has guilty of 68 million Protestants okay right and you know where he got that number from he got that number from a man called William brownley okay now William brownley started he was actually adding up and calculating what actually the number could possibly be the population of Europe from 1100 to 1500 averaged about 65 million people if 1% of the population was sometimes burnt as witches per year one can assume that on the average of half a percent on the average half a percent of the population was slain each year as hers altogether this would amount to the average of about 300,000 persons killed per year for 400 years or 200 million persons totally killed during 400 years and most of those done was probably by the Catholic Church they ruled during Dark Ages you know that you remember how the test of the witch was that person's a witch oh yeah the test of a witch was to bind the person throw them in the water and if they floated they weren't a witch these figures do not even consider those killed in the new world and the non-christians killed in Europe and Asia for example referring to Bishop of uh Chap's account of the cruelty of the Spaniards in in America uh truly they went a a great way to make this remark literally true with regard to the new world when first found out for according to the account of one of their own Bishops in the space of 40 years they destroyed 50 million of people in the new world a Catholic priest admitted that and Smucker's low low estimate of 68 million is absolutely nothing it's just a small random number adding in these deaths might explain the commonly quoted figure of eight of a 100 million killed by the papacy adding in non-christians killed in Europe might explain some of the higher figures adding in the total killed assumed to the half of a percent killed in per year in Europe for 400 years but now you have about 200 million total killed omitting those killed in the new world would yield about uh 150 million this might explain why many common quotes figures come from in other words the people are saying oh oh oh Smucker's way low and they threw out these and this and this guy is saying yeah that's probably they're probably closer than smucker is smucker being very uh well he said those that are recorded there is another compulation that yields a 100 million killed by the papacy in Rish in the light of the prophecy and history it is its final downfall and the Triumph of the Church of Christ Brown Lee quotes a figure of 68 and a half milli killed by the papacy composed of 50 million Christians in Europe 15 million in Indians in the new world 15 million were killed by the Catholics I didn't even know that I thought they were starved out by the American Rich guys riding railroads shooting Buffalo no that wasn't even close to happen them or who knows what 1.5 million Jews in Spain and elsewhere and two million Moors in Spain then he writes then then this uh brownley writes and oh merciful Father in Heaven this does not include the millions of their own people and her enemies which fell in her Crusades and wars and massacre here 30 millions and a half would be a moderate calculation of their own people and saints of God how many nuns have died in in nunneries how many monks have been killed and and babies and all those things saints of God were into the probably billions let's just be honest 100 million of the human race by her bloody Reign by her bloody religion what does it say here in Revelations 18 and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the Earth of all that were slain every we know every war was instigated by like CH chinu says the majority of all wars were started by the Jesuits for gain for division to lower populations so that they could come back in and bring what they did was they after the Civil War they recruited a whole bunch of Catholics from overseas and to them reproduce I overpopulate cath exactly right I just talked with a certain brother yesterday and he said what do you think the Baby Boomers were the priest went in after the war and said start populating many men have died populate populate and now the the households went up to 8 10 15 children in the household and her was slain upon all the Earth so what are we getting at here what kind of children are these bless you in Exodus 20 and 13 the Bible says Thou shalt not kill amen Thou shalt not kill yes that is a commandment yeah amen Christ did not come to do away with the law but to fulfill the law did Christ kill anyone not one he didn't even kill Satan he let him live or any of the Demons he let him live what kind of children are these and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins whereof in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power there the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience yes if there's ever a scripture that says to do one thing a certain way they will always do it Opposite amen they will fail to hearken to the word of God they are children of Disobedience yes among whom also we had our conversation time passing the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by nature is the children of Wrath even as others Ephesians 5 and six let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of Disobedience what is the main I like this if you had to follow this seed line the main characteristic would they would always disobey the word of God Cain disobeyed the word of God even when revealed to him amen bam knew not the curse and yet he still did what he did yes complete Disobedience Esau when he found out this then he went married someone that he shouldn't even have married complete Disobedience as M wasn't even happy yes right does it say twice no what it says three times in the scripture the Bible calls them children of Disobedience mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication and cleanliness in ordinate affection evil concupisent and covetousness which is idul for these things sake the wrath of God cometh upon the children of Disobedience what is Disobedience much like iniquity yes what is Iniquity knowing to do right but not doing it what is what is Matthew 7 Lord Lord have we not done this and have we not done that and the Bible says he says I never knew you workers of iniquity that's right and yet these knew to do right they know it's wrong to do this it's wrong to do that they know it yes in which ye also walked sometimes when you lived in them thanks be to God we're out of that by the grace of God Amen let's just give our Lord and savior thank you for saving us Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus now now that's the natural that's absolutely natural and you can go through history I I just Dove a little bit on the internet just looking at things I I spent probably half an hour an hour maybe that's it just finding those little things what if we actually really just dove into it the the evidence is over overwhelming what the Catholic church has done yes I did read a couple Catholics and they oh that was that's just hearsay that's a Liars lie lie lie I'm to the point where you you look at everything in the news you look at everything I I question everything now literally even even the history that was taught uhh even science I I I question everything now what is truth you know what's truth is the word of God if there is a scientific theory that does not line up the word of God it is false straight up if there's anything that's contrary to the world this is is that's contrary to this it's a lie yes right this is our filter the word of God amen amen sure now the end result is always the Bloodshed but everything works up to it and you people with these sawblade tempers it's always spouting off of the mouth that somebody can't put up and things like that be careful he says he says you're guilty if you speak one word against your brother that's not right not just go around and tear go around and tear it down you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him he says kill his influence speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you just might as well shot him the Bible says touch not my anointing amen that's why communion is so he say communion is so important not Discerning the body of Christ what is the body of Christ you right right we must speak well to one another brothers and sisters love forgiving forgetting all we're all the same told something that wasn't right about him well you just killed his influence with the people and things like that and you're guilty of what Jesus said there as brother Jesse mentioned this morning there's something took place a year ago and it was literal spiritual an assassination it was a martyrdom a spiritual martyr I called the brother says brother I may not have suffered In the Flesh he says but I've been spiritually martyred I said absolutely brother and these men are guilty of bringing that brother down I don't know where he's at now but when I called him a year ago he had not said anything that was said about him amen got to be very very careful yes now look what the Bible says here he says if you have heard that hath been said an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you that ye resist he says that ye resist not evil don't even resist evil let it come he said but whato shall that who was that Martin wasn't there a man of two assassinations assassins coming get Martin and they stuck into his house and they about and they woke him up and he was startled he was on his bed and they were ready to cut his throat and held out a knife and Martin what did he resist and fleas and he said he stuck out his neck and says I'll see the Lord in moment of time and the power of God blew those two men back to the wall and they took got repented at his feet and got out of there he did not resist the evil oh my God help us we need the Holy Ghost to anoint us just like that amen we can be looking death right in the face and be like amen I know exactly where I'm going I'm going to see my Lord and Savior of God does not change this situation seem about to have all love and all joy and all excitement in a time like that oh that's what I want right there yeah when everything's against you your life could be on line this could be on line and you are just full of the joy of Jesus Christ man to be in that anointing all just to be right there yeah that's that's where we want to be right there i' I've had it happen a couple times just a couple times um he says but I say to you that you resist not evil whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn him the other also and if any man would sue thee at the law and take away their coat let him have thy cloak also and whatsoever shall compel thee to go a mile goeth in Twain give unto him that ask thee and from him that would borrow thee turn thou not away he says but you have heard it said that has said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy Christ corrects it but I say to you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you yes look at that is that Catholic that's not Catholic yes to love to bless that ye that ye may be the children of your notice this is this is the separation of the children right here this will prove who your daddy is this is this will proove what kind of child you are yes amen that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven amen amen he says for he that maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you slute your Breen only what should you do more than others do not even the publicans so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect you treat everyone like they are a son or seed of God everyone no matter what they even do to you no matter what is said they're Sons and Daughters of God Amen he says Marvel not my brethren if the world hates you we know that if we have passed from death into life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer hateth yes hateth didn't say kill him or guilty of his blood just hate it right is a murder why that will come out and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him this is coming down watch and Us in these a saints of God we know denominations are not going to rise again right you're not going to find true love out there right but now we watch your eyes within this message how do people treat one another how do Pastors treat other pastors how do Pastors treat sheep how do sheep treat pastors saints of God this is a what this is a checkpoint for the checking the Holy Ghost yes sir whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer someone that hates their brother ha not eternal life abiding in him yes what is eternal life the Holy Ghost yes whereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down our life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for our Brethren where's that scripture again yes amen amen praise be to God now let's stand here we're wow we're hour 10 let's stand here just a little run through here of that trail I hope you got to see what kind of trail that is and obviously I I I I did bring some stuff there that was a little maybe harder it's not be it's not a beautiful thing it's U it's reality it's what our forefathers fled many of them came to America running from that stuff running from real persecution wanting Freedom wanting those sort of things and uh as the prophet said he says they will rise again to kill and saints of God they are children of Disobedience that's constantly disobeying the word of God but saints of God if they are children of Disobedience that makes us the children of obedience amen amen when we read the scriptures when we read the word when we listen to tapes when we study when we think on the Lord we want to be obedient to the voice of God Amen we want to be obedient to the word of God we want to continue Lord give me more strength increase my faith yes show me what you'd have me to be glory because Christ himself had to learn obedience what is obedience laying down your own will not brother what brother Simon wants to do you don't want to do that you want to do what the Lord Jesus Christ wants you to do amen amen yes and being made perfect he became the author of eternal life sorry the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him so the way one of the ways to eternal life is through obedience amen amen and children these other children can never receive eternal life because they are not obedient yes that's simple the god of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you slew on a hang and hanged on a tree him ha God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his Witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to to them that obey him amen and when they heard when they heard that notice what realm it hit their flesh realm went to their hearing and it quickened something and they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them just by hearing this word of God just hearing hey we have to you all you have to do is obey the word of it's the same thing God told Cain just obey and do as your brother says here they said just obey and you'll get the Holy Ghost and that made them upset right now them that are such uh are such we command command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread but ye Brethren be not weary in well-doing and if any man obey not not our word by this epistle note that man and have no in other words hey guys he will not he refuses to do this the Bible says to not him make a mark of him just yeah that's that's the guy he says and have no company with him that he may be ashamed yet count him as not as an enemy where's this on the Catholic church yet count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother treat him like your own brother when he disobeys amen let's say let's say a prayer me just want to come up and pray or play here dearly father Lord Jesus Lord we went through some things there Lord some hard things Lord and it's not jumping and shouting or exciting Lord in that kind of way Lord but Lord the prophet John saw in heaven she was drunk the blood Saints

day and we had to choose between our denominations or the world baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then we had to get down our knees and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes and when we reive the baptism of the Holy Ghost we receiv received exactly what they had back there and that Holy Ghost was enough for them yes to be martyred what about us amen it's enough for us to make
