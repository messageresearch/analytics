TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ in my desire to defend jesus's message of the hour and jesus's messenger of that message against false accusations i want to show that william branham did not pretend to speak in tongues as he's been accused of by some of those who have left god's message it seems his accusers have again jumped to a false conclusion in an attempt to discredit god's true prophet as you'll soon see clear proof of this but first before getting into the subject i want to thank everyone for their supportive comments likes and shares for my past videos the lord willing next year in 2022 i hope to leave youtube for a different platform such as vimeo or rumble i've already left facebook instagram twitter and amazon because of their censorship of free speech if you'd like to stay in contact with my ministry please visit my website pastor jesse smith dot com and at the bottom of the home homepage you can sign up for my newsletter and blog you'll get updates on new videos new books blog posts and more lord willing my next book about the 12 new testament mysteries that jesus revealed to brother branham will be released in june of 2021 now back to this video's topic here's a summary of the false accusation the accusers say brother branham claimed a few finnish phrases he knew and spoke to a woman during an april 11 1959 discernment were an unknown tongue to him they claimed brother branham was pretending to speak in tongues but this accusation is false here's what really happened god used brother branham to give seven discernments during that april 11th 1959 sermon called watching his star during the fifth discernment brother branham did speak to a finnish woman about her high blood pressure and brother branham spoke a few finnish phrases to her as a friendly gesture the next day on april 12th brother branham was commenting about a group of armenian people who were blessed by the previous night's discernments in which brother branham told the name of a woman who didn't know english the armenian group wasn't referring to the finnish woman that brother branham spoke the finnish phrases to but when telling about the conversation with the armenian people brother branham accidentally confused the woman they were talking about with the finnish woman and we know that's true because brother branham didn't reveal the finnish woman's name like the armenian people were so excited about in the other discernment brother branham even seemed to catch his mistake because he admitted the discernment the armenian people were talking about might not have been the finnish woman this false accusation came to my attention during the september 2020 discussion and debate i participated in i'll leave a link to the debate in the description below and the accusation comes up around the two hour 36 minute mark the quotes in question let's listen to both quotes you can understand the truth behind the false accusation here's the first quote it's the fifth discernment out of seven on the sermon and notice brother branham never tells her her name right straight back the back of this place you're about middleways of this aisle there's a little there's a woman and she's suffering with a high blood pressure she she's not from here she's a fan she's from finland if you believe sister you receive your healing you might rise up to your feet and accept your healing and be made well god bless you keith jesus hallelujah what was i saying if thou canst believe according to the google translate website the meanings of the finished phrases are joomla god bless ketos jesus thank you jesus here's the second quote from the next day in which brother branham is sharing a testimony of the armenian group who were blessed by the discernments the previous night i was enjoying some fellowship this morning with the armenian people of the the city at their church and to my surprise there was a lady who could interpret languages that last evening i was speaking here and was the holy spirit was speaking rather and was calling the people out in the meeting and telling them of their different afflictions and their diseases and sometimes i couldn't make them understand just who it was and then the holy spirit would call their name out as you've noticed him doing that and then they were telling me this morning which visions to me are just like a trance and they were telling me of a woman that i had called back in somewhere in the audiences and it told her that a certain affliction had gripped her but she was couldn't understand me because she didn't she was from a another country a finnish woman and then the holy spirit to show that he's no respecter person spoke through here and called her name and told her to bless god spoke in a language that i didn't know and call the woman and give who she was and something about to uh the lord's blessings upon her or something other in finnish language i don't even know english let alone finish so it goes to show that god speaks in all the languages and all human beings belong to him how wonderful notice the armenian people were joyful because brother branham called the woman's name so this proves they were not referring to the finnish woman because brother branham did not call her name based upon these quotes brother branham's accusers claim he pretended to speak in tongues but they are wrong they've made three major mistakes the first mistake the first mistake the accusers made was misunderstanding brother branham's words of what was i saying what was i saying if thou canst believe the accusers think this means what was i saying or what unknown language was i speaking in the accusers have misunderstood the context when brother branham said what was i saying it meant what was i preaching a few minutes ago notice the words if thou can't believe spoken right after this statement of what was i saying in other words brother branham was saying don't you remember me saying or preaching about your need to believe jesus christ was showing his messiah sign of discernment through my ministry here are the quotes that prove brother branham's context as he had said if thou canst believe twice before this third time he said it when he was making a parallel between the wise men following their sign a star and today's believers following the messiah sign of jesus's gift of discernment in brother branham's ministry and when they seen that star again the bible said they rejoice with exceeding great joy may i say tonight that god has a sign today it's a sign of his spirit that were jesus is there's life for he is life and the messiah sign has appeared that he's with us in us and will comfort us and will help us and will bless us and will lead us to that one who was scarred in the hands pierced in the sign but if you believe that the lord jesus who stood and could tell the apostle peter who he was and what his father's name was and all the signs that he did like that which they crucified him for those signs and killed him a witch made him a beelzebub a devil that same spirit that was on jesus christ is in his church we'll yield ourselves down to his spirit god will do the same thing do you believe it let us bow our heads that you would pull from this audience those who you're calling tonight and all praise will be yours lord and we'll go out of here tonight feeling that the same morning star a heavenly gift is leading us deeper depths and higher hypes to jesus christ for we asked it in his name and for his glory amen if thou canst believe shortly after this god gave brother branham a discernment and he repeated if thou canst believe let's listen just back over in this other section here a little woman sitting with her hand up praying and she is suffering with the there's something wrong with her head and she's got asthma in her throat and a heart condition sitting right here looking right at me her name is mrs henry she come from san diego the lord has blessed you go home and be well your faith has made you whole if thou canst believe then shortly after this brother branham spoke to the finnish woman about her high blood pressure after the holy ghost discerned the high blood pressure brother brahm said what was i saying or don't you remember me preaching about jesus's messiah sign of discernment if you can only believe the second mistake the second mistake the accusers made was misunderstanding brother branham's statement of spoke in a language that i didn't know that he made about one of the seven discernments the next day in his sermon be certain of god on april 12 1959 the accusers think brother branham meant he spoke in finnish but brother branham meant the holy spirit interpreted his english into the foreign woman's native language according to the context of the sermon apparently brother branham's accusers didn't listen to the context according to the armenian people god told brother branham the literal name of the woman was discerned then god performed a miracle of hearing letting the woman understand brother branham's english in her native language let's listen to the quote and then the holy spirit to show that he's no respecter person spoke through here and called her name and told her to bless god spoke in a language that i didn't know and call the woman and give who she was and something about to uh the lord's blessings upon her or something other in finnish language i don't even know english let alone finish so it goes to show that god speaks in all the languages and all human beings belong to him how wonderful and if we could only grasp that this afternoon that his goodness to that little woman finish or whatever she was last night to be sure that her faith would be recognized he called her in her own language wonderful now overseas many times we see that happen in the foreign countries that i'll be standing speaking and it'll turn right back around and use my language and call people their names and everything just like it does here in their own native language that's what i call pentecost i believe it that's the holy spirit so see friends here are the seven discernments and you can see the only literal names given and discerned were mrs allen the first discernment mrs henry the second discernment and mrs delaney the seventh and last discernment the finnish woman was the fifth discernment and her literal name wasn't called based upon the descriptions of the armenian people it seems the discernment they were testifying about was either mrs allen mrs henry or mrs delaney and not the finnish woman it seems brother branham just made an accidental mistake thinking the armenian people were talking about the finnish woman brother branham described god using him to speak in a language he didn't know but he wasn't talking about himself speaking in an unknown language rather he was referring to him speaking in english and then the holy spirit interpreting his english words in the here's native language which was what happened on the day of pentecost peter and the holy ghost-filled galileans were speaking in galilean but the 17 nations of people were hearing them in their native languages so the miracle was the hearing it's my humble opinion that mrs allen was likely the testimony the armenians were referring to because brother branham was afraid she wasn't catching god speaking to her through brother branham and brother branham said a quick humble prayer for god to do something so she would not miss her blessing but i could be wrong here's the audio of mrs allen's discernment here look this away just a moment right over in this direction here i see a little woman i do not know her but she's praying she's wearing a little flat hat and she's suffering in over her stands that light she's suffering with her something wrong with her eyes and her ears i'm afraid the woman is not catching who i'm speaking of lord god say something or do something and she won't miss it her name is mrs allen all right do you believe that you will be healed then rise and be made well in the name of the lord jesus now be thankful that's the way to do it the third mistake the accusers failed to continue listening to the quote because brother branham admitted the discernment the armenian people were blessed by may not have been the finnish woman at first brother branham said it was a finnish woman but later said it could have been a different nationality here's the quote and if we could only grasp that this afternoon that his goodness to that little woman finish or whatever she was last night to be sure that her faith would be recognized he called her in her own language wonderful notice brother branham said finnish or whatever she was all these facts prove brother branham was not pretending to speak in tongues but was giving god glory for interpreting his english words in the native language of one of the women in his discernment ministry the night before in closing friends paul asked timothy to not be ashamed of the lord's testimony nor of paul's testimony paul told timothy to be a partaker of the afflictions of the gospel because it's a holy calling and worldly people despise the holiness of god second timothy 1 verses 8 and 9 says be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began i encourage you to use this scripture as a reminder to be unashamed of the true gospel of the lord jesus christ and his prophet brother william branham it seems the attacks on brother branham's character teachings and ministry will only increase as the rapture approaches but we have the spirit of truth and therefore will be guided by the holy spirit into all truth according to jesus in john 16 verse 13. as false accusations come and they will wait upon the lord jesus christ and he will renew your strength and give you the answer in due season and friends never feel bad for defending the gospel of jesus christ the true revelation of the message of this hour and god's prophet in philippians 1 verse 17 paul said knowing that i am set for the defense of the gospel so paul was set or appointed in the greek to defend the gospel the word defense in the greek means a verbal defense speech in defense a reasoned statement or argument we also know the scripture says prove all things hold fast that which is good and additionally earnestly contend for the faith which was once given to the saints the bible-based message of brother branham is thus saith the lord because it's according to the true revelation of the scripture not every word on tape is thus saith the lord as brother branham taught so by the holy spirit we must be careful what we listen to on the tapes as brother branham said and rightly divide the word of truth the bible revelations are thus saith the lord because brother random gave us over 30 thus saith the lords regarding doctrine and prophecy and the scripture promised that elias would restore all things before the second coming of jesus christ and brother branham was anointed with the spirit of elijah to restore the apostolic faith if you have any questions comments or testimonies about this video
