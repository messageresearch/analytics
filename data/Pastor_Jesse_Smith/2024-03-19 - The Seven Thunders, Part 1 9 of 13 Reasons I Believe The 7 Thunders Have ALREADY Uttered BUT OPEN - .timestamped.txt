[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] something happened the other day you
[0:04] read the or heard the tape the seven
[0:06] Thunders what time is it
[0:08] sir it happened the other
[0:11] day greetings friends in the matchless
[0:14] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:17] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:19] question I was asked do I believe the
[0:22] seven Thunders have already been uttered
[0:25] or do I believe the seven Thunders will
[0:27] be revealed in the future my current
[0:30] understanding is that the seven Thunders
[0:32] have already uttered through the
[0:34] ministry of God's Prophet brother
[0:36] William brandham and each Thunder was a
[0:39] revelation of each of the Seven Seals so
[0:43] when brother Randon preached the
[0:44] revelation of the first seal that was
[0:46] the first Thunder and so forth all the
[0:48] way down to the seventh seal hi friends
[0:51] I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ
[0:53] Fellowship here in akan Ohio we're
[0:55] coming up on our 18th year anniversary
[0:58] by the grace of God and I defend the
[1:00] Bible revelations that Jesus Christ
[1:02] revealed to his Prophet The Late William
[1:04] brandham 1909 to
[1:07] 1965 and I defend brother bram's Godly
[1:10] Christian character I want to begin by
[1:12] saying I respect the people that believe
[1:15] the seven Thunders will be revealed in
[1:16] the future but my personal conviction is
[1:19] that the seven Thunders have already
[1:21] uttered their voices through the
[1:22] ministry of God's Prophet brother
[1:24] brandham so this video is to share my
[1:26] current understanding on the seven
[1:28] Thunders I'm not taking a stand against
[1:31] anyone I'm not bashing anyone who
[1:34] doesn't agree with me because I'm open
[1:36] to the Future possibility of God
[1:39] uttering the seven Thunders but it seems
[1:41] like to me based upon nine reasons that
[1:44] the seven Thunders have already uttered
[1:45] their voices and friends I'm probably up
[1:48] to 13 Reasons now that I believe the
[1:51] Thunders have already been uttered by
[1:53] God's grace of course I'm recording this
[1:55] portion of the video 3 days after I
[1:58] recorded this first part of the video so
[2:01] Lord willing there definitely be a part
[2:03] two on this topic of the seven Thunders
[2:06] I might even make a third part and just
[2:08] show all the reasons why the seven
[2:10] Thunders could be a future Revelation
[2:12] given to a prophet as brother Ram said
[2:15] in the church age book The Seven
[2:16] Thunders have to come through a Prophet
[2:19] by God's grace I preached on this
[2:20] subject questions and answers on the
[2:22] Thunders two days ago would have been
[2:24] March 17th 2024 so I'll leave a link to
[2:27] that in the description by God's grace
[2:29] so Lord willing there will be a part two
[2:32] the reason I respect the other side that
[2:34] believes the Thunders will be revealed
[2:35] in the future is because I found
[2:38] probably around 10 quotes where brother
[2:40] random says the Thunders will be
[2:42] revealed right at the time of the
[2:44] Rapture and there's also a vision
[2:46] related to it in the seventh seal sermon
[2:48] from March of 1963 brother R talks about
[2:51] a vision he had of the seventh seal
[2:53] there was three folds to it the first
[2:55] fold was the seven Thunders and then he
[2:58] didn't know the last two folds he said
[3:00] one was even in an unknown language so
[3:02] that's why I respect the side that I
[3:05] don't agree with because I believe the
[3:07] Thunders have already uttered but I do
[3:08] respect the other side so I have this
[3:11] conviction that the Thunders already
[3:12] utter their voices because of nine solid
[3:15] reasons and I know the other side says
[3:18] they have quotes and they have a vision
[3:21] about it but one important thing to know
[3:23] is that there's seven quotes after
[3:25] brother Randon preached the seventh seal
[3:28] that make me believe brother brandham
[3:30] believed that the seven Thunders had
[3:33] already been
[3:34] uttered and of course that's very
[3:36] convincing to me I've also told our
[3:38] church that I believe if the Thunders
[3:41] would be revealed in the future we would
[3:43] receive it because we're constantly
[3:45] hungry and thirsting after more
[3:46] righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:49] as brother Ram said we should pray for
[3:50] Revelation more than anything and I
[3:52] believe we do that when we pray for the
[3:54] will of God every day every day we pray
[3:57] let thy will be done on Earth as it is
[3:59] in heaven forgive us our sins help us to
[4:02] forgive those who've sinned against us
[4:04] as we daily seek first the kingdom of
[4:06] God in his righteousness I believe the
[4:08] Lord would reveal those Thunders to us
[4:10] because we're seeking the Lord's face
[4:11] every day and of course I believe we're
[4:13] still waiting for the latter rain I do
[4:15] not believe the latter rain has fallen
[4:17] yet because brother brandom called the
[4:19] latter rain rapturing faith in the
[4:20] church age book and no one in the
[4:22] Gentile dispensation has been raptured
[4:24] yet so we're still waiting on the
[4:26] Rapture brother Brandon said thus sayith
[4:28] the Lord the fullness of Pentecost
[4:30] will be in the bride before the Rapture
[4:32] Joel 2: 23- 26 so our church and
[4:37] numerous other churches are looking for
[4:38] the latter rain or rapturing faith it is
[4:41] promised to us with thus sayith the Lord
[4:44] in her will be the fullness of Pentecost
[4:46] for the spirit will bring the people
[4:48] right back to where they were at the
[4:49] beginning that is thus saith the
[4:53] Lord it is thus saith the Lord for that
[4:57] is what Joel 2 23-26 says be glad then
[5:01] ye children of Zion and rejoice in the
[5:04] Lord your God for he hath given you the
[5:06] former Reign moderately and he will
[5:09] cause to come down for you the rain the
[5:11] former rain and the latter rain in the
[5:13] first month and the floors shall be full
[5:15] of Wheat and the fats shall overflow
[5:18] with wine and oil and I will restore to
[5:21] you the years that the Locust have eaten
[5:23] the cankerworms and the caterpillar and
[5:25] the Palmer worm my great Army which I
[5:28] sent among you and and you shall eat in
[5:30] plenty and be satisfied and praise the
[5:33] name of the Lord your God that hath
[5:35] dealt wondrously with you and my people
[5:38] shall never be
[5:39] [Music]
[5:40] ashamed and also in the church age book
[5:42] brother brand said the seven Thunders
[5:44] had to come by a prophet and brother Ram
[5:46] was using scriptures about his own
[5:48] Ministry Revelation 10:7 Malachi 45 and6
[5:51] so if a prophet did rise up and gave the
[5:54] revelation of the seven Thunders we
[5:56] would recognize it because we already
[5:57] know how to recognize a prophet
[5:59] according to the Bible just like we
[6:01] recognize brother brandham as a genuine
[6:03] Prophet what was in those Thunders no
[6:05] one knows but we need to know and it
[6:08] will take a prophet to get the
[6:10] Revelation because God has no other way
[6:12] of bringing out his scriptural
[6:13] Revelations except by a prophet the word
[6:17] always came by a prophet and always will
[6:20] so Lord willing I'm just going to make
[6:21] this video a little shorter I'm just
[6:23] going to go through the nine reasons I
[6:25] believe the Thunders have already
[6:26] uttered and of course they are the
[6:28] revelations of the Seven Seals Lord
[6:31] willing if people make comments on this
[6:33] video I'll make a part two and I can go
[6:35] through all the quotes brother brandom
[6:37] said about the seven Thunders here's a
[6:40] visual at this point I found 51 quotes
[6:43] that say seven Thunders there's one
[6:46] quote that says seven Thunder and
[6:48] there's 27 other quotes that say seven
[6:51] mysterious Thunders or have some other
[6:54] combination of the words seven and
[6:57] Thunders so it was basically about 70
[6:59] quotes about the seven Thunders and of
[7:01] course there could be more by God's
[7:03] grace okay so reason number one brother
[7:05] brandom said seven times that the seven
[7:08] Thunders were already fulfilled revealed
[7:11] or history and all these quotes were
[7:14] after he preached the seventh seal
[7:16] sermon from March of
[7:19] 1963 and I'll briefly read these the
[7:22] first one was God hiding himself in
[7:24] Simplicity in Albuquerque he said you
[7:26] read or heard the tape the seven
[7:28] Thunders what time is it sir see it
[7:30] happened the other day so there he said
[7:32] it happened the other day let's listen
[7:34] to the quote something happened the
[7:36] other day you read the I heard the tape
[7:38] the seven Thunders what time is it
[7:41] sir it happened the other day know these
[7:45] things the time is at hand Church the
[7:49] time is at hand don't don't don't wait
[7:51] any longer see the second one was from
[7:54] the previous day the world is falling
[7:56] apart in Albuquerque brother Bram said
[7:59] in the Seven Seals were opened at the
[8:01] Tabernacle the other day so if the Seven
[8:03] Seals were opened and brother Ram said
[8:06] he gave us the revelation of them with
[8:07] thus say the Lord then that Revelation
[8:10] was the seven Thunders uttering their
[8:12] voices so this is a second quote let's
[8:15] listen to the quote what it goes we turn
[8:17] back the Seven Seals were opened at the
[8:19] Tabernacle the other day I seen people
[8:22] coming from standing there 3:00 in the
[8:23] morning and get a place to get into the
[8:25] auditorium and so forth see the hungry
[8:27] Hearts coming from everywhere I thought
[8:28] oh God we're bound to be at the end now
[8:32] remember the sounding of the seventh
[8:33] angel the mysteries of God was finished
[8:35] and there come an angel from heaven and
[8:36] swore with his hands raised from Heaven
[8:38] Revelations 10 1-7 the time would be no
[8:40] more exactly right the hour what church
[8:43] is he coming
[8:45] to Now The Vision Plus the word plus the
[8:50] history plus the church ages and all
[8:52] blend together so I could truly say that
[8:57] to the best of my understanding and
[8:59] according to the word of God and the
[9:01] vision and the Revelation the
[9:03] interpretation thereof is thus sayeth
[9:06] the Lord a third quote is from Christ is
[9:09] the mystery of God revealed brother BR
[9:11] said that he spoke of it here and showed
[9:13] those seven Thunders so brother Ram said
[9:16] the seven Thunders were showed let's
[9:18] listen to the
[9:19] quote but in the last days the reason
[9:22] that was such a tremendous thing that he
[9:24] spoke of ear and showed those seven
[9:26] Thunders and look life My Life magazine
[9:28] and packed that circle of of cloud and
[9:31] light there that they could not
[9:32] understand and don't know it yet but
[9:35] here telling go there and wait for these
[9:38] Mysteries to be revealed and he months
[9:41] before it happened and then it happened
[9:44] exactly the way he said it would do did
[9:46] you notice in that picture even that
[9:48] Rangel on the right when he's being
[9:49] materialized
[9:51] come the fourth quote is from the
[9:53] unveiling of God brother brand said them
[9:56] seven Thunders it's all revealed in
[9:58] there and the Seven seals opened up the
[10:00] revelation of what that was that's what
[10:02] it was see it's still in the word and
[10:05] notice he says that's what it was it was
[10:07] revealed it was opened all three of
[10:10] those are past tense let's listen to the
[10:13] quote and he said well then then seven
[10:15] Thunders you see said what them seven
[10:17] Thunders blasting out won't that be a
[10:18] revelation be given to some man I said
[10:20] no sir it would be adding something to
[10:21] it or taking something from it's all
[10:23] revealed in there and the Seven Seals
[10:25] opened up the revelation of what that
[10:26] was am see it's still in the word you
[10:29] see you can't get out of that word it
[10:31] won't leave the word and God's spirit
[10:33] will never leave that word it'll stay
[10:35] right with the word blinding some and
[10:37] Open the Eyes of others it'll always do
[10:41] that the fifth quote is questions and
[10:43] answers part four 1964 brother BR was
[10:47] directly asked about the seven Thunders
[10:50] and he said they were revealed in the
[10:52] Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was
[10:54] about let's listen to the
[10:56] quote have the seven Thunders
[11:00] which equals seven Mysteries already
[11:03] been
[11:05] revealed were they revealed in the Seven
[11:08] Seals but are yet but are yet not known
[11:13] to us as the Thunders yet no they were
[11:16] revealed in the Seven Seals that's what
[11:18] the Thunders was about they was to
[11:20] reveal the seven Thunders had uttered
[11:23] their voices and no one could make out
[11:26] what it was John knew what it was but
[11:27] he's forbidden to write it he said but
[11:29] the seventh angel in the days of his
[11:32] sounding the seven Mysteries of the
[11:34] seven Thunders would be revealed and the
[11:37] seventh angel is a messenger of the
[11:38] seventh Church
[11:40] age the fifth quote is from what is the
[11:43] attraction on the mountain July 25th
[11:45] 1965 evening brother Bram said what's
[11:48] happened upon Mount Sunset God
[11:50] fulfilling Revelation 10 1-7 so of
[11:53] course the Thunder verses are verses 10
[11:55] 3 and 4 and brother R said they were
[11:58] fulfilled he said said 3 years ago this
[12:00] was a mystery and a prophecy but now
[12:03] it's history it's past God fulfilling
[12:06] his word so brother Ram says Revelation
[12:09] 10 1-7 is fulfilled it's history it's
[12:12] ped let's listen to the
[12:14] quote what's happened up on Mount Sunset
[12:18] God confirming his word that's what all
[12:20] this noise is
[12:23] about notice it's God fulfilling his
[12:27] promised word again of Revelations 10
[12:31] 1-7 and in the days of the sounding of
[12:34] the seventh Angel's message the mystery
[12:36] of God should be finished the hidden
[12:39] Mystery of
[12:40] Revelations 10 1-7 the last message to
[12:44] the last Church age fulfills exactly in
[12:47] this
[12:48] age St Luke
[12:50] 17:30 the day when the son of man shall
[12:53] be
[12:55] revealed and the god of Heaven promised
[12:58] the evening time would have evening
[13:00] lights three years ago this mystery was
[13:02] a prophecy what time is it sir but now
[13:07] it's
[13:08] history it's passed the promise is
[13:13] fulfilled what time is it Ser what's
[13:15] this
[13:16] attraction God fulfilling his
[13:21] word he's the same yesterday today and
[13:24] forever let us
[13:27] pray and then lastly in the church AG
[13:29] book brother Ram said the messenger of
[13:31] Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going
[13:33] to do two things he's going to turn the
[13:34] hearts according to Malachi 4 and second
[13:37] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[13:38] seven thunders in Revelation 10 which
[13:40] are the revelations contained in the
[13:42] Seven Seals let's listen to the
[13:45] quote now this messenger of Malachi 4
[13:47] and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[13:50] things one according to Malachi 4 he
[13:54] will turn the hearts of the children to
[13:55] the fathers two he will reveal the
[13:58] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[14:00] Revelation 10 which are the revelations
[14:02] contained in the Seven Seals it will be
[14:05] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[14:07] that literally turned the hearts of the
[14:09] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[14:11] exactly
[14:12] so the second reason I believe the
[14:14] Thunders have already uttered is brother
[14:16] brandom never mentioned the seven seal
[14:18] Vision with the threefolds after he
[14:21] preached the seven seal sermon so this
[14:23] makes me think brother random realized
[14:26] the vision was already fulfilled and he
[14:28] knew that the Thunders were the
[14:30] revelations of the Seven Seals and if
[14:33] I'm wrong on that if there is another
[14:34] quote or more quotes on that seventh
[14:37] seal Vision please let me know by God's
[14:39] grace I'll correct my understanding on
[14:41] that the third reason I believe the
[14:43] Thunders are already uttered is when
[14:46] asked directly about it in 1964
[14:49] questions and answers part for brother
[14:51] random said they were already revealed
[14:53] we've already heard that quote so I'm
[14:54] not going to spend any more time on
[14:56] that have the seven Thunder
[14:59] ERS which equal seven Mysteries already
[15:03] been
[15:05] revealed were they revealed in the Seven
[15:08] Seals but are yet but are yet not known
[15:13] to us as the Thunders yet no they were
[15:16] revealed in the Seven Seals that's what
[15:18] the Thunders was about they was to
[15:20] reveal the seven Thunders that uttered
[15:23] their voices and no one could make out
[15:26] what it was John knew what it was but
[15:28] he's forbidden to write he said but the
[15:30] seventh angel in the days of his
[15:32] sounding the seven Mysteries of the
[15:34] seven Thunders would be revealed and the
[15:37] seventh angel is a messenger of the
[15:39] seventh Church
[15:41] age the fourth reason I believe the
[15:43] Thunder is already revealed is because
[15:45] brother brandham put that in print in
[15:47] the church age book that the Thunders
[15:49] were the revelations contained in the
[15:51] Seven Seals and brother brandom said on
[15:54] tape he read the book through a few
[15:56] times and then his daughter Rebecca said
[15:59] she read it to him numerous times as
[16:00] well so clearly if brother brandom read
[16:02] it through a few times and heard it
[16:05] himself a few times then he definitely
[16:07] knew the content in the book pretty well
[16:09] was pretty familiar with it he would not
[16:11] have been surprised about that chapter
[16:14] the L scene chapter chapter n because it
[16:17] was about him as being the messenger and
[16:19] lale of course would have known that
[16:20] brother Brandon was the messenger to the
[16:22] leene church age so brother Randon was
[16:24] probably most likely very familiar with
[16:26] that portion on the seventh thund ERS so
[16:29] let's listen to the quote where brother
[16:31] random said he read it through a few
[16:33] times
[16:35] now does anyone in here know Dr
[16:39] Le I don't think maybe not he is a
[16:42] Baptist preacher doctor of divinity and
[16:44] he got his degrees he was a high school
[16:47] teacher to begin with and he's a very
[16:49] fine scholarly man in my tapes of the
[16:53] seven Church ages I sent them to him to
[16:56] grammar IE them because my Kentucky hit
[17:00] ha and tote and carry and fetch that
[17:01] don't go good for people who read some
[17:03] books so he was going to grammar IE it
[17:05] for him and then after he got through
[17:07] sent it back a couple times for more
[17:09] statements which the book is going to
[17:11] press now after about 3 4 years he the
[17:15] fifth reason I believe the Thunders have
[17:17] already uttered is that if the Thunders
[17:20] aren't revealed then our hearts are not
[17:22] turn back to the apostolic fathers and
[17:25] of course I'm basing this on the quote
[17:26] from the church age book chapter n
[17:29] and friends if our hearts aren't turned
[17:32] to the fathers of the faith like Peter
[17:34] Paul James and John then where are our
[17:37] hearts turned to who have we turned our
[17:39] hearts to if our hearts are not towards
[17:42] Paul Peter James and John and it seems
[17:44] from the Bible you can only have your
[17:46] heart in one of two places or in one of
[17:48] two conditions you either have a Heart
[17:51] of Stone which would be a sinner's heart
[17:53] or you can have a heart of Flesh that
[17:55] the Holy Spirit can write his word upon
[17:56] the fleshly tables of our hearts so
[17:59] basically the fifth reason is I believe
[18:01] the Thunders have uttered because my
[18:03] heart is turned back to the Gospel of
[18:05] Jesus Christ that he gave to St Paul
[18:07] James John Peter and all the New
[18:10] Testament writers the sixth reason is
[18:12] from Revelation 6 verse1 it says a
[18:15] thunder sounded at the first seal and to
[18:18] me this proves each seal had a thunder
[18:20] even though Revelation 6 doesn't say
[18:23] each seal has a thunder but to me there
[18:25] had to be a thunder for each seal or
[18:28] else there were eight Thunders because
[18:31] there is one thunder in Revelation 61
[18:33] and then there's seven more thunders in
[18:35] Revelation 10 verses 3 and 4 so I
[18:38] believe there's only seven Thunders and
[18:41] not eight Thunders so that means the
[18:43] first Thunder of Revelation 61 in the
[18:46] first seal was also one of the seven
[18:48] Thunders that was uttered in Revelation
[18:51] 10: 3 and 4 the seventh reason I believe
[18:54] the Thunders are already uttered is
[18:57] because there's no thus sayith the
[18:58] Lord's statement from Brother brandom on
[19:01] a future opening of the seven
[19:03] Thunders now I also understand there's
[19:05] no thus say the Lord for my current
[19:09] conviction as well so I just want to be
[19:11] humble and say neither side has a thus
[19:13] sayith the Lord so we just need to lean
[19:15] upon the holy ghost and draw as close to
[19:17] God as we possibly can to receive any
[19:20] further Revelation he'll give us before
[19:22] the Rapture by the grace of God and as I
[19:24] stated earlier yes I do understand
[19:25] there's a vision about the seventh seal
[19:27] and seven Thunders onefold of it but
[19:30] again brother Bram never mentioned this
[19:32] Vision after preaching the seventh seal
[19:33] sermon so to me it seems like it was
[19:36] revealed to him that the seven Thunders
[19:38] had already uttered when he preached the
[19:39] Seven
[19:40] Seals the eighth reason I believe the
[19:42] Thunders already uttered is because if
[19:45] the seven Thunders haven't uttered and
[19:47] there's still a mystery then Revelation
[19:50] 10:7 is not fulfilled the Bible said in
[19:53] Revelation 10:7 the seventh angel
[19:55] finishes all the mystery of God and
[19:58] remember friend brother random said
[19:59] Revelation 101:7 is history he said it's
[20:02] already fulfilled but if we say there's
[20:04] a mysterious seven Thunders to come then
[20:06] the mysteries of God are not finished
[20:08] and I believe that kind of belief opens
[20:10] up itself for a lot of false doctrines
[20:13] to come in such as then we still need a
[20:15] seventh angel messenger or we need
[20:18] brother brandom to physically return
[20:20] which I do not believe is going to
[20:21] happen so I believe the most logical
[20:24] explanation is that the revelation of
[20:26] the Seven Seals were the uttering of the
[20:29] seven
[20:30] Thunders and Ninth and finally the ninth
[20:33] reason I believe the Thunders have
[20:35] already uttered because of the order of
[20:37] Revelation 10 in verses 1 to 7 The
[20:40] Mighty Angel comes down has an open book
[20:43] Seven Thunders utter their voices and
[20:46] then the seventh angel finishes the
[20:48] mystery of God which I believe was
[20:50] brother bram's Ministry then in verses
[20:52] 8- 11 John eats the book and takes it to
[20:55] every gentile people and I believe
[20:57] that's exactly what what's happened
[20:59] since brother Randon went off the scene
[21:01] 59 years ago the real Holy Ghost filled
[21:04] Saints have eaten the revelations of the
[21:06] Bible and taking it around the world by
[21:08] God's
[21:09] grace in
[21:12] closing friends I hope this video was a
[21:14] blessing by God's grace as I said one of
[21:16] the Saints asked me about my
[21:19] understanding on the seven Thunders and
[21:20] so I took time numerous hours these last
[21:23] few days and read through all the quotes
[21:25] I could find on the seven Thunders and I
[21:27] wanted to make a video to all our
[21:29] viewers to help them as well and of
[21:30] course help the individual who asked the
[21:32] question this is a great topic to study
[21:35] it's all about the rapture we all want
[21:36] to be ready for the rapture we want to
[21:39] be the wise virgin who's got oil ready
[21:41] we want to be the people with the
[21:42] wedding garment on the righteousness of
[21:44] Christ the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:47] friends I told our church that I believe
[21:49] it's just like God to give us something
[21:52] to study and pray about what I mean by
[21:54] that is there's no thus say the Lord's
[21:55] statement about the Thunders whether
[21:57] they're already uttered or or they'll be
[21:59] in the future so it's as if God gave us
[22:01] something to pray about seek his face
[22:03] about and the Bible said it's the honor
[22:06] of Kings to search out of matter in the
[22:08] Book of Proverbs and it's shame and
[22:10] Folly for someone to answer matter
[22:12] before they hear all of it and of course
[22:14] remember the bans searched the
[22:15] Scriptures Daily because they were more
[22:16] noble so it's the desire of Holy Ghost
[22:19] filled Christians to have that spiritual
[22:23] nobility to search the scriptures every
[22:25] day by God's grace listen to the quotes
[22:27] from brother brandham and right divide
[22:28] the word of Truth by the Holy Ghost
[22:31] remember Deuteronomy 29:29 says these
[22:34] secret things belong to God and now they
[22:36] belong to us and our children that we
[22:38] might do all the words of the law of God
[22:40] and of course for us that's the law of
[22:42] the Holy Spirit here in the New
[22:43] Testament by the grace of God according
[22:46] to the Book of Romans chapter 8 so Lord
[22:48] willing we'll see if our viewers want a
[22:50] part two or not we can go through all
[22:52] the quotes maybe not all I mean but the
[22:54] most important quotes by God's grace out
[22:56] of those 70 quotes or so the majority of
[22:59] the quotes are in two sermons 13 of them
[23:03] are in s this the end time December 1962
[23:07] and then eight of them are in the
[23:09] seventh seal from March of
[23:11] 1963 friends let's draw nigh to God and
[23:14] God will surely draw nigh to us no man
[23:17] knows the day or the hour of the Rapture
[23:18] but we want to be ready Jesus numerous
[23:20] times implored his people watch and be
[23:24] ready so we are the children of the day
[23:26] we're not the children of the night we
[23:27] won't be overtaken Aken by the Great
[23:29] Tribulation like a thief in the night we
[23:31] are the children of the day we have our
[23:33] eyes open we can spiritually see the
[23:35] movement of the Antichrist we can also
[23:37] see the empowering of the Holy Ghost in
[23:39] the bride and of course saints were
[23:41] promised a pardon from the wrath of God
[23:43] according to first Thessalonians chapter
[23:46] 5 if you have any questions concerns or
[23:48] testimonies about this video please
[23:50] contact
[23:51] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[23:54] the desire of your
[23:57] heart
