[0:03] Look at Job, a perfect man, a just man.
[0:07] And God permitted the evil devil to come
[0:10] up on him and chastise him and
[0:12] everything else for the perfecting of
[0:14] his spirit. See, so evil spirits has God
[0:19] uses evil spirits many times to work out
[0:22] his plan and his will.
[0:25] Greetings friends in the name above all
[0:27] names, the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[0:30] purpose of this video is to look at
[0:31] reasons why good people suffer or we'd
[0:34] say why do Christians suffer. Recently,
[0:37] our church was asked to pray for about
[0:39] three families within the span of one or
[0:41] two weeks. And in each of the families,
[0:44] the father had passed away. So, three
[0:46] families were left with widows and
[0:48] children. And so, this topic of why we
[0:51] suffer has been on my mind. So, I
[0:53] thought I'd make a video on this here by
[0:55] the grace of God. So, the outline is
[0:57] fairly simple. We'll look at two
[0:58] perspectives on why good people suffer
[1:00] and then we'll look at at least five
[1:02] reasons why God allows suffering. So,
[1:05] let's begin with two perspectives on why
[1:07] good people suffer. The first
[1:09] perspective is God's perspective on
[1:12] absolute goodness or holiness. So, the
[1:14] question, why do good people suffer in
[1:17] one way isn't true because there's no
[1:20] good people. A better question is why
[1:24] does God bless evil people? Because the
[1:27] Bible says in Jeremiah, the heart is
[1:29] deceitfully wicked above all things. Who
[1:30] can know it? So in other words, the
[1:32] question is flawed. Why do good people
[1:34] suffer? There are no good people. We're
[1:36] all sinners. We all fall short of the
[1:37] glory of God. There's only one good
[1:39] person, one good human being, and that
[1:41] was the Lord Jesus Christ. The one good
[1:43] person, the Lord Jesus Christ, was
[1:45] willing to choose to suffer in order to
[1:47] redeem us. So why did the one good
[1:50] person suffer? to redeem others and he
[1:53] willingly chose suffering. So that's the
[1:55] first perspective. The second
[1:57] perspective is God's perspective on
[1:59] believers obeying his spirit and not
[2:02] their own works or effort. But when
[2:05] believers obey the Holy Spirit, they're
[2:07] doing good in the sight of God. So for
[2:10] God's absolute standard of goodness or
[2:12] holiness, there's no one holy except
[2:14] Jesus. But God does recognize the
[2:18] righteous choices that his people make
[2:20] through his leading of the Holy Spirit.
[2:22] And this is all by grace, faith, and
[2:25] divine character that God builds up in
[2:26] our lives. Now, in Mark 10:18, Jesus
[2:29] told the rich young ruler, "Why causest
[2:31] thou me good? There's none good but one,
[2:33] that is God." So notice Jesus is testing
[2:35] him. The rich young ruler is likely
[2:38] trying to flatter him. And that's true
[2:40] because Jesus eventually exposed how he
[2:42] wasn't willing to sacrifice everything
[2:44] to follow the Lord. So he had some sin
[2:46] in his life still. But Jesus was testing
[2:49] him to see if he believed Jesus was God.
[2:51] Cuz Jesus said, "There's none good but
[2:54] God." Now, if the rich young ruler was a
[2:56] believer, he would have said, "Well,
[2:57] you're the Messiah. You're God." So
[2:59] Jesus was testing the rich young ruler
[3:01] and he failed the test. The Messiah was
[3:04] to be God according to Isaiah 9:6. A son
[3:07] was to be born which was the Lord Jesus.
[3:09] He'd be called the mighty God, the
[3:11] prince of peace, the everlasting father,
[3:13] wonderful counselor, all those great
[3:15] titles for the Lord Jesus Christ. So
[3:17] Jesus said there's none good but God,
[3:19] but he was a manifestation of God. He
[3:21] was the son of God. So Jesus was and is
[3:24] good. Now regarding the second
[3:26] perspective on goodness, Proverbs 12:2
[3:29] says, "A good man obtainth favor from
[3:31] the Lord." Well, any honest Christian
[3:32] would want to be a good man. And this
[3:34] would be according to God's second
[3:36] perspective, not the first perspective
[3:38] on absolute holiness or goodness, but on
[3:40] the second perspective that by the Holy
[3:42] Spirit, God can lead us to make good
[3:44] decisions. Luke 23:50 calls Joseph of
[3:48] Arythea, he was a good man and a just.
[3:51] So the Bible calls him a good man. So
[3:54] this is in the second perspective on
[3:56] believers who by the spirit of God obey
[3:59] the word of God.
[4:01] The Bible also says this about Barnabas
[4:03] in Acts 11:24. For he was a good man and
[4:06] full of the Holy Ghost and of faith. So
[4:08] Barnabas was a Holy Ghost fil believer
[4:10] and the Bible calls him a good man. So
[4:12] that's what we want as believers. We
[4:13] want God's spirit to consider us good.
[4:16] In other words, we're trying our best to
[4:17] obey the Holy Spirit and make good
[4:19] choices. But none of us are saying we
[4:21] have absolute goodness or absolute
[4:22] holiness. That's only the Lord Jesus
[4:25] Christ. Jesus said in Matthew 12:35 that
[4:27] a good man out of the good treasure of
[4:29] his heart bringeth forth good things. So
[4:31] Jesus said we can be good not the
[4:33] absolute holiness but the surrendered
[4:35] obedient heart to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[4:37] And in Matthew 25 the Bible said Jesus
[4:39] will tell those who are faithful with
[4:41] their talents well done good and
[4:43] faithful servant. So it is God's grace
[4:46] that lets us be good that lets us do his
[4:49] will. Ephesians 1:6 said, "He which hath
[4:53] begun a good work in you will perform it
[4:55] until the day of Jesus Christ." So any
[4:57] goodness in our lives, it's according to
[4:58] the goodness of God, that he's led us
[5:01] into good decision-making, obedience.
[5:04] Ephesians 2:10 says, "For we are his
[5:06] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[5:08] unto good works." So God created us to
[5:11] be saved, be filled with his spirit,
[5:12] then we can do the right works or good
[5:14] works. So in one way, are we good? No.
[5:17] We don't have the perfect goodness or
[5:19] perfect holiness. That's only the Lord
[5:20] Jesus Christ. But in another way, are we
[5:22] good? Yes. When we repent, get filled
[5:25] with God's spirit, and obey the spirit
[5:26] of God and do the right decisions, the
[5:29] correct choices. When we obey the word
[5:32] of God, that makes us good in the sight
[5:34] of God. So, let's look at five reasons
[5:37] why we suffer here. The first reason is
[5:39] to be tested, proved or tried to the
[5:41] devil. This is found in Job 1:es 8-12.
[5:46] God compliments Job's faith to the
[5:48] devil. And God said, "Have you
[5:49] considered my servant Job?" Now, it's a
[5:51] very humbling thought to think that God
[5:53] would consider you and I. Asked the
[5:55] devil to consider you and I about our
[5:58] goodness or our obedience, we'd say, and
[6:01] Job recognized eventually that this was
[6:04] a trial of his faith. In Job 23:10, Job
[6:07] said, "But he knoweth the way that I
[6:09] take. When he hath tried me, I shall
[6:11] come forth as gold." So sometimes,
[6:13] friends, we suffer because God is
[6:15] proving our faith to the devil. Remember
[6:18] the Bible said the devil's the accuser
[6:19] of the brethren. He accuses us day and
[6:21] night before the throne of God. The
[6:23] scripture says, so let's remember if we
[6:25] can't figure out why we're suffering,
[6:27] why we're going through a test, if we
[6:29] didn't do anything wrong, it could be
[6:30] that first reason God is testing us or
[6:34] trying us, proving to the devil that we
[6:36] will obey God because we love God, not
[6:38] just because of the blessings he gives
[6:40] us.
[6:41] The second reason we suffer is because
[6:43] we're being tested, proved, or tried to
[6:46] ourselves. This is also found in the
[6:49] book of Job. It's also found in Romans
[6:52] 8:17-18 in 2 Timothy 2:12.
[6:56] Many years ago, I was reading my
[6:57] Scoffield Bible and I found this
[6:59] footnote on Job 42:6.
[7:01] Wherefore, I abhore myself and repent in
[7:04] dust and ashes. So here we see the
[7:07] second reason Job suffered so he could
[7:09] see what was inside of himself. And
[7:12] Scofield calls this self-nowledge or
[7:15] self-standing and self-judgment.
[7:18] I'll quote Scofield referring to Job. He
[7:20] said, "The godly are afflicted that they
[7:23] may be brought to self-nowledge and
[7:25] self-judgment. Such afflictions are not
[7:27] penal for their sins but remedial and
[7:30] purifying." End quote. So this footnote
[7:33] from Scoffield meant so much to me years
[7:35] ago and still means so much for me
[7:37] today. In other words, we suffer to be
[7:39] tested and shown what's inside of us
[7:43] that we can understand the need that we
[7:45] have to be more purified and we can
[7:48] judge ourselves that we be not judged as
[7:50] 1 Corinthians 11:31 and 32 say. So Job
[7:55] is tested so he can see his own sinful
[7:58] condition. the fact that he needed to
[8:00] repent in dust and ashes. Verse 6 said,
[8:03] "I abhore myself." So in other words, he
[8:05] had to be shown that he hated his sin
[8:07] nature on the inside of him. Now, if you
[8:09] want friends, I can make a separate
[8:10] video on all the sins Job committed.
[8:13] Although God said he was perfect in
[8:14] heaven, he was perfect in heaven by the
[8:16] blood sacrifice. He still sinned down on
[8:19] earth just like every one of us,
[8:20] everyone except the Lord Jesus Christ.
[8:23] Romans 8:17 and 18 the Bible says and if
[8:26] children then hes of God and joint heirs
[8:29] with Christ if so be that we suffer with
[8:31] him that we may also be glorified
[8:33] together for I reckon that the
[8:34] sufferings of this present time are not
[8:36] worthy to be compared with the glory
[8:38] which shall be revealed in us. So see we
[8:41] have to suffer in order to be glorified
[8:44] and so the testing or proving of
[8:45] ourselves will produce humility that we
[8:48] need to reign with Christ. So we need
[8:51] the tests and trials to suffer in order
[8:53] to be glorified. And we also see this in
[8:56] 2 Timothy 2:12. Beautiful scripture
[8:58] here. If we suffer, we shall also reign
[9:01] with him. If we deny him, he will also
[9:03] deny us. So see, we must suffer in order
[9:07] to reign. This is what brother Ram said
[9:09] in the Simranian church age chapter 4.
[9:11] Unless we suffer with him, we cannot
[9:13] reign with him. You have to suffer to
[9:15] reign. The reason for this is that
[9:17] character simply is never made without
[9:19] suffering. Character is a victory, not a
[9:22] gift. A man without character can't
[9:25] reign because power apart from character
[9:27] is satanic, but power with character is
[9:30] fit to rule. So to go along with this, I
[9:33] found another quote from brother
[9:34] Brandham, Questions and Answers on the
[9:35] Holy Ghost 1959. He's talking about Job.
[9:38] He said, "Look at Job, a perfect man, a
[9:40] just man, and God permitted the evil
[9:42] devil to come upon him and and chastise
[9:44] him. and look and everything else for
[9:47] the perfecting of his spirit.
[9:51] So that's another way to say this second
[9:53] reason for suffering is to be tested and
[9:56] proven to ourselves that we might be
[9:58] perfected that we might be humble and
[10:00] have character that can reign with Jesus
[10:02] Christ in the millennium and reign with
[10:05] him at the white throne judgment sit
[10:06] with him in judgment and also reign
[10:08] during the new Jerusalem.
[10:10] The third reason we suffer is to learn
[10:12] obedience. Hebrews 5:8 and 9 tell us
[10:15] this. Brother Bham quotes this in the
[10:17] church age book again. He Jesus learned
[10:20] obedience by the things that he
[10:21] suffered. He was actually made perfect
[10:23] by the things that he suffered. Hebrews
[10:25] 5:8-9. Though he were a son, yet he
[10:27] learned he obedience by the things which
[10:29] he suffered. And being made perfect, he
[10:32] became the author of eternal salvation
[10:34] unto all them that obey him. Brother Ram
[10:38] said in plain language, the very
[10:39] character of Jesus was perfected by
[10:41] suffering. And according to Paul, he has
[10:43] left his church a measure of suffering
[10:45] that they too by their faith in God
[10:47] while suffering for him would come to a
[10:49] place of perfection.
[10:51] Friends, all of us need to learn to
[10:53] obey. And so the third reason we go
[10:56] through suffering is so we can learn to
[10:57] obey. So the first reason to suffer was
[11:00] to be proven to the devil. The second
[11:02] reason would be proven to ourselves. The
[11:05] third reason to learn obedience. And the
[11:08] fourth reason is greater fruitfulness.
[11:10] Scoffield cited this John 15:2
[11:14] Jesus said, "Every branch in me that
[11:15] beareth not fruit, he taketh away. And
[11:17] every branch that beareth fruit, he
[11:19] purgeth it that it may bring forth more
[11:21] fruit." So the purging is the cutting.
[11:24] The Greek means to cleanse of filth,
[11:26] impurity, to cut off useless shoots on a
[11:30] tree or vine. Metaphorically, to cut
[11:33] away from guilt. So God knows if we
[11:37] suffer, we'll have greater fruitfulness.
[11:39] Of course, because we have better
[11:41] character. We can look at so many Bible
[11:43] examples. You know, Joseph in the book
[11:44] of Genesis. He suffered, was sold into
[11:47] slavery. But look at his fruitfulness.
[11:49] After he endured the suffering, he
[11:51] became second in command, type of the
[11:53] Lord Jesus Christ, seat at the right
[11:55] hand of the father. David ran from Saul,
[11:58] went through a lot of sufferings for
[11:59] years and years. But because of that, he
[12:02] was a much better king than Saul. He had
[12:04] greater fruitfulness, way more
[12:06] victories. I think I calculated it last
[12:07] time. Saul had five victories. David had
[12:10] at least 14 recorded in the scripture.
[12:12] So greater fruitfulness after suffering.
[12:15] Paul suffered much. He goes through his
[12:18] list of sufferings in the book of 2
[12:19] Corinthians. But then he would say in 1
[12:21] Corinthians 15, he labored more than all
[12:23] the apostles by the grace of God that
[12:25] was with him. Paul was more fruitful
[12:28] because of all that he suffered. And the
[12:31] fifth and final reason we go through
[12:32] suffering is a testimony to help others
[12:35] or to judge others. So we see this in
[12:38] James 5:11. Brethren, we count them
[12:41] happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
[12:42] patience of Job and have seen the end of
[12:44] the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful
[12:46] and of tender mercy. So Job went through
[12:50] awful afflictions in order to be a
[12:52] testimony of patience. And we're told if
[12:55] we're patient, the end of God's ways for
[12:57] our lives will be very pitiful and
[12:59] merciful. So if we go through suffering,
[13:02] our testimony will help someone else
[13:04] whose suffering. Hebrews 2:17 and 18
[13:07] also speak of this. Wherefore, in all
[13:09] things, it behooved him to be to be made
[13:11] like unto his brethren, that he might be
[13:13] a merciful and faithful high priest in
[13:15] things pertaining to God, to make
[13:16] reconciliation for the sins of the
[13:18] people. For in that he himself hath
[13:20] suffered being tempted, he is able to
[13:22] secure them that are tempted. So because
[13:26] Jesus suffered, he can help others who
[13:28] are suffering. Secur means to help or
[13:30] give aid. And then Hebrews 4:15 says he
[13:34] can be touched with the feeling of our
[13:36] infirmities. So when we experience
[13:38] suffering and get through it and get
[13:40] victory over it, then we can feel what
[13:42] other people are feeling when they
[13:44] suffer and we can be a help to them. our
[13:47] testimony can help them or we can pray
[13:49] for them. There's lots of examples of
[13:51] this. Job suffered so much. He lost his
[13:54] whole family, all of his children. He
[13:55] lost all his money. Yet, he never cursed
[13:57] God. That's a great testimony to help
[14:00] everyone else who's gone through similar
[14:01] trials. Brother Brandham's youngest
[14:04] daughter, Sharon Rose, before she died,
[14:06] she had crossed eyes and that really
[14:08] stuck with brother Brandham. But then
[14:09] during his ministry, he saw crossed eyes
[14:11] healed repeatedly. So through his
[14:14] suffering of seeing his daughter pass
[14:16] away in the different condition, it led
[14:17] to a testimony to help others. God gave
[14:20] him faith to pray for other children
[14:22] that had crossed eyes. And as far as a
[14:25] testimony to judge others, we don't like
[14:27] to think of that, but there's at least
[14:28] three witnesses. The queen of the south,
[14:30] she had to cross the desert to find the
[14:33] gift of God in her day, the gift of
[14:34] Solomon's discernment and wisdom. And
[14:37] Jesus said she'd be used to judge the
[14:39] Pharisees and religious people of Jesus'
[14:41] day a thousand years after she lived
[14:44] because they wouldn't go to hear Jesus.
[14:46] The men of Nineveh repented at the
[14:48] preaching of Jonah. And Jesus said a
[14:50] greater than Jonah's here. They wouldn't
[14:52] repent at the preaching of Jesus. So the
[14:53] men of Nineveh will judge those who
[14:56] didn't repent at the preaching of the
[14:58] Lord Jesus. Then remember 1 Corinthians
[15:00] 5 and six say that the saints will judge
[15:03] the earth. The saints will judge angels.
[15:05] God will use each of our testimonies to
[15:08] judge others. Unfortunately, we don't
[15:10] like to think about that, but that's why
[15:12] God helps us overcome. But let our
[15:14] suffering be a testimony to help others
[15:16] here on this side by the grace of God.
[15:19] In closing, friends, I hope this video
[15:20] was a blessing by the grace of God. A
[15:22] great portion in the church age book
[15:24] that speaks of this subject is the
[15:25] Samriian church age. It starts with the
[15:28] conditions of the age on page 115 in the
[15:30] old book. And one of the most beautiful
[15:32] quotes in there is page 118. quote, "The
[15:35] cloudy skies and storms of life are no
[15:37] signs of God's disapproval. Neither are
[15:39] bright skies and still waters signs of
[15:41] his love and approval. His approval of
[15:44] any of us is only in the beloved. His
[15:47] love is elective which he had for us
[15:49] before the foundation of the world. Does
[15:51] he love us?" Ah, yes. But how shall we
[15:53] know? We shall know because he said so
[15:56] and manifested that he did love us. For
[15:58] he brought us to himself and gave us of
[16:00] his spirit, placing us as sons. And I
[16:02] love this last part. And how shall I
[16:04] prove my love to him? By believing what
[16:06] he said and by conducting myself with
[16:08] joy amidst the trials that he in his
[16:10] wisdom allows to come to pass. God has
[16:14] proved his love to us by sending Jesus
[16:15] Christ. He's commended his love, sending
[16:17] Christ to die on the cross, the
[16:19] righteous for the unrighteous. The Bible
[16:20] says that plainly in the book of Romans.
[16:22] But we can show our love by believing
[16:25] what he said and conducting ourselves
[16:27] with joy amidst trials. There's many,
[16:29] many verses about having joy in the
[16:31] midst of trials in the New Testament,
[16:33] such as Romans 5:es 3 and 5. I'm not
[16:36] going to read all this, but I encourage
[16:37] you to go read it. The Bible said, "We
[16:39] glory in tribulations also because
[16:42] tribulation works patience. Patience
[16:44] works experience, which is godly
[16:45] character, and experience works hope."
[16:48] James 1:es 2-4 says, "Count it all joy
[16:51] when you fall into diverse temptations,
[16:53] knowing that the trying of your faith
[16:55] workketh patience." So we can have joy
[16:57] because our patience is strengthening.
[17:00] Our faith is strengthening. And of
[17:02] course a beautiful example, Paul with
[17:04] the buffeting messenger of Satan, the
[17:07] thorn of his flesh. 2 Corinthians 12:9
[17:10] and 10. Most gladly therefore will I
[17:12] glory in my infirmities that the power
[17:14] of Christ may rest upon me. For when I
[17:16] am weak, then I am strong. We also know
[17:19] this principle. when we're really weak
[17:21] physically or suffering physically,
[17:23] we're just constantly thinking about the
[17:24] Lord, meditating on the Lord more, and
[17:26] we're actually stronger spiritually when
[17:28] we suffer. So friends, if you're going
[17:31] through suffering now, cast your cares
[17:33] on the Lord. Reach out to the Lord.
[17:36] Praise the Lord. Do all you can do to be
[17:38] joyful and be thankful for what God has
[17:41] already done for you and what he has
[17:43] promised to do for you. Although you
[17:44] might not know, you can still trust God.
[17:47] God is trustworthy. He's the only
[17:48] trustworthy one. Hallelujah. And
[17:51] remember, you're suffering partly so you
[17:53] can reign with Jesus Christ because he
[17:56] suffered for you. Surely, you can suffer
[17:58] for his cause. The suffering is
[18:01] producing character. And character is
[18:04] not a gift. Character is a victory. If
[18:07] you have any questions, concerns, or
[18:08] testimonies about this video, please
[18:10] contact me.
[18:12] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[18:14] the desire of your heart.
[18:18] very happy to be here this afternoon and
[18:20] again in a defense of the gospel of
[18:22] Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings,
[18:25] the good news that Jesus raised from the
[18:27] dead, living among man today, his
[18:29] church. The same Jesus that was
[18:32] yesterday will be today and forever. He
[18:36] is never failed.
