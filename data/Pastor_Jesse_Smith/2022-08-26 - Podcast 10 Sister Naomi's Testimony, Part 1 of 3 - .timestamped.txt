[0:00] [Music]
[0:10] god bless you and welcome to defending
[0:12] message podcast i'm your co-host pastor
[0:14] jesse smith and i'm eamon lee we're
[0:16] thankful that you're joining us here on
[0:18] the podcast today today we have another
[0:20] wonderful testimony we're going to share
[0:22] we felt led over the last few months to
[0:24] go through testimonies of the saints in
[0:27] our church of course right now there's
[0:29] an attack on the message where people
[0:30] are leaving the message and speaking bad
[0:32] about the message and saying in some
[0:34] cases the message ruined their life and
[0:36] of course we see totally different we
[0:38] see how the message has given hope to
[0:40] our lives and as brother austin's
[0:41] testimony shares it's brought
[0:42] restoration to his life and
[0:44] transformation i would say the same for
[0:46] brother amen and i and of course
[0:48] everyone in the church because the true
[0:50] definition of the message is the word of
[0:51] god that jesus christ is fulfilling
[0:54] right now in the lives of real
[0:57] christians so we're rejoicing in what
[0:59] god has done in our lives we want to
[1:00] continue here and have a testimony from
[1:02] our sister naomi she's been a wonderful
[1:04] testimony here in our church a wonderful
[1:06] example of a christian sister our sister
[1:08] and her mother started coming to our
[1:10] church around the end of 2013. i can
[1:12] still remember when they first came they
[1:13] were dressed so nicely and you could
[1:16] tell they were just ready for church and
[1:17] they entered into worship right away
[1:19] they were so humble they came to our
[1:20] humble little church like a hole in the
[1:22] wall and they've been with us ever since
[1:24] supported us in everything we've ever
[1:26] done
[1:26] and they prayed for us they've been such
[1:28] a wonderful blessing to our family and
[1:30] the church here so we're going to start
[1:31] with our sister's testimony before we
[1:34] begin i want to share a couple of things
[1:36] first i want to apologize for the low
[1:38] quality of our sister naomi's voice
[1:41] this is my fault as i forgot to change
[1:43] the audio in setting when we were
[1:45] recording the podcast so please forgive
[1:47] me for that
[1:48] but hopefully you can still hear her
[1:49] voice if you turn up your volume to
[1:51] maximum
[1:52] and also for privacy reasons we're going
[1:54] to protect our sister's last name and
[1:56] country of origin
[2:02] i'm going to start with our very first
[2:04] question what was your childhood like in
[2:06] relation to learning about jesus
[2:09] so thankfully i i was born into the
[2:12] message i was we grew up in church it
[2:15] was
[2:16] that was the normal thing go to church
[2:19] on sunday
[2:20] and then i think we used to go two days
[2:22] during the week wednesdays and fridays
[2:24] and
[2:26] like there was no excuse you go to
[2:27] church every every time there's service
[2:29] you go to church though
[2:31] that's how i that's how we grew up
[2:33] thankfully this truth was was open to us
[2:37] like right from death and then we've
[2:40] been in it we grew up with very little
[2:43] and
[2:44] with the way the message is kind of the
[2:46] messages it looks like
[2:48] like the bible says you have um
[2:50] access to everything but not everything
[2:52] is lawful for you so
[2:54] there are so many things you don't get
[2:55] yourself involved in so it looked like
[2:57] it's something that was suitable for
[2:59] like poor people because then you don't
[3:02] get to do lots of fun stuff so
[3:05] i thought it was normal because that's
[3:07] how i grew up until
[3:09] probably i got to um junior high
[3:13] and then i actually realized okay
[3:15] there's something different about us and
[3:17] because we did not have much we did not
[3:19] really grow up with family we didn't
[3:21] have a lot of i didn't have a lot of
[3:22] relationship with my
[3:24] extended family it was just my parents
[3:26] and my siblings stuff and so and then i
[3:28] had a few friends in church so
[3:30] it was probably junior high and the
[3:33] school i went to to reward uniforms the
[3:35] girls had their uniforms the boys and
[3:37] their uniforms so
[3:39] there was nothing that made me think
[3:41] that i was standing out different from
[3:42] them probably in junior high that's when
[3:44] i actually i got to the realization that
[3:47] oh okay so we dredged differently and
[3:51] there is something different about us
[3:54] so and that was probably about between
[3:56] between the ages of 10 and 12.
[3:59] that was when i actually realized okay
[4:01] so the kind of christian life you're
[4:03] living is not the normal one this is
[4:05] something different
[4:07] you know we've talked different times
[4:08] over the years sister and i remember how
[4:10] you know growing up as you said there
[4:12] was times your family lacks certain
[4:14] things so i'd like to maybe share some
[4:16] of the details about that what did you
[4:17] lack and then how did you see the lord
[4:19] intervene for you in some of those
[4:21] situations
[4:23] okay so um like i said earlier we grew
[4:25] up with very little so i mean it was and
[4:28] it's my dad working he was like a public
[4:30] servant and it wasn't much earning and
[4:32] we're like it was five of us because my
[4:34] parents saw it was seven sometimes like
[4:37] even meals is a problem but
[4:39] to the glory of god there was no there
[4:41] was not a single time that we had to go
[4:43] to bed on an empty stomach or anything
[4:46] like that
[4:46] god always provided
[4:49] sometimes we had enough sometimes we did
[4:51] not but
[4:52] i think
[4:53] god helped us as a family we're always
[4:56] together and
[4:57] however little it was we're able to
[4:59] share it usually during christmas that's
[5:01] when everybody gets like new clothes new
[5:04] shoes and things like that but
[5:06] it's not every christmas we get new
[5:08] clothes sometimes it's like
[5:10] hand-me-downs and thankfully my mom used
[5:12] to make clothes so
[5:14] sometimes during christmas she's able to
[5:16] get fabric that is if we are able to
[5:18] afford that she gets fabrics and then
[5:20] she sews clothes for us so that was the
[5:23] way we lived and even in school like the
[5:26] school uniforms like i said we wear
[5:29] school uniforms so
[5:30] we pass it down and then
[5:33] when the school year starts when we do
[5:35] not always go with new shoes and
[5:37] sometimes it was
[5:39] it was a little hard on you because you
[5:41] want to go to school with new shoes but
[5:44] i mean your parents cannot afford it and
[5:46] now i look back and i'm thankful that
[5:48] then god gave us even though we wanted
[5:51] it and we couldn't have it god still
[5:52] gave us that contentment in our hearts
[5:55] like
[5:56] we were okay we didn't go um
[5:58] doing anything that we wanted or
[6:01] like trying to get new issues away i
[6:03] mean we just couldn't afford it we
[6:05] accepted that that is how it is yeah and
[6:08] going to school my parents did their
[6:10] best to even though they did not have
[6:12] much to take us to the best schools
[6:14] around sometimes it was a struggle
[6:15] paying school fees and
[6:17] but to the glory of god yeah he he kept
[6:20] us
[6:21] he he provided for us and
[6:24] i ultimately ended up in college i did
[6:26] not take student loan or anything
[6:29] my dad paid my fees
[6:31] my sister i wasn't the only one in
[6:33] school my siblings were also in school
[6:34] but we didn't take students loans or
[6:37] anything he
[6:38] he worked hard
[6:39] and god provided
[6:41] yeah i love that this part of your
[6:43] testimony you know we've been at the
[6:44] church we've been looking at how god
[6:45] calls
[6:46] some rich some poor you know god has a
[6:49] different calling in life for each and
[6:50] every person
[6:52] and so in your case you know god started
[6:53] you or god called you in a spot where
[6:56] economic times were harder and so your
[6:58] dad had to work super hard and you had
[7:00] to basically work your way out of
[7:01] poverty but in each step god always
[7:04] provided he provided the food
[7:06] the clothing and then schooling which is
[7:09] a huge blessing too because there are
[7:10] some countries where their their
[7:12] families can't afford school
[7:13] and so god through his mercy and through
[7:15] the hard work of mom and dad everybody
[7:17] working together praying together
[7:19] god provided all things for your family
[7:21] so i think that's a beautiful testimony
[7:22] of god's provision
[7:29] so it's wonderful to hear that you were
[7:31] raised in the house of god with parents
[7:32] that were godly and loved you when and
[7:35] why do you think you finally surrendered
[7:36] to jesus can you remember when you gave
[7:38] your heart to the lord and maybe what
[7:40] led you to repent and become a christian
[7:42] yourself
[7:43] okay so um
[7:45] i was i was very actively involved in
[7:47] church because that was
[7:49] that was just how it was it was just
[7:52] go to school in church those were the
[7:54] only two places i was going to school in
[7:56] church so we're very actively involved
[7:58] in church like cleaning and getting the
[8:01] church ready and all the
[8:03] everything that goes in
[8:05] church stuff
[8:07] so
[8:08] growing up we used to see like the power
[8:10] of god moving church and
[8:13] people screaming and prophesying and
[8:17] most services are like that so i had
[8:20] then
[8:21] she was my best friend that was the only
[8:23] best friend i had and then we went to
[8:24] the same school so
[8:26] when we go to school
[8:28] like
[8:30] on mondays that's after church on
[8:32] sundays then we asked ourselves then we
[8:33] used to call it or the anointing of god
[8:35] fell so we asked ourselves did the
[8:37] anointing fall on you today
[8:39] it was something like we're asking
[8:41] ourselves every time on mondays when we
[8:42] go to church did anointing follow you
[8:45] and then you're like no so
[8:47] we got to a point where we declared our
[8:49] own fastings like okay today we are
[8:51] going to fast and then pray
[8:53] i think that i'll probably be
[8:55] that was in junior high so i was
[8:57] probably about
[8:58] 11 years
[9:00] thereabout
[9:02] so we'll organize our own fasting and
[9:04] then pray about it and then even
[9:06] sometimes at church when they say we
[9:08] should fast and
[9:09] i do not fast or
[9:11] maybe i just break my fast in the middle
[9:13] of the day i am so scared when i go to
[9:15] church because i feel like prophecy is
[9:17] going to break for that i did not do the
[9:20] faster i ate so it was it was that kind
[9:23] of like fear because
[9:25] sometimes sins are called out in the
[9:27] church people prophesy and they call out
[9:29] sin in the church so when you're going
[9:31] to church with and then you are not
[9:32] right like you are really scared because
[9:35] anything could happen in
[9:37] i can't even imagine how that would feel
[9:39] so
[9:40] you wanted to get everything right so i
[9:42] think that was that i was around that
[9:44] time and i was longing to see what i was
[9:46] seeing in people i was seeing the spirit
[9:48] of god move on people i wanted to also
[9:51] feel it
[9:52] so i think i was praying about it and
[9:54] then
[9:55] the spirit of god was moving towards
[9:57] also praying asking god to to grant it
[10:00] to me
[10:00] and then one time we went to church
[10:03] and then after service we all got up to
[10:05] pray i wasn't feeling myself there was
[10:07] something different
[10:09] i wasn't too sure what it was but i knew
[10:11] there was something different so they
[10:13] asked all of us to sit down and i
[10:15] realized i couldn't sit like my hands
[10:17] were that was when i realized i was
[10:19] actually crying
[10:21] so i was crying and screaming and
[10:24] i couldn't stop crying i think i cried
[10:26] all through the service
[10:28] the rest of the service until the
[10:30] service ended and then even after the
[10:32] service when everybody left i was still
[10:34] in the
[10:35] church and then i was i was still crying
[10:37] so i think my dad came for me and then
[10:39] took me to the pastor and then
[10:41] we prayed and then my dad did not have a
[10:43] car so he had to get a friend who had a
[10:45] car and then they put me in the car and
[10:47] then drove me home and i was still
[10:49] crying
[10:50] so i i believe that was when i was
[10:53] filled with with the spirit of god and i
[10:55] think it was probably shortly after that
[10:58] that i got baptized yeah i got baptized
[11:01] before i went to um senior high so it
[11:04] was probably shortly after that
[11:06] i got baptized
[11:08] and
[11:09] i thank god
[11:10] god has been gracious god has been very
[11:13] gracious to me
[11:15] i can relate to sister naomi how she
[11:17] says
[11:18] you know in her church growing up there
[11:19] was a lot of gifts of the spirit i was
[11:21] raised in a denominational pentecostal
[11:23] trinitarian church and there was tongues
[11:26] almost every week i would consistently
[11:28] feel the presence of god i would feel
[11:29] the conviction of my sin but also like
[11:32] our sister when she got to
[11:35] senior high i would see the spirit fall
[11:37] when i'd see people speak in tongues but
[11:39] then i would watch their lives
[11:41] afterwards and their lives didn't match
[11:43] the word of god and so
[11:45] that was a little bit confusing there
[11:46] for me when i was younger as well well
[11:48] that's one thing we should all learn as
[11:49] a church if we want to see the
[11:51] supernatural we got to pray for the
[11:52] supernatural there was gifts in the
[11:54] church operating so they were coming to
[11:55] church with expectation and that's
[11:57] something we can learn here in 2022
[12:00] you know we want our young people to
[12:01] experience the spirit of god the
[12:03] presence of god
[12:05] gifts of the holy spirit well it's our
[12:07] duty as adults right to come and pray
[12:10] and the bible says that we must covet
[12:11] the best gifts so we must come together
[12:14] and pray and ask for the spirit of god
[12:15] to move
[12:16] and then when it moves on us it'll make
[12:19] the children want the holy spirit to
[12:20] move on them so that's another wonderful
[12:22] lesson that we can learn their adults
[12:24] created such an atmosphere that the
[12:26] children wanted to fall under that
[12:27] atmosphere and so that's what we want to
[12:29] we want to create an atmosphere where
[12:30] the children will be hungering and
[12:32] thirsting for righteousness want to fast
[12:34] want to pray want to be born again want
[12:37] the anointing to fall on them so as
[12:39] adults we can we can model that for them
[12:41] by god's grace
[12:47] about what age was senior high so
[12:50] so we can kind of place this for the
[12:51] young people and those listening you got
[12:53] the holy ghost before you went to senior
[12:55] high so that's a great testimony that's
[12:57] a powerful testimony it shows you were
[12:58] raised in a church that believed in
[13:00] justification and sanctification and
[13:02] that it already happened in your life
[13:04] but any idea about what age was senior
[13:06] high started
[13:07] my senior high was between 13 and 15
[13:10] years it was it was two years
[13:12] praise god that i think it's great to
[13:14] identify that you know the fact that she
[13:16] received the holy ghost before she was
[13:18] 13. what a beautiful testimony how god
[13:21] can work
[13:22] in young people's lives i hope those
[13:24] listening on the podcast and all of our
[13:27] children in our home church can see how
[13:29] important it is to pray did all the
[13:32] children hear that i hope all of our
[13:34] listeners heard that too they set up
[13:35] their own prayer meetings
[13:37] before they're 13 years old
[13:40] because they got she got the holy ghost
[13:41] before she was 13. what a beautiful
[13:43] testimony
[13:44] of the spirit of god drawing a person
[13:47] and then also the person responding
[13:49] because like she said she didn't have to
[13:50] fast or she didn't have to do that she
[13:52] was led to do that she chose to do that
[13:55] and she obeyed that so i hope that's an
[13:56] encouragement to all the young people
[13:58] listening and also the young people in
[13:59] our church
[14:00] that they will see that god can use you
[14:03] at any age god wants in fact the younger
[14:05] the better praise god the the younger
[14:07] you can repent and get justified and
[14:09] sanctified then god can fill you with
[14:11] the holy ghost and again this testimony
[14:13] her testimony validates acts chapter 10
[14:17] how those in corneas house received the
[14:19] holy ghost before they were baptized in
[14:21] water
[14:22] so her testimony is another support or
[14:25] proof that you can get the holy ghost
[14:26] before you're baptized in water
[14:29] because she was already living a
[14:30] sanctified life
[14:32] so that's a great testimony
[14:39] so in your life sister it seems like
[14:40] from 13 to 15 you were outside of your
[14:43] home you were attending a boarding
[14:45] school which is totally different from
[14:46] america in most cases i know some
[14:48] families that are rich can send their
[14:49] kids away to private schools but most
[14:52] kids do public education or
[14:54] homeschooling so your your testimony is
[14:56] very unique in the fact that
[14:59] you had the holy ghost and then it was
[15:01] like kind of like jesus's life you were
[15:03] sent off to be tested and tried
[15:05] uh at the boarding school so are there
[15:07] any testimonies you want to share about
[15:09] that experience that might help
[15:10] teenagers or
[15:12] anyone that would maybe be outside of
[15:14] home and
[15:16] not living at home but still wanting to
[15:18] to live for jesus christ
[15:20] when he goes most of the senior high
[15:22] schools are born in houses so you'd
[15:25] take your stuff leave home and then go
[15:27] stay on the campus for
[15:29] probably about three to four months till
[15:31] the semester ends and then
[15:33] when the semester
[15:34] ends you go you go home for a couple of
[15:36] weeks and then come come back so i had
[15:39] to leave home at 13 and then go to the
[15:41] boarding house and
[15:44] like i earlier said it was around junior
[15:46] high that i realized that okay there was
[15:47] something different about us
[15:50] then when i got to senior high
[15:53] i actually saw okay like
[15:56] we're really different
[15:58] when i looked at
[15:59] the clothes of my
[16:01] classmates and then mine like especially
[16:04] the necklines and then the length of the
[16:06] dresses like mine was
[16:09] always higher the neck was higher the
[16:11] dress was more the the length was
[16:14] much longer
[16:15] and
[16:17] what baffled me was that
[16:19] most of them were christians
[16:21] like most of them were christians and
[16:23] they could speak in tongues and
[16:25] yeah it was a public school so on sunday
[16:28] um
[16:30] the catholics will have their own place
[16:32] together the pentecostals will have
[16:33] their own place together the methodists
[16:36] will have their own place together
[16:38] and this was the very first time i'm
[16:39] going to a church outside my church
[16:41] so
[16:42] i'm like okay i can't do a catholic i
[16:45] don't like metadata so i'll just do the
[16:47] pentecostals so i go there they pray
[16:50] they speak in tongues and all that but
[16:52] then
[16:54] after afterwards when we go back to the
[16:56] dorm
[16:57] they they live all kinds of lives like
[17:00] they're talking about boyfriends
[17:02] girlfriends and i was i was very naive
[17:05] to those things like i had no idea what
[17:07] they were
[17:08] so i'm like what baffled me was on
[17:10] sunday we go to church and like they're
[17:12] speaking and so and they can't even pray
[17:14] like much harder than me saying and all
[17:17] that so i was like
[17:18] okay like what what is going on here
[17:21] and then also because of my age
[17:24] you know
[17:26] at the teenage age you want to feel like
[17:28] a sense of belonging you want to be part
[17:30] of the people that you are with
[17:32] sometimes you
[17:34] you want to conform
[17:36] so that you can be accepted you don't
[17:38] want to look like you're a weird person
[17:41] and these are people you're living with
[17:43] every day so you don't want to appear
[17:44] like anything like you're weird or
[17:47] sometimes they'll tease you and call you
[17:48] um
[17:49] cre-faith
[17:51] they call you craft that's yeah like a
[17:53] holy roller or something and
[17:55] you know as much as you're a christian
[17:56] you want to be identified as a christian
[17:59] you don't want to be seen as like
[18:02] a christian that is to the extreme
[18:05] so you try to uh kind of do some of the
[18:08] things that they do so you can you can
[18:09] confirm sometimes they even come to you
[18:11] and then
[18:12] um tell you we are all christians
[18:15] so there is nothing wrong with this
[18:17] one of the very vivid memories i have is
[18:20] in senior high school is um
[18:22] probably i was i was probably in my
[18:25] second year
[18:26] no it was the first year
[18:28] so on saturdays we have entertainment
[18:30] programs
[18:32] every saturday we go for entertainment
[18:33] it could be singing it could be anything
[18:36] and then um
[18:38] when the first years come in
[18:40] they entertain the school so they have a
[18:42] nice way everybody will dress so funny
[18:44] and then you come in you dress funny and
[18:46] then come in entertain and then one time
[18:48] the entertainment show was
[18:51] was modeling
[18:52] so you wear your clothes and then you
[18:54] come and muddle so
[18:57] you had to get your parents to send you
[18:59] clothes so my mom sent me clothes of
[19:02] course that's the dress and long skirt
[19:04] and then
[19:06] everybody was excited before before the
[19:08] the show everybody was excited i mean
[19:10] days before the show everybody was
[19:11] excited we're talking about our clothes
[19:13] and
[19:14] this person said oh see what i got see
[19:16] what i got and then i bring my out and
[19:18] everybody starts laughing like
[19:21] how possibly can you wear a then like
[19:23] this to
[19:24] the modeling like no
[19:27] you need to get something else
[19:29] i'm like are you sure you're like yeah
[19:32] and of course i wanted to feel like i
[19:34] was part of them so
[19:36] i put my clothes down and then took what
[19:39] they gave me
[19:40] which was
[19:42] not appropriate so that was what i wore
[19:44] today modeling
[19:46] and then
[19:48] i got up there and then modeled in the
[19:50] clothing i came back and i was crying
[19:54] i'm like
[19:55] i disappointed girl this was not right i
[19:57] shouldn't have won those clothes
[19:59] and i was crying
[20:02] so some friends came in there like why
[20:04] are you crying like i shouldn't i
[20:06] shouldn't put on what i put on
[20:09] you're like there's nothing wrong with
[20:10] it you were not naked there was nothing
[20:12] wrong with it i'm like no this is not
[20:14] appropriate
[20:15] and
[20:17] they were christians so i thought they
[20:18] would understand but they just kind of
[20:20] brushed it off
[20:21] and i dealt with the guilt for like
[20:23] years i called my mom i told you like
[20:25] this is what i did and i felt like god
[20:28] will not forgive me i was
[20:31] it took me years to recover from that
[20:33] guilt i think that was
[20:35] that was
[20:36] my major mistaking
[20:38] in senior high and
[20:41] i regretted it and
[20:43] i was like that was when i told myself
[20:46] okay i can leave like everybody else
[20:48] this is me i have to
[20:50] i have to stand on my ground and if
[20:52] you'd accept me fine if you wouldn't
[20:54] accept me like this is me because i can
[20:57] i can live like everybody there the
[20:59] feeling of guilt was so immersed on me
[21:02] it was it was horrible and i'm like
[21:05] never again so that was that was the
[21:08] time that was the point that
[21:11] i was like i i don't have to give in to
[21:13] peer pressure this is me everybody is
[21:16] different this is this is the path that
[21:18] god is carrying for me and i can do
[21:21] otherwise because that the feeling of
[21:23] guilt was was terrible it was terrible
[21:26] and the part that hurt me most was those
[21:28] around me like the friends that were
[21:30] around me that i saw as christians did
[21:32] not understand why
[21:34] they thought i was overreacting did not
[21:36] understand why i should feel that sense
[21:39] of guilt and nobody understood me so i'm
[21:41] like okay
[21:43] i can't be understood by people so i
[21:45] just have to go and
[21:47] live like i should leave
[21:49] if you want to be my friend this is me
[21:51] if you don't want to be my friend
[21:53] because of the life i live well that's
[21:55] that's up to you so i think that was
[21:58] that was my major thing in senior high
[22:01] then i went to college
[22:04] and because of that experience i had in
[22:06] senior high i think it's
[22:08] it helped me very much in my college
[22:11] years because then
[22:12] i had accepted like
[22:14] this is how i'm supposed to dress so
[22:17] i don't feel bad for it i accept it
[22:21] of course you have you've had people
[22:23] passing comments about you but this is
[22:26] how to live and have a free conscience
[22:28] and have a good relationship with god so
[22:31] that's how i've always lived
[22:33] yeah we appreciate you sharing that
[22:34] personal testimony what a great example
[22:37] of the conviction power of the holy
[22:39] spirit like when a person makes a
[22:41] mistake personally i can't imagine
[22:43] i didn't serve god when i was a teenager
[22:45] i can't imagine
[22:47] the pressure that would have been on you
[22:48] sister so it's awesome to see that god
[22:51] allowed you to go through this her
[22:54] sister lived different than her previous
[22:55] convictions just one time and the amount
[22:58] of conviction that came upon her proves
[23:00] she had the born-again experience
[23:02] right because if she wasn't born again
[23:04] she would not have been convicted so
[23:06] severely
[23:07] or so consistently regarding her sin and
[23:11] i thought what a great proof that is
[23:12] that you were born again and it took you
[23:14] years to get over then that shows how
[23:16] sincere you are with god how you want to
[23:18] honor god's word
[23:20] and contrast that with the pentecostal
[23:22] people who can sin and it doesn't bother
[23:25] them at all but when a holy ghost-filled
[23:27] person sins the spirit of god is right
[23:29] there it's dwelling in their soul and
[23:31] it's right there to convict them and
[23:33] will lead them to quick obedience
[23:35] so what a what a great testimony of you
[23:37] get the holy ghost before you're 13 and
[23:39] then you get tested in your teens
[23:41] you make one mistake and god is right
[23:44] there to bring conviction bring
[23:46] correction and then you're able to stand
[23:48] the rest of your life really
[23:51] so god had to bring you through this
[23:52] trial
[23:53] so you could learn a lesson
[23:55] overcome and really gain power to stand
[23:58] as you went into the later years of
[24:00] college and now all through adulthood as
[24:02] well by god's grace
[24:09] i want to go back to when our sister
[24:10] received the baptism of holy ghost
[24:12] before she was 13 i want all of our
[24:14] listeners especially our our young
[24:16] people in the church to catch this i
[24:18] just thought it was wonderful that her
[24:20] and her friends were asking each other
[24:22] every monday did the holy ghost fall on
[24:24] you did god anoint you i mean
[24:28] that's so that's so wonderful it's so
[24:29] wonderful that they were talking every
[24:31] monday did the holy ghost visit you did
[24:33] he did he pour out his spirit on you
[24:35] what a beautiful
[24:37] uh testimony of inviting god's presence
[24:39] remember brother brahm said the more you
[24:40] talk about jesus the more he'll come
[24:43] right as soon as you start talking about
[24:44] him he'll come and i love the fact that
[24:46] he and her friends were talking about
[24:48] the holy ghost
[24:49] and she was hungry for the holy ghost
[24:51] and she was saying no didn't follow me
[24:53] but the fact that she was talking about
[24:55] it and the more
[24:56] they did talk about it eventually the
[24:58] holy ghost did fall on it so i'd like
[25:00] you to share a little bit more about
[25:02] do you remember what was preached like
[25:04] that exact moment the holy ghost fell
[25:05] upon you or maybe what you were singing
[25:07] because it was such a wonderful
[25:08] testimony and maybe just give us an
[25:10] estimate about how long
[25:12] were you singing there crying and when
[25:15] your dad had to go get the car you know
[25:16] someone else's borrow the car to take
[25:18] you home can you just give us a little
[25:19] more detail about that and because that
[25:21] was the moment you had talked about you
[25:23] prayed for
[25:24] and then god finally came and anointed
[25:26] you so maybe share a little bit more
[25:27] about that if you can
[25:29] i do not remember the same one that was
[25:32] preached but the song that was singing i
[25:34] remember i was past me not of gentle
[25:36] savior
[25:38] and
[25:39] so that was it was the end of the
[25:41] service and then we're praying the the
[25:43] preaching had ended and then we were
[25:45] praying and then singing
[25:48] and then i think the spirit of god fell
[25:50] that day so it was a little longer
[25:52] probably about
[25:54] 30 45 minutes and then church ended but
[25:57] i was still in church
[25:59] crying and
[26:01] it will probably be about
[26:03] two three hours like when i finally got
[26:05] home
[26:06] yeah because my my dad is a as
[26:09] he was an elder
[26:11] in the church so after church they have
[26:13] to it was a bigger church so after
[26:15] church they have to
[26:17] do a few things and then his friend was
[26:20] also
[26:20] he was a trustee
[26:22] so after church they have to take care
[26:24] of the offering and a few church
[26:27] problems here and then things that needs
[26:29] to be done so it takes a while before
[26:31] they they go home every time we get off
[26:34] church we have to
[26:35] sit behind for at least an hour
[26:38] before we get home so
[26:40] i will probably be about two three hours
[26:44] when i finally got one
[26:46] yeah that's a great testimony example of
[26:47] crying out for the power of god
[26:50] pleading with god let the holy spirit
[26:52] follow me and then god finally answers
[26:54] how long do you think you and your
[26:55] friends were talking about that
[26:56] anointing until it finally fell on you
[26:58] personally
[27:00] we talked about it we talked about it a
[27:02] long time because we're seeing the
[27:04] spirit of god move in church so i was in
[27:07] junior high that i actually
[27:09] became conscious of everything
[27:11] so that was about 10 years old
[27:14] so probably probably for
[27:16] for about
[27:18] six months to a year we're talking about
[27:20] it
[27:20] yeah it was something we were talking
[27:22] about sometimes we go to church and we
[27:25] cry sometimes we see the spirit of god
[27:27] and we're doing
[27:29] she was my best friend in chief we're
[27:30] doing some specials together and
[27:33] yeah we were really close and when i
[27:36] went to when i went to senior i would
[27:37] write each she did not go to a boarding
[27:39] school
[27:40] she was in a day school so she was still
[27:42] going to church and all but i was in the
[27:44] boarding school so i had to we write
[27:46] each other letters and
[27:48] tell them i can't wait to come to church
[27:50] and
[27:52] all that kind of stuff
[27:53] uh what a great lesson for our young
[27:55] people that when you seek the lord it's
[27:57] really helpful to have a friend there
[27:58] too so the sister naomi was not only
[28:00] seeking god by herself but a friend was
[28:02] encouraging her so let we can encourage
[28:04] our young people
[28:05] as you seek the lord find a god-fearing
[28:08] friend young young sisters in our church
[28:10] and talk about the lord just talk about
[28:12] the things of god be under expectation
[28:14] so you can see in that those six months
[28:16] leading up to before she was filled with
[28:18] the holy ghost
[28:19] you know she was
[28:20] seeking the face of god and didn't the
[28:22] bible say if you seek me you'll find me
[28:24] what a wonderful testimony of god
[28:27] backing up his promise if you seek me
[28:28] with all your heart you'll find me
[28:35] okay uh we just finished our first part
[28:38] of this testimony and we're gonna make
[28:39] another part very soon
[28:41] and i hope you were blessed by this
[28:43] honorable and this testimony from our
[28:45] dear sister naomi
[28:47] yeah thank you for listening and hope
[28:48] these testimonies have been a blessing
[28:51] we know that the lord jesus christ is
[28:53] working our lives and this message which
[28:56] is the revelations god gave us out of
[28:58] the bible are transformative
[29:00] and so we hope you enjoy this direction
[29:02] that we're going we can see it transform
[29:05] our sister's life and our testimony and
[29:06] brother austin's life in the previous
[29:08] testimony so we hope you'll stay tuned
[29:10] and i hope these uh stories are speaking
[29:13] to your heart especially for a young
[29:15] person here's a young person raising the
[29:16] message and if you seek god even when
[29:18] you're young you'll find god god will
[29:21] reveal himself to you
[29:22] if you're thirsty for god if you're
[29:24] hungry for god surely you'll be filled
[29:26] so god bless each one of you and may the
[29:28] lord jesus christ anoint you to defend
[29:30] the message
[29:33] [Music]
[29:48] do
[29:49] [Music]
[30:21] you
