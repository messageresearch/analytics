[0:00] that's really handy if that is going to
[0:02] we'll see how that uh the air stays off
[0:05] or not because I just want to play a few
[0:07] clips from brother brandom tonight and
[0:08] also teach from the word of God I
[0:11] thought it might help us uh uh
[0:14] especially as a young a young group of
[0:16] Believers as you are as far as young in
[0:17] the Revelation that God's revealed in
[0:19] this hour I thought I'd play a couple um
[0:23] uh uh sermon audios from brother brandom
[0:26] and I tried to find my loudest device
[0:28] this so far this iPad was the loudest
[0:29] one
[0:30] it was louder than my phone there so
[0:32] I'll probably have to hold it up so
[0:33] everybody can hear but I want you to
[0:34] actually hear what it was like in some
[0:36] of those meetings some of those songs
[0:38] and uh it'll be a great blessing to you
[0:41] I'm sure like it's been a great blessing
[0:43] to me all these years you know I've
[0:44] heard the I first heard uh the message
[0:46] on no on November uh 2001 on
[0:50] Thanksgiving night I heard the message
[0:51] for the first time I heard serpent seat
[0:54] that's a first message Simon's like you
[0:55] got to listen to this Jesse you got to
[0:57] listen to this I'm like okay man okay
[0:58] I'll listen to it he kept he kept
[1:00] pushing on me and I it was like it was
[1:03] like two or three 4 hours of just like
[1:05] uh I couldn't believe it spiritual
[1:07] Revelation eyes open and I'm like and
[1:09] I'm wow I I just started seeing the the
[1:11] world in a whole new way along with the
[1:13] Bible Hallelujah and it's been a life
[1:15] transformation ever since Hallelujah so
[1:17] I thank the Lord for his grace thank I
[1:19] thank the Lord for thus sayeth the Lord
[1:21] hallelujah maybe I'll preach that next
[1:22] time uh I just got a whole sermon on all
[1:24] that thus sayth the Lord Brother man
[1:25] preach that pertain to doctrine that
[1:28] pertain to Mysteries and beautiful
[1:30] message praise God and all the future
[1:31] prophecies you know with the Vatican and
[1:33] Russia and different prophecies it's
[1:35] just a beautiful message to know we
[1:37] don't have thus sayth some denomination
[1:39] we have thus sayith the Lord Jesus
[1:41] Christ amen hallelujah it's a beautiful
[1:43] thought so uh you know I guess I thought
[1:46] I would preach this I think last week or
[1:49] no two weeks ago I left here and I
[1:50] thought I'd like to preach on just
[1:52] worship scriptures and music and the
[1:54] power of it um just some general
[1:57] scriptures so we started there in second
[1:59] Kings and this is of course Elisha he
[2:02] was the prophet right after Elijah and
[2:05] this in this case brother man makes it's
[2:07] a kind of a humorous story brother R
[2:08] makes this very humorous he said the
[2:10] prophet Elisha was kind of in a bad mood
[2:12] that day and then two kings come to him
[2:15] and he he said he liked one of them he
[2:17] liked Jehoshaphat but he didn't like
[2:19] ahab's son because he knew ahab's son
[2:21] was a rascal just like
[2:23] Ahab and uh you know they they asked for
[2:25] the word of the Lord and Elisha's like
[2:27] he's like I don't want to do it but I'll
[2:29] do it for jehoshaphat's
[2:31] sake so if you just know the story I
[2:34] that's a great lesson you know as as as
[2:35] Christians we don't like the sins that
[2:39] Sinners do right we love the sinner but
[2:42] we hate the sin yeah amen H but
[2:44] sometimes we're moved if somebody has a
[2:46] request sometimes we're moved by that
[2:47] request and we've got to move past our
[2:49] feelings right and we've got to do the
[2:52] word of the Lord we've got to serve
[2:54] other people yeah and so we find Elisha
[2:57] doing that but I want you to notice did
[2:59] you notice how did the hand of God come
[3:01] upon him think about when the hand of
[3:02] God's come upon you healed you revealed
[3:05] the word to you you know where there's
[3:08] been numerous times in my life I felt
[3:09] like I'm just I'm doing exactly what God
[3:11] wants me to do right now I God is I I've
[3:14] just known it God is speaking through me
[3:16] right now you know I've just known that
[3:17] different times in my life uh different
[3:19] times when I cast out devils and uh
[3:21] preach different messages you know I've
[3:24] just known it I don't know how I I just
[3:25] you just know it am it's the hand of God
[3:28] that comes on you praise God
[3:30] amen well Elisha needs to prophesy he
[3:34] needs to use his gift right because they
[3:36] want they want thus said the Lord so
[3:38] what does he do does he uh does he go
[3:41] check the news
[3:43] no what does he do does he go call his
[3:46] dad or his uncle or his grandma no he
[3:50] says bring me a Minstrel and a Minstrel
[3:52] is a skilled player on the string
[3:54] instrument so maybe he brought a harp in
[3:57] maybe he brought some type of other I
[3:59] don't know other another string
[4:01] instrument but it's just a great
[4:04] reminder when we want God's hand on us
[4:06] we got to worship God Amen you got to
[4:09] start praising the name of the Lord amen
[4:12] hallelujah isn't that how David cast out
[4:15] the demons off of Saul he was all Saul
[4:18] was all discouraged and all he was so
[4:20] rebellious against God and these
[4:22] advisers say hey we know how to get the
[4:24] spirit off we know how to get the spirit
[4:26] off uh go get David praise God Amen go
[4:30] get the man who can play worship
[4:32] hallelujah praise God now hopefully the
[4:34] three songs we sang tonight if you had
[4:35] any uh frustration about today hopefully
[4:37] that set you free praise
[4:39] God don't you find that I find that all
[4:41] the time I'll go into a church service
[4:43] brother Aaron I'll be tired and
[4:45] discouraged I worked all day or I'm
[4:46] tired I'll be yawning but somebody if
[4:49] somebody plays the right song I'll just
[4:51] be off I'll be all happy again I I
[4:54] forget about all my trials amen amen
[4:56] because that's what music is there for
[4:58] amen music music is there to drive away
[5:00] doubts amen it's there to drive away sin
[5:03] and drive away unbelief and drive away
[5:05] all these things that's what music does
[5:07] it brings the hand of God on you praise
[5:09] God it's exactly right that's the word
[5:11] of God
[5:13] hallelujah so I just want to open up
[5:15] with this one just to show you you can
[5:17] be in a bad mood yeah we all get in bad
[5:20] moods sometimes right we don't like to
[5:23] admit it all the time but we we do well
[5:25] one way to get out of that is to start
[5:27] worshiping amen yes amen hallelujah
[5:29] absolutely and so uh and let me just
[5:31] encourage you this you're a new church
[5:33] you're a young young group of Believers
[5:34] as far as you're coming out to new new
[5:37] beliefs there's going to be Services
[5:39] where it starts off hard or starts off
[5:41] discouraged but keep keep doing the
[5:43] services Because by the end everything
[5:45] can change how many is a witness of that
[5:49] how many times have I seen I've been
[5:50] preaching 19 years I mean how many times
[5:53] you know people are tired and they're
[5:55] discouraged but you just press through
[5:56] you just keep trusting God you keep
[5:58] quoting God you you keep singing worship
[6:01] you keep giving God adoration but by the
[6:03] end everybody's happy and you walk out
[6:05] of there God has answered prayers people
[6:07] feeling they shaking hands hugging and
[6:10] and the love of God is back in the
[6:12] church praise God this is how God does
[6:14] it through worship thank you brother
[6:16] irin I appreciate that I I'm sorry your
[6:19] house is going to get kind of hot now so
[6:21] but at least we're downstairs
[6:23] amen hallelujah now there are many many
[6:26] scriptures uh I could go through I'm
[6:28] going to try to watch the time but
[6:32] before I get to that Saints I want to
[6:33] play this I thought this would be good
[6:36] um I want to play you a time where
[6:39] brother brandham and this goes back to
[6:40] two Thursdays ago brother brandham saw
[6:43] the Holy Ghost fall and you can hear
[6:45] people be born again after I preach here
[6:48] four people come up and told me after I
[6:50] preached last time last Thursday on the
[6:51] Holy Ghost four people come up and said
[6:53] that's exactly what they needed to hear
[6:56] so I thought well people really need to
[6:57] hear that let me play one where the Holy
[7:00] Ghost Falls so you can hear what it
[7:01] sounds like now remember it's got to
[7:03] fall the same way every time not the
[7:06] same sounds necessarily but it's got to
[7:08] produce something you can see and
[7:11] something you can hear no sure this is
[7:13] from the sermon God hiding himself and
[7:15] simplicity it was the first sermon
[7:17] brother R preached after the seventh
[7:19] seal after the the week of on the seals
[7:22] he went out to Albuquerque and he
[7:24] preached out there it is one of the most
[7:26] beautiful sermons I've ever heard
[7:27] brother man preach now there's a lot of
[7:29] there's lot of beautiful sermons brother
[7:30] preach but almost all of them right all
[7:32] of them we'd say but what I'm saying is
[7:34] this one has meant a lot to me so uh
[7:37] hopefully this will work now with the
[7:39] audio and I'll try to play it here
[7:42] truth way all I'm going to go
[7:47] back so help me the Holy Spirit here so
[7:51] help me Jesus Christ in here have I ever
[7:54] told you anything wrong is here but
[7:56] there's
[7:58] something
[8:00] so the people have been praying for the
[8:01] Holy Ghost maybe for 5 or 10 minutes he
[8:06] says he said I see a light circling
[8:08] right across the building back and forth
[8:11] now
[8:14] listen look people are
[8:17] shouting they're praying really loud
[8:20] there you go there you
[8:23] go that's way struck a little lady over
[8:26] here that's way struck another there you
[8:28] go you
[8:29] [Music]
[8:31] screaming saw the Holy Ghost anoint
[8:35] [Music]
[8:36] her was somewhere prise God there you
[8:41] areen it's like an emergency happened
[8:43] but it wasn't it was eternal
[8:45] [Applause]
[8:46] life another he sees the Holy Ghost drop
[8:50] on each of these
[8:52] people he's the way the truth the
[8:54] [Applause]
[8:56] life except that life fallen on others
[8:59] accept it while it's falling on others
[9:01] all the place holy I'm not excited I'm
[9:06] telling you the
[9:09] [Music]
[9:12] truth Glory that's right you can hear
[9:14] all the people praying right they're all
[9:17] praying some are louder than others but
[9:18] they're all praying stand there minutes
[9:20] stay right there he said you haven't
[9:22] been standing there five minutes yet
[9:24] I'll pause it right there isn't that
[9:27] amazing the people there's praying now
[9:29] some people feel led to pray out loud
[9:31] and that's what you need to do sometimes
[9:33] right we're going to prove that by the
[9:34] scripture God likes loud there's times
[9:37] God likes loud praise there's times
[9:39] God's like God likes loud praying loud
[9:42] worshiping okay and this is an
[9:44] atmosphere where the Holy Ghost Falls
[9:47] because the people are praying for it
[9:49] now later at once it quiets down brother
[9:52] Bram said I saw the Holy Spirit as a
[9:54] pillar of fire it fell on the woman he
[9:56] said and her hand shot up so before she
[9:59] screamed like it sounds like somebody's
[10:01] dying right well she was dying to
[10:03] herself spiritually she was dying out to
[10:06] her unbelief so the order was brother
[10:08] Ram saw the Holy Ghost and first she
[10:10] threw her hands up and then brother R
[10:11] said look there it is she's filled with
[10:12] the Holy Ghost and then she starts
[10:14] screaming so see the reaction was throw
[10:18] hands up Holy Ghost Falls and then she
[10:20] starts screaming and praising God and
[10:22] then another guy Scream another I think
[10:24] brother BR said five people got the Holy
[10:25] Ghost in that shower he called it we
[10:28] just got a shower an hour ago right an
[10:31] inch of water right that's what that was
[10:33] Hallelujah and a holy ghost shower
[10:35] Hallelujah but you got to create an
[10:37] atmosphere they were singing they were
[10:39] you can hear brother M he'll go he'll go
[10:40] down and sing you know I can hear my
[10:43] savior calling you know he just sings
[10:45] These simple hymns but the people are
[10:47] hungry for God oh then the Holy Ghost
[10:50] Falls when they really start worshiping
[10:51] God hallelujah all right now I just
[10:53] thought I'd share that just uh and you
[10:55] can go listen to that actually you know
[10:57] if you don't have time to listen to the
[10:58] sermon just go to the last 45 minutes of
[11:00] the sermon and you can hear them start
[11:02] praying the Holy Ghost Falls it's just a
[11:05] I've used it with our church uh we've
[11:07] had the Holy Ghost fall in our church
[11:08] you know numerous times I use it in
[11:10] other churches sometimes you need to
[11:12] hear what that sounds like right
[11:15] everybody's praying everybody's praying
[11:17] out loud there's voices remember like I
[11:19] remember I showed last time in Acts
[11:21] chapter 4 uh the Bible said they ought
[11:23] to lift their themselves up I'm sorry
[11:25] they lift up their their their voices in
[11:26] prayer in the prayer meeting and the
[11:28] Holy Ghost Shake took the building
[11:29] hallelujah amen they had to have a fiery
[11:32] prayer yeah they had to have a real
[11:34] sincere prayer like when I'm I'm not
[11:36] playing games God I want the Holy Ghost
[11:38] praise God you got to be sincere and so
[11:41] that's one example what it may sound
[11:44] like now um for time sake um if you got
[11:49] your Bible go to John 4:24 brother
[11:51] Daniel can you read that actually 23 and
[11:53] 24 Daniel uh John 4:23 and 24 I just got
[11:57] to hit the highlights because again uh I
[11:59] could I could preach hours and hours on
[12:01] there's so many verses about
[12:03] worship is that Albuquerque yes
[12:06] Albuquerque New Mexico yep it was
[12:10] uh March 12th I'm sorry April
[12:14] 12th April 12th
[12:16] 63 one of the Highlight sermons to
[12:20] me because you can hear the Holy Ghost
[12:22] fall brother R describes it it's a
[12:25] beautiful beautiful recording so brother
[12:27] Daniel when you're ready 23
[12:31] 24 but the hour cometh and now is when
[12:34] the true worshipers shall worship the
[12:36] father in the spirit and in TR for the
[12:38] father seeketh such to worship him God
[12:41] is a spirit and they that worship Him
[12:43] must worship him in the spirit and in
[12:46] truth amen praise God now look Jesus
[12:50] says God is looking for true worshippers
[12:53] yeah amen right you ever think about
[12:55] what what is God looking for he's not
[12:57] looking for more money right he's he's
[12:59] not looking for he's not looking for any
[13:01] anything carnal he's looking for someone
[13:04] that will worship him yes amen but
[13:06] there's two elements you got to meet you
[13:09] got to have the spirit of God and you've
[13:11] got to have truth yes amen I think God
[13:14] is looking and smiling down on this
[13:16] little church here tonight by God's
[13:17] grace I believe that Hallelujah I
[13:20] wouldn't be here if I didn't believe
[13:21] that Hallelujah I believe that Thank God
[13:24] now the word Worship in the Old
[13:26] Testament just means to bow down or pay
[13:28] h to and homage means respect or
[13:31] admiration in the New Testament it means
[13:34] like uh it means to kiss like Kiss the
[13:36] hand or profound reverence or uh
[13:39] expressing respect or again homage so
[13:43] it's the highest adoration or the
[13:46] highest honor you could give that's
[13:48] worship now that's why we don't kiss our
[13:50] cars like oh I got a brand new car I'm
[13:52] going to kiss it what we do is we pray
[13:53] over our
[13:54] cars right that's why we don't kiss the
[13:56] ground or we don't uh you know we don't
[13:59] kiss the Pope's hand like a lot of mega
[14:01] churches have done I got they got they
[14:03] put it on YouTube we don't do that
[14:05] because that's a worship that's worship
[14:07] amen amen but now you get the idea so
[14:11] God wants us in other words like
[14:12] spiritually the Bible says in Psalm
[14:14] chapter 2 kiss the son lest he be
[14:17] angry so in other words we have to have
[14:20] not physical kissing but spiritual
[14:23] expressions of our love to God in other
[14:26] words we have to have the most sincere
[14:29] uh the most uh honorable worship to
[14:32] Jesus Christ Hallelujah and that's
[14:35] worship ex profound reverence and
[14:38] profound respect and there's two
[14:41] elements okay so worshiping in the truth
[14:44] is easy it's worshiping according to the
[14:46] Bible commands from this message because
[14:49] this message points us back to the Bible
[14:51] amen amen so no women preachers Catholic
[14:54] Church is the mother Harlot right the
[14:56] baptism Holy Ghost is three steps right
[14:58] just sanctification baptism Holy Ghost
[15:00] water baptism name of Lord Jesus Christ
[15:02] God is one person all those great
[15:03] Revelations right that's just scratching
[15:05] the surface So you you're getting the
[15:08] truth but now the spirit the Bible says
[15:10] to walk in the spirit you've got to do
[15:12] the truth yeah okay so to get the Holy
[15:16] Ghost on us we got to confess our sins
[15:19] and we've got to obey the word of God
[15:21] that's what the Bible says walk in the
[15:22] light as he's in the light how do you do
[15:23] that you confess your sins John chapter
[15:25] I'm sorry 1 John chap 1:7 confess your
[15:28] sins and then you walk in the light and
[15:30] the blood of Jesus Christ forgives us
[15:33] and we walk in the light and we have
[15:35] Fellowship one with another amen okay so
[15:39] those if you want to be a true
[15:40] worshipper you got to have the spirit
[15:41] and that's by obeying the truth
[15:43] repenting of your sins and then you have
[15:45] the truth by obeying the Revelation
[15:48] God's given to us in this hour all right
[15:50] so that's why you know a church that has
[15:51] a woman preacher right they'll they they
[15:55] can have the spirit there they can they
[15:57] can confess their sins except for the
[15:58] woman
[15:59] preacher and probably some other ones
[16:01] too but as but we'll see it with balum I
[16:05] mean as long as they repent of some sins
[16:07] God will come down and he'll he'll
[16:09] anoint them yeah amen but then they're
[16:12] then then she'll get up and preach well
[16:13] now they don't have truth so they're not
[16:15] true worshippers it's a false worship
[16:18] now can God still save them yes brother
[16:20] tells us God has children in the
[16:21] Methodist the Baptist Catholic he said
[16:23] as long as they trust as long as they're
[16:25] trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ he
[16:26] said they're saved yeah
[16:29] right so we know that but look they're
[16:32] they're not true worshippers but tonight
[16:34] church we can be true worshippers
[16:36] hallelujah amen see we got just got to
[16:39] obey the truth confess our sins do what
[16:41] God says and then uh we've got to uh get
[16:45] the spirit on us and then we got to
[16:46] worship right we got the spirit the holy
[16:48] spirit's on us we're walking the truth
[16:50] and we got the truth hallelujah we're
[16:52] teaching the truth believing the truth
[16:54] it's that simple praise God Amen and
[16:56] then then now thinking back to Elisha
[16:59] then we start praising God tonight and
[17:01] then what can happen the hand of God can
[17:03] drop on anybody here tonight amen if
[17:06] you're sick we can call you up we could
[17:07] pray trust God to heal amen if you're
[17:10] confused uh we can pray and ask God to
[17:13] take away the confusion and somebody
[17:15] will God will give somebody a Word of
[17:16] Wisdom like mother maybe brother Aaron
[17:17] has the answer to your question he can
[17:19] come up and say well this is what the
[17:20] word says and you say oh praise God now
[17:22] I'm all the confusion is left now I know
[17:24] exactly what the Bible says hallelujah
[17:27] I've had that numerous times in our
[17:28] church my daughter one time was so
[17:29] confused and and we I prayed and prayed
[17:31] I screamed at the top of my lungs I pray
[17:33] and she still wasn't better so after the
[17:35] church brother AR we Clos the service uh
[17:38] some sisters three or four sisters in
[17:39] our church come up and talk to her she
[17:42] was battling whether I have the Holy
[17:43] Ghost or not and three or four older
[17:45] sisters said you know we're just like
[17:47] you're just like us you know you're
[17:48] raising the message and you're young and
[17:50] you're having these mind battles but
[17:51] look at look at these scriptures these
[17:52] scriptures and my daughter she started
[17:54] weeping my oldest daughter and she left
[17:56] out of there totally free amen it wasn't
[17:58] Daddy's prayers that time that did it I
[18:01] tried with all my heart but it was God
[18:04] giving those sisters and God had told
[18:06] the sisters before the service God told
[18:08] one of the sisters you need to do
[18:09] something today she's like what do I the
[18:10] whole service she's like what do I do
[18:11] what do I do she didn't know she just
[18:14] knew God's leading me to do something
[18:16] and I believe it was a word of knowledge
[18:18] because knowledge is understanding yeah
[18:20] because she brought understanding to my
[18:22] daughter now my daughter understood yes
[18:23] I am born again and she's lived it ever
[18:26] since too she even lived it before that
[18:29] but see it don't have to be you know it
[18:30] could be a tongue interpretation or
[18:32] prophecy but God is going to send what
[18:34] the people need amen amen
[18:38] hallelujah but see we got to sing right
[18:41] we got to obey the truth we got to get
[18:42] under the spirit obey the spirit teach
[18:44] the truth and then we got to start

[19:03] going to read we're not going to read
[19:04] all of them I have a list of uh let's
[19:06] see 11
[19:08] 12 12 13 14 15 different things about
[19:13] worship and they're straight from the
[19:14] Bible ways you can worship God all right
[19:18] and I'll tell you which ones the the
[19:19] saints were really blessed by last
[19:22] night uh the first one if you got your
[19:24] Bible Luke
[19:25] 19 uh the first one is pray raing or
[19:28] blessing god with a loud voice you can
[19:30] do that you're allowed to bless God with
[19:33] a loud voice you don't have to be quiet
[19:35] all the time in
[19:37] here right like you heard on that
[19:39] recording it sounded like a siren went
[19:42] off like a holy ghost
[19:47] siren think kind of sounds like a a fire
[19:50] department siren that sister you
[19:52] know right but it's letting the devil
[19:54] know you're getting washed out devil
[19:56] you're get your fire is getting put out
[19:57] devil right right Hallelujah prise God
[20:01] Amen that happens numerous happens
[20:03] numerous times in our church there's two
[20:05] or three sisters in our church that when
[20:06] the Holy Ghost Falls they scream and you
[20:08] think it would be bloody murder like if
[20:09] if you weren't like in the
[20:11] spirit but it's God ringing the bell
[20:14] Allelujah it's God alerting right
[20:16] alerting hell that their kingdom is
[20:18] coming down praise God amen amen amen
[20:21] now Luke 19:38 now here this is Jesus I
[20:25] believe it was Palm Sunday if I'm not
[20:27] mistaken
[20:29] and the the the people were crying out
[20:31] in verse 38 saying blessed be the king
[20:32] that cometh in the name of the Lord
[20:34] peace in heaven and glory in the highest
[20:35] and some of the Pharisees from among the
[20:37] multitude said Master rebuke thy
[20:39] disciples and he answered said to them I
[20:41] tell you that if thee should not I'm
[20:43] sorry if the should hold their peace the
[20:45] stones would immediately cry out now in
[20:49] other parallel passages uh the Pharisees
[20:52] are upset and said tell the children to
[20:54] stop crying tell them to stop
[20:57] shouting M and do Jesus walk over and
[20:59] said no you he he say well children
[21:01] you're a little out of order you should
[21:03] stop shouting for me you know you're too
[21:06] loud you you children need to quiet down
[21:07] is that what Jesus said no he said he
[21:10] said in other words he told the
[21:11] Pharisees said don't worry about it he
[21:13] said God's word is being fulfilled
[21:14] praise God this day the Zechariah
[21:17] scripture is fulfilled praise God Amen
[21:20] Hallelujah Jesus didn't tell him be
[21:22] quiet shut up don't don't shout so loud
[21:25] don't scream so loud Jesus said if they
[21:27] don't do it the rocks will cry out
[21:28] praise
[21:29] God Amen Hallelujah that's why we sing
[21:32] that that song Ain't No Rock going to
[21:34] cry in my place I love that
[21:37] song I'm not going to be quiet when I
[21:40] feel God leading me to be loud unless
[21:42] I'm trying to you know watch my voice I
[21:44] got to be careful see crying out and
[21:48] blessing God was part of fulfilling the
[21:50] word of God hallelujah now that's just
[21:53] one now the next one go to First Kings
[21:57] 8:54 First Kings
[22:01] 8:54 First Kings 8:54 this is Solomon
[22:04] right after the
[22:08] dedication and church I want you to know
[22:10] you're free to do these things during
[22:12] the praise and
[22:13] worship and then right
[22:16] after and really even during the sermon
[22:18] if the word of God is moving you you can
[22:21] shout praise God you can say bless the
[22:23] Lord amen how just however you feel led
[22:26] now none of us want to inter the sermon
[22:28] because the the Bible says the man of
[22:30] God he studies and prays he studies
[22:32] himself approved unto God in other words
[22:34] God approves his message in his prayer
[22:35] time in his study time and then he comes
[22:38] to the pulpit and really that's what
[22:39] that's God thus sayith the Lord right
[22:42] that's God thus sayith the word of God
[22:44] to us and we learn from that but if
[22:46] somebody needs a touch from God or or if
[22:49] if God is going to heal somebody maybe
[22:51] right during the sermon the Bible we
[22:52] read it last time remember in Acts
[22:54] chapter uh 10 the Bible said while Peter
[22:56] preached these words the Holy Ghost fell
[22:59] Hallelujah on them that heard the word
[23:01] praise God Amen I've only had that one
[23:03] time in my Ministry I was preaching and
[23:06] the people were so loud I just said okay
[23:08] I'm done you all can worship praise God
[23:11] and that's exactly what happened when
[23:12] Moses dedicated the Tabernacle thank you
[23:14] buddy and Solomon right the Holy Ghost
[23:17] fell and the priest couldn't even
[23:19] Minister amen hallelujah we almost had
[23:22] that last night it was such a wonderful
[23:23] time in the Lord hallelujah people are
[23:26] just shouting rejoicing standing claing
[23:28] in uh praising God worshiping it was
[23:31] just such a wonderful
[23:33] atmosphere I want you to notice here uh
[23:35] the ark is brought to the temple here in
[23:37] chapter
[23:40] 8 Solomon had just built the house I'm
[23:44] looking at brother Iran's book here in
[23:46] the the subtopics oh yeah and then he
[23:48] dedicates it in verse 22 now he gives us
[23:50] long prayer from verse
[23:53] 22 and
[23:55] notice verse 54 shows Solomon right
[23:59] after his prayer of
[24:01] dedication and it was so when Solomon
[24:03] had made an end of praying all this
[24:04] prayer and supplication before the Lord
[24:06] he arose from before the altar Lord from
[24:08] kneeling on his hand or his knees with
[24:10] his hands spread up to heaven so Solon
[24:12] prayed like
[24:14] this and was God mad at him no God was
[24:17] actually blessing him amen hallelujah so
[24:21] we got freedom to bless God
[24:24] loudly we got freedom to get on our
[24:26] knees and raise our hands to look up to
[24:28] heaven amen
[24:31] hallelujah and then in verse 55 he stood
[24:33] and blessed all the congregation with a
[24:35] loud voice see we got permission to use
[24:37] a loud voice hallelujah amen to bless
[24:40] God Amen right and then He blesses the
[24:43] Lord now that Lord capital L O R D it
[24:46] means Jehovah Jehovah means a
[24:48] self-existent one so Salomon would say
[24:50] Blessed Be Jehovah blessed be the
[24:53] self-existent one amen he doesn't need
[24:55] anyone to do anything he does whatever
[24:57] he once hallelujah amen he just filled
[25:00] this house hallelujah amen and Saints
[25:03] wouldn't you fall on your knees if God
[25:05] filled your house oh absolutely that's
[25:07] what really blessed the church last
[25:08] night I said it basically Solomon saw a
[25:11] miracle so if you saw a miracle wouldn't
[25:13] you fall on your knees and give God
[25:15] thanks for that amen
[25:17] hallelujah
[25:19] absolutely Solon just saw the Holy Ghost
[25:21] fall like a fire and it filled the
[25:24] Temple and so he said praise God I I'm
[25:26] going to dedicate this house to God
[25:28] that's all I can do what else can I do
[25:29] I'm a man he's God thank you Jesus and
[25:32] then He blesses god with a loud voice
[25:34] amen if you ever see a miracle it'll
[25:37] make you bless God with a loud voice
[25:39] hallelujah amen exactly right oh it's
[25:45] beautiful now we could go to many others
[25:48] uh 1 Timothy 2:8 Paul says I will
[25:51] therefore that men pray everywhere
[25:53] lifting up holy
[25:55] hands without wrath and doubting
[25:58] so notice he said everywhere he just
[26:00] didn't say
[26:02] Jerusalem right he just didn't say
[26:05] Jeffersonville he just didn't say uh
[26:07] Happy Valley I love brother Donnie
[26:11] that's why I said that but everywhere
[26:14] God wants you everywhere to lift up
[26:15] hands and pray and don't doubt God's
[26:18] word amen so I just want you to tell you
[26:21] that church like as soon as brother John
[26:23] starts the song service you know I just
[26:25] I just noticed God moved it on my heart
[26:26] and I just started raising my hands I'm
[26:28] praising God you have a right to do that
[26:31] yeah amen God wants you to do that yes
[26:34] because that what does this mean it
[26:35] means I
[26:36] Surrender and just like it was just like
[26:38] Solomon thanking God I bless you God oh
[26:41] Lord fill this place uh hear every
[26:43] prayer uh Lord when any when whenever
[26:46] anyone's in trouble may they look to
[26:47] this Holy Temple amen hallelujah and
[26:50] Jonah had to and Jonah experienced that
[26:52] he was in the belly of a whale but he
[26:54] believed Solomon's dedication so he
[26:56] looked back somehow in the the whale he
[26:58] figured out where Jerusalem was how did
[26:59] he do that it must have been God's
[27:01] Compass Hallelujah God's absolute
[27:04] Hallelujah he's in the belly of a whale
[27:06] with seaweed all over him he said I
[27:07] remember Solomon said if I just pray
[27:09] that Holy Holy Temple God will hear my
[27:11] prayer and God heard him on the third
[27:13] day he got vomited out and God gave him
[27:15] a second chance hallelujah amen how many
[27:17] how many believe God's a god of Second
[27:19] Chances don't be discouraged if you make
[27:22] a mistake don't be discouraged just
[27:23] remember now you're part of the club of
[27:25] Believers amen because all believers
[27:28] make mistakes amen and all believers
[27:30] even brother Jesse needs a second chance
[27:33] church we all run from the presence of
[27:35] the Lord at times brother brand admitted
[27:37] he did too there was numerous times he
[27:40] disobeyed the Lord remember down in
[27:41] South Africa he the angel told him to
[27:43] stay there in deran but he he left with
[27:45] the brothers wanted to do their
[27:47] denominational
[27:48] itinerary and he suffered for it right
[27:52] but that happens so he could learn but
[27:54] also so we can learn from that Amy amen
[27:57] don't take a denomination take thus
[27:59] sayth the
[28:00] Lord
[28:03] hallelujah now there's other ones uh
[28:05] Ezra 995 now this is a different this is
[28:08] a different whole different situation
[28:10] Ezra gets on his knees and lifts his
[28:12] hands
[28:14] again and he repents because he gets
[28:17] back to Jerusalem in Ezra's time and all
[28:19] and most of the Israelites had inter
[28:21] married and married Heathen
[28:23] women so he falls down for a different
[28:25] reason Solomon fell down at seeing a
[28:28] miracle but Ezra falls down and raises
[28:30] hands on seeing sin in the
[28:34] church so see God God wants you just to
[28:37] move be moved by the holy spirit amen
[28:40] sometimes you might pray with your hands
[28:41] up like sometimes you might pray like
[28:43] Ezra like oh God I'm in despair how
[28:45] could this happen how could this God
[28:47] forgive our church amen that's real yeah
[28:51] amen these are all expressions of
[28:53] worship and the best part is with Ezra
[28:56] and Salon they both went to God and God
[28:58] heard both their prayers amen right amen
[29:01] hallelujah so right after I got married

[51:25] preached the revelation of the future
[51:28] home he said I I I fed on that
[51:31] experience for two weeks he
[51:34] said now he used at least eight details
[51:37] from Clarence Larin but the one detail
[51:39] he said he got from God if you listen
[51:41] carefully was that the Earth is renewed
[51:43] in three stages he says what is that
[51:46] water Noah the blood of Jesus Christ
[51:48] shed on the earth and then
[51:51] fire and I looked I have Lin's book Lin
[51:54] didn't teach this three steps of three
[51:57] stages of justification sanctification
[51:59] baptism holy ghost that was a revelation
[52:01] from God so all these accusers are
[52:04] misunderstanding but said I got this
[52:06] message from God it wasn't lens's
[52:07] details that was from God it was the
[52:09] earth goes through three steps to be
[52:12] perfected just like you and I go through
[52:14] three steps to be perfected we're
[52:16] Justified we're baptized then we're

[52:32] the accuser of the Brethren that's what
[52:33] they're going to do they're going to
[52:34] find little things to accuse that means
[52:36] they never understood the message to
[52:37] begin with amen amen if you can walk
[52:40] away from these Revelations you never
[52:42] had to begin with brother Aaron because
[52:44] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[52:47] this Revelation Hallelujah and the gates
[52:50] of hell are taking them down into sinful
[52:53] lives and cursing brother brandom how
[52:56] could you curse another child of God
[52:58] yeah

[1:07:20] said oh what a nice spiritual lift now
[1:07:21] he gets right to the word of God though
[1:07:24] right special's over now it's time for
[1:07:25] the word I think it's beautiful let's
[1:07:28] say praise the Lord can we praise the
[1:07:30] Lord so people can't tell me oh well
[1:07:32] know you can't sing a fast song like
[1:07:33] that and you can't scream during the
[1:07:35] song people can't tell me that because
[1:07:36] I've already heard brother R talk about
[1:07:39] it he said don't just get religion in
[1:07:41] your head get it all over you praise God
[1:07:44] Amen I just showed you in the Bible
[1:07:46] David danced with all of his might
[1:07:47] praise God all of his might all of his
[1:07:50] strength he danced for God Amen
[1:07:52] Hallelujah that the thing is people are
[1:07:55] usually uh there's a couple reasons they
[1:07:57] don't worship either they're are they
[1:07:59] they're already making love like Samson
[1:08:01] made love to
[1:08:02] Delila right so message people will give
[1:08:05] their strength to another lover an idol
[1:08:07] in their life yeah so they don't when
[1:08:09] they come to church they don't have any
[1:08:10] love to give for God because they've
[1:08:11] already given it to pornography or
[1:08:15] movies or lust whatever right amen or
[1:08:20] the other one is fear what are they
[1:08:21] going to think of me what are they it
[1:08:23] doesn't matter what they think of you
[1:08:25] like David said I wasn't dancing for you
[1:08:27] wife mall I was dancing for
[1:08:29] God hallelujah and that's what I had to
[1:08:32] overcome was was caring what other
[1:08:34] people think I mean I do respect people
[1:08:36] I I do care what they say but ultimately
[1:08:39] I'm here to give God praise amen and God
[1:08:41] Delights in My Worship praise God he
[1:08:44] told me let them dance let them praise
[1:08:47] the Lord in the dance hallelujah amen is
[1:08:50] that is this helpful to anybody tonight
[1:08:51] by God's grace absolutely so this is
[1:08:54] what I'm saying this is what I want this
[1:08:55] church to grow into because that's the
[1:08:58] word of God that's what the Bible
[1:09:00] says I couldn't find I was listening to
[1:09:02] a quote yesterday or listening to a
[1:09:03] sermon yesterday and brother Ram got up
[1:09:05] and they were singing a fast song I
[1:09:06] can't remember what what it was we sang
[1:09:08] it last night at church but I can't
[1:09:09] remember he said he said this is
[1:09:11] Pentecost he said they start laughing
[1:09:13] and stoping this is It's The Joy yeah
[1:09:16] sure it's the sincere worship you're
[1:09:18] worshiping in spirit and in truth amen
[1:09:21] and brother R will make it like this he
[1:09:22] said you got to shake off your
[1:09:24] starchiness where just you're still all
[1:09:25] the
[1:09:30] time yes brother he said shake off that
[1:09:34] starchiness and just enjoy God just love

[1:09:46] religion is dead he said go bu
[1:09:48] it that's what he
[1:09:52] said you got a dead Rel religion go

[1:12:58] you get a victory when you can be
[1:12:59] thankful for something you ought to
[1:13:00] shout for that right God doesn't want
[1:13:03] his people to have voice of losing right
[1:13:05] or the voice of
[1:13:07] failure that's not going to make you
[1:13:09] shout you got to have a voice of Triumph
[1:13:11] oh we this week God helped us God
[1:13:13] blessed us God brought us through

[1:13:20] hallelujah and he says clap your hands
[1:13:22] all you people while you're shouting
[1:13:25] with Triumph see that's why clapping is
[1:13:27] a sign of Triumph right we you know
[1:13:30] brother BR says he said all in his day
[1:13:33] he said the soldiers would clap and sing
[1:13:35] to encourage themselves before going out
[1:13:36] to
[1:13:37] battle right you can see I've seen a
[1:13:40] couple on YouTube they got this the
[1:13:41] American Soldier singing uh Days of
[1:13:43] Elijah these are the days it's got like
[1:13:46] 10 million views that's a pretty awesome
[1:13:47] video and they're getting themselves
[1:13:48] ready to go out to war preparing the
[1:13:51] word of the Lord L that's how they get
[1:13:55] themselves ready that's how they
[1:13:57] worship how much more should we do that
[1:13:59] too praise God Amen we're not fighting a
[1:14:01] natural enemy it's a spiritual enemy
[1:14:04] amen we need the victory praise God
[1:14:07] let's have a voice of Triumph not a
[1:14:09] voice of complaint yeah amen or voice we
[1:14:11] don't want a voice of failure or we
[1:14:13] don't want a voice of surrender to the
[1:14:15] enemy we want to overcome the
[1:14:17] enemy now in closing I got verses about
[1:14:20] God wants you to say Amen the Bible
[1:14:21] tells you to say Amen to the word of God
[1:14:24] uh another way to worship God is fasting
[1:14:27] meals or you can feast and invite people
[1:14:30] that can't afford to pay you back invite
[1:14:32] Jesus said invite them when you have a
[1:14:34] feast that's a way to worship God Amen
[1:14:38] receiving the word with gladness Acts
[1:14:40] chapter 2 in other words if you enjoy
[1:14:41] what was preached tonight you should
[1:14:42] leave out of here
[1:14:44] happy you should be glad that you came
[1:14:46] to the house of God Amen that's what act
[1:14:49] chapter 2 said they were they that
[1:14:50] received the word gladly were baptized
[1:14:52] yeah
[1:14:54] and they continued in the apostles
[1:14:55] Fellowship Doctrine and they gathered
[1:14:58] together for communion as well these are
[1:15:00] all expressions of worship that we
[1:15:02] should give to show God our love and
[1:15:07] dedication so in summer your bodies can
[1:15:09] dance or be still they can stand or

[1:16:02] any questions on anything I've said or
[1:16:05] anything uh you guys want to ask me
[1:16:07] scripturally about uh worship I know I
[1:16:09] couldn't get to everything but I just
[1:16:11] wanted you show you a broad view God
[1:16:14] loves all this worship he takes pleasure
[1:16:16] in
[1:16:18] it he takes pleasure he loves when
[1:16:21] people are joyful
[1:16:24] when they're thankful it's a sacrifice
[1:16:26] of
[1:16:27] praise when you dance you said I take
[1:16:29] joy in
[1:16:31] that Hallelujah any
[1:16:37] questions obiously Freedom takes a
[1:16:39] little bit of time yes yes I just as a
[1:16:44] testimony to that the first time I ever
[1:16:46] went anywhere and the way you sat there
[1:16:48] trying to explain how it was how the
[1:16:51] devil wants religious people that would
[1:16:53] have been wild in the church I came
[1:16:56] from I'm saying you just didn't talk you
[1:16:58] sat there and you were quiet it was
[1:17:00] irreverent to be anything but um but I
[1:17:05] realized in my heart the first time I
[1:17:07] went to the men's encounter out in
[1:17:10] Lebanon
[1:17:11] Missouri and they did praise and worship
[1:17:14] and I mean they did defin I mean you
[1:17:16] know Apostolic Pentecostal what do you
[1:17:20] call it and they're up there you know
[1:17:22] and just I mean anyway I realized that
[1:17:27] the I couldn't even I could not honestly
[1:17:29] lift my hands wow I'm saying there was
[1:17:32] like I realized that there's a thing
[1:17:36] like all of a sudden
[1:17:38] realizing I'm not sure how you see
[1:17:41] except it it just that was like would
[1:17:43] have been like lifting weights I
[1:17:44] couldn't do that yes yes and I realize
[1:17:47] that the Freer a person becomes the more
[1:17:49] freedom you have to express your your
[1:17:51] feelings because we our feelings were
[1:17:54] suppressed I mean that is just Absolut
[1:17:56] of the way it was and it is so hard to
[1:18:01] get over that but I can tell the longer
[1:18:06] the longer I stay away from where I came
[1:18:09] from the better it gets Hallelujah so
[1:18:13] let's thank the Lord for that praise God
[1:18:16] Amen I was the same way but mine was be
[1:18:20] mine was because of guilt of all my sins
[1:18:23] I was into bad movies bad magazines
[1:18:25] filthy magazines I was worshiping Sports
[1:18:28] worshiping Dirty music and so I couldn't
[1:18:30] even I couldn't even raise my hands but
[1:18:32] after I got saved I started looking
[1:18:33] around like is anybody else raising
[1:18:35] their
[1:18:37] hands and look where I'm at today praise
