[0:02] remember you backside every day there no
[0:05] way at all for you keep out of it but
[0:07] Paul had to die every day is that right
[0:09] he had to die every day repent every day
[0:11] and just constantly repenting all the
[0:14] time see and if Paul had to do that then
[0:16] I'm going to have you too aren't
[0:18] you greetings friends in the matchless
[0:21] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:23] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:25] viewer's question about can God save a
[0:28] backslider I believe the Bible answer is
[0:30] yes and so that's what this video will
[0:32] be about by the grace of God hi friends
[0:34] I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ
[0:36] Fellowship here in akronohio USA and I
[0:39] defend the original Gospel of the Lord
[0:40] Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul
[0:43] and then had to restore through Martin
[0:45] Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet
[0:47] William Marian brandham who lived from
[0:49] 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother Ram's
[0:52] Godly Christian character here's a
[0:55] screenshot of the viewer's question
[0:58] hello Pastor can God save a back slider
[1:00] I want to know something about this
[1:01] topic thank you so my answer is yes God
[1:05] says he will save a backslider or the
[1:08] word he uses is heal them if they bring
[1:11] forth fruits of repentance in returning
[1:14] to him this is a wonderful topic I don't
[1:16] think I've ever preached an actual
[1:18] sermon on backsliding so Lord willing
[1:19] I'll probably do that soon here uh by
[1:21] the grace of God this has been a
[1:23] wonderful study there are two Old
[1:25] Testament scriptures that literally say
[1:27] God will heal backsliding so let's look
[1:29] at those here here first is Jeremiah
[1:32] 3:22 it says return ye backsliding
[1:34] children and I will heal your
[1:36] backslidings behold we come unto thee
[1:38] for thou art the Lord Our God so there's
[1:41] one witness and Hosea 14:4 is the second
[1:45] witness it says I will heal their
[1:47] backsliding I will love them freely for
[1:49] mine anger is turned away from him so
[1:53] before getting into the full context of
[1:55] these scriptures let's define backslide
[1:58] in the Hebrew it means to turn away
[2:01] apostate now that's the Old Testament
[2:03] definition in the New Testament the word
[2:05] backslide is not used as far as I can
[2:08] tell throughout my studies another
[2:10] phrase the New Testament uses for
[2:11] backsliding is turning away or falling
[2:14] away or let away we see falling away
[2:17] which means turning away in Luke 88:13 2
[2:20] Thessalonians 2:3 and Hebrews 66 and
[2:23] then we see leway in 2 Peter
[2:26] 3:17 so I want to share two things here
[2:29] the first is that the Bible definition
[2:31] of backsliding is very very serious this
[2:34] means backsliding in the Bible are major
[2:36] sins when people turn away from
[2:38] worshiping God to worshiping Idols this
[2:41] is called of course spiritual
[2:43] fornication as seen in Revelation 17 the
[2:46] mother Harlot is committing fornication
[2:48] with all the nations how does a church
[2:51] commit fornication with a nation its
[2:53] spiritual fornication so anytime a
[2:55] person or in this case the Roman
[2:57] Catholic Church disobeys God and enjoys
[3:00] the pleasures of sin they're kiding
[3:02] they're committing spiritual fornication
[3:04] or backsliding from God now second thing
[3:06] about backsliding I want to say is that
[3:09] those who follow the message the
[3:11] bible-based message of God's Prophet
[3:12] William Brandon will know that brother
[3:13] random said we backslide every day so in
[3:17] the Bible backsliding is very serious
[3:19] and those are major sins in the Bible
[3:21] but brother Brandon makes a statement
[3:23] that we backslide every day and this
[3:24] must mean in our minds so we backslide
[3:27] in minor sins every day so again
[3:29] remember remember there's major and
[3:30] minor sins I did a video on that
[3:33] recently so I'll leave a link to that in
[3:34] the description so when the Bible talks
[3:36] about backsliding it's major idolatry
[3:39] major sins in this one quote from 1954
[3:42] brother Bram says we backslide every day
[3:43] he's speaking of minor sins what brother
[3:46] brand was talking about is that in our
[3:47] thoughts we backslide every day or we
[3:50] Harbor evil thoughts at least at one
[3:52] point it seems almost every day and this
[3:55] is scriptural because Paul said he had
[3:56] to Die daily in 1 Corinthians 15 and
[3:59] then he said all Christians should be
[4:00] renewed day by day in the spirit of
[4:03] their minds and have a daily transformed
[4:05] mind we get that thought from three
[4:07] verses Ephesians 4:23 2 Corinthians 4:16
[4:12] and Romans 12: 1 and 2 here's the quote
[4:15] from 1954 brother Ram says remember you
[4:18] backslide every day there's no way at
[4:20] all for you to keep out of it so he must
[4:23] be referring to the mind the human mind
[4:25] that needs daily renewed and then he
[4:27] cites 1 Corinthians 15 where Paul said
[4:29] he had to die every day and he said if
[4:31] Paul had to do that then I'm going to
[4:33] have to too aren't you let's listen to
[4:36] the quote I know where got on backside I
[4:39] I wish somebody was going to ask me that
[4:41] but on backside remember you backside
[4:44] every day there no way at all for you
[4:47] keep out of it all right but you
[4:48] backside to the people in the church but
[4:50] not before God see you backside on
[4:53] Christ but you don't on God because if
[4:55] you when you sin you're gone but uh you
[4:59] constantly falling Paul had to die every
[5:02] day is that right he had to die every
[5:04] day repent every day and just constantly
[5:06] repenting all the time see and if Paul
[5:09] had to do that then I'm going to have to
[5:11] too aren't you that's right so we but
[5:13] now if you've been um if you've been
[5:16] redeemed and you feel that the the blood
[5:18] of Jesus Christ cleansed you from sin
[5:20] then I I and you've lived a Christian
[5:23] Life I I wouldn't think it be necessary
[5:25] but if you want to all right it'll be
[5:28] fine we'll be glad to do it now with
[5:30] that differentiation between backsliding
[5:32] into major sins and then the different
[5:35] sin of backsliding just in our minds
[5:37] every day let's look at Old Testament
[5:39] verses on backsliding there are 16 of
[5:42] them I'm not going to go through all
[5:43] them as I study them I just tried to
[5:45] pull out the ones that I felt would help
[5:47] us gain the best understanding from the
[5:49] holy spirit so the first is Jeremiah 3
[5:51] it's verses 20- 25 verse 20 says surely
[5:55] as a wife treacherously departeth from
[5:56] her husband so have ye dealt
[5:58] treacherously with with me oh House of
[6:00] Israel sayith the Lord and down in verse
[6:02] 32 it says return ye backsliding
[6:04] children and I will heal your
[6:06] backslidings now verse 21 shows they
[6:09] were doing idolatry in the high places a
[6:12] voice was heard upon the high places and
[6:15] they have forgotten the Lord their God
[6:16] so they were going to worship idols and
[6:18] they had stopped worshiping God and
[6:21] crying out to God so here we learn in
[6:23] Jeremiah 3 backsliding is like a wife
[6:26] leaving her husband to go make love to
[6:28] another man and so we can apply this
[6:30] spiritually to the New Testament and we
[6:32] will discuss a few examples but when a
[6:35] Christian leaves the worship of God and
[6:38] loves the pleasures of sin they've
[6:40] backslidden I want to jump ahead now to
[6:42] Hosea 14 1-4 says oh Israel return unto
[6:45] the Lord thy God for thou has fallen by
[6:48] thine iniquity and I love this portion
[6:51] because it shows how to get healing
[6:53] verse two says take with you words and
[6:55] turn to the Lord and say unto him take
[6:57] away all iniquity and receive us
[6:59] graciously
[7:00] so we will render the calves of our lips
[7:03] so we have these key words here the
[7:06] first word is return which means come
[7:08] back to a certain location get back in
[7:11] Heavenly places so a backl person has
[7:14] left the joy of heavenly places they've
[7:15] gone out in the pleasures of sin they've
[7:17] got to return to there and then the
[7:19] Bible said turn and say so you must
[7:22] confess your sins with your mouth as the
[7:24] Bible says Romans 10:9 says if Thou
[7:26] shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord
[7:28] Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart
[7:30] that God hath raised him from the dead
[7:32] Thou shalt be saved so if we're going to
[7:34] return from backsliding we got to get
[7:36] back into Heavenly places turn to God
[7:38] use our words and say I have iniquity
[7:42] receive us graciously receive me
[7:44] graciously I need your grace and this is
[7:47] the sacrifice of our lips the Bible says
[7:49] the calves of our lips in Hosea 14:2
[7:52] notice it says take away all my iniquity
[7:55] forgive all my sins I'm sorry and I'm
[7:58] guilty for committing all those sins
[8:02] then a backslider must say receive me
[8:04] that connects to 2 Corinthians 6 where
[8:07] God said come out and be separate then
[8:09] I'll receive you so the backslider who's
[8:12] repenting has to leave their pleasures
[8:15] of sin totally separate from them and
[8:17] come back to God and God will receive
[8:19] you and then Hosea 14:3 says a sure
[8:22] shall not save us ashur was an Assyrian
[8:25] God of War so Israel was trusting in a
[8:28] false god to protect them but we know
[8:31] the government won't save us we don't
[8:33] put our trust in government or guns or
[8:36] weapons we put our trust in the Living
[8:38] God and neither will money save us our
[8:41] jobs our social status nothing can save
[8:45] us we have to put our trust in the Lord
[8:47] Jesus Christ and then Hosea 14:4 then I
[8:51] will heal their backsliding I will love
[8:53] them freely and remember Romans chapter
[8:55] 5 there's three times the Bible calls
[8:57] salvation a free gift
[8:59] it's Romans 5:15 Romans 5:116 Romans
[9:04] 5:18 so here we see salvation is a free
[9:07] gift and God says in the New Testament
[9:09] and the Old Testament that salvation is
[9:11] freely given Mercy is freely given if
[9:14] the person will show the fruits of
[9:16] repentance let's look at some more
[9:18] verses here uh Proverbs 14:14 the
[9:20] backslider in heart should be filled
[9:21] with his own ways so a backslider is not
[9:24] interested in the ways of God they're
[9:26] interested in the ways of
[9:28] sin here's a great one Jeremiah 2:19
[9:31] thine own wickedness shall correct thee
[9:33] and thy backsliding shall reprove thee
[9:35] so this shows the conscience of a
[9:37] backslider will eat at them and tell
[9:40] them their backslidden and this is all
[9:43] because they lost the fear of the Lord
[9:45] this is in Jeremiah 2:19 thou has
[9:47] forsaken the Lord thy God and that my
[9:49] fear is not in thee so this is how a
[9:52] person backslides they don't fear God
[9:54] anymore they think they'll just do
[9:55] whatever they want there'll be no
[9:57] repercussions to their decisions of
[9:59] course that's a lie Galatians 6 says be
[10:02] not deceived God is Not mocked whatever
[10:05] a man SWS that shall he reap here's
[10:08] another powerful scripture Jeremiah
[10:10] 36-8 Israel's backsliding caused God to
[10:14] divorce Israel verse 6 says Israel was
[10:18] backsliding and was gone up on every
[10:20] high mountain playing the Harlot in
[10:23] idolatry and then in verse eight I had
[10:26] put her away and given her a bill of
[10:28] divorce
[10:29] but then God shows his Mercy in Jeremiah
[10:32] 3:12 through1 14 he invites her to
[10:35] return thou backsliding Israel for I am
[10:37] merciful sayith the Lord I will not keep
[10:39] anger forever only acknowledge thine
[10:42] iniquity he said you have not obeyed my
[10:44] voice sayith the Lord turn oh
[10:46] backsliding children for I'm married
[10:48] unto
[10:49] you so again we see these requirements
[10:52] for a backslider in order to be received
[10:55] by God they have to return leave their
[10:57] sin return to the ways of God
[10:59] acknowledge their sin acknowledge they
[11:01] have not obeyed and begin obeying the
[11:04] voice of God Jeremiah 8: 4-7 gives us a
[11:08] look at Israel being called a Perpetual
[11:11] backslider this is because in verse 5
[11:13] they hold fast deceit they refuse to
[11:16] return so a Perpetual backslider refuses
[11:20] to return to God and then in verse 6 it
[11:23] says they run into sin like a horse
[11:25] rushes into the battle and the perpetual
[11:28] backslider
[11:29] repenteth not of his wickedness and they
[11:32] do not say what have I
[11:34] done Jeremiah 49: 4 and five shows how
[11:38] backsliders are trusting in riches and
[11:40] not God of course there could be some
[11:42] other sin but this is one example with
[11:44] Israel oh backsliding daughter that
[11:46] trusted in her riches God said because
[11:49] you trusted in riches I'm going to bring
[11:51] fear upon you in verse 5 backsliding is
[11:54] also connected to idolatry in Hosea
[11:57] 4:16-17 Israel slth back as a
[12:00] backsliding hepher Ephraim is joined to
[12:02] Idols let him alone brother random said
[12:06] that Solomon backslid because of Idols
[12:09] so we see that connection here in Hosea
[12:12] 4:16-17 Solomon probably started this
[12:14] process for Israel and then it just grew
[12:16] and grew and grew so let's listen to
[12:18] this quote from 1957 then Jesus came
[12:21] brother Bram said Solomon backslid and
[12:23] turn to Idols let's listen to the quote
[12:25] and if God would do that for a man who
[12:28] looked at a Earthly temple built by an
[12:30] Earthly man who later
[12:34] backslid and turned to Idol if God would
[12:38] honor that man because he believed in
[12:41] the prayer of Solomon how much more will
[12:45] he honor your prayer tonight who don't
[12:48] have to look to your symptom or anything
[12:50] around you but look at heaven where he
[12:53] sit in the presence of God with his own
[12:55] blood as an intercession for your sins
[13:00] as he
[13:01] intercedes and then a final scripture
[13:03] from the Old Testament Hosea 11:7 my
[13:05] people are bent to backsliding from me
[13:08] none at all would exalt him so here we
[13:10] see backsliders do not truly worship God
[13:12] now they might go to church but they're
[13:14] not really worshiping God their love and
[13:16] adoration is for an idol they're not
[13:19] worshiping in spirit and Truth as John
[13:21] 4:23 and 24
[13:23] States now briefly let's look at the New
[13:26] Testament now the New Testament doesn't
[13:27] say the word backsliding it uses the
[13:29] words falling away or let away and you
[13:32] might remember from 2022 I made a video
[13:34] about 13 metaphors for backsliding they
[13:37] are shipped wrecked Waring against God
[13:40] falling away or deserting or running
[13:42] away that's the one that relates to this
[13:43] video that would be the same meaning as
[13:46] backsliding because it's turning away or
[13:48] leaving God fourth offended or stumbled
[13:51] fifth is cutting off or cast forth sixth
[13:54] is Cast Away seven is returning back to
[13:57] Sodom eight is itching ears nine is
[14:00] hardening heart 10th is crucifying Jesus
[14:03] aresh 11 is trampling underfoot the Son
[14:05] of God 12 is entangled again and the
[14:09] 13th metaphor is uprooted or plucked up
[14:12] now the few I want to look at are second
[14:14] Peter 3:17 and 18 Peter said Beware lest
[14:18] ye also being led away with the heir of
[14:20] the wicked fall from your own
[14:23] steadfastness so here are these words
[14:25] LED away means falling away it's the
[14:27] same as backsliding now steadfastness is
[14:30] a firm condition a steadfastness of mind
[14:34] so here we see a backslide in the New
[14:35] Testament can backslide in their mind
[14:38] and they're no longer thinking on the
[14:39] things of God no longer trusting in God
[14:41] but they're LED away from thinking about
[14:43] God and thinking about evil things now a
[14:46] few examples of major backsliding I
[14:49] think would be 1 Corinthians 5 the man
[14:51] fornicating with his stepmother this man
[14:54] was so proud of his sin so deep in
[14:57] idolatry to fornication course it's
[14:59] spiritual idolatry with fornication that
[15:01] Paul said deliver him over to the devil
[15:04] for the destruction of his flesh that
[15:06] his Spirit might be saved now it seems
[15:09] like he got healed from this there's two
[15:11] portions in 2 Corinthians where it looks
[15:13] like maybe this man was forgiven some
[15:16] people think it's 2 Corinthians 2
[15:18] 1-11 but Paul doesn't mention this man
[15:21] specifically as far as I can tell but
[15:23] the main thing from this passage is the
[15:26] Believers are told to love and comfort
[15:28] the man man who's repented so he doesn't
[15:31] over sorrow or sorrow too much Paul said
[15:34] Satan could get advantage of him and
[15:36] make him swallowed up in sorrow he could
[15:38] get so embarrassed for his sins that he
[15:41] would think there's no hope for him to
[15:42] be restored but Paul said Comfort them
[15:45] show them love so that's one thing we
[15:47] got to remember with backsliders we have
[15:49] to show them love and encourage them to
[15:51] get back in Heavenly places and that God
[15:53] will heal them God will restore them in
[15:56] 2 Corinthians 7 8-10 Paul acknowledged
[15:58] that some people repented but again he
[16:01] doesn't necessarily identify the man
[16:03] fornicating from 1 Corinthians 5 the
[16:06] second example that I think might be a
[16:08] major backsliding is Peter and the
[16:10] disciples after Christ was crucified you
[16:13] know Peter denied Christ and then all
[16:16] the disciples were scattered from Jesus
[16:18] except John John went to the Cross
[16:20] everybody else was scattered Peter
[16:22] denied even knew Christ and he even went
[16:24] back to fishing but this type of
[16:26] backsliding happens before a person is
[16:28] born again again Peter did not get the
[16:30] Holy Ghost until acts 2:4 so Peter's
[16:33] backsliding here must be considered
[16:36] before he was born again so there are
[16:39] certain levels like the video on major
[16:40] minor sins there are certain sins a holy
[16:42] ghost filled Christian will not commit
[16:44] it seems the major sins can still be
[16:46] committed by people that are not born
[16:48] again here's a quote from Brother
[16:49] brandham the unveiling of God brother
[16:51] brandham says anything can be an idol
[16:53] people even Believers even Christians
[16:55] can make anything a god brother Bram
[16:58] said you can make a piano a God you can
[17:00] make anything a God and so we know that
[17:02] today people make money a God Jesus said
[17:04] you can't worship God in Mammon God in
[17:06] money either love one hate the other
[17:09] people today in the message sometimes
[17:11] make brother brandom a God that's the
[17:12] Jeffersonville tape worship movement the
[17:15] Press Play and disobey movement is what
[17:17] they do there's other quotes I don't
[17:19] have them right now but brother Ram says
[17:21] you can make your husband or your wife
[17:22] an idol he says you can make your car an
[17:24] idol in fact I did hear that quote
[17:27] recently brother Bram said he never
[17:28] stole anything other than stealing time
[17:31] from God brother said as a sinner he
[17:33] would go wash his car I think wash and
[17:35] wax his car rather than going to church
[17:37] and he said that was stealing from God
[17:39] so let's listen to both those quotes
[17:42] anything can be God the the word God you
[17:45] can make an idol of God you can make
[17:47] that piano of God you can make anything
[17:49] of God I trusted he has forgiven me or I
[17:55] as far as literally stealing anything as
[17:57] I know I never did in my life but I've
[18:00] so misused this time till I stole that
[18:03] way and i' and done many things that I
[18:05] shouldn't do and I'm grateful to God
[18:07] this morning that he has forgiven my
[18:10] sins I remember years ago and I got my
[18:12] first little te- model Ford I was a
[18:15] sinner about 19 and 26 and I would just
[18:19] shine that little thing all day Sunday
[18:21] to make it shine stay home didn't go to
[18:24] church and shine it now what if today I
[18:27] tried to find one piece of that car
[18:29] it's gone you couldn't do it it's
[18:31] finished I think I'll share one more
[18:33] quote from the Third Exodus brother Ram
[18:35] says because his soul was predestinated
[18:37] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[18:38] foundation of the world that Soul can
[18:40] never backslide so again brother Ram
[18:43] says we backslide in our minds every day
[18:44] but if we're born again truly Born Again
[18:46] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[18:48] soul can never backslide let's listen to
[18:50] the quote and remember this election is
[18:52] coming out is this not going to another
[18:55] Nation it's going to Glory
[18:59] where their names are wrote on the
[19:01] Lamb's Book of Life not under the
[19:03] natural little animal lamb that brought
[19:06] Israel out that they could backslide
[19:08] from there and go back but this can't
[19:10] this is under the blood of the Lamb of
[19:13] God that was slain before the foundation
[19:16] of the world and their names were put on
[19:18] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[19:20] foundation of the world and they're in
[19:22] their elected and when that light
[19:24] flashes over him like that them
[19:25] denominational walls drop away from him
[19:27] here time
[19:29] come out from among them said the holy
[19:31] spirit in these last days touch not
[19:33] their unclean things I'll be God to you

[19:40] closing friends hope this video was a
[19:42] blessing by the grace of God this is a
[19:43] topic I've never really study through
[19:45] all the way as far as I know so
[19:46] hopefully these scriptures and quotes
[19:48] were a blessing may God help us every
[19:50] day in our minds if we backslide if we
[19:52] turn and think evil thoughts we'll
[19:54] quickly repent of them and get our minds
[19:56] back on the things of God as Peter said
[19:58] to grow in grace and the knowledge of
[20:00] our Lord Jesus Christ not be led away
[20:03] from our steadfastness but keep our mind
[20:05] steadfastly on the things of God and
[20:08] friends from recent sermons I preached
[20:10] you know in other states and also in our
[20:12] home church I have seen backsliding
[20:14] people come back to God some of these
[20:16] people were actually literally sitting
[20:17] there in the church for months or years
[20:19] backsliding but God brought them back
[20:21] with weeping crying rejoicing praising
[20:25] God confessing sin just like we saw in
[20:27] these backsliding script so God still
[20:30] heals backsliders praise the Lord Jesus
[20:32] Christ that he's rich in Mercy so if you
[20:35] know anyone who may be backslid in or
[20:37] would be encouraged by this video I pray
[20:39] you share it with them as you're led by
[20:40] the Holy Spirit if you have any
[20:43] questions concerns or testimonies about
[20:44] this video please contact me God bless
[20:47] you and may Jesus Christ be the desire
[20:50] of your heart
