TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you Tabernacle here I told you we're going to change the name and this is not right for it to be Brandon Tabernacle that's just a man see we're going to change the name of it make it some other name we'll get on that after a while I wish it wasn't brandom Tabernacle I wish to just call the Tabernacle didn't even have my name attached to it my name taken off of it I don't think my name ought to be on that church it ought to be a brandom tabernacle it just be a church the church of the Lord Jesus Christ or something like that greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to share quotes from Brother brandham about the name of brandham Tabernacle and asked the question why isn't the name of brandham Tabernacle changed since brother random said it's wrong for it to be called brandom Tabernacle hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA for the past 18 years and I defend the true Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ as he revealed it and restored it to his late Prophet the true Prophet William brandham 1909 to 1965 and I also defend brother braham's Godly Christian character by the grace of God so the purpose of this video is again to share two quotes about how brother brandham wanted to change the name of brandham Tabernacle and then make two important points about these quotes and the origin of this video is I was recently preaching on the serpent seed brother Brandon preached in 1958 and at the end of the sermon I heard him say it was wrong for the brandham Tabernacle to be named after him I'd forgotten about this quote uh and it made me think of these two points I want to address in this video so this video is in defense of brother brandham defending brother brandom against the idolatry that he faced during his lifetime and also the current idolatry today by The Same Spirit coming out of brandom Tabernacle it's clear that brandom Tabernacle idolizes brother brandom because they say every word on brother bram's tapes was thus sayi the Lord and that's a lie that's idolatry here's the video again of leadership saying every word on tape is thus sayi the Lord he say that you have to realize that every Brother Joseph believes everything that brother brandom says is thus sayth the Lord amen amen I believe everything brand amen now I want to share two quotes that this video is based upon and I do want to say if there's any other quotes on this topic I would love to know them I searched for a little bit and I couldn't find any other quotes so please share any quotes with me related to this topic what's interesting too is these two quotes came from the same day it was September 28th 1958 brother Ram talked about changing the name of the brandom Tabernacle in both the morning morning service and the evening service the morning was the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's the title of the sermon and the evening was the serpent seed of course so the first point I want to make about these quotes is if brother brandham said it's not right for the church to be named brandham Tabernacle then why hasn't Bram Tabernacle changed their name if they believe every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord so again if every word is thus sayith the Lord then it's thus sayith the lord it's not right for the church to be named brandham Tabernacle and brother brand said we're going to change the name of this so why haven't the leaders at BAM Tabernacle changed the name of it since according to them supposedly it's thus sayith the Lord that it's not right and they're going to do it so let's listen to both quotes here we'll start with the evening service the quote from the serpent seed and then we'll play the quote from baptism of the holy spirit so here from the serpent seed brother Bram said I told you we're going to change the name of this it's not right for it to be brandham Tabernacle so again if that's thus sayith the Lord then it's not right currently that brandham Tabernacle has the name brandom brother BR told us why he said that's just a man see we're going to change the name of it make it some other name I want it to be a Church of the Living God I don't want it Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal let's listen to the quote you Tabernacle here I told you we're going to change the name of this is not right for it to be Brandon Tabernacle that's just a man see we're going to change the name of it make it some other name we'll get on that after a while I just want it to be a a Church of the Living God I don't want it Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal all those people I love with all my heart so friends one more thing I love about this quote is brother BR said that's just a man and I'll get to more on that in just a moment here's the quote from earlier that same morning brother R said I don't think my name should be on the church he said brother Seward and them just attached my name to it when they put it on the deed down there brother BR said I wished it was just called The Tabernacle and didn't even have my name attached to it so again why doesn't the current brand Tabernacle do the wishes of brother brandham why don't they do his wishes and remove the name brandom and just call it Tabernacle or the Tabernacle brother BR goes on to give a different set of names for the church he said it oughtn't to be brandom Tabernacle it should be just a church the church of the Lord Jesus Christ the Tabernacle Lord The Dwelling Place the House of Prayer brother Ram said I'm just a man my name don't deserve to be on this not no more than nothing and he said it shouldn't be there it should be a Community Church I wish it wasn't brandom Tabernacle I wish it just called The Tabernacle didn't even have my name attached to it I'm fixing to turn this church you all know when we bought it I bought it when I work for the Public Service Company and put this thing up here and it just call it that because that brother Seward attach my name to it when they put it on the deed down there just as soon as I can get clear of this thing that we're in now this church is going to be turned over to this a community and just given my name taken off of it I don't I don't think my name ought to be on that church it ought to be a brandom tabernacle it just be a church the church of the Lord Jesus Christ or something like that the Tabernacle of the Lord see The Dwelling Place House of Prayer or something other given some kind of a name let the congregation choose her name my name I'm I'm just a man my name don't deserve to be on this not more than nothing the reason I had to put my name on this because my name was on the deed said Billy Brown see and it shouldn't be there no sir it should be a Community Church this this should be to the the congregation here this church is Sovereign you ain't no Board of Trustees or deacons go tell you what to do this church and a whole vote tells you what to do so again if every word is thus sayi the Lord and brother Ram's name shouldn't be there why is it there today this just goes to show Friends that the tape Church movement is under an evil spirit they constantly contradict themselves they don't even really know what they believe if they really believed every word was thus sayith the Lord then they should change the name of their Church to just the Tabernacle or something like that they say they believe every word but their actions prove different as brother brandham said now brother brandham are we missing out on something these people claim to believe every word that you say to be true but they don't they don't believe it their own actions prove that they don't so friends that's the first point if every word is thus sayith the Lord then why don't they change the the name of brandom Tabernacle to just the Tabernacle it's not right it shouldn't be in brother Ram's name the second point is I believe that this set of quotes shows brother Ram's true Christian Godly character brother Bram was a humble man he was a genuine Holy Ghost filed Christian of course brother Bram knew there were people around him that exalted him too highly even as he said in 1961 I made a video about this I think last year brother Rand said the people who baptized in his name were Antichrist horrible disgraceful ungodly the devil's gutter pipe and that evil spirit was represented by yellow and black serpent so those are all the names brother Ram called the evil spirit that would baptize in his name or make him infallible or make him equal to Jesus Christ and because of that it forces me to say I'm leaving the ministry uh is because that there is something arose up amongst the people that's caused me to do it that is that I have been taken from my bracket of a minister or a brother and being called Jesus Christ and so uh called and that would brand me as an antichrist so uh uh saying that I was Christ Brethren that is a hor able disgraceful ungodly lie of the devil I am your brother now that would run any person from the field and I just couldn't stand it any longer to think that 31 years of ministry went down the devil's gutter pipe into the when I'm gone what will he say there he is that's exactly what it was all the influence that it had upon the people then you see where to be I be an Antichrist and I just couldn't stand it I thought I'd rather die a few nights ago to make it sure I had a a visitation from the Lord and I seen a precious one a baby a serpent which was yellow and black and telling me right along and the thing struck me on the leg brothers sisters haven't I tried to be a true servant of Christ before you I tried to be your brother I wherever it is it's a spirit on precious people many people has asked me that but it's it's a spirit and remember if you've ever believed me if you've ever believed me to be a servant of Christ remember that is an era it's falsely thus sayith the Lord it is is wrong have nothing to do with it I am your brother remember brother said it's Tommy rot to make him infallable let's listen to that quote that's what gets things scrupled up you see that they claiming here that some brethren up there that said that I sent them up there and they're preaching that men should leave their wives and hunt for their spiritual mate and that um that I am perfectly infallible that there's nothing and all some of the awest things you ever heard and the Ministerial Association got a hold of it and they're writing me a letter about it and um I sent them up there and it's causing a lot of confusion and some of them prophesying and saying that one man should leave this wife and go marry that one uh this church knows that we don't stand for No Such Tommy Rod as that we believe in the Bible we believe that when man takes a woman that's his wife and death only can separate him that's only so we see brother Ram's humility in the quotes he didn't want a man in it he didn't want a man or a man's name on the church that's the humility of a real Christian and I believe another quote shows how brother ran was aware people were looking at him too much it's from an absolute January 27th 63 in Phoenix Arizona brother brand said I'm nothing I'm your brother don't pay any attention to a messenger you watch the message don't watch the messenger God will take it away from you God will share his glory with nobody so this is a beautiful quote a very humble quote from brother brandham but brandham Tabernacle and other tape churches have done exactly the opposite they focus too much on the messenger and not the bible message that brother brandom brought and again friends this is one reason I think Perhaps Perhaps this is why God took brother brandom home in 1965 we don't know but brother brandom said if you don't watch the message more than the messenger God will take the messenger away from you let's listen to the quote I'm only telling you the truth friend don't let it pass by you I'm not claiming I'm nothing I'm your brother don't you pay attention to a messenger you watch the message don't watch the messenger God will take it away from you he'll share his glory as nobody right glory to God don't you watch the messenger watch the message also I do want to State friends I don't think it's a sin for a man's name to be connected to a building uh because John 10:23 says Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch so there's at least one witness there's probably others as well where a man's name was attached to a building for worship to the Lord God now what's interesting also is that there's not a lot of scriptures that call it Solomon's Temple or David's Tabernacle or Moses's Tabernacle like for example with Moses it's often called The Tabernacle in the wilderness and then moses' name will be connected later on in the scripture somewhere later so that's the second Point friends I think brother Brandon was being very humble I think I'll play the video also also from the seventh seal where brother B said forget anything about me put all this grace on Jesus Christ I'm not fit to live and brother B said I'm not saying that to be humble he said it's facts so let's listen to the quote May you always bear that in mind to be a gy in the crown of Jesus Christ Paul said to the church you are you are the jewels gems of his crown we want to be the gems of the crown of Jesus Christ we don't want never put a man in it you forget anything about me I am your brother a sinner saved by grace not fit to live that's exactly the truth I say that to be humble that's facts there's nothing in me not one sound thing at all but the grace of God has let my poor dimming eyes look beyond the curtain of p and see those things on and lastly before closing I just want to share three more quotes uh brother Ram said in God's provideed place of worship if you want to be at God's provided place of worship he said I wouldn't point you to Bram Tabernacle he said it's just the same as any other church he said there's only one place I can point you to for true worship that's Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote now friends I don't want to hurt feelings but I'm responsible for a message and that message has come out of this mess and if I asked you to come out where am I going to take you to that's right would I take you to the brandom to Tabernacle it's as much fault as any the rest of them amen but there's one place I can take you to where you're safe and protected from Death Hallelujah that's in Jesus Christ it's God's place of worship God that's the place I'm introducing to you tonight where God put his name where he promised he'd meet every person to come in there he'd worship with him and feast with him that's in Christ not in no church no Tabernacle but in Christ he is God's Tabernacle he is a place that God came into himself second quote is brother BR said the Tabernacle would lose its power now what's interesting is after brother Neville passed away different leadership took over and that's when this movement towards a tape Church really started and so that's personally what I believe I believe brother R was talking about the Tabernacle would lose its power after brother Neville passed away but anyways that's just my thought I'm not saying it's right let's listen to the quote don't forget this Tabernacle will lose its strength remember that this is a target where Satan's got every gun in Hell trained on he'll cause one person to do something is contrary to watch the other things he's doing that he's up to it that's his business the third and final quote is when brother brandom said you can sit in the brandom Tabernacle and not be quickened by the holy spirit in fact he said being able to believe the message is just being able to read but you've got to be quickened and have the baptism of the Holy Ghost now those might be one or two quotes so I'll just put them together here by God's grace when I edit let's listen to the quote or quotes don't just come this far say I believe the message you obey the message come into Christ you so I believe every word said brother Brandon that's good but that's just that's just being able to read take the message take it into your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in Christ be in you the sun has shined across you set in this Tabernacle you've listened to tape and yet the spirit has never Quicken you so you could follow the word of God that you women you man could obey every word that he's written in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God it seems this week the Lord was giving me more thoughts and quotes related to Bam Tabernacle the current leadership and how we've got to rightly divide the word of Truth and we can't go to the extreme of idolizing brother brandom of course real Christians don't want to idolize anything they just want to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ in spirit and in truth but it seems this week I had more thoughts related to this subject the extreme of the sin and heresy of worshiping every word on the tape so I thought it'd be good to revisit some of these quotes by God's grace as you probably know earlier this week I was asked about is Joseph Brenham a prophet so I'll put a link to the two videos I have about that in the description friends let's do what brother Bram said brother Bram said prove All Things by the Bible every Bible Doctrine must run from Genesis to Revelation and I love that church age Book quote from chapter 3 brother brandom said that we should go to people and say if you're not saying what Paul said you are false and so I've tried to do that you know with the Bram Tabernacle movement numerous times they haven't accepted my correction so that's why I'm sharing these things publicly in Christian love in brotherly kindness to help people it seems like every time I put one out it does help some people by the grace of God that's why I feel led of the Holy Spirit to do it but remember brother Ram said that the true prophet of God at the last days would give us the gospel as exactly as Jesus Christ gave it to Paul so I want to finish with that quote from the church age book it's a beautiful quote let's remember that True Believers today true Holy Ghost filled Believers the wise virgins of today that truly believe the message of the hour keep the gospel in its Purity just as Jesus Christ gave it to Paul and we know the Saints beond the curtain of time are resting on the fact that brother R pointed us to the genuine Gospel of St Paul as Jesus Christ gave it to him let's listen to the quote they looked those false Apostles in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said you are therefore false oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it is not you that really tries the Apostle and prophet and teacher it is the word that tries them one of these days there is going to come a prophet to the leodan Church age and you will know if he is the real one sent from God or not yes you will for if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iota if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
