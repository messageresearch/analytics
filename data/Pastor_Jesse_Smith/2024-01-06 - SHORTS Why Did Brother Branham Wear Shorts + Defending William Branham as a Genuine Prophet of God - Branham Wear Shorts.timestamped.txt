[0:03] I have no Holiness to present to him but
[0:05] I'm trusting in his oh his grace and I
[0:10] have it in my heart I've unmerited it
[0:12] nothing I could do to deserve it by by
[0:15] Grace he called me and invited me to
[0:18] come greetings friends in the mattress
[0:21] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:23] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:25] viewer's question what do I think about
[0:27] Brother brandom's picture of him wearing
[0:29] shorts
[0:30] so I appreciate the question by God's
[0:33] grace we want to give an answer for
[0:34] every Bible question we believe brother
[0:37] Brandon to be a Bible Prophet a genuine
[0:39] Bible Prophet Vindicated by the Holy
[0:41] Ghost and so this is a good question
[0:44] before getting into it my name is Jesse
[0:46] Smith I pastored bride of Christ
[0:47] Fellowship here in akan Ohio for the
[0:49] last 17 years and I defend the Bible
[0:52] revelations that Jesus Christ revealed
[0:54] to his Prophet brother William brandham
[0:57] and of course I also defend William
[0:58] branham's Christian Godly character so
[1:01] here's a picture apparently brother
[1:03] brandham wore shorts in
[1:05] 1951 in South
[1:08] Africa now I can't verify that this
[1:10] picture is legitimate or real but of
[1:13] course there's an online video of
[1:15] brother Ram's daughter sister Rebecca
[1:16] sharing this video apparently at a
[1:19] church in Tennessee in
[1:20] 1999 so in summary of course it's wrong
[1:23] to wear shorts so if this picture is
[1:27] legitimate which I don't know if it is
[1:29] or not it was either a moment of
[1:31] weakness for brother brandham willful
[1:33] sin or a moment of ignorance where he
[1:36] didn't have the Revelation yet that
[1:38] wearing shorts was a sin but friends
[1:41] even if the picture is real it doesn't
[1:42] change the fact that brother brandham
[1:44] was a genuine Vindicated prophet of the
[1:46] Lord and of course also like we all want
[1:49] to be he was a sinner Saved By The
[1:51] Amazing Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:55] he was saved and forgiven of every sin
[1:57] by the blood of Jesus Christ because he
[1:59] had faith in the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:02] so I want to make Five Points about this
[2:03] picture and this subject the first point
[2:06] is the Bible truth about shorts the
[2:09] Bible clearly teaches that revealing the
[2:10] thigh is nakedness in Isaiah 47: 1-3 of
[2:14] course I learned about this Truth by
[2:16] listening to brother brandham brother
[2:18] brandham preached against wearing shorts
[2:19] both women and men and then I used those
[2:22] thoughts from Brother Bram sermons to
[2:23] write my 2019 modesty book restoring
[2:26] Christian modesty God's perfect will for
[2:29] your outward appearance parents and it
[2:30] contains this Bible teaching that
[2:32] neither men nor women should expose the
[2:34] thigh because the thigh is
[2:36] nakedness so of course regarding shorts
[2:38] for men and women but in this case men
[2:40] I'm against men wearing shorts in public
[2:43] so that's the Bible teaching about
[2:45] shorts now what's interesting though is
[2:47] in 1953 it was the first time brother
[2:50] brandom condemned women wearing shorts
[2:52] so I can't find any quotes of brother
[2:53] Bram condemning shorts before 1953 so
[2:56] this just gives a little evidence that
[2:58] maybe he was ignorant on this this topic
[3:00] beforehand but I don't know this is from
[3:03] the resurrection of Lazarus November
[3:05] 22nd 1953 let's listen to the quote yes
[3:08] sir when you quit going to church and
[3:10] blow up calls a preacher told you it
[3:11] wasn't lady like to wear
[3:13] shorts you're on your road don't worry
[3:16] trouble's on its Road just keep on you
[3:19] bu out this Cas now the first time I can
[3:22] find a quote that brother Ram clearly
[3:24] condemned men wearing shorts was in
[3:27] 1964 so this possibly could give us some
[3:29] in ight into what brother Brown was
[3:30] thinking if this picture was indeed real
[3:33] from 1951 it was in questions and
[3:35] answers part two 1964 August 23rd
[3:39] evening brother brandom said if a man
[3:41] went half naked there would be no
[3:43] Scandal to it because a woman wouldn't
[3:45] be tempted by a man who had a shirt off
[3:47] or shorts on the man looks sloppy and
[3:50] sickly horrible let's listen to the
[3:52] quote now look a man there's not much to
[3:56] him when it comes to a body and he if he
[4:00] went half naked it would there wouldn't
[4:04] be no Scandal to it not holding for man
[4:07] but the you know that what kind of a
[4:09] woman would be tempted by a man with his
[4:11] shirt off and shorts on or whatever he
[4:13] had a big old Burly looking thing it
[4:16] looks sloppy and sickly I horrible see
[4:20] these men out Earth I think it' make a
[4:22] woman vomit to look at such a thing and
[4:25] she had but now you take a woman in
[4:28] putter like that
[4:30] that's a different
[4:32] Temple you
[4:34] understand so knowing this it seems
[4:37] maybe this was brother Ram's thought
[4:38] process maybe in 1951 we don't know but
[4:42] to me this seems the most logical
[4:44] explanation in 1951 brother random
[4:46] thought men are sloppy and sickly
[4:48] looking if they wear shorts so that's
[4:50] why maybe he thought it was fine in this
[4:52] moment to wear shorts but again I don't
[4:54] know and of course later on in
[4:57] 1965 Satan's Eden brother Bram condemned
[4:59] men wearing shorts and he said a man
[5:01] wearing shorts was men wearing women's
[5:03] clothes and of course that's why I don't
[5:05] wear shorts let's listen to the quote
[5:08] she took off the clothes that God
[5:09] dressed her in back in Eden for her
[5:12] journey through the this Wilderness she
[5:15] tuck them off she stripped herself down
[5:18] when God had her wrapped all over in
[5:19] skins she's begin to shave a little off
[5:22] each time now she's back to where she
[5:25] was at the beginning now she's got her
[5:27] adom to wearing her underneath
[5:30] clothes a man put on them little old
[5:32] looking shs and get out your I
[5:35] don't think there's much man doing amen
[5:37] he is the biggest I know of Amen
[5:40] see she's got her perverted Adam to act
[5:43] like she see wearing her underneath po
[5:46] she's seen what she could do out in her
[5:48] when she took off all her clothes but
[5:49] her underneath ones that's the shorts of
[5:52] course that's a woman's underneath
[5:53] clothes and here her Adam is wearing
[5:55] them
[5:57] now which according to God's original
[6:00] word is an
[6:02] Abomination for a woman to put on a
[6:04] garment pertains to a man and a man to
[6:06] put on a garment pertains to a
[6:08] woman from the original word think of it
[6:12] now he now wears her bangs also he Combs
[6:17] them down puts a curler in them some of
[6:20] the most sickly sights I've ever seen in
[6:22] my life is some of those kids out here
[6:24] today with their bangs combed down like
[6:26] this and colored bleached hair with some
[6:27] kind of a peroxide something and
[6:29] bleaching and rolling in curlers making
[6:31] Banks you big amen that's a
[6:34] horrible thing to say from a p pit but
[6:36] judgment begins at the house of God Amen
[6:38] you don't even know where you're a man
[6:40] or woman amen and I understand that our
[6:42] United States Army is coming out next in
[6:45] shars that's right see what the
[6:48] perversion is it's a woman's
[6:52] clothes where's R Beng the other day I
[6:54] was over Howard Johnson's not this one
[6:56] here but one on the road going up and I
[6:59] just said set back in the am here come a
[7:00] little boy along his mouth open and he
[7:02] had dark hair here and it combed it over
[7:04] this
[7:05] way the second point is the apparent
[7:08] purpose of the picture as a family joke
[7:12] so when I was researching for this video
[7:14] I went and found the YouTube video I
[7:15] mentioned earlier about Rebecca brandham
[7:18] sharing this picture apparently in 1999
[7:21] at a church in tenness so I'm going to
[7:24] play that clip here sister Rebecca said
[7:27] her dad wore it as a joke to the kids
[7:30] and some brethren talked him into doing
[7:32] it in South Africa at a national park in
[7:35] 1951 let's listen to the
[7:38] quote want you see this other side of
[7:41] them
[7:47] H can you
[7:58] imagine
[8:05] sorry um this was in South Africa at the
[8:09] K National Park and um it's when he was
[8:12] down there in 19 I believe it was
[8:15] 1951 and the brothers took him there and
[8:18] talked him into putting on one of these
[8:19] Safari suits and having his picture made
[8:22] to take bring home to us kids and when
[8:25] we saw this weekend saying that's not
[8:27] Daddy that's not Dad
[8:29] did you know the ston the floran shoes
[8:32] give it away that's
[8:38] bad yeah he like to CL for
[8:47] us and so of course friends you and I
[8:50] would likely agree it's never right to
[8:52] wear immodest cloth even as a joke but
[8:55] we don't know what brother brand was
[8:56] thinking in 1951 if this picture is
[8:58] legitimate but it seems from his
[8:59] previous quote that he thought men
[9:02] wearing shorts was just sloppy and
[9:04] sickly the third point is perhaps it was
[9:06] a moment of weakness if brother brandham
[9:09] did know better so Rebecca said her
[9:11] father was a clown at times if you
[9:13] listen to this whole video on YouTube
[9:15] Sister Rebecca will say that brother
[9:17] Brandon really liked to clown around
[9:18] with his friends and family he liked to
[9:20] do things that make people laugh this
[9:23] makes me think brother brand probably
[9:24] didn't realize the full significance of
[9:25] wearing shorts in
[9:27] 1951 and if this was was a moment of
[9:29] weakness for brother brandham let's
[9:31] remember all Christians including those
[9:33] people who' left the message if they are
[9:34] Christians do things they regret and of
[9:38] course there's some record of all of our
[9:40] wrongs somewhere whether digitally or on
[9:43] paper or in pictures but this is why the
[9:45] accusers of brother brandham always
[9:47] accusing brother brandham of wrongs and
[9:49] treating brother brandham in a way that
[9:51] they would not like to be treated
[9:52] because surely brother M's accusers
[9:54] wouldn't want people to dig up their
[9:56] past and then call them out publicly on
[9:58] YouTube yoube for it they're not
[10:00] following the Golden Rule they're not
[10:01] treating brother brandom how they' like
[10:03] to be treated friends we don't know if
[10:05] brother brandom repented of this act of
[10:06] wearing shorts or not if in fact he did
[10:09] wear shorts one thing I've always
[10:11] appreciated about brother brandham was
[10:12] his honesty so I would think if he did
[10:15] wear these shorts then he likely did
[10:17] have regrets because he publicly
[10:19] confessed lying to the IRS in front of
[10:22] numerous congregations and then he even
[10:24] publicly confessed that he would tell
[10:26] his children prideful jokes and say he
[10:28] was one of the three greatest men to
[10:30] come out of Indiana let's listen to the
[10:32] quote you're not supposed even to joke
[10:35] and cut up with one
[10:37] another God will make you give an
[10:39] account for Every Idle Word that you
[10:44] speak did you know that the Bible said
[10:47] that you'll have to give an account for
[10:49] Every Idle
[10:50] Word so what kind of people ought we to
[10:52] be people that's Frank
[10:56] Stern loving kind and never a bunch of
[11:00] nonsense always going along look you
[11:04] take a fellow that you start today I
[11:06] notice it on
[11:07] myself being of my own nature an
[11:10] Irishman I'm always a lot of wind about
[11:12] me anyhow to cut up and carry on and
[11:15] every ever so often even my wife say no
[11:20] bill I say that's right honey she said I
[11:24] tell the kids around there I'll say cut
[11:26] up with them or something say well now
[11:28] you know there was three great men come
[11:30] out of Kentucky who was that well uh uh
[11:34] Abraham Lincoln yeah Daniel Boon and
[11:37] your
[11:38] father something like that and she'll
[11:40] say now Bill there you go again now I
[11:43] have to go off in the closet somewhere
[11:45] and say Lord forgive me I didn't mean to
[11:47] say it do something to me make me quit
[11:50] that see and every day I if I do that
[11:53] now we talking on the word backslide
[11:55] this morning when you do that you're
[11:57] backslid yes sir you got to repent is
[12:01] that right sir I don't mean to say you
[12:03] went out in the world you did this and
[12:04] that but you done something you've got
[12:06] to repent and Die daily to live in Jesus
[12:10] Christ so every daily every day you've
[12:13] got to die every day to live in Christ
[12:15] Jesus let's keep in mind also that
[12:17] brother Ram said he daily repented of
[12:19] all of his sins so that's why I said
[12:21] earlier at the beginning even if brother
[12:23] R did wear shorts he was forgiven by the
[12:25] blood of Jesus Christ because he had
[12:27] faith in Jesus Christ his Lord here in
[12:30] 1954 questions answers part one brother
[12:32] Bram said Paul had to die every day he
[12:35] said and if Paul had to do that I'm
[12:36] going to have to do it too let's listen
[12:38] to the
[12:39] quote you backside on Christ but you
[12:42] don't on God because if you when you sin
[12:44] you're gone but uh you're constantly
[12:47] falling Paul had to die every day is
[12:49] that right he had to die every day
[12:51] repent every day and just constantly
[12:54] repenting all the time see and if Paul
[12:56] had to do that then I'm going to have to
[12:58] do you that's right so we but now if
[13:01] you've been um if you've been redeemed
[13:04] and you feel that the the blood of Jesus
[13:06] Christ cleans you from sin then I I and
[13:09] you've lived a Christian Life I I
[13:11] wouldn't think it be necessary but if
[13:13] you want to all right it'll be fine
[13:15] we'll be glad to do it now here's a
[13:19] quote law of Grace 1954 brother Ram says
[13:21] I made many mistakes still make them
[13:23] will always make them the Holy Spirit
[13:25] tells me that's wrong I Repent right
[13:27] there Lord forgive me me and then he
[13:29] just had to accept that Jesus forgave
[13:31] him because the devil would come around
[13:32] and say you sinned didn't you and he'd
[13:34] say no don't talk to me I have perfect
[13:37] faith in he who told me if I confess my
[13:40] wrongs he'd forgive me so brother Ram
[13:42] had perfect faith when the devil would
[13:44] try to accuse him of his past sins that
[13:45] he'd already confessed through the blood
[13:47] of Jesus Christ let's listen to the
[13:49] quote I made many mistakes still make
[13:52] them we always make them but when I make
[13:54] them the Holy Spirit tells me that's
[13:56] wrong then I Repent right there Lord
[13:57] forgive me didn't mean to do it you help
[14:00] me I I walk on the same thing go just no
[14:02] sooner than that goes through my lips if
[14:04] we confess our sins amen he's just to
[14:08] forgive them is that right amen
[14:12] hallelujah the devil say you know what I
[14:14] tell you you're supposed to go do a
[14:16] certain thing you didn't do it you sin
[14:18] it you I said I confess it well I tell
[14:20] you oh don't talk to me no I have
[14:23] perfect faith in who you told me if I
[14:25] confess my wrongs he'd forgive me amen
[14:27] so I confess it going away from me I
[14:30] don't care nothing about you anyhow so
[14:31] just keep moving on Amen walk boldly
[14:34] right on into it if death lays there
[14:36] that's all right move right on into it
[14:38] with a perfect faith that God has
[14:40] promised that he'd raise you up at the
[14:42] last
[14:43] days the next quote Hebrews chapter 7
[14:46] part 2 1957 brother Ram said I have no
[14:48] Holiness to present to him I love this
[14:51] quote but I'm trusting in his grace I've
[14:54] unmar it nothing I could do to deserve
[14:56] it but by Grace he called me and invited
[14:58] me to come brother Bram calls that the
[15:00] power of the Gospel the holy church
[15:03] moving on through the Forgiveness of
[15:05] Jesus Christ that's the atonement of the
[15:08] blood of Jesus Christ let's listen to
[15:09] the quote I have no Holiness to present
[15:12] to him but I'm trusting in his oh his
[15:16] grace amen and I have it in my heart
[15:19] I've unmerited it nothing I could do to
[15:22] deserve it by by Grace he called me and
[15:25] invited me to come and I Look to Him and
[15:28] He took the desire away from me I make
[15:31] thousands of mistakes e each month and
[15:34] each year Sur I do but when I see him
[15:36] wrong I said God I didn't mean to do
[15:37] that you know my heart I didn't mean to
[15:40] do that I was trapped into that I didn't
[15:42] mean to do it you forgive me Lord if I
[15:44] done wrong to my brother I said brother
[15:45] forgive me I didn't mean to do that
[15:48] certainly God knows my
[15:50] heart oh there you are there's the blood
[15:53] sacrifice there's the power of the
[15:55] Gospel that Holy Church moving on not
[15:58] because something you done it's
[16:00] something you had nothing to do
[16:02] with there's the
[16:04] atonement here's a fourth Point how long
[16:06] did Brother brandom wear them we don't
[16:08] know how long brother Brandon wore these
[16:09] shorts if he did in fact wear them maybe
[16:13] he only wore them for a few minutes
[16:15] according to his daughter he was just
[16:16] trying to make his kids laugh by wearing
[16:18] this safari costume I don't know how
[16:21] long he wore them nor do brother Ram's
[16:22] accusers know so it's unfair to condemn
[16:25] brother brandom for wearing shorts and
[16:27] trying to make brother Ram like a
[16:29] hypocrite the fifth and final point is
[16:31] that these accusers of brother brandham
[16:33] are again committing the presentism
[16:35] fallacy they're judging brother brandom
[16:37] by the current understanding we have
[16:39] about men and shorts well today men and
[16:42] shorts can be an attractive thing
[16:43] because a lot of men lift weights and
[16:46] the culture has celebrated women lusting
[16:49] after men or even men L lusting after
[16:51] men it's sad to say that but that's the
[16:53] awful state that the culture's in right
[16:55] now and friends we don't want to get
[16:57] into the Trap of the presentism fallacy
[17:00] and so we don't want to judge brother
[17:01] brandham unfairly we don't want to jump
[17:03] to conclusions like all these accusers
[17:05] of brother Bram due to their own shame
[17:07] and Folly brother ramam is not here to
[17:10] defend himself so we must not jump to
[17:12] false conclusions and make presumptions
[17:15] before finishing this video Let Me Again
[17:17] State the absolute proof that brother
[17:19] Brenham was a genuine prophet of God
[17:22] first there are six verses that declare
[17:24] this authorative phrase that Jesus must
[17:26] remain in Heaven until God has turned
[17:29] the hearts of the end time Believers
[17:31] back to the apostolic faith and these
[17:33] are the six scriptures that God used
[17:35] brother random to fulfill they are acts
[17:37] 320 and 21 Matthew 1711 and 12 Malachi
[17:42] 45 and 6 Revelation
[17:44] 107-11 Amos 37 and Luke 17:30 and again
[17:48] friends remember no accuser brother
[17:50] brandham has read my 2021 book and tried
[17:53] to refute the Bible truth in that book
[17:56] it's over 800 Pages proving brother
[17:58] random was a genuine prophet of God you
[18:00] know why they haven't because they're
[18:02] afraid of the truth and they're so
[18:04] disingenuous they won't research the
[18:05] other side of this subject that proves
[18:08] to me they're not serious researchers
[18:10] they're not honest researchers and
[18:12] they're very
[18:14] disingenuous the second reason brother
[18:15] brand revealed the 12 New Testament
[18:17] Mysteries there's only 12 doctrines
[18:19] called mysteries in the New Testament
[18:20] and brother brandom revealed all of them
[18:22] six of them he gave us thus sayith the
[18:24] Lord for the third point is brother R
[18:26] gave us eight other Pauline do with thus
[18:29] sayith the Lord the fourth point is that
[18:31] there are six fulfilled thus sayith the
[18:33] Lord prophecies from Brother brandham
[18:35] these people that say none of brother
[18:37] Ram's prophecies were foretold in
[18:39] advance they're foolish they're ignorant
[18:41] they don't know what they're talking
[18:42] about shame on them I have a video that
[18:45] shows six undeniable prophecies thus
[18:49] sayith the Lord that have come to pass
[18:51] the fifth point is there's 14 Pauline
[18:54] doctrines that brother brandham restored
[18:56] to the bride of Christ the New Testament
[18:58] Holy Ghost filled church every other
[19:00] church denomination every other Church
[19:02] Gathering is guilty of breaking one or
[19:04] all 14 of these this proves the true
[19:07] Holy Ghost filled Believers that follow
[19:09] brother Ram's message are the Bride of
[19:11] Jesus Christ because they keep all of
[19:13] Paul's gospel and Paul said we'd be
[19:15] judged by his gospel in Romans
[19:17] 2:16 and then Paul said if anyone adds
[19:20] or takes away their curse in Galatians 1
[19:23] 6-2 again proving brother R was a
[19:25] genuine prophet of God because He
[19:26] restored the truth from Paul's gospel
[19:29] that churches had failed to preach and
[19:31] He restored it to the true bride of
[19:33] Christ today and sixth and finally
[19:36] brother Ram had many Supernatural
[19:38] Miracles healings and discernments
[19:41] undeniable as these soldiers and
[19:43] Warriors of the faith who had these
[19:45] experiences die off we're going to have
[19:46] to do a better job and I mean we as
[19:48] message Believers of reminding the
[19:50] people of all these testimonies our
[19:53] family right now is reading the
[19:54] generations book there's 38 individuals
[19:56] who give testimonies in there and each
[19:57] one had thus sayith the Lord's from
[19:59] Brother brandham dreams and Visions
[20:01] discernments all from brother brandham
[20:03] and never one time did it fail and
[20:05] that's what I believe never one time did
[20:07] thus say the Lord fail coming from
[20:08] brother brandham did Brother Bram fail
[20:10] the brown bear Vision yes he told us
[20:12] that but on my video about the brown
[20:14] bear Vision there's 10 people some of
[20:16] them were prophets who failed Visions as
[20:19] well or disobeyed Visions they disobeyed
[20:21] thus say the Lord visions that God gave
[20:24] them so I'll put a link in the
[20:25] description to that video and also put a
[20:27] link to the video about the six
[20:29] fulfilled thus sayi the Lord
[20:31] prophecies in closing friends I hope
[20:34] this video was a blessing remember
[20:36] brother Ram's accusers will always point
[20:38] us away from the Bible revelations that
[20:40] God gave to brother brandham and they'll
[20:42] nitpick brother bram's life they'll
[20:44] strain at a knat and swallow camel but
[20:46] what I mentioned here at the end this is
[20:48] what the accusers want us to forget
[20:50] about or try to distract us from all
[20:52] these absolute undeniable proofs that
[20:54] brother brandham was a genuine prophet
[20:56] of God reminds us of how Paul told
[20:59] Timothy Paul was thankful that Timothy
[21:01] was not ashamed of Paul Christ prisoner
[21:04] and that's what we say today we're not
[21:05] ashamed of brother brandom he was
[21:06] Christ's prisoner of course he was a
[21:08] sinner saved by grace just like all of
[21:10] us but he was a mighty prophet of God
[21:13] that's undeniable and that's what both
[21:15] of my books have been all about brother
[21:17] bram's Ministry and restoring the
[21:19] modesty standards and brother bram's
[21:20] Ministry finishing the mysteries of God
[21:22] Revelation 10:7 Amos
[21:25] 3:7 if you have any questions concerns
[21:28] or testimonies about this video please
[21:29] contact
[21:31] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[21:34] the desire of your
