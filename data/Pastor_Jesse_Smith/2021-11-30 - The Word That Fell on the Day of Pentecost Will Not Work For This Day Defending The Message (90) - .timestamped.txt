[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:08] of the lord jesus christ
[0:11] what did brother branham mean in his
[0:13] 1965 quotes
[0:15] saying the word that fell on the day of
[0:17] pentecost will not work this day
[0:20] friends when taken in context the short
[0:23] and concise answer is that brother
[0:25] branham's statement simply means the
[0:27] verses of acts 2 verse 4 and joel 2 28
[0:32] are not rapture verses
[0:34] the bride of christ will need the
[0:35] anointing and revelation of the
[0:37] prophetic rapture verses
[0:39] which include 1 thessalonians 4 verses
[0:42] 13 through
[0:43] and first corinthians 15 verses 51-54
[0:48] in order to be raptured
[0:50] of course though before she's raptured
[0:52] she will need the infilling of the
[0:54] baptism of the holy ghost in her soul
[0:58] the accusation
[1:00] brother brahms accusers those who have
[1:03] left his bible-based message
[1:05] have grossly misinterpreted this quote
[1:08] and claim it means william branham
[1:09] taught the crucifixion of jesus christ
[1:12] does not work for today
[1:15] nor does the filling of the holy ghost
[1:16] work for today
[1:18] and brother brahms followers must trust
[1:20] in him as a hierarchical priest to
[1:22] intercede between
[1:24] them and god
[1:26] here's the quote from one of brother
[1:28] graham's accusers
[1:29] and i quote
[1:31] doesn't that minimize christ's suffering
[1:33] on the cross to become that perfect
[1:35] sacrifice for us
[1:37] the thing that's always bothered me
[1:38] about that in terms of the message is
[1:41] so now we take christ and say his
[1:43] sacrifice to usher in a new relationship
[1:46] based on grace with god
[1:48] based on the holy spirit based on the
[1:50] leadership of the holy spirit it
[1:52] absolutely is minimized
[1:54] particularly when william branham says
[1:56] that the spirit of pentecost did not
[1:58] work for the day today
[2:00] then if that's true then the crucifixion
[2:02] of christ didn't work for today right
[2:05] end quote
[2:07] obviously brother rams accusers have
[2:09] greatly misunderstood this quote
[2:12] the truth from the quotes and their
[2:14] contexts
[2:16] let's listen to both quotes regarding
[2:17] the word that fell at pentecost and note
[2:20] their context brother branham was not
[2:23] doing away with the crucifixion or the
[2:25] day of pentecost the baptism of the holy
[2:27] ghost
[2:35] no sir experienced was for pentecost
[2:36] this is for the bride going home to the
[2:38] right we got something different
[2:40] the pentecostal represented that again
[2:42] we're in the bride age
[2:44] do more than the word of noah would work
[2:46] in the days of moses no more than moses
[2:49] the law would work in the time of paul
[2:50] here you're trying to tell me you're a
[2:52] dad to that
[2:54] and you cannot have that
[2:57] church you i'm speaking tonight across
[3:00] the nation
[3:01] if you separate yourself from
[3:02] denomination and all the filth and
[3:04] things of this world and all those
[3:06] things that keeps you in man-made creeds
[3:08] and orders and things like that you
[3:10] separate yourself
[3:12] look up
[3:14] get ready
[3:16] the fire is
[3:31] pride should be made more if immortally
[3:34] immortality be changed in a moment in a
[3:36] twinkling of god we which are alive and
[3:38] remain shall not forbid them which are
[3:40] asleep
[3:42] but you see what does that the message
[3:45] it went for then the englishman tried to
[3:47] hold that same message for today that
[3:50] won't work today
[3:52] it won't work how would what if moses
[3:54] would have come with noah's message
[3:56] we'll build a heart and float down the
[3:58] nile it wouldn't have worked
[4:00] and neither would jesus message ever
[4:02] work of moses
[4:04] and neither will wesley's message ever
[4:06] work in luther or luther's west message
[4:08] vice versa and today where our last
[4:11] great reformation was pentecost and
[4:13] today we're moving from that
[4:16] and a pentecostal message won't mix with
[4:18] this because it's another day
[4:21] it's all the word of god but it's
[4:22] building like the feet arms coming up
[4:24] it's farming a bride for the rapture
[4:27] they don't don't displace that people
[4:29] back there they live for their message
[4:31] all them will come out within the bride
[4:35] now that we've heard the context of
[4:36] these two quotes we can easily see how
[4:39] brother brown's accusers misunderstood
[4:41] brother branham brother branham was
[4:43] clearly referring to the rapture
[4:45] scriptures that need to be fulfilled
[4:48] will brother branham's accusers repent
[4:49] of their misunderstanding and slander
[4:51] brother branham it's likely they will
[4:53] not but we can pray for them in the holy
[4:56] name of jesus and ask god to help them
[4:59] to learn to repent and humble themselves
[5:01] and admit that they're wrong
[5:04] now let's hear some quotes from brother
[5:05] branham that say salvation is the same
[5:07] as it's always been by jesus's blood
[5:11] and the holy ghost experience today is
[5:13] the same as the day of pentecost and is
[5:15] needed to go in the rapture and that
[5:17] people can be saved outside of brother
[5:19] graham's ministry
[5:21] but of course anyone who would deny the
[5:23] baptism of the holy ghost cannot make
[5:25] the rapture according to jesus's
[5:27] teachings in matthew chapter 25
[5:29] regarding the parable of the wise and
[5:31] foolish virgins
[5:33] the same holy ghost that fell on the day
[5:35] of pentecost is the same holy ghost
[5:36] that's here now
[5:38] he's the satisfied potion because he is
[5:41] the word
[5:42] that's right the holy ghost wrote the
[5:44] word he interprets the word
[5:48] now i believe in good conduct
[5:50] if you are saved you will do righteously
[5:52] we have already gone over that
[5:55] but let me tell you now salvation is not
[5:57] jesus plus
[5:59] it is jesus alone
[6:01] salvation is of the lord
[6:03] from start to finish it is all god
[6:06] let his life be in me
[6:08] let it be his blood that cleanses me let
[6:11] it be his spirit that fills me
[6:13] let it be his word in my heart and mouth
[6:16] let it be his stripes that heal me let
[6:19] it be jesus and jesus alone
[6:21] not by works of righteousness which i
[6:23] have done no sir
[6:25] christ is my life amen
[6:30] what about the people that believe in
[6:32] the lord now and don't
[6:35] and
[6:36] not the way you preach they don't have
[6:38] to believe this
[6:39] they don't have to be the way i preach
[6:40] it see don't have to believe that for
[6:43] the last day message will they be saved
[6:46] yes if they believe the lord see and if
[6:50] they if they disagree and say i don't
[6:51] believe he's the word i don't believe it
[6:53] this is right i don't believe in the
[6:54] baptism the holy ghost that shows where
[6:56] they're headed for the tribulation
[6:57] period but those who can accept the word
[7:00] in its fullness not me preaching it
[7:02] because it's a bible says so
[7:04] those who accept that is free because
[7:07] the words already been judged
[7:11] so
[7:13] it's so thrilling
[7:29] always told the people when i crossed
[7:30] the line on the other side i like to
[7:33] stand up and sing amazing grace how
[7:35] sweet the sound the savior like me
[7:38] grace
[7:40] precious
[7:41] grace to know
[7:54] is what saves us by grace are you saved
[7:56] through faith
[7:59] another example of the need to take the
[8:01] full context
[8:03] one time years ago i was in a minister's
[8:05] meeting and one of the ministers shared
[8:07] a quote from brother branham
[8:09] and after reading a portion of the quote
[8:11] he went on for maybe 5 10 or 15 minutes
[8:14] about why he thought this quote was
[8:15] confusing
[8:17] i had not heard the quote before so i
[8:18] didn't know how to answer
[8:20] but when i went home i went and read the
[8:21] quote myself
[8:23] and found that if the brother had just
[8:24] kept reading the next sentences
[8:26] and the next paragraph
[8:28] his question would have been answered
[8:30] this is the same mistake brother iran's
[8:32] accusers made with a quote in question
[8:34] about the word that fell on the day of
[8:36] pentecost won't work for today
[8:39] had they just listened to the remainder
[8:41] of the quote kept reading kept listening
[8:43] they would have understood the context
[8:45] was about the rapture
[8:47] and not about salvation or the baptism
[8:49] of the holy ghost
[8:51] they would understand we still need the
[8:52] crucifixion of jesus christ that word
[8:55] still works for today for our salvation
[8:57] but we need more of jesus's word
[8:59] regarding the rapture in order for us to
[9:01] go in the rapture
[9:02] just like noah needed word for his day
[9:05] to be safe in the ark and moses needed
[9:07] the word for his day to bring the people
[9:09] out of egypt the quote that the minister
[9:11] wondered about was from things that are
[9:13] to be 1965
[9:15] first let's listen to the little snippet
[9:17] of the quote that the brother read but
[9:19] failed to read
[9:20] on you see well i prophesy
[9:24] ephesus
[9:25] so did balaam that has nothing i got the
[9:28] baptism in the holy spirit that still
[9:29] has nothing to do with it
[9:31] that's only a temporal gift for you
[9:35] so now that we've heard the quote the
[9:37] brother was asking the question how can
[9:39] you have the baptism of the holy spirit
[9:41] and it's just a temporal gift for you
[9:44] he was wondering if someone can fall
[9:45] away after having the baptism of the
[9:47] holy spirit
[9:49] well of course if he would just kept
[9:50] reading he would have known that brother
[9:52] branham was talking about the anointing
[9:54] the holy ghost in the human spirit and
[9:56] not the soul
[9:57] so in other words the baptism of the
[9:59] holy ghost in the soul is a permanent
[10:01] anointing not a temporal and it lasts
[10:04] until the day of our redemption
[10:05] according to ephesians 4 verse 30 and
[10:07] numerous scriptures about the seal of
[10:09] god
[10:10] now let's listen to the quote in this
[10:11] full context so you can see the brother
[10:14] would have gotten his answer if he just
[10:16] kept reading the quote and understood
[10:17] the context but then failed to read on
[10:20] or listen on
[10:22] you see well i probably saw
[10:24] episodes
[10:26] so did balaam that has nothing i got the
[10:28] baptism in the holy spirit that still
[10:30] has nothing to do with it that's it's
[10:32] only a temporal gift for you the real
[10:35] gift is your soul right there
[10:37] the man that was born of god and that
[10:40] controls the whole thing to the word of
[10:42] god and the will of god and there you
[10:44] grow up see then you are son and
[10:46] daughter of god you're a child of god
[10:50] friends as more and more accusers rise
[10:52] up against brother branham we must
[10:54] remember to take everything brother
[10:56] brahm said back to the bible and also
[10:58] when listening to brother branham listen
[10:59] to the full context of the quotation
[11:02] we know the holy ghost is with us and he
[11:04] will help us rightly divide the word of
[11:06] god and according to jesus he will guide
[11:08] us into all truth
[11:10] in closing i hope this short video has
[11:12] been a blessing it's been an exercise
[11:14] and rightly dividing the word of truth
[11:16] it's likely accusers of brother branham
[11:18] are only going to multiply so we're in
[11:20] need of more humility and also the
[11:22] anointing of the holy spirit to go back
[11:24] to the scripture search the scriptures
[11:26] daily and yield to the holy spirit as we
[11:28] learn to rightly divide the truth
[11:30] regarding all the brother brahms bible
[11:32] doctrines and statements
[11:34] and remember brother branham said the
[11:36] most important thing of today is a
[11:38] minister who can rightly divide the word
[11:40] of god so may the holy spirit help us to
[11:42] search for the truth
[11:44] here's the
[11:55] a good quote preacher
[11:58] i admire them
[11:59] and their gift is far beyond
[12:02] anything can be done in anything else is
[12:04] a preacher
[12:05] a man who knows how to rightly divide
[12:07] the word of god
[12:16] if you have any questions concerns or
[12:17] testimonies about this video please
[12:19] contact me
[12:22] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[12:24] the desire of your heart
