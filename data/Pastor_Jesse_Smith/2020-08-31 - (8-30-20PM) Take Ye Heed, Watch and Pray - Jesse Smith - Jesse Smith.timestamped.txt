[17:33] [Music]
[17:48] holy spirit
[18:01] [Music]
[18:11] for this morning
[18:15] [Music]
[18:22] [Music]
[18:26] grace
[18:29] [Music]
[18:37] let's go to mark 13 please
[18:43] mark 13 32 i like to look at a few
[18:46] videos i've seen lately uh
[18:48] they're really uh unique
[18:52] uh and it's kind of on the same lines as
[18:55] 2015 when there was
[18:56] a lot of signs that looked like the end
[18:59] of the world was coming in 2015.
[19:01] and i found the the powerpoints i'm
[19:03] going to share some of those things
[19:05] it was it was extremely convincing
[19:08] but i want to look at uh take heed watch
[19:11] and pray it'll be my title the sub topic
[19:13] is
[19:13] is 2020 the year of the rapture
[19:16] so why you turn into matthew 13 let me
[19:19] turn there
[19:20] uh 30. can we read 32 and 32 please
[19:24] thanks buddy while you're turning there
[19:26] brother vang i forgot he put a testimony
[19:27] up here
[19:28] thanks for all the prayers we're back to
[19:30] five days working
[19:32] starting this week he said thank god
[19:33] amen so thank the lord
[19:36] amen our precious brothers and sisters
[19:38] you know sometimes they get overworked
[19:39] or not enough working
[19:41] but our god is faithful our god he gives
[19:43] us everything
[19:44] praise god amen i'm a witness of that
[19:46] thank the lord
[19:48] it's rich in mercy praise god so let's
[19:51] read uh 32 and 33.
[19:56] and then we'll get uh right to the word
[19:57] of god at the end of this message i'm
[19:59] going to try to keep it short
[20:00] i said try i'd like to have maybe five
[20:04] to ten minutes of just prayer about
[20:06] what i'm going to preach on just the the
[20:08] visions and dreams people are having
[20:12] because jesus said you watch and then
[20:14] you
[20:16] we do a lot of watching as far as i mean
[20:20] like
[20:21] sometimes our watching goes overboard
[20:23] i'll say like that right
[20:25] like what man says we all need to pray
[20:26] more
[20:28] so i just want to take you know a few
[20:30] minutes at the end of the service maybe
[20:31] five ten minutes and let's just pray
[20:33] that god will give us discernment for
[20:35] 2020.
[20:36] i believe he has this whole time but
[20:38] specifically there's a couple videos and
[20:40] uh dreams people had in denominations
[20:42] i'd like to share them with you i think
[20:44] they're
[20:44] well johnny and i johnny shared it with
[20:47] me
[20:47] the reason i'm going over is because
[20:49] it's the closest dream i've ever heard
[20:51] to the rapture and how brother branham
[20:54] taught it with the squeeze and
[20:55] everything
[20:56] it is absolutely the closest thing to
[20:57] the message
[20:59] so that's why i want to go over it it's
[21:01] very similar to that 2015.
[21:03] it's just really close there's some
[21:04] really inspiring things there
[21:07] so let's uh read this here together
[21:09] let's read this out loud ready
[21:11] one two three but of that day and that
[21:14] hour knoweth no man no not the angels
[21:18] which are in heaven
[21:20] neither the son but the father take ye
[21:23] heed watch and pray for ye know not when
[21:27] the time is
[21:28] now if jesus said you don't know the
[21:30] time then let's be convinced we don't
[21:32] know the time
[21:33] amen we don't know the day or the hour
[21:35] now you know the scripture
[21:37] first thessalonians 5 says we'll know
[21:38] the season
[21:40] and i think we can all feel as time goes
[21:43] on we're
[21:44] it's just common sense we're closer to
[21:45] the season you can see the birth pains
[21:48] getting more intense so let's have a
[21:49] word of prayer
[21:51] heavenly father we love you we've lifted
[21:53] up these requests before you
[21:54] we love to worship you we've we've given
[21:57] our our
[21:58] our priestly worship our sacrifices and
[22:00] lord what a blessing it is to sacrifice
[22:02] our hands raised our voices might get a
[22:05] little sore but it's a
[22:07] blessing to to shout and sing and praise
[22:09] your name to give these sacrifices of
[22:11] praise
[22:12] from our hearts no one's forcing us to
[22:14] do it
[22:15] we're gladly offering these free will
[22:17] offerings we love you we bless you
[22:19] anoint me here god i've tried to
[22:20] consecrate my life lord god today
[22:22] not eating lord god and just eating on
[22:25] your word
[22:26] so anoint me i just yield myself as a
[22:28] servant of god
[22:29] i'm nothing without you i can do nothing
[22:31] none of us can
[22:32] so annoy all of us by the holy spirit in
[22:34] jesus christ's name
[22:36] the saint said amen amen god bless you
[22:38] being seated praise god
[22:49] okay so i'd like to show us a number of
[22:51] slides here just have a lot of pictures
[22:53] here
[22:54] kind of from 2015 and uh 2020.
[22:58] i still remember the night brother
[22:59] johnny shared the video with me
[23:01] and uh i remember i listened to it i was
[23:04] driving to get
[23:05] some food from my children i don't
[23:08] remember what night that was
[23:10] anyways it shook me up while i was
[23:11] listening to it
[23:13] because it was so close to what brother
[23:15] branham has taught let me set a timer
[23:17] here so i don't wear you out
[23:18] in myself
[23:24] so i remember that night and uh and i
[23:27] talked to brother johnny i'm like i need
[23:28] to pray about this
[23:29] uh so i went in the closet i think the
[23:31] next morning and just prayed about it
[23:33] and i just had peace kind of come over
[23:35] me i just felt like
[23:37] it's very scriptural but i just felt
[23:39] like uh
[23:41] i don't think the rapture is going to
[23:42] happen in 2020. now i could be wrong
[23:45] but i specifically went in the prayer
[23:47] closet to pray about it
[23:49] no i like what brother ram says he says
[23:51] jesus said no man knows the day of the
[23:52] hour but that doesn't mean you can't
[23:54] know the week the month or the year
[23:57] right i like that because that's true
[24:00] you won't know the day or the hour but
[24:01] you could we could know the weak
[24:03] and brother amon and i we've all talked
[24:05] about it if we saw
[24:06] the dead in christ rise
[24:10] our faith would be on a whole another
[24:11] level it would be
[24:13] rapturing faith right
[24:16] and then we would know okay it's coming
[24:19] soon
[24:20] right like it wouldn't be it wouldn't be
[24:23] any
[24:23] question about it and we would just be
[24:27] we'd be on cloud nine you know we would
[24:29] be heavenly places for sure instantly
[24:32] um now are we for sure is that thus
[24:34] saith the lord we're gonna see the dead
[24:36] in christ
[24:36] no as far as like i don't know how long
[24:38] we're gonna see him but if god did it at
[24:40] the first coming
[24:41] when jesus resurrected they saw the
[24:43] saints for 40 days
[24:45] uh then we would just think it would
[24:46] happen again
[24:48] and brother ram did teach you know just
[24:49] taught it he didn't say thus saith the
[24:51] lord he said we'll see him for a little
[24:52] over a month
[24:54] um so he thought that but we're the ones
[24:57] living in the day praise god we're the
[24:58] ones that got to have
[25:00] we got to be real solid amen not to let
[25:02] the devil push us off into fanaticism
[25:04] you know
[25:05] uh where we're falsely prophesying
[25:07] things and not go off into worldliness
[25:09] and forget about it but just stay right
[25:11] down the middle of the road
[25:12] amen stay right with that pure word
[25:13] remember those quotes say write the pure
[25:15] word if you got the pure word when that
[25:16] time comes we'll have the full power
[25:19] the fullness of pentecost thus saith the
[25:21] lord will be with the pure word bride
[25:24] that's not me that's brother brandon so
[25:26] um a great great topic and i don't think
[25:29] i'll be able to cover it all tonight
[25:30] because i
[25:31] uh honestly i just i only watch a video
[25:33] once or twice yesterday and today so i
[25:35] need to go back and watch
[25:37] i i'm saying i could spend more time on
[25:39] the videos just watching those
[25:41] uh but i do want to share because it's
[25:43] almost september
[25:44] and part of this uh prophecy is for
[25:46] september it's
[25:48] it's like a prophecy i just want to make
[25:50] sure i don't miss anything here
[25:52] okay yeah so um
[25:55] that's our that's our text here now
[25:57] let's review 2015.
[25:59] because 2015 shook me to my core i was
[26:02] so shook i called brother craig i said
[26:04] brother craig
[26:05] is this the rapture i thought if i know
[26:08] anybody that would be ready for the
[26:09] rapture
[26:10] i'm calling brother craig you know
[26:12] because he's just so like godly you know
[26:15] i just love brother craig you know he
[26:16] taught me the bible you know he
[26:18] basically taught me the bible and he
[26:20] said no brother jesse said i don't think
[26:21] so he said
[26:22] because it's not coming with us saith
[26:24] the lord and it's not through brother
[26:25] branham
[26:27] that taught me a good lesson um so
[26:30] but let me tell you why i was so shaken
[26:32] up i think you'll see
[26:34] so as you as you'll see this these
[26:37] authors had noticed a seven year cycle
[26:40] and it was pretty convincing uh and the
[26:43] next
[26:44] so there was a collapse in 2008 i think
[26:47] it was 2008 remember the financial
[26:48] collapse
[26:50] our home loss of value i mean some of
[26:52] you probably the same thing
[26:53] not like it matters but um but now look
[26:56] church
[26:57] you know this has come and gone and
[26:59] there was no collapse in fact when
[27:01] the day after trump got elected the
[27:03] stocks went way up you remember that
[27:05] he brags about that all the time we
[27:07] shouldn't brag
[27:09] i'm praying for him i know you are too
[27:11] and i thought about this the other day
[27:12] the holy spirit put something in my
[27:13] heart
[27:14] well i believe it was i believe god is
[27:17] honoring trump because of mike pence
[27:20] because he went on and he said i gave my
[27:22] heart to jesus christ at a young age and
[27:24] i've lived pure
[27:25] he won't even have a meeting with
[27:26] another woman one-on-one without his
[27:28] wife being there
[27:30] so that's that's billy graham level
[27:31] there justification
[27:34] and a certain level of sanctification
[27:37] and they allow bible studies i have
[27:38] articles they
[27:39] they were having bible studies at the
[27:40] beginning of their uh term
[27:42] so i believe god is honoring trump
[27:45] because of pence
[27:46] and remember trump somehow got convicted
[27:49] or convinced convicted to honor israel
[27:52] so god's going to bless him for that
[27:53] that doesn't mean he's saved i'm not
[27:54] saying he's saved
[27:55] does he sure don't act like it you know
[27:58] i
[27:58] but i'm praying you know i hope you're
[28:01] praying too and the bible says to pray
[28:02] for him praise god
[28:04] so if you're not praying for him shame
[28:05] on you i don't mean that as a rebuke but
[28:08] we need to pray for our leaders believe
[28:11] that
[28:12] so that has come and gone and but i'll
[28:15] show you that
[28:16] that cycle was hitting that seven year
[28:18] cycle was hitting pretty good
[28:20] but then didn't happen in 2016. it
[28:22] didn't happen
[28:23] uh remember it's okay to predict it's
[28:25] not sinful because brother branham is a
[28:27] pure example
[28:28] brother brahm said i believe it all
[28:29] happened before 77 he said total
[28:31] annihilation before 77.
[28:34] but then he said but it could be 50. it
[28:36] could be a hundred years
[28:38] now see it i think god allows that to
[28:40] throw off some of the
[28:41] make-believers that don't they don't
[28:44] listen to church they don't have enough
[28:45] humility to recognize the difference
[28:47] between a prediction and a prophecy
[28:50] okay don't even we predict things all
[28:52] the time oh i'm gonna have a great time
[28:53] at the
[28:54] next year i'm gonna have a great time
[28:55] next year how do you know it's gonna
[28:56] happen
[28:57] we're gonna have a great vacation we're
[28:59] gonna have a great service what if it's
[29:01] a bad service
[29:02] we predict things all the time and we
[29:03] don't even see people don't even know
[29:05] how to give grace
[29:07] i think they attack brother brown
[29:08] because they obviously don't like his
[29:09] word
[29:10] they don't like his bible-based message
[29:13] okay and then a lot of these guys
[29:15] that's my first emoji on a slideshow in
[29:16] a while
[29:18] they're trying to sell books which i
[29:21] i sell books but i still haven't made
[29:23] one cent of all the money i put in those
[29:25] books i still made one penny on it
[29:27] and that's okay i'm not after money i'm
[29:29] after souls
[29:31] praise god that's what i'm after now do
[29:32] i want to sell yeah i'd like to sell
[29:34] more but not for money's sake
[29:35] it would just go right back in the
[29:36] ministry you know i mean
[29:39] this week i sent out two or three books
[29:40] for free nobody nobody gave me any money
[29:42] i just
[29:43] each time i do that it's seven dollars
[29:45] because it's four dollars for shipping
[29:46] in the us and then it's
[29:47] three dollars to print that book from
[29:48] amazon so every time i'm giving away
[29:50] seven dollars every time a book goes out
[29:52] it's my pleasure to do it because i
[29:53] believe everybody deserves a chance to
[29:55] hear the gospel
[29:56] amen now uh so i preached this march
[30:00] of 2015 and then this all took place in
[30:03] sept i remember karen was there lawrence
[30:05] was there
[30:06] i was shaking in my shoes man at the
[30:08] beginning
[30:09] so this man wrote uh jonathan khan wrote
[30:12] harbingers now harbinger's like a
[30:13] warning right
[30:14] and so he wrote it in 2012 he sold two
[30:17] million uh there was nine
[30:19] this it's really interesting there was
[30:20] nine harbingers that parallel
[30:23] israel in the u.s now that's really
[30:24] inspired because brother branham said
[30:26] we are a lot like israel right you know
[30:28] the founders kicked out all the
[30:29] inhabitants i mean there's a lot of
[30:31] truth when this what this man is saying
[30:33] okay and then there's the nine okay
[30:37] and he found and they're all they're all
[30:39] legitimate
[30:40] all of these warnings have happened to
[30:42] the united states
[30:44] so he's got a lot of truth
[30:48] and this man in essence uh america
[30:51] repeats the defiant so this man i forget
[30:53] he's yeah senator
[30:54] he quoted a scripture he quoted isaiah 9
[30:57] 10
[30:58] and the scripture says we'll build and
[30:59] he's like this was right after 9 11
[31:01] right
[31:01] he said we're going to rebuild he didn't
[31:03] even you know he was quoting the
[31:04] scripture
[31:05] he didn't even realize that's a bad
[31:06] scripture that was after god was putting
[31:09] a judgment on israel
[31:10] and israel and pride said we're going to
[31:12] build greater and bigger
[31:14] and that's how spiritual spiritually
[31:16] blind they are
[31:18] and now look here we are nine years
[31:20] later
[31:22] man you can truly see what's happening
[31:24] right so my conclusion was
[31:26] but this is what i preached to you it's
[31:28] difficult to know which history source
[31:29] to believe
[31:30] yeah on all those different uh
[31:32] harbingers nine
[31:33] isaiah 9 10 in its context do seem to
[31:36] fit the u.s
[31:37] response to 911 the terrorist attacks
[31:39] and we already know
[31:40] that judgment is upon the usa thus saith
[31:43] the lord
[31:44] okay so his big thing was to try to warn
[31:46] america to try to wake up america
[31:48] and i'm sure you see that you know in
[31:50] the social media preachers are still
[31:52] they're still praying for a national
[31:54] revival and god bless their
[31:55] their hearts i mean if they're sincere
[31:58] i'm glad they have hope right
[32:00] but we know there's no hope and we're
[32:02] not trying to be negative or critical
[32:05] um our big problem is we can't let the
[32:08] fact that we know that we can't let that
[32:09] hinder our outreach
[32:12] in other words we need to do a better
[32:13] job of inviting people to church
[32:15] right or just praying for souls to be
[32:17] saved right can i get amen
[32:20] and that's the danger right of knowing
[32:23] that
[32:23] only judgment's left but let me share
[32:26] this
[32:27] i forgot about this earlier we read
[32:29] those revival quotes this morning either
[32:31] some i didn't read brother ram said
[32:33] every oh you sang about the city having
[32:35] a revival that is so true brother
[32:37] our city in 2001 had a revival
[32:41] liberty center our hometown right
[32:44] we had a revival we had what eight or
[32:46] ten or twelve people come out of there
[32:49] uh but there's a quote brother ma'am
[32:50] said from it's from chicago i forget 62
[32:52] or 63.
[32:54] brother max and boze now he disagreed
[32:55] with brother branham on some things
[32:57] but they had a revival and i i don't
[33:00] know how many people got saved let's
[33:01] let's just say 20
[33:02] 20 maybe 100. brother ram said see god
[33:05] has already shaken
[33:06] chicago and saved them i preached on
[33:07] that years ago i know karen was here i
[33:09] remember loris was here because laura's
[33:11] corrected me on the mats in mosaic
[33:12] which he was right i thought matt's in
[33:14] mosaic uh joseph matson jose was a true
[33:17] message follower he wasn't he just liked
[33:18] brother ramsey's healing ministry
[33:20] but brother man was telling brother
[33:22] joseph matson
[33:24] jose he said god is shaking chicago and
[33:27] only 20 or 100 people got saved
[33:31] so church i saw this god has started
[33:32] shaking akron
[33:34] uh 2001 in 2002 i got saved john graham
[33:38] lisa graham bang
[33:39] right carry a lady my wife god started
[33:43] shaking it
[33:44] amen now we're the only church preaching
[33:47] thus saith the lord
[33:48] of god's word for this hour
[33:51] say like that god can send revivals to
[33:54] cities praise god
[33:55] i believe it's a revival you might think
[33:57] i'm crazy because you know because
[33:59] there's 120 000 people in akron
[34:01] but even out of that oh church it's
[34:03] better than one in a million praise god
[34:05] we have better
[34:06] odds for a revival right one in a
[34:08] million right we know god like egypt
[34:11] two million came out two million only
[34:13] two made the promised land
[34:14] one out of a million made actually made
[34:16] it to the holy ghost
[34:17] right the baptism holy ghost in tight so
[34:20] we've had more than a good share of
[34:22] revival here praise god
[34:24] now we've got sisterhood amen look at
[34:25] that bye
[34:27] right here in akron and if our children
[34:29] get saved look at that each one of these
[34:32] look at the value of these souls praise
[34:33] god amen so see
[34:35] church we gotta take that into
[34:37] consideration so that's why we still
[34:38] pray for revival that's why i still pray
[34:40] for
[34:40] uh abortion centers to be cut down you
[34:42] know not cut down but
[34:44] closed i don't want to incite any
[34:46] violence that's what i'm saying
[34:47] yeah um because i know god can move
[34:50] praise god i know
[34:51] we know god can do great things amen
[34:54] so uh i didn't invest time into reading
[34:58] it
[34:58] his book i just hit the highlights
[35:00] online and i watched some videos
[35:02] and then he wrote a second book the
[35:03] shamita this was the seven year cycle
[35:07] okay so this came out in 2014 bestseller
[35:10] again
[35:11] now here's sir this shook me when i
[35:13] first saw i remember seeing this reason
[35:15] see every seven years there would be a
[35:17] financial crisis see that's why i was so
[35:19] shooken up
[35:20] because i know god works in sevens how
[35:23] many believe that
[35:25] well i remember that i lived through
[35:27] that
[35:29] i lived through that i guess i was born
[35:32] right here
[35:33] um but i don't remember all those well
[35:35] there was no crash
[35:37] there was no crash in 2015. right
[35:41] so is that is that interesting like you
[35:42] you know there's there's a pattern and
[35:44] then it stops
[35:46] that's why i was shook up because i saw
[35:48] it i saw the pattern
[35:50] and then there was oh yeah then there
[35:52] was a jubilee with it too
[35:54] i mean so 2015 2016 was another jubilee
[35:58] year another 50 cycle so i was like
[36:02] you know i know god works in numbers you
[36:04] know
[36:05] uh so i was really shaken up so the
[36:07] conclusions uh
[36:09] it's difficult to know the history some
[36:10] of his resources were from wikipedia you
[36:12] don't know how reliable those are
[36:15] i don't fully understand the seven year
[36:17] cycle
[36:18] i didn't know if it naturally applies to
[36:20] u.s
[36:22] because it remembers spoken to israel
[36:24] and i did witness the last two releases
[36:26] you know
[36:27] 2001 2008 and uh brother branham said
[36:31] israel in the u.s parallel many ways
[36:35] okay now here's where even more shook me
[36:38] up do you remember this does that
[36:39] remember
[36:40] september 2015. this is the september
[36:43] was the seventh jewish month
[36:46] and the jewish new year was in september
[36:50] and then the pope came remember that
[36:53] and uh barack obama said come on in your
[36:56] holiness he called him your holiness i
[36:57] thought oh
[36:58] mercy lord shows which side you're on
[37:03] and all of them did that all those
[37:05] republican democrat all of them said
[37:07] your holiness
[37:08] ah they're deceived deceived church by
[37:10] the world
[37:12] so the pope came and then the final
[37:14] blood moon was on the 28th which i saw
[37:17] that i would say you'd have to watch
[37:18] that
[37:21] so i i close it by saying if you feel
[37:23] crash is coming then pray
[37:24] and prepare but i didn't feel led that
[37:26] way
[37:27] if some people in that time were buying
[37:28] gold and silver and storing up food i
[37:31] just didn't feel led to do it there may
[37:32] be a time to do that
[37:33] i don't know i've never felt led to do
[37:35] that yet johnny and i talked about that
[37:37] i've never felt led yet but that doesn't
[37:39] mean we couldn't be led to do that
[37:41] right so i so after talking to brother
[37:45] craig
[37:46] i said i'm going to put more emphasis on
[37:47] thus saith the lord from brother branham
[37:48] then on these books
[37:51] but you know can you can everybody see
[37:52] how it would be okay for me to be shook
[37:54] up by that
[37:55] i mean all the sevens the fifties uh the
[37:58] pope
[37:58] oh and then the china president came in
[38:01] september or
[38:02] either late september or early october
[38:03] the president of china or
[38:05] it's not president what they call prime
[38:06] minister something like that
[38:09] he came that same time and i thought you
[38:11] got the bamboo
[38:12] curtain uh got the purple curtain
[38:15] ah goodness
[38:19] remember the blood moons here's the
[38:20] dates on the blood moons i mean
[38:22] i remember that one i remember seeing
[38:23] those we talked about it at school a
[38:24] little bit
[38:27] yeah all these blood moons 2014.
[38:31] i mean it was it was really it was
[38:32] really uh striking
[38:34] now here's what i found when i went and
[38:35] studied the scripture all the blood
[38:37] moons were related
[38:38] to judgment
[38:41] so god said i'll turn the moon to blood
[38:45] under the sixth seal well that's after
[38:47] the rapture
[38:48] right so either the either the blood
[38:50] moons were going to be
[38:52] not pertained to the rapture or the
[38:54] rapture was going to be before that
[38:55] september 28th
[38:58] that's why i was so shooked up because
[39:00] church you're not we don't want to miss
[39:02] anything
[39:03] we don't want to live in fear but at the
[39:05] same time we don't want to feel like
[39:06] we've missed out on something
[39:08] right
[39:12] and you might not be human but i'm human
[39:14] and sometimes
[39:15] you might not be human church no i know
[39:17] y'all but sometimes i get afraid
[39:20] like i was afraid of being a chronic
[39:22] virus because i didn't know much about
[39:23] it
[39:24] i tried to limit our 10 feet and i
[39:26] remember the first time karen and i
[39:27] tried to shook hands and we pulled it
[39:28] back you know
[39:29] you remember that just because i don't
[39:30] know i don't i don't want people to die
[39:32] you know
[39:33] right i mean who you don't
[39:37] um but then after 14 days then
[39:40] that turns to 28. and then that 50 a day
[39:43] i'm like i'm over it's a jubilee from
[39:45] this thing i'm done
[39:47] i'm done so
[39:50] we just learn to grow right we learn to
[39:52] grow with grace and knowledge of the
[39:53] lord
[39:55] so i i when you took it back to
[39:57] scripture and i this was like the last
[39:58] revelation i had was that
[40:00] blood moons are pertaining to the
[40:03] tribulation the sixth seal
[40:04] so i felt like i don't think this would
[40:06] be the time okay then i went through
[40:08] quotes
[40:08] there's two quotes about thus say the
[40:10] lord from brother branham he said don't
[40:12] evangelize to them
[40:13] because they're going to be saved in one
[40:14] day okay
[40:16] but i want you to know that i want you
[40:18] to see a little balance on this
[40:20] bear with me here i hope you understand
[40:21] this
[40:23] and i hope i made this clear i hope i
[40:24] made this clear
[40:27] god's bride has to be has to have
[40:29] representatives from
[40:30] every tribe kindred and tongue okay so
[40:33] in other words
[40:34] there has to be israelite people in the
[40:37] bride of jesus christ
[40:38] with the baptism of the holy ghost and i
[40:40] mean outside of the hundred forty four
[40:41] thousand
[40:43] now you might disagree with me on that
[40:44] that's okay but i believe
[40:47] there still has to be the man called it
[40:49] a bouquet bride and if you read
[40:51] revelation 7
[40:52] the bible says there are people in white
[40:53] robes with palms
[40:55] from every kindred nation tongue and
[40:57] people
[40:58] now that's the word of god so the reason
[41:01] i say that
[41:02] is because i know a message pastor who
[41:05] left the pastoring to be a missionary
[41:08] and his main emphasis now is on
[41:10] israel just introducing the message and
[41:12] he's seen people
[41:14] receive the message and there's a
[41:16] message church in israel now
[41:18] the church but but here we go thus saith
[41:21] the lord which
[41:22] i understand that now that that's true
[41:27] but there's also other scripture like
[41:29] where in other words the bride has to
[41:31] take
[41:31] the gospel to every nation right then so
[41:34] you have two truths
[41:36] there's truth we shouldn't thus say lord
[41:37] we shouldn't try to evangelize the whole
[41:39] nation
[41:40] but then we have another truth where we
[41:41] got to save some from every nation
[41:43] and every nation has to hear the word of
[41:45] god now that might stumble some people i
[41:47] hope not here
[41:48] maybe over the internet but i i hope
[41:51] everyone understands that by god's grace
[41:54] and then brother man said that says lord
[41:55] the jews that have their own church
[41:56] again in temple worship
[41:59] which we know we know they're going to
[42:00] have that they're going to rebuild it
[42:03] okay those are the quotes i'm not going
[42:04] to go with that because i preached that
[42:05] back in 2015.
[42:07] so my conclusion um he that the man who
[42:10] wrote those two books he had a
[42:11] connection to tbn and jim baker now jim
[42:13] baker
[42:14] i hate to say this but he is all about
[42:16] the survival packs
[42:18] they make millions of dollars on selling
[42:19] survival packs i mean what i'm talking
[42:21] about
[42:22] my dad used to watch him when before he
[42:23] got divorced and my dad said he's going
[42:26] to fall into sin
[42:27] and he fell into sin he had another wife
[42:30] and
[42:30] promiscuous and all these things my dad
[42:32] could spot i mean
[42:34] it's not hard if you got the holy spirit
[42:35] right you can spot a false preacher like
[42:37] that
[42:38] begging for money begging money money
[42:40] money money my dad called it out before
[42:42] my brother simon and simon and i we all
[42:44] saw it robert tilton
[42:45] benny hinn my dad he caught him all out
[42:49] so he had a connection and the
[42:51] best-selling books you know
[42:53] so that didn't that seemed didn't fit
[42:55] with me didn't seem to sit well with me
[42:57] now ron peterson who's a message pastor
[42:59] in arizona i've never met him
[43:01] but i listened to a sermon he did a good
[43:02] job he showed how
[43:04] um god did amazing things on feast days
[43:08] because you know the blood moons lined
[43:10] up with the feast days and israel's new
[43:12] year
[43:12] so i listen to that i'm like oh maybe
[43:14] this is the end you know
[43:17] now date setting it may only apply to
[43:21] the rapture since jesus said no man
[43:22] knows the day of the hour so in other
[43:24] words you could set dates
[43:25] for daniel 70 weeks you can do that
[43:28] because there's
[43:28] actually a certain number of days three
[43:30] and a half years or seven years
[43:31] you can actually know the dates for
[43:33] israel but will be gone by god's grace
[43:35] by god's grace and then voice of god i
[43:38] don't know what they put out but
[43:40] i don't uh and then i showed some
[43:43] future prophecies by the way i'm gay
[43:45] okay so let's look at this message here
[43:46] for today
[43:48] was that a good review do you ever
[43:49] remember that i was shocked i was like
[43:51] wow no wonder i was nervous you know
[43:53] because to me george i i just i look at
[43:56] things and i want to be right i don't
[43:57] want to miss anything
[43:58] and church god knows my heart i don't
[44:00] want you to miss anything
[44:02] because if you miss it and it's my fault
[44:03] then it's all me and i don't want to
[44:05] i don't want to stand on that day as a
[44:07] deceiver or someone who missed it
[44:08] i want to know because i know there's
[44:11] uh souls under my
[44:15] my voice and the last thing i want to do
[44:17] is get there and say you purposely
[44:18] i want to tell you saints everything
[44:20] that's why i tell you when brother man
[44:21] made a mistake i'll tell you
[44:23] if there's quotes you're not familiar
[44:24] with i'll tell you because i don't want
[44:26] you to be deceived
[44:27] i want you to know exactly what i
[44:29] believe the word says and what i want to
[44:30] point you right to the word of god
[44:32] i want you to know the truth because the
[44:33] truth will set you free
[44:39] okay so two videos have been shared bang
[44:42] shared one real good that's a good one
[44:43] brother bang i appreciate you sharing
[44:44] that with me
[44:45] there's a lot of truth in that one and
[44:46] then uh johnny shared this one with me
[44:48] so here's the two videos uh this one's
[44:51] got two million that's
[44:52] pretty popular this one's not so much
[44:54] popular but it's more recent
[44:56] but it's really really uh has some
[44:58] really good points
[44:59] so those are the two videos let's go
[45:02] through the first one now
[45:03] it's a it's what is it a 15-minute video
[45:05] yeah a 16-minute video
[45:08] okay now i'm gonna go through some
[45:09] details about the video
[45:11] so what you notice the he this man is
[45:13] assemblies of god pastor
[45:15] that's the denomination i came out of
[45:17] and that's the one that your uh
[45:19] ex-pastor's into right brother yep right
[45:22] so i was raised in his denomination i'll
[45:24] tell you one thing let me
[45:25] let's get ahead real quick um look how
[45:28] they dress
[45:29] now women and pants cutting hair just so
[45:32] you know
[45:33] this is not holiness
[45:37] right they haven't received the
[45:38] revelation of holiness yet
[45:40] okay and i'm not downing anybody i'm
[45:42] just saying like um
[45:44] if you've got if you're the bride you
[45:46] have all the word right and
[45:48] everybody can see first timothy 2 9
[45:50] women adorn themselves in
[45:53] modest apparel it does not say the word
[45:56] of god
[45:58] okay so um now a little bit on his
[46:00] background
[46:03] so this man reads 40 not i don't know if
[46:06] he's i don't know if he's exaggerating
[46:08] but he says he reads 40 newspapers a day
[46:10] now i don't even know how that's
[46:11] possible
[46:13] now one time i brother brother amen i
[46:15] have to apologize to you and your wife i
[46:16] think the last time i prayed for you i
[46:17] said
[46:18] i've had this happen millions of times
[46:20] that was a exaggeration
[46:22] so forgive me i forget what it was i i
[46:24] tell you i was going through something
[46:26] i said it's happened a million times i
[46:28] was exaggerating forgive me
[46:30] okay i don't know if he's exaggerating
[46:32] here that's a lot of newspapers to read
[46:35] 40 he said i read 40 every day that's
[46:38] the first little thing like
[46:41] are you reading the bible then there's
[46:43] only so many hours in the day
[46:46] right okay now
[46:49] he claims his dreams were from december
[46:51] 19 december 2019
[46:53] but this was not posted till june of
[46:55] this year
[46:56] so it was about seven months after the
[46:58] fact
[47:00] okay so his dreams foretold covet 19 in
[47:03] march and then
[47:05] the riots in june so in his dream
[47:08] he saw a calendar he saw march and he
[47:10] saw
[47:12] a hand underline a finger underline
[47:14] march and tap it three times
[47:16] and then they skipped ahead to june
[47:18] underlined june the handed and tapped it
[47:20] three times
[47:24] and then he saw how kovid came in march
[47:29] and then the riots after uh
[47:32] george was his last name what was it
[47:36] george ford thank you george floyd was
[47:38] killed by the police officer
[47:39] but now there's a report on that they
[47:40] don't know if the drugs killed him
[47:43] now of course it's awful to lay on
[47:44] somebody's neck right but that
[47:46] and just so you know that's that's
[47:47] actually a tactic they can use
[47:50] in the minnesota police they can to to
[47:53] get somebody unconscious they can lay on
[47:54] their neck
[47:55] like you can i saw it online it's on
[47:57] there it's in their handbook
[47:59] now church that's nothing that's nothing
[48:01] we would ever want to do right
[48:02] thank god we're not cops can you say
[48:04] amen to that thing thank god like
[48:06] we don't have to put our lives on the
[48:08] line every day get shot at and get
[48:10] punched and almost killed you know
[48:14] so i'm not defending one of the other
[48:16] i'm just saying there's more to the
[48:17] story than what a lot of people look at
[48:18] it
[48:19] okay you know i'm i'm not i'm not racist
[48:21] i love every color
[48:22] i love every creed god give me a church
[48:24] of almost every color
[48:26] not creed uh color a nation and tongue
[48:30] i love it praise god small but i love
[48:32] all the diversity praise god
[48:34] and i mix myself praise god like 30
[48:37] spanish and
[48:38] uh 30 great britain and i forget what
[48:40] the other is
[48:44] so yeah tapping the months okay
[48:48] and then um the cam the months kept
[48:51] flipping
[48:52] and then it came to september which
[48:54] we're on
[48:55] in a couple days on the finger
[48:58] underlined it and then tapped it three
[48:59] times
[49:00] and then it flipped ahead to november
[49:02] underlined it but then it
[49:04] punched it and it exploded the calendar
[49:06] exploded something like that
[49:09] okay and then after
[49:12] november exploded he saw vultures flying
[49:16] over cities
[49:18] now later i'll show it he said the the
[49:21] vultures turn into gargoyles which are
[49:23] like
[49:24] half ape
[49:27] dragon type of things they're like big
[49:29] huge apes but they got wings you know
[49:30] and they fly
[49:32] i don't know how to describe it they
[49:34] have them on all these catholic churches
[49:37] and that shows you what the spirits are
[49:39] made of amen
[49:41] they're full of unclean and hateful
[49:43] birds okay
[49:45] so it's like a ape slash bat
[49:48] massive bat okay so that speaks of
[49:51] tribulation
[49:51] right we all know that there are going
[49:53] to be creatures like scorpions with
[49:55] tails right
[49:57] creatures with you know wings like bats
[50:00] hair oh yeah that's right hair
[50:02] hanging down from their wings like hair
[50:03] of women so long uncut hair
[50:06] that's in the fifth trumpet i think if
[50:08] i'm not mistaken
[50:10] and then he kept hearing this brace
[50:11] yourself brace yourself
[50:13] brace yourself okay
[50:17] so that's uh that's like they're gonna
[50:20] hit something
[50:21] okay but to me i think jesus
[50:24] he's like the eagle and we sit under the
[50:26] shadow of his wings
[50:28] amen right so i feel like he'd protect
[50:31] us but then there are quotes or brother
[50:33] ram says
[50:33] we we may be physically bereft right
[50:36] that's a quote from the church age book
[50:37] in other words we may be physically
[50:39] deprived in the squeeze
[50:41] brother ram calls the bride a hunted
[50:43] persecuted group
[50:45] in the church book right so but none of
[50:49] those are thus saith the lord just so
[50:50] you know
[50:51] in church if anybody should know we need
[50:54] to be careful
[50:54] making things thus say the lord that
[50:56] aren't it should be us
[50:58] right because you got to because
[51:01] time passes and we find out okay i
[51:03] didn't know he said this i didn't know
[51:04] so we just have to let him be a man
[51:06] right let him have his own opinions
[51:08] but to be very careful what we make thus
[51:10] saith the lord
[51:16] oh yeah i'm sorry so that was the fir
[51:17] the first stream had march
[51:19] june the second dream had september
[51:21] november
[51:22] okay the fist hit the counter in
[51:24] november oh yeah and then afterwards he
[51:25] saw riots he said everywhere right it's
[51:27] all over the u.s
[51:28] schools were closed he said schools had
[51:31] uh spider webs in them
[51:34] now i don't know about your school but
[51:35] my school they keep it squeaky clean
[51:38] i mean they are they're on it especially
[51:41] with covid
[51:42] it's even better now it's even cleaner
[51:44] now
[51:45] it is i mean after we leave they are
[51:47] instantly in there spraying down
[51:48] everything
[51:49] they call it mist they miss the whole
[51:50] room they're like don't leave out paper
[51:53] because it'll make the paper wrinkle
[51:54] you know goodness um
[51:58] and then he said money he said there was
[51:59] like vacuums over the banks
[52:01] vacuuming up the money now that may be
[52:03] just you know parable right that may
[52:04] just be
[52:06] but he said a lot of money was being
[52:08] taken from banks
[52:10] and then he saw a washington dc burning
[52:12] and there was no trump or no president
[52:14] there it was just burning
[52:16] this is in november he said this was all
[52:19] november
[52:20] and then he said he saw chinese soldiers
[52:22] russian soldiers and united nations
[52:24] soldiers
[52:25] in washington dc and on american grounds
[52:28] i just so you know there's a quote
[52:29] brother ram says
[52:30] uh and amen and i were talking about
[52:33] this i saw my video future prophecies
[52:35] brother branham says uh he said we might
[52:37] have russian soldiers coming in and
[52:39] ravishing
[52:41] and destroying he said but the church
[52:43] will be gone before that he said thus
[52:44] saith the lord
[52:47] so we have thus saith the lord if
[52:48] there's going to be enemy soldiers
[52:50] but iran said thus saith the lord the
[52:52] church will be gone he said we won't see
[52:54] that he said it's
[52:54] thus saith the lord now to me that's
[52:57] god's grace
[52:58] that's god's grace to me
[53:02] oh yeah and then the guard he said the
[53:03] uh vultures turned into gargoyles
[53:06] and then again heard brace yourself
[53:08] brace yourself so you brace yourself if
[53:10] you're gonna have an impact right
[53:11] if you're gonna hit something so to me
[53:16] oh then he had a third dream he said
[53:18] there was shortage on cash
[53:20] at a bank he went to and in the dream
[53:23] the u.s was no longer printing coins
[53:26] and he they said no one dollars one
[53:28] dollar bill or five dollar bills in the
[53:30] future so in other words they're going
[53:31] to stop
[53:32] doing cash has become a cash to society
[53:36] now just so you know he had that dream
[53:37] on the 24th
[53:39] because he said i'm sorry 25th he said
[53:40] he had the night before
[53:42] but cnn has an article that uh
[53:45] businesses were already running out of
[53:47] cash on june 18th
[53:49] so in other words this again is after
[53:51] the fact this wasn't prophetic
[53:54] so i'm just letting you know the only
[53:55] thing that's prophetic is september
[53:56] november all the other stuff we have no
[53:58] proof that it was
[53:59] prophetic okay because it's all after
[54:01] the fact
[54:02] and i take that same approach with
[54:04] brother branham like when i made the
[54:05] video about brother brown three
[54:06] prophecies
[54:07] i used i could only use prophecies that
[54:10] were
[54:10] recorded before the fact
[54:14] because i can't go back and prove i
[54:15] wasn't there in 1933
[54:17] there's no recordings in 1933 with the
[54:19] seven major visions
[54:20] do i believe there thus saith the lord
[54:21] absolutely but can i prove
[54:24] that they were before the fact no i
[54:26] can't because the first mention is 1958.
[54:28] so just an overlay man that's why you
[54:30] don't notice on some of these videos
[54:32] uh i have to be very careful because i
[54:34] can't go back and i can't prove that
[54:36] that actually happened
[54:37] because there's no recording of it but i
[54:39] believe it
[54:40] i do believe it all right
[54:45] um so again now look how close this is
[54:47] to the message
[54:48] you have crazy creatures in the
[54:50] tribulation right
[54:52] you have uh soldiers invading
[54:56] now you have this is revelation 13 no
[54:58] cash
[54:59] right they they can cut off cat they can
[55:01] control the
[55:02] economy he said the warns of civil war
[55:06] in the u.s now that
[55:07] i've never heard that he said troops in
[55:10] our cities but
[55:11] didn't mention that perhaps they'll
[55:13] invade
[55:15] and his suggestion he's the thing to do
[55:16] he said the main thing is pray
[55:18] but he said i suggest you stockpile food
[55:22] gold silver guns and ammunition
[55:25] okay now people feel led to do that
[55:28] that's fine
[55:29] um i haven't you know
[55:33] uh so to me that again there's a like
[55:36] that connection to the
[55:39] the business of selling food and money
[55:41] and or guns and gold and things like
[55:42] that
[55:44] i don't but then again like bill graham
[55:47] said we might have to go through some
[55:48] trying times
[55:50] the thing is we don't know so we have to
[55:53] love we have to trust god love and do
[55:54] what we feel like to do praise god
[55:57] so do what we feel led to do
[56:03] hope i don't forget anything here okay
[56:04] so that's his family
[56:07] assemblies of god
[56:11] so observations he's sincere now this is
[56:14] interesting
[56:15] this is another reason why we know he's
[56:16] not a prophet because he says
[56:18] he never said thus saith the lord this
[56:20] was never thus saith the lord yet he
[56:21] kept saying i believe i know the voice
[56:22] of god i believe
[56:23] yet he's reading 40 newspapers a day
[56:25] it's hard to i say
[56:27] can you say amen it's hard to hear the
[56:28] still small voice of the lord
[56:31] what if you just watched 40 videos a day
[56:34] that weren't message could you hear the
[56:37] voice of god dead
[56:39] i think i might hear the voice of donald
[56:40] trump right
[56:43] i start hearing his voice
[56:46] 40. that's a lot no 40.
[56:49] i have never gone back to see how many
[56:51] youtube videos i watching today
[56:53] but i'd be interested to see how many i
[56:54] do i hope it's not 40.
[56:57] i hope maybe on my worst day maybe
[57:01] um because because i see how it affects
[57:03] me spiritually
[57:05] like i tell mother johnny i've said it
[57:07] here i can't watch some of these women
[57:09] uh
[57:09] politicians in washington my blood will
[57:12] boil because
[57:13] they kill babies if they say they're for
[57:15] all lives matter
[57:17] it just makes you want to cry now it's
[57:19] awful
[57:20] these people are so demon possessed and
[57:23] murderers they don't even know
[57:24] they're so blind the mystery of iniquity
[57:27] has totally
[57:28] taken them over it's awful
[57:31] and then my children you know my
[57:33] children say daddy how can
[57:35] these politicians like abortion you know
[57:38] because we just saw
[57:38] the baby born we we're seeing the glory
[57:42] of a baby and like you're like daddy how
[57:45] can these people
[57:46] i said i said haven i said kate cares
[57:49] they're filled with demons
[57:51] they are murderers they're filled with
[57:55] evil the glory of seeing the baby
[57:59] and the beauty of it and the the
[58:02] innocence
[58:02] you know zion cries he's like
[58:06] yeah i'm like you're so precious
[58:10] like he can't do anything he's got to
[58:12] rely on me for everything well not me
[58:14] my wife but he's so precious got this
[58:17] little whimpery weak cry
[58:19] and that's god and god he's a servant to
[58:21] god
[58:23] he's god's little servant and jesus came
[58:25] that way one time
[58:26] humbled himself i just think it's
[58:29] amazing
[58:30] now he does he's humble in the way that
[58:32] he says he said if this doesn't happen
[58:34] now look we said by december 1st it
[58:36] doesn't happen he said you're welcome to
[58:38] say i was wrong wow
[58:41] that's quite a statement so he's saying
[58:44] all that
[58:45] troops gargoyles can you imagine a
[58:49] person making a statement we're going to
[58:50] have gargoyles out here
[58:52] by december 1st can you imagine somebody
[58:54] go on the internet and say that
[58:57] you'd have to be really led of the lord
[59:00] or really deceived so just
[59:03] watch that what if i said bang there's
[59:06] going to be a gargoyle out here tonight
[59:07] after service
[59:09] what would you think you might think i
[59:12] was
[59:13] losing my mind parkinson's is setting in
[59:16] something like that so just letting you
[59:18] know i mean we gotta look at these
[59:19] things with a spiritual mind right
[59:22] so these are the only ones that are
[59:23] before the facts i wanted to preach this
[59:25] before september
[59:26] okay so everybody could pray up we're
[59:28] gonna pray here a little bit
[59:31] i'm almost at 40 minutes and these
[59:34] sermons are a little bit easier to pay
[59:35] attention right because it's
[59:36] it's so outside of the ordinary it's not
[59:38] just like the words
[59:41] it's kind of just telling a story of
[59:43] what people are
[59:44] saying now this is interesting
[59:48] and i've seen a message pastor he really
[59:51] believes this is going to happen but
[59:53] he believes we can pray and push it off
[59:55] to the future now that could be
[59:58] that could be no doubt about that um
[1:00:02] but again it's not thus saith the lord
[1:00:06] he pastors church and berksville
[1:00:10] kentucky that was right near where
[1:00:14] brother brown was born
[1:00:16] isn't that shocking like that shook me
[1:00:18] like oh
[1:00:19] wow right where brother brown was born
[1:00:22] look he said 42 years ago this is 1951
[1:00:25] sixth day of april
[1:00:26] god gave me my life on this earth in a
[1:00:28] little cabin near brooksville
[1:00:31] so the message pastor caught that and i
[1:00:33] didn't catch that at first i was like
[1:00:34] wow a man from brother graham's almost
[1:00:38] birth place america kentucky
[1:00:44] and then talking about the squeeze and
[1:00:46] literally at the end of
[1:00:47] the very end of the video he says he
[1:00:49] said get ready there's coming an oil
[1:00:50] press there's coming a squeeze upon
[1:00:52] the church i'm like well well there's a
[1:00:56] lot of things that are pretty yeah
[1:00:57] they're pretty close in there
[1:01:00] so what i'm saying is i've never seen it
[1:01:02] this close before
[1:01:03] this is a lot closer than the shemitah
[1:01:05] and the harbinger
[1:01:07] and the blood moons it's a lot closer
[1:01:10] but then we see some things that are a
[1:01:11] little bit off
[1:01:15] now one thing he never mentions the
[1:01:16] rapture so in his vision brother then he
[1:01:19] said he saw after november now
[1:01:21] he said he saw christians hiding out
[1:01:23] their homes with all their gun and
[1:01:24] ammunition in other words
[1:01:25] fighting for themselves right
[1:01:29] which we know there may be some foolish
[1:01:31] virgins have to do that
[1:01:34] now i watch a guy give a comment on this
[1:01:37] just a short video
[1:01:38] and he made a good point he said uh
[1:01:41] he said what what what would a christian
[1:01:45] do what would be worth killing a sinner
[1:01:47] for for a christian
[1:01:49] in other words how is that going to help
[1:01:51] a christian's testimony to kill somebody
[1:01:54] he said would it be okay for you to kill
[1:01:55] somebody over your car oh don't steal my
[1:01:57] car i'm going to shoot you and kill you
[1:01:58] would that be a good reason to kill
[1:02:00] somebody
[1:02:02] so that that the man who responded this
[1:02:04] he made a good point he said
[1:02:05] i just can't see god's people shooting
[1:02:08] that mowing down people with an ar rifle
[1:02:12] because in the bible you see people just
[1:02:14] surrendering
[1:02:16] right you see stephen surrender you say
[1:02:18] oh god receive my spirit
[1:02:20] he goes to sleep and then the stones all
[1:02:22] hit him you see jesus did jesus fight
[1:02:24] back
[1:02:25] jesus didn't fight back when they came
[1:02:27] to arrest him so
[1:02:28] but again i'm not going to say that's
[1:02:30] has to be thus saith the lord how it's
[1:02:31] going to i don't know how it's going to
[1:02:33] be
[1:02:33] i don't want to be here to know what
[1:02:34] it's going to be like
[1:02:37] but we have to take these things into
[1:02:38] consideration okay when you start
[1:02:40] looking at people's
[1:02:42] uh prophecies so to me it's like he's
[1:02:44] speaking to believers preparing for the
[1:02:46] tribulation
[1:02:48] but again we might have to prepare for
[1:02:49] the squeeze i don't know
[1:02:51] it's never thus saith the lord that i
[1:02:53] found and remember i went through all
[1:02:54] three thousand i looked at this week
[1:02:55] i went through all three thousand of
[1:02:57] those years ago and i never found a
[1:02:59] squeeze thus saith the lord
[1:03:05] it's the most scriptural yeah he calls
[1:03:06] out an oil press
[1:03:08] um squeeze most scriptural dream about
[1:03:11] the squeeze that i've heard in
[1:03:12] denominations or ever
[1:03:15] well i'm sorry maybe i'd take that back
[1:03:16] i think amen and hula have had some
[1:03:18] really good dreams about the rapture
[1:03:19] remember that
[1:03:20] i forgot to write that down um they've
[1:03:23] had some good
[1:03:24] dreams like one of them i think
[1:03:26] sisterhood correct me if i'm wrong
[1:03:28] one of them is like we were all
[1:03:29] protected in this white
[1:03:31] or something in the sky we were like in
[1:03:32] some type of cube and we were protected
[1:03:34] up in the air
[1:03:35] while the world was going through
[1:03:36] tribulation something like that
[1:03:39] does that sound familiar yes okay
[1:03:45] yeah praise god i think right when you
[1:03:46] came okay praise the lord yeah before he
[1:03:48] even came here
[1:03:49] that's right um so that's a very
[1:03:52] scriptural dream
[1:03:53] we're at the meeting in the air while
[1:03:55] the world's going through
[1:03:57] tribulation brother amen's had dreams
[1:04:00] about uh
[1:04:02] you know a little bit of squeeze us
[1:04:05] under
[1:04:05] uh some pressure i call it like that
[1:04:10] and then jesus being with us
[1:04:14] so um in the nominations this is the
[1:04:17] closest thing i've seen to it
[1:04:18] now let's go the other one
[1:04:24] this is a really good one um as far as
[1:04:29] you'll see now this is a brand new this
[1:04:32] was new to me
[1:04:33] if you got your bible go to psalm 90 10
[1:04:37] um you may remember i preach a little
[1:04:40] bit on generations
[1:04:41] from time to time a generation seems to
[1:04:44] be 40 years in the bible
[1:04:46] right but ram said that but then there's
[1:04:48] so many generation scriptures that
[1:04:50] it's kind of hard to tell sometimes
[1:04:53] exactly how
[1:04:54] long a generation is okay so
[1:04:57] what i'm saying is that it's a little
[1:04:58] bit unclear i don't know if it's exactly
[1:05:00] 40 years every time
[1:05:03] just because there's different
[1:05:04] scriptures that make it seem like longer
[1:05:06] okay and i i didn't have that study
[1:05:08] ready for today that's why i said i mean
[1:05:09] if you have questions you'll share them
[1:05:11] with me i'll research them this week
[1:05:14] um but that's just from my memory psalm
[1:05:16] 90 10. now
[1:05:18] they use this scripture
[1:05:21] verse 10. the days of our years are
[1:05:23] three score intense that's 70 right
[1:05:25] three score
[1:05:26] 60. uh and if by reason of strength
[1:05:29] maybe four score years
[1:05:30] yet is their strength labor and sorrow
[1:05:34] for it is soon cut off and we fly away
[1:05:37] so david of course is saying
[1:05:40] i'm sorry this is a prayer moses i'm
[1:05:41] sorry yeah moses i
[1:05:43] thought they said david so moses prayed
[1:05:46] this so moses is saying
[1:05:47] you know god gives us 70 years jesus
[1:05:50] only got 33.
[1:05:51] right so we got it we got to understand
[1:05:54] these are not like that 70 years not a
[1:05:56] promise to everybody
[1:05:56] it's not a guarantee it's god's general
[1:05:59] promise right
[1:06:00] it's just a general promise
[1:06:04] uh but he said sometimes it may extend
[1:06:06] to 80 years
[1:06:08] okay so then jesus uh said this
[1:06:11] generation will not pass
[1:06:12] so all these things be fulfilled he said
[1:06:15] when the fig tree is bringing forth its
[1:06:17] bud
[1:06:18] he said look lift up your heads
[1:06:19] redemption draws nigh and he said this
[1:06:21] generation that sees the fig tree
[1:06:23] putting forth its bud will not pass
[1:06:25] until they see the coming of the lord
[1:06:28] okay so brother random uses this in the
[1:06:30] church age book i don't have this in
[1:06:31] front of me
[1:06:33] but the reason i remember is because i
[1:06:34] preached it here a couple years ago
[1:06:36] and someone in the message met me and
[1:06:37] bawled me out for saying it
[1:06:40] but i was just making the point brother
[1:06:41] braham said he said everything's
[1:06:43] fulfilled
[1:06:43] in the church age book he said uh this
[1:06:46] generation won't pass till they see the
[1:06:47] coming of the lord well
[1:06:48] if a generation is 40 years what's 65
[1:06:52] plus 40.
[1:06:53] 2005. so if that's your strict
[1:06:56] definition
[1:06:57] all these things have to happen in this
[1:06:58] generation well then that mist
[1:07:00] but it wasn't thus saith the lord so
[1:07:03] it's okay
[1:07:05] right he's like was 1977. it wasn't
[1:07:07] though the lord
[1:07:08] it's someone it's a prophet who's really
[1:07:10] trying to inspire people to get ready
[1:07:12] praise god
[1:07:14] get ready signs are lining up all these
[1:07:16] things are happening
[1:07:17] and he bawled me out but by the end he
[1:07:19] uh i was crying and he was crying too
[1:07:21] and he couldn't disagree with me by the
[1:07:22] end praise god he was upset i was using
[1:07:25] youtube and
[1:07:26] making videos and i was weeping i was
[1:07:28] saying i said right across the subway i
[1:07:30] said
[1:07:31] i said i'm making those because if my
[1:07:34] family won't come hear me preach
[1:07:35] maybe they'll click and watch me preach
[1:07:37] on there
[1:07:39] if they won't come in this church maybe
[1:07:41] in this in the sincerity of their home
[1:07:42] the quietness the secret place maybe the
[1:07:45] holy spirit would
[1:07:46] move them to hear the word of god
[1:07:49] so i'd do anything to get them to hear
[1:07:51] the word of god praise god
[1:07:53] and i think you could see it by the end
[1:07:54] hopefully i don't know where he's at now
[1:07:56] but
[1:07:58] so with that i just have a couple slides
[1:08:00] on many sides so what this man is saying
[1:08:02] he's saying if israel became a nation in
[1:08:05] 1948
[1:08:06] if you add 80 years that's 2028.
[1:08:12] okay we just passed the 70. you remember
[1:08:15] that the brother put it on youtube
[1:08:17] i'm sorry the brother in the philippines
[1:08:18] put on youtube like get ready it's the
[1:08:20] 70th year
[1:08:21] this might be the end this might be the
[1:08:22] rapture year which it wasn't
[1:08:26] but i mean i'm glad he's trying to get
[1:08:27] people ready but sometimes
[1:08:29] you know guessing it just kind of wears
[1:08:31] people out you keep guessing every year
[1:08:33] it's going to wear people out but i
[1:08:36] appreciate people wanting it
[1:08:38] it's okay to guess it's okay to predict
[1:08:43] so his point is that scripture could be
[1:08:47] a generation it might be
[1:08:48] it might but notice the word generation
[1:08:50] isn't used
[1:08:52] in psalms 90 verse 10 but that doesn't
[1:08:54] mean god could be hiding it from the
[1:08:55] eyes of the wise and prudent revealing
[1:08:56] on the basis if anybody believes that
[1:08:58] we believe it praise god okay so he's
[1:09:01] saying if the tribulation is seven years
[1:09:03] which i believe it is now i used to
[1:09:04] think it was only three and a half
[1:09:06] i do believe by scripture it is now
[1:09:07] because i went back and studied it
[1:09:09] i think i was wrong he's saying if if
[1:09:13] um the tribulation is seven years
[1:09:16] and this all the generation that sees
[1:09:19] the israel restored
[1:09:21] they have to uh see the rapture then
[1:09:24] he's saying
[1:09:25] the rapture has to take place this year
[1:09:28] because uh the following year if you add
[1:09:31] those up
[1:09:34] uh you have to in other words you have
[1:09:35] to fit the seven years within there
[1:09:37] i can't explain it very good i didn't
[1:09:38] like i said i didn't have enough time to
[1:09:39] study it but
[1:09:40] i see the point he's making right i see
[1:09:43] the point he's making
[1:09:48] um now here's his points that he ends
[1:09:51] with i thought some of them are
[1:09:52] scriptural
[1:09:53] now look he thinks the rapture will come
[1:09:55] now this guy is a uh
[1:09:56] uh seven-day adventist by the way i
[1:09:58] looked it up seventh day at venice which
[1:10:00] they have a lot of good things they're
[1:10:02] against worldly music
[1:10:04] they're against uh immoral dressing
[1:10:07] but then they wear high heels and makeup
[1:10:09] you know they cut their hair
[1:10:12] so this is true do we have ever
[1:10:14] increasing birth pains
[1:10:15] yeah that's true now he brings out in
[1:10:18] january right before the coronavirus
[1:10:20] came
[1:10:20] trump tried to make a deal of the
[1:10:22] century i don't remember this he tried
[1:10:23] to make a deal of the century
[1:10:25] uh with israel but the palestinians turn
[1:10:27] it down
[1:10:28] but this guy thought that it will divide
[1:10:31] the land of israel and give israel more
[1:10:33] land
[1:10:34] but i know the palestinians didn't
[1:10:35] accept it at least back then
[1:10:39] he said we have israel aged to 72 or
[1:10:41] we're approaching the last eligible fall
[1:10:43] season
[1:10:45] in order for the fig tree generation
[1:10:47] matthew 24
[1:10:48] to be fulfilled okay so that one that
[1:10:52] one i don't know
[1:10:55] now here's one i forgot yeah he said
[1:10:56] there's a solar eclipse coming in 2024
[1:11:00] which would land on the feast of the
[1:11:02] tabernacles now that represents
[1:11:04] uh the millennium because right you're
[1:11:05] in booths you're building your own house
[1:11:06] and booths
[1:11:09] so he's saying the millennium or he said
[1:11:12] it has to happen
[1:11:12] there because you have a total solar
[1:11:16] eclipse
[1:11:17] he said oh because it's 2020 and we have
[1:11:19] perfect vision
[1:11:21] well what if you do 2020 bc did they
[1:11:23] have perfect vision back then in 2020 bc
[1:11:26] right i mean if you make 2020 so
[1:11:28] important what about bc
[1:11:30] what about the first 2020 after adam
[1:11:33] lived
[1:11:35] i don't know and then this is true right
[1:11:38] here
[1:11:39] the beast system is rising right we see
[1:11:41] it that's what i think that's what cove
[1:11:43] is all about
[1:11:44] it's testing the people to see what
[1:11:45] they'll give up because they ha we know
[1:11:47] the bible
[1:11:48] revelation 13 they have to have a one
[1:11:49] world government and they have to have a
[1:11:51] one world currency
[1:11:52] they're able to shut it down they have
[1:11:54] to and have control where you can't get
[1:11:56] your money
[1:11:56] unless you take this mark it has to
[1:11:58] happen so see like i said
[1:12:00] a few of these these two are for sure
[1:12:05] i'm not sure about the other things okay
[1:12:07] so let me finish up here
[1:12:08] here's the reasons i don't think it's
[1:12:10] 2020. now myself
[1:12:12] could it happen in 2020 yes it could
[1:12:15] but the reason i don't think is because
[1:12:18] brother the holy spirit told brother
[1:12:19] pick brother man pick up your pen and
[1:12:20] write and the he said the bride will be
[1:12:22] forced to stop preaching according to
[1:12:24] revelation 13 16.
[1:12:28] and that hasn't happened yet okay
[1:12:31] now it could but i feel like god
[1:12:34] i was listening to brother branham said
[1:12:38] and this is true historically all the
[1:12:40] christians were out of israel
[1:12:43] five years before titus came in 70 a.d
[1:12:46] because the holy spirit kept warning
[1:12:48] them through prophets get out titus is
[1:12:49] coming
[1:12:50] get out and they're out four or five
[1:12:51] years beforehand in other words god made
[1:12:53] sure
[1:12:54] not one of their hairs was touched
[1:12:56] praise god that's how much
[1:12:57] god takes care of his holy ghost field
[1:12:59] saints when judgment was coming
[1:13:02] god takes care of his people in other
[1:13:04] words what i'm saying is if
[1:13:05] if the rapture was going to come and i'm
[1:13:07] forced to stop preaching before the
[1:13:08] rapture
[1:13:09] i'm i feel like god would give me plenty
[1:13:11] of time to prepare
[1:13:13] if he gave them five years
[1:13:16] i'd at least hope for a week maybe i
[1:13:18] don't know a day
[1:13:19] i'll take anything you know um
[1:13:23] so i just feel like god would give us
[1:13:25] time to prepare
[1:13:26] i feel like god is gonna make it sure
[1:13:28] he's gonna take care you're not gonna
[1:13:29] hide it from us we'll know the season
[1:13:32] i'd just be you know we'll see the dead
[1:13:33] in christ that's what i believe
[1:13:36] mother and says in the church age book
[1:13:37] the united states has to change
[1:13:39] laws against the bride they're probably
[1:13:41] going to call it hate speech right
[1:13:42] they're probably going to call us
[1:13:43] hate speech which we're not we're love
[1:13:45] speech but they're
[1:13:47] but they have to do that that's gonna
[1:13:49] now they you know they can pass
[1:13:50] legislation real quick
[1:13:52] but we don't see those laws in the mix
[1:13:55] yet
[1:13:56] okay uh seven major visions brother
[1:13:59] branham
[1:13:59] in some places he says five of them are
[1:14:01] fulfilled but in another place he said
[1:14:03] we don't even have the roads yet the
[1:14:05] highways for the driverless cars
[1:14:09] so i believe to me this is my opinion
[1:14:11] driverless cars have to happen before
[1:14:13] the rapture
[1:14:14] because after the rapture the two
[1:14:15] prophets come down and then it doesn't
[1:14:17] rain for three and a half years
[1:14:19] that's in israel and that's when they
[1:14:22] have control over all nature
[1:14:24] so i feel like things have to be looking
[1:14:26] beautiful and oh prosperity peace and
[1:14:29] safety remember that pieces they'll be
[1:14:30] saying peace safety
[1:14:31] i believe that will all have to happen
[1:14:32] before the rapture because then the
[1:14:34] bible says sudden what
[1:14:35] destruction sun destruction
[1:14:38] i mean church when this bride goes up
[1:14:40] there's no more blood
[1:14:42] are you with me we are the the holy
[1:14:45] spirit is our life
[1:14:47] there's no more mercy it's judgment
[1:14:50] that's what god said god said i'm
[1:14:51] my my spirit will not always strive with
[1:14:53] man once i get those eight in the ark
[1:14:56] it's over and i believe the same thing
[1:14:58] will happen this day
[1:15:00] once that bride's gone god knows none of
[1:15:03] these people
[1:15:04] really want to sell out to the word
[1:15:06] that's a hard thing to say
[1:15:08] but that's true because it happened in
[1:15:10] those it happened in the days of noah
[1:15:13] people don't want to think about the
[1:15:14] word anymore they don't want to meditate
[1:15:15] on the word and praise god
[1:15:17] they just want to live worldly
[1:15:21] uh also i said this this morning not
[1:15:23] every nation has heard the message
[1:15:26] matthew jesus said the gospel must be
[1:15:27] preached to every nation a priest
[1:15:29] i don't mean play tape that means preach
[1:15:32] right
[1:15:33] i know i'm heavy on that you know and i
[1:15:34] don't want to hurt anybody's feelings on
[1:15:36] that but
[1:15:38] don't get me wrong i do think it's okay
[1:15:40] to if i play the tape a little bit you
[1:15:42] hear brother man's voice i think that's
[1:15:43] okay
[1:15:43] i told by amen too if i ever got sick
[1:15:45] and we had to play tape i would play a
[1:15:47] tape
[1:15:48] but that's brother brandon said never
[1:15:49] said that's the way to do it
[1:15:51] okay just i think most people understand
[1:15:53] that
[1:15:54] so we need translators missionaries and
[1:15:57] then the warning is coming through a
[1:15:58] denomination
[1:16:00] okay just like with jonathan khan
[1:16:01] denominational guy
[1:16:03] nice guy probably prays for the sick i
[1:16:06] think
[1:16:06] this guy prays for the sick he's
[1:16:07] pentecostal but it's not thus saith the
[1:16:10] lord
[1:16:11] right and it's not coming in the message
[1:16:13] of the hour
[1:16:15] that doesn't mean god can't use him
[1:16:17] right god can use him god can speak
[1:16:18] through a donkey
[1:16:19] uh god can speak any way he wants just
[1:16:22] speak through a star he can use a star
[1:16:23] to speak
[1:16:24] he can do anything he can speak by
[1:16:26] putting a hand right on a wall and he
[1:16:27] can speak that way
[1:16:28] he can do whatever he wants to do but we
[1:16:31] just feel like it wouldn't come through
[1:16:32] denomination
[1:16:35] now brother man ends the seventh seal by
[1:16:37] saying help me god i tell you the truth
[1:16:39] these are spiritually discerned to me
[1:16:40] discerned by the holy spirit by every
[1:16:42] one of them has identified his place in
[1:16:43] the bible
[1:16:44] now what this great secret is ladies
[1:16:46] beneath the seventh seal i don't know
[1:16:48] i don't know i couldn't make it out i
[1:16:50] couldn't tell just what it was
[1:16:51] just what it said but i know that it was
[1:16:54] them seven thunders uttering themselves
[1:16:55] right out close together just banging
[1:16:57] seven different times
[1:16:58] but it unfolded something else that i
[1:17:00] seen then when i seen that i looked for
[1:17:02] the interpretation that flew across
[1:17:04] there
[1:17:04] and i couldn't make it out it's exactly
[1:17:06] right friends see the hour isn't quite
[1:17:08] yet for it but it's moving into that
[1:17:10] cycle see it's coming up close so when
[1:17:14] the seventh seal
[1:17:15] obama said in the sevens it was open all
[1:17:17] the revelation flew by i couldn't see it
[1:17:19] that's the day and hour of the rapture
[1:17:21] it's a secret god i'm gonna let it be
[1:17:22] known
[1:17:24] so the thing to do for bride of christ
[1:17:27] fellowship
[1:17:27] is remember that i speak to you in the
[1:17:30] name of the lord
[1:17:32] be prepared for you don't know what time
[1:17:35] something can happen
[1:17:36] the holy spirit i felt just brought this
[1:17:37] quote back to my mind let's remember who
[1:17:39] spoke to us in the name of the lord
[1:17:42] and these are good like i'm very glad
[1:17:44] johnny and bank very thank very very
[1:17:46] thankful you shared these with me
[1:17:47] because i want to be watching right i
[1:17:49] want to be watching but i need to pray
[1:17:50] more praise god
[1:17:52] you need to watch him pray okay close
[1:17:54] with this
[1:17:56] this is the scripture my title but of
[1:17:59] that day and hour no no man
