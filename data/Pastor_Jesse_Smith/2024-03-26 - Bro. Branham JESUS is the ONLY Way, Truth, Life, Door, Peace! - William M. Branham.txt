TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God expects his children to trust him for everything that they have but we want to trust the hand of man I'd rather have my hopes built in Christ taking my solemn stand upon on his grace and mercy than any educated group of people who would form an organization say this is the way Christ said I am the way the truth and the light amen and no man cometh through the father except he comes by Me Jesus said he was the truth amen so you cannot have truth till you have Jesus how do you get him by being borned again but you can't have truth till you have Jesus you can't have be in the way until you're in Jesus how do you get into him by one Spirit we're all bap ties into one body then you're in Jesus then you're in the way then you're in the truth Jesus said I am the way the truth and another thing the third thing Jesus we have come to him he's the only light there is it's right all we want to differ with that but it's true Jesus is the only light there is you say I'm a russellite camelite whatever you might be it's a false light you might be in the russellite church you might be in the camelite church or some other light church but until you get in Jesus you're not in light you're still in darkness amen you don't have light till you come to him for he is the way the truth and the light and the only way to God no man cometh to the father except by me so you can't go to God you can't go to heaven you have to get in the way and Jesus is that way he is the only truth that there is and he's the only light the only true light the only true manifested light is Jesus Christ amen we have Marmon light we have Methodist light we have Baptist light we have Pentecostal light we have all kinds of lights but Jesus is the True Light amen he's the only light now we read in St John the 10th chapter Jesus said I am the door to the Sheepfold I am the door amen not a door the door am the only door I am the way amen the only way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me amen I am the door to the Sheepfold and all that comes before me is enemies thieves and robbers he is the door to the Sheepfold he is the door to Salvation there's not another name given under heaven whereby you must be saved only through the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah no church no denomination no Creed no doctrines of anything only through Jesus name Hallelujah that is the that is is the key amen no wonder if Peter could use one of them on the day of Pentecost they wanted to know how to get into that door he used the key and there's only one key because there's just one door I am the door and Peter had the key to it and he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin and you shall receive the treasures of God Amen it's the key to the door in Jesus is the door there's only one door to healing and Jesus is that door Peace my peace I give unto you he's only one door to genuine peace Hallelujah you might think you got peace you might accumulate enough money to buy your home you might accumulate enough money to get your children clothes have food to eat but you might have uh accumulate enough popularity to be popular amongst people but when you slip off your shoes at night am and get ready to lay down there's only one thing can give you peace that is if you know you were dying that night there's only one peace and that's Jesus is the peace oh Hallelujah he is our peace
