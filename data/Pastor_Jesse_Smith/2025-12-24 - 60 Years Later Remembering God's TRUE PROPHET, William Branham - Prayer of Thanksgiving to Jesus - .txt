TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Dear Lord [music] Jesus, today on the 60th anniversary of you taking your servant home, we want to thank you, Lord Jesus, [music] for sending your prophet, Brother William Brham, as the prophets foretold he would be sent. Thank you that Daniel [music] said your book would be sealed up even to the time of the end when you [music] would break your seven seals and reveal them to your servant, Brother Brandham, fulfilling Revelation 10 [music] 1-7. Thank you, Lord, that Joel said you'd restore your church with a former and latter [music] reign and that brother Brandham's ministry was the former reign or the teaching reign as you promised. Thank [music] you, Lord, that you told Malachi you'd turn our hearts back to the fathers by the spirit of Elijah. And brother Aram [music] had the spirit of Elijah and our hearts are now turned back to the apostolic fathers. And Lord, you included [music] you yourself in your son of man ministry, in your earthly prophetic ministry, and you foretold [music] Elias would come and restore all things. Thank you, Lord, that we can recognize brother Brandham as a true Bible-based [music] prophet, as you describe prophets in Numbers 12. If there be a prophet among you, I, the Lord, will make myself [music] known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream. Thank you, Lord, that you made yourself known to brother Brandham in his [music] visions. He saw the seven major visions of 1933. He saw the [music] vision of the preview of the bride. He saw a vision of Congressman Upshaw's healing. He saw thousands of visions nightly [music] in the discernment prayer lines and he saw a vision of a little lamb in Miltown and prayed for that [music] lamb and the lamb was healed. Lord, thank you for giving Brother Brandham dreams as he dreamed in 1962 to [music] stay home and store up food the sermons we listen to today and preach [music] behind pulpits. Thank you for giving him the dream of hope and ma [music] with him when the crowns were being given out in the fifth seal sermon. Thank you [music] Lord that brother Brandham foretold events in your name that came to pass fulfilling James 5:10 and Deuteronomy 18:es [music] 19- 22. Thank you that in [music] 1958 he told a mother she'd have a baby with thus sayeth the Lord and it came to pass [music] 10 years later &gt;&gt; and you're suffering with a female trouble and you've got a desire in your heart to have a baby and you can't have the baby and you come from Denver, Colorado. Thus sayeth the Lord. That's right. Go home and receive your child. God will give it to you. Thank you that in 1961 [music] he said thus sayith the Lord there'll never be a greater gift to the Gentiles and there hasn't been &gt;&gt; is right here among you. You'll just remember thus saith the Lord you will never in any oh more gentile church age ever see any sign to succeed this go greater. This is the last sign to the church. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, that he foretold the continued debauchery of women immorally [music] dressing in 1962 and we see it fulfilled. &gt;&gt; 30 years ago, I've got thus sayeth the Lord. 30 years ago when I entered the ministry, he told me that the strain of women would come so immoral and imputed in the last days. It' be the most defiled thing on the earth, RIGHT? SHE STARTED AT THE BEGINNING AND SATAN used her at the end. And look what is happening. Look down through the years. Said she'll continue to strip herself AND SAID THERE'LL JUST BE A LITTLE TINY GROUP OF THE very elected that's predestinated will escape that. Also, thank you [music] for telling him that his new commission would be vindicated by a snow white pyramid in 1962, which came to pass months later in 1963. [music] I could see those angels, those shapedback wings TRAVELING FASTER THAN SOUND could travel. They come from eternity in a SPLIT LIKE A TWINKLING OF AN EYE. NOT ENOUGH TO BAT your eye, just a twinkle. They were there. I didn't have time to count. I DIDN'T HAVE TIME THAN JUST LOOK MIGHTY ONES, GREAT POWERFUL ANGELS, SNOW WHITE, WINGS SETTING HEADS, AND THEY WERE. And when it did, I WAS CAUGHT UP into this pyramid of constellations. And then it come to me, not a voice, just come to me. Oh, that is the angels of the Lord coming to give me my new commission. I'M STANDING IN AN AWFUL PLACE IF YOU BUT KNEW IT. &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, I TELL YOU, IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, I've told you the truth. And something's fixing to happen. Thank [music] you that he spoke with thus sayeth the Lord that the United States church would continue to [music] fall away and be known for their rock and roll and immoral behavior so that we would not be a part of that immoral church &gt;&gt; vision. Notice just closing. I want to say this one thing just before closing. That's what led me to say this. It's thus saith the Lord. Some of the dirtiest looking things I ever seen in my life. And when the American church come up, it was the awsten. The heavenly father is my judge. They had on these tattletail gray skirts like one of these barroom girls with no back on it up here holding up like a gray looking piece of paper and like a hoola dancing paint short bobbed hair smoking cigarettes and twisting as they walk to rock and roll. And I said, "Is that the church of the United States?" And the voice said, "Yes, it is." And when they &gt;&gt; and thank you Lord that [music] he correctly prophesied the going home of a sister just as Elijah [music] did in the Old Testament &gt;&gt; that I had to come to that family with thus sayeth the Lord their daughter is going to die too Florence. I saw her in a vision, saw her go, and I know she's going. And I said, "Pray. Just pray." You know, there's a prophet one time was told to go tell a king to put his house in order. And he prayed and he spared his life 15 years longer. I said, "Pray." anybody. &gt;&gt; And finally, Lord, [music] thank you that he spoke with thus sayith the Lord the prophecy that no denomination would ever break up and come back to the word, proving to us he [music] was a prophet of God and we were to stay out of denominationalism. &gt;&gt; It's predicted that they're going to do it and they're going to do it for THUS SAYETH THE LORD THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT. You think them nominations will ever break up their denomination, come back to the word? It's thus sayeth the Lord they won't. Will they go into the Antichrist? Exactly as thus sayeth the Lord they will. &gt;&gt; We just want to say [music] thank you Lord for everything you did in Brother Ram's ministry. Thank you Lord for giving [music] us the finished mysteries as Revelation 10 1-7 promised. Also [music] confirmed by Amos 3:7. You've given us [music] the secret things of God. Thank you that brother Ram's prophetic [music] ministry has given us courage as 2 Chronicles 15:8 says. And when Asa heard [music] these words in the prophecy of Oed the prophet, he took courage and put away the abominable idols. Brother Brham has given us courage [music] to put away our sins. Thank you that brother Bram's ministry was your compassion toward us according to [music] 2 Chronicles 36:15-16. and the Lord God of their father sent to them [music] by his messengers because he had compassion on his people. Thank you that brother Ram's prophetic ministry [music] has given us spiritual prosperity as 2 Chronicles 20:20 and Ezra 6:14 declare, "Believe in the Lord your God, so shall you [music] be established. Believe as prophets, so shall you prosper." And the elders of the Jews build it and they prospered [music] through the prophesying of Hagi the prophet and Zechariah the son of Ido. This [music] is amazing grace. Thank you for giving us men that will still [music] preach the Bible message. As brother Brandham told us he was getting old. If time would roll on, he was going to walk off the scene and said, [music] "You've got to fill our shoes. &gt;&gt; You're a young man. I'm getting old. Brother Neville's getting old. We're a middle-aged man. If time rolls on, we're going to walk off the scene next to a while. You've got to fill our shoes. &gt;&gt; And so, you see, and then maybe in that day even it'll be growing greater if there is a tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Thank you. That brother [music] Graham said, "These men if they pick up this and goes out with it, they can make more sense [music] to it." See, then hope they make it come to life. these men if they pick up this and go out with it, they can make more sense to it. See to bring it to a place you I just want to lay this seed. Hope they make it come to life. &gt;&gt; And thank you that brother Ram said these young men [music] can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if he doesn't come in my generation. as I'm beginning get old and know that my days are numbered [music] and know now that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if he doesn't come in and my generation which [music] I'm hoping to see him. I look daily for him and watch keeping myself prepared for that hour. &gt;&gt; Yes, we thank [music] you Lord for sending Elijah as you promised. Thank you that he didn't sit at home but gathered more physically with his brothers [music] and sisters in a church building as he saw that day approaching. How we got to come here together and sit together in heavenly places. Don't stay home. &gt;&gt; If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out to get in here to fellowship with your brothers. If you don't don't feel that way, then I tell you, it's time you got to praying cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exalted exorted us to to much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places and and and Christ Jesus and love one another. This will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for the other. That's right. Stay right together. Thank you, Lord, [music] that he encouraged the five-fold ministry and never told them to bury their preaching gifts in the ground and told them to keep preaching. And he was right behind them. &gt;&gt; Would we still be on fire and preach the gospel? Or is the time over? No, keep preaching. This is hard as you can preach, brother. Stay with it. I'm right behind you. Thank you that brother Ram did not claim his every word was infallible, but was humble and admitted he had mixups [music] and human mistakes on his tapes. &gt;&gt; Like the other day, I got something mixed up. I happened to hear it. It's I caught it right there and it's on the tape and I I probably hear from it. &gt;&gt; I just happened to say 700. I didn't mean just 700. I meant you I just didn't read it out of the scripture. It just come to my mind while I was talking and I just said 700 instead of 7,000. I make them mistakes all the time. I'm I'm a sure a dummy. So you forgive me. See, I didn't mean to do that. &gt;&gt; Thank you that he did not make [music] himself an idol as so many erroneously make him an idol today. &gt;&gt; If I make mistakes, you pray for me. I'm not infallible. I'm your brother. Thank you that he told us to listen carefully [music] to him to know when his human side was speaking versus when God was speaking through him because God [music] would say, "Thus sayaith the Lord." Did you prophesy that there be a million negroes uh killed on the or did you just announce that there [music] would be this happening? Now see, I've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to. [music] There's so much of it that it's just the human side. But always if there is something that goes forth, it will speak it. It's thus saith the Lord even to visions or anything. And that's the reason I say that not that there is any uh any prophecy concerning it. I have nothing on it from the Lord. [music] And be sure now if I say anything from the Lord like that to tell you it's always I'm speaking now. But when he speaks, I say it's not me. It's thus sayaeth the Lord. And I can't say it until he tells me. I could be alltogether wrong in my thought about Martin Luther King. I don't know. I can't say it. That's just my opinion. &gt;&gt; So today again, we thank you [music] for sending your prophet, brother William Brandham. and we will remember that he spoke in your holy name. &gt;&gt; But it's moving into that cycle. &gt;&gt; See, it's coming up close. So the thing for you to do is to remember that I speak to you in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Be prepared or you don't know what time something can happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's the second seal. You love me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's thus sayaeth the Lord. Praise be God. &gt;&gt; IF ALL THESE OTHER REVELATIONS and visions and everything has hit just exactly on the on the point. And how many knows that? Raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Everybody here with your hands up. That's right. So shall this be. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember &gt;&gt; it's so wonderful. &gt;&gt; Oh friend, &gt;&gt; come to the fountain that's filled with blood &gt;&gt; drawn from Emanuel's veins where sinners plunge beneath the blood lose all their guilty stains.
