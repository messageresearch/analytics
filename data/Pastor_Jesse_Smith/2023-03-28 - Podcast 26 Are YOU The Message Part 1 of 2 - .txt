TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your co-host Pastor Jesse Smith our other co-host brother amen wasn't available for this recording but I want to update you on his health he's doing much better by God's grace he went back to work yesterday and he and I are texting back and forth deciding on a subject that we can record together hopefully the next few weeks by God's grace so thank you for your prayers today's episode focuses on answering the question are you the message I believe the answer is no this episode originates from two recent sermons I listened to wherein prominent preachers told agreeing congregations that they were the message here's the outline for this podcast first we'll look at a message definition is essential second will Define the message third we'll look at bible uses of the word message fourth we'll look at four foundational quotes that help us Define the message and fifth we'll look at the written Epistles question foreign so the first section is a message definition is essential friends the following understanding or truths about what is the message are essential to abiding in the truth they're essential to staying in the middle of the road and that's what this podcast is about finding the truth within two dangerous fringes of those who follow brother branham's bible-based message if not understood correctly a message believer will likely Wander from the path of righteousness and walk on the dangerous fringes of the message which are first the dangerous Fringe of being a tape worshiper or a messenger worshiper and of course this is The Fringe of idolatry of brother Branham and idolatry of brother random's tapes and of course we see this movement in Jeffersonville Indiana today and all their followers which is very sad movement the second dangerous Fringe is preacher or self-worship and I call this the bride Pride group of preachers this is the group of preachers that call themselves The Greatest Christians of all time and last year I made a video about this quoting living preachers today constantly saying they are the greatest Christians of all time calling one another their Heroes and of course this is the same camp of preachers that told their congregants they are the message now two reasons this topic is so important is because number one we are commanded to understand and grow in understanding and judge all things and second the Antichrist spirit is so close it must be detected and exposed by the gift of discernment now regarding understanding twice Paul prayed for us to have all understanding in Colossians 1 verse 9. Paul said he did not cease to pray for the Colossians to the desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding and in second Timothy 2 verse 7 Paul wrote and the Lord give the understanding in all things and then twice Paul prayed for us to judge All Things First Corinthians 1 verse 10 Paul said it by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that should be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment in Philippians 1 verses 9 and 10 Paul prayed that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment and I think I'll add a third verse First Corinthians 2 verses 14 through 16 but focusing on verse 15 but he that is spiritual judgeth all things and as I close this section remember we must always look at the context of the quote from Brother Branham that we're studying and also the quotes from Brother Joseph Branham or myself or any other preacher and then we have to look at the words that follow after because Jesus said people's words will tell what is in their hearts according to Matthew 12 34 Jesus said for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh so again defining the message is essential to keep us in the middle of the road so we don't go into brother Branham worship nor go into worship of ourselves we're commanded to have more understanding constantly growing and understanding and judgment thank you in this second section let's define the message we must establish a basic definition for the word message and I'd like to use Webster's Dictionary just like brother Branham used Webster's dictionary to define his words such as for the word absolute in other words so Webster's Dictionary defines message as any notice word or communication written or verbal sent from one person to another now from this definition we apply in two contexts the first context is someone brought a word or message to us we get a message or word of God from a messenger about the current conditions we are not both the message and the receiver we are receivers only we are a separate person from the sender and then yet in a spiritual sense our souls have a portion of the sender Spirit after we are born again now the second context is now that brother random is gone we share God's message or word with others but we are not both the message which is the word and the sender we are not sending ourselves also brother Brown never said the words I am the message nor did he say you are the message when we look at the Bible Paul shared the message and the briens checked Paul's message with scripture that's found in Acts 17 11. these were more noble than those in thessalonica and that they received the word of God with all Readiness in mind and search the scriptures daily whether those things were so also in first Thessalonians 2 verse 13 Paul said the thessalonicans receive the word of God which he heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God I believe this false statement of you are the message is an attack on Holy Ghost reasoning and logic how can I be both the message between two persons and the receiver of the message I can't be both the statement of you are the message lacks intelligent reasoning language must keep its meaning I can become one with a message in my soul I can spread the message with my words I can carry the message in my hands when I'm carrying the Bible because the Bible is a physical form of the message but I'm never the full message itself friends if we say we are the message like these preachers are saying we are doing the same thing trinitarians do when they change the meaning of language with the word person let's listen to brother Rams say this from the church age book he said trinitarians change the meaning of the word person by calling God three persons let's listen to the quote they also state Bible is not person but on God Trinity it sure is how can three persons be in one God not only is there no Bible for it but it shows even a lack of intelligent reasoning three distinct persons though identical substance make three gods or language has lost its meaning entirely friends it's also necessary and interesting to see how the Bible uses the word message what is the message according to the Bible the Bible says we have to prove all things take every statement back to the word of God now I found two Bible verses about the message and it caused the message two things first it caused the message God is light and in him is no darkness and this reminds us of the scripture we must walk in the light of our day in first John chapter one and this definition is also in first John 1 verse 5 it says this then is the message which ye have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all and then the second definition of what the message is is also from First John 3 verse 11 it's love one another First John 3 11 says for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning that we should love one another so friends search it in your Bible the Bible never says you are the message and remember friends it's a sin to add to the word of God according to proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 and Revelation chapter 22 verses 18 and 19. one time wait a Minister's meeting on this very subject and when it was my turn to speak the first scripture I used was haggai 1 verse 13. it says then spake haggai the Lord's messenger in the Lord's message unto the people saying I'm with you saith the Lord now friends this is another beautiful Bible definition of the message all of God's prophetic word to Israel during the time of Haggin Zechariah was the Lord's message but haggai was one voice in The Lord's message and that's because Zechariah was also speaking in the Lord's message and this is what brother random tells us brother Branham of course was the main speaker of the message but then he said he was only one Pebble on the beach of the fivefold ministry and brother random said the bride has a voice the bride has to spread and share the message as well with her own voice let's listen to the quotes no brother Branham is it true that no one should preach but you we have seen your we have seen you are deemed man we do don't believe you would do that if there were not that they were not to preach Mercy brother sister ever who told you that nobody's preached with me you're not sure if you have four subjects of gods with all that no every manner that feels a call of God upon his life get into the ministry start preaching we need them man of God or anointed all over the world to preach the gospel see I'm just one little Pebble on the beach among many big stones for so there's just many there's more eligible more worthy more of anything to preach than me I'm just one little humble person laying out here I'm one grain of wheat in a whole Garner see so it's just uh you know what I mean any man is called a God he's the preacher gospel now in this next quote from the church age book brother Rams says the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost through the bride for the voice of God will be in her the bride yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation verse 17. the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first stage now here's two quotes where brother Branham says you become the voice of God when you get in contact with God and then every believer can be God's voice when possessed or filled with the spirit of God and to think that if you get into that content with God it becomes to it isn't your voice anymore is that your thought anymore it becomes God's thought and God's voice [Applause] you are just Divine or just the branch he's divine I and my father are one that tree all right [Music] here that is persist ENT self essential completely given over to his words they come like the words of Christ who speaks and the word is made flesh he speaks and the word is manifested the works that I do shall you do also be these signs shall follow them and believe before moving on let's go back to Webster's definition of the word message it's any notice word or communication written or verbal sent from one person to another so the sender of the message is the Lord Jesus Christ who sits upon his Heavenly Throne at the right hand of the Majesty on high Jesus sent his word or message to brother Branham brother Brandon received Jesus message and then was the messenger of the message or the bible promises God wanted to fulfill in this church age we are receivers of the message or brother random scriptures he preached and manifested to the people and here are two quotes that support this brother Ram said the scriptures tell what my message is and notice he didn't say the tapes now of course I know the tapes contain many great scriptures brother random preached but the reason I'm saying that is because voice of God says every word on tape is thus say the Lord we know that's not the truth the Press Play movement and tape churches are tape worshipers they idolize brother Branham and of course that's a sin here's the first quote from recognizing your day in its message search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life and they testify me and tell you what my message is if you can't believe me believe the very words that God's interpreted to you and the next quote is from a greater than Solomon is here brother Rams said his message is from the Bible and then he says it's not out of the Bible so notice again he didn't say my message is every word on the tape and you don't need the Bible he said his message is from the Bible let's listen to the quote I'm trying to bring this wonderful message of the grace of God that I know how to bring it it's the same message I've preached many years ago I haven't varied from it one inch because you can if I would have had to get out of the Bible see so it's from the Bible and I believe that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt a moments amen and Hebrews 13 8 says he's the same yesterday today and forever I believe that well friends will have to stop right here make this a part one of a series on asking the question are you the message so Lord willing next time we'll look at part four and five we'll look at four foundational quotes that help us Define the message and we'll also look at the question on written Epistles friends I'm really excited and I'm always thankful to defend this message that God gave to brother Branham and I know there are so many questions there are so many topics I'd like to cover there's just not enough hours in the day by God's grace but we know there's a time and season for everything and I just got to be patient and the Lord will help me bring out the truths that will Minister grace to the hearers so I'm purposely cutting this short so I can get this podcast out today I've just got a great burden to get content out because there's so many attacks on God's Bible message and God's Bible messenger brother Branham let's hope this is a blessing and thank you for your time thank you for downloading this and may the Lord Jesus Christ be with you now and always God bless you friends as the Holy Ghost anoints you to defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ as Paul also said in Philippians 1 verse 17 he said knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel [Music] of Jesus Christ [Music] same Jesus that was yesterday and will defeat today and forever never fail [Music]
