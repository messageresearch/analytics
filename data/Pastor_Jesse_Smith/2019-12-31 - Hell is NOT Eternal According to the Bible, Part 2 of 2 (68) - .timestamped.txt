[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] greetings friends in the Mattress name
[0:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:11] this video is to continue the series on
[0:13] hell is not eternal according to the
[0:16] Bible and examine Revelation 14 verses 8
[0:20] through 11 I was recently asked about
[0:22] this scripture and I apologize I did not
[0:25] address it on part 1 does revelation 14
[0:28] verse 11 teach those tormented for
[0:31] taking the mark of the beast suffer
[0:33] eternally the answer is no and I'll read
[0:36] the passage now and then provide
[0:38] biblical proof and there followed
[0:41] another angel saying Babylon is fallen
[0:43] is fallen that great city because she
[0:46] made all nations drink of the line of
[0:49] the wrath of her fornication and the
[0:52] third angel followed them saying with a
[0:53] loud voice if any man worship the Beast
[0:56] and His image and receive his mark in
[0:58] his forehead or in his hand the same
[1:01] shall drink of the wine of the wrath of
[1:03] God which is poured out without mixture
[1:05] into the cup of his indignation and he
[1:07] shall be tormented with fire and
[1:09] brimstone in the presence of the Holy
[1:12] Angels and in the presence of the Lamb
[1:14] and the smoke of their torment ascendeth
[1:17] up forever and ever and they have no
[1:20] rest day nor night who worship the Beast
[1:22] and His image and whosoever receiveth
[1:25] the mark of his name those who believe
[1:28] in eternal torment seem to misunderstand
[1:30] the phrase in verse 11 that says and
[1:33] they have no rest day or night who
[1:35] worship the Beast and His name this
[1:39] verse does not say they are tormented
[1:41] for eternity without end so we cannot
[1:44] add that to the text it simply says the
[1:47] tormented ones have no rest day or night
[1:49] but it does not say how long this
[1:52] torment lasts we cannot add to the Bible
[1:55] nor take away from it for God will call
[1:58] us liars if we do according to proverbs
[2:00] 35 and 6 every word of God is pure he is
[2:05] a shield unto them that put their trust
[2:06] in him add though not unto his words
[2:09] lest he reprove thee and thou be found a
[2:12] liar
[2:14] revelation 14:11 can only be understood
[2:17] or rightly divided and interpreted
[2:20] correctly using other scriptures not by
[2:23] adding our own thoughts unbelievers do
[2:27] not have eternal life and therefore
[2:29] cannot burn for an eternity for other
[2:33] scriptures that help us realize that no
[2:35] rest day or night is not eternal torment
[2:38] our two pairs of scriptures first John
[2:41] 3:15 and Revelation 21 verse 8 and
[2:45] revelation 13:8 and 17:8 beginning with
[2:51] first John 3:15 you learn the undeniable
[2:54] principle that unbelievers do not have
[2:56] eternal life and therefore cannot burn
[2:59] for an eternity
[3:00] first John 3:15 says who suffer hate of
[3:04] his brother is a murderer
[3:06] and he know that no murderer hath
[3:08] eternal life abiding in him if a
[3:12] murderer does not have eternal life he
[3:14] cannot burn eternally
[3:18] revelation 21:8 then lists other groups
[3:21] of sinners along with murderers who
[3:24] cannot have eternal life and I'll burn
[3:26] with fire and brimstone
[3:30] but the fearful and unbelieving and the
[3:33] abominable and murderers and
[3:34] whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters
[3:38] and all Liars shall have their part in
[3:41] the lake which burneth with fire and
[3:43] brimstone which is the second death
[3:46] hopefully now you can see that murders
[3:49] fearful unbelieving abominable
[3:51] whoremongers sorcerers idolaters and all
[3:55] liars
[3:56] do not have eternal life and cannot be
[3:58] tormented for eternity the torment
[4:02] spoken in Revelation 14 11 may last a
[4:06] long time perhaps thousands of years or
[4:08] longer but it will not last eternally
[4:11] because they don't have eternal life
[4:13] abiding in their souls the other two
[4:17] scriptures that prove torment is not
[4:19] eternal our revelation 13:8 and 17:8
[4:22] which said the names of the worshipers
[4:25] of the beasts which is the evil spirit
[4:27] of Rome and it's false sister churches
[4:29] are not in the book of life the book of
[4:33] life is the book of eternal life so
[4:35] again the torment of sinners cannot last
[4:38] eternally because their names are not on
[4:41] the book that lists those who possess
[4:43] eternal life revelation 13:8 and all
[4:48] that dwell upon the earth shall worship
[4:49] Him whose names are not written in the
[4:51] book of life of the lamb slain from the
[4:54] foundation of the world revelation 17:8
[4:58] the Beast that thou sawest was and is
[5:00] not and shall ascend out of the
[5:02] bottomless pit and go into perdition and
[5:05] they that dwell on the earth shall
[5:07] wonder whose names were not written in
[5:09] the book of life from the foundation of
[5:12] the world when they behold the Beast
[5:14] that was and is not and yet is
[5:20] next God is fair and just one person
[5:24] questioned my statement from part one
[5:26] that said God is too merciful to torment
[5:28] unbelievers eternally without end but I
[5:33] stand by this statement because God's
[5:34] punishments always fit the crime
[5:37] God's punishments were never excessive
[5:40] in the past and they will not be
[5:42] excessive in the future God proves the
[5:45] i4i principle Exodus 21:24
[5:48] I for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand
[5:51] foot for foot God is a fair judge God
[5:55] will not announce unending punishment
[5:57] for only 100 years or so of sin that is
[6:01] not a fair recompense Hebrews chapter 2
[6:04] verses 2 & 3 say for if the word spoken
[6:07] by Angels was steadfast and every
[6:10] transgression and disobedience received
[6:13] a just recompense of reward how shall we
[6:17] escape if we neglect so great salvation
[6:20] notice every transgression and
[6:22] disobedience received a just recompense
[6:24] of reward Romans 9 14 says what shall we
[6:29] say then is there unrighteousness with
[6:31] God god forbid isaiah 45:21 says tell ye
[6:37] and bring them near yay let them take
[6:40] counsel together who hath declare this
[6:42] from ancient time who hath told it from
[6:44] that time have not I the Lord and there
[6:47] is no God else beside me a just God and
[6:51] a savior there is none beside me
[6:57] remember that unbelievers will have an
[6:59] ending point second Peter 2:12 says
[7:02] sinners are made to be taken and
[7:05] destroyed which means they will come to
[7:07] destruction Jesus teaches the same
[7:10] destruction in Matthew 10:28 saying fear
[7:13] him which is able to destroy both soul
[7:16] and body in hell Satan has an ending
[7:20] point and will be no more according to
[7:22] Ezekiel 28 1980 and never shalt thou be
[7:28] any more Malachi 4 verses one through
[7:32] three describes the judgment of sinners
[7:34] following the Battle of Armageddon
[7:36] sinners are left with neither root nor
[7:38] branch in closing I hope you now
[7:43] understand revelation 14:11 in light of
[7:46] the rest of the scripture please text or
[7:49] email me with any other questions or
[7:51] concerns
[7:53] god bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[7:56] the desire of your heart
