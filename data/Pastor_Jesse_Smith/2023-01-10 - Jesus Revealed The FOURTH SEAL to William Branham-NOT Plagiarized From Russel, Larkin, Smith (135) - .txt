TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to prove hopefully by God's grace for once and for all that brother Branham received the revelation of the foreseal from the Lord Jesus Christ and he did not plagiarize it from Charles Tay's Russell Clarence Larkin Noah Uriah Smith as this video will show there are seven differences between brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell on the fourth seal alone now if you're keeping track in this series these seven differences combined with the 19 differences between brother Branham and Charles Hayes Russell on the first three seals make a total of 26 differences on the first four seals between God's Prophet brother Branham and the false prophet Charles Tays Russell before beginning the fourth seal let's look at three comments from people criticizing brother Branham and have supported brother Bran's accusers who falsely claim brother Branham plagiarized the Seven Seals so these three comments are from brotherbraham's accusers video about the so-called theft of the four seal and of course as we'll prove in this video brother Branham got the revelation of the force seal from the Lord Jesus Christ and not Charles Tay's Russell these three comments on the theft of the four seal video prove how easily people are deceived who leave this message these deceived people who speak against the message do not even do any research and they don't even follow up on the research done by the so-called leaders of the movement to leave the message that God gave to his Prophet brother Branham the first two comments say quote thank you excellent end quote and quote nice video end quote the third comment says quote ladies and gentlemen Tays Russell is the one revealing to William Marin Branham day by day not hard to see amazing series end quote I'm pointing out these three comments because it shows how deceived these accusers of brother Branham are they call the research excellent nice and amazing and yet as we'll show now this video on the four seal only quoted less than two sentences out of the nearly four pages that Charles Tays Russell wrote about the fourth seal here's a screenshot of the nearly four pages Charles Hayes Russell wrote about the fourth seal highlighted in blue is the portion on the fourth seal in yellow you can see the portion of Russell's work that brother Ryan's accusers actually use on their video these three individuals praising the theft of the four seal video are clearly delusional and greatly deceived because they never studied Russell's Force seal for themselves and along with that they never studied brother Ram's Force seal to know the difference between Charles Tay's Russell and brother Branham how can this so-called research be amazing when this research leaves out the seven differences between brother Branham and Charles Tay's Russell and jumps to a false conclusion that brother Branham plagiarized Charles Tays Russell off of less than two sentences of Russell's research how can the so-called research be amazing when it ignores the two hour and 25-minute sermon brother Brandon preached about the fourth seal so the conclusion about the theft of the four seal video and the comments from these three individuals is that they have answered a matter before they actually heard it Folly and shame unto them according to Proverbs 18 verse 13. they've answered the force seal matter before honestly looking at the four pages Russell wrote about the fourth seal they've answered the four seal matter and ignoring the two hour and 25-minute sermon brother Brandon preached about the fourth seal and it makes us question whether these people are righteous or not because the Bible says in Proverbs 15 28 the heart of the righteous studieth to answer but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things how can the author of this series on the theft of the Seven Seals and all these commenters be righteous when they have ignored the first 26 differences between Charles Tay's Russell and brother Branham on the first four seals only God knows friends God is the only one who knows their hearts God will be the judge whether or not their souls are righteous because they've answered a matter before they've heard it and they have not studied this matter out fully may God have mercy on these accusers and again may the Lord Jesus Christ have mercy upon these accusers and guide them to full repentance let's begin with the accusation about the fourth seal one accuser of brother Branham said quote not surprisingly after copying the first three seals from Charles Hayes Russell we again see William branham's Revelation is identical to Russell's end quote and this accuser brother Branham made a two minute and 20 second video about the fourth seal and of course that amount of time is not sufficient to cover all the details of the force seal that both brother Branham taught and Charles Tay's Russell taught now we'll see how their teachings were not identical and brother Ram's accusers are either purposely slandering brother Branham or incredibly shoddy and weak researchers with little to no understanding of what brother Branham actually taught about the fourth seal let's begin with William Branham and Charles Tays Russell see here's a screenshot of the so-called proof that brother Ram's accusers used to show how he apparently stole the force seal they quoted Charles Hayes Russell's book The finished Mystery by saying quote and when he had opened the fourth seal still the same Rider the papacy end quote and then they showed how brother Brown said quote and John went to see and he saw a Pale Horse and again the same Rider upon this Pale Horse now he has a name called Death end quote and that was brother Branham from the fourth seal so did Brother Braham say it was the same writer yes but it was only a partial agreement with Russell as there were seven more details about the fourth seal that the accusers ignored to their own shame here's a screenshot of the nearly four pages Charles Hayes Russell wrote about the fourth seal from Pages 114 to 117 highlighted in blue is the portion on the fourth seal in yellow you can see the portion of Russell's work that brother Ryan's accusers actually use on their video again it's such an extremely small amount of information from Charles stage Russell about the fourth seal it doesn't fully represent Russell's teachings on the fourth seal again I'm not the judge of a person's heart but here it looks like brother end's accusers purposely left out all this information in order to slander God's Prophet brother Branham but thankfully the elect of God cannot be deceived by such shoddy weak and limited research so let's begin with the first difference between brother Branham and Russell the first difference is the timing Russell said the timing of the four seal was quote pre-reformation period end quote and it was likely from 1160 to 1516. and here's a screenshot of Russell's quote about the pre-reformation period regarding the force seal Russell said quote an app description of its Chief claim to recognition During the pre-reformation period end quote this timing was completely different from Brother Branham brother Bram said the timing of the four seal was from quote the last age end quote until the time when the Antichrist or beast takes his quote Last Ride end quote into Perdition or the battle of Armageddon at the end of Daniel's 70th week so here's a visual of Russell's timing versus brother Brown's timing notice there's a difference of over 700 years between the start time of Russell's four seal and the start time of brother branham's for seal and also notice there's over a 400 year difference between the end time of Russell's Force seal and of course brother Brandon's Force seal ends at the end of the tribulation period which the tribulation period hasn't started yet so any honest humble person will recognize that these two men's teachings were not identical as brother Ram's accuser said How can any honest person say these are identical teachings the second difference is the Pale Horse Russell said The Pale Horse was quote the ghastly and horrible teachings that God's people must be exterminated end quote in the pre-reformation period and he also said quote the ghastly green of Terror and of death end quote this is not what brother random taught brother Branham said The Pale Horse represented quote political and and religious and and demon powers mixed together end quote so again their teachings on The Pale Horse were not identical Russell's teaching was that the Pale Horse was ghastly teachings During the pre-reformation period and brother Branham said it was the demon powers mixed together writing from 1906 which was the start of the last Church age all the way to the end of Daniel's 70th week in the Great Tribulation period the third difference was the writer I mentioned this earlier and this is the one detail brother man's accuser used on his video Russell said quote still the same writer the papacy end quote and brother Brown did say quote same Rider upon this Pale Horse end quote now they're partially the same but not fully they're different because Russell said it was the papacy During the pre-reformation period but brother random shows us how the combined demon powers come into one man the Antichrist person or the person of the Beast and this Antichrist person or beast makes a covenant with Israel for seven years but breaks the Covenant in the midst of the year and then takes his final ride into Perdition at the battle of Armageddon against Jesus Christ and during that battle the Antichrist himself or beast is cast alive into the Lake of Fire and of course Charles Russell did not teach this he said it was pre-reformation papacy so again these teachings are not identical the fourth difference is the Beast Russell said the fourth Beast or Eagle was quote Infinite Wisdom end quote brother random taught different brother Branham said the Beast was quote in the eagle age the last age the prophetic age where there is to rise prophetic utterancy to whom the secrets always come now to wind up all these Mysteries God has promised that there would be a genuine Elijah rise some man Anointed with that spirit and it would reveal he promised it in Malachi 4 end quote so brother Brown tells us the eagle Beast is the prophetic Ministry that God gave to him of course Russell didn't say that infinite wisdom is not identical to a prophetic anointing on the Malachi for Prophet to the Gentiles so that's the fourth proof brother Brown did not plagiarize and teach identical to Charles Tay's Russell the fifth detail was death Russell said death was quote same writer the papacy end quote and gave an example of Pope Innocent III's two decade-long holy crusade in which he had half a million men fighting for him and Russell showed in 1209 that an estimated one hundred thousand albigensis died in one day so Russell teaches that death was the papacy killing through the Crusades brother Branham did not teach that regarding the force seal brother Branham said death was quote the anti he's death because the word is life as an antichrist he was death to begin with Antichrist false prophet Beast end quote so brother Branham taught death was the same Antichrist spirit that had been working against the church since the beginning of the New Testament the book of Acts and now the Antichrist Spirit of death was going to work through this last Church age later see in church age and then be headed up in the person of the Antichrist or the Beast which we know will be a future Pope and will kill both with natural death and spiritual death but of course spiritual death being the worst so any honest person can see how these two teachings are not identical Russell said death was the papacy through the Crusades and brother Branham said it was death or spiritual and natural during the laodicean church age and also into the Great Tribulation period the sixth detail is Hell Followed him in his book Russell gave a Bible study showing how death and the grave were equal and said hell does not last forever quoting Revelation 20 verse 13. now those are true teachings but Russell said Jonah went to hell but came out of hell Russell said quote yet there are at least two persons in history who have been in hell and come out of hell one is Jonah who prayed in hell and was delivered from Hell Jonah 2 verse 2 end quote of course brother Brandon did not teach that Jonah went to hell so these teachings are not identical while it's true brother random taught that hell does not last forever which the Bible teaches brother Branham had the true Revelation about hell not being Eternal he said quote when the natural man dies hell follows him that's the grave Hades see that's in the natural but in the spiritual it's a lake of fire Eternal separation from God end quote so again we see how Russell had some understanding but not a complete understanding of hell and so this is the sixth proof that the teachings of brother Branham and Charles Tay's Russell on the fourth seal were not identical and the seventh and final difference between brother Branham and Charles Hayes Russell on the fourth seal was power over a fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and beasts regarding this Russell said quote to his Holiness the pope all the Cardinals inquisitors over Europe not over Asia Africa or America end quote so notice Russell said it was death over Europe but not Asia Africa or America during the pre-reformation period so Russell cut the world into four parts during the pre-reformation period and said the papacy would ride over only one-fourth of the Earth this is not what brother Branham taught brother Branham quoted Revelation 19 verse 17 and said this power over a fourth part of the Earth was the battle of Armageddon so in the four seal brother bran cited Revelation 19 verse 17 quote and I saw an angel standing in the Sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the files of the air in the midst of Heaven Come and gather yourselves together to the supper of the great God he feeds them to the beasts and Birds now watch over here in the other chapter here of the Book of Revelations and just a minute killed with the sword and death and beast of the earth see the Jezebel Church her actually body is to be eaten by fouls and beasts of the earth just exactly like Ahab and Jezebel was in the natural so are they to be in the spiritual form of a church do you see what I mean end quote brother Brown said it was The Pale Horse Gathering the people from the four corners of the Earth to the battle of Armageddon he said quote and watch from corner from the four corners of the earth they gather them gathers them to Armageddon the Bible says end quote so Russell said only Europe brother Branham said what the Bible said that the pale horse rider gathered armies from the four corners of the Earth but then Jesus Christ would destroy them with the sword of the word of his mouth in Revelation chapter 19 proving the end of The Jezebel Church would be exactly like it was for the end of Jezebel in the natural so in summary brother Brandon did not plagiarize Charles Tays Russell these seven differences prove brother Branham did not teach identical to Charles Tay's Russell and sadly approves brother Ram's accuser did not study before he answered the matter of the fourth seal but by God's grace we'll pray for him and his followers at the end of the video now just for good measure let's show how brother Ram did not plagiarize Clarence Larkin on the fourth seal so here's a screenshot of Larkin's writing about the fourth seal and of course the timing of his four seal is during the tribulation period he said quote the reference here is clearly to some great pestilence that shall come upon the Earth after a devastating War followed by famine during which the dead are left unburied a pestilence is sure to follow the fourth part of the earth over which the pestilence shall sweep will probably be that part of the Eastern Hemisphere covered by the revived Roman Empire see map of the old Roman Empire end quote so Larkin places the force heel right after the third seal remember the third seal he said was some great War during the Great Tribulation period so the timing of brother Bynum and Larkin are not identical brother Ram's four seal started in 1906 the last age he said and his fourth seal ends at the end of Daniel's 70th week or the end of the Great Tribulation period this is different from Larkin Larkin's Force seal is sometime during the Great Tribulation period notice Larkin never mentioned the battle of Armageddon in his Force seal teaching like brother Branham did so again we can see Larkin and brother Brandon were not identical and again for good measure let's compare brother Branham and Uriah Smith the timing of Uriah Smith's Force seal was from 538 A.D to the time of the reformers Uriah Smith said quote it must refer to the time in which the papacy bore its unrebuked unrestrained and persecuting rule commencing about ad538 and extending to the time when the reformers commenced their work of exposing the Corruptions of the papal systems end quote so here's a visual showing the difference between brother Branham and Uriah Smith are the Rams Force seal started over 1 400 years after Uriah Smith's Forest seal started and brother Ram's Force seal hasn't ended yet in closing friends I hope this four seal video has been a blessing to you again it proves beyond the shadow of a doubt brother Bram did not teach identical to Charles Tay's Russell Clarence Larkin nor Uriah Smith so as Bible Believers we remain grateful that the Holy Ghost revealed these truths to his servant his Prophet brother William Branham we've now seen 26 differences between brother brahm's first four seals compared to Charles Tay's Russell's Clarence Larkin and Uriah Smith's first four seals we're grateful the elect cannot be deceived so let's have a word of prayer for brother Graham's accusers that they'll humble themselves recognize true research recognize the truth of this situation and repent of all their misrepresentations of brother Branham Heavenly Father we thank you for the grace of God expressed to us through the Lord Jesus Christ thank you for the cross the Forgiveness of sins the resurrection and the sending of the Holy Ghost we thank you that the Holy Ghost is here to guide us into all truth thank you that the Holy Ghost gives us a heart to answer a matter to study a matter out honestly so we thank you for the truth of the Holy Ghost in This Day regarding these first four seals Lord Jesus I pray your spirit would come upon brother Ram's accusers regarding this subject and they'll repent of their misrepresentations the repent of their insufficient research and they will publicly recant all their misrepresentations Lord your scripture says With God all things are possible so I pray God if it be possible if these people will humble themselves I pray God you would allow it to come to pass use this video and other people's videos in order to convict them of their misrepresentations and their false teachings Lord Jesus we ask for your mercy to be upon these accusers God may they humble themselves and acknowledge the spirit of Truth we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
