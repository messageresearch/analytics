[0:44] yundum flash the lights back a
[0:46] supernatural light the dream was

[1:18] want to make it right let's make it
[1:20] right
[1:21] now don't wait tillor maybe too late
[1:23] let's do it now now I said surely
[1:26] there's something in this word of God
[1:28] from Genesis and Revelations that some
[1:30] character in there that you dealt with
[1:34] would be on the same basis that would be
[1:36] my question if somebody done something
[1:38] and and you got to ask him about it now
[1:40] let me turn to that place in the Bible
[1:42] and if somebody whatever they' done and
[1:45] lean my way where I've done wrong or
[1:48] something you want me to do or haven't
[1:49] done let me see some character in The
[1:51] Bible like can I close my eyes just let
[1:54] the Bible fall off and put my finger on
[1:55] the scripture Genesis
[1:58] 24:7 El EA are Abraham's faithful
[2:02] servant the model servant of the Bible
[2:04] being sent to hunt the
[2:07] bride for Isaac chills run over
[2:11] me sure that's my that's right with the
[2:14] rest of my message pulling out the bride
[2:16] he said swear that you will not take a
[2:18] bride out of these but go to my own
[2:21] people he said what if the woman won't
[2:23] come with me said then you're free of
[2:24] this
[2:25] old he said and the god well of heaven
[2:30] will send his Angel before you to direct
[2:33] you he went right straight out begin
[2:35] praying and he met the beautiful Rebecca
[2:38] that become the Bride of Isaac just a
[2:42] perfect message back to the
[2:44] word go get that
[2:46] bride that's a duty that's what I'm here

[3:10] keep that ride and step hunt that man I
[3:13] said God I'm going back home renew my
[3:15] bows again and start out a new so that's
[3:17] what we're planning on doing that's what

[6:28] speak to him a moment Lord
[6:30] Jesus we are we are certainly a blessed
[6:35] people above our
[6:38] thinking above our
[6:40] understanding for if there was a noble
[6:44] among us such as uh some uh Personnel
[6:48] from some other country or Diplomat of
[6:50] some sort we think it was great to have
[6:53] such a noble person among us but today
[6:56] we have the god of
[6:58] Heaven
[7:00] not only among us but in US dwelling
[7:03] living his life through us and we're so
[7:06] thankful far this Lord is beyond our
[7:09] understanding of course but now speaking

[7:27] make that Vision fulfilled
[7:30] so thy will be done we've committed this
[7:33] way the best of our understanding so we
[7:34] pray Lord if there's anything contrary
[7:36] to your will you'll make it known to us
[7:38] that we might know to do your perfect
[7:40] will now bless us in these next few
