[0:02] revelation chapters 2 & 3
[0:06] the theme of both chapters is the
[0:09] spirits words of encouragement warning
[0:11] and rebuke to the seven Gentile churches
[0:15] please recall that the teaching on these
[0:18] chapters were thus saith the Lord
[0:20] according to God's prophet William
[0:22] Branham now the vision plus the word
[0:26] plus the history plus the church ages
[0:29] and all blend together so I could truly
[0:33] say that to the best of my understanding
[0:35] and according to the Word of God and the
[0:39] vision and the revelation the
[0:41] interpretation thereof is thus saith the
[0:44] law
[0:46] the timing of events in these chapters
[0:48] are seen here as each of the seven
[0:51] churches was actually a specific time
[0:53] period each of the seven Gentile cities
[0:56] named by Christ had characteristics
[0:58] about it that were prophetic of the
[1:01] future years and ages that would
[1:03] continue until God was done dealing with
[1:06] the Gentile people for salvation Jesus
[1:10] spoke of this time period as the times
[1:12] of the Gentiles in Luke 21:24 the
[1:15] Gentiles are currently grafted into the
[1:17] life of God the Holy Ghost covenant as
[1:20] the Jews were broken off from the holy
[1:22] ghost' covenant when they rejected
[1:24] Christ as their Messiah see the entire
[1:26] chapter of Romans 11 Israel will be
[1:29] blind to Christ as their Messiah until
[1:32] the last Gentile believer is born into
[1:35] the body of Christ and then the 144,000
[1:38] Israeli believers will be saved after
[1:41] recognizing Jesus Christ as their
[1:43] Messiah Redeemer and Lord
[1:47] the Ephesian Church age was from 53 to
[1:50] 170 AD and it's angel human messenger
[1:54] was Saint Paul the Sumerian church age
[1:57] was from 170 to 312 ad and it's
[2:00] messenger was Saint Irenaeus the
[2:03] pergamene church age was from 312 to 606
[2:06] ad and it's messenger was Saint Martin
[2:09] the Thyatira in church aids was from 606
[2:12] to 1520 ad and it's messenger was Saint
[2:16] Columba the sardian church age was from
[2:19] 1520 to 1750 ad and it's messenger was
[2:24] Martin Luther the Philadelphian church
[2:27] age was from 1750 to 1906 ad and it's
[2:32] messenger was John Wesley the Laodicean
[2:36] Church age was from 1906 to the current
[2:39] time AD and is still ongoing and it's
[2:42] messenger was William Branham the
[2:46] symbols and key revelations in these
[2:48] chapters are numerous so we will only
[2:50] have time to teach some of them
[2:53] we strongly encourage you to listen to
[2:55] or read the book an exposition of the
[2:58] seven church ages written by William
[3:00] Branham in 1965 this book covers all the
[3:03] symbols and key revelations from these
[3:05] two chapters we begin with the key
[3:08] revelation of the overcomers Jesus spoke
[3:12] directly to each Gentile age and
[3:14] admonished them to be overcomers or
[3:17] conquerors over Satan's false religions
[3:20] the overcomers are those who took
[3:22] Jesus's words of truth and live them
[3:25] overcoming the temptations of Satan the
[3:28] false prophet or Antichrist the Beast
[3:31] and even death and hell these overcomers
[3:34] are the called the chosen and the
[3:37] faithful they are the wife or bride of
[3:40] Jesus Christ every overcomer from every
[3:43] age will inherit all the same things
[3:45] meaning they will inherit all seven
[3:48] rewards that Jesus listed in each church
[3:50] age here are the rewards for the
[3:53] overcomers during the times of the
[3:55] Gentiles the reward of eating of the
[3:58] Tree of Life will be a spiritual
[4:00] partaking of the words of life for there
[4:02] is only one life and that is eternal
[4:05] life from the person of life Jesus
[4:07] Christ the reward of not being hurt of
[4:10] the second death will mean that
[4:12] overcomers will not be cast into the
[4:14] lake of fire but will instead live with
[4:17] Christ in world without end
[4:19] all those cast in the lake of fire will
[4:21] be hurt and tormented for a very long
[4:23] time but not for eternity for sinners do
[4:26] not have eternal life so they cannot be
[4:28] punished for eternity at some point all
[4:31] those in the lake of fire will be
[4:33] annihilated and will cease to exist the
[4:36] reward of eating the hidden manna will
[4:38] be Christ revealing more of himself and
[4:41] his word as he will answer all of our
[4:43] unanswered questions for he is our manna
[4:46] or bread of life Christ will feed his
[4:49] children throughout eternity in a very
[4:51] personal way which was symbolized in the
[4:54] Old Testament by the hidden manna that
[4:56] God had Moses stored up in the Ark of
[4:58] the Covenant which was only visited once
[5:00] a year by one man
[5:02] the high priest the reward of the white
[5:05] stone with a new
[5:07] name inside of it will be the personal
[5:09] revelation of our true and original
[5:11] names that were written on the Lamb's
[5:13] Book of Life from the foundation of the
[5:16] world once we are face-to-face with
[5:18] Christ our new names will be made known
[5:21] to us as st. Paul wrote that he would
[5:23] know even as also I am known
[5:26] the reward of the power to rule over
[5:28] Nations will be the reward for Holy
[5:31] Ghost filled believers to physically
[5:33] rule and reign over the nations of the
[5:35] earth possibly during the 1000 year
[5:38] millennial reign with Christ upon the
[5:40] earth and also during the new age the
[5:43] new heavens and earth as spoken of in
[5:45] Revelation 21 verses 24 to 26 the Holy
[5:50] Ghost filled believers earn this right
[5:51] to rule because they allowed the Holy
[5:54] Spirit to teach them to rule over sin
[5:56] and temptation on earth during their
[5:59] earthly lives the reward of the morning
[6:02] star will be Jesus's personal presence
[6:05] that will illuminate the future Kingdom
[6:07] which will be so glorious that the Sun
[6:10] will not be needed anymore the reward of
[6:13] white raiment will be the shining
[6:15] exceeding white garments the Saints will
[6:17] wear which represents the righteousness
[6:20] of Jesus Christ the reward of the names
[6:23] of overcomers not being blotted out of
[6:25] the book of life means just that their
[6:29] names will not be blotted out of the
[6:30] book of life because they did not betray
[6:33] Christ and sell him out as Judas did in
[6:36] his transgression nor did they commit
[6:39] idolatry like the tribes of Dan and
[6:41] Ephraim and thus had the names of their
[6:43] tribes blotted out from under heaven the
[6:47] reward of being made a pillar in the
[6:49] temple of God means that overcomers will
[6:51] be given a permanent physical place near
[6:54] Jesus Christ for they will ever be with
[6:56] the Lord
[6:57] sharing the throne with him at his
[7:00] request
[7:02] as the physical body of Jesus will be
[7:04] the temple of God in the new heavens and
[7:06] new earth another reward will be that
[7:10] Christ will write upon the overcomer his
[7:12] own true name which has not yet been
[7:15] revealed and the city name of the New
[7:17] Jerusalem because in a marriage
[7:19] relationship the woman the church always
[7:22] takes the name of the man the husband
[7:24] which is Christ Jesus in our case the
[7:28] reward of sitting with Jesus in his
[7:30] throne will be the highest compliment
[7:32] ever paid to the humble steadfast group
[7:35] of Holy Ghost field Christians for Jesus
[7:38] will share his throne with his bride who
[7:41] he will use to help judge the world at
[7:43] the great white throne judgment this
[7:46] concludes the rewards for the overcomers
[7:50] symbols related to Jesus include the key
[7:53] of David the open door and the hour of
[7:55] temptation the key of David is symbolic
[8:00] of Christ's power to open and shut
[8:02] salvation as Jesus is the door to
[8:04] salvation the fact that the key is on
[8:07] his shoulder is symbolic of the Hebrew
[8:09] wedding ceremony as the bride's veil was
[8:12] placed upon the groom's shoulder this is
[8:14] symbolic of the fact that in Jesus's
[8:16] marriage Jesus as husband has full
[8:19] dominion over his bride the Gentile
[8:21] church and he alone bears the
[8:23] responsibility and care for the church
[8:25] with the key of David Jesus only has the
[8:29] key to open the hearts of the four
[8:31] ordained believers who will be in his
[8:33] bride Jesus the son of David will bring
[8:36] his Gentile bride to the 1000 year
[8:38] millennial reign of peace which is the
[8:41] anti-type of the peaceful reign of
[8:42] Solomon the son of David Jesus at the
[8:46] open door during the Philadelphian
[8:49] church age which lasted from 1750 to
[8:51] 1906 which was symbolic of the greatest
[8:55] age of missionary work in history as
[8:57] missionaries abounded and the word of
[9:00] Christ spread all over the world this
[9:02] great labor of brotherly love could only
[9:04] be done by Christ's own love
[9:08] the hour of temptation is a key
[9:10] revelation for it is the time during the
[9:13] tribulation period that everyone on the
[9:15] face of the earth will be forced to
[9:17] decide if they will take the mark of the
[9:19] beast as taught in Revelation chapter 13
[9:22] verses 11 to 18 jesus promised the
[9:25] believers of the philadelphia and church
[9:26] age that they would be kept from this
[9:28] tribulation period because they
[9:30] patiently kept the words of Christ and
[9:32] we know this promise of Christ carries
[9:35] over now to the final and last year
[9:37] chage the Laodicean Church age
[9:41] symbols not directly referring to Christ
[9:44] are the seven angels Jezebel nor
[9:47] children and Satan seat concerning the
[9:51] seven angels we need to know that these
[9:53] seven angels are symbolic of earthly
[9:55] human messengers or preachers as
[9:58] mentioned earlier in Chapter 1 Jezebel
[10:01] mentioned revelation 2:10 is symbolic of
[10:04] the Roman Catholic Church for the evil
[10:06] spirit in that church controls or
[10:09] dominates the people by her own will and
[10:11] not the will of God which is the Word of
[10:13] God
[10:14] Jesus plainly taught how this spirit of
[10:16] Jezebel came to be it began with the
[10:19] deeds of the Nicolaitans which were
[10:21] seemingly harmless traditions of men
[10:23] that later turned into unbending false
[10:25] doctrines such as infant baptisms
[10:28] priestly celibacy praying to dead Saints
[10:32] worshiping statues and so forth then
[10:36] enter the doctrine of balaam which
[10:38] symbolized when the Emperor Constantine
[10:40] United Church and state just as Balaam
[10:43] United Israel with beoh peor in numbers
[10:46] chapter 25 the uniting of the Roman
[10:48] Church and the Roman state paved the way
[10:51] for the nearly 1,000 year dark or Middle
[10:54] Ages period in which the Jezebel
[10:56] teaching through her papal powers
[10:58] greatly controlled and defiled many
[11:01] souls through indulgences idolatry
[11:04] Crusades and the Inquisition the
[11:08] children of Jezebel or the Roman
[11:10] Catholic Church would then be all the
[11:12] denominations and independent churches
[11:14] that came after the mother church who
[11:17] share in her false doctrines such as the
[11:20] Trinity of three gods or persons and
[11:23] also any church that denies the Bible
[11:26] truth of one person in the Godhead full
[11:29] immersion in water when baptizing using
[11:32] the literal name of the Lord Jesus
[11:33] Christ and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[11:36] in the soul of man just to name a few
[11:39] the peoples of the earth who partake of
[11:41] her adultery or false doctrine will be
[11:44] cast into the bed of the Great
[11:45] Tribulation Period her children or
[11:48] churches who follow the mother's
[11:50] doctrine will be killed with death which
[11:52] is spiritual death the
[11:54] fourth and final horse rider who rides
[11:56] during the Tribulation Period as taught
[11:58] in Revelation chapter 6 verses 7 & 8
[12:02] Satan C is the physical headquarters of
[12:05] his earthly kingdom which began in
[12:08] ancient Babylon or modern-day Iraq later
[12:11] Jesus said Satan seat moved to the city
[12:13] of Pergamos during the pergamene church
[12:15] age that lasted from 312 to 606 then
[12:20] Satan found his final seat which is Rome
[12:22] the city that sits on seven hills or
[12:25] mountains where Satan still sits today a
[12:29] final revelation from these chapters is
[12:32] that you and I must recognize the age
[12:34] that we are living in right now the
[12:36] Laodicean Church age which began in 1906
[12:40] and continues today if you have the
[12:43] revelation of the age you are living in
[12:45] then you can be an overcomer through the
[12:47] power of the Holy Ghost today we must
[12:50] overcome a lukewarm spiritual condition
[12:52] which is a life that fluctuates between
[12:55] serving the world and serving Christ
[12:57] ultimately a lukewarm life will reject
[13:00] the perfect will of God and will do
[13:02] works of sin or iniquity at times while
[13:05] at other times will do works for God
[13:07] under the anointing of the genuine Holy
[13:09] Spirit the lukewarm church member today
[13:12] according to Jesus feels rich has plenty
[13:16] of goods and does not feel a need for
[13:19] more of God yet Jesus says that kind of
[13:22] attitude makes the lukewarm church
[13:24] member wretched miserable poor blind and
[13:28] naked Jesus gives the most bitter
[13:31] denunciation to the lukewarm Church due
[13:34] to their pride in arrogance for wanting
[13:36] church membership rather than the
[13:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost because of
[13:41] their pride Christ said he would spew
[13:43] out the lukewarm churches from his mouth
[13:45] meaning they will no longer speak for
[13:48] him they will no longer be his
[13:50] mouthpiece and speak with thus saith the
[13:52] Lord
[13:54] Jesus went on to teach what a hot or
[13:56] spirit-filled life consists of first a
[13:59] real believer today will be rich in
[14:01] faith for their faith will be tested
[14:03] like gold tried in the fire of
[14:05] afflictions second the overcomer today
[14:08] has white raiment which is symbolic of
[14:11] possessing the righteousness of Jesus
[14:12] Christ and living the same life that he
[14:15] lived last the overcomers eyes have been
[14:19] anointed with eye south which is
[14:20] symbolic of the anointing of the Holy
[14:22] Ghost that allows one to see truth and
[14:25] error to discern the deep truths of
[14:27] God's Word and will for their lives to
[14:32] be an overcomer today Jesus said we will
[14:34] need to accept his rebukes and
[14:36] chastisements because his love is
[14:38] corrective we must have a zeal or great
[14:41] desire to repent of any and all sin in
[14:44] our hearts and lives in the final
[14:48] picture of Jesus's message to our church
[14:50] age the latest in church age verse 20
[14:53] shows that Jesus is now on the outside
[14:56] of the churches knocking and trying to
[14:58] get back into the churches in order to
[15:00] have supper or fellowship with them
[15:03] Jesus is on the outside of the churches
[15:05] because most churches have forsaken the
[15:08] preaching of his true Word and have
[15:11] instituted creeds denominations bylaws
[15:14] and traditions of men that grieve and
[15:16] even crucify the effects of the Holy
[15:19] Ghost we pray you and your church will
[15:22] open the door to Jesus Christ the Word
[15:25] of God and receive all of his love and
[15:27] correction through his perfect counsel
