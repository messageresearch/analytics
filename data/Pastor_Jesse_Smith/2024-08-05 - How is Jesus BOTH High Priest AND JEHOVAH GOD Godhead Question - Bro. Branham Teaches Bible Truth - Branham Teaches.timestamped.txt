[0:02] God could not suffer as the eternal
[0:05] spirit but when he become man he could
[0:08] suffer and feel the the pain and The
[0:12] Temptations that that man went
[0:15] through greetings friends in the
[0:17] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:20] the purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:22] viewer's question how can Jesus be both
[0:24] a high priest or mediator and also be
[0:28] Jehovah God my brief answer is that
[0:30] Jesus was both fully man and fully God
[0:32] as taught by the Bible and God's Prophet
[0:35] brother William brandham hi friends I'm
[0:37] Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ
[0:38] Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I
[0:41] defend the original Gospel of Jesus
[0:43] Christ that Jesus revealed to St Paul
[0:46] then had to restore at the end of the
[0:47] church age through Martin Luther John
[0:49] Wesley and the late Prophet William
[0:51] brandham 1909 to 1965 I also defend
[0:54] brother Ram's Godly Christian character
[0:57] so let's start with the question that
[0:58] was asked it's a great question
[1:00] it's basically a godhead question so I
[1:02] can add this video to the other godhead
[1:05] videos if the viewers would like and I
[1:06] could create a playlist on my YouTube
[1:08] channel if you would like so please let
[1:10] me know if that's a desire for the
[1:11] viewers by God's grace here's the
[1:14] question from a precious brother from
[1:16] Zambia please it is my humble request
[1:19] from you please explain in a clear way
[1:21] of understanding about Jesus Christ
[1:23] being a mediator between we Believers
[1:25] and yet him is the greatest Jehovah what
[1:29] does this mean
[1:30] excellent question so my answer in as
[1:33] clear terms as possible is that the body
[1:36] of Jesus Christ is a human body the body
[1:40] itself is not God because God is an
[1:43] invisible Immortal eternal spirit and so
[1:47] the body of Jesus Christ is fully human
[1:50] but yet it does not have a sin nature it
[1:52] had a word nature because John 1:14 says
[1:55] the word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[1:58] Us so because Jesus Jesus was fully a
[2:00] man he could experience Temptation pain
[2:03] suffering and his Humanity had to pray
[2:05] to the Divinity that was both inside of
[2:08] him and also in heaven because the Bible
[2:10] said Jesus would lift up his eyes and
[2:12] pray to the Father in heaven and yet
[2:14] Jesus said the father dwells within him
[2:17] in John 14:10 Jesus said the father that
[2:20] dwelleth in me he doeth the works and
[2:23] also this father is the same as the Holy
[2:25] Ghost it's the same person there's only
[2:27] one person in the godhead remember
[2:29] friends the godhead is a mystery
[2:30] according to Colossians 2:2 the mystery
[2:33] of God and Christ the Bible tells us
[2:36] also want to say that Jesus has two
[2:38] elements to him or two characteristics
[2:40] to him he has a humanity and he has a
[2:44] deity in the humanity it's fully flesh
[2:48] but it had the nature of the word so
[2:50] Jesus did not have a sin nature but then
[2:52] he also had a spiritual attribute or a
[2:55] spiritual nature inside of him which was
[2:57] the Holy Ghost or God the Father the
[3:00] Bible said the fullness of the godhead
[3:01] dwelt in Christ bodily it's found in
[3:03] Colossians 2:9 for in him dwell all the
[3:06] fullness of the godhead bodily so that
[3:08] must mean the full authority of God was
[3:11] in Jesus Christ because again we know
[3:13] the father dwelt in Jesus but then the
[3:15] Bible said he would lift up and pray to
[3:18] his father in Heaven you see that in
[3:19] John 11:41 and 42 at the grave of
[3:23] Lazarus Jesus lifted up his eyes and
[3:25] said father I thank thee that thou has
[3:26] heard me and I knew that thou hearest me
[3:29] always so see he looks up to heaven so
[3:31] the fullness of the authority of the
[3:33] Holy Ghost was inside of him and yet the
[3:35] holy ghost or father it's the same
[3:37] person the spirit of God was still able
[3:40] to be in heaven as well Jesus wouldn't
[3:42] lie and say the father's in heaven if
[3:44] the father wasn't in heaven this goes
[3:46] along with Matthew 28:18 and Jesus came
[3:49] and spake unto them saying all power is
[3:51] given unto me in heaven and in Earth so
[3:54] the fullness of the godhead bodily had
[3:55] to mean this power this Authority all of
[3:58] God's power and authority was given unto
[4:00] Jesus so the body of Jesus Christ in
[4:04] heaven does the high priest or mediation
[4:07] between us and then Jesus's father
[4:11] remember the father of Jesus is the
[4:12] invisible infinite eternal spirit that
[4:15] no man has seen nor will ever see
[4:18] remember no one will ever see the father
[4:20] because he's the invisible Spirit
[4:23] there's numerous verses that teach that
[4:25] like John 1:18 no man hath seen God at
[4:28] any time the only begotten son which is
[4:30] in the bosom of the father he ha
[4:32] declared him and then 1 Timothy 6:16
[4:35] whom no man hath seen nor can see so
[4:38] it's clear no one ever has seen the
[4:40] invisible Spirit God the father and no
[4:43] man will ever see the invisible Spirit
[4:45] God the father now with that in mind
[4:47] let's go to 1 Timothy 2:5 for there's
[4:50] one God and one metair between God and
[4:52] man the man Christ Jesus so here we see
[4:54] between men and the invisible God is the
[4:58] Lord Jesus Christ
[5:00] remember he's fully man fully God so
[5:02] that's how Jesus can be both God and man
[5:06] his Humanity makes intercession to the
[5:09] father and his Humanity Can Be Touched
[5:12] by the feeling of the infirmities of
[5:14] those he's interceding for like you and
[5:16] I he's been doing this of course over
[5:18] the last 2,000 years since his Ascension
[5:21] to Heaven sitting at the right hand of
[5:22] the Majesty on high brother R told us
[5:24] the only intercessor between God and man
[5:26] is Jesus Christ from show us the father
[5:28] 63 let's listen to the quote our only
[5:32] intercessor between God and man is Jesus
[5:35] Christ that's according to the Bible you
[5:37] might have others try but there's only
[5:39] one that God hears and that's Jesus
[5:41] Christ that's right notice as he set to
[5:45] a high priest the same yesterday today
[5:47] and forever here's another quote 1958
[5:50] Jesus Christ the same brother Ram said
[5:52] no other mediator between no other
[5:55] mediator between God and man the
[5:56] scripture says so Jesus Christ is the
[5:59] only one that that stands between God
[6:00] and man to make intercession he's the
[6:03] high priest that can be touched by the
[6:04] feeling of our infirmities so God had to
[6:07] become man in order to feel our
[6:09] infirmities but when God became man that
[6:12] body of Jesus was not God it was an
[6:15] image or manifestation of God because
[6:18] God cannot be touched God the Father
[6:20] cannot be touched by any infirmity but
[6:23] if God created a body then the body
[6:25] could feel the infirmities and make
[6:27] intercession to the father for those who
[6:29] need intercession let's listen to the
[6:31] quote for his body has been raised up
[6:35] and set on the throne of God tonight to
[6:38] make intercessions on our
[6:42] confession he is the
[6:45] priest high priest of our confession
[6:50] Hebrews
[6:51] 3:1 then he setting there as a high
[6:55] priest and may I say this there's no
[6:58] other mediator between God and man but
[7:01] Jesus
[7:03] Christ the scripture says so and he is
[7:07] the only one that stands between God and
[7:10] man to make
[7:12] intercession and the scripture says that
[7:15] he is the high priest that can be
[7:18] touched by the feeling of our
[7:21] infirmity and also friends this is what
[7:22] brother R said God could not die as God
[7:26] or the spirit form so he made a body to
[7:27] dwell in that could die brother Ram said
[7:30] God couldn't suffer and take the penalty
[7:32] on himself as long as he was Jehovah in
[7:34] the spirit so God had to become flesh
[7:38] and dwell among us as a human being
[7:39] brother brandom said that he could taste
[7:41] death let's listen to that quote when
[7:42] their eyes were open they knew him 1964
[7:45] let's listen to the quote that's the
[7:47] reason God was made flesh in order to
[7:49] die that he could suffer and take the
[7:52] penalty upon himself he couldn't do it
[7:53] as long as he was Jehovah in the spirit
[7:56] God the father in spirit could not do it
[7:58] but when God was made flesh and dwelt
[8:00] Among Us a human being then he could
[8:02] taste death and tast the penalty that he
[8:05] had put up on all human beings he tuck
[8:07] it up on himself and paid the priz here
[8:09] again brother Ram says it again in
[8:11] Investments 1963 God coming down to
[8:14] become man to die God could not die as a
[8:16] spirit because he could not die he's
[8:18] Eternal and he could not die but God
[8:21] could make himself in such a way that he
[8:22] could feel the pain he could feel and
[8:24] suffer God could not suffer as an
[8:27] eternal spirit but when he became man he
[8:29] could suffer and feel the pain and
[8:31] temptations that man went through let's
[8:34] listen to the quote God coming down to
[8:37] become man to die God could not die as a
[8:41] spirit because he he could not die he's
[8:45] in Eternal and he could not die but God
[8:48] could make himself in such a way that he
[8:50] could feel pain and he could feeled and
[8:54] suffer God could not suffer as the
[8:56] eternal spirit but when he become man
[8:59] man he could suffer and feel the the
[9:03] pain and The Temptations that that man
[9:06] went through like Adam and Eve in the
[9:09] Garden of Eden and every once s here's
[9:12] another one it wasn't so from the
[9:13] beginning 62 brother Ram said God built
[9:16] himself a body that he lived in himself
[9:19] brother raham said it was not Jesus the
[9:21] body that showed the glory of God he
[9:23] said it was God he said it was the glory
[9:26] of God in the Son of God showing the
[9:28] glory of God so again brother R says the
[9:30] human body of Jesus had no glory of its
[9:32] own so the father had to come and dwell
[9:35] in him the father's the Holy Ghost and
[9:37] that brought the glory of God upon the
[9:39] body of Jesus Jesus reflected god let's
[9:41] listen to the quote God and otherwise
[9:45] built himself a body that he lived in
[9:47] himself God came down was manifested in
[9:50] flesh in Christ and it was not Jesus the
[9:54] body the Son of God it was the god of
[9:58] Glory in the son of God showing the
[10:00] glory of God you see through himself the
[10:03] god of Glory manifesting the glory of
[10:05] God and in him God dwelt in him and he
[10:10] reflected God friends it's also good to
[10:13] look at some verses about Jesus's
[10:15] Humanity because Jesus's Humanity was
[10:17] not fully God in other words Jesus's
[10:19] Humanity was not the eternal spirit it
[10:22] was fully a man Jesus's body was not
[10:25] Divine Jesus body was not Eternal now
[10:28] his body is eternal now because it's
[10:30] glorified but it wasn't while he was on
[10:32] the earth Jesus was fully man yet he had
[10:34] a word nature and then he was also fully
[10:37] God because all of God's Authority and
[10:39] Power dwelt in him here's some verses to
[10:41] keep in mind Jesus's Humanity did not
[10:44] know the day and hour of the Rapture of
[10:46] his own return for the Gentile bride of
[10:48] Jesus Christ that's according to Mark
[10:51] 13:32 also Jesus did not know who
[10:53] touched him when the woman with the
[10:55] blood issue touched him that was Mark
[10:57] 5:31 of course there's new nous other
[10:59] verses that show Jesus's Humanity but we
[11:02] also see Jesus's deity in John 8:58
[11:05] Jesus said before Abraham was I am then
[11:09] in John 14 8-11 Philip said show us the
[11:11] Father and Jesus said have I been so
[11:14] long with you and yet thou has not known
[11:16] me Phillip he that has seen me has seen
[11:18] the Father and Jesus went on to say the
[11:20] father that dwelleth in me he doeth The
[11:22] Works beautiful scriptures there here's
[11:25] another quote from 56 faith brother Ram
[11:28] said he was a God man he was both man
[11:31] and God God was in him brother was
[11:34] talking about John 11 again the
[11:35] resurrection of Lazarus let's listen to
[11:37] the quote I said woman that won't work I
[11:41] said let me show you something he was a
[11:43] God man he was both man and God God was
[11:48] in him that's right I said when he went
[11:50] down to the Grave that's right he wept
[11:52] that was a man but when he draw that
[11:54] little St together he said Lazarus come
[11:57] forth now man had been dead four days
[11:59] stood on his feet live again that was
[12:01] more than a man that was God speaking
[12:03] out of there
[12:05] sir here's another helpful quote
[12:08] adoption part 3 1960 brother said
[12:11] brother R said now Jesus the body was a
[12:13] man we know that let's listen to the
[12:15] quote God only had one
[12:19] name and his name is
[12:22] Jesus that was his son he took the name
[12:25] of his son God now Jesus the body was a
[12:29] man man we know that that was the son of
[12:31] God that was overshadowed how we do not
[12:33] believe in one this type of people it
[12:36] says God's like your finger we believe
[12:38] there three ATT attributes of God
[12:41] remember friends the body of Jesus was a
[12:43] creation that's why the Bible said he's
[12:45] the beginning of the creation of God but
[12:47] that verse also applies to when Jesus
[12:50] the logos was created as the first light
[12:52] when God said let there be light
[12:55] Revelation 3:14 Jesus said the beginning
[12:57] of the creation of God so that verse has
[13:00] a compound meaning it means spiritually
[13:04] Jesus was the first creation as the
[13:05] logos of God the visible light and he
[13:08] was also the being of the creation of
[13:10] God as both a man and God and of course
[13:14] he's the only one of that kind that's
[13:17] why he's worthy of our praise worthy of
[13:18] our worship There's No One Like Jesus
[13:21] Hallelujah so friends let's remember
[13:23] that Jesus's body was a creation of God
[13:26] jesus' body was a veil of God Jesus's
[13:29] body was a manifestation of God
[13:31] according to 1 Timothy
[13:33] 3:16 but remember the eternal spirit of
[13:35] God dwelt inside the body of Jesus
[13:38] Christ the eternal spirit of God cannot
[13:40] be touched by infirmities because the
[13:42] eternal spirit of God cannot feel pain
[13:45] so God had to create a body and then
[13:47] that body could experience pain and
[13:49] suffering and then that body could make
[13:51] prayerful intercession for you and I
[13:53] because the body of Jesus Christ
[13:55] understands pain and suffering and
[13:57] infirmities so the body of Jesus J
[13:59] wasn't God meaning jesus' body was not
[14:02] an eternal spirit but the eternal spirit
[14:05] of God lived inside jesus' body and does
[14:07] so now by God's grace Also regarding
[14:10] Jesus's Humanity we know Jesus could be
[14:12] tempted he suffered Temptation the devil
[14:14] came to him to tempt him three times in
[14:17] Matthew 4 and also the parallel passage
[14:19] in Luke 4 but the Bible said God cannot
[14:22] be tempted James
[14:23] 13 for God cannot be tempted with evil
[14:26] neither tempteth he any man so we see
[14:29] the difference between the body of Jesus
[14:31] and the eternal spirit of God the father
[14:34] or the Holy
[14:36] Ghost in
[14:38] closing friends hope this video was a
[14:40] blessing by the grace of God I just
[14:41] thought I'd answer this wonderful
[14:43] godhead question there's so many more
[14:45] verses I could have used and quotes I
[14:46] just tried to pick out the ones that I
[14:48] could initially find so we're thankful
[14:50] that Jesus Christ ever lives to make
[14:53] intercession for us according to Hebrews
[14:55] 7:25 anytime we're are in need of help
[14:57] we can go in prayer to the Lord Jesus
[14:59] Jesus Christ he hears us and he'll
[15:01] Minister for us he'll intercede for us
[15:03] to the father and what we want of course
[15:06] is the perfect will of God if God wants
[15:08] to deliver us with a miracle praise the
[15:10] Lord if God wants to heal us instantly
[15:11] praise the Lord but if God has a reason
[15:14] for us to suffer or doesn't want to
[15:16] answer right away then we just got to
[15:17] trust God and love God we got to be
[15:19] mature Believers and know that God works
[15:21] at the pace of perfection we had a
[15:23] Preacher Brother Aaron come in last
[15:25] weekend and he quoted Charles Spurgeon
[15:27] who said God works at the pace of
[15:29] Perfection and surely that's the truth
[15:31] God makes all things beautiful in his
[15:32] own time and all things work together
[15:34] for good to them that love the Lord so
[15:37] we're thankful we know that Jesus can be
[15:38] both mediator and he's the image of the
[15:41] invisible God he is Jehovah God's image
[15:44] and Jehovah God dwells in Jesus Christ
[15:47] if you have any questions concerns or
[15:48] testimonies about this video please
[15:50] contact me God bless you and may Jesus
[15:53] Christ be the desire of your heart
