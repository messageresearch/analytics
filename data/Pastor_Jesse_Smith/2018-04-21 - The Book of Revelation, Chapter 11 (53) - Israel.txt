The TIMING of Events of this chapter seem to be after the rapture of the New Testament, Holy Ghost-filled, Bride of Christ.

The SYMBOLS & KEY REVELATIONS include: The Two Witnesses, The Beast, The Rapture of the Two Witnesses, The Remnant, and The 7th Angel.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Revelation chapter 11 the themes of this chapter are the Jewish temple of God the two witnesses to Israel the passing of the second woe and the seventh trumpet sounding it seems from verse one that the Jewish temple will be rebuilt in the near future as an Angels given a commandment to measure the temple the altar and the worshippers therein presently the Jewish temple has not been rebuilt in Jerusalem due to the Dome of the rock the Islamic shrine is standing on the Temple Mount the former location of Solomon's Temple the two witnesses to Israel prophesy for 1260 days or three and a half years this three and a half year ministry is the final three and a half years of the Daniels 70 weeks prophecy from Daniel chapter 9 verses 24 to 27 the passing of the second woe seems to be a great and deadly earthquake that will strike Jerusalem after the two witnesses are resurrected from the dead and raptured up to heaven the seventh trumpet sounding causes more worship of God in heaven but also brings an earthquake and hail upon the earth and this is the time when the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our Lord in Christ the timing of events is as follows the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem could happen either before the rapture or afterwards we are not sure but it seems that the official worship inside of the temple will be after the rapture based upon the verses that follow verses 1 and 2 the three-and-a-half year Ministry of the two witnesses will most likely take place immediately after the rapture of the Holy Ghost filled New Testament church for this is what God promised to do he would return to Israel after he called out a Gentile bride for his namesake since Christ was rejected by his own people Israel at Jesus's first coming to the earth the timing of the second woe and seventh trumpet seemed to follow the departure or rapture of the two witnesses the symbols and key revelations include the two witnesses the Beast the rapture of the two witnesses the remnant and the seventh angel concerning the two witnesses we are actually told they're symbols two golden candlesticks or two olive trees these same symbols were seen in Zechariah chapter 4 olive trees produce oil which represents the power or anointing of the Holy Ghost candlesticks produce light through the same oil so we again see the representation of the power and anointing of the Holy Ghost just as Zechariah chapter 4 verse 6 stated then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts the Beast is a symbol of the evil demonic spirit Kingdom recall that the Roman Kingdom was the fourth and final kingdom that would rule the world according to Daniels interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the times of the Gentiles in Daniel chapter 2 this symbol tells us then that the Roman Kingdom which is robed by the mother harlot or Roman Catholic Church will prevail to kill the two witnesses or prophets of Israel the rapture of the two witnesses is a key revelation because it is the sixth and final rapture recorded in the Bible which follows Enoch Elijah Jesus alone Jesus with the Old Testament Saints and the New Testament Bride of Christ the Renmin is a symbol of the 144,000 Jewish believers from Revelation chapter 7 verses 1 through 8 who are to be marked or sealed with the seal of the Living God which is the baptism of the holy ghost this remnant is frightened after seeing the rapture of the two prophets who were preaching that Jesus Christ is their Messiah but they also give glory to God after seeing the supernatural power of God or the rapture of the two witnesses the key revelation about the seventh angel who sounds the seventh trumpet in verses 15 through 19 is that this angel is a literal angel and not a human being this is different than the other 2/7 angels mentioned in the book of Revelation this is clear because the seventh angel with the seventh trumpet has a heavenly ministry and a trumpet blowing like the six previous heavenly angels exorcised as well the seventh angel did not have an earthly Ministry of preaching like the other seventh angels we saw in Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 and revelation 10 verse 7 God has always used man to save man through the foolishness of preaching he does not use angels to preach and lead his people but rather he uses gifted men if you would like more bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the book of Revelation please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart you
