TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God took out of the side of Adam a rib and made A BRIDE TO HIM. GOD OPENED UP THE SIDE OF CHRIST AND TAKING OUT WATER, BLOOD, and spirit for a bride, &gt;&gt; for the himself, for Christ. How beautiful. [music] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of [music] this video is to share a revelation that finally opened up to me. I've been in the message for about 25 [music] years by God's grace. And I never understood a bride [music] from Christ's side until a few weeks ago. But I'm very thankful the Lord opened this up through the word of God, [music] through waiting on the Lord and putting it up on the shelf until the spirit could reveal it to me by [music] the grace of God. For years, I've heard brother Ram say that just as God took a bride out of Adam's side, that God took a bride out of the side of [music] Christ. Well, I never quite understood it. I'd heard brother M talk about it on numerous occasions, most recently in the masterpiece sermon, which I made a video about last year and preached five sermons on the masterpiece. And even still, while preaching that series, I did not catch the revelation till I was studying on the water and the blood. So, I'm just thankful that God reveals what he wants us to know in his time and season. Now, friends, over the years, I'd heard brother Ram say numerous times that the church or the bride was born on the day of Pentecost. Of course, I could see that Jesus said, "You must be born again." And then he breathed on the disciples and said, "Go up to Jerusalem where you'll be endued with power from on high. receive ye the Holy Ghost. And then the Holy Ghost came in the form of a rushing mighty wind and then licks of fire were over the heads of all the 120 believers there. And the Bible said in Acts 2:4, "And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak in tongues as the Holy Spirit gave them utterance." But I could not understand how Brother Ram would say the bride was taken out of Christ on Calvary. Here's just one quote that I'd heard before that I believed from 1959. Palmerworm, locust, cankerworm, caterpillar in Jeffersonville. Brother Ram said, "The first thing the church was established on the day of Pentecost, Peter preached the inauguration sermon at the balorette service." I could be saying that wrong. When the church was born, the Christian church was born on the day of Pentecost. I could always see that because it was a spiritual birth. &gt;&gt; Now, the first thing, the church was established on the day of Pentecost. Peter preached the the inauguration sermon at the Bealoid service when THE CHURCH WAS BORN, THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH WAS BORN ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST. &gt;&gt; But here's one quote that I couldn't understand from 1951 at thy word. Brother Ram said, "And as God taken from Adam a rib and made Eve out of it, he taken from the side of Christ and made the church out of it." That was the one I couldn't understand. And so it was the scriptures that helped me understand this. How God took a bride out of Jesus Christ starting at the cross. And this is the main point that helped me. It was a process. Just like a birth is a process in the natural. My wife's had nine children. And each time we see the water, blood, and then spirit in that order. The water breaks. Then there's blood. And then the spirit of life of the child crying out, breathing oxygen. And so that's three steps. Water, blood, spirit. And now I can see the three steps of process of the spiritual birth. Water and blood from the body of Jesus Christ on Calvary. And then the spirit came on the day of Pentecost, 50 days after the feast of first fruits. So, what was confusing me is that it seems Adam's bride was quickly taken out of him. We'd say on the sixth day of creation, but what was stumbling me was the amount of time between Jesus's death on Calvary and the day of Pentecost. But as I studied the scripture, I saw it as a birth process, a spiritual birth process. So now it comes together by the word of God. So I'll start by showing this image. I found some pictures online. So here on the left you have Adam going to sleep and then you have the bride being brought out by the Lord and remember this is just artwork friends and then on the right you have the Lord Jesus being crucified and you have water and blood coming out of his body. Now the actual verse that opened this up was John 3:5. Except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter in the kingdom of God. While I was studying on this, I read this verse and I thought, "Oh, there's two, water, spirit. There must be a third, blood." And of course, I thought of that picture of Jesus on the cross where you have water and blood coming out. And so, this is when it struck me the water and blood and spirit represent the natural birth of a baby. Water, blood, spirit. And so, water and blood also had to be shed for our spiritual birth. So I thank the Lord that John 3:5 opened this up along with 1 John 5 67 and 8. So let's read those. This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ, not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth. And when I preached this, and I'll leave a link to the sermon where I preached this, I showed how water represents cleansing, blood represents atonement. So Jesus on the cross had to atone for our sins. That's why the blood was shed. That means reconcile us back to God, be our propituation, take the wrath of God that was against us. Jesus took our wrath and our shame that we might be his righteousness. And then the water was the washing of the water of the word, our cleansing, our purification. So he needed both water and blood. That's according to the holy scripture 1 John 5:6. Then 1 John 5:7, a great verse for the Godhead of God's one person, not three persons. For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one. Notice it doesn't say these three persons are one. Because the Father and the Holy Ghost are spirit, and then the word is spirit as well, cuz God's not talking about a paper Bible in heaven. He's talking about the logos or the visible image of God. And the Holy Ghost is represented as seven fires, the seven spirits of God before the throne of God. That's the Holy Spirit in each church age. And remember, there was Old Testament church ages as well, beginning with Solomon and ending with John the Baptist. I have a video on that if you'd like to watch that by the grace of God. So, we're so thankful. 1 John 5:7 supports one person in the Godhead, not three. And then verse 8, and there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit and the water and the blood. And these three agree in one. So, this verse also helped me along with John 3:5. Here again, you have spirit, water, and blood. Now, I'll put this image back up here on the screen, but I added some labels and caption. On the left, you have Adam sleeping. You have his side opened up, and then you have the bride. So, sleep, side, bride. On the right, you have Jesus was asleep through death. So, sleep, his side is opened up, and you have water and blood come out. And the water and blood had to come out for the soon birth of the bride in Acts 2:4. by the spirit. And of course, the scripture says in Romans 5:14 and 1 Corinthians 15:54, Adam brought in sin and death, but the last Adam, Jesus Christ, brought eternal life. So, we can see how Adam was a type of Jesus Christ. Adam in Genesis 2:es 21 and 22 was put to sleep. His side opened up and God uses ri form his wife or Eve. So you have those three sleep side bride and then Christ in John 19 30 and 34 was put to death or sleep his side was opened up by a spear which brought water and blood and that started the process of the birth of the church because you had water blood and then on the day of Pentecost came the spirit of God. So you have sleep again side and then bride. Now later I found this quote from 1953 where brother Ram ties in this type of Adam and his rib making a bride with Christ and the church and brother Renham quotes water, blood and spirit. So he quotes first John 56 7 and 8. Now brother Ram's talking about the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is Acts 2:4. He said, "The only thing to do is save yourself from the this generation by looking to Jesus Christ, accepting him, and be born into to God's provided way, the baptism of the Holy Spirit." Amen. Listen, he died on the cross, and there he bled. He was took upon himself the form of sinful flesh. He died in mystead. He was just as God took out of the side of Adam a rib and made a bride to him. God opened up the side of Christ and taken out water, blood and spirit for a bride for the himself, for Christ. How beautiful. And I can say amen to that. How beautiful, brother Brandham. And by one spirit, not by one church membership. By one spirit, we're all baptized. Amen. Are we all baptized into one body and become members of that body? And then he connects it to the rapture. And just as sure as God raised that body in the literal out from the grave, the spiritual body will go in the rapture truly. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HE DIED IN MYSTEAD. HIS JUST AS GOD TOOK OUT THE side of Adam a rib and made A BRIDE TO HIM. GOD OPENED UP THE SIDE OF CHRIST AND TAKEN OUT WATER, BLOOD, and spirit for a bride, &gt;&gt; for the himself, for Christ. How beautiful. And by one spirit, not by one church membership, &gt;&gt; by one spirit. &gt;&gt; Are we all baptized? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE ALL BAPTIZED INTO ONE BODY? &gt;&gt; AND BECOME MEMBERS OF THAT BODY. &gt;&gt; AND JUST AS SURE AS GOD RAISED THAT BODY IN THE LITERAL OUT FROM the grave, the spiritual body will go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Truly. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, over the years, some people have stumbled at the word bride. They don't realize it's in the Bible. And Jesus calls his church, the Holy Ghost filled saints, the bride. Now, God even promises to call Israel during the millennium, his bride. In Isaiah 62:es 4 and 5, he's speaking of thy land bulah, or married land. For the Lord delightth in thee, and thy land shall be married. And as the bridegroom rejoicth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee. So we have this prophecy of how God will rejoice over Israel like a husband rejoices over a bride. But we already have this promise in the New Testament. John 3 29, he that hath the bride is the bridegroom. So this is speaking of Jesus Christ and the church. And then Revelation 22:17 says the same thing. The word bride, the spirit and the bride say come. And of course, this was spoken during the Ephesian church age. So the times of the Gentiles. So the church during the times of the Gentiles is the Gentiles. So the Gentiles are the bride of Jesus Christ. God had blinded the Jews and went to the Gentiles. So here the Gentile church is called the bride of Jesus Christ. And I'll share two more things here. by God's grace. Also, when I was studying on the water and blood and spirit, I was reminded how Jesus when he was crucified and the spear was thrust into him, water and blood came out. That blood at Jesus's crucifixion represented the earth being atoned for for all of its sins. Because the earth has to go through three works of grace, just like the believer goes through three works of grace for redemption. Three is a number of perfection. So perfect redemption comes by justification, sanctification, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's represented by water, blood, and spirit. So God redeems the earth in a perfect way through the three works of grace. The water covered the earth in the days of Noah's flood. Blood was shed from Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the son of God, at his crucifixion. And the fire will be the fervent heat that covers the earth before the righteous can walk upon the ashes of the wicked into the millennium as Malachi 4:1 says and numerous other verses speaking of the fervent heat. And lastly, while studying on this subject abide from Christ's side, I felt like just some more revelation dropped down as I was sitting here studying. So Jesus's open side when he was pierced by the spear on the cross opened everything or helped start the opening of everything. And what I mean by everything is the following. When the side of Christ was open, we were given access to eternal life because the water and blood came out and then eternal life came on the day of Pentecost. That's the spirit of God sealing the soul unto the day of redemption and that's eternal life for the believer. Next, the temple veil was opened according to Matthew 27:51. That gives us access to God's presence through prayer. Third, the bosom of Abraham was opened according to Matthew 27. This gives the Old Testament saints access to heaven and now New Testament saints go to heaven as well. Paradise changed locations from the heart of the earth to heaven. Fourth, the earth was opened up in Matthew 27 when the earthquake took place on the morning of the resurrection and that gave the Old Testament saints access to Jerusalem. The Bible said they were seen of many in the city. And lastly, the graves were opened up and that gave the saints access to glorified bodies. So, praise God that the side of Jesus Christ, the last Adam, was opened up that a bride could be taken out and the Old Testament and New Testament believers were giving access to everything. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Again, it's another example of how we just wait on the Lord. He'll renew our strength like the eagle. God reveals everything in his time and season. So, for 25 or 24 years, I just never understood this until recently. So, I'll leave a link to that sermon in the description. I think it was called There Came forth Blood and Water. It's a good reminder. If you don't understand something, just set it on the shelf and then at the right time and season, God will reveal it when we have need of it by the grace of God. We just want to thank the Lord that just as Eve was taken out of Adam, we as the bride of Jesus Christ were taken out of Christ. Now, we know Ephesians 1:4 says we were in the mind of Christ before the foundation world, but there had to come a time of manifestation. And when God sent us down here to earth, sent our spirits and souls down here when we were born, that's when God started manifesting his thought of every believer. And then he manifested their life as part of the bride of Jesus Christ, the seven church ages. And I just read today how brother Ram said, "The Holy Ghost was the same in every age, the same evidence, the same Holy Ghost experience in every age." I'll just read it out of my book here. And every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the true believer. I say in every age, the evidence was the same. Those who had the spirit, the teacher, heard the word. And that spirit in them took the word and taught it, revealed it to them. And they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it. Praise God that we've heard God's messenger, brother William Brham. And the Holy Spirit's revealed his word to us. And we just don't talk about it. We just don't press, play, and obey. We actually live it. The tape worshippers don't live the word of God. They don't gather more as we see that day approaching. They don't listen to the five-fold ministry like Ephesians 4 8-16 says. But the true bride of Christ will live all the word of God. What a privilege that all these things have been opened up to us. Let us serve the Lord in fear, godly fear, the fear of the Lord and holiness all the days of our life. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and [music] may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. I'm very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed.
