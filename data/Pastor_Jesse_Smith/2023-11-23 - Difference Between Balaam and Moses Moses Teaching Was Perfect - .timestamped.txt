[0:00] what was the difference the teaching of
[0:03] Moses is
[0:05] perfect Moses a man sent from God with
[0:10] the word of God and on his journey taken
[0:14] Israel into the promised land strictly
[0:18] with the Commandment of God he met
[0:20] another
[0:21] Prophet another anointed
[0:25] one that had a
[0:27] genuine anointing of the holy spirit
[0:30] that was upon
[0:33] Moses
[0:35] right he was a
[0:37] prophet the Holy Spirit was upon this
[0:40] man his name was
[0:44] balum we're all acquainted with him well
[0:46] the very things the same the things the
[0:49] things that the man said is still taking
[0:52] place about 2,800 years
[0:56] ago th like a unicorn old Israel who
[0:59] whoever blesses you will be blessed
[1:02] whoever curses you will be cursed your
[1:04] strength Mighty how righteous are their
[1:07] tents oh Jacob see he couldn't help
[1:09] himself he come there purposing in his
[1:12] heart to curse the
[1:14] people oh you false
[1:18] teachers listen these
[1:20] tapes all these years and seeing God
[1:24] confirm exactly what he said and you
[1:25] said in your
[1:27] study I know it's a truth and because of
[1:30] your denominational differences you
[1:33] dispute them and tell your people
[1:34] they're not so War unto
[1:38] you your time is close at hand
[1:45] amen bam Anointed with the same spirit
[1:50] that was up on
[1:54] Moses what was the
[1:57] difference the teaching of Moses was
[2:00] perfect the Bible said here in second
[2:02] Peter that it was a teaching of balum
[2:05] that Israel received that God never did
[2:11] forgive unpardonable
[2:14] sin not a one of them got
[2:17] saved though they had come out under the
[2:20] blessings of God and seen the hand of
[2:21] God moving by this Mighty prophet and
[2:23] seen exactly Vindicated by God and
[2:26] because another Prophet come in with a
[2:29] teaching
[2:30] contrary and disputed with Moses and
[2:34] tried to prove to the people that Moses
[2:36] was wrong and
[2:39] D Kora many of them agreed with him and
[2:43] taught the children of Israel to commit
[2:45] fornications to go after his
[2:48] organization that we're all the
[2:51] same where we Methodist Baptist
[2:53] Presbyterian of Pentecostals and what
[2:54] more we're all the same we're not the
[2:58] same you are a separated
[3:01] people holy unto the Lord dedicated to
[3:05] the word and the spirit of God to bear
[3:07] fruit of his promise of this day and
[3:10] you're not of
[3:12] them I know that's awful
[3:15] strong but that's the truth just the
[3:19] same dedicated to a service in this last
[3:23] days come out from amongst
[3:27] us now the teaching of balum not the
[3:32] prophecy of balum that was all right
[3:35] that was
[3:37] God how many believes that amen the
[3:40] prophecy of bam was exactly right
[3:42] because he couldn't speak nothing else
[3:44] the anointing of God wouldn't speak
[3:45] nothing
[3:48] else and God Vindicated it by proving it
[3:51] was the truth but it was the teaching of
[3:54] bam now compare that Matthew
[3:58] 24:24 on anointed ones but their
[4:01] teaching is
[4:03] false the trinities and all things like
[4:06] that wrong
[4:10] Antichrist I hope your feelings don't
[4:12] get hurt and don't turn that that phones
[4:15] off and don't get up and go out just sit
[4:17] still and let's see if the Holy Spirit
[4:19] won't reveal it to us and prove it to us
[4:23] say but that just whatever you believe
[4:25] is sit still listen ask God to open your
[4:27] heart then you'll find out whether
[4:29] you're
[4:30] a bra or thistle or wherever you're
[4:34] standing
