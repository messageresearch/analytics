TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Now, Brother Junior Jackson had a right to disagree with that. He wants his church, the people all want to speak with tongues and things IN OUR AUDIENCE. THAT'S BROTHER Junior's [music] uh troubles. THAT'S THAT'S UP TO HIM. BUT JUNIOR JACKSON BELIEVES THIS MESSAGE THE SAME AS ANY OF THE REST OF us does. He's one of us and it's not a dead bird to go there. &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in [music] the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about the operation of gifts, especially tongues, interpretation, and prophecy that go forth during the main service. This is an excellent question. And so, by the help of the Lord, we'll look to the scripture [music] and quotes from God's prophet, Brother Brandham, regarding this subject. This topic is related to a recent video [music] I made where I talked about how we've only had three tongues and interpretations in our church during the entire nearly [music] 20 years of having a local church. One of the times tongues manifested, it was interpreted and it seemed to be from the Lord with two or three [music] witnesses. The other two times we had tongues. We prayed for an interpretation but there was no interpretation. And so we just rejoice that a person was edified and then we just wait upon the Lord for the next time the Lord wants to speak. The Bible said, "Do all speak with tongues?" And of course the answer is no. Not all speak with tongues. Not all prophesy. Not all are apostles and so forth. Let's get to the biblical foundation for this subject. It's in 1 Corinthians 14 26-33 and then verse 40. I could be wrong, friends, but if there's any other biblical New Testament text that outlines how to manage the gifts of the spirit in the local congregation, please let me know. I guess I'd also add verses 24 and 25 from 1 Corinthians chapter 14. But if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he has convinced of all, he has judged of all. And thus the secrets of his heart made manifest. And so falling down on his face, he will worship God and report that God is in you of a truth. So here we see a sinner walking into a church assembly. His secrets of his heart are made manifest and then he falls down and admits that God is there. That's a true operation of the gifts of God. But then in verses 26 through 33 and verse 40, Paul gives more details on this. Now friends, again correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like there's basically only four guidelines for the operation of gifts. The first guideline is found in verse 27. If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two or at the most by three and that by course and let one interpret. So the first guideline is only two or three tongues and interpretations or prophecies. The second guideline is in verse 29. Once those prophecies have gone forth, they need to be judged by judges. Brother Ram calls it either gifts of wisdom or gifts of discernment as the recent video showed. Let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge. The third principle is found in verse 32. Verse 32 says, "The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets." Brother Ram uses this verse to establish the fact that those who speak with tongues, interpret and prophesy, can control those tongues as far as when they're supposed to be given. Brother Ram says they're not supposed to interrupt the preacher because the spirit of God is speaking through the preacher during the preaching. They have their turn to come after the preacher. And so they can control and hold that tongue interpretation or prophecy until after the spirit is done speaking through the preacher. Now you people speak with tongues and it's got gifts of tongues. God bless you. You're needed in this tabernacle. I want you here. But now the the things in order, don't never do it while the preachers are preaching. If you do, you're out of order. See, you mustn't do it. For the Bible said the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet. And when a man is preaching, he's got the floor. He's got the audience. The Holy Spirit's going to speak through him. When he's finished, then it's the time for the message. You see? So don't get out of order. If you do, then you interrupt and you you grieve the Holy Spirit, which the message is going forth. &gt;&gt; And the fourth guideline is to establish order. That's found in verse 40. Let all things be done decently and in order. So four simple guidelines for the operation of tongues interpretation. Now friends, anything else you want to add to that is a Christian liberty. Now if you say your way to handle gifts is the only way and everything else is wrong. Now you've become a legalist. You've added to the word of God. Remember lechiviousness is having lawlessness or no rules. The other extreme to that is legalism where you make your ways your own man-made traditions. You make that the unbending way. So it seems like from this question from the brother overseas that a lot of churches in his country have gotten into legalism. In other words, they say if you don't do gifts and operate gifts the way we do, you're wrong. And that's sad, but again, that's like the foolish Galatians that have brought legalism back into grace. And just as Paul wondered whether the Galatians were born again, well then we can wonder the same thing. Are these people really born again that are making all these legalistic false doctrines? Now remember friends, in 1957, brother Ram said, "Every doctrine, everything else of the Bible that we have in the church must be based upon the word of God. Must come from the word of God. not just one place but from Genesis to Revelation it must say the same thing because we cannot base our thoughts upon one little scripture for the Bible said in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established. So we just established all those verses those four guidelines from 1 Corinthians chapter 14. And again as far as I know and I could be wrong correct me if I'm wrong. As far as I know, there's no other teachings in the New Testament that teach a different order of the tongues, interpretations, and prophecies in the local assembly. St. Paul set him in order. He said to change anything he preached would be a curse upon the person in Galatians 1:es 6-12. And he even says it here in chapter 14. What came the word of God out from you or came unto you only? If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord. Now, let's get to these questions here. By God's grace, it looks like there's one 2 3 4 five simple questions. Now, based upon that biblical foundation, the first question is, are all gifted people required to meet in a separate room before the main service? Now, that's how brother Brandham wanted it. But if you go back to the scripture, does the scripture tell us that? The answer is no. So, this is an area of Christian liberty. If a church wants to have all the gifted people meet in a room before service, brother Brandham recommended that. And the reason he recommended that was to let the spirit be able to fully preach the sermon during the church service assembly so that the preacher wasn't interrupted by tongues interpretation and prophecy. Brother Bram tells us that plainly in questions and answers part two 1964. So this idea about the gifted people meeting in a separate room before the main service, that was brother Bram's liberty. That was his opinion. It was not a thus sayeth the Lord because you don't find that in the scripture. Nor do you find a thus sayith the Lord quote from brother Brandham. So the main issue is that the Bible does not mandate gifted people meet in a separate room before the service. Brother Brandham explained why he put the gifts in a separate room. Brother Ram said he had trouble with people with tongues interpretations of prophecies interrupting the preacher. So that's why he did church order in that manner. He said brother Junior Jackson had a right to disagree with him showing brother Ram did not have thus sayith the Lord on this church order preference or area of liberty. It's important to note that look brother Ram tried to let the tongues interpretation and prophecies stay out in the main service before he put them in a separate room. So brother Brand was willing to take a risk, willing to try something under the liberty of the Holy Spirit. It didn't work out for him. So that's why he put the gifts in a separate room before the service. And then remember, Brother Rand poured on a rebuke and told the people they ought to be ashamed of themselves for criticizing the way Junior Jackson and JT Parnell might have operated their churches with their gifts in a different manner. He really wanted to pour on a rebuke for people that were legalistic. So again, anyone who's legalistic, shame on you, according to brother Brandham. The second question was, should there be prophecies during the main service? So again, we can see according to the Bible, yes, they're allowed as long as they're done decently and in order. So I guess some churches will allow no prophecies in the main service. Well, that goes against 1 Corinthians 14 and the example we read about the prophecy going forth and the man falling down and saying, "Surely God is among you." Again, Brother Bram never gave us thus sayith the Lord, that there should never be a prophecy in the main church service. Anyone who says different is not saying what brother Brandham said, nor are they saying what 1 Corinthians 14 says. They're creating their own legalistic rule, their own man-made tradition. if they're saying there can never be prophecies in the main service. Third, should there be shaking of hands, welcoming of visitors or anything in the main auditorium? Now, I can find nothing in the scripture in the New Testament that specifically addresses this. So, I think this falls under the area of the sovereignty of the local church, the Christian liberty given to the pastor and the local assembly. So apparently some churches in another country are saying you can never welcome people. You can never shake hands after the service. It's so ridiculous. It's such a legalistic idea. Where does the Bible command that? The Bible doesn't command that. The Bible does say God is to be had in great reverence in the assembly of the saints. That's true. But again, 1 Corinthians 14 says we should be able to say amen in the church. We should be able to say amen at the giving of thanks, of tongues, interpretations, and so forth. Now, there's only one service I've ever heard from Brother Brandham where he said, "Don't shake hands. Don't talk to anybody." It was at the end of souls that are in prison now. And remember, Brother Ram said he went to the pulpit with a presumption that perhaps there was no more time left to be saved. So, I'll try to find that quote and put it in here by the grace of God. Brother Ram was saying, "Don't shake hands. This is a serious time. Don't smile." But then there's many other quotes where brother Ram says, "Let's dismiss and shake hands." &gt;&gt; Now, not one smile. This is not smiling time. No. [music] &gt;&gt; With a deepness of sincerity. &gt;&gt; While that song's playing, let's shake hands with that. Somebody by said, "God bless you, Christian." With sincerity. &gt;&gt; Here's one from 1953 at the Brandom Tabernacle Israel in the church. Brother Ram said, "God bless you." Now you're dismissed in God's love and blessing. Now, all of you members of the tabernacle, shake hands with these people here. Be sure that every one of you shake their hands. Welcome them back. May the Holy Spirit do the same. Now just make up. Forget all your differences. Make up. All right. And then he sings at the name of Jesus, bowing, take the name of Jesus with you. Here in the unpardable sin, 1954 in Jeffersonville, Brother Bram says, "Let's shake hands with everybody. Don't stand at one person very long. Just reach over and get another. Glad to have you, brother. Come back. Glad to have you, sister. God bless you. Shake hands with everybody. If you want to visit, you can go home and visit, but let's shake hands with everybody. See, go around and shake hands with everybody. then go out of the building rejoicing. Won't you do that? God bless you. While we bow our heads, Brother Ruddle, back there, will you dismiss us in prayer if you will, Brother Ruddle? So, there's many other examples like this. I think there's 28 examples that have shake hands and dismiss in it. So, to me, it seems on this issue of do we welcome people? Do we shake hands? It all depends what is going on in the congregation. Is it a time for repentance like the souls that are in prison time where there should be no talking? It's serious time. We're checking up on our souls or like these other times when you're just leaving the church rejoicing. Is it repentance or rejoicing that tells you what to do at the end of a service? But there should be no legalistic requirement where we never welcome, we never shake hands in the auditorium. Even in Ecclesiastes 3, the Bible said there's a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing. There's a time to shake hands. There's a time not to shake hands. That's what we see in these quotes from God's prophet, Brother Brandham. Souls that imprisoned now is a time not to embrace. And these others examples like the unpardable sin 54. There's a time to embrace, shake hands, and leave the assembly rejoicing. The fourth question was, is each local church autonomous and sovereign? The answer is yes, as long as they stay within the boundaries of the scripture we read, 1 Corinthians 14, and as long as the liberties they decide to do not cause anyone to stumble. So I would imagine it could cause somebody to stumble if, like brother Ram said, you carry on in a big long conversation in the auditorium. Brother Ram calls that visiting. Brother Ram said, don't visit in there. Brother Bram said, shake hands, greet one another, and rejoice in the congregation, but don't visit. Don't do a whole visit, a whole conversation. And so if people get too loose and they get too loud and too silly in the congregation, that could cause people to stumble, especially if there's people at the altar seeking God, repenting of their sins, praying. So you have to have a sensitivity to the Holy Spirit at the end of every service and of course all throughout the service. The last question is should every church say if it's good enough for Brandham Tabernacle then it's good enough for every church and I would say the answer to that is no because brother Ram said the brand tabernacle would lose its strength and it has the common statement should be if it's good enough for the book of acts church then it's good enough for every church if it's good enough for the New Testament Bible scriptures then it's good enough for us we should prove all things by the scripture as Paul said and as brother Brandham said, brother Ram said, "Prove all things by the scripture. Every doctrine must come from the Bible. Our standard for everything that we do should come from the Holy Bible." Brother Ram said we can't add one word to the Bible nor take one word away from the Bible. Brother Ram said anything that should be done should come from the Bible. &gt;&gt; So the Bible is perfectly true and that's what we stand on the Bible. It must be thus sayeth the Lord. Now, we do believe that God can do things that's not written in this word because he's God. He does whatever he wishes. But yet, I like to see anything when it comes in the line of a doctrine come out of the Bible. Amen. Because I believe that the Bible is the full revelation of Jesus Christ. The Bible said that's what it is. It is the revelation of Jesus Christ. Nothing is to be added to it or anything taken from it. So, I like to stay right into what it says and what it promises. If he'd just do what he promised, that's all I care to see anyhow. And I know I'll see him. &gt;&gt; So, in closing, friends, I'll play this quote from Questions Answers, part two, 1964, where Brother Brandon pours it on the people who called the members of Junior Jackson's church dead birds. Brother Brandham rebuked them because basically they were prideful that their handling of the gifts was better than Junior Jackson or JT Parnell's churches. Brother Ram said, "Shame on them for that." And Brother Ram said, "The pastors have a right to operate their gifts different." And Brother Ram never says, "Thus sayith the Lord in here." He said, "They're going to have trouble." Because that was Brother Ram's experience, but he didn't say, "Thus sayith the Lord." And again, remember, Brother Ram tried to let the gifts operate during the regular church service out in the congregation, but he found it didn't work. So, he put it in the main room. So, friends, it's a joy to have the message of the hour. Brother Brand pointing us back to the word of God. We appreciate that brother Brandham pointed us back to the scripture so we can answer questions like this from the scripture. We just got to make sure we don't get tied up into legalism, man-made traditions, self-righteousness, foolishness. But thank God Jesus said the Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth. And thank God Jesus said you'll know they're my disciples because of their love one for another. Let's have the love of Jesus Christ. Let's give our brothers Christian liberty and let's let the scripture be our absolute. So, here's the quote from God's prophet, Brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Uh, also in here, I might bring this out. I see my I don't think my brother's here tonight, but somebody made fun of somebody leaving the tabernacle and went down to brother Junior Jackson's for a church. Said they went down amongst the dead birds. Aren't you ashamed to make a remark like that? Ever who you are, if you're my kid here in Christ, I'm ashamed of you. Don't do a thing like that. JUNIOR JACKSON IS MY BROTHER. Don Ruddle is my brother. Well, the reason of it because when I set the church here in a certain order when I come back to see if I could get the manifestation of the gifts, half of them pulled away from it. Because when you would start to speak or preach or something, it got it was getting in such a place that you could hardly preach unless there was somebody spoke in tongues, somebody interpretation. And half of it never even come to pass. &gt;&gt; Now I believe in speaking in tongues. I believe in interpretation. BUT IT MUST BE SOMETHING DIRECTLY TO THE CHURCH. NOT THE LORD is coming soon OR SOMETHING WHICH IS ALL RIGHT. BUT DON'T USE vain repetitions. Jesus said &gt;&gt; as heathens do. &gt;&gt; It must BE SOMETHING. GO TELL BROTHER SO AND SO A CERTAIN thing he done and and get go tell brother sister so and so when she did a certain thing down the other day, she transgressed the laws of her husband's the vow to her husband. Unless she makes this light right, the Holy Spirit will cut her off. &gt;&gt; There you've got thus sayaith the Lord. THEN BRING THAT SIN IN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's when we got a church like it was when Ananas survived. Come in. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; then we got a church that stands solid. Oh, YOU SAID, "BROTHER BRAM, ONE GUY I TOLD HIM, HE SAID, WELL, YOU PUT US TOO MUCH ON THE SPOT." I SAID, "AIN'T I ON THE SPOT UP THERE?" &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE STRANGERS ARE NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. THAT'S RIGHT. BUT I GOT FAITH AND CONFIDENCE IN MY GOD WHO SENT ME TO DO THIS. AND NEVER ONE TIME HAS it been wrong or never will be as long as it's God. &gt;&gt; Right? Not speaking in tongues and things like that. I believe that those tongues and people got them gifts if they're real genuine Christians and interested in it. They'll meet themselves TOGETHER BECAUSE AND GIVE THE TONGUES and interpretations and see what they CAN DO TO FURTHER THE KINGDOM OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THEY GOT A MINISTRY OF THEIR OWN. BUT IT DON'T BELONG here in the middle of the audience where the sinners are being dealt with and so forth. The Bible said they say you're unlearned. Sometimes they get so irreverent with it and and so forth. Not our gang hadn't. But I'll let them go ahead a while. I said, "WATCH IT." NOW, I told the brethren, his witnesses know this. I SAID, "LET IT ALONE. AFTER A WHILE, I'LL we'll find OUT WHETHER IT'S OF GOD OR NOT. IF IT CANNOT STAND CHASTISEMENT, THEN IT'S A BASTARD CHILD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's exactly what the Bible said. AND WHEN THE CHASTISEMENT COME, WHAT HAPPENED? &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Did I tell you that long ago? &gt;&gt; Ask the pastor here. He said, "What about this and that?" I said, "Just let it alone. They're babies. WE CAN'T JUDGE IT, BUT WATCH WHEN IT REALLY COMES TO PIN DOWN TO THE WORD." &gt;&gt; NOW, Brother Junior Jackson had a right to disagree with that. He wants his church, the people all want to speak with tongues and things IN THE AUDIENCE. THAT'S BROTHER JUNIOR'S UH TROUBLES. THAT'S THAT'S UP TO HIM. BUT JUNIOR JACKSON BELIEVES THIS MESSAGE THE SAME AS ANY OF THE REST OF us does. He's one of us and it's not a dead bird to go there. Junior Jackson is a man of God that I love with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not here tonight so I can really pour it on the way I want to. And and Don Ruddle, I don't think Don's here tonight cuz they got church of their own. But if I seen every person COME TO THIS TABERNACLE, WALK OUT AND GO TO DON RUDDLE or or Brother JT Parnell or brother any of these BROTHERS HERE THAT'S OUR BROTHERS here and fellow CITIZENS OF THE KINGDOM. I'D BE SO HAPPY. I WOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO. I'D SAY, "LORD, FILL US BACK UP AGAIN. LET'S POUR IT OUT AND FILL UP ANOTHER ONE." &gt;&gt; I'd love it. I'D LOVE TO SEE THOSE BOYS. THEY'RE MY THEY'RE MY CHILDREN. NOW, JT or or any of the rest of them don't have to believe just like I do. They don't have to do that. AS I TOLD YOU THIS MORNING, I DON'T EVEN AGREE WITH MY WIFE or she don't agree with me. [clears throat] What if I went to table and Junior got apple pie and I got cherry pie? Brother, we're both eating pie. We'd agree that. BUT &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND WE BOTH PREACH THE SAME GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; HIS CHURCH DISCIPLINE, YOU KNOW, PETER AND PAUL HAD DIFFERENCES. &gt;&gt; Not in their doctrines, but the way Peter was behaving himself. &gt;&gt; They had a a little difference in it, but it never separated them. &gt;&gt; They were brothers. Well, sure, we're going to have differences. Not differences. I DISAGREE WITH ASSEMBLIES OF GOD. I DISAGREE WITH their sisters. But there's a many assembly of God. Man is a precious brother. I disagree with THE ONENESS DOCTRINE, BUT THERE'S A MANY OF THOSE MEN ARE PRECIOUS MAN. &gt;&gt; If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus [music] Christ be the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. It never failed.
