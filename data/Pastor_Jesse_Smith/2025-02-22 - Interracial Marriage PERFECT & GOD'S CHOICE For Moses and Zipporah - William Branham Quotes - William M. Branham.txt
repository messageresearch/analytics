TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and maram show her try too when she laughed because Moses married this Negro girl no brother what God does is perfect and there one day we find out that even Mariam a prophet and Aaron the high priest made fun of Moses wife because she was an Ethiopian that wasn't Moses choice that was God's choice for Moses [Music] amen greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to share another wonderful quotation from God's Prophet brother William brandham about the interracial marriage of Moses and Zapora by God's grace this is sort of a follow-up to the video I put out on January 21st 2025 about uh addressing criticism for three of my videos released in the past which were interracial marriage Minister's marriage requirements and the Order of events of the seven-year Great Tribulation period so again this video is done of course in brotherly kindness and respect to anyone who might criticize me I love the quotation brother Brandon made we ought to be able to disagree bitterly but then at the end of any disagreement ought to shake hands hug and still think just as much as the individual we disagree with as Christ thinks of them so let's listen to that quote by the grace of God see if you can't disagree with a man in things then shake his hand and still have the same feelings towards him then there's something wrong with you if I can't disagree with a man bitterly from one side to the other and still think as much of him as as Christ would then there's something wrong with my spirit I haven't the spirit of Christ now in this case I'm not naming the one who criticizes me I don't think I've actually met this person who's criticize me but I've heard him preach live a few times by the grace of God I was thoroughly blessed and as I said in my previous video this brother is probably my favorite preacher as far as the one God has used to give me the most understanding of the Bible and brother bram's message by the grace of God so the inspiration for this video was this week I was studying on the book of Corinthians and I was listening to brother Ram sermon from 1957 about Corinthians book of Correction and brother random mentioned Moses and Zapora and how Moses married Zapora in Ethiopian so no doubt she was dark- skinned and Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses for this marriage and brother brandham said what God does is perfect brother Ram said God did it so God put Moses and Zapora together it was a perfect marriage God did it brother Rand said if I could explain it then I'd be equal with God I can't explain it I just believe it that's all that's all I'm asked to do so this really jumped out to me I'd forgotten that brother Bram had said this that he called Moses's and Zapora marriage God's work of perfection so just in my humble opinion this seems like it was the perfect will of God for Moses and Zapora to Mary since brother Ram uses that word perfect we know according to Romans 121:2 that there's such a thing as the perfect will of God and of course in the Old Testament we can see lots of examples of the permissive will of God such as Hezekiah taking the permissive will of God and getting 15 more years of life when he didn't honor God with those 15 years let me know if you want scriptural references for these examples and also balum took the permissive will of God in the Book of Numbers he was not supposed to go down with Bao but he went back and asked God for a second opinion and so God gave him his permissive will and Friends remember we can prove by the Bible that God approved and ordained interracial marriages at least six times here's the examples Moses and zapor number one Joseph and azth number two Ruth and Boaz number three Uriah and basba number four Rahab and salon number five and Timothy's Jewish mother and Greek father their marriage of course produced Timothy and Timothy was baptized with the Holy Ghost and no one was more like-minded as the prophet brother Paul as his son in the gospel Timothy so that's so awesome to see that a person born out of interracial marriage could be the most like-minded to a prophet of God even though he wasn't a prophet but God can save people who are the result of an interracial marriage and also baptize them with the baptism of the Holy Holy Ghost what a beautiful Story by the grace of God so let's listen to this quote from Corinthians book of Correction April 14th 1957 and maram showed her Cy to when she laughed because Moses married this Negro girl and said wasn't there other girls to be married and so forth he could done it and God wasn't pleased with that and smot her with an leprosy and her own brother screamed out and said would you let your sister die in that shape and God told Moses to come come before him and he went and interceded for for marrying she didn't live long after that no brother what God does is perfect we ain't got no business with our minds putting anything to it just leave it the way it is God did it God said it that settles it just take it I don't know how if I could explain it then I'd be equal with God I can't explain it I just believe it amen huh that's all I'm asked to do next let's listen to this other quote from respects October 15th evening 1961 where brother Ram said that was God's choice God's choice for Moses so a black woman was God's choice for Moses God put together and ordained this interracial marriage let's listen to the quote and there one day we find out that even Mariam a propheus and Aon the high priest made fun of moses' wife because she was an Ethiopian and thought was there enough women of our own group to marry instead of going down there and marrying that woman that wasn't Moses choice that was God's choice for Moses amen and when they made fun of it that angered God in such a way until he struck Miriam the prophetes full of leprosy Moses own sister what about that her a prophetess but what was she doing she was making fun in an irreverence to God's messenger amen the messenger of the Covenant of that day and she was irreverent and also Aaron the high priest the very mouthpie of Moses yes right so I'll just share a few more things here before the close of the video remember that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever according to Hebrews 138 so it was the Lord Jesus his spirit that ordained Moses and Zapora to Mary along with these other five examples in interracial marriages and friends again interracial marriage is probably a very rare thing amongst most people groups in the world today so I'm not advocating that every single person do an interracial marriage I'm simply saying that there's times God ordains it and allows it just as we can see plainly in the Bible amongst Believers I went back and listen to the sermon that criticized me from the wonderful brother and I'll share about three other statements that he made the first statement was preachers like me don't believe the messenger now I would say again this is nonsense the truth is that we have quotes on both sides of this interracial marriage issue so what do we do we take everything back to the word of God the Bible is our absolute brother Ram said the Holy Ghost will only point you back to the word of God brother Ram says the holy ghost in the word is the dissolver of all doubts so when there's doubts and we see quotes on both sides of a topic we got to go back to the word of God remember brother Ram taught us every Doctrine must go from Genesis to Revelation or agree with all the scriptures from Genesis to Revelation so that's what we do we go back to the word of God the real question that I would ask to our precious brother who criticizes me is do you believe these quotes about Moses and Zapora being God's choice for Moses and it being the perfect will of God or was a perfect choice of God to choose Zapora in Ethiopian for Moses so again I believe the message of the hour but the message of the hour is the word of God that God is vindicating today from the Bible as brother Ram said in the Rapture message 1965 the message of the hour is not every human thought on the tapes of brother brandham so I would encourage all of our viewers to understand that the message of the hour is the scriptures God is vindicating today and also I would just humbly say maybe it's not us who can see interracial marriage as ordained of God in the Bible that don't believe the message maybe it's the brother criticizing that doesn't really believe all the message because it seems like he's not believing these quotes that are on this video from Corinthians book of Correction and respects and that could be again because this precious brother has a complex that he's built up in his mind and he's unable to take this topic to the word of God in one place I remember the brother said how can I stare at these quotes against interracial marriage and meet God with well you have to also stare at the quotes from the Bible where God ordains interracial marriage and when you stare at all the quotes you'll find the revelation of the Holy Ghost in the Bible is that God ordains interracial marriage on certain occasions not in every marriage of course but only when God ordains it and again humbly some preachers are just so dogmatic they can't learn anything they don't want to learn anything they don't want to open up their hearts to further revelation of the Holy Ghost but brother man taught us never put a period after a belief put a comma and brother Ram said God will never change the Revelation but will give more information about the same Revelation brother Ram said that in the church age book the second criticism from the preacher was that you don't go along with certain things brother Brandon preached but again I can say the same thing about the brother who's criticizing me you're not going along with these other quotes that brother Brandon preached about interracial marriage brother brand said God put a perfect marriage together for Moses and Zapora an interracial marriage was perfect and it was God's choice to do that it was God's Perfect Choice to allow an interracial marriage so again why doesn't our precious brother go along with these quotes and one thought I also had was that perhaps this brother who's criticizing me and other brothers they are trying to live in both camps one of the camps is sinful the sinful Camp is brother brandom is infallible that's an evil spirit that would say that and maybe this precious brother doesn't even know he's going in that direction but he's basically trying to make every thought and opinion of brother brandom scriptural or infallible and that's idolatry that's wrong that's what Jeffersonville is doing so this brother who's criticizing is trying to live in the brother bram's infallible camp and then also brother bram's a human and we need to rightly divide what he said by the word of God now the only Camp that's right is this camp where brother randam is a human like he said and we must test him by the word as brother brandom said you can look up that exact quote brother randam says test me by the word test your denomination by the word and see who's right so we know brother Brandon when he points to the word of God will be right but not every single word brother bandam said was from the Lord I have numerous videos on that any honest person would admit that so we can't live in both camps we got to live in the camp of the scripture where the camp is rightly dividing the word of Truth as Paul told Timothy remember brother Ram said and he cares that you care 1963 he said I've always asked you to be careful how you're listening to me if there's anything that comes from the Lord it'll speak it it'll say thus sayith the Lord and remember there's no thus sayith the Lord on a ban against interracial marriage there is no thus sayi the Lord's statement on that so again some people just build complexes against certain subjects they're unwilling to learn they're unwilling to look at other quotes from brother brandham they're unwilling to look at scriptures so all we can do is love them and pray for them by the grace of God the final accusation was that Brothers like me are exalting our own intelligence above the word and again this is nonsense I don't have any intelligence of my own that's worth anything the only intelligence I have that would be worth anything would be what I've learned from the word of God by Revelation remember the word learn is not a bad word Jesus said you must learn of me in Matthew 11 so the word learn is just a synonym for revelation we learn through revelation we learn through unveiling and no I'm not exalting my own intelligence above the word because the word allows interracial marriage at least six times and there's probably more than that by the grace of God what I'm doing is I'm observing other quotes from Brother brandom on the same subject that this precious brother is ignoring for the sake of his complex or the sake of his reputation or the sake of just his dogmatic human nature I don't know brother Ram said God is some kind some nice some dogmatic God has all different kinds of personalities so I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God again I came across this quote this week from 1957 beautiful quote what God does is perfect and isn't that such a beautiful statement from Brother brandham whatever God does is perfect so we rejoice in that and as always I continue to pray for those who criticize me I can take it just just like I'm sure that brother can take criticism we all have to deal with it we all have to pray through it and express the brotherly kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ despite our little disagreements by the grace of God because again this topic does not pertain to Salvation it just pertains to marriage if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
