TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the Mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose this video is to teach what the Bible says about jewelry and tattoos to begin with the Bible supports wearing rings necklaces and bracelets within four guidelines but the Bible forbids the wearing of earrings and nose rings and also forbids tattoos in a few moments I'll share the scriptures that support these teachings four guidelines for jewelry while the Bible allows Christians to wear rings necklaces and bracelets God gives us four guidelines on the quality and amount of these accessories that we should wear first the time spent on our outward adorning should be minimal more time and emphasis should be spent on prayer which is spiritual adorning prayer will help you put on humility shamefacedness which is bashfulness reverence and sobriety which is self-control rather than our outward appearance what is valuable in the sight of God is a meek quiet and submissive attitude according to 1st Peter 3 verses 4 & 5 second the quality of jewelry should be average very costly and expensive jewelry should be avoided as taught by both st. Paul and st. Peter in 1st Timothy 2:9 and first Peter 3 verse 3 Paul said we are not to be adorned in gold or pearls or costly array Peter said we do not seek an outward adorning of the wearing of gold or putting on of expensive apparel third the amount of jewelry worn should be minimal as sobriety means self-control the haughty or prideful daughters of Zion lacks sobriety and wore 21 different outward accessories in Isaiah chapter 3 verses 16 to 24 ranging from fee ornaments all the way up to bonnets for their heads God assured those women that all their attempts to look beautiful would backfire and their end was a burning destruction and desolation as Isaiah chapter 4 described fourth and finally and with wicked devilish symbols or otherworldly images or foul language would not be pleasing to God and thus should be avoided at all times whatever we do in word or deed should all be done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Colossians 3:17 and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the Father by him scripture that supports rings necklaces and bracelets the biblical pattern for rings is that they were acceptable to God when they had a meaningful purpose such as in the cases of Mordecai Joseph and the prodigal son Mordecai received a signet ring from King Ahasuerus when he was given the power and authority of Haman's former position in Esther chapter 8 verses 2 & 3 Joseph son of Jacob was given a ring to wear when he was exalted to second-in-command in Egypt according to Genesis 41 verse 42 even our Lord Jesus is parable of the prodigal son included a ring being placed upon the prodigal finger once he was restored to his family today Christians are most likely to wear wedding rings to symbolize their unending vow of marital faithfulness to their spouse we believe God accepts Christians who wear wedding rings for this godly purpose wedding rings are sometimes condemned in Christian circles but there is no scriptural evidence for this idea the Bible offers support for the wearing of necklaces and bracelets in moderation necklaces were worn by Joseph and Solomon's bride in Genesis 41 verse 42 and Song of Solomon chapter 1 verse 10 necklaces were also used to represent the reward of obedience if children faithfully obeyed the instructions and laws of their parents the grace of God would be as a chain about their necks a corner proverbs chapter 1 verse 9 bracelets were worn by Rebecca upon her engagement to Isaac in Genesis 24 verse 22 God himself in the allegory of his rescuing and adorning of Israel as his wife was said to put bracelets upon her hands in Ezekiel 16 verse 11 scriptures that forbid earrings and nose rings there seems to be a clear and obvious scriptural pattern that teaches we should abstain from wearing earrings nose rings and getting tattoos which is this God does not want its people to pierce their skin shed their own blood or leave permanent marks or scars on their skin the only exception was in the Old Testament when God commanded Abraham and his seed to circumcise all their males but we know New Testament believers are not under the law of circumcision according to Galatians 5 verse 6 in Romans 2 verse 29 concerning earrings there are seven portions of scripture that described their usage in negative terms there are two scriptural portions that use earrings allegorically in positive terms two other scriptures reference earrings in ambiguous terms therefore I conclude that the wisdom of God would lead us to avoid earrings at all times because the negative witnesses in scripture greatly outweigh the positive additionally modern-day earrings require piercing bleeding and the scarring of the body which God never ordained for his obedient people I will now cover all scriptural witnesses about earrings and I'll begin with the seven negative witnesses about earrings 7 negative scriptures about earrings in Genesis 35 verses 1 to 4 Jacob was commanded by God to return to bethel and build an altar of worship jacob commanded that his family bury all their idols and earrings under an oak tree in shi Djem it seems Jacob's family had to bury all that they worshiped which included false idols and the fashion of wearing earrings before they could appear before the Living God at the house of God today we must be careful that jury does not become an idol in our lives a second negative witness about earrings was found in Israel after the exodus out of Egypt in the absence of Moses the backslidden idolatrous people of Israel broke off their earrings at the command of Aaron in order to build the golden calf which God abhorred according to Exodus 32 verses 2 & 3 it seems Israel received these earrings from the Egyptians during the exodus according to Exodus 3 21 and 22 and chapter 12 35 to 36 God's purpose though was not for Israel to wear the earrings but to use them to help build the Tabernacle in the wilderness according to Exodus 35 verse 22 later in Israel's exodus journey their armies obtained earrings as spoils of war and they dedicated them to the tabernacle of the Lord as an oblation and memorial according to numbers 31 vs. 48 to 54 so in both cases it again appears that earrings were never meant for everyday wear a third negative witness involved Gideon's interactions with the Ishmaelites in judges chapter 8 verses 22 to 27 scripture stated that the Ishmaelites were known to possess golden earrings but Israel was not known for that custom rather than rule over the Ishmaelites Gideon requested and received their earrings and formed an ephah that later became an object of idolatry in Israel note the similarity of idolatry associated with earrings and Gideon's ephod and the golden calf of Aaron in Isaiah and Hosea you'll find a fourth and fifth negative witness about earrings in both contexts God's two prophets record the earrings were a hindrance to women as a source of pride and even lustful seduction according to Isaiah 3:20 and Hosea 2 verse 13 the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings and I will visit upon her the days of Balaam wherein she burned incense to them and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels and she went after her lovers and forgot me saith the Lord Deuteronomy 15 verse 17 in Exodus 21 verse 6 provide the sixth and seventh negative witnesses about earrings these earrings were called all's in the King James Version and were strictly given to Jewish slaves who willingly rejected and their God given inheritance then thou shalt take an awl and thrust it through his ear unto the door and he shall be thy servant forever and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise then his master shall bring him unto the judges he shall also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost and his master Shou bore his ear through with an awl and he shall serve Him forever I believe the hall is the ultimate example that God has never wanted his followers to pierce their ears in any way as they required piercing through the skin producing shed blood these all's or earrings were designed to leave permanent marks on the ears of the Jewish slaves so that their choice to be a slave for life would be instantly seen by all it seems unnatural that God would ask his free people to wear earrings that were just like the earrings that went through slaves ears for there was always to be a difference between the holy and unholy according to Leviticus chapter 20 verse 26 this is why we do not believe God ever asked the Jews to wear earrings as an everyday accessory again the pattern for earrings seems to be that slaves and heathens used ear piercings while God's people may have possessed earrings as customary engagement gifts or perhaps even as a form of currency to barter but not for everyday wear two positive witnesses for earrings the two positive allegorical witnesses for earrings are found in proverbs 25 12 and ezekiel 16 11 Proverbs described golden earrings as representing a wise person correcting an obedient ear God himself in an allegorical story said he adorned Israel with earrings but we must be careful to keep both of these examples as allegorical and not literal especially in light of the seven literal examples of earrings being described in a negative way too ambiguous passages about earrings there are two other portions of scripture that were ambiguous about the usage of earrings which included Rebecca's engagement and job's restoration both Rebecca and Joe were given earrings as gifts but we are not told what they did with them it seems Rebecca's earrings were given to her as an engagement custom and not as an everyday accessory especially when we consider that her relatives in the next generation Jacobs family were commanded to bury their earrings before presenting themselves before God in his provided place of worship Bethel the idea that earrings were simply an engagement gift also connects back to God's adorning of his engaged spouse Israel in Ezekiel 16 11 job was given an earring by each of his friends after God restored his health and family in job chapter 42 verse 11 we cannot presume that God wanted job to walk around daily wearing multiple earrings especially since we know the haughty daughters of Zion were 21 different accessories that manifested their prideful lustful hearts furthermore we know God is more interested in the inward adornment than the outward this story of job provides more support that earrings were used by the followers of God as gifts of custom and perhaps currency or barter rather than for everyday wear nose rings concerning nose rings we do not have two or three clear witnesses that prove godly people wore nose rings and so we cannot teach that God allows them nose rings or nose jewels are alluded to in only two scriptures Genesis 24 47 in Isaiah 3:21 in the Genesis account the servant of Abraham put an earring upon Rebecca's face at the time of her engagement to Isaac which seemed to be a temporary nose ring since God has never asked his obedient people to pierce or permanently scar their bodies this act of putting an earring upon her face could have simply been a custom for her engagement we have very little information about this event and so we cannot use this one isolated scripture to allow our minds to believe that God wants all his people to wear nose rings in fact the rest of Scripture is a witness that God does not want us to wear nose rings because the rest of Scripture never teaches anyone to wear nose rings either the account of nose jewels in isaiah 321 Appy to be a negative example of nose jewels as the prideful seductive daughters of Zion were born with 21 different accessories one of those was nose jewels we already learned that the end of these prideful seductive daughters of Zion was destruction and desolation based upon these two accounts one that seems customary in Genesis and one that seems negative in Isaiah I can build a strong case that Christians should abstain from wearing nose rings tattoos and the Bible concerning tattoos the Lord God told Moses in Leviticus 19:28 you shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead nor print any marks upon you I am the Lord based upon this scripture and two other reasons we believe tattoos are forbidden for Jews and Christians first tattoos are never commanded nor approved of in the New Testament second the pattern of our holy God is that humans not pierce mark or cut their bodies in any way as tattoos permanently marked the skin the Bible gives multiple examples of heathens who cut their own bodies due to demonic possession first the prophets of bale cut themselves to no avail in the days of the prophet Elijah thinking that their false gods would hear their requests second the maniac of Ghidorah who is possessed with a legion of demons was known to cut himself with stones when a person willfully cuts their own body today it is a clear sign of some demonic possession or influence and the individual must repent and seek the deliverance through the blood of Jesus Christ the desire to get a tattoo would seem to come from a minor form of demonic influence as the Holy Ghost will not lead us to defile our bodies which are the temples of the Holy Ghost Christians who already have tattoos and feel the conviction of their mistake should first repent and then vow to never get another marking on their body believers should not feel pressure to spend a lot of money to remove their old tattoos because God is quick to forgive and ready to pardon sins instead the believer should try to cover up their tattoos especially if the images are immoral or evil in conclusion I hope these scriptures have proven to you God's perfect will for jewelry and tattoos if you have any questions about the scripture we've referenced please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
