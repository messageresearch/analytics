briefly for the baby dedication okay is my mic on mark chapter 10 this is our usually our verses when we read for uh baby dedication yeah i guess we can all stand by god's grace sorry about that i didn't say that earlier if you'd like to since we're here we'll just read our uh we'll read our baby dedication text and we'll just read our text for this morning i'd like to continue on the philippians series by god's grace so mark chapter 10 remember the scripture verse 13 mark 10 13 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when jesus saw he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god that's why we'll baptize them at early ages if they feel that to be baptized and that's why we'll let them come to jesus as early as possible praise god amen verse 15 for verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein we just love verse 16 and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them we just remember we've been looking at blessings and curses right yeah wonderful to see jesus blessing the little children now if you would go to philippians chapter one we'll just read our text there after that we'll pray have you be seated then we'll do the baby dedication by god's grace philippians chapter four i'm sorry philippians chapter four verse one philippians 4 verse 1. let's just read that verse together by god's grace and then we'll have a word of prayer and have you be seated let's read it on three one two three therefore my brethren dearly beloved and long for my joy and crown so stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved let's have a word prayer as we have our heads here heavenly father we've read your word we know lord this is the most important part of the service lord although singing is so important to drive away our evil thoughts or anything we're battling lord god it sets us free lord god uh transform our minds lord god we're so grateful but father we know the word has life lord god and we just pray god you anointed me to preach anoint everyone to hear lord god anoint me to hear as well and father we just enjoy your presence lord god today meet every need lord as those who press their way out to the house of god to hear from god we know judgment begins at the house of god so does blessing so does healing so does teaching so does correction all these great blessings here begin at the house of god we're happy to be gathered in your house and so father we thank you for this time this the scriptures we've read and father we also thank you for this uh child zion lord you've blessed us with as we dedicate him soon here so father bless your people i pray in jesus christ's name the saint said amen god bless you for being seated there praise god so i'm gonna invite my wife and my family up here and we'll have a word of prayer here for zion's dedication as they're coming i just want to read a scripture hebrews 12 22 the mount zion we looked at that a few weeks ago is the highest mountain in israel it's the mountain where jesus will reveal himself to the 144 000 on that mountain according to revelation 14. but the bible says it refers this this mountain also refers uh to the church of the firstborn so it refers to the born-again holy ghost-filled saints amen so this mountain peak here and that's exactly what happens with 144 thousand they get born again of the holy ghost and they get it on top of a mountain so it symbolizes the height of human existence right being born again not living to the things of the flesh but walking in the spirit praise god and the verse 22 says but ye are come unto mount zion unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel praise god so who do you have at this top of mount zion you have the saints right you have all the born again saints but most importantly you have jesus christ amen the mediator of that new covenant praise god so brother man could you get a few pictures of us the story behind his name is that my wife had a dream um she was expecting and in the dream she had the baby and handed the baby to me and said here's your son zion jesse so we didn't know what name you know and then my wife and so my wife said it was a very supernatural dream she woke up kind of shaking and really felt the presence of the lord so that's why we decided to name it zion and jesse i'm so grateful for another boy as well okay so we're very grateful so thank the lord jesus for his healthy arrival and let's just bring a blessing over him to the children let's pray for him please put your hand on him the church of you just join us and pray here heavenly father we give you praise honor and glory you're the father who formed each of us in our mother's womb oh god and we come to you now lord the father of lights you put the light of life in this child zion we thank you lord jesus for this life thank you lord for giving my wife a healthy delivery lord and pregnancy lord and strength to deliver father we give you glory honor and praise and father we just ask for that his life would be a blessing lord god his life lord god would glorify your great name lord his life would point others lord to that mount zion lord the general assembly of the firstborn may he be a member of that general assembly of the firstborn those who are born again of the holy ghost we pray that for this child lord for all the children all the children here lord god as we desire to see our children walk in the truth we have no greater joy than to see our children walk and the truth lord bless his life with health lord god with with uh understanding lord god with wisdom lord and and gifts of the holy spirit lord that he'll yield to them and lord be obedient to them lord and everything you place in his life he'll be faithful to it oh god and he'll be a true servant to you oh god i thank you for another son lord i thank you for every daughter you've given me lord truly lord you formed him in his mother's womb lord and he has a purpose lord may he find his purpose and lord live it for your glory help us to train and sharpen this uh this arrow lord god in our quiver lord god let us do our part and lord surely you'll do the rest we thank you for your power lord god in your grace give him love in the home lord god protect his life lord protect his mind and his body let it be used for you lord a true vessel for thy kingdom in jesus christ's name the church said amen you get a picture thank you praise the lord good to see you steven god bless you sir how you doing brother feel good that's a good testimony praise god so we thank the lord again we appreciate all the saints uh here in the house of the lord today i kind of felt led to look at uh the book of philippians again um studying on that uh so we like to minister on that philippians chapter 4. today i believe it's part 12 of the series and we'll get to that just as soon as we can by god's grace i have some notes and of course the holy spirit though can always direct me off my notes praise god you're in charge of that you're in charge of polling and getting whatever you have need of this morning praise god okay so i turned the mic on maybe the batteries are just dead i thought i charged him so let's see yeah let's see if that works praise god so we're grateful you know i'm coming off a busy weekend but it was a glorious weekend that we got to go home and uh to where we grew up and see my mother uh tuesday is her 70th birthday so we had all 23 grandchildren there with her and all six of her children yesterday and uh cam and i got to sing that spray bolt song thank you and we kind of customized the words the words of that song just really fit her life and it was just a wonderful time and each of the six kids got to say take five or ten minutes and say something about how uh my mother has impacted our lives and so it was just a great time so i'm just coming here refreshed i'm just as happy as you can be this morning i don't know if i could be much happier than i am this morning and then seeing the grams and everything and having jose back and seeing the saints you know i'm just real happy this morning so amen i hope you're happy as well by god's grace and that's what paul writes about in this book is about rejoicing rejoicing the lord always and again i say rejoice so thank you for all your prayers you know my simon as i said simon's been witnessing to my dad and starting to see some good fruits of that so we're thankful for that we're just going to trust the lord to reunite my parents praise god that's what we're still praying for asking god's grace in that situation okay so let's look to uh the scripture here today i like to look at philippians and continue into this we're willing tonight we'll finish i think we'll be able to finish the series on the mystery of god's will brother cam is reading that chapter with his family right now he said it's been a great blessing to his family so i'm very encouraged about that um and so it's nice to see the word of god having a great impact and helping people uh before i forget someone uh before i forget i know who it was but someone said our family an anonymous check in the mail this week there's no name on it just says god bless for a substantial amount of money so um whoever was maybe there's nobody here whoever it was i don't know who it was but thank you for your kindness and generosity god's word is true you know god's word is true god is faithful and if we honor him in our little humble ways then he certainly opens the windows of heaven and pours out blessings upon us i forgot to announce that wins i think we got the the letter wednesday and i forgot to announce it wednesday at church um but you know we're humbled you know just things like that just make me want to cry and uh so i'm not going to cry i'll cry at the end of the service while we're worshiping jesus lord willing we'll see but i just want to thank whoever had on their heart to do that may the lord richly bless you and uh we just want to extend it forward you know we just always want to be a help and be a blessing to other people as as we're able right we just as we're able the bible says good to those of the faith especially those of the household of faith so we want to treat and love another uh as best as we can by god's grace so philippians 4 we're working our way through the book i trust it's been a blessing to you it's been a great blessing to me uh so verses one to nine we'll try to get one to nine today i don't i don't know if we'll get that far but we'll try to let me set a timer here so i don't uh go too late i want to respect everybody's time by god's grace uh says lisa are you all traveling back today to home okay so i want to respect that i want to keep them here all day i want to watch my time uh so lord bless them what's that okay not too late tonight okay okay wonderful awesome what a blessing hallelujah we just you know it's a good good reminder we gotta enjoy our parents while we have them yeah i was listening to a preacher one time and he wasn't in the message but he noticed different people in his life that he met different ones he met ministered to they always they felt their lives were cursed until they honored their parents and so the point he was making the bible says honor thy mother and father right and then he he just noticed a lot of people let's say hundreds of people had struggles and curses in their lives like just things they couldn't get over and he advised them you know have you ever asked your parents you know forgiveness from things you've done against them and he said as soon as they would do that many of them would see victory in their lives because it's one of god's promises amen it's the first promise i'm sorry first commandment with promise right for a long life on the earth so just something to keep in mind there it's always good to honor uh parents praise god so the first section is the god of peace and we want to look at three thoughts here in verse one so verse one says therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for uh my joy and crown so stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved so you want to look at these uh three thoughts here dearly beloved uh my joy and crown and standing fast in the lord all right so i want to just uh you know as i read this here i remember back in chapter one and and scholars can recognize how this this letter is one of paul's most loving letters i think we're all familiar with some of his more rebuking letters right corinthians does that sound familiar to anybody uh galatians he said i might have to work with you to get born again you know he said i'm gonna have to birth you again uh he really bawled out a lot of churches but this is noted as one of his most loving letters and so as i was reading this you know he calls them my dearly beloved and i reminded me of earlier in the chapter earlier in the book rather where he said every time i remember this church remember he was only there for a short time maybe days maybe a week a couple weeks he wasn't there very long but every time he remembered that church that god used him to start he thanked the lord for it every time praise god my talk about talk about a victory talk about an impact these people had on his life just in a short very short period of time there was such an impact no doubt lydia was one of them right the philippian jailer was one of them him and his household were some of them that had such an amazing impact on the prophet's life that every time he thought of him he just offered a quick prayer do you do that sometimes you you run into somebody saying lord bless them can i just pray for you real quick that's why i prayed for my mom yesterday i said oh let's all come in here and pray i don't want to miss the opportunity to pray for people and ask god's favor upon their lives but the bible says always in every prayer mind for you all making requests with joy so the love that he felt for them caused him to have a feeling in prayer so as he remembered oh such great times in the lord it made him joyful as he prayed i hope my life does that to you i and your life does that to me when i think of you i get happy praise god i don't get discouraged i don't get uh angry i don't get bitter i don't get jealous i don't get selfish right we want to be joyful when we think about one another in the lord praise god or when you think of lymah our saints in life our friends in albion right our friends uh uh at sheffield oh it ought to bring such a joy to our lives to think about wow thank god for their testimonies thank god for all that they've done in our lives praise god amen so he said always in every prayer of mine and that's i don't know if he's being uh what do they call that i don't know if he's exaggerating but he says every prayer uh for you all making my request with joy is it possible every prayer he was uh remembering them each time he prayed it's possible especially for a prophet and what was he thanking god for for their fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now thank god church that we know the difference between fellowship with the world and fellowship in the gospel amen there is no fellowship like the fellowship in christ jesus amen amen in other words you'll never have a friend like a christian friend amen praise god you'll never have a trustworthy associate like you will have in the church of jesus christ amen you'll never have a more giving uh a person than you'll find in the body of jesus christ praise god amen because it's the fellowship in the gospel so paul was thanking god for the fellowship that they had what a wonderful testimony that these saints had and then i thought later and just again we're remembering the beginning of his letter where he said even as it is me for me to think of this of you all because i have you in my heart so paul had a special place he made room in his heart we seen that song make room right we need to make room for jesus right he's knocking on the door of our hearts we gotta let him in but also we have to have room in our hearts for other people if we don't have a feeling for somebody we got to pray until we do have a feeling for somebody praise god not just our friends and family but even our enemies praise god because jesus said you must love your enemies praise god amen but look the saints weren't just in his mind they were also in his heart which means his emotions right he he emotionally felt a connection to them uh because of the fellowship that they had in the gospel in other words the good news of jesus christ had such an impact on them that it impacted him and he could never get away from it brother banks he could never get away from remember he wrote this from a prison praise god he wrote it from a prison he wrote this letter from a prison and even in prison even in change he couldn't get away from the love of those holy ghost-filled christians amen so think about that even though he's in physical change he's spiritually free from those chains where many chains of bondage praise god and he changed the bitterness and he changed the fear he was free from those any chains of doubt about their love he was free from all that even though he was in natural chains he was free from the spiritual change because we know jesus breaks every chain amen he might let you suffer with a little physical chain right but he's going to set us free from spiritual change because he's the waymaker the chain breaker right we know there's power in one name the name of jesus amen amen hallelujah look at that because i have you in my heart remember jesus said from the abundance of the heart the mouth talks so your words we say about each other are very important because it shows if they're in our hearts in a good way or in a bad way right that's why no matter who whoever's against you whoever's against you say good things praise god let the love of jesus christ the bible say let the love of jesus christ rule your hearts amen right let the love of christ rule your hearts let love always rule have preeminence over everything praise god in other words remember love is benevolence right good will amen you want the best you want god's blessings you want to see people get deliverances and healings and victory and salvation and repentance you will you want the best for them which is god's word amen that's the only good thing there really is god's word amen so we thank the lord for that see he made a place in his heart for the saints in a special place in his heart praise god i think that's a beautiful testimony especially because only being there for a short time and then i just i i brought up the other examples when he used beloved in the letter he said wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling so that means while he was there brother bang for that short time they were obeying everything he was teaching them but he but someone must have come and told him later but maybe epiphanicists or some of those other brothers he mentioned at the end they must have spent time there and then reported back to paul in the prison saying they're actually more obedient now to what you taught them and that's how we should be as well right we we shouldn't decline in obedience we should increase in obedience right we shouldn't we shouldn't increase in slavery to sin we should increase in freedom of the spirit amen praise god amen we should increase in liberty praise god we should increase in joy and love and the fruits of the holy spirit and if not then we've got to check our ground and make sure our ground has no more thorns in it praise god amen make sure they're rooted up by the holy spirit let the great guard or jesus root up any thorns and bitterness because we should be bringing forth love their obedience grew after the prophet left so does ours amen hallelujah even though the prophet brother graham's off the scene our obedience grows amen we still love god we still believe god's word we'll hang on if nobody else will stand we'll stand for jesus amen so our obedience grows and that really shows you love the prophet of god when you obey his bible-based teachings praise god amen my wife says i do this all the time so i'm gonna try to be more aware of that always like this i'm trying to be more aware of my mannerisms here not to get in the routine you know now i wanted to say this uh paul used dearly beloved seven times now this is a good example church this is one of his well i'm sorry not this one the next one corinthians was one of his most scathing letters right but yet twice he calls him his dearly beloved so that proves church sometimes when you love somebody sometimes you got to rebuke him a little bit we hate to be on the receiving end but we ought to be thankful if we need it right right because he was their gospel father right he was the one that brought them the word a prophet of god so he calls uh seven times paul uses uh dearly beloved so dearly beloved avenge not yourselves now just picture the picture you're reading that for the first time there must have been people at the roman church that wanted revenge right if i could just get back at so and so if i could just get back they wanted revenge so paul he changes his word into matching oh my dearly beloved please can you can you kind of hear him like a fatherly type of figure oh children my dearly beloved children do not avenge yourselves don't don't try to get back at people let god be the avenger let god be the avenger right vengeance is mine saith the lord praise god so we can we kind of get that idea because remember paul said you have many uh your many teachers but not many fathers praise god so paul knew the first one who brings you the message is like the father in the faith right and so he said you have some thousand teachers but not many fathers and you in our lives we should be able to recognize when did the word first come to us praise god and recognize who did god use and make sure that person is their life is lined up with god's word amen amen so for us for me it's like brother brother simon right brother brother brooks brother cam i'm sorry brother brother craig some of those fathers that sat down and took the time to teach me the word of god i looked up to them like fathers you know i look up to them like i'm talking to brother brooks this week about that same thing we were talking uh just keeping prayer you know he lost his mother and also just keep him in prayer he said it's really hard on his sister ruby um so just keep him in prayer but he's doing good by god's grace uh i just want to notice that avenge that yourselves but neither give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord so you don't have to you and i don't have to worry about getting anybody back right you have to worry about making anything right now unless you did something wrong to somebody then you go make it right but paul nearly tells him god will fight for you amen amen god will fight your battles praise god someone hurt you someone offended you someone that's around god will fight the battles praise god and god will bring it to a head either in this life or certainly the next life to come now our prayers as christians is god help me to make everything right now on this side right because like the man says we don't want any trouble down at the river right we don't want we don't want there to be any questions and uh wondering or worrying about this or that uh god just bring everything uh to a head now so i can have everything no debts praise god no debts amen now i just want to give you the definition so what's the definition definition of dearly beloved my esteemed my favorite people right my worthy ones of my love dearly favorites he'd say avenge not yourselves see church we we don't want to be prideful like get bride pride cam was telling me about that yesterday i like that little rhyme because it's an evil sin right bride is an evil sin so i guess you know it we know where the apple of jesus's eye but we don't brag about it and we don't get prideful about it but we have to recognize the reason where that is because he's called us to a high calling we look at every other people's lives in our family how come they don't live higher how come they don't live higher it's because they're called to it but they've turned it down but you and i have received it and because of that paul calls us the beloved the favorite of god amen amen and if you don't remember that go to song of solomon and read all about that praise god read all about that how she the shoe of mine is the apple of his eye he said there's many women but you're my one and only dove you're my you're my garden and you're my locked and secure garment and you're sealing to me to no one else you're my one and only that's how we are where jesus is one and only praise god where is dearly beloved how many believe that that's what the scripture says where is favor not because uh not not not by pride but by the free moral response free more agency remember god can't force anybody to heaven nor can he force people to hell he has to give them free more agency so because you've surrendered your free moral ability because you said god i don't want my choices i want your choice praise god because you've done that uh surrender of responsibility and choice and you've prayed like jesus in the garden not my will but thy will be done because you prayed that then jesus looks on you as you're his favorite his dearly beloved like a husband does his wife there's many great women out there but there's only one mrs jesse smith she's my favorite you know one and only praise god that that's the picture it's a man he can only choose one you know there's all the choices right you can only choose one that's your favorite praise that's the one you want to have the rest of your life praise god and that's that's why we are he's called us not to just be a woman a woman a church a church a pride of bride but his favorite his one and only his true bride who's filled with the holy spirit amen who truly obeys all his word and wants to be dressed with his word amen because the bible said put you on the lord jesus christ amen put on the garments of righteousness praise god put on the clothes of holiness right physically and spiritually praise god put on the garments of righteousness amen hallelujah so i'm not calling myself god's favorite i'm just saying god said i'm his favorite you take it up with god if you disagree but if i don't act like god's favorite then you come correct me because i want to be god's favorite right just like i got to correct you if i have to right you have to correct me if you have to we want to be god's bride praise god that's what dearly beloved means you know sometimes we just read over right but clearly uh it's an esteemed calling to be the dearly beloved of christ jesus now here dearly beloved longboard nearly beloved so here he says it twice i think one in first corinthians and then one in second wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry okay remember we looked at this uh we didn't get to it but curses will come upon people for idolatry that was with dan and eve remember that man said people can have their names removed from the book of life we've looked at many different uh idols right we've looked at all the kinds of member iniquity the series we did on iniquity there's so many kinds of idols but here paul has to bring this fatherly tone down and say children you're my dearly beloved you're jesus's favorite or you might say my favorite he said you have to flee for my adultery i doubt you he so he said don't avenge yourself don't try to carry out your own wrath children don't do that your favorites of jesus don't do that it says and don't make yourselves idols don't let anything so make you so happy or or consume all your thinking like you do jesus give jesus the first place give him the highest praise amen hallelujah praise god give jesus the highest praise amen give him the best of your time the best of your energy praise god the best of your money right the best of your efforts give him the best of everything praise god because he's worthy of it amen so yes again as a father don't try to get revenge stay away from that love and please he said don't engage in idolatry now we know the closest thing for us would probably be like worshiping brother branham right like the churches uh out west right or a little bit further west in here we've gone on that over and over and over again they worship mother brandon uh but the other thing is not to worship ourselves right in that age where there's so much financial prosperity we cannot worship ourselves and our own families right and you'll see it if anything ever becomes uh above the lord you'll see it in your life and that the sin will manifest itself right and we've got to say god forgive me i confess my sins cleanse me with your blood and lord i give you first place again praise god amen right because it's the the spirit of this age remember the spirit of this age is uh to say i have need of nothing i don't need to study the word of god i don't need to sing songs right i don't need to go to church i don't need that and thinking they need something else right but that is our greatest need to be with god speech dearly beloved praise god amen to be with jesus and his people those that live at mount zion praise god the general assembly of the firstborn praise god that's who we want to be a part of amen that group that group has to get our attention and flee from idolatry now here's the other mention he says it uh again in second corinthians having therefore i think this is beautiful having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit perfecting the holiness and the fear of god again thank thinking that we excuse ourselves unto you we speak before god in christ but we do all things dearly beloved for your edifying so paul and his missionary team did you know there's women on this missionary team they weren't preachers but they were on his team just like jesus remember jesus had susanna and the wife of jesus and all those women getting the food and doing everything like that jesus had a team or paul had a team just like jesus did he said we we do all these things for your edification so paul's whole life was to build up the corinthian church right his whole life was to build up how can i strengthen the philippian church how can i strengthen righteous christ fellowship that ought to be our prayer right you can't church you and i cannot strengthen people in kenya and africa like we'd like to right i mean they can watch our services but how can we really edify them right it's very hard to do and so god set it up where god's not asking us really to edify them as much god's asking us to edify one another here with the love of god amen so we that's why we come to church how can i build up brother amen how can i build up my wife how can i build up the saints that's the attitude we need to have when we come to the house of god help me to be able to build them up also everything i do is for their edification not tear down build up praise god but i like this here so he says it again children don't have idols don't worship this world right don't let anything come between you and jesus don't take wrath as a father don't take wrath dearly beloved my favorites and my favorite people please separate yourself from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit he gets down to this really touching fatherly manner it says separate yourself from anything that will pervert your mind and your thinking separate yourself from that you're my favorite you're god's favorites right because these boss they're paul's favorite right and jesus is favored there is dearly beloved now i think we all can admit we have room to get rid of some filthiness in our minds and our thoughts right so anybody here has got the perfect thought life never thought anything bad all week and everything all just blessings thrown out of you all the time no doubt no fear no unbelief no no no no critical spirits right no lust no pride no just all love all the time well just so you know later on this chapter paul finishes the chapter by saying how to win the battle of the mind which we're familiar with but i think if we're honest we all need to revisit that like i was telling my brother or paul yesterday i was like i'm telling paul uh when ben and rod came in here just preached on angels right i felt so happy i was just so well that was for you and your wife's answered of your prayers right i just felt so happy and so that and that night with it bang i got home and i went looked up all the other all the other brother ben rod sermons i started listening to him i'm like especially the one about prayer back in 2016 in there and benjamin and austin are on the video you know i shared with austin he's like oh praise the lord he's trying to just pray for him he's trying to get get back with god but i thought wow i told paul i said we have such treasures we have the sermons that we have soared up on youtube the sermons you have on your phone for brother branham or from our church they're treasures and they have transformative power praise god amen so we need the reminding of the holy spirit to go back and listen to that because it helped my prayer life i went listen i'm listening to half of it it's like a two hour two half hour study brother ben did and it just stirred my prayer life back up and then the angels stirred us up you know just knowing and being aware of the angels of god and so i thought my what a what a blessed people we are uh and maybe may we yield to god washing away all of our filthiness of flesh and spirit that should be our prayer god to make uh make me an offering right wash away cleanse as the offering had to be washed right wash away any filthiness of my mind and my body and he talks to them like children favorites of god favorites of god cleanse yourself from any filthiness of mind and body yeah he says it to timothy said to timothy my dearly beloved son there it is my favorite son look at that and one of my daughters asked me daddy is it okay to have a best friend this morning she asked me is it okay to have a best friend or someone you our favorite uncle is that right i think it was yeah it was haley that's your idea and i was just studying on this i got up at 5 30 you know to study and everything at about eight o'clock she asked me yeah is it okay to have a favor i said yeah the bible says we can have favorites you know they're our dearly beloved right now we should show love to everybody but some people are going to impact you more you're going to have a unity with some people more than others right it's not that you don't love other people you love everybody if you're a real christian you love your enemies as we said but there's some people you just love more because they're your favorites that's what the bible says my dearly beloved son my favorite my esteemed son remember he went and circumcised timothy because it was going to help it was going to help the jews listen to timothy preach remember he wouldn't circumcise titus because they were false brethren that were just trying to get titus to join their false ranks their false doctrines so one case he did uh circumcise the brother another case he didn't based upon their motives and their objectives this is quite a quite a brotherhood here so he says my dearly timothy my dearly beloved son what beautiful words grace how many want god's grace mercy and peace if i just have those three things that's all i really need right there amen i can have god's grace his favor his mercy forgive me and my transgressions and his peace where i'm not at war with god i'm at peace with god i think i'd be one of the happiest gentlemen don't you the last time he says it is the philemon unto felenen our dearly beloved our our favorite are and highly esteemed brother remember this was the slave owner right who had the slave leave he got converted when he met paul and he sent the slave back and said philemon put his account all that he cost you put it on my account right and he had confidence that philemon uh would not hold it against his runaway slave that cost him we'll just say thousands of dollars right this man cost me a thousand dollars paul said put it on my account i'll pay the fee see because he he philemon was dearly beloved and when you love somebody you're able to help them out praise god you're willing to go the extra mile for them amen and we're still in verse one by the way chapter four i didn't think i thought i was going to get through this whole chapter uh today i don't think i'm going to uh let's finish verse 1. so he said my dearly beloved and long for he says my joy and crown so stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved now let's look at this here now i'm using albert barnes here brother graham references him in the church age book he was a truly anointed man of god with the spirit of the man age a true anointing of the holy spirit he said my joy he said the source of my joy so paul is saying this philippian church you're the source of my joy you make me happy now not just that their physical being right but their obedience to christ there it is right there and they didn't get less obedient they got more obedient as time went on that's why they caused paul joy these people are really dedicated to the word of god they really love the message they're really gonna uh allow the word of god to transform their whole lives year after year decade after decade praise god until their whole life is cleansed from filthiness they're really into christ amen amen they're really into it they're not pretenders they're not make believers they want to be fully transformed to be like christ he said that causes me joy when people are so hungry for christ oh glory amen he said you're the source of my joy he rejoiced in the fact they've been converted under him and in their holy walk and their friendship our chief joy is our friends that's what i said i got to see my family yesterday i'm just full of joy like that's my family right and this is the chief he says our chief joy is our friends i hope you feel the same but my chief joy is not my phone right right my chief joy is not the van out there that i really need to sweep out pretty bad i'll tell you that don't go looking in there after service okay oh sorry thank you sorry i got a little shortcut on there so the chief joy our chief joy in life is human interaction with souls that have been transformed by the spirit of christ amen it's our chief joy right it's our main joy in life is to be around people that have the love of christ that's true that's true and i've told you this before i love going to my family events and now thankfully at my side of the family i got some message believers on that side thank god it makes a lot easier now some of you don't so just keep praying just keep praying there's gonna be some hard family gatherings right as far as there may become battles but i don't know any greater weapon than god's love and if you go and just church we're coming up to thanksgiving and christmas pray before you go to those family fellowships pray right pray and ask god to give me a word give me an opportunity give me a chance to share your love with somebody like yesterday my brother was thanking me uh he and i talked on the phone uh early this year so back in january february he was having trouble with his boss and uh i said i said can i just pray with you right now we prayed and then he said uh months later nothing had changed he said so they had their annual meetings brother john would probably know about that you know you got to have a meeting with your boss or your supervisor every year and my brother said at that meeting the boss did something totally out of cater he said well what do you feel what's on your heart what do you like about my leadership he said what do you not like about my leadership i remember we had prayed for things to change and they weren't changing and then my brother told me after that prayer god opened up that door and he said you might not like what i'm going to say boss but here's what i think and he said their relationship has totally changed now here's a millionaire right he's probably a multi-millionaire he's single he don't have a wife and children so he spends all the money on himself bro that's how i tell him pause it man he needs to have children and he can lose some of his selfishness that's what happens when you have children right man can i get amen but with each one it's another part of you i got eight now right so eight parts of my selfishness are gone hopefully i tell you i still battle like crazy i can just overcome defeat jesse smith right the the sin in my members but he was saying what a change all we did was talk about it and pray and then god put it on the man's heart to just open himself up for criticism and for some honest discussion and he said my boss has totally changed his cut he said he said tapped his face said his countenance is totally changed i thought wow that's the power of prayer right there the power of prayer might have to wait a few months you know i have to wait a few years put it into the nail scarred hands put it into the faithful hands of jesus christ amen give it to the hands of the one who's gone in the fires greater than the ones you've gone through praise god he's walked through the fires of calvary right the fires of affliction praise god amen he's walked through those fires he's been through harder battles than we have if we put it in his hands and trust in him and wait upon him the bible said our strength will be renewed like the eagle chief joy is our friends the chief happiness of a minister of the gospel is in the pure lives of those to whom he ministers to that's so true hallelujah amen thank you jesus that's nothing but the truth now it's interesting i went looking for that scripture we're going to get to it next about no greater joy well i typed in the same words and i come across a similar thought in the in the second epistle i'd forgotten about i rejoiced greatly that i found 10 million dollars is that what he said no i regret re rejoice greatly that i found of thy children walking in the truth so paul was not he was not making things up he was not giving people lip service his real joy his greatest joy in life was to hear about christians obeying the word of god and faithfully living the word of god that was his greatest joy remember he had access to all the money through gamalia and the sanhedrin council i mean he could he had a license to go arrest people just breaking down people's doors i mean he had he had all the power right maybe not all the money but he had all the power you could ask for right that's like police officer power you know that's like judge power the power to take people's freedom and their lives but yet he said my rejoicing is that i found my children walking in truth sometimes i'm sure john and bang the other way johnny sometimes there's those moments where your children are maybe singing together or worshiping god and that's those moments like you try to catch them right obeying the lord that's the time i just whis pull out my phone real quick and try to record it you know it's like i caught them they're not arguing there's no discord it's just love amen and that's where that's where you have the greatest joy when you find your children walking in your truth doing what you ask them to do he said i rejoice greatly as we have received a commandment from the father so see before you can obey you've got to have the commandments right that's why we need to come to church and lord what do you want to tell me what have i missed has there been any commandments i've neglected give me your commandments that i can walk in them and that will cause great rejoicing amen it will but see it stems from first having the commandment the word of the lord thus saith the lord the word of god receiving it walking in it and rejoicing greatly praise god like recently i was talking to brother craig uh on an email and he's like or just whoever it is you know we haven't talked we haven't seen each other for years uh but just even brother brooks the other day we were talking about that just how uh they hear about our ministry right they hear about our lives and and they they say good things right and that's such an encouragement like uh that's what i want to do because many times how many ever you feel alone sometimes anybody ever feel alone sometimes you know satan tries to isolate us and get alone but even in those times that we're alone we're really not alone because jesus is with us praise god so when those like we sing that song in those lonely hours if we can learn to rejoice in those hours and thank god for those hours and talk to god in those hours it'll keep us faithful praise god keep us joyful about what god's called us to do and then people will hear about our testimonies praise god it's in those lonely hours where we've got to receive the commandment walk in the commandment so he had great rejoicing that he found them i love to find my children obeying god's word i sure do i know you do i know moms do too right i'd love to catch him obey in the word of god that's what that's what john felt here this is john now now here's the one that we're very clear this is actually a beautiful just a beautiful beginning of the chapter i'm just going to read it because we got time we always got time uh third john 1. it's just so beautiful i mean all right verse 1 the elder unto the well beloved guys whom i love in the truth boy paul this man was full of love but then he's sending out love on gaius he sent out love on the corinthians the romans man this guy's full of love he loved everybody praise god always talking about your dearly beloved titus i love you timothy i love you i love all these people because he had the lover inside of him jesus christ the lover of his soul he said beloved so he loves gaius and that he loves the truth beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospers for i rejoice greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in the look at that that's beautiful the brethren came and testified how are the saints doing in akron right how are the saints doing up there in sheffield how the saints doing up over there in michigan right brother paula fontaine's church since brother john's there now how are the saints in albion doing you know you want to give a good testimony praise god in other words we want to live so people can give a good testimony about us amen like when that didn't make you feel good i don't know if you got you guys heard the sermon on wednesday but bender rod's mom came she's 84. and when she left she's like wow that church is so full of love she says i wish i could have lived closer to that church rather than have all the miracles and have a a cranky unloving church i'd rather have a loving church praise god but then god blesses us with miracles like bangs god using bangs faith there for his dad's healing praise god but i'd rather church i'd rather have that strangers can walk in here and you smile and shake their hand say i love your special god bless you nice to see you today and she walks out telling me can i take some of your little daughters home back to southern ohio i'm like no you're not taking my time but that that's what i want we want we want people to come here and then testify about the love of god at our church so i'm grateful i'm grateful for that see the brethren came to john and they testified of all the the truth that the believers were walking in even as thou walkest in the truth i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth can't you can't get any more joy than to see people think about how we're since we're on your dad think how happy we were when god healed your dad just totally brought him from the valley of the shadow death back to full strength in life sister who can you imagine think how happy we were amen but yet we're happier if you can walk in the truth praise god right right i'm happier that you are walking in the truth praise god and i'm walking the truth that is our greatest joy that each one of us can walk and obey the truth and be obedient and love god with all of our hearts that's the greatest joy there could be no greater joy than that to hear that the saints are loving god they're growing in grace they're obeying god more they're loving the friends of god they're praying for victory they're praying for souls they talk to jesus in prayer all the time they sing to jesus day and night no greater joy than that you know we think well we'll have the greatest joy if we have the biggest church or the newest church how about that get a paid parking lot like they always said in our denomination we're gonna get in the main parking lot that's not the greatest joy there is that's not the greatest joy your greatest joy is to hear that wow the young people really love god one of them got baptized hallelujah no greater joy than that praise god our brother is doing this in his family in his home and being more devoted to the house of god oh hallelujah thank you jesus i did the father is leading the children in a bible study the father's reading he's doing devotions with his children the mother's doing devotions with her children praying for them oh there's no greater joy than that praise god then to know that the children walk in the truth because they've been given the commandment praise god i'm gonna do it my time okay yeah i went a little bit longer because of the dedication beloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brother and to strangers so look faithfulness so how how is someone walking to the truth they're just being faithful right they're just constantly consistently obeying god's word faithfulness and john said i have no greater joy than to see a faithful group of people they're my beloved right that know the truth they've received the commandment and they walk in the commandment they obey the commandment no greater joy than that sometimes yeah i'm always reminded but the desperate bride tells me he pastored for a number of years then god you know led him to give the church back up and he's not pastor but his famous his favorite saying he ever gave me brother bank was he said i've learned as a pastor that i don't get excited about uh like when uh when uh he said i don't get excited about uh um big crowds he said i get excited about the people that come back faithfully every service amen i thought man that blew my mind like forgive me jesus right because we want to see growth and we want to see all these things but he said i've learned i don't know what a word of wisdom that was yes i've learned to rejoice when i see people faithful right because there's no greater joy than the scene one life transformed truly transformed to christ and just think about that getting daily victory you can depend on them they're going to get the victory they're going to come to the house of god and pray and sing and support the church because they're daily conquering through christ jesus amen they look into victory not just once in a while victorious but every day victorious praise god christ is living through them constantly these are my favorites they're my favorites too praise god those that faithfully serve jesus christ my fear and beloved thank you jesus praise god see when others testify about you that's when you know but i should say that's an encouragement to know that god is working through my life and take it not as a private way but take it as a just an encouragement right that oh my must be i must be on the right path i must be on the perfect will of god if people are testifying that i'm walking in the truth that i'm being faithful to the things of god then i have no greater joy than that praise god that i walk in the truth and i obey the commands so i'm still that just you know i'm still at 47 minutes hard to believe right hardly now let's look at the crowd real quick i think i can get a few maybe one or two more scriptures here now he said let me turn back to philippians here i want to get this idea on crowd thank you for your patience therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for you we didn't even look at the long four part right we didn't even look for that this is how you long to be with them i can't wait to see all of you on wednesdays and sundays i can't wait to see you think how sad would be if it was just my family and i you know we'd be happy to have our family but we just can't wait to see god's people in the house of god you long to be together in the house of god to sing god's praise to worship him to honor him to learn from him from his word look at the scripture says but we brother being taken from you for a short time in presence not in heart so you can you you know when someone really loves you someone really loves you when you feel like they're with you all the time that's what paul was saying i'm not there but it's like i'm there right he says i'm present but he said he said i left you for a short time presence but not in heart in other words my heart is always with you i'm always praying for you i'm always thinking about you that's what he said endeavor the more abundantly to see your face with great desire i just can't wait to get there can't wait to see god's people can't wait to see the faces of the saints wherefore we would have come to you unto you even i paul once and again but satan hit us now look at this paul's admitting there's times that missionaries want to do work but then satan hinders them right there's times you and i want to do something good but satan hinders us did paul quit what do you think de paul do you think paul quit and gave up missionary work no he probably said we'll just put another put another round of ammunition there fire it again one of these times is going to go off praise god my brother i'm saying taking sides with jesus right he said i don't know what i'm doing right now so i'm just putting more ammo in and pulling the lever and he said one of these times it's going to go off praise god see there's going to be times satan hinders us satan even hindered the prophet of god right he hindered paul he hindered some of his brother rams trips but he didn't give up he kept resting on he kept obeying the truth he kept being faithful and god honors the faithful he said wherefore we would have come unto you once again the satanist for what is our hope our joy or crown of rejoicing so a crown here is not like well i'm a ruler like we talk we we often talk about kings and priests which you are you're ruling over brother man says lust the devil hell sin and the world you are supposed to be kings over all that and you are if you're filled with the spirit of god or if you're overcoming in sanctification right you're starting to get victory over that but this is not the crown he's talking about he's about the crown of rejoicing okay so he's talking about what is our hope our joy our crowd are not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming for ye are our glory and joy so he's talking about the presence of jesus christ coming look at verse 19 you are our crown in the presence of the lord jesus christ so paul says when we get to the meeting in the air praise god he said you are my crown of rejoicing so paul is going to be rejoicing oh the saints at philippi they made it they overcame they made the rapture praise god they made the first resurrection amen and that rejoicing and paul's heart will be a crown of uh authority on his head praise god it'll be his it's his crown of rejoicing in other words that that's the that's the rejoicing that that god vindicated his ministry that his ministry fulfilled its purpose praise god that the saints that he preached you received it believe it and let the gospel work through their lives amen it's a crown of rejoicing in the presence of jesus christ how do we think brother abraham is going to be shouting with rejoicing with the crown of rejoicing right when he presents the bride right to jesus that's what he's talking about he said you people are my crown of rejoicing because you've received the gospel at the presence of jesus christ that's gotta be his rapture coming it has to be his rapture coming for ye are glory and joy so what did paul get the most joy out of life seeing people obey the message of the hour are you with me there was no greater joy than to see the word preached and the word he taught he labored and taught him the full counsel of god there was not nothing made him happier and he said nothing will make me as happy as knowing that the people received it and then we all meet jesus who's the author of all of it at the rapture praise god there's no greater joy than that there's no greater reason to shout or praise god or than to see people that really love it and really want to live it for his glory praise god give me a few more minutes give me seven more minutes that's my hour okay give me some more minutes now verse one he says so this just i can't get through verse one hardly today therefore my brother dearly beloved long for my joy and my crown see people should make you happy not things people make us happy our crown is a crown of rejoicing god validates our life as we see our life's efforts are not in vain and people receive it and live it and accept it to praise god and meet us in the air with jesus he said so stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved so he says it twice he starts with dearly beloved and he ends with dearly beloved oh my favorites in other words therefore my favorites and long for my joint crown so stand fast in the lord my favorites you know why god repeats things so you don't miss it right jesus barely barely right verily verily i say unto you he's repeating it for emphasis and he's repeating my favorites you're my joy my crown stand fast my favorites right he's trying to emphasize that a double emphasis that you are god's chosen because you receive his word you have to do something for eternal life right you have to do something or else everybody's gonna be saved you have to do something it's surrender it's repent right the gospel john the baptist came preaching the gospel repent for the kingdom of god is at hand jesus repented or preached says repent the kingdom of god is near amen amen repent surrender your choices surrender your your free will and accept god's will and do god's will the mystery of god's will so stand fast in the lord he said so stand fast in the lord my favorite my esteem so stand fast in the greek means to stand firm to persevere to persist to keep one standing well that means someone's trying to get you to fall right someone's trying to get you to fall someone's trying to get you to not walk in the truth and bow down to a lie right he said stan he said didn't say bow down tell these people bowing all these democrats well republicans are about the same thing right most of them right they're bowing down to these organizations and bowing down paul said stand praise god stand for the gospel stand for truth hallelujah stand for it be firm persistent live for it be an example for it persevere that means you have to fight i'm so happy i'm so happy i love you you're my joy you're my joy i don't i'm never happier than you thinking about you guys now stand keep it up praise god stand persist in the message of god in the message of the hour now this reminds us of ephesians 6. he said you're you're battling all spiritual principalities and powers right you're battling a wickedness in high places you're battling demon powers all the time trying to get into your mind right trying to get you to tap the wrong thing right try to get you to say the wrong thing at the water cooler trying to get you to think the wrong thing and eat the wrong thing right all kinds all kinds of they're trying to destroy us fully right those demon powers but paul said put on the armor of god the whole thing praise god amen believe all the word amen put on all the word of god that you can stand and he said having done all to stand it's about doing what we've been told praise god it's about doing we're not bowing we're standing because we're doing what paul tells us to do to take a firm stance on it to stand there having done all do everything in your power remember diligently obey the word of god faithfully obey the word of god do all that you can to stand against the wickedness in this hour hallelujah let me go to verse two i'll have to stop after that yeah this is this was one of the most striking verses when i first started studying this remember church this church yeah i got here paul's closing this letter and he now just breaks into an individual problem of the church he says unity between two sisters was one problem in their church and remember this is a church that started through a purple selling uh sister who had a lot of income she's a pretty rich lady see god saves the poor and the rich praise god and a prison earthquake this is a church that started with this rich woman lydia and then a prison earthquake a philippian jailer these were some of the founding members of the church you see and he's finishing the letter he says i beseech yodius and beseech syntacky that they'd be of the same mind in the lord oh you mean he's not he's not telling them uh to pray for more prisons to be shaken down with earthquakes he's not doing that now you could have right you could have said pray for miracles i'll tell you this would be a real miracle too to have sisters and one according to the church and brothers and the brothers said not just sisters i'm not preaching all the sisters i preach on all of us praise god but in this case the church that started with these mighty miracles and a rich woman and the miracles in the he said before i finish this uh i beseech now that means beg i beg i beg you and i beg synthetic that they be of the same mind in the lord so it shows they had different thinking they didn't both obey the holy spirit they had different thoughts about the things of god and he calls them out by name don't be discouraged if your name ever gets called out i was on the receiving end this week one of the brothers i debated made a whole hour 13-minute video about me and how i'm dishonest i wrote back and said i think you misunderstood me i'll write back later when i got time to deal with it love you and god bless you that's the first video i've had made about me wasn't the best one i think it's a misunderstanding but look he's saying there's two sisters in your church this church started supernaturally they started supernaturally but they got common problems anyone know what that's like you see supernatural miracles in your life but you got pretty simple common problems anybody anybody know what i'm talking about there's my hour a church so supernatural in its origin as paul finishes the letter as far as we know this is the last time he communicated with them as far as we know one of the things he brings up is can we get these two sisters to think the same way about god's word now look uh the writer says he avoids favoritism because he says beseech before both of them right so someone so he knew they might have mind battles you know those sisters that would have my battle so he says i beg eudius and i beg synthetic i'm begging both of them see there was wrongs on both sides right i'm begging both of you sisters can you be in the same mind of the lord can we start thinking the same way instead of conflict and butting heads and butting heads and butting heads can we just live in peace uh who thinks this was the holy ghost filled church you only go spill people sometimes butt heads for the day yeah sure did oh a prophet wouldn't worry about you know just some sister's problems in the church you know a prophet a real prophet would because he knows a little lesson leavens the whole church it's important to be able to look each brother in the eye shake their hand and say i love you in the lord it's important it's a board member look that sister and i say love you the lord god bless you but these sisters they didn't have the same mind instead of instead of being in unity they were in battle remember this is the letter of the mind remember it's the letter of love joy ten times paul mentions the mind ten times mind the same thing sit think the same thing ten times it's so important church what we feed our minds praise god what we think about so important how we think about conflict i'm not going to get to the coach and brother brahma said he said he didn't you know in 1959 he didn't want to build he didn't want to add on to the tabernacle he said but the rest of the church did so he said i threw my idea out of it and let's go ahead and build the church or renovate it you know they just go on a new section of the ground tabernacle and this is one of the scriptures he quotes about uh whatever's pure think on those things right whatever's holy he talks about unity of the mind i think there's times all of us need to throw some of our ideas out and the church said i think all of us sometimes are so we all can have our own opinions we're so opinionated we can be so dogmatic that sometimes god will use it to show us how prideful we can be at times and we all have to learn that sometimes our opinions aren't always right and god can work opposite of our opinions on how the church should go is that true god did the opposite of what brother branham wanted right he allowed him to renovate and then he and then in 1963 god hiding himself in simplicity he says oh the tabernacle looks so beautiful you remember that listen to that if you haven't listened to that lately he just praises the brothers and how they've added on in such a beautiful but he was dead set against it but he he was able to he said sacrifice my opinion for the good of the church so we can be in one mind let me just finish that thought well let me finish with that i actually was going into the friendliness part let me finish that now one thing that draws me here is you all now he's back in jeffersonville that's right you know lots of friends i'm so i'm grateful if i just counted especially people i know maybe a million around the world it was once estimated by some probably a personal knowing of about 10 million people but there's something about home about certain people everybody's got that there's special people in your life right he's met millions of people but he said there's special people in your life that's why it's okay to have favorites as long as you would do as long as you the way you treat them you'd be happy to treat the others who aren't your favorites with that much love too help them out you know i believe that if there isn't then why is our wife special to us that he uses a common example your white in other words brothers your wife should be your favorite person right right brothers i thought i'd hear some more amens on that one just kidding it's okay to have special friends just get it it's okay to have best friends you know i believe that see our wives our husbands it's special and you have had they have that with friends there's something other that you just love to meet with them and just talk with them there's little spots would you have around someone you just love to be around you got those people what is it it's because of their atmosphere that they create around them so if you want to be friendly if you want to have best friends if you want to have people if you want to be somebody's favorite create that atmosphere right create love create care and concern show the love of jesus christ praise god create it because you can do it you can create it remember paul says these are the people you're supposed to love the most your best friends should be around here at least some of them not maybe not all of them but your best friend should be your local some people in your local church because you're with them all the time he says you've been in nice people but yet you couldn't stand to be around them it's their atmosphere look at that the man said sometimes they're nice people but it's hard to be around them it's their atmosphere it's love so in other words some people don't create love they create criticism they create quarrels but some people create love and you just love to be around them and it's okay if they're your favorites okay everybody's got special people he says love goes out deep it does great things and jesus christ is the love of god let's stand to our feet i'll stop right there the bible said a man that hath friends must show himself friendly and there's a friend that sticketh closer to the brother that's our lord jesus christ musicians if you'll come i hope you enjoyed the first two verses of philippians 4. i think there's so much truth the word of god is so rich it's so deep it's so interconnected let's bow our heads here for a moment as we pray church think how you are god's dearly beloved are you grateful to be god's dearly beloved [Music] is it's only god's grace that he loves me so that he esteems me as a child of god [Music] church we're so grateful that god has made
