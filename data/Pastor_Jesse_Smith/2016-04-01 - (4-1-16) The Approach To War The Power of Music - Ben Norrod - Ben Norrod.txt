[Music] my that he would [Music] who [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hey man what a story that we can tell with that story from the old rugged cross amen certainly appreciate the lord in his grace tonight don't you please god amen i'm glad my wife got to come with me and she uh as you can see my children aren't here and part of the reason of that is because they uh they got to grammy's house and grammy wouldn't let him go and uh we wanted him to come but it's a little bit of a little bit of an upset on that part of it if i tried so i told my mom i said well you know she's gonna be 80 80 this year isn't she so you know she may not have too many years with him and i said well just you just hold on to him for a little while so anyways we're glad to be here zach let's turn to second chronicles chapter 20 verse 20. please i want to uh i want to speak tonight this might be a little bit of an odd subject for some especially those that would consider you know to be an evangelistical theme of some sort i i don't really consider myself too much of an evangelist sometimes because some of the themes i use aren't necessarily what other people consider evangelistical but i i feel like when the bible said that we're supposed to reprove and rebuke with all long suffering and doctrine then evangelists ought to have something to say so then sometimes i have a tendency not to just preach on getting people they all are getting saved and things but sometimes i'd like to try to dig in and deal with things that people really live with and live out you know i like to catch them areas where they're struggling and having problems trying to figure stuff out preach that way because i found a long time ago that you can know all the mysteries of god you know all the seals the thunderstruck and all the things and thank god for every bit of that but if people don't know how to pray and how to love all of this so by god's grace we're glad we're glad amen that we've got a chance to be able to look at these things amen so i want to speak tonight if the lord will help me now it's highly possible many several years ago many times i had our first meeting that i might have preached on music at some point in my travels to uh folks here around the message but the lord has shown me some different things as i went along and uh this is all just kind of a brand new thing that the lord has given to me on this music and i want to share um this this thought with you tonight i want to call it the approach to war the approach to war the power of music and the benefits of music and uh the older i get the more long-winded i get so i'm glad i'm preaching a bunch of young people that way you won't be too quick on that 45 minute tonight i'll probably go over it just a little bit as far as that's right amen second chronicles 20 verse 20. we use this thought out at your brothers down there napoleon and uh i'll tell you the lord really really blessed that i felt and i seemed like everywhere i've gone in in the message preaching this in different churches seemed like the lord's really done some great things in it one pastor come to me with tears in his eyes and he said this is the thing my church has been lacking in for ain't no telling how many years he said we didn't even know what it was he said until you brought this message on the music so i i just trust that somehow whatever the benefit would be here the weekend for the little church here at bride fellowship that the holy spirit will give that to you watch here now let's look they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem believe in the lord your god so shall you be established believe his prophets so shall you prosper now years ago we used to call this 20 20 vision chronicles 20 20. of course their version of it was is believe the prophets you got 20 20. but i said that's only one eye you got to believe the lord that's the other eye that the lord the prophet put together now you've got 20 20 vision you can see real clear what hour you're living in amen don't you think so amen we sure need that and when he consulted with the people now here's the thing that really troubles a lot of people around the ranks he appointed singers unto the lord that now you think that this man of god if he had anything that he could have appointed surely wouldn't have been singers certainly would have been musicians and music and things of that nature but it was it was he absolutely appointed singers unto the lord why that should praise the beauty of holiness now watch this as they went out before the army and to say if you're reading there praise the lord exactly right for his mercy endureth forever and when they begin to sing and to praise i know message people have lost that whole thing right there because to them coming to church is a staring contest with the preacher but when we come to the house of god we're supposed to worship god [Applause] we're supposed to worship we're supposed to praise and we're supposed to sing but he said i can't carry a tune in a bucket god likes your tune god likes your bucket he wants you to sing he wants you to worship if you sing bad just don't sing loud that's the key of it yeah just kind of blend in with everybody else and as they begin to sing and to praise watch the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon god said y'all are doing such a good job praising and worshiping you just keep doing that i'll fight the battle over here you don't even have to worry about too much he said just keep on worshiping keep on praising and while you're worshiping i'll fight the battle i'll ambush the devil over here on this other side oh my that'll make you happy find your happy fire's broke that's all there is to it watch here in the paradox paragraph and the man said you know there's something about song that's got power in it he said we all know that we're aware of that he said look at the army when they would sing songs and play the music do you know that the approach to war in the army of god is first by music the singers went before the ark rejoicing and singing then come the ark then come the battle that's right so that's the right approach music first rejoice in singing ark then the battle that's the right approach that's exactly what we believe you taught amen let's let's pray together and ask him to help us can we heavenly father i so thank you lord jesus for this opportunity to be in your house again oh god i'm a poor sorry excuse of a preacher of any kind lord to try to bring something to help these people lord you know in my own abilities i i just don't have anything humanly that i could offer to these your children the purchase of your blood my lord god i would be a miserable person to try to put my ideas my way is out there before such blessed people so lord i'm praying that you'll come tonight and you'll take this little gift that you placed in me lord it's just a little insignificant piece lord it's a tiny part no doubt father but it is a part of you it's something from your divine nature that you place down inside of me that helps me get out of the way so that you can use this body this mouth these eyes and my mind and things to be able to speak to your children lord i'm sure many of them are standing here tonight very very needy i know many of them probably got needs in their life lord god i have needs as well don't forget me as well lord as i raise my hand to tonight ask you to help us to bless us and to give us your courage and your faith lord to approach your word lord knowing that every time we take the bible that the devil is going to come after us give us protection from thy spirit that we can gird ourselves with the armor of the living god and be ready for any fight that satan would take to us lord as we look over the word tonight we're asking that you would bless it that you would help every person in here to be receptive to everything that you would say to us tonight we are ready to hear from thy throne we're asking tonight that the holy spirit will take total control over all of this here tonight over me over them over every little part lord jesus and father the progressions of the service if you tarry from tonight tomorrow and sunday morning we're asking that you be mindful that you would help strengthen us once again in jesus name for thy service amen and amen god bless you you may be seated amen it's so good to be able to read the word of the lord and to say amen to the things of god amen now for just a little bit i'm going to i'm going to give you just a kind of a foundation as to where it is that i want to go on this about music now mind you that the elements of music as we could break them down are composed of scales and notes and scale tones and different types of musical qualities that people could break down and teach to others but what i'm talking about is more than just being able to teach a c scale or a g scale or something like that or being able to show someone on the piano how to run a certain chord or a chord progression but what i'm talking about is the effect that gospel music much less you know ungodly music for that matter that it has upon the human body and what it does to our spirit what it does to our soul now we know many times in reading what we've read here tonight that you'll hear people say well brother ben now i'm not too much on music when it comes to church i like to get to the word well unless i'm mistaken what we read here in ii chronicles 20 20-22 that is the word am i wrong brother jesse i'm pretty sure that's the word so in other words what they're saying is they're saying then we want to skip the word to get to the word so by doing so they got it in their mind that this is not a part of the word but it is it's actually a significant part of our walk with god now i realize that in message churches and i'm using message churches because we are a message people that follow brother man's message and follow the minister william branham we know how brother branham established to us that uh church orders we say the order of the church and i i was talking to a brother just the other day who was relating to me that they was out on holiday somewhere in other news they were out they thought they would stop by a church and they went by a certain baptist church and some state somewhere i think someone in the south and as they went in there they said they accidentally got into the contemporary service thinking it was the traditional service and the contemporary service was a rock concert and they were singing rock and roll songs and wild guitars and all these type of things and they said well you know we looked around everybody's blue jeans and here we are in a certain time pretty dress and all that he said we realized he was in the wrong one but you see that's the way as i'll show you in a little bit that's the way the devil has worked is to get rock and roll in these evil things to blend it over and put it into the church of the living god because the devil knows the power and the the the uh the the backing and the substance and the uh how would you say the power even uh the authority that you could say that is behind behind a musical talent behind a musical gift and there is an ability in some of these worldly people out there we know that when we hear their songs and hear them singing in the restaurants and things there's a little bit of a pull there that kind of distracts you sometimes obviously backslidden you want to listen what they're saying but there's a little pull there why because there is a genuine gift of god down inside of those people but they're using it for the devil's glory and not for god's glory now you realize that a person that is gifted in the way of singing and music and so forth like that they have a special quality that god has given to them to be able to do things on the music and in the singing and such to be able to help the body of christ to become freer to become looser to give their bodies and their minds and all that a break as it were so that they can kind of enter up into this healing part of the way that music works on the human body now we realize that a person that truly understands the powers of music and understands the way that music is put together that music is more than just putting chords together and putting chord progressions together but it is actually entering into an anointing or a spirit or creating an atmosphere of what a person is listening to i'm sure many of you that come from the world whether john there myself brother uh brother jesse different ones of us that used to listen rock and roll and those type of things back in our center days i used to be want to be a rock and roll star myself you can imagine that i'm thankful god crushed that dream a long time ago as could you imagine me with my balling head in my potbelly out there with a guitar in my hand carried on like some of them guys i just wouldn't look good at it they wouldn't want it that way no how but i remember i used to listen to some of the things and the music would be so gripping that it wouldn't be so much that the tune as it were that i was hearing but it was the atmosphere that i would get into and as i was in a store early this morning and i heard him playing 50s type music over the radio i got to thinking about how that it was a happy sound and i thought well that's it the devil has absolutely offered such a uh uh such a devastation around the world of what is really a home life or a church life and he offers no hope to anybody and so in that music there's a little bit of a happiness there there's a little bit of release for them so that when they begin to hear that type of music they feel like they can just float their their cares and their troubles away all that's how that dirty old devil has impersonated and stolen from god actually do things that we are supposed to be using music for ourselves amen that's exactly right now watch here again in second converse 20 20. now just notice as they appointed singers unto the lord now once they appointed these singers that they should praise the beauty of holiness now i'm sure if you've studied the book of psalms you know that the book of psalms is broken into five parts and that david himself was the writer of about say 70 of the psalms asap haman jebeth and the song of moses uh solomon had a part each one comprised together the book of psalms and they would take these certain categories of psalms and they would sing these songs and before the passover before certain parts of the feast and they would take these words and they would break them down in almost like a prophetic form and so as they would sing the man calls david a prophetic poet he calls it or a poetic prophet in one place he said and so he would break into these songs and sing things that had real substance to it now when you get time tonight or tomorrow or weekend sometime look at revelation chapter five and look how that when the song is being sang there when the lamb is taking the book look at the substance behind what is being said to him his power and honor and glory and all these things and why because they've got something to say in the songs that they are saying i'm gonna tell you something friends in the modern day we're living in a lot of our message songs are becoming more like a chat and they'll say jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus i thank god for that but i want to know a little bit more than just what his name is i want to know what kind of jesus is is he a jesus that he heals come on somebody is there jesus that saves and jesus that delivers well if he is then sing to me about what he is don't just spoke to me we're going to heaven we're going to heaven we're going to heaven we're going to heaven over and over again and just because it sounds pretty we think that's all right tell me how i'm supposed to get there if you're going to sing me a song and tell me how i'm supposed to get there i noticed a few moments ago when brother jesse was saying one of the verses and they came to that part about you must be born again boy that preacher to him he was just hammering away at that one spot but i thought that's exactly the way that a real gospel song should be orchestrated because when you're saying something you need to say brother i just come and beat around the bushes we say and maybe go another sideway down around it don't just quote to me jesus jesus and make it pretty music but tell me something that's going to encourage my soul to serve the lord amen exactly right now watch in verse 21 he appoints singers unto the lord that they should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army to say praise the lord for his mercy endureth forever now watch as the the order of god is they move into verse 22 when they begin to sing and to praise now here's a point i want to bring up to you so that you're aware of this there is no place in the bible nowhere but what you will find singing music and worship directly connected together always remember that anytime you have music you have worship associated with music so for those people that say well i listen to music it has nothing to do with worship you are deceiving yourself every time you have music or singing worship is directly associated i wish somebody would help me preach because i'm telling you the truth you know i am it's absolutely directly connected together it even goes on the other side with satanic worship you notice that when thou shalt and all these different things was going on and the kingdom when daniel was alive oh my that when they were going to worship the image of daniel which we know that the prophet daniel was the image that they were going to worship when did they fall down to worship when the sultry and the sacred and all the different music was played that was their cue to begin to worship and oh and that is the way it should be right here tonight that when we hear the sister get on the piano and we hear people singing and clapping their hands and rejoicing in the lord when we hear the music playing that's our cue to know it's time for worship hallelujah oh my praise the lord a lot of times people hear the music that's their cue to go to sleep you know it's time to rest time to catch up on some of that sleep they've been missing through the week playing video games all week or watching television or netflix or something like that but when we hear the music it's our time to worship now notice let me read to you again just one more time notice brooklyn said there's something about song that has got power in it and he said do you know that the approach to war in the army of god was first by music so god so saw the power of music and singing and worship that he wanted that to be the prelude to the armies of god marching out with the word across their shoulder the levites it was such a powerful thing brother smith that if they did not have the music then the soldiers did not know how to prepare themselves to war you remember what paul said if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound well there had to be a certain sound that they had to hear and one of them certain sounds was was the sound of the singers going forth to praise amen the beauty of his holiness hallelujah once they heard them singers i'd be religious to my toenails once they heard them singers going out then the power of god would fall on the army and they would become so encouraged by what they were hearing i mean you think about the battle that the children of israel was up against many times they were outnumbered five to one they had men on horses on chariots all they had was a stick in their hand but yet when they would hear them singers pick up the song of moses about how god overcome pharaoh and the chariots are laying in the mud it says now that god is a god of war how their heart god shall deliver us i imagine an anointing fell on those men and women that they could stand there and hear the armies of god marching board in the name of great jehovah god it encouraged them it encouraged them so much that god said if you'll start worshiping praising i'll come down and i'll get in the middle of your worship in praise i inhabit your praise if you create a room for me i will dwell in that room amen i want you to think as the people would begin to worship and to praise god would come down and inhabit their praise doing what creating a perimeter around the armies so everyone that was worshiping the holy ghost was creating a divine perimeter around those harmonies oh thank you lord jesus and he was surrounding them in the beauty of his holiness so actually before them armies ever met one soldier they met the holy ghost before they met the soldiers because he inhabited their praise oh my oh my goodness says that's the right approach that's the right approach you understand it must come by music first well let's get to the word this is the word this is the word you can't skip the word to get to the word this is the word i wonder friends i've said this many places but i'm sitting in here tonight i wonder when brethren said eve just just she just dogged off one eye one little eye the wrong way she crossed the t when she should have dotted an eye it was just one little thing you know laying out there that she missed one little word that she listened to from the devil that god had crossed up i wonder how many people in the message ain't gonna make the rapture because they hate this part right here praise worship and sing it they hate it they don't want you screaming they don't want you shouting they don't want you glorifying god they don't want you raised in your hands they don't want you saying praise the lord hello they don't want you saying hey man glory to god they don't want you getting in the spirit they say jump to the word so they're going to miss the word to get to the word there i wonder i wonder how god is going to look on when they skip that part of the message to get to this part of the message that's why john was told the whole book amen hello don't just see what parts you like you know that's somebody said one time well i'm not much of a music person i said that you ain't much of a god person because god likes music where do you think it comes from now you hear people say about the devil well you know the devil i heard people saving the message now satan was you know he was the the man over music i said somebody please show me one quote or one scripture that said satan was a song leader satan was more than a song leader he was the right hand man to god the right hand man's a fellowship he was more than a song leader praise the lord but you say well he was old now he was the right hand of god in other words what god wanted done he done it and you realize that because he was an angel an angel was created for basically two purposes they were created to worship and for service so the devil had a master understanding of what worship was all about including singing and music so that's more than just a local song leader he was more than just a local song they didn't decide oh maybe i'll i'll just you know maybe i'll sing a few contemporary songs and some godly ones it was more than that they make the devil out to be just kind of a little little small something up there but listen brother the reason the devil can manipulate worship in things is because he was created the highest being next to god everything god was except for created he was more than a song leader he was somebody that knew how everything worked the only thing he couldn't figure out was creation because god didn't give it to him folks you know that's the one that makes the devil so mad about you and i we know how creation works he don't ours comes by spoken word we've got what he's wanted all these years we've had somebody we've got what he's always wanted no wonder he hates us so much oh my that's the right approach so the devil brings it down from heaven remember they don't lose any of their power authority or ability so they bring it down from heaven down to the earth now what does the devil do the very first thing he does is he anoints the serpent and the serpent goes to working on what eve's area of worship you know you could be a god eve well why would he want to make her an object to worship when she already had an object of worship you see what he was doing manipulating her object of worship trying to bring it upon where herself and where are most of the songs focused on today themselves hey the days of people uh uh a safe worshiping type of uh acid rocky you know what i'm talking about these things got the devil horn you don't see much of that anymore but what you see now is people worshiping themselves i am the great i've done this why the devil's keeping his promise he's making him a god that's exactly what he promised them and that's what he's trying to fulfill because by giving them what they want he knows he can get what he wants now i'm a funny guy brother jesse i'm a little strange sometimes to people in the message because i just believe the elected can't be deceived and as a preacher i just happen to believe that if i study something i believe the holy ghost will protect me so hear about oh i don't know back in december when i was in africa i got out there and i said lord if you'll help me i want to do my very best to study my enemy better and i got to thinking and i study on this music of things and i got to thinking i've never studied satanism and i thought i'm going to go get the satanic bible you can get electronically and different things like that and i'm going to study what they believe because i want to know what they teach i was absolutely turned upside down when i got to reading what the real belief behind satanism is now mind you as a preacher i don't encourage or endorse anybody go do this i'm talking about as a preacher you study facts but believe me let me give you the essence of it just take all the curiosity out of it the bottom line is that satanism they say that there's two important holidays that every satan worshiper every satanist they call them should observe number one is the most and number two is the next under that number one i'm saying it that way because i want to give you a little test what do you think their number one holiday is somebody gonna say halloween because that's probably what you're expecting done that way that's number two you know what their number one most important holiday is you're on birthday why because the teaching is there is nobody greater or higher than yourself do you realize they don't even actually believe in the devil they believe that it is an inherent evil inside of everybody that if you are a true satanist you yield to the good of yourself and the evil of yourself so what is their main belief you are the most important thing put on planet earth that is the exact opposite of what god has said he said if any man shall follow me let him deny himself i want to make a statement everybody hang on do you realize when you see people around the rings that consider their opinions their beliefs their feelings their whatever they are to be more important than anybody else do you realize that person is actually a closet satanist amen now you don't know what to do still the same truth i'm preaching to you that's what i'm talking about the devil tried to make human beings to make them the very object of everybody's worship take some girl out there she's got a figure got a face or something like that what she wants somebody to worship her is the next title some man he's got a voice who's got a certain athletic ability they want everybody who wants to put his autograph down why it's worse it's worse that's why i don't go along with all these sportings and things like that because that's worship that people are doing too many of these athletes and people out there in the world they worship these guys they put their ball gaps on they put their posters up in the room do they have posters of jesus no they've got posters of michael jordan or somebody like that and what they worship their image that they set before them it's what they worship but now the devil is changing the focus and he's making you the most important thing well it's only appropriate because in the day of lydiocell or people's rights who else is more important than you so if you're a homosexual then you're important because you're homosexual don't touch your homosexuality because hey i'm an important person don't tell me that god's going to judge me because i am an important person jesus said if you want to follow me deny who you are hey somebody started a debate some time ago about oh you know how are they born that way or whatever i said look you guys believe whatever you want to believe but i'm going to go to the next step of the question the next step is or you say i'm born that way okay my next question is then can you deny how you were born hello somebody oh they said my mama made me this way my daddy made me this way all right my next question is how can you deny the way mama raised you can you because jesus said if you can't deny yourself then you can't be a follower of him oh you know my grandpa made me this way or my great great great great great was an alcoholic so that's why i pretend you deny yourself the fire of the lord jesus as if you can't deny yourself you'll never receive christ the real key to being the christians let go and let god amen you got a better idea than god that you ain't saved amen hello if you've got better ideas in the holy ghost you ain't even got to holy ghost as a person is born again they ain't got no coming to this word of god they want what he says what he says the days of i think i feel i think i feel that ignorance is going over to people around this rank or either your preacher tell them something i think i feel i believe but listen if god said it it doesn't matter what you think or what i think if the word says that the promises of god are what gay and amen but what's most of our music focused on now the person all of your bubble gum pop artists out there brittany and christine aguilera and all these and all these girls out there listen the song says say i'm this and i'm that hey come on y'all don't live in a cave you're out in the world like i am you hear these songs and restaurants and bus stations everywhere else they're saying everything they say is about them about them about what they go through about their life why do i want to hear about all the things they've done in their life in a song i don't care how many times they've committed adultery that's between them and the lord praise the lord but the focus is upon themselves all right now you say but i listen and love songs by the bib that's about the worst of all of them which one's the worst focus and the one the satan song is shoving the devil down your throat or the song that don't mention nothing about jesus the blood calvary redemption or nothing what about the song that ignores him all together is that batman that's a bad one ignores them all together it's whitney houston singing i'll always love you she don't even put a name with it you know why because there's 15 years ago in that song she gets rid of jim she'll get job once she gets done with john she'll get with this one get with that one get the other and they can sing the same song for every letter that they pick up come on don't look at me like a bunch of peace you know what i'm talking about why because the holy spirit is trying to show us brother that the devil is slick in every way you turn around that's why we got to be careful what kind of music we listen to [Applause] i know you're going to think i'm crazy on this but i'd rather have a song shut the devil down my throat than one that doesn't that ignores jesus altogether because at least if i hear about a devil i might be able to hear about god huh but some of these other songs don't even mention it they exactly right oh my now notice let me take for just a few moments the uh the scientific part of this now i know this may i'm not going to get terribly deep with this but just to give you the highlights of what science says that music does to us now mind you there's a lot that i can tell you in this but i'm just going to try to hit the highlights and then we'll go home after a while notice science as they begin to define music they realize that the approach that the the approach of musicians and things as they put a song out there that it has the way they play the beats the rhythms the way they uh frame the song it has a direct effect upon you now we realize and i always get this wrong but if it's the left side of the brain i'm pretty sure that uh figures two plus two equals four and four and four is eight and all that then the right side is your creative part that's the part that absorbs music now the left side that comprehends and calculates and figures this is so tall that's so uh along and so forth that's this part of your brain here but now the right side of your brain is the part that takes in music now this is what science says science says that music drops him to this right side of your brain and as it drops into this right side of your brain it directly feeds into your subconscious without any conscious thought going into the process whatsoever so in other words if you've been sitting there at a restaurant and before you even know that you hear a song playing overhead before you even know it you're kind of doing this number like that you're like oh good lord i backslid no you haven't maxed it but what has happened is that music has moved into that right side of the brain it has dropped into your subconscious and your body is reacting to that beat of that music and it bypassed this left side of thought altogether that's the reason why that you didn't think too much about it it was happening before you do it that's god's design for the power of music to get itself into your life i want you to pay attention to this because this is the way that if we could use music to the right ability then we would realize that music is not something that we're supposed to be sitting there thinking about when a brother is singing i am bound for the promised land many times people steal away the blessings of that song because they're sitting there trying to figure it out they're working from the left side of the brain well if i'm bound for the promised land what is the promised land and how big is the promised land am i going to the promised land or how about you i know you ain't going to the promised land and that one's definitely on the promised land and before you even got halfway through the song you've done till the effects of the way the music is supposed to react into your body and you realize that when the music hits the right side of your brain it literally shifts your mind over and shuts off the left side so you can't really think and be creative at the same time so in other words if you're going to listen to a song you can't pull it to pieces while you're listening to it well for all you intellectual saints in here hold on real tight tonight okay you cannot figure it out now why is that the way that is that i was thinking about this song lord of god why you was singing it did you get the blessing out of it well no because i see busy thinking about it there you go that's the reason they don't get the blessing because they're thinking so much about words and all this that they don't let the music do the job that it's supposed to do which is what give your brain a break if it shuts off this left side like turning the faucet you don't talk about and it shuts it off where you cannot think the ability to be able to shut that part of your mind off gives you a little bit of a rest i want you to think about something if your brain is connected to everything in you your liver your kidneys your pancreas your heart your lungs your nerves cells corpuscles everything feet toes legs arms everything in you is connected to your brain so if your brain is stressed what do you think that does to the rest of you if your mind is overworked what do you think that does to the rest of you it overworks everything in you hello if your mind is stretched will you say brother ben i am a deep thinking person well i'm glad you come to church tonight because i'm going to show you how to quit doing it at least for portions of the day now notice again they said here in an article in september 2013 that music has an effect uh a unique effect on the brain says that because that they cannot really define what music is it's something that they don't really understand but they said it has a definite effect upon learning upon memory emotion and even spirituality they said that because the brain is it has wide circuits in it that brings a strong what they call neuroplasticity that is effect and this ability to learn is increased exponentially whenever the music is played along with something they're doing you know from being school teachers you and sam that when you go into a place and you're trying to teach the kids some sort of mathematical fact or some kind of a deal like that uh same or familiar you use a little musical something to try to get it down why they can learn better with a musical thought because music actually opens up channels of the mind that are not opened up without it so they can actually have more of their brain used when they use music a more creative part that actually drives the learning down into their subconscious if it ever gets into your subconscious it sticks there that's what they call long-term memory science calls it long-term we call it your subconscious it's been etched into the long-term part of your subconscious that's why some of y'all right now if i quoted you the first three lines of some of the rock songs you listened to you could tell me what tune it is if i played just a few bars of it why that went down into that little recorder of yours called your subconscious and it's been laying down and i can play you a few bars and michael jackson beat it and you tell me who it was what date it was played on all of that why all of that's dropped into your subconscious well if we can do that with the worldly side what about the things of god what about the things of god could not the word be done the same exact way oh my oh hallelujah to the lamb of god notice again the strong effects from music they say could drive soldiers into war brother burley williams was showing a clip back at our church some time ago i don't know maybe brothers have seen it i got off youtube or one of these things about a testimonial from a tank soldier a tank battalion uh leader one of these battalions was talking about that when he would go into this uh this this war type of ironman or iraq or whatever they might have been it said that as they would go in there they would play a certain type of music and they played just a few bars of it it was uh marilyn manson's the bodies hit the floor or something like that but the bodies hit the floor some of that nature and they just repeat the words over and over again that the bodies hit the floor the bodies hit the floor over and over again so this young man would play this and he said his own words he said i actually became anointed to kill i became anointed to kill and once i started killing and destroyed with that music playing i could not stop it was only until after i shut it off that it was kind of something would lift off of yourself and then it wouldn't feel like you couldn't stop and why is that because that music would drive right directly into the subconscious and it responded out of the body the body was responding to that music now remember they also tell us that when a person is listening in music that music has the power listen close to be able to change your intentions so somebody could be sitting there listening to godly music they could love their mom and dad they're always respectful coming to church and so forth sit on the front row and what more always participate all of a sudden something changes they become rebellious they become hard-hitted they become disrespectful start missing church if they're in church or not paying attention on and on i guarantee you if you go look in that person's music deck if they've even got decks anymore or their ipod or whatever they got you'd find out that someone another they got a hold of some music that has changed their intention a lot of times is what happens because the songs are working on the biblical principle remember the bible said in isaiah that it should be lined up online precept on precept here a little there a little line online preset precept here little there look in other words repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat so the more you say it the more you get it remember the book of james when he said he looks into the mirror and he forgets who he was but the more that he looks into the mirror the more he remembers what he is so you understand the music then that we're hearing in the world is actually shaping and forging the intentions of humanity they talked about these boys in columbine and they still cannot figure out to this day what made them boys change and do like they did there was an article that was given just the other day where the one of the young boys mothers was interviewed i think my uh oh diane somebody another sawyer one of them out there and they had a little article set down where they would say you know certain certain interviews gonna take place such and such so i found it on the internet i was interested i want to listen to this young woman and hear what she had to say about her son and throughout the interview that asked her questions did you see signs did you notice certain behaviors uh did things change and through the majority of the interviews she said we thought everything was fine we thought it was just normal teenage life we had no idea that these things were hiding when they began to discover that certain things were happening there was a little worried but not too worried now they found that later on a baptist minister from some place begins studying as it were this this particular setup of these boys and you know there's been a lot of questions as to why they've done what they've done well one day they found an article or another article but a um an interview where they have the boys standing there talking to somebody from the school one of them dylan or whatever the other guy's name was and they would take him they would hold him there before the camera and give him a little interview they walk on to the next person and it was just enough that they could see the boy's t-shirt and what was read on the t-shirt and one of this baptist preacher he honed in on the name of the band that was on his shirt and it was a german death metal man and in one of their songs they tracked this down they found out that the boys would listen to certain type of music and they found this was one of their number one groups that they listened to over and over again and one of the main songs that this german group would say they would sing it in english they would sing it in german they would sing it in different ways but the essence of the song over and over again was go to the schoolyard get the gun and kill the boy over and over and over again go to the schoolyard get the gun and kill the bullet now they may have been looking for some kind of parental problem and i don't doubt that mom and dad should have been more aware of what kind of music they were listening to but they did not realize the reason that them boys had the courage to do the thing that they were doing is because as brother madam said music gives courage and it was giving them courage to go in and do the thing that the song was telling them to do if it can do that for two boys going into a schoolyard and assaulting as many people as they can assault and kill what could that do for you and i when we get discouraged i need a little pick me up i need some time to give our brain a break come on somebody i guarantee you can change your injection as well because you may be at the spot i don't think i'll serve the lord anymore i think i'll give up i think i'll quit and you go to listen to one of them gospel songs and after a few minutes you go to thinking well that is so bad after all wow this is pretty good i think i'll keep serving the lord why that song has entered into your subconscious and it has changed your intentions oh glory to god praise the lord are you hanging on pretty good all right now watch us now now they said that group singing actually produces a higher measure of general health and quality of life in the elderly they notice in an observation that cancer survivors and caretakers of ill people and so forth that that music and group singing would increase their health and their ability to be healthy and watch this i love this music training in the elderly would help avoid memory loss music therapies rhythm therapies along with electoral stimulation improved aphasia and stroke victims musical training would aid with dyslexia teaching someone how to learn a musical instrument help dyslexia parkinson's patients use rhythm in physical therapy to improve their date or how they their span of walking notice in babies interactive song learning increased smiling waving communicating and understanding pitch even dogs and shelters now listen to this even dogs and shelters bark less and slept better when they played classical music and mice with heart transplants they survived twice as long when they listened to classical music as they did this other stuff now you think the devil didn't know what he was doing want to begin manipulating music because he knows that music has an effect upon you if it has an effect upon your body he can actually steal your health away while you're listening to the wrong kind of music but if you're listening to music no wonder the prophet said god heals by music amen amen he heals in a whole lot more ways than just full and instant healing like that healing's not that way no how it's a process of time how much healing and diseases would lead people's bodies and so forth and they would give their brain a break about say 30 minutes every single day let's turn out the first chronicles chapter 15 verse 14. let's go down through 14 through 16 there let's look just a little bit more at the way that this is put together my my mind well if music and good music made people smile and wave and communicate better i said we need a few longer song services and a message and somebody else cause i can't tell you one thing people don't know how to smile much less communicate in the message to the out some people don't but a lot of them don't watch now in first chronicles 15 look at verse 14 so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the lord god of israel the children of the levites bear the ark of god upon their shoulders with the stabs thereon as moses commanded according to the word of the lord and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of music oh my give me to tell me god would allow this man to go and appoint singers and instruments of music well surely he'd go look up the biggest evangelists in the country surely he finally pastors got the biggest church brother smith charlotte is looking for somebody to help him out they want the greatest apostle that's ever walked shoe leather but singers with music but it's not important so you want to skip the word to get to the word there now i ask you is it the word are we reading the word as i check these scriptures being read out of your bible amen praise the lord somebody and the bible is the word amen amen right that's where it's coming from it's from the word now watch instruments of music sultries and hearts oh praise god that's how i like it you say brother ben that's salty that heart nice and quiet until mr symbol shows up oh yes but you say that it's got to be a quiet easy thing sometimes it needs to be loud oh glory to god i don't believe in creating scandals on facebook but i believe i'd almost take a picture of y'all's faces and put it on there tonight you said brother ben that's ridiculous know what hey now once they say that when a person is actually meditating that when they have soft easy going music in the background good music now that it actually increases their ability to meditate on on what's been said or what's been read now you watch brother brown when he comes to the end of a service he's saying now brother sister a piano player uh organ player or whatever who you are he said now real easy on the music why because he knows in loud music or loud or music it interrupts your ability to think have you been sitting somewhere and some loud music going on and you get frustrated and fed up with it it's a lot in here i can't even thank you you're telling the truth that's what that loud music is supposed to do it's supposed to interrupt the channel of your thoughts so you can't think so we want soft music whenever it's time to meditate but we need the symbols when it's time to worship that don't raise their voice i understand now after many many years this june will be 25 years of preaching the gospel i now understand after this study brother jesse why god made me a loud preacher amen amen i now understand because you know what if people stopped and thought about every little word i said they would never be able to absorb every word that i said so many times god made me laugh so i can keep people thinking about it it's hard to really enjoy your meal if you're looking at every bite before you stick it in your mouth doing scientific tests on it making sure it's actually food before you eat it so when it comes time for me to preach i just say just open up and just let me slam it in there symbols or sounding which is a loud sound a loud thing now watch by lifting up the voice with joy so the song has to be able to bring joy oh now we're driving home so what kind of saw what kind of joy is the song bringing if it is not bringing holy ghost joy if it is not bringing spiritual joy then evidently you've got the wrong song the lord showed me that when i said god help me punch that thing in the face as hard as i can hit it amen help me stomp his foot pull that camera's beard poke him in the eyes and show exactly where he's at do you understand that's why some people listen to music that ain't got it because it gives them a joy when they listen to that type of music but there's a joy that the holy ghost can give you that comes with the whole god all about you listen some of them taught this song and saying it and worshipping some of you it brings the joy of the holy ghost so then bring holy ghost joy you got the wrong song i've heard people say oh it just makes me happy was it god making you happy or was you happy there's a difference there's a difference absolutely now watch let's go to first chronicles 25 verse one now let's dig down into this just a little bit more amen first chronicles 25 verse one i got the slightest idea how long i've been up here but maybe it's long maybe it ain't i don't know we're gonna keep going watch your first chronicles 25 1. whoever david and the captains of the host separated the service of the sons of asap haman jonathan these are writers of the book of psalms now books of the psalms and who should prophesy with harps oh my sultries and symbols who should prophesy prophesy so when you're playing this pen over here it's more than just putting notes together but you're actually prophesying did you remember that you're prophesying you say how in the world can i be prophesying will i give you an example what if you're sitting there sick in your body and you're sitting you hear a song come across the platform start singing he was wounded for my transgression bruised for my iniquity and by the stripes i'm already here you realize if you sing that song like paul said with understanding and singing with the spirit do you understand that when you sing that song out with that illness in your body what you are doing you are prophesying to your body you are prophesying amen to the devil you are prophesying to god i believe you are my viewers prophesy your prophet not what he said revelation 10 and he said eat the book and then go prophecy i am convinced that we are prophesying more differently today than what we ever realized people are standing in church singing i'm going to make the rapture one day like this one salmon i tried i'll see you in the rapture amen you know what i'm doing i'm prophesying amen i'm prophesying to you and then when you sing it back to me you're prophesying to me amen i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make it i'm gonna see you in the right oh praise the lord so they go into battle the armies will be all gathered together they'll be about 500 000 on one hill there'll be about 40 000 israelites and they go to singing my god turned israel upstairs turned egypt upside down he put the he put the chariots in the mud our god is a god of war hot god is going to deliver us from all the hands of our oppressors and our enemies that there's been forty thousand singing as hard as they can sing and they're looking at them five hundred thousand that's gonna wipe them out like you flick your finger across a little beetle book and who's the winners israel why because they were prophesying to that other group it isn't just us fighting the battle is not mine he said little people but the battle is the lord's i don't know the battle is oh praise the lamb of god listen to this leadership let me read it to you and i said singing gives courage the soldiers when they're going to battle what do they do they play music and singing things to give them courage when we're going to battle we sing and it gives us courage to go on now i want you to notice now that many times i always marvel this time of year and the school systems and things but a lot of times they'll go in and they'll say to the young people they'll say now you know don't take drugs and don't don't have sexual affairs and things and all that and then they put them on the dance floor they play all that music up above them they cannot figure out how that young man that young woman who was so bashful could barely look in the eye will go through their morals to the dogs after prom or homecoming or one of these deals why the music gave them courage to do the thing that the musicals want them to do now i'm going to have to say this gently because it's kind of a little strong words i got to use here but you realize that that the origination of rock and roll itself the term rock and roll is actually a street term that refers and forgive me enough is to blood but sexual intercourse so when you talk about elvis presley being the king of rock and roll now you see what kind of king he really was now rock and roll music is kind of a mishmash of your will of all these different styles and so as it evolved over over time it started with say blues and r b and some jazz and a few pieces and then as it evolved it brought in big band and swing and different types of music until it became what it is today now we know the prophet of god said that elvis was actually set out there elvis red foley and all these others pat boone and them you know when i collect old records i even go past the pat boone's and the red bullies and the tennessee earning forwards i don't even go get them old lps like that i figured brother brown didn't have nothing for him i could have that for him either as brother said leather standing there said now if you believe me to be a prophet of god he said you remember elvis presley is an incarnate devil he said he is a challenger to the church he said they're trying the devil is trying to use men like elvis in them to get that spirit into the church of rock and roll music now i want to show you something real quickly because the beats and the rhythms of rock and roll music are arranged in a certain way it is found that the scientists the physiological and all the smart folks can figure this stuff out oh you're just trying to read some of the words you have to almost get a dictionary to get through some of these little articles and things to get it all down but they go into the human body and as they go down in there they find out that rock and roll music has a certain effect upon the human body again forgive me if this is too plain but i got to be truthful with you telling us about this part of the sermon and that is rock and roll music the rhythms of the beats brother jesse actually release the hormones and the chemicals and things for a boy or a girl as if they were getting ready to enter into a physical relationship that's why the girls will pull their underneath clothes off and throw them up front for mr presley to sign all his autograph to the underneath closed why the rhythms of the beats was releasing hormones and pheromones and toxins and things in their body now listen to me carefully if a man or woman then listens at so-called contemporary gospel uh christian rock music or some sort of contemporary style that has the same type of rock and roll beats in it i want you to realize that your body does not know the difference just because one song says jesus and the other one says the devil your body doesn't know the difference your body responds to it as though it is rock and roll music even though they might be saying in jesus jesus jesus jesus and many of the contemporary so-called christian artists today they are literally calling it god not jesus but god so that they can appeal to the buddhists and to the sikhs and to the james and the muslims because all of them have gods and they all have a god and so if they say god not jesus then the other groups will buy their music as well but i want you to know when i sing about it when you sing about it i want to sing that his name is the lord jesus i want to sing there is only one god that we poured out of worship there's only one name whereby there's been given that we can be saved that is the name of the lord jesus christ tell me his name don't just quote to me god don't just sing to me about god anything could be a god but tell me who he is tell me that he saves me amen tell me that he loves me put on somebody tell me that he redeems me tell me that he wants to take me out of this old world don't just sing to me about god anything could be a god a car could be a god a football star could be a god a singer could be a god but there's only one lord jesus now let me let me talk to you about nature for just a moment in job 38 verse 6 and 7 he asked joe where the foundations were fastened and who laid the cornerstone of course job if he's a smart guy and he was he didn't answer too much when god was asking him these questions and then today into this day and age and said who laid the foundations and we probably answered one of our great grandfathers it was walkway brother branham or something like that because that's the way people act anyways they think that we got some kind of a uh some kind of an elite group and we've done everything all the focus is upon what great great so-and-so done and not the great great jesus had done it for all of us but i'll just point your attention again in revelation 5 when they begin singing about that lamb of god the focus wasn't on them or the prophets because remember before that just a few verses there was a search made in heaven and no man was found worthy to open the book of the look thereof whether he was in heaven whether he was on the earth or whether it was buried underneath the earth in the ground there was nobody found worthy and when they went to sing and they sing about who they should sing about and that's about the lamb of god don't just sing to me about brother branham point to me to jesus if you send me a song about brother brahma and that song points me to jesus and i'll say amen to us but by the time you're done singing about brother brown you're still singing about brother brown something's wrong with your soul write another verse hello hello write another verse that's right write another verse watch here he said when the morning stars now sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy music and worship goes together stars saying sun shouted music music and worship go together that's why god wants us to have the right kind of music because the right kind of music ushers us to the right kind of worship kids we don't take it seriously enough around the race no we come to church we sit down and say well turn to page two in the only believe song but they come from the east and the west barely an enthusiasm barely sings the verses out i don't mean because their voices scratch you either they just barely just barely get it out you know they finally finish the song and you're not sure whether or not you showed up to a funeral on accident looking for the dead body whatever they got in lady have someone around you got to be in this church somewhere huh come on somebody no enthusiasm no joy hey listen if i'm singing about being in the cross i'm only smile while i come on now if i'm going to sing without him coming back for me i want to be rejoicing when i sing the song because i'm prophesied i prophesy now watch this my what is what a thought this is right here when the morning stars sang now it was done i might have quoted this you once before but out of the university of central lincolnshire professor don kurtz done a little study on the stars one day to see if there's any truth to that and he found that there was a certain instrument they could use what they call astro sized biology you can say that you're better than i am and it takes this instrument and they stuck it somehow another one of these stars out there and they put this instrument out where it could read the stars and his words were that the stars actually sing they ring like giant musical instruments as instruments as sound waves cause them to vibrate to get hotter to get cooler brighter dimmer bigger smaller and change shape here's the key you could not hear from the outside the music being the same but once they were able to get the instrument to pick up what was coming from the inside that's where they heard the music the music was on the inside on the outside you couldn't hear the music or see the music but on the inside you could see the music oh come on somebody show you know what i'm talking about it's not the outside that sees the music that hears the music it's the inside and that's where all good music should come from and that's from [Applause] you said you had to look beneath the circles he said even a black hole would vibrate 57 octaves below middle c uh you know what i'm saying don't you i'm a black hole and so we know that they ring out of vibration everything has a vibration to it they're all vibrating the glory of god you say nature does not recognize god i bet your pardon brother said when jesus was dying on calvary he said the earth had a nervous breakdown he said the son recognized his creator was dying on calvary and it had so they vibrate they vibrate and ring out the glory of god have you ever had to see a parakeet taken in to get a diabetes a1c test you ever seen a bluebird with high blood pressure huh you've been to the doctor before haven't you have you ever seen a giraffe in there with a thermometer in its mouth no why they're constantly ringing out god's praise they're wringing out god's praise you know why they know how to get their little brains a break they know how to get their little brains to break they don't worry about what they're going to eat tomorrow because jesus is going to feed them oh god oh yes sir hallelujah they don't worry about what they're going to live tomorrow because god's got a home for them tomorrow and before they get to tomorrow he is they're constantly vibrating his worship his praise no wonder john the baptist said if you hold your peace these rocks will immediately cried out hey glory why because they were oxford it's just that they know their place they know humans first rock second but jesus john said if they hold their peace he said i won't even let the rocks hold their peace why somebody's gonna worship him if we don't worship lord again it's that sound is unique there's never any real silence anywhere in nature the more quiet we become the more subtle the sounds we hear from the environment we're placed inside of an isolation tank we'd hear our heartbeat our breathing it'd be the ocean sound and the in our ears that's when the air molecules vibrating in our ear canals we hear the sounds of our own nervous system in this tank why because everything is vibrating constantly constantly the glory of god notice worship praise going together in psalm 96 1-2 the day david said it was singing of the lord sing unto the lord all the earth watch him saying worship sing worship worship sing in isaiah 42 verse 10 through 13 he said the sing of the lord a new song and his praise from the end of the earth either go down to the sea orleans they're in the aisles the inhabitants thereof watch us let the wilderness and the cities lift up their voice the villages that kid are not inhabited let the inhabitants of the rock sing that's my new title y'all i'm an inhabitant of the rock [Laughter] glory yes sir let them shout from the top of the mountains and let them give glory unto the lord and declare his praise in the ivories worship and praise going together music going together watch again psalm 148 1-3 praise you the lord praise you the lord from the heavens praise him in the heights praise him all the angels praise him all ye hosts praise him sun and moon praise him all you stars of light what's he showing everything is vibrating out god's praise god's worship god's glory it's constantly vibrating out oh i feel religious hallelujah hallelujah it's always vibrating out through oh my maybe even clapping the hands maybe even raising up the hands maybe saying the voice of amen maybe the sound of their tears patting off their cheek maybe the sound of their heart beating in a faster rhythm when they feel his presence come into the room oh glory to god if it make the sun go happy and what ought to do to a s-o-n if it would make the s-o-s you've been praising what about an esso win psalm 144 verse nine going back about four chapters he said i sing unto the lord a new song and a d o god upon a sultry and an instrument of ten strings well i praise unto thee so if you've got all your fingers you've got a ten string instrument if you're missing a few you're tapping by faith if you understand what i'm saying you might be missing an arm you're clapping by faith but potentially potentially you've got ten strings right and then you may not have it here maybe a surgery took a hand off maybe an accident made you lose an arm but when you get in that new city your 10-stringed instrument will be waiting on you hey it's going to be why not in the glory of our god what do you think we're going to do in the new city slap here and pass quote books to each other and debate doctrine when we get in this new city brother there's gonna be worship after worship praise after praise there's gonna be songs saying come on somebody there's gonna be victory ringing out through the kingdom of god psalm 22 verse 3 he says but thou art holy oh lord that inhabits the praise of israel faith abraham little man says how wonderful i just notice the scripture as you listen to this how god enters poetry how he enters songs how he enters praise how he enters worship it's as though you build a room for him to inhabit glory to god it's like you built a room for him to have it i call it a little room come on somebody preach to me i'm talking about i'll meet you in there that'll be the third pool i want that if many people haven't missed the third pull knowing that part of this third pool is worship praise and singing and music and prayer remember what he quoted matthew 6 6 he said well why did he why don't you say that little room like that in private he said didn't jesus say go into a little room and when you pray what your father reveals his secret he'll reward you open amen oh my hallelujah is in the lamb of god you might be getting tired after but i'm just getting started i'm feeling warmed up right now watch out in psalm 33 1-3 rejoice in the lord oh ye righteous for praise is comely for the upright amen praise the lord with heart and sing unto him a sultry and an instrument of ten strings sing unto him as do song and play skillfully with a oh no surely that ain't what david said but he did with a loud boy i'm just not an emotional person you see and i just don't get emotional about much about much well let's do a little experiment kevin i notice as i walk past that room right there there's all kinds of little hammers and saws and instruments of working over there if you don't mind we'll go to the side room after church you that are not emotional we'll take a hammer you offer up the right hand of fellowship i will wax that hammer on said hand if you don't squeal you have a right to stay quiet in church but if you squeal you're an emotional person i think you already know the answer to what's going to happen though no we're not emotional about what we don't want to be emotional about we're emotional about what we want to be emotional about you know those are grandkids or something like that or whoever and they're playing soccer they kick a field goal or whatever you call them and then oh hey i could knock people over did you see what happened and then we come to the house of god and the devil kicks field goals on the devil on her god kicks phil goes on the devil day and night how many cents they go i'm just a quiet person okay so what you're saying is if i had a million dollars i'm not i'm a real evangelist silver and gold have i done [Music] no that's not a pool for a bigger offer but if i was to hand you a million dollar check let's say i had 10 million dollars i wanted to share a million dollars with you you need to tell me if i wrote down a personal check earmarked it from me to you for one million dollars a year market so it's it's tax-free that you don't even have some charitable non unsolicited tax free gift you only have to pay taxes on it one million smackaroos in your bank account you mean to tell me if i handed you that check and you knew money was in the bank you knew i was good for it that you just stand and go wow i didn't mean something you know what that brought up i got a million dollars this day you did yeah sure did yeah hey did you hear what's happening in the super bowl over the weekend you imagine that big one you imagine you change the subject but you move on to the next thing you've been talking about the last trump or hillary or whatever it's going to be come on you imagine that's the way it is i imagine if i handed you a million dollars and you knew i was good for it that you'd be going hey hey everybody everybody i got a million so you mean you can come to church and these brothers can hand you god-given qualities of the word that are priceless of eternal value [Music] no if you got this right what david's saying right here you praised him with a loud noise oh hallelujah let me go just uh just a little bit further okay all right turn the act 16 25 26 now now let me show you this part about giving your brain a break now something that you got to know is that i'm going to read you some quotes in just a moment we're running around deals with people of this type of nature that many times our thinking is what gets us in such a nervous condition i understand there's times that you got to think there's times that you've got to uh figure things you're going to dwell on things and meditate and so forth but as i said you know with the easy music it was easy to meditate with a softer thing because brother ramen just got done preaching sermons and things and he wanted the people to meditate on what's been said if the musician or ever who would have started on a loud rejoicing jubilee type song it would have not that that ability to meditate on what's being saying that's why at the end of the service it shouldn't be something wild thing it should be some deal to get you kind of calm or you can meditate on what's being said then you watch brother brown after the people have been dealt with god's death with them they thought things over they've repented whatever they've done then he says now everybody everybody on your feet now let's say real loud everybody the type you alone sing together now what he done he changed by the leadership of the holy ghost he changed the atmosphere because meditation was over right now sometimes you've got to give your brain a break sometimes you don't need to think i'm letting that soak because you really need to know that sometimes you don't need to think you say brother ben i am a faker sometimes you need to quit well i'll ask you what gets you in more trouble making assumptions and guessing and getting nervous and all out of sorts and not being able to wait on the will of god then thank you but if i don't have you know the old saying is the old adage is brother ben people don't plan to fail they found a plan i agree with that too i believe that's right too but there are times that you need to remember that your plans are it said that if you want to make god laugh just tell him your plans rapture comes at you one i believe there's a time the bible said ponder the direction of your feet so there's times we need to be ready you need to plant the apples and so forth he said like you know the coming of the lord could be 50 years off but you need to be ready like it'd be right now i believe that but i'm talking about something entirely different be ready for the rapture i'm talking about your daily today life because that's where a lot of us struggle at sometimes with the time we just got to give this part of our brain to break because if you go out and you think constantly about every little thing that moves you're going to get nervous you're going to get tore up before long you're dreaming about it before it's all you can talk about you'll notice people that get on it they can't get off it that's all they're thinking about that's why they're talking about it over and over and over again so thank god god has given us away amen stay with me now he's given us a way to give our brain a break let me prove that to you right now in acts chapter 16 verse 25-26 and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god so you've got a church age messenger in a jail cell with you you've got the man that's got the mystery that god right mr god right next to you and yet you don't say hey paul read me more about that ephesians letter about being caught in heavenly places but you you're saying you're saying now why are they doing this think about where they're at a lot of times they're sitting on iron rails they're shackled down many different conditions are there the the stink and the putrification and rats running over and all kinds of things like that i don't mind telling you after a while that would get to this little gray matter between my ears right here called my brain and if that's all i can think about what happens you start getting discouraged you start getting down hearted so paul and silas said hey let's give our brain a break for a little while hallelujah and they prayed and started singing and as they sang watch that verse 26 suddenly there was a great earthquake you know i believe that i believe god got to listen to them they got to like him when he was hearing god saw the tightness foot god sort of clapping his hands angels would say hey hey lord there's a whole horse and my boys are really putting on a good concert right now they may not have known what it was but his dog was patting his foot there was an earthquake shaking the trail said all right this was the original jailhouse rock oh glory why they had to give their brain a break [Music] when you are nervous and tore up and upset the worst thing you can do is put on future home of the heavenly bridegroom [Laughter] one of the worst things that you can do is determine i'm going to read 37 chapters in my bible right now you know why you're stressing your brain even more because if you're like me and you are when you listen to the message you read the bible and things you're working you're laboring in the word you're working as you listen if you're already frazzled you get nothing out of that message whatsoever so what is the answer apply the word but apply a different part of the word in this right application amen i was preaching this the other day another place here in ohio and i said that about the future home another preacher said look out i thought the other one needs to look out because you're going to get embarrassed during a few minutes that's right one of the worst because you know how you are if you're frazzled and upset and nervous and you've got to put on the tape especially something like future home my brother starts out by talking complimenting people on the way their their rooms looked and their behavior in the restaurants and if you're any kind of a slob at all and you're already uh overworked and nervous and then you hear brother talking that way what starts happening the devil jumps on your shoulder and says now i see that that's everything's complimenting them because of how their homes looked how does your home look come on now don't look at it that way what does he do he starts using things again because why you're already frazzled from much thinking so he just takes you that much deeper that much deeper that much deeper you said use the word on the devil i completely agree with you amen but the part of the word i want to use is a little bit different part of the word you want to use i want to use the part of the word where they've done this right here where they gave their brain a break let me prove something to you right now let me drop down here just a little bit let me let me read to you how brother brown did this now brother branham did this and it doesn't really matter to me what anybody thinks about this it's just absolutely the way it ought to be done now here's brother brown of course he's got all these different little uh problems and things that he's dealing with all the time now you know as well as i do brother man had to absolutely get so frazzled sometimes he didn't know how to go up down left or right so brother adam would use these different ways to actually get in there and give his mind a rest now the message i'm looking for i'm trying to get down here to it right quickly i've got a lot of hay on this fork over here but i'm just talking about how he said have you ever got down in the dumps he said go about how god heals by music let me pull over this little place i may have it on this this other little file right here i want to read it to you word for word lord helping me now watch this he said god heals my music and so forth he said sometimes i get kind of feeling tired and wore out just that down calvary actually he said nerves on edge he said i'll jump in my car take out hold of the steering wheel going down the road singing i'm glad that i can say i'm one of them see gripping the steering wheel singing and stopping my foot and shouting after a while i get tired turn home and start something else he says now if brother branham had to go down and go down and and sing to get kind of out of that nervous tired press then what do you think it'll do for us when we do the same thing the same thing for him all right in another place here brother man said if you've ever been down the dumps he says the street expression we call it he said but you kind of got the blues i know some of y'all ain't never probably been there but if you ever get to the dump spill down there go down about halfway down through the middle of it you'll see a big old trash can on the side ben was here so i've been here many many times down in the dust brother brandon said just put on one of those tapes ah see that brother man just keep on reading one of those records or music he says and before you know it now listen brother kind of says this in a way as if almost like it sneaks up on you it does why it's going down through this right side of the brain it drops into the subconscious and before you know it it's making your body react it's making your body pick up changing your intention and picking it up the music that that he's listening to he said this gospel music he said first thing you know you're pat your foot you're clapping your hand it's all over you're up and ready to go again amen now here's the prophet of god that had tapes on the scene when he was here so why didn't brother say go listen to one of my tapes it was all at all amen because listening to a tape doesn't solve everything but you say the word has power i agree but the word in his right application [Applause] i like what brother biscuit said one time he said god man shall live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god he said that's true and that's not true and like my pastor said back home he heard it he said huh he said i'll give you an example he said if god said in the days of noah build an ark and i'll save your household he said in this day and age he said you can build every ark there was and the fire falls you ain't going to be saved he said the days of the passover said paint the door of your of your of your house red with the blood of the lamb he said you could paint your entire house red today and he said it would never save you why it's not just word per se but it is the word of due season remember one of the must have said you must not do is dislocate the word so there are times to read your bible said every christian is this spiritual praise and read the bible every day there's times for that there's times to meditate times to have loud music there's times to listen to the message but there's times that just give your brain a break too thank you jesus oh hallelujah that was in luke and phoenix god heals by music he said just put on one of those tapes the musical record go to playing it he says all over you're up and ready to go again now watch this in in um ephesians chapter 5 verse 18 19 we'll go just a pinch further and i'm going to quit okay because we got two more services and i could i could make you wait a whole lot longer on some of this so tomorrow anyways but get your appetite up a little bit one little bit more of this ephesians 5 18 19. i don't know we'll see how it goes i'm going to hear more on this music i got page after page after page after page we can spend the whole weekend on it really he says be not drunk with wine whereas an excess but be filled with the spirit watch speaking to yourselves in psalms hymns spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord so sometimes i sing to you sometimes i sing to god sometimes i sing down to the devil sometimes i sing to me speaking to yourselves that's why sometimes god ain't wanting to be encouraged you understand god ain't never had to be encouraged sometimes the devil don't want to be told he's a loser he already knows that sometimes i sing to him and tell him he's lost the battle you're a loser amen sometimes i need to sing to me because sometimes me needs to hear that he's still a healer that is still the deliverer that is still a savior that no matter what kind of a wall we're backed up on as christians that he has always got the answer to how to get away from things amen how to get out of master troubles and master problems oh my watch here in colossians 3 16 let the word of christ dwell in you richly with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another watches teaching and admonishing one another how in psalms hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your heart to the lord so you're actually teaching and admonishing through singing through music ah i thought the preachers are the one who could do that not necessarily because sometimes you come to church you're mad at the preacher sometimes you're mad at it but when you go to church you're standing there you don't really feel like being in church but you're trying to do your service to god so you just give an example of what my idea of admonish would be so the person next to you is satan with all their heart before you know it they've pulled you into their atmosphere and you're feeling better why you admonish them in spiritual psalms sitting right here in the congregation that's wife is saying you should sing with all your heart every time you come amen james 5 13 is any among you afflicted let him pray is in he married let him sing psalms amen praise the lord let me just pick this up now come sir as you walk to me i've seen something moving and here is what it is it's anemia your blood one thing you're a nervous person huh nervous person nervous person not the kind that shakes and carries on but the deep thinking so you mean you can be a nervous person just by being a deep thinker that's what brings on the nervousness yes yes he said that's right there's an old saying you're always crossing bridges before you get to them building up things that never happen you can't hide your life he said the man prays for the man he said now sir as you go rejoicing go and be happy okay so how am i supposed to do that again that's it just flip a switch be happy you've got one chance to stand in front of a prophet of god one you wait months to get a prayer card you're right billy it takes a month to give you a prayer card you go stand out weeks before the meeting comes you're standing out hours before you get to the prayer line you stand in front of brother brown he tells you what's wrong with you and then looks at you and says now go be happy i'm going to tell you something if you ain't got a revelation from god about what's going on you're going to put you up a website pretty soon but watch what brother says he says go be happy very next words sing songs all day long you mean that's all there is to it if you're the deep thinking kind yes it is you understand what happens as i told you when you sing the thinking part of your brain shuts off so the devil knows what type of nature this guy's got brethren's actually giving me antidotes watch he said you're that quiet type of person which would hurt you later in life you go on and you just start singing hymns and rejoicing testifying of your healing and it will leave you why didn't brother madam say now look i'm a prophet of god i've laid my hands on you that devil's got better brains and come back after you after all prophets laid his hands on you why didn't that tell him to go sing hymns and be happy you know why that's the approach to the lord this man was fighting that was the approach to this war he knew the only way that he could truly win was if he said let me read you another one do you believe now with all your heart he says i've never seen you don't know you but god knows you don't you want to get over that stomach trouble and be made well he said you believe it's caused from a nervous condition you'll have to do what i tell you in a few minutes just accept your healing right now and go out here just as happy as you can be okay so how do i do that again listen i heard everybody just said today if god gives you something you said to do god's obligated to give you a way to do it amen he says be singing and rejoicing that's how you could just automatically be happy you said but that doesn't make any sense to me all right let me break it down let's say you're this nervous type person right here deep thinking crossing bridges and the devil knows your nature he knows how you think he knows how you are so when you wake up in the morning a lot of times all the devil has to do is drop the stone into the river and he knows that the wailers will take the rest of it you other ways you'll take the rest of it off for the rest of the day so let's say that the next night after this that brother baby said you wake up and the devil comes to you and he says i'm gonna let you know something right now that was a hoax yesterday that man was reading your mind that wasn't god that wasn't anything but now all of a sudden if she yields to that then that mind or hers that left brain starts going like a choo-choo train it just keeps picking up steam picking a momentum and faster and faster all the time but now let me show you the beauty of what i'm preaching to that so when the devil comes by and he says you know what you're not gonna make it all of a sudden you lift your voice up and you start singing i'm gonna make it someday the devil says did you hear what i said to you i'm gonna make it someday after about three or four times that he stomps back down into hell with his tail between his legs and the devil said the devil said to him how'd it go terrible what do you mean terrible i had the perfect plan i had her right where i wanted her i had him right where i wanted him well what happened what happened every time i tried to talk to the left side she turned it off and was keep singing on the right side and i couldn't get a thought in i couldn't get a word in x-wise because she shut it off oh my he said now sister you've been under a strain you've been nervous since she was born i'm not reading your mind but i see your life go back as a little girl stand with me i'm done i'm done let's let's finish this real quick he said you always get care you get scared right a lot of times things will frighten you dogs or something like that you make a noise i see you coming home from school you was running home by a dog one time that makes you real nervous you always feel that way you're the deep thank you kind always upset crossing bridges before you get to them is that right but you're healed now you can go home and eat your supper and be well in the name of the lord jesus he says god bless you he said but go home being happy singing and rejoicing amen why he saw that nature with that person he was deep thinker so this side of the brain is always active it's always going it's always something's always moving you ever see people like that they can't even have a normal conversation with you because they jump from seven to seven seven seven we call it adhd i call it people that aren't trained enough to keep their brain when they need to keep it if that's the case almost every person in the world is adhd nowadays i believe there's a real case of it no doubt for some people their problem is they don't have enough discipline in them to sit down and think they're so used to video games and 10 second commercials and everything like that they expect life to be the same way they watch it on a video to youtube or youtube or some of that kind of stuff nowadays and again you click on youtube has got that 30 second little commercial it likes to kill some of us we can't we're hoping and praying to god they put that skip commercial thing on there that you can click it off in three seconds to get right down to the thing and so we sit down and try to go through life that very same way chop chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp the devil sees that he sees it you're in a rush and a gush and a push all that all the time so he knows that if he can keep this part of your brain working all the time that you're constantly rushing you're constantly pushing and you never get yourself a rest and when you start getting down in your health and you start getting weak you don't serve the lord like you used to yes sir yes sir right you all that but you just cannot put forth the efforts that you used to why because your whole system is so fatigued that you absolutely cannot keep up with the pace so god give us music in this to give this part of our brain a break from time to time i'm gonna tell you something i have applied this to my life brother jesse i have this has revolutionized my life because i happen to be one of these type of guys always thinking i wake up more my wife said you sleep so no i worked all night that's true my brain never rest always one thing another another another all the time david said cry loud on your beds it wouldn't hurt us to have some singing and thanks before we went to sleep relax our mind and get us in that quiet tight mode where our brain begins shutting down and entering into the subconscious arrest technology has gotten slower they say even that little light from your phone looking at it an hour before you go to sleep so disrupts your brain waves that you can't have perfect rest don't you see what the devil's doing he is working his best to get a people of lady osea that is nothing but fatigue people fatigued tired people that's why they don't have time for the gospel they don't have time for revivals they don't have time to read the bible because they're always exhausted and that's his trick yes sir yes sir so god give us the ability to give our brain a break oh my thank you lord jesus how do you do lady now this won't hurt you that's the holy spirit such a wonderful anointing he said it turns dark around the woman as i see her moving in some doctor's office they keep shaking their head they don't know what's wrong with her but he knows your main trouble is nervous it's a spasm like the nerves causing you to feel horrible all the time they can't find it because it's a devil their instruments won't show a spirit they might have hid from the x-ray he might have but he can't hide from god god looks right through him now lady you don't know me but you've had an up and down life all the time you desired a deeper life of god desired a deeper study with god to live for him because you've had your troubles i don't mind telling you this sounds like me this sounds like me i've always desired something deeper haven't you don't you feel the same way this woman did he said that can't be hit it's not for this audience to know you've had your troubles that's the point you've got to die but will you take my advice as this prophet go out of here tonight happy listen it makes it sound like an automatic thing it's very next words go out singing go out rejoicing and forget that it ever happened to you and you'll be well tell me how you're supposed to forget something that's been a main struggle all your life how are you supposed to forget it you shut it off you shut it off every time the devil brings it up you say i'm gonna make it one day amen every time the devil throws it back in your mind says hear me sing grace i sleep you say but i'm not a good singer that's all right maybe your scale of singing doesn't fit in with a scale that me and sister would play over here but the bible said every sound has a distinct sound so maybe it doesn't fit into our earthly scale but i'm sure it fits into his heavenly scale if there's someone else because every sound fits in so you may not be right on the note but i'm sure it fits into his notes somewhere how do you forget it shut this part of your brain off and open this part up let the holy spirit let him move into your subconscious and do things for you oh my let's pray together lord jesus thank you for your word tonight lord god i'm so so privileged to hear the things that i get to hear tonight lord not because of me preaching it lord be foolish for me to think that even comes from me in the first place but lord because of what i hear you say through my mouth but i hear out of your word thank you for it thank you lord jesus it's such a wonderful privilege lord to be gathered under the auspices of your presence thank you father for everything that you've accomplished here tonight lord jesus lord i've preached this out here to your children i know the devil is standing right there trying to steal us out of their hearts but lord it's the truth and i pray that you seal it into them sealing into them lord god that the devil can't get over to it with the blood of christ around these teachings tonight lord may they just bring forth fruit 30 60 80 100 140 whatever the outcome may be just let it bring forth fruit yes lord jesus help us to learn how to give our minds a break help us lord father so much confuses and bothers and torments us but lord if you'll help us we'll learn how to rest ourselves from time to time i thank you for this little sermon not just tonight but i mean the sermon itself lord as you saw we had just a great great great shake up here this the other night back at total church some real troubles come up lord jesus normally that would have tore me all to pieces but lord because my mind was rested i've been able to take it it's been not really that big of a problem to me grieved and bothered by certain people yes offended by certain things that have been done and said lord hurt for people that aren't living right sure but lord i was amazed at how much easier i was able to take this because i've been applying this sermon to my life god if it can do that for me what can it do for mothers what can it do for fathers for workers for husbands wives might what could it do for young people what can it do for all of us if we would learn to take the pressure off of us as your prophet taught us there is a place that the bride could go to learn to let off the pressure lord i think we found an answer tonight and how to get free from some of these things i pray you'd help us help us lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen praise the lord praise the lord jesus and just raise your hands to it now for just a moment let's just worship him this man can we hallelujah thank you lord jesus thank you mighty father we love you lord god we appreciate you my lord jesus oh hallelujah hallelujah we

tonight god bless you till tomorrow night amen the lord bless you each one good to see each one love y'all [Music] oh mercy [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] that was a tremendous message amen that was the absolute masterpiece you know a few weeks ago you remember when i preached on the anchor the soul on the wednesday night remember that i ended with showing how nervous this is what got sister bruce thinking she wasn't born again it was just nervousness brother branham said you think of one thing and you focus on it over and over that's good when you go to pray for people that's bad when you start doubting your testimony that was just a few weeks ago any brother said that's worse than cancer yeah being a nervous person i'm worried about everything all these things i thought was so beautiful i just i just listened to that day on calvary on easter i remember brother everybody had to get this car installed down the road just to relax and i preached out here before church it's a it's the grace of god i just want to say a few things when you when we stop thinking about it it's casting our cares upon the lord casting those thoughts upon the lord and just letting the other side just relax in his grace and his mercy at church i know we got a lot of deep thinkers in here [Music] the church said some people are more happy-go-lucky they don't ever worry about too much things but some people we really think about and analyze a lot of things in life that was for us tonight [Music] and if that's you you really need to take that to heart [Music] i'll be honest i'm more happy kind of go lucky person i don't really analyze a whole lot of things even as a teacher i've learned i learned things but i've always thought my mind you can't get to make all these plans and they don't come to pass because the problems come up i've learned to try to balance a little bit of planning but also ready to just go off and do whatever you need to do to meet the need of the hour but i know there's some of us that just analyze everything we've got to be able to balance that this word was for us praise god for all of us but especially those of us who go over one thing the person said that but what about that this morning and just go over and over and run it through our minds as a pastor i battle that because sometimes i get emails uh you know from people that leave the messenger you know you know you people especially especially on youtube i get all kinds of things and if i'm not careful i'll stew over that question all day or they criticize me and say you idiot or you you listen if i'm not careful that that's when i get hurt and then say knows what he's doing too when i feel like i've failed somebody that's when i get hurt oh man if i don't release that care and cast it upon the lord i don't get me and i'm not even that deep that my makeup but how many grateful that the word in due season comes when we need to burst apparently god thought it that we needed this message tonight that you would be here and i would be here i was just telling my wife you found this beautiful accused acoustic music on itunes of this christian man his lyrics are all about the bride he's not even a messenger believer it's about going ascending up to god in the holy city and worshiping when the gates open into some of the most beautiful music and i'll just lay the episode and turn that music on just pray i'll just start weeping and crying just enjoying prayer again because of the beautiful the skillful remember the skillful play play the interest with skillful play and then words that mean something as brother ben said not just a chant and uh over and over but words that have deep meaning to them about the bride and the rapture and all gathered scene jesus and lay throwing our crowns at the feet of jesus it has been so refreshing to me and that has spoken to me and the bible said they'll keep thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee not stayed on our problems but stayed on the songs and the worship and the glory of god i'm really grateful for the scripture that's just our heads i just want to ask one more time i don't even say brother jess pray for me i'm that kind of a person i just worry and i cross bridges before i analyze everything pray for me that god will help me to sing in those times god bless those hands i'll pray for you you pray for me i get discouraged when i feel like i fail people i'm not doing enough i don't see enough fruit in my life or the ministry or something like that you pray for me pray for others that you know you're not looking around but there's others that have their hands up pray for other people let's pray heavenly father lord i know this message was for us or we all battled this at some point as the brother said we all battle stewing over things crossing bridges trying to make our plans lord that's what you might have in our pants sometimes as we heard tonight lord forgive us of our humanity lord forgive us of our efforts to figure things out forgive us lord and lord thank you that for those of us who think deeply analyze things this message was for us tonight may we leave here happy rejoicing and knowing the antidote how to overcome all these deep thoughts it's by stopping to think about it casting our cares upon the lord for the lord cares for us and just singing and making melody and worshiping and loving god and lord it'll turn our trust to be a new dear god we'll turn our eyes from evil things return our thoughts from evil things lord and we'll be refreshed because of the peace that passes our understanding lord we're going to leave her happy tonight rejoicing because of the word we heard thank you for leading our brother to preach on that lord if you want to preach on that tomorrow night we'd love to hear more on it guide our brother for tomorrow but lord may we leave here tonight blessed and free from all let's not worry about money let's not worry about relationships let's not worry about other stresses on the job of us not to worry about any the future or the politics or government or anything help us not to worry help us just to trust in the one who holds tomorrow lord god you all are today and you hold our tomorrow our faith is in you you've already provided what we have need of tomorrow we thank you for that jesus so bless those that have their hands up lord and we pray for all them i pray for lord i trust they're praying for me to help me overcome my trials when i get criticized when the devil tries to attack me help me to be encouraged lord in the name of jesus christ the church said i love you let's give a round of applause [Applause] the bible says the holy ghost just blows whatever you don't know you gotta come every time make sure you don't miss it amen oh thank you jesus let's see one more song he's already provided now let's close your eyes and like i said i was thinking this back here seeing this as a happy song he's already provided what you need whatever you're struggling with whatever you were struggling with whatever you were worried about you're not going to worry about it tonight there's no sense there's no virtue and worry there's no strength or victory and worrying about it we're trying to figure it out we're just going to know that god already provided the answer let's see it with
