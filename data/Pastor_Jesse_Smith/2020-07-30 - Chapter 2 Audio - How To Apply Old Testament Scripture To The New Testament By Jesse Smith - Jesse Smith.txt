TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 2 how to apply old testament scripture to the new testament includes footnotes 90 to 177 and there shall no wise enter into it anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lamb's book of life revelation 21 verse 27. new testament believers need the old testament for a variety of reasons peter instructed believers to live holy lives and be mindful of old testament scripture because its fulfillment was guaranteed paul wrote that we must learn from it and admonished us to remember the decisions of rebellious israel on their journey from egypt to canaan that we might take heed lest we fall into similar temptations all scripture which includes old testament writings is profitable for doctrine reproof correction and instruction in righteousness rightly dividing the old testament scripture new testament teachers must rightly divide the word of truth old testament scripture is to be rightly divided or placed in one or more of the nine following categories ceremonial laws not in effect for christians but in effect for jews laws not in effect for christians but in effect for jews moral laws still in effect for jews and christians allegorical truths for christians foreshadowing for christians direct prophecy for jews and christians history for jews and christians wisdom for jews and christians psalms for jews and christians these nine categories provide structure for correctly placing scripture but are not meant to limit a passage to only one category passages can be placed in multiple categories for example genesis 22 verse 8 says and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together as a new testament teacher i can place this scripture in three of the nine categories foreshadowing for christians direct prophecy for jews and christians and history for jews and christians genesis 22 verse 8 is foreshadowing for christians because god provided a lamb for abraham that foreshadowed him providing jesus christ the lamb of god for abraham's seed direct prophecy for jews and christians is a fitting category because god was prophesying that he alone would prepare the body of jesus christ to be a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world jews and gentiles included just as he alone prepared the lamb to take isaac's place on mount moriah genesis 22 verse 8 is history for jews and gentiles because both groups can agree that the details and events of the passage are factual i must clarify the difference between christians and jews christians recognize jesus christ as the promised messiah the christ the redeemer of mankind and the one who fulfilled all the old testament prophecy about the son of god furthermore christians are those who have repented of their sins been baptized in the name of the lord jesus been born again of the spirit of god and are observing all of jesus's commands jews on the other hand do not believe jesus christ fulfilled the prophecies about their promised messiah true jews obey the laws of moses and have a zeal for god but do not have the knowledge that jesus christ is their messiah when israel rejected jesus as their messiah god chose to blind the eyes of the jews from believing in jesus christ in order that he might save the gentiles the nine categories first ceremonial laws are old testament laws that pertain to the aaronic priesthood that are no longer in effect for new testament believers but are in effect for jews some examples of these laws include sacrificing animals physical requirements for ministers and hereditary requirements for the priesthood however orthodox jews do not carry out the ceremonial laws because they lack a temple second old testament laws that are no longer in effect for the new testament include various laws such as circumcision prohibited foods and the instant death penalty for blasphemy these laws were given to israel through the prophet moses to all the children of israel but are no longer in effect in the new testament third there are many moral laws from the old testament that are still in effect today including the ten commandments numerous abominations and tithing the ten commandments of moses are still in effect in the new testament as shown in figure one although saturday sabbath-keeping has a different application for christians a separate section of this chapter addresses the fourth commandment the abominations of homosexuality justifying the wicked worshipping graven images and partaking in idolatry are still abominable in the sight of god today for new testament believers figure 1 the 10 commandments from exodus chapter 20 verses 1 to 17 and its corresponding new testament scripture the first commandment no other gods before me still in effect according to matthew 4 verse 10. the second commandment make no graven images still in effect in the new testament according to revelation 9 verse 20 and acts 17 29 the third commandment do not take the name of the lord in vain still in effect in the new testament according to matthew 6 verse 9. the fourth commandment keep the sabbath day holy this has a new application in the new testament according to hebrews 4 verse 9 and matthew 11 verse 28. the new testament sabbath is the believer resting or ceasing from his sinful works and then doing the works of the holy ghost this spiritual rest begins when a person is born again of the holy ghost according to isaiah 28 verses 11 and 12 first corinthians 14 verses 21 and 22 and hebrews 4 verses 1 through 12. the fifth commandment honor thy father and mother still in effect in the new testament according to ephesians chapter 6 verses 1-3 the sixth commandment thou shalt not kill still in effect in the new testament according to galatians 5 verse 21 the seventh commandment thou shalt not commit adultery still in effect in the new testament according to first corinthians 6 verses 9 and 10. the eighth commandment thou shalt not steal still in effect in the new testament according to first corinthians 6 verse 10 the ninth commandment thou shalt not bear false witness stone effect in the new testament according to ephesians 4 verse 25 the tenth commandment thou shalt not covet still in effect according to first corinthians 6 verse 10. fourth there is a category called allegorical truths that certain old testament scriptures can be placed into for our learning allegories are symbolic expressions that are interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning examples include ishmael and isaac manasseh and ephraim and abraham's faith in isaac as his seed ishmael the son of the bondwoman hagar represents those under the old testament law who were trying to earn salvation through their own fleshly efforts isaac represented new testament believers who were believing the promises of god by faith and were saved by grace manasseh the firstborn son represents the jews who should have received christ as their messiah as he was first sent to them ephraim the younger represents the gentiles who receive the blessing through the cross or crossed hands of their grandfather jacob galatians declares the blessing of abraham came upon the gentiles through the cross of jesus christ although god asked abraham to sacrifice his son isaac hebrews teaches that abraham had accounted that god was able to raise him up from the dead instead god provided a ram to die in isaac's place and abraham received him in a figure or allegory of jesus christ taking our place in death foreshadowing for christians is the fifth category and are referred to as types types foretell someone or some event to come in the future examples of types include the role of joseph as savior and abraham's divinely provided ram as a substitutionary sacrifice joseph son of jacob was a type of jesus christ as he was sold for 20 pieces of silver which foreshadowed jesus being sold for 30 pieces of silver this fifth category requires bible teachers to be careful how they interpret types as not all types are a perfect match like the example of joseph being sold for 20 pieces of silver and yet jesus was sold for 30 pieces just as joseph was falsely accused and put in prison so was jesus arrested falsely while incarcerated joseph and jesus were both surrounded by two men one lived and one died abraham's divinely provided ram as a sacrifice foreshadowed jesus as god's promised sacrifice for mankind the ram took the place of abraham's son or seed likewise god supernaturally prepared the body of jesus christ through the spirit's conception in the womb of the virgin mary and led his son to die for abraham's spiritual seed there is an exciting prophetic aspect to foreshadowing at times the holy spirit speaks through old testament stories to instruct us regarding future events such as the second coming of jesus christ we can use the life of joseph son of jacob for an example of the second coming of christ joseph and his brothers represent jesus and his brethren the jewish people we know joseph's brothers were blinded to his identity when they went to egypt to request food but joseph eventually revealed his identity to them and saved their lives scripture teaches that joseph put out everyone from before him which would have included his wife when he revealed his identity to his brothers allegorically we know the scriptural fact that jesus brethren the jews are currently blinded to his identity as their messiah so that the gentiles can be saved but one day jesus will reveal his true identity to the jews and he will save them from their sins christ will seal them with the baptism of the holy ghost which is the seal of god described as the seal of god in their foreheads this foreshadow helps teach that the wife of jesus christ the new testament gentile believers will be gone from the earth and raptured up into heaven while jesus stands on mount zion and reveals his identity to his brethren the 144 000 believing israelis the sixth category is direct prophecy and three examples of this category are the rapture the new heavens and earth and jesus's resurrection regarding the rapture it is striking to find that paul used isaiah 25 verse 8 as a direct prophecy for the gentile church in first corinthians 15 verse 54. we should learn a critical lesson in this category the holy ghost can seemingly pull out a scripture from any old testament location and apply it to the new testament believer in any way he purposes god's ways are past finding out he is the author of the word and thereby is the only one that knows how to correctly interpret scripture the new heavens and new earth are direct prophecies found in both the old and new testaments peter echoes isaiah's prophecy and then reminds us to be diligent and steadfast in our walk with the lord jesus resurrection is directly prophesied by david in psalm 16 verse 10 and then recorded as fulfilled in acts 2 verse 27. history wisdom and psalms are the final three categories old testament history includes all the events and details from the creation of the world in genesis until the conclusion of the book of malachi books of wisdom include proverbs and ecclesiastes the psalms include 150 songs that focus on the themes of god's glory and wisdom numerous songs are prayers to god and also include heartfelt lamentations that both jews and gentiles can appreciate the new testament sabbath the saturday sabbath day is the only command of the ten commandments that has a new application for christians christians must not be deceived into thinking they will be lost if they work on saturday although there are physical and spiritual benefits to slowing down our lifestyles jesus taught that there is something greater than just resting one day of the week jesus christ offered rest for our souls not just rest for our bodies after his resurrection jesus breathed on his disciples constraining them to receive the born-again experience the baptism of the holy ghost the obedient disciples honored their master and did indeed receive the born-again experience or soul rest as recorded in acts chapter 2. soul rest means that jesus wants us to rest completely from our sinful works the new testament sabbath is for the christian to be born again of the holy spirit and to trust or rest in god the prophet isaiah foretold this born-again experience or soul rest more than 700 years before jesus christ lived on the earth isaiah said for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear notice that isaiah plainly said this is the rest the new rest is connected to god using stammering lips to speak to his people which is fulfilled in acts chapter 2 for they spoke with tongues as the spirit gave them utterance in first corinthians 14 verse 21 paul later quotes isaiah 28 verses 11 and 12 and connects it to the tongues that were given to the jews and all other unbelieving nations in acts chapter 2. paul wrote that saturday sabbath days were a shadow of things to come in colossians 2 verses 16 and 17. god's purpose of saturday sabbath keeping in the old testament points to something greater to come jesus teaches that the true rest is the born-again experience he proclaims in john 3 verse 7 and john 7 verses 37 and 39 in reference to believers receiving the holy ghost jesus says ye must be born again and if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water in the born-again experience a christian rests or walks according to the spirit and does not fulfill the lusts of the flesh for the remainder of his earthly walk the spirit-filled christian will rest or cease from doing lustful sinful habits and will do works that please god now that's a true rest i would much rather rest for my sinful works every day of my life than just relaxing on each saturday but continue in sinful works if you can see the truth about the spiritual rest god is offering today and enter into that rest your obedience will delight the lord jesus christ our god delights more in constant daily rest from sin than just physically resting one day of the week thankfully if we truly receive the baptism of the holy ghost and rest from our sinful lives we will actually have a physical day of rest built into our week which is sunday how great is the wisdom of our god just as the early christians met on the first day of the week so we meet every sunday to honor the resurrection of jesus christ true christians will not forsake the assembling of the saints on the first day of the week because sincere meetings provide spiritual meat edification comfort consolation and more two or three witnesses the holy spirit guides bible teachers to correctly categorize an old testament scripture in one or more of the nine categories to prove the classification is correct the spirit provides the teachers with two or three witnesses from other bible passages jesus and paul both speak of the necessity of having multiple witnesses to establish a word of truth isaiah writes a similar thought that doctrine or instruction must be built line upon line precept upon precept faithful bible teachers use more than one scripture to support their beliefs three doctrinal examples of using two or three scriptural witnesses to prove that an old testament command remains binding in the new testament are the sin of homosexuality the command for children to honor their parents and paying tithes to one's local church all three of these subjects are relevant to and essential for today's world the sin of homosexuality was an abomination in the old testament and is still a sin today homosexuality has multiple old testament witnesses to establish it as a sin three new testament witnesses established this act as a deplorable sin romans 1 verses 26 through 32 first corinthians 6 verses 9 through 11 and first timothy 1 verses 10 and 11. with two or three witnesses in both the old and new testaments homosexuality is easily placed in the category of moral laws still in effect for jews and christians the fifth commandment of moses for children to honor their parents is taught in the old testament in exodus 20 verse 12 and deuteronomy 5 verse 16. but is this command still required today yes because the fifth command has two new testament bible witnesses matthew 19 verse 19 and ephesians 6 verses 1 and 2. just as in the case of homosexuality we conclude from the multiple bible witnesses that children must honor their parents as a binding command in the new testament faithful bible teachers place this command in the category of moral laws still in effect for jews and christians a third example is tithing 10 of your income to your local church in the old testament tithing predated the law of moses as both abraham and jacob tithed leviticus 27 verse 30 and deuteronomy 12 verse 11 are two of the numerous scriptures that commanded tithing in the old testament but is tithing a new testament command yes there are five reasons tithing is still a new testament command and should be placed in the category of moral laws still in effect for jews and christians first the new testament never abolishes tithing second jesus said tithing was one of the least of the commands which means it is still command third jesus never stopped anyone from paying tithes fourth paul teaches that the ministers who preach the gospel should live of the gospel in first corinthians 9 verses 9 and 14. the apostle referenced the old testament lesson of not muzzling the ox that treads out the corn and applied it to new testament preachers last hebrews records that abraham willingly paid ties to melchizedek who was god in a flesh body as a prefigure of the true high priest jesus christ since abraham the father of the faith paid tithes without a written command the holy spirit compels christians to pay tithes and offerings because believers are the children or seed of abraham through faith in jesus christ we are not under the law one common phrase i often hear in reply to my bible teaching on doctrine is we are not under the old testament however paul often uses old testament scripture to provide authority for new testament living there is value in teaching from the entire bible as paul said all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness clearly we are not obligated to fulfill every command in the old testament all the ceremonial laws of sacrificial rituals were a shadow of good things to come that jesus christ's crucifixion fulfilled christ declared it is finished on the cross signaling the end to the aaronic priesthood and beginning of the new covenant with better promises paul's writings from romans and galatians teach that we are not under the law meaning we are not saved by our individual works or by our own righteousness the law has the power to curse anyone who does not keep every single old testament commandment in contrast new testament believers are saved by grace through faith in jesus christ for christ bore the curse of god for our sins on the cross of calvary thus the phrase we are not under the old testament is true but must be applied correctly new testament teachers should use appropriate old testament scripture to build doctrine as paul did in ephesians and first corinthians paul affirmed the fifth commandment that children should honor their parents if christians are not under the old testament then where did paul get his authority to teach the children are to obey their parents and also promise them a long life on the earth paul's authority to teach the fifth commandment to christians came from jesus as he was taught his gospel by the revelation of jesus christ it's clear that the fifth commandment is categorized as a moral law still in effect for jews and christians the righteousness of the law is still important to god today when christians walk in obedience to the holy spirit they are fulfilling the righteousness of the law first corinthians 15 verses 51 to 58 also demonstrates paul's reliance on the old testament passages as foundation for new testament truths while writing about the future event of the rapture the holy spirit inspired paul to use the same bible phrase as the prophet isaiah death is swallowed up in victory written over 800 years earlier thus both isaiah and paul were preparing us for the catching away of the spirit-filled saints as we look for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ isaiah 28 verse 8 is categorized as direct prophecy for jews and christians along with these two examples the new testament is replete with references to god's words from the old covenant bible teachers must use the old testament as directed by the holy ghost we owe it to ourselves and those in our realm of influence to continue to study and understand the old testament as the spirit of truth guides us to rightly divide the word of truth a study into new testament teaching will help you understand that we are to fulfill the righteousness of the law according to romans 8 verse 4. christians should willingly choose to obey god's word obeying the will of the holy spirit the law that we are currently under is the law of the spirit this holy law will never lead us into sin but rather into complete obedience to the word of god jesus walked in the law of the spirit in his life because the spirit abode upon him the spirit led christ into full obedience to the word of god and so the spirit will lead our lives the exact same way law of moses was holy just and good but without the power of the new testament relationship with god the believer could not fulfill the righteousness of the law christians today should not despise the law of moses but rather desire to obey the holy nature of the law and those righteous commands that god has carried over into the new testament obeying the holy nature is possible because god's spirit now writes his law upon the fleshly tables of our hearts god's nature has become our nature blanket statements we are not under the law seems to be a blanket statement that people use who do not want to hear old testament scripture used to teach new testament believers believers are called to grow in the knowledge and understanding of god christians should never answer a matter before hearing it as modeled by the saints in berea who search the scripture daily to determine the truth of paul's preaching proverbs says answering a matter too soon without studying it out is a shame and sign of folly some blatant statements are true or partially true while others are false i want to give examples of each kind of statement to help the reader learn how to rightly divide every blanket statement for every blanket statement needs two or three witnesses to prove it true a well-known blanket statement that is true is jesus christ is the only way to the father and no one gets to heaven except through christ this is true based upon john 14 verse 6 acts 4 verse 12 and matthew 25 verses 31-46 most bible readers are very familiar with john 14 6 and acts 4 12 but matthew 25 verses 31 to 46 provides additional support to the fact that no one will enter eternal life except through the mercy of jesus christ in this scene of separation on the day of judgment we see jesus granting eternal life to surprised individuals these surprised ones question when did we help you thereby deserving eternal life this question shows two great truths first the least christian is a genuine representation and ambassador of jesus christ on this earth although not recognized as such by the world some who do good acts to the least known christians will receive eternal life from jesus christ second there will be surprises on the day of judgment from this text it seems possible that perhaps muslims buddhists or members of other faiths that reject jesus christ as savior may be granted eternal life simply due to their treatment of his faithful followers the true christians perhaps gamalia and nicodemus will be granted life because they stood for christians in a time of trouble here are some true blanket statements regarding bible doctrine that may surprise you but yet are 100 percent accurate with at least two or three witnesses from scripture no person in the new testament was ever recorded as being baptized in the titles father son and holy ghost all recorded baptisms use the literal name of jesus christ lord jesus or lord god never asked one godly woman to cut or trim her hair instead all godly women had uncut hair as seen in numerous texts john 12 verses 1 to 8 luke 7 verses 36 to 50 first corinthians 11 verses 1 to 16 and revelation 9 verse 8. god never called himself three persons because he is one person instead he said he was the only god and there was no one beside him jesus was never called the second person because he is the physical image of god's one person instead he was called emmanuel mighty god and everlasting father jesus never called a woman to be an apostle our lord called only men to be apostles additionally paul forbade any woman from teaching men according to first timothy 2 verse 12 and first corinthians 14 verses 34 and 35 the apostles never asked anyone if they wanted to invite jesus into their hearts for salvation instead the apostles preached repentance immersion water and the infilling of the holy ghost this list could indeed grow but i hope it opened your eyes to the fact that much of modern christendom has strayed from teaching sound bible doctrine before making a blanket statement about the bible search the scriptures to answer each question that may come to your mind abominations an abomination is one specific type of moral law that means a disgusting thing in the sight of god according to the hebrew lexicon deuteronomy 12 31 states that god hates abominations god's holy eternal city the new jerusalem will not have any abominable work within its domain since there are 166 scriptures that mention abominations it behooves us to know which acts are abominations in the sight of god today because we want to live in the new jerusalem with christ jesus for all eternity after reading all 166 abomination scriptures i have found three old testament abominations that are no longer abominable in the sight of god for the new testament believer eating a peace offering on the third day offering a blemish animal sacrifice and eating unclean foods eating a peace offering on the third day is no longer an abomination because new testament believers are no longer required to offer animal sacrifices as jesus christ was the once for all sacrifice that god has provided for believers jesus is both our offering in peace as we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ offering a blemish animal sacrifice is no longer an abomination in the new testament because we have already established that god gave us the offering of the body of jesus christ to replace the blood of bulls and goats but it is important to note that our worship in the new testament must be according to the spirit and truth or else the worship is offered in vain there is a spiritual application of this old testament abomination that we can apply to our worship today as we must offer our bodies as a living sacrifice unto god unclean foods from the israeli diet are no longer abominations for the new testament believer as evidenced through peter's heavenly vision in acts 10 verses 9 to 18. the fact that god did away with these dietary abominations was so surprising that peter told the lord not so three times after the lord instructed him to rise kill and eat all manner of four-footed beasts wild beasts creeping things and fowls of the air paul's teaching supports god's visions to peter saying for every creature of god is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer the only dietary restrictions for christians are not eating blood strangled animals or foods dedicated unto idols here is a list of the abominations that still remain detestable to god and the new testament believer and are categorized as moral laws still in effect for jews and christians note that each abomination has at least two or three witnesses according to the rule for establishing an old testament moral law as a binding command for the new testament believer justifying sin proverbs 17 15 2 thessalonians 2 verses 10 to 12 and jude 4 homosexuality first corinthians 6 verse 9 romans 1 verses 26 through 32 and 1st timothy 1 verse 10. idolatry engraven images galatians 5 verses 20 and 21 revelation 13 verses 14 and 15. revelation 21 verse 8 and revelation 22 verses 14 and 15 murder deuteronomy 12 31 and revelation 21 verse 8. witchcraft deuteronomy 18 verses 11 and 12 and galatians 5 verses 20 and 21 worshipping with a wicked heart proverbs 15 verse 8 and matthew 7 verses 21 through 23 diverse weights and measures or extortion deuteronomy 25 verses 13-16 and first corinthians 6 verse 10 forward perverse or wicked thoughts hearts and ways proverbs 3 32 proverbs 15 verse 9 and chapter 15 verse 26 and acts 20 verses 29 and 30. seven abominations of proverbs 6 verses 16 through 19. pride lying murder wicked thoughts pursuing mischief false witness and sowing discord according to first john 2 verse 16 revelation 21 verse 8 romans 1 verses 29 through 32 acts 13 verse 10 romans 13 verse 9 and romans 16 verses 17 and 18. god's immutable character allows us to rightly divide the actions that either gain his approval or disapproval blessing or curse as satan increases his attacks against the true church faithful bible teachers need to continue giving more of their time focus attention and energy into denouncing abominations and feeding the people of god the truth true doctrine will save both the preacher and those that believe him magnifying the law to fulfill the law jesus christ did not come to earth to destroy the law but rather to fulfill it isaiah teaches that christ magnified the law saying he will magnify the law to magnify is to enlarge as with a microscope using a microscope you can see life forms that were previously unseen because they are enlarged jesus did the same enlarging of the law of moses when he preached the sermon on the mount in matthew concerning adultery in matthew 5 verses 27 through 32 jesus magnified or enlarged the unseen root problem of adultery when he revealed a previously unseen life form causing it the spirit of lust jesus taught that imagining lustful adultery reaps the same guilt as committing the physical act the spirit of lust is simply a fallen angel or demon power otherwise known as an evil spirit the wisdom of jesus enlarged the law so we can examine the root problem of adultery which is the unseen evil spirit of lust thankfully christians can clean the inside of their cups or their thought lives and be truly clean before the lord conversely the pharisees cleaned only the outside of the cup and not the inside as we clean out our minds bringing every thought into the captivity of christ we submit ourselves to the law of the spirit as a result the spirit quickens or makes the word of god live in our personal lives on a daily basis scripture teaches that you can fulfill all of the law through one powerful channel love paul said you should owe only love to others and that love would fulfill all the law this love would not have been possible without the work of jesus christ on calvary as he shed his love upon us in the form of the holy ghost true love is the holy spirit for the holy spirit is god and god is love christians do not seek to destroy the old testament like christ believers see the magnification of the old testament laws and understand how the law of the spirit helps them fulfill all righteousness and obedience in their daily lives conclusion the holy spirit always rightly divides the word of truth in the mouth of two or three witnesses faithful bible teachers and students test all statements with scripture to find whether they are true including blanket statements creeds and traditions of men proving all things now that you know how the holy spirit rightly divides the word of truth you can begin looking into all scripture to understand god's perfect will for your outward appearance beginning with the four guidelines for modest clothing
