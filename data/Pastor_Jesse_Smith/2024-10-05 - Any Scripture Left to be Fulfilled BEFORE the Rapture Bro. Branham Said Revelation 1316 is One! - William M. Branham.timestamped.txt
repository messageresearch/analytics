[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] so we've got things here in the
[0:05] scripture that must be fulfilled and
[0:07] that is one of the things this boy
[0:10] caught to
[0:12] come greetings friends in the matchless
[0:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ are there
[0:17] Bible verses yet to be fulfilled before
[0:20] the pre-tribulation Rapture of the Bride
[0:22] of Jesus Christ I believe the answer is
[0:25] yes in this video by God's grace I'll
[0:26] show five scriptures that I believe
[0:29] still need to be fulfilled before the
[0:31] Rapture can take place and we'll also go
[0:33] through numerous quotes from God's
[0:35] Prophet late William brandham hi friends
[0:37] I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ
[0:39] Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I
[0:41] defend the original Gospel of the Lord
[0:43] Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul
[0:46] then had to restore through Martin
[0:47] Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet
[0:49] William Maran Branham who lived from
[0:51] 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother
[0:54] bram's Godly Christian character this
[0:56] week I was studying and I came across a
[0:58] quote from 1962 the spoken words
[1:00] Original Seed and brother Braham said we
[1:03] have scripture yet to be fulfilled i'
[1:05] had forgotten about this quote so I
[1:06] wanted to make a video about this topic
[1:08] by the grace of God over the last few
[1:10] years I've heard numerous preachers say
[1:12] there are no scriptures left to be
[1:14] fulfilled that never sat well with me to
[1:16] me it's illogical how can we still be
[1:19] here if there's no more scriptures to be
[1:21] fulfilled How can there be no scriptures
[1:23] being fulfilled at this current time
[1:25] that never made any sense to me and yet
[1:28] the preachers claim to be using quotes
[1:29] from God's Prophet brother brandham so I
[1:31] had my thoughts and my opinions and I've
[1:33] kind of put this up on the Shelf but
[1:34] then this week I came across this quote
[1:36] where brother BR plainly says there are
[1:38] scriptures yet to be fulfilled and that
[1:40] caused me to put these scriptures and
[1:41] quotes together so hopefully this video
[1:43] is a Blessing by the grace of God I like
[1:46] to begin with two quotes from God's
[1:47] Prophet brother brandham where he says
[1:49] he doesn't think there's one thing left
[1:51] in the prophetic word that would hinder
[1:53] the coming of the Lord Jesus the first
[1:55] quote is from
[1:56] 1956 and the second quotee is from
[1:58] 1964 I'll begin with the hear ye hymn
[2:01] quotee from 1956 here brother Ram says
[2:03] there isn't one thing left as I see in
[2:05] the prophetic word one thing left or one
[2:08] thing hindering the coming of the Lord
[2:09] Jesus not one thing left in the Bible
[2:12] everything has been fulfilled now think
[2:14] of this friends 6 years later 1962
[2:16] brother Braham said there was scripture
[2:17] to be fulfilled he said it was the
[2:19] boycott scriptures and again the fact
[2:22] that we have quotes on both sides of
[2:24] this topic prove the insanity of people
[2:26] who say every word on brother Ram's
[2:28] tapes is thus say the Lord
[2:30] they're Anointed with a lying demonic
[2:32] Spirit but anyways let's listen to this
[2:34] quote 1956 hear ye himym there isn't one
[2:37] thing left because I see in the in the
[2:39] prophetic word one thing left a one
[2:43] thing hindering the coming of the Lord
[2:45] Jesus Christ this very hour not one
[2:48] thing Less in the Bible everything has
[2:50] been fulfilled waiting now for the
[2:52] coming of the Lord Jesus next let's look
[2:56] at the quote from The Trial 1964 brother
[2:59] Ram says I don't don't see one thing to
[3:00] hinder him from coming right now
[3:02] everything is setting just exactly right
[3:04] now for his coming now this is
[3:06] interesting this is 2 years after
[3:07] brother Ram said there was scripture yet
[3:09] to be fulfilled and of course we'll show
[3:11] some more quotes soon but let's listen
[3:12] to this one a trial 1964 and I believe
[3:16] court I want to say something to you
[3:18] this afternoon that I don't see one
[3:21] thing to hander him from coming right
[3:23] now that the world if I had time I could
[3:26] prove it to you is setting perfectly
[3:28] even by names and position the way it's
[3:30] supposed to be setting when he comes
[3:33] when is the hour I know not no one knows
[3:35] but he said when these comes to pass
[3:38] look up now I want to look at two quotes
[3:41] both from 1965 where brother Bram says
[3:44] there is scripture coming to pass in
[3:47] 1965 and there's yet scripture to be
[3:49] fulfilled so let's start with April 2465
[3:53] proving his word brother baram said
[3:55] we're seeing it done it's fulfilling a
[3:57] scripture that has to come to pass
[3:59] brother talking about a message sweeping
[4:01] to bring the people out of
[4:03] denominational conditions back to the
[4:05] original gospel the Pentecostal Faith
[4:07] the scripture of course was Malachi 45
[4:10] and 6 turning the hearts of the people
[4:12] back to the fathers the apostolic
[4:14] fathers so notice here in April 1965
[4:18] brother Ram said it's fulfilling
[4:20] scripture and we're seeing it done so
[4:23] brother Ram said he was seeing
[4:24] scriptures fulfilled in April 1965 of
[4:27] course this is still happening last year
[4:29] I baptized I ized 17 former Amish
[4:32] believers who have left the Amish
[4:33] community and come to this glorious
[4:35] light of the message of the hour I'm
[4:37] seeing their hearts turned back to the
[4:39] original Apostolic Pentecostal Faith by
[4:41] the grace of God we're seeing it still
[4:43] today let's listen to the quote because
[4:45] immediately after that message the Earth
[4:47] is to be burnt with fire and the
[4:49] righteous walk out upon the ashes of the
[4:51] wicked so what never happened in the
[4:52] time of John we've got to have a message
[4:54] sweep back and bring the people out of
[4:57] all these denominational conditions back
[4:59] to the original genuine Pentecostal
[5:01] faith and we're seeing it done it's
[5:05] fulfilling of a scripture that has to
[5:07] come to pass all scriptures must be
[5:10] fulfilled how many more that we could
[5:12] apply it would take me longer in my time
[5:14] up now to show but you understand these
[5:16] things that has got to happen just
[5:18] exactly like this to Abraham's children
[5:21] just as he promised next is from August
[5:23] 15th 1965 knoweth it not brother Braham
[5:26] said as far as I know I don't see
[5:28] anything to hinder at this time the com
[5:29] of the Lord Jesus outside of the
[5:31] Readiness of his church so here he makes
[5:35] it seem like there's one thing left to
[5:36] be fulfilled the Readiness of the church
[5:39] remember this is just 4 months after he
[5:42] said he was seeing scripture come to
[5:44] pass the hearts turning back to the
[5:46] apostolic fathers and then this quote
[5:49] four months later says there is
[5:51] something hindering the coming of the
[5:52] lord it's the Readiness of the church
[5:54] let's listen to the quote let's think of
[5:56] the lady AA Church age and it's
[5:59] condition
[6:00] today as far as I know I don't see
[6:04] anything to
[6:06] hinder that this
[6:09] time uh the coming of the Lord Jesus
[6:12] outside of the Readiness of his
[6:15] church I want to share one more quote I
[6:18] love this quote from identification 1963
[6:21] it's January 23rd brother makes a very
[6:24] insightful wise quote by saying
[6:28] everything that's pertaining to prophecy
[6:31] about the second coming of the Lord
[6:32] could take place within an hour and he
[6:35] says this in numerous occasions but I
[6:37] like but I'd like to play this one here
[6:39] just like when Jesus died on the cross
[6:41] there were so many scriptures fulfilled
[6:42] there in just the three or 4 days of his
[6:45] arrest death burial and resurrection and
[6:48] so I love this quote because God can
[6:49] fulfill his word very quickly as well no
[6:52] man knows the day or the hour God will
[6:54] fulfill it just as he determined so
[6:56] let's listen to the quote from
[6:57] identification January 23rd 1963 it's
[7:01] been a great
[7:02] time I've been preaching
[7:05] these strong messages about his coming
[7:08] and trying to lay out the the
[7:11] possibilities and the hour that we're
[7:14] now living
[7:15] in and how that everything to my opinion
[7:20] my humble opinion is just in condition
[7:23] for the coming of the lord The Rapture
[7:26] the next
[7:28] thing and all all that lacks could
[7:31] happen within an
[7:33] hour I believe many I don't know just
[7:36] how many but several of the outstanding
[7:40] prophecies pertaining to the Fulfillment
[7:43] of the coming of the Messiah and what he
[7:46] would do was fulfilled in the last seven
[7:48] hours at the cross now let's look at
[7:51] five Bible verses I believe still need
[7:53] to be fulfilled let's start with
[7:55] Revelation
[7:56] 13: 16 brother R plainly said this is
[7:59] the boycott scriptures that need to be
[8:01] fulfilled let's read Revelation
[8:04] 13:16 and he causeth all both small and
[8:07] great rich and poor free and bond to
[8:09] receive a mark in their right hand or in
[8:10] their
[8:11] foreheads Revelation 13 is a chapter
[8:14] where we see two different versions of
[8:15] the Beast the Beast out of the sea which
[8:17] was Imperial Pagan Rome and then the
[8:19] Beast out of the land which is the
[8:21] United States so brother R uses
[8:23] Revelation 13:16 to say there is
[8:26] scripture left to be fulfilled he says
[8:28] this in spoken word is original seed
[8:30] March 18th 1962 brother BR was reading
[8:33] the pick up your pen and write portion
[8:35] he said I believe someday the real bride
[8:37] of Christ will be forced to stop
[8:38] preaching the word of God the Bible
[8:40] prophesies of it in Revelation 13:16 if
[8:43] you want to put it down so friends
[8:45] despite all the things that have
[8:46] happened over these years with Co and
[8:48] everything we as the Bride of Jesus
[8:50] Christ have never been stopped from
[8:51] preaching the word of God so that shows
[8:53] there's still a prophecy yet to be
[8:55] fulfilled let's listen to the quote I
[8:57] believe someday the real bride of
[9:01] Christ will
[9:05] be forced to St stop preaching the word
[9:09] of God the Bible prophesies of it in
[9:13] Revelations 13:16 if you want to put it
[9:15] down denominations will force it to stop
[9:19] or take its
[9:22] Mark then when the lamb will take his
[9:26] bride and judge the for this
[9:30] and then a few paragraphs after that
[9:32] brother Ram said this kind of church
[9:33] will be put out of operation as far as
[9:35] they know it's at that time that Jesus
[9:37] will appear and he'll show which is
[9:38] bride and which is not then he says all
[9:41] the words that's been written must be
[9:42] fulfilled Jesus said so so we've got
[9:44] things here in the scripture that must
[9:46] be fulfilled and that is one of the
[9:48] things this boycott to come so here's
[9:50] the quote that shows it most plainly
[9:52] there are scriptures yet to be fulfilled
[9:55] before the coming of the Lord so this
[9:57] quote stirred up my heart this week
[9:59] let's listen to the quote remember there
[10:02] will be such a denominational Gathering
[10:05] pretty soon it'll be
[10:08] terrific and they will bring themselves
[10:11] together into this Federation of
[10:15] churches and then this kind of a church
[10:19] will be put out of operation as far as
[10:21] they
[10:22] know it's at that time that Jesus will
[10:27] appear and he will show which is brother
[10:29] bride amen which is not and remember
[10:32] Christian friends I'm a man I can make
[10:37] mistakes but God being God cannot make a
[10:41] mistake all the words that's been
[10:43] written must be fulfilled Jesus said so
[10:47] so we've got things here in the
[10:49] scripture that must be fulfilled and
[10:52] that is one of the things this boyau to
[10:55] come but before this boycot can come of
[10:58] the marking of the
[10:59] there has to be a seed sold for God to
[11:02] take a church out of
[11:04] it you understand now second let's look
[11:08] at Matthew 24 4-8 I believe these are
[11:11] scriptures that still need to be
[11:12] fulfilled and this was quickly to me of
[11:14] course during the covid years of 2020
[11:18] 2021 Matthew 24:6 Jesus said ye shall
[11:21] hear of wars and rumors of wars see that
[11:24] you be not troubled for all these things
[11:26] must come to pass but the end is not yet
[11:28] for Nations should Rise Against nation
[11:30] and Kingdom against Kingdom and there
[11:31] should be famines and pestilences and
[11:33] earthquakes in diverse places all these
[11:36] are the beginning of
[11:38] Sorrows so Matthew 24:7 said pestilences
[11:42] that's what I believe the covid-19
[11:44] pandemic was it was a pestilence so that
[11:47] was a scripture that needed to be
[11:48] fulfilled and of course we have wars we
[11:50] have Israel against Hamas we have Russia
[11:53] and Ukraine so these scriptures are
[11:56] being fulfilled wars and rumors of wars
[11:58] all the these are the beginning of
[12:00] Sorrows so that's the second scripture
[12:02] that must be fulfilled the third
[12:04] scripture is Jeremiah 31:10 and there's
[12:06] many Old Testament verses like this God
[12:09] is still Gathering the faithful Jewish
[12:11] Remnant back to the Holy Land Jeremiah
[12:13] 31:10 says here the word of the Lord oh
[12:16] ye nations and declare it in the Isles
[12:17] of far in the aisles of far off and say
[12:20] he that scattereth Israel will gather
[12:23] him and keep him as a Shepherd doth his
[12:27] flock last time I looked it up the
[12:29] population of Israel was about 8 million
[12:32] but remember God only needs 144,000 of
[12:35] them to be virgins to the word of God
[12:37] that's what the Bible called them in
[12:38] Revelation
[12:40] 14:4 Israel was those which were not
[12:43] defiled with women for these are
[12:45] virgins Jesus will stand with them the
[12:48] 144,000 on Mount Zion according to
[12:50] Revelation
[12:53] 14:1 over the years I've seen numerous
[12:55] news articles from Christian news
[12:58] sources about Jews from Nations all over
[13:00] the world coming back to the Holy Land
[13:02] to live most recently I saw a video
[13:05] about Jews from Ethiopia returning to
[13:08] the Homeland so God's people Israel are
[13:11] still coming back to the Holy
[13:13] Land the fourth verse is 2 Peter chapter
[13:16] 3 verse 9 the Lord is not slack
[13:19] concerning his promise as some will as
[13:21] some men count slackness but as
[13:23] longsuffering to us word not willing
[13:24] that any should perish but that all
[13:26] should come to
[13:27] repentance so so this is a prophecy that
[13:30] God is bringing people to repentance as
[13:33] more time passes the longsuffering of
[13:36] God is allowing time to move on
[13:38] especially for the Gentile dispensation
[13:40] in order that Souls might be saved and
[13:43] again last year I saw at least 17 former
[13:46] Amish people be baptized get saved in
[13:48] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so
[13:50] this is fulfilling the prophecy of God's
[13:52] longsuffering to save the Gentiles and I
[13:55] think there's been an estimate there's
[13:56] over 300,000 Amish communities that have
[13:59] never heard the gospel the message of
[14:01] Jesus Christ so it seems like the gospel
[14:04] needs to go to them as well so they get
[14:05] a chance to hear it and then Fifth and
[14:08] finally there's numerous verses that
[14:09] kind of tie in with the fourth verse but
[14:12] Malachi 4:5 and6 says the hearts must be
[14:14] turned back to the Fathers as the quote
[14:16] from brother brandham said and we have
[14:18] Revelation 10 8-11 the finished mystery
[14:21] must be prophesied again around the
[14:23] world to the Gentiles this ties in with
[14:25] Luke
[14:27] 21:4 where Jesus said Jerusalem will be
[14:29] trotten down to the Gentiles until the
[14:31] times of the Gentiles be fulfilled so
[14:34] we're still in the time of the Gentiles
[14:35] we're still in the time of the Gentile
[14:36] Church ages where Gentiles are being
[14:38] saved then Matthew
[14:41] 2414 Jesus said this Gospel of the
[14:44] Kingdom shall be preached in all the
[14:45] world for a witness unto all nations and
[14:47] then shall the End come so again all
[14:50] these verses go together Revelation 10
[14:52] 8-1 John had to eat the book and
[14:55] prophesy again to every Kindred Nation
[14:57] people tongue and tribe and here Jesus
[14:59] says in Matthew 24:14 the Gospel must be
[15:02] preached into all the world so not every
[15:05] nation has had the gospel of the end
[15:08] time message preached to them there's
[15:10] many languages that still don't have the
[15:12] message in their language the first time
[15:14] I visit voice of God Recordings about 10
[15:17] years ago one of the workers said there
[15:19] were still numerous languages they need
[15:21] to translate brother Ram's books into so
[15:24] people of those languages can have a
[15:26] chance to hear the word of God the go
[15:29] Gospel of the Kingdom so these
[15:30] scriptures make me think the end cannot
[15:32] come until all these nations hear the
[15:35] preaching of brother brandham and of
[15:36] course those in the fful ministry who
[15:38] continue to preach the same thing
[15:40] brother brandham did the finished
[15:41] mystery of God in
[15:45] closing friends hope this video was a
[15:47] blessing by the grace of God I'm sure
[15:49] there's numerous other scriptures too
[15:50] that need to be fulfilled before the
[15:52] second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[15:54] but again remember these verses could
[15:56] all be fulfilled very quickly just like
[15:58] when Jesus came gave his life as the
[16:00] Lamb of God as a sacrifice so many
[16:02] verses were fulfilled in a very short
[16:04] time period so it always encourages us
[16:06] to watch and pray and be ready brother
[16:09] BR said preach like he's going to come
[16:10] in 10 years but live like he's coming
[16:12] today he said that in questions and
[16:14] answers on the seals 1963 lets usen to
[16:17] the quote should evangelists continue on
[16:20] the
[16:21] field in this hour of course what they
[16:24] mean certainly by all means don't change
[16:27] the thing amen if Jesus is coming in the
[16:30] morning Preach Today like if it going to
[16:32] be 10 years from today but live like
[16:34] it's going to be at this
[16:35] hour don't don't get scrupled up now
[16:38] that's what I'm trying to warn you about
[16:40] see just don't be odd peculiar don't
[16:43] change nothing but if you're doing
[16:45] something wrong or doing evil
[16:47] repent come back to God continue on your
[16:50] Evangelistic service just as you always
[16:53] did if you're building a house put it on
[16:55] up Jesus comes tomorrow you be found
[16:57] faithful as the duty if you're building
[16:59] your church go on put it up I'd rather
[17:01] be putting my money in something like
[17:02] that and be found within my pocket see
[17:04] so just just keep on continue as you are
[17:07] everybody understand now continue right
[17:09] on just go right on as you are so please
[17:13] reach out share any scriptures with me
[17:14] that you think need to be fulfilled
[17:16] perhaps I can make a part two on this
[17:18] video I believe it's so important to
[17:19] know that we're in the Fulfillment of
[17:21] scripture right now we're the wise
[17:23] virgin we've got our lamps trimmed we're
[17:25] going out to meet him there's another
[17:27] scripture we could put in there as being
[17:29] fulfilled right now of course Malachi 45
[17:32] and6 our hearts are being turned back to
[17:34] the apostolic fathers and Revelation
[17:36] 1316 is the verse I've shared with our
[17:38] church numerous times over the years
[17:41] that's the sign in my opinion my humble
[17:43] opinion that the Rapture will be on when
[17:45] the United States government starts
[17:47] shutting down the bride from preaching
[17:49] the word of God just as brother M taught
[17:51] and pick up your pen and write so let's
[17:53] be ready friends let's watch and pray
[17:55] Jesus will appear to all those that love
[17:57] is appearing as Paul Paul said not to me
[18:00] only but unto all them also that love is
[18:02] appearing in 2 Timothy
[18:05] 4:8 if you have any questions concerns
[18:07] or testimonies about this video please
[18:09] contact me God bless you and may Jesus
[18:12] Christ be the desire of your heart
