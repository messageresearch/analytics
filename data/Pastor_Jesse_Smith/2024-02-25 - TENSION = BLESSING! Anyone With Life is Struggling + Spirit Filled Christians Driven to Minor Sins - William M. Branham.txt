TRANSCRIPT
========================================
speaking of tension I was praying about this morning what would you do if you didn't have tension just think of it tension is part of living yeah that kind of encouraged me when I thought that if you had no tension you'd be like a rag doll you wouldn't have no feelings there'd be nothing you could work on like a husband and wife maybe if she wants to do something and they're trying to work together especially Christians and the other more and then when you come together to you find out what she's done she found out see the tension really brings you closer together amen and somebody tells you that well it said the let's think of the little wife it was a lot of tension when you wasn't so good or the little husband W some tension when you wasn't so good then when it's all forgiven look how you feel about it my you just see You' got to have tension that's all and just think of feelings what if you didn't have any feelings no pain or nothing was there be no pain at all you'd have no feelings at all see and if you'd have no feelings then one of your senses to be gone see so see everything's just right anyhow so God just give us Grace to stand up to it that's the thing just stand up that Grace and stand there and say we know that when this life is over the great ones on the other side where we're looking to go to and now we we remember that all these things that attention some people tries to introduce Christianity at you're free from war you're no you're not you're free from tension oh no you add tension when you become a that's right because you was kind of a flop go happy go lucky whatever it was out there not caring what you did but when you become a real Christian every moment you're wondering am I pleasing my Lord if I could hear from him it put your own tension put your on guard that's what makes you what you are so after all tension is a blessing just the way you're looking at it it's just the way you're looking at it see if you just look the other side there's another no matter how thin you slice anything you still got two sides through it so you want to see both sides so tension I think oh my it's what's this tension if I could been born without this tension well if I wouldn't had this tension I would have been what I am I wouldn't have been a Christian perhaps it was this tension that drove me to Jesus Christ see so it's been a blessing thing to me so then as Paul said as though when he had attention or something other consulted the Lord to take it away from him three times the Lord said all my all my grace is sufficient he said then all glory in my infirmity I'm weak I'm strong see long just to the will of God all right I consulted him one time when he used to bother me so bad it scared me and he told me about eight or 10 years ago he said he'll never scare you again and it never has did it worry about it I just feel it but I know it's there but I just go on cuz it don't scare me no more so thankful for that now he could said it won't be no more just as well as you won't be scared any more so it's his will that it happens so I just embrace it and say thank you Lord Lord I walk that way we want everything just everything uh so we can take it easy and retire and take life easy life wasn't intended to be easy life is a struggle anything that's got life is a struggling look at the trees how they struggle look at everything that's got life it's a struggle and when we try to get some kind of a system that takes it easy then we're wrong and we know there's something wrong I listen today of our our television and and programs and our papers and all these things that's going on and everybody's telling a joke trying to get America's built up a bunch of laughter and some kind of a joke like Ernie Ford and all those television stars and to make all our movies is so corrupt it's this could not be anymore corrupt that's all it puts me in the mind of a little boy going through a graveyard whistling trying to make himself think he's not afraid but that's the reason he's whistling see he's afraid and that's whater you're trying the world today's time to laugh it off America is a joke and know that our numbers up she's weighed in balance and found warning if God Almighty doesn't tear this nation to Pieces he'll be he'll be obligated to Sodom and gomor to raise her up and apologize for burning her up right we are doomed the whole world's Doom she's falling apart and there's no way of saving it she's done send away her day of Grace is it possible for a holy ghost filled person to be driven by the driven by the to do minor things influenced to do M minor things that he doesn't want to do oh yes yes sir yeah Holy Ghost filled person you're right in a place then to be to be drove by these things you just put yourself up a Target when you're down there serving the devil he just lets you slot around any you want to but you want take a stand for Christ you've got on the other side then he trains every gun right around on you every Temptation everything it can be thrown to you then you got it but what have you got greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world see now he wasn't in no battle here you just slopping along see but now you you cleaned up you've dressed up you saved you combed your hair you put on a uniform you got a gun in your hand let's go see you're in battle not to show off but to fight fight sure when The Temptations rise with the spirit The Shield of Faith Buck it off and move on see that's right oh put on the whole armor of God why you put on Armor if you're not going to fight all soldiers are dressed to fight not to show off walk and say I'm so and so now I'm a Christian you see who I am I belong to so and so Hallelujah I got the Holy Ghost the other night sure nothing bothers me anymore uhuh brother I believe you better go back and try again see well I'm telling you when you soon as you say you got the Holy Ghost Satan's got every gun right on you shooting then you got the whole armor on then take the shield of Faith the sword of the spirit of the word and take the Buckle along the Sha yourself with the gospel and take the old uh middle piece or the breastplate and pull up the Cinch on it and tighten yourself up a little bit and get ready boy cuz it's a coming don't you worry yes sir you're going to have plenty of trouble but remember greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world
