[36:24] again
[36:27] [Music]
[36:37] heavenly father lord you set the wind in
[36:41] motion
[36:42] in the beginning and the wind continues
[36:46] today
[36:48] it does never cease to obey the lord
[36:51] when you walk upon the earth in a
[36:53] natural body when you spoke
[36:57] the wind recognized that voice
[37:02] it humbled itself and it stopped and
[37:04] seized peace be still
[37:06] and it was stupid god i pray that you'd
[37:10] speak to our hearts today
[37:12] lord that your word would come to a
[37:14] heart sin
[37:16] that which is not at peace will be at
[37:18] peace
[37:20] lord every trial every challenge of the
[37:23] devil is laid before us
[37:25] god i pray that as we just get shut in
[37:28] here just for a few moments today
[37:31] but you'll speak lord have your way may
[37:34] we have no contention no difference
[37:37] but one focus one purpose
[37:40] that's on your word lord have your way
[37:44] do as you will in jesus christ's name
[37:50] amen praise the lord god bless you
[37:53] brother
[37:56] praise the lord it's good to be with you
[37:57] today
[38:00] and uh i always enjoy this kind of uh
[38:03] thought
[38:05] you know as we're together today we want
[38:07] to just like when you pull up to the
[38:09] table with family you just sort of pull
[38:11] up to the table and kind of get
[38:13] comfortable
[38:13] and it's time to eat i feel like that's
[38:15] what church services should be like that
[38:18] we should just be comfortable
[38:19] kind of let everything shake everything
[38:21] off
[38:22] we want to invite the lord to come and
[38:24] have his way amen
[38:27] let's turn if you would to um first
[38:29] corinthians the fifth chapter
[38:37] trying to get my things organized here
[38:41] there's corinthians the fifth chapter
[38:58] so
[39:03] when we want to read just a couple
[39:05] verses here verses six
[39:07] to eight
[39:10] first corinthians chapter five
[39:14] verses number six to eight
[39:17] your glorying is not good
[39:21] know you not that a little leaven
[39:23] leaveneth the whole lump
[39:26] purge out there for the old leaven that
[39:28] you may be a new lump
[39:30] as you are unleavened for even christ
[39:33] our passover is sacrificed for us
[39:36] therefore let us keep the feast not with
[39:39] old leaven
[39:40] neither with the leaven of malice and
[39:43] wickedness
[39:44] but with the unleavened bread of
[39:46] sincerity
[39:48] and truth may the lord bless the word
[39:50] you may have your seeds
[39:52] praise the lord
[39:57] this is uh we're gonna start here in
[39:59] first corinthians and just take maybe a
[40:00] little
[40:02] a little bible study if you will and and
[40:04] just see where the lord leads us today
[40:06] um this is something that's that's
[40:08] really being on my heart this kind of
[40:09] the thought has been on my heart
[40:11] as we go through the message we find
[40:13] that brother branham talks about this
[40:14] often
[40:15] about how all the little differences
[40:17] kind of get in among us and we could say
[40:19] it could be in
[40:20] could be in marriage it could be in the
[40:22] fellowship uh it could be in any
[40:25] could be between fellowships but what
[40:27] brother branham was talking about many
[40:29] times is how
[40:31] those things hinder the word of god
[40:32] hinder the moving of of god
[40:34] so we're going to take for a little
[40:35] subject this morning without
[40:38] leaven without leaven
[40:41] we're going to start here as we just did
[40:43] in first corinthians the fifth chapter
[40:46] and as we see the scriptures saying this
[40:48] is paul of course speaking to the
[40:49] corinthians
[40:50] um your glory is not good
[40:55] no you're not that a little leaven
[40:57] loving it the whole lump
[41:00] so a lot of times you know we as
[41:01] christians we we feel like you know
[41:04] i'm a pretty good christian right i come
[41:07] to church on sunday
[41:09] i do the right things i try to i try to
[41:12] do good
[41:13] but you know a friend in everything that
[41:15] we do when we compare ourselves to what
[41:17] god has done
[41:18] when what jesus christ walking up on
[41:20] this earth being a perfect example of
[41:21] what we should be
[41:22] when we compare ourselves to that
[41:24] perfect example the stature of truly
[41:27] a perfect man you know
[41:30] there is no way in ourselves if we look
[41:32] at ourselves without the blood of jesus
[41:34] christ there's no way that we can
[41:35] compare ourselves
[41:36] to god himself and say yeah we stack up
[41:39] pretty good
[41:41] and it's funny how we as a person as a
[41:43] human being sometimes we look in the
[41:44] mirror and we say you know
[41:46] you're pretty good but the funny thing
[41:49] is
[41:50] the only way to do that is by comparing
[41:52] ourselves one to another
[41:54] and then we compare you know i'm not
[41:55] what i used to be so praise the lord you
[41:57] know i've arrived
[41:58] but what god is trying to express to us
[42:01] is until
[42:02] the work is done and when the work is
[42:04] done means we're no longer here in this
[42:06] earth right
[42:07] god's doing a work we come to the end of
[42:09] that road and god translates the body
[42:11] the trumpet sounds and we leave until
[42:14] that time
[42:15] until that moment god is doing a work
[42:18] god is doing a work in us he's doing the
[42:20] work between us
[42:21] and he's pulling the body together as
[42:22] brother ben has said the gathering place
[42:24] is in jesus christ it's not in the four
[42:27] walls of a building
[42:28] it's not a particular assembly it's not
[42:30] a particular part of the world
[42:33] it's in jesus christ it's in truth it's
[42:35] in a
[42:36] genuine spirit that as we come together
[42:38] we begin to fellowship
[42:40] what is gathering us together what's
[42:41] pulling us together is it politics
[42:44] is it is it we get together and say you
[42:45] know we got this scripture we got the
[42:47] scripture
[42:48] you know brother what do you think about
[42:49] this what do you think about this that's
[42:50] not what does it
[42:51] see that's what man has done to try to
[42:53] put together the ideas
[42:56] and understand what what did god mean by
[42:58] this and what did god mean by that
[43:00] but as we pursue god and we fall in love
[43:03] with jesus christ from the depths of our
[43:05] heart
[43:06] genuinely not because we show up you
[43:08] know on sunday
[43:09] and everything looks right we act right
[43:12] that's not it
[43:14] friends i've seen people uh you know
[43:16] it's heartbreaking but i've seen people
[43:18] come to church
[43:18] faithfully for 20 years or 30 years
[43:22] and die in sin well
[43:26] brother doesn't that you know is that
[43:27] such a wonderful testimony it is
[43:29] and you know what that 30 years if they
[43:31] served the lord for 30 years
[43:33] that was the that was the power of the
[43:35] lord jesus christ that was doing
[43:37] something good in them
[43:39] but the bible says it's not he that runs
[43:41] the race it's he that endures to the end
[43:44] now what is the end of that person how
[43:46] are they judged i don't know
[43:47] god god tells us don't do that but what
[43:49] we can do
[43:50] is we can hold up the word and we can
[43:52] say that life or my
[43:54] life does not line up with this this is
[43:57] my standard it's not my neighbor
[43:59] it's not my brother it's not my sister
[44:00] it's not my husband it's not my wife
[44:02] it's not my sons it's not my daughters
[44:04] it's not my parents that's not the
[44:05] standard
[44:06] the standard is this this is the
[44:08] standard
[44:10] and as we measure ourselves to this we
[44:12] find that over oh
[44:13] you know the years go by and we've got
[44:15] all the things that are going on in the
[44:16] world and
[44:17] you know we get troubled by this and we
[44:18] get troubled by that
[44:20] but you know if we're so lost in in the
[44:22] lord jesus
[44:24] nothing is a surprise this is not a
[44:26] surprise what's going on in the world
[44:28] nothing is and if we have confidence
[44:31] that god knew from the beginning
[44:33] what the end was going to be that we
[44:36] know that god is not surprised
[44:38] god didn't wake up one morning and say
[44:40] oh i'm shocked that
[44:42] the world has gone into sin god
[44:45] knew before everything began how things
[44:47] would play out
[44:49] this time in 2020 how everything in the
[44:51] world
[44:52] the the politics are going crazy the the
[44:55] pandemics in the world they got
[44:57] politicized and all this kind of
[44:58] nonsense
[44:59] who cares who cares about what the world
[45:03] wants we want only one thing that's
[45:06] jesus christ
[45:07] and friend that message for us hasn't
[45:09] changed
[45:10] right as we look at god's word we look
[45:12] at everything that's going on and we
[45:14] compare it wow this is
[45:15] this is going on but didn't there wasn't
[45:18] there a voice that told us things are
[45:20] going to get worse
[45:22] isn't there a voice that told us you
[45:23] know what it's going to get so bad
[45:26] it's going to drive the bride together
[45:31] you know it's not a surprise nothing's a
[45:34] surprise
[45:34] so here we are today looking for god god
[45:37] what's next
[45:38] what's the next thing for me lord i'm
[45:39] growing i praise you lord for the
[45:41] victory that's been in my life but what
[45:43] now
[45:44] lord how can i grow from the place that
[45:46] i'm at now
[45:47] i want to be closer to you tomorrow
[45:50] than i was today lord what do i do
[45:55] well just just trust the lord and do
[45:57] nothing but you know the interesting
[45:59] thing is
[46:00] we do trust the lord we wait on god but
[46:03] when
[46:03] god came to abraham and told abraham
[46:06] abraham you're going to have a son
[46:08] oh praise the lord amen and then god
[46:10] came to abraham he said go off of your
[46:12] son
[46:13] god your son isaac what did abraham do
[46:16] you know did abraham just sit there and
[46:17] say well you know praise the lord
[46:20] hallelujah praise the lord i'm a
[46:22] christian god loves me god's given me a
[46:24] promise
[46:25] and i'm just going to sit here at home
[46:29] no abraham had a job to do
[46:32] you know what i said the bible says that
[46:34] abraham got things ready
[46:36] he had the wood cut he had everything he
[46:39] needed he had help
[46:41] he had everything he needed he got up
[46:43] early in the morning because god had
[46:45] told him to do something
[46:46] he got up early in the morning and he
[46:48] was in his place
[46:50] and he left this place why did he leave
[46:52] because god told him to do something
[46:55] he moved because god had placed
[46:57] something in his heart and abraham had
[46:59] faith that something good was going to
[47:01] come out of this
[47:02] that god's work was going to be done
[47:04] god's will was going to be done no
[47:05] matter what it looked like
[47:08] and by that faith abraham was justified
[47:13] paul said so he said abraham was
[47:16] justified by the faith that he had in
[47:18] offering isaac
[47:19] because that which he thought well if i
[47:22] do this this is gonna
[47:23] this is gonna harm the promise god gave
[47:25] me the promise and then he gave him
[47:26] the sun and this seems like it's a
[47:28] contradiction
[47:30] i don't know how this is gonna work out
[47:32] for the good abraham didn't question it
[47:36] he got up in the morning he said i gotta
[47:38] go
[47:39] packs everything up and he goes you know
[47:41] when he he gets close to where he's
[47:42] gonna
[47:43] offer his son can you imagine he's gonna
[47:45] offer his son isaac
[47:46] and he gets to this place and he tells
[47:49] all the men that were with him he said
[47:50] stay here stay here
[47:54] i need to go offer a sacrifice and the
[47:57] lad and i shall return
[48:00] how did abraham know they were going to
[48:01] return god hadn't explained all the
[48:04] details to him
[48:05] but abraham began to move based on
[48:08] faith because god told him and he just
[48:11] did it
[48:12] he didn't understand it all he didn't
[48:14] know the end of it he just began to move
[48:17] and as it began to move by the promise
[48:19] he began to move by the instruction
[48:21] god worked out the rest but god's grace
[48:25] that's where we want to be at we want
[48:27] god to be so much in control
[48:29] and that we trust god so much that when
[48:31] we come up to the edge of death
[48:33] there's no question amen
[48:36] you know right right now as of this
[48:38] morning i was about seven o'clock this
[48:40] morning there is a
[48:41] sister in our assembly that's her and
[48:43] her husband had faithfully been coming
[48:44] to church for many years
[48:47] she's been suffering with parkinson's
[48:49] it's been in a lot of discomfort pain
[48:51] she's
[48:51] first it started with with um she lost
[48:54] her balance and she was very shaky and
[48:57] she couldn't stand anymore she can
[48:58] barely walk she can't take care of
[49:00] herself
[49:01] and then just a couple days ago she
[49:02] started bleeding they believe it was an
[49:04] ulcer
[49:05] she was bleeding out of her mouth she
[49:07] was bleeding out they took her to toledo
[49:08] this was just a couple days ago i
[49:10] believe on wednesday
[49:11] thursday night they said there's nothing
[49:12] we can do
[49:14] and there's nothing we could do for for
[49:16] this woman uh we suggest that you just
[49:18] pull the plug take the iv out and just
[49:20] let her go quickly so i there was
[49:23] nothing
[49:24] nothing to do she's been suffering
[49:25] horribly so uh
[49:27] they made that decision we're not going
[49:29] to do anything if god chooses to
[49:30] intervene that's god what god would
[49:32] choose to do
[49:33] but we're not going to medically try to
[49:34] extend this out because she's miserable
[49:36] she's suffering
[49:39] on thursday night they unplugged
[49:41] everything she's bleeding they expect at
[49:43] any time
[49:44] she might choke to death she might
[49:45] anything could happen it seems
[49:48] and she's been suffering for a long time
[49:50] so she goes through the night
[49:52] she's bleeding from her mouth her face
[49:54] is swollen this is a thursday
[49:56] this week she's bleeding her face is
[49:59] swollen
[50:00] and her husband is so so bothered by
[50:02] what by
[50:03] being there and being with her and
[50:04] watching his wife suffer he steps out in
[50:06] the hallway begins to pray
[50:08] he said something to the effect of lord
[50:11] he was just struggling with the the
[50:13] difficulty of the situation he said lord
[50:15] you're still able you're still dog you
[50:18] can do anything that you choose
[50:20] and by that that day progressed she
[50:24] had continued to bleed then the bleeding
[50:26] stopped
[50:27] they'd unplugged all ivs and everything
[50:29] they're not doing anything to help her
[50:30] there's no
[50:31] maybe morphine i'm not sure but nothing
[50:34] to help her situation to get better
[50:38] she's bleeding out in toledo
[50:41] uh she lives they live in a norwalk area
[50:43] and they had gone to toledo to the
[50:44] hospital there
[50:47] the doctor they come in on i believe it
[50:48] was on would have been yesterday
[50:51] they come in and they said uh well she
[50:54] was bleeding but she's not bleeding
[50:55] anymore
[50:58] her situation is now stabilized
[51:01] and her husband was there with her and
[51:03] uh
[51:04] realized that she didn't have an iv and
[51:06] he put some water on her lips and she
[51:08] licked her lips she they thought she was
[51:10] incoherent she was gone past the point
[51:11] of return
[51:13] put some water on her lips she licked
[51:15] her lips and she said you want water and
[51:17] i asked her she said water
[51:19] she's she's incoherent they're not doing
[51:20] anything for her she says water so they
[51:22] give her water
[51:23] this is in the last two days so they
[51:26] give her water and then finally
[51:28] she continues to get stronger so they
[51:29] said well actually we weren't going to
[51:31] do surgery there is a surgery that can
[51:32] be done
[51:33] but uh you know it wasn't we couldn't do
[51:35] it at the time she would probably die on
[51:36] the operating table
[51:38] and now uh she's actually strong enough
[51:40] now we're going to send her to the
[51:41] cleveland clinic here in cleveland
[51:42] and we we think we can do the surgery so
[51:44] they sent her the life flighted her to
[51:46] cleveland
[51:47] this is as of this morning about 7 am
[51:49] and she's there now in cleveland and
[51:51] they said when she got there as far as i
[51:52] know
[51:53] that the bleeding has stopped completely
[51:54] they don't need to do surgery
[51:56] amen god whatever happens tomorrow
[52:00] what if god chooses to take her home
[52:02] tomorrow
[52:04] does that change what happened no it
[52:07] doesn't
[52:08] even the doctor came in they said you
[52:10] know i'm a doctor but there's a doctor
[52:11] greater than i
[52:12] and you know i i i'm going to assume
[52:15] we're all aware at this point it takes
[52:16] quite a lot for a doctor anymore to say
[52:18] such a thing
[52:19] a lot of doctors that don't have enough
[52:20] humility to acknowledge that they're not
[52:22] the greatest authority in the medical
[52:24] field
[52:24] that there's one that's set this body in
[52:26] order and that same god is the one the
[52:28] only one
[52:29] that can truly heal
[52:32] so we're praying for that trusting in
[52:34] the lord and everything
[52:36] but i want to i share that testimony and
[52:38] talk about abraham for this reason
[52:41] when we're in a situation where we don't
[52:43] know what the outcome is
[52:46] we want god to just lay it out we know
[52:48] every detail
[52:49] but faith is
[52:52] confidence is knowing the unseen
[52:57] when we don't know what's going to
[52:59] happen next and we have
[53:01] faith we have confidence in god and that
[53:04] confidence
[53:04] is telling us what's going to happen
[53:06] next though we have no evidence of it
[53:10] the only evidence that's been provided
[53:12] is god's word itself
[53:14] and you know a lot of times we're
[53:15] praying for some big thing
[53:18] well god i'm praying about this i need a
[53:20] vindication
[53:22] but paul explains to us paul explains
[53:25] that when we can see it
[53:29] when we can see evidence it's not faith
[53:34] faith is in the unseen
[53:38] and if we have confidence in god's word
[53:40] when we see nothing
[53:42] that's faith abraham began to move
[53:46] by faith he had no thing in front of him
[53:50] telling him
[53:51] abraham this is going to be easy
[53:54] he didn't have anything telling him that
[53:57] he
[53:58] believed that god's promise was going to
[54:00] see his son through
[54:02] was going to see him through and he
[54:03] moved on he didn't understand every
[54:05] detail
[54:07] that's faith many times we pray for
[54:10] things and
[54:10] and first of all a lot of times we we
[54:12] feel in the heart well lord i've prayed
[54:14] and i've prayed and i've prayed and
[54:15] nothing's happened
[54:16] and you know i've experienced this
[54:18] myself
[54:20] a lot of times we go back and carefully
[54:22] consider the things that we believe
[54:23] we've prayed about we prayed about
[54:25] you know what we we didn't ask a lot of
[54:28] times friends
[54:29] we didn't even ask god for anything all
[54:32] we did was whine and complain about it
[54:35] is that true or not true a lot of times
[54:38] we go to prayer we're praying oh god i
[54:40] got this and oh i got this sake and i
[54:42] got this and i got this
[54:44] bible says you have not because you
[54:46] asked them
[54:48] you have not because you ask them this
[54:50] well lord i really need a million
[54:51] dollars
[54:53] son or daughter you don't need a million
[54:54] dollars what you need is faith in god's
[54:57] word god could create money just like
[54:59] that
[54:59] if that's what he chose god can do
[55:02] anything he so
[55:03] chooses but what he's looking for in his
[55:05] children is
[55:06] confidence it's faith that no matter
[55:08] what my eyes tell me
[55:10] no matter what my ears tell me no matter
[55:12] what the sequence of events that i'm
[55:14] looking at is telling me
[55:16] god is able that's the baseline
[55:20] that's the foundation that everything is
[55:22] built upon
[55:24] and all of god's children the born into
[55:26] the family of god by what
[55:28] by birth not by signing the book not by
[55:30] joining the church
[55:31] not by attending a certain assembly
[55:34] jesus said
[55:35] unless you be born again you will in no
[55:37] wise
[55:38] see the kingdom of god it won't happen
[55:41] there's no alternative there's no way
[55:43] around
[55:43] it but having confidence in god's word
[55:46] stepping out in god's word and as we see
[55:48] you know
[55:49] all the things are going on with the
[55:50] election all this you know and
[55:53] you know the democrats really hate the
[55:56] christians and this and you know looks
[55:58] like maybe he's going to be present
[55:59] maybe it's not who knows what's going to
[56:01] happen day to day
[56:02] who knows exactly right and who cares
[56:06] the outcome is already set for them
[56:10] and for god's children
[56:13] by god's grace paul said it this way
[56:15] saint paul said it this way
[56:17] don't be shaken in your mind don't be
[56:20] swayed by any wind of doctrine
[56:22] now a lot of times we don't think about
[56:23] satan as having a doctrine
[56:25] but satan has a doctrine satan wants you
[56:28] to believe his doctrine as he presents
[56:30] it to you
[56:31] he wants you to believe you see this
[56:33] force
[56:34] you see this political force it's so
[56:36] powerful
[56:37] there's nothing you could do there's no
[56:40] way
[56:41] you can escape the power of everything
[56:44] that's going on in the world
[56:46] sure you can sure you can
[56:49] not only not only can we have confidence
[56:52] in god's word he said never leave us nor
[56:54] forsake us but the bible tells us
[56:56] that the time will come where god will
[56:58] pluck out his children
[57:00] in the midst of all of the chaos god
[57:03] will pluck out his children
[57:04] amen and the devil wants you to tell
[57:07] wants to tell you
[57:08] oh there's just no way there is just no
[57:10] way
[57:11] that you could ever overcome
[57:15] all the things that are going on in the
[57:16] world oh it's so big
[57:18] america what are you doing america for
[57:20] god 60 years ago 70 years ago or
[57:22] whatever it was
[57:25] what we're seeing is the outcome i heard
[57:28] a man say this i believe it was wisdom
[57:30] he said a person without god can and
[57:33] will
[57:34] believe anything unless god
[57:37] gets a hold of a person's mind well
[57:40] brother we're talking about
[57:41] faith isn't faith you know it's faith in
[57:44] the soul
[57:45] that's what makes a difference that's
[57:46] exactly right it does make the
[57:47] difference and you know the bible
[57:49] also says though you shall be
[57:52] transformed by the renewing
[57:54] of your mind that god will change your
[57:57] thoughts
[57:57] the very things you think the things you
[58:00] see you can look at the same situation
[58:02] completely different though i walk
[58:04] through the valley of the shadow
[58:06] of death i will fear no evil praise the
[58:09] lord
[58:09] amen
[58:16] without leaven well brother what
[58:19] what what does this have to do without
[58:21] leaving
[58:23] because god wants us to be so in tune
[58:25] with him that there's nothing between us
[58:27] paul said i'm not flailing at the air he
[58:30] said i strive
[58:30] daily but there'd be nothing between god
[58:32] and me and
[58:34] me and and other men other other people
[58:38] there's nothing there's no leaven
[58:40] there's nothing to separate us
[58:41] what does leaven do leaven adds air
[58:45] it adds fluff we don't need fluff
[58:48] all we need is confidence we need a rock
[58:51] solid
[58:52] foundation to stand upon
[58:58] let's go to if we would
[59:04] proverbs 22
[59:13] praise the lord
[59:22] appreciate that water up there brother
[59:38] praise the lord you know friends i don't
[59:41] know what all's coming next but i'm sure
[59:43] excited to see it
[59:44] if god will have us to be here wonderful
[59:47] things are in store it's a good time to
[59:48] be a christian
[59:49] amen here we are
[59:52] in proverbs 22. let's read verse
[59:58] 22. verse number 10.
[1:00:06] 22 and verse number 10 cast out the
[1:00:08] scorner
[1:00:09] and the contention shall go out yay
[1:00:13] strife and reproach shall cease
[1:00:19] let's also turn if you would to proverbs
[1:00:26] 13.
[1:00:28] we'll try to slow down here just a
[1:00:29] little bit and focus on these scriptures
[1:00:31] here if we can
[1:00:32] by god's grace
[1:00:35] proverbs 13 also
[1:00:42] proverbs 13 and 10.
[1:00:46] only by pride
[1:00:49] cometh contention but what the well
[1:00:52] advised
[1:00:53] is wisdom only by pride
[1:00:56] cometh contention so what is the only
[1:01:00] way
[1:01:01] that contention can come
[1:01:05] the only way says right here
[1:01:08] only by pride
[1:01:12] cometh contention
[1:01:16] you know a lot of times in i would i
[1:01:19] grew up in
[1:01:20] in church in a message church
[1:01:24] and i've seen so much bickering and
[1:01:27] fighting and
[1:01:28] someone could say well brother why would
[1:01:31] you say that about your assembly you
[1:01:32] think it's unique to one assembly
[1:01:34] it's not if you understand the working
[1:01:37] by god's grace understand the workings
[1:01:39] of
[1:01:39] this world anytime a human is involved
[1:01:43] anytime that that natural part of us is
[1:01:45] involved what do we get
[1:01:47] contention get a little bit lifted up
[1:01:52] you know one of the biggest things that
[1:01:55] christians will get prideful about is
[1:01:58] the size of their trials
[1:02:01] trials oh brother let me tell you about
[1:02:04] my trials
[1:02:06] oh i got this trial then oh
[1:02:09] i got this trial and speak for an hour
[1:02:12] about trials oh god is good
[1:02:14] praise the lord that's my testimony the
[1:02:16] testimony
[1:02:18] that's an hour talking about problems
[1:02:20] lifting up how
[1:02:21] how the tragedy of someone's life and
[1:02:23] then say well to god be the glory
[1:02:27] what did god do that's the testimony
[1:02:31] well i got this problem i got this
[1:02:32] problem and woe is me i got this
[1:02:36] friends i have a lot of empathy if you
[1:02:39] will
[1:02:40] a lot of empathy i i really i feel very
[1:02:43] strongly for people that are going
[1:02:44] through difficult
[1:02:45] situations but if that that person is a
[1:02:48] child of god
[1:02:50] how can we have sympathy how can we
[1:02:53] sympathize on a child of god
[1:02:55] knowing that the end that will come out
[1:02:57] the thing that will come out
[1:02:59] is god's perfection
[1:03:02] we feel bad we feel for this we feel for
[1:03:05] that
[1:03:06] and friends many times our feelings
[1:03:08] feeling bad for one another
[1:03:10] we think is god moving us
[1:03:14] and it clouds our judgment we'll get to
[1:03:17] that in a moment but i want to highlight
[1:03:19] how does this contention set in how is
[1:03:23] it
[1:03:23] that contention begins to build and
[1:03:25] before you know it you can't speak to a
[1:03:27] brother you can't speak to a sister
[1:03:29] and as brother bano says so many times
[1:03:31] you should be able to shake hands with
[1:03:33] one or
[1:03:33] disagree shake hands and feel no
[1:03:35] differently
[1:03:38] friends if we're not in that kind of
[1:03:40] state if we're not in the place where we
[1:03:42] have
[1:03:42] patience a reverence toward what god is
[1:03:45] doing in each other's lives
[1:03:46] friends we don't need to agree on
[1:03:48] everything it's not in this life
[1:03:50] friend there is we are not going to
[1:03:53] agree on every little detail
[1:03:55] brother i don't like the color of your
[1:03:57] shirt brother
[1:03:58] i believe you got to wear a white shirt
[1:04:00] behind the pulpit you know what friends
[1:04:01] i would never want to stumble anybody
[1:04:03] but if somebody has a conviction about
[1:04:05] that praise the lord
[1:04:06] then live that conviction but we get
[1:04:08] convicted about something i don't mean
[1:04:10] to call out one thing
[1:04:11] if you know somebody that feels that way
[1:04:13] i'm not trying to set a mark against a
[1:04:15] person or anything like that
[1:04:16] i want to use an example that's visible
[1:04:18] it's open i got a blue shirt on today
[1:04:20] and someone might look on that and i say
[1:04:22] well brother i believe you should only
[1:04:23] wear a white shirt
[1:04:26] i don't have anything against that if
[1:04:27] someone has a conviction about what
[1:04:28] praise the lord wear white shirt you
[1:04:30] know if i have more white shirts i wear
[1:04:31] more
[1:04:32] white shirts white shirts are very hard
[1:04:34] to keep clean i don't know if
[1:04:37] it's a lot of work trying to keep a
[1:04:38] white shirt clean
[1:04:41] but my point there friend is that
[1:04:46] we take something that to
[1:04:49] that is not from directly from god's
[1:04:52] word
[1:04:54] we make a law and if someone else
[1:04:57] doesn't obey
[1:04:58] our law then we unchristianize them
[1:05:03] that makes sense and brother brahm said
[1:05:05] don't unchristianize your brother
[1:05:07] don't unchristianize your sister pray
[1:05:10] for them strive for them
[1:05:11] encourage them you can disagree brother
[1:05:15] sister you know i don't
[1:05:17] i don't agree with this i don't i don't
[1:05:19] love you any less
[1:05:20] but but i disagree and if we can't have
[1:05:24] that kind of conversation
[1:05:26] and this is a challenge to everyone
[1:05:28] myself included but if someone disagrees
[1:05:30] we immediately we start to rise up and
[1:05:33] in that
[1:05:34] where does that come from
[1:05:37] contention we start to do this
[1:05:40] right we start to butt heads a little
[1:05:42] bit why
[1:05:44] only by pride cometh contention
[1:05:49] only only only
[1:05:53] only well brother
[1:05:56] there's times when things need to be
[1:05:58] said absolutely right
[1:06:00] and we'll get to that in just a moment
[1:06:03] see sometimes we feel like
[1:06:05] we go the other extreme
[1:06:08] well brother you know i don't want to
[1:06:09] cause contention and i disagree but i
[1:06:11] don't want to say anything
[1:06:12] i don't want to you know i don't want to
[1:06:14] offend someone so i'm just going to say
[1:06:16] nothing
[1:06:18] what does the bible say to do you see
[1:06:22] the bible we believe many times we
[1:06:26] believe the bible's good enough
[1:06:28] until it's really uncomfortable
[1:06:32] and then we don't really want to follow
[1:06:34] every word
[1:06:35] that proceeds from the mouth of god the
[1:06:38] bible says speak
[1:06:40] the truth in love
[1:06:43] but what does that mean well brother it
[1:06:46] just really needs to be said
[1:06:47] i really needed to tell that person did
[1:06:50] you know
[1:06:53] what was the outcome well you know
[1:06:56] we kind of argued about it a little bit
[1:06:58] oh contention
[1:07:00] really friends i have seen this so
[1:07:04] many times contention after contention
[1:07:08] after contention
[1:07:11] you know what it takes by god's grace
[1:07:14] to resolve it taking all of your pride
[1:07:19] put it in a ball and throw it in the
[1:07:21] corner
[1:07:24] god can have you fall on your face he
[1:07:26] can have you be humiliated whatever
[1:07:28] it takes and i've heard i've heard this
[1:07:30] said before and forgive me i don't mean
[1:07:31] to disagree with anybody
[1:07:34] case in point no me to disagree with
[1:07:36] anybody but friend
[1:07:38] i pray with my whole heart lord lord
[1:07:42] whatever it takes and i've heard people
[1:07:45] say this is what i was alluding to
[1:07:46] i've heard better people say well be
[1:07:48] careful what you pray for you know
[1:07:49] that's a hard thing
[1:07:51] why should i be careful i trust him
[1:07:54] i trust god entirely with
[1:07:57] everything i am it's the only safe place
[1:08:01] i can eat it's the only safe place
[1:08:05] where my children can be where my home
[1:08:07] can be unless
[1:08:09] are in the hands of god they're not in a
[1:08:11] safe place
[1:08:12] i will mess it up in myself if i'm not
[1:08:16] continuously saying lord
[1:08:18] help me give me more humility give me
[1:08:20] more temperance lord i need to submit
[1:08:21] myself i'm i'm getting a little bit
[1:08:23] snippy about this i'm getting a little
[1:08:24] snippy about this
[1:08:25] what is it contention comes from what
[1:08:29] pride
[1:08:32] and by god's grace the lord can weed
[1:08:34] those things out and friends the process
[1:08:36] might be painful
[1:08:39] it might be so hard that you feel like
[1:08:41] you're going to lose your mind and let
[1:08:43] me tell your friends
[1:08:44] as your your brother in christ jesus as
[1:08:47] you get down the road
[1:08:48] and you submit yourself to the lord
[1:08:50] there's going to be times where it's
[1:08:52] hard
[1:08:52] but if you submit yourself to the lord
[1:08:55] god knows exactly what he's doing
[1:08:58] he knows how to weed out of us the
[1:09:01] things
[1:09:01] that are holding on the things that are
[1:09:04] preventing us from growing
[1:09:06] god knows exactly the recipe
[1:09:10] that we need
[1:09:13] oh brother i just don't know
[1:09:16] i don't know if i can do that
[1:09:19] then let's go back to abraham what did
[1:09:22] abraham do god asked him what to
[1:09:24] what any human being would say would be
[1:09:25] a ridiculous thing
[1:09:27] go offer your son
[1:09:31] you realize that in doing so he was
[1:09:33] being a type of god
[1:09:34] himself he offered his son
[1:09:38] he did what no man thought was
[1:09:41] thinkable and here was a natural man
[1:09:45] a natural man who was not filled with
[1:09:48] the holy ghost
[1:09:50] under the blood of boozy goats here's
[1:09:52] abraham
[1:09:54] offering his sacrifice jesus christ had
[1:09:57] not come
[1:09:58] died for his sins had removed all sin
[1:10:01] there was still a gulf between god and
[1:10:02] man
[1:10:03] and here's abraham walking in with the
[1:10:06] creator
[1:10:08] my what a man
[1:10:12] to this day the three major religions
[1:10:16] in the world can all be traced back to
[1:10:18] abraham
[1:10:20] and what did abraham do
[1:10:23] he offered his son the thing that was
[1:10:27] most precious to him
[1:10:29] he offered it he said lord it's yours
[1:10:33] do with it as you will
[1:10:36] my son came by your promise you'll
[1:10:39] preserve the promise
[1:10:41] and i trust you for it
[1:10:44] for me friend this this theme of
[1:10:46] trusting god has been very
[1:10:48] personal to us i say us myself my wife
[1:10:51] my family
[1:10:52] as the lord has challenged us in many
[1:10:54] ways maybe there's a testimony for
[1:10:55] another time but
[1:10:57] when i stand here and say this friends
[1:10:58] this is not
[1:11:00] i don't say this because it sounds good
[1:11:02] i say it because it is to me the only
[1:11:04] way
[1:11:05] to survive this life
[1:11:08] and friend when i say survive i don't
[1:11:10] mean just survive as in we're
[1:11:12] just barely making it through what i
[1:11:13] mean is that if you come
[1:11:15] that way god will give you victory and
[1:11:17] it's the only way to victory
[1:11:19] and god will shelter you he will care
[1:11:21] for you even though you
[1:11:22] feel like everything is not going the
[1:11:24] way you want it to
[1:11:26] god will take care of it and we'll have
[1:11:28] it come out for the good
[1:11:33] here we are
[1:11:37] only by pride cometh contention
[1:11:42] so many times friends this is this is
[1:11:44] got in the way of
[1:11:45] for all of us everyone without exception
[1:11:48] for everyone this gets in the way of us
[1:11:51] growing with the lord
[1:11:53] growing up into the stature of a perfect
[1:11:54] man we're talking about faith
[1:11:56] but we have to add to our faith virtue
[1:12:01] add to our virtue knowledge continue to
[1:12:04] grow
[1:12:06] and this is uh brother brandon explain
[1:12:07] it like this
[1:12:09] virtue is strength you have faith
[1:12:12] and then you grow in your faith you're
[1:12:14] adding strength and then we come to
[1:12:16] knowledge sometimes people say well then
[1:12:18] it means that you have to learn a lot
[1:12:20] about the scripture you have to learn a
[1:12:21] lot about the message you got to
[1:12:22] memorize
[1:12:23] a whole bunch of scriptures no that's
[1:12:25] not that's not it that's not what the
[1:12:26] knowledge is about
[1:12:28] the knowledge faith is the unseen like
[1:12:32] we were talking about earlier
[1:12:33] faith is the unseen but when it is seen
[1:12:36] it's now knowledge i know it
[1:12:40] it's no longer faith i know it
[1:12:43] that's knowledge add to your faith
[1:12:46] virtue
[1:12:47] and add to your virtue knowledge
[1:12:51] i am now a witness let me tell you what
[1:12:53] god has done
[1:12:55] it's not because we're filled up with
[1:12:57] knowledge filled up with reasoning and
[1:12:59] trying to figure out
[1:13:00] oh brother branham said this and if i
[1:13:02] put this piece together and put this
[1:13:04] piece together
[1:13:04] oh friends i'm not downplaying how
[1:13:06] wonderful it is when god begins to
[1:13:08] quicken the word
[1:13:09] and the pieces begin to come together
[1:13:11] and it's so beautiful by divine
[1:13:13] intervention god begins to get our
[1:13:15] attention and bring the things of the
[1:13:17] message together
[1:13:18] and what do we see christ jesus
[1:13:22] the book of revelation what is many
[1:13:24] times
[1:13:26] uh many times you read in most bibles it
[1:13:28] will say the revelation of john
[1:13:32] let me just bring this to your attention
[1:13:34] you haven't noticed this before
[1:13:36] you don't have to turn there i'll just
[1:13:38] read the
[1:13:41] it's an easy way to remember this what
[1:13:43] is the book of revelation about
[1:13:45] revelation 1
[1:13:47] the revelation of jesus
[1:13:51] christ
[1:13:54] which god gave unto him who john
[1:13:58] gave it to john what's the book of right
[1:14:00] what are all these mysteries about
[1:14:02] and and you know i believe in
[1:14:07] i believe i'm being honest friends i
[1:14:09] mean truly
[1:14:10] i mean the things that we get
[1:14:11] embarrassed about the things that i
[1:14:13] bring that up a lot
[1:14:14] because a lot of times we come up to
[1:14:15] this line oh i get embarrassed i can't
[1:14:17] no i can't talk about that but
[1:14:20] when god is glorified who cares about
[1:14:23] what i feel like
[1:14:24] who cares about what everybody else
[1:14:25] feels like we want god to be glorified
[1:14:27] now we're not trying to shame one
[1:14:28] another and
[1:14:29] forgive me i don't want it to sound that
[1:14:30] way but i wanted to bring up this little
[1:14:32] testimony of this
[1:14:33] this is still going on but this
[1:14:37] man recently is going through a very
[1:14:39] difficult situation
[1:14:43] he said to another brother he said
[1:14:48] now there's no one that knows as much as
[1:14:50] i do about the message
[1:14:56] well we just diagnose what the problem
[1:14:57] is right
[1:15:00] there's only one that has that sort of
[1:15:02] character now that brother
[1:15:04] might be in all other ways perfect i
[1:15:07] don't know but there's only one
[1:15:11] that would glorify themselves only one
[1:15:14] only one nature is not god
[1:15:19] it's not god even jesus said i come to
[1:15:20] glorify the father
[1:15:23] him being the very expression of the
[1:15:24] father hear him setting an example for
[1:15:27] us
[1:15:27] i come to glorify the father not myself
[1:15:31] and any time if someone begins to
[1:15:32] glorify themselves
[1:15:34] i had a i'm sure i shared the testimony
[1:15:37] here before but
[1:15:39] when my my son benjamin was three and a
[1:15:41] half months old
[1:15:42] he was in the hospital and we had almost
[1:15:44] lost him a couple times and
[1:15:46] we come out of the hospital and this man
[1:15:48] came to me and he said
[1:15:49] he said it to like said it to me like
[1:15:51] this you know
[1:15:53] i prayed he said it like he kind of
[1:15:57] dropped something you know
[1:15:58] important i prayed
[1:16:01] what he was alluding to was that because
[1:16:03] he prayed my son was saved
[1:16:07] what character is that that's not god
[1:16:11] the bible says in all thy ways
[1:16:14] acknowledge him who
[1:16:17] jesus christ and any time
[1:16:21] someone is pulling a promotion to
[1:16:24] themselves
[1:16:25] that's not god it's very easy to see
[1:16:28] it's very easy to hear oh friends and
[1:16:31] sometimes we get so uncomfortable with
[1:16:33] it
[1:16:33] maybe someone's is he's speaking and
[1:16:35] every sentence is i
[1:16:37] i i i i i
[1:16:40] i i it's all about i
[1:16:44] and at the end of it praise the lord god
[1:16:46] is good that wasn't a testimony
[1:16:49] that was revelation of some person that
[1:16:52] was a lifting up of some person
[1:16:55] let's move along without living
[1:16:59] i'm going to read a little bit here
[1:17:02] let's go to ephesians 4 first
[1:17:13] praise the lord god is so good
[1:17:17] friends ephesians 4.
[1:17:30] we read this well not read this but
[1:17:33] mention this earlier we're just going to
[1:17:36] read verses 15 and 16
[1:17:39] but we want to bring some balance of
[1:17:41] this we want to make sure it doesn't
[1:17:43] you know friend i don't want anyone
[1:17:44] walking away from here today saying
[1:17:47] you know brother nathaniel just said you
[1:17:49] know you should never
[1:17:50] uh you should never say anything that
[1:17:52] would offend anybody that's not what i'm
[1:17:53] saying
[1:17:55] brother nathaniel said you should always
[1:17:57] just speak the speak what you believe is
[1:17:59] truth
[1:18:00] now hold on now everything in balance
[1:18:03] as paul said let all things be done
[1:18:05] decently and in order
[1:18:07] so let's read what the purpose here is
[1:18:11] ephesians 5 15 and 16
[1:18:14] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:18:17] up
[1:18:18] into him in all things
[1:18:21] which is the head even christ let's
[1:18:23] let's pause for a moment
[1:18:24] and break that down a little bit but
[1:18:27] speaking the truth in love
[1:18:29] may grow up into him in all things
[1:18:33] what is the purpose for speaking in love
[1:18:37] what is the purpose what is god getting
[1:18:41] what says it right here we don't have to
[1:18:42] guess
[1:18:46] jesus lost my place there for a moment
[1:18:49] but speaking
[1:18:50] the truth in love may grow up into him
[1:18:54] in all things which is the head even
[1:18:57] christ
[1:18:58] from whom the whole body is fitly joined
[1:19:02] and compacted by that which every
[1:19:05] joint supply to the effectual workings
[1:19:10] in the measure of every part maketh
[1:19:13] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:19:16] of itself
[1:19:17] in love what is the purpose
[1:19:22] that the body will minister to the body
[1:19:26] how can the eye say to the hand i have
[1:19:28] no need of thee
[1:19:30] how can this part of the body say to the
[1:19:31] other part of the body yeah i don't need
[1:19:33] you
[1:19:34] i can do whatever i want when paul also
[1:19:37] said of the the saints from the old
[1:19:38] testament he said they
[1:19:39] they couldn't receive the promise
[1:19:41] because it wasn't time yet but
[1:19:43] they without us are not complete the
[1:19:46] body
[1:19:47] is only complete by the whole body
[1:19:51] not because one person feels they're so
[1:19:53] spiritual
[1:19:54] i can do everything i am everything
[1:19:56] there is only one that was everything
[1:19:59] only one and that one who is everything
[1:20:03] we were in him we were in
[1:20:06] him when he died on the cross if we
[1:20:09] identify
[1:20:10] with the death then we identify with the
[1:20:12] resurrection
[1:20:13] we being in christ jesus
[1:20:16] he is lifted up you know the thing is
[1:20:19] friends when we submit ourselves to the
[1:20:22] lord a lot of times people
[1:20:23] feel like oh that's weak i need to fight
[1:20:26] i need to rise up i need to fight i need
[1:20:28] to charge against the wrong
[1:20:31] oh this person's in false doctrine i
[1:20:33] need to straighten them out
[1:20:34] we can't change another person not none
[1:20:37] of us can change another person
[1:20:39] there is only one god himself
[1:20:43] but you know what he does he says now my
[1:20:45] son my daughter
[1:20:46] consecrate yourself submit yourself to
[1:20:49] my word
[1:20:49] and when i anoint your lips you will
[1:20:52] speak
[1:20:54] and things will change
[1:20:57] who gets the glory only one
[1:21:01] jesus christ well brother it came from
[1:21:04] my lips but it wasn't you
[1:21:07] i'll prove it to you a story i believe
[1:21:11] most of us would be familiar with
[1:21:13] brother branham
[1:21:14] in the woods speaks of squirrels into
[1:21:17] existence
[1:21:18] i'm sure everyone remembers this story
[1:21:20] very well known
[1:21:23] you may have noticed or maybe not but
[1:21:25] i'll point bring it to your attention
[1:21:28] when brother bannon was up on the
[1:21:29] mountain he uh he got lost
[1:21:32] the storm came in and he got lost
[1:21:35] there was a voice that came and spoke to
[1:21:37] him
[1:21:39] he said the voice that spoke to brother
[1:21:41] branham said this
[1:21:44] it is i who created the squirrels
[1:21:48] in your presence
[1:21:52] it is i who created the squirrels
[1:21:55] in your presence well
[1:21:58] brother branham was so what was this or
[1:22:01] was that
[1:22:02] but who gets the glory one
[1:22:06] who is the book of revelation about one
[1:22:10] who is the entire bible about one
[1:22:14] that's jesus christ no one else
[1:22:18] can get the glory for anything
[1:22:21] and any time contention comes in
[1:22:25] it's because pride is working
[1:22:29] and it's beginning to bring in leaven
[1:22:31] it's bringing in fluff it's bringing in
[1:22:32] air it's bringing in something that
[1:22:35] shouldn't be there and as we
[1:22:38] we can see very simply by the scripture
[1:22:40] well there's contention you know maybe
[1:22:42] it's because of this maybe it's because
[1:22:43] of that very simple
[1:22:44] why is it no because there's pride
[1:22:49] and what i've seen so many times friend
[1:22:52] i could be a witness of this
[1:22:55] that as we
[1:22:58] as we submit ourselves to the lord
[1:23:01] trust him with everything that we have
[1:23:06] we begin to humble ourselves to his will
[1:23:10] as we do that god will put you through a
[1:23:12] trial oh
[1:23:13] lord it's hard this is very hard
[1:23:17] right you're learning patience
[1:23:22] you're learning that tribulation work
[1:23:23] with patience
[1:23:26] but let it have its good work submit
[1:23:29] yourself
[1:23:30] lord i just don't know how i'm going to
[1:23:31] come through this just trust
[1:23:34] the lord and as you come through it
[1:23:38] because you will the end
[1:23:41] of solomon said the end of a thing is
[1:23:42] better than the beginning of the thing
[1:23:45] across everything the end is better than
[1:23:47] beginning
[1:23:48] why because god is doing something god
[1:23:50] is bringing out
[1:23:51] what his will is and as we submit
[1:23:54] ourselves to that we humble ourselves
[1:23:56] god takes us to trial after trial and
[1:23:58] brings a pandemic
[1:23:59] why is there pandemic because there's
[1:24:01] things that need to happen
[1:24:03] why is all this stuff going on in
[1:24:04] politics because things need to happen
[1:24:07] the world needs to descend the world
[1:24:09] needs to be destroyed
[1:24:11] in its current condition and the only
[1:24:14] way
[1:24:15] that it is going to be so is if the
[1:24:17] people are
[1:24:18] calling for destruction the people are
[1:24:21] calling
[1:24:21] oh i hate this person i hate this person
[1:24:24] i want to destroy them i want to destroy
[1:24:26] them
[1:24:26] and the world hates everything
[1:24:30] oh except for that one very important
[1:24:33] individual right
[1:24:36] me this is what everyone says
[1:24:39] everyone is wrong except for me
[1:24:44] i don't i'm not saying that today
[1:24:47] i hope it doesn't sound that way
[1:24:51] this is what people say in the world
[1:24:54] it's all about
[1:24:55] that person you hurt my feelings you did
[1:24:59] this you did this
[1:25:00] oh oh woe is me
[1:25:03] and god says when we're in the middle of
[1:25:05] a trial
[1:25:07] son daughter
[1:25:10] gird yourself and stand up that's what
[1:25:13] he said to job
[1:25:15] he said come here we need to have a
[1:25:16] conversation
[1:25:18] he had a very fatherly conversation with
[1:25:21] joel
[1:25:23] but let me point out something else
[1:25:26] job was such a special character
[1:25:29] that even the devil had to testify about
[1:25:33] job
[1:25:35] the devil had to say well you have a
[1:25:38] hedge around job
[1:25:40] he's testifying that god was doing
[1:25:42] something
[1:25:43] in the life of job that he was not able
[1:25:46] to touch
[1:25:48] in the midst of everything here is
[1:25:50] lucifer wanting to get at
[1:25:52] job and god says come on go get him and
[1:25:55] lucifer says i can
[1:25:57] i can't because you placed a hedge
[1:26:00] around him isn't that wonderful
[1:26:05] the devil can only go as far as god
[1:26:09] permits and no further in in uh
[1:26:12] in revelation it's talking about in the
[1:26:15] the opening of the series is talking
[1:26:16] about goals so far
[1:26:17] but touch not the oil and the wine in
[1:26:20] the midst of the throne a voice comes
[1:26:23] out
[1:26:23] in the midst of the four beasts what is
[1:26:25] it the throne of god says you can go
[1:26:27] this far but their mind
[1:26:30] don't go past this and the devil wants
[1:26:34] to go all the way
[1:26:35] he wants to destroy the root he wants to
[1:26:37] destroy
[1:26:38] all that god has done and god says no
[1:26:40] you can go this far
[1:26:42] and the devil will whine and complain
[1:26:44] and he'll come and talk to people
[1:26:46] and he'll say yeah but i can do what i
[1:26:48] want i can do what i want i can do what
[1:26:49] i want and there comes a voice from the
[1:26:51] throne
[1:26:52] you can only go this far and he says
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:26:56] well i gotta do what he says i don't
[1:26:59] like it but i have to do what he says
[1:27:06] my friends
[1:27:10] it seems like a simple thing oh brother
[1:27:13] you know we need to have less pride and
[1:27:15] you know maybe we need a bicker a little
[1:27:17] bit less
[1:27:18] oh it's so much more than that friend so
[1:27:21] much more than that
[1:27:25] give me give me just a moment here
[1:27:28] brother we don't have another another
[1:27:29] adapter for this do we
[1:27:32] that's the only one we have okay that's
[1:27:34] no problem no problem
[1:27:36] we'll just leave it online i'll just
[1:27:37] read it to you i got a couple quotes
[1:27:39] here that let's sort of tie things
[1:27:40] together
[1:27:44] praise the lord everyone doing all right
[1:27:47] praise the lord
[1:27:49] you know i love any moment when we get
[1:27:51] to go after the devil
[1:27:52] you know it feels like maybe for a
[1:27:54] season it feels like you're running from
[1:27:56] the devil and trying to
[1:27:57] just trying to make it and trying to get
[1:27:59] through this or get through that but you
[1:28:00] know when it comes down to it friend
[1:28:02] the children of god do not have to be
[1:28:05] concerned about anything the devil has
[1:28:07] the only thing we need to do is focus on
[1:28:09] god's word
[1:28:10] focus on what god what god would have
[1:28:12] for us to do take one step at a time and
[1:28:15] trust god for the rest
[1:28:16] oh it seems so simple oh how could it
[1:28:19] oh brother we need something grander we
[1:28:21] need something grander
[1:28:23] but there isn't any to trust god's word
[1:28:26] entirely in the from the bottom of our
[1:28:30] feet to the top of our head
[1:28:31] from the depths of our soul to every
[1:28:33] part of our being
[1:28:34] trust god trust god trust god and what
[1:28:37] happens
[1:28:38] we get smaller he increases we get
[1:28:41] smaller
[1:28:42] he increases and as we submit himself to
[1:28:44] the lord suddenly there comes a moment
[1:28:46] where someone's dying
[1:28:47] someone's sick you go over and you speak
[1:28:49] something you you give them a hug you do
[1:28:51] something small thing
[1:28:53] then that person says what just happened
[1:28:56] something happened in me i was sick but
[1:28:59] i'm not sick anymore
[1:29:02] well i didn't do anything you didn't
[1:29:04] except submit yourself to the lord
[1:29:07] and god begins to use the vessel
[1:29:10] we use sickness because it's simple but
[1:29:12] friend sickness is not everything
[1:29:15] we get caught up in sickness and and uh
[1:29:18] and uh financial things because they
[1:29:20] they affect us in very visual open ways
[1:29:23] but god is concerned about the eternal
[1:29:25] destination
[1:29:26] of that soul and if it takes a sickness
[1:29:29] if it takes a financial destruction
[1:29:32] god will do whatever it takes to humble
[1:29:35] a person
[1:29:38] oh but brother you know lord i just
[1:29:39] don't know just
[1:29:41] trust him amen whatever
[1:29:44] it takes it's worth it
[1:29:48] because he is the righteous god
[1:29:54] i'm gonna read uh it's a little bit
[1:29:56] lengthy here
[1:29:57] it's a little easier when it's up on the
[1:29:59] screen but we'll just
[1:30:03] we'll just uh read through it here this
[1:30:07] is from
[1:30:08] all of the uh this whole excerpt here is
[1:30:10] from
[1:30:12] god's only provided place of worship in
[1:30:14] 1965.
[1:30:17] brother iran was kind of laying out the
[1:30:19] time
[1:30:20] that we're living in but also
[1:30:23] what god's purpose is what god what god
[1:30:25] is wanting to bring us to
[1:30:28] by god's grace you'll see how this fits
[1:30:29] together
[1:30:32] the lutherans under justification defeat
[1:30:36] raised it like that wesley under
[1:30:38] sanctification
[1:30:39] the pentecostals under the arms and the
[1:30:41] works and deeds and so forth
[1:30:44] had to be calvinist or had to be
[1:30:45] armenian had to be legalists but now we
[1:30:48] come to the head the capstone
[1:30:50] grace grace the capstone crime
[1:30:53] the headstone crying what grace grace
[1:30:56] pass from death
[1:30:57] and creed into a living word of the
[1:30:59] living god
[1:31:00] god's only provided plan for his age his
[1:31:03] sons
[1:31:04] in the word age quickened by the spirit
[1:31:06] like a spark that's off of something to
[1:31:08] make it alive
[1:31:09] and seated now in heavenly places
[1:31:12] in present tense already alive and
[1:31:15] subject to every promise
[1:31:17] in the word then what does he do
[1:31:21] you being part of god's gene a part of
[1:31:24] the word
[1:31:26] other men a part of god's word seeding
[1:31:28] seated together
[1:31:31] manifest the entire body of christ
[1:31:34] because there's no leaven among you
[1:31:40] no leaven among you just the word
[1:31:44] seated in heavenly places in the door
[1:31:47] where he puts his name
[1:31:49] christ jesus no leaven
[1:31:52] among you that brings the entire
[1:31:55] fullness
[1:31:56] of the godhead bodily among you
[1:32:02] hold on just a minute you mean to tell
[1:32:05] me
[1:32:06] that when there's no leaven in the body
[1:32:09] that brings the fullness of the godhead
[1:32:13] bottle
[1:32:17] how significant is that to us
[1:32:20] well brother it's just a little
[1:32:21] difference it's just you know it's a
[1:32:23] little thing it's just a little tiff
[1:32:24] it's just a little bickering
[1:32:27] no leaven none
[1:32:31] no leaven nothing between one
[1:32:34] and another it doesn't mean we don't
[1:32:37] disagree
[1:32:39] well brother how can we how can we
[1:32:41] disagree but have nothing between us
[1:32:43] because what what god is speaking about
[1:32:45] what brother branham is speaking about
[1:32:46] here
[1:32:47] is a spiritual thing there is a
[1:32:50] spiritual thing where one will rise up
[1:32:52] against another
[1:32:53] and as soon as that happens it's not
[1:32:56] unity
[1:32:57] it's leaven it is
[1:33:00] this nature getting injected
[1:33:04] into the body
[1:33:08] and when there is no leaven there is
[1:33:11] nothing extra
[1:33:12] it's only god's word god
[1:33:15] steps right into that
[1:33:20] praise the lord
[1:33:23] no leaven among you that brings the
[1:33:25] entire
[1:33:26] fullness of the godhead bodily among you
[1:33:30] couldn't do it in luther's age couldn't
[1:33:33] do it
[1:33:34] in wesley zane
[1:33:37] couldn't do it in the pentecostal age
[1:33:41] but in the day when the son of man will
[1:33:43] be manifested revealed
[1:33:45] brought back the church together with
[1:33:48] the entire
[1:33:49] deity of god amongst his people showing
[1:33:51] the same visible signs
[1:33:53] manifesting himself like he did at the
[1:33:55] beginning when he was manifested on
[1:33:57] earth in the form
[1:33:58] of a prophet god o glory promised by
[1:34:01] malachi 4 promised by the rest of the
[1:34:03] scriptures
[1:34:04] where do you worship at the house of god
[1:34:07] seated in present tense
[1:34:11] heavenly places in christ jesus not
[1:34:13] future tense
[1:34:15] present now god
[1:34:18] calling us to be sitting in heavenly
[1:34:21] places the world is falling apart
[1:34:23] yes it is satan's eden yes it is
[1:34:27] but we don't have to be subject to that
[1:34:31] no leaven one with another speaking the
[1:34:35] truth in love
[1:34:36] if sin comes in speaking the truth in
[1:34:38] love but not to rise up one against
[1:34:40] another
[1:34:41] not to get puffed up in oneself and say
[1:34:44] you know i'm really gonna show this
[1:34:45] person
[1:34:46] or i'm going to get one over on someone
[1:34:50] you know brothers a lot of times we as
[1:34:52] men especially will get caught up in
[1:34:53] this
[1:34:54] in the conflict of you know i do this a
[1:34:56] little bit better we do that a little
[1:34:58] bit better
[1:35:00] brothers this is something that has to
[1:35:02] die to us
[1:35:03] has to die in us
[1:35:06] no challenge one to another speaking the
[1:35:10] truth
[1:35:11] standing on the truth but not trying to
[1:35:13] lift up one
[1:35:14] over another god is no respecter of
[1:35:17] persons it clearly says this in the
[1:35:18] scripture
[1:35:19] god has no respect for persons talk
[1:35:21] about someone who comes in dressed
[1:35:23] nicely
[1:35:24] and then there's a poor person that
[1:35:26] comes in maybe a beggar from the street
[1:35:28] uh they come in and we would treat the
[1:35:30] person that has a wealth or they're
[1:35:32] dressed nicely better than the person
[1:35:33] that has nothing
[1:35:36] and paul said don't do that how do you
[1:35:39] know
[1:35:40] what this soul is see we're judging with
[1:35:43] our eyes
[1:35:44] we're lifting up one or the other with
[1:35:45] our eyes we're we're making some
[1:35:47] judgment
[1:35:48] and in that friends there's nothing good
[1:35:50] to come from
[1:35:53] you know i pray friends that even a
[1:35:55] little time that we've had today
[1:35:57] to spend together i pray that's been
[1:35:59] encouraging to you
[1:36:02] because this little thing
[1:36:05] if you will consistently weighs upon my
[1:36:09] heart
[1:36:10] that we have no leaven i don't want
[1:36:13] leaven between myself and my wife
[1:36:16] and it requires being humble i have to
[1:36:19] go to my wife and say honey i was wrong
[1:36:21] i did this wrong i've been doing things
[1:36:23] wrong for years
[1:36:25] we we do this and we do that and i i've
[1:36:28] done things and you know i may have even
[1:36:30] shared this before but it was a
[1:36:31] kind of an awareness in my life we were
[1:36:33] driving one time
[1:36:35] and i've shared this many times but it
[1:36:37] it i really
[1:36:39] it brings me a lot of a chuckle at it
[1:36:41] now and i laugh at it now but
[1:36:43] it was really a waking moment in my life
[1:36:47] i'm driving down the road talking and
[1:36:50] when i talk i get carried away if you
[1:36:51] haven't noticed
[1:36:52] i i just i talk and i really get tired
[1:36:55] of hearing now i get tired of hearing
[1:36:57] myself talk
[1:36:58] but when i was younger i would just talk
[1:37:00] talk
[1:37:02] so i'm we're driving the road my wife
[1:37:04] and i have been married that long and
[1:37:07] i'm talking as usual you know our
[1:37:10] conversations are basically one long
[1:37:12] monologue
[1:37:13] of me talking to my wife i'm learning
[1:37:16] though i'm learning
[1:37:19] so i'm talking and my wife is very good
[1:37:22] with directions he has a very good
[1:37:23] memory so we're driving and
[1:37:26] uh i i frequently will miss a turn
[1:37:28] because i'm talking i get distracted
[1:37:30] so i'm about to miss a turn and uh
[1:37:33] sister charity
[1:37:34] said you know um this is your turn right
[1:37:36] here
[1:37:38] and to this day it pricks my heart but i
[1:37:40] snapped at her and i said i know
[1:37:44] little thing right what caused that
[1:37:49] was that because i was right not at all
[1:37:53] even if i was it still wasn't a good
[1:37:54] attitude
[1:37:56] but that moment stopped me and in that
[1:37:59] moment
[1:38:00] god just allowed me to see was like
[1:38:01] looking from a third person i heard
[1:38:03] myself say this
[1:38:04] i looked at the situation and i said
[1:38:07] how ridiculous
[1:38:11] god gave me and help me to help me where
[1:38:14] i am weak
[1:38:15] and here i am rebuking her for doing her
[1:38:19] part
[1:38:22] oh it seems simple but when we see
[1:38:25] ourselves in that light
[1:38:26] we see ourselves in the way it's just
[1:38:29] the simple things of everyday life
[1:38:31] friend
[1:38:33] a lot of times we apply the message to
[1:38:35] all these big things
[1:38:36] god wants to be in the little details
[1:38:40] the little ways that we conduct
[1:38:41] ourselves because when it's
[1:38:43] genuine from the bottom of your heart
[1:38:46] it'll be in the details it'll be in
[1:38:49] every minute
[1:38:50] every day that lesson continued
[1:38:53] i share it now because it was such a
[1:38:55] pivotal thing to me god just brought it
[1:38:57] to my attention
[1:38:58] how silly am i
[1:39:01] oh i know no i didn't know i didn't know
[1:39:04] i missed it
[1:39:05] and my wife's trying to help me and here
[1:39:07] i am snapping at her like that
[1:39:10] you know so many times we do things such
[1:39:13] as that
[1:39:15] and it's those things that god wants to
[1:39:16] get our attention he says see
[1:39:18] you've done this your entire life but
[1:39:20] it's time to grow up
[1:39:23] amen paul said when i was a child
[1:39:26] i acted as a child but when i became a
[1:39:28] man i put away childish things
[1:39:31] and sometimes we do things you know it's
[1:39:34] just kind of
[1:39:35] i pray that the lord makes it simple for
[1:39:36] you something you can apply to your life
[1:39:39] because this is so important if we
[1:39:42] and i feel like i just keep repeating
[1:39:44] myself a little bit here and forgive me
[1:39:46] if i seem to be doing that but i want to
[1:39:48] just press that point
