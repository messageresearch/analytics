Description:
Part 4 of this series teaches on the "WHERE" and "WHY" of the rapture mystery. For the "WHERE", true believers must only be in one spiritual location - not a physical location - in order to be in the rapture - they must be "in Christ" according to Romans 8:1. Concerning the "WHY" of the rapture, Jesus wants to rapture His wife or bride off the earth to help her escape the oncoming judgments of the great tribulation period. Jesus promised to keep true believers from the world-wide hour of temptation that is to come upon the earth. He also promised to save us from the wrath to come.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
where will the rapture take place at the rapture will be a universal event meaning it will take place on a global scale and believers will not have to be in one physical location in order to be a part of the rapture Holy Ghost filled believers might be working at the time of the rapture or sleeping in their beds according to Jesus's teaching in the following scriptures Luke 17 34 I tell you in that night there should be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left Matthew 24:40 through 42 then shall two be in the field the one should be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding at the mill the one should be taken and the other left watch therefore for you know not what hour your Lord doth come it will not matter where the true believer is physically located if they have the oil or the wedding garment of the baptism of the Holy Ghost they will be ready for the rapture and Jesus will call them to the air to meet the rest of the saints in the sky the only location a Christian must be concerned about for the rapture is their spiritual location a true Christian must be located in Christ according to Romans 8 verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit believers are in Christ when Christ is in them by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Colossians 1:27 to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory Galatians 3:27 for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ acts 1:5 for John truly baptized with water but he shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence Romans 8:11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal these by his spirit that dwelleth in you Jesus foretold his disciples about his desire to dwell in them by his spirit john 14 17 even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you then a few scriptures later Jesus revealed a most glorious truth about those he would dwell in he revealed that those believers were already in him in his mind and plan before the foundation of the world John 14 twenty day he shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you Ephesians 1:4 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love praise God for the revelation of where we need to be for the rapture we must be in Christ meaning that Christ is in us our souls by the baptism of the Holy Ghost why will the rapture occur the rapture will occur because Jesus Christ desires to take his Gentile bride to their wedding in the sky and then to their wedding supper in heaven first Thessalonians 4:17 then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord Matthew 25 10 and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut revelation 19 verse 9 and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God according to John 14 verses one through three Christ desires to be married with his eternal companion the many membered bride of Jesus Christ Christ wants to receive his people his bride unto himself and take her to the place he has prepared for them to live eternally the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride John 14:1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also as pilgrims and strangers on this earth the Holy Ghost fill bride shares the same desire as her husband and wants to leave this world and ever be with the Lord Christ desires to rescue his wife from the Great Tribulation Period that is coming upon the earth to judge and torment the unbelievers jesus said I will also keep thee from the hour temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth Romans 5 verse 9 says much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him [Music]
