Description:
This is Part 2 of a three-part series sharing the testimony of Message believer, Austin Laramee. In this installment, the Lord Jesus rescues Austin from chronic drug abuse and multiple suicide attempts, bringing him to genuine repentance. This is reminiscent of God sparing Brother Branham's life when he tried to end his life prematurely. 

At the end of the episode you'll again hear Brother Austin sing a song the Lord gave him about being saved out of his hopeless life, titled Right Where I'm Supposed to Be.

WARNING: We recommend that children do not listen to this episode due to the mature topics mentioned, such as drug abuse and suicide.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
through my sickness darkness jesus you got me through my addiction depression [Music] i am grateful that you thought of me and if right where i am is right where you are then i'm right where i'm supposed to be god bless you and welcome to defending the message podcast we trust you are doing well by the grace of god i'm your co-host pastor jesse smith and here's our other co-host i'm amen today we're recording part two of austin laramie's testimony so hope you enjoyed part one before we get into the bulk of the podcast i again want to give a warning that this episode has a lot of mature content in it we do not recommend children listen to it god has rescued our brother austin from a life wholly given over to drug abuse so in this podcast you'll hear different drugs mentioned such as marijuana or weed xanax meth fentanyl and beer or alcohol our brother also got into reading a lester crowley and studied the occult he got a lot of tattoos and tried to commit suicide on numerous occasions of course as a church we do not support any drug abuse tattoos violence or any involvement with the occult but we again felt it was an important part of austin's testimony as god's hand reached down and rescued him from himself we felt certain details from his testimony might help those trapped in drug abuse it might give hope to those in drug abuse or give hope to the families who have loved ones in drug abuse and encourage them to keep praying for the deliverance of their loved ones whether they're battling drug abuse the occult or suicide as i was listening to austin's testimony i had remembered how brother branham had tried to commit suicide on a couple occasions and i saw a parallel between brother austin and brother branham's life in the sense that god saved both of their lives of course they were in different positions when they battled suicidal thoughts but in both cases god was gracious and saved them from themselves so i will insert brother bram's quotes in specific places right after austin talks about his battles with suicidal thoughts i'll also play another brother branham quote where he talked about having knife fights as brother austin had a knife fight as part of his testimony when he was almost at his breaking point and in this brother branham quote he talked about how he wanted to go shoot four or five boys that were beating him up when he was around the age of 12 and yet god spared him from being a murderer so we're sharing these testimonies from brother branham and brother austin to magnify the grace of our lord jesus christ who is mighty to save who saves to the utmost and who is rich in mercy we also hope you'll listen all the way to the end and you'll hear austin sing a song about this particular aspect of his testimony the lord gave him a song called right where i'm supposed to be and in the song austin talks about overcoming depression and suicidal thoughts and the song magnifies the grace of our lord jesus christ to rescue him save his soul and lead him into paths of righteousness for god's name's sake you heard a small portion of this song at the beginning of the podcast as well and with that we'll get started so brother last time we ended with the story of how your friend named benjamin was really gracious to you and you were homeless at the time and he started talking to you about god even opened up his home and allowed you to stay there and you were skeptical at first as anybody would be but then god started dealing with you and we met and that was a wonderful moment i still remember that moment by god's grace and so maybe you can start right there and start telling us how god started softening your heart and then how you uh reacted to the message and we could pick up right there yeah so we'll start off yeah i met i met you brother jesse and then like i said i had the thought i was like if there's anybody that i've ever met in my life that has a relationship with god or as close to god as this guy so off the bat i said something different about pastor jesse you know so you know so i started going to church you know i started going to this message and really believing it too i mean i would out i had a lot of doubts so my mom was telling me i was in a cult my friends were actually i didn't even really talk to any of my friends i went ghost on everybody but but uh because my mom thought i was a cult you know and i i i didn't know whether to believe it everybody was so sincere i felt a massive amount of love in this church but then again there's always that doubt like oh maybe it's just a cult because i never you know i went to church before and i never experienced anything like this or heard the things that would teach so it was like way different but eventually through all the questions i have for brother jess he was super patient with me i was straight telling him i didn't believe him and stuff and he would show me everywhere in the bible he would always bring it back to the bible which i you know proved it to me so after a while i eventually accepted we had a prophet that lived in modern times and i just missed it and and yeah i just started believing in the message so through that belief and through my little prayer in the parking deck for god to reveal himself that was my prayer to be an answer so i started believing it accepting it and i really started to change you know i saw my life start to get better i was still dealing with the massive amount of depression anxiety but god really started blessing my life because i really started taking it serious you know so i started doing things i never did before like praying you know i started praying i started obeying the word of god you know i started i stopped cussing for a while i remember one day i had a migraine real bad in my room and i wanted to go to church but i was just my head hurt so bad and i literally got down and i was like alright god i was like lord i was like i did a vow with god and i was like god if you take my migraine away right now i was like i will literally throw these pack of cigarettes away and i'll stop smoking and i just stopped you know as soon as i was done praying my migraine literally like just instantly left like and i never have had that experience like when i get a migraine i gotta go to sleep all day i'm throwing up it's terrible so my migraine left completely 100 and i literally shot up took those cigarettes man i threw them in the toilet and i just flushed them i was like all right so be it i was like praise the lord i'm going to church today so i've never seen you know so supernatural things were happening left and right i mean left and right i mean brother jesse he uh he helped me a lot i've never had such a uh great help from a church before everybody in my old churches were super standoffish you know real judgmental not really loving you know i mean brother jesse helped me get a job he let me work at his house a lot when i didn't have money to pay bills you know he invited me over knowing how sinful i used to be would still let me just fellowship with him at his house eat with them it was great so i really started believing it i just really started to see my life change for the better i mean supernatural things still dealing with depression though i didn't have a revelation of how real god was so i didn't i believe that he can cure depression and anxiety you know but it wasn't real to me yet and it wasn't real that he worked that way so i still accepted sickness cancer like oh if you get it you know that's how it is because that's science proves that you know i was a science and medical guy you know i was like oh you know science tops religion you know because it's science so it's true you know i didn't have the revelation yet that god really works in that way that he really hears everything so my depression i saw it almost 100 go away but my mom was with this new guy and he was like really abusive just like my stepdad so that was always getting to me that was like my downfall it was really all good though for like a year and a half for real like just it was all positive uphill it was great i was really blessed uh by austin a number ways you know it was neat to see a person come in right from the world and then just believe the word of god because austin would sit there he'd sit through every service he was at every service i mean we rarely see people come in that will come to every service and be devoted and you woke up i mean brother you hardly miss any services so i was just overwhelmed by your love for god your submission to god your obedience to god's word do you remember when you got that job at the clothing store and as soon as you started tithing i mean they you were blessed i mean god started increasing your hours and it was just it was so beautiful like i just thank god that god gave you a word and i told you brother if you if you tithe god will bless you and then you literally saw god do the you know do that for you god he blessed you increased your hours he made you a manager there or something like it was manager on the fourth day on the fourth day i mean how many people become a manager on the fourth day at any job you know uh it was just really special to see god working your life and then from a father's perspective i want to say this too for our listeners on the podcast austin at that time you'd have been what 20 or 19 19 19. okay so i'm a pastor right at that time i would have been 36. after church you know we had more people at our church at that time and a lot of people went up wanted to come up and talk to me like we had people from pennsylvania and then other people from out of town and they always wanted to make sure they talked to me so my children i never got to play with my children so who would play with my children brother austin would pay with faith my children brother amen it's like god brought austin in and made him a real good example to my children and he became a brother figure you know to my children especially young malachi and brother i just want to tell you that you know that i saw god fill that void because i couldn't spend the time with my kids brother you would run around with them chase them you'd laugh with them you just you treated them like an older brother right you know you ride in the back of our van you know we go out to eat every night get pizza every sunday night you know you just instantly became a part of our family and just from a father's perspective for me i just want to let you know how much of a blessing that was as a pastor as well because i saw you obeying the word of god but then secondly as a father i saw you become just like a sibling in our family it's like my family grew and now my my son had an older brother that's kind of what it felt like to me thank you brother yeah means lot amen meant a lot to have you buddy by god's grace do you want to move on like anything else you want to share before you left you want to start getting into how you left yeah um so yeah i was probably here i probably stayed for about a year and a half like almost every service like you said and uh everything was going good but i started you know realizing i was pretty stagnant you know i had a lot of i got to a point where i wasn't growing anymore and it was just i was just stagnant and it felt like i was just going but i wasn't you know improving in my spiritual walk i still had you know sin in my life and it got to a point to where i was still struggling musically i didn't really believe in myself fully yet but i knew i had a gift and i started getting to the point to where my music desire i really still wanted to be that big shot in hollywood you know i wanted to i really believed that i had a chance to become famous you know rich off of music i i still had worldly desires like i wanted to be rich you know i wanted you know to to be famous i wanted to basically get back at all the people that did me wrong in my life you know by just being rich you know and just being that guy in the world at that time i still didn't really like gospel music you know i i didn't like it or how it sounded really so i just i liked my worldly music still and i wanted to make worldly my own music you know i wanted to make whatever i wanted to make you know so i i i didn't want to do gospel music and it was and i got to a point to where i would try to just write it you know nothing will work and i'll be so frustrated in my house or at home and i would just literally just almost get mad at god like i started getting to a point where i was almost angry with god because i had to give up all the things that i loved you know like i was giving up a lot of things but i didn't give up everything like and music was the thing i couldn't give up i i was i was angry i got to a point where i got real angry and then i remember uh pastor jesse saying in a sermon about how sin in the church if one person is still sinning it can hinder the whole church and i remember at that around that time the church was going through a lot of financial struggles and a lot of problems in the church which with hindsight wasn't even related to me but that's another story but um i i felt like it was me because i was i was still leaving church sinning doing my own music you know i would still i started smoking uh weed again you know i started falling back my mom with that with with the guy that was getting to me too you know because it was just like a bad situation so i started letting the worldly worries back in i was still young too i'm 19. just got out of high school so i still had the whole world you know to explore i haven't even experienced anything in adult life really so i was still young and ambitious and and then one day i came to church and i remember sister naomi was speaking in tongues and that's never happened before so i immediately i felt guilty i was like oh that's about me like god's about to expose me right in front of everybody i'm like oh this is it you know i was like i gotta get i gotta get out of here i gotta leave this church man and really that was the reason too but it was also because i was mad at god and i wanted to do my own music and make it i feel like i was wasting my talent by doing gospel music because to me i didn't really like it at the time so and i didn't see it as a way to actually help others you know i didn't see my god making gospel as a way to heal people or anything so i was looking at it more of a selfish reason but i wanted to be rich to help the people that i loved though so but it was more i just wanted to be famous too so i eventually left i remember the day i left like brother jesse he bought me a car around this time too my first car bought me my car it was a nissan sentra i got my license and literally the day i got my license is the day i left the church and i remember literally i got my car i went home and then the the next sunday came up and instead of going to church i went and met up with my friend kwame in akron i was living in canton at the time and i just didn't go to church and and then after that day i stopped talking to everybody like i never responded to no text nothing i didn't ever go back and i remember i remember the day i didn't go to church i literally said to myself i was like my god is literally gonna tear up or let the devil tear up my life until i come back my life is gonna go into a downhill spiral i literally said it so maybe i manifested that by speaking it or it was uh it became it was true though but yeah so i said that on the day i left and and it really happened so this is where like i thought my life was bad growing up before i met the message it was it turned into complete chaos i'll tell you it was terrible so i left the i left the message and really started going through my real trials man so yeah that reminds me of proverbs 13 15. good understanding giveth favor but the way of transgressors is hard so god had been gracious to you and you started struggling and not growing and then you chose the way of transgression and now you'll probably tell us and proceed to tell us how life became even harder than it was before you come to to know about god boy yeah and that and that actually shows god's grace it reminds us of first corinthians where the bible says you know churches could now we didn't do this but churches can turn disobedient ones over to satan for the destruction of their bodies that their souls might be saved but i never felt led to do that with you all right i never felt like you transgressed against us and failed to repent plus we didn't do the three we never did the three-step process like jesus talks about you know we couldn't even you wouldn't text us back right so we couldn't have any conversations one thing i would add too when i bought you that car um it was a joy to do that for a year and a half brother you had we picked you up for church and uh you never missed a service i don't think you missed one service maybe two maybe one or two you know but you made almost every service and you had worked you paid ties offerings you done everything right and i felt led the lord to buy that car for you the reason i say that is because somebody in the church they're not here anymore but somebody criticized me for that and they said see it was a waste and they kind of made a sound like well austin he never believed in the first place and i said no i said brother i don't agree with that i said i knew austin i said i spent time with austin we prayed together we spent a lot of time together i said i don't know what happened but i said i don't regret it this will come into another part later in the story when we saw you before you moved out to arizona i just want to let the listeners know that when we give to others it's always like giving to the lord right we'll never regret giving because giving is manifesting eternal life right amen so what happened on the day that you left the message because you went a little bit over it about how you met your uh your old friend so you want to go into detail before you move to arizona yeah yeah so uh upon leaving a message mind you the back of my head the whole time while i went through all these things and i left a message for about it was total probably five six years i was i left so but back in my head the whole time while i went through these things i'm about to explain briefly is that like i believed everything i felt guilty for leaving you know like i literally felt so bad for leaving i felt like i let everybody down i really missed everybody in the back of my mind but i knew god god's power was so strong that if i were to text anybody or try to come back i would just be playing spiritual warfare you know just so i just wanted to do it my way and not have anybody in my ear telling me like just to you know they forgive me that you know i didn't want to hear none of that i just want to do it my way so i left the church and around that time i was living at my own house that brother jesse helped me get actually right next door to my mom's house on esther avenue actually i remember it and uh i remember times were getting pretty bad you know my mom was just in another abusive relationship and stuff so that was messing with me and then but eventually i i moved out of that house and i think i moved back in with my mom and her boyfriend again or i was living with them and i remember i was working at the speedway around the corner and one night they had a bad argument and i like went off on the guy and he basically kicked me out and i bit and i quit that speedway job so i left and i was i was back homeless again and these times were real i wasn't really on drugs yet but i was i barely remember these times these are like the very beginning of the hard times i got home i was homeless again and i was back in akron and i was living in my car and i remember i had i was still playing guitar doing music you know just writing my own songs and i remember getting really close to my friend kwame and we just started selling a lot of weed doing scams oh yeah i was i was i was living i was breaking into abandoned houses living in them you know just kind of being a young hard-headed guy in the streets and i was just living how i wanted to for i completely went back on everything i all the progress i made on god you know i started smoking cigarettes again i started smoking weed and that kind of was like that for a while you know i was stable then though i got another job i was kind of stable for like a year after i left the church and then we get to like year number two after i left and and now you know i i was homeless again and i found an apartment i got a bunch of cash together and i basically told the landlord i would pay six months in advance just to let me move in that day because my credit was terrible and it worked he let me get it so it was like a three bedroom apartment in west side akron and i called my friend kwame that was working at the same place as me and i was like hey man let's move in so he moved in with me and that's when everything really started happening you know after after i was not homeless anymore everything was cool we had a lot of money you know i was starting to get a little audience and akron because i would do like shows and akron competitions music competitions i would win in first place and it started to work you know so that's when i kind of was on defense mode and hustle mode when i was homeless so i was putting my feelings on the back end but once i got the house and all the money came in that's when i started to feel everything again and depression hit like no other like i never felt this depressed in my life and then i started getting in into drugs heavy i started using music as an excuse to do drugs like be like i was like i'm a rock star you know i'm i'm when i when i get high i can write songs better and it gives me the ability to go on stage and win competitions you know and so i but really i was just depressed and i was just telling myself that because i was believing a lie and the whole time in the back of my head i was like i'm living a life you know i believe i still believed everything in the church so i knew i was living wrong and that i was going to hell and that none of this mattered so that was also my biggest anxiety and depression because i was like at any moment if i die i know i'm going to hell straight up and i mean i didn't know but i assumed and uh so i thought you know that was weighing on me heavy no matter what i did it felt like i couldn't win and it felt like i was working against god like supernatural things would happen that was just not work nothing was working in my favor like i was not happy or not at all and it just kept getting worse and worse progressively but i wanted to do the music so bad so i remember this is like maybe four months into me doing drugs heavy now i mean i got into xanax so bad i was blacking out i couldn't even remember days i would lose like thousands of dollars at once like one time i remember i lost like four thousand dollars at the mall it just fell out of my pocket like i just lost like three thousand dollars here that it was terrible i would just lose money we'd have massive house parties you know people would steal stuff from our house and i didn't know because i would be out of it and uh i started really wanting it so bad to be famous but in the back of my head i'm like if i go to hollywood i'm going to hell you know it was it was like a i don't really know what i was thinking because i knew it wasn't for anything i was like i believed god was real and that everything was the truth so i knew i was working against god and still there was some force in me that was like i gotta get to hollywood i thought that i would get it to hollywood my way get rich my way and then once i'm established then repent and go to gospel and teach my i had my own you know god was laughing at me so it got worse i started getting more and more depressed my i started ignoring my mom i started really resenting my mom at this point and not really talking to her much and then uh so i just kind of left her to deal with that guy on her own you know and i was just i started treating all my friends bad and my drug fueled rages like the people that really cared about me i would be so cruel to them i remember i i was in the basement for some reason really high downstairs and we found this old antique mirror behind a wall in my basement for summer it was weird it was like i had a pole to this mirror and my friend kwame was like oh that's it's it's it's a haunted mirror just making a joke but i was like no i really feel the pool so i remember one night i started studying a lester crowley which is like the most famous satanist one day i just started getting songs flowing i would do drugs and then like songs would feel like they would come from a different realm and they would just they would flow out of me i'll just take my pen and it's almost like my pen would just write music itself and i'll write these crazy lyrics and then i would i would go and i'll go perform it at different competitions around akron and i'll win first place every time and i was winning cash prizes like five hundred thousand dollars two thousand dollars all the time and i was like oh it's really working so i started doing it more and started selling a lot of drugs and basically it became to the point to where i was buying drugs and not selling them anymore i was just doing them all and i was just doing it so much and it just got to the point to where everything fell apart and i remember just a couple crazy instances like one time i crashed my car into a mcdonald's and i didn't see it at the time but god was protecting me through all of this but yet i did all i remember is just seeing flames and firemen pulling me out and i i woke up the next morning at home i wasn't in jail i didn't get charged with anything no ticket i didn't get in trouble at all i just woke up the next morning and i was like guys i'm gonna go drive to the store get something to drink you guys want something and everybody just started yelling at me they're like with what car dude they told me to look outside and the fire hydrant in front of our house was gone there's a whole bunch of black marks in the street and then they were like bro you crashed into mcdonald's so i went you know and there was stuff in mcdonald's going on i was like how am i not in jail or the police and they're like i don't know you just came walking home last night and you were like you said you didn't know where your car was and i was like i don't know so that's one instant that god protected me uh i remember one time i got so fed up i was just trying to kill myself so i got a whole bunch of ecstasy pills and i took like at work i was taking them all day while i was working at marco's pizza all day long and then and i was making a pizza delivery and i remember right when i got to the guy's house i just remember feeling super dizzy gave him his pizza apologized and then i just drove home didn't even go to work i just drove straight home because i was like oh it was happening but nothing happened realized it was meth it was meth in those ecstasy pillows though so i should have definitely been dead taking that many pills at once but all that happened was just i was just up for 84 hours i remember counting i was up for 84 hours straight but i was just like in my head like what is what is going on why can't i die she said billy promise me you won't worry about me insurance i just about i had a pistol in my hand a few minutes before i snapped it all the way around trying to commit suicide the same day i tried to lay my hand on a 33 000 volt line when i was working as a electrician you know my story and the first thing you know i was on the ground sitting there sweating not knowing what happened had been god reserving this ministry for you people i went right then no matter how much we cry out and think this that other nothing can [Music] sometimes you feel like as i did one time put a pistol against my head to commit suicide but i couldn't do it i took my glove off the lead on a high voltage line where i was working but i couldn't do it something still helped the same god that was with elijah that same god today you see me under the judiciary tree my wife and baby there you are in the grave and my daddy and my brother and all i was about to call myself up later to the juniper tree it's hard i got to a place i saw beside myself i tried to make a gun shoot my brains out and it wouldn't do it see there's work yet to be done something has to be done god wasn't finished he'll always take care of you you know i would take my i brought a i bought a new glock i took it and i put it to my head but i was too scared to pull the trigger so i felt like a failure because i'm like i can't even pull the trigger i would stand on top of parking decks or parking garages try to jump off and it didn't work because i just was too scared to die because i didn't really want to die but i wanted to paint the end and i knew what was going to end the pain going to church but i just didn't want to do that i felt like i was too deep now i felt like everybody was mad at me in the church i'm two three years now out of the church i'm in the midst of drugs that i've never done before all my all my friends are mad at me i felt like i'm ruining my life and then it just came to a climax point to where everything just like i just broke down and one of the last nights i took some fentanyl xanax and my friend kayla said i just stood up and i just fell face first into my table and she said she like sat me on a couch and just had an ice pack on me all night while she was watching me she said she was my breathing was really low but i was just begging them not to call 911 i guess and i was like i'm fine but i was i was i survived so that morning i woke up because she was leaving and so was garrett and they were like we're done and i kind of was like in a rage fuel i felt like i didn't do anything wrong like out that's how out of it i was like i was mad at them for wanting to leave and i went off on everybody so i grabbed the knife and kx tackled me so we were fighting on the ground for a knife and how embarrassing this is talking about it we were fighting on the ground for a knife and he was like what are you doing i've never seen you act like this he's like what are you doing i'm just i'm like i'm over it and then i just it didn't work he took the knife from me so i remember i just bolted out the door into the woods and he called 9-1-1 and my mom told me that he called her it was like he was like i'm so sorry i had to call the police i didn't know what else to do you know he's trying to kill himself and so i remember i took i broke a glass bottle in the woods and i like trying to cut my wrists but then also i was scared at the same time so i couldn't do it that was like the climatic point basically the ambulance came and i agreed to go with them and they put me in a mental hospital call me corncracker because that's from kentucky you know and and uh i was i really was terribly dressed and they'd make fun of my hair hanging printer as long as it is now and um all down over my face now i just have an awful time you know and they would beat me around and slap anytime anybody gets their temper up their ball crowd just get old with me and slap me down here i'll come see and um so then in a fight and we got we gave him i even had knife fights and everything else and he took a winchester rifle and tried to shoot it pumped it right into four or five boys and beat me and i could hardly stand up i would have killed every one of them that meant for god picked up the shells all ground put it back in the gun and just shoot as good as they ever did i've been a murderer a five man probably of five boys was only about 12 years old i tempered after i got out of the mental hospital i remember repenting i remember finally going and i repented so i went home called my grandma i was like nana i got to get out of here she lives in arizona so i told her i got to get out of here then i'm going to end up dead if i stay here and she said she would come and get me and she was literally here within like a couple days so she came i basically told all my friends i was like hey guys i'm out of here like i gotta leave like i'm sorry for everything i just did i was sober finally you know still detoxing but i was sober my mind was messed up and she basically came and got me and right before we left i called brother jesse and i told him everything that was happening and that i was leaving to go to arizona i told him i tried to kill myself and i was like i gotta leave so i just begged my grandma because she didn't want to do it but i just begged her i'm like grandma can we just go to brother jesse's house for a little bit before we leave and she was she finally was like all right so we went over to his house and we i saw everybody you know and mind you this time through all that drug and fueled rage and stuff i got all sorts of tattoos my face has tattoos all over it now i was super high i don't really regret them though but because it's for the testimony but i went there they all saw me i have long hair now i'm covered in face tattoos hands tattoos neck tattoo you know everything and look completely different and they all just looked at me like like like i was just never left and they felt the same love and i it just made me break down you know i just started breaking down i'm like hey guys i'm so sorry for leaving and they told me they don't regret anything and that it's okay they're not mad you know and i told him what happened that i had to leave to get my mind right and he was like okay you know so we all we all kind of had a little prayer session i repented finally it was it was true repentance even though i didn't i still went into sin but it was like i was done with this part of my life done with drugs and and that really just ended that story in ohio like i after that i left his house it was super emotional time but i left his house and went on got on the flight went to arizona and then that's a whole nother story i was in arizona for like three years yeah about three years you know brother and your story you can see a lot about us the spiritual state that you were in uh jesus taught in matthew chapter 12 that each one of us is like a house and we've got to fill our houses with the strong man of faith we've got to fill our our bodies and our minds with good things well in your case you know when you fell away and backslid you know your faith got bound up it got paralyzed uh they you know whenever you started believing you know for um you know fame and music popularity and riches you know when you let those thoughts in that bound up your faith and then think about how many devils came in that would cause you to do that amount of drugs and cause you to get into witchcraft and tempt you with suicide all these things are just a result of you know you opening up your mind to the wrong spirit but then here right before you leave to arizona you come to my house and uh it was like you never left right you know to to me it was like he's back that's what it felt like too it felt like i never left yeah i remember we sat down there you and i alone down in my little family area downstairs and and you were kind of wondering you know can god forgive me i'm like absolutely god i forgive you yeah brother branham said uh the way you know you haven't gone too far is if you still have a desire to serve the lord you had this desire to serve the lords that's how you know you hadn't gone too far you hadn't sold your soul to the devil you know you were just deceived and you were just tempted i remember saying that prayer brother we cried together we repented i led you in prayer we had a great hug we had a great embrace there and then you flew off to arizona yeah but i think about brother think about all those times like you were saying you almost died this night you almost died that night and i wonder how many of those nights these girls put prayer requests in for you on those nights where you should have died because of drug overdose you should have died because of suicide but yet death escaped you every time death couldn't take you because of the prayers of the saints yeah i mean it was legitimately like that i mean i literally just don't understand how i'm alive like it doesn't make sense yeah it makes no sense uh and so all we can say is god started protecting you more after you left the message to protect your life and uh because god knew you'd eventually come back it's like the prodigal son right you know you started off good you started off in the house of lord you know when you got saved but then you wanted to go out and experience the world and god had to break you down break you down and what was the reason that the son didn't die because god knew he would come back you know the father knew he would come back and so that's the beautiful part about your testimony you know your life got even worse after leaving the message but even in that god knew you'd want to serve him so god had extra grace the bible said god gives us more grace the bible says the headstone comes down with shoutings of grace grace unto it so god you know like all of us too but you know especially in your case you can see how god poured out an extra measure of grace upon your life to protect your life yeah there's so many circumstances i mean that's that's just scraping the surface this is i could have went so much more deeper for time's sake just to give a visual of how crazy it got you know that's it's lots of grace i mean it's i can't explain some of the things that i went through and i'm still here or i mean i should either be dead or in jail there's so many times that he made me get no legal problems i mean i had my license suspended yeah but i never got arrested never had warrants i should have got a dui i should definitely went to jail got arrested 100 my license might even have been suspended at that point i don't remember but it's only god like i don't even it's it's scary that i don't even remember some of these things but it's only god brother it's only god man so we can see god protecting you from death god protecting you from prison god protecting you from suicide yeah i mean god protected you from everything so again we just we just give all the credit to god because god god protected your life and this reminds me how brother branham you know um he tried to commit suicide brother ram tried to murder other people and each time god stepped in god wouldn't let the gun go off he was going to shoot those two boys when they made fun of him and beaten him up he went out to shoot him and the gun wouldn't go off and then when the boys left he shot it and the gun went off wow one time he tried to commit suicide up on a uh electric pole and right when he was gonna connect the electricity he passed out and he woke up on the ground alive so in other words god had to step in numerous times because god had a plan for his life and so that tells us obviously god has a great plan for your life definitely feeling like it now for sure yeah we just finished part two of this testimony and we have another part that we want to finish up with with brad austin going to arizona and i hope that you can stay tuned to listen to the rest of the testimony as we close we want to play a song brother
