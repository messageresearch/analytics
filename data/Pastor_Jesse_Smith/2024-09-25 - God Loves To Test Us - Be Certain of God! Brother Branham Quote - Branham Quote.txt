TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you know it's a strange thing may God let this soap into every one of you if you never hear me preach again let this be a message it's strange most strange that sometimes that God does things that way you know when we have confessed our sins and met every request requirement that God requires we believed on God there's a circumstances has to be met and it's according to his will and we've confessed our sins and we've made all the wrongs that we have did right done everything that we know how to do every requirement that God has made or asked we have met that requirement and yet he lays silent it just won't answer us I'm sure that I'm speaking to people this morning who's come to that place I've been there many times myself when I went back and traced my life and turned over every stone and I find that I did something wrong go confess it and say Lord God I'll make it right and go do so then come back again and say now Lord th God you'll answer me surely I met every request that you required me to do and every requirement I have met it and still he won't move seems to set silent that's when you've got to be sure that he is God don't be discouraged the only thing isn't in your heart to be certain of God my text be certain first before you do anything be certain in your heart that it's God and when you've met everything that he said then you're sure that he's God that's when Faith goes to work right there Fai stand steady for it knows that he is and you met every requirement you believe that he is and Faith Hold Steady oh blessed be his name Faith won't move or it sure that God is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him may this go away down deep and never move from you brandom Tabernacle if you've met God's requirements and in your heart you believe that he is God's only testing your faith for he loves to do that you've confessed your sin and you've met every requirement that God requires and still he lays silent remember faith says that he is then Faith holds on to it not knowing what it's all about but it knows that he is and it's certain that he is then remember if he is his words has to be true and if he required you to meet these circumstances and you did he's obligated to take care of his word don't back off and say I never got healed I oh you poor weak Faith don't believe that if everything's confessed everything's out and you met God's requirement face hes right there there's nothing will move it he is and you're sure they that wait upon the Lord shall renew to their strength they shall Mount up with the wings of an eagle they shall run and not be weary if they walk they shall not faint wait when you met his requirement that brings your faith to a showdown if you have met God's requirements has been made or met and you have fully considered it and you have done everything that God required you to do then your faith rests right there that he is be certain of God you know he loves to test us he loves to see the reaction of your faith did you know that God likes to see how you react when you say oh Lord I believe you Thou Are My Savior I believe that you are the Healer I believe that you are the one who gives the Holy Spirit and the things that I am requiring you are the God who gives that and then when you confess all your sins and promise God what you'll do if he'll let you get well and then because it don't happen you run off like a card somewhere God can't use that there's no way for him to use you there's no way for him to answer you because he only Answers by faith then all of a sudden you go away and he can't answer but real true Faith stands there being sure that God is he's certain that he is and if God asks this thing to be done to confess your sins and so forth and you've done it faith says that he is it's certain that it's going to happen your request has to be granted well I hope you don't miss that if you're sure of God God's sure of his word he's only waiting to test you
