[44:14] yeah i feel it just moving right on in
[44:17] just slipping right on in
[44:19] it's the angels of the lord showing
[44:24] so appreciate the lord all right daniel
[44:27] chapter 10 and let's pick up now
[44:31] verse 7. and i just want to catch one
[44:32] verse and then skip down a bit
[44:34] just to get kind of a kind of a setting
[44:36] here and i daniel alone saw the vision
[44:40] the men that were with me saw the vision
[44:42] but the great quaking fell upon them so
[44:44] that they fled to hide
[44:46] themselves therefore i was left alone
[44:49] and saw this great vision
[44:53] now got verse 12. they said unto me fear
[44:56] not daniel
[44:57] but from the first day that thou did has
[45:00] set thine heart to understand
[45:02] i want you to listen in words not only
[45:05] did god hear what daniel was saying day
[45:08] one
[45:09] but daniel's prayer created activity
[45:13] in another dimension amen his desires
[45:16] created activity
[45:18] glory in another dimension hallelujah
[45:20] hallelujah praise the lord now watch
[45:23] he said i like this he said
[45:28] i am come for thy words
[45:32] thy words were heard and i
[45:35] am come for thy words yes
[45:39] appreciate the lord now let me read to
[45:41] you out of a message
[45:42] um brother man just takes a little
[45:45] thought here and and i i like how he
[45:47] says this he said
[45:49] uh in the presence of the lord jesus the
[45:51] title the presence of the lord jesus
[45:52] this is
[45:53] 55 if you're interested look at this up
[45:55] sometime he said there's minor angels
[45:57] he said perhaps it's angels with us he
[46:00] said of that that comes to the
[46:02] your humble servant he said and that's
[46:04] probably a minor angel but when gabriel
[46:06] comes
[46:06] brother there's something really on the
[46:08] road something major is going to happen
[46:11] gabriel announced the first coming of
[46:13] the lord jesus
[46:15] and gabriel will announce the second
[46:17] coming
[46:18] of the lord jesus and then brother brown
[46:20] says amen
[46:21] let's pray together with the word lord
[46:23] jesus as we bow our heads to you
[46:25] we are so grateful father for the
[46:27] opportunity to be able to open up the

[47:09] the preaching
[47:10] will be an utterance from almighty god
[47:12] may it not be the voice of man that has
[47:14] heard but
[47:14] may the spirit of the lord speak through
[47:16] us in the name of the lord jesus christ
[47:19] as we commit the word both speaker and
[47:21] listener to your hands
[47:22] in jesus name amen amen amen god bless
[47:26] you may be seated
[47:27] may the lord bless you real real good
[47:29] and i'm going to keep my eye on that
[47:30] clock real close tonight
[47:31] i don't want to get in a gigantic hurry
[47:33] but i realize you got work school and
[47:35] uh and and folks to take care of and so
[47:38] we want to make sure you're ready to be
[47:39] able to do that
[47:40] but we don't want to just cut it off now
[47:43] we want to spend some time in a word
[47:45] but i also realize that you know timing
[47:48] allows to stay here all night
[47:49] and believe me i could stay here a month
[47:51] on this subject right here and all the
[47:53] things the lord has
[47:54] showed me on this over the past several
[47:55] weeks uh it would take me as i was
[47:57] telling brother cam
[47:58] uh last week it would take me a good
[48:00] month just a solid month of preaching
[48:02] just to scratch the surface of some of
[48:04] the things that i found in the message
[48:06] in the bible
[48:07] on these angels of the lord so what i
[48:10] want to bring to you tonight by the help
[48:12] of god
[48:12] is the this is the highlights of the
[48:14] whole study
[48:15] and uh i thought well in evangelism i'll
[48:18] just kindly throw out some of the main
[48:20] points out there
[48:21] and then you got a pastor sitting back
[48:22] there and that's part of his call is to
[48:24] take months and dig into these things
[48:26] and
[48:26] so maybe he can run into it and and
[48:28] bring it in later
[48:29] but um i i want to try to show you
[48:32] uh because i i personally feel that this
[48:35] is an important subject to us especially
[48:37] now we're living in
[48:38] the importance of the angels of god that
[48:41] are with us
[48:42] in this uh last day and i i want to try
[48:45] to show you some of the reasoning
[48:47] as to why that when we point to a cloud
[48:51] up in the sky in arizona
[48:53] so i was looking for the jesse's got the
[48:54] life magazine back on his desk and
[48:56] i've got one myself and many believers
[48:59] you know we get it we
[49:00] open it up like this and we look at it
[49:02] and we see those
[49:03] angels that wigged the face of the lord
[49:06] jesus out there in arizona
[49:07] and as i was speaking to uh brother doug
[49:10] baker the one that invented the four
[49:12] missile out there
[49:13] that they claim and the claim is made
[49:15] that it's just rocket ship smoke
[49:17] but i spoke to brother doug and we were
[49:19] talking and he said my rocket don't do
[49:21] that amen
[49:22] and i asked him his rocket he said yes i
[49:24] i'm i was on the team the lead of
[49:26] engineers
[49:27] that uh done the uh mechanics and the
[49:30] invention
[49:31] to make the rocket that supposedly was
[49:33] the one that made that ring cloud he
[49:35] said
[49:35] my rocket don't do that now we
[49:37] understand what brother venom said
[49:39] about this event in arizona he makes the
[49:42] statement rise in the sun
[49:43] that that's our lord up there we know
[49:46] what he talked about
[49:47] when he talked about the visions of the
[49:48] lord coming and the visitation of these
[49:51] angels of god
[49:52] as they appeared now that's significant
[49:55] to us because
[49:56] whether folks realize it or not and i
[49:58] personally believe and you don't have to
[49:59] believe this but this is what i believe
[50:01] i believe one reason it has been so
[50:03] attacked is because
[50:05] it is the fulfillment of the prophecy
[50:07] that jesus gave in the last day
[50:10] that with the time of the harvest the
[50:12] angels of the lord would come
[50:14] and they would sever some gather others
[50:16] and they would separate
[50:18] and then we see according to matthew
[50:20] chapter 13 if you got your bible you can
[50:22] turn there or
[50:23] look here on the screen they'll flash it
[50:25] as we go and uh pick up three verses 39
[50:28] 41
[50:28] and 49 and in these three verses it just
[50:31] kind of highlights the whole
[50:33] thing that jesus is talking about when
[50:35] he said that the enemy that sowed the
[50:37] tear of them being the tear
[50:40] the harvest is the end of the world and
[50:42] the reapers
[50:43] are but the angels all right now that
[50:47] scripture that's your bible
[50:49] skipping down to verse 41 just a verse
[50:51] or two there he said the son of man
[50:53] shall send forth his angels in it
[50:56] interesting that he said
[50:57] the son of man would send forth his
[50:59] angels notice not son of god not son of
[51:01] david
[51:02] but son of man which is what we believe
[51:04] was restored back here in luke 17
[51:06] that the hour we are living would be the
[51:08] restoration or the revealing
[51:10] of the son of man and in the hour of the
[51:13] son of man ministry
[51:14] then the angels of god would come forth
[51:16] watch now
[51:17] they shall gather out of his kingdom all
[51:20] things that offend and them which do
[51:22] iniquity and then in verse 49 so shall
[51:25] it be at the end of the world again
[51:27] the angels shall come forth and sever
[51:31] the wicked from
[51:32] among the just so i believe with all my
[51:35] heart you don't have to believe this
[51:36] anybody that gets this recording and
[51:38] picks it up on youtube or facebook or
[51:40] wherever this may go
[51:41] you don't have to agree with what i'm
[51:42] getting ready to say i'm telling you i
[51:44] believe this this is my revelation of
[51:46] what i believe is taking place
[51:48] but one reason that that cloud in
[51:50] arizona has been so attacked
[51:52] is it is the fulfillment of the prophecy
[51:55] that jesus spoke in the last day
[51:57] that god would send forth his angels to
[52:00] gather and to sever
[52:02] all those that are just would be
[52:04] gathered into the barn all those that
[52:05] were unjust would be severed away
[52:08] from the rest of the bride of jesus
[52:09] christ now let me bring a little
[52:11] illumination to you
[52:13] about where we're living today and uh
[52:15] will you give me a little time can i do
[52:16] that tonight
[52:17] all right now i want you to understand
[52:19] that as a bible believing christian
[52:21] number one
[52:22] i don't want to receive anything that i
[52:24] hear unless i can understand it by
[52:26] scriptural authority
[52:28] as a bible-believing christian i don't
[52:29] want to be baptized in a way that's not
[52:31] bible
[52:32] i don't want to live in a way that's not
[52:34] bible i don't want to marry in a way
[52:35] that's not bible
[52:36] i don't want to eat or drink in a way
[52:39] that's not bible
[52:40] i want my plum line or my absolute to be
[52:43] based upon
[52:43] what the scripture has taught us right
[52:45] now so and we realize
[52:46] it's the famous scripture people say
[52:48] well if you seek him in the desert and
[52:50] they'll say now so you don't go running
[52:51] after that in arizona
[52:53] there ain't nothing to that well i'll
[52:55] agree with you
[52:56] that that some people might view the
[52:58] events of the last day
[53:00] as being a bunch of nonsense as i heard
[53:02] a man speaking
[53:03] uh not too long ago and he said that
[53:05] brother branham has a wonderful
[53:07] gifted man and when the anointing was on
[53:08] him he was a prophet of god deserting
[53:11] signs and wonders
[53:12] but he said because he couldn't accept
[53:13] trinity and because he couldn't accept
[53:15] this and that
[53:16] you know he just got off in his teaching
[53:18] but if he's a true
[53:19] prophet of the living god of the last
[53:21] day
[53:22] a prophet is a divine revealer of the
[53:25] scripture somebody say amen
[53:26] amen his ministry his job if he is a
[53:30] prophet of the lord
[53:31] is to be a mouthpiece for almighty god
[53:33] in other words
[53:34] his thoughts become blended with god's
[53:36] thoughts his
[53:37] voice becomes blended with god's voice
[53:40] and god speaks right through the man
[53:41] what god's mind and thoughts and heart
[53:43] is
[53:44] for the hour we're living in but
[53:46] remember we're not looking at this
[53:47] through the filter
[53:48] of an old testament and i'd say a
[53:50] keyhole in a motel
[53:52] we're not looking at it through the
[53:53] keyhole of the old testament because
[53:55] a new testament prophet is not the same
[53:58] thing as an old testament prophet
[54:00] when god was dealing with those in the
[54:02] ages and he was dealing with israel as a
[54:04] nation an old testament prophet
[54:06] would step out of the wilderness we thus
[54:07] saith the lord step back into the
[54:09] wilderness
[54:10] and you better listen to that because he
[54:12] was the only voice that god was going to
[54:14] speak through
[54:15] in that generation amen there was never
[54:18] two prophets major prophets
[54:20] that were running their messages at the
[54:21] same time there was never two major
[54:23] influences pulling this way in that way
[54:26] god always had one mouthpiece speaking
[54:28] out
[54:29] bringing the people together all right
[54:30] let's go a little bit further but then
[54:32] when we come to the new testament then
[54:34] we discover that there are many prophets
[54:37] and that's in the plural
[54:39] down through the new testament but we
[54:41] also realize
[54:42] that jesus spoke to us that there would
[54:44] be
[54:45] those in the ages that would be what he
[54:48] called messengers to each church age
[54:50] and in the apostolic form of the gentile
[54:53] bride
[54:54] it would not just be a prophet speaking
[54:57] but it would be one messenger of god
[54:59] that would be given the message of the
[55:01] lord for that hour that message would
[55:03] speak out
[55:04] once the message went out then all of
[55:06] those ministries prophets included
[55:08] would come right out underneath that
[55:10] ministry and what would they be doing
[55:12] they'd be bringing the people to the
[55:13] truth to the revelation of that hour
[55:15] and they would be speaking only what the
[55:17] revelation of that hour was
[55:18] amen exactly right and remember these
[55:21] stars were in the right hand
[55:22] of almighty god and that's exactly what
[55:25] isaiah prophesied
[55:26] when he asked the question to whom is
[55:29] the arm of the lord revealed
[55:31] well the arm or the revelation of the
[55:33] arm of the lord was revealed in those
[55:35] seven messengers
[55:36] whenever those seven messengers began to
[55:38] reveal what was the body of christ
[55:40] what was the fullness of the godhead
[55:43] what was the unity of the bride in jesus
[55:45] christ
[55:45] who is jesus christ is he a second a
[55:48] third what kind of person is he
[55:50] when the revelation come it showed that
[55:52] god was
[55:53] god and he was all in all and he was one
[55:56] he wasn't two he wasn't three
[55:58] he wasn't nine like many had said many
[56:00] years ago but he was he was
[56:02] absolutely almighty god and his bride
[56:05] together
[56:06] in a body the head and the body
[56:09] consequently that's what showed up in
[56:11] arizona ahead
[56:13] the revelation of the lord showing us
[56:15] now that the revelation of god
[56:17] would be fulfilled in the last day and
[56:20] the angels of the lord
[56:22] would bring a unity of the body of jesus
[56:25] christ
[56:25] friends i'm going to go on record and
[56:26] say something and and i realized that
[56:29] with this being recorded like this that
[56:31] could be spun anyway but
[56:32] i want to be very transparent when i say
[56:34] this and i want to be very blunt when i
[56:36] say this and make the statement that
[56:38] i realize that the reason that some of
[56:40] our message churches
[56:42] are are empty like they are it's not
[56:44] always because we're so spiritual and
[56:46] nobody can handle us i realize
[56:48] there's a lot of nonsense that runs
[56:49] through our churches there's people that
[56:51] aren't born again
[56:52] pastors that aren't born again deacons
[56:54] that aren't born again that have created
[56:56] a lot of trouble i get that and i
[56:58] realize that people leave churches
[56:59] because
[57:00] of their treatment how they've been
[57:02] treated and the lies and the things they
[57:03] see going on
[57:04] they just get fed up with it so i'm
[57:06] leaving i understand that too
[57:08] but at the same time did you ever stop
[57:10] to consider that one reason why our
[57:13] movement as far as we say the message of
[57:15] the hour
[57:16] our movement has you know maybe say a
[57:18] thousand to the million on the other
[57:20] side
[57:21] is because of the ministry of these
[57:23] angels of the lord
[57:25] because remember if they're called to
[57:26] sever and they're called
[57:28] to gather then these angels of the lord
[57:30] as we read this morning from greatest
[57:32] battle ever fought
[57:33] that brother man said a true angel of
[57:35] the lord will only preach the word
[57:38] that's all they can preach and then if
[57:39] an angel paul said
[57:41] or we ourself come from heaven preached
[57:43] anything contrary
[57:44] let him be a curse and brother branham
[57:46] said he preached exactly what paul
[57:49] preached
[57:50] amen that's why i'm not ashamed to pull
[57:51] brother branham to believe brother
[57:52] branham to follow the message of the
[57:54] hour
[57:54] because what brother branham had to say
[57:56] it dovetailed with what paul taught us
[57:59] amen and when the angel of the lord come
[58:02] in the last day
[58:03] and told him about divine gifts and told
[58:05] him about divine ministry
[58:06] amen everything that brother branham
[58:09] accomplished in his ministry
[58:10] was according to the prophecy that was
[58:13] given about his life
[58:15] and realized that in the last day that
[58:17] it was promised that there would be a
[58:19] forerunner
[58:20] to come and gather up all these
[58:22] mysteries of god
[58:23] he would be a church age messenger he
[58:25] would be one of the stars that was the
[58:27] revelation in the hand of the lord
[58:29] that would reveal to the body of jesus
[58:32] christ
[58:32] where they were standing now jesus said
[58:35] when these angels
[58:36] come there would be tares and then there
[58:38] would be wheat all right is that what he
[58:39] said
[58:40] he said he would gather some tares he
[58:42] said he would gather some wheat
[58:43] well how do you know what exactly
[58:45] position you're standing in
[58:47] of whether or not you're a tear or
[58:49] whether or not you're weak
[58:50] unless there is a divine revelation
[58:53] straight from the scripture
[58:54] to show you the position of where you
[58:57] come from
[58:58] who you are and where you're going amen
[59:01] that's why in the last day the spirit of
[59:03] god sent a man to this generation
[59:06] to reveal to the body of christ where
[59:08] we're standing and who we are
[59:10] where we come from and where we're going
[59:12] amen and that's why elijah had to return
[59:14] to this world was to give you and i
[59:16] a look into god's gospel mirror amen
[59:20] to see who you were you remember that
[59:22] little boy he waved and it way back
[59:23] smiled and smiled back and said finally
[59:25] got it you understood that was me
[59:26] in there amen that's what brother
[59:28] branham did and you realize that as i
[59:30] said this morning
[59:31] william branham did not come to bring
[59:34] any new revelation whatsoever
[59:36] remember the book was completed when the
[59:39] book was shut up
[59:40] amen it was sealed with seven seals you
[59:43] cannot add two
[59:44] you cannot take away the revelation is
[59:46] complete in this bible
[59:48] but remember there were secrets that
[59:51] were laying in this book of revelation
[59:53] and hey buddy let me just go on record
[59:54] and tell you something right now
[59:56] not all rabbits uh or roberts not billy
[59:58] graham
[59:59] not jack cole not a allen not one man
[1:00:02] desired or thirsted or alone to look
[1:00:05] into the revelation of this bible
[1:00:08] to understand what those secrets were to
[1:00:10] ladies
[1:00:12] find me where oral roberts spend time
[1:00:14] digging in find me where billy graham
[1:00:16] desired to look into it
[1:00:18] finally some man out there that really
[1:00:20] wanted to know what the truth of the
[1:00:21] bible was
[1:00:23] you won't find him you got different men
[1:00:25] that come along like mr hagin and some
[1:00:27] of those
[1:00:28] that that done what they call bible
[1:00:30] teaching and all of their trinity tommy
[1:00:32] writing bible teaching to me
[1:00:34] that's wasted my time amen amen i can
[1:00:37] read the bible to see that god is one
[1:00:38] hero israel the lord our god is one god
[1:00:40] and fear him
[1:00:42] and the devil knows better than that
[1:00:44] satan don't even believe his own
[1:00:45] trinitarian doctrine
[1:00:48] right he preaches he he knows that he's
[1:00:50] one he's been up there and split face to
[1:00:52] face with a man
[1:00:53] he knows there's not a big old
[1:00:54] grandfather god with a big long beard
[1:00:56] hanging there
[1:00:57] jesus sitting on his right arm on his
[1:01:00] knee or something and the holy ghost
[1:01:01] running around like a bad man the devil
[1:01:03] knows better than that
[1:01:04] satan knows he's one god the bible said
[1:01:07] he knows it and he trembles at the very
[1:01:08] idea
[1:01:10] that's right so it's not a an idea of
[1:01:12] okay well
[1:01:13] now now we're going to do what they call
[1:01:15] bible teaching well their bible teaching
[1:01:17] pointed an organization
[1:01:19] the bible teaching point and put your
[1:01:20] name on the books getting tongues for
[1:01:22] evidence
[1:01:23] uh on and on and on but now we're
[1:01:25] looking at a man in the last generation
[1:01:28] that like daniel desired to know
[1:01:31] what was going to take place in the hour
[1:01:33] he was living in
[1:01:34] america as different men have said in
[1:01:36] different time that brother branham
[1:01:37] tried to make changes to himself he was
[1:01:39] listening at a man this morning
[1:01:41] and he was talking about brother branham
[1:01:42] and he said brother branham desired to
[1:01:44] make a change from being a great
[1:01:46] evangelist to making himself a prophet
[1:01:48] and i i said how ridiculous if you even
[1:01:50] knew anything
[1:01:51] about the ministry of william branham
[1:01:53] you know how many times he struggled
[1:01:55] with even the identity of being called a
[1:01:57] prophet
[1:01:59] even in those prayer lines when he was
[1:02:00] standing up there and he would say do
[1:02:02] you believe me to be his prophet
[1:02:04] uh his servant i don't mean to say that
[1:02:06] that stumbles people he says
[1:02:08] hey man there was a reality inside of
[1:02:10] brother bradley that he knew
[1:02:11] that god had called into a higher office
[1:02:13] he knew that god
[1:02:14] had called him to be a prophet of the
[1:02:16] lord he wasn't no dumb bunny as we say
[1:02:19] in the south
[1:02:20] he understood exactly what his ministry
[1:02:22] was supposed to be about to some extent
[1:02:24] he knew god had caught it even when
[1:02:26] media got down to pray he tells us about
[1:02:28] in the church age
[1:02:29] about lord now i've heard you give
[1:02:31] scriptures and things like this
[1:02:32] to encourage us and lead us and said she
[1:02:35] got down about praying about mary and
[1:02:36] brother branham
[1:02:37] and she said she grabbed her bible when
[1:02:39] she did she jerked it open and said
[1:02:41] behold i send you a lie to the prophet
[1:02:43] before they come now brother
[1:02:44] tells that story while he's preaching
[1:02:46] the church ages brother madam wasn't
[1:02:48] silly he understood
[1:02:49] the message that he was sending to those
[1:02:51] people but because he did not desire
[1:02:54] to take the flame and the claim of fame
[1:02:56] to himself
[1:02:57] he was always trying to step away from
[1:02:59] that he'd drop it in
[1:03:01] step it away drop it in step it away
[1:03:03] amen but understand
[1:03:05] just like daniel this was a man that
[1:03:08] wanted to know
[1:03:09] what is going on in this hour amen
[1:03:13] yes sir the bible said daniel set his
[1:03:15] heart to understand can you imagine
[1:03:17] he looks across all of israel now he's
[1:03:20] not not taught
[1:03:21] israel the nation i mean israel the
[1:03:22] people right here he is locked in
[1:03:24] babylon
[1:03:25] 70 years has been determined that god's
[1:03:28] going to house his people
[1:03:29] under judgment they're going to be bound
[1:03:30] and changed they're going to be stuck in
[1:03:32] this
[1:03:32] position when i say chains i don't mean
[1:03:35] natural bondage now but i mean
[1:03:36] they're made slaves to the nation
[1:03:39] they're not permitted to go as
[1:03:41] they want to go and come as they want to
[1:03:42] come and so forth like that
[1:03:44] and no doubt daniel when they erected
[1:03:47] that great statue out there remember i
[1:03:49] heard a preacher preach it many years
[1:03:50] ago one
[1:03:51] little thing like you'd say the size of
[1:03:52] this microphone it was about 20 foot
[1:03:54] tall i think the brothers did
[1:03:56] so i don't know how tall it was but
[1:03:58] something on that order yeah and all the
[1:04:00] israelites started bowing down and
[1:04:02] worshipping at the image of daniel
[1:04:04] did you imagine what it must have done
[1:04:05] to that little prophet of god to look
[1:04:07] out there and watch the people that he
[1:04:09] knew
[1:04:09] obeyed the same law we're supposed to
[1:04:11] about don't worship graven images
[1:04:14] and then this group of israelites are
[1:04:15] falling down on their face
[1:04:17] and worship with the image under
[1:04:18] political pressure no doubt
[1:04:20] right they were quarantined just like
[1:04:22] everybody else has been quarantined
[1:04:24] they had their own little political
[1:04:26] church pressures and things right
[1:04:27] and here except for three other men
[1:04:29] shadowed meshach of indigo
[1:04:31] all these israelites are are
[1:04:33] compromising their standard
[1:04:35] what it must have done to the little
[1:04:36] heart of that prophet of god daniel when
[1:04:39] he looked across there and saw that
[1:04:40] church compromising like that
[1:04:43] something began to turn in him something
[1:04:46] began to happen in his mind
[1:04:48] his heart began to smite him maybe and
[1:04:50] he threw open his windows and he raised
[1:04:52] his hands up to god and he said oh
[1:04:53] jehovah
[1:04:54] i need to know what's going on anybody
[1:04:57] ever felt like that sometimes you just
[1:04:59] god i need to understand what's going on
[1:05:02] there's a hidden mystery in there
[1:05:03] sometimes you don't understand what the
[1:05:04] revelation is
[1:05:06] but like daniel you set your heart to
[1:05:08] understand god what's the end of it all
[1:05:10] right
[1:05:11] how does it all figure into my life
[1:05:13] what's the result of everything
[1:05:15] amen and hear daniel as he begins to
[1:05:17] pray now notice
[1:05:18] as i quoted to you this morning that at
[1:05:20] the angels would say on a 10-point scale
[1:05:22] if an angel was an eight
[1:05:24] when he fell from heaven become a demon
[1:05:25] he would always be innate
[1:05:28] never lost one ounce of power his
[1:05:30] authority if you want to say authority
[1:05:31] or power whatever it was was always just
[1:05:33] the way it was
[1:05:35] and so as gabriel begins to descend
[1:05:38] and moves from that spiritual realm now
[1:05:41] he's beginning to
[1:05:41] fall down to contact daniel
[1:05:44] there was a demon that controlled persia
[1:05:47] brother
[1:05:48] tells us the message called victory day
[1:05:50] that the reason that wars are created
[1:05:52] and fought on the earth and so forth
[1:05:53] he says because there's demons that
[1:05:55] control the nations they get jealous of
[1:05:57] one another and start a war on the earth
[1:06:01] that's the reason why it happens in
[1:06:02] churches two demons on two different
[1:06:05] people get mad and jealous of one
[1:06:06] another they start as church split yes
[1:06:07] sir
[1:06:08] or some other kind of thing like that
[1:06:10] some other little family altercation
[1:06:12] it's just demon powers all there is to
[1:06:14] it yes now when gabriel descends
[1:06:16] the the demon or this former angel
[1:06:19] fallen angel
[1:06:20] that he meets when he comes to persia
[1:06:22] had more power than him
[1:06:24] he could not overcome him right for 21
[1:06:27] days he fights this demon
[1:06:29] and he said i would have been completely
[1:06:31] overcome but he said michael
[1:06:34] your prince come and help me out oh i
[1:06:36] like them words your prince
[1:06:39] now notice it was because daniel now
[1:06:42] listen close
[1:06:43] it was because daniel wanted to know
[1:06:46] what hour he was living in the very
[1:06:49] burden of his heart created activity in
[1:06:51] another dimension
[1:06:52] amen amen things were stirred up in a
[1:06:56] supernatural way
[1:06:58] no doubt there was results from the
[1:07:00] supernatural presence of god
[1:07:03] that would have never been known had not
[1:07:04] daniel set his heart to understand
[1:07:06] yes yes sir i want you to stop a moment
[1:07:08] and thank you in your mind
[1:07:09] why do you recognize the holy spirit
[1:07:11] gets stirred up in churches sometimes
[1:07:14] because there's some saints of god and
[1:07:15] they're crying out to god lord we need
[1:07:17] revelation we need to understand
[1:07:19] we need you to move amongst our homes
[1:07:20] our families amen
[1:07:22] the very moment you set your heart to
[1:07:24] know it creates an
[1:07:25] activity in them other realms it creates
[1:07:28] a buzz a stir
[1:07:29] it creates a a momentum in that other
[1:07:32] realm
[1:07:32] because remember if these angels of the
[1:07:34] lord are commissioned of god to serve
[1:07:36] you
[1:07:37] the very moment you have a need they go
[1:07:39] into action
[1:07:43] i wonder sometimes when we look at this
[1:07:45] whole scene
[1:07:47] do we really understand why pentecost
[1:07:49] had the movement at hand
[1:07:52] you realize that whenever 1906 pentecost
[1:07:54] had started
[1:07:56] we're talking over 100 years now yeah
[1:07:59] you go back and look
[1:08:00] what was it it was people that really
[1:08:01] wanted to know what god was all about
[1:08:04] that's right they desire to know is god
[1:08:07] just a justification is god just a
[1:08:08] sanctification what is he
[1:08:11] and as they begin to look at the whole
[1:08:13] pictures we would say look at the whole
[1:08:15] thing
[1:08:16] oh i like how a friend of mine said it
[1:08:19] many years ago he said
[1:08:21] william seymour he said he was a
[1:08:23] one-eyed black man he said but william
[1:08:25] seymour could be more with one eye than
[1:08:27] most people could but
[1:08:29] hallelujah he began to look into the
[1:08:32] revelation of the hour
[1:08:34] he prayed with his head in a box asking
[1:08:37] god to move amongst the pentecostal
[1:08:38] people
[1:08:39] before long god visit them on that azusa
[1:08:42] street revival
[1:08:43] and from that revival it's spurred all
[1:08:45] around the world i've just done a
[1:08:46] a peer-reviewed study and when i say
[1:08:48] peer-reviewed i mean from experts and i
[1:08:50] studied pentecost
[1:08:52] from every facet every direction i read
[1:08:54] from many many doctors and scholars and
[1:08:57] theologians
[1:08:57] and let me tell you something brother
[1:08:59] when william seymour and the azusa bunch
[1:09:01] when they got rolling that thing didn't
[1:09:03] just start in azusa it went around the
[1:09:05] world in a matter of a year
[1:09:07] it touched australia it touched africa
[1:09:09] it's still burning in africa right now
[1:09:12] until pentecost is larger in africa than
[1:09:14] any other cotton in the world outside
[1:09:15] the united states
[1:09:17] they still identify themselves with that
[1:09:19] original move
[1:09:21] what was it people wanted to know what
[1:09:22] was the truth
[1:09:24] they wanted to know if god was in the
[1:09:26] supernatural god left him
[1:09:27] he'd be with us where's all of his
[1:09:29] miracles people began praying to
[1:09:32] understand
[1:09:32] and from the pentecostal movement now
[1:09:35] we're moving into a dispensation of time
[1:09:37] that god is raising up these healing
[1:09:39] ministries
[1:09:40] yes when the angel of the lord meets
[1:09:43] brother branham in 1947 he tells him
[1:09:45] about the gifts of god he sends him to
[1:09:47] the field
[1:09:48] brother man goes out with a great
[1:09:49] healing revival and while he's out there
[1:09:51] on the field in this great healing
[1:09:52] revival
[1:09:53] amen he praying for kings and blinded
[1:09:55] eyes coming over
[1:09:56] on and on and on and on and on
[1:09:59] all of a sudden something happened to
[1:10:01] this little prophet
[1:10:03] he began to see the dissension amongst
[1:10:05] his brethren in pentecost
[1:10:06] oh i hope you're listening to me he
[1:10:09] began to watch his brethren bow down
[1:10:11] to the shrine of money and popularity
[1:10:14] and like daniel he looked at his own
[1:10:16] people and he recognized something was
[1:10:18] bad wrong
[1:10:19] yeah you hear him talking about it as he
[1:10:21] approaches 19 and 56
[1:10:23] america is about ready to make the most
[1:10:25] crucial decision she's ever going to
[1:10:26] make
[1:10:27] listen at him in 1955 when the holy
[1:10:30] spirit starts meeting him
[1:10:31] and shows him in 1954 the vision about
[1:10:34] the great tent and fishing by the lake
[1:10:36] and the first and the second and the
[1:10:37] third pool you know the story
[1:10:39] yes the holy ghost deals with him about
[1:10:42] how that these gifts of god were only
[1:10:44] given to catch the attention of the
[1:10:46] elect of jesus christ
[1:10:49] and now brother begins to preach in 1955
[1:10:51] new ministry
[1:10:53] he goes right to mark 11 23 and 24
[1:10:56] about the spoken word by this time god
[1:10:58] has already shown in the squirrels and
[1:11:00] other things have taken place hattie
[1:11:02] wright's been on the radar
[1:11:03] all these other things are happening
[1:11:05] around him
[1:11:06] he's no longer just an evangelist with a
[1:11:08] tent ministry right
[1:11:10] with a healing revival oh glory yes
[1:11:13] but now something's beginning to stir
[1:11:16] now you think what you want to but
[1:11:17] brother baby said when gabriel announced
[1:11:19] the first coming
[1:11:20] he would announce the second coming and
[1:11:22] i submit to you
[1:11:23] is it possible that there was activity
[1:11:25] in another world
[1:11:27] that caused that little prophet of god
[1:11:28] to begin burdening in the first place
[1:11:32] maybe gabriel was doing some things in
[1:11:33] another dimension maybe the holy ghost
[1:11:35] was working in a certain way
[1:11:37] notice i said maybe maybe god was
[1:11:40] beginning to work in a way
[1:11:42] because remember a man cannot create
[1:11:44] that desire of himself
[1:11:46] it must be given to him by god
[1:11:50] yeah so you hear him talking
[1:11:54] he's laying up against the tree in
[1:11:55] october of 62 he's getting ready to
[1:11:57] preach statue of a perfect man
[1:11:59] he said i lean up against the tree he
[1:12:01] comes this way two plus two is four and
[1:12:02] faster and faster he said until the
[1:12:04] revelation opens up
[1:12:05] i sit there before daylight oh they talk
[1:12:08] about well
[1:12:09] you know brother brennan and the great
[1:12:10] things he's done in the healing revival
[1:12:12] but let me tell you something
[1:12:14] god called him to do the work of an
[1:12:15] evangelist and while he was under the
[1:12:18] ministry of that evangelist there was
[1:12:19] one angel of the lord that showed up in
[1:12:21] the platform
[1:12:22] but now all of a sudden he has a vision
[1:12:25] and in this vision brother jesse he
[1:12:27] doesn't see angel
[1:12:28] he sees angels now i'm here to ask you a
[1:12:31] question
[1:12:32] is that not what the bible told us jesus
[1:12:34] said would be here in the last day in
[1:12:35] the harvest the harvest wasn't the first
[1:12:37] stage that wasn't paul's age
[1:12:38] the harvest went down there with martin
[1:12:40] luther that was the beginning of a
[1:12:41] reformation
[1:12:42] any bible reader knows now is the
[1:12:44] hardest time
[1:12:46] now is the hour of the heart and here
[1:12:49] this little prophet of god's now seeing
[1:12:51] visions
[1:12:52] at first he can't make it out he tells
[1:12:54] us he sees five dubs
[1:12:56] he thought of it and then uh reproach
[1:12:58] for the cause of the word in 62 he tells
[1:13:00] us it was five angels
[1:13:01] it comes along a little further as the
[1:13:03] vision is beginning to make himself
[1:13:04] known listen this was not a perfect man
[1:13:06] that every time he had a vision he
[1:13:07] understood it right right
[1:13:09] he didn't no prophet understood every
[1:13:11] vision they said all right
[1:13:12] amen you think that isaiah understood
[1:13:14] what he was saying when he said a
[1:13:16] virgin shall conceive i wonder if he
[1:13:18] went back to his motel room and
[1:13:19] scratched his head so what i preached
[1:13:20] tonight
[1:13:24] they don't always understand everything
[1:13:26] right that's right human nature is
[1:13:28] that sometimes god will tell us things
[1:13:30] we don't always get it
[1:13:31] we don't always have the interpretation
[1:13:33] so brother adam as he studied this
[1:13:35] little trail of things how that god was
[1:13:37] opening up to him remember there was a
[1:13:39] prophecy given to him
[1:13:40] by vision of the lord that when the city
[1:13:42] drove that stake in front of his gated
[1:13:44] house
[1:13:45] turn yourself to the west all right i'd
[1:13:47] like to ask you where did billy graham
[1:13:49] have such words
[1:13:50] yes where did oral roberts have such a
[1:13:52] revelation right
[1:13:54] where did he allen or jack cole where
[1:13:55] did they have their visitations
[1:13:58] they were still concerned with healing
[1:14:00] ministry boy brother jack cohen died at
[1:14:02] 38 years old
[1:14:04] and and didn't have an opportunity hey
[1:14:06] allen went off the scene didn't have
[1:14:07] much of an opportunity
[1:14:08] but here you got the giants of the
[1:14:10] pentecostal revival of the ecumenical
[1:14:12] revival
[1:14:12] mr graham and mr roberts were those
[1:14:14] brothers at were they standing on the
[1:14:16] platform in california in 1977
[1:14:19] when billy graham had over ten thousand
[1:14:21] people or a hundred thousand people
[1:14:22] rather
[1:14:23] sat in this auditorium did he wave his
[1:14:25] hand out before them and say sirs what
[1:14:27] is the time
[1:14:29] they had their ministry yes it had
[1:14:31] nothing to do about the hour we're
[1:14:33] living in
[1:14:34] but here this little humble hillbilly
[1:14:36] from kentucky
[1:14:38] he sees this vision of the angels of the
[1:14:40] lord and now something is stirring glory
[1:14:42] to god i feel the holy ghost
[1:14:45] something is strong on the inside of him
[1:14:48] yes
[1:14:48] he wants to know what hour we living in
[1:14:52] i'll challenge you to do a little study
[1:14:53] sometime
[1:14:55] start before the opening of the seals
[1:14:57] and watch brother bram say
[1:14:58] angel angel angel of the lord angel of
[1:15:00] the lord angel the lord angel the lord
[1:15:01] and watch him after he has that vision
[1:15:03] all of a sudden it changes and now every
[1:15:05] time he talks about it angels of the
[1:15:06] lord angels of the lord angels of the
[1:15:08] lord
[1:15:08] angels of the lord don't you know what
[1:15:10] it was it was prophecy right before your
[1:15:11] eyes
[1:15:12] jesus said the angels would come in the
[1:15:16] last time not the angel of the lord
[1:15:18] angels that's what jesus prophesied
[1:15:21] would be here in the last day that's the
[1:15:24] reason why this doctrine is so attacked
[1:15:28] that's the reason why they fuss about
[1:15:29] whether he was there or what he wasn't
[1:15:30] there
[1:15:31] you have different accounts about
[1:15:33] different men saying well you know
[1:15:34] brother branham said he wasn't there
[1:15:36] i think it was brother george smith said
[1:15:38] he was in texas trying to get a boy
[1:15:39] pardon
[1:15:40] what in the devil's that got to do with
[1:15:41] the price of tea in china
[1:15:44] he had the vision and after the vision
[1:15:46] was had
[1:15:47] when it was produced in life magazine
[1:15:49] brother brown nabbed it up and showed it
[1:15:50] to the people and said this is what i've
[1:15:52] been talking to you about
[1:15:52] it don't matter why he was there he
[1:15:54] wasn't there and i don't care if they
[1:15:56] say
[1:15:56] well it does matter it doesn't matter
[1:15:58] the vision of the lord produced itself
[1:16:00] later what he'd been telling the people
[1:16:02] on the platform years before that
[1:16:03] amen amen i said oh i i missile created
[1:16:07] that all right fine you go on and
[1:16:09] believe what you want to believe
[1:16:10] but i believe what i want to believe how
[1:16:11] about that amen right
[1:16:14] yes amen people can have their own
[1:16:15] opinions but the reason i'm not saying
[1:16:17] that now i'm trying to take jabs at
[1:16:19] nobody
[1:16:20] i'm not trying to throw anything out
[1:16:21] there to take jazz what i'm trying to
[1:16:23] say to you tonight church and
[1:16:24] all those that may listen to this i'm
[1:16:26] trying to say these words to you
[1:16:28] that it was not a rocket ship it was not
[1:16:30] a smoke cloud made out there by some
[1:16:32] kind of mechanical device
[1:16:34] but it was the prophecy of matthew
[1:16:36] chapter 13
[1:16:37] that the angels of the lord would shut
[1:16:40] to settle out
[1:16:41] and gather in all of the saints of god
[1:16:43] and shove the wicked out to the
[1:16:44] outskirts
[1:16:46] they've done it the angels of the lord
[1:16:49] have
[1:16:49] power to separate
[1:16:52] amen amen they sure do
[1:16:55] i i love this even though they have
[1:16:58] power to separate us jesus said they
[1:17:00] would sever
[1:17:01] i love this in romans chapter 8 verse 38
[1:17:03] the one thing they cannot do

[1:17:45] last i checked that's exactly the same
[1:17:46] words paul referred to in first
[1:17:48] thessalonians chapter 4
[1:17:49] when he said that god would descend with
[1:17:51] a shout a voice and a trumpet
[1:17:53] and then the dead in christ shall rise
[1:17:55] those which are unseen those which are
[1:17:57] seen will be brought together to meet
[1:17:59] the lord
[1:18:00] in the air amen exactly the prophecy of
[1:18:03] the lord

[1:18:20] gospel dynamite before i dug into it huh
[1:18:22] amen at least got you a blast shield on
[1:18:24] or something huh
[1:18:25] now watch here he said when the son of
[1:18:27] man shall come forth in his glory and
[1:18:29] all the holy angels with him i know
[1:18:32] that's not
[1:18:33] seven i know that's more than seven
[1:18:36] i realize all means all i'm not going to
[1:18:39] debate little
[1:18:40] points of scripture like that but i want
[1:18:42] you to see something
[1:18:44] that these angels of the lord that
[1:18:46] visited us in sunset mountain
[1:18:48] that visited brother branham that
[1:18:50] somehow a voice of god
[1:18:51] spoke out of this constellation and let
[1:18:54] brother branham know the time of the
[1:18:55] opening of the seals has come
[1:18:59] that was an appearing of the lord in the
[1:19:00] form of these angels
[1:19:02] that would just like your hand on the
[1:19:03] wall and the shadow and you take your
[1:19:05] hand
[1:19:05] that shadow and you just keep moving
[1:19:07] until you put them both together
[1:19:09] that was one little spot to let us know
[1:19:11] that god was doing a work until we meet
[1:19:13] all of it over here to the other side
[1:19:16] it was an appearing of the lord to get
[1:19:19] us ready for the coming of the lord amen
[1:19:22] amen and it was the coming of the lord
[1:19:24] amen sure it was to me
[1:19:26] it was the coming of the lord amen
[1:19:29] whenever jesus met me
[1:19:30] it was his coming he come and i'm still
[1:19:34] waiting
[1:19:36] hello somebody you gotta understand
[1:19:40] everything god does is spiritual and
[1:19:41] natural
[1:19:42] the angels of the lord are called of god
[1:19:45] to gather in the elect from the four
[1:19:47] winds
[1:19:49] why do you all reckon that we had a
[1:19:50] message like we had what god sent him
[1:19:53] around the world seven times on my dad
[1:19:56] yes to do what purpose because this
[1:19:58] message will gather the elect of god in
[1:20:01] don't forget that the angels of the lord
[1:20:03] are commissioned to sever away
[1:20:04] anything that won't walk with it in the
[1:20:06] right way
[1:20:07] amen don't kid yourself brother these
[1:20:10] angels of god have been commissioned to
[1:20:12] create circumstances to push you out if
[1:20:14] you're not going to be honest with god
[1:20:16] right and you say they don't have that
[1:20:18] kind of power i wish you would have said
[1:20:20] as far as you know
[1:20:22] i'd like to prove something to you if
[1:20:23] you'll let me do it can i do it yeah all
[1:20:25] right look here in revelation chapter 7
[1:20:27] verse 1.
[1:20:28] the bible said after these things i saw
[1:20:30] four angels on the four
[1:20:32] corners of the earth holding the four
[1:20:33] winds of the earth
[1:20:36] and that the wind should not blow on the
[1:20:38] earth nor the sea
[1:20:39] nor on any tree and i saw another angel
[1:20:42] descending from the east having the seal
[1:20:43] of the living god
[1:20:44] and he cried with a loud voice to the
[1:20:46] four angels to whom it was given to hurt
[1:20:48] the earth
[1:20:48] and the sea now watch even john is
[1:20:50] declaring that these angels of the lord
[1:20:52] have the power to hold back the winds of
[1:20:54] war right
[1:20:56] right anybody ever study world war one
[1:20:59] the great war do you understand the
[1:21:01] reason that the world
[1:21:03] world's war stopped at that first world
[1:21:05] war and i've been there to flanders
[1:21:06] field
[1:21:06] where the germans and uh in belgium
[1:21:09] there we walked down through the
[1:21:10] trenches where
[1:21:11] them boys would sit there they could
[1:21:12] just barely climb to get up over that
[1:21:15] trench and
[1:21:15] the germans were shooting right across
[1:21:17] that river it was right there in the
[1:21:19] field where the poppies come up where
[1:21:20] them boys got killed out there in that
[1:21:22] first war
[1:21:23] and how we went out there and they
[1:21:25] showed us that little video you know was
[1:21:26] they doing them sites like that
[1:21:28] and they show the trenches and to the
[1:21:30] stories of how the
[1:21:31] trenches were filled up with blood plum
[1:21:32] up to the knees
[1:21:34] all the angels of the lord what i had to
[1:21:36] do was allow that war to continue and
[1:21:38] that had been the end of humankind as we
[1:21:40] know it
[1:21:41] but there was an angel of god given a
[1:21:43] commission by god
[1:21:45] on the 11th month of the 11th hour on
[1:21:46] the 11th day step out there and stop
[1:21:49] every bit of it because there were some
[1:21:51] sons and daughters of god that had not
[1:21:53] received the holy ghost yet
[1:21:55] and god could have not allowed that it
[1:21:57] could not allow the apocalypse to take
[1:21:58] place
[1:21:59] while there was still some names on that
[1:22:00] spiritual book of god
[1:22:03] the lamb's book of life so these angels
[1:22:05] had the power
[1:22:06] are you with me to hold back the winds
[1:22:09] of war to stop a world war
[1:22:11] at a moment's notice and you think that
[1:22:14] they don't have the power to take
[1:22:15] somebody that's on the fence in church
[1:22:17] and kick them off it
[1:22:19] you think they don't have the power to
[1:22:21] create circumstances that if you are on
[1:22:23] the fence
[1:22:24] to help you walk over that threshold and
[1:22:26] come over and be a real christian
[1:22:28] that's right sure there i believe the
[1:22:30] angels of the lord have enough power
[1:22:32] that they have created and stirred up
[1:22:34] circumstances that helped you become a
[1:22:36] christian
[1:22:39] same way i believe angels of the lord
[1:22:41] position things in a manner to help
[1:22:43] people find the other way the exit
[1:22:46] amen you found the entrance other people
[1:22:48] find the exit i believe the angels of
[1:22:50] the lord create them circumstances
[1:22:54] surely i'd like to ask you a question
[1:22:57] what was it at that pool of bethesda
[1:22:59] that caused him waters to stir up
[1:23:02] there's an angel of the lord right you
[1:23:04] know we don't even have a background as
[1:23:06] to why god even did that
[1:23:08] we read the scripture we don't even
[1:23:09] really know by the same what the purpose
[1:23:11] of all that was
[1:23:12] but we do know this much that an angel
[1:23:14] of god would stir those waters and when
[1:23:16] he did
[1:23:16] if you get in them waters at that time
[1:23:18] you'd be healed in your body
[1:23:20] history records they stabbed each other
[1:23:22] done all kinds of meanness and things
[1:23:24] trying to get in that water before
[1:23:25] somebody else angels of the lord had
[1:23:28] that kind of power as a servant to be
[1:23:30] able to deliver unto people divine
[1:23:31] healing by stirring up a bunch of water
[1:23:34] and you think they don't know how to
[1:23:35] take a backslidden mossback church
[1:23:37] member that's sitting on the fence and
[1:23:38] creating circumstances to run them out
[1:23:40] all right right right that's what i'm
[1:23:42] trying to tell you
[1:23:44] a lot of the reason why our churches
[1:23:46] aren't as full as they are now i realize
[1:23:47] to be completely transparent we have
[1:23:49] been our own worst enemy in this message
[1:23:51] we cannot blame the baptist for our
[1:23:52] problems
[1:23:53] all right come on preach to me now we
[1:23:55] can't blame pentecost for our problems
[1:23:57] our problems been created by us
[1:24:00] amen that's exactly right now i'm not
[1:24:01] going to make excuses for these bunch of
[1:24:03] backslidden hypocrites around the
[1:24:04] message that have
[1:24:05] run off with piano players and stole
[1:24:06] church funds and on and on and on
[1:24:08] but i will say that part of the reason
[1:24:10] why not everybody and their brother
[1:24:12] flocks to this message is the angels of
[1:24:14] the lord won't let them
[1:24:17] don't forget it was the angels of god in
[1:24:19] eden
[1:24:20] that stood at the gate
[1:24:26] amen that still happens today good
[1:24:30] sure does now i agree that there's no
[1:24:32] guard over the tree of life whosoever
[1:24:33] will let him come i agree with that
[1:24:36] but don't stop don't don't don't stop in
[1:24:38] your mind to consider
[1:24:39] don't even entertain the idea don't even
[1:24:41] entertain it
[1:24:42] that god ain't got guards to keep people
[1:24:44] away from those things
[1:24:46] if you're not willing to serve the lord
[1:24:48] and do the right things and be the right
[1:24:49] kind of christian god will have a way
[1:24:52] something will come along your pathway
[1:24:54] that'll be that'll be your waterloo
[1:24:56] amen amen god uses these angels to
[1:24:59] create these circumstances
[1:25:01] good yes now i realize of course that
[1:25:03] that many of the critics around the
[1:25:05] world that
[1:25:05] that hear us talk about brother branham
[1:25:07] and people that don't think that brother
[1:25:09] brown was all that important to us i'm
[1:25:10] sure
[1:25:11] when they hear this kind of a sermon
[1:25:12] they think what is the benefit of what
[1:25:14] i'm telling you well it's very simple
[1:25:16] not to continue to point you back to
[1:25:18] william branham for 60 years he's been
[1:25:20] gone now
[1:25:21] since 1965 here we are in 2020 but what
[1:25:24] i'm trying to tell you
[1:25:25] is that god did something in this
[1:25:27] generation by those angels of the lord
[1:25:29] appearing
[1:25:30] he was letting us know what hour we were
[1:25:32] living in
[1:25:34] this is the gathering time of the saints
[1:25:36] of god
[1:25:37] you say why do we need to gather because
[1:25:40] jesus said
[1:25:41] where the carcass is
[1:25:49] right praise the lord amen
[1:25:52] notice again in revelation chapter 9
[1:25:54] verse 14
[1:25:56] there was an angel that had a trumpet
[1:25:58] that was given the commission to loose
[1:26:00] the four angels bound in the river
[1:26:02] euphrates we understand what those
[1:26:03] angels were eichmann
[1:26:05] mussolini hitler and stalin
[1:26:08] this angel of god have the power to
[1:26:10] release those anointings
[1:26:12] they understand the reason god was doing
[1:26:14] this is because israel was backslid
[1:26:16] backslid as a jew was out of their
[1:26:18] nation they're out of the will of god
[1:26:21] right any jew out of their home
[1:26:22] countries backslidden
[1:26:24] no matter how nice a person or how much
[1:26:26] they practice sabbath or
[1:26:27] how much they obey certain commandments
[1:26:29] the moment they leave israel they're
[1:26:30] backslidden
[1:26:31] yes sir yes sir my mom was talking
[1:26:33] tonight about this fella that says he
[1:26:35] knows what tribe he's from i said how
[1:26:37] can he moses and elijah ain't here
[1:26:40] then then god's little children them
[1:26:43] little
[1:26:43] israelites had 144 thousands scattered
[1:26:45] in every which direction and they don't
[1:26:47] know what their background is they don't
[1:26:48] know what their tribe is
[1:26:51] god allowed four of the cruelest men
[1:26:53] that's ever stepped forth in history
[1:26:55] allowed that angel of god to loosen that
[1:26:58] anointing that would move on those four
[1:27:00] men
[1:27:01] and those men drove israel back into
[1:27:03] their homeland
[1:27:05] what was it the angels of god given
[1:27:07] power just as these fallen angels were
[1:27:09] given the ability
[1:27:10] to drive israel back in how did it all
[1:27:12] begin an angel of the lord
[1:27:14] visited and loose this anointing
[1:27:18] my think about it when you look at the
[1:27:22] prophecy that daniel gives here my
[1:27:25] as he begins to set an established in
[1:27:27] his heart
[1:27:29] what's going on lord yes he wanted to
[1:27:32] know
[1:27:33] his very desire created activity in
[1:27:36] heaven
[1:27:37] amen what do you think happens whenever
[1:27:39] you desire to know
[1:27:40] that activity is created amen
[1:27:44] but don't don't fool yourself be careful
[1:27:47] if you really want to know what's true
[1:27:50] sometimes it might cause a separation
[1:27:52] yes sir i was repeating myself to make
[1:27:55] that point
[1:27:57] sometimes it might cause a separation
[1:28:00] yeah if you really want to know what the
[1:28:02] truth is it may mean you have to say
[1:28:03] goodbye to your mother for the rest of
[1:28:04] your life
[1:28:06] you may have to separate from your
[1:28:07] family and your kindred
[1:28:09] husbands and wives may have to go their
[1:28:10] separate ways we don't know what the
[1:28:12] answers are all the time
[1:28:14] if the angel of the lord has been given
[1:28:16] commission to gather
[1:28:17] and to sever the message of the hour
[1:28:20] once the revelations made known to us
[1:28:22] it will also cause separation in our
[1:28:24] lives
[1:28:25] yes from anything that's unlike the word
[1:28:28] amen
[1:28:29] amen my praise the lord now notice again
[1:28:32] that i i like how
[1:28:36] i like how paul says this now we talk
[1:28:39] about a woman in holiness
[1:28:41] okay and we say that a woman
[1:28:44] has to have you know uncut hair we say
[1:28:47] long but
[1:28:48] long as the terminology we use and what
[1:28:50] we mean is uncut yeah
[1:28:52] and whenever we look at why
[1:28:55] that a man has to have short hair and a
[1:28:57] woman has to have long hair
[1:28:58] i was laughing at your brother last week
[1:29:00] i knew for a haircut and i said i hope
[1:29:02] to god you don't throw me out of the
[1:29:03] bullpen can we just kidding
[1:29:05] i i but i said you know i said i didn't
[1:29:08] like the rest of fairians when i had the
[1:29:10] opportunity to go to jamaica and i got
[1:29:12] down and they had that long dreadlock
[1:29:13] down the back of their head you know
[1:29:14] that really looked like a woman that way
[1:29:18] but there was a reason that god said
[1:29:20] that a woman shouldn't cut her hair
[1:29:21] would you like to know what it is
[1:29:22] yeah read with me here in in first
[1:29:24] corinthians chapter 11 verse 10.
[1:29:27] there's a reason that god wanted that
[1:29:29] woman to keep her hair uncut
[1:29:31] i've heard sisters of uh of different
[1:29:34] walks of life they said well
[1:29:35] one lady told me she said well if i
[1:29:37] don't cut it it won't grow
[1:29:39] i said if you cut it you won't grow
[1:29:41] either spiritually at all
[1:29:43] right right so you got to figure do you
[1:29:46] want
[1:29:47] you want a long flowing hair you want a
[1:29:49] soul prospered in the presence of god
[1:29:54] there's a woman that cuts her hair and a
[1:29:55] man that's got long hair
[1:29:57] their prayers don't get through the roof
[1:29:58] unless they're repenting
[1:30:01] exactly right you say why brother ben
[1:30:03] well i'm gonna tell you
[1:30:04] watch for this cause first time
[1:30:08] ought the woman to have power on her
[1:30:11] head
[1:30:13] because of the angels good good
[1:30:18] good so you realize that when isaiah
[1:30:21] sees the angels in the temple
[1:30:24] they have wings of their eyes wings over
[1:30:27] their feet wings on their back
[1:30:30] there's such a humility
[1:30:33] and service that when they come before
[1:30:36] the presence of god not only are they
[1:30:38] active that's what them wings on their
[1:30:40] back for that's what i said
[1:30:41] heaven is a metropolis it's not a bunch
[1:30:44] of people sitting in a barcelona with
[1:30:46] their feet kicked up taking the day off
[1:30:48] heaven is activity it's a busy place
[1:30:51] especially because you've got needs it
[1:30:53] keeps the angels busy all the time keeps
[1:30:55] god busy all the time
[1:30:58] but when an angel comes into the
[1:30:59] presence of the lord there is a level of
[1:31:02] humility it covers its face
[1:31:05] covers his feet and brother
[1:31:09] when paul's telling him that the woman's
[1:31:11] not supposed to cut her hair i'm not
[1:31:13] bashing sisters i'm just giving you a
[1:31:14] bible here
[1:31:15] yeah the reason they're not supposed to
[1:31:17] cut their hair
[1:31:18] is because of the angels in other words
[1:31:20] if you want to be
[1:31:21] humble have humility and show humility
[1:31:24] to the lord
[1:31:25] he said don't touch that hand don't put
[1:31:28] scissors in it
[1:31:30] don't trim it off we had girls number of
[1:31:32] years ago in manchester and i would
[1:31:34] grab it like this and rip it rip it rip
[1:31:36] it until they got all the dead ends out
[1:31:37] of it i said stop treating you glowy
[1:31:38] like that
[1:31:40] you have power on your head because of
[1:31:41] the angels did you notice he said you
[1:31:43] have power because of it
[1:31:45] which means that your prayer line to god
[1:31:48] all right
[1:31:49] right you can't go out here and cut the
[1:31:52] phone cord and then still be a quebec
[1:31:54] call right
[1:31:56] and some of y'all even know what a phone
[1:31:57] cord is don't change him
[1:31:59] and phone born in your life
[1:32:03] praise the lord but power on her head
[1:32:06] because of the angels
[1:32:07] because god amen was giving her a way to
[1:32:10] show
[1:32:11] her humility brother venom said it's
[1:32:13] god's crown of thorns today it's the
[1:32:15] crown of thorns for jesus
[1:32:17] when you wear that out there like that
[1:32:19] and people making fun of you and
[1:32:20] carrying on
[1:32:21] it's a crown of thorns for jesus christ
[1:32:23] in the last day
[1:32:24] now to show you that there's activity in
[1:32:26] heaven luke chapter 15 verse 10
[1:32:29] likewise i say unto you there is joy in
[1:32:32] the presence of the angels of god
[1:32:37] when over one sinner that repented amen
[1:32:41] so one sinner coming to god and it
[1:32:44] starts an angelic revival
[1:32:47] hallelujah they start having a worship
[1:32:50] session
[1:32:51] when they hear sinners come to god
[1:32:54] activity in heaven not a bunch of barca
[1:32:56] lounges and people sit around twiddling
[1:32:57] their thumbs no that's the way we behave
[1:32:59] in church
[1:33:02] let me tell you something brother sister
[1:33:05] if that's the way they behave over there
[1:33:07] and we should mirror image that over
[1:33:08] here
[1:33:11] we come to the house of the lord we
[1:33:12] should have some joy about us
[1:33:14] don't be afraid to move yes honest to
[1:33:18] goodness i've seen
[1:33:19] people in church it's almost like if
[1:33:20] they moved an inch god was going to kill
[1:33:22] him he's waiting on you too
[1:33:24] you should mirror him instead come on
[1:33:28] amen you should mere image the look of
[1:33:30] it sure
[1:33:31] yes amen now watch us now
[1:33:34] even at the death of the lord jesus
[1:33:36] christ now do you believe that the
[1:33:37] angels of the lord
[1:33:38] was going to keep charge over jesus you
[1:33:40] believe that yes psalm chapter 91
[1:33:42] 9 and 11 he said he'd give his angels
[1:33:44] charge over jesus
[1:33:46] and david said he would not allow his
[1:33:48] holy one to see corruption
[1:33:50] now to show you the power of the angels
[1:33:52] and the protection of the angels of the
[1:33:53] lord
[1:33:54] i want you to think about something here
[1:33:56] jesus's body is laying in the grave all
[1:33:58] right
[1:33:59] his soul is entered into the regions of
[1:34:00] the lost and he's down there taking
[1:34:02] satan's keys from his house
[1:34:04] right if one of them roman soldiers
[1:34:08] would have had corona
[1:34:10] and would they say that corona's got
[1:34:13] tentacles on the outside of it
[1:34:15] if one of them coronaviruses would have
[1:34:17] come even near the body of jesus christ
[1:34:20] the bible tells us in luke 24
[1:34:24] 23 and also tells us in john
[1:34:27] 20 and 12 that there were two angels
[1:34:30] standing by the body of jesus
[1:34:33] and satan would have tried to defile
[1:34:35] that holy body of jesus
[1:34:38] i believe one of them angels of the lord
[1:34:39] would have unsheathed their sword and
[1:34:40] cut the tentacles off corona
[1:34:42] all right his body could not be
[1:34:44] perverted
[1:34:45] his body could not be corrupted come on
[1:34:48] his body could not be
[1:34:50] molested in any way whatsoever there's
[1:34:52] no way that we could have been cannibals
[1:34:54] in ada's body
[1:34:55] all right the angels of the lord were
[1:34:57] set at the head in the pigs
[1:35:02] i'm going to ask you a question if you
[1:35:03] say well praise the lord it wasn't no
[1:35:05] cloud in arizona all right hold on
[1:35:09] when jesus appears on the earth for 40
[1:35:11] days
[1:35:12] he gets ready to go out of here he takes
[1:35:14] a bunch of them up to the hillside
[1:35:15] 500 of them to be exact and as jesus is
[1:35:18] beginning to stand on the hillside
[1:35:20] his body takes control over gravitation
[1:35:23] and he tells
[1:35:24] gravity i'm in charge now
[1:35:27] and like superman it's where they get
[1:35:29] these ideas from from the bible that's
[1:35:31] right
[1:35:31] he flies up into the heavens could you
[1:35:33] imagine this being 500 standing there
[1:35:34] watching jesus enter now what happens
[1:35:36] the bible says
[1:35:37] that the angels of the lord swept him
[1:35:39] out of the cloud
[1:35:41] he said the way he goes will be the way
[1:35:42] that he comes back
[1:35:44] what do we see what are we laying our
[1:35:46] eyes on what jesus prophesied
[1:35:48] that the angels of the lord hallelujah
[1:35:51] would appear again in the last day
[1:35:53] to do what revealed jesus christ
[1:35:56] and the coming of the lord the message
[1:35:58] of the hours to get us ready for the
[1:36:00] coming of the lord
[1:36:01] lutheran these guys didn't have this
[1:36:04] billy graham didn't have this
[1:36:05] amen well roberts didn't have this yes
[1:36:08] why is it beneficial for us
[1:36:09] because the scripture of what jesus
[1:36:11] prophesied would be here
[1:36:12] amen amen i like that
[1:36:16] now notice again oh praise the lord
[1:36:20] now you say do i have an angel well i'm
[1:36:22] glad you asked
[1:36:23] matthew chapter 18 verse 10 take heed
[1:36:25] that you despise not one of these little
[1:36:27] ones for i say unto you
[1:36:28] that in heaven their angels do always
[1:36:31] behold
[1:36:32] the face of my father which is in heaven
[1:36:36] so you've got somebody watching over you
[1:36:40] amen now if they've been given the power
[1:36:43] to settle and gather
[1:36:45] what do you all reckon happen sometimes
[1:36:47] whenever you should have made a left
[1:36:49] turn
[1:36:50] and somehow another you made a right
[1:36:51] turn
[1:36:53] you may not have it in your brain what's
[1:36:55] taking place but it might be that an
[1:36:57] angel of the lord saul
[1:36:58] there's trouble down that way and he
[1:37:01] just diverted your pathway down another
[1:37:03] direction
[1:37:04] oh you said it's ridiculous angels don't
[1:37:06] do things like that really ask balaam
[1:37:09] yeah uh-huh ask moses
[1:37:12] because you remember an angel of the
[1:37:13] lord was waiting to kill moses because
[1:37:15] he didn't circumcise gerson
[1:37:18] god permitted that little high-tempered
[1:37:20] wife of his to take a stone and hack him
[1:37:22] up
[1:37:22] and throw the foreskin down and said
[1:37:24] you're a bloody husband but an angel of
[1:37:25] the lord was waiting there to take moses
[1:37:27] life
[1:37:29] sure was remember that's why the donkey
[1:37:33] got mad
[1:37:34] or that balaam got mad at the donkey
[1:37:36] rather
[1:37:37] remember matter of fact he hit that old
[1:37:39] donkey
[1:37:40] yelled at him slapped at him cussed him
[1:37:42] probably or said a few choice words or
[1:37:44] some kind of thing he knows
[1:37:46] not knowing that that little animal was
[1:37:48] sensitive to the fact that the angel of
[1:37:49] god was waiting down there
[1:37:52] you remember the time of david that
[1:37:53] destruction was taking place on the
[1:37:55] earth
[1:37:56] and great wars and loss of life and
[1:37:58] there was an angel standing there with
[1:38:00] the
[1:38:00] threshers blade in his hand
[1:38:04] at that particular time you remember the
[1:38:06] holy spirit
[1:38:07] would come down he said in the form of
[1:38:09] an of an incorn
[1:38:10] to seal the servants of god now listen
[1:38:14] when your faith is acceptable to god
[1:38:17] he sends the angel of the lord down
[1:38:20] to seal your soul with the baptism of
[1:38:22] the holy ghost
[1:38:24] amen amen they deliver the holy ghost to
[1:38:26] you
[1:38:27] amen friends i wonder let me just use
[1:38:29] this as an example like this is an acorn
[1:38:31] i wonder how many times the holy ghost
[1:38:33] has come into our services
[1:38:34] and got almost ready to do something for
[1:38:36] somebody and they just had their
[1:38:37] attitude
[1:38:38] and they just took it back right
[1:38:41] i wonder how many times holy ghost went
[1:38:43] to go touch them with that in corn and
[1:38:44] seal them with the
[1:38:45] baptism the holy ghost but because of
[1:38:47] their attitude because of their faith or
[1:38:49] lack of the holy spirit just had to
[1:38:51] withdraw himself that angel of the lord
[1:38:53] could not usher in the need of that body
[1:38:57] simply because of that person that
[1:38:58] individual simply because their attitude
[1:39:00] was so rotten god couldn't do it
[1:39:03] you know why people aren't getting
[1:39:04] sealed by the holy ghost they're
[1:39:06] grieving the angel of the lord
[1:39:08] yes like i said when you come to church
[1:39:11] always be ready to say amen
[1:39:13] amen always be ready to participate
[1:39:16] don't be spectators be participators
[1:39:20] there's a difference because if the
[1:39:22] angel of the lord is here
[1:39:24] maybe tonight would be your night of
[1:39:26] great deliverance
[1:39:28] maybe god would want to deliver
[1:39:29] something unto you but when it comes to
[1:39:30] your pew you're half asleep
[1:39:33] you understand what i'm saying all right
[1:39:35] brother you got your mind on the taxes
[1:39:36] reminded some other kind of thing
[1:39:38] and instead of keeping your mind on the
[1:39:40] lord so god could do something for you
[1:39:42] oh god i wonder how many times have i
[1:39:44] grieved away the angel of the lord
[1:39:46] because i let my mind wander just a
[1:39:47] moment
[1:39:49] oh you say it can't happen hold on in a
[1:39:52] prayer line one time
[1:39:53] brother bottom said i was getting ready
[1:39:55] to call a man he was on crutches or
[1:39:56] something of that nature
[1:39:57] he said about the time i was going to
[1:39:59] call him you said a demon moved on him
[1:40:01] and convinced him to go to the bathroom
[1:40:03] he said that man missed his healing
[1:40:04] forever
[1:40:06] why the angel of the lord was in the
[1:40:08] camp to deliver healing
[1:40:10] you say do they do that you remember the
[1:40:12] story of the two women
[1:40:14] one of them come the prayer line had
[1:40:15] stomach trouble and the other one lived
[1:40:16] down the road or down the blonde next
[1:40:18] block or something from the other lady
[1:40:19] she had a cancer
[1:40:21] it said that morning she woke up and
[1:40:22] she's fellow hungry
[1:40:24] so she got her cup of coffee and
[1:40:26] scrambled a few eggs and
[1:40:27] ate that and drank that and that tasted
[1:40:29] pretty good turns out well
[1:40:30] that's all right so she made some bacon
[1:40:32] fried up some sausage maybe some
[1:40:34] done some grits or some other kind of
[1:40:36] thing you know and just had a good
[1:40:37] old-fashioned jubilee and she'd
[1:40:39] dawned on her i'm healed i'm healed she
[1:40:41] got up to run down the road to her
[1:40:43] friend down the road to tell her what
[1:40:44] the lord had done for her and she was
[1:40:45] over there shaking her sheet trying to
[1:40:47] find that cancer that had fallen off of
[1:40:48] her
[1:40:49] brother said what happened was the angel
[1:40:51] of the lord was passing through that
[1:40:52] neighborhood
[1:40:54] and brought healing to both of them amen
[1:40:57] yes sir i wonder how many times i've
[1:40:59] come into a church like this
[1:41:01] and find that your attitude is not that
[1:41:03] you're with the word you're not even
[1:41:04] interested in the bible interested in
[1:41:06] the message
[1:41:06] not even interested in god i wonder how
[1:41:08] many times the angel of the lord has
[1:41:10] taken note of that
[1:41:11] and created circumstances to drive you
[1:41:13] away from the house of god
[1:41:14] rather than drive you to it
[1:41:18] oh you say god don't do that really you
[1:41:20] should read the book of proverbs every
[1:41:21] now and then
[1:41:22] and just remind yourself of what god
[1:41:24] said he would do if you reject him too
[1:41:25] many times
[1:41:26] he said he would come back and laugh at
[1:41:27] your calamity
[1:41:29] we can only reject him so many times
[1:41:31] before he creates a circumstance to send
[1:41:33] us
[1:41:33] out right you say does the lord do it
[1:41:36] sure look at judas
[1:41:38] whenever he said a man that is the one
[1:41:40] that's going to betray me
[1:41:41] will dip his hand in the soft with me
[1:41:43] jesus give him an opportunity i'm giving
[1:41:45] you this the spot
[1:41:46] if you want a spot here's the cube as
[1:41:50] they dipped his hand on that sock all
[1:41:51] them disciples is it me is it me is it
[1:41:53] you is it me is it you
[1:41:54] and there's judah sitting right there
[1:41:56] the bible said suffer being ended
[1:41:58] and satan entered into the heart of
[1:41:59] judas and what did jesus say to him
[1:42:01] whatever you're going to do go do it
[1:42:02] quickly
[1:42:04] creating circumstances that's why you
[1:42:06] and i sitting here tonight
[1:42:08] if there's even a tinge or a touch of
[1:42:09] the holy ghost inside of you or me
[1:42:11] we ought to be the thankful most
[1:42:12] thankful person
[1:42:14] hallelujah we ought to be so grateful to
[1:42:17] god
[1:42:17] because it could be the exit instead of
[1:42:19] the entrance
[1:42:22] amen lord praise the lord
[1:42:26] notice in luke 16 22 that when the
[1:42:28] beggar died
[1:42:30] he was carried by the angels to
[1:42:31] abraham's bosom
[1:42:33] but the bible said the rich man also
[1:42:35] died and was buried
[1:42:37] where was his angels
[1:42:40] he didn't have no angels he'd already
[1:42:41] rejected god remember this night your
[1:42:43] soul is required of you
[1:42:45] because he rejected the lord he rejected
[1:42:48] everything that come with the lord
[1:42:50] don't fear little bride that hour is
[1:42:52] going to arrive maybe you'll come to
[1:42:53] death
[1:42:54] and the angels of the lord will be there
[1:42:56] to pack your soul across that river
[1:42:58] don't you worry
[1:42:59] don't you worry they'll be there with
[1:43:01] you they was with you in your birth
[1:43:02] they'll be with you in your death
[1:43:04] i always felt sorry in a way for poor
[1:43:06] little lazarus
[1:43:09] here the man had been dead four days and
[1:43:11] entered into a spiritual round you know
[1:43:12] he was one of the only ones that could
[1:43:13] have come back and told us what life
[1:43:15] looked like after death but
[1:43:17] he had a good revelation of it and here
[1:43:20] elijah's i always felt sorry for the
[1:43:22] poor
[1:43:22] fella because i wonder when he'd come up
[1:43:24] to that second go around
[1:43:25] and maybe all of a sudden he realized
[1:43:27] death was coming and he said oh here we
[1:43:28] go again
[1:43:34] i mean a man in that kind of condition
[1:43:36] he couldn't be afraid of it because he
[1:43:37] knows what the beyond was holding for
[1:43:39] yeah
[1:43:41] but the bible said the angels packed him
[1:43:43] away
[1:43:44] wonder if when it come time for him to
[1:43:45] die the second time around the angel
[1:43:47] said
[1:43:47] are you ready to go again
[1:43:50] amen you know the drill lazarus come on
[1:43:55] amen oh praise the lord
[1:43:58] that's right and notice that the spirit
[1:44:00] of god with the acorn in his hand
[1:44:02] is there to seal the servants of god
[1:44:05] brother bannon i'm closing just now but
[1:44:07] brother bannon was in his room one time
[1:44:09] praying and he started praying in german
[1:44:12] remember that
[1:44:13] he got up and opened up the door and
[1:44:15] looked down the hallway he thought was
[1:44:16] somebody else speaking that happened a
[1:44:17] couple times he realized it was him
[1:44:20] that night there was a girl that had
[1:44:21] hammers on the side of the road out
[1:44:23] there
[1:44:24] and and she was just cutting up in the
[1:44:26] back and they run a mic
[1:44:27] out back there to her you know years ago
[1:44:29] they'd have them hundreds of hundreds of
[1:44:31] foot cord and they could run them around
[1:44:33] and uh i know brother ernest fulcher
[1:44:34] used to preach with a hundred foot court
[1:44:36] and go all the way around the tent two
[1:44:37] or three times come back up so they
[1:44:39] run her might back there she was just to
[1:44:41] testify and brother i said now wait a
[1:44:43] minute so what time of day was that
[1:44:45] he said the very moment that i was
[1:44:47] praying in that german language that she
[1:44:48] was laying out there dying
[1:44:50] listen in his words he said let's
[1:44:52] perfect perhaps that her angel
[1:44:55] come to me asking for help
[1:44:59] let me tell you something brother if you
[1:45:01] wake up in the middle of the night and
[1:45:02] i'm on your heart
[1:45:04] don't ignore that perhaps
[1:45:07] my angel come to you asking for some
[1:45:09] help
[1:45:11] you say does that happen in the bible in
[1:45:13] romans chapter 8 the bible said
[1:45:14] that we will speak with utterance and
[1:45:16] groanings that we don't even understand
[1:45:18] ourselves
[1:45:18] and the spirit of god will intercede for
[1:45:21] us
[1:45:23] amen perhaps your angel would call me
[1:45:25] one night
[1:45:26] say hey pray for my buddy you need some
[1:45:29] help
[1:45:30] don't ever forsake the moves of god
[1:45:33] because you don't know what's behind it
[1:45:35] in another realm
[1:45:37] when daniel sees the angel closing now
[1:45:40] when he sees this angel gabriel show up
[1:45:42] it's his desire in his heart created
[1:45:45] that activity over there
[1:45:48] i've said this in a joking manner i
[1:45:49] don't mean to sound like i'm joking in
[1:45:51] the pulpit but
[1:45:52] i i i wondered when brother brown was
[1:45:55] walking up that road and the
[1:45:56] lord told him to throw up the rock i've
[1:45:59] often wondered if the
[1:46:00] story was only partially told that if
[1:46:02] maybe what the real story was
[1:46:04] perhaps them seven angels were sitting
[1:46:06] over there waiting for a cue
[1:46:09] god told them there's a certain time
[1:46:11] that you've got to break forth
[1:46:12] maybe he would say to them watch for
[1:46:14] that prophet to throw that rock in here
[1:46:15] that's your cue to take off
[1:46:18] we don't know why god does things but
[1:46:20] what i'm trying to tell you is when you
[1:46:22] set your heart to understand
[1:46:23] it creates activity in the dimension
[1:46:26] in another realm yeah
[1:46:30] notice mine in saint john chapter 1 51
[1:46:34] he said unto him very very i say
[1:46:36] hereafter you shall see heaven open
[1:46:39] and angels ascending and descending upon
[1:46:42] the son of man
[1:46:44] we wonder ourself why would jesus even
[1:46:47] speak of such a thing that's an old
[1:46:49] testament doctrine
[1:46:51] but let me show you how naive we are
[1:46:53] sometimes
[1:46:54] i don't think we mean to be but we are
[1:46:57] here
[1:46:57] all the saints of god having a prayer
[1:46:59] meeting in the house when simon peter
[1:47:01] got locked up
[1:47:03] and while they're praying for god to
[1:47:05] release peter from prison
[1:47:07] the angel of the lord comes into the
[1:47:09] prison house you ever been to walmart
[1:47:11] and seen them doors go
[1:47:14] well there's peter when he's sitting in
[1:47:15] that prison house the angel lord comes
[1:47:17] in there he got these guards all around
[1:47:18] everything
[1:47:19] and angela just walked over and done
[1:47:20] that with them doors for peter
[1:47:24] peter walked right on out of the gate
[1:47:26] all right now here's the crazy thing
[1:47:28] he gets all the way up to the house
[1:47:30] where they're praying for peter
[1:47:32] and there's peter knocking at the door
[1:47:33] and they got scared to death thinking a
[1:47:35] ghost and showed up at their doorstep
[1:47:37] but remember when they prayed and asked
[1:47:40] god it created activity in that realm
[1:47:42] and before they even realized what they
[1:47:44] were doing the angel of the lord had
[1:47:45] already released peter
[1:47:47] right out of that prison cell remember
[1:47:50] what i told you this morning
[1:47:51] just because you don't feel the holy
[1:47:53] spirit when you're praying doesn't mean
[1:47:55] that there's not a recording angel
[1:47:58] taking your order
[1:47:59] amen because remember matthew 4 11 when
[1:48:02] he said
[1:48:02] angels minister that means as a person
[1:48:04] would wait on a table
[1:48:06] serving food and drink brother jesse one
[1:48:09] thing i've learned in my life and if
[1:48:10] i've learned anything i've learned this
[1:48:13] god is always paying attention
[1:48:16] to me those moments i think he ain't
[1:48:19] those moments he's overlooking or
[1:48:21] maybe he's off on a far journey like
[1:48:23] elijah told the band of mines
[1:48:25] he's not he knows the very end from the
[1:48:28] beginning he understands what me and you
[1:48:29] are all about
[1:48:31] that's why these angels of the lord have
[1:48:32] been commissioned to work with us and
[1:48:33] deal with us in the way they have
[1:48:35] so that we understand glory to god that
[1:48:38] his love and his grace surrounds us
[1:48:40] every day of our life
[1:48:41] amen amen amen oh praise the lord
[1:48:45] and i love this so much
[1:48:49] it's worthy do you realize the prophet
[1:48:53] said
[1:48:54] those angels could have stepped forward
[1:48:55] and said i am
[1:48:58] they were worthy yeah they wasn't born
[1:49:01] by sex desire they wasn't born in sin
[1:49:03] shaken iniquity
[1:49:04] they could have stepped forward and said
[1:49:06] i'm the worthy one you know why they
[1:49:08] didn't move
[1:49:09] because the book that was in question
[1:49:13] did not belong to angels it belonged to
[1:49:16] sons and daughters of god
[1:49:19] amen no matter what their worthiness
[1:49:22] might have been it wasn't their
[1:49:23] inheritance
[1:49:25] and whenever we come to that hour that
[1:49:27] we are a true overcomer clothed in white
[1:49:29] raiment
[1:49:30] jesus christ will take us before them
[1:49:32] holy angels and say
[1:49:34] these are the ones i was asking for
[1:49:37] when this book was spoken about the
[1:49:38] first time amen
[1:49:40] the lion had prevailed but here's the
[1:49:43] purchased possession
[1:49:44] of what i was asking about during the
[1:49:47] opening of the seals
[1:49:49] please god stand with me
[1:49:53] can you say praise the lord amen isn't
[1:49:56] it wonderful
[1:49:58] isn't it wonderful isn't it ame
[1:50:01] isn't it wonderful to be a christian
[1:50:02] american amen
[1:50:05] i'm looking for some activity now
[1:50:08] yes think about it
[1:50:11] brother baby said they don't go off on
[1:50:12] missions way out yonder he said that
[1:50:14] camp right here
[1:50:16] around the saints of god that means if
[1:50:19] you're having a
[1:50:20] bad day the angels of the lord know
[1:50:23] what's going on
[1:50:24] and they're carrying messages back to
[1:50:26] daddy
[1:50:28] you say do they well let's look at
[1:50:30] adoption for 10 seconds
[1:50:32] brother madam said that if your behavior
[1:50:34] is right
[1:50:36] somehow they get a message did you know
[1:50:39] what your son or daughter is doing but
[1:50:40] the brain said the angels of the lord
[1:50:41] did it
[1:50:43] he said do you know what she's doing
[1:50:44] she's doing oh he's a chip off the old
[1:50:46] block
[1:50:47] so just swells right out that's my boy
[1:50:49] that's my girl
[1:50:50] these angels of the lord are confessing
[1:50:52] they're witnessing back to god
[1:50:54] about your behavior on the earth
[1:50:56] remember them investigating angels
[1:50:58] investigated the earth for the purpose
[1:50:59] of judgment
[1:51:01] but some of these angels of god that are
[1:51:02] here and gathered around the elect today
[1:51:04] they're investigating your
[1:51:06] behavior to brag on you
[1:51:10] it makes me feel like i speak in german
[1:51:11] myself amen and i don't even know
[1:51:15] i think about how that the holy spirit
[1:51:17] then if he surrounds us like that
[1:51:20] and these angels of god are given
[1:51:21] reports who was it that told god that
[1:51:24] adam had fallen in the garden of eden
[1:51:26] the angels of the lord gave the report
[1:51:28] to him
[1:51:30] do you understand that the very same
[1:51:32] thing happens with you and i
[1:51:35] whenever we have a a problem let's just
[1:51:38] say it like this somebody just
[1:51:40] really lays you out you're too upset to
[1:51:43] pray
[1:51:44] you can't get the words out of your
[1:51:46] mouth you the standard stutter standard
[1:51:48] and stare
[1:51:49] but don't fear the angels of the lord
[1:51:52] have already taken the report back to
[1:51:54] papa
[1:51:55] they already know the circumstances they
[1:51:58] already know the situation
[1:52:00] and before you even had a chance to pray
[1:52:02] about it before you could compose
[1:52:04] yourself enough to even ask daddy about
[1:52:06] it
[1:52:07] angels of god had already sent the
[1:52:08] message off
[1:52:10] started helping my boy jesse yeah start
[1:52:12] helping my buddy
[1:52:13] start helping my sis start do something
[1:52:16] move on their behalf
[1:52:18] i want to tell you something that
[1:52:19] happened to me when i was a boy and this
[1:52:21] may not mean nothing to y'all but it did
[1:52:23] to me at the time
[1:52:24] when i was in school i was bullied
[1:52:26] terribly
[1:52:28] and i mean i was a pudgy little kid and
[1:52:31] and i wasn't athletic i'm a musician i'm
[1:52:33] not an athlete
[1:52:35] let me tell you something you could
[1:52:36] throw a football but i didn't play a
[1:52:37] piano
[1:52:38] [Laughter]
[1:52:40] oh i just throw it off but what i'm
[1:52:42] trying to say is
[1:52:43] i was never like athletic and these type
[1:52:45] of guys i mean i i participated in
[1:52:47] things and did okay when i did but i
[1:52:49] wasn't an athlete
[1:52:51] and i was bullied terribly and you know
[1:52:52] i i was just really really upset
[1:52:55] tore up in my spirit one day and i was
[1:52:58] sitting at the desk in school
[1:52:59] now you're all young and you meant do
[1:53:01] you know what bazooka candy of gum is
[1:53:03] bazooka
[1:53:04] you all know what bazooka is don't you
[1:53:06] it's got the little comic strips on the
[1:53:07] inside
[1:53:09] well i was sitting at one of the chairs
[1:53:11] like this and i had turned around and i
[1:53:13] was just sitting there kind of staring
[1:53:14] off and thinking about
[1:53:16] all the little bad things that had
[1:53:17] happened and how the scourge upset i was
[1:53:20] and i felt my arm brother jesse move
[1:53:22] like that
[1:53:23] underneath the desk i didn't move it i
[1:53:25] just felt it moved
[1:53:26] and when i arm moved like that i felt my
[1:53:28] fingers go like that
[1:53:30] when i did i fingered one of those
[1:53:32] papers sticking underneath one of the
[1:53:33] little
[1:53:33] metal pieces underneath the table
[1:53:35] somebody slid it in between one of them
[1:53:36] little
[1:53:37] spots and i just pulled it out like that
[1:53:39] and
[1:53:40] this may not mean nothing to me but when
[1:53:42] i pick that little bazooka wrapper up i
[1:53:44] was thinking god are you with me god do
[1:53:46] you even care
[1:53:47] god are you even paying attention and
[1:53:48] when i pick that little wrapper up and
[1:53:50] said stop worrying
[1:53:51] i've got angels surrounding you
[1:53:55] let me tell you something friend that
[1:53:56] may not mean nothing to you but god does
[1:53:57] things
[1:53:59] to let us know he's with us all the time
[1:54:02] he's with these pretty little girls he's
[1:54:04] with these little ones right here
[1:54:06] he's with the oldest amongst us the
[1:54:08] youngest emotions the middle age
[1:54:10] female white black red asian whatever
[1:54:13] your colors whatever your race whatever
[1:54:15] your background
[1:54:16] whatever your stream of life he watches
[1:54:19] every single one of us
[1:54:20] we are his children amen and he loves us
[1:54:23] from the bottom of his heart and he
[1:54:24] wants our good
[1:54:25] not our hurt
[1:54:29] he sends these angels of god to protect
[1:54:31] us
[1:54:33] what do you think it was that led you to
[1:54:35] the house of god oh you say daddy took
[1:54:37] me what do you think led daddy
[1:54:39] just keep chasing it back what they what
[1:54:42] do you think it was made a way for it to
[1:54:44] be an entrance not an exit
[1:54:46] the spirit of god sent angels of the
[1:54:48] lord to gather
[1:54:49] and to sever i guarantee you one thing
[1:54:53] i've seen it many times in services let
[1:54:56] somebody
[1:54:57] in the presence of the lord in the house
[1:54:59] of the lord
[1:55:00] let him get a little bit of an attitude
[1:55:02] i've seen it
[1:55:04] let them kindly not appreciate the
[1:55:06] services and appreciate the preacher or
[1:55:09] what's being said or whatever whatever
[1:55:12] and it's another i mean it's happens
[1:55:14] almost like clockwork
[1:55:16] it don't take no time at all things
[1:55:17] start happening
[1:55:19] events start happening in that person's
[1:55:20] life and we're not careful we have a
[1:55:23] tendency to judge that and say
[1:55:24] oh boy that god's getting them you don't
[1:55:26] know that
[1:55:28] maybe the angels of the lord were taking
[1:55:30] notice that they were not going to
[1:55:31] continue to serve god
[1:55:32] and by the authority that god invested
[1:55:34] in them started creating circumstances
[1:55:36] to give them an exit strategy
[1:55:39] this is why when we pray and we ask god
[1:55:41] to restore those what we should pray
[1:55:43] on top of that restoration is god if
[1:55:46] they're the ones that chose to go out
[1:55:48] give them a desire to choose to come
[1:55:50] back
[1:55:52] because if they're the ones that created
[1:55:54] this mess and they put themselves in a
[1:55:55] position
[1:55:56] where they didn't want to serve the lord
[1:55:57] i can't force them back into it
[1:56:00] we can reach out to him brother jesse we
[1:56:02] can talk with them we can
[1:56:04] put scriptures together we can show love
[1:56:06] we can show grace
[1:56:08] but at the end of the day if god's given
[1:56:09] an exit strategy
[1:56:11] there's nothing we can do to recover
[1:56:12] such things is that right i've watched
[1:56:14] it happen again and again in my ministry
[1:56:16] and and i i mean just my ministry just
[1:56:19] my preaching i've watched it happen
[1:56:21] in services i've conducted and been in
[1:56:23] service watch the holy ghost walk
[1:56:25] right up to a person's pew and almost
[1:56:26] grab them by the arm and pull them to
[1:56:28] the altar nearly look like
[1:56:29] a little expression come over their face
[1:56:31] or a little something happen
[1:56:32] all of a sudden that person in a month
[1:56:34] and things are happening one after that
[1:56:36] like
[1:56:36] lighting fireworks and then popping this
[1:56:38] thing that thing next thing you know
[1:56:39] what happened to so-and-so oh you didn't
[1:56:41] hear they quit
[1:56:43] but you know what's happening friends
[1:56:45] the angels of god are taking notes
[1:56:47] yes they'll gather some severe the rest
[1:56:51] yes sir god help us amen
[1:56:54] this is why brother brown said we ain't
