[0:02] is it possible for a holy ghost filled
[0:05] person to be influenced or do my minor
[0:09] things that he doesn't want to do oh yes
[0:12] yes sir yeah a holy ghost filled person
[0:14] you're right in the place then to be to
[0:17] be drove for these
[0:19] things greetings friends in the
[0:21] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:24] the purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:26] viewer's question how far can Christians
[0:28] fall into sin
[0:30] this is an excellent question one I've
[0:32] had myself over the years one brother
[0:35] brandham dealt with also numerous people
[0:38] in our church have asked me about it as
[0:39] well so I thought I'd make a video on
[0:41] this so by the grace of God my short
[0:43] simple summary is that there's four
[0:46] classes of Believers as brother bandam
[0:48] taught us through the scripture and each
[0:50] class can commit a different degree of
[0:53] sin of course the High Calling of God is
[0:56] being a holy ghost filled Saint or the
[0:58] highest class of believer is a wise
[1:00] virgin according to Jesus's Parable
[1:03] Matthew 25 1-13 so the wise virgin will
[1:06] be able to overcome all major sins by
[1:08] the grace of God and that's a
[1:10] terminology brother random uses major
[1:12] sins and minor sins the next class is
[1:14] the foolish virgin they're saved and
[1:17] have some level of sanctification but
[1:19] their souls are not filled with the
[1:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost and each
[1:22] foolish virgin has a different level of
[1:24] sanctification and so they'll fall into
[1:27] worse sins than the wise Virgin by the
[1:30] grace of God and of course I'll show all
[1:32] this through the scriptures the Holy
[1:33] Bible the King James version the next
[1:36] class is the make believer group this is
[1:38] the Judas escar group recently I put out
[1:41] a video about the 13 metaphors the Bible
[1:43] gives for the Judas escar group so of
[1:46] course a genuinely saved Christian
[1:48] either wise virgin or foolish virgin
[1:51] will never fall away like the degree of
[1:54] sin that Judas a scarit committed he
[1:56] basically failed the grace of God the
[1:58] Bible says he transgressed
[2:00] and he forsook Jesus Christ he sold out
[2:02] Jesus Christ in other words he
[2:04] blasphemed the Holy Ghost and he lost
[2:06] his salvation a real Christian will
[2:08] never stoop to that level of sin they'll
[2:10] never fall into that level of sin then
[2:13] of course you have the unbeliever group
[2:14] like Pharaoh during the days of Moses
[2:17] and of course there are so many other
[2:18] Bible examples these people never
[2:20] believed to begin with they never were
[2:22] Justified to begin with their names were
[2:24] never on The Book of Life as brother R
[2:26] teaches in the church age book so I want
[2:28] to start with the viewer's question he
[2:30] wrote quote the thing is I have battled
[2:32] so many things in my life since then
[2:34] many victories but yet I made so many
[2:36] mistakes sometimes I question how can I
[2:38] have the spirit of God in Me and make so
[2:40] many mistakes can a Believer have God's
[2:42] spirit and still fall into sin surely
[2:45] this is not possible end
[2:48] quote so this is a wonderful honest
[2:50] sincere question I can certainly relate
[2:53] to this and I know any believer can I
[2:55] know brother brandom could because
[2:57] remember I shared this quote on my
[2:58] channel not long ago there's a quote
[3:00] where brother Ram says many times I
[3:01] don't even feel saved but yet by faith
[3:04] he was saved so brother Ram would get
[3:06] into the flesh as we all do and there
[3:09] would be times he said many times he
[3:11] didn't feel saved let's listen to that
[3:13] quote right God's word has made way
[3:16] you're not saved because you feel like
[3:18] you're saved I'm not saved because I
[3:21] feel like I'm saved because a lot of
[3:22] times I don't feel that
[3:24] way but I'm saved because God gave the
[3:28] promise
[3:30] I met God's conditions enough own God's
[3:33] holy word I can defeat Satan seven days
[3:37] in a week and as many
[3:39] nights because it's God's
[3:42] word Now by God's grace We Believe
[3:44] brother brandham was a holy ghost filled
[3:46] Saint a wise virgin just like we believe
[3:48] St Paul and St Peter were filled with
[3:49] the Holy Ghost I'll be using these three
[3:51] men as my main examples for this video
[3:54] No Doubt brother Brandon was filled with
[3:55] the Holy Ghost but he said he made
[3:57] thousands of mistakes in a year but yet
[3:59] he always always confessed his
[4:01] sins brother Bram said he sinned every
[4:03] day he said Believers sin every
[4:07] day and so real Believers will confess
[4:09] their sins every day as Jesus gave us
[4:12] the model prayer The Lord's Prayer
[4:13] forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
[4:16] those who trespass against us so by
[4:19] God's grace let's get into these classes
[4:21] of Believers and of course we'll use the
[4:23] Bible to answer this question because
[4:24] the Bible is our absolute as brother
[4:26] brandom said the Bible was his absolute
[4:28] the tapes are not our absolute the tapes
[4:31] point us to the absolute the absolute is
[4:32] the Bible it's Jesus Christ it's the
[4:35] Holy Ghost and the Bible says prove all
[4:37] things and brother R repeated that prove
[4:39] all things test me by the word and every
[4:42] Bible Doctrine must run from Genesis to
[4:44] Revelation as brother R taught us and as
[4:46] St Paul told us in Galatians chapter 1
[4:48] we can't add to the gospel nor take away
[4:50] we don't want to be cursed We Believe
[4:52] the full Bible Revelation by the grace
[4:54] of God so let's start with wise virgins
[4:58] These Are Holy Ghost filled Saints their
[4:59] souls are sealed with the Holy Ghost
[5:01] unto the day of redemption according to
[5:03] Ephesians 4:30 Ephesians 1:13 according
[5:07] to Matthew 11:29 Jesus said I came to
[5:10] give you rest to your souls so this
[5:12] proves the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[5:13] in the soul of the believer of course we
[5:16] can feel the Holy Ghost on our body and
[5:17] in our minds but the New Testament is
[5:19] all about the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[5:21] in the soul the soul is the nature of
[5:24] the person the deepest most innermost
[5:26] part of their being and that's what
[5:28] Jesus came to do he came to give us the
[5:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul
[5:31] the rest in the soul the Jews already
[5:33] had the rest on the Sabbath and Jesus
[5:35] said I come to give you rest to your
[5:37] souls so I'm going to take my Bible here
[5:39] and begin with 1 Corinthians 6 and then
[5:41] go to Galatians 5 I want to show the
[5:43] difference between major sins and minor
[5:45] sins actually I'll just start here in
[5:47] Galatians 5 since my Bible's already
[5:49] open to it so Paul describes the works
[5:52] of the Flesh in Galatians 5 19 through
[5:55] 26 he said they are adultery fornication
[5:58] uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry
[6:01] witchcraft hatred variance emulation
[6:03] wrath Strife seditions heresies envyings
[6:06] murders drunkenness reings and such like
[6:09] of the which I tell you before as I have
[6:12] also told you in time past they which do
[6:14] such things shall not inherit the
[6:16] kingdom of God so here's a list of major
[6:18] sins people that commit these sins
[6:21] cannot inherit the kingdom of God unless
[6:23] they repent and of course the kingdom of
[6:25] God is mysterious as the Bible calls it
[6:28] it's the mystery which was hid from ages
[6:30] but now revealed unto you Christ in you
[6:32] the hope of glory according to
[6:34] Colossians 1
[6:35] 27-29 and then Jesus also says the
[6:38] kingdom of God is within you in Luke 17
[6:41] so that's a great mystery and that's
[6:43] what we understand here in Paul's
[6:45] writings they will not inherit the
[6:46] kingdom of God these people will not
[6:48] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[6:50] because of the works of the flesh so I
[6:53] believe these are the major sins that
[6:55] Holy Ghost filled people will not commit
[6:57] now of course Holy Ghost filled Saints
[6:59] will will battle minor forms of these
[7:01] for example tempted by sexual thoughts
[7:04] immoral thoughts tempted to have anger
[7:07] and hatred toward people tempted to
[7:10] commit sedition or Strife against
[7:12] another brother but in each time the
[7:14] Holy Ghost will deliver the individual
[7:16] as brother brandom said he said if I
[7:18] went overseas and I made a mistake with
[7:20] a woman he said I know my wife would
[7:22] forgive me he said but of course my
[7:24] comforter would keep me from doing that
[7:26] so the Holy Ghost keeps us from doing
[7:28] these major sins let's listen to that
[7:30] quote but looking at my wife sitting
[7:33] here if I would go out here today and
[7:36] throw my arms around some other woman
[7:39] and and make love to
[7:42] her and I'd uh know then after I did
[7:45] that that I was wrong so wrong of course
[7:49] my comforter would keep me from doing
[7:51] that see see but I mean if I if I did
[7:55] that and I it happened that I did it or
[7:57] anything similar to it and then back in
[8:00] Galatians 5:22 we see the fruit of the
[8:02] spirit here's what the Holy Ghost filled
[8:03] Christian manifests love joy peace
[8:06] longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith
[8:08] meekness Temperance and then notice they
[8:11] crucify the flesh with the affections
[8:13] and lusts because they walk in the
[8:16] spirit according to Galatians 5
[8:19] 23-26 and then if you turn to 1
[8:22] Corinthians 6 we see a similar list from
[8:24] St Paul in chapter 6:
[8:27] 9-1 no not that the unrighteous shall
[8:30] not inherit the kingdom of God and of
[8:32] course this kingdom of God means the
[8:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus said the
[8:35] kingdom of God is within you be not
[8:37] deceived neither fornicators nor
[8:39] idolators nor adulterers nor feminite
[8:41] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[8:44] nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards
[8:46] nor revilers nor extortioners shall
[8:48] inherit the kingdom of God so here's a
[8:49] list of major sins that Holy Ghost
[8:51] filled Saints will not commit because
[8:53] they already have the kingdom of God in
[8:55] their souls I love verse 11 though this
[8:57] shows that Holy Ghost filled Saints used
[8:59] to commit these but they don't because
[9:01] now they're born again and such were
[9:03] some of you but you are washed but
[9:05] you're Sanctified so see there's the
[9:06] first two steps of Grace justification
[9:09] and sanctification and that's what
[9:10] cleans out your life from these major
[9:12] sins you're Justified and then you get
[9:14] Sanctified but you are washed you are
[9:16] Sanctified but ye are justified in the
[9:18] name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[9:20] of God so I believe those two portions
[9:22] of scriptures show the major sins Holy
[9:25] Ghost filled Saints will not commit and
[9:27] Friends remember brother Ram talks about
[9:29] terminology of major sins versus minor
[9:31] sins among Christians he talks about
[9:33] this in 1961 they asked him can a holy
[9:36] ghost pH person be influenced to do
[9:38] minor things and of course he says yes
[9:40] and he makes the point where Holy Ghost
[9:42] filed Christians will not commit major
[9:44] sins let's listen to the quote is it
[9:47] possible for a holy ghost filled person
[9:49] to be driven by
[9:52] the driven by the to do minor things
[9:58] influenced or do my minor things that he
[10:01] doesn't want to do oh yes yes sir yeah a
[10:05] holy ghost filled person you're ring a
[10:07] place then to be to be drove by these
[10:10] things you just put yourself up a Target
[10:13] when you're down there serving the devil
[10:14] he just lets you slash around any you
[10:16] want to but you want take a stand for
[10:17] Christ you've got on the other side then
[10:20] he trains every gun right around on you
[10:22] every Temptation everything that can be
[10:24] thrown to you then you got it but what
[10:25] have you got greater is he that's in you
[10:28] than he that's in the world
[10:30] see now you wasn't in no battle here you
[10:32] just slopping along see but now you you
[10:35] cleaned up you've dressed up You' shaved
[10:37] you combed your hair you put on a
[10:39] uniform you got a gun in your hand let's
[10:41] go see you're in battle not to show off
[10:43] but to fight fight sure when The
[10:46] Temptations rise with the spirit The
[10:48] Shield of Faith Buck it off and move on
[10:51] see that's right or put on the whole
[10:52] armor of God why you put on Armor if
[10:54] you're not going to fight all soldiers
[10:56] are dressed to fight not to show off
[10:59] walk and say I'm so and so now I'm a
[11:01] Christian you see who I am I belong to
[11:03] so and so Hallelujah I got the Holy
[11:05] Ghost the other night sure nothing
[11:07] bothers me anymore uhuh brother I
[11:11] believe you better go back and try again
[11:13] see well I'm telling you when as soon as
[11:15] you say you got the Holy Ghost Satan's
[11:17] got every gun right on you shooting then
[11:19] you got the whole armor on then take the
[11:21] shield of Faith the sword of the spirit
[11:23] of the word and take the Buckle along
[11:25] the Sha yourself with the gospel and
[11:28] take the old a middle piece the
[11:30] breastplate and pull up the Cinch on it
[11:33] and tighten yourself up a little bit and
[11:34] get ready boy cuz it's a coming don't
[11:36] you worry yes sir you're going to have
[11:38] plenty of trouble but remember greater
[11:40] is he that's in you than he that's in
[11:42] the
[11:42] world now I want to continue looking at
[11:45] the wise virgin and I just have numerous
[11:47] thoughts in here and I'll try to share
[11:48] them from the scripture let's begin with
[11:50] Romans 7 Paul says he could do things
[11:53] that he hated and yet we know he was a
[11:55] holy ghost filled Saint we know the book
[11:56] of Acts that he got the Holy Ghost
[11:58] shortly after he was baptized in water
[12:00] now Paul doesn't give us the specifics
[12:02] of what sins he committed but he did say
[12:04] that he did things he hated but then I
[12:07] love he makes the differentiation he
[12:08] said it's not I that sin it's not my
[12:11] soul that sins because his soul had the
[12:13] Holy Ghost the soul was filled with the
[12:14] Holy Ghost he said it's the sin that
[12:16] dwelleth within me but the sin was still
[12:18] committed inside of his body so he had
[12:20] to confess his sins now there's numerous
[12:23] quotes from Brother brandom on the
[12:24] subject of complexes but that's what I
[12:26] believe will be the main sin the main
[12:28] minor sin that a holy ghost filled
[12:30] believer commits will be sins of
[12:32] complexes or mental mind battles that
[12:34] they have a difficulty overcoming that's
[12:37] found in 2 Corinthians 10: 4 and 5 the
[12:40] Bible says for the weapons of our
[12:42] Warfare are not carnal But Mighty
[12:44] through God to the pulling down of
[12:46] strongholds so that stronghold means a
[12:48] castle brother Ram talked about how we
[12:50] would build complexes in our minds
[12:52] another words we give the enemy a place
[12:54] in our minds as Ephesians 4 says the
[12:57] Bible says neither give place place to
[12:59] the devil but of course in our minds
[13:00] sometimes we give heed to evil thoughts
[13:03] and if we don't confess it right away
[13:04] and overcome it and pray about it it
[13:06] becomes a complex so we have this mental
[13:08] state where the enem is battling us in
[13:11] our minds and every time a certain
[13:13] subject comes up we have a negative
[13:14] response to it we feel bad about it or
[13:16] maybe we have hurt feelings towards
[13:18] someone but Paul says the word of God is
[13:21] mighty to pull down these strongholds to
[13:23] help us overcome our complexes by the
[13:25] grace of God now we see some of these
[13:27] complexes battling believer in the New
[13:29] Testament like Paul saying I did things
[13:31] that I hated in Romans 7 another great
[13:33] example is in the book of Acts where
[13:35] Paul and Barnabas had a dispute between
[13:37] them about Mark and so they separated
[13:40] ways of course later Mark turned out to
[13:42] be a good helper and Paul accepted
[13:45] Mark's help later on in life but at that
[13:47] moment there in the book of Acts there
[13:49] was such a dispute between Paul and
[13:51] Barnabas that they couldn't Minister
[13:52] together they separated ways so we see
[13:54] Holy Ghost filled people can have
[13:56] disputes and it will cause them to
[13:58] separate yet they're still born again
[14:00] one of the best examples is in Galatians
[14:03] 21-14 Paul came and told Peter he was to
[14:07] be blamed to his face there in galatia
[14:10] and the Bible said it was fear that
[14:13] Peter allowed to cause him and Barnabas
[14:15] to separate themselves from the Gentiles
[14:17] so here we see the sin of Pride the sin
[14:20] of fear coming on Peter and barnabus
[14:23] where they wouldn't even associate with
[14:25] Gentiles so here we see an example for
[14:27] us in the modern day of segregation
[14:30] racial segregation and this fear caused
[14:32] the Holy Ghost filled Saints to separate
[14:34] themselves from other Saints and they
[14:37] actually influenced others the Bible
[14:39] said the Bible said in so much that
[14:41] Barnabas also was carried away with
[14:42] their dissimulation so Peter's sin
[14:46] caused Barnabas to sin and others all
[14:48] because of the fear of the Jews so this
[14:51] proves Holy Ghost filled Saints can get
[14:52] a complex of fear and they will be
[14:55] blamed for the effects or influence of
[14:57] their sin but thank God God is rich in
[14:59] Mercy thank God 1 John 1 says if we
[15:02] confess our sins he's faithful and just
[15:05] to cleanse us from all
[15:06] unrighteousness now in that same chapter
[15:08] Galatians Chapter 2 Paul says if I build
[15:11] again the things which I destroyed I
[15:13] make myself a
[15:15] transgressor that was in Galatians 21:18
[15:17] so Paul again separates the wise virgin
[15:20] from the foolish virgin wise virgins
[15:22] will not build again what they've
[15:24] already destroyed the sins they've
[15:25] already overcome they will not go back
[15:27] into them to the same degree CU Paul
[15:29] said if you did that in verse 21
[15:31] Galatians 2:21 you'd frustrate the grace
[15:33] of God and wise virgins will not
[15:35] frustrate the grace of God they will not
[15:37] fail the grace of God they will not do
[15:40] despite unto the spirit of God now I
[15:42] want to look at some examples from
[15:44] Brother brandom's life we know he was
[15:45] born again of the Holy Ghost in the soul
[15:48] in the days of brother brandham no one
[15:49] lived closer to God than brother
[15:51] brandham not Billy Graham not or Roberts
[15:53] he was the wise virgin for his day no
[15:56] one labored for Christ like brother
[15:58] brandom labored but he still battled the
[16:00] sin nature inside of him you'll know
[16:02] also you remember if you've listen to
[16:03] brother brandham he lied to the
[16:08] IRS so we see a holy ghost filled
[16:10] Christian out of busyness or being
[16:12] exhausted or worn out he said he was so
[16:14] busy he felt like his head was spinning
[16:15] he lied to his wife to lie to the IRS
[16:18] but then he quickly repented by the
[16:20] grace of God so we see how the Lord is
[16:22] faithful and bringing his children to
[16:24] repentance for their sins there's a
[16:26] quote from 1947 brother random said he
[16:28] walked in balam's shoes because at the
[16:30] beginning of his ministry his National
[16:33] Ministry of healing and discernment he
[16:35] challenged people to bring the hardest
[16:36] cases the miracle cases first in the
[16:38] prayer line and he said he did that for
[16:40] a number of months until the angel Lord
[16:42] corrected
[16:45] him so this proves a holy ghost filled
[16:47] Saint can be out of the will of God for
[16:49] a few months at least by God's grace
[16:52] until the Lord brings correction and
[16:54] then another simple example is again
[16:56] seeing brother Brandon battled the
[16:57] critical spirit so I I believe this is
[16:58] the pride of life he battled it all
[17:01] throughout his ministry recently I put
[17:03] out the video about brother Ram said he
[17:04] was haunted by the critical spirit so
[17:07] I'll leave a link to that video in the
[17:08] description and then we see it it
[17:10] resurfaced later in standing in the Gap
[17:13] 1963 brother Rand said he lost the
[17:15] feeling for the people and he had these
[17:17] plans he was going to move up into the
[17:19] Colorado mountains with his wife and
[17:20] just live up there and not be amongst
[17:22] the churches anymore because they
[17:24] wouldn't hear his message every time he
[17:26] went and preached to the women there was
[17:27] more women that cut the their hair more
[17:29] women that wore makeup and he was
[17:30] getting discouraged he said I'll just
[17:32] move up there but the angel of the Lord
[17:34] corrected brother brandom he said if you
[17:36] do that your wife will leave you and
[17:37] brother Ram said well I thought I was a
[17:39] prophet and Prophets live out by
[17:41] themselves and only stomp down with thus
[17:42] sayi the Lord then go back out into
[17:44] isolation and the angel Lord corrected
[17:46] him and said you're an Apostolic Prophet
[17:48] with many gifts and of course if you
[17:50] look in the Bible St Paul never isolated
[17:52] himself away from anyone other than his
[17:55] one trip to the desert to get the
[17:56] Revelation but after that he was was
[17:58] constantly amongst the churches three
[18:00] major missionary Journeys and then he
[18:03] would visit the churches that they
[18:04] started and confirm them and make sure
[18:07] they were established in the faith just
[18:08] like brother brandham did Brother Bram
[18:10] never isolated himself away from the
[18:12] True Churches or the fivefold ministry
[18:14] he supported the five-fold ministry
[18:16] brother brandom always went to church
[18:18] brother brandom always dealt honestly
[18:20] and sincerely and humbly with the
[18:22] pastors if you've listened to brother
[18:23] brandom even when he would have special
[18:25] meetings he would schedule them on
[18:26] Sunday between the morning and evening
[18:28] service so he wouldn't take away people
[18:30] from their post of Duty or their home
[18:32] church that's how much brother brandham
[18:34] respected the five full ministry Now by
[18:37] God's grace let's get into the foolish
[18:38] virgin examples
[18:41] here now in Galatians 3:1 Paul plainly
[18:44] tells the Galatians they're foolish
[18:46] because they've allowed legalism back in
[18:48] to the faith so anytime Christians bring
[18:51] legalism in it proves they're not born
[18:54] again and then he said in Galatians 4:19
[18:57] he said my Little Children of whom I
[18:59] travail and birth again until Christ be
[19:01] formed in you so he's saying that he
[19:03] believes they're probably not born again
[19:05] he says I have to travail in birth again
[19:08] I've got to labor with you I've got to
[19:09] preach with you I've got to pray you
[19:11] through again to make sure you're born
[19:13] again and that proves a born again
[19:15] Christian will not bring in heresies or
[19:17] seditions or Strife as we already read
[19:20] in Galatians 5 and 1 Corinthians 6
[19:23] another example is the Corinthian Church
[19:26] in 1 Corinthians 5 there's a man
[19:28] sleeping with his stepmother and Paul
[19:30] said the church wasn't even mourning so
[19:32] this proves a lot of the people in the
[19:34] church were probably not born again and
[19:36] in 1 Corinthians 5:11 Paul called this
[19:38] man a brother but Paul told them deliver
[19:40] him to Satan that his soul might be
[19:42] saved now we never see any Holy Ghost
[19:45] filled Saint being delivered to Satan
[19:47] that his soul might be saved it's only
[19:49] These Foolish virgins who are committing
[19:51] these major sins like in this case
[19:54] fornication and this also brings a
[19:56] thought about how much sexual sin can a
[19:58] Christian commit so a holy ghost filled
[20:00] Christian will not commit any sexual sin
[20:03] he or she might have mind battles like
[20:05] brother Ram said he had to put up a
[20:06] cross in his car he said I've had the
[20:08] Holy Ghost for years but he said when a
[20:10] holy ghost filled man any healthy man
[20:13] sees an immorally dressed woman
[20:15] something passes over him so he had to
[20:16] put a cross in his car to keep his eyes
[20:19] focused on the word of God but some
[20:21] people try to say because David
[20:23] committed adultery Christians can commit
[20:25] adultery and still have the baptism of
[20:27] the Holy Ghost in the soul but they
[20:29] failed to recognize that was under the
[20:30] old Covenant where they didn't have the
[20:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul
[20:34] that's according to John 737 through 39
[20:37] the Holy Ghost could not be given until
[20:39] Jesus was glorified so in the Old
[20:41] Testament David couldn't have the power
[20:43] of the Holy Ghost in his soul he only
[20:45] had it in his mind so this brother who's
[20:48] committing fornication in 1 Corinthians
[20:50] 5 he was called a brother so that means
[20:53] he was probably baptized and he was
[20:55] probably just Justified and he hadn't
[20:57] gone through the sanctification stage
[20:58] yet so he's definitely a still a foolish
[21:01] virgin now one thing about the
[21:02] Corinthian Church if you read the book
[21:04] of second Corinthians they help this
[21:06] brother repent and Paul said he was glad
[21:08] they repented and then he says they were
[21:11] Chase virgins to Christ and that's in 2
[21:14] Corinthians 11:2 for I've espoused you
[21:16] to one husband that I may present you as
[21:18] a Chase virgin to Christ so when someone
[21:20] gets saved they're clean they're
[21:22] forgiven they're a Chase virgin to
[21:24] Christ when they get saved they're a
[21:25] foolish virgin right they're virgin to
[21:27] the word of God but they've got to go on
[21:29] and get Sanctified and then filled with
[21:30] the Holy Ghost when they're filled with
[21:32] the Holy Ghost they won't commit these
[21:34] sins like this brother did committing
[21:36] fornication with his
[21:38] stepmother now I want to make a few
[21:40] important points here before I finish
[21:41] the video by the grace of
[21:43] God the first point is that sometimes we
[21:46] can't know whether a person is born
[21:48] again or not so we can't know sometimes
[21:51] if they're wise virgin or foolish virgin
[21:53] there's one quote where brother ramam
[21:54] says I can know within a few minutes
[21:56] when talking to a man if he's born born
[21:58] again or not but then there's another
[21:59] quote that says you'll never be able to
[22:01] know so I couldn't find the quote where
[22:03] he said I can know just in a few minutes
[22:05] but I did find the quote where he says
[22:07] you can't know and that that's a 1954
[22:10] questions and answers part one brother
[22:12] Bram said there's not a way in the world
[22:14] for you to know it there's not a way in
[22:16] the world for you to know it God is the
[22:18] judge we are not to judge let's listen
[22:20] to the quote brother gr I want to know
[22:24] the place where I can tie down and say
[22:26] this man has the Holy Ghost because did
[22:28] this or this woman has the Holy Ghost
[22:29] because she did that there's not a way
[22:31] in the world for you to know
[22:33] it right there's not a way in the world
[22:36] you know God is the judge we are not the
[22:40] judge let's preach the
[22:43] gospel so because of that a second point
[22:46] is you and I must make our calling and
[22:49] election sure Peter said make your
[22:51] calling and election sure and think
[22:52] about that Peter the man who had denied
[22:55] Christ the man who had told Jesus he
[22:57] didn't have to go to the cross the man
[22:59] who had allowed fear to cause him to
[23:01] segregate himself away from the Gentiles
[23:04] that man said make your calling election
[23:05] sure in other words confess all your
[23:08] mistakes and keep pressing toward the
[23:10] mark of the High Calling of God in
[23:11] Christ Jesus Paul also said in 1
[23:14] Corinthians 9 that he had to beat his
[23:16] body and bring it under subjection so he
[23:19] himself would not be a Castaway he would
[23:21] not be a Judas and so we get that
[23:23] understanding that as Believers we need
[23:25] to make our calling and election sure we
[23:27] need to bring our bodies into subjection
[23:29] we must not continue in sin that Grace
[23:32] would abound as Paul said we've got to
[23:34] take up our cross daily and follow Jesus
[23:37] Christ so we don't fall into sin and
[23:40] brother Bram supports this as well
[23:41] brother Bram said there's no way for us
[23:43] to prove our names are on the Lamb's
[23:45] Book of Life he said God could use us as
[23:47] a tool for anything he said but by faith
[23:49] we believe that let's listen to the
[23:51] quote now we don't know you say brother
[23:55] random can you prove that you're there
[23:57] no sir I cannot prove it God could use
[24:01] me for a tool of something else he use
[24:03] you the same way but I believe and by
[24:06] faith I am saved not by knowledge I'm
[24:09] saved by faith that's way you're saved
[24:12] that's way we're all saved another point
[24:15] is I want to share just a story one of
[24:17] the Believers told me and this believer
[24:20] is from another church that they had a
[24:21] holy ghost filled Saint a Man Who Loved
[24:23] God for his entire life but then at the
[24:26] end of his life he had Alzheimer's or
[24:27] something disease where he lost his
[24:29] memory and he was in a nursing home and
[24:31] he started cussing and
[24:32] swearing and the brother asked me what I
[24:34] thought and I said well I don't know I
[24:37] just know that if his Spirit was
[24:38] breaking up or if he lost his mind then
[24:40] of course he wouldn't be able to control
[24:42] his mind anymore he was losing his mind
[24:45] so I believed God would not hold that
[24:47] person accountable for that if they had
[24:48] a disease like Alzheimer's and they lost
[24:51] their mind the Bible said a man who
[24:54] can't control his mind is like a a city
[24:56] Without Walls and of course in this in
[24:57] this case the disease has caused the man
[24:59] to not be able to control his mind so I
[25:01] believe that person could have been
[25:03] filled with the Holy Ghost no doubt in
[25:04] their soul but then this disease caused
[25:07] them to lose their mind lose control of
[25:09] their mind now that's just my thought
[25:11] I'm open to correction on that by God's
[25:12] grace I've never seen that myself but I
[25:15] was just told about that particular
[25:16] story so I thought I'd share
[25:18] that next I believe within the three
[25:21] areas of sin pride of life lust of the
[25:24] eyes and lust of the flesh Believers can
[25:27] have a battle in one of those areas and
[25:29] the battle will be harder than the other
[25:31] areas so what I mean by that as brother
[25:33] Bram said some men and women can be high
[25:36] passion so they'll battle sexual
[25:37] Temptations more than
[25:40] others and then some people will battle
[25:42] the pride of life more than others I've
[25:44] seen that there's a certain group of
[25:46] message preachers that call themselves
[25:47] the greatest of all time sometimes they
[25:49] say there's no great ones among us then
[25:51] they'll go back to saying today's young
[25:53] people are the greatest young people
[25:54] ever or I'm among some of the greatest
[25:56] most powerful men on the the entire face
[25:58] of the Earth and so they go back and
[26:00] forth from being humble and then being
[26:02] prideful this shows just as brother
[26:03] brandom battled the critical spirit
[26:05] that's the pride of life some of these
[26:07] preachers also battle the pride of life
[26:10] exalting themselves as the greatest of
[26:11] all time one thing to notti as well
[26:13] Jesus's own disciples argued who was the
[26:15] greatest of all time but that was before
[26:17] they were born again that was before
[26:19] Acts 2 and the day of Pentecost that's
[26:21] why I say some of these preachers if
[26:23] they're calling themselves the greatest
[26:24] of all time perhaps they're not born
[26:26] again only time will tell by God's grace
[26:29] a tree is known by its fruit another
[26:31] point I want to make is that brother
[26:33] brandom again said the Holy Ghost would
[26:35] keep him from sexual sin actually
[26:37] committing the literal Act of sexual sin
[26:39] I referenced the quote earlier where
[26:41] brother brandom said my comforter would
[26:42] keep me from cheating on my wife if that
[26:45] would ever happen and thank God of
[26:47] course it never happened to brother
[26:48] brandom but I want to make this point
[26:50] again because one time I was in a
[26:51] ministers meeting with some ministers
[26:53] and a man who was not a minister
[26:54] confessed that he had committed adultery
[26:57] and I told him I said brother I don't
[26:58] think you're born again because of this
[27:00] quote from Brother brandham my comforter
[27:02] would keep me from that there were some
[27:03] other ministers there and they said well
[27:06] I think you can be born again just got
[27:07] to confess your sins now we just agreed
[27:09] to disagree in the meeting it was very
[27:11] kind meeting but then years later this
[27:13] man fell away from the message he
[27:15] doesn't even go to church anymore his
[27:17] wife cuts her hair wears pants yoga
[27:20] pants I'm told I've never seen it makeup
[27:22] all these things that his children have
[27:23] grown up and they don't serve God the
[27:25] girls cut their hair wear makeup and so
[27:27] forth so I believe time has proved that
[27:29] by God's grace I was right on that topic
[27:32] just like brother Brandon was trying to
[27:33] say if I have the Holy Ghost it will
[27:35] keep me from committing literal acts of
[27:37] sexual sin that's what the comforter is
[27:39] there for the comforter is there for
[27:41] power Jesus said you'll have power to be
[27:43] a witness when the Holy Ghost comes upon
[27:45] you and the last point I want to make is
[27:47] sometimes there are some uncertain
[27:48] situations things we don't quite know
[27:50] about for example in the book of Acts
[27:52] they had to pray and anoint deacons
[27:55] because there was a problem amongst the
[27:57] people they were neglecting the widows
[27:59] and so here we see the sin of neglect
[28:01] this would probably be the pride of life
[28:03] I would imagine because food was not
[28:06] being given to a certain group of people
[28:07] based upon their nationality so the
[28:09] question is can Holy Ghost filled Saints
[28:11] neglect others I don't know were they
[28:14] born again those that were neglecting I
[28:15] don't know Acts chapter 2 said the souls
[28:18] were added to the kingdom of God so we
[28:20] don't know if that means just Justified
[28:22] or some were filled with the Holy Ghost
[28:24] we don't know for sure but we know Acts
[28:26] 2:4 says they were filled with the Holy
[28:27] Ghost so the 120 were filled with the
[28:29] Holy Ghost but we don't know about the
[28:31] 3,000 and the last thing I'll say is
[28:33] something that helped some brothers
[28:35] recently when I preached down in
[28:36] Junction City brother brandom said no
[28:38] matter where you are with God you got to
[28:39] put a stake down when God does something
[28:41] in your life or you have a great
[28:42] testimony or God gives you some type of
[28:44] victory in your life you got to put a
[28:45] stake down because Satan will try to
[28:47] come to that point of your life and say
[28:49] that never happened or you're not what
[28:51] you claim to be you're not a holy ghost
[28:53] filled Saint you're not saved so you got
[28:56] to be able to put a stake down down and
[28:57] say no I know God did something there I
[29:00] know God led me to repentance I know God
[29:02] gave me power there I know God gave me
[29:04] the Holy Ghost there so you got to have
[29:06] experiences in your life where you know
[29:08] God did something God changed you you
[29:10] had a book of act experience you had
[29:12] your own day of Pentecost Holy Ghost
[29:13] experience you've got to put a stake
[29:15] down and stand upon the promise of God
[29:16] at some point friends we can't live in
[29:19] guilt we can't live in defeat we have to
[29:20] remember if we confess our sins we are
[29:22] instantly forgiven it's tossed in the
[29:24] sea of God's forgetfulness we have to
[29:26] confess our sins move on get our first
[29:29] love back our first Zeal back to serve
[29:31] the Lord Jesus Christ we must do the
[29:33] first works as Jesus said in Revelation
[29:35] chap 2 and I love what brother random
[29:38] said I'm not where I want to be I'm not
[29:40] what I ought to be but thank God I'm not
[29:42] what I used to be we see what God has
[29:44] done in our lives we thank God for the
[29:46] progress or the land we've possessed in
[29:48] our spiritual Promised Land but we must
[29:50] possess more by the grace of God brother
[29:52] brandom said I'll keep this what I have
[29:54] now until something greater comes and
[29:56] that's great advice for all of us thank
[29:58] God for what Christ has done in my life
[30:00] to this point and I'm going to keep this
[30:02] until greater things come by the grace
[30:04] of God in
[30:06] closing friends I hope this video has
[30:08] been a blessing by the grace of God of
[30:09] course much more could be said maybe
[30:11] I'll do a part two on this depending on
[30:13] the comments and the questions and the
[30:14] feedback I'm always open to correction
[30:16] by the grace of God but friends let's
[30:18] daily confess our sins let's press on
[30:20] toward the mark of the High Calling of
[30:22] God in Christ Jesus let's cast down all
[30:24] strongholds all complexes let's live
[30:27] clean before the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:29] empowered by the Holy Spirit to crucify
[30:32] the lust and the affections thereof and
[30:34] let's remember greater is he that's in
[30:36] us than he that's in the world if you
[30:38] have any questions concerns or
[30:40] testimonies about this video please
[30:41] contact
[30:43] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[30:46] the desire of your
