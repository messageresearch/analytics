TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is coming into that third Flor amen I'm believing this and I want to ask you a sincere question you that pass through the prayer line can you actually believe and feel now that there is something happened in you since you've had hand fade on your L Hall there he is this is what we waited for now this is not this is just starting to bloom now see just started I did this for a purpose I did this for a purpose I'm working out something taking this charge of faith and going right back to it again and come in see to kind of raise faith in a bracket where you never noticed it that way before not a faith but a perfect Faith Build It Up in your and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by perfect words which is sharper than a 28 sword and thoughts of the heart amen what we're coming out to the Perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the Rapture amen that's what's holding away right now is waiting for that church to come in to that perfect Rapture in faith looking for it means a lot of Shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God [Music] am but what about the true seed it will happen just as we have said the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the Lord it is thus saith the Lord for that is what Joel to 23- 26 says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust have eaten the canker worms and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran age did not restore the church it started a Reformation the Wesleyan age did not restore the Pentecostal age did not restore but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resur direction of the church it is the restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning now notice in verse 25 it tells why we need restoration the Locust cankerworm caterpillar and Palmer worm have eaten all but the root and a small bit of the stem now we are told that all these insects are all one and the same in different stages that is right they are the Antichrist spirit manifested in organization denomination and false Doctrine Through the Ages and that poor little root and stock is going to be restored God isn't going to plant a new church but is going to bring his original planting back to Original Seed he is doing it as started in verse 23 by the teaching or former rain next will come the Harvest rain or rapturing faith so now I am going to say something to you now that I haven't said all along that is the thing that we have looked forward to for so long or at least many years four five years or maybe longer the third pull has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is now remember it the never be an impersonation of that because it can't be it cannot be now it's inexistent and I have I am warned of this that soon right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this Council begins to tighten up and when it does when that does the Pentecostals and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power now I must continue in evangelism just as I was commissioned first I must continue on therefore you've had the word and you know what to look for how to stand I must continue on in evangelism and friends of mine keep still and just keep moving on for the hour is approaching swiftly see that when something is going to be done now you might see some little odd things happen for me nothing sinful I don't mean that but I mean something odd to what the regular Trend because where I reached to now in the ministry I'm dropping back here watching that spot and waiting for the time to use it but it's going to be used and everyone knows that for as certain as the first was identified so has the second been identified and if you'll think real closely you who are spiritual as the Bible said here's the him that has wisdom the third is properly identified we know where it is so the third pull is here it is so sacred that I mustn't say much about it as he told me in the beginning said this say nothing of it you remember that years ago it speaks for itself but to I've tried to explain the others and I made a mistake this will be the thing that to my opinion I don't say the Lord tells me this this will be the thing that'll start the Rapture in faith for the going away and I must lay quiet for just a little while now remember and who's listening this tape you might see such a change in my ministry right away dropping back not going up dropping back we're right at the edge now and it can't be can't go any further we have to wait just a minute until this happens over here to catch up then the time comes but it's thoroughly identified there's coming a Time upon in this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the Beast had before it which was Pagan Rome when it become Papa Rome that's this nation will do that Revelations 13 plainly explains it the lamb come up out of the Earth the other beasts come up out of water thickness and multitudes of people this lamb come up where there was no people a lamb represents uh religion uh the Lamb of God and remember it spoke like a lamb it was a lamb and then after a while it be received power and spoke like a dragon and exercis all the the dragon power the dragon had before him and the dragon is Rome always so don't you see Roman denomination a mark Protestant denomination uh image unto the beast making a power that'll force all Protestants like a union you'll have to be into this Council of churches or you won't be able to have fellowship or to well it's it's practically that way now you can't go to a church and preach L you have a fellowship card or some identification and now on Persons like ourselves we're going to be cut out of all that altoe that's exactly because they won't be able to do it it's tightening and then when that time comes and the Press comes to a place where you're pressed out then watch what I'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull then and it'll be absolutely to the total lost but it it will be for the bride in the church now we're closer than it seems to be I don't know when but it's real real close I may be building a platform for somebody else to step on I may be taken before that time I don't know and that time may be this coming week that the holy spirit will come with and bring Christ Jesus he may come this next week he may come yet tonight I don't know when he will come he doesn't tell us that but I do believe that we are so close that I will never die with old age yet at 54 years old I'll never die with old age until he's here unless I'm shot killed or something other some way killed this old age wouldn't kill me until he's come and I believe that and I want to say this I've never said it before but according to scripture according to what he said 30 years ago 33 years ago on the river down there in 19 and33 rather what he said everything has happened just exactly I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world for as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming so is the message to forun the second coming and John said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world so it's it paralleled it in every way and I know it will the message Will Go On
