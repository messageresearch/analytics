[0:23] ever do it then I get a bunch of traps I
[0:25] go to the mountains I let the rest of

[0:31] good shot some Hunter sometime will want
[0:34] me to go along if I get to be a pretty
[0:35] good shot he'll let me go along for his
[0:37] protection I'll get to go

[1:05] didn't really need the rifle but he put
[1:08] his arm around he said he's getting too
[1:09] old to hunt I want to give you my

[1:14] little boy how if I ever thought I'd
[1:15] owned a rifle like
[1:17] that oh my what it would have been and
[1:20] now I just think hanging there on my
[1:22] wall fine rifles places to go hunting I
[1:26] remember going out the boys to buy ice
[1:28] cream comb
[1:30] and sometimes some of them would have
[1:32] extra nickel and they' buy me one my I
[1:34] couldn't buy them one back I thought if
[1:36] I and they sometime used to buy these
[1:38] old what we call mudar hamburgers don't

[1:41] of you Old-Timers you get it for nickel

[1:48] how it is to eat now somebody buy me one
[1:51] of them hamburgers boy i' lick my
[1:52] fingers where I held it it was it was
[1:55] tastes so good and I thought boy that
[1:56] man if I could only buy him a hamburger
[2:00] and now I can buy a church their
[2:03] supper I remember all those things and
[2:05] where did it come
[2:07] from the grace of God hallelujah nothing
[2:11] that I did I remember going down the
[2:13] street here and I talk to somebody my
[2:15] father you all know it he drank he made
[2:17] whiskey and nobody had nothing to do
[2:20] with me I go down the street and try to
[2:22] talk to man I still meet that man today
[2:24] try to talk to somebody if there's
[2:26] nobody else to talk to they stand yeah
[2:28] mhm they I was a
[2:31] brandom so I'd feel real bad and turn
[2:34] around walk away I I'm not guilty of
[2:37] that I didn't do what my daddy did I
[2:40] never drink in my life why do I have to
[2:42] stand that now it's telling the wife
[2:45] you're not long ago I almost have to
[2:47] stay out of
[2:49] town God has done been good to me I
[2:52] thought over there where he told Nathan
[2:53] setting there one time Nathan David said
[2:56] is it right for me to live in a house of
[2:57] Cedar the Ark of my God under under tent
[3:00] out there coming Nathan the prophet said

[3:08] willingly that night the Lord come to
[3:09] the prophet said go tell my servant
[3:11] David I Tu him from that sheep coat
[3:14] hering them few sheep out there and I
[3:16] give him a name like great man that's in
[3:18] the earth never said he give him the
[3:19] greatest name he just give him name like
[3:20] great man that was in the earth I've
[3:22] done all these things for you David I've
[3:24] cut off your enemies wherever you went
[3:25] I've been beside you I've never failed
[3:27] you and I won't fail you but I can't let

[3:38] world and people from around the world
[3:40] calling to come pray for them and sick

[3:49] street now the businessman prosper by
[3:53] the people that to bring into the City
[3:54] and have here through their food and
[3:56] their Motel bills and things like that
[3:58] going to the motels and around in the
[4:00] city and things like people who pump and
[4:02] didn't love me at all nobody had any use
[4:04] for me and
