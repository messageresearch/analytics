[0:06] the blessings and benefits of paying
[0:08] tithes and offerings six reasons God
[0:11] asked us to give tithes and offerings
[0:14] first to support the pastors and other
[0:16] ministers so they can focus on praying
[0:18] and preaching second to help further and
[0:22] finish the Great Commission missionaries
[0:24] or apostles one of the five preaching
[0:26] gifts cannot go preach around the world
[0:28] without financial support God lets each
[0:31] person no matter how rich or poor help
[0:33] support the Great Commission by paying
[0:35] tithes and offerings third paying tithes
[0:39] and offerings teaches Christians to fear
[0:41] God according to Deuteronomy 14 23 and
[0:44] thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God
[0:46] in the place which he shall choose to
[0:48] place his name there the tithe of
[0:49] Eichhorn
[0:50] of thy wine and of thine oil and the
[0:53] first things of thy herds and of thy
[0:54] flocks that thou mayest learn to fear
[0:57] the Lord thy God always fearing God is
[1:01] hating evil and the love of money is the
[1:03] root of all evil giving more than ten
[1:05] percent of your money away in faith
[1:07] teaches Christians to reject and
[1:09] ultimately hate covetousness selfishness
[1:12] riches and teaches them to love
[1:14] righteousness godliness and peace the
[1:18] rich young ruler in matthew 1922 feared
[1:20] losing his riches more than he feared
[1:22] God choosing to reject Jesus's
[1:25] invitation to be an apostle which
[1:27] exposed his heart of unbelief despite
[1:30] following all the other Commandments
[1:33] fourth to learn humility and contentment
[1:36] God said the ties were his in Leviticus
[1:39] 27 verse 30 so we must humble ourselves
[1:41] and realize we are nothing and could
[1:44] have nothing without God's generous hand
[1:46] and all the tithe of the land whether of
[1:49] the seed of the land or of the fruit of
[1:51] the tree is the Lord's it is holy unto
[1:54] the Lord and the tenth shall be holy
[1:57] unto the Lord tithing the hallowed
[2:01] things also this means Abraham was just
[2:06] giving back to Melchizedek what was
[2:08] already his you and I are just giving
[2:10] God a portion back of what already
[2:12] belongs to him all work and increase is
[2:16] a gift from God Ecclesiastes 5:19 every
[2:20] man also to whom God hath given riches
[2:22] and wealth and have given him power to
[2:24] eat thereof and to take his portion and
[2:27] to rejoice in his labour this is the
[2:30] gift of God God is so gracious that he
[2:33] gives us a hundred percent of our income
[2:35] because he gives us strength to work a
[2:37] job all he asks is that we give a little
[2:40] over ten percent back to support the
[2:43] Great Commission God values contentment
[2:47] and those who set their affections on
[2:48] the treasures above in heaven and not
[2:51] upon earthly things but godliness with
[2:54] contentment is great gain for we brought
[2:56] nothing into this world and it is
[2:58] certain we can carry nothing out and
[3:00] having food and raiment let us be
[3:02] therewith content
[3:04] fifth it teaches us the cause-and-effect
[3:07] law of giving that we might be like God
[3:10] and that God might bless us proverbs 3
[3:13] verses 9 and 10 says if you honor God
[3:15] God will increase your income or
[3:17] substance honor the Lord with thy
[3:20] substance and with the first fruits of
[3:22] all thine increase so shall thy barns be
[3:24] filled with plenty and thy presses shall
[3:26] burst out with new wine
[3:29] God wants us to live by all his loss for
[3:33] we will be happiest when we keep his
[3:34] wise commands this way we learn to be
[3:37] generous just like God who sends his
[3:39] rain upon the just and the unjust in
[3:42] fact this is what Jesus said we must do
[3:45] in order to become like our Heavenly
[3:46] Father Matthew 5:44 through 46 but I say
[3:51] unto you love your enemies bless than
[3:53] the curse you do good to them that hate
[3:55] you and pray for them which despitefully
[3:56] use you and persecute you that ye may be
[3:59] the children of your father which is in
[4:01] heaven for he maketh his Sun to rise on
[4:03] the evil and on the good and sendeth
[4:06] rain on the just and on the unjust for
[4:08] if he love them which love you what
[4:10] reward have ye do not even the publicans
[4:12] the same acts 20:35 it is more blessed
[4:17] to give than receive 2nd Corinthians 9:6
[4:20] through 7 but God loveth a cheerful
[4:23] Giver
[4:24] God loves a cheerful Giver and we must
[4:27] be cheerful givers 6th taifeng proves we
[4:31] are the seed of Abraham and that God
[4:33] foreknew our obedience
[4:35] just as God recognized Levi's righteous
[4:37] habit of tithe paying two generations
[4:40] before he was born while he was in
[4:42] Abraham's loins Hebrews 7 9 through 10
[4:45] and as I may so say Levi also
[4:49] who received ties paid tithes in Abraham
[4:52] for he was yet in the loins of his
[4:55] father when Melchizedek met him be
[4:58] encouraged and be certain that God knows
[5:00] you are paying ties and which of your
[5:02] children or grandchildren will pay ties
[5:05] in the future God is keeping track of
[5:07] the givers as well as the thieves but
[5:10] remember just as God called and blessed
[5:12] Levi in a tithes and offering system God
[5:16] will bless and honor you and your family
[5:17] for paying tithes and offerings
[5:21] consequences of not paying God tithes
[5:24] and offerings the Bible says there are
[5:26] negative consequences to not paying
[5:28] tithes and offerings both during this
[5:30] life and also in the next life at the
[5:33] white throne judgment the first
[5:35] consequence is being identified as a
[5:37] robber or thief in the eyes of God
[5:39] during life and at the judgment although
[5:42] a man may prosper financially on the
[5:44] earth without paying tithes and
[5:45] offerings heaven will recognize him as a
[5:47] thief will a man Rob God yet ye have
[5:50] robbed me but ye say wherein have we
[5:52] robbed thee in tithes and offerings it
[5:56] seems many lost people will meet Christ
[5:58] on judgement day as thieves according to
[6:01] 1st Corinthians 6 verses 9 to 10 or
[6:03] those who have robbed God of tithes and
[6:05] offerings and will not possess or
[6:07] inherit God's kingdom
[6:09] 1st Corinthians 6:9 through 10 know ye
[6:12] not that the unrighteous shall not
[6:13] inherit the kingdom of God be not
[6:15] deceived neither fornicators nor
[6:17] idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate
[6:20] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[6:22] nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards
[6:26] nor revilers nor extortioners shall
[6:28] inherit the kingdom of God
[6:31] the second consequence is a distant
[6:34] dormant unfruitful relationship with
[6:37] Christ during this life recall Malachi 3
[6:40] 7 return unto me and I will return unto
[6:43] you saith the Lord of Hosts but ye say
[6:46] where and shall we return these Jews who
[6:49] robbed out of their tithes and offerings
[6:50] needed to return to God so they were
[6:53] living in a distant and dormant
[6:54] unfruitful relationship with God a third
[6:58] consequence is a curse nation or family
[7:01] during this life Malachi 3 9 you are
[7:04] cursed with a curse for yet rod me even
[7:07] this whole nation a fourth consequence
[7:10] maybe suffering financial hardships
[7:12] during this life as Israelis suffered
[7:15] during the days of Haggai when they
[7:17] neglected the house of God in order to
[7:19] take care of their own houses is it time
[7:22] for you o ye to dwell in your sealed
[7:25] houses and this house lie waste now
[7:28] therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts
[7:30] consider your ways you have so much and
[7:32] bring in little you
[7:34] but you have not enough you drink but
[7:36] you're not filled with drink you close
[7:38] you but there is none warm and he the
[7:41] earnest wages earth wages to put into a
[7:43] bag with holes
[7:46] in conclusion please pray about giving
[7:49] tithes and offerings to your storehouse
[7:50] your local or home Church God has
[7:54] graciously gifted you 100 percent of
[7:56] your income so you should be happy to
[7:58] give over 10 percent of that to support
[8:00] Jesus's Great Commission and he promised
[8:03] to bless you in this life and in the
[8:05] future the 1000 year millennial reign
[8:07] and in the New Jerusalem if you have any
[8:10] questions about giving tithes and
[8:12] offerings in the New Testament please
[8:13] contact us god bless you and may Jesus
[8:18] Christ be the desire of your heart
[8:22] you
