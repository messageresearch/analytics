[33:29] a heart just like jesus
[33:31] praise god that's what we desire
[33:34] we always want to know more about the
[33:36] lord praise god let's take our bibles
[33:38] and lord willing
[33:39] we'll do i like to look at blessings and
[33:41] curses again today
[33:44] so let's go to deuteronomy 28.
[33:52] i believe we'll start there deuteronomy
[33:55] 28
[33:59] verse one
[34:08] jeremy 28-1.
[34:31] reverses one and two let's read one and
[34:33] two together it's a little bit
[34:34] longer verse but uh what beautiful
[34:37] promises
[34:38] uh for the saints who keep the
[34:39] conditions of god's promises
[34:41] in the holy land praise god in the
[34:43] promised land and we
[34:44] as we saw in part two a lot of these
[34:46] carry over to the christian
[34:48] life praise god so let's read verses one
[34:50] and two
[34:51] on three one two three and it shall come
[34:54] to pass
[34:55] if thou shalt hearken diligently unto
[34:58] the voice of the lord thy god
[35:00] to observe and to do all his
[35:03] commandments
[35:04] which i command thee this day that the
[35:06] lord thy god will set thee on high above
[35:10] all nations of the earth and all these
[35:13] blessings shall
[35:14] come on thee and overtake thee if thou
[35:17] shalt hearken
[35:18] unto the voice of the lord thy god
[35:21] praise god let's have a word of prayer
[35:22] you have a need under your heart just
[35:23] make it known unto the lord here as we
[35:25] seek his blessings we seek his mercy
[35:27] of course there's a channel for that
[35:28] it's called repentance and obedience
[35:31] so let us pray together heavenly father
[35:33] we're so grateful for these promises
[35:34] lord these blessings
[35:36] that you promised to your people father
[35:38] as we saw on wednesday night lord israel
[35:40] was exalted above every nation a
[35:42] peculiar treasure
[35:43] because they kept your commands lord god
[35:46] you foreknew that abraham would want to
[35:48] serve you and obey you
[35:49] he'd be willing to leave his family
[35:51] behind and
[35:52] follow after you lord so we've done the
[35:54] same we know we're a peculiar people
[35:56] this morning lord
[35:58] born again of the holy spirit lord wash
[36:00] in the blood of jesus christ and
[36:02] hungering and thirsting for your
[36:04] righteousness today so bless your people
[36:06] lord quench their holy thirst today lord
[36:09] as our souls are thirsty
[36:10] for more of you today father grant it
[36:12] lord and i just pray god in our hearts
[36:14] would
[36:15] hearken diligently to every word of god
[36:17] lord that we can enjoy your blessings
[36:19] father god
[36:20] and lord just live in them and share
[36:21] them with others lord god
[36:23] and do our part lord to finish the great
[36:25] commission we ask all these things in
[36:27] jesus christ's name from the saints said
[36:29] amen praise god god bless you as being
[36:31] seated there praise god
[36:40] i do have some uh slides here uh
[36:44] okay
[36:48] so we'd like to look at this thought on
[36:50] blessings and curses here
[36:52] uh this morning i was thinking about
[36:55] going a different way but as i just
[36:56] studied yesterday i just
[36:57] uh kind of come back to this and um i
[37:00] have a whole lot more scriptures to go
[37:02] i'm searching the whole bible on the
[37:03] word curse and i'm at exodus 21 17. i've
[37:06] already done the new testament
[37:08] but i'm stuck right there at exodus uh
[37:11] 21-17
[37:12] because there's so much about blessings
[37:14] and curses and so i trust that the lord
[37:16] will help me to
[37:17] deliver the message today i'm going to
[37:19] try not to yell and scream
[37:21] and shout and praise god i'm just so
[37:22] happy to be here i'm going to try to
[37:24] contain myself
[37:25] because i am honestly i'm still a little
[37:27] tired uh this week i went back to work
[37:29] you know all week all five days and
[37:30] just a little tired uh but i just had to
[37:33] preach by the thing i just had to buddy
[37:34] just had to get to see my god that's
[37:36] yeah
[37:36] that's even having a chance to greet you
[37:38] buddy god bless you sir good to see you
[37:39] thanks god
[37:40] so god bless everybody this morning uh
[37:43] so let's look at uh this this uh
[37:45] scripture it's a beautiful beautiful
[37:47] scripture
[37:49] i just want to quickly uh briefly review
[37:51] uh part
[37:52] two if you got your bibles let's go to
[37:55] second samuel
[37:56] 24. i just some of these were so
[37:58] astonishing to me
[38:00] uh i just i felt like we need to read
[38:03] them over
[38:04] again i just thought they were just so
[38:05] amazing uh
[38:07] to me church is fresh revelation
[38:09] whenever i find something that uh
[38:12] it just it pieces the the story of god
[38:14] it pieces the mind of god together like
[38:16] brother and i talked about a puzzle
[38:18] whenever you find a revelation and it's
[38:20] god's revelation
[38:21] when you put it into the picture of god
[38:23] it makes the picture clear
[38:25] and that's what i find as i study the
[38:26] scripture the picture's becoming clear
[38:28] praise god amen amen and i was sharing a
[38:31] few things with amen i'll share in a
[38:33] little bit but just about
[38:34] some scriptures now this scripture is so
[38:37] beautiful uh because to background a
[38:41] little bit
[38:41] god was needing to punish israel because
[38:44] he deals with them as a nation
[38:46] but he needed a reason to do it right he
[38:50] needed a reason to do it so
[38:51] god god god knows that david wants to
[38:54] number the people or i'm sorry he's been
[38:56] tempted
[38:56] of the devil uh to want to number the
[38:59] people and so god knows david is going
[39:01] to give in to that
[39:03] it's a sin it's awful sin but god is
[39:06] going to use that knowing
[39:08] david is going to sin and number the
[39:10] people god's going to use that occasion
[39:12] to bring punishment upon the rest of the
[39:15] nation
[39:16] okay it's such a it's such a striking
[39:19] thing
[39:20] and it proves this god will always use
[39:23] human free more agency bias for
[39:26] knowledge
[39:26] in other words in other words god is
[39:29] only going to use people's free will
[39:31] god is not going to force things upon
[39:33] people until the judgment praise god
[39:35] but ultimately that was their choice
[39:37] anyway
[39:38] right so to me it magnifies free more
[39:41] agency sometimes i listen online and i
[39:43] hear preachers make it sound like almost
[39:45] like we don't even have a choice
[39:46] if that's the case then we're all just
[39:48] mindless robots and we really don't love
[39:50] god we're just programmed to do it
[39:52] but it's not that way it's we have the
[39:54] choice it's we have the
[39:56] free moral ability to choose to love god
[39:59] and because we choose to love god we are
[40:01] his dearly beloved praise god
[40:03] we are his special people praise god uh
[40:06] because
[40:07] he said whosoever will let him come and
[40:09] so god is off he
[40:11] offers it to everybody the bible said
[40:12] god would not that any man perish
[40:15] but god wants all to be saved but he
[40:17] know they won't
[40:18] so by his foreknowledge he has a special
[40:20] people he calls them his bride amen he
[40:23] calls him his nearly beloved
[40:24] he calls him his his peculiar people his
[40:27] chosen nation his holy seed amen
[40:29] and he calls them they are predestinated
[40:31] to be his bride
[40:33] but it's because they're choosing god's
[40:35] ways over satan's ways
[40:38] now look at verse 1 and again the anger
[40:41] the lord was kindled against israel
[40:43] and he moved david of course god don't
[40:45] tempt any man so this is written in
[40:47] mysteries right
[40:48] this is written in a way that it would
[40:50] maybe confuse the critic well see god is
[40:53] god is leading david to
[40:56] to sin and that's not true he's not so
[40:58] it's just written a little bit strange
[41:00] right
[41:01] and he moved david against them to say
[41:03] go and number
[41:04] israel and judah for the king said to
[41:06] joab the captain of the host which was
[41:08] with him go now
[41:09] through all the tribes of israel from
[41:10] dan even to beersheba and number ye the
[41:12] people
[41:13] that i may know the number of the people
[41:15] see david at this point he got a little
[41:17] you know he's already committed with a
[41:18] adultery with bathsheba he's getting you
[41:20] know all the blood was upon his house
[41:22] the
[41:22] the the chastisements and here he's a
[41:24] little he's a little he's either a
[41:26] little fearful or prideful praise god
[41:28] because he wants to number his people
[41:30] and see how big he's become
[41:32] right we got to be careful not to number
[41:34] ourselves right or not
[41:35] not to think too big of our numbers
[41:37] praise god
[41:38] and so see it was a sin
[41:42] and he says uh he said now verse 3 and
[41:45] job
[41:45] joab said unto the king now the lord thy
[41:47] god added to the people how many so ever
[41:49] they be a hundredfold that the eyes of
[41:51] the lord the king
[41:52] may see it but why that the lord my king
[41:55] delight in this thing so see joab
[41:57] look at look at how god will send you a
[41:58] friend to correct you when you're wrong
[42:01] right and look i love it god had joab
[42:03] must have been a real strong-willed man
[42:06] because he didn't he didn't bend or he
[42:07] didn't just say okay he wasn't a yes man
[42:09] like okay king okay okay
[42:10] i've got a lot of yes men and women
[42:12] around the message right there they're
[42:13] afraid to
[42:14] stand up for the truth of god even when
[42:16] a leader is wrong right
[42:17] they're scared to stand up against it
[42:19] but thank god that there's some that are
[42:21] just
[42:21] so devoted to god's word that they'll
[42:24] even stand up to the king praise god
[42:26] and stand upon the truth of his word
[42:29] so he says ah we shouldn't why are you
[42:31] delighting in your numbers why are you
[42:33] delighting in the numbers
[42:34] why don't you just be happy with god's
[42:36] increase and not get
[42:38] excited about your numbers
[42:42] so who wins whose word is going to win
[42:44] the king or joab
[42:47] notwithstanding the king's word
[42:48] prevailed against joab
[42:50] and against the captain the host and
[42:52] joab and the captains of the host went
[42:54] out from the presence of the king
[42:55] to number the people israel and they
[42:56] passed over jordan and pitched in
[42:58] area or on the right side of the city
[43:00] that lies in the midst of the river of
[43:02] gad
[43:02] and toward jay zier and i'm going to
[43:04] skip down a little bit
[43:07] verse 9. and joab gave up the sum of the
[43:08] people i'm sorry number of the people
[43:10] under the king and there were in israel
[43:12] 800 000 valiant men that drew the sword
[43:15] and the men of judah were
[43:17] 500 000 men now look at verse 10 and
[43:19] david's heart
[43:20] smote him after that he numbered the
[43:23] people and david said
[43:24] lord i have sinned greatly in that i
[43:26] have done now here's a man
[43:27] after god's own heart praise god he
[43:30] makes a mistake
[43:31] and as soon as the holy spirit reveals
[43:33] it to him he said be merciful to me
[43:35] amen he had such a trust in god that
[43:38] in every victory he'd dance and rejoice
[43:40] and praise the lord
[43:42] but in every failure he was humble
[43:44] enough to say
[43:45] i'm guilty i'm the one that sinned
[43:47] greatly how many want to be humble like
[43:49] that praise god
[43:50] oh god help us to be sensitive to the
[43:52] holy spirit that when we see we made a
[43:54] mistake
[43:54] we can say i'm sorry lord i'm the one
[43:56] that's greatly sinned
[43:59] he said i have done very foolishly
[44:01] finishing verse 10.
[44:02] actually i skipped a few sentences in
[44:04] there and now i beseech the o lord take
[44:06] away the iniquity of thy servant for i
[44:08] have done very foolishly so david admits
[44:10] i should have known better
[44:11] i did know better and i went
[44:14] i went against joab's warning i went
[44:18] against that i've sinned greatly
[44:20] remember god had remember verse one he
[44:22] had to punish israel somehow
[44:24] so he uses somebody else's uh
[44:27] uh human weakness in order to punish
[44:30] other people
[44:32] right now only
[44:36] the only person that could do that is
[44:37] someone who's infinite
[44:39] right may god help us not to get revenge
[44:41] on others
[44:43] right help us not to think well if i
[44:45] mistreat somebody it must have been
[44:46] god's
[44:47] uh judgment against them let's not be
[44:49] like that
[44:50] because you probably won't do like david
[44:52] didn't say i've sinned greatly
[44:53] afterwards
[44:54] right when people have the wrong motive
[44:56] and objective
[44:57] we don't want to see anybody suffer
[44:59] right but god uses
[45:01] it to punish the people see god will
[45:04] always use
[45:05] people's free more agency to accomplish
[45:08] all of his purposes
[45:11] now look at verse 11. for when david was
[45:13] up in the morning the word lord came
[45:14] unto
[45:15] the prophet gad david seer saying i like
[45:18] that amen
[45:18] the word when did it come in the morning
[45:21] amen
[45:22] i know it comes at night sometimes too
[45:24] but look at this the word of god came in
[45:26] the morning
[45:27] here we are in the morning in the house
[45:28] of god amen that's when god's word comes
[45:31] amen
[45:32] many times go and say unto david thus
[45:34] saith the lord i offer thee three things
[45:36] choose the one of them that i may do it
[45:39] to thee
[45:40] now look at this so god came to david
[45:43] and told him and said shall seven years
[45:44] of famine come unto thee in thy land
[45:46] or wilt thou flee three months before
[45:48] thy enemies while they pursue thee
[45:50] or that there be three days pestilence
[45:52] in thy land
[45:53] now advise and see what answer i shall
[45:57] return
[45:58] to him that set me and david said unto
[46:00] god i am in a great straight let us
[46:02] fall now in the hand of the lord for his
[46:04] mercies are great and let me not
[46:06] fall into that hand of man
[46:09] so seven years of famine
[46:12] three months of running from your
[46:13] enemies now he'd already been through
[46:15] that with years with saul
[46:17] right or three days of pestilence so he
[46:20] chooses
[46:20] the three days of pestilence
[46:24] and we know the story i believe 70 000
[46:27] uh died yes verse 50 says
[46:30] uh so the lord sent a pestilence upon
[46:32] israel from the morning to the time
[46:33] appointed and there died of the people
[46:34] from dan
[46:35] even to beersheba 70 000 men remember
[46:38] they already had three years of famine
[46:40] because of saul's bloody treatment of
[46:42] the gibby knights
[46:43] so he'd already been through three years
[46:44] of family didn't want to do seven he'd
[46:46] already run from saul
[46:47] he didn't want to do that didn't want to
[46:49] run from men again so he takes the three
[46:51] days of pestilence
[46:52] i tell him my chronovirus lasted about
[46:54] two and a half days by the way
[46:56] not quite three days that fever lasts
[46:57] about two and a half days
[46:59] my back ached like crazy i had an awful
[47:02] headache for about a day and a half
[47:04] uh but by that by the half of the two
[47:06] and a half day point
[47:08] i was washing this to change diapers i
[47:10] changed at least one day for a day
[47:12] so thank the lord for his mercy now
[47:14] david here he
[47:16] uh he smotes himself because he knows it
[47:19] was wrong
[47:20] to want to know the number of the people
[47:22] for his sake
[47:24] praise god and so we see that uh god
[47:27] will always
[47:28] deal through man's free more agency in
[47:31] other words
[47:31] church we shouldn't blame god for
[47:33] anything
[47:35] if anything happens if whatever happens
[47:37] we should be able to say
[47:38] the lord gives the lord takes away
[47:40] blessed be the name of the lord but i'm
[47:42] not going to blame the holy one of
[47:44] israel
[47:45] i won't blame him because he does all
[47:47] things well praise god
[47:49] he is good and his mercy endureth
[47:51] forever
[47:53] glory now i also want to look at uh a
[47:55] few things here
[47:57] uh did you notice from the old testament
[48:01] to the new testament so now back to
[48:02] deuteronomy 28.
[48:11] so while you're turning deuteronomy 28
[48:12] yeah i wanted to read that at the bottom
[48:13] that whole story of david
[48:15] god never works outside of three more
[48:16] agency nor can he attempt man
[48:19] he worked through david's backsliding to
[48:21] punish israel for their long term
[48:23] for their long-term backsliding now
[48:25] deuteronomy 28
[48:28] now remember 27 has all these curses for
[48:31] secret idols
[48:33] helping and judging uh the weak
[48:37] and then sexual sins it gives all these
[48:39] curses so it kind of gives starts with
[48:41] some prelude of curses
[48:42] and then it goes into all the blessings
[48:44] the blessings are verses
[48:46] 1 to 14. but i specifically wanted to
[48:50] show
[48:51] uh the the summary here and then verse
[48:54] 33. so
[48:55] the summary of blessings is if you and i
[48:57] diligently
[48:58] serve god every day not just sundays
[49:01] praise god not just wednesdays but if we
[49:03] diligently serve god every day he'll
[49:04] exalt
[49:05] us spiritually in other words people you
[49:08] might we not we won't be exalted
[49:10] physically
[49:11] right because that would make us
[49:12] prideful like david's numbering issue
[49:14] there
[49:14] but he will exalt us in a spiritual
[49:16] fashion where people will
[49:17] have to acknowledge that there's
[49:19] something different about our lives
[49:21] right we're not low in the faith we're
[49:24] exalted in the faith
[49:25] we're not people of dishonor we're
[49:27] people of honor
[49:31] see reproduction spiritually saving
[49:33] souls
[49:34] uh filling with the holy ghost and
[49:35] naturally health
[49:38] victory we're the head not the tail and
[49:41] we're above
[49:42] not below praise god amen if we're above
[49:45] then every demon is under our feet
[49:47] praise god like
[49:48] like paul told the romans satan will
[49:50] soon
[49:51] shortly he'll be put under your feet
[49:53] praise god hallelujah
[49:55] but now i just want to uh just i want to
[49:58] go back there
[49:59] the curses are are so many we read them
[50:02] a couple
[50:03] the last time i preached on a wednesday
[50:04] night here at the church there were just
[50:06] so many curses
[50:07] uh and there was such a connection uh
[50:10] like even with the health of man so i
[50:12] i don't know if i got the right
[50:14] scripture down there but if you go to
[50:15] verse 33
[50:16] look at uh deuteronomy 28 33
[50:20] and as i was reviewing yesterday i just
[50:22] thought i just really want the church to
[50:23] see this
[50:24] uh and myself i want us all to see this
[50:29] because we should be a church of
[50:31] conquerors
[50:32] we should not be a church of defeated
[50:34] christians
[50:36] praise god we are not less than
[50:39] conquerors
[50:40] we are more than conquerors amen
[50:43] right we're not uh just weak and
[50:46] beggarly and
[50:47] just trying to get by we're supposed to
[50:49] be overcomers
[50:52] but one of the curses of not serving god
[50:55] was to be a constantly oppressed and
[50:58] constantly
[50:59] losing the battles so i want to just
[51:03] emphasize that that we're not losers
[51:05] we're winners praise god
[51:07] we might lose a few battles but we're
[51:09] going to win the war praise god
[51:11] amen now it was verse 33
[51:16] the fruit of thy land and all thy labors
[51:19] shall a nation which thou knowest not
[51:21] eat up and thou
[51:22] shalt only i'm sorry thou shalt be only
[51:25] oppressed
[51:26] and crushed always see we
[51:29] we we need to start recognizing in our
[51:31] lives and maybe in other people's lives
[51:34] people that are in continual victory or
[51:36] people that people that are in continual
[51:38] defeat
[51:39] we should be in continual victory praise
[51:41] god
[51:43] and if we see ourselves getting defeat
[51:45] then we need to diligently hearken to
[51:47] the word of god amen
[51:49] amen and if we see people diligently i'm
[51:51] sorry diligently disobeying or
[51:53] if we see people constantly being
[51:55] defeated then we've got to just give a
[51:56] word
[51:57] to try to encourage them and raise them
[51:59] out of their unbelief
[52:01] amen remember the bible said if a man's
[52:03] overtaken in a fault
[52:04] go to him in meekness and try to restore
[52:06] him to the faith but protect yourself
[52:08] unless you get tempted as well i'll
[52:11] partially paraphrase that from galatians
[52:13] 6 but i think you understand
[52:16] so we should be able to look at the
[52:17] pattern of our of your life can you and
[52:19] i look at the pattern of our life for
[52:21] 2020
[52:24] i was telling amen to bad guys i said
[52:25] this 2020 has been nothing but a
[52:27] blessing
[52:28] i mean i was sick about you know three
[52:30] days with coronavirus mother and that
[52:31] it's been an awesome year praise god
[52:33] a lot of victories amen a lot of
[52:35] blessings in my life
[52:37] where god has provided and helped and
[52:39] and give me more time and
[52:41] rest i don't think i've ever had this
[52:43] much rest physically
[52:45] and rest from work you know with uh
[52:46] going home with the remote learning i've
[52:48] just had more rest
[52:50] all right because i went back to school
[52:51] on monday banging i felt like my head
[52:53] was going to spin off at the end of the
[52:54] day
[52:55] i got about you know 2018 kids asking me
[52:57] questions all that
[52:58] all day just like this i felt like my
[52:59] head was going to spin off by the end of
[53:00] the day thank god i got a nice wife and
[53:02] children at home that loved me praise
[53:04] god it can help me to
[53:05] rest a little bit because it's just so
[53:07] much stress
[53:09] but uh i just wanted to remind us of
[53:12] this that
[53:13] it's so important that we should see a
[53:14] pattern of victory
[53:16] amen like joshua they had a pattern of
[53:18] victory until aiken
[53:20] let in those babylonian garments and the
[53:23] wedge of gold
[53:24] till he stole something until he brought
[53:26] something accursed
[53:27] in the camp oh god help us to have holy
[53:30] things in the camp
[53:31] help us to look at holy things on our
[53:33] phone praise god help us to read holy
[53:35] books in our houses praise god
[53:36] amen see it should be victory
[53:40] upon victory upon victory
[53:45] so see they only had this uh
[53:48] when they disobeyed it was just constant
[53:51] struggle
[53:52] constant struggle constant losses
[53:55] i'm just a slave and uh i can't i can't
[53:57] do anything to get out of this situation
[53:59] oh i i don't know about you but i know a
[54:02] chain breaker praise god
[54:04] amen i know way maker today his name's
[54:07] jesus praise god
[54:09] amen and you go to him and you confess
[54:11] your sins you confess your wrongs
[54:13] and he'll lift the curse off your life
[54:15] and he'll put the blessing on it
[54:17] amen by his grace by his blood
[54:21] now i i thought there's more i wanted to
[54:23] say but on that one but i think i'll
[54:25] just move on
[54:26] uh that we can understand this we must
[54:28] understand that
[54:29] we should be victorious we should be
[54:31] more than conquerors we should be
[54:33] overcomers praise god
[54:35] now um yeah we have a constant victory
[54:39] and we should overcome uh constant
[54:41] losses
[54:42] yeah in deuteronomy 28 let's read that
[54:44] one 21-22
[54:49] now look at verse 21 this was pestilence
[54:51] so this reminded me of coronavirus i'm
[54:53] just i'm just kind of been on that
[54:54] lately right
[54:55] the lord shall make the pestilence
[54:57] cleave unto thee until you have consumed
[54:59] thee from off the land
[55:00] whither thou goest to possess it so the
[55:03] pestilences the corona viruses of those
[55:05] days
[55:06] was going to kill them or take them off
[55:08] the land
[55:09] verse 22 the lord shall smite thee with
[55:12] a conception that was a lung disease
[55:15] right so you have trouble breathing and
[55:17] i had a little bit of trouble breathing
[55:19] and with a fever i had a fever and with
[55:21] inflammation i don't know if i had that
[55:23] and with an extreme burning and with the
[55:24] sword and with the blasting with the
[55:26] mildew
[55:27] and they shall pursue thee until thou
[55:29] perish
[55:30] so this curse would just be continually
[55:33] continually
[55:34] worse and worse they can't recover they
[55:36] can't get the healing
[55:37] they can't get the victory because it's
[55:40] a curse because they've disobeyed the
[55:42] word of the lord praise god
[55:44] now look at that and this is what struck
[55:46] me so hard was that in the
[55:48] new testament we have the same thing
[55:51] if we don't take the communion the right
[55:53] way
[55:55] then we get the same thing many are weak
[55:58] and sickly among you
[56:00] praise god isn't that striking isn't
[56:03] that amazing to us
[56:05] the same god in the old testament who
[56:06] said if you're in my land and you don't
[56:08] live right you're getting bodily uh
[56:10] diseases you're getting
[56:12] sickness all these things until you die
[56:14] the same god in the new
[56:16] testament says if you don't live in the
[56:17] holy ghost promised land the right way
[56:20] you'll die as well and many how many
[56:23] how many died in that corinthian church
[56:25] did he say a few or many
[56:27] he said many let's read it first
[56:29] corinthians
[56:30] 11 29 and 30.
[56:36] first corinthians 11 29 30.
[56:41] and i'm going to skip ahead to the slide
[56:42] where brother graham says that
[56:44] so you can see it
[56:49] some people might say oh that's not the
[56:50] message brother jesse oh yeah it is
[56:52] yeah it is you just haven't studied it
[56:54] far enough i didn't study it either
[56:56] until her lately
[56:57] program calls it a curse so we'll get to
[56:58] that in just a moment but let's read
[57:00] 20 when i say 29 30 11.
[57:05] yeah we can read 28. but let a man
[57:06] examine himself and so let him eat of
[57:08] that bread and drink of that cup
[57:09] for he that eateth and drinketh
[57:10] unworthily eateth and drink a damnation
[57:13] to himself not discerning
[57:14] the lord's body that's the church the
[57:17] saints
[57:18] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[57:20] among you
[57:21] and many sleep look at that many
[57:23] corinthian saints
[57:25] died because they didn't treat the
[57:28] saints right now remember what they have
[57:29] they had sleeping with their
[57:30] mother-in-laws
[57:32] they had getting drunk at the lord's
[57:33] table can you imagine well brother
[57:35] brother bang this encourages me so much
[57:37] we've got to be a book of acts church
[57:38] because we don't have anybody getting
[57:40] drunk at the lord's table except with
[57:41] the holy ghost
[57:44] hallelujah amen look at this we don't
[57:47] have anybody sleeping around the church
[57:48] whatever these
[57:49] i've heard of churches that do thank god
[57:51] god spared us
[57:53] right but look at this to me this just
[57:55] proves we are
[57:56] part of the book of acts church we're
[57:58] not seeing as much as we like but we
[57:59] are we're living higher than they lived
[58:02] amen
[58:03] that corinthian church i'm talking about
[58:06] praise god
[58:08] look who brother brahm says what are you
[58:09] you're a christian you live before
[58:11] everybody as a christian
[58:14] and if you take that and don't live as a
[58:16] christian you're not discerning the
[58:17] lord's body
[58:19] you're putting a stumbling block in
[58:21] somebody else's way see
[58:23] as they ch as they see you trying to do
[58:25] that
[58:26] and then not living what you're supposed
[58:27] to live so you're not in a certain lower
[58:29] body now watch
[58:30] what the curse of it is and then he
[58:32] reads the scripture
[58:33] your brother and believe there was curse
[58:34] in the new testament yes
[58:37] yes he did right
[58:39] [Music]
[58:40] and there's numerous numerous scriptures
[58:42] on this let me show you one real quick
[58:44] if i can just find this
[58:45] there was one that was a real special
[58:47] one i went to well i'm sorry just didn't
[58:49] say special but it's just so simple
[58:51] so i got lots of preach here i just uh i
[58:53] got to try to follow the leading of the
[58:54] lord here
[58:56] there's one that was really yeah here it
[58:59] is this is what i want to show you
[59:00] church
[59:02] there's really a curse for or in other
[59:06] words a punishment for every time we
[59:08] disobey god's word in other words the
[59:10] punishment
[59:11] it's not like a curse like oh i'm cursed
[59:13] forever right we talked about it in the
[59:15] first service
[59:16] on this series there's permanent curses
[59:18] like cain
[59:20] the serpent right the cursed children
[59:23] the sinners but then there's temporary
[59:26] curses
[59:27] like what paul said said many are
[59:30] weak and sickly among you because they
[59:33] don't discern the lord's body
[59:36] i don't know about church after service
[59:37] make sure you're treating everybody real
[59:38] good
[59:39] praise god you want god's blessing to
[59:42] continue you smile adam you treat him
[59:44] real good you know
[59:45] you listen see if you can help them out
[59:47] and then and then do it tomorrow too
[59:49] praise god
[59:51] treat god's speech because that's amen
[59:54] that's god with skin on praise god
[59:56] amen you know there's bang has a gene
[59:59] from god's mind
[1:00:01] a peace of god is in him praise god and
[1:00:04] how i treat him
[1:00:05] is how i treat jesus christ if he was
[1:00:07] here amen
[1:00:08] praise god so he said if you don't
[1:00:11] discern the i'm trying not to preach
[1:00:12] hard to with my voice
[1:00:13] he said if you don't discern the lord's
[1:00:15] body it brings a curse
[1:00:17] and many people in the corinthian church
[1:00:19] couldn't even treat their
[1:00:20] fellow christians with dignity and
[1:00:22] respect and they live
[1:00:24] any kind of life they go there get drunk
[1:00:26] at the lord's table and leave and paul
[1:00:28] said many die because of it
[1:00:30] thank god we got the holy ghost that's
[1:00:31] all i can say praise god
[1:00:33] i've never been part of one church that
[1:00:35] had drunk people at the lord's table
[1:00:37] i'd like to ask beatrice about that
[1:00:38] she's been the message a long long time
[1:00:39] maybe
[1:00:40] brother jose too had they ever seen such
[1:00:42] debauchery but paul saw it
[1:00:45] paul had to deal with it how many how
[1:00:48] many of you like to clean that mess up
[1:00:49] at the church
[1:00:50] i wouldn't i'm thankful we got a holy
[1:00:52] church here praise god
[1:00:54] i'm thankful we don't have those issues
[1:00:55] to clean up i thank the lord jesus
[1:00:57] christ for that
[1:00:59] now here so he says let's read it now
[1:01:02] the natural first bride of the human
[1:01:03] race before her husband come to her
[1:01:05] she fell from grace by listening to
[1:01:07] satan's lie after god had her forfeit
[1:01:09] fortified behind his word
[1:01:11] if she'd have stayed behind the word
[1:01:13] she'd have never fell
[1:01:16] now that's in the natural notice the
[1:01:18] natural
[1:01:19] and what's the curse the actual curse
[1:01:22] of coming out from behind god's word
[1:01:25] so see the word of god is a shield right
[1:01:28] faith
[1:01:28] right the word of god is a sword but
[1:01:31] brother man says if you
[1:01:32] put those armor pieces down and you try
[1:01:35] to fight and serve god or live
[1:01:37] without god's protection you come out
[1:01:39] from behind the word and you're cursed
[1:01:41] automatically in other words you disobey
[1:01:44] god's word it's going to bring a
[1:01:45] punishment upon your life
[1:01:48] right one of those they listed sickness
[1:01:50] we didn't even get to the mental ones
[1:01:51] there's like
[1:01:52] there's mental problems in deuteronomy
[1:01:54] 28 people no doubt that's why people go
[1:01:56] crazy around the message
[1:01:57] because they disobey god somewhere down
[1:01:59] the line and they fail to listen to the
[1:02:01] holy spirit
[1:02:03] and they fail to be like david i'm the
[1:02:04] one who's greatly sinned forgive me lord
[1:02:07] and restore me forgive me of my iniquity
[1:02:09] see they're too prideful to admit they
[1:02:11] made the mistake
[1:02:11] god help us to be humble and admit when
[1:02:13] we make mistakes and then see god
[1:02:15] restore us back into fellowship
[1:02:17] amen amen because you and i for honest
[1:02:19] we do it every week praise god
[1:02:21] right we fall short oh why'd i do that i
[1:02:24] didn't like my testimony there at school
[1:02:26] or
[1:02:27] i didn't like my testimony there my with
[1:02:28] my home god forgive me
[1:02:30] i was wrong but lord restore me and lord
[1:02:33] help me to wake up and when i see my
[1:02:34] family to be able to show the love of
[1:02:36] christ to them
[1:02:38] or when i go to work help me to show the
[1:02:40] love of christ never when i go to school
[1:02:42] to show the love of christ let me be
[1:02:44] ready to produce a better
[1:02:47] because i'm the one that sinned i'm the
[1:02:50] one that did wrong
[1:02:51] i knew better i was walking in iniquity
[1:02:57] remember church let's not get on our
[1:02:59] high horses
[1:03:00] let's remember some of the things
[1:03:01] brother branham did yet he had the holy
[1:03:04] ghost he lied to the irs
[1:03:06] uh he said god you owe me an
[1:03:09] understanding when that woman died after
[1:03:11] uh she had drowned and got brought back
[1:03:13] to life and god said
[1:03:15] the brother man said god like pulled
[1:03:16] down a black sheet and wouldn't talk to
[1:03:18] him for two weeks
[1:03:19] he said don't ever demand something from
[1:03:21] god
[1:03:23] right the angel told him don't you make
[1:03:26] a show of this
[1:03:27] of the second poll and brother man the
[1:03:29] angel said you did and you made a public
[1:03:31] show of it and you caused all these
[1:03:32] imitations
[1:03:34] remember the angel lord told brother man
[1:03:35] then he said because you tried to
[1:03:37] describe the gift in your hand then you
[1:03:39] tried to
[1:03:40] describe the discernment he said because
[1:03:42] you tried to describe spiritual things
[1:03:44] you have people up on the platform
[1:03:47] pretending to sniff devils remember
[1:03:48] brother man said they'd have a broom and
[1:03:49] say shoe devil shoe devil
[1:03:51] i smell devil or sweep a devil out the
[1:03:53] angel said brother branham calls that
[1:03:56] so let's not make brother graham out to
[1:03:57] be god he's not god he's a man
[1:04:00] he was saved by god he was god's servant
[1:04:02] he was a faithful servant he made
[1:04:04] mistakes he fell short but
[1:04:05] then he was wrong like paul did praise
[1:04:08] god he said
[1:04:09] thank you to god who gives us the
[1:04:10] victory through the lord jesus christ
[1:04:12] amen god gave the prophet victory
[1:04:14] brother man he'll give us victory
[1:04:16] amen that's right
[1:04:20] some people think i'm harsh on brother
[1:04:22] i'm not i'm just i'm just trying to get
[1:04:23] it to us
[1:04:24] that god gave him grace god will give us
[1:04:26] grace
[1:04:27] in other words you can have the holy
[1:04:29] ghost and do something just you're
[1:04:30] totally ashamed of
[1:04:32] but yet god will invite you back if
[1:04:34] you'll repent and say sorry
[1:04:36] praise god you can never lose if you're
[1:04:38] if you've got the holy ghost you'll
[1:04:39] never lose the seal
[1:04:41] to the day of your day you'll never lose
[1:04:42] that seal but you'll lose his favor
[1:04:45] you lose his blessings now let me go
[1:04:48] back here it's already 12. let me set
[1:04:49] timer here
[1:04:51] i don't want to go too long okay so
[1:04:54] let's go back
[1:04:58] okay so we went back here let's uh find
[1:05:01] the next few thoughts i'd like to
[1:05:02] deliver here
[1:05:06] do you enjoy the blessings of god on
[1:05:07] your life hallelujah hallelujah i'm so
[1:05:11] thankful for the blessings of god
[1:05:14] um so i just i just thought you'd want
[1:05:16] to see that church isn't that
[1:05:17] isn't that special we are in a spiritual
[1:05:19] promised land but many of these
[1:05:21] same punishments apply if we don't obey
[1:05:24] the word of god
[1:05:26] but all the blessings apply if we do
[1:05:29] oh i love it church isn't that beautiful
[1:05:30] that's a this is to me this is fresh
[1:05:32] revelation
[1:05:33] praise god it's it's so fresh and it
[1:05:35] applies directly to our lives right now
[1:05:40] okay then i want to bring this out you
[1:05:41] know this minister unless he was a
[1:05:43] pentecostal preacher
[1:05:44] he passed on but he dealt a lot with
[1:05:46] blessings and curses
[1:05:47] he said a lot of these are from curses
[1:05:50] mental breakdowns
[1:05:51] chronic sicknesses especially if they're
[1:05:53] hesitary also when doctors cannot find a
[1:05:56] cause to sickness
[1:05:57] female trouble barrenness miscarriage
[1:06:00] tendency
[1:06:01] divorces and family breakups financial
[1:06:03] insufficiency
[1:06:04] accident prone suicide and unnatural
[1:06:07] death tendencies
[1:06:08] he just noticed in his decades-long
[1:06:10] ministry 50 years of ministry
[1:06:12] many of these are caused by curses which
[1:06:15] means
[1:06:16] people need to repent of something from
[1:06:18] their past
[1:06:19] and they haven't dealt with something
[1:06:21] from their past
[1:06:23] and because they know better they should
[1:06:25] have god is spanking them which we saw
[1:06:27] god carries a stick doesn't he
[1:06:29] remember hebrews chapter 12 the rod any
[1:06:32] son that he doesn't chasten
[1:06:34] that means smite with the rod is not a
[1:06:36] son of god
[1:06:38] so see god has to allow some of our
[1:06:39] brothers and saints in the message
[1:06:41] to get some of these things if they
[1:06:43] won't honor god and respect god
[1:06:46] that's true that's in deuteronomy 28.
[1:06:48] now let's read this one this is a
[1:06:49] beautiful one
[1:06:50] uh zechariah 5 if you got it let's go
[1:06:53] there
[1:06:54] i want to i just want to take time to
[1:06:56] get some of these
[1:06:58] i think they'll be a help to you
[1:07:02] remember chapter four was the vision of
[1:07:04] the candlesticks
[1:07:06] with the two prophets right not by might
[1:07:09] not by power but by my spirit saith the
[1:07:11] lord
[1:07:13] and we all know that's where the bible
[1:07:15] shows that oil
[1:07:16] represents the holy ghost amen right
[1:07:20] so that's a scripture we use to
[1:07:22] understand new testament things like the
[1:07:24] parable of the ten virgins
[1:07:26] what's that oil represent the baptism of
[1:07:28] the holy ghost
[1:07:29] the spirit of god so if we can gain that
[1:07:32] from zechariah 4
[1:07:34] what can we gain from zechariah 5. we
[1:07:36] can gain a lot and we can gain a lot
[1:07:38] about blessings and curses
[1:07:39] and the condition of your home the
[1:07:42] literal place where you lay your head
[1:07:44] i don't start thinking about the pillow
[1:07:45] because you're gonna fall asleep
[1:07:47] right think about your home i love my
[1:07:50] home let's not fall asleep yet
[1:07:52] okay zechariah five verse one now look
[1:07:54] at this
[1:07:57] then i turned and lifted up my eyes and
[1:07:59] looked and behold a flying
[1:08:00] roll now the flying represents swiftness
[1:08:05] and this is what we see we can see like
[1:08:07] preachers now especially preachers
[1:08:08] because they're in the public eye right
[1:08:10] they're the parts of the body that
[1:08:11] everybody sees but god remember god said
[1:08:13] that's not the part i give the most
[1:08:14] honor to
[1:08:16] and the church said amen the part of the
[1:08:20] body everybody sees
[1:08:21] that's not what god gives the most honor
[1:08:23] to it's the unseen parts
[1:08:25] the laity i appreciate it a while ago
[1:08:30] now notice the flying represents
[1:08:32] swiftness
[1:08:34] uh yeah let me read verse two sorry i
[1:08:36] forgot my thought i was over there
[1:08:37] i went to something else i forgot my
[1:08:38] thought a flying roll
[1:08:40] and he said to me what see us thou and i
[1:08:42] answered i see a flying roll the length
[1:08:44] thereof is 20 cubits and the breath
[1:08:46] thereof 10 cubits then he said to me
[1:08:50] this
[1:08:50] is the curse so this flying rose what
[1:08:53] it's a curse
[1:08:54] this flying book or scroll is a curse
[1:08:58] that goeth forth over the face of the
[1:09:00] whole earth
[1:09:01] for everyone that stealth shall be cut
[1:09:04] off as on this side according to it
[1:09:06] and everyone that sweareth shall be cut
[1:09:09] off as
[1:09:10] on that side according to it so see when
[1:09:13] people lie
[1:09:14] when people steal or when they sin in
[1:09:18] general
[1:09:19] god has a flying role
[1:09:22] god has a judgment a written judgment
[1:09:26] against people how many people got these
[1:09:28] bibles laying in their homes brother
[1:09:31] almost every american right owns the
[1:09:33] bible i say almost but
[1:09:34] a large majority of americans own a
[1:09:36] bible
[1:09:38] and god likens curses to flying rolls
[1:09:41] that fly into people's houses
[1:09:44] and look what it does to their home
[1:09:47] watch what it does to their home life
[1:09:50] in other words what i'm trying to say is
[1:09:52] we should have and i've been on this for
[1:09:53] a while
[1:09:54] off and on but we should have such godly
[1:09:56] homes
[1:09:58] where the angels of god could visit us
[1:10:01] should they
[1:10:02] need to visit us
[1:10:06] i'll say like this if there's one place
[1:10:07] where we can have peace
[1:10:09] it should be the home now the more
[1:10:11] children you get the harder it is
[1:10:14] just take my word for it so
[1:10:17] what i mean sometimes on saturday i got
[1:10:19] to come to the church and study here
[1:10:21] if not i'll get sweet little children
[1:10:22] coming up and that interrupted me every
[1:10:24] couple of minutes you know
[1:10:26] which i don't mind that it's hard to get
[1:10:28] any studying done when you got that
[1:10:29] going on
[1:10:30] uh but it's a it should be a place
[1:10:34] of peace and rest in other words your
[1:10:36] home should be like the church
[1:10:39] it should be calm and sweet and peaceful
[1:10:42] and you should feel the presence of god
[1:10:44] there
[1:10:44] amen and guess who's taking care of it
[1:10:48] dad and mom who's whose job is it to be
[1:10:51] the deacons at the house
[1:10:52] at the house yeah is that
[1:10:55] it's that fifth gospel preacher that
[1:10:57] gospel mom
[1:10:59] and that preacher dad right that leader
[1:11:02] the priest of the home it's his
[1:11:03] their jobs their jobs to keep the church
[1:11:06] clean
[1:11:07] sometimes you gotta get out that whip
[1:11:09] right brother vane
[1:11:10] the cord not too much yet
[1:11:15] but sometimes you got to get that out to
[1:11:16] keep the house clean and in reverence
[1:11:18] for the lord
[1:11:20] uh verse four and i will bring it forth
[1:11:23] who's gonna send that scroll
[1:11:24] god god
[1:11:27] sayeth the lord of hosts and it shall
[1:11:29] enter into the house of the
[1:11:31] thief did you know this quote brother
[1:11:34] brahm said i never did steal anything in
[1:11:35] my life
[1:11:36] you know he said this except i stole
[1:11:38] god's time
[1:11:42] he said and he talked about when he was
[1:11:43] a sinner instead of being at the church
[1:11:46] he said when i was a sinner i was out
[1:11:48] washing my ford
[1:11:50] he said i stole god's time now what
[1:11:52] about us when
[1:11:54] when we feel the leading of the lord and
[1:11:55] we should be studying in our homes or
[1:11:57] praying more
[1:11:58] but then we go off into worldly
[1:12:00] pleasures or something like that
[1:12:01] understand what i'm saying
[1:12:03] we still got that's that's our time to
[1:12:05] reconnect with jesus
[1:12:08] right and we got to make sure we don't
[1:12:10] steal that away
[1:12:11] right that hinders our walk with god how
[1:12:13] we know that enters our walk with god
[1:12:15] if we don't take that time and give that
[1:12:17] time to jesus
[1:12:19] to to love him and worship him and then
[1:12:21] he gives his love back to us
[1:12:23] we've stolen from him we've stolen from
[1:12:26] him
[1:12:28] because nothing is more important than
[1:12:29] what time
[1:12:31] time nothing is more important than time
[1:12:34] so he said redeem it
[1:12:36] redeem the time because these days are
[1:12:38] evil
[1:12:42] he said verse finishing verse 4 and it
[1:12:43] shall enter into the house of the thief
[1:12:45] and into the house of him that swear
[1:12:47] falsely
[1:12:48] by my name oh my we just had that happen
[1:12:52] and it shall remain in the midst of his
[1:12:54] house
[1:12:55] and shall consume it with the timber
[1:12:57] thereof and the stones there
[1:12:58] people wonder why is my family falling
[1:13:01] apart why is my home
[1:13:03] falling apart i would check your words i
[1:13:06] would check
[1:13:07] what you've taken with your hands
[1:13:10] i would check how you're spending your
[1:13:12] time god said he's going to send it
[1:13:14] brother
[1:13:15] god said i'm going to send that role in
[1:13:17] there it's a curse it's a written
[1:13:19] it's a written word of a curse because
[1:13:21] they've stolen
[1:13:22] they've spoken wrong in the name of the
[1:13:24] lord
[1:13:25] and their house is gonna crumble
[1:13:29] right that's why i thought it was so
[1:13:32] important
[1:13:32] church so we can represent that now what
[1:13:36] did it say
[1:13:36] yeah did you catch that it went over the
[1:13:38] whole earth so that has to be gentiles
[1:13:42] he said this role is going to go over
[1:13:44] the whole earth
[1:13:47] people's lives fall apart homes
[1:13:51] relationships crumble down because of
[1:13:54] curses
[1:13:56] not diligently obeying the word of god
[1:14:01] in church i think we all understand some
[1:14:03] of the hardest words to say is i'm sorry
[1:14:05] it's my fault those five words
[1:14:08] blame it on somebody else don't talk
[1:14:10] about ignore it but that's true
[1:14:12] i'm sorry it's my fault david could do
[1:14:15] that
[1:14:16] and god honored him
[1:14:23] so see when we see homes and families
[1:14:25] consumed with destruction
[1:14:27] consumed with with uh broken
[1:14:30] relationships
[1:14:31] consumed by sin there is a cause
[1:14:34] remember we showed that scripture
[1:14:35] there's a cause for every curse there's
[1:14:38] a cause
[1:14:38] god don't send it without cause
[1:14:44] and if it comes and if a trouble happens
[1:14:46] and you can't find the cause then you
[1:14:48] know the cause is for god's glory
[1:14:50] amen like job amen hallelujah you know
[1:14:53] it's for god's glory he's trying to
[1:14:56] humble you down and break you down
[1:14:58] so you depend on him more so you can be
[1:15:00] strong in his strength when you're weak
[1:15:03] then you're strong in christ
[1:15:06] he's trying to break you down to get you
[1:15:08] to build you up with more trust more
[1:15:10] obedience
[1:15:11] more diligence in the things of god
[1:15:13] hallelujah
[1:15:14] thank you jesus
[1:15:21] okay now what did i do just a moment
[1:15:24] i think
[1:15:27] okay yeah i want to close with this now
[1:15:29] i say close
[1:15:30] 17 minutes give me 17 minutes
[1:15:34] because i do want to close with this i
[1:15:35] do by god's grace
[1:15:38] um so when i started looking up brother
[1:15:39] braham quotes with the word curse
[1:15:41] the most i found that i've found so far
[1:15:44] haven't gone through all of them
[1:15:45] the most i've found are with balaam
[1:15:47] trying to curse israel israel
[1:15:49] which we're all very familiar with that
[1:15:51] but i thought we'd review it again and
[1:15:52] just see some of these
[1:15:53] uh beautiful words and promises in the
[1:15:56] scripture
[1:15:58] and i think it'll help us by the grace
[1:15:59] of the lord you know cam and i were
[1:16:01] talking about it and cam actually
[1:16:02] pointed me to this chapter
[1:16:04] uh while we were there at my mom's 70th
[1:16:07] party that's where i got covered
[1:16:11] uh at least i got some good nuggets out
[1:16:12] of it too
[1:16:14] my mother man just let you know buddy
[1:16:15] you really inspired me i was when i was
[1:16:17] laying there on that first day i was so
[1:16:20] tired but i kept saying this is lying
[1:16:22] vanities this is lying vanities
[1:16:24] i didn't feel a miracle but i did feel
[1:16:26] he i felt healed about two and a half
[1:16:27] days later
[1:16:29] but that so inspired me i just kept
[1:16:30] saying it's a lie
[1:16:32] you know cause i was basically all by
[1:16:33] myself laying in the room you know i
[1:16:34] couldn't get comfortable one way or the
[1:16:36] other you know
[1:16:37] um but that really inspired me uh
[1:16:40] because of the testimony with his dad
[1:16:42] just call it lying vanities lying
[1:16:44] vanities and here i am back in the house
[1:16:46] of god amen
[1:16:47] thank the lord it's it's a lie from the
[1:16:50] from from hell
[1:16:51] thank god for his grace so let's look at
[1:16:54] balak's desire to curse israel now
[1:16:57] and he took his parable and said baalik
[1:16:59] the king of moab has brought me from
[1:17:00] aram out of the mountains of the east
[1:17:02] saying
[1:17:02] come curse me jacob and come defy israel
[1:17:07] see people that are against us they want
[1:17:09] god to be
[1:17:10] angry with us or they want god to hate
[1:17:13] us you can see it with
[1:17:14] a lot of this political thing right
[1:17:17] that's just minor
[1:17:19] look how much they hate people that are
[1:17:20] conservative
[1:17:22] right they so i said baelix a modern-day
[1:17:25] democrat if i could say that
[1:17:26] not all democrats i should say uh
[1:17:30] maybe modern-day antifa or matter
[1:17:32] modern-day violent black lives matter
[1:17:35] person
[1:17:36] because it they want they look at a
[1:17:38] godly group and they hate them
[1:17:41] and they want god they want judgment on
[1:17:43] them instead of blessing
[1:17:45] remember we're supposed to bless those
[1:17:47] who curse us
[1:17:49] right but here we have them we have the
[1:17:51] the violent
[1:17:52] uh sinful side moabites right trying to
[1:17:55] curse
[1:17:56] god's people he said come curse me jacob
[1:18:00] come defy israel and
[1:18:03] balaam says how shall i curse whom god
[1:18:05] is not cursed or
[1:18:06] how shall i defy whom the lord hath not
[1:18:09] defied
[1:18:11] i'd say he's a false prophet but he had
[1:18:12] a lot of wisdom in this case
[1:18:16] for from the tops of the rocks i see him
[1:18:18] and from the hills i behold him and lo
[1:18:21] the people shall dwell alone now brother
[1:18:23] baby says see that proves they weren't a
[1:18:25] denomination
[1:18:26] this church didn't live with anybody
[1:18:28] else they stayed separated to themselves
[1:18:31] praise god
[1:18:32] i remember this years ago john or john i
[1:18:35] don't know if you went but john graham
[1:18:36] and i and our families went to this
[1:18:37] pentecostal church on a new year's eve
[1:18:39] we met with them and
[1:18:41] they liked some of our sermons online
[1:18:44] and i said well brother i said why are
[1:18:45] you in the pentecostal denomination
[1:18:47] and he said we're in here we don't like
[1:18:48] the organization but we're in here for
[1:18:50] fellowship
[1:18:52] and i tried to tell him i said
[1:18:53] organizations are not of god
[1:18:55] but he just kind of went on and we lost
[1:18:57] our friendship uh we lost our
[1:18:58] relationship but just kind of
[1:19:00] went off but see part of being a real
[1:19:03] believer is being
[1:19:04] alone right we don't want to mix with
[1:19:08] those churches
[1:19:09] because we're going to mix and get some
[1:19:10] bad ideas from them
[1:19:12] they're going to rub us the wrong way
[1:19:14] right
[1:19:15] and so there's part of us we don't like
[1:19:18] to be alone
[1:19:19] but we have to be alone and then when
[1:19:22] we're here we're really not alone
[1:19:23] because jesus is with us
[1:19:24] and we have the saints here praise god
[1:19:26] amen
[1:19:28] so it's like we're alone from them but
[1:19:29] we got plenty of fellowship with god and
[1:19:31] his people
[1:19:33] he said and shall not be reckoned among
[1:19:35] the nations god purposely said don't you
[1:19:37] go mix back in with those nations
[1:19:38] you stay separate you stay alone so say
[1:19:41] see being alone is a good thing
[1:19:44] as long as jesus is with you it's a good
[1:19:45] thing praise god amen
[1:19:47] he said who can count the dust of jacob
[1:19:49] and the number of the fourth part of
[1:19:50] israel
[1:19:51] let me die the death of the righteous
[1:19:54] look at this mercy and let my last and
[1:19:56] be like his
[1:19:59] look at balaam look at this church he
[1:20:01] had a desire to be saved
[1:20:03] he was lost right we know he's lost
[1:20:05] because ii peter 3 he says that
[1:20:07] but he had a desire when he looked at
[1:20:08] god's people he said who ca look how
[1:20:11] look at them
[1:20:12] he said let me die the death of the
[1:20:13] righteous lest my
[1:20:15] last and be like his so see people see
[1:20:18] people want to be like you
[1:20:19] a lot of churches want to be like you
[1:20:21] but guess what a few months later what
[1:20:23] happened
[1:20:24] he got that money temptation right he
[1:20:26] went off
[1:20:27] uh to the feast of bao pior and he got
[1:20:30] 24
[1:20:31] 000 men to commit fornication and they
[1:20:33] died
[1:20:34] before the lord 24 000.
[1:20:37] so look at this look how people are so
[1:20:39] close he was so close to being saved
[1:20:43] but then he must have because of the
[1:20:44] money he must have crossed the line
[1:20:46] between mercy
[1:20:47] and judgment
[1:20:52] uh how many people i mean how many times
[1:20:54] have you heard such a holy statement is
[1:20:55] that
[1:20:56] let me die the death of the righteous in
[1:20:58] other words let me die like
[1:21:00] a holy man let me give my life for jesus
[1:21:02] christ in other words
[1:21:03] that be for us look at those words
[1:21:08] we see how money can take us away from
[1:21:10] our pure desires
[1:21:13] money just more money
[1:21:16] takes us away from wanting to die let me
[1:21:17] die like a saint to
[1:21:20] ah maybe i'll trick him into uh
[1:21:22] committing sin so i can get some more
[1:21:24] money in my pocket i can be a rich man
[1:21:30] and uh remember the the sinners want to
[1:21:32] be like you because remember
[1:21:33] even pharaoh he said take your flocks
[1:21:36] and your herds
[1:21:37] and he said bless me also but you know
[1:21:39] he wasn't gonna be blessed see
[1:21:42] sinners they know you're living right
[1:21:44] thank god amen
[1:21:45] you are a city on a hill that cannot be
[1:21:48] hidden praise god
[1:21:50] and they know you live a godly life they
[1:21:51] know you live a righteous life and they
[1:21:53] want to be like you but they can't be
[1:21:54] like you
[1:21:56] because they surrender to the lust of
[1:21:57] the flesh the pride of life and lust of
[1:21:58] the eyes
[1:22:00] but even pharaoh said bless me with some
[1:22:02] of that blessing
[1:22:04] no the only way to get that is to obey
[1:22:07] god's word
[1:22:09] amen you want god's blessing you've got
[1:22:10] to come god's provided away
[1:22:12] amen pharaoh you want god's blessing you
[1:22:14] better go get the passover lamb
[1:22:16] hallelujah praise god amen you better
[1:22:19] obey the prophet's message
[1:22:21] you want the you want the prophet's
[1:22:22] blessing you better obey the prophet's
[1:22:24] message
[1:22:26] in the word see one of god's blessing
[1:22:30] we don't want to meet god's conditions
[1:22:34] see it's just simple obedience it all
[1:22:36] comes down to
[1:22:38] i like that quote from the preacher uh
[1:22:40] his name's derek prince
[1:22:41] he says really you don't need to chase
[1:22:43] the blessings amen
[1:22:44] hallelujah what you need to do is meet
[1:22:47] the conditions
[1:22:48] god takes care of the blessings amen
[1:22:52] i don't know church i must be in a
[1:22:53] financial season where god's blessing me
[1:22:55] financially i had a brother calling me
[1:22:56] up from illinois yesterday brother bank
[1:22:58] he's like for five years i'm enjoying
[1:22:59] your videos he said i'm sending you 500
[1:23:02] to support your ministry i don't know it
[1:23:04] just seems like remember i got a i got
[1:23:06] two checks in the mail lately three four
[1:23:07] checks in the mail just uh
[1:23:09] there's this money coming i must need it
[1:23:10] for something
[1:23:12] probably like the bob said i'll probably
[1:23:13] fly away pretty soon right brother bang
[1:23:16] but it's just like it's just coming so
[1:23:18] there must be a purpose for it
[1:23:21] but see we don't have to worry about the
[1:23:23] blessings worry about the word of god
[1:23:25] amen
[1:23:26] can be concerned about your relationship
[1:23:29] your sensitivity to the holy spirit
[1:23:31] and then god will take care of the
[1:23:32] blessings i'll say like this
[1:23:35] in that fellowship of amen you'll find
[1:23:37] the blessing
[1:23:38] that's a greater blessing than money
[1:23:40] praise god that fellowship that peace
[1:23:42] that passes our understanding that's
[1:23:44] more of a blessing than the money praise
[1:23:46] god amen
[1:23:48] hallelujah or whatever desire
[1:23:51] car house clothes whatever you need
[1:23:53] whatever you need
[1:23:55] the the fellowship with christ is much
[1:23:57] greater than those other extra blessings
[1:24:01] i'd rather have a church brother bank
[1:24:03] where i don't have to deal with people
[1:24:04] sleeping around
[1:24:05] getting drunk at communion can you
[1:24:08] imagine that
[1:24:10] you imagine i walked in here drunk i
[1:24:12] like to serve the lord's
[1:24:14] the lord's supper but i'm stumbling
[1:24:16] around
[1:24:18] because i was drinking the wine in there
[1:24:19] before the service
[1:24:21] what who could who could have any
[1:24:23] confidence in god
[1:24:24] who could have any peace in their heart
[1:24:29] i think it's so special that we have
[1:24:32] god's love here don't you think so
[1:24:34] yeah that we have a real love for god a
[1:24:36] real obedience to god
[1:24:39] a desire to serve him and pleasing to
[1:24:41] diligently obey the word of god i think
[1:24:44] that's such a treasure
[1:24:45] it really is now he continues the lord
[1:24:49] met balaam put a word in his mouth
[1:24:51] gogin to balak say thus and he took the
[1:24:53] parable rise up
[1:24:54] balak and here hearken unto me thou son
[1:24:56] of the poor
[1:24:58] god is not a man that he should lie
[1:24:59] neither the son of man that he should
[1:25:00] repent
[1:25:01] he has said and shall he not do it or
[1:25:03] have he spoken and shall not he make it
[1:25:06] good
[1:25:06] amen behold i have received commandment
[1:25:09] to bless
[1:25:09] and he hath blessed it and i cannot
[1:25:12] reverse it
[1:25:13] amen amen look at this he hath not
[1:25:16] beheld iniquity in jacob why brother
[1:25:19] tells us
[1:25:20] because of the lamb because of the blood
[1:25:23] praise god god doesn't behold our
[1:25:26] our purposeful sins because of a
[1:25:29] sacrifice
[1:25:33] neither have he seen perverseness in
[1:25:35] israel
[1:25:37] yet i can show you the scripture i can
[1:25:38] show you the 10 times
[1:25:41] where israel complained against god and
[1:25:44] god said because of these 10 times
[1:25:45] you're not going to promise land
[1:25:47] that's actually before this but yet
[1:25:50] over as a whole god looked at the group
[1:25:52] overall he says i haven't beheld
[1:25:54] it i haven't seen it
[1:25:57] he says because the blood the lord his
[1:25:59] god
[1:26:00] is with him and the shout of joy
[1:26:04] of a king is among them
[1:26:08] so this is what god tells balaam to tell
[1:26:10] baalik he was a
[1:26:11] man calls him an old intellectual church
[1:26:13] member
[1:26:14] who didn't believe in shouting and
[1:26:16] praising god he said tell them
[1:26:18] that god doesn't see their iniquity god
[1:26:20] doesn't see their sin because they're
[1:26:21] forgiven
[1:26:22] he said and they have the shout of joy
[1:26:25] in their camp that's what this message
[1:26:27] is
[1:26:27] that's what this message produces it
[1:26:29] produces happiness
[1:26:30] it produces joy it produces victory
[1:26:33] blessings and it keeps us from the
[1:26:35] curses and it makes us want to praise
[1:26:37] god more
[1:26:38] oh hallelujah thank you jesus it
[1:26:41] produces joy in their lives
[1:26:45] and god says that's one of the proofs
[1:26:48] that i'm with these people
[1:26:50] because they have a shout of joy among
[1:26:52] them
[1:26:53] praise god so you're all used to it now
[1:26:56] i just scream and shout all the time
[1:26:57] during song service right
[1:26:59] you know i do that because i got the
[1:27:00] shot of the king in the camp praise god
[1:27:02] i'm living in victory now if i was
[1:27:04] living in my sins
[1:27:05] or living in curses that'd be different
[1:27:07] i probably feel a lot different
[1:27:09] but when i when i please god love god
[1:27:11] and obey god and repent and all these
[1:27:12] things
[1:27:13] and i come to church i hear him sing
[1:27:14] about knowing god more praising god he's
[1:27:16] the king of my heart
[1:27:17] what else can i do let's shout and say
[1:27:19] thank you you are the king of my heart
[1:27:21] praise god
[1:27:22] you are the king of my life jesus christ
[1:27:24] is my king
[1:27:25] amen how can i not praise him
[1:27:29] how can i not lift my voice and wear it
[1:27:32] out for his glory
[1:27:37] god brought them out of egypt he hath as
[1:27:40] it were the strength
[1:27:42] of a unicorn now look the joy of the
[1:27:45] lord is your
[1:27:46] strength according to nehemiah so look
[1:27:49] how it's connected you want to be strong
[1:27:50] in the lord
[1:27:51] get happy about what jesus did get happy
[1:27:54] jesus died for your sins
[1:27:55] get happy jesus sent your sins away
[1:27:57] praise god
[1:27:58] get happy he sent the holy ghost ready
[1:28:00] get happy
[1:28:01] realize what we got praise god amen
[1:28:05] the joy of the lord why can't i be
[1:28:08] stronger at work why can't i be stronger
[1:28:09] my family
[1:28:10] we need the joy of the lord we need a
[1:28:12] shout we got to shout to god
[1:28:14] and praise god and recognize what he's
[1:28:16] done he's brought us out of egypt
[1:28:20] i was one of those brother johnny that
[1:28:22] the holy spirit said come out of babylon
[1:28:24] come on in my come out of her my people
[1:28:27] come out of the assemblies of god
[1:28:29] that shall be not a partaker of her sins
[1:28:31] and pledge and i'll receive you saith
[1:28:33] the lord praise god
[1:28:34] i was one of those that heard it praise
[1:28:36] god i came out and i'm glad i did and i
[1:28:38] ain't going back i'm here to stay i'm
[1:28:42] out here all alone
[1:28:44] here to stay with god and his blessings
[1:28:46] hallelujah
[1:28:47] thank you jesus i'll keep shouting for
[1:28:50] jesus praise god not for denomination
[1:28:52] not for a creed but for the word of god
[1:28:54] for jesus christ the living god
[1:29:02] so if you're weak you better start
[1:29:03] praising god
[1:29:06] he inhabits the praises not the
[1:29:08] complaints he habits the praises of his
[1:29:11] people
[1:29:12] amen right
[1:29:15] the praises and in that praise his
[1:29:18] presence comes
[1:29:19] in his presence is the fullness of joy
[1:29:22] the fullness of strength
[1:29:26] see they were peculiar so are we
[1:29:30] and we have treasure and earth and
[1:29:32] vessels remember the bible said
[1:29:33] if you will obey my voice and keep my
[1:29:35] covenant you'll be a peculiar treasure
[1:29:37] unto me above
[1:29:38] all people for the earth is all the
[1:29:40] earth is mine
[1:29:42] now it sounds like israel's god's
[1:29:43] favorite or dearly beloved she was by
[1:29:46] god's foreknowledge
[1:29:48] god espoused israel or engaged israel to
[1:29:51] himself
[1:29:52] in ezekiel 16 verse 8.
[1:29:56] so see israel was his treasure

[1:30:15] the house of the lord and the courts of
[1:30:16] the house of god
[1:30:17] praise the lord sometimes church i'm
[1:30:21] convinced
[1:30:21] maybe some of us are singing but we're
[1:30:23] not praising
[1:30:25] are you with me and i'm guilty too when
[1:30:27] i you know i have battles and things
[1:30:28] like that we're all guilty
[1:30:30] but i don't want to just sing i want to
[1:30:32] praise him amen
[1:30:34] praise him and praise and say thank you
[1:30:37] jesus i said hi
[1:30:38] you're the king of my heart you're
[1:30:40] you're you're my own all
[1:30:41] you're my king and my god my my lord
[1:30:45] praise him praise the lord for he is
[1:30:49] good sing praises unto his name
[1:30:52] for it's pleasant why don't you feel
[1:30:53] pleasant at home it's time to sing
[1:30:55] praises to him
[1:30:57] that's what the bible says this is where
[1:30:59] the certain sister from don south keeps
[1:31:00] texting me
[1:31:02] same thing pray for me perfect i'm
[1:31:04] discouraged i'm depressed i said praise
[1:31:05] him
[1:31:07] praise him bob says praise him
[1:31:11] and don't say it one time keep saying
[1:31:13] over and over to the real praises
[1:31:15] start flowing from your soul
[1:31:21] for the lord so why should we praise him
[1:31:23] four for this for the lord have chosen
[1:31:26] bang unto himself and bride of christ
[1:31:30] fellowship
[1:31:31] for his peculiar treasure
[1:31:32] [Music]
[1:31:35] oh you don't think that applies to man
[1:31:36] it does apply to ben
[1:31:38] peter says it applies to vain he says
[1:31:41] you which believe in jesus
[1:31:43] are a chosen generation a royal
[1:31:46] priesthood a holy nation ah
[1:31:48] peculiar so let's go back and put your
[1:31:52] name in it
[1:31:52] as well as banks for the lord have
[1:31:55] chosen amen
[1:31:56] i can use these brothers because i kind
[1:31:57] of pick on them a little bit but they
[1:31:59] know i love them right
[1:32:00] guys i never hurt you in any way but
[1:32:03] lord i've chosen
[1:32:04] malachi unto himself i can pick on my
[1:32:07] kids too
[1:32:09] but the guy that chosen jose unto
[1:32:11] himself and
[1:32:12] israel for his special treasure
[1:32:16] why because you believe in his son
[1:32:19] you believe and he is precious to you
[1:32:24] see church there was a time when we were
[1:32:26] not a people but
[1:32:27] now we are god's people like i was
[1:32:30] saying to vayne
[1:32:31] he's born again he has a if he if he's
[1:32:34] got god's life there
[1:32:36] then that life is a part of god and so
[1:32:38] he's a person of god
[1:32:40] he's of the family the body of jesus
[1:32:43] christ
[1:32:44] i must treat him with utmost respect
[1:32:48] which had not obtained mercy but now we
[1:32:51] have mercy
[1:32:52] how much time i got like i got two
[1:32:54] minutes okay so maybe everything
[1:32:56] i'm enjoying this are you enjoying this
[1:33:00] i can see how i'm blessed to be god by
[1:33:01] god's grace
[1:33:03] i can see the blessings of god and
[1:33:05] that's why i want to remain
[1:33:06] church amen i don't want to leave the
[1:33:09] land
[1:33:09] i want to stay right here i want to stay
[1:33:12] right
[1:33:13] in the blessings of god almighty
[1:33:17] for we don't preach ourselves but jesus
[1:33:20] christ jesus the lord
[1:33:21] and ourselves your servants for jesus
[1:33:23] sake for god who command the light to
[1:33:25] shine out of darkness
[1:33:26] has shined where in our hearts to give
[1:33:29] the light of the knowledge of the glory
[1:33:30] of god in the face of jesus christ
[1:33:32] but we have this treasure in earthen
[1:33:35] vessels
[1:33:37] that the excellency of the power may be
[1:33:39] of god and not of us
[1:33:42] so what power do you have god himself i
[1:33:45] have god's treasure in my life
[1:33:48] it's not my power it's his power it's
[1:33:50] his treasure it's his spirit praise god
[1:33:52] no wonder the bible said they were a
[1:33:54] peculiar treasure because now
[1:33:56] we are the treasure because we have
[1:33:58] god's life inside of our souls
[1:34:01] can you see that israel was a treasure
[1:34:03] but now we're a peculiar treasure unto
[1:34:05] god
[1:34:06] because we allow god's spirit to reign
[1:34:08] over our lives
[1:34:13] in church we're troubled on every side
[1:34:14] yet not distressed we're perplexed but
[1:34:16] not in despair we're persecuted but not
[1:34:19] forsaken
[1:34:19] this is the scripture right after that
[1:34:21] the previous one cast down but not
[1:34:23] destroyed
[1:34:24] always bearing about in the body of the
[1:34:26] dying of the lord jesus that the life
[1:34:28] also of jesus
[1:34:29] might be made manifest in our body i'm
[1:34:31] skipping that last verse
[1:34:33] see our lives are a paradox it's this
[1:34:34] holy spirit against the flesh
[1:34:38] and we always show christ his life and
[1:34:41] his death when we take up our cross we
[1:34:44] show his death
[1:34:46] so see church possessing god's treasure
[1:34:48] keeps your troubles from distressing you
[1:34:51] why aren't you distressed brother jesse
[1:34:53] what you had covered why aren't you
[1:34:54] distressed because i've got god's
[1:34:56] treasure in my heart
[1:35:00] you're you have perplexities but they
[1:35:02] don't cause you despair because you've
[1:35:03] still got treasure
[1:35:06] you have persecutions people say all
[1:35:09] kinds of things about you
[1:35:10] but i don't feel forsaken so i've got
[1:35:13] god's treasure
[1:35:15] i fall sometimes but i'm not destroyed
[1:35:18] because i've got god's treasure in my
[1:35:19] heart
[1:35:21] that's what the scripture says that's
[1:35:22] the whole point that's the passage
[1:35:25] we have we have all these trials but
[1:35:27] we've still got god's treasure so in
[1:35:28] other words we can live with it
[1:35:30] and we can overcome it by god's grace
[1:35:32] that's the anorphy
[1:35:38] now as we're standing let me read this
[1:35:42] amen there is no curse against
[1:35:45] you okay we're gonna get to this lord
[1:35:48] willing maybe tonight
[1:35:49] jezebel sister now we tried to curse
[1:35:51] elijah he's like
[1:35:52] she's like i'm gonna kill him by the end
[1:35:54] of the day
[1:35:57] but did that happen did that curse work
[1:36:00] didn't work at all elijah went out there
[1:36:03] found a little juniper tree
[1:36:04] and god said send the angels with the
[1:36:06] softest hands up there
[1:36:08] and go give him food that he's gonna
[1:36:09] live off of for 40 days see
[1:36:12] people can try to curse you all they all
[1:36:13] they want but it ain't gonna work
[1:36:14] because you're under the blood of jesus
[1:36:16] christ
[1:36:17] you're under the blessings of god let
[1:36:19] them say whatever they want
[1:36:20] they curse you you bless them because
[1:36:24] maybe in the blessing
[1:36:25] they'll humble themselves and receive
[1:36:27] christ
[1:36:30] brother amen and brother bang there's no
[1:36:33] divination against you nobody can
[1:36:36] try to work up some type of a curse to
[1:36:39] try to curse you
[1:36:43] according at this time it should be said
[1:36:45] of jacob in israel
[1:36:47] what hath god wrought see this is what
[1:36:50] bana was telling
[1:36:51] the the king bala he said look you can't
[1:36:55] curse them you can't put anything on
[1:36:56] them
[1:36:57] they can do all the enchantments they
[1:36:58] want you can't curse them
[1:37:00] because they are god's workmanship
[1:37:05] now i couldn't make one of these but if
[1:37:07] this was god's workmanship he just make
[1:37:09] sure it's smooth and
[1:37:10] you know it worked and all the buttons
