[0:03] but yet a church without a doctrine
[0:05] is just like
[0:07] a jellyfish that has no backbone
[0:12] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:14] of the lord jesus christ
[0:16] is doctrine important or necessary for
[0:19] all christians
[0:21] and for christians who follow the
[0:22] bible-based message
[0:24] of god's prophet william branham
[0:26] the answer is an emphatic yes especially
[0:30] when you understand the definition of
[0:31] doctrine
[0:32] all the bible references regarding it
[0:35] and quotes from god's prophet brother
[0:37] william branham
[0:39] as you heard in the opening brother
[0:40] branham said churches without doctrine
[0:43] are like jellyfish with no stability no
[0:46] spiritual backbone
[0:48] where might brother branham have got the
[0:50] inspiration for this jellyfish quote
[0:53] i'm not sure but it's likely from
[0:55] ephesians 4 verses 8 through 16
[0:59] because the five-fold ministry brings
[1:01] holy ghost-filled saints to perfection
[1:04] or spiritual completion
[1:06] but the lack of the doctrine heard from
[1:08] the fivefold ministry keeps believers in
[1:10] a state of spiritual immaturity as the
[1:13] bible said they'd be tossed by every
[1:15] wind of doctrine
[1:17] ephesians 4 verse 14 and doctrines of
[1:19] devils would permeate their churches
[1:22] according to first timothy 4 verse 1.
[1:25] true doctrine or sound doctrine gives
[1:27] spiritual health
[1:28] strength and stability to the saints
[1:32] here's the outline for this video
[1:34] first we'll look at defining doctrine
[1:36] and contrasting it with general
[1:38] preaching
[1:40] second bible proof supporting the
[1:42] necessity of doctrine
[1:44] third quotes from brother branham
[1:46] supporting doctrine and teaching
[1:48] fourth the ecumenical attack on true
[1:51] doctrine
[1:53] and fifth addressing misconceptions
[1:55] about doctrine
[1:58] let's define doctrine and contrast it
[2:01] with preaching
[2:03] in the greek lexicon doctrine is defined
[2:06] as instruction teaching precepts or
[2:09] commands
[2:10] doctrine is closely related to teaching
[2:12] since teaching means to hold discourse
[2:15] with others in order to instruct them
[2:17] and to teach one to impart instruction
[2:21] instill doctrine into one as the greek
[2:24] definition states
[2:26] these two closely related words
[2:28] have the following two greek words
[2:31] in the greek doctrine is
[2:33] did escala and of course i may be saying
[2:35] that wrong
[2:36] it's used 21 times in the new testament
[2:39] the greek word for teaching is didasco
[2:42] and that's used 91 times in the new
[2:44] testament
[2:45] so we can clearly see how doctrine and
[2:47] teaching are closely related and the
[2:49] holy spirit emphasizes the importance of
[2:51] these two greek words over 110 times in
[2:55] the new testament looking at the word
[2:57] preach in particular in the greek preach
[3:00] means to bring good news declare joyful
[3:03] tidings of god's kindness in particular
[3:05] of the messianic blessings it's used 60
[3:08] times the new testament
[3:10] although doctrine seems it could be a
[3:12] type of preaching there are numerous
[3:14] scriptures that contrast doctrine and
[3:16] preaching
[3:17] second timothy 4 verse 2
[3:20] makes it seem like doctrine could be a
[3:21] type of preaching because it says preach
[3:24] the word be instant in season out of
[3:26] season reprove rebuke exhort with all
[3:30] longsuffering and doctrine
[3:32] as i've studied doctrine and preaching i
[3:34] found a stark contrast because doctrine
[3:37] is instruction what believers should do
[3:40] while preaching is announcing or
[3:42] declaring what jesus has done and will
[3:45] do
[3:46] so again doctrine is what you should do
[3:49] and preaching is what god has done or
[3:51] will do
[3:53] bible examples that prove this are
[3:55] matthew 4 verse 23 jesus did both
[3:58] preaching and teaching and jesus went
[4:01] about all galilee teaching in their
[4:03] synagogues and preaching the gospel of
[4:05] the kingdom and healing all manner of
[4:07] sickness and all manner of disease among
[4:09] the people
[4:11] the disciples did both preaching and
[4:13] teaching as well according to acts 5
[4:15] verse 42
[4:16] and daily in the temple and in every
[4:18] house they ceased not to teach and
[4:20] preach jesus christ
[4:22] acts 15 35 paul also and barnabas
[4:26] continued in antioch teaching and
[4:28] preaching the word of the lord with many
[4:31] others also
[4:33] and acts 28 31 preaching the kingdom of
[4:36] god and teaching those things which
[4:38] concern the lord jesus christ with all
[4:41] confidence no man forbidding him
[4:44] another clear example is luke 3 verses
[4:47] 15-17
[4:49] in these scriptures john the baptist was
[4:51] preaching jesus's future works he said
[4:54] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[4:56] and with fire
[4:58] and will gather the we into his garner
[5:01] and then luke 3 verse 18 says and many
[5:03] other things in his exhortation
[5:06] preached he unto the people
[5:09] so notice john the baptist did not give
[5:11] any instruction or teaching in this text
[5:14] he simply published or declared what he
[5:16] was called to do and what god and jesus
[5:19] would do in the future
[5:21] with this understanding i was recently
[5:23] corrected by a viewer which i appreciate
[5:26] the correction the viewer noted how i
[5:28] called serpent seed a doctrine
[5:30] and said it wasn't a doctrine
[5:32] he was correct because the serpent seed
[5:34] revelation does not instruct believers
[5:37] to do anything
[5:38] so i want to thank my viewers who
[5:40] provide correction for me
[5:42] and i always want to be open to
[5:43] correction as a humble servant of the
[5:45] lord jesus christ
[5:48] bible proof supporting the necessity of
[5:50] doctrine friends the necessity of true
[5:53] doctrine can hardly be overemphasized
[5:57] in summary a church that possesses and
[5:59] teaches true doctrine is a sign
[6:02] the leaders and members are baptized
[6:04] with the holy ghost as true children of
[6:07] god
[6:08] according to second john 1 verses 9
[6:11] through 11 matthew 24 24
[6:14] john 6 verse 45 and john 16 verse
[6:18] 13. listen carefully to second john 1
[6:21] verse 9
[6:23] whosoever transgresseth and abideth not
[6:26] in the doctrine of christ
[6:28] hath not god
[6:29] he that abideth in the doctrine of
[6:31] christ he hath both the father and the
[6:34] son
[6:35] so the holy spirit wrote through saint
[6:37] john that whoever abided in the doctrine
[6:40] had christ and the father
[6:43] this must mean if you abide in true
[6:45] teaching that proves you have the
[6:47] baptism of the holy ghost and the
[6:49] opposite is true as well
[6:51] with the wrong doctrine you do not have
[6:53] christ and the father you do not have
[6:55] the baptism of the holy ghost
[6:58] matthew 24 verse 24 says in so much that
[7:00] if it were possible they shall deceive
[7:03] the very elect
[7:04] so we understand from jesus's words the
[7:07] elect cannot be deceived with false
[7:09] doctrine
[7:10] john 6 45 says it is written in the
[7:13] prophets and they shall be all taught of
[7:15] god
[7:16] every man therefore that hath heard and
[7:18] hath learned of the father cometh unto
[7:20] me
[7:21] so this proves all that are taught of
[7:23] god are the children of god and of
[7:25] course they would be taught the true
[7:27] doctrine by their father and through his
[7:29] son the lord jesus christ
[7:31] john 16 13 said how be it when he the
[7:34] spirit of truth is come he will guide
[7:36] you into all truth
[7:38] so jesus's words promise if we have the
[7:41] baptism of the holy ghost they'll guide
[7:43] us into true doctrine
[7:45] let's overview jesus doctrine paul and
[7:48] the apostles doctrine and deadly effects
[7:50] of false doctrine or doctrines of devils
[7:54] regarding jesus many people do not
[7:56] understand that jesus was known for both
[7:59] power and doctrine because the pharisees
[8:02] sadducees and other religious sects of
[8:04] his day were powerless and held false
[8:07] doctrines or traditions of men
[8:10] numerous scriptures reveal christ
[8:12] jesus's power flowed through him because
[8:15] of his authoritative doctrine that he
[8:18] received from god the father
[8:20] in john 7 verses 16 and 17 jesus
[8:24] doctrine was not his own but the fathers
[8:26] those who obeyed the doctrine would know
[8:28] it was from god
[8:30] the same is true today those who follow
[8:32] jesus doctrine or instruction
[8:35] will know it's from god because of the
[8:36] results that it bears
[8:39] in mark 4 verse 2 even jesus's parables
[8:42] were doctrine because they gave
[8:44] instructions on how to live
[8:46] such as jesus instruction to keep a good
[8:48] and honest heart in his parable of the
[8:50] four grounds and the sower
[8:53] jesus gave us instruction on how to live
[8:55] a fruitful life with the fruits of the
[8:57] holy spirit keep a good and honest heart
[9:01] in matthew chapters 5 through 7 and also
[9:04] chapter 7 verse 28 people were
[9:06] astonished at jesus doctrine which
[9:09] included teaching about marriage and
[9:10] divorce how to be married in obedience
[9:13] according to the instruction of jesus
[9:15] christ
[9:16] there are many other doctrinal
[9:17] statements in jesus sermon on the mount
[9:20] so friends doctrine cannot be ignored or
[9:23] downplayed because adulterers who
[9:26] disobey jesus's teaching on marriage and
[9:28] divorce will not inherit the kingdom of
[9:30] god
[9:31] so jesus gave us marriage doctrine on
[9:34] how to be married in a god honoring way
[9:37] and remember your decision about
[9:39] marriage is your second most important
[9:41] decision in life so having the right
[9:43] doctrine regarding marriage and divorce
[9:46] is extremely important
[9:48] for obedience to that doctrine of
[9:50] marriage and divorce will allow you to
[9:51] eventually become part of the kingdom of
[9:53] jesus christ
[9:55] at the high priest house jesus said he
[9:57] did not hide his doctrine but openly
[10:00] taught it to the world yet churches went
[10:02] to keep doctrine out of their sermons
[10:05] which is extremely sad
[10:07] john 18 verses 19 through 20 says jesus
[10:10] doctrine was preached openly to the
[10:12] world as he was teaching in the
[10:14] synagogue and temple
[10:16] in mark 11 verse 18 the scribes sought
[10:19] to kill jesus and feared him because of
[10:21] his doctrine
[10:22] and in one of his doctrines he called
[10:24] them a den of thieves
[10:26] jesus power flowed through his doctrine
[10:29] in mark 1 verse 27 they ask what new
[10:32] doctrine is this
[10:33] they saw jesus authority to cast out
[10:35] devils which was a new doctrine as also
[10:38] matthew 10 verse 8 proves because jesus
[10:41] taught his disciples to cast out devils
[10:44] and again casting out devils was a
[10:46] doctrine because there is a how-to or
[10:48] instruction on how to cast out devils
[10:51] for example jesus said some only come
[10:53] out by prayer and fasting
[10:56] luke 4 verses 32 and 33 said they were
[10:58] astonished at jesus doctrine because his
[11:01] word was with power in relation to
[11:03] casting out devils
[11:05] matthew 22 verse 33 and mark 1 verse 22
[11:09] say the multitudes were again astonished
[11:11] at jesus doctrine regarding our
[11:14] theophany bodies like angels and we'll
[11:16] have these theophanies after death and
[11:18] how we'll have no sexual relations in
[11:20] heaven according to jesus's doctrine
[11:23] jesus great commission said teach all
[11:25] nations in matthew 28 so he was saying
[11:28] his apostles were to give them sound
[11:30] doctrine and not doctrines of devils
[11:33] so doctrine and power are both part of
[11:35] the great commission because in mark
[11:37] chapter 16 jesus said these signs will
[11:39] follow them that believe and listed all
[11:42] the supernatural power the holy ghost
[11:44] would give to true believers like
[11:46] speaking in new tongues casting out
[11:48] devils
[11:49] taking up serpents and it wouldn't harm
[11:50] them and all the wonderful supernatural
[11:53] blessings christ authorized for his
[11:55] church
[11:56] jesus gave warnings about false doctrine
[11:59] in matthew 15 verse 9 he said doctrines
[12:01] of men produce vain worship or
[12:04] traditions of men
[12:05] in matthew 16 12 he said the doctrine of
[12:08] the pharisees was leaven
[12:10] and leaven always represents sin in the
[12:12] bible
[12:13] in mark 12 38 in jesus doctrine he said
[12:17] beware of the scribes
[12:19] notice that jesus either loves the
[12:21] doctrine of the church or hates the
[12:22] church's doctrine according to
[12:24] revelation 2 verse 14 and 15
[12:27] here jesus hated the doctrine of the
[12:29] nicolaitans he also hated the doctrine
[12:31] of balaam because it was a stumbling
[12:33] block of fornication
[12:36] again jesus hated the doctrine of
[12:37] jezebel in revelation 2 verse 24 saying
[12:40] it was the depths of satan
[12:42] which included fornication and idolatry
[12:46] for bible and message believers this
[12:48] should remind us of how false doctrine
[12:50] enters a church
[12:51] the revelation of the first four seals
[12:53] shows how the antichrist spirit rides
[12:55] into churches through false doctrines
[12:58] the first seal teaches that the white
[13:00] horse rider uses deeds of the
[13:01] nicolaitans to begin deceiving churches
[13:04] which are simply sayings
[13:06] those sayings or traditions of men soon
[13:08] become doctrines
[13:10] or the unbending ways of the deceived
[13:12] churches
[13:13] thus in the first four seals we see
[13:15] god's anointings to overcome the
[13:18] antichrist's sinful progression
[13:20] god's anointing is like a lion bold
[13:24] an ox sacrificial a man his wisdom and
[13:27] an eagle a prophetic revelation watching
[13:30] and praying
[13:31] satan uses the white horse or false
[13:33] teaching then moves to the red horse
[13:35] killing those who oppose him in our day
[13:38] it's mostly killing the influence of the
[13:39] true believers but also manifests itself
[13:42] in the worldly physical persecution of
[13:45] christians
[13:46] it then moves to the black horse
[13:48] a money capturing ministry building its
[13:50] own earthly headquarters or kingdom
[13:53] lastly it ends in spiritual death which
[13:55] can be blasphemy of the holy ghost or
[13:58] taking the mark of the beast like first
[14:00] timothy 5 6 teaches
[14:02] these terrors are spiritually dead while
[14:04] living in worldly pleasures while
[14:06] physically alive
[14:11] as you can see i'm recording the
[14:12] remainder of this video at a later time
[14:15] now regarding the doctrine of paul and
[14:17] the apostles we begin in the book of
[14:19] acts
[14:20] in acts 2 verse 42
[14:22] the disciples had steadfast continuance
[14:25] in doctrine and fellowship with the
[14:27] apostles
[14:28] in acts 5 verse 28 the apostles filled
[14:30] jerusalem with their doctrine
[14:32] which means the powerful signs wonders
[14:34] and miracles of the holy ghost simply
[14:36] followed them after they taught the
[14:38] doctrine of the lord
[14:40] like in mark 16 verses 17 and 20.
[14:44] also in acts 5
[14:46] 19-21 the angel told them to go teach
[14:49] in the temple the words of this life
[14:53] so the angel of the lord commanded the
[14:54] apostles that doctrine must be taught in
[14:58] acts 13 verses 11 and 12 the deputy was
[15:02] astonished by the doctrine of the lord
[15:04] that blinded elimus the sorcerer and
[15:07] notice both jesus and the apostles had
[15:10] such astonishing doctrine vindicated by
[15:12] supernatural power
[15:14] i've seen that in my own life there was
[15:16] a brother from columbus who
[15:18] witnessed some miracles that were done
[15:19] after i preached
[15:21] and he left the meeting astonished that
[15:23] the holy ghost had done such wonderful
[15:25] works through the preaching of the
[15:27] revelation of the message of this hour
[15:29] in romans 6 verses 16 and 17 the bible
[15:32] says we should be servants of
[15:34] righteousness and obey the doctrine from
[15:37] the heart
[15:38] in romans 16 verse 17 the bible says
[15:41] teachers of false doctrine are to be
[15:43] avoided and their false doctrine proves
[15:45] they serve their own bellies and not the
[15:48] lord
[15:49] in first corinthians 14 verse 6 the
[15:51] bible says tongues can profit us by
[15:53] giving us doctrine revelation and
[15:56] prophecy
[15:57] in first corinthians 14 26 paul
[16:00] complemented the church of corinth and
[16:02] said everyone had a doctrine tongue
[16:04] psalm
[16:05] revelation etc
[16:07] in ephesians 4 verse 14 paul says those
[16:10] outside the five full ministry are
[16:12] tossed like spiritual children and
[16:15] easily deceived so without the true
[16:17] doctrine of the fivefold ministry people
[16:19] remain
[16:20] spiritual children and get swayed back
[16:22] and forth between all kinds of false
[16:24] doctrine
[16:25] in first timothy 1 verses 3 through 11
[16:28] paul said teach no other doctrine so if
[16:30] you combine this thought with galatians
[16:32] 1 verses 6 through 12 wherein paul said
[16:35] you're cursed if you change one thing
[16:37] about the gospel that jesus christ gave
[16:39] to paul you again see the necessity of
[16:42] having true doctrine
[16:44] in 1st timothy chapter 1 paul lists sins
[16:46] that were contrary to sound doctrine in
[16:49] the greek sound means in good health so
[16:51] true doctrine produces good spiritual
[16:54] health while false doctrine produces
[16:56] spiritual sickness
[16:58] in first timothy 4 verses 6 through 16
[17:01] paul mentions doctrine three times
[17:04] says we should be nourished in doctrine
[17:06] and that doctrine saves both the
[17:07] preacher and the hearers
[17:10] in first timothy 5 17 paul says god will
[17:13] give double honor to those who labor in
[17:15] doctrine
[17:16] in first timothy 6 verses 1 through 5
[17:20] paul said servants who dishonor their
[17:22] masters blasphemed the doctrine of
[17:24] christ
[17:26] he also said teachers of false doctrine
[17:28] are proud people or they're filled with
[17:30] the spirit of pride in second timothy 3
[17:33] verse 1 and verses 10 through 13 paul
[17:36] said perilous times are here and they're
[17:39] because men love themselves and we're
[17:42] lovers of themselves more than lovers of
[17:44] god but paul said my doctrine was fully
[17:46] known
[17:48] and all godly people will be persecuted
[17:50] because evil seducers wax worse and
[17:53] worse or teachers of false doctrine will
[17:55] abound more and more
[17:57] in second timothy 3 verse 16 paul said
[17:59] all scripture old testament and new
[18:02] testament is profitable for doctrine
[18:05] in second timothy 4 verses 1 through 5
[18:08] paul said he exhorted the saints with
[18:09] long suffering and doctrine he said
[18:12] because there will come a time when
[18:13] people will not endure sound doctrine
[18:15] and it's clear we've come to that time
[18:17] most churches do not want sound doctrine
[18:20] in titus 1 verses 8 9 paul said
[18:22] preachers should use sound doctrine to
[18:24] convince the gangsters
[18:26] in titus 2 verses 1 through 3 paul said
[18:29] speak sound doctrine and live lives of
[18:32] holiness
[18:33] in titus 2 verses 7 through 10 paul said
[18:36] doctrine must not be corrupt or
[18:38] dishonest or insincere and paul said we
[18:40] must adorn the doctrine of god
[18:43] meaning the doctrine of god is lived out
[18:45] and displayed in a public manner through
[18:47] our character just as a garment is seen
[18:50] by everyone in public
[18:51] so is the doctrine that you believe
[18:53] manifest by how you live your life in
[18:55] private and public and you are known and
[18:58] read of all men like a written epistle
[19:00] in hebrews 6 verses 1 through 3
[19:03] paul says we should move on from
[19:05] elementary doctrines if the lord permit
[19:09] so paul says there's a requirement for
[19:11] maturity we must accept the initial
[19:13] elementary doctrines and move on to
[19:15] deeper more spiritual doctrines
[19:18] in hebrews 13 verse 9 paul warns about
[19:20] strange or alien doctrines and we see a
[19:22] lot of that false doctrine today
[19:24] in some deceived message churches and
[19:26] also in many denominational and
[19:28] independent churches as well around the
[19:30] world
[19:32] regarding the deadly effects of false
[19:34] doctrine we've already seen how the
[19:35] first four seals show spiritual death or
[19:38] the fourth horse rider begins his deadly
[19:40] work with evil deeds that grow into
[19:42] false doctrines
[19:44] christ said traditions or doctrines of
[19:45] men produce vain worship in matthew 15
[19:48] verses 1 through 8.
[19:50] christ also said false doctrine was like
[19:52] leaven in matthew 16 verse 6
[19:54] because it puffs up
[19:56] a corrupted church in pride arrogance
[19:59] and many other sins
[20:00] see first corinthians 5 verse 2
[20:03] paul urged the corinthians to be
[20:05] unleaved
[20:06] meaning free from false doctrine and
[20:08] sinful church members
[20:10] see first corinthians 5 verses 7 and 8.
[20:14] similar to the growing effects of false
[20:15] doctrine paul told us the false doctrine
[20:18] that the rapture has already passed
[20:20] destroys the faith of the hears
[20:22] comparing it to gangrene a flesh-eating
[20:25] disease that slowly eats away from the
[20:27] outside in
[20:28] second timothy 2 verses 16 through 18
[20:32] says this but shun profane and vain
[20:34] babblings for they will increase unto
[20:36] more ungodliness
[20:37] and their word will eat as doth a canker
[20:40] of whom is hymenius and felidus who
[20:43] concerning the truth have aired saying
[20:45] that the resurrection is passed already
[20:47] and overthrow the faith of some
[20:51] lastly paul taught doctrines of devils
[20:53] cause people to depart from the faith so
[20:56] nothing could be worse or more
[20:57] detrimental to the believer than false
[20:59] doctrines
[21:00] the true church has the right doctrine
[21:02] paul said teach no other doctrine
[21:04] because instruction is instruction or
[21:06] doctrine for eternal life
[21:08] doctrine is how to receive eternal life
[21:11] and manifest christ's life during your
[21:13] lifetime
[21:14] first timothy 4 verse 1 says now the
[21:16] spirit speaketh expressly that in the
[21:18] latter times some shall depart from the
[21:20] faith giving heed to seducing spirits
[21:23] and doctrines of devils
[21:25] in first timothy 4 verses 1 through 5
[21:27] paul said in the latter times which is
[21:29] our day
[21:30] he said many would depart from the faith
[21:32] because they'd be addicted to seducing
[21:35] spirits and doctrines of devils and he
[21:37] gives two examples celibacy which the
[21:40] roman catholic church supports and
[21:42] propagates to their own detriment and
[21:44] sin
[21:45] and a ban against me eating which is
[21:47] also in the catholic church and many
[21:49] other denominational churches
[21:52] colossians 2 verses 16 through 23
[21:55] say christians can be robbed of reward
[21:58] through the false doctrines of man
[22:00] that's specifically in verse 22 if you
[22:02] want to read that
[22:04] quotes from brother branham supporting
[22:06] doctrine and teaching
[22:08] the following quotes prove brother
[22:09] branham understood and preached the
[22:11] necessity
[22:12] of sound doctrine and teaching
[22:15] the first quote again
[22:16] shows how a church has no backbone or
[22:19] stability without doctrine
[22:21] understand what this means a church that
[22:23] never instructs its members on how to
[22:26] repent or how to receive the holy ghost
[22:28] or how to receive divine healing will
[22:30] have no backbone to stand against satan
[22:34] the very first
[22:38] step man has received the holy spirit is
[22:42] humility
[22:44] real
[22:45] god-given humility
[22:48] that is
[22:49] must be given humbly
[22:54] yet a church without a doctrine
[22:56] is just like
[22:58] a jellyfish that has no backbone
[23:01] so we've got to have
[23:04] that bone
[23:06] in it and not also backbone but heath
[23:09] also because the church of god must eat
[23:13] the bread of life
[23:16] the second quote shows brother branham
[23:18] understood that every single preacher
[23:20] has doctrine and without doctrine or
[23:23] instruction the preacher has no ministry
[23:25] because he is not telling the believers
[23:27] how to live godly how to believe how to
[23:30] receive god's blessings and so
[23:35] i have forth express doctrines and so
[23:37] forth to make this
[23:40] any man that has not a doctrine he has
[23:42] not a ministry
[23:44] in the next three quotes brother adam
[23:46] says teaching builds up believers in
[23:48] christ because they won't be built upon
[23:51] sensations
[23:52] then he says all doctrine or teaching
[23:54] must be based upon the word
[23:56] those who have the holy ghost will be in
[23:58] the word all the way which includes over
[24:00] 110 bible verses about the importance of
[24:03] doctrine
[24:04] i think the church has been preached to
[24:07] death the thing that these guys have
[24:09] come back to teaching and getting on a
[24:11] foundation so you'll know how to build
[24:13] yourself up in christ
[24:16] and we've built our churches up on
[24:18] sensations and upon
[24:21] different things but we can't build up
[24:23] on nothing but christ the revelation of
[24:25] jesus christ that's the only thing that
[24:28] we can do in him you are complete
[24:30] without him you're lost
[24:33] that doctrine can't be based upon some
[24:36] experience
[24:38] doctrine is based on god's word
[24:42] not only spirits
[24:44] people can have experiences of
[24:46] everything
[24:49] make no mistake about it a person that
[24:51] is truly baptized by the holy ghost into
[24:54] the body of christ receiving the
[24:56] fullness of the spirit will be in the
[24:58] word all the way that is the evidence of
[25:01] being baptized with the holy ghost
[25:05] i want to share this thought that the
[25:06] new testament only mentions the latter
[25:08] reign or rapturing faith as brother
[25:10] branham defines it in the church age
[25:11] book in one verse james verse 7.
[25:15] this helps you see the holy ghost's
[25:17] emphasis on doctrine in the over 110 new
[25:20] testament verses that speak of doctrine
[25:23] so the holy ghost emphasizes doctrine
[25:25] over 110 times but only speaks of the
[25:28] latter rain one time
[25:30] this proves those who love the holy
[25:32] ghost bible doctrine will be fully
[25:34] prepared for the latter rain and will
[25:37] receive it and will meet christ in the
[25:39] air at the rapture
[25:40] i'm going to read a portion about
[25:42] doctrine from my 2021 book the 12 new
[25:45] testament mysteries revealed found on
[25:47] pages
[25:49] 805-809
[25:51] the importance of doctrine
[25:53] due to the rise of many false teachers
[25:54] in the message some have dismissed the
[25:56] need for doctrine to their detriment the
[25:59] bible is clear true doctrine saves both
[26:01] the preacher and hear first timothy 4
[26:04] 16.
[26:05] in fact ii john
[26:07] 1 verse 9 says the holy ghost-filled
[26:09] message believers will abide in christ's
[26:12] doctrine whosoever transgresseth and
[26:15] abideth not in the doctrine of christ
[26:17] hath not god he that abideth in the
[26:20] doctrine of christ hath both the father
[26:22] and the son
[26:23] in this quote brother branham says the
[26:25] bride will have true doctrine
[26:28] the antichrist refuses the true bride
[26:33] doctrine and therefore he takes his own
[26:36] bride now and peels her up
[26:39] under a creed
[26:41] of his own
[26:43] takes his own bride and makes her a
[26:45] denomination
[26:47] she gives birth to
[26:49] other denominations
[26:51] as quoted in this holy scripture
[26:54] gives birth to daughters
[26:57] and um
[27:01] she don't
[27:02] she becomes just like her mother
[27:04] natural worldly denominational
[27:08] opposing the spiritual bride the word
[27:13] in first timothy 5 17
[27:16] paul says labors in doctrine are worthy
[27:18] of double honor let the elders that rule
[27:20] well be counted worthy of double honor
[27:23] especially they who labor in the word
[27:25] and doctrine
[27:27] if there's a deep call for true doctrine
[27:29] there has to be a deep to respond
[27:31] you know the true bride will have both
[27:33] the spirit supernatural works of the
[27:35] holy ghost and the truth true doctrine
[27:38] some forget brother branham's quote that
[27:40] jesus's first doctrine was on the new
[27:42] birth or the baptism of the holy ghost
[27:45] this proves
[27:47] true doctrine leads you to the new birth
[27:49] and once born again the spirit keeps
[27:51] guiding you into more true doctrine
[27:54] brother rams said the following
[27:56] i want to take the subject this morning
[27:58] of jesus first doctrine
[28:01] first doctrine of jesus was you must be
[28:04] born again
[28:06] that was his first
[28:08] doctrine
[28:10] it's wrong for preachers to say they
[28:13] aren't trying to preach doctrine because
[28:15] every single sermon includes doctrine
[28:17] since it means instruction
[28:19] preachers are either giving instruction
[28:21] for miracles divine healing salvation
[28:24] etc brother random says every preacher
[28:26] has doctrine whether he knows it or not
[28:28] as he cannot have a ministry without
[28:30] doctrine
[28:31] in here i might say that i have to
[28:34] express doctrines and so forth to make
[28:37] this
[28:38] any man that has not a doctrine he has
[28:40] not a ministry
[28:41] brother ram love teaching the bible and
[28:44] wished he had charts to reference when
[28:45] teaching his people god's revelations
[28:48] saying it would be a little heaven this
[28:50] is why power points or visuals can be
[28:53] helpful to believers to grow their
[28:54] understanding brother random said the
[28:56] following how you all enjoying
[28:59] revelations all right
[29:01] man
[29:02] i believe a whole lot like my little
[29:03] girl sarah back there's become
[29:05] revolutions to me
[29:07] it's just revolutions
[29:09] going over and over
[29:12] you know i wish we just had now until
[29:14] about march or april
[29:16] just to put a great big canvas across
[29:19] the back here and just come down in
[29:21] daytime and draw out those pictures the
[29:24] whole chart and just raise them up and
[29:26] down like when the shades you know like
[29:28] i've always dreamed sometimes i'm having
[29:30] a great big tabernacle somewhere where i
[29:32] could reach down and pull this chart
[29:34] down come all the way across the
[29:36] platform and revelations and the
[29:38] interpretation of the lord has given me
[29:40] and take a pointer to start through
[29:42] there and bring these ages down let me
[29:44] get through that raise that one up pull
[29:45] the other one down like this and start
[29:47] on that and teach it through oh that
[29:50] would just be like a little heaven what
[29:51] just set the complete winner through
[29:53] just send it out with the lord
[29:59] i've never seen a year and six months in
[30:01] this book of revelation
[30:04] and and the tabernacle here
[30:06] that's what i like and
[30:08] and teaching i just love teaching all my
[30:13] i i think it's wonderful it gives the
[30:16] basis and settles the church
[30:21] of course there are many many more
[30:23] quotes from brother branham that support
[30:26] doctrine in teaching but i'm sure that
[30:28] these
[30:29] nine quotes show you the prophet's love
[30:31] and respect for sound doctrine and
[30:33] teaching
[30:35] economical attack against true doctrine
[30:39] message believers or followers of god's
[30:42] bible-based revelations given to his
[30:44] prophet william branham will be familiar
[30:47] with the ecumenical advances that took
[30:49] place in 2014
[30:51] this was the year the reality of the one
[30:53] world religion began to take shape also
[30:56] known as the bundling of the tares
[30:59] according to christ in matthew 13 verse
[31:02] 30.
[31:03] in january 2014
[31:05] anglican bishop tony palmer brought a
[31:08] personal video greeting from pope
[31:09] francis to kenneth copeland and the word
[31:12] of faith movement at copeland's annual
[31:14] ministers conference in fort worth texas
[31:17] let's watch portions of the video
[31:20] regarding doctrine and other subjects
[31:24] i believe that god has brought me here
[31:26] to this year's ministers conference in
[31:28] the spirit of elijah
[31:32] let me explain
[31:34] if you look carefully the spirit of
[31:36] elijah was on john the baptist
[31:38] to turn the hearts of the sons to the
[31:42] fathers
[31:45] and to turn the hearts of the fathers to
[31:47] the sons to prepare the way for the lord
[31:52] and we know that prophecy always has a
[31:54] double fulfillment and we know that
[31:56] elijah will come before the second
[31:58] coming as well
[31:59] and i've understood that the spirit of
[32:01] elijah is the spirit of reconciliation
[32:05] to return hearts to each other
[32:09] we know that the first thousand years
[32:11] there was one church it was called the
[32:12] catholic church and the word catholic
[32:14] means universal it doesn't mean roman
[32:17] catholic means if you're born again
[32:19] raise your hand if you're born again
[32:21] you're a catholic
[32:24] take back redeem what belongs to you
[32:27] we are catholics
[32:30] i've come to understand that diversity
[32:32] is divine
[32:33] it's division that's diabolic
[32:35] one it's the glory that glues us
[32:37] together not the doctrines
[32:40] it's the glory if you accept that christ
[32:43] is living in me and the presence of god
[32:45] is in me and the presence of god is in
[32:47] you that's all we need
[32:49] because god will sort out all our
[32:51] doctrines when we get upstairs
[32:55] this brought an end to the protest of
[32:57] luther
[33:00] brothers and sisters luther's protest is
[33:02] over
[33:04] is yours
[33:06] and i get a bit cheeky here because i
[33:08] challenge my protestant pastor friends
[33:11] if there is no more protest
[33:13] how can there be a protestant church
[33:17] maybe now we're all catholics again
[33:22] the protest is over
[33:25] the protest is over
[33:28] we receive your blessing it's very very
[33:30] important to us
[33:32] and we bless you with all of our hearts
[33:35] we bless you with all of our souls
[33:38] we bless you with all of our might
[33:41] and we thank you sir
[33:45] within that service friends were many
[33:47] heretical statements such as
[33:50] first palmer claiming he was under the
[33:52] anointing of elijah to restore the
[33:54] catholics and protestants but this was a
[33:57] lie for god had already sent brother
[33:59] william branham under the spirit of
[34:01] elijah to declare rome and the roman
[34:03] catholic church were the mother harlot
[34:06] and the protestants who held the
[34:08] mother's dogmas like the trinity
[34:09] doctrine were daughters of the mother
[34:12] harlot with thus saith the lord
[34:15] second palmer claimed
[34:17] the protest was over between the
[34:19] protestants and catholics
[34:21] third copeland and all the people under
[34:23] his ministry blessed the pope with all
[34:26] their souls
[34:27] a heretical statement because jesus said
[34:30] we are to love only the lord our god
[34:32] with all of our souls in matthew 22 37
[34:36] this showed their souls were united with
[34:39] the pope for the one world religion
[34:42] fourth
[34:43] palmer claimed god doesn't care about
[34:45] our doctrine and he will sort it out
[34:47] later in heaven
[34:49] friends nothing could be further from
[34:51] the truth
[34:52] as we've already seen in the bible jesus
[34:54] christ and the apostle paul said the
[34:56] doctrine sorts out who you are right now
[34:59] remember the bible said avoid heretics
[35:02] jesus warned his disciples to avoid the
[35:04] leaven of the pharisees
[35:06] paul said this though in romans 16
[35:08] verses 17 and 18.
[35:10] now i beseech you brethren mark them
[35:12] which cause divisions and offenses
[35:14] contrary to the doctrine which ye have
[35:16] learned and avoid them
[35:18] for they that are such serve not our
[35:20] lord jesus christ but their own belly
[35:23] and by good words and fair speeches
[35:26] deceive the hearts of the simple
[35:28] now isn't it fitting that the word of
[35:30] faith movement is a prosperity gospel
[35:32] movement as they boast about their
[35:34] millions and billions of dollars
[35:36] boasting about private jets they
[35:38] purchase
[35:39] which reveals that they are not serving
[35:41] the lord jesus christ they're serving
[35:43] their own bellies their own interests
[35:46] friends false doctrines are heresies and
[35:49] according to romans 16
[35:51] heresies prove that false teachers are
[35:53] not true followers of christ
[35:55] because their bellies are their gods
[35:58] know also that the pope then invited
[36:01] kenneth copeland and tony palmer to the
[36:03] vatican for a formal agreement of their
[36:06] anti-doctrine union here's a picture
[36:08] from copeland's website
[36:15] sadly bishop palmer passed away a few
[36:17] months after his claim to be elijah in
[36:20] july 2014
[36:23] while we mourn the loss of his life
[36:25] especially for his family we must
[36:27] discern or judge that palmer was
[36:29] completely deceived regarding doctrine
[36:31] and that he did not have the spirit of
[36:33] elijah because brother branham had the
[36:35] spirit of elijah and god vindicated that
[36:38] palmer's message was completely opposite
[36:40] of brother branham's message and brother
[36:43] brown's message was thus saith the lord
[36:45] and i must say that there is a move
[36:47] around the message churches to belittle
[36:50] doctrine
[36:51] two examples include the jeffersonville
[36:52] movement and some fivefold ministry
[36:55] churches
[36:56] beginning with the jeffersonville
[36:58] movement they say they believe every
[37:00] word on brother branham's tapes which
[37:02] essentially means they have very little
[37:05] to no doctrinal backbone as brother
[37:07] branham said
[37:08] they hold many contradicting doctrines
[37:11] as i've already showed in some of my
[37:12] previous videos about how brother
[37:14] branham grew in his understanding on
[37:16] multiple doctrines such as the baptism
[37:19] or filling of the holy ghost
[37:21] whether or not to accept gifts from
[37:23] other people in churches
[37:25] see philippians 4 verse 17
[37:27] divine healing and other revelations
[37:30] like the godhead
[37:32] so according to brother branham's life
[37:33] and teachings the current jeffersonville
[37:36] movement has no backbone they're a
[37:38] jellyfish church they have to believe
[37:40] every single thing on the tapes even
[37:42] though brother branham admitted there
[37:43] were mix-ups or mistakes on the tapes
[37:46] and said look in the bible when that
[37:48] happens
[37:49] next some fivefold ministry preachers
[37:52] also belittle doctrine but recently i
[37:54] heard the saddest statement from an
[37:56] american preacher
[37:57] he said
[37:59] tape churches return ministry churches
[38:01] and five-fold preaching churches are all
[38:04] the same
[38:05] in my humble opinion
[38:07] this man is deceived by the same spirit
[38:09] that was on the late tony palmer
[38:12] and please know that i reached out to
[38:13] this man on the phone and sent him a
[38:16] letter explaining his 24 heirs in a
[38:19] recent sermon he preached
[38:21] which included his attack on doctrine
[38:23] and claimed that all messed churches
[38:25] were unified and the same because
[38:27] doctrine didn't matter
[38:29] he was essentially trying to bring in
[38:31] ecumenical unity to message churches to
[38:33] justify his own rejection of sound
[38:35] doctrine such as having a home church
[38:39] friends return ministry churches idolize
[38:41] brother branham looking for his ministry
[38:43] to return which makes them neglect their
[38:46] own ministries or the current ministry
[38:48] of the holy ghost today
[38:50] remember according to saint paul in
[38:51] galatians 1 verses 6 through 12
[38:54] to add delete or change paul's gospel
[38:57] was to be accursed
[38:58] the jeffersonville movement drastically
[39:00] changes the fivefold ministry saying
[39:02] brother branham fulfilled the five full
[39:04] ministry and they encourage less
[39:06] preaching from living preachers
[39:08] which breaks the command of ephesians 4
[39:10] verses 8 through 16 and 2 timothy 4
[39:13] verse 2.
[39:15] jeffersonville changes how the fivefold
[39:17] ministry operates saying we need less
[39:20] live preachers or less living preachers
[39:23] and we need more mechanical ministry
[39:26] and here's a quote where brother branham
[39:27] said machines are not to take the gospel
[39:30] but living men
[39:32] a god in the beginning that could have
[39:34] made the son preach the gospel or the
[39:37] winds preach the gospel or an angel
[39:39] preached the gospel but he our gain man
[39:42] for that purpose and he never changes it
[39:45] he never already
[39:47] ever ordained denominations he never
[39:49] ordained groups of man he ordained man
[39:52] to preach the gospel
[39:54] not machinery mechanical devices or any
[39:57] angelic being it was man
[40:01] remember the mark of the beast in the
[40:03] head is accepting the doctrine of the
[40:05] ecumenical system
[40:07] such as trinitarianism etc tony palmer
[40:11] kenneth copeland and pope francis hold
[40:13] this false line doctrine of doctrine
[40:16] doesn't matter and as i witnessed in
[40:18] some message circles some message
[40:20] preachers have the same belief
[40:22] may god have mercy on those who are so
[40:24] close to accepting the mark of the beast
[40:26] in their heads whether they're outside
[40:28] the message or in the message
[40:31] the uniting principle of the one world
[40:33] religious system is we don't need
[40:35] doctrine only a unity of experience
[40:38] but theirs is a false experience that
[40:40] celebrates the anointing while
[40:42] crucifying the love-based obedience to
[40:44] doctrine needed from the heart and soul
[40:47] of the believer as romans 6 17 says but
[40:52] god be thanked that ye were servants of
[40:54] sin but ye have obeyed from the heart
[40:56] that form of doctrine which was
[40:58] delivered you
[41:00] misconceptions about doctrine
[41:03] i've heard numerous statements about
[41:04] doctrine from both message and
[41:06] non-message preachers that show their
[41:09] non-biblical attitude toward doctrine
[41:12] the first statement is something like
[41:13] this
[41:14] the message is not a doctrine it's a
[41:16] person the message is the person of
[41:18] christ while i understand what the
[41:21] brothers are saying
[41:22] it seems they're not taking a few quotes
[41:24] from brother branham into account
[41:26] for example in look away to jesus
[41:28] brother branham said i may not do it but
[41:31] this message will introduce jesus christ
[41:33] to the world so brother branham seems to
[41:35] separate the message from the person of
[41:37] christ let's listen to the quote
[41:40] i may not do it but this message will
[41:43] introduce jesus christ to the world for
[41:45] as john the baptist was sent before run
[41:48] the first coming
[41:49] so is the message to forerun the second
[41:52] coming
[41:55] so i understand what the brothers are
[41:56] saying but i also know the person of
[41:58] christ
[41:59] frequently issued instructions and
[42:01] teachings to his people like acts 1
[42:04] verse 2 says
[42:05] until the day in which he was taken up
[42:07] after that he through the holy ghost had
[42:09] given commandments unto the apostles
[42:12] whom he had chosen
[42:14] and jesus had already said if you loved
[42:16] him the person of the message you would
[42:18] keep his commands or doctrines in john
[42:21] 14 21
[42:23] and he that hath my commandments and
[42:24] keepeth them he it is that loveth me and
[42:27] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[42:29] father and i will love him and will
[42:31] manifest myself to him
[42:33] in fact if the person of christ ever
[42:36] came to you and instructed you to do
[42:38] anything then christ was giving you
[42:40] doctrine because doctrine is instruction
[42:43] first timothy 4 16 shows how true
[42:45] doctrine saves both the preacher and the
[42:47] hearers
[42:48] take heed unto thyself and unto the
[42:50] doctrine continue in them for in doing
[42:53] this thou shalt both save thyself and
[42:56] them that hear thee friends consider the
[42:59] person of christ is the holy ghost
[43:02] but any command or instruction that he
[43:04] gives is the doctrine of the holy ghost
[43:07] so the person of christ and doctrine his
[43:09] own doctrine are very closely connected
[43:12] in fact in revelation 3 jesus christ
[43:14] himself said as many as i love i rebuke
[43:17] and chasten
[43:18] to rebuke is to correct or give
[43:20] instruction
[43:21] on how to change your life in order to
[43:23] please the lord more
[43:24] so the person of christ is always
[43:26] offering doctrinal instruction to the
[43:29] ones he loves
[43:31] a second statement is essentially the
[43:33] message is power not doctrine or there
[43:36] is no power in the doctrines of the
[43:38] message
[43:39] this statement over emphasizes power
[43:42] gifts and signs making message believers
[43:44] sound like the anointed ones at the end
[43:46] times who get results but deny the word
[43:50] this statement also assumes god always
[43:51] wants to heal and show miracles which is
[43:54] not the case according to saint paul and
[43:57] numerous bible examples
[43:59] jesus told paul his grace was sufficient
[44:01] when jesus didn't heal his eye trouble
[44:04] in second corinthians chapter 12.
[44:07] some message people are basically making
[44:09] god their errand boy to do whatever they
[44:11] want and forget we can't make god do
[44:14] anything
[44:15] they forget the simple but powerful
[44:17] truth that we must pray let thy will be
[44:19] done not mine
[44:21] and if the lord is willing he will do a
[44:22] miracle or manifest his power
[44:25] some message people forget jesus was
[44:27] known for his doctrine and power because
[44:30] they are inseparable
[44:32] the scripture says the signs follow the
[44:34] word or instruction
[44:36] for example moses signs follow the
[44:39] instruction that god gave him
[44:41] mark 16 says these signs follow them
[44:43] that believe
[44:44] and the person of christ said to go
[44:46] teach all nations or go instruct all
[44:48] nations with my doctrine
[44:50] in matthew chapter 28 and in the
[44:53] parallel passage of mark 16 jesus said
[44:55] the signs would follow them as they
[44:57] taught all nations
[44:59] a person that says doctrine doesn't have
[45:01] power has not read the four gospels
[45:03] lately nor the book of acts i've already
[45:06] shown how israel recognized both new
[45:09] doctrine and new power in the ministry
[45:11] of jesus christ
[45:12] and how they were inseparable from his
[45:14] ministry
[45:16] in the book of acts paul smote elimus
[45:19] blind in acts 13 verses 11 through 13
[45:22] and the deputy was astonished at paul's
[45:24] doctrine or instruction
[45:27] third i've heard many message believers
[45:29] say i'd rather have the right spirit
[45:31] than the right doctrine
[45:33] that is a true statement but consider
[45:35] that holy ghost-filled saints like paul
[45:37] had both the right spirit and the right
[45:40] doctrine
[45:41] as evidenced by paul correcting peter's
[45:43] false doctrine in galatians 2 when he
[45:46] separated himself from the gentiles
[45:48] one prophet corrected another
[45:51] an observation i made is that every
[45:53] message believer believes that brother
[45:55] branham preached what paul preached as
[45:57] brother branham related this statement
[45:59] expressed by the saints who were already
[46:00] beyond the curtain of time
[46:02] friends if brother branham preached what
[46:04] paul preached which we know he did
[46:07] then brother branham gave us the same
[46:08] doctrine as paul
[46:10] remember that paul was the one who wrote
[46:12] about doctrine more than any other new
[46:13] testament writer
[46:15] romans 2 verse 16 says paul's gospel
[46:18] will judge the world and the secrets of
[46:20] men's hearts on the day of judgment so
[46:22] we should give ourselves to doctrine and
[46:24] power
[46:25] the testimony of both our doctrine and
[46:27] power will judge the world
[46:30] paul said don't you know that the saints
[46:31] will judge the earth and angels
[46:34] we should not despise doctrine but those
[46:36] called of god should give ourselves to
[46:39] it for god gives double honor to those
[46:41] who labor in doctrine
[46:43] notice paul never said people would give
[46:45] double honor to laborers and doctrine
[46:47] which shows the truth that many
[46:48] believers don't like doctrine because
[46:51] they don't like to obey god's
[46:52] instructions
[46:54] many believers simply have a form of
[46:56] godliness but deny the power thereof
[46:59] also using the symbolism of the pyramid
[47:02] brother branham said the bride ministry
[47:04] has to match jesus ministry when jesus
[47:06] returns
[47:08] this means the bride must match jesus in
[47:10] power but also in teaching and doctrine
[47:13] any honest bible reader knows paul was
[47:15] heavy on doctrine as he taught the
[47:17] how-to with gifts the how-to with
[47:20] marriage and divorce the how-to with
[47:22] widows the how-to with ties and
[47:24] offerings the how-to with alms and so
[47:27] much more
[47:29] it is so incredibly irresponsible to say
[47:31] that we do not need doctrine
[47:34] perhaps the brothers that preach we
[47:35] don't need doctrine have complexes
[47:39] or some other spiritual sickness
[47:41] without doctrine you would never tell
[47:43] anyone how to do anything you would just
[47:45] talk about salvation but never explain
[47:48] how to get it
[47:49] as we know it comes through genuine
[47:51] repentance according to acts 2 verse 38
[47:54] but then you have to explain what is
[47:55] real repentance
[47:56] how do you really repent in order to be
[47:59] saved and then later fill with the holy
[48:00] ghost
[48:01] we must all consider these scriptures as
[48:03] well from the book of proverbs proverbs
[48:06] 1 7 says the fear of the lord is the
[48:08] beginning of knowledge but fools despise
[48:11] wisdom and instruction fools despise
[48:14] doctrine
[48:15] proverbs 4 verse 13
[48:17] take fast hold of instruction or
[48:19] doctrine
[48:20] let her not go keeper for she is thy
[48:23] life so those who hold on to the true
[48:26] doctrine of the holy ghost are holding
[48:28] on to life
[48:29] proverbs 6 verse 23 for the commandment
[48:32] is a lamp and the law is light and
[48:34] reproofs of instruction are the way of
[48:37] life so this is how you maintain a holy
[48:39] life is by being corrected on your
[48:42] doctrine
[48:43] and proverbs 9 verse 8 says reprove not
[48:45] a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a
[48:49] wise man and he will love thee
[48:52] the conclusion from these scriptures is
[48:53] that a born-again holy ghost-filled
[48:55] believer loves doctrine for doctrine
[48:58] shows him how to live
[49:00] while the foolish virgin despised
[49:01] doctrine and the sinners hate it and
[49:03] will never receive it
[49:06] in closing
[49:08] i hope this video has been a blessing to
[49:09] you
[49:10] really i could only scratch the surface
[49:12] on the scriptures related to doctrine
[49:15] and also there were many many other
[49:16] quotes about doctrine and teaching
[49:18] wherein brother branham said he loved
[49:20] both
[49:21] my prayer is that our church and your
[49:22] church will have the true bride doctrine
[49:25] as brother branham said and that jesus
[49:27] christ will continue to instruct us
[49:29] giving us true doctrine that will lay a
[49:32] hold on eternal life and eventually
[49:34] the rapture meeting in the air
[49:37] if you have any questions concerns or
[49:39] testimonies about this video please
[49:41] contact me
[49:44] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[49:46] the desire of your heart
