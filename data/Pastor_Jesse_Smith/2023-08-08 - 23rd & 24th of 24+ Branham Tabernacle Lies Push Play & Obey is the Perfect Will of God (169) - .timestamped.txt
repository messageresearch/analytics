[0:13] to either follow the word of God
[0:16] don't forget this Tabernacle will lose
[0:18] extreme
[0:20] to leave
[0:22] that you say to be true but they don't
[0:25] believe that their own actions
[0:28] I can't interpret his work
[0:33] [Applause]
[0:34] Machinery mechanical devices
[0:39] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:42] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:45] this video is to finish the series on
[0:47] the 24 plus Lies coming out of Branham
[0:49] Tabernacle located in Jeffersonville
[0:51] Indiana USA please see the previous
[0:54] videos for a review of the first 22 lies
[0:58] but here's the 23rd lie the 23rd lie is
[1:01] that press or push play and Obey is the
[1:05] perfect will of God
[1:07] the evidence of this lie comes from a
[1:10] song Special recorded at a Branham
[1:12] Tabernacle service a couple years ago
[1:15] there's a couple who sings a song
[1:17] special and as you'll see in this song
[1:19] special they claim Joshua's mission was
[1:23] to play the tapes to Rahab and they say
[1:25] just press play Push Play and Obey for
[1:28] its God's provided way they say put
[1:31] brother Branham back in the pulpit
[1:33] and they can safely say it's the perfect
[1:35] will of God when they press play they
[1:38] say the bride's Perfection is through
[1:40] the tapes and the tapes are all they
[1:42] need they claim brother Branham showed
[1:44] us what to do at two o'clock on Sunday
[1:47] they press play sadly they claim in
[1:50] God's Big Sky someday God himself will
[1:53] still be pressing play they claim in
[1:55] every age the laity and clergy goes
[1:57] astray and they claim Ephesians 4 is not
[2:00] enough to bring this Bride In Shape
[2:02] among other lies on the song
[2:06] and friends at the end of the song
[2:07] special you can see Branham tabernacle's
[2:09] leadership their pastor and associate
[2:12] pastor standing up clapping and
[2:15] rejoicing in the lies that are in this
[2:17] song of course they're not worshiping
[2:19] the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit
[2:21] disagrees with this song because the
[2:23] Holy Bible disagrees with this song
[2:25] so now I'll just play a few of those
[2:27] portions from the song I'm not going to
[2:29] play the whole song but just the
[2:30] portions I mentioned let's listen to the
[2:32] song
[2:34] God's prophet
[2:38] into the promised land the very mission
[2:42] was to play the tapes for that was his
[2:47] commandment that's why we push
[2:53] forever
[3:00] before we can safely say it's the
[3:05] perfect will of God when we press police
[3:10] it is the bride's Perfection
[3:14] the tapes are all we need and brother
[3:18] Branham showed us what to do with the
[3:22] voice in this last day
[3:24] [Music]
[3:26] on Sunday the press play
[3:31] that and that voice is so important that
[3:35] in God's Big Sky someday
[3:39] God himself will still be pressing
[3:43] please
[3:46] so we must always have our filter on in
[3:51] this deceiving day
[3:53] for in every age the laity and the
[3:58] clergy goes astray so Ephesians 4 is not
[4:04] enough to bring this bride in shape
[4:08] so now that we've heard this ridiculous
[4:11] sinful song Let's go through some Bible
[4:14] proofs about why it's wrong first
[4:16] regarding Joshua and Joshua sending tape
[4:19] boys into Rahab there is a quote from
[4:21] Brother Branham on that but in one of
[4:23] the quotes brother Ram laughs after he
[4:25] makes the statement because it's not a
[4:27] Biblical mandate to send Tate boys Tate
[4:31] boys are not part of the fivefold
[4:32] ministry and I have a video on this
[4:34] topic if you'd like to watch that let me
[4:36] know I can put the link in the
[4:38] description or I can put the link in the
[4:40] comments
[4:41] so the first sin is that they're
[4:42] creating a Doctrine based upon a quote
[4:44] from Brother Branham with no scripture
[4:47] and that is adding to the word of God
[4:49] and that breaks the word of Galatians 1
[4:52] verse 6 through 12 which says anyone who
[4:54] adds to Paul's gospel is cursed Paul
[4:57] never taught Tate boys replaced the
[4:59] living preaching Fievel Ministry
[5:02] also Romans 2 verse 16 says will be
[5:04] judged by Paul's gospel so these tape
[5:07] worshipers will be judged as guilty if
[5:10] they don't repent of changing Paul's
[5:13] gospel also they'll be guilty of
[5:14] revelation 22 18-19 because they're
[5:18] adding to the Bible by making tape boys
[5:20] part of the fightful ministry and
[5:21] they're taking away the other four-folds
[5:24] of the fivefold ministry and only
[5:26] focusing on the prophet Ministry of
[5:28] brother Branham and really since brother
[5:30] Ram's dead he's not part of the living
[5:32] five-fold Ministry so they're really
[5:34] taking all five gifts of the fivefold
[5:36] ministry away
[5:38] and the Bible says if they don't repent
[5:39] God will call them a liar it's from
[5:41] proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 add thou not
[5:44] to God's words lest thou be found a liar
[5:48] and Friends remember tapes did not even
[5:50] exist in Joshua's day so it's ridiculous
[5:52] to say Joshua's mission was for the
[5:55] spies to play tapes and friends the tape
[5:58] worshipers always forget there was a
[6:00] priesthood in Joshua's day it was the
[6:02] aaronic priesthood high priest and other
[6:05] priests the levitical priesthood and
[6:07] they're exalting these imaginary Tate
[6:09] boys they're exalting the spies above
[6:11] the aaronic priesthood which is heresy
[6:14] but through this series that's what
[6:16] we've seen they're just accustomed to
[6:17] making heresy after heresy
[6:19] I noticed they said Ephesians 4 is not
[6:22] enough so see they've got to add to the
[6:24] scripture because the scripture is not
[6:25] enough so if they don't repent it's
[6:28] likely plagues will be added to them as
[6:29] the Bible says in revelation 22 18-19
[6:33] the Bible said in Ephesians 4 8 through
[6:36] 16 that the gifts will bring the church
[6:38] to Unity and Perfection and lastly
[6:40] friends God doesn't have cassette tapes
[6:43] or reel-to-reel tapes in heaven the
[6:45] Bible says God has books in heaven and
[6:48] he will open the books and judge every
[6:51] man according to his Works based upon
[6:53] what's recorded in the books not tapes
[6:57] next I want to look at a few quotes from
[6:58] Brother Branham that might help
[7:00] listeners understand the heresy of the
[7:03] push play and Obey being the perfect
[7:05] will of God lie friends where did
[7:07] Brother random say push play and obey
[7:10] of course he never said that where did
[7:12] Brother Branham say the perfect will of
[7:14] God is to press play and not Ephesians
[7:16] 4. brother REM never said that
[7:19] where did Brother Branham say that tapes
[7:20] are all you need you don't need
[7:22] preachers you don't need Bibles
[7:24] brother Ram never said that where did
[7:27] Brother random show everyone to press
[7:28] play at two o'clock every Sunday that's
[7:31] right again brother Brown never said
[7:33] that so these people who claim to only
[7:36] say what the tapes say are most often
[7:39] not saying what the tapes say but here's
[7:41] what the tapes say
[7:43] in that heretical song They're basically
[7:46] citing a quote from brother Brandon from
[7:48] the church age book chapter seven
[7:49] brother random says quote for in each
[7:51] age the church goes astray and it is not
[7:53] just the laity but the clergy group
[7:55] shepherds are wrong as well as sheep
[7:57] then God brings himself on the scene as
[7:59] the chief Shepherd in the ministries of
[8:01] these seven men to lead his people back
[8:02] to the truth and the Abundant power of
[8:04] God end quote so as always Branham
[8:07] Tabernacle only focuses on one quote
[8:09] they don't focus on other quotes first
[8:12] they're misapplying this quote this
[8:14] quote does not say every single lady
[8:16] member and every single clergy member
[8:18] goes astray in fact the quotes of
[8:21] brother Branham say the opposite and
[8:23] here's about five or six quotes all
[8:25] saying the same thing that God always
[8:27] has a witness on the earth someone who
[8:30] has not compromised on the word of God
[8:32] so these quotes prove not every lady
[8:35] member not every clergy member goes
[8:37] astray the first one is from
[8:39] expectations 1950 brother Randolph said
[8:41] there's always been somebody somewhere
[8:42] that God could put his hand on and say
[8:44] Here's my servant he's always it's
[8:46] gotten down to sometimes just about one
[8:48] left but God has always had a witness
[8:52] and he said in the resurrection of
[8:54] Lazarus 1950 but God has always had a
[8:57] witness here on Earth for him
[9:00] so no matter what clergy or lady went
[9:03] astray in each age God always had a
[9:06] witness on the earth for the truth
[9:07] that's according to brother Branham so
[9:10] why isn't Branham Tabernacle saying what
[9:11] brother Branham said another quote was
[9:13] from God's preparation 1954 he says
[9:16] sometimes it's got down to one man but
[9:18] he's never been without a witness on
[9:20] Earth
[9:21] I love this quote from making the valley
[9:22] full of ditches 1956 brother Rams said
[9:25] but God has always had someone he could
[9:28] lay his finger on and say this is my
[9:30] servant in all ages
[9:33] so notice in all ages that means in
[9:35] laodicea God always has someone that he
[9:38] can put his finger on and say this is my
[9:40] servant
[9:41] God has never left himself without a
[9:43] witness that's according to the Bible
[9:44] and brother Branham acts 14 17 says
[9:48] nevertheless he left not himself without
[9:50] a witness so who's right Branham
[9:52] Tabernacle or the Bible and brother
[9:54] Branham of course the Bible and brother
[9:56] Branham are correct and Branham
[9:58] Tabernacle is lying they're wrong
[10:00] again he said in 1957 God manifesting
[10:03] his gifts now God in all ages at all
[10:06] times has never been without a witness
[10:08] God's always had a witness God's always
[10:11] had a witness
[10:13] to see friends in all ages at all times
[10:15] God's always had a faithful witness
[10:17] sometimes just one man but there's never
[10:19] been a time when all the laity or all
[10:21] the clergy went astray God has always
[10:23] had a faithful Witness
[10:25] and then he says it again greater than
[10:26] Solomon is here 1963 quote now God in
[10:30] all ages has never been without a
[10:31] witness God has some time got down to
[10:34] only one man I love what he says next
[10:37] quote somebody who could believe God
[10:39] just the way it's written and just what
[10:41] he is end quote
[10:43] now
[10:44] God in all ages has never been without a
[10:47] witness
[10:48] God has sometimes got down to only one
[10:50] man but he's always had a witness
[10:53] somebody who believe him somebody who
[10:56] could believe in the Supernatural
[10:58] somebody who could believe God just the
[11:00] way it's written and just what he is
[11:03] and he referred to them here as we find
[11:05] out in all ages he had his witness
[11:08] everywhere I love that God always has a
[11:11] witness who will believe God just the
[11:13] way it's written in the Bible and that's
[11:16] what Branham Tabernacle is distorting
[11:18] they're taking away they're adding to
[11:20] the Bible that's what they will not
[11:22] fully believe and fully preach they will
[11:24] not fully obey the Bible but God always
[11:27] has a witness in all ages at all times
[11:30] that will believe God just the way it's
[11:32] written in Ephesians chapter 4 that the
[11:34] five full ministry the living faithful
[11:36] ministry will bring the bride to Unity
[11:38] and perfection
[11:40] the Bible said for the perfecting of the
[11:42] Saints till we all come in the unity of
[11:44] the faith the reality is that Branham
[11:47] Tabernacle has rejected the true
[11:48] five-fold Ministry so they are talked
[11:51] about in Ephesians 4 14 they are
[11:54] children tossed to and fro and carried
[11:56] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[11:58] slight of men and cunning craftiness
[12:00] whereby they lie and wait to deceive
[12:03] the 24th and final lie is that we've got
[12:06] to put brother Branham back in the
[12:08] pulpit and his ministry is the livest
[12:11] ministry there is
[12:13] so I'm going to play some audio from a
[12:15] brand new Tabernacle preliminary service
[12:17] you'll hear random Tabernacles pastors
[12:19] say brother random doesn't have a Pulpit
[12:22] Brothers Ministry is the livest ministry
[12:24] there is and he accuses the preachers
[12:27] that they shut that Prophet out of the
[12:28] pulpit calls them Demus and they don't
[12:31] want him behind the pulpit
[12:33] of course these are lies these are false
[12:35] accusations the fact is the true
[12:37] five-fold Ministry led by the Holy Ghost
[12:39] knows that only living men are in the
[12:42] faithful Ministry and have a right to
[12:45] preach behind the pulpit
[12:47] dead men were never commissioned by God
[12:49] to preach behind any pulpit in fact I
[12:52] believe it's Ezra that is first
[12:54] mentioned as having a Pulpit he was a
[12:55] living man not a dead man he never said
[12:58] let's pretend like Moses is back in the
[13:00] Pulpit know what he did he used his own
[13:02] voice to preach Moses's message and
[13:05] that's what preachers are doing today
[13:06] obedient preachers to the fivefold
[13:08] ministry were preaching the message of
[13:10] brother Branham and it's the Bible
[13:12] restoration message and yes as preachers
[13:14] we have to rightly divide the quotes of
[13:16] brother Branham and only bring through
[13:18] the pulpit what brother random said that
[13:21] agrees with the Bible most of what
[13:23] brother random says agrees with the
[13:24] Bible but not all of it he was a man he
[13:27] told us this he told us to be careful
[13:28] how we're listening and there's so much
[13:30] of it that's the human side but he said
[13:33] prove All Things by the Bible he told us
[13:35] to test him by the word and he told us
[13:37] to only teach things that we can teach
[13:39] Genesis to Revelation Through the Bible
[13:41] so you'll never find Saint Paul or any
[13:44] new testament preacher saying put dead
[13:46] men back in the Pulpit let's listen to
[13:49] the LIE
[13:50] but so is it now today
[13:53] that in this message it's the same thing
[13:55] that's right it is the same thing in
[13:58] this message amen if you try to
[14:01] encourage a minister to play the tape in
[14:04] the church
[14:05] you are so misunderstood you're against
[14:08] the fivefold ministry you're against the
[14:11] ministry it's not against the ministry
[14:13] it's but brother Branham doesn't have a
[14:15] Pulpit
[14:16] he doesn't have a place he wanted to
[14:18] speak just people like this the word
[14:20] comes to speak to his bride of Jesus
[14:22] Christ but he's now welcome no more into
[14:25] doing it it's your boycotted and you say
[14:27] you hear that you know well we can play
[14:29] the tapes anytime
[14:31] we need a live Ministry now don't get me
[14:35] wrong I'm all about but guess what this
[14:37] is the lightest Ministry there is
[14:51] glory to the Lord
[14:58] [Applause]
[15:12] praise the Lord
[15:14] [Applause]
[15:20] beautiful
[15:26] [Applause]
[15:30] praise the lord it's just the way that
[15:32] it is amen and when you shut that
[15:36] Prophet out of that pulpit and you say
[15:37] that that's not a live Ministry I got
[15:40] something to tell you Dimas
[15:43] [Music]
[15:45] [Applause]
[15:51] [Music]
[15:53] I know I'm going to get it for that oh
[15:56] that's all right
[15:58] so when I hear that message today when I
[16:00] heard it
[16:02] it just breaks my heart
[16:04] and give it to Jesus and get into God's
[16:07] Prophet they do it now they don't want
[16:10] him behind the pulpit they don't want
[16:11] him to bring it it's like well I'll just
[16:13] give him a few minutes here and there
[16:14] it's back so friends the Bible proof
[16:16] that this is a lie is very similar to a
[16:18] previous video the Bible never teaches
[16:20] dead men take the pulpits of living men
[16:23] remember the word Pastor is used nine
[16:26] times in the King James version and
[16:27] never speaks of a dead man being a
[16:29] pastor or a prophet or anything in the
[16:31] Bible Ministry six times the word Bishop
[16:33] is used and it never talks about a dead
[16:35] Bishop still having the authority of a
[16:37] living Bishop
[16:39] every time one of God's servants died he
[16:41] raised up another one like in the case
[16:43] of when Moses died God raised up Joshua
[16:45] again according to Joshua 1 verses 1 and
[16:48] 2 Deuteronomy 31 14 numbers 27 15-21 and
[16:52] second Timothy 2 verse 2.
[16:55] friends where did Saint Paul ever say
[16:57] put only the seventh Church age
[16:59] messenger back in the Pulpit Paul never
[17:02] said that
[17:03] so Branham Tabernacle was adding to the
[17:05] Bible and taking away from the Bible
[17:07] which has severe repercussions if they
[17:09] don't repent
[17:10] and remember brother Brandon told us in
[17:12] the church age book the seventh Church
[17:13] age messenger could not add one word or
[17:16] one iota to the gospel of Saint Paul and
[17:19] that's how we would know that he was the
[17:21] seventh Church age messenger Paul's
[17:23] solution to preachers dying was teach
[17:26] other Faithful Men like II Timothy 2
[17:28] verse 2 says and that fulfills God's
[17:31] promise that he will always have a
[17:33] witness a living witness on the Earth
[17:36] who looks at the written word believes
[17:38] it believes in the Supernatural believes
[17:40] in the Holy Ghost and will manifest to
[17:42] his generation
[17:44] let's look at a few brother random
[17:45] quotes first brother Ram never said when
[17:47] I'm gone the preachers will kick me out
[17:49] of their pulpits and you'll need to put
[17:51] me back in that is so ridiculous
[17:54] where do the tapes of brother Ramsay put
[17:56] me back in the Pulpit after I'm dead
[17:58] and friends I wish Brenham Tabernacle
[18:00] would answer this question where is
[18:01] Saint Paul's Pulpit since we'll be
[18:04] judged by Paul's Gospel according to
[18:06] Romans 2 verse 16 and the numerous
[18:08] quotes brother Adam said his converts
[18:10] were resting on the fact that we'll be
[18:12] judged by Paul's gospel so Branham
[18:14] Tabernacle needs to put Paul back in the
[18:16] pulpit and what about Jesus
[18:18] so this again shows Brown Tabernacle is
[18:21] exalting brother Branham to being equal
[18:22] to God because they're saying the tapes
[18:25] Can't Fail prophets never make mistakes
[18:26] every word is thus say the lord they're
[18:29] worshiping brother Branham in the tapes
[18:30] and making him equal with Jesus and
[18:32] friends I want to bring out a few more
[18:34] thoughts in that recording of Branham
[18:36] tabernacle's Pastor they were going to
[18:37] play the tape from 1965 what house will
[18:40] you Bill me brother random preached this
[18:42] right before brother Perry green
[18:43] preached and why didn't Branham
[18:46] Tabernacles Pastor mentioned that
[18:47] brother Branham said Tucson Tabernacle
[18:50] was now his home Church brother Ram said
[18:52] quote this is my church let's listen to
[18:54] the quote
[18:56] they need Sunday school teachers they're
[18:59] going to need a stand
[19:01] and I want to say this so that you
[19:04] thoroughly understand
[19:07] this is my church
[19:12] I've been here three years
[19:15] and I've had one door open to me that
[19:18] was brother Mackie asked me come preach
[19:21] God bless him
[19:22] and now that brother green God has sent
[19:24] him in here and opened us up at church
[19:27] of like Precious faith that we believe
[19:29] in we are to be very grateful to God you
[19:32] can't ever service take every place that
[19:35] we can and if we're asked to call on to
[19:40] pray to seek to do let's be soldiers not
[19:43] at the it's anxious to do it
[19:46] keep the message honorable then brother
[19:49] random said he didn't have to go back to
[19:50] Jeffersonville to record any more tapes
[19:53] he could also do a Tucson Tabernacle
[19:55] brother random made Tucson Tabernacle
[19:57] equal to Branham Tabernacle why isn't
[19:59] Branham Tabernacle saying that today why
[20:01] aren't they saying what the tapes say
[20:03] let's listen to brother Ram say we don't
[20:04] have to do that no more
[20:06] I usually I had to drive all the way to
[20:09] Jeffersonville Indiana to give a message
[20:11] that God gave me Amen to bring it to the
[20:13] people go all the way to Jeffersonville
[20:15] Indiana and each one of you stringing
[20:17] across the country and hooking up the
[20:18] wires and things to get the message
[20:20] because that's what we're living on
[20:22] that's what we're here for well
[20:25] we don't have to do that no more
[20:28] God gives me a message I can walk right
[20:31] here to pulpit and preaching I feel free
[20:34] when I Believe by that God Almighty will
[20:38] bless you if you will just stand by this
[20:41] church this group of people
[20:43] also here's another quote Brandon
[20:45] Tabernacle often misinterprets it's from
[20:47] the smyrnan church age chapter four in
[20:49] the church age book mother Ram said
[20:51] quote but of course all those who go out
[20:53] don't always learn how necessary it is
[20:55] to speak only what the messenger has
[20:57] spoken end quote
[20:59] and so Branham Tabernacle will say you
[21:01] can only say what the tapes say only
[21:03] speak what the messenger is spoken again
[21:06] they've misunderstood this quote this
[21:08] quote does not mean be a parrot and say
[21:10] everything brother Branham said and
[21:12] that's all you can say if that's the
[21:13] case does Branham Tabernacle want me to
[21:16] say what brother Brandon said in 1952
[21:18] that the third person of the trinity
[21:20] dwelled in brother random's heart and
[21:22] now should dwell in our hearts is that
[21:24] what I'm supposed to say as a preacher
[21:25] of course not brother random grune is
[21:28] revelation
[21:28] just random Tabernacle want me to say
[21:30] that women have sperm as brother Brandon
[21:32] said in 1965 does Branham Tabernacle
[21:35] want me to say Rebecca married her bride
[21:38] as brothers said in numerous cases he
[21:40] just had a slip of the tongue Branham
[21:42] Tabernacle want me to say that the
[21:44] United States and the world will go
[21:46] through total Annihilation by 1977. is
[21:49] that what Brandon Tabernacle wants me to
[21:50] say
[21:51] and Friends remember I believe brother
[21:52] branham's a genuine Prophet I use his
[21:54] quotes scriptures principles doctrines
[21:57] revelations in every sermon that I
[21:58] preach I've done that for over 19 years
[22:01] but it is utter Insanity it's an evil
[22:04] spirit to say every word on tape is thus
[22:06] saith the Lord and that's what this
[22:07] Series has aimed to do show the
[22:09] ridiculous lies the sinful Lies coming
[22:12] out of bread and Tabernacle
[22:14] getting back to the what house will you
[22:16] build me sermon why didn't Branham
[22:18] Tabernacles Pastor read these quotes
[22:20] where brother Brandon said he didn't
[22:21] want to take up Perry Green's time Perry
[22:24] green was the pastor and brother Brown
[22:25] didn't want to take the pastor's time
[22:27] notice brother Brown never said brother
[22:30] Perry you should sit down and put me
[22:32] back in the Pulpit that's a lie from
[22:34] Brenham Tabernacle but let's listen to
[22:36] the quote brother Ram didn't want to
[22:37] take the pastor's time
[22:39] I don't want to take brother Green's
[22:41] time here because I heard brother green
[22:43] several times speak and uh certainly was
[22:47] influenced unless he brought the word of
[22:49] the Lord to us there's a few more quotes
[22:51] brother Branham said Perry green
[22:53] preaches the message that brother
[22:55] Branham believed he didn't play the
[22:57] tapes he preached it and brother Branham
[22:59] commended him for that brother Branham
[23:01] told the people it was their duty to
[23:03] back up the preacher back up brother
[23:05] Perry green why didn't random
[23:07] Tabernacles Pastor read those quotes see
[23:09] leadership at Brenham Tabernacle they
[23:11] just pick and choose the quotes that
[23:13] meet their propaganda that agree with
[23:16] their lies they avoid all these other
[23:18] quotes that are so easy to hear so easy
[23:20] to acknowledge and believe but they
[23:22] don't want to believe the truth so they
[23:24] ignore these quotes when will Branham
[23:26] Tabernacle say what these tapes say
[23:28] brother green preaches the same thing
[23:31] I believe in amen he's left his home
[23:34] he's left his people he's left his
[23:36] church he doesn't I'll say I believe
[23:38] it's a not only should be in our hearts
[23:41] it should be our duty to back him up
[23:44] everything that we can
[23:46] pretend the services that come here to
[23:49] worship and to make this a place
[23:52] where God can reveal to us the things
[23:56] that he has for us to reveal and as his
[23:58] word says
[24:00] and lastly brother Brandon prays a
[24:01] prayer for Perry green he's a preacher
[24:03] of the message he's not a tape player of
[24:05] the message brother Ram said may he
[24:07] carry this message Lord into the City
[24:09] and wherever you'll call him brother
[24:11] bran prayed that God would let him have
[24:12] the hearts of the people that he might
[24:14] teach them and lead them and direct them
[24:15] in the path that we all desire to walk
[24:18] Granite Lord
[24:19] blessed brother green dear God who are
[24:22] blessed in Jesus name
[24:25] may he care this message Lord
[24:29] into this city and wherever you have
[24:31] called
[24:33] maybe loyal fill with the spirit living
[24:37] a life above reproach
[24:40] God
[24:42] let him have the hearts of the people
[24:45] that he might teach them and lead them
[24:48] and direct them in the past
[24:50] that we all desire to walk
[24:53] granted Lord bless his faithful wife
[24:56] with little children
[24:58] bless our efforts here together as
[25:01] Christian Brothers here on Earth that we
[25:03] even care this gospel to the ends of the
[25:06] world
[25:07] send your spirit upon him God
[25:11] we pray in Jesus Christ's name as we get
[25:14] into you amen
[25:16] God bless you brother Perry brother
[25:22] so brother Graham never prays for
[25:24] brother Perry to put him back in the
[25:25] pulpit
[25:26] but instead he prays brother Perry will
[25:28] find his place in the fightful ministry
[25:30] and carry the gospel all around the
[25:32] world which he did Brother Peregrine
[25:34] fulfilled brother Ram's prayer God heard
[25:36] brother in his prayer and fulfilled it
[25:38] in brother Perry Green's life
[25:40] in closing
[25:42] friends we've come to the end of this
[25:43] video series I hope it's been a blessing
[25:45] remember there are six sins at least
[25:47] that Brenham Tabernacle is constantly
[25:49] guilty of
[25:51] and I share this in part one of the
[25:53] video series they're guilty of causing
[25:56] preachers to neglect their gifts they're
[25:58] guilty of neglecting Gathering
[26:00] physically more as we see that day
[26:02] approaching they're guilty of adding to
[26:04] the Bible they're guilty of taking away
[26:07] from the Bible they're guilty of
[26:09] idolatry by worshiping brother Branham
[26:11] and the tapes by making his every word
[26:13] thus saith the Lord
[26:15] six they're guilty of name-calling
[26:17] calling faithful preachers Demas
[26:19] unbeliever make-believer there's
[26:21] actually a seventh they're guilty of
[26:23] saying preachers are anointed by Satan
[26:25] when rightly dividing the word of Truth
[26:27] as Branham Tabernacles blog post
[26:29] expressed
[26:30] and remember friends from part one I've
[26:33] emailed Branham Tabernacle repeatedly
[26:34] with five simple questions they will not
[26:36] answer this shows they're breaking other
[26:38] scriptures like first Peter 3 15 they're
[26:41] supposed to have an answer for every one
[26:43] of the hope that they have within them
[26:45] and they won't even answer these five
[26:46] simple questions
[26:47] the Brenham Tabernacle people and
[26:49] leadership are guilty of not saying what
[26:52] the tapes say and adding to what the
[26:54] tapes say of course this proves their
[26:56] leader is not a prophet he does not meet
[26:59] all the qualifications of a prophet as I
[27:02] have expressed in other videos if you
[27:03] want links to those let me know and
[27:05] friends this series could go on but I'm
[27:06] going to try to stop now nearly every
[27:09] week on Brenham tabernacle's blog post
[27:11] there are lies so it's almost as if
[27:13] there's new lies every single week or
[27:16] the same lie told in a different way
[27:17] every single week
[27:19] so let's pray for them
[27:21] father God as we close this series have
[27:23] mercy Lord God please bring the elect to
[27:25] repentance that they can leave this
[27:27] denominational system that's been built
[27:29] up in Jeffersonville with these seven
[27:31] Commandments from the Bible they're
[27:33] breaking in these 24 plus lies
[27:36] God please have mercy and may the spirit
[27:38] of Truth guide the elect Believers out
[27:41] of this false movement I ask it in Jesus
[27:43] Christ's name amen
[27:45] if you have any questions concerns or
[27:48] testimonies about this video please
[27:49] contact me
[27:51] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[27:54] the desire of your heart
