TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] You have then been formed into the living image of the living God. You've heard from your theophony. If this earthly body be dissolved, we have one waiting. Greetings, friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to show how there are times in the Bible when believers heard from someone else's theophony. They did not hear from their own theophony, but they heard from someone else's. So, this video is a followup to yesterday's video by the grace of God. And again, friends, this is a great opportunity to rightly divide the word of truth to search the scriptures daily whether these things be so. The question we're looking at is, can someone hear from their own theophony? God's prophet, brother Brandham, said this in who is this? Melzdc, February 21st, 1965. Looking at the whole quote, he said, "Then after you recognized the very word of God was eagle food, then you left the other thing. You have then been formed into the living image of the living God." You heard from your theophony, "If this earthly body be dissolved, we have one waiting." So the Bible verse, Brother quotes is 2 Corinthians 5:1. So let's look at that here briefly by God's grace. We'll start with verse one. For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Verse two, for in this we grown earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven. Let's read verse three and four as well. If so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked. So that means believers will have a theophony that's eternal. Unbelievers will not have an eternal theophony. They'll have a theophony. They have to have some spiritual body they go in when their flesh body is dead and is buried here on the earth. But the Bible makes it seem like they have a naked theophony that is not eternal. The believer's theophony would be a white robe most likely. The Bible speaks of that in numerous occasions. Even the Jewish souls under the altar are given white robes. And the white robe is the righteousness of Christ according to Revelation chapter 19. Let's look at 2 Corinthians 5:4. For we that are in this tabernacle do grown being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life. So brother Brandon makes this statement, you heard from your theophony. But if we go back to the scripture, there's nothing in this passage that says we heard from our theophony. From this passage, it seems we are groaning for our theophony. So, we're longing for heaven. We're homesick for heaven, for our theophony body, our eternal body. But again, I just put this on the shelf. If brother A said it, then I want to search it out. I want to give him the benefit of doubt as a true prophet of God, which he was and is. But for this video again, I thought I'd show two cases where people heard from other theophonyies, someone else's theophony. And then we could look at a third case where people saw others in their theophony. And these would be very familiar by God's grace. So the first one is Jesus on Mount Transfiguration. He saw and heard from two other theophanes. The theophony of Moses and the Theophony of Elijah. This is in Matthew 17. Also Luke chapter 9. And I'm going to read out of Luke 9 in verse 29. Jesus as he prayed, his countenance was changed. He was given white and glistening garments. And then there talked with him two men which were Moses and Elias who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem. So here's Jesus hearing from the theophanes of Moses and Elijah. They were talking about his crucifixion that he would have to endure for the joy that was set before him. And brother Ram also said this was a foreshadowing of the rapture. Moses represents the dead in Christ that will rise first. And then Elijah represents the believers that are alive and remain and will go to meet the Lord in the air as spoken of in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 and 1 Corinthians chapter 15. So that's the first case of someone hearing from other theophanes. And as far as I can find, there's only two cases in the Bible. The second one is in the Old Testament. 1st Samuel 28 7 through 20. This is when King Saul goes to the witch of Endor and requests to speak to Samuel and Samuel's theophony is brought up and he looks like an old man, the Bible says, and he's able to give Saul information about what's going to happen to him. In 1st Samuel 28:14, the Bible said, "An old man cometh up covered with a mantle." So Samuel had a spiritual theophony that looked like an old man in a mantle. And then Samuel prophesies to King Saul because that's what prophets do. They prophesy. And brother Ram said, "Whatever you are on this earth, you'll be that in the next life as well." And so Samuel is still a prophet. That's why I said earlier, brother Random is still a prophet just like St. Paul, St. John, St. Peter, Agabus, many other prophets. But Samuel prophesies in verse 19, tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me. Of course, that would have been in the bosom of Abraham as Jesus talked about in the book of Luke. So those are the two cases where a person hears from other theophanes, but they did not hear from their own theophony. Then Matthew 27:52 and 53 is where Jesus resurrected and many of the graves were open and many of the Old Testament saints rose from the dead. And some people think these resurrected saints were in theophanes or perhaps they were already in glorified bodies. I don't know. In fact, I'm just thinking about that right now. I'm not sure what type of body they were in, whether it was theophony or glorified because Jesus no doubt would have raised with a glorified body. And the Bible said the graves were open and many bodies of the saints which slept arose. So there it mentions bodies. So it looks like it's perhaps the dead bodies were resurrected into a glorified condition and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many. So we're not told that there was any communication between these resurrected saints and the living believers or any living person there in Jerusalem. We're not told that there's any communication. But the people that were still alive in Jerusalem did see the resurrected saints. And again, I'm not sure which bodies they were in. Perhaps they were in all three bodies. The original flesh body, but that was now in a glorified condition and their theophony was inside of that glorified body. I'm not sure. But I just wanted to show those three cases today. Two cases where people actually talked to other Theophies, but not their own. And then a case where people living on earth saw resurrected bodies perhaps theophanes or perhaps glorified bodies. So in closing friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. I really appreciate the comments there. Perhaps tomorrow I'll do a video where I can go through some of the comments. So let's keep searching the scriptures daily whether these things be so. As Acts 17:1 says about the Bereans, they were more noble than those in Thessalonica because every day they searched the scriptures. Let's continue to do that. The Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth. And friends, perhaps I should do this more, but if you are not saved, you need to repent of your sins, confess all your sins to the Lord Jesus Christ, accept the pardoning mercy of the blood of Jesus Christ, and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and then you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. There's no reason to wait. Today can be the day of salvation. So we rejoice in the power of the cross of Jesus Christ. And now the resurrected Lord Jesus has sent his Holy Ghost to the earth today and his spirit is seeking souls that want to be saved that want to be forgiven of all their sins and have a promise of eternal life. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed. [Music]
