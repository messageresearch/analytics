[0:02] amen you don't even know where you're a
[0:04] man or woman it's a it's an Abomination
[0:07] for a woman to put on a garment that
[0:08] pertains to a man the great unchanging
[0:11] God doesn't
[0:12] change greetings friends in the
[0:15] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:18] the purpose of this video is to show how
[0:20] God's Prophet brother William brandham
[0:23] continues to be Vindicated for exposing
[0:27] the sin and wickedness of the Hollywood
[0:30] agenda to promote
[0:33] homosexuality I'm Jesse Smith pastor of
[0:36] bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan
[0:38] Ohio USA for the past 17 years and by
[0:42] God's grace I defend the Bible
[0:43] revelations that Jesus Christ revealed
[0:46] to his true Prophet The Late William
[0:49] brandham 1909 to 1965 and I also defend
[0:53] The Godly Christian character of William
[0:56] brandham here's the outline for the
[0:58] video first will show the Bible warning
[1:01] of the homosexual
[1:03] agenda second we'll show quotes from
[1:05] God's Prophet brother brandham third
[1:08] I'll overview a video I saw from the
[1:10] good fight Ministries and share some
[1:13] resources that might help you and lastly
[1:16] we'll look at warnings for believers and
[1:19] then of course warnings of corrupt
[1:21] fruits beginning with Bible warning in
[1:25] Luke 17:
[1:27] 28-30 really verses 2 8- 37 Jesus Christ
[1:32] prophesied that as it was in the days of
[1:34] Noah and Sodom Jesus said even thus
[1:37] shall be in the day when the son of man
[1:39] is revealed so Jesus was speaking so
[1:42] Jesus was speaking of the end of the
[1:44] times of the Gentiles of course when he
[1:46] would reveal himself as son of man and a
[1:49] son of man is a prophet in human flesh
[1:51] and of course this is referring to Jesus
[1:54] Christ anointing William brandom to be a
[1:56] prophet of God here in this last and
[1:58] final Church age the seventh Church age
[2:01] the latan church age and for the sake of
[2:04] this video I'm just going to emphasize
[2:07] Jesus saying as it was in the days of
[2:09] lot so the days of lot were days of the
[2:13] most heinous corrupt sins it's described
[2:16] in Genesis 19 you see it specifically in
[2:19] Genesis 19:
[2:21] 4-1 you see gangs of men doing the most
[2:25] heinous and wicked acts and I've got to
[2:27] be careful what I say of course just a
[2:29] disclaimer some of the content on this
[2:30] video will be inappropriate for children
[2:33] so please use discretion on who hears
[2:36] this video so in Genesis 19 we see the
[2:38] very height of the wickedness of Sodom
[2:41] before God destroyed it it was gangs of
[2:43] men surrounding houses in order to do
[2:47] their most wicked desires it was the
[2:49] homosexual agenda so Jesus Christ
[2:52] prophesied the conditions of the world
[2:54] would have to get to this state when he
[2:57] would return as a son of man and so the
[2:59] homosexual agenda was just beginning to
[3:01] take off in the lifetime of brother
[3:03] brandham of course now it's been
[3:06] legalized I think in 2015 by the Supreme
[3:09] Court of the United States friends
[3:12] really we're only 59 years since brother
[3:13] Brandon passed that's very little time
[3:15] from God's perspective because God is
[3:17] outside of time a few other verses that
[3:20] go along with this warning is of course
[3:21] Deuteronomy 225 it's an Abomination for
[3:24] a man to wear that which pertaineth to a
[3:27] woman and also a woman to wear that
[3:29] which pertaineth to to a man and sadly
[3:31] those people without understanding think
[3:32] that's only an Old Testament verse but
[3:34] they don't understand that most of the
[3:36] Abominations from the Old Testament were
[3:38] moral laws of God and they carry over to
[3:40] the New Testament I have an entire video
[3:42] on that if you like to watch it I'll put
[3:44] the link in the
[3:46] description then of course 1 Timothy 2:9
[3:50] commands modest clothing for Christians
[3:52] and usually it's the sexually immoral
[3:54] whether homosexual or hor mongers that
[3:57] dress immodestly so immodest clothing is
[4:00] one of the first steps into this sinful
[4:03] slippery slope leading down the path to
[4:06] the lowest form of debauchery and
[4:09] wickedness which is that Genesis 19: 4-1
[4:13] description the homosexual
[4:16] agenda next let's look at some quotes
[4:18] from God's Prophet brother
[4:20] brandham and just to give you an idea
[4:22] about how many times brother brandham
[4:23] mentioned Deuteronomy 225 it's close to
[4:26] 100 times 64 times brother om sets
[4:30] Abomination for a man to wear that which
[4:33] pertaineth to a woman and vice versa 20
[4:36] times he cited Deuteronomy 225 with the
[4:39] words Abomination and clothing then
[4:41] about 10 times he cited Deuteronomy 225
[4:44] with the words Abomination and
[4:46] crossdressing or dressing here's just
[4:49] one quote from doors and door February
[4:51] 6th 1965 notice brother random connects
[4:54] crossdressing with also the hairstyles
[4:58] of course this is all connected these
[4:59] sins are all connected once a person
[5:01] starts cutting their hair the wrong way
[5:03] so for a woman if she cuts her hair
[5:06] that's a total disgrace if a man grows
[5:08] his hair out long that's an awful
[5:10] disgrace brother random courageously
[5:12] stands up for Deuteronomy 225 in the
[5:14] Bible encouraging telling us to act like
[5:17] Sons and Daughters of god let's listen
[5:19] to the quote Oh I thought what a thing
[5:21] for
[5:23] Christianity women stop that wearing
[5:26] them clothes like that men stop that
[5:28] tell them muddy jokes and all that stuff
[5:31] we're Sons and Daughters of the
[5:34] king dressed like a queen dress like a a
[5:38] lady act like a gentleman don't let your
[5:42] hair grow down like this the Bible said
[5:44] it's wrong nature teaches it for a man
[5:46] to have long hair and it's a disgrace
[5:48] and a common thing for even a woman to
[5:50] pray with her
[5:52] haircut and how about these it's a it's
[5:54] an Abomination for a woman to put on a
[5:56] garment that pertains to a man the great
[5:59] un changing God doesn't change but yet
[6:01] today it's just as Loose as the rest of
[6:03] our nation
[6:04] is a shame let's act like Sons and
[6:07] Daughters of god let's live like it we
[6:10] are we are sons of a king we we're right
[6:14] M this bunch of mess and dirt and filth
[6:17] around here people call themselves
[6:18] Christians and still acting like that
[6:21] here's another quote from Satan's Eden
[6:23] brother brandom rebukes these men for
[6:24] wearing bangs like girls putting curlers
[6:28] in their hair
[6:30] brother Bram calls them big sissies but
[6:32] brother Ram cites the scripture judgment
[6:34] begins at the house of God of course
[6:37] what brother Brandon was seeing this
[6:39] crossdressing agenda was just in its
[6:41] seed form now we see the mature form of
[6:44] it it's such a disgrace that some people
[6:46] rebuke brother brandham for calling
[6:48] these people out but time has shown
[6:51] brother Brenham was led by the Holy
[6:53] Ghost to give These Warnings and rebuke
[6:55] these people for getting under the
[6:57] spirit of perversion trying to change
[7:00] their genders these teenage boys trying
[7:02] to act like girls but for us as
[7:05] Believers it's such a Vindication that
[7:06] brother brand was truly led by the Holy
[7:09] Ghost let's listen to the quote now he
[7:12] now wears her bangs also he Combs them
[7:17] down puts a curler in them some of the
[7:19] most sickly sights I've ever seen in my
[7:21] life is some of those kids out here
[7:23] today with their bangs combed down like
[7:25] this and colored bleached hair with some
[7:26] kind of a peroxide something and bleach
[7:28] their hair and and curlers making Banks
[7:31] you big am that's a horrible thing
[7:34] to say from a p pit but judgment begins
[7:35] at the house of God you don't even know
[7:38] where you're a man or woman amen and I
[7:41] understand that our United States Army
[7:42] is coming out next in shars oh my Lord
[7:45] that's right see what the perversion is
[7:50] it's a woman's
[7:51] clothes where's her Banks the other day
[7:53] I was over and so friends I could play
[7:56] many more quotes but I'm trying to keep
[7:57] this video shorter let's move to the
[7:59] third section the good fight video I'll
[8:02] leave a link in the description to this
[8:03] video and again be careful who you let
[8:05] watch this video it has more mature
[8:07] content not fit for
[8:09] children this video was put out on
[8:11] January 12th of this year 2024 and as I
[8:15] was scrolling on my YouTube app I saw
[8:18] this title and I was shocked by the
[8:20] title because it said it was exposing
[8:22] Hollywood's crossdressing agenda and of
[8:24] course my mind instantly went to how
[8:27] brother Randon rebuked crossdressing now
[8:29] just to summarize this video they talk
[8:31] about numerous Hollywood Elite people
[8:34] some of them I'm not very familiar with
[8:36] and I shouldn't be because I'm a holy
[8:37] ghost filed Christian of course I don't
[8:39] watch any of their content now but as a
[8:41] sinner I I lived as a sinner for nearly
[8:43] 19 years so some of these names I am
[8:44] familiar with but the main idea of the
[8:46] video is to show how a comedian named
[8:48] Cat Williams was showing how Hollywood
[8:51] Executives were trying to get men to
[8:52] wear dresses I guess Martin Lawrence
[8:55] wore dresses in the Big Mama's House
[8:57] videos or movies
[8:59] one of them was in 2006 I remember the
[9:02] movie Mrs Doubtfire I never watched it
[9:04] but it from 1993 Robin Williams dressed
[9:06] as a woman friends look what happened to
[9:09] his life he committed suicide then there
[9:11] was a movie called To Wong Fu from 1995
[9:15] I never saw that the bird cage 1996 I
[9:18] never saw that all these movies
[9:20] contained crossdressing drag queens
[9:23] Abominations in the sight of God and
[9:25] then the video showed how TD Jake
[9:28] associated with Ty Perry Tyler Perry is
[9:31] apparently a comedian he's a
[9:33] crossdresser in his movies about a woman
[9:36] called Meda and this has helped promote
[9:40] the trans agenda and the authors of this
[9:43] video think that the enemy has used
[9:45] Tyler Perry and TD Jake to help the
[9:48] black community accept drag queens
[9:51] through comedy one thing I liked about
[9:53] this video is it showed a black preacher
[9:56] condemning Tyler Perry's trans agenda
[9:59] so it was really wonderful to see that
[10:01] preacher stand up for the truth in this
[10:03] subject of crossdressing and Deuteronomy
[10:06] 225 the video showed Dave Chappelle was
[10:09] pressured by Hollywood Executives three
[10:12] times to wear dresses and then a man
[10:14] named Brandon T Jackson believes he's
[10:16] cursed because he wore a dress on a
[10:18] movie before moving on from this good
[10:21] fight video I was talking to my wife and
[10:23] she noted that good fight is rightly
[10:26] Disturbed that Hollywood is trying to
[10:29] feminized men but what good fight did
[10:32] not recognize is that the same shock and
[10:36] outrage was expressed about a hundred
[10:38] years ago when women started wearing
[10:40] pants so it's our prayer that good fight
[10:43] will eventually recognize the
[10:45] masculinization of women that took place
[10:46] a 100 years ago and begin teaching for
[10:50] women to wear dresses and skirts and for
[10:52] men only to wear
[10:54] pants and friends here are some
[10:56] resources I want to share of course the
[10:59] First Resource is brother BR sermons
[11:01] again there's at least 100 probably more
[11:04] quotes from his sermons that condemn
[11:06] crossdressing according to Deuteronomy
[11:09] 22:5 remember God is unchanging he said
[11:12] I am the Lord thy God I change not if
[11:15] crossdressing was abominable to God in
[11:17] the days of Moses and Jesus fulfilled
[11:20] all the Moses's commands then Jesus
[11:22] would have been against crossdressing
[11:24] and then he's the same yesterday today
[11:26] and forever another resource is my 2009
[11:29] 18 book restoring Christian modesty
[11:31] God's perfect will for your outward
[11:32] appearance this book covers all the
[11:35] basics of A Modest Christian appearance
[11:38] in chapter 3 it covers the four
[11:39] guidelines for modest clothing and one
[11:41] of them is dressing according to your
[11:43] gender and that's of course according to
[11:45] the word of God chapter four is on hair
[11:47] length chapter five is on jewelry makeup
[11:49] tattoos and high heels chapter six to me
[11:52] is very powerful in relation to this
[11:54] video it's connecting American fashion
[11:56] history with the Bible and it shows a
[11:58] Time timeline from the 1800s to the
[12:00] current on how Satan has slowly weakened
[12:03] the standards for Holiness in the late
[12:06] 1800s the enemy anointed Amelia Bloomer
[12:08] to introduce Bloomers women in pants
[12:12] then of course in universities female
[12:14] universities mainly they got the women
[12:17] to crossdress in their plays and then
[12:19] around the time of World War I women
[12:21] were forced to work in factories and
[12:23] they were forced to wear pants in the
[12:25] Roaring 20s the women started cutting
[12:27] their hair bobbing their hair like men
[12:30] wearing makeup wearing more seductive
[12:33] skirts and then World War II in the
[12:36] 1940s allowed more women to go to the
[12:38] factories and wear pants and
[12:40] crossdressing just became a common thing
[12:43] the 1960s was the rise of the sexual
[12:46] Revolution the miniskirt was popularized
[12:48] and then Hollywood started promoting the
[12:51] sexual Revolution and one resource I
[12:53] found said the 1970s can be summed up in
[12:56] one word pants of course this was women
[12:59] wearing pants I have entire chapter
[13:01] laying out all these resources all these
[13:04] historical facts a couple in particular
[13:06] are this book called women in pants 2003
[13:10] if you want to know the extreme uproar
[13:13] that happened in the United States when
[13:14] women started wearing pants please read
[13:16] this book I share this with one of
[13:18] brother am's accusers in my 2020 debate
[13:21] I doubt he ever read it but I encourage
[13:23] him to read it so he would understand
[13:25] the truth that brother Brandon preached
[13:27] showing how crossdressing was was an
[13:29] Abomination also addressed for the
[13:31] occasion a book written in 1999 of
[13:34] course none of these books were written
[13:35] by
[13:36] Christians while I was sitting in a
[13:38] college course I'm a school teacher I
[13:40] was in an education class and my
[13:42] professor just showed this book and I
[13:45] instantly knew that's the reason I was
[13:46] in this class was to get this book and
[13:48] of course this book shows how the United
[13:51] States fashion changed from its
[13:52] Inception 1700s to the current day and
[13:56] then a lot of these historical facts
[13:58] iuse used in my
[14:00] book let's look at warnings finally
[14:03] friends as Holy Ghost filled Christians
[14:05] let's remember to always stay away from
[14:07] Hollywood Disney and just movies in
[14:10] general there are very few movies that
[14:12] Christians should watch at all remember
[14:14] first Thessalonians 5:22 abstain from
[14:16] all appearance of evil let's remember
[14:19] how Satan often attacks people he gets
[14:22] them to laugh at sin he gets them to let
[14:25] their guard down friends we must not
[14:27] laugh at sin we must sigh and cry for
[14:29] the Abominations done in the city as
[14:32] Ezekiel 9 says we must not compromise on
[14:35] crossdressing that's why I humbly say to
[14:38] the parents of Believers please don't
[14:40] let your daughters wear pajama pants to
[14:42] bed I have a video about
[14:45] that it's just so sad you know often we
[14:47] see people make one little
[14:50] compromise and then when families learn
[14:52] to compromise in one area then it'll
[14:55] multiply just like how the leaven
[14:57] impacts the entire lump of dough as
[15:00] Jesus said our sisters should not even
[15:03] trim their hair our brothers should not
[15:05] let their hair grow out so it looks like
[15:07] it's women's hair let's take warning
[15:09] from these things of course we Rejoice
[15:12] that God's Prophet is currently being
[15:14] Vindicated for exposing all these wicked
[15:17] things well let's take warning as well
[15:20] and also friends remember I've shared
[15:22] this on a few podcasts some of brother
[15:24] Ram's accusers that have left the
[15:26] message are making so many sinful com
[15:28] compromises and I'm not going to call
[15:30] names but I will put their podcast on
[15:32] the video here in one podcast a man says
[15:35] he wants to dress up like Dracula now of
[15:38] course Dracula is a fictitious
[15:40] fornicating blood sucker and murderer
[15:43] but yet this man wants to dress up like
[15:46] him and have his children dress up like
[15:48] him you can listen to it on this podcast
[15:51] and the same man on another podcast more
[15:52] recently interviewed someone who left
[15:54] the message and they're crying and just
[15:57] happy that one of their sisters is now
[16:01] non-binary and this accuser brother
[16:04] brandom doesn't try to correct the woman
[16:06] for this non-binary stand in fact he
[16:09] just cries apparently tears of happiness
[16:13] for this family to be free from the
[16:15] message of course I don't know if this
[16:17] is a good message church or a bad Church
[16:19] it sounds like a bad church and if this
[16:21] family did leave a sinful Message Church
[16:24] well then that's good but what I'm
[16:26] pointing out is that when people leave
[16:28] the TRU true Bible teachings of brother
[16:29] brandham they open themselves up to evil
[16:32] spirits and here a man accusing brother
[16:34] brandham falsely of course is now
[16:37] idolizing fictitious evil characters he
[16:40] also admits to watching a lot of dirty
[16:43] Evil movies and now he seemingly accepts
[16:46] the non-binary attitude and I didn't
[16:49] even know what non-binary was so I had
[16:50] to look it up from one health.com
[16:53] website it says an adjective describing
[16:56] a person who does not identify exclusive
[16:58] exclusively as a man or a woman so just
[17:01] simply the
[17:02] non-binary attitude defies God's
[17:05] commands and God's truth of Genesis
[17:08] chapter 1 he made them male and female
[17:11] but an evil spirit a perverse Spirit an
[17:14] antichrist spirit will anoint someone to
[17:16] believe well maybe I'm not male all the
[17:18] time maybe I'm not female all the time
[17:20] so let's take warning from all these
[17:23] cases friends and let's stand with the
[17:26] truth in closing
[17:29] friends I hope this video was a blessing
[17:31] by the grace of God I thought it was so
[17:33] fitting that here we see other churches
[17:35] and of course they're not message
[17:36] churches recognizing this evil
[17:39] crossdressing agenda but we can be so
[17:41] thankful in the message of the hour that
[17:43] we've heard God's Prophet brother
[17:44] brandham warn us of this agenda from the
[17:47] moment we heard brother brandham
[17:48] preaching and the Holy Spirit has kept
[17:50] us safe and clean given us These
[17:52] Warnings and we live our lives in
[17:54] accordance and obedience to the
[17:56] revelation of Jesus Christ so friends
[17:59] let's earnestly contend for the faith
[18:01] that was once delivered to the Saints
[18:03] let us not turn Grace into lusciousness
[18:05] as Jude 13 and four says according to
[18:08] Titus Chapter 2 Grace teaches us to deny
[18:11] ungodliness deny crossdressing deny
[18:15] non-binary attitudes deny sinful movies
[18:19] it teaches us to live in Holiness and do
[18:22] Godly holy works for the glory of Jesus
[18:26] Christ as Titus 2 11-4 says the grace of
[18:31] God teaches us to deny ungodliness and
[18:33] worldly lust but to live soberly
[18:35] righteously and godly in this present
[18:37] world looking for that blessed hope and
[18:39] glorious appearing of the great God and
[18:41] our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself
[18:43] for us that he might redeem us from all
[18:45] iniquity and purify unto himself a
[18:48] peculiar people zealous of Good Works
[18:50] let's be zealous through the works of
[18:52] Jesus Christ today and hold up the
[18:55] standard of Holy Ghost filled
[18:57] Christianity
[18:59] if you have any questions concerns or
[19:00] testimonies about this video please
[19:02] contact
[19:04] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[19:07] the desire of your
[19:12] heart
