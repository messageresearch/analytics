[0:00] always so blessed to come here and see
[0:02] the Saints pressing on in the Lord and I
[0:05] love hearing testimonies brother irin
[0:06] Shar just a little testimony got to
[0:08] witness to somebody yesterday God opened
[0:10] a door there so thankful for the
[0:12] supernatural working of the Holy Spirit
[0:14] praise God Numbers Chapter
[0:17] 19 uh we'll read one two and then skip
[0:21] down to nine because I'll be preaching
[0:23] through uh the beginning of this chapter
[0:25] here and uh really the whole chapter is
[0:28] beautiful it's a beautiful type um and I
[0:31] think you'll understand you know uh this
[0:33] basically is a type so this scripture in
[0:36] numbers 19 is a type or
[0:38] foreshadow uh of confessing our sins
[0:41] before we come into the presence of God
[0:43] before church we should confess our sins
[0:46] before we come into service right uh and
[0:49] really every day of our lives right if
[0:51] we want to feel the presence of God like
[0:52] brother Daniel's wonderful testimony
[0:54] there about wanting to feel the presence
[0:55] of God we all want to feel God's
[0:57] presence if we want to do that then uh
[1:00] we have to confess our sins and this is
[1:03] a beautiful type of that by God's
[1:06] grace so numbers uh 191 says and the
[1:09] Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron saying
[1:11] this is the ordinance of the law which
[1:13] the Lord hath commanded saying speak on
[1:15] the children of Israel that they may
[1:16] bring I'm sorry that they bring thee a
[1:18] red heer without spot wherein is no
[1:21] blemish and upon which never came yoke
[1:25] and there's of course all these detailed
[1:27] requirements for the red heer but let's
[1:29] give down to verse 9 let's let's all
[1:31] read verse 9 if we can on three 1 2 3
[1:35] and a man that is clean Shall Gather up
[1:38] the ashes of the hepher and lay them up
[1:41] without the camp in a clean place and it
[1:45] shall be kept for the congregation of
[1:47] the children of Israel for a water of
[1:51] Separation it is a
[1:53] purification for sin so this red heer
[1:57] would be burnt the ashes would be mixed
[1:59] with water and then when someone was uh
[2:02] unclean they'd have to be sprinkled with
[2:04] this Waters of Separation before you
[2:06] could come back into the
[2:09] camp and even before you could go into
[2:12] the Tabernacle of
[2:14] worship so God set this up you had to be
[2:17] purified before you could come in
[2:18] worship how many believe he still feels
[2:20] that way God wants us to come purified
[2:23] Before the Throne of god let's have a
[2:24] word of prayer if you would let's just
[2:26] bow our hearts here as we approach the
[2:28] Lord father God we're thankful for
[2:29] tonight Lord we surrender all Lord we
[2:31] sing such wonderful songs here Lord as
[2:32] we come into your presence Hallelujah we
[2:34] surrender Our Lives God we surrender our
[2:36] thoughts Lord our actions God our our
[2:39] souls we surrender everything to you
[2:41] Lord God have your way tonight Lord God
[2:43] just use me to speak your word Lord even
[2:45] as last night Lord that we were uh
[2:47] visited by the Holy Spirit there in akan
[2:49] we thank you God for that Lord and
[2:51] dealing with or seeing you deal with
[2:53] Souls lord it's such a wonderful thing
[2:54] God we just ask that the same Holy
[2:56] Spirit Lord that was dealing with
[2:57] brother Irvin and uh witnessing last
[3:00] night and and with brother Daniel Lord
[3:02] last night and and there in akan last
[3:04] night Lord the same Holy Spirit that's
[3:06] been working will continue to work here
[3:08] tonight move tonight God for your glory
[3:10] Lord may you be glorified may you be
[3:11] magnified purify us Lord God that we can
[3:14] come into your presence and have
[3:16] fellowship with thee Lord so we'll be
[3:18] grateful we'll be happy when we leave
[3:19] this place thank you for the
[3:20] independence of the Holy Ghost Lord
[3:22] hallelujah thank you for our natural
[3:23] blessings as well we ask all these
[3:25] things in Jesus Christ's name and the
[3:27] Saints said amen amen God bless you as
[3:29] your being
[3:36] seated so I want to back up a little bit
[3:39] and um you know we were here last time
[3:40] two weeks ago and how many enjoyed the
[3:42] Millennium did everybody enjoy that okay
[3:44] well wonderful I want I just thought I'd
[3:46] show you some pictures now that I got
[3:47] the opportunity to so I like visuals I
[3:50] like to see it you know because then my
[3:51] mind can I can picture a little better
[3:53] of course a lot of us are visual
[3:54] Learners here in the 21st century right
[3:57] with all the technology and the screens
[3:59] so you know right after I left the lord
[4:01] gave me a great understanding it's it's
[4:03] very simple to tell which one which of
[4:06] the two events the Bible's talking about
[4:08] is it talking about the Millennium or is
[4:10] it talking about the future home and
[4:12] after I left I think it was the next day
[4:14] I I think I started studying this again
[4:17] and I preach it at our church a few days
[4:19] later and I just found these now there's
[4:22] more than three but I found three very
[4:23] easy attributes that distinguish the
[4:26] Millennium from the future home or the
[4:28] New Jerusalem
[4:30] okay so the Millennium is where we live
[4:32] on the earth in a glorified bodies as we
[4:34] looked at a few weeks
[4:36] ago and we rule over all the sinful
[4:40] people right that make it through the
[4:42] battle of Armageddon we rule over them
[4:45] and Jesus sets some over Nations some
[4:47] over cities so the very least you'll be
[4:50] over one city by God's grace that's at
[4:52] least according to the scripture uh the
[4:54] Christians will rule over at least one
[4:56] city and uh but we looked at that you
[5:00] know briefly last week or two weeks ago
[5:03] but remember Sinners there's still a
[5:05] curse during the Millennium there's
[5:06] still a curse not on us but it's on the
[5:09] Sinners they're still a curse if they
[5:12] get out of line they can be cursed the
[5:13] Bible says it we read it but in the New
[5:16] Jerusalem the Bible said there's no more
[5:17] curse all the curse is done away and
[5:20] brother this this struck me as I left
[5:22] last time CU we were talking about this
[5:25] in the Millennium Nations can be
[5:26] deceived they get deceived at the end at
[5:29] at the at at the end right they get
[5:30] deceived and remember Jesus will send a
[5:32] plague on them and cause no rain to fall
[5:34] if they don't come and worship in
[5:35] Jerusalem amen so there are nations can
[5:39] be deceived Nations can uh disobey Jesus
[5:42] but in the future home all the nations
[5:44] are
[5:45] healed right and then in the Millennium
[5:49] a child could die the Bible say 100
[5:51] years old that's in Isaiah
[5:53] 6520 and the nations are killed at the
[5:55] end because Satan he goes out at after
[5:58] the Thousand Years remember he goes to
[5:59] the for four corners of the earth and he
[6:01] gathers all the people in against Jesus
[6:03] and us at New Jerusalem but fire comes
[6:05] down from heaven I'm sorry not New
[6:07] Jerusalem Jerusalem fire comes down and
[6:09] de devours all Satan's armies and all
[6:12] those people so there still is death in
[6:15] the Millennium but in the New Jerusalem
[6:17] the Bible said there's no more death all
[6:20] right so does that help by God's grace
[6:22] oh you can now you can just you can lay
[6:23] it in there perfectly you can just see W
[6:26] if you're wondering about the scripture
[6:27] it's got to meet whichever conditions it
[6:29] meets it's either Millennium or New
[6:30] Jerusalem Hallelujah that's the picture
[6:33] I drew last time I just have it up there
[6:34] for my sake but this was the one I was
[6:36] talking about in the Millennium it's
[6:38] ezekiel's Temple and just one side of
[6:40] this is 750 ft long and God puts the
[6:44] River of Life through there you can read
[6:45] this in Ezekiel vers or chapters 40
[6:48] through 48 you can read all about it
[6:50] it's a beautiful uh a beautiful story
[6:54] and see all the nations you have to come
[6:55] in one of these three ways I like three
[6:57] that's a good number and when whatever
[6:59] way you whatever Court you come in you
[7:01] can't go out the same way and that's
[7:03] what we experience spiritually today
[7:05] when we come to church we never leave
[7:07] the same we actually leave differently
[7:09] we leave more in love with Jesus how
[7:11] many can say Amen to that it's in it's
[7:13] in Ezekiel if you read it you cannot
[7:15] leave the same way you came you have to
[7:17] leave a different gate and that's what
[7:19] we experience every service Hallelujah I
[7:22] left church last night closer to God
[7:24] than I was when I came
[7:25] Hallelujah I I left church last night
[7:28] more in love with Jesus than I was
[7:29] before Hallelujah Glory so you see all
[7:33] this and remember Jesus is there he'll
[7:35] be in the holies of holies and there'll
[7:37] be no Veil because remember the Bible
[7:39] said there'll be no Ark of the Covenant
[7:41] because the Lord is there Hallelujah we
[7:43] don't need an ark because the Son of God
[7:44] is there the presence of God is there in
[7:47] the body of Jesus Christ amen so that
[7:51] gives you the size here's the millennial
[7:52] Temple size here's a here's American
[7:54] football field now maybe you probably
[7:56] don't know may seen those too often but
[7:58] think about maybe you know 12 or 11
[8:00] football fields can fit in one of these
[8:02] Millennial temples and this is right
[8:05] going to be right there in Jerusalem
[8:07] right for the Thousand Years okay there
[8:09] you can see herod's temple in the days
[8:11] of Jesus when Jesus walked the Earth
[8:12] that's the size Mo I'm sorry Moses
[8:15] Tabernacle uh maybe about three could
[8:17] fit in a football field and Solomon's
[8:18] Temple was about half maybe 2/3 of
[8:21] American football field there you get
[8:22] the size of it now the Ezekiel I'm sorry
[8:25] the millennial Temple is very small
[8:27] compared to the New Jerusalem the
[8:29] millennial Temple is only 750 ft wide
[8:32] but the New Jerusalem each side is
[8:35] 1,500 miles
[8:37] wide so there's no
[8:40] comparison this is this is what it would
[8:42] look like this is the size of the New
[8:44] Jerusalem brother said it goes from
[8:45] Maine to Florida that's just one of the
[8:48] New Jerusalem that's one side of it
[8:51] that's how long it is hallelujah amen
[8:53] and it's a pyramid Saints it's going up
[8:55] like this all the way up you're going up
[8:58] in the presence of God but your body
[8:59] never gets tired Hallelujah you can walk
[9:01] all those steps you you don't have to
[9:03] count your steps because it'll never
[9:04] matter you'll never get tired
[9:06] amen
[9:09] hallelujah and that's what it looks like
[9:11] I love this picture but remember you
[9:13] know uh this picture is not exactly
[9:14] accurate there's no more sea in the in
[9:16] the New Jerusalem there's no more sea
[9:18] and there might be lakes and RI no no
[9:19] doubt there's Rivers uh but there's no
[9:21] more sea so I'm not sure maybe those are
[9:23] lakes I don't know about the I don't I
[9:24] didn't talk to the artist who drew that
[9:26] picture but that's the size of the New
[9:28] Jerusalem and the Bible says it's going
[9:30] to come down right there this is 1,500
[9:32] miles and that's right that's the exact
[9:35] location Hallelujah of where the New
[9:37] Jerusalem is going to be like that one
[9:40] okay it's going to be right there over
[9:42] uh Jerusalem because that's the city of
[9:45] God that's mzc City king of Salem king
[9:48] of Jerusalem king of righteousness king
[9:51] of Peace hallelujah amen that's God's
[9:54] holy place we sing that song great is
[9:56] the Lord and greatly to be praised from
[9:57] the song the city of the great king
[10:00] hallelujah amen the New Jerusalem and
[10:03] this is Clarence larin's drawing of it
[10:05] so this is
[10:06] 1,500 miles long there's three gates on
[10:10] every side that says Gad Reuben and uh
[10:13] Simeon and look here's the River of Life
[10:15] flowing down here and these are all
[10:17] little these are all Mansions the Bible
[10:19] said Jesus went to prepare you one of
[10:20] those
[10:22] Mansions so these are all these houses
[10:25] going up there and there's no need of a
[10:26] temple because Jesus Christ is the
[10:28] temple hallelujah amen there's no need
[10:31] of the sun because the lamb is the light
[10:33] thereof Hallelujah God and man become
[10:36] one this is this is the bride City this
[10:38] is after the Millennium this is in the
[10:40] New Jerusalem that's where we live with
[10:42] Christ hallelujah how many looking
[10:44] forward to that amen God's called you to
[10:47] it amen he's called you he's revealed it
[10:48] to you praise God all these false
[10:50] churches are preaching all the false
[10:52] Doctrine and the Bible says that they
[10:54] can't they're not born again they're
[10:57] lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of
[10:58] God but this is for the city that loves
[11:01] God Hallelujah the people that live
[11:03] there love Jesus Hallelujah and they're
[11:05] washed By the Waters of the word all
[11:08] right now let's get to this message here
[11:10] tonight that's just a brief little
[11:11] review there so you got some visuals now
[11:13] is that all clear by God's grace
[11:15] hopefully hopefully you got the
[11:16] Millennium now I'll preach on the New
[11:18] Jerusalem later this summer by God's
[11:19] grace okay we'll try to do that now our
[11:22] text was numbers 19 now the Waters of
[11:26] separation would happen outside of this
[11:29] is Moses's Tabernacle it has to happen
[11:31] out here you know people like let's say
[11:33] somebody would die in their tent well
[11:35] before they come to worship and as soon
[11:37] as that happened they had to get a
[11:38] priest these are women they'd have to
[11:40] get a priest and go sprinkle that tent
[11:42] and all the people in there because the
[11:44] death somehow you know with with
[11:46] infectious diseases and uh it it would
[11:48] spread right so they had to be cleaned
[11:51] physically and they had to be sprinkled
[11:53] to represented a spiritual cleansing as
[11:55] well but nobody if somebody let's say
[11:57] somebody died in in the tent and you
[11:59] were around that person when they died
[12:01] if you tried to go here they wouldn't
[12:03] let you in because you weren't clean you
[12:05] actually had to wait 7 days a whole week
[12:08] Hallelujah so you can be clean but if
[12:11] you didn't be clean the Bible said theyd
[12:12] cut you off so see before you came to
[12:15] worship you had to be clean all right
[12:18] and that's what this point of this
[12:19] message is about before you come to
[12:21] worship God you got to be clean
[12:22] Hallelujah and God made a way for you to
[12:25] be clean Hallelujah now I don't know if
[12:28] you ever seen this picture
[12:31] no this is how Israel would Camp
[12:33] whenever they would travel anybody see a
[12:36] certain shape in there of how they're
[12:38] how they're camped anybody see a cross
[12:40] in
[12:41] there Hallelujah imagine God looking
[12:45] down from heaven and how does God
[12:47] arrange his people God arranges his
[12:49] people looking down from heaven God sees
[12:51] the cross these are people of the Cross
[12:54] these are people trusting in the cross
[12:56] hallelujah amen there are lives are
[12:59] centered around the cross the word of
[13:01] God their entire makeup looks like a
[13:04] cross God has put Redemption right in
[13:07] their life right in the the order of
[13:09] where they camp and this is this is of
[13:12] course a father and son but if you read
[13:13] Numbers 22 remember Bao took balum up
[13:17] and he looked down he tried to curse him
[13:19] and Bam's like the Holy Spirit came on
[13:20] him said I can't curse him he said I see
[13:23] a unicorn these people are blessed
[13:25] they've got the pillar of fire they've
[13:26] got a prophet he said I can't I can't
[13:29] can't curse them I can only bless them
[13:31] Hallelujah this is what he saw amen he
[13:34] saw he couldn't see anything else God
[13:37] can't curse a people that's trusting in
[13:39] a blood sacrifice God can't curse
[13:42] someone who's trusting in a
[13:43] substitutionary sacrifice are trusting
[13:46] in his system for Redemption for
[13:48] forgiveness for purification Hallelujah
[13:50] for the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[13:53] hallelujah amen now if you study it real
[13:57] closely each one of these had a
[14:00] banner right the ox the eagle The Lion
[14:04] and the man how many familiar with
[14:06] that this was for and remember what was
[14:08] this based on this was all based on what
[14:10] was what Moses saw in heaven so this is
[14:13] the Throne of Jesus in heaven remember
[14:15] there was four there was four cherubims
[14:17] and they had the faces of those animals
[14:20] so Moses saw that in heaven and God said
[14:22] now you got to build that on Earth
[14:24] hallelujah amen glory got the 24 Elders
[14:28] around the throne you got uh the rainbow
[14:30] of Jesus Hallelujah you got the rainbow
[14:32] Covenant Around Jesus lightning and
[14:34] thunder is coming forth from there so
[14:36] Moses saw that pattern up in heaven and
[14:39] he created it or I'm sorry he recreated
[14:41] it on Earth
[14:44] Hallelujah then brother brand tells us
[14:46] these are anointings for the church age
[14:49] right this was the early church age this
[14:51] was the the martyrs this was the man age
[14:54] like Charles finny uh Martin Luther John
[14:56] Wesley but we're under the eagle age
[14:58] we're under under the prophet age by the
[15:00] grace of God hallelujah that's the
[15:02] anointing for today a prophetic
[15:04] Revelation no other church has thus say
[15:07] the Lord like we've got it no other
[15:09] Church understands the Book of
[15:10] Revelation like we understand it praise
[15:12] God the church ages the Seven Seals no
[15:14] other church has that praise God because
[15:16] God has that anointing poured out upon
[15:18] us hallelujah I just read a quote last
[15:20] night they asked brother brandom in 1964
[15:23] brother raham can we join labor unions
[15:26] and brother Ram said yes as long as they
[15:27] don't you know make you sin or something
[15:29] he said but mark my words thus sayith
[15:31] the Lord one day that push to be in a
[15:33] union will come to
[15:35] religion right so I I work in a I used
[15:38] to work in a teachers union I got out of
[15:40] the union now because the Supreme Court
[15:41] said I could so that was good then now
[15:44] they're not going to send my $900 to the
[15:46] Democratic party amen that's that's all
[15:49] I got out of the dues anyway but you
[15:51] know I had to if I want to be a teacher
[15:53] I had to be in the union before right I
[15:54] had to go through that process brother
[15:56] Bram said thus sayith the Lord if one of
[15:58] these days days towards the end time
[16:00] towards the Rapture towards the squeeze
[16:02] time you're going to the churches are
[16:03] going have to join their Union or they
[16:05] can't have church and that's where
[16:06] brother man said they may shut our doors
[16:09] he said but the bride will keep having
[16:10] Church
[16:12] hallelujah amen we have to have it in
[16:14] houses right if if we live to that time
[16:16] we have to we have to have it somewhere
[16:18] by God's
[16:20] grace so we see that by the grace of God
[16:22] we're living under this prophetic
[16:24] anointing brother R could say thus sayth
[16:26] the Lord and we know it's going to
[16:27] happen by God's grace cuz it always came
[16:29] to pass Hallelujah now here's another
[16:31] picture of the Throne of God you got
[16:33] your 24 elders and here's the four
[16:35] beasts everybody see the four beasts
[16:36] there they got the ox the eagle uh the
[16:39] man the lion and then there's the man uh
[16:41] altar of incense got the Candlestick
[16:43] there's Jesus uh and the rainbow I can't
[16:46] see the Rainbow on this one oh yeah it's
[16:48] right here right there's the
[16:51] rainbow okay so Moses saw that and he
[16:53] recreated that on the earth praise God
[16:56] and now we know that those those cherub
[16:58] those four CH Chans are anointings of
[17:01] the Holy Ghost that we live under praise
[17:03] God Amen now I don't know how familiar
[17:07] this this is Moses Tabernacle R if
[17:09] you're pretty familiar with Moses
[17:10] Tabernacle okay so this is that this is
[17:14] the three parts this is the outer court
[17:17] that represents your body so Moses when
[17:20] he built that it was it was for Israel
[17:21] but it's actually speaking of what we
[17:23] would experience because now you're the
[17:25] temple of God Amen yeah this this this
[17:29] this room is a temple this is a place to
[17:30] worship thank God for our sisters open
[17:32] up their homes by God's grace but really
[17:35] you're the temple of God God wants to
[17:37] dwell in you now
[17:39] Hallelujah so see the outer Court had
[17:41] the Brazen altar uh the labor this and
[17:45] then the holy Place represents your
[17:47] spirit and
[17:49] mind but the Hol of holies represents
[17:52] your soul you got a body Spirit Soul
[17:56] everybody see that this is what God was
[17:58] telling Moses Moes Hallelujah God was
[18:00] tell and God was telling us why did
[18:03] God's Temple have three parts because we
[18:05] have three parts and I preach this I
[18:07] have to preach this again sometime but
[18:09] all three parts of your body are calling
[18:11] out feed me feed me all
[18:14] day David said my soul thirsts for the
[18:17] Living God hallelujah that's why you
[18:19] come to church tonight amen you come to
[18:21] church because your soul was saying feed
[18:23] me the word I need the word I need to
[18:25] worship I need the fellowship with the
[18:26] Saints I need more of God amen that's
[18:29] what David said my soul thirst after the
[18:32] Living God
[18:34] hallelujah and uh Ephesians 2 says you
[18:38] have the desires of the body and the
[18:40] mind right your body is all day saying
[18:43] well at least mine saying feed me give
[18:44] me some water give me some coffee you
[18:46] know you got to make sure you give it
[18:48] the right thing though by God's grace
[18:50] right your body saying feed me feed me
[18:52] give me this and your mind is also
[18:54] saying that let me think about something
[18:55] let me figure something out what what I
[18:57] got to work on now right what what uh
[19:00] what what job on the farm do I got to
[19:01] accomplish what do I got to get done see
[19:03] your mind's constantly saying feed me
[19:05] feed me something I can learn or
[19:06] something I can accomplish something I
[19:07] can do and this is what God was showing
[19:10] us that God dwells in a temple it's got
[19:13] three parts to it and God wants to fill
[19:15] all three parts hallelujah hallelujah I
[19:18] tell you being a church like this being
[19:19] a church service like this you got a
[19:21] good opportunity to have all three parts
[19:22] filled with the Holy Ghost amen cu the
[19:26] Bible said when you're gathered in one
[19:27] place with one Accord then the Holy
[19:29] Ghost can come Hallelujah that's right
[19:32] I'm glad our brother could feel it so
[19:33] see our brother fell it right right in
[19:35] here right he feels it in his body when
[19:37] he comes to church when you step in the
[19:38] room you can feel something's different
[19:41] here now at our service last night I
[19:44] didn't feel it to the very end Brothers
[19:46] you know you can you can watch my sermon
[19:48] on YouTube I'm not saying you have to
[19:49] but if you did you know you'd see me
[19:51] excited but it wasn't to the very end
[19:53] till the Holy Ghost fell and I really
[19:55] could feel it you know so the whole
[19:57] service I'm preaching about an hour and
[19:58] a half and I'm I'm just saying Lord you
[20:00] know in my mind I'm like Lord am I
[20:01] preaching the right thing that you know
[20:02] I'm not getting a lot of amens and I'm
[20:04] not seeing any shouting or Screaming
[20:05] going
[20:07] on and so I'm wondering you know am I
[20:09] Lord did I did I miss your mind you know
[20:11] that but then after we close somebody
[20:14] come up for prayer and we come up for
[20:16] prayer the Holy Ghost fell and people
[20:19] started weeping and I was weeping and
[20:21] praying and crying and everything and
[20:23] we're praying for deliverance right
[20:24] there
[20:25] Hallelujah so see but you know the whole
[20:27] time I'm preaching I got the holy ghost
[20:29] in my soul I know this word is right
[20:32] people are saying amen so you know
[20:33] they're thinking about the word of God
[20:35] right so I had the anointing here here
[20:37] but I didn't feel it to the very end I
[20:39] sure like to feel it praise God I don't
[20:41] have to feel it brother John but I sure
[20:42] like to feel it hallelujah amen
[20:46] glory amen
[20:50] now also so us the first application is
[20:53] that represents your body soul and mind
[20:56] but it also represents justification how
[20:58] many know that there's only three works
[21:01] of Grace there's not four there's only
[21:02] three justification sanctification and
[21:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[21:07] what those three offices I'm sorry those
[21:09] three locations
[21:11] represent Hallelujah does that make
[21:13] sense
[21:14] everybody right we all know people that
[21:17] they just got saved right but they're
[21:19] not really into the holy place and we
[21:21] know they're not living in God's
[21:23] presence right they just got saved they
[21:27] just got the blood Jesus's cross the
[21:30] water the water
[21:31] baptism Hallelujah and then you get up
[21:34] in here you got candlesticks uh that's
[21:36] light that represents the knowledge of
[21:38] the church ages right the bread
[21:41] represents the word of God uh the
[21:43] Mysteries that's what I wrote my book on
[21:44] that's my 12 New Testament Mysteries
[21:46] there's 12 pieces of bread there and
[21:48] brother R said we're feeding on that
[21:49] shoe bread of the word of God and then
[21:52] the inset represents prayer you got to
[21:54] have prayer before you go in the
[21:55] presence of God and the presence of God
[21:58] got the law the Bible said God's going
[22:00] to write the law upon the fleshly tables
[22:02] of your
[22:03] soul Hallelujah the Mana is in there the
[22:07] fresh word in other words there's
[22:08] there's an eternal word there's an
[22:10] eternal I'm sorry that's the seed man is
[22:12] the seed it's called the coriander seed
[22:14] it's the seed of God you're born again
[22:15] of The Incorruptible seed of God the
[22:18] word of God hallelujah oh my and then
[22:21] the rod it was Aaron's Rod that buted
[22:23] that was death to life that was
[22:25] Resurrection so it's your soul that's
[22:28] been resurrected resed your body's
[22:29] getting old I'm getting gray hair I got
[22:31] Grays on over here my my body hasn't
[22:33] been resurrected but my soul's
[22:35] resurrected my soul was dead but now
[22:38] it's alive Hallelujah we were dead in
[22:40] sins and trespasses but now we've been
[22:42] quickened by the holy spirit amen we've
[22:44] got Aaron's rod in our souls
[22:47] hallelujah oh my this is good Hallelujah
[22:49] I love this this is always one of my
[22:51] favorite messages to preach I preach
[22:53] this everywhere I've gone by God's grace
[22:55] but see remember you have three parts
[22:56] you have a body and I'm going fast on
[22:59] this cuz it's more review it's just more
[23:00] a visual so you can see it hopefully
[23:02] this will help somebody
[23:03] tonight I don't know what's uh going on
[23:06] with my circles there I don't remember
[23:08] the order I got here okay oops
[23:13] well let me just zoom in there okay so
[23:16] can everybody see that you got the three
[23:18] parts you got the body which is the
[23:21] outer Court you got the human spirit the
[23:23] mind I just made it a little bigger cuz
[23:25] I want the circles to get smaller as you
[23:26] go and then the Sol of of man the soul
[23:29] body Spirit Soul everybody say amen amen
[23:33] all right now this is just another view
[23:34] of it this is what I was talking about
[23:35] earlier now what's what's different here
[23:37] is the you got to have Waters of
[23:40] Separation before you can even get in
[23:41] here that's what numbers 19 is all about
[23:44] you can't even be a worshipper Glory
[23:46] until you've got the Waters of
[23:48] Separation sprinkled on you Hallelujah
[23:50] you can't even come to church you can't
[23:52] even get close to God's presence until
[23:54] you've been sprinkled with the Waters of
[23:56] Separation this was a great revelation
[23:58] to me brother I tell you this is this
[24:00] made me shout made me cry dance this is
[24:02] beautiful so in other words first you
[24:04] got to have like a First Act of
[24:06] repentance right and then you get
[24:08] baptized in water but you first got to
[24:11] come into the
[24:12] court why do you why did y'all want to
[24:14] get baptized because you first repented
[24:16] of your sins you didn't want to be under
[24:18] the fear of man amen say God forgive me
[24:21] I want to be free I want to be a real
[24:23] believer hallelujah praise God so see
[24:25] that's what this means you have to have
[24:27] the waters separation first outside the
[24:30] the court and then you come in you
[24:32] represent you see Jesus's blood
[24:34] sacrifice the substitutionary death
[24:36] that's justification water baptism then
[24:39] you come into sanctification this is uh
[24:41] sanctification by knowledge the word and
[24:43] prayer knowledge is the light because
[24:46] the Bible says light is knowledge in the
[24:48] New Testament second Corinthians and
[24:50] then the word is the bread and the
[24:51] prayer and that brings you into the
[24:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's
[24:55] what brother R was preaching in this
[24:56] sermon the basis of Fellowship brother
[25:00] says you don't talk to God necessarily
[25:02] out here the Bible says you he he would
[25:04] talk to Aaron Above The Mercy Seat amen
[25:08] hallelujah hallelujah that's where
[25:11] Fellowship brother that's the point of
[25:12] brother's sermon is that you have
[25:14] Fellowship in the holies of holies in
[25:16] other words your most intimate
[25:17] Fellowship is when you're born again
[25:20] Hallelujah then you can really have
[25:22] fellowship with the word of God you can
[25:24] really worship God you can really talk
[25:26] to God when you're born again Hallelujah
[25:29] see then nobody can talk you out of
[25:31] there because you've talked to God about
[25:32] it you've talked to the word you've
[25:34] looked at the word you know what the
[25:36] word says
[25:37] hallelujah oh my
[25:40] Hallelujah now those are more of the
[25:41] types I've already mentioned I can I can
[25:43] send this to you if you want so if you
[25:45] want to write it down if you want to go
[25:46] listen to the sermon it's the basis of
[25:48] Fellowship
[25:50] 1961 and brother Brandon preaches this
[25:52] I'm going to skip some things here
[25:55] uh brother Brandon preached this and
[25:58] there was a Jewish rabbi sitting there
[26:00] this is and this is what he tells in Bas
[26:02] of Fellowship here not long ago I was
[26:04] speaking on this at a fellowship meeting
[26:06] and one of the great rabbis United
[26:08] States met me back behind back there and
[26:09] said I've never heard that like that in
[26:11] my life he's talking about the three
[26:14] courts of the Tabernacle and how it's
[26:16] justification sanctification baptism of
[26:19] the Holy Ghost he said I've been a rabbi
[26:21] and come from a generation of rabbis
[26:23] Rabbi after Rabbi after Rabbi and now
[26:25] he's a Pentecostal Rabbi with the
[26:28] baptism of the Holy
[26:30] Ghost oh my so just showing him just
[26:33] showing him the reality of
[26:36] this showing him the reality of this
[26:39] what it means for us it made this Jew
[26:42] convert to
[26:43] Christianity CU he saw Jesus Jesus's
[26:46] death is here and then he saw the water
[26:49] baptism of Jesus he saw the word the
[26:51] church ages the prayer and then he saw
[26:53] the presence of God and he got the Holy
[26:55] Ghost all because of this sermon
[26:57] Hallelujah this sermon will take you
[26:59] into the presence of God hallelujah
[27:02] because you got to be sprinkled first
[27:04] and confess those sins before you come
[27:06] into the presence of God and then church
[27:09] it tells us to do it every day we learn
[27:11] from this confess your sins every day so
[27:13] you can enjoy the presence of God in
[27:14] your home in your vehicle even after a
[27:17] funeral service
[27:19] amen or at a funeral service amen the
[27:23] presence of God can come around you all
[27:25] the time because you're walking the
[27:27] under the spring you're walking under
[27:29] the purification of the holy spirit in
[27:31] your life amen like our sister said last
[27:34] time I love that testimony sister Ruth
[27:36] how you can minister to the uh the young
[27:38] people there while you're giving them
[27:40] meals and write them you that's the Holy
[27:42] Spirit the Holy Spirit can come into a
[27:44] certain place where you might not expect
[27:46] it and it can heal somebody and they'll
[27:48] Testify the next day amen hallelujah
[27:51] what is that it's a sister that's
[27:52] walking in the purification of the she's
[27:55] purified so she's having fellowship with
[27:57] the Lord and the Lord tells her you go
[27:59] pray for this person or send this person
[28:00] a card amen give them a card and the
[28:04] Holy Spirit Will begin dealing with them
[28:05] how does how do we know how to do these
[28:06] things because we're led by the Holy
[28:08] Spirit we're having fellowship with the
[28:10] holy
[28:11] spirit amen all right y'all y'all
[28:14] enjoying this now I want to say this
[28:17] brother the brother hit it brother
[28:18] Daniel you hit it right on the head you
[28:20] said we got to confess our sins right
[28:22] this is part of my
[28:23] notes so when we're battling Devils will
[28:26] not move until they're exposed
[28:28] am so see when we have you know what
[28:31] mind battles or or lust of the eyes lust
[28:33] of Flesh pride of life if there's any
[28:36] sin in there that that that that
[28:38] condemnation won't leave until we
[28:40] confess it to somebody or at least to
[28:42] God right if you didn't sin against
[28:43] somebody then all you got to do is
[28:44] confess it to God and then you have to
[28:46] hate your
[28:47] sin right you have to hate it brother
[28:49] man said uh the some people that would
[28:52] say demon possessed it's because they
[28:53] worship that Spirit they love to feel
[28:56] lust or they love to feel depressed they
[28:58] want the pity of of people right they
[29:01] love that Spirit but you the Bible said
[29:03] you've got to hate even the spotting of
[29:05] the Garment of the Flesh in Jude the
[29:07] Bible says You must hate your sin so you
[29:09] must hate your sin what's bothering you
[29:11] you must confess it and then when that
[29:13] happens it's as if you're being
[29:14] sprinkled by the anointing of the Holy
[29:17] Ghost and now you're clean Hallelujah
[29:20] and now that Spirit has to go hallelujah
[29:23] it's like what Jesus said in Matthew 12
[29:26] no man can spoil a house except he binds
[29:28] up the strong man right who's going to
[29:29] get in your house the only way they're
[29:30] going to get is if they bind you up
[29:32] because you're the strong man and that's
[29:34] what Jesus is saying with your mind the
[29:36] only way the devil can get in your mind
[29:37] is if you let the word of God get bound
[29:39] up and you don't let the word of God
[29:42] rule over your mind is that the church
[29:45] said but if you expose if you call on
[29:48] Jesus and say Jesus I'm I don't want to
[29:50] be bound up anymore amen I don't want to
[29:53] be living in sin I don't I don't want
[29:54] this feeling anymore I forgive me I I
[29:57] let the wrong person in forgive me come
[30:00] rescue me come save me you know Jesus is
[30:02] the savior Hallelujah not just of the
[30:05] body but he's savior of the Soul he's
[30:07] savior of the human mind Jehovah is our
[30:09] Salvation that's the meaning of Jesus
[30:11] Hallelujah and Jesus will come and set
[30:13] us free in the sometimes the prison of
[30:15] our mind sometimes because we all
[30:17] struggle right we all struggle remember
[30:19] the time brother raham lied to the IRS
[30:21] he said there was so much going on he
[30:23] had so many meetings with lawyers he
[30:24] said his head was
[30:25] swimming right ever feel like that you
[30:28] get so busy your head swims and here's a
[30:30] man who he's got the Holy Ghost in his
[30:32] soul right but then he gets a call and
[30:35] he says tell them I'm not here and he
[30:37] has his wife lie to the IRS and then he
[30:39] tries to pray for a baby and the Holy
[30:41] Spirit said don't put your lying hands
[30:43] on that baby before you repent of that
[30:46] he's like okay wait right here I got to
[30:47] go apologize he called the IRS back and
[30:49] said forgive me I was under stress I
[30:52] lied to you and I called I caused my
[30:54] wife to lie and these IRS guys said wow
[30:56] I think more of you now than I did
[30:59] before see when we can humble ourselves
[31:01] and admit our wrongs people will think
[31:03] more of us because you know why they're
[31:05] hiding their sins and they know you're
[31:08] you're
[31:09] not they've got demons that are not
[31:12] exposed but you've exposed the demons so
[31:14] they'll think more of you and the church
[31:17] said don't feel bad to go confess to
[31:19] somebody that that will prove to them
[31:21] God's working in your life think of how
[31:23] many demons they're hiding in their Liv
[31:26] especially these churches that have evil
[31:28] spirits and attack us and say all kind
[31:30] kinds of things against us oh the Holy
[31:31] Ghost is preaching tonight amen
[31:34] hallelujah but you go and you you can
[31:37] you make make that right by God's grace
[31:38] confess your wrongs and God will honor
[31:41] you he that humbles himself what will
[31:44] happen God will exalt you that's what
[31:46] happened to brother
[31:48] brandom and how many believe brother
[31:50] brand had the Holy Ghost for sure but
[31:52] where where where was the trouble right
[31:53] here in his mind not the soul the soul
[31:55] was good the soul was sealed to the day
[31:57] of redemption
[31:59] but all the stress up here caused even
[32:01] his body to say I got to get away from
[32:02] this problem caus him to lie but he made
[32:06] it right by the grace of God
[32:08] hallelujah and just I just want to share
[32:11] this too maybe some of people are
[32:12] battling spirits tonight but even if
[32:14] you're not remember this for somebody
[32:16] else uh we you know we uh Faith Works by
[32:19] love right the Bible said Faith Works by
[32:22] love so when we're living by faith we're
[32:24] actually living in love we we're we're
[32:26] loving Jesus we're worshiping Jesus the
[32:28] we should be but here are some of the
[32:30] quotes from brother Brandon brother BR
[32:31] said unbelief is the chief of all Devils
[32:33] right people that won't believe they
[32:36] won't believe that's the chief of all
[32:38] demons that's what brother R
[32:41] says now brother I like this one the
[32:43] religious devil is the worst demon to
[32:46] deal with
[32:47] Pharisees Sadducees
[32:50] herodians right that's the worst demon
[32:54] right Jesus had to turn like Jesus would
[32:56] meet with the publicans I'm sorry Jesus
[32:58] would meet with the uh the tax
[33:01] collectors and and the prostitutes he
[33:04] would save them but he couldn't get
[33:05] those Pharisees that move an
[33:07] inch is that right so what that's a
[33:10] spirit of Pride right that's a prideful
[33:11] Spirit a religious spirit is a prideful
[33:14] Spirit pride is exalting yourself above
[33:16] the word of
[33:18] God now brother man said this now listen
[33:20] nervous anybody ever get stressed out
[33:21] you don't raise your hand unless you
[33:23] want I
[33:25] do brother said nervous that this this
[33:27] demon the stress demon is the worst
[33:30] feeling anyone could
[33:31] have I got threatened uh a few months
[33:34] ago and it my stomach was just ch
[33:36] churning for weeks I got a threat and
[33:39] Simon had warned me he didn't know what
[33:40] he was doing but Simon was trying to
[33:43] warn me the Holy Ghost was trying to
[33:44] warn me that a threat was coming and my
[33:46] stomach churned for weeks and I can say
[33:48] Amen to that the evil spirit of
[33:51] nervousness and stress is one of the
[33:53] worst feelings anyone could live with
[33:56] like that's why Satan wants to make us
[33:57] un certain about the next job or what's
[34:00] going to happen at the presidential
[34:01] election like he loves to take these
[34:03] what ifs but the Bible said cast down
[34:06] any imagination that exalts itself
[34:08] against the word of God
[34:11] hallelujah so see we can't live under
[34:13] stress we got to cast those things down
[34:15] any nervous feelings we got to cast it
[34:17] down and say Jesus will take care of me
[34:19] Jesus will help me and then you'll feel
[34:21] good again by the grace of
[34:24] God and brother said the spirit of fear
[34:26] remember second Timothy says uh 2
[34:28] Timothy 1:7 says God has not given you
[34:30] the spirit of
[34:32] fear brother said fear accompanies doubt
[34:36] so when you start doubting things fear
[34:37] Creeps in it's like two demons right
[34:40] doubt and fear kind of work start
[34:41] working brother man said fear is the
[34:43] greatest thing against the church
[34:45] today isn't that something right fear I
[34:48] I'm talking about us the people that
[34:50] love God that believe they got the Holy
[34:51] Ghost the the biggest challenge for us
[34:53] is fear right we're afraid what's going
[34:56] to happen we're afraid about this afraid
[34:58] should I do this I'm afraid right but
[35:01] see we can overcome all these things as
[35:04] the Bible said God's not giv us a spirit
[35:05] of fear what has God given us he's given
[35:08] us what power love and a ah you're good
[35:12] Bible Church here hallelujah you know
[35:15] the Bible so you you you don't have to
[35:17] accept fear you don't have to accept
[35:19] nervousness you can say I cast that down
[35:20] because God is not giving that to me
[35:23] amen you can say God sprinkle me from
[35:25] this fear sprinkle me from this nervous
[35:28] sprinkle me from this religious spirit
[35:30] or whatever it may be sprinkle me from
[35:32] this uh pride and lust or whatever may
[35:33] be sprinkle me from that I want to be
[35:36] clean all right good just thought I'm
[35:39] laying this in there now that's that's
[35:40] my closing right there so I got to jump
[35:41] ahead
[35:43] now now uh let's go to numbers 1910 I
[35:46] sure did I'm at 35 minutes okay so maybe
[35:49] give me about 30 more minutes by God's
[35:52] grace maybe I I could preach two parts
[35:54] on this we'll see I got so many things I
[35:56] want to preach to you but just I'm
[35:58] trying to follow the leading of the Holy
[35:59] Spirit I like to preach on the future
[36:01] home and uh teach to you the word of God
[36:03] hallelujah these are important years you
[36:04] know you look back on these years and
[36:06] you'll say wow I wish I could go back to
[36:08] those years because that's what I feel I
[36:11] wish I could go back to when I first
[36:12] came in the message and I got to hear
[36:14] them for the first time it was such a
[36:15] wonderful feeling
[36:17] Hallelujah numbers 1910 now we read uh
[36:21] 199 now verse 10 says and he that
[36:23] gathereth the ashes of the heer shall
[36:25] wash his clothes and be unclean until
[36:28] the even and it shall be unto the
[36:31] children of Israel and see this and unto
[36:35] the
[36:36] stranger that sojourneth among them for
[36:38] a statute forever so this cleansing is
[36:41] for all Jews and any stranger anyone who
[36:44] comes to live in this camp that cross
[36:47] Camp I showed you amen anyone that comes
[36:50] to live they have to be clean By the
[36:52] Waters of Separation they got to be
[36:55] sprinkled or else the will be defiled by
[36:58] sin and of course infectious disease as
[37:02] well so there's multiple there's a
[37:04] couple reasons for this so notice this
[37:06] was for in other words new Believers but
[37:09] it's for experienced Believers as well
[37:11] and of course I'm using this for
[37:14] us we need the sprinkling of the Holy
[37:16] Ghost new Believers but also experienced
[37:19] Believers I've been preaching 20 years I
[37:22] still need the sprinkl of the Holy Ghost
[37:23] to purify me because I get dirty just
[37:26] like anybody else
[37:29] Hallelujah all right so that that's why
[37:31] this is important now while you're there
[37:33] let's um yeah that was the
[37:36] verse yeah and notice here's what
[37:38] brother says now this is also if you
[37:40] also want to listen to the water
[37:41] separation 55 it's the same topic he
[37:44] said oh what a beautiful picture that
[37:46] separation the Waters of Separation
[37:48] separated the guilty and made them holy
[37:51] and brought them back into Fellowship
[37:55] again so that's why this message is so
[37:57] important if you ever feel like God I'm
[37:59] not really talking to you I feel like
[38:01] I'm so far from you you need this
[38:02] message because this message will bring
[38:04] you back into fellowship with
[38:06] God
[38:08] hallelujah he says the blood of Jesus
[38:10] Christ cleanses us from all
[38:12] unrighteousness and makes us holy and
[38:13] puts us back into Fellowship again with
[38:15] the father see beautiful isn't it
[38:19] Hallelujah now if you got your
[38:22] Bible verses 2 and three speaks of a red
[38:25] heer
[38:28] now brother R said in this red heer
[38:30] brother Ram said this red heer was
[38:32] pointing to
[38:35] Christ so this red heer in the Bible is
[38:38] isn't a heer a girl is that right okay
[38:40] sometimes I get those mixed up I'm not a
[38:42] farmer brother so you forgive me I was
[38:45] not raised on a farm I was raised in the
[38:48] city but brother R says the red heer a
[38:51] female cow represents
[38:55] Christ why because God has both man male
[38:57] and female attributes right he has
[39:00] dominant attributes and he has recessive
[39:02] attributes right because everything came
[39:04] out of
[39:05] him now I don't know if you saw this but
[39:08] remember last year there was a uh a
[39:10] Christian in Texas and he sent five red
[39:13] heers over to Israel you remember that
[39:15] one of them one of them is disqualified
[39:17] now it's not clean enough they're down
[39:18] to four so they're down to
[39:20] four and so Israel has to have one of
[39:22] these in order to set up its new Temple
[39:25] that's why some people think the Rapture
[39:26] is going to be pretty soon
[39:28] because now they haven't had these red
[39:29] heers for over a thousand years I mean
[39:32] they haven't because they 2,000 years
[39:34] because they've been out of the land and
[39:36] now so conveniently the people are back
[39:38] and now they got a red heers but there's
[39:40] a short time to use them though because
[39:42] they get too old and there are certain
[39:44] laws so it may be a sign maybe
[39:47] not but
[39:49] notice notice this this red he heph had
[39:53] have no blemish and that's what the
[39:55] Bible said Jesus was without and no
[39:58] blemish there never came a yoke upon
[40:02] this red heer and brother man said Jesus
[40:04] wasn't Yol to any
[40:06] denomination he wasn't a Pharisee he
[40:09] wasn't a sadducee he didn't come out of
[40:11] them he came out of God
[40:14] Amen he didn't come out of the Sanhedrin
[40:16] he came out of the mind of God
[40:18] hallelujah because he was God
[40:21] Amen and he had to be sacrif I'm sorry
[40:24] the red heer had to be killed outside of
[40:26] the camp and that's what the Bible says
[40:28] they took Jesus out of Jerusalem and
[40:31] crucified him without the
[40:33] camp Oh hallelujah amen well man said
[40:37] Christ was not yolk with any
[40:40] organization now here's a picture of
[40:41] Solomon this is some artist rendition so
[40:45] there there's Jerusalem right and
[40:46] there's the temple there's the holiest
[40:47] of holies during the days of Salon this
[40:49] is what they imagined you know Salon had
[40:51] so much money he built this like this
[40:53] beautiful you know white path maybe
[40:54] porcelain path and this is where they'
[40:56] kill the red effort it had to be outside
[40:59] the
[41:00] camp right and remember Jesus was
[41:02] crucified outside of the
[41:04] courts
[41:07] right and there's a hiss up there's a
[41:09] hiss up and everything like that now
[41:11] we'll get to this
[41:12] here now and then the Bible said they
[41:15] had to sprinkle it seven times let me
[41:16] read that
[41:20] here yes in verse four numbers 194 and
[41:23] alas of the priest shall take of her
[41:25] blood with his finger and sprinkle of
[41:27] her blood directly before the Tabernacle
[41:29] of the congregation seven
[41:32] times so elzar took the blood and he had
[41:35] to take the blood he sprinkled it once 2
[41:37] 3 4 5 6 7 brother Ram said what does
[41:39] that
[41:41] represent he says that seven Stripes
[41:44] meant the seven Church ages he said at
[41:47] every age had to be represented by Blood
[41:50] nothing else no other way Hallelujah so
[41:54] look at that the same blood that was
[41:57] sprinkled for Ephesus was sprinkled for
[42:00] samna right Sardis thyra Philadelphia
[42:05] and leoda amen in other words the same
[42:08] blood that we're under the blood of
[42:09] Jesus is the blood that was St Paul was
[42:12] under Hallelujah Paul irius Martin
[42:16] Columba Luther Wesley brother random
[42:18] every Church age Messer was under the
[42:20] same blood it's the blood of Jesus
[42:21] Christ in other words the blood of Jesus
[42:24] Christ is sufficient sisters for today
[42:26] it's just as sufficient today as it was
[42:29] 2,000 years ago amen hallelujah if the
[42:32] blood saved them at the beginning of the
[42:33] church age the same blood will save us
[42:35] at the end of the church age that's what
[42:37] brother man teaches as a
[42:39] type oh I love it amen and it was a once
[42:42] and for all sacrific this red heer they
[42:45] only needed one sacrifice and Jesus only
[42:47] had to die one time
[42:49] Hallelujah so there is blood even for
[42:51] Leo deia because there are seven
[42:53] sprinklings every Church age is under
[42:56] the same blood Hallelujah of course that
[42:58] represents the seven spirits of God life
[43:00] spirit is life and the life is the blood
[43:04] and then in verses we're not going to
[43:05] read these because I want to get to the
[43:06] end in numbers 19 5-10 it had to be
[43:10] burnt you had to burn the red heer then
[43:12] you had to mix the ashes with water and
[43:15] then the people could be
[43:18] cleansed and Israel had to keep this
[43:20] water with the ashes and mixed up this
[43:22] watery ashes they had to keep this for
[43:25] long periods of time
[43:27] uh one historian said it one heer all
[43:30] those ashes would last for a 100
[43:32] years so that this would last your
[43:35] lifetime in other words the uh the Water
[43:38] the Waters of cleansing the blood would
[43:40] never lose its power during your
[43:43] lifetime Hallelujah that's showing that
[43:45] the blood of Jesus Christ will never
[43:46] lose its power Hallelujah as long as
[43:49] you're alive there's purification for
[43:51] you amen as long as you're alive there's
[43:53] blood for you Hallelujah as long as
[43:55] you're trying to serve God God will a
[43:57] way he can cleanse you Hallelujah and
[43:59] make you whole and allow you to come
[44:01] back into fellowship with
[44:04] him oh thank the Lord
[44:08] amen oh yeah brother says when they
[44:10] killed it they had to have
[44:12] Scarlet there was they burned Scarlet
[44:15] hup and was put
[44:18] together he says and those three Scarlet
[44:20] his up in the water represented
[44:23] justification sanctification and the
[44:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost so brother
[44:27] pulls out all these types seven Church
[44:28] ages three things had to be mixed the
[44:30] three works of Grace he's pulling out
[44:33] all these types to show everything
[44:35] pointed to Jesus
[44:37] Christ amen no yoke right no no
[44:40] denomination outside the camp Jesus
[44:42] crucified outside of Jerusalem
[44:44] hallelujah oh it's beautiful so wood his
[44:47] up and Scarlet represents justification
[44:50] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[44:52] Ghost oh my now here's where we want to
[44:55] get to because this is going to be
[44:56] important for you and I
[44:58] if Israel touched any dead body they had
[45:01] to be required to be
[45:03] cleansed other words you couldn't have
[45:05] death on you and try to come worship
[45:08] God now you got to see the spiritual we
[45:11] got to see the spiritual type here am in
[45:13] fact you were cut off from the the whole
[45:16] camp that whole cross Camp amen you were
[45:18] cut off if you didn't get cleansed from
[45:20] your
[45:22] deadness all right that's numbers uh
[45:25] 1913 and 20
[45:28] let's I'm going to read 13 whosoever
[45:29] toucheth the dead body of any man that
[45:31] is dead and purifieth not himself
[45:33] defileth the tabernac of the Lord and
[45:36] that Soul shall be cut off from Israel
[45:38] because the water of Separation was not
[45:40] sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean
[45:43] his uncleanness is yet upon him all
[45:46] right now verse 20 but the man that
[45:48] shall be unclean and shall not purify
[45:50] himself that Soul shall be cut off from
[45:52] among the congregation because he have
[45:54] defiled the sanctuary of the Lord the
[45:56] water separation ha not been sprinkled
[45:58] upon him he is unclean can everybody see
[46:01] that everybody see that in other words
[46:04] God saying you can't worship you can't
[46:06] be a part of this church you can't have
[46:08] the experience of a worshipper you can't
[46:10] have fellowship with me unless you're
[46:12] clean when you get when you touch dead
[46:15] things you can't have fellowship with me
[46:17] if you're touching touching dead stuff
[46:20] if you're touching
[46:22] sins if you're playing around with sin
[46:24] you can't have fellowship with me and
[46:25] the church said amen that's what God is
[46:28] saying here
[46:32] hallelujah it's such a beautiful
[46:35] type look look look what God did God did
[46:37] all this to make us clean oh the red
[46:39] heer the seven sprinkles and the three
[46:42] things outside the camp God did all this
[46:46] so we could be clean and we could have
[46:48] fellowship with him
[46:51] Hallelujah and this is uh this is a
[46:55] beautiful type here now
[46:57] yeah now see this here let's look at
[46:59] verse 11 and he that toucheth the dead
[47:00] body of any man shall be unclean seven
[47:03] days he shall purify himself with it on
[47:05] the third day and on the seventh day he
[47:07] shall be clean but if he purify not
[47:09] himself the third day then the seventh
[47:10] day shall he be not clean now look you
[47:13] had to go through all seven days you
[47:15] I'll say like this there's no shortcuts
[47:16] with
[47:17] God some people say well I just got
[47:19] saved yesterday brother said I got saved
[47:21] yesterday and I want to preach tomorrow
[47:23] brother man said no you can't do that
[47:24] the Bible said lay hands on no man
[47:25] suddenly
[47:27] amen hallelujah what talk about the rock
[47:30] and roll guys they would sing rock and
[47:31] roll on a Saturday night and repent and
[47:33] then try to sing on Sunday morning at
[47:34] church brother said you can't do that
[47:36] lay hands on no man subtly see because
[47:39] because cleaning out is a
[47:41] process so see if you miss if you miss
[47:44] the sprinkling on you had to get
[47:45] sprinkled on day one if you miss the
[47:47] sprinkling on day three you got to start
[47:48] all over
[47:50] again so you have to thoroughly purge
[47:52] yourself in other words you got to be
[47:54] sincere about being
[47:55] clean I like this too you got to come
[47:58] and be fed the word of God you got to
[47:59] come and enjoy the presence of God each
[48:01] time the doors are open I like that amen
[48:04] you got to come to church every time the
[48:05] church doors are open and the church
[48:07] said amen hallelujah brother Ram said if
[48:10] you love God he said they can't chain
[48:12] you out of coming to
[48:14] church he said they can't fence you out
[48:17] let me see if I have that quote right in
[48:18] front of
[48:19] me did I have it
[48:22] saved yeah is that too small
[48:27] he says now if you love God you couldn't
[48:32] they couldn't wire you away from church
[48:34] they couldn't chain you away from it
[48:36] they can't hide a Believer from
[48:39] God hallelujah and see church people let
[48:41] all these things make a miss church
[48:43] shame on them they're missing coming
[48:46] into fellowship with
[48:48] god brother man said if you love God you
[48:51] want to be with God's
[48:53] people hallelujah and brother that's
[48:55] what I've seen over the years brothers
[48:57] that's what I've seen people that their
[48:58] first thing they do is they start
[48:59] missing church and then pretty soon they
[49:02] fall away if they don't repent of that
[49:04] because they they've been touching dead
[49:07] things and then God God will cut them
[49:10] off from the church and that's my prayer
[49:12] brother Daniel that's my prayer brother
[49:14] Howard my prayer is God only let people
[49:16] come here that are
[49:18] clean in other words we don't want
[49:20] leaven in our church we don't want
[49:22] people sleeping around and doing drugs
[49:24] God if they're not going to repent keep
[49:25] them out of the church we we just want
[49:27] people that are clean here hallelujah
[49:29] now this is the place to be clean like
[49:31] somebody that's maybe unconfessed yeah
[49:33] come and sit but repent at the end of
[49:34] the service praise God you understand
[49:36] what I'm saying I've also I preach this
[49:39] also and some people have said well well
[49:41] I didn't want to come tonight because I
[49:42] i' had fallen short no if you fell short
[49:46] come here and confess it don't stay away
[49:49] from God's
[49:50] house it ain't G to help you staying at
[49:52] home you're missing out on Fellowship
[49:54] praise God you're missing on the the
[49:56] purification of the word of God
[49:59] hallelujah I've seen too much in church
[50:01] services to want to miss church
[50:02] Hallelujah I've seen the supernatural
[50:04] people healed in tongues interpretation
[50:06] and miracles people getting uh victory
[50:08] over generational curses and and so much
[50:11] joy and victory I've seen so much in
[50:13] church I never want to miss church
[50:14] because I never know when God's going to
[50:16] move amen and I don't want to miss it
[50:18] when he does
[50:20] Amen a few years ago brother I could
[50:22] count it on one hand how many times I
[50:23] missed Church in my entire life as a
[50:25] pastor I think I'm I'm up to three or
[50:27] four in 18 years of pastoring I think
[50:29] I've only missed four or five Services
[50:31] where I was
[50:32] sick and I hope it stays that way I hope
[50:34] I don't get to two hands by God's grace
[50:36] I hope I can always count them on one
[50:38] hand by God's grace so I'm trusting God
[50:39] to purify me
[50:42] amen so this is a this is for us in the
[50:45] New
[50:46] Testament now today in the New Testament
[50:49] people are cut off from the spiritual
[50:51] effects of the Holy Ghost they're dull
[50:53] of hearing due to the hard hearts and
[50:56] the griev of the Holy Spirit they cannot
[50:58] experience the joy of worship because
[51:00] they're cut off due to their sin yet
[51:02] they can sit in
[51:04] church now I'm going to check my slides
[51:07] I got a lot of slides this turned into a
[51:09] very long
[51:12] sermon I'm just going to go back up here
[51:14] and then I'm going to try to bring this
[51:15] down to close I'm already at 51 minutes
[51:17] and I I told you I don't want to wear
[51:18] you
[51:19] out and I don't I I really
[51:22] don't so here's the whole point of this
[51:24] just to summarize it I'm giving you the
[51:26] short version and I can preach more if
[51:28] you want later by God's
[51:31] grace here's how I brought it to other
[51:33] churches as well as a pastor as if you
[51:36] if you've attended church any any any
[51:37] amount of time you see people that come
[51:39] to church but they don't get anything
[51:41] out of
[51:42] it and in my mind brother for Years
[51:45] brother irin I'd wonder how can these
[51:47] people come here they don't pray they
[51:49] don't shout they don't scream they don't
[51:51] cry they don't speak in tongues they
[51:52] don't pray for the sick they just sit
[51:54] there with their arms folded and look
[51:55] like they're mad all the time like how
[51:56] can people do
[51:58] that what kind I mean and then they
[52:01] don't want to talk to people after the
[52:02] service or if they do talk they don't
[52:03] want to talk about
[52:04] God I'm like how how can they come here
[52:08] and not be impacted and I wonder that
[52:10] for years and then the Revelation came
[52:12] of this they are here those people are
[52:15] here physically but God spiritually
[52:18] won't let them into fellowship with him
[52:20] because they're
[52:22] defiled everybody cat you how can we
[52:25] come to church and we love God and we'll
[52:27] cry and we'll weep and we'll rejoice and
[52:29] we'll praise God we we know God's
[52:31] talking to us but other people can sit
[52:32] right there and be
[52:35] like they've chewed their nails so long
[52:37] I don't even know how they have any
[52:38] nails left and sometimes I want to say
[52:41] can I try by to that that looks pretty
[52:43] good I'm just joking brother brother
[52:45] Brooks gave me that joke one time I was
[52:46] chewing my nails he said that looks good
[52:48] could I have a about of
[52:50] that I'm like man that guy's been eating
[52:52] his uh nails so long I don't even know
[52:54] how he has any nails left
[52:56] instead of shouting amen he's like
[52:58] focusing on that's that's really good
[53:01] you're eating the wrong thing brother
[53:02] amen you should be eating on the word of
[53:05] God hallelujah you should be digesting
[53:07] brother said digest the word of God chew
[53:09] on that word
[53:11] again hallelujah amen but I wonder for
[53:15] years as a pastor actually yeah I
[53:17] started pastoring in 2006 so this
[53:19] Revelation came in 2017 or 2016 so for
[53:22] 10 years brother I wondered why in the
[53:24] world how can people come to church and
[53:26] they they're never happy you never see
[53:27] them
[53:28] smile you never see them praying on
[53:31] their knees you you never see them come
[53:32] up for
[53:33] prayer and then the revelation of this
[53:35] struck me it's because they've been
[53:37] handling dead things in their life and
[53:39] when they come to church God will not
[53:41] accept their Fellowship because they're
[53:43] disobeying the word of
[53:45] God and the church
[53:48] said
[53:50] Hallelujah but this is what I found
[53:52] Saints I found this if I confess all my
[53:55] sins before I come to church
[53:57] then the Holy Ghost will let me into the
[53:59] outer court and I'll come in there
[54:01] sister Sarah and I'll see Jesus Christ
[54:04] sacrificed for my sins and it will mean
[54:07] something to
[54:09] me it's different for other people you
[54:11] preach about Jesus they just sit there
[54:14] like it don't mean nothing to them how
[54:16] can it mean nothing to them because
[54:18] they've got theyve touched dead things
[54:20] and they're not even spiritually here do
[54:23] you understand what I'm saying
[54:26] I've seen some animals die you know from
[54:28] getting ran over on the road I had to
[54:30] bury some my cats and things like that
[54:31] it's a sad thing I wept and cried but
[54:34] can you imagine if your lamb or your
[54:37] uh uh whatever uh the pigeon what's the
[54:40] other one the heer you sacrifice one of
[54:42] your calves and this is one of your dear
[54:45] calfs in the old I'm talking about the
[54:46] Old Testament you would you know your
[54:47] children would cry seeing that lamb die
[54:50] that means so much to you but that that
[54:52] paid for your sins and you'd cry and say
[54:54] oh God thank you for forgiving me but
[54:56] it's
[54:57] heartbreaking and then we come to church
[54:59] and someone preach on Jesus and you
[55:00] don't cry about it it don't mean nothing
[55:02] to you what's happened the spirit of God
[55:05] has been
[55:06] grieved Hallelujah I'm talking about
[55:08] your first love you you and I need to
[55:10] have our first love the cross of Jesus
[55:12] means to it has to mean something to us
[55:15] it has to move
[55:17] us Jesus died to forgive my sins that
[55:21] ought to make me happy that ought to
[55:23] make me thankful that ought to make me
[55:25] want to go out and serve others and give
[55:27] my life as a s as a sacrifice or
[55:29] offering for somebody else and the
[55:31] church
[55:32] said
[55:34] hallelujah how can the cross not mean
[55:37] something to people brother how can you
[55:38] preach on the blood and don't move
[55:39] people it's because they've let sin in
[55:41] their lives
[55:43] somewhere and I'm not saying you cry
[55:44] every service I'm just saying you know
[55:47] when they's sin in your life you know I
[55:52] know so people will come to church and
[55:54] they they get no fellowship with God
[55:56] because they have unconfessed
[55:59] sins and then the water the this is the
[56:02] labor where the priest would wash their
[56:03] hands right after killing the sacrifice
[56:06] that represents water baptism people
[56:08] don't get excited we just have three
[56:09] people baptized a few weeks ago I was
[56:11] excited Hallelujah I was
[56:13] rejoicing one of the sisters was crying
[56:15] before she was crying right after the
[56:16] baptism I thought there's a real sincere
[56:18] believer right there
[56:20] amen
[56:22] hallelujah see but you know some people
[56:25] if they got sin their life oh someone's
[56:26] baptized I can't make it I can't make it
[56:28] to the
[56:29] baptism oh big deal it don't mean
[56:32] nothing to them anymore because they're
[56:34] spiritually cut off from the
[56:37] fellowship everybody understand isn't
[56:40] this a isn't this a beautiful type this
[56:42] will make a Jewish rabbi into a holy
[56:43] ghost
[56:44] Rabbi amen I know Jesus said don't call
[56:47] any man Rabbi I know that but brother I
[56:49] called him Rabbi you know just it's just
[56:51] a title it's not like a master or God or
[56:53] Lord you know it's not like something
[56:55] serious like that
[56:58] and see then people come to church and
[56:59] you know they're not moved by the seven
[57:01] Church ages those seven candlesticks
[57:02] right there seven fingers those seven
[57:04] cands the church ages don't move them
[57:07] and all those promises to the Overcomer
[57:09] in the church ages man that ought to
[57:11] move us praise
[57:13] God and brother said your life is
[57:16] depicted in the seven candlesticks do
[57:18] you realize that your life in other
[57:21] words you are one of those Wicks and
[57:23] your Wick is dipped into the oil oil and
[57:26] there's another Wick that the world
[57:29] sees you are dipped into the oil of God
[57:32] you're feeding on the oil of God you're
[57:34] pulling from the Holy Ghost on one side
[57:36] and you're a burning light to everybody
[57:39] else oh my Hallelujah the Bible said
[57:42] you're rooted and grounded in Christ
[57:44] Hallelujah I'm getting excited amen when
[57:46] my voice goes up I get a little
[57:48] excited see a part of you your soul is
[57:51] drawing on the oil and then everybody
[57:54] sees your light shine amen you're like a
[57:56] city on a hill that cannot be hidden
[57:58] praise God brother said that's your life
[58:01] in the church ages and look you're on
[58:03] the same oil as all the other SE six
[58:05] Church
[58:06] ages you're feeding on the same oil
[58:09] Martin Luther was feeding on you're
[58:10] feeding on the same oil St Paul was
[58:12] feeding on Hallelujah because we got the
[58:14] same word of
[58:15] God and then the bread brother the bread
[58:18] is the Mysteries that fresh shoe bread
[58:21] there's 12 uh doctrines called Mysteries
[58:23] that's what I wrote the book on and
[58:25] you're feeding on the WRA brother you're
[58:27] feeding on the godhead he's only one
[58:29] person and the Bible said that bread
[58:31] never goes stale they had to switch it
[58:33] every week but and God switches it God
[58:35] gives you a fresh sermon every week
[58:37] hallelujah oh my it's beautiful it's a
[58:39] beautiful time
[58:42] amen and then what's the last thing
[58:44] what's the last thing before you're born
[58:45] again prayer how many know that you've
[58:47] been born again you had to pray before
[58:49] you got born
[58:51] again the altar of incense right the
[58:54] priest had to get the he got had to get
[58:55] a fire off there and he had to put it in
[58:57] the sensor that now the pope has one
[58:59] it's a it's a it's a false copycat right
[59:02] it's
[59:04] impostor but there's a real s there's a
[59:06] real there was a holy sensor right and
[59:09] the high priest had to get that on fire
[59:10] and he had to make all the incense go
[59:13] there in other words his prayers had to
[59:15] go into the presence of God and if he
[59:16] didn't go in there he died if he didn't
[59:19] have that sensor he died I'll say like
[59:21] this if you didn't and remember there
[59:22] was fire in that
[59:24] sensor so you got to have the fire of
[59:26] God when you
[59:27] pray you got to have some life when you
[59:30] pray you got to have the fire of God the
[59:32] church said you got to be praying in the
[59:35] spirit amen under sanctification glory
[59:37] and when you pray in the spirit that
[59:39] takes you into the presence of God
[59:41] hallelujah and then brother says in
[59:43] there it's just you and
[59:45] God Amen because God's in your soul now
[59:49] it's like you're going in there but
[59:50] God's actually coming in here in the
[59:52] soul and the church said amen see see
[59:56] that beautiful beautiful
[59:58] type brother man said this will make a
[1:00:00] Jewish man a holy ghost
[1:00:03] man Hallelujah I'm already at an hour so
[1:00:06] let me I'm going to close now by God's
[1:00:07] grace this is the shortest I ever
[1:00:08] preached on
[1:00:10] this yes okay now I'm
[1:00:14] closing how many know they're sprinkling
[1:00:16] the New Testament and it ain't for your
[1:00:19] I'm sorry ain't it's not for your water
[1:00:20] baptism
[1:00:22] sorry my grammar let's go to this one
[1:00:25] first
[1:00:26] there's only one time that the word
[1:00:28] sprinkle is used in the New Testament
[1:00:30] and it's not when John the Baptist John
[1:00:31] the Baptist didn't sprinkle anybody he
[1:00:33] took him down into the water
[1:00:36] Hallelujah Peter said you are elect
[1:00:39] remember election that's part of
[1:00:40] predestination remember that forign
[1:00:42] knowledge predestination election uh
[1:00:44] justification glorification remember
[1:00:46] that preach it a few about a month ago
[1:00:48] now the Five Points of predestination
[1:00:51] five steps you're chosen according to
[1:00:54] the four knowledge there it is four
[1:00:55] knowledge of God
[1:00:57] the father through sanctification that
[1:00:59] means separation sanctify sanctify means
[1:01:01] to separate right you clean something
[1:01:04] and you separate it you sanctify away
[1:01:06] from everything
[1:01:07] else so God takes you out of your for
[1:01:10] your old church your denomination and he
[1:01:11] separates you hallelujah or he separates
[1:01:14] you from your dirty habits or your old
[1:01:16] habits the way he used to live he
[1:01:18] sanctifies you he separates you unto
[1:01:20] what what does he take you to he takes
[1:01:22] you unto what now obedience and spring
[1:01:25] spr Ling of the blood of Jesus
[1:01:28] Christ and the church
[1:01:30] said amen the Jews couldn't even come
[1:01:33] worship God unless they were sprinkled
[1:01:36] first they couldn't even they couldn't
[1:01:38] go in the Holy I'm sorry the they
[1:01:39] couldn't even go to the outer Court
[1:01:40] unless they were sprinkled they couldn't
[1:01:42] even how how many know there's five Old
[1:01:45] Testament sacrifices did you know that
[1:01:46] the sin offering trespass meat offering
[1:01:49] I can never remember those last two
[1:01:51] there's five Old Testament sacrifices
[1:01:54] and the Jew could not give any of those
[1:01:56] unless they were first sprinkled or
[1:01:58] Anointed with God's
[1:02:01] purification now how many want to come
[1:02:03] to church and give God a sacrifice that
[1:02:05] he's pleased with I hope all hands would
[1:02:07] be up I hope all hearts are up
[1:02:09] Hallelujah the Bible said we're
[1:02:11] spiritual priests we offer spiritual
[1:02:13] sacrifice unto God giving God glory
[1:02:16] giving God thanks singing worshiping
[1:02:18] praising God uh giving food to the poor
[1:02:21] all these things helping out people
[1:02:23] those are all spiritual sacrifices that
[1:02:25] God rece
[1:02:27] receives all right you see when you
[1:02:30] repent when when you repent and you
[1:02:32] start obeying god let's say you're
[1:02:34] disobeying let's say you lied like

[1:02:39] person I'm sorry I lied you've just been
[1:02:41] sprinkled oh there it is amen
[1:02:44] hallelujah or if you're a husband you
[1:02:46] got to go say you got to tell your wife

[1:02:50] you say sorry you're sprinkled with the
[1:02:52] anointing you're you're forgiven and the
[1:02:54] church said everybody understand now
[1:02:57] when you finally
[1:02:59] obey and you confess your sin you
[1:03:02] confess your wrong and you go back and
[1:03:04] you make it right you're sprinkled with
[1:03:05] a fresh anointing amen hallelujah you
[1:03:08] got a fresh anointing and then when you
[1:03:10] go into worship you can enter all the
[1:03:13] way in into fellowship with God Almighty
[1:03:16] then the cross means something then the
[1:03:18] water of washing and Water by the word
[1:03:20] then it means something then prayer can
[1:03:22] be effective then the church ages and
[1:03:25] the word of God feasting on the word and
[1:03:27] then prayer it means something because
[1:03:29] now you're sprinkled and you're
[1:03:30] separated from your past
[1:03:32] sins
[1:03:35] Hallelujah so now you know Church there

[1:03:46] message by God's grace in other words
[1:03:48] you ask yourself am I having fellowship
[1:03:49] with God do I feel like I'm in
[1:03:51] Fellowship With God all it takes is
[1:03:54] obedience Lord for forgive me I'll go
[1:03:56] make this right or Lord forgive me I
[1:03:58] won't do that I'll separate myself from
[1:04:00] that I want to be sprinkled and I want
[1:04:03] to come back into fellowship with you
[1:04:05] that's how quickly God does
[1:04:07] it I'm glad church I'm glad brother Irv
[1:04:10] I'm glad I don't have to wait seven days
[1:04:11] till God will fellowship with me again
[1:04:14] that's how long they had to
[1:04:15] wait you had to wait seven days if
[1:04:18] something died in your home or is there
[1:04:20] some some infectious disease you had to
[1:04:22] be sprinkled on the first third and
[1:04:24] Seventh Day now you can go to
[1:04:27] church boy I I would not have liked
[1:04:29] living In Those Old Testament days I'm
[1:04:30] glad I got a blood that cleanses me
[1:04:33] right away by God's grace it brings me
[1:04:35] back into Fellowship praise
[1:04:38] God now this this verse should now take
[1:04:41] on a new meaning for all of us here
[1:04:43] tonight I believe this is my last verse
[1:04:46] Jesus says therefore if thou bringest
[1:04:48] thy gift to the altar now that was Old
[1:04:50] Testament but for us it's bringing our
[1:04:52] praise bringing our worship bringing our
[1:04:54] our amens Thanksgiving to the word of
[1:04:56] God and you remember your brother has
[1:04:59] something against you
[1:05:01] oh he my sister is upset with me my
[1:05:04] brother's upset with me I Sinn against
[1:05:05] them what did Jesus say did Jesus say
[1:05:07] just keep offering no he said before you
[1:05:11] come and worship you go make that right
[1:05:15] first leave there thy gift before the
[1:05:18] Altar and go thy way first be reconciled
[1:05:22] to thy brother and then come and offer
[1:05:25] thy
[1:05:27] gift can everybody see the the this is
[1:05:29] the anti-type of the
[1:05:31] type the type was you can't come and
[1:05:34] worship until you're cleansed and here's
[1:05:36] the antitype I can't come to church and
[1:05:38] serve God until I've confessed the
[1:05:40] wrongs that I've
[1:05:42] done and then the word of God and then
[1:05:46] God will have fellowship with me
[1:05:50] Hallelujah now let's stand to our feet
[1:05:53] and I want you to look at this slide
[1:05:54] this last slide
[1:05:57] if you feel you're out of fellowship and
[1:05:59] what I mean by that is you don't you
[1:06:01] don't feel the peace of God you know
[1:06:02] what you need you need a sprinkling of
[1:06:04] the blood of Jesus
[1:06:06] Christ if some if the if the enemy has
[1:06:09] taken your peace you can get it back
[1:06:12] tonight the Bible says something you the
[1:06:14] Bible said you can be sprinkled you can
[1:06:16] be separated and you can be o obedient
[1:06:19] to the word of God and God will bring
[1:06:21] back a fresh anointing on you I've seen
[1:06:23] it brother I've been pastoring for 18
[1:06:25] years this is absolutely the truth I can
[1:06:28] be discouraged when I come to church
[1:06:30] there's times I'm I don't even feel like
[1:06:31] going to church I'm the pastor I preach
[1:06:34] almost every time there's times I don't
[1:06:35] even feel like going to church because
[1:06:37] I'm tired I'm worn out I'm sick I didn't
[1:06:38] sleep good last night but I it's never
[1:06:41] fail me if I I always just press through
[1:06:44] the
[1:06:44] church and then when I'm there I can I
[1:06:47] start worshiping God I confess my sins
[1:06:49] or whatever I say God forgive me my bad
[1:06:50] attitude and God's spirit freshly
[1:06:52] anoints me oh my for 18 years years has
[1:06:55] been that way
[1:06:57] Hallelujah in other words we always have
[1:06:59] a way to be purified we always have a
[1:07:02] way to get back into fellowship with God
[1:07:04] God's not trying to keep us out he's
[1:07:06] trying to invite us in but we got to
[1:07:08] come God's provided
[1:07:10] way anybody need forgiven tonight you've
[1:07:13] got a blood that you can be sprinkled
[1:07:15] with
[1:07:15] tonight anybody feel guilty tonight of
[1:07:18] any sin you have a blood that can take
[1:07:20] away that guilty feeling you can be
[1:07:23] sprinkled the Holy Ghost will come
[1:07:24] anoint you when you obey and make that
[1:07:27] right anyone need redeemed right you
[1:07:30] feel I'm I'm I'm bought back into the
[1:07:33] the the the plan of God the family of
[1:07:34] God you got a blood for that you feel
[1:07:38] you're you're you're far from the church
[1:07:40] the blood of Jesus Christ can reconcile
[1:07:42] you anybody feel like they need Purge
[1:07:45] and you got some dirt build up the blood
[1:07:48] can Purge you Hallelujah anybody feel
[1:07:51] like you you're not doing anything for
[1:07:52] God you're not doing a good work the
[1:07:54] blood can take away that feeling and the
[1:07:56] blood can sprinkle you and put you back
[1:07:58] into
[1:07:59] service anybody feel immature or like
[1:08:02] you're not growing by the grace of God
[1:08:04] you can confess that obey God and
[1:08:06] there's a blood to purify you from that
[1:08:10] Hallelujah is the word of God clear
[1:08:13] tonight amen let's bow our heads
[1:08:21] here again the Waters of Separation The
[1:08:25] anointing of the water would separate
[1:08:27] you from your sin any dead thing you
[1:08:29] touch in other words any sin you've
[1:08:31] dealt with or touched the blood of
[1:08:33] Christ will separate you from that and
[1:08:35] bring you back into
[1:08:37] Fellowship you know we've seen it at our
[1:08:39] church too before we
[1:08:41] pray uh after I preach this there was
[1:08:43] Couples you know like a husband and wife
[1:08:45] and they were maybe arguing or something
[1:08:46] and I always appreciated a couple of
[1:08:48] them would they'd stay out in the car
[1:08:49] and confess they talk to each other and
[1:08:51] forgive one another before they would
[1:08:53] come into church I thought that was
[1:08:54] really mature
[1:08:57] brother B says we want to be in here now
[1:08:58] I know we're not perfect what we should
[1:08:59] be growing in this brother B said we
[1:09:01] should be in here 30 minutes beforehand
[1:09:02] praying so we should be praying at six
[1:09:04] o'clock God's going to have to help us
[1:09:06] by God's
[1:09:07] grace it's a good it's a good habit it's
[1:09:10] not a law but it's a good habit you know
[1:09:11] we'll have we'll have better Services if
[1:09:13] we pray more before
[1:09:17] service but I have always appreciate
[1:09:19] those married couples that once they
[1:09:22] heard my message on this now it's God's
[1:09:23] message it's not mine once they heard
[1:09:25] the preaching on this they actually
[1:09:27] applied it to their lives and they'd sit
[1:09:29] in the car and I knew before church if I
[1:09:31] saw them out there and they were talking
[1:09:32] and they weren't really happy I kind of
[1:09:34] knew what was going on I was like oh
[1:09:36] they're letting the Waters of Separation
[1:09:39] they're letting it wash them before they
[1:09:40] come to church I said I like that that's
[1:09:42] real mature I
[1:09:44] say love you all God bless you now not
[1:09:49] every time can you do that right but you
[1:09:52] want to do that as much as
[1:09:54] possible and there there's also this
[1:09:55] idea too as soon as the service is over
[1:09:58] if you got to go confess something go
[1:09:59] confess something so you can feel that
[1:10:01] fresh anointing by God's grace how many
[1:10:04] want that how many want to feel clean by
[1:10:06] God's grace let's bow our hearts and
[1:10:07] we'll have a word of prayer father God
[1:10:09] I've preached an hour and 10 minutes
[1:10:11] just 70 minutes here Lord thank you God
[1:10:12] for these special moments Lord God I
[1:10:14] look back when I would sit on metal
[1:10:17] chairs when I first came in the message
[1:10:20] and I'd be in Saturday night services
[1:10:22] just like this where there's no
[1:10:23] instruments it's only clapping we only
[1:10:25] have the instruments of the hands oh
[1:10:26] this brings back such great memories to
[1:10:27] me Lord God thank you for this church

[1:10:43] Spirit that's here tonight Lord would
[1:10:45] lead your people back into fellowship if
[1:10:47] anyone feels far away from God hopefully
[1:10:49] not everybody feels that way but Lord if
[1:10:50] anybody feels far away from God lord may
[1:10:53] they know there's a water of separation
[1:10:55] there's a sprinkling of the spirit of
[1:10:57] God hallelujah that can bring them back
[1:11:00] into Fellowship that will forgive them
[1:11:02] Lord if they confess their sin and obey
[1:11:05] the word of God hallelujah thank you God

[1:11:33] father move upon your people here
[1:11:35] tonight Lord God and I pray Lord if

[1:11:42] Fellowship where the the cross meant
[1:11:44] more to them Lord the water meant more
[1:11:48] the knowledge of the word the bread the
[1:11:49] prayers meant more and then they could
[1:11:51] go into your presence Hallelujah and
