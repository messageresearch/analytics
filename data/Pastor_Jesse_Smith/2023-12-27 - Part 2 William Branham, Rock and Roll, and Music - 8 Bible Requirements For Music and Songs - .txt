TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] now you that don't believe in music in the church what about that and the spirit of the Lord come up the prophet when the music was playing greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm Pastor Jesse Smith from bride of Christ Fellowship in akan Ohio USA and I defend the Bible revelations Jesus Christ revealed to his Prophet The Late William brandham 19091 1965 5 welcome to part two of our video series on William brandham rock and roll and music in part one we covered the vision the Lord Jesus gave to brother brandham to condemn rock and roll and warn the Bride of Jesus Christ to stay away from rock and roll and of course all sins as brother random ended The Vision by shouting out stay in line now here in part two we will go through eight Bible requirements for music and songs and of course there could be more Bible requirements and I'm not a musician so I'm not an expert on this subject I'm just trying to rightly divide the scriptures in the area of music and songs I'm relying upon the wisdom and discernment of the Holy Ghost in this area by the grace of our Lord Bible requirement number one is we must prove what music pleases God because every sound and song has a meaning friends it is the job of the pastor song leader and every musician along with every Christian to prove the music and songs that please the Holy Spirit Ephesians 59 and 10 speak of the fruit of the spirit in all goodness and righteousness and Truth proving what is acceptable unto the Lord 1 Thessalonians 521 prove all things hold fast that which is good and then a main text about sounds and identifying the meanings of them is 1 Corinthians 14 6-11 in context this is referring to tongues interpretation but this is easily relatable to music Paul says things giving sound except they give a distinction in the sound how shall be known what is piped or harped the Bible says for the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself for battle likewise except you utter by the Tongue words easy to be understood how shall be known what is spoken so we can see the scripture is emphasizing understanding the meaning of the sound the meaning of the voice so must apply that to music and remember Exodus 32:1 17-19 from part one Joshua thought he heard a noise of war in the camp but Moses understood the meaning of the sound it was the noise of them that sing and this was a song and dance of idolatry so that's what we must listen for we must listen for which songs sound like idolatry where the focus is off of the Lord Jesus Christ and its focus is exalting the flesh exal in the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life and as a brother shared with me I believe it was brother Alex he said there must be a difference in our worship services in the message of the hour the Holy Ghost filled churches compared to the worship Services of CCM churches or mega churches this is found of course in Ezekiel 44:23 in context it's speaking of the Jewish priest but we can see how it was God's desire for the teachers or the Priests of Israel to teach the people the difference between the holy and profane and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean so we can take this verse along with prove all things and then the verses in 1 Corinthians 14 to show how we must we must prove what kind of music and sounds God approves of and also be able to discern which ones god disproves of the second and third Bible requirements for music and songs are second loud songs and also skillful musicians this is found in Psalm 33:3 sing unto him a new song plays skillfully with a loud noise so with this requirement we see the variety in music we can see how loud crescendos then are acceptable they're part of God's variety of Music the Bible says play loud but it doesn't say how loud so we have to find a god honoring balance with the loudness of course as any honest person knows God can move in a loud atmosphere such as the loud rejoicing and praise of the multitude in Luke 19:37 and Jesus refused to stop that multitude from the loud praising and rejoicing Jesus sanctioned the loud shouting and rejoicing but God can also move in a quiet atmosphere like the still Small Voice First Kings 19:12 although it is important to note that the Lord's presence caused the loud earthquake Wind and Fire as First Kings 19:11 say says so God's presence did cause a lot of noise but then his voice was a still Small Voice and also recall the book of Exodus where God thundered out his voice from Mount Si and the people didn't want to hear directly from God anymore so God speaks in both loud and quiet voices here's a quote from brother brandom from seeking after Jesus where brother R said play softly only believe so we can see brother Bram like soft music and notice he says how many believes that the spirit of God comes in music let's listen to the quote and if you will my sister s uh play softly only believe if you will or abide with me something like that how many believes that the spirit of God comes in music now on the other end of the spectrum here's a quote from what does thou hear 1959 brother brandom says America loves noise they got to have it so loud it'll blast your eard drums out nearly all the noise all the time of the day so see the Bible says we want loud music but we don't want it too loud where people's eard drums are hurt let's listen to the quote that's what I'm thinking today friends we people are so are so carried away with all the noise so America loves noise look at what they're doing they turn on these old radios just as hard as they can with rock and roll and booly woly all that kind of stuff they've got to have it so loud it'll blast your eard drums out nearly all the noise all the time of the day the fourth requirement for music and songs is the requirement of instruments and how instruments are acceptable we find this in Luke 15:25 Jesus's Parable told about the Elder son drawing n to the house and he heard music and dancing in the Greek that word music can mean Unison of sound that is a concert of instruments harmonious note of course there's more support for this as well the New Testament is a better Covenant with better promises as Hebrews 8:6 says and there there's no prohibition of instruments in the New Testament recall God loved David's worship as a man after God's Own Heart and David was the one who instituted musicians in the daily worship of Jehovah in 1st Chronicles 23:5 2 Chronicles 7:6 and it's acts 13:22 that says David was a man after God's Own Heart so by all these proofs we conclude the use of instruments is undoubtedly a blessing in the New Testament as long as they're used to the glory of God here's a quote where brother connects isua Pentecostals to having old guitars and singing in the streets and brother Ram speaks of it in a positive way 1959 what was the Holy Ghost given for let's listen to the quote I remember Pentecostal conversions is Holy Ghost fi conversions in a minority to start with on the side of the alley out there with a old guitar and women couldn't even afford a pair of stockings well out on the railroad tracks and picking up corn and mash it and making bread for their children but what's it come to the most powerful standing Church in the world today not in the eyes of the world but in the eyes of God because he proves it for what he's doing for him he's pouring himself into them pouring it in here's another quote from identified with Christ 1959 brother random said he was out West in Arizona and a man named slim and his friend were on the guitar helping bring the spirit upon brother brandham that got him ready to eventually repent shortly thereafter let's listen to the quote a brother one time way back up down in the mountains in Arizona bringing down a herd of cattle one night I sitting there and a boy named slim had an old home with a piece of paper over he was playing and another fell sitting there from Texas with a get to our struming and they come on to him I had my saddle off the horse laying down my head using it for a pillar and my blanket up all me there still with my boots on a pair of Spurs holding me up off the ground and he begin to scum down at the cross where my savior died down therefore for cleansing from sin I cried there to my heart was a blood applied glor glory to his name I try to pull a blanket up and stop my ears up I look up the stars hanging low and them Whispering Pines in the mountains seem to cry Adam Where Art Thou oh cattle raising was a second thing I wanted to find God way back out there kicked up on a pair of those Spurs I said sir I don't know who you are but don't punish me until I can find the real thing two days after that down in the city sitting there and I after a few days after that after round up I sitting there on a little old park bench little Spanish girl come by I was sitting there thinking about God what could it be and the little girl come by me just about 18year old boy she Dred her hand and walk by I said woman you dropped your handkerchief just the thoughts of G had changed my desire a poor Irish heart was a hunger I wanted something something that satisfies one more thought about instruments as a brother shared with me I believe it was brother Alex again when we get into specific instruments in part three of this series like drums electric guitar bass guitar Etc we have to be very careful how we use these instruments because it's a lot like driving a a Ferrari a Ferrari has lots of power and it's hard to handle all that power and so the same is true with drums electric guitar bass guitar these instruments have a lot of power or influence over the music and so it takes someone who's very disciplined someone who has a lot of temperance that can play these instruments in a way that pleases the holy spirit that person has to be led of the Holy Spirit to handle all that power and keep that power under control keep those instruments under control control of the Holy Spirit and again we'll see more of this fully explained in the third video in this series Lord willing the fifth requirement for music and songs is that music must create an atmosphere for the Holy Ghost to move this is according to 2 Kings 3: 5 Elisha said bring me a Minstrel when the minstrel played the hand of the Lord came upon him and here's a further part of this quote where brother Ram was speaking of playing softly only believe and he says the spirit of God comes in music and he references Elisha let's listen to the quote and if you will my sister s uh play softly only believe if you will or abide with me something like that how many believes that the spirit of God comes in music remember when Elisha got all stewed up one time and he said if it wasn't I respected the presence of Jehoshaphat I wouldn't even look at you is that right but he said nevertheless bring me a minstral and the music begin to play now you that don't believe in music in the church what about that and the spirit of the Lord come up on the prophet when the music was playing so every church is required to play music that will create an atmosphere for the Holy Ghost to move for gifts to operate for prayers to be answered the sixth Bible requirement for music and songs is that we must sing new songs and of course this would include new music again according to Psalm 33:3 sing unto him a new song play skillfully with the loud noise now this six requirement will lead to another closely related question should we as message Believers sing songs of famous CCM artists the answer is you take your own liberty to answer this question for your church individually each church is Sovereign of itself but one thing is for sure you cannot condemn singing some of the CCM songs if they're scriptural so new songs that include good lyrics can come from bad people or bad seed because these songwriters have the gift to write songs and God gave them those gifts to write the songs and this is the same concept that balum was a bad seed he went to hell According to second Peter chapter 2 but he had good prophecy he prophesied at the star of Jacob so gifts of God in people's lives like songwriters from Hillsong or bethl can produce god-honoring songs despite the lives of these songwriters being being sinful at times or maybe sinful most of the time I don't know so this means pastors song leaders musicians and every Christian is then required to discern each song and the lyrics to ensure they are scriptural lyrics here's a quote where brother random said the wise men had to follow the prophecy of balum from 1954 let's listen to the quote and as it was for Jesus so was a Morning Star ass signed to the wise man that came from the East there had heard that there would be a star of Jacob rise balam the prophet prophesied of it and they knew that there would be a star arise and this star would be the sign that there'd be a King born on the Earth that would be a savior to all the nations and when they seen this star arise it was a sign to them to get ready yes sir that the Redemption was at hand yes here's another quote from there is a man here that can turn on a light 1963 brother Ram said balum was a prophet truly and he prophesied a star would rise out of Jacob and then the Wise Men followed this prophecy so we see wise men following the prophecy from a gift of God from a prophet who eventually went to hell let's listen to the quote and then we find out that balum the prophet back in numbers 2417 uh balum was kindly of Mai himself he was a prophet truly and he prophesied here and said a star would rise out of Jacob and when these wise men saw that the word of God said a star would rise out of Jacob they followed that little god-given token to the source of eternal life then again here in the anointed ones of the end time 1965 brother Ram said the prophecy of bam was correct it was his teaching that was false brother Ram said the anointing of God upon balam's gift wouldn't speak nothing else and God Vindicated by proving it was the truth but Ram said it was the teaching of balum that was wrong let's listen to the quote now the teaching of balum not the prophecy of baam that was all right that was God how many believ that amen the prophecy of bam was exactly right because he couldn't speak nothing else the anointing of God wouldn't speak nothing else and God Vindicated it by proving it was the truth but it was the teaching of baam anointed ones but their teaching is false trinities and all things like that wrong Antichrist here's another point I want to make some people say we should should not sing new songs only old songs but friends at some point every song We Sing was a new song so that begs the question so how far back do we go only songs from the 19th century or the first half of the 20th century or do we only do songs that were written during brother bram's lifetime what about all these wonderful songs that have been written after brother Bram went off the scene so I believe that God still has people today that have the gift to write songs and then they must be faithful with their gift to write a song they don't want to bury their songwriting gift in the ground like Jesus's parable of the talents because Jesus called that man Wicked and lazy we don't want to be Wicked and lazy with our gifts to write songs so this Bible requirement of writing new songs is good because it requires Believers to invest in their own songwriting gifts Believers should not waste their gifts before moving on to the next requirement note this quote from 1957 brother brandom says he said there's something about those old-fashioned songs the oldtime hymn I'd rather have them than all these worldly songs put in and of course this is a beautiful quote but notice brother Ram said worldly songs he didn't say new Christian Godly songs so this quote balances out we need new songs but brother Ram is basically saying those old songs are wonderful and anointed of the Holy Ghost as well so that's what we need today as message Believers as Holy Ghost filled Saints we need both new songs but we cannot forget the old songs let's listen to the quote don't you just love that scouring you feel good raise your hands there's something about those oldfashioned songs the old time him I'd rather have in all these new worldly songs put in in and Christian churches I like that old I like [Music] Jesus Keep [Music] Me [Music] there the [Music] preious free to all our healing BL from C [Music] in the in the cross oh be my glory he my r [Music] Soul shall find [Music] the I could go out of the world pretty easy when that's being say couldn't you how wonderful has it all settled you know I'm glad I done settled it all up aren't you the old accounts all settled long time ago the seventh Bible requirement for music and songs is we must include these types of songs Psalms hymns spiritual songs making Melody and songs of thanks this is found in Ephesians 518-20 the Bible says speaking yourselves in Psalms now in the Greek this means a striking or twanging striking the chords of a musical instrument used of the book of Psalms of course from the Old Testament the word hymn In the Greek here means a song in the tithe Praise of God a sacred song the word melody in the Greek means to cause to vibrate by touching to twang to touch or strike the chord to twang the strings of a musical instruments so that they gently vibrate to play on a string instrument to play the harp Etc to play to sing to the music of the harp in the New Testament to sing A Hymn to celebrate the Praises of God in song then verse 20 says giving thanks always for all things unto God the eighth and final Bible requirement for music and songs is songs that use the name of Jesus Christ and his word in Acts 4:17 and 18 the apostles were threatened that they should speak henceforth to no man in this name of Jesus they commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus anyone knows that songs have great power and potential to teach and so we must speak and teach in the name of Jesus Jesus we must speak about Jesus in our songs we must teach about Jesus in our songs we must not add to the word of God nor take away according to Proverbs 30: 5 and 6 we must not change the gospel with any lyrics in our songs according to Galatians 1: 8 and9 Paul said If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that which you have received let him be ACC cursed I share two examples before finishing up here when I first came in the message there was a song that came out by SAA it was called You Raise Me Up I remember listening this song the first few times when people sang it as a song special or we sang at the church and I just kept asking myself where is the name of Jesus in this song and it bothered me a little bit and I guess it still bothers me to this day so I think if we're going to sing this song which we don't sing it at our church but if we did we would need to add the name of Jesus to this song now we don't want to be legalistic either for example when a preacher is called to the pulpit some Churches might sing the course only believe and maybe they'll just say only believe all all things are possible only believe and of course the name of God or Jesus is not used in just that course of the song so we're not trying to be legalistic we want to meet the requirement that we should use the name of Jesus Christ another example is the song you say by Lauren dagel now we have never sang this song at our church mainly because of the lack of Christian lyrics this song doesn't say God or Lord or Jesus but I've heard message churches sing this song and so as Pastor I've never thought this song was a good song to sing and of course we despise the style clothing Pro lgbtq stance of Lauren dagel we would never support her as an artist or Christian musician but the main issue with this song is the lyrics the lyrics are missing the name of Jesus Christ in closing friends I hope part two has been a blessing by the grace of God I hope these eight Bible requirements for music and songs were helpful for you as the Bible and brother Ram taught us we must take everything back back to the word of God the word of God is our foundation the word of God is our absolute and so please let me know if this video was helpful as I said in the podcast in relation to music please send me any questions for future videos and by God's grace we'll try to answer them the best we can I'm definitely looking forward to part three with defining rock and roll I would say this would probably be the most important video in the series I'll try to show real examples from CCM artists and by the help of God find the balance so we can clearly discern rock and roll that should be condemned and differentiated between holy Godly music and we should be able to enjoy the liberty of the Holy Ghost that the Holy Ghost gives us with instruments new songs volume and so forth if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
