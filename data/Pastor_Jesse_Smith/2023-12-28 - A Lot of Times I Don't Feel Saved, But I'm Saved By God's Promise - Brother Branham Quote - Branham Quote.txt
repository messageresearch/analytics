TRANSCRIPT
========================================
listen brother you're never saved by any sign you're never saved by any sensation you're saved when you meet God's condition of his word and nothing else are you saved by right God's word has made a way you're not saved because you feel like you're saved I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved because a lot of times I don't feel that way but I'm saved because God gave the promise I met God's conditions enough on God's holy word I can defeat Satan seven days in a week and as many nights because it's God's word he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come to judgment but pass and death to life that's what the King of Kings said you believe it if you believe not if you shout not if you run them things are all right but you're trying to base to make a Doctrine out of it and even on Divine Healing you're making a Doctrine and Divine Healing is a minor how can the church ever major on a minor ask that question and than it over it's a mixed multitude it's a multitude that's the reason friends let me tell you you something two weeks ago there's man sitting here looking at me right now was in the meeting in Li Ohio where I had the Methodist the Baptist and the Presbyterian and some Nazarene Salvation Army all sponsor my meeting in a great big Auditorium they're standing on the word and proving by the word the Lord Jesus and the real gospel things that was to take place and night after night hundred of them walk down to the altar giving their hearts to Christ upon not a sensation upon the word let me tell you something brother now I want you to listen quiet and as I close on this I am firmly believing this and I say this not knowing whether I live to see daylight or not but there is a supernatural has been done that's true but you're going wild with it you're going on the deep end with it the devil's pushing you off with it you got come out of the Bible now I believe in the Supernatural I believe in Jesus Christ I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever and does the same things that he did yesterday and will forever that's right I believe that
