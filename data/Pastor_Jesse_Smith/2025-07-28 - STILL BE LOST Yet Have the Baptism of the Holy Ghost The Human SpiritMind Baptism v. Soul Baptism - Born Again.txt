TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I'm going to give you one little chook you. The baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in. Not at all. Not going to have no having to do your soul. That's a baptism. See, there's an inside soul in here that has to come from God. Remember, in that spirit, you can be baptized with a genuine spirit of God and still be lost. It's the soul that lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was ordained of God. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about a few quotes from God's prophet brother Brandham that seemed to say a person can be baptized with the Holy Ghost and still be lost. This is an excellent question. Question I've had myself before, but by the grace of God and by looking at the context of the quotes and taking every quote back to the scripture, we can fully understand what brother Brandon was saying. The answer to this question is that brother Ramon was saying you can have the Holy Ghost in your spirit. Your human spirit or your mind which is the same thing. The human spirit is the mind as Paul said be renewed in the spirit of your mind. But that anointing can leave because we know the greatest battle ever fought was in the mind and the mind needs transformed every single day. So a person can have the anointing in their mind as brother Ram said every day of their life and still be lost. That's because they could lose that anointing in their minds and then blasphe the Holy Ghost and be lost. But a person who is baptized with the Holy Ghost in their souls is sealed unto the day of their redemption as Ephesians 4:30 says. So in other words, we must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our soul. That's the presence of God in our soul in the throne of our heart we would say. And that anointing never leaves. That's a permanent anointing by the grace of God. Before we get to a couple quotes where brother Ram says this, let's do a little bit of a background. It seems like in these two quotes, Brother Random is using denominational Pentecostal terminology of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which to Pentecostals meant speaking in tongues as the initial evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost. It's most likely brother Ran was preaching to denominational Pentecostals often, especially here in 1965 when he gives us these two quotes. The first quote is from modern events made clear by prophecy in San Bernardino, California. And the second one was in Coina, California. I might be saying that wrong. Forgive me. The message leadership. So, Brother Brand was not speaking to his home church. He was doing the work of an evangelist outside of his home church by the grace of God. Here's a visual. Remember friends, it's so important to know that man has three parts. So, brother Ram is saying, as the Bible teaches, you can have the anointing in your human spirit or mind and still be lost because that anointing is only temporary as long as you allow it. Man has three parts. Body, human spirit or mind. And the third is the soul. The soul is the deepest part of man. That's his nature. That's his control tower, as brother Brandham said, that directs all of his actions. Now, it's understandable. You'll hear brother Brandham say, "I'm going to say something that chokes believers." And it's understandable why these quotes would choke believers. When brother Ram would say, "You can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and still be lost." It's understandable because Jesus said in John 3:es 5-6 that except a man be born of water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. So Jesus is emphasizing you must be born again. He says that in John 3:7 as well. Marvel not that I said unto thee, you must be born again. And then brother man would make numerous statements like this from 1959 questions and answers that Holy Ghost ought to be more important to you than everything else there is in the world. Your prestige, your life, your job, your anything that there is. You should not cease until you have it. You must receive it. &gt;&gt; That Holy Ghost ought to be more important to you than everything else there is in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. your prestige, your life, your job, your anything that there is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You should not cease until you have, you must receive it. &gt;&gt; So most balanced Bible preachers of the message will emphasize that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the most important thing. That's because that's what Jesus taught and that's because God's prophet, Brother Brandham, preached that as well. But then as this viewer asked, we run into quotes where brother Ram says, "You can have the baptism and be lost." And so the context of these two quotes will explain it so you can understand it fully by the grace of God. It's also important to know that right up until brother Brandon preached the seven seals, he taught that the new birth was different from the Holy Ghost baptism. There's numerous quotes like this one I'm going to share here. Why I'm Against Organized Religion, November 11th, 1962. But Ram said he heard a preacher, Charles Fuller, on the radio that believes something that he believed too. He said, "The new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The new birth is being born. The Holy Ghost is the baptism." &gt;&gt; I never thought there's a person believe that like me till this morning. You heard Charles Fuller as I was going down. He believes too that the new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The new birth is being born. The Holy Ghost is a baptism. All right. &gt;&gt; So, prior to preaching the revelation of the seven seals in March of 63, it seemed like brother Brandham believed the new birth was the same as being born again. But that was different from the Holy Ghost baptism. Now, we can understand it today and it seems Brother Brandon believed that the new birth or being born again was being saved. Brother Brandon believed that was the act of justification. But then the baptism of the Holy Ghost was the soul being filled by the spirit of God. Now, I have some helpful references, some videos that you'll want to watch if you're interested in this topic. I think the most important one would be the new birth and baptism of the Holy Ghost are one and the same. It's video 102. This will show Brother Ram's progress in his revelation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So, I highly recommend that one. Also, you can be saved and not born again. There's five examples from the New Testament of believers who were saved but yet not born again. So, this will show how they had the anointing of the Holy Ghost in their minds or their human spirits, but it wasn't in the soul yet until the Bible tells us they were filled with the Holy Ghost. Then another important one would be the 12 terms for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Brother Brandham says the filling, new birth, and baptism are the same. This is so important if you want to understand the Bible terminology correctly. I would encourage you to listen to this one, study, take notes on it. For the deepest dive of understanding the scripture on the new birth and the baptism of Holy Ghost, I would humbly recommend uh chapter 6. You can listen to the audiobook version online for free. It's the mystery of Christ in you, the hope of glory. This was chapter 6 in my 2021 book. It shows how Old Testament believers could have the filling of the Holy Ghost. Like it said of Bezale, one of the men who did a lot of construction on Moses' tabernacle, he was filled with the spirit of God. But that can only mean in the human mind or spirit because of John 7:37-39. The Holy Ghost could not be given until Jesus was glorified or until Jesus had resurrected and taken on a glorified body. Recently, I put out a video that will help as well. It's called question work for the Holy Ghost. Yes, work equals obey. Brother Ram taught that the rest was equal to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. This is super important if you want to understand this topic. In the New Testament, Jesus offered the Holy Ghost in the soul. It was rest for the soul. The soul no longer had to wrestle against God or fight against God. The soul could be fully filled with the Holy Ghost by the grace of God. Okay. So now, let's look at these two puzzling quotes that Brother Bram said might choke you. Hallelujah. Might choke us, but that's okay. We grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord. The first is from modern events made clear by prophecy, December 6,65. Brother Ram said, "I'm going to give you one that'll choke you. The baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in. Not at all. Not on that. Don't have anything to do with your soul." So notice he separates the soul from the human spirit. So brother Ram says the Pentecostals would have the filling in their human spirits or minds, but not in their soul. And then he goes on to talk about how there's five inlets to the human spirit. There's five inlets to the human body, but there's only one inlet to the soul. Then brother Ram says,"Remember in that spirit, that human spirit, you can be baptized with the genuine spirit of God and still be lost. It's the soul that lives that was ordained of God." Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; Notice we find today that people just can't believe it. Even spiritfilled people. I'm going to give you one little choke. The baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in. Not at all. Not going to have no having to do with your soul. That's a baptism. See, there's an inside soul in here that has to come from God. But then on the outside you have five senses and five out inlets to your contact your earthly home. The inside you have a spirit and in there you have five outlets. Your conscience and love and so forth. Five outlets to that spirit. Remember in that spirit you can be baptized with a genuine spirit of God and still be lost. It's the soul that lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was ordained of God. And then the next paragraph, brother Ram says the scripture from Matthew 7:21-23 where Jesus said, "Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not cast out devils?" And he'll say, "Depart from me, you workers of iniquity. I never knew you." And then he brings up Caiaphas. And then he brings up Balam. So Brother Ram gives three Bible witnesses. I love it. Brother Ram, such a scriptural prophet. three Bible witnesses of people that had the anointing of the Holy Ghost temporarily, but then they worked iniquity after the anointing left and they forfeited their salvation and they were lost. These many people on the day of judgment, Matthew 7, Caiaphas, and Balum. &gt;&gt; Didn't Jesus say, "Many will come to me that day and say, Lord, haven't I cast out devils, done great, mighty works, prophesied the great gifts of God." He said, "Depart from me, you that work iniquity. I never even knew you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Many will come in that day. Didn't K. Ephesus prophesy? &gt;&gt; He was a devil. &gt;&gt; We find out there in that priest, a great man was supposed to be great leaders in them days with humility and everything else, but failed to see the word of God itself made manifest before them. &gt;&gt; We could just take a bunch of them. I got wrote down here. How about Balum? He was a You say God changes his mind. He doesn't change his mind. &gt;&gt; So, it's so awesome. We have a scriptural prophet in the last days, brother William Brandham. By the grace of God, he always pointing us back to the word of God. And the second one I'll give you is leadership. December 7th, the next day, 1965, brother Ram said, "Many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm going to heaven." That don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven. You can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell. The Bible says so. Now brother Ram doesn't give us scripture right there directly in the context but of course if we go to the previous day when he preached on it he gave us three scriptures Matthew 7 Caiaphas scripture and the scriptures about Balum then in this leadership quote brother Ram goes into the five inlets to the human spirit and the five inlets to the human body but then he says but inside of that you've got a soul and that soul is that gene that come from God and then he breaks into a few paragraphs on predestination. This reminds us of 1 Peter 1:23. You must be born again of the incorruptible seed, the word of God. So the Holy Ghost, baptism in the soul is like a seed of God coming into your soul, giving life to your soul. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; The choice of your conduct, you could you can't mix it now. You're either for God or against God. &gt;&gt; And the outward expressions shows exactly what's on the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. the cockaber. Many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I'm going to heaven. That don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven. &gt;&gt; No sir, you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell. &gt;&gt; The Bible says so. &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. Look here. You are a outside person. You have five senses that contacts that outside body. God gave you five senses not to contact him. Your earthly home. See, taste, feel, smell, and hear. Then you have a spirit on the inside of that and it has five outlets. Conscience and love and so forth. Five outlets that you contact the spirit world with that. But with your spirit, your physical contacts the physical. Your spiritual contacts the spiritual. But inside of that you've got a soul. &gt;&gt; That soul is that chain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That come from God. &gt;&gt; We can do a few more Bible proofs here. By God's grace. Remember the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a mystery. That's why brother Bram said these things will choke people. It's hard to understand. You got to get into the spirit of the word of God. The human mind, the natural intellectual human mind cannot understand the deep things of God. It clearly teaches that in 1 Corinthians chapter 2. Paul said that the carnal mind is enmity against the spirit of God. But remember the Holy Ghost baptism is a mystery according to Colossians 1:26-28. But brother Brandham in the church age book gave us the revelation and he said it doesn't come according to me but it must come according to thus sayith the Lord. Then he went through all these scriptures in the Bible about how people had to be saved, sanctified and baptized with the Holy Ghost. You'll find that in chapter 4 of the church age book sian church age. He said it's not according to me. It's not according to you. It has to be according to thus sayith the Lord or we are falsely led. Amen. And then he goes through about 20 Bible verses showing thus sayith the Lord on the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. 1 Thessalonians 5:23 is also super important as the visual showed. You have three parts. You have body, human spirit which is the same as your human mind and the innermost part is the soul. This topic also closely relates to brother Bam's sermon from 1965, the anointed ones at the end time. how people can have the anointing on their flesh or their human mind but then forsake it later as a work of iniquity and then be lost. So that's an important message to listen to by the grace of God. And also as brother Random told us, it breaks into predestination. You'll find that in Ephesians 1:4. You had to be chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world. And there's five stages to predestination. You're fornown. You're predestinated. You're called, justified, glorified according to Romans 8:29 and 30. And then the people that are lost, Jude 1:4 says they're ordained to this condemnation. And then 2 Peter 2:12 said, "They were made to be taken and destroyed." We should rejoice. If we have a hunger and thirst for God, if we want to know more of God, we want to worship God, we want to surrender to God, we should rejoice because that proves we're the children of God. We want to be workers of righteousness, not workers of iniquity. In closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Again, please find those other videos if you want to go deeper on this topic by the grace of God. It's an excellent topic. It's so important because it is a Bible defined mystery. Colossians 1:26-28, the mystery that was hid from ages, Christ in you, the hope of glory. And again, it shows us how brother was way ahead of his time. He had the revelation from the Lord Jesus Christ. He finished the mystery of God. He said, "Revelation 10:1-7 is history." That means the mystery of God is finished. That means the seven thunders have been revealed and we understand what they are. They're the revelations contained in the seven seals. And now we can have the assurance if we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our souls. Then we are sealed unto the day of our redemption, we will never be lost. We were predestinated to be saved. We were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world. What a promise. What a blessing. What a joy divine. And so let's do as Peter said, let's make our calling and our election sure. Calling means the same as election in the Greek. So Peter references one of those steps there in the five steps of predestination. If we believe we were predestinated, let's prove it with our lives. Let's beat our body and bring it under subjection in obedience to the word of God so the Holy Ghost can live through our lives. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. is never fail. [Music]
