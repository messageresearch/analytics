[0:00] foreign
[0:08] friends in the matchless name of the
[0:11] Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this
[0:13] video is to look at over 25 rewards God
[0:17] promises for Christian acts of service
[0:20] and of course these acts or works of
[0:23] service are done with love
[0:25] Bible's clear in Ephesians 2 verses 8
[0:28] through 10 that were saved by grace
[0:29] through faith but Ephesians 2 10 clearly
[0:33] says we were created unto good works so
[0:36] these 25 plus works are acts of worship
[0:40] Jesus created us to perform by his grace
[0:43] and through the leadership of his holy
[0:45] spirit
[0:46] remember Jesus tells us in Matthew 6
[0:49] verses 20 and 21 to lay up for ourselves
[0:52] Treasures in Heaven he says for where
[0:54] your treasure is there will your heart
[0:56] be also Hebrews 6 10 tells us God is Not
[0:59] unrighteous to forget your work and
[1:02] labor of love which you have showed
[1:04] toward his name and that ye administered
[1:06] to the Saints and do minister
[1:08] and Galatians 6 verse 9 says and let us
[1:10] not be wearing well doing for in due
[1:12] season we shall reap if we faint not
[1:16] I love this quote from brother Brandon
[1:18] from the church age book chapter four
[1:19] brother random says all too little time
[1:21] is spent on laboring for the Eternal
[1:23] rewards of God
[1:25] brother Ram says we ought to lay up in
[1:26] heaven these good Treasures let's listen
[1:29] to the quote
[1:31] all too little time is spent on laboring
[1:33] for the Eternal rewards of God
[1:35] the recompense of God is too lightly
[1:38] esteemed if we believe in the reality of
[1:40] the resurrection of the body and an
[1:43] eternal Kingdom of substance then we
[1:45] ought to lay up in heaven those good
[1:47] Treasures that are available to the
[1:48] faithful Saints
[1:52] so now let's go through the list of Acts
[1:54] that God rewards and there is some
[1:56] overlap that's why I said around 25
[1:58] maybe a few more but the first two are
[2:01] withstanding persecution and enduring
[2:03] Temptation according to Matthew 5 verse
[2:06] 12 and James 1 verse 12.
[2:09] the next is giving a cup of water in the
[2:11] name of Jesus or a disciple found in
[2:13] Mark 9 41 and Matthew 10 42.
[2:17] next is receiving a prophet or righteous
[2:20] man in Matthew 10 verse 41.
[2:23] next is praying in secret according to
[2:25] Matthew 6 verse 6.
[2:28] next is giving alms in secret Matthew 6
[2:32] verse 4.
[2:33] the next two are planting and watering
[2:35] the gospel found in First Corinthians 3
[2:38] 8-9
[2:40] is leaving family members and
[2:43] possessions for the sake of the Lord
[2:45] found in Mark 10 29-30
[2:48] next is fighting a good fight and
[2:50] Keeping the Faith According to second
[2:52] Timothy 4 verses 7 and 8.
[2:55] next is making a dinner for those who
[2:57] cannot repay you according to Luke 14
[2:59] verses 12-14
[3:02] next is visiting fatherless children and
[3:06] widows in their Affliction according to
[3:08] James 1 verse 27 and of course this
[3:10] verse proves religion is a good word as
[3:13] long as the people that are performing
[3:15] the religious acts have pure hearts
[3:18] the next ACT is serving God willingly
[3:21] First Corinthians 9 verse 17.
[3:24] next is God rewards any Harley service
[3:27] done to the Lord Colossians 3 verses 24
[3:32] and 25.
[3:34] the next reward is for diligently
[3:36] seeking God according to Hebrews 11
[3:37] verse 6.
[3:40] fasting in secret is the next ACT that
[3:43] God honors and gives reward for found in
[3:45] Matthew 6 verse 18.
[3:47] Matthew 25 verses 34 through 40 lists
[3:51] six more acts that get rewarded
[3:54] it's providing food providing drink
[3:56] providing shelter or providing clothes
[3:59] to a Christian or visiting a Christian
[4:02] when he's sick or in prison
[4:05] then in Luke 6 verses 27-33 there's
[4:08] rewards for loving your enemies blessing
[4:10] those who persecute you praying for
[4:12] those who despitefully use you and
[4:15] lending with no hope of repayment Jesus
[4:18] says these all yield a great reward
[4:20] along with the title being called the
[4:23] children of the highest
[4:25] the next works that are rewarded are
[4:27] providing a Christian's physical
[4:29] Necessities so this is an overlap and
[4:32] Paul says it yields a Heavenly reward
[4:34] Upon A giver's account according to
[4:36] Galatians 6 verse 10 and Philippians 4
[4:39] verses 15 through 18.
[4:42] in the last act of worship is a general
[4:45] overcoming of sin during any of the
[4:47] seven Church ages
[4:49] and then the Bible says if you overcome
[4:52] in one Church age you inherit all the
[4:54] rewards of the other six Church ages and
[4:58] these rewards are eating the Tree of
[5:00] Life escaping the second death eating
[5:03] the hidden Manna a white stone with a
[5:05] new name Within
[5:07] power to rule over Nations the Morning
[5:10] Star White raiment having your name
[5:13] remain in the Book of Life
[5:14] being a pillar in the temple of God
[5:16] having Jesus's new name
[5:19] having God's new name
[5:21] and the new Jerusalem's name written
[5:24] upon the believer and lastly sitting
[5:28] with Jesus in his throne
[5:32] in closing friends I hope this video was
[5:34] a blessing one of the Saints in the
[5:35] church really enjoyed this list when I
[5:37] preached it last Sunday so I thought I
[5:39] would just share a short video about it
[5:41] and hopefully it'll bless many more
[5:43] Christians by the grace of God I'm
[5:45] reminded of the song when the roles
[5:46] Called Up Yonder I'll be there one of
[5:48] the verses says let us labor for the
[5:50] master from the Dawn Till Setting Sun
[5:53] let us talk of all his wondrous love and
[5:55] care then when all of life is over and
[5:58] our work on Earth is done and the roles
[6:00] Called Up Yonder I'll be there
[6:02] friends each one of us have a work to do
[6:04] on this Earth but all of these 25 plus
[6:07] acts of worship are available to each
[6:09] one of us all of us have the equal
[6:11] opportunity to lay up Treasures in
[6:13] Heaven and as I mentioned the sermon the
[6:16] fact that all these acts are equal
[6:18] opportunity acts of worship shows the
[6:22] Fulfillment of the parable of the pounds
[6:24] in Luke chapter 19.
[6:26] in the parable each servant was given an
[6:28] equal amount of money
[6:30] and hear all these acts are available to
[6:33] each and every person it doesn't matter
[6:35] your age your gender or any other
[6:38] attribute all of us can serve God
[6:40] willingly and store up Treasures in
[6:42] Heaven For the Glory of our Lord Jesus
[6:44] Christ remember the Bible says in John
[6:46] 15 that the father is glorified much
[6:49] when we bear much fruit and of course
[6:52] our motivation is our love for the Lord
[6:54] Jesus Christ
[6:55] if you have any questions concerns or
[6:57] testimonies about this video please

[7:01] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[7:03] the desire of your heart
