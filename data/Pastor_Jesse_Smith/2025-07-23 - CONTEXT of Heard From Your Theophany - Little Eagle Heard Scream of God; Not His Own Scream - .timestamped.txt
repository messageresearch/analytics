[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] You have then been formed into the
[0:06] living image of the living God. You
[0:09] heard from your theophony. If this
[0:11] earthly body be dissolved, we have one
[0:14] waiting.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; He hears that true rain scream of God.
[0:18] Nothing can keep him from it.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:23] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:25] this video is to do a fourth recording
[0:28] on the topic of hearing from your
[0:30] theophony. The focus of this video will
[0:33] be looking at the context in which God's
[0:36] prophet brother William Mariam Brandham
[0:38] spoke about hearing from your theophony
[0:40] in the sermon who is this mazdc 1965.
[0:43] The inspiration for this video came from
[0:44] a precious brother named brother Alex.
[0:47] So you know who you are precious
[0:48] brother. Thank you for sharing this
[0:50] profound yet simple and humble thought
[0:52] by the grace of God. And friends, this
[0:54] video is not made with a smart alec type
[0:57] of attitude. I know some people
[0:59] disagreed on this series so far. Some
[1:03] people still believe you can hear from
[1:04] your theophony. And to me, that's fine.
[1:06] This is a minor topic. This is not a
[1:08] major topic such as salvation or the
[1:11] blood of Jesus Christ or the baptism of
[1:13] the Holy Ghost. This video is made with
[1:15] humility and just a love for the truth
[1:18] because I just humbly believe in my own
[1:19] opinion that this thought from brother
[1:22] Alex helps us better understand this
[1:24] subject by the grace of God. Remember
[1:26] friends with this topic of hearing from
[1:28] your theophony I don't see any scripture
[1:31] that teaches it and the illustration
[1:34] that brother Brandham used in context of
[1:36] this quote about the little eagle. Even
[1:39] the illustration doesn't teach this.
[1:42] There is not a single sermon on this
[1:45] subject and there is no thus sayith the
[1:47] Lord statement on this subject. So, as
[1:50] I've said before, if I don't understand
[1:51] something or I'm not fully sure about
[1:53] something, I just set it up on the shelf
[1:55] and then God will reveal it in due time.
[1:57] I still have the same stance that I have
[1:58] before. I think we hear from God's
[2:00] theophony, not our own theophony by the
[2:03] grace of God. I was even thinking, you
[2:04] know, we've sang that song, My
[2:06] Theophony, I Hear It Calling Me, over
[2:09] the years, but I've changed the lyrics
[2:11] to God's Theophony, I hear it calling
[2:14] me. We sang it a few weeks ago, and I
[2:16] even sang it the wrong way just out of
[2:18] habit. So, God knows my heart. God knows
[2:21] I just want to be obedient. I just want
[2:23] to obey the word of God. I just want all
[2:25] my songs to glorify God and to be
[2:27] biblically accurate by the grace of God.
[2:29] I think I'll share these two quotes from
[2:30] God's prophet, brother Brandham, before
[2:32] we get started here. In the first quote,
[2:34] 1954, looking for Jesus, brother Ram
[2:37] says, "The Bible is the foundation of
[2:39] all Christianom. Anything outside that
[2:42] is untrue. It has to be based upon thus
[2:45] sayeth the Lord."
[2:47] &gt;&gt; Now, the ministers usually here is the
[2:51] basic and foundation of all Christianom.
[2:53] It lays right here in the Bible.
[2:55] Anything outside of that is untrue.
[2:58] That's right. It has to be based on thus
[3:00] sayaith the Lord.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; So regarding hearing from your
[3:03] theophony, if I can't see it in the
[3:06] Bible, if it's not specifically taught
[3:08] in scripture, then to me, I'm going to
[3:11] leave it alone by God's grace. I'm just
[3:12] going to stay with what's in the
[3:14] scripture because the scripture is thus
[3:15] sayith the Lord. Brother Ram repeated a
[3:18] similar thought in the spoken word is
[3:19] original seed. March 18th, 1962.
[3:23] Brother Bram said, "That's the reason I
[3:24] believe in divine healing. That's the
[3:25] reason I believe in visions. That's the
[3:27] reason I believe in angels. That's the
[3:28] reason I believe in this message is
[3:30] because it comes from the word of God.
[3:32] And anything outside the word of God, I
[3:34] don't believe it. It could be so, but
[3:37] still, I'll just stay with what God said
[3:39] and then be sure that I'm right. Now,
[3:42] God can do what he wants to do. He's
[3:43] God. But as long as I stay with his
[3:45] word, then I know that's all right. I
[3:47] believe that.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; That's the reason I believe in divine
[3:50] healing. That's the reason I believe in
[3:52] visions. That's the reason I believe in
[3:55] angels.
[3:56] That's the reason I believe in this
[3:58] message is because it comes from the
[4:01] word of God. And anything outside the
[4:04] word of God, I don't believe it. It
[4:06] could be so, but still, I'll just stay
[4:08] with what God said and then be sure that
[4:09] I'm right. Now, God can do what he wants
[4:12] to, he's God. But as long as I stay with
[4:14] his word, and I know that's all right. I
[4:17] believe that. So these quotes show
[4:19] brother Ram's emphasis on using just
[4:22] scripture scripture alone solos scriptor
[4:25] as it was said in the reformation by
[4:28] scripture alone it's so important to be
[4:30] solos scriptor because of the warnings
[4:32] about adding or taking away from the
[4:33] scripture in proverbs 35 and 6 and
[4:35] revelation 22:18-19
[4:37] and also we're born again of the word of
[4:39] god the bible says in 1 Peter 1 verse 23
[4:42] the incorruptible seed the word of god
[4:46] I'll briefly review parts one two and
[4:47] Three. In part one, we defined the three
[4:50] bodies, terrestrial, celestial, and
[4:52] glorified. The theophony is the
[4:54] celestial body. And we looked at the
[4:57] order of manifestation that we all come
[4:58] in from the mind of God. Jesus's
[5:01] manifestation was different than our
[5:03] manifestation.
[5:05] In part two, we showed a little bit of
[5:07] the context of Bill Ram's quote on
[5:09] hearing from your theophony. The
[5:11] scripture he used in context was 2
[5:12] Corinthians 5:1. Now, in this Bible
[5:15] verse, Paul doesn't say anything about
[5:17] hearing from his theophony or building.
[5:19] It just shows Paul's longing for that
[5:21] body or that building. And then we
[5:23] showed how Jesus and King Saul heard
[5:25] from other theophanes, but the Bible
[5:28] does not record that they heard from
[5:29] their own theophony. And then in part
[5:31] three, we looked at possible scriptures
[5:33] of hearing from one's theophony.
[5:34] Although I didn't agree with them, I
[5:36] wanted to be respectful and show how
[5:38] other people use these scriptures to
[5:40] teach you hear from your theophony. The
[5:42] closest one was Revelation 5 where John
[5:44] heard from one of the 24 elders in
[5:46] heaven. Of course, he was one of them,
[5:48] but it's not specifically said that he
[5:49] heard from his own theophony. So, we
[5:51] don't want to add to that. We never want
[5:53] to add to the scripture, but I think
[5:54] that's the closest verse where it's
[5:56] possible that one person heard from
[5:58] their theophony. That would have been
[6:00] St. John. But again, it's not conclusive
[6:02] to me. And we don't have two or three
[6:04] witnesses as the Bible tells us. So,
[6:06] with part four, let's look at the
[6:08] context a little closer here. So when I
[6:10] was messaging with his brother Alex, he
[6:13] said to me, it's kind of simple and I'm
[6:14] just paraphrasing his words here. Now
[6:16] the context defined by the dictionary is
[6:20] the circumstances that form the setting
[6:22] for an event, a statement or idea and in
[6:25] the terms of which it can be fully
[6:26] understood and assessed. It's what is
[6:29] written or spoken immediately before and
[6:32] after something.
[6:35] So we need to look at when brother Ram
[6:36] said heard from your theophony. Look at
[6:38] what he said before and look at what he
[6:40] said after. That's the context. So the
[6:42] context directly before that statement
[6:44] heard from your theophony in paragraph
[6:46] 79 of who is this MKZDC? Now I'm using
[6:49] the voice of God app the table app. So
[6:53] your paragraph numbers might be
[6:54] different from mine. Brother Brandham in
[6:56] paragraph 79 quotes 2 Corinthians 5:1.
[6:59] And brother Ram said we have bypassed
[7:01] that speaking of our theophony. But
[7:03] brother Ram said Jesus went straight
[7:05] into his theophony from the mind of God.
[7:08] And then brother Ram goes into the
[7:09] little eagle story. It's the little
[7:11] eagle hatched out from under a hen.
[7:14] And this is taught in paragraphs 81
[7:16] through 87.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; But one day his mammy flew over and she
[7:22] screamed.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; He recognized it.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; That sounded right.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; Why was the eagle to begin with? Yeah.
[7:32] Amen.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; That's the way it is with the gospel of
[7:34] the word, the power of Jesus Christ.
[7:37] When a man
[7:39] has been predestinated to eternal life,
[7:42] he hears that true rain scream of God,
[7:45] nothing can keep him from it.
[7:47] &gt;&gt; And this is what brother Alex pointed
[7:49] out here. He said, "Did the little eagle
[7:52] hear from his own theophony or his
[7:54] mother's theophony?" We'd say, so in the
[7:57] story, he did not hear from his own
[7:58] theophony. He heard from his mother's
[8:00] theophony.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; He hears that true rain scream of God.
[8:04] Nothing can keep him from it.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; And that works scriptural that we hear
[8:08] from the Holy Spirit or we hear from
[8:10] God's theophony. The little eagle did
[8:13] not hear from his own theophony. And
[8:15] then in paragraph 88 is the actual
[8:17] quote. Brother Ram said, "You heard from
[8:19] your theophony."
[8:21] Now the context immediately after
[8:24] paragraph 88 is paragraphs 89-92.
[8:28] And brother Ram said, "Let's look at
[8:29] some other eagles." So the context again
[8:31] is eagles or believers who had
[8:34] interactions with theophones. Remember
[8:36] the first eagle was the Lord Jesus, the
[8:39] son of God. He went into theophony or
[8:42] the spirit form, the logos. And now
[8:45] brother gives us three more examples of
[8:47] eagles who've heard from a theophony. It
[8:50] was Moses, Elijah, and Samuel. In
[8:53] paragraph 89, brother Ram talks about
[8:54] Moses and Elijah. how they came down in
[8:57] their theophanes and talked to Jesus on
[8:59] Mount Transfiguration. So notice Moses
[9:02] and Elijah were in their theophanes.
[9:04] They did not hear from their own
[9:05] theophanes. They were giving
[9:06] communication about Jesus's decease or
[9:09] his death on the cross to the Lord
[9:11] Jesus. Then in paragraphs 90, 91,92,
[9:14] brother Ram tells the story of Samuel
[9:16] the prophet. He died and then King Saul
[9:18] used the witch of Endor to call him
[9:20] back. And brother Ram said he came up in
[9:22] his prophet garments or his mantle.
[9:25] Brother Ram said he was still a prophet
[9:27] there in his theophony. And if you go
[9:29] back and listen to the context of this
[9:31] quote, these paragraphs 79 down to 92,
[9:34] brother Ram never said that Jesus or the
[9:37] eagle or Moses or Elijah or Samuel heard
[9:40] from their own theophanes. So this is my
[9:43] thought. Brother Ram just said maybe the
[9:44] wrong word. Instead of saying you've
[9:47] heard from God's theophony, Brother Ram
[9:49] said the wrong words and said you've
[9:51] heard from your theophony. Because all
[9:53] the context shows people going into
[9:56] their theophony, but the context never
[9:58] shows someone hearing from their own
[10:00] theophony. So again friends, the context
[10:03] is so important. I'll use another
[10:04] example of how the context is super
[10:07] important. Uh from things that are to be
[10:09] 1965
[10:11] December 5th, brother Ram was speaking
[10:13] about how people can have the Holy Ghost
[10:15] anointing them but still be lost.
[10:17] Brother Ram said, "You say well I
[10:20] prophesy. So did Caiaphas. So did Balum.
[10:22] That has nothing. I got the baptism of
[10:25] the Holy Spirit. That still has nothing
[10:27] to do with it. That's just only a
[10:28] temporal gift for you. Now, I'm going to
[10:31] tell a story about a minister's meeting
[10:33] I attended probably around 2010, maybe
[10:36] before, maybe a little after. And in
[10:38] that meeting, a minister brought up that
[10:39] quote, "Only a temporal gift for you."
[10:43] And this minister went on for a couple
[10:44] minutes just giving all of his different
[10:46] guesses about what that meant. and it
[10:49] just brought a little bit of confusion
[10:50] to the minister's meeting. Now, it was
[10:51] okay, but it's just a little
[10:53] uncomfortable. At that time, I didn't
[10:55] know the answer or the explanation to
[10:57] this quote. So, I went home and began
[10:59] studying that quote. And sadly, this
[11:01] minister has since left the message. But
[11:04] when I went and studied it, I looked at
[11:05] the context. I want you to see the very
[11:07] first sentence after brother Ram said,
[11:10] "Temporal gift gives the meaning of what
[11:13] brother Brandham was talking about."
[11:14] Brother Ram said, quote, "The real gift
[11:17] is your soul down in there. See, that
[11:19] was born of God, and that controls the
[11:21] whole thing to the word of God and the
[11:23] will of God." End quote.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; I got the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[11:27] That still has nothing to do with it.
[11:30] That's just only a temporal gift for
[11:32] you. The real gift is your soul down in
[11:34] there. See? Amen.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; That was born of God. And that controls
[11:38] the whole thing to the word of God and
[11:40] the will of God.
[11:42] So this is a great example of confusion
[11:45] can be taken away if you just keep
[11:47] reading. In this case, look at the words
[11:50] and the context after the difficult
[11:52] phrase or the unfamiliar phrase that you
[11:55] don't understand. So what did brother
[11:56] Brandon mean by a temporal gift? He
[11:58] meant the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[12:00] the human mind or spirit because he's
[12:02] talking about people that were lost but
[12:05] yet had the anointing. Caiaphas and
[12:06] Balum, they both had gifts to prophesy.
[12:09] So the spirit of God filled their minds
[12:12] for a very short time and then left. So
[12:15] they had the filling or they got the
[12:16] anointing in their mind, their spirit,
[12:18] but it left. Brother said, "The real
[12:21] gift, the eternal gift is down in the
[12:22] soul." In other words, we'll have the
[12:24] Holy Ghost in our soul. We'll be sealed
[12:26] unto the day of our redemption, and our
[12:28] soul will always have the baptism of the
[12:30] Holy Ghost. But see, the anointing can
[12:32] come in the mind, but then leave the
[12:34] mind. That's why David cried out, "Take
[12:36] not thy holy spirit from me." In Psalm
[12:39] 51, he was speaking of the human mind.
[12:41] So all of the conjecture, all the
[12:44] confusion, all the guesses could have
[12:46] been done away with at that minister's
[12:48] meeting had we just read the next
[12:49] sentence. And I'm not blasting that
[12:51] minister at all. I'm just saying I
[12:53] didn't know the answer either, and God
[12:55] didn't reveal it to me till later when I
[12:56] went home and studied it for myself. But
[12:58] it's a good lesson, a good reminder
[13:00] about the context of a quote by the
[13:02] grace of God. In closing, friends, hope
[13:05] this video was a blessing by the grace
[13:06] of God. Again, I'm not trying to be a
[13:08] smart elk or anything like that. I'm
[13:10] just sharing this helpful truth about
[13:12] context from this quote from who is this
[13:14] Melzdc. Whether someone believes you
[13:16] hear from your theophony or not, it
[13:18] doesn't matter. I think everybody
[13:20] believes you have to hear from the Holy
[13:21] Ghost. Because Jesus says in Revelation
[13:24] 2 and 3, let he that hath an ear hear
[13:27] what the spirit saith unto the churches.
[13:30] So whether someone believes the Holy
[13:31] Spirit is anointing your theophony to
[13:33] talk to you or if it's just the Holy
[13:34] Ghost himself coming to talk to you, we
[13:37] all want to hear what the spirit is
[13:39] saying to the churches and that we are
[13:41] by the grace of God as we repent of our
[13:43] sins daily. We are empowered by the Holy
[13:45] Ghost to speak the word of God, to live
[13:47] the word of God. I think we can all
[13:49] agree we want to hear what the spirit is
[13:51] saying to the church today. Of course,
[13:53] we know what the spirit is saying.
[13:54] Revelation 22:17 is saying, "Come drink
[13:57] of the waters of life freely." The
[13:58] spirit is saying be on fire. Don't be
[14:00] lukewarm. Don't be cold. The spirit is
[14:02] saying rise. Trim your lamps. Make
[14:04] yourself ready. Behold the bridegroom
[14:06] cometh. So let's make ourselves ready
[14:08] continually by the grace of God in love
[14:10] and humility. You know, a precious
[14:12] brother shared a quote with me where
[14:13] brother Ram said, "God lives, dwells,
[14:15] works in humility, never any other way."
[14:18] It's a beautiful quote from the third
[14:20] seal. It's a great reminder for us to
[14:22] always be humble. If we're not sure
[14:24] about something, let's say, well, I
[14:26] could be wrong. And that's what I'm
[14:27] saying in this video series. I could be
[14:28] wrong. This is just my humble opinion.
[14:30] Let's listen to this beautiful quote
[14:31] from God's prophet.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; God lives, dwells, works in humility.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; Never any other way.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God for the foundation of all
[14:45] Christianom, the Holy Bible. Praise God.
[14:48] We believe this message because it comes
[14:51] from the word of God.
[14:53] If you have any questions, concerns or
[14:54] testimonies about this video, please
[14:56] contact me.
[14:58] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[15:01] the desire of your heart.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[15:06] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[15:08] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[15:11] good news that Jesus raised from the
[15:13] dead, living among man today, his
[15:15] church. The same Jesus that was
[15:18] yesterday will be today and forever.
[15:22] is never fails.
