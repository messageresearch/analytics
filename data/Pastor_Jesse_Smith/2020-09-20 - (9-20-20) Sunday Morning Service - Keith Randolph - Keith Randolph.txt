me to christ but his love has captured my soul i'm a prisoner i will i see no way [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] nice [Music] and i've i've been through the heat and the cold i passed out on airplanes i've passed out many times morning at home and i've been i've had malaria in africa and i've been sick in the philippines more than once stopped in more than one hospital trying to get help i've had uh what do you call that amoeba i've had all that and and when time comes to go i can't stop i must go and that's and uh when we get to the end of this message i'm going to let you know why i am angry okay would you stand with me this morning and uh we'd just like to pray first before we open to our scripture we'll be reading first of all in proverbs chapter 29 and verse 18. and it'll take a while to get to my text but it's there we'll get there and i'm going to read some things i think will be very interesting to you and eye-opening i do believe this heavenly father now as we are opening your word the pages of your word lord we're asking you to speak to us through your word lord we know this is jesus christ in printed form and lord we rely on that printed word but we need the holy ghost to make that word come alive to our hearts and lord i pray this morning that you would give me a clear utterance of speech and just one more time as i report to duty lord that you would hide me behind the cross of calvary give me the right words to speak this morning for we ask it in jesus christ's name amen before we even open the scripture before i read the script and say the things i'm going to say this morning i want you to know we have the devil's answer yes i'm going to be standing for a moment before i read this we have the devil's answer yes and when jesus was on the mount being tempted when satan came at him you know what he did each time he he didn't use supernatural powers he said it is written it is written it is written in this written bible will defeat the devil anywhere anytime and wherever it is we have the devil's answer right here amen amen amen now in proverbs chapter 29 to get started where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he now you may be seated may god add his blessings to the reading of his word the title of this message this morning is perplexity in the valley of vision we'll get to our text in a little while but we want to start here because we see the scripture says where there is no vision the people perish a vision is a prophecy or divine communication able to perceive the past present and the future what it it is god's intelligence amen you know it's god's intelligence that causes in the fall it's going to be long that that that the trees will uh god's great funeral service the trees will turn and fall off and the sack will go down in the roof god's intelligence or didn't the tree would die in the little insects everything has an intelligence has a spirit and it's god's intelligence that does this and it's god's intelligence that's leading the bride of jesus christ in this hour amen now now see as it was in the days of samuel there was no open vision and with that the people perish we must have a visa and the vision comes to the prophets it's the word of the lord that's spoken to them amen you know don't want to miss anything here so we'll just go on now think about this i posted this on facebook it's i think it's so beautiful did you know the only the only bird that'll fly on the back of an eagle is a crow you can find pictures of a crow flying on the back but you know the eagle does not get mad the eagle don't try to shake him off the eagle just flies and higher and higher where the crow has no oxygen and he just falls amen so the bible says be angry and sin not amen don't let the rat don't let the don't let it uh the sun go down on your wrath and never give place to the devil so yeah i'm gonna tell you i am angry this morning i'm angry at the devil and what is going on you know that's you know brother branham said so many hard to live a christian life now i i'm gonna take a while this morning you bear with me because i got things to say it's a sad sight one of the saddest i've ever seen but i see a sight in phoenix the world over there's a mosaic site that i see men and women who were born to be sons and daughters of god and who are caged by the devil and to see them walking the streets and lust and passion caged in by the devil when really they would be free sons and daughters brother venom talk about those he saw those eagles caged up and it was a sad sight that was in the cincinnati zoo i and i've been to the cincinnati zoo probably not long after he said that and i saw those same eagles that were they were caged up in that cage which was meant to fly but they was caged and they could not fly so an eagle could fly higher than any bird there is there's no bird can climb where the eagle flies and neither was any man whether he was a teacher evangelist patcher who could climb to the spot where the profits went for they went up higher you go the further you can see some things i'm going to put off this side because i got my notes mixed up a little bit because i added two took away and added two this morning and last night and so you bear with me and we're going to get to something that's very interesting something that was written 300 years ago all right we're going to get there now also now now listen without a vision that people perish you take the word perish in the hebrew it's pera p-a-r-i you know what that means people don't perish without a leader evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving in being deceived is to lead act as the leader to loosen all the restraints through neglect that's why the bible said how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation neglect i believe as the bride of jesus christ where i go everywhere there is a spirit of neglect it's so common anymore we're so happy in our find home soon and very soon that will end because we're going to find out we're going to give types to tell you exactly in in a little bit now you know matthew 7 13 says enter you in at the straight gate you know what the s-t-r-a-i-t is a waterway it's not straight like a straight line straight there is a waterway what is that waterway right here straight is the gate for why is the gate and broad is the way that lead it to destruction and many be that go in now another thing the word uh parish also means to be found naked the laodicean church age rich i was told my wife we was going down the street this is this is outstanding i remember as a little boy i probably won about nine or ten my dad was i i was raised in the southern baptist church and my dad mowed the grass and he start up that big lawnmower and he had sent me on that lawnmower and i'd blow that grass up i won about 10 years old afterwards he gave me enough money to cut up the side street to what they called the dairy aisle and i'd get me a fritos and an ice cream cone but i had to walk through the catholic church big building but we were going down the street looking at some of these catholic church out in the country they're very small not much but you look at the big protestant churches the charismatic they're huge baptists they're huge they've got something for everybody they got for the door four seas they probably even got them for the gays and everything else now they've got everything blind naked rich and they don't even know it that's a sad sons should been sons and daughters of god but they're blinded by religion and religion is a covering [Music] i'm not just talking in the protestant churches right i'm talking in so-called message churches on if you know what i have experienced in my travels and what i've seen and what i heard i'd get more revelation in disneyland but what i heard people say is insanity yes it is yes now bible says in hebrews 4 12 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do you can't hide amen you can't hide from god you must not even try it it won't work right see we're at the end time we've got the answer if we got the answer why don't we share the answer god speaks his word and he cannot take his word back god's word is forever settled in heaven and it's an absolute and absolute bible an absolute word and god cannot take his word back i am god and i change god amen i feel like preaching this morning amen i think the preacher's here amen amen amen see his word is perfect his word is eternal amen all this was at the beginning he starts his attributes yes expressing themselves in the world today how's he's expressing his word he's expressing his work through you and me that's how he expresses it we got to be careful how we act we got to be careful how we speak to our neighbor how we speak to people that's lost you know i found out this i've had it happen in the past i i can't bring about my memory completely you know you can be you can be stranded by the side of the road and cars passing you up and nice clean-cut people and all of a sudden there'll be somebody stopping tattoos all over their arms at the top to help you take you for a ride to the gas station they help you change your time you can't go by the outward experience because there's something on the inward you don't know what happened mama pop and papa used to pray you know brother random said one time he talked about maybe old mama she's going on and she looks over the banister and she sees that son and daughter given to her do you know they can look over the minister yeah yes brother bannon said i hope hope can look over the banister and see billy paul yes every once will they get a view what's going on yes sir hey man we're getting there amen we're gonna get to my text we're gonna read our text we've got quite a bit of reading to do but uh there's only one he provided place and worship bless jesus christ amen see brother brahm says i feel like we're going through a time of great perplexity yes the word perplexing means confusion god is not the author of confusion but peace in the churches of god we've gone through it haven't we wearing that mask around we're going to get to that little while i got you know i've gotta oh it get me in trouble i say the things i want to say and you might not agree but it's the truth anyhow we're gonna wait do we get to sennacherib in a little while and king hezekiah we're going to get there in a few minutes distress a time of distress between nations all kinds of things happen perplexity of times the sun and the moon earthquakes for perplexing a time of confusion when this confusion brings us the bible said god would god would god would send a strong delusion that they would believe because they loved not the love they had lost the love of the truth god would send the delusion he didn't say the devil he said god will send a delusion all right yes sir see comes out those man said a great white cat comes and it's a great uh your brother ram told us the thing about the ship on the sea and the waves are going over and waves are going that way but when they drop the anchor that anchor goes down deep no matter how many of the waves comes over the waves come over that because they've got an anchor and that anchor stabilizes them it don't matter how old you are a young man old man old man like me that anchor stabilizes it stabilizes me in the philippines or in africa or pakistan when i was in pakistan yes it stabilizes me amen when i almost one time one time it was dark i'm having a meeting in sabongan mountain province a crusade outside and i began to walk over i'm going to tell you what i was trying to find in the dark place but i walked over and her brother come running at me and grab my arm and yank me back one more step i wouldn't be here today i've been i've been up to gold creek mountain one time i i'm gonna tell some stories too you're going to be here for a while amen amen go creek i've been to gold creek more than once and i come to the place they're going to come down to see me i'm not going up to gold creek no more because the first time i was in gold creek i was going down and i was going down an abandoned gold quarry in the philippines and up in the mountains and and we got out to walking and i said where's the church up top of that mountain there ain't no road to get up there you had to walk up that and the first time i got up there my pa my traveling companion brother dana took me the wrong path and i was climbing all fours to get up there and i've been up there more than once there's been people pass out growing up i never did pass out and breathe awful hard and and and i've been up there more than once and i've seen the glory i've had termites flying in my ear and everything else but i've seen the glory of god up on the mountain the god of the mountain and i see the god in the valley and i've seen god move in mysterious ways i've been on the one time i i gotta preach one more story amen i was in in the low place in the valley and bawangan i believe it was between two mountains back before we had even our own transportation we had to get up when it was dark to get the first ride out and i went out and i looked up that mountain and there was this light going out into three going out into three one two three one two three one two three and it would go down one two three one two three one two three and i watched and i watched and i watched i said brothers what is it he said it's a devil we've been up there and we can't find it so i don't want to go up there you know god in three persons blessed trinity and i preached about the sanctuary of god but when we got on that bus going our next journey the brother said there it is there was an eagle flying with our blood amen i've been there and i i i've got to get to this i've got i've i i've got to watch it lord help me to get to where i'm going you know see you know the bible says behold my servant whom i've shown my beloved whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit upon him and he shall show judgment to the gentiles he is a life-giver and also a judge a separation it's separating time amen it's like joshua down in jericho i said you know you know the new testament meaning of jericho was an alluring fragrance but the old testament means many moons jericho they had all kinds of religion all kinds of gods that's about the way we got today all kinds of gods right you know but see but joshua joshua means jehovah's savior do you know that look it up amen amen you know like jesus joshua the name of our lord jehovah savior joshua was also the destroying angel buffett said that and jericho was right in line for judgment every nation in the world today is a line of god's judgment amen i can't people say well it's the united states i know that you know it's every nation every nation yes every nation is line of judgment and that's a little rehab harlot you know can you imagine she entertained those spies and kept them and she only had one plea when they left that her house would be saved and she put that little line outside that scarlet line that thread and when they when the destroying angel comes and he'll see that and he'll pass over your get everybody you can into that house you know and she was saved she had to be saved you know that it was god's predestinative plan because through that line would come jesus christ amen through that life would come jesus christ that was god's predestinated plan [Music] lord help me things coming on my mind i can't stop i can't stop talk about ruth yes a gentile yes i don't know what color hair she had but i got a feeling it might have been blonde or brown just like rehab the heart that time that i was uh my wife always tell me you've got a loud voice i can hear you on the other side of the room and i was at the airport telling these brothers sitting around the wall what i had been doing in the philippines and they was listening and i went to the restroom and when i come out there was a young man i was young then too but he was still younger than me staring me right in the face he said i heard you speaking he said i am a newly converted to christianity jew i said he said i know you're looking at my hair here's what color of mine i know you're looking at me but i can tell you the names of my fathers and where they came in in new york and i've been there where they come in in new york and i can tell you all about it later i thought rahab gentile ruth a gentile yes yes and you know god has a way i guess i'd probably given away every book that i had but i had one book in my briefcase and i gave that converted jew 70 weeks of daniel i'm expecting to see him i'm expecting to see a brain scientist i'm expecting to see a buddhist priest i'm i'm expecting to see envoys of the preach of the pope i'm expecting to see followers of amy said well mcpherson i'm expecting to see a lot that i flew on the plane with my ministry just not in the philippines it's whoever i was with on an airplane amen pay me now the token that what was out from under the token would perish all that was under would live the same oath is today amen i will not let them perish with them what is the token the true baptism of the holy ghost the seal of god the mark of god grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed till the day of redemption hey man now i'm gonna get there in a minute before i wear myself out you know i was feeling pretty bad about a month ago i was having trouble breathing and that's why i went to the doctor and he found that seven millimeter nodule on my lung and he said don't worry about it and my brother frank ward we worked together and asbestos for years and he said i that's what worried him wasn't from smoking but i worked in asbestos for years but the doctor said don't worry about it so he sent me the hospital for that nuclear uh stress test and got moved even in that and sister sherian in mansfield this is how bad it was she was she was saying what am i going to do if he passes out in the pulpit the way i was breathing she's a registered nurse and what was she going to do well i ain't got no problem now god's touched me again i've been dead and come back to life and i'm still here i'm still finished i'm going to tell you why i'm angry in a minute see there's a little minority that believes the word i believe in a bride's revival i believe in a third pole ministry i believe the third call was a revelation of the seven seals as the prophet said but i believe there's a revival and i've received that message in my heart amen as the prophet said we know what defending okay we know what the vindication is yeah and we know what the third pull is yeah now this is not exactly i'm just my memory and he said i believe it'll lay dormant foresee you know what dormant is it's alive but it come but it's been like something's got to happen to manifest come out yes it'll lay dormant for a season until that great persecution comes and it'll be manifested perfectly like those five times i ain't looking for brother branham to come back in the return ministry i believe that ministry is for the bride and the prophet said that the bride of jesus christ will will manifest everything that was written about her in the new testament amen jesus christ fulfilled the old testament the bride will fulfill the new testament hallelujah i thank god i'm a part of it amen we are in the bright age they're going homey no more the word of noah wesley luther or any of them but we are in the bright age that message was for you for me wasn't necessarily for brother branham it was for you and for me he brought it to me eleazar when abraham is an eliaser to get a bride for isaac lord it wasn't for him one for elias he was just a messenger boy and what he did he went was it she just said yes i'll go and when they went back all along on the way back he told her all about it yeah he was out in the field and she went to meet him yes and he took her into his mother's house and they became one that's right and one of these days we're going to meet in the field in the clouds amen the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and the trump of god shall sign sound and the dead in christ shall rise first and we who are alive and remaining shall be caught up together to meet in the near brother man who said they'll be wave after wave after wave and we'll be caught up but i believe there's going to be a reunion first here on earth there's a little system i'm gonna get to in a minute hold on there's we're supposed to help the widows indeed yes sir i try to help in the philippines even when i'm out there sending money yes sir there's a brother but i called him my adopted son brother rodol mandeling i love that brother we were together so many times i thought he was healthy i tried to get him married many times and it never worked out i was trying to be eliaser but he knew better because the one i tried to fix him up she backslid another one did this finally found a little girl and she's probably about 10 15 years younger people will look down upon that and every time i would go back for a trip he'd have another child and go back there's another one go back to another one another i think they had five kids well he passed away about a year ago it shot me so i tried to help me and my wife trying to help this widow yes sister priesthood mandolin and i don't know it might have been brother rhoda she was missing brother rodell posted his picture and she was so sad she can't get over it yet i just sent her this message i said one of these days sister prissy gonna be a young man walk up to your front door young young and that'll be young brother rodell just wait hold on it won't be long hold on it won't be long hold on hold on to the horns in the officer it won't be long big man amen you know i'm getting to it i got plenty time yes i'll probably just start till 11 30. now listen you know you know in the valley i'm talking about perplexity in the valley of vision yes in the valley i don't know if you've ever watched an old movie called sergeant york back in the 50s he he actually made sure that that movie was right sergeant york was the most decorated soldier at world war one he was from jamestown tennessee and my father-in-law was from jamestown tennessee and he remembers sergeant wasn't sergeant york but he remembers him and he said he was a he was a jacob he was a shyster he remembers him bringing a taped up pumpkin you know to to the fair tried to enter it in tried to win a drunkard but god saved him amen and he was up on the mountainside he was he didn't want to kill he didn't want to fight but he was drafted into the army and man was he a sharpshooter he was drafted into the army in they went to the firing range man he he didn't need no instruction old tennessee hillbilly and you know and he still didn't want to fight you know the bible page is opening up he was on the mountainside praying and the pages opened up of the bible render under the caesars what is caesar's under god what is god and he went back he told his commanding officer i don't know whether i can kill or not but he went and it told how many he killed a whole troop prisoner and they asking how could you kill that many why did you do it i said i did it to save lives yes and sometimes we have to shoot down the enemy to save lives amen amen we have to bring down the enemy but you know what he said he was on the mountain but the richest ground was in the valley so expensive i was invited for a baby dedication brother july soleyak i asked him one time was you born in july he said yes i was born in july you know i hadn't seen brother july in a long time i knew him he was related to the bulletins and i saw him on facebook all i did was say a simple words to him the right words and the next trip he was back singing he said would you come can you come and climb a few steps for my grand son's or granddaughter remember dedication and when i went you understand in baguio everything's on a hill it wasn't a few steps it was like a highway to heaven oh my goodness i'm already tired i got bad feet and got bad legs i said i can do it i climbed and climbed and climbed and climbed and climbed and just a little bit more found out we could turn the corner and there it was but they you could even win a higher you know why way up there it's cheaper than down here the lowland area is always more because it's rich it's rich in the valley scene in the valley and before we go and i'm going to read this i'm almost at my text brother brandon said we know we're here in a negative form and as long as there is a negative remember about a negative impossible there has to be a positive there cannot be a negative without a positive because it's because of the positive that makes the negative like you had a negative picture of the some object there has to be an object somewhere of it to strike the light strike the lens there couldn't be any negative so when you see that our life is here in the negative knowing that we're here in the image of some life somewhere then we know that there is a a positive somewhere that'll that the light has struck and it's reflected something here on earth and we only we are only that reflection the genuine object is somewhere amen if that isn't i'm the worst deceived man in the world i spent my life in vain but i know beyond a shadow of a doubt there it is that's why we are here gloria you know i've been i i didn't plan on it when that 2017. my wife was in the room with me and my mum it dropped down to nothing and she massaging my feet and saying keep keep keep and later i told her i couldn't feel you massaging my feet but i could hear your voice she said my eyes was wide open like that all the time i didn't pass out she said you know what i was standing next to you i was standing i was not in my body and i was seeing this great big open room and i and i heard voices as they was bringing me back pleasant voices like women and fellowship and i always thought could that have been my mother they brought me back i was almost there almost there to the positive amen well they've been said how many times that the third psalm has been misinterpreted but you hear people say though we walk through the dark valley of the shadow of death it doesn't say that at all it doesn't even say that at all though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death darks not there at all see though i walk through the valley of the shadow dark before there could be a shadow there has to be a light to reflect the shadow see what i mean so it has to be light waiting there to perfect the shadow and the only thing it is it's just a shadow and there's nobody scared of a shadow so that that's all death is to us since jesus died in our stead it is a shadow just something we pass through a little place that's all nothing can keep us from the promised land god always god promised to us jesus died for it the holy ghost accepted us sealed us into the day of redemption and we're on the road and everything's got to be all right all right i'll tell you what i am warming up too much okay amen all right now get my hanky out brother jesse asked i need water i said no i try i ain't got time to drink water but i'll tell you what i i i was preaching in a place called uh i can't even think of the name now i tried to remember back there and when i left i was going to say uh said carlos pagassi now brother rancy and when i was so hot man i drink water there sometimes because i'm so hot i'm drained and he brought up a a 7-up bottle no he brought up a mineral bottle it was a mineral bottle i thought it was mineral water big jug and i drank that whole thing so i traveled back to baguio that morning i woke up my stomach was cramping so bad i said oh lord i didn't drink anything but mineral water and that little guy he's interpreting for me and i look over i can't even see him he's so short you know but uh he tried to kill me he didn't know that the water in that mineral bottle they had drawn it from a well there where we were just at you can't drink well water you don't want to drink the water ball and i've been like i say sick many times but uh i've learned don't drink the water and even though i don't drink the water something every trip will probably get me no matter what this weak system of americans you know right right probably if i lived over there i would probably get acclimated to what it is [Music] see now all right you know the bible says and we said this ii corinthians 2 15 for we are unto god a sweet savor of christ and them that are saved and in them that perish to one a savior of death unto death and another life unto life and paul said who is sufficient for these things what is this death a life became courts even though they're still walking around zombies so to speak now turn with me to isaiah the 22nd chapter of isaiah to start with amen then we'll be looking somewhere else i thought i had it marked i'll find okay 22nd chapter of isaiah starting with verse 1. now here we're going to talk about you listen this is talking about jerusalem this valley is jerusalem not only that it is the neighboring cities of judah with your beautiful lush flowers and everything that was the valley the burden but the main thing is is jerusalem the burden of the valley of vision you know why it was called the valley of vision so much prophecy had went over it was a place a wonderful place what aileth thee now that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops see something has happened thou thou art full of stirs that stirs mean activity like going from the mall or shopping and going out to eat and not having to wear a mask and all this yeah that's right a joyous city thy slain men are not slain with a sword nor dead in battle listen to that first of all this is a prelude this versus here is a prelude to king nebuchadnezzar when he conquers israel it's a prelude just like this could be a prelude to the great tribulation right all right all thy rulers are fled together they are bound by the archers see there was no protection judah the arch they'd all judah had all ran down and some went into jerusalem and fled the cities because of fear as we're going to see in a minute yes they're fled together they are bound by the archers all that are found in thee are bound together which has fled from far therefore said i look away from me i will weep bitterly labor not to comfort me because of the swelling of the daughter of my people for it is a day of trouble and of a treading gown of perplexity by the word of god of host in the valley of vision breaking down the walls and of crying to the mountains you just hold there like i said the bible says multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision and what is that valley it's a steep narrow gorge depressing and all the rulers and multitudes roaming in confusion and the visions that came forth from that violin divine communication with god and i believe we've had a divine communication from god in this age and men are trying i can't believe some of these men that walked in the message for you are leaving the message i don't want to be in their shoes because most of them when they live leave can't keep their mouth shut if they leave their mouth shut they'd be all right but it borders on blasphemy now who's got a matthew henry commentary my computer do you yes sir you know matthew henry uh finney read it four times the fourth time down on his knees john wesley wrote a wrote on it spurgeon did but he was ahead of his time i don't normally push other people's messages than the prophet but john button was ahead of his time if you ever want to read a message the baron fig tree you ought to read that message you thought it was this very day now listen first of all the reason i like matthew henry he wrote this commentary in sev couple years 1706 1708 something like that in his commentary he talks about rome being the harlot and the pope just like martin luther many did you know in england it was once against the law to say that rome was not the heart you could be arrested it's true you can find it you can look it up you'll find it once against the law now it's all watered down because mama don't want nobody talking about mama wrong right now and they're separated children yes it's no longer calling them uh reprobates or they call our separated brethren they call them separated brethren because they're all going to come back most of them are already back even the southern baptist convention said we're going to write a dialogue what a dialogue is a bridge to come home come on back home see now listen this is quite lengthy but i want you to hear it amen not only that i like a man that walks in the light he came out of a home from the church of england he was ordained by a group of men called the church of non-conformist then he went into the presbyterian he was walking in the light but here now in the burden of the valley of vision here is that which will quite ruin it but only frighten it see it was sennacherib you know what sacrament meant sin the moon you know what the moon represents the church and that great as that eclipse when the pope went back to uh israel in the eclipse and it was dark brother venom said that lastly you'll see it was completely dark but god allowed him to put that sliver of light for us but i believe it's going back in the total of possibly total darkness but only frighten it see what are we having now people are being frightened i don't like wearing a mask i can't breathe in that mask and i'll tell you what i believe it is there's more than one people say i'll forgive me my own family doctor says that math math don't protect nothing he is a renegade to tell me and my wife that but when they laid the law down that he had to and i went in for my physical he had went on and i had one on that's right you know what it is i listened to rush limbaugh i don't know if you do but he said what it is it's control that we're all under one under like a monarchy we've got to do this and we got to do that now they're talking about it may never end in 1958 brother branham went on a hunting trip and they never even got out of the truck why they all got sick with the asian flu and 158 thousand died of i think it was of the asian few and nothing was said about it hardly at all i've walked in the philippines with the swine flu have to walk over a mat to clean my feet and different things and never got stopped but this one stopped why politic political i belie you ain't gonna like it but i'm gonna tell it i believe it was to stop donald trump i'm not a politician but my daddy was a republican and he voted one time for jimmy carter because jimmy carter was a southern baptist and after jimmy carter got elected he was so upset and one day i was at his house and he was complaining about jimmy carter and my mother screamed out but you voted for him right right now listen listen to this shanakarib was an assyrian king heathen king was going out conquering and killing and neighboring cities for he refers not to the destruction of jerusalem by nebuchadnezzar but to attempt made upon it by sennacherib which we had the prophecy it is here again prophesied up because of desolations of many of the neighboring countries as we'll read again in a little bit i'm going to finish up which were foretold in the foregoing chapters were to be brought to pass by the assyrian army see this was just the uh i have it somewhere the years maybe 70 years 60s maybe 70 80 years later nebuchadnezzar came in now let jerusalem know that when the cup is going around it will be put in her hand although it will not be her fatal cup it will be a cup of trembling here it is foretold now first of all i want you to remember ecclesiastes 9 it says the thing that has been it is shall be and that which is done is that which has already there is nothing new under the sun amen consternation the city should be upon the reproach of sennacherib's army even king oh they call it the the china virus i don't know how it spread i don't know why it's here but i do know if you didn't have a tv or if you didn't have the internet if you didn't have the news media it would go on and you would know nothing about it it would not be any serious than the common flu that kills thousand thousand people every year yes sir the media has publicized it and lied about it doctors have lied about it it is caused what that's what i am angry it shut off me from the mission field it's cut me off from the people i love right it's cuz i'm angry i'm angry at the devil be angry and sin not to let the sun come down on your ass neither give place to the devil i have not given place to the devil i'm mad at him here it is a city of great trade jerusalem people hurrying to and fro about their business a tumultuous city populist and noisy you know i enjoy a good breakfast in the hotel and you know what i went down to get my breakfast and it was all dark he said do you want a breakfast bag you want chocolate milk or white milk i said chocolate milk they gave me a breakfast bag i didn't have no eggs i didn't have no bacon i didn't have no gravy things have changed it's not the same i don't like it see where there is great trade there is great tumult he used to be a joyous reveling city things have changed what with the busy part and what with the merry part of mankind places of concourse or places of noise but what ails now yeah great concourse you can almost relate that to the airport going through now delta got nobody sitting in the middle seat i get their news all the time because i'm waiting to tell me i can fly you know the shops are acquitted there's no more walking in the streets in exchange but thou has holy gone up to the housetop bemoaned thyself in silence and solitude to secure their cells from the enemy or to look abroad and see if any of course come to the relief or which way the enemies nations motions are left both men of business and sportsmen can you imagine he said sportsman 300 years ago he said sportsman rejoice as they rejoice and for something may happen quickly which they have little to think of that will be damped to them earth and stop to their business you know ain't that hypocrisy yes i saw it on the internet where the head guy of the nfl i'm just relating what i read he was so mad as he walked some walk up the concourse to the field some didn't have their mask on and they were not uh six feet apart i said what hypocrisy they get out on the field figure no math god and they're hitting each other slobbering on each other and everything else something just ain't right see to send them to watch as a sparrow alone on the housetop but why is jerusalem in such a fright her slain men are not slain with the sword their slain was famine why for sennacherin's army have laid the country waste and destroyed the fruits of the earth for provisions must needs to be very scarce and deer in the city which would be death to many of the poor of the people who would be constrained defeat on that which is unwholesome slain with fear they were put in a fright they had not a man killed but so dishearten themselves that they seem effectively stabbed with fear is that they've been run through with a sword that's what's going on right people's joy is taken away i go to my wife sometimes to go to the grocery with her i don't even want to go because i can't stand to wear that mask i keep forgetting to wear it don't like to wear it nobody here's got one on no boy what's wrong with you all you know what it is and then all and then not only that then come all the demonstrations riot duty with martin luther martin luther king was killed i'm going to say it we got some black sisters i was in the army i got home korea and i was sent and me and my wife got married to california for the rest of my tour i was stationed at a nuclear missile base on top of chestwork mountain and during that time he was killed and i was put on riot duty i couldn't go i lived off base and received i couldn't go home i was in charge of the carbines and the ammunition and i was told give them the carbine but don't give them the ammunition and i thought my that's going to cause confusion and you know at that time i was a young guy i i i just might have been 21 at the time i'm not sure i got married uh oh i can't remember now i was 20 i think yeah you know it's an awful thing when you go to the army and mom and dad don't have to sign for you but you're 20 years old back then my mom and dad had the sign for me to get married because i was 20 years old that was so embarrassing to me i could go to vietnam or somewhere and get killed and they didn't have to sign but they had the sign for me to get married i guess they thought well guess the lawful that was more dangerous than getting killed it could have been i don't know but you know i've been married to the same wife this december will be 53 years you know and you know she she sent me a message right before i left she was getting ready to go to church and she said that the engine light came on in her van and she said i'm not gonna go and i told her she wanted to go so bad i said that's probably meant to be because you don't know there might have been an accident found out it was just a low tire but she waited so long she couldn't go see god protects his own right now see see that's why i'm mad and i didn't go i i back then back then i was young i liked i like to fight i admit i did like a fight i've told you one of my stories about getting knocked out by an off duty please and i got another scuffles too when i was a young man before i was converting i mean i like the good fight and i still like a good fight now with the devil you know it's like martin luther i'm not finished yet oh i'm going over time but we're gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna tell this and i'm gonna read the finishing up of this story and i've got a lot of other notes but we won't even read them because this is gonna be the consummation of my message always like that my daughter used to buy used books at garage sales she bought me a book one time was about martin luther and i was having trouble sleeping the devil was beating me up left and right and left and right left and right and i read it he became like a hero to me you know in the wittenberg there's an eat mark i don't know if it's still there they kept it as a memorial because luther had such a bad temper he was studying and he heard somebody eating he said the devil was eating heavens in the attic and he threw that ink up there but one time he said the devil sleeps closer to me in bed than my wife katie does and the devil gives me more torment than my wife gives me joy but he said i found a secret i say when he comes at me because he said the devil is just an exalted creature he is i found that because i i did the same thing and it worked he said i look at the devil and i say devil you know what you're in is going to be it's going to be in the lake of fire and you will cease you believe he's going to cease to exist amen and when i do that he would leave i was preaching in indiana out in the vestibule i'll try to speak in terms of mixed yes but a sister came to me crying said i should have come to the altar i should have come to the altar and she began to tell me her story about her life as a child in the home and i won't go any further but she said it's ruined my marriage i told her that's not your fault i prayed for nothing happened i told her the story about martin luther looking at the devil tell him what his end is and when i did that she was jumping up and down clapping her hands god had delivered her that same church that same church that pastor you don't know the name i'm going to tell you the city i might have told you this state i don't know i hope i didn't i was praying for people at the altar and he comes to me and he says oh if brother branham was only here i thought to myself i'm here you're here right he's not here right i'm here yes i'm here then no i didn't tell this out loud it was going through my mind my wife was there and she heard that and she was grieved and i was grieving it grieved alt for service you know you can grieve away the spirit of god you can put a damper on the spirit of god the spirit of god is timid it'll run it'll leave if you insult it yes say we got the devil's answer yes turn me to second kings verse 19. trying to find my place oh my okay all right this is what was going on about sennacherib and jerusalem and everything that's going on here was a king he didn't have the holy ghost like we have but yet he believed god and god directed him he was told by messengers what was going on he was told how coveted 19 was destroying the people i'll call seneca rib right now colvin 19. the prelude to the great tribulation but i want you to the bride won't be here for the great tribulation amen amen and here is hezekiah he had heard about judah he heard about it all what sennacherib was doing destroying the people destroying everything in it in verse 14 of second corinth second kings 19 and hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it he was reading the letters about how the neighboring cities were being infiltrated and hezekiah went up to the house of the lord and spread it out before could you imagine the boldness he spread those letters out before the lord in the house of god laid it out boldness we can have boldness come boldly before the throne of grace held by the blood of jesus christ the perfect blood of god amen and hezekiah prayed before the lord and said oh lord god of israel which dwelleth between the cherubims thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth lord bow down thine ear yes a bold isn't it yes and here oh lord open lord thine eyes and see and hear the words of sennacherib which has sent him to reproach the living god of a truth lord the kings of assyria assyria has destroyed the nations and the lands and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of men's hands wouldn't stone therefore they have destroyed them now therefore oh lord i beseech him save thou house out of thy his hand that all the kings have heard me know thou art the lord god even thou alone i love verse 20. then isaiah we read in isaiah 22. this is just the same story going on of the kings son of amos went to where god hezekiah saying thus saith the lord of israel that's what thou has prayed to me against the necra of the kingdom azir i've heard and we won't read any more he heard his prayer now i'm not praying to him the prophet would hear my prayer but we have a mediator between god and man the man christ jesus amen amen and you know what happened why can't we do that today you know what the very work of god has been stagnated have you read what's going on in california some of the churches they can't even have ser they're being they're being that evil governor there is stopping him and finding them and finding and finding him even trumps and his lawyers and then and so what did they do they took uh john mcarthur's uh lease away from the parking lot how evil can it be evil men and seducers shall wax worship deceiving and being deceived yes but you know what happened because god heard the prayer of hezekiah yes and verse 35 why can't we do this and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went out and smoked the camp of the assyrians 104 score and 5 000. that's 185 000. yes they didn't have to lift a hand because of the prayer the bonus of a king going before god amen and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead carcasses and you know what happened sennacherib the king of assyria departed went in return and dwelt in nineveh and it came to pass as he was worshiping the house of nisrad the god and amalek with i can pronounce like his son smote him with his sword his son smoke his own son killed him and one of his sons became king be sure your sins will find you right now amen and also that's why i am mad i am mad i couldn't believe what's going on it's worldwide it's a worldwide control and i'm going to tell you this you may think i am crazy i like martin luther said he said he believed every evil thing that happens comes from rome from the antichrist and from the prophecy the greatest spy system is the jesuit order of the roman catholic church yes that killed abraham lincoln yes sir what it is we're living in that hour you better know where you stand with god young or old repent of all your sins and the holy ghost will enter amen amen i think the problem is people come to the message without repentance they come out because of some great revelation right maybe something you go well oh it sounds like a mormon i like that mormon stuff i like that you know and everything that's what it is without a true genuine pentecostal blessing of the holy ghost i want you to know i'm going to simply tell you this i'm a baptist nazarene pentecostal that's been baptized with the holy ghost amen and it believes the full word of god the message of the owl hey man amen when i when i first came in the message i remember one time i had been i've been i i had just come in i've been in for a while i was on third shift you know and i had my uh my third shift you can get by with anything you know i wasn't allowed to wear earphones and i was listening to a message i had my feet propped up on my desk because i was a floor inspector i didn't work too hard you know and all of a sudden brother bannon said something the break area was right across the aisle i heard something echoing through the place i heard somebody speaking in tongues and i found out that was me i better be quiet it was echoing through the building what was it it was stimulation by revelation stimulation everything you know you know those those these these people back there knew who rome was they just didn't have a full understanding but what did the message do it come to tie up all the loose ends it began to tie it up perfect that we can understand we're not in darkness we look down through a glass darkly no not anymore we could see perfectly the apes that we're living in for the full restored revelation of his word for this hour amen you know is the best way to die i knew a pastor in the philippines he's obviously only about 35 36. he had a heart condition he didn't tell nobody you hear what happened you know where he died behind the pulpit doing what god called him to do what a testimony amen what a place to go amen i don't think my wife would like that when i died in that waiting room in there my wife said i never got nervous she didn't she just believed later when i told her what happened i mean it was a blessing to her i remember calling my pastor mike sievert on the phone he was getting ready to go understand i'll be over right now he wanted to hear it too because it was real he was real god give me another opportunity and he gave me another one about a week and a half ago i'm still here i'm not dead i'm just like brother madam said he said what was he said you know when i'm gone you sing only believe i won't be far away i'll hear you singing only believe i'll hear it you know they they went to uh moody i think it was you know moody was a big old gruffy guy and spew when he would talk you know and he said one of these days tell his men you're going to hear that i'm dead he said he said i ain't not dead i can't die i died many years ago i can't die he that believeth in me though he was dead he didn't tell he lived and he that liveth and believe in the beast shall never die because why he is the resurrection and the life hallelujah amen
