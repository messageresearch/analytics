[0:01] the greatest thing that I find against
[0:04] the church tonight is
[0:06] fear Everybody's scared to death about
[0:10] something what are you scared about if a
[0:13] man's born again you should be happy
[0:17] Carefree just like these fellows singing
[0:20] up here and a brother testifying back
[0:22] there just free there ain't nothing can
[0:24] harm you nothing present nothing future
[0:28] nothing can separate us from the love of
[0:30] God that's in
[0:31] Christ God has promised he's called by
[0:36] election he said he's Church in order
[0:39] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[0:41] the father draws him you never come to
[0:43] God because that you wanted to you come
[0:46] because Christ called you God called you
[0:50] and he that comes to me I will in no
[0:52] wise cast out I'll give him every
[0:54] lasting life not just lasting for a week
[0:57] one Revival to another but
[1:00] Everlasting eternal
[1:02] life and will raise him up at the last
[1:05] day oh my that doesn't take the wind out
[1:09] of Satan's sails I don't know what it
[1:11] does say how you know I said Jesus said
[1:14] so thus sayth the Lord Jesus said so
[1:18] that settles it if he said it I believe
[1:20] it he said in John
[1:23] 5:24 P subject to
[1:25] me he that Hearth my words and believeth
[1:28] on him that sent me has everlasting life
[1:31] and shall not come into condemnation
[1:32] with pass and death into life so that's
[1:35] pretty easy brother Brandon no
[1:38] man no man can believe Jesus to be the
[1:43] Christ in his heart and will be the same
[1:44] man he was before can't do it no sir as
[1:49] I said last night drinking smoking
[1:52] gambling all those things isn't
[1:55] sin it isn't sin to gamble it isn't
[1:58] gambling isn't sin rather
[2:00] smoking isn't sin drinking isn't sin
[2:03] swearing isn't sin it's a attribute of
[2:06] sin because you're a sinner that's the
[2:09] reason you do it if you was a Christian
[2:12] you wouldn't do it he said he that loves
[2:14] the world are the things of the world
[2:16] the love of God's Not in even in him so
[2:20] now you're either uh you never did see a
[2:23] Halfway Christian I asked someone the
[2:26] other night I said are you a Christian
[2:28] brother said I'm a pretty good Christian
[2:29] said no you're not there is no pretty
[2:32] good Christian how many ever seen a
[2:35] drunk sober man
[2:37] nobody how ever seen a black white bird
[2:41] nobody it's either you never seen a
[2:43] sinner Saint you're either born again or
[2:46] you're not borned again you're either on
[2:49] one side of the fence and now if you are
[2:52] borned again you have everlasting life
[2:55] and there's nothing within you all the
[2:57] old things has passed away and it's just
[3:00] the the fountain Bitter Sweet Water
[3:02] don't come from the same Fountain see
[3:05] the trees knowing by the fruit it
[3:07] bears by their fruits you shall know
[3:10] what is the Holy Ghost today to a human
[3:13] being when it comes it's the circumcised
[3:16] didn't didn't Stephen say so in in um
[3:19] acts the 7th chapter when he said oh you
[3:21] uncircumcised the heart and ears you
[3:23] always do resist the Holy Ghost as your
[3:25] fathers did so do you is that right and
[3:28] the Holy Ghost is a circumcision and
[3:31] what circumcision do cuts off surpless
[3:34] flesh amen all the things of the world
[3:37] it's circumcises you away from the
[3:39] things of the world the love of the
[3:40] world the love of the flesh the pride of
[3:43] life it just circumcises you from that
[3:45] you have nothing to do with it it does
[3:47] it itself and puts you in love with
[3:49] Jesus Christ with an undying love
[3:52] there's nothing can separate you from
[3:54] the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[3:56] Paul said perils and trials and prisms
[3:57] and everything else nothing present
[3:59] nothing future can separate us from the
[4:01] love of God which in Christ Jesus and
[4:03] he's called you circumcised you put it
[4:06] you in him and predestinated your
[4:09] Eternal
[4:11] destination if that ought to make
[4:12] Christians shout I don't know what we're
[4:14] do it if that wouldn't wake the man up
[4:16] and it's in Christ I don't know what
[4:18] would take to wake him up I believe he's
[4:20] twice dead plucked up with the roots
[4:21] don't you all right
