TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] what about the people that believe in the Lord now and don't and not the way you preach they don't have to believe this they don't have to believe the way I preach it see don't have to believe that so the thing for you to do is to remember that I speak to you in the name of the Lord amen hallelujah amen Lord hallelujah be prepared or you don't know what time something can happen greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to give my reaction on Justin Peterson's claims against brother brandham as a false prophet and charlatan of course I strongly disagree with those accusations I believe William Brandon was a genuine prophet of God and a genuine honest servant of the Lord Jesus Christ in this video I'm defending William brandham as a genuine prophet of God Justin Peters released this video on February 2nd 2025 it's called history of the Pentecostal charismatic movement the video starts at about the 53 minute and 35 second Mark and it's less than half a minute long it ends at the 54 minute and 52 Mark I'll begin by sharing the video of Justin Peters giving a one minute summary of His reasons why he thinks William brandham was a charlatan and false prophet and then I'll give my reactions afterward Ward by God's grace so here's the video of Justin Peters William brandham William brandham is the father of the post World War II healing Revival movement brandham taught that only those who accepted his teachings would be saved he prophesied that all of the world's denominations would be consumed by the Roman Catholic controlled World Council of churches and brandham said that this would happen just before the Rapture and the destruction of the world which he prophesied would happen in the year 1977 well we're a few years past 1977 aren't we and we're yet we're still here he denounced the Trinity as a demonic Doctrine I've actually got audio of William brandham saying this and he said and I quote trinitarianism is of the devil thus saith the Lord It's Oneness theology what TD Jake is to this day modalism he proclaimed himself to be the angel of Revelation 3:14 and he also claimed to be I'll give you two guesses and three three three guesses two of to Elijah Elijah these people were fascinated with Elijah so false prophet charlatan so my first reaction is looking at the words false prophet and charlatan brother brandham was a genuine prophet of God brother brandham spoke with thus sayith the Lord on tape at least six six times and these thus sayi the Lord prophecies have come to pass I made a video about that a couple years ago I'll leave a link to that in the description so you can watch it if you'd like to by the grace of God but here's a summarized list of those six thus sayith the Lords first in 1958 brother Bram told Marilyn Hickey she'd be pregnant if she had Faith with thus sayith the Lord and she had the baby 10 years later second 1961 brother Braham said there'd be no greater gift to the Gentiles than his gift his prophetic discernment son of man gift in 1962 brother R said women would continue to strip themselves that came to pass in 1965 brother R had a vision of the USA Church dancing to rock and roll with Bob hered women that has come to pass fifth brother ROM prophesied of the death of Florence sharen in 1965 and that came to pass and six and finally brother Ram said no denomination will break up and come back to the word the apostolic revelation of the word of God he said that in 1965 and that has come to pass so that quick list there obviously proves brother brandom is a genuine prophet of God he spoke in the name of the Lord and those statements came to pass he also meets the other five requirements for a genuine prophet of God as I put on my video three Prophecies of William brandham in that video I go through the numerous qualifications to be a genuine prophet of God there's at least six there could be more so without a doubt Willam brandham was a genuine prophet of God second Justin Peter said brother BR was a charlatan I had to look this up a charlatan is a malicious trickster a fake person who deceives for personal profit of course I believe that's a false accusation brother brandham was the opposite a humble servant of the Lord Jesus Christ he would and preached to the poorest of poor he would spend long hours praying for people he would preach long indepth sermons to feed the flock of God to fully reveal the revelation of Jesus Christ and there's a story even in 1963 in is your life worthy of the Gospel brother said he was offered five times his current salary to be a part of a bigger Pentecostal denomination and he turned it down because they asked him to compromise on his Bible Doctrine and he wouldn't do it he wouldn't compromise on the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the fact women should have long uncut hair and men should have short hair and the fact women are not called to preach among others brother brandham refused money in order to stay true to God's word as any genuine prophet of God would let's listen to the quote when a man come to me not long ago and sit at a table and said brother brandom I want to reach across the table a great man I want to take hold of your hand I love you I was in a church and heard him preaching said I love you I believe you're a God's servant I said thank you doctor I love you too he said I want to tell you how much I love you as a brother and said you see My Little Queen sitting here my wife you remember her I said I do said the doctor give her two weeks to live with sarom cancer and you come to the city and you prayed for her and looked up and saw a vision and looked back and told me thus sayith the Lord she'll be healed great spot in her back sunk in like that looked like a great big uh like the uh part of a woman's breast pulled inwardly in her back right on her spine is not even a spot of it today said there sets my queen a living today that how can I do anything but love you for praying that prayer of faith how can I keep from bleeding you to be a St of Lord when you saw me and told just exactly what would happen he said now I've got something for you brother Brandon he said I belong to the greatest Pentecostal League there is I said yes sir I know that he said I talked with the brother not long ago and they told me to get in contact with you and tell you that it was a shame that you took that god-given Ministry to a bunch of people off the river and around like that I said that right said yes said God sent that Ministry to hit the nerve spots the big spot the highlights I seen the devil talking right then I thought yeah jump out off this mountain and show you know office building see I thought just lead him out a little far my old mother used to say give the cow enough rope she'll hang her on S I said is that right yes said it's a shame but what you do said what are you today you can hardly buy yourself a meal and said look at Oral Roberts them stepped in and got out there with the 100th of the ministry you got and look what they go I said yeah that's right see and he said my group will take you we'll take you right in is as one of our Brethren they'll all give you the right hand of fellowship and we'll Charter a plane and give you your wages of 500 a week or more if you want it and we'll send you to every major city in the country this happened right in Phoenix Arizona right across the table and he said and we'll pay here said then let the world the outside world let the dignitaries the big guys the up and up so you're always talking about the down and out we got the up and outs so let them see the hand of the Lord and I take my wife long and others can prove that those things that you say comes to pass I said yes sir that'd be great I see the man in the position of a dll LD a writer of Books doctor of literature fine writer fine man see he didn't know the scripture did you know that angel that performed them kind of works never did go to S he stayed with the called out group Abraham he just didn't know it I just let him alone just sat there a little bit I just want to see what the catch was now I said well U uh what would I have to do said well brother Bram just the only thing they said we discussed it a few things little petty things that you teach it you just lay I'm a sign I said for instance what brother all he said you're baptism you know you know you kind of baptized like the Oneness something like that and said little things like that I said oh I went ahead and he said the initial evidence women preachers and just a few little things like that I said uhhuh I said you know I'm surprised that one servant of God would ask another servant of God after paying the tribute to me you did and calling me a prophet and knowing that the word of the lord of the revelation of the word comes to the prophet and you turn around Dr PPE it don't speak of your good intelligence and would say and ask one servant of God you asked another servant of God to compromise on the thing that means more to him in life itself I said no sir brother po by no means what I do it no sir what is it there's a grain of eternal life live a diey whether you're a great guy or not a great guy now friends let's get into these six bullet points that Justin Peters used on his video first he said William Brandon was the father of the postor War II healing Revival movement and I agree with that there are so many testimonies of God answering prayers brother brandom's prayers for the sick and Afflicted such as Congressman Upshaw his voice is twice on brother Ram's tape talking about the healing no longer needing crutches and his desire to spread the testimony of his healing with world leaders such as Joseph Stalin in order to try to convert their souls to Jesus Christ second Florence Humes was healed of tuberculosis I personally met her around 2010 before she passed away she was healed of tuberculosis Marilyn Hickey as we already said was given a thus sayith the Lord she'd have a child and she did 10 years later Georgie Carter who was healed of tuberculosis Haddie Waldrop Banks Wood's wife and Banks Wood's son Ernest farmer who was healed of crippled feet there's videos about his testimony online and a recent one I heard was a brother named Max Manning who's still alive a wall fell on him and he was in the hospital brother bam came and prayed for him and told him he'd get out and live for the glory of God and now he's over 90 still alive in perfect good health just as the prophet of God told him the second bullet point was only those who accepted his teaching would be saved so this is a false accusation brother Bram did not say this in 1964 questions and answers part one they specifically asked brother brandham if people don't believe this your message will they be saved he said yes if they believe the Lord if they didn't believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost that brother Brown taught well then he said of course they'll go into the tribulation if they're alive to see it he said but they're saved not because brother ramam said so but because the Bible says so if you accept the word the word gives you a pardon because the word's already taken your judgment let's listen to the quote what about the people that believe in the Lord now and don't and not the way you preach they don't have to believe this they don't have to believe the way I preach it see don't have to believe that for the last day message will they be saved yes if they believe the Lord see and if they they disagree and say I don't believe he's a word I don't believe that this is right I don't believe in a baptis the holy ghost that shows where they're headed for the tribulation period but those who can accept the word in its fullness not me preaching it because it's a Bible says so those who accept that is free because the word's already been judged the third bullet point was that brother Brandon prophesied that all denominations would be consumed by the World Council of churches just before the Rapture and destruction of the world in 1977 this is a false accusation brother Braham did not prophesy of that he predicted it I have a video on the 1977 prediction that brother Brandon made numerous times and at least I think 18 times or more brother brand said it's a prediction not a prophecy now he said he got it by divine revelation which if you notice was not spoken with thus sayith the Lord it wasn't in the name of the Lord there's at least three reasons he thought the 1977 date was divine inspiration as a prediction first he thought it was Israel's 70th Jubilee so 70 * 50 from the first Jubilee He said was going to be around 1977 second he said 1977 was the time that the Gentiles would have had 1,954 years to have the gospel and that would have been equal to the time that Abraham and the israelies had the Old Testament from the time of Abraham to Christ so brother R thought it was 1950 years from Abraham to Christ and then the Gentiles would get the same amount of time from Christ's Ascension or the book of Acts Church to the end of the G dispensation the end of the 7th Church age which he thought would be around 1977 but again no thus sayith the Lord there was no Prophecy from Brother brandham on this he said it repeatedly and third brother brandham said no democracy had lasted 200 years so United States declared independence in 1776 so brother randam added 200 years to that and had 1976 so he had at least three reasons why he thought 1977 was an important date but again he never said it was a prophecy he said it was a prediction so I believe it's wrong for Justin Peters to state that third bullet point because it was not a prophecy but it is true that all the denominations will be consumed in the world Council of churches some type of ecclesiastical Unity with the Roman Catholic Church brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord all the denominations will take the mark of the beast in 1965 it's predicted that they're going to do it and they're going to do it for it's thus sayith the lord they're going to do it you think them Den nominations will ever break up their denomination come back to the word it's thus sayeth the Lord they won't will they go into the Antichrist exactly it's thus sayth the Lord they will what are you saying about I have to be a witness and so do you all believers that's according to Revelation 2: 20- 23 when the spirit of Jezebel will be judged and of course which church has the spirit of Jezebel the Roman cathol cic Church all the daughters and all the children of the mother Harlot Jezebel will be cast into a bed and destroyed this is speaking of the battle of Armageddon I believe and so that Spirit of Jezebel mentioned in Revelation 2: 20-23 is the mother Harlot The Jezebel Church spoken of in Revelation chapter 17 and 18 the fourth bullet point was that brother Ram denounce the Trinity as a demonic Doctrine and that is true Justin Peters is wrong on this the god of the Old Testament Jehovah or Yahweh never said he was three persons any monotheistic Jew would know that God of the Old Testament never called himself three persons or two persons he was always God Alone of course Justin Peters is a trinitarian so that's why he'd be so zealous against this statement by brother brandham but brother bram's right the Trinity Dogma is such an awful false Doctrine I've two videos called the seven problems with the Trinity Dogma I've also put out a recent video about let us make man in our image and how it's not speaking of three persons so there's numerous videos about how the Trinity is a false Doctrine on my channel and trinitarianism is of the devil with thus say the Lord because it's an addition to the word of God God never asked to be called three persons Proverbs 35 and6 says we must not add to the word of God or else we'll be called Liars revelation 22:18-19 says not to add a word or take a word away the Trinity Dogma adds words onto God's words so it's a false Doctrine the Trinity Dogma is a heresy in of itself and brother Brandon wisely pointed out look at the false corrupt fruits of the Roman Catholic church the church that first pushed the Trinity Dogma so hard I think I had eight problems with the Trinity Dogma in my 2021 book so I'll read those here briefly first and most decimating to its validity the Trinity Dogma adds to the Bible as we've already said second Jesus and his Apostles taught and affirmed pure Hebrew monotheism rather than trinitarianism third the Athenian Creed or 6th Century trinitarian confessional contains multiple contradictions to Biblical teaching on the godhead and there are six examples of how the Creed contradicts the Bible in this section fourth major Bible contradictions and inconsistencies exist among trinitarians fifth the early trinitarians did not affirm that the holy hly Spirit was divine until the Council of Constantinople in 381 ad six trinitarian images and artwork are often deceptive creating false representations of the godhead seventh trinitarians use two fear tactics to persuade others to believe in the Trinity heresy and hell and then eighth God sent a prophet named William Brenham to warn the Christians about the false Trinity Dogma the fifth bullet point was William Brenham proclaimed himself to be the angel of Revelation 3:14 the angel to the lean church and that's true I don't believe he did it directly as far as I know so please correct me if there's quotes where he directly says he is that angel but as far as I can find he did it indirectly in the church age book that was released in December 1965 first of all there would be nothing wrong if brother baham did say he was fulfilling the scripture of Revelation 3:14 because that's what many prophets did such as John the Baptist in Matthew 3:3 John said I am the voice crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord John said I fulfilling Isaiah 40:3 so so even if brother Ram did say he was the Fulfillment of Revelation 3:14 there' be nothing wrong with that as long as it was true which we believe it is true he did fulfill the role of the seventh angel to the seventh and final Church age some may find it interesting though that in January of 1961 brother Braham denied that he had anything to do with the seventh Church age messenger it's from the questions aners sermon let's listen to the quote now if you'll notice and I Little Willy out there put my name on that star out there and that's the reason I passed it over you see cuz I I don't think now I'm going to be honest as I can be I don't think I'd have anything to do with that messenger see that's right I believe that I'm maybe be sent for a part this church to help build that message up to a place to where it would when this Forerunner comes that he will come but I believe me being what I I am I am uh uh uh I believe that I have the message of the day I believe that this is the light of the day and I believe it's pointing to that time coming you see I believe that the message that he said down there uh the message that you have but then in the church age book in chapter N9 on the latery in church age brother brand basically puts all these Bible verses about his ministry together to say that the seventh Church age messenger is also the prophet of Revelation 10:7 he starts this section about the messenger by quoting Revelation 10:7 so he connects Revelation 3:14 the seventh angel with the 7th Angel Revelation 10:7 it must be a human Prophet I have videos about that if you'd like to watch that and then there's a quite a long section where brother Ram uses the following bible verses to show how the seventh angel of Revelation 3:14 is the same seventh angel of Revelation 10:7 he uses Amos 3 6 and 7 Revelation 10 3 and 4 about the seven Thunders Matthew 1710 and 11 Jesus's words about Elijah will surely come and restore all things and then Malachi 45 and 6 Elijah turning the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers and also in my 2021 book I go through three or four reasons why the angel of Revelation 3:14 has to be a human man it cannot be a Heavenly angel that has Heavenly attributes so let's go through those briefly here by God's grace it's on pages 409 and 410 the first reason is God does not tell human prophets to write handwritten letters to Heavenly Angels remember Revelation 2:1 unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write why would Jesus tell John to author a handwritten letter to a Heavenly Angel at Ephesus God doesn't do that God speaks directly to Heavenly angels from his throne second the seven angels are symbolic of human preachers because men are sometimes referred to as angels in scripture such as John being called a messenger by Jesus in Matthew 11:10 the word angel means messenger David is twice called an angel of God in 1st Samuel 29:9 2 Samuel 19:27 Paul says the Galatians received him as an angel of God in Galatians 4:14 and there's a prophet called an angel in Revelation 22: 8 and 9 the third fact fact is that God uses men to help save men Angels assist men but men are God's primary tool for sharing his way to Salvation and fourthly notice the location of these Seven Stars or these seven angels they're in Jesus's right hand both Moses and Jesus defined God's right hand as his power and authority reserved for Christ and not Angels according to Hebrews 1:13 and Jesus Promised his servants his men His prophets and apostles would inherit God's power to witness his resurrection in Acts 1:8 and acts 4:11 and the sixth and final bullet point is that brother Ram claimed to be Elijah and that's true I agree brother Ram did claim to have the spirit of Elijah I don't know if there's a quote where brother Braham specifically said that but again like the seventh Church age messenger he alluded to it I made a video recently about how brother Braham said the spirit of Elijah is the Lord Jesus Christ it's the Holy Ghost with certain attributes upon man the spirit of Elijah is simply the holy spirit with certain attributes anointing a man and brother R was one of those five men who had the spirit of Elijah or will have the spirit of Elijah the five are Elijah Elisha John the Baptist William brandham and then the Elijah with Moses in Revelation 11 also I made a video about William brandham as the messenger to the seven Church age and there's five attributes that he has that both John the Baptist and Elijah had I'll go through those here briefly they all spoke with thus sayith the Lord as I mentioned earlier brother random spoke with thus sayith the Lord at least six times and it came to pass they were all men of the Wilderness Elijah John the Baptist and brother Brandon was a man of the Wilderness they all three rebuked immoral women Elijah rebuked Jezebel John the Baptist rebuked herodias and brother Ron rebuked Marilyn Monroe sexy dressed women jacyn Kennedy and more fourth all the men condemn the false religions of their time Elijah condemned Ahab and Jezebel's false prophets John the Baptist condemned the Pharisees Sadducees calling them a brood of serpents a den of vipers and brother Ram condemned all the denominations of his day he even indicted them in 1963 for crucifying the Lord Jesus aresh in the spiritual realm as Hebrews chapter 6 speaks of when the modern denominational churches disagree with the word of God or teach a false Doctrine they're crucifying the fact of the Holy Ghost to the people and Fifth and finally all three men had human weaknesses when the anointing left Elijah ran a fear of Jezebel John the Baptist wondered in prison if Jesus was the Christ or should he look for another and brother R would say when the anointing left him that he was no Prophet but yet of course he was under the anointing he would say that he was a prophet of God in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God my simple humble reactions to Justice Peter's accusations against brother William brandham over the years I've enjoyed some of Justin Peter's videos especially how he exposes false modern day prophets and all the corruption among these famous but false preachers but in the case of William brandom I humbly disagree he's completely wrong brother brandom was a genuine prophet of God before we close I'm going to play a video portion from the video I made about brother brandham and the controversy about him wearing shorts at the end I put six reasons why I believe brother Bram is a genuine prophet of God so I'm going to put that video portion in here just to remind our friends about the certainty of God vindicating William brandham as a genuine prophet of God here's that clip before finishing this video Let Me Again State the absolute proof that brother Brenham was a genuine prophet of God first there are six verses that declare this authorative phrase that Jesus must remain in Heaven until God has turned the hearts of the end time Believers back to the apostolic faith and these are the six scriptures that God used brother random to fulfill they are acts 3:20 and 21 Matthew 1711 and 12 Malachi 45 and 6 Revelation 107-11 Amos 3:7 and Luke 17:30 and again friends remember no accuser brother brandom has read my 2021 book and tried to refute the Bible truth in that book it's over 800 Pages proving brother random was a genuine prophet of God you know why they haven't because they're afraid of the truth and they're so disingenuous they won't read research the other side of this subject that proves to me they're not serious researchers they're not honest researchers and they're very disingenuous the second reason brother Bram revealed the 12 New Testament Mysteries there's only 12 doctrines called mysteries in the New Testament and brother brand revealed all of them six of them he gave us thus sayith the Lord for the third point is brother Ram gave us eight other Pauline doctrines with thus sayith the Lord the fourth point is that there are six fulfilled thus sayith the Lord prophecies from Brother these people that say none of brother Ram's prophecies were foretold in advance they're foolish they're ignorant they don't know what they're talking about shame on them I have a video that shows six undeniable prophecies thus sayi the Lord that have come to pass the fifth point is there's 14 Pauline doctrines that brother brandham restored to the bride of Christ the New Testament Holy Ghost filled church every other church denomination every other Church Gathering is guilty of breaking one or all 14 of these this proves the true Holy Ghost filled Believers that follow brother's message are the Bride of Jesus Christ because they keep all the Paul's gospel and Paul said we'd be judged by his gospel in Romans 2:16 and then Paul said if anyone adds or takes away their curse in Galatians 1 6-12 again proving brother R was a genuine prophet of God because He restored the truth from Paul's gospel that churches had failed to preach and He restored it to the true bride of Christ today and six and finally brother Ram had many Supernatural Miracles healings and discernments undeniable as these solders and Warriors of the faith who had these experiences die off we're going to have to do a better job and I mean we as message Believers of reminding the people of all these testimonies our family right now is reading the generations book there's 38 individuals who give testimonies in there and each one had thus sayith the Lord's from Brother brandham dreams and Visions discernments all from brother brandham and never one time did it fail and that's what I believe never one time did thus say the Lord fail coming from brother brandham did Brother Bram fail the brown bear Vision yes he told us that but on my video about the brown bear Vision there's 10 people some of them were prophets who failed Visions as well or disobeyed Visions they disobeyed thus sayi the Lord visions that God gave them so I'll put a link in the description to that video and also put a link to the video about the six fulfilled thus sayith the Lord prophecies remember brother Ram's accusers will always point us away from the Bible revelations that God gave to brother brandham and they'll nitpick brother bram's life they'll strain at a knat and swallow camel but what I mentioned here at the end this is what the accusers want us to forget about or try to distract us from all these absolute undeniable proofs that brother Bram was a genuine prophet of God reminds us of how Paul told Timothy Paul was thankful that Timothy was not ashamed of Paul Christ prisoner and that's what we say today we're not ashamed of brother brandom he was Christ prisoner of course he was a sin are saved by grace just like all of us but he was a mighty prophet of God that's undeniable and that's what both of my books have been all about brother bram's Ministry and restoring the modesty standards brother bram's Ministry finishing the mysteries of God Revelation 10:7 Amos 3:7 so we're thankful friends for God sending his Prophet brother William brandham it's a joy to defend the revelation of Jesus Christ from the scriptures as Paul defended the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and then God restored that Revelation through brother William brandham in Matthew 10:41 Jesus said he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward I don't fully understand this verse but I can clearly see in my life because I've received William brandham as a genuine prophet of God I've seen many rewards for that especially in the spiritual Realm by the grace of God brother BR pointed us to the absolute the word of God he raised our faith to believe in the Supernatural power of the Lord Jesus Christ He restored the apostolic Doctrine the Apostolic Faith by the grace of God God used him to finish the mysteries of God and we're beneficiaries of that the 12 New Testament Mysteries are likened unto the bread that was in the Holy place the bread of his face as the Bible calls in the Old Testament and so as we Feast weekly on the word of God it's as if we're eating at the king's table eating God's fresh Mana God's fresh Revelation God's fresh shoe bread we're eating God's word in the presence of the king and this Supernatural bread is giving us Supernatural strength to overcome from Leo deia by the grace of God if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
