[29:59] appreciate the special let's give them a
[30:01] round of applause thank you
[30:12] let's if we could let's go to
[30:13] deuteronomy 28 by god's grace
[30:18] i'd like to look at uh blessings and
[30:20] curses tonight
[30:22] it's like i said it's quite a huge
[30:23] subject we'd like to maybe just hit the
[30:26] highlights tonight by god's grace
[30:30] and just see how far we can get
[30:37] so deuteronomy 28 verse 1.
[30:48] i like to i got some slides i want to
[30:49] show too so just give me a moment i'll
[30:52] get that ready
[30:57] uh it's important topic praise god we
[30:59] want to be blessed and walk in all of
[31:01] god's blessings
[31:03] and we don't want to be under curses
[31:05] we want to walk in the blessing of god
[31:07] so that's so important
[31:10] we know there's such a thing as
[31:11] permanent curses like the cursed
[31:13] children and
[31:14] the people on the left hand of jesus at
[31:16] the white throne judgment
[31:17] you and i will battle we don't battle
[31:19] that one we battle the temporary ones
[31:22] things
[31:24] problems we we create ourselves many
[31:26] times right punishments that we must
[31:29] live with because of decisions so god
[31:31] help us to overcome praise god i know he
[31:34] will
[31:35] deuteronomy 28 1.
[31:45] let's just read that uh one verse
[31:47] together
[31:49] it's quite an extensive chapter here
[31:51] uh
[31:53] if you remember from your reading you
[31:54] know deuteronomy 27
[31:56] 28 and 29 are the chapters that moses
[32:00] reiterates all the blessings and the
[32:03] curses as the children of israel prepare
[32:05] to take the promised land so he's
[32:07] basically repeating the law before they
[32:09] took the land
[32:14] um
[32:15] let's just read verses one and two
[32:17] let's read that together that would be a
[32:19] good reading for us tonight let's read
[32:20] verses one and two
[32:22] on three one two three and it shall come
[32:25] to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently
[32:28] unto the voice of the lord thy god to
[32:31] observe and to do all his commandments
[32:34] which i command thee this day that the
[32:37] lord thy god will set thee on high above
[32:40] all nations of the earth and all these
[32:43] blessings shall come on thee and
[32:46] overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto
[32:49] the voice of the lord died god let's
[32:51] have a word of prayer can we just our
[32:53] heads if you have a need on your heart

[33:17] blessings help us to sing through the
[33:18] pain when we go through trials and
[33:20] praise your name and uh lord give you

[33:29] people to receive it and help me to
[33:31] rightly divide lord for your glory lord

[33:37] spiritual promised land of adoption
[33:40] uh in the promises of god so lord we
[33:43] just bless your holy name tonight and be
[33:45] with us tonight in christ jesus name we
[33:47] pray the saints said amen god bless you
[33:50] as you're seated there praise god
[33:57] so i have some quotes i'd like to share
[34:00] did wendy go home did anybody know
[34:03] oh
[34:03] okay praise god i was going to send her
[34:05] a text act i didn't know if she left i
[34:07] know she has praise god
[34:09] god bless us through anyhow
[34:10] we're going to text you real quick there
[34:13] so let's look at blessings and curses uh
[34:15] there are over
[34:16] let me refresh i thought there was over
[34:18] 300 cursed scriptures in the bible
[34:23] i'm sorry there's
[34:25] 161 old testament 20 new testament i
[34:28] went through all the new testament
[34:30] i made it through all the old testament
[34:32] ones
[34:33] but lord willing i'll do that so maybe
[34:34] this would be like a part one and maybe
[34:35] have a part two
[34:37] uh not next week is whether bender out
[34:38] here but maybe on a wednesday night or
[34:40] something like that i think it's just an
[34:42] outstanding subject to look at and how
[34:44] many want to overcome every curse and
[34:46] when i live enjoy every blessing
[34:49] that's what i want to do by god's grace
[34:51] i know the lord will certainly help us
[34:54] uh so let's look at our there's my notes
[34:56] i think i'll skip that one let's first
[34:58] define uh blessings and curses so we
[35:01] have a pretty sim or solid idea it's
[35:04] very simple of course
[35:06] um
[35:08] i found the hebrew definitions just to
[35:10] be like their own names so i had to go
[35:11] to the dictionaries so bless in hebrew
[35:14] means to pray salute adore
[35:16] but we would we refer to it as god's
[35:18] favor right god's protection
[35:21] if we are blessed we're under god's
[35:23] favor
[35:24] god is for us he's not against us right
[35:27] um so we see that in the hebrew and then
[35:29] also in our common dictionary curse in
[35:32] the hebrew was basically the same thing
[35:34] as its its name it didn't give me any
[35:35] synonyms
[35:37] um and i thought these were good words
[35:38] too according to what brother branham
[35:39] taught as well
[35:41] curse in the dictionary means inflict
[35:44] means to harm or punish
[35:46] okay so let's not forget you know uh
[35:49] hebrews 12. i think i preached on a
[35:51] couple wednesdays ago
[35:53] where uh hebrews 12 says the lord
[35:56] chastens every son whom he calls
[36:00] and he scourgeth every son or daughter
[36:02] and that literally means to blow
[36:04] to hit some hus to hit a child with a
[36:06] stick or some type of a
[36:08] instrument
[36:10] so jesus uh scourges or he chastens
[36:14] arms or is a little bit
[36:17] inflicts or punishes all of his children
[36:19] praise god to correct them right to
[36:21] teach them
[36:23] uh so
[36:25] uh i want to uh look at this here i want
[36:27] to just say this as well that for us
[36:30] we're calling it favor
[36:32] um
[36:33] but i want to just say to a blessing is
[36:35] always conditional
[36:37] uh it's always going to be conditional
[36:40] and it's always based upon god's
[36:42] foreknowledge of your obedience
[36:45] okay because god has to fore no god
[36:47] can't force anybody to heaven god can't
[36:48] force
[36:50] people to go to hell he has to give the
[36:52] three more agency so it's always based
[36:54] upon what god knows you're going to
[36:57] choose either obey or disobey
[37:00] so that that takes away all covetousness
[37:03] or jealousy right oh i'm jealous of that
[37:05] sister because all they do is get
[37:06] blessings well
[37:08] it's god knew that they would obey the
[37:10] word of god
[37:11] right so there's no reason to be jealous
[37:14] the bible said be happy for them right
[37:16] sharing their joy well that brother he's
[37:19] got so many blessings that uh i just i
[37:22] don't like him or something like that we
[37:23] shouldn't think that
[37:25] uh because god knew god's honoring their
[37:27] obedience praise god
[37:30] uh so it's something that we must always
[37:32] keep in mind god's blessing is gonna be
[37:34] based upon
[37:35] our obedience our free more agency
[37:39] okay so um
[37:42] and this is actually found i love this
[37:44] and i put this in the upcoming book by
[37:45] god's grace if the lord will help me i'm
[37:47] just waiting on get all the feedback
[37:49] back i've got it finished and just
[37:51] waiting on everybody else
[37:53] this is when abraham goes to sacrifice
[37:56] isaac but god provides a substitute in
[37:59] verse 16 by myself have i sworn saith
[38:01] the lord for because thou hast done this
[38:04] thing and has not withheld thy son thine
[38:06] only son that in blessing i will bless
[38:09] thee and multiply i will multiply thy
[38:12] seed as the stars of the heaven and as
[38:15] the sand which is upon the seashore and
[38:18] thy seed shall possess the gates of the
[38:21] gate rather of his enemies
[38:23] and in thy seed shall all the nations of
[38:26] the earth be blessed because thou hast
[38:28] obeyed my voice
[38:30] remember god had already pronounced he'd
[38:31] already offered the blessings in chapter
[38:33] 12. remember when abraham was 75 he
[38:36] called him out said leave your country
[38:38] your kindred come to a place that i'll
[38:40] call you he said i'm going to bless you
[38:42] and but he but abraham had to prove
[38:44] worthy of that he had to meet the
[38:46] conditions of the blessing
[38:48] and god knew he would that's why he
[38:50] foreign knew him and he he called he
[38:52] knew he'd be abram and he knew he
[38:53] changed his name to abraham praise god
[38:56] amen god ordained that name he anointed
[38:58] abraham's father to call him abram you
[39:00] know and then abraham father of many
[39:02] nations
[39:04] and so it was based upon god's
[39:06] foreknowledge
[39:07] and it's a beautiful idea that god calls
[39:11] us and the children of god will be
[39:13] obedient to the word of god amen
[39:16] now uh
[39:18] in the message so amongst us
[39:22] uh we don't use the word curse very
[39:23] often do we like i've never heard
[39:25] anybody sister karen have you come to
[39:27] church i just feel cursed today
[39:29] i don't hear anybody use that word but i
[39:31] do hear people say i'm bound
[39:34] i'm struggling i'm feeding the black dog
[39:37] more than the white dog
[39:39] right
[39:40] uh i'm addicted uh
[39:42] i haven't been creating the right
[39:43] atmosphere
[39:45] this this is these are our words for
[39:48] curse
[39:50] right we're living under
[39:51] the punishment of god
[39:54] okay because i've never heard any of you
[39:55] say that
[39:56] how you doing today brother oh i'm real
[39:58] cursed today
[40:00] nobody nobody says that you know
[40:03] um
[40:04] and so i thought you know like wow how
[40:06] come we never heard a sermon called
[40:08] curses well because we don't use that
[40:09] word
[40:10] we use positive and negative right you
[40:12] know
[40:13] speak the word and never have a negative
[40:15] testimony
[40:16] in other words they're saying don't
[40:17] curse right don't speak curses with your
[40:19] mouth
[40:20] that's what it's really referring to
[40:22] and so uh in the message and we preach
[40:25] this all the time
[40:27] um we must find the cause to any curse
[40:30] right or any any addiction any box of
[40:32] rattlesnakes jesus you've accepted you
[40:34] gotta find the cause why did you accept
[40:36] it why did you let this into your mind
[40:39] right why didn't you cast it down why
[40:41] didn't you cast it out right why did you
[40:42] let it into your house or your life
[40:45] and so you got to find the cause to it
[40:47] jesus said
[40:48] that as well you gotta
[40:50] you let's
[40:51] sometimes we let evil thoughts in and it
[40:53] paralyzes the strong man and it spoils
[40:56] the house right the demons take out all
[40:58] the joy and all the blessings and all
[40:59] the victory and all all the blessings
[41:01] and we're left with no blessings
[41:04] well really we're under a temporary
[41:05] curse
[41:06] because of our own decision-making
[41:08] right or disobedience
[41:11] but the cause can always be found praise
[41:14] god i like that when the bible said when
[41:15] that uh uh when the uh the man uh i'm
[41:19] sorry when the prodigal he came to
[41:21] himself in the pigpen
[41:23] he finally came to himself and oh what
[41:24] was the cause of this oh i left my
[41:27] father's house and it's my fault i was
[41:29] i'm the guilty one but i can get out of
[41:31] this situation the father will surely
[41:34] make a way that i can get out of this
[41:35] situation amen see he knew i'm really
[41:38] not cursed i'm really blessed but it was
[41:40] my decision that caused me to be cursed
[41:43] but there's a way out let's go back to
[41:45] the father and repent praise god
[41:47] there's always a way out
[41:49] now look at this i found this good
[41:50] scripture i heard a preacher i'll
[41:51] mention him later derek prince he passed
[41:53] away but
[41:55] he's what a beautiful scripture oh sorry
[41:57] uh
[41:58] proverbs 26 2 as the bird wandereth as
[42:02] the swallow by fly so the curse
[42:05] causeless shall not come
[42:08] so in other words there's always a cause
[42:10] for a curse that comes
[42:13] right there's always a cause for a curse
[42:17] and that's what we got to find right if
[42:18] there's a problem let's find the cosmic
[42:20] that's what made brother branham's gift
[42:22] so different that's why he could only
[42:24] get to one at a time he had by the holy
[42:26] spirit he had to go down past just past
[42:28] the outer appearance he had to go down
[42:30] in their spirit realm and sometimes down
[42:32] into their soul realm
[42:34] to see are you even a christian yet
[42:36] right
[42:38] he said are you you ask him are you
[42:40] saved he sometimes he had to go down to
[42:42] the very he said if you'll repent and
[42:43] become a christian god will heal you of
[42:45] that uh that curse right or that ability
[42:48] whatever you have the sickness
[42:52] and but you know what brother amber
[42:53] always talks about you know
[42:55] he kind of beat himself up a little bit
[42:56] or roberts could just go through the
[42:57] prayer line right pray pray pray run
[42:59] them through pray pray pray they'd have
[43:00] many testimonies and bill abraham was
[43:02] concerned about it he said god should i
[43:04] be like oral roberts and the holy spirit
[43:05] said go just as you're led
[43:09] amen praise god so most of the time he
[43:11] just kept doing the discernment
[43:13] because that was the ability or
[43:15] robertson have that ability praise god
[43:17] no man or woman's had that ability
[43:20] so he he was led to do it that way
[43:23] because he had a special ability to find
[43:24] the cause of the problem
[43:28] and i've said this before any revival
[43:29] you go to where there's uh rejoicing or
[43:32] any service where there's anointing the
[43:34] it's always the same repentance is the
[43:36] key speaking the word and living the
[43:39] word amen because my wife and i have
[43:42] seen people go to camps uh
[43:44] come back saying they're filled with the
[43:46] holy ghost and just live like the devil
[43:50] so see they got the they're speaking the
[43:51] word but they never received the word
[43:54] right they felt the anointing on the
[43:56] body they were speaking it with their
[43:58] mouth and their mind but never got down
[44:00] to the soul praise god amen and i mean
[44:03] like divorces uh cigarette smoking
[44:06] drinking and movies and no church i mean
[44:07] that's what i mean like all the way the
[44:09] depths of satan
[44:10] just a full given over
[44:13] cursed life
[44:15] and come back from the youth camp saying
[44:18] they're born again
[44:21] a real saint of god
[44:22] can't do that
[44:23] because they're sealed into the kingdom
[44:24] of god
[44:26] and we're not you know we're not uh
[44:27] bashing anybody but we're looking at the
[44:30] the curses that exist around the message
[44:33] right
[44:34] it's it's up to you
[44:36] it's up to us right do we want blessings
[44:38] or curses it's up to us whatever we
[44:40] allow
[44:41] amen so see there is a cause for every
[44:45] curse
[44:48] now we'll get to the end as i preach a
[44:49] few weeks ago sometimes
[44:51] it's it's not like a curse sometimes
[44:53] it's a test
[44:55] and there may be no cause other than to
[44:57] humble you or give you a testimony
[45:00] okay so i'll just say that right away so
[45:01] we're aware of that
[45:03] right that's paul paul didn't do
[45:04] anything wrong but god said to humble
[45:06] you i'm going to let your eyes
[45:08] have eye trouble you're going to suffer
[45:10] and you're a satanic
[45:12] buffeting messenger from satan is going
[45:14] to dwell in your eyes and give you eye
[45:16] trouble not because of anything wrong
[45:18] you did but to keep you from getting
[45:20] prideful
[45:21] okay so see that he wasn't cursed right
[45:24] like we'd say for anything he did but he
[45:26] was afflicted in order to keep him
[45:28] humble it was a test of faith
[45:31] okay so i just want to let that be known
[45:33] right away first by god's grace and
[45:35] sometimes the saints of god do
[45:37] everything right they live right but
[45:39] then god has to give us a test a really
[45:41] hard tester trial
[45:43] to keep us humble or to produce
[45:45] something in our lives
[45:47] all right
[45:49] so i just want to bring this out too the
[45:51] true meaning of the blessing in
[45:52] deuteronomy 12. now god told moses i'm
[45:55] sorry abraham and i'll bless them that
[45:56] bless thee and curse them that curse
[45:58] thee and in these shall all families of
[46:01] the earth be blessed now we we look at
[46:03] this many times as a natural thing right
[46:05] oh god bless abraham's cattle god bless
[46:08] his family and his womb or his wife's
[46:10] womb and his seed and all these natural
[46:12] things but really this was speaking of
[46:15] justification this was speaking of
[46:17] forgiveness repentance this was speaking
[46:19] of salvation amen praise god it doesn't
[46:22] look like it right does that does
[46:24] anything in there look like water
[46:25] baptism to you
[46:27] no it just says blessed
[46:30] but paul picks this up in galatians 3 7
[46:33] and he says know ye therefore they which
[46:35] are of faith the same are the children
[46:37] of abraham and the scripture foreseen
[46:39] that god would justify the heathen
[46:42] through faith preached before the gospel
[46:45] unto abraham saying in thee shall all
[46:47] nations be blessed amen see god
[46:50] interprets his word any way he wants
[46:52] praise god
[46:53] it just said you're all going to be
[46:54] blessed it didn't say justification the
[46:56] first time but god interprets that and
[46:58] god really makes us realize the greatest
[47:00] blessing there is is to be forgiven of
[47:02] your sins amen amen
[47:05] but you wouldn't know that by reading
[47:07] genesis 12 3 at least i didn't i don't
[47:10] know if some of you smart people caught
[47:11] it or not but i certainly didn't catch
[47:12] it i had to read that in galatians like
[47:14] wow
[47:15] god preached that god preached that to
[47:17] abraham god's the only preacher there is
[47:19] amen verse 9 so then they which are be
[47:22] of faith are blessed with faithful
[47:24] abraham did i go too fast no no okay i
[47:27] did all right
[47:29] now let's look at some kinds of curses
[47:31] here
[47:32] um
[47:34] like i said i'm only scratching the
[47:35] surface i haven't got to
[47:37] i maybe got to five of those old
[47:39] testament scriptures there's like 161 i
[47:41] only got to like five of them um
[47:45] now there's temp there's permanent
[47:46] curses like we know are for as you'll
[47:49] see the serpent cain unbelievers right
[47:52] permanent they're permanently cursed or
[47:55] permanently afflicted or
[47:57] uh punished right
[47:59] with uh in the lake of fire but you and
[48:01] i we're we're battling the temporary
[48:04] ones because we are blessed with eternal
[48:06] life
[48:07] how many god eternal life tonight amen
[48:09] now here can i hear a shout amen amen
[48:12] amen we got eternal life amen
[48:15] we're not cursed uh forever praise god
[48:19] god won't be upset forever
[48:21] right
[48:22] we've got eternal life and we'll be
[48:24] blessed but we've got to learn lessons
[48:26] and many times we're so stubborn we got
[48:28] to learn the hard way
[48:32] now let's look at some permanent ones
[48:33] i'm going to go through these kind of
[48:34] quickly because you're familiar uh god
[48:37] curses the serpent cursed above all
[48:39] cattle now he's been cursed ever since
[48:41] now i don't know if he's going to go
[48:42] back in the future home sister karen i
[48:44] don't know if god's going to turn the
[48:45] serpent back to having legs and we don't
[48:47] know that
[48:48] but he's cursed for quite a long time
[48:50] right so it looks like it's permanent i
[48:52] don't know maybe the uh maybe god will
[48:55] bring him back to his original state i
[48:57] don't know
[48:58] but then the ground is cursed that's
[49:00] permanent right until the future i'm
[49:02] sorry until the millennium
[49:04] so what i mean is just permanent a very
[49:06] long time
[49:07] okay
[49:08] uh next
[49:09] cain i believe
[49:11] thou art cursed from the earth and now
[49:13] look he this is what i love the bible
[49:15] calls it punishment here my punishment
[49:17] or my curse is greater than i can bear
[49:22] so cain sees he's punished he murdered
[49:24] his brother and all he cares about is
[49:26] himself he's not even caring about his
[49:27] brother what about me what about my
[49:29] punishment huck he's so selfish
[49:32] uh he said you're cursed from the earth
[49:36] and the ground won't bring forth you're
[49:38] a fugitive and vagabond
[49:40] uh he said my punishment is greater than
[49:42] i can bear jesus uh when he separates at
[49:45] the white throne judgment uh sheep from
[49:47] the goats
[49:49] depart from me he cursed and everlasting
[49:51] fire prepared for the devils and angels
[49:53] church god help us to uh feed the hungry
[49:56] right for i was hungry and you gave me
[49:58] no meat i was thirsty you gave me no
[50:00] drink now we can say that natural and
[50:02] spiritual right
[50:05] give somebody spiritual food like the
[50:06] church age book
[50:08] i was a stranger and you took me not in
[50:12] naked and you clothed me not sick and in
[50:14] prison and you visited me not
[50:16] okay and this is why they miss eternal
[50:18] life because they fail to have
[50:19] compassion in this life
[50:23] for someone who's hurting they only
[50:24] cared about themselves they were so
[50:26] selfish and so god said i'm cursing you
[50:28] punishing you
[50:30] and you'll cease to exist at some point
[50:31] because you've failed to help people on
[50:34] in this life
[50:36] may god help us praise god to help
[50:37] people
[50:40] peter says it as well their eyes are
[50:42] full of adultery now this is the balaam
[50:44] idea here the balaam group
[50:46] right which were borderline believers
[50:48] they believe for some blessings but then
[50:50] they turn away from the word
[50:52] uh he says full of adultery cannot cease
[50:54] from sin beguiling unstable souls see
[50:57] they they they're going down and they
[50:59] pull people down with them
[51:02] a heart they've exercised with covetous
[51:04] practice all they want to do is get
[51:06] other things that belong to other people
[51:08] for themselves and peter says they're
[51:10] cursed children
[51:11] which have forsaken the right way
[51:14] and are gone astray following the way of
[51:16] balaam the son of bosar who loved the
[51:19] wages of righteousness see church we've
[51:20] we gotta walk in the way of the word and
[51:22] we gotta love righteousness
[51:24] we have to love to obey
[51:28] he love to disobey we've gotta love
[51:30] obedience praise god
[51:32] that brings the blessing of god
[51:35] amen
[51:36] now let's look at some
[51:38] kinds of temporary boy i'm going through
[51:40] here pretty fast this might be a short
[51:41] sermon
[51:43] a little nervous here
[51:46] uh kinds of temporary curses
[51:49] actually we can spend a little bit time
[51:50] on this first one a little more time
[51:52] um
[51:54] there are the natural promised land
[51:57] blessings and curses they have a type
[51:59] and many of them have a spiritual
[52:01] application to the new testament and
[52:02] some of them are actually literal
[52:05] you know like some of these are
[52:06] some in other words some of the same
[52:08] blessings in the natural for the natural
[52:10] promised land exist for the spiritual
[52:12] promised land
[52:14] and i'll show you some simple examples
[52:16] that everybody can hopefully see
[52:18] by god's grace
[52:20] so you have those you have just general
[52:22] if if you say you're living in the
[52:23] promised land then we must obey if we
[52:26] want to be blessed praise god
[52:28] if we disobey we'll suffer we'll be
[52:31] punished
[52:34] now self-inflicted is where you curse
[52:37] yourself
[52:38] okay and hopefully nobody does that by
[52:40] god's grace um the man always said don't
[52:42] call yourself a weak christian that's
[52:44] cursing yourself right that's bringing
[52:46] that's inviting spirits right
[52:48] it's inviting spirits oh i'm weak so
[52:50] when satan hears you say you're weak
[52:51] then he brings the temptation you always
[52:52] fall to right or a new one that it's
[52:55] like the other one
[52:57] so that's it's inviting it's inviting
[52:59] evil spirits right we don't want to buy
[53:01] evil spirits we want to cast down evil
[53:03] spirits amen
[53:05] but there's numerous examples you'll see
[53:07] now there's authority figure curses
[53:09] usually dealing with husbands and
[53:12] fathers so husbands with wives and then
[53:15] uh fathers with children
[53:17] okay
[53:19] and sometimes people even say like
[53:21] preachers with congregations
[53:23] okay so there's so i gotta study more on
[53:26] all those
[53:27] but i think we i think we can see like a
[53:29] pretty common one like if we speak good
[53:31] about our children they'll turn out good
[53:33] but if we speak evil about our children
[53:36] they may turn out bad because we speak
[53:38] evil about them right it creates like we
[53:40] said creates the wrong atmosphere
[53:42] right they start believing a lie
[53:46] and then there's actual witchcraft
[53:48] curses which
[53:49] these people that do witchcraft curses
[53:51] are actually like professional
[53:54] sorcerers right they get paid for it
[53:57] like the tarot cards and then witches
[53:59] and they actually get paid for that
[54:02] uh like balak balak was trying to hire
[54:04] balaam now balaam never did it right he
[54:06] never could curse him because god said
[54:07] you're blessed israel but balak was into
[54:10] that he was a moabite so he was into
[54:12] sorcery he was inda we'd say we call it
[54:14] the occult
[54:16] there's actually that's a real thing
[54:17] right
[54:20] and those are curses
[54:24] church for my what i understand now
[54:25] these are always conditional
[54:28] and i'll say like this no one can curse
[54:30] an obedient child of god
[54:34] no one
[54:35] they can do whatever they want but you
[54:37] have a right they can say whatever they
[54:39] want but you've got a right to plead the
[54:40] blood of jesus christ amen and every one
[54:44] of his covenant blessings because if
[54:46] you're keeping his word then you're
[54:47] entitled to his favor amen
[54:50] praise god because you've honored him if
[54:52] you honor god god said i'll honor you
[54:54] amen amen
[54:57] so if you are under that if you're under
[54:59] the obedient blessings and something bad
[55:01] does happen then you know god had to
[55:03] allow it like we've heard like with job
[55:05] god had to allow it and so then you can
[55:07] rejoice you can still seek god for the
[55:10] understanding of why like paul did three
[55:12] times he prayed you imagine that three
[55:14] times why are my eyes
[55:16] why can't i see i must i love the word
[55:18] of god i'm a scholar i love this why
[55:19] can't i see i need to write the word of
[55:21] god you know
[55:22] three times he saw the lord and the lord
[55:24] finally gave the answer my grace is
[55:26] sufficient for you
[55:28] so see what does that teach us church
[55:30] sometimes one prayer god doesn't want to
[55:32] just talk to you one time sometimes he
[55:34] wants to talk to you more than that
[55:36] so keep praying about it right
[55:39] keep praying what does he like he likes
[55:40] that communion
[55:42] he likes that fellowship like jesus
[55:44] remember three times he went back in
[55:46] gethsemane three times do i have to take
[55:48] this cup
[55:50] and so we had that fellowship well here
[55:51] paul same thing three times and he gets
[55:53] the answer on the third time so don't
[55:55] let's not be discouraged i'll just be
[55:57] honest sometimes i pray for things and i
[56:00] forget to pray a second time now i'm
[56:02] still wondering sister karen in my mind
[56:04] why isn't god answered
[56:05] and then god has to bring like a sermon
[56:07] around or or to remind me oh you got to
[56:09] pray a second time oh keep praying about
[56:11] that keep praying
[56:13] keep seeking god because that means god
[56:15] wants your fellowship praise god
[56:17] he wants more of your time
[56:19] right
[56:20] because remember paul was going to get
[56:21] prideful
[56:23] unless jesus allowed this buffeting
[56:25] messenger to come and inflict his eyes
[56:27] he was going to get prideful so what
[56:28] does he need to avoid pride some honest
[56:30] prayer
[56:32] praise god he needs some pain in the
[56:34] body and some honest prayer
[56:38] now you won't hear a lot of amens on
[56:39] that one because
[56:40] nobody likes pain in the body
[56:43] which that's that's understandable
[56:45] but that's that's scriptural that is
[56:47] scripture job as well we know
[56:51] okay so there's there's numerous kinds
[56:53] now there could be more there's four
[56:54] right there and i put that fifth i just
[56:56] put a note on there there's actually
[56:58] there's could be more than that like i
[56:59] said i'm just kind of uh hitting the
[57:00] highlights tonight i just felt led
[57:03] uh to preach on this in fact amen and
[57:06] bang i think we talked about it last
[57:07] sunday night i think or was it two
[57:08] sundays ago
[57:11] we were talking about blessings and
[57:13] curses
[57:14] and so then yesterday i had a reminder
[57:15] pop up like four times
[57:17] studied blessings and curses and i'm
[57:19] trying to study the other one and
[57:21] and then all of a sudden i was uh
[57:23] looking at youtube and then the sermon
[57:24] came up i want to listen to about
[57:25] generational blessings and curses so i
[57:27] took that as like five or six voices
[57:29] study that studied that
[57:31] because it just kept coming and i've
[57:33] been wanting to do it for months and
[57:34] months and months i've said it before
[57:36] um so let's take your bibles let's do
[57:38] some good reading here and let's see how
[57:41] it's so it's amazing how many of these
[57:44] natural promised lands blessings are
[57:46] actually apply for the spiritual
[57:47] promised land as well
[57:49] now we know god doesn't deal with
[57:51] gentiles as a nation god deals with us
[57:53] as individuals
[57:55] right
[57:55] but we can still see though church we
[57:57] how many can still see god's mercy on
[57:59] america just for the saints that are
[58:01] here
[58:03] satan ultimately runs washington dc
[58:05] right ultimately
[58:07] but god is merciful to this nation what
[58:10] have we had 230 some years of
[58:13] 250 something years how old is our
[58:15] nation i'd like to do a little
[58:16] subtraction real quick 1776 to 2020. so
[58:20] to do some addition there but look at
[58:22] that look at the mercy of god
[58:24] he doesn't deal with us as a nation but
[58:26] he's letting our nation still be a city
[58:29] on a hill that cannot be hidden because
[58:31] of the few believers that still are here
[58:33] by god's grace
[58:35] i love that god always has his eyes on
[58:38] the remnant
[58:39] right even if everybody else amen is
[58:41] going off in sin as long as we live true
[58:43] to god god's eyes on the sparrow praise
[58:46] god his eyes on his people those that
[58:48] are making intercession and calling upon
[58:50] god god is seeking true worshipers amen
[58:53] amen who will worship him in spirit and
[58:55] in truth
[58:56] for the father secret such
[58:59] amen
[59:03] so if you got your bibles
[59:05] deuteronomy 27 actually i'm sorry yeah
[59:07] dude i'm 27 it ends with some curses
[59:11] so let's go through those and then we'll
[59:12] read through deuteronomy 28 this is the
[59:14] chapter of blessing and curses everybody
[59:17] a lot of people know that i guess
[59:18] scholars
[59:19] i knew about it before but then i forgot
[59:21] about it
[59:22] let's just go to deuteronomy 27. you get
[59:24] a good idea here now verses one to eight
[59:26] is where uh moses tells them to build uh
[59:29] the stones once they get in the promised
[59:31] land and and write the word of god on
[59:33] them
[59:34] and uh offer peace offerings and they
[59:36] got to be 12 whole stones and everything
[59:38] like that beautiful beautiful man they
[59:40] had the word they had their own tablets
[59:42] there see they had
[59:43] tablets of stone we got tablets of ipads
[59:45] and they had tablets of stone with the
[59:47] word of god written right on it
[59:50] verse 9 and moses and the priests the
[59:52] levites fake in all israel saying take
[59:54] heed and hearken o israel this day thou
[59:56] become the people the lord thy god
[59:58] thou shalt therefore obey the voice of
[1:00:01] the lord thy god and do his commandments
[1:00:02] and his statutes which i command thee
[1:00:04] this day and moses charged the people
[1:00:06] the same day saying there shall not i'm
[1:00:08] sorry there shall stand upon mount
[1:00:10] gerizim to bless the people
[1:00:12] i'm sorry these shall stand when ye are
[1:00:15] come over jordan simeon and levi and
[1:00:17] judah and issachar and joseph and
[1:00:19] benjamin and these shall stand upon
[1:00:20] mount evil
[1:00:22] to curse reuben gad and asher and
[1:00:24] zebulon dan and naphtali and the levite
[1:00:27] shall speak and say unto all the men of
[1:00:29] israel with a loud voice cursed be the
[1:00:31] man that maketh any graven image or
[1:00:33] molten image an abomination unto the
[1:00:35] lord the work of the hands of the
[1:00:37] craftsman and putteth it in a secret
[1:00:39] place
[1:00:40] and all the people shall answer and say
[1:00:45] right so brother man taught us the
[1:00:47] mantis it's not just a statue anything
[1:00:49] can be an idol
[1:00:51] anything that you worship and give more
[1:00:53] time to that and you try to draw
[1:00:55] strength from that that's the idol
[1:00:57] and look secret so see that's why secret
[1:00:59] sins are so
[1:01:00] it's so important to ask god to help us
[1:01:02] to cleanse our lives from secret sins
[1:01:05] because there's actually a curse upon
[1:01:07] anyone that would do that
[1:01:09] when they take idols
[1:01:10] and they bring it in and do it in secret
[1:01:13] there's actually a curse on that
[1:01:17] verse 16 cursed be the he that setteth
[1:01:20] light by his father or his mother i
[1:01:22] don't remember what that means and all
[1:01:24] the people shall say amen cursed be he
[1:01:26] that removeth his neighbor's landmark so
[1:01:28] this is with property and all the people
[1:01:30] shall say amen
[1:01:32] cursed be he that maketh the blind to
[1:01:34] wander out of the way and all the people
[1:01:36] shall say
[1:01:37] amen
[1:01:39] cursed be he that perverted the judgment
[1:01:40] of the stranger the fatherless
[1:01:43] and the widow and all the people shall
[1:01:45] say
[1:01:46] amen so we got to be careful how we we
[1:01:48] help people that's remember that's part
[1:01:49] of matthew 25. the people that get
[1:01:51] eternal life because they helped
[1:01:54] they gave food or water or else they
[1:01:56] like the spiritual food spiritual water
[1:02:01] judging the weak those that don't have a
[1:02:03] father don't have a mom
[1:02:05] don't have a spouse
[1:02:07] we have to support them
[1:02:13] verse 20. cursed me that lies with now
[1:02:15] we get into some sexual sins 20 to 23
[1:02:18] he that lied with his father's wife
[1:02:19] because he hath uncovered his father's
[1:02:20] skirt and all the people shall say amen
[1:02:23] cursed be that life with any manner of
[1:02:25] beast and all the people shall say amen
[1:02:27] cursed me that lieth with his sister and
[1:02:29] the daughter of his father or the
[1:02:30] daughter of his mother and all the
[1:02:31] people shall say amen cursed me that
[1:02:33] lies with them his mother-in-law and all
[1:02:35] the people shall say amen cursed be he
[1:02:37] that smiteth his neighbor secretly
[1:02:42] and all the people shall say amen see
[1:02:45] they didn't want to do it publicly
[1:02:46] somebody could see it they wait till
[1:02:47] they're all alone
[1:02:49] and they basically curse somebody else
[1:02:51] right in the private
[1:02:53] right
[1:02:56] remember you can kill people with their
[1:02:58] your words too right you can smite them
[1:02:59] with your words secretly
[1:03:02] verse 25
[1:03:04] cursed to be he that taketh reward to
[1:03:06] slay an innocent person like the hitmen
[1:03:08] right they hire hitmen
[1:03:11] uh and all the people shall say amen
[1:03:13] cursed be he that confirmeth not all the
[1:03:15] words of the law to do them and all the
[1:03:16] people shall say amen now that's the
[1:03:18] curse that paul said jesus jesus
[1:03:20] fulfills all these curses but that one
[1:03:22] especially they were cursed if they
[1:03:24] broke one of them
[1:03:26] right but not so with us right not so
[1:03:28] with us the bible said jesus
[1:03:30] took the curse of the law praise god
[1:03:32] right he took that curse of the law so
[1:03:34] if we fall short we're not totally
[1:03:36] cursed or punished right we're not we're
[1:03:38] not rejected from the covenant
[1:03:40] if we make a mistake we go to father and
[1:03:42] say forgive me cleanse me in your blood
[1:03:44] i i fell short i'm not gonna hide my sin
[1:03:47] i'm gonna confess my sin and you're
[1:03:48] gonna cleanse me and i'm gonna walk in
[1:03:50] the light as you're in the light
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:57] okay chapter 28 this is beautiful
[1:04:01] let me see where okay
[1:04:05] so let's read one to 14. i know it's a
[1:04:06] lot of reading but this is good
[1:04:08] i remember reading this the first time i
[1:04:09] just kept underlining you know if you're
[1:04:11] blessed you're blessed you're blessed
[1:04:12] not and that was curse curse
[1:04:15] like there's i think there's 40 some
[1:04:17] curses from verses 15
[1:04:19] there's more curses than blessings in
[1:04:20] other words
[1:04:22] uh
[1:04:23] well and we know why you know because
[1:04:25] man it was the law is the school teacher
[1:04:27] the law teaches us wow we are really
[1:04:29] sinful we need god living in our souls
[1:04:31] in order to overcome praise god that's
[1:04:34] what he's trying to teach us we can't do
[1:04:36] it on our own we've got to have jesus
[1:04:38] christ living in our soul praise god
[1:04:40] he must he must become our soul nature
[1:04:43] right he must fill us and seal us and
[1:04:46] circumcise the things of the world away
[1:04:48] and then we can walk like a true true
[1:04:50] child of god who walks by the spirit and
[1:04:52] not by the flesh
[1:04:57] deuteronomy 28 1 and this should come to
[1:04:59] pass if thou shalt hearken diligently
[1:05:03] unto the voice of the lord thy god that
[1:05:06] sounds familiar i preached this from
[1:05:07] someone's on that last year diligence
[1:05:10] right diligence that means eager eager
[1:05:12] to obey eager to hear what the preacher
[1:05:14] says right eager to put it into action
[1:05:19] if thou shalt hearken diligently into
[1:05:21] the voice of the lord thy god to observe
[1:05:23] and to do all his commands which i
[1:05:24] command you this day that the lord thy
[1:05:25] god will set thee on high above all the
[1:05:28] nations of the earth he's done that with
[1:05:29] america
[1:05:31] because there were so many believers
[1:05:32] right and the early founders or so many
[1:05:35] believers god did raise up america
[1:05:38] because remember it's like a anti-type
[1:05:40] of israel
[1:05:43] verse 2
[1:05:44] i love this look at this man and all the
[1:05:46] blessings shall come on thee and
[1:05:48] overtake thee i'm just overtaken with
[1:05:50] blessings right that's really what a
[1:05:52] holy ghost christian can be
[1:05:54] i'm just caught up in all the blessings
[1:05:56] in church sometimes satan likes to
[1:05:58] distract us from being thankful for all
[1:05:59] of our blessings
[1:06:01] but if we look at our lives let's look
[1:06:03] honestly we are covered in blessings
[1:06:05] we
[1:06:06] you know your uh your cupboards are full
[1:06:08] right anybody got has anybody got any
[1:06:10] empty cupboards if so let me know after
[1:06:11] church we'll try to fill those with some
[1:06:14] canned goods and
[1:06:15] we'll try to but really
[1:06:17] many times we have so many blessings
[1:06:19] because god is faithful to his word
[1:06:22] he's honored your obedience when you
[1:06:24] diligently hearken unto him he honors
[1:06:26] your obedience
[1:06:28] because he's faithful
[1:06:32] and also like this the only time our
[1:06:34] children never lack anything is when dad
[1:06:35] forgets to go to the grocery store
[1:06:38] right
[1:06:39] or just too busy that's the only time
[1:06:40] we've ever lacked anything you know
[1:06:42] sometimes we run out of fruit and that
[1:06:44] you're like daddy you can go get fruit
[1:06:45] i'm like it's not because we don't have
[1:06:47] the money it's because dad don't have
[1:06:49] the time
[1:06:50] or don't make the time
[1:06:52] and that's that's what i would expect i
[1:06:54] would expect reading this chapter that
[1:06:56] if i've got the holy ghost and i'm
[1:06:57] living the promised land and god has
[1:06:59] diligently blessed me i'll lack nothing
[1:07:01] that's good
[1:07:02] i have everything i need because god has
[1:07:05] his favor upon me praise god
[1:07:08] because that's what he promised to do
[1:07:10] church you didn't make the covenant i
[1:07:12] didn't make the covenant god made the
[1:07:14] covenant amen
[1:07:15] and god is going to keep his word
[1:07:17] hallelujah
[1:07:19] i didn't start discovering it he brought
[1:07:21] he brought me he invited me to it praise
[1:07:23] god
[1:07:25] he's the one that did it so we have a
[1:07:27] right to believe it and to act upon it
[1:07:29] and expect god to back up his word
[1:07:32] and he surely does and the church said
[1:07:34] amen he surely backs up his word
[1:07:37] but it seems diligence
[1:07:39] in obeying and observing all the
[1:07:41] commands
[1:07:42] and then god's blessings will just
[1:07:44] overflow you like a flood
[1:07:47] if thou shalt hearken under the voice of
[1:07:49] the lord thy god
[1:07:50] you gotta hearken we gotta listen we
[1:07:52] gotta obey
[1:07:54] verse three blessed shalt thou be in the
[1:07:56] city
[1:07:57] and blessed shalt thou be in the field
[1:08:02] right so city life is that's where they
[1:08:04] would sell their goods right but the
[1:08:06] field is where they would plant their
[1:08:07] goods so wherever you plant or wherever
[1:08:10] you sell you're going to be blessed in
[1:08:11] both places
[1:08:13] verse 4 blessed shall be the fruit of
[1:08:15] thy body
[1:08:16] and the fruit of thy ground so your
[1:08:18] children and your crops and the fruit of
[1:08:20] the cattle
[1:08:22] the increase of thine kind and the
[1:08:23] flocks of thy sheep blessed shall be thy
[1:08:26] basket
[1:08:27] and thy store thy storehouses
[1:08:31] see you got lots in your baskets you got
[1:08:33] a lot in your storehouse
[1:08:35] why because you love
[1:08:36] god you you really you really care
[1:08:40] you're not about playing church you're
[1:08:42] about being the church amen
[1:08:44] right
[1:08:45] because you diligently hearken and you
[1:08:47] are the church you are
[1:08:49] god's bond jesus's body on this earth
[1:08:51] then he pours out his blessings on you
[1:08:53] because you're going to exalt you above
[1:08:55] everyone else
[1:08:58] praise god
[1:09:00] verse six mind this is beautiful
[1:09:05] ah yeah six blessed shalt thou be when
[1:09:07] thou comest in and when thou shalt
[1:09:11] be when thou goest out see when you come
[1:09:13] in the house when you leave the house
[1:09:15] verse seven the lord shall cause thine
[1:09:17] enemies that rise up against thee to be
[1:09:19] smitten before thy face they shall come
[1:09:21] out against thee one way and flee before
[1:09:24] thee seven ways
[1:09:26] in other words there's not going to be a
[1:09:28] battle you can't overcome if you
[1:09:30] diligently obey god's word
[1:09:33] in other words there's not going to be
[1:09:34] an enemy that just stays there week
[1:09:36] after week i can't defeat him i can't
[1:09:39] defeat it it's so hard
[1:09:41] no the bible says if you diligently
[1:09:43] hearken then that enemy is going to just
[1:09:45] go any other way it's it's gonna choose
[1:09:47] one of those seven ways right and it's
[1:09:49] gonna it's gonna flee before you right
[1:09:51] because god has made you an overcomer
[1:09:53] and because you're you're living by the
[1:09:56] power that god put inside of you
[1:09:58] you're taking his power acting upon it
[1:10:00] so all the enemies have to flee
[1:10:03] praise god
[1:10:07] and remember that ties in with i just
[1:10:09] scripture just came to me there resist
[1:10:11] satan and he'll flee
[1:10:13] so when the enemy comes it's not like
[1:10:14] hey enemy come on i'd like to try some
[1:10:16] of that or i like to i like to think
[1:10:18] about that i like to i like to act upon
[1:10:20] that i don't like to do that no it's
[1:10:22] resist the enemy then he flees amen
[1:10:25] right the same the same old uh new
[1:10:28] testament principle resist satan he'll
[1:10:30] flee we have that same promise today
[1:10:32] praise god amen they had it naturally
[1:10:35] we've got it spiritually there are times
[1:10:37] we have natural enemies don't get me
[1:10:38] wrong there's times there's times for
[1:10:40] war
[1:10:41] okay verse
[1:10:42] nine no i'm sorry
[1:10:45] verse eight the lord shall command the
[1:10:46] blessing upon thee and thy storehouses
[1:10:49] and in all that thou settest on hand to
[1:10:50] do and he shall bless thee in the land
[1:10:52] which the lord thy god giveth thee the
[1:10:54] lord shall establish thee and holy
[1:10:55] people unto himself and he has sworn
[1:10:57] unto thee if thou shalt keep the
[1:10:59] commandments of the lord thy god and
[1:11:00] walk in his ways and all people of the
[1:11:02] earth shall see that thou art called by
[1:11:05] the name of the lord and they shall be
[1:11:06] afraid of thee do you know which nation
[1:11:08] on earth has the most people trying to
[1:11:10] get in to become citizens
[1:11:13] america they're not lined up in russia
[1:11:16] right
[1:11:16] they're not lined up in china
[1:11:18] trying to get in they're not lined up
[1:11:20] and now maybe some of canada i don't
[1:11:22] know how many kids
[1:11:23] but the majority of them on a waiting
[1:11:26] list trying to get into this place
[1:11:28] praise god because of the freedom
[1:11:30] because of the laws that have
[1:11:32] established the godly laws that have
[1:11:33] been established in this nation oh i'm
[1:11:35] so thankful to live here by god's grace
[1:11:38] of course if god would have chose
[1:11:39] somewhere else i would have rejoiced in
[1:11:40] that too i still would have been an
[1:11:41] overcomer right no matter where you god
[1:11:44] would have placed you you would have
[1:11:45] been an overcomer praise god amen
[1:11:47] so we have to especially believe in you
[1:11:49] we in america we have to overcome that
[1:11:51] lukewarm spirit because we are we see
[1:11:53] rich and increased with goods we've got
[1:11:55] to truly overcome that and we got to
[1:11:57] depend on god more than we depend on
[1:11:59] anything else
[1:12:00] amen
[1:12:03] that so god chose us to do that amen so
[1:12:06] when we see the blessings increase we
[1:12:07] see the food increase and the clothes
[1:12:09] and
[1:12:10] and we see everything increase we don't
[1:12:12] get happy about that but we rejoice in
[1:12:14] what god has given to us but we also
[1:12:16] know god takes it away we'll still bless
[1:12:18] his name
[1:12:20] amen
[1:12:23] our confidence our trust is never in the
[1:12:26] blessings
[1:12:27] it's in the god of the blessings
[1:12:31] it's never in
[1:12:32] the natural things because remember paul
[1:12:34] told timothy he said teach those rich
[1:12:36] men not to trust in their riches
[1:12:39] because they're fleeting right they're
[1:12:40] fleeting
[1:12:42] do not trust in earthly riches but trust
[1:12:44] in the living god who's gracious to
[1:12:46] provide all things that we have need of
[1:12:48] amen all right now
[1:12:54] see that's why god's blessed america
[1:12:56] because of the commandments of the lord
[1:12:57] now look at verse 11 here it is the lord
[1:12:59] shall make thee plenteous in goods
[1:13:01] in the fruit of thy body
[1:13:03] and the fruit of thy cattle and in the
[1:13:05] fruit of thy ground in the land which
[1:13:06] the lord swear unt to thy fathers to
[1:13:08] give thee in the 1800s i can't i just
[1:13:10] read a book on it a couple well last
[1:13:12] year
[1:13:14] europeans visited the united states in
[1:13:16] the 1800s and they saw all the goods and
[1:13:19] they were blown away and they coined
[1:13:21] this term it's called american
[1:13:23] exceptionalism
[1:13:26] so the europeans right they had all the
[1:13:28] they had all the inventions before
[1:13:30] america had it right before the
[1:13:31] americans right
[1:13:33] so they come over in the 1800s you know
[1:13:34] they've been a country for less than 100
[1:13:36] years and they want to see how they do
[1:13:38] it
[1:13:38] and this you can you can look it up look
[1:13:40] up american exceptionalism
[1:13:42] and all these european guys are like how
[1:13:44] are they doing they're doing more with
[1:13:46] less
[1:13:48] we have let we had less people in
[1:13:49] america we had less resources we found
[1:13:52] and now we're finding more like oil and
[1:13:54] all these
[1:13:55] all these great natural gas we're
[1:13:56] finding all kinds of resources here in
[1:13:58] america
[1:13:59] but in the 1800s we were doing more with
[1:14:02] less and the whole world had to uh admit
[1:14:05] it why because god said he said i will
[1:14:08] cause your goods to be plenteous if you
[1:14:11] diligently hearken unto my commands amen
[1:14:14] look it up it's called american
[1:14:16] exceptionalism
[1:14:18] israel's got the same thing going on
[1:14:19] today they have uh some of the most
[1:14:22] patents in in all the world this tiny
[1:14:24] little country with eight or nine
[1:14:26] million people that the most patents the
[1:14:28] the best technologies
[1:14:30] because god is on their side
[1:14:35] so i'm just like i said church i'm
[1:14:37] amazed at many of these natural
[1:14:39] blessings spoken to israel it's like god
[1:14:41] even applies them to
[1:14:43] natural nations in the new testament
[1:14:45] right even although we're not under the
[1:14:46] old covenant but yet a lot of these
[1:14:48] blessings seem to carry over
[1:14:51] and if we diligently hearken to the word
[1:14:53] of god
[1:14:54] god will provide everything
[1:14:57] amen
[1:15:00] everybody enjoying this tonight amen
[1:15:04] i hope so hope it's a blessing to your
[1:15:05] church it's been a great blessing to me
[1:15:07] verse 10 and all the all the purple all
[1:15:09] the people of the earth rather shall see
[1:15:11] that thou art called by the name of the
[1:15:12] lord and they shall be afraid of thee
[1:15:14] verse 11 and the lord shall make thee
[1:15:16] plenteous and goods and the fruit of thy
[1:15:18] body okay the fruit of thy cattle fruit
[1:15:19] of thy ground the lamb which the lord
[1:15:21] swear unto thy fathers to give thee the
[1:15:23] lord shall open i love this unto thee
[1:15:25] his good treasure
[1:15:27] the heaven
[1:15:29] to give the rain unto thy land in his
[1:15:31] season and to bless
[1:15:33] all the work of thine hand and thou
[1:15:35] shalt lend unto many nations and thou
[1:15:37] shalt not borrow boy we really struggled
[1:15:39] there right that's what that's one area
[1:15:41] america struggled in right
[1:15:43] with uh was it now 20 trillion in debt i
[1:15:46] can't remember how much it is there
[1:15:50] so it's interesting this is so
[1:15:52] interesting god blesses many of our
[1:15:54] natural things
[1:15:55] but then with this disobedience
[1:15:58] he's caused us to borrow
[1:16:01] so that's that's uh interesting now good
[1:16:03] treasure i like it that's the good
[1:16:04] treasure the good treasure is the rain
[1:16:05] right and the crops and everything but
[1:16:07] the bible says now we have treasure in
[1:16:09] earth and vessels the word of god
[1:16:11] written upon the fleshly tables of our
[1:16:14] hearts
[1:16:15] amen god's treasure living in you and i
[1:16:18] the god's presence that holy spirit that
[1:16:20] you feel the love that you feel the
[1:16:22] peace that you feel that's god's
[1:16:23] treasure for you and i
[1:16:25] amen
[1:16:27] treasurer's not up on a shelf right the
[1:16:28] treasure's in your soul
[1:16:31] amen
[1:16:32] that's spiritual treasure
[1:16:34] now 13 and 14 is where the where we end
[1:16:37] with the blessings
[1:16:39] and the lord shall make thee the head
[1:16:41] and not the tail
[1:16:42] now the one preacher i like derek prince
[1:16:44] he says the head makes the decisions the
[1:16:46] tales just drug around for the ride
[1:16:50] and he says are you making the decisions
[1:16:52] or do you feel like you're being drug
[1:16:53] around i'm i'm a slave to this i'm a
[1:16:55] slave to that now we all feel like
[1:16:56] slaves to work but we got to work right
[1:16:58] you know
[1:16:59] we all got to work i beg god i beg god
[1:17:02] for millions of dollars
[1:17:04] so i don't have to work and i can just
[1:17:05] preach full time i beg god for different
[1:17:06] things
[1:17:08] but i see his blessing in my current
[1:17:10] life praise god
[1:17:11] i've just kind of asked the immature
[1:17:13] prayers i'll say like that
[1:17:18] but see he says when you're a believer
[1:17:20] and you diligently obey you're not the
[1:17:22] tail you're not getting drug around
[1:17:24] you're the head
[1:17:27] i like this because the bible says you
[1:17:28] redeem the time
[1:17:31] see when you're the head you determine
[1:17:33] what happens throughout the day
[1:17:35] you don't get drugged around by you know
[1:17:37] your work doesn't determine your your
[1:17:39] spiritual relationship with god you
[1:17:40] determine it
[1:17:41] praise god
[1:17:43] that's why you put god first right
[1:17:44] that's why you got a morning routine
[1:17:45] while you seek the lord first because if
[1:17:47] not then you're a slave you're being
[1:17:49] dragged around by your schedule instead
[1:17:51] of you taking the work around and
[1:17:53] determine what's going to happen the
[1:17:54] rest of the day because you started the
[1:17:56] day in his presence
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:00] hallelujah praise god
[1:18:02] you're the head not the tail you're the
[1:18:04] head
[1:18:09] see you you're led by the holy spirit
[1:18:11] right you you give god preeminence you
[1:18:13] put god first you make the decision this
[1:18:15] is how the day is going to go by god's
[1:18:17] grace unless something happens i'm going
[1:18:18] to put god first seek god first this is
[1:18:21] how it's going to go
[1:18:23] and thou shalt be above only and thou
[1:18:25] shalt not be beneath ever feel like
[1:18:27] you're so that's when we when we get and
[1:18:29] cursed as we get out of the will of god
[1:18:30] we feel like we're underneath everything
[1:18:32] we're just we're just everything's piled
[1:18:34] on top of us right
[1:18:36] everything's just
[1:18:37] but when you're walking obedience you're
[1:18:39] on top of it
[1:18:40] praise god
[1:18:42] you're on top of the problems you're on
[1:18:43] top of your responsibility see that
[1:18:46] you're not under the weight of them
[1:18:49] but you're ruling over them praise god
[1:18:52] amen i like that church
[1:18:56] what promises now who wants to be the
[1:18:58] tail in here and who wants to be
[1:18:59] underneath the weight of all these
[1:19:01] burdens
[1:19:02] who wants to be on the bottom ring you
[1:19:05] know
[1:19:07] if we have the ability to be on top if
[1:19:10] we have the calling to be the head let's
[1:19:12] let's live it
[1:19:13] let's do it
[1:19:15] let's live like we ought to live as a
[1:19:17] real christian let's possess the
[1:19:19] promises of god amen
[1:19:23] this is for promised land people though
[1:19:26] amen this is this is for promised land
[1:19:28] this is the people that are possessing
[1:19:29] the land praise god
[1:19:32] the lord will make you the head
[1:19:34] not the tail
[1:19:36] you'll be above not below if
[1:19:38] if thou see the if if thou hearken unto
[1:19:41] the commandments of the lord thy god
[1:19:42] which i command you this day to observe
[1:19:44] and do them
[1:19:46] and thou shalt not go aside from any of
[1:19:48] the words which i command thee this day
[1:19:51] to the right hand or the left to go
[1:19:53] after other gods to serve them
[1:19:56] praise god
[1:19:58] now i want to skip ahead the curses are
[1:20:00] here
[1:20:02] but i want to out uh 15 to 68 we're not
[1:20:04] going to go through all these
[1:20:06] i want to skip ahead i remember being
[1:20:08] before the message brother amen i was a
[1:20:09] christian i remember listening to john
[1:20:11] piper he's like a he's a reformed
[1:20:13] preacher kind of like a baptist
[1:20:16] i'm not sure exactly which denomination
[1:20:18] he goes to but i remember him preaching
[1:20:19] these verses and it just it shocked me
[1:20:22] even before the message i was shocked to
[1:20:24] hear this god was gonna curse israel if
[1:20:27] they didn't serve him with joyfulness
[1:20:29] and gladness of heart
[1:20:31] there's something to be said for being
[1:20:33] happy
[1:20:34] right
[1:20:35] if you're not happy you're probably not
[1:20:38] in contact with god
[1:20:40] you've shut him out of fellowship
[1:20:43] because god is god curses israel because
[1:20:46] they didn't come to church with joy and
[1:20:48] gladness
[1:20:49] right they they didn't serve they didn't
[1:20:50] wake up every day and say thank you lord
[1:20:53] hallelujah i'm so grateful for these
[1:20:54] blessings they're cursed because of
[1:20:56] their attitude
[1:20:58] their rotten attitude
[1:21:01] may god help us to be positive praise
[1:21:03] god
[1:21:04] count our blessings but look at this
[1:21:06] these i remember these i remember buying
[1:21:08] the cd i mailed it in i think it was
[1:21:09] before the internet or maybe right after
[1:21:11] the internet started but i mailed in and
[1:21:13] bought these cds i listened to them i
[1:21:15] was shocked by what i heard this man
[1:21:17] look at verse 44
[1:21:19] he shall lend to thee and thou shalt not
[1:21:21] lend to him he shall be the head and
[1:21:22] thou shalt
[1:21:24] be the tail see we don't want to do that
[1:21:25] verse 45 moreover all these curses
[1:21:28] should come upon me and shall pursue
[1:21:29] thee and overtake thee until thou be
[1:21:31] destroyed because thou hearkenest not
[1:21:33] unto the voice of the lord thy god to
[1:21:35] keep his commandments and his statutes
[1:21:37] which he commandeth thee and they shall
[1:21:38] be upon thee for a sign and a wonder and
[1:21:41] upon thy seed forever
[1:21:44] that's really serious that's your
[1:21:46] children right that's from generation to
[1:21:48] generation
[1:21:50] for those that disobey god's word
[1:21:53] verse 46
[1:21:54] i'm sorry verse 47. here it is right
[1:21:56] here
[1:21:57] why did they fall into this curse
[1:21:59] because
[1:22:00] thou service not the lord thy god with
[1:22:03] joyfulness
[1:22:06] and
[1:22:07] with gladness
[1:22:09] of heart
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:11] i don't know if you got to wake up and
[1:22:12] just put on a happy song
[1:22:15] but you and i need to be happy
[1:22:20] they're cursed imagine not only them
[1:22:22] church but their children are cursed all
[1:22:25] because they stop seeing the joy in
[1:22:28] god's word
[1:22:29] there's so much joy in here every all
[1:22:32] the i mean there's a couple pages of
[1:22:33] curses right but a lot of this thing is
[1:22:35] blessings
[1:22:36] look you go to that blessing
[1:22:38] james and corinthians and acts i mean
[1:22:40] look at all these blessings
[1:22:43] but because of their attitude all they
[1:22:45] saw was struggle and all they saw was
[1:22:48] god with a stick like they say
[1:22:50] all right i don't mean to say that with
[1:22:51] the wrong attitude but people that leave
[1:22:52] the message god
[1:22:54] programs god just carried a big stick he
[1:22:56] does carry mixtape but he also
[1:22:58] carries a lot of blessings in the other
[1:22:59] hand
[1:23:00] right he also carries a lot of great
[1:23:02] blessings
[1:23:03] he's got a storehouse and with that
[1:23:04] other hand i think he opens the
[1:23:06] storehouse and he pours out all the
[1:23:07] blessings with that hand he's got the
[1:23:09] stick in the other one
[1:23:12] he does
[1:23:14] because thou servants not the lord thy
[1:23:16] god with joyfulness and with gladness of
[1:23:18] heart this is for the promised land
[1:23:19] people
[1:23:20] for the abundance of all things amen
[1:23:23] you got how many got lots of clothes in
[1:23:25] their house
[1:23:26] a couple of you okay
[1:23:28] how many got lots of food on your in
[1:23:29] your house
[1:23:30] and sometimes we're low
[1:23:31] but most of the time we got it
[1:23:33] i got lots of how many got money in the
[1:23:35] bank so you can pay off some bills
[1:23:38] so the bible says if you have an
[1:23:39] abundance we must be joyful and have a
[1:23:42] glad heart
[1:23:44] just just because of abundance
[1:23:46] praise god
[1:23:47] the very fact that you have plenty of
[1:23:49] things should make you happy and joyful
[1:23:52] praise god
[1:23:54] and we all battle it right we all battle
[1:23:56] feeling sorry for ourselves
[1:23:57] um
[1:23:59] i told you this before but i remember
[1:24:00] crying when we bought the house because
[1:24:01] we had a garage i just cried
[1:24:03] oh i thought i never thought i'd have a
[1:24:05] garage
[1:24:07] all the blessings you know
[1:24:08] and then we fixed our downstairs i
[1:24:10] remember crying when i went into my
[1:24:11] prayer closet
[1:24:12] we got i got my own office now
[1:24:15] my own room you know to study and preach
[1:24:18] it was just it was just amazing i never
[1:24:20] thought i'd have something like that but
[1:24:22] that shouldn't make me prideful and
[1:24:23] arrogant and want more it should make me
[1:24:25] want more of god amen
[1:24:27] then you want to obey more of god's word
[1:24:31] and serve him with joyfulness
[1:24:33] and gladness of heart i'm going to tell
[1:24:35] about amen amen said he couldn't fall
[1:24:37] asleep last night to what 4 am
[1:24:39] and he don't tell me these things
[1:24:40] because he knows i'm going to tell him
[1:24:41] he couldn't fall asleep till 5am he was
[1:24:43] so excited to come to church today
[1:24:46] now
[1:24:47] that's i pre and i know you didn't share
[1:24:49] it with me for that reason but i thought
[1:24:50] mine
[1:24:52] that's what we all need
[1:24:54] right that first love that joyfulness
[1:24:57] and in church i was watching him sing
[1:24:59] tonight you know you see that big ol
[1:25:01] i love that that makes me smile
[1:25:04] we should be thank we should have
[1:25:05] joyfulness and gladness of heart for the
[1:25:08] abundance that all that god's done for
[1:25:10] us
[1:25:15] this makes me think by the man when you
[1:25:17] were kind of like a stranger i took you
[1:25:18] into my house you know
[1:25:20] and now maybe god can have you and your
[1:25:22] wife do that sometime you know
[1:25:24] because you got kicked out of his house
[1:25:25] he couldn't live with my wife tonight
[1:25:26] and the kids there but he wasn't a
[1:25:28] stranger but you know we took him in
[1:25:30] that's we want to have like that idea
[1:25:32] all the time and we want to be able to
[1:25:33] see who's hungry who's thirsty who needs
[1:25:35] a place to stay we want to have that
[1:25:37] love we want to have that love for
[1:25:38] mankind because we're so blessed we have
[1:25:40] such an abundance we want to be able to
[1:25:42] help other people have what they need
[1:25:45] praise god
[1:25:48] because you didn't serve god with
[1:25:49] joyfulness gladness of heart for the
[1:25:50] abundance of all things verse 48
[1:25:52] therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies
[1:25:56] if you will not serve god for all the
[1:25:58] blessings you'll serve your addictions
[1:26:01] that's what is for us today right
[1:26:03] you'll serve that you will not lord over
[1:26:05] it and rebuke it and overcome it you'll
[1:26:07] serve it
[1:26:09] because you lost your let satan's take
[1:26:11] your joy right
[1:26:13] satan took your gladness your joy
[1:26:19] therefore thou shalt serve thine enemies
[1:26:21] which the lord thy god shall send
[1:26:23] against thee in hunger and thirst
[1:26:25] nakedness does that sound like matthew
[1:26:27] 25
[1:26:28] wow i just caught that right
[1:26:30] you fed me when i was hungry when i was
[1:26:31] thirsty and closed me when i was naked
[1:26:33] look at that
[1:26:34] my goodness
[1:26:36] and in want of all things
[1:26:40] so because we don't thank god for the
[1:26:41] abundance of all things and we can't
[1:26:43] even be happy about the natural blessing
[1:26:45] god said i'm taken all away
[1:26:47] and you're gonna
[1:26:48] suffer because you can't be thankful for
[1:26:51] the natural blessing i'm thankful for
[1:26:52] your job
[1:26:55] or your husband's job or your wife's job
[1:26:58] how many thankful for all that amen
[1:27:00] joyfulness gladness of heart
[1:27:03] lord for the abundance of all the things
[1:27:05] you've given to me thank you lord i'll
[1:27:07] serve you with joy i'll gladly go to
[1:27:09] church two times a week or three times a
[1:27:11] week or whatever i'll gladly do that
[1:27:13] because of all that you've done for me
[1:27:16] hallelujah praise god
[1:27:21] and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy
[1:27:24] neck see
[1:27:26] uh
[1:27:27] uh what's the word i'm looking for
[1:27:29] addiction slave
[1:27:34] upon thy neck until they have destroyed
[1:27:35] thee verse 49 the lord shall bring a
[1:27:37] nation against the uh the from far from
[1:27:40] the end of the earth and as swift as the
[1:27:41] eagle flag that was speaking of babylon
[1:27:43] a nation whose tongue thou shalt not
[1:27:45] understand
[1:27:50] how many can see how this is a pretty
[1:27:52] serious thing
[1:27:54] how many can see this in people's lives
[1:27:55] in your life too
[1:27:57] certainly
[1:27:59] certainly
[1:28:01] here's a quote i read this morning if
[1:28:03] people didn't have a chance to come back
[1:28:04] to second service
[1:28:07] the preacher said this i thought it was

[1:28:11] blessings and who says i don't quote
[1:28:12] people other than brother branham
[1:28:15] really you don't need to chase the
[1:28:16] blessing he said what you need to do is
[1:28:18] meet the conditions

[1:28:40] the blessing he said the over oh the
[1:28:42] blessings are going to overtake you
[1:28:44] they're going to come searching for you
[1:28:46] like the goodness of god we sing god's
[1:28:48] goodness is just running after me praise
[1:28:50] god amen i just didn't realize that's
[1:28:51] all right now that's what the song's
[1:28:52] talking about
[1:28:53] the blessings overtake you praise god
[1:28:57] they're coming after me all the time
[1:28:58] praise god
[1:29:01] oh my we just refinanced our house and
[1:29:03] we got another check in the mail just
[1:29:05] unexpectedly you know
[1:29:06] the blessings are just running after us
[1:29:09] just running after us just god's mercy

[1:29:13] keep the right attitude
[1:29:16] lord you give and you take away blessed
[1:29:18] be the name of the lord
[1:29:21] see we just got to chase i'm sorry we
[1:29:23] don't chase the blessing you got to
[1:29:24] chase god in prayer
[1:29:26] in the morning
[1:29:27] just meet the conditions god will take
[1:29:30] care of the blessings
[1:29:31] i know that was such a beaut when i
[1:29:33] heard that i was like what i thought i
[1:29:35] got to write that down
[1:29:36] so i emailed to myself i thought you'd
[1:29:37] really appreciate that
[1:29:40] now let me close with this i'm already
[1:29:41] at about an hour you still enjoying it
[1:29:44] all right good i feel good spirit in
[1:29:45] here tonight fairies god
[1:29:48] every night
[1:29:50] uh
[1:29:51] now there's just a few in here i thought
[1:29:52] i'd pull out
[1:29:56] okay uh but just the next slide there
[1:29:58] are exceptions like i talked about the
[1:30:00] beginnings i don't wanna
[1:30:01] i don't wanna act like there's never
[1:30:02] exceptions right like remember david
[1:30:04] said i'm promised three score in 10
[1:30:06] years if i obey god that's 70 years and
[1:30:09] maybe 80 if god's merciful but jesus
[1:30:11] only lived 33 and a half right
[1:30:13] because he had a he had an exception
[1:30:14] there was exception to that god had a
[1:30:16] certain testimony for his life
[1:30:20] so i don't want to always put it off
[1:30:21] like oh it's just always a picnic
[1:30:22] serving god but
[1:30:24] you know apparently church if we read
[1:30:26] our bibles there's going to be some good
[1:30:27] times if we obey god
[1:30:29] we're not going to be lacking clothes
[1:30:32] food
[1:30:33] work
[1:30:34] we're gonna have everything we need
[1:30:36] by god's grace
[1:30:38] you mean god can feed eight children
[1:30:41] in 2020 you mean that oh yeah yeah
[1:30:44] he's mighty he's mighty to save
[1:30:47] i've been talking to people lately i
[1:30:48] remember the hmong thing i met a mom
[1:30:49] that had 11 kids i'm like i said bless
[1:30:52] your heart sister i said you're one of
[1:30:53] the most obedient women i know to that
[1:30:55] command
[1:30:57] she's like thank you
[1:30:59] eleven
[1:31:02] uh
[1:31:03] so it's not all picnic right there's
[1:31:04] still battles
[1:31:06] but see after the battle we enjoy the
[1:31:08] victory praise god
[1:31:10] like abraham after the battle he
[1:31:12] fellowships with melchizedek amen
[1:31:16] oh glory hallelujah after jesus battled
[1:31:18] satan he got visitation from angels
[1:31:22] and he enjoyed the blessings of god
[1:31:28] so health is pointed out church
[1:31:31] specifically in deuteronomy 28 21 now
[1:31:34] this says if they disobey they have
[1:31:36] pestilences and think about the
[1:31:37] coronavirus you know
[1:31:39] remember sometimes god it says verse 21
[1:31:41] the lord shall make the pestilence
[1:31:42] cleave unto thee until they have
[1:31:44] consumed thee from off the land wither
[1:31:46] thou goes to possess it
[1:31:49] tim pruitt i'll share this quick tim
[1:31:50] pruitt shared a testimony there's
[1:31:52] families in his church that went to a
[1:31:53] family doctor he the man was a sinner he
[1:31:55] used to cuss but when chronovox came
[1:31:58] that doctor who cussed
[1:31:59] he got coronavirus and he died six times
[1:32:04] and each time when he died they were
[1:32:06] able to bring him back
[1:32:09] and so eventually he was in a coma the
[1:32:11] doctor woke up
[1:32:12] and he said the first thing he told the
[1:32:14] other doctor was hey i saw my brother
[1:32:16] come to me six times in visions
[1:32:20] and tell me to repent of my sins
[1:32:24] and he did and then the doctor told him
[1:32:26] you died six times
[1:32:29] and jesus was giving you a chance at
[1:32:31] eternal life i'll say like this six
[1:32:33] chances
[1:32:35] and brother tim brewer said the families
[1:32:36] went back to his practice and instead of
[1:32:39] hearing the rock and roll of the office
[1:32:40] it's piano jesus
[1:32:43] instrumental
[1:32:44] and then they walk in instead of
[1:32:46] greeting the doctor and he's custom
[1:32:47] swearing it's god bless you how are you
[1:32:49] today
[1:32:52] see there's curses right sometimes these
[1:32:54] curses turn out to be blessings
[1:32:58] the pestilence it claimed i don't know
[1:32:59] how long he was sick i can't remember
[1:33:00] from tim pruitt's testimony in the
[1:33:02] families in the church there
[1:33:04] but he died six times each time god sent
[1:33:06] him out repent repent
[1:33:08] and then finally wakes up and he repents
[1:33:10] i'll talk about grace church
[1:33:11] i just thought i'd share that with you
[1:33:12] to see god is still saving people and
[1:33:14] remember the message this morning
[1:33:15] remember the plum tree in the apple tree
[1:33:17] i told that story sister karen this
[1:33:18] morning but i saw the vision of the two
[1:33:20] trees right one was trinity one one was
[1:33:21] oneness
[1:33:22] brother ram said i was catching the
[1:33:24] fruits and rejoicing at all the souls
[1:33:26] saved that were trinitarians
[1:33:30] he said it was so glorious he said he
[1:33:32] was hugging the cross but he woke up
[1:33:33] from the vision
[1:33:34] thank god for thank god that foolish
[1:33:36] virgins will be saved amen
[1:33:39] it makes it makes him want to hug the
[1:33:42] cross just for somebody one person to
[1:33:44] say i'm sorry jesus and they might not
[1:33:46] know everything we know but it makes
[1:33:48] brother i am rejoicing when i hug the
[1:33:50] cross thank you for the cross
[1:33:52] that anybody could be saved no matter
[1:33:54] what you believe as long as you repent
[1:33:56] except jesus christ you can be saved it
[1:33:58] ought to make us rejoice too
[1:34:02] so health
[1:34:03] is a result you lose it right it's a
[1:34:06] blessing but it's a you lose it and then
[1:34:07] john 3 1 12 says i would above all that
[1:34:10] to prosper and be in health
[1:34:13] as your soul prospers right
[1:34:16] so as as we get stronger brothers and
[1:34:18] sisters as we get stronger in our souls
[1:34:20] our bodies should remain healthy too
[1:34:22] right
[1:34:24] i'm seeing growth in my soul i'm seeing
[1:34:26] more devotion to god i'm seeing more
[1:34:29] love to god and then we should also see
[1:34:31] the same in our body i'm bringing my
[1:34:32] body into more obedience to the word of
[1:34:35] god
[1:34:36] amen to that
[1:34:39] finances and plenty we saw in verses 8
[1:34:42] 11 through 12
[1:34:44] reproduction with children deuteronomy 8
[1:34:46] 4 i'm sorry was it 28 for yeah the fruit
[1:34:48] of your body
[1:34:50] now today a lot of people want to have
[1:34:52] abortions right or have surgery so they
[1:34:54] don't have to have all these blessings
[1:34:55] but god said it was a blessing
[1:34:57] god said it was a blessing
[1:35:01] mercy goodness
[1:35:02] uh and all your work he said all your
[1:35:05] work will be blessed
[1:35:07] like i like karen's testimony about that
[1:35:09] amazon job
[1:35:11] fits her schedule fits right in the
[1:35:13] family helps the family provides the
[1:35:15] needs of the family i thought that was
[1:35:16] such a good thing god god specializes
[1:35:18] who would have thought that god would
[1:35:20] have done that you know you can work if
[1:35:22] you get done early it's like you're
[1:35:23] making extra money
[1:35:25] there's just so many blessings our god
[1:35:27] is bountiful and he's gracious and he
[1:35:30] wants to pour it out it will diligently
[1:35:31] harp into his voice
[1:35:34] now here's some exceptions real quick so
[1:35:36] we're trying to close but i'm having a
[1:35:38] hard time closing here
[1:35:40] so church exceptions exist
[1:35:43] for testing or testimonies not because
[1:35:45] you're cursed right
[1:35:47] so the health the exception is paul with
[1:35:50] his eyes already went over through i
[1:35:51] already went over that a couple
[1:35:52] wednesdays ago and just earlier today
[1:35:56] paul tried to say lord heal me
[1:35:59] my body my health should prosper just
[1:36:00] like my soul and jesus says no this is
[1:36:03] to keep you humble
[1:36:06] now finances and plenty i used to always
[1:36:08] think a christian should never beg but
[1:36:10] then i read the bible and lazarus was a
[1:36:12] banker
[1:36:14] and lazarus received bad things in his
[1:36:15] life but then jesus said when he got to
[1:36:17] there to abraham's bosom then he got the
[1:36:19] good things
[1:36:21] so there god i'll say this god needs a
[1:36:23] beggar to overcome
[1:36:25] right
[1:36:26] we're not told sister karen if he if he
[1:36:28] did anything wrong we're not told if he
[1:36:29] quit his job we're not told if his wife
[1:36:31] passed away our children right
[1:36:34] we're not told if his boss died we're
[1:36:35] not all we know is that he was a beggar
[1:36:38] and he was a child of abraham
[1:36:40] praise god
[1:36:43] so see and then paul paul said i've got
[1:36:45] one cloak now that was in second timothy
[1:36:46] but here he says i know what it's like
[1:36:48] to hunger i know it's like to have
[1:36:49] nothing he said but i'll be content in
[1:36:51] everything praise god because i can do
[1:36:54] all things through christ who
[1:36:55] strengthens me
[1:36:57] and then reproduction there's our
[1:36:59] exceptions paul said some people are
[1:37:00] just single right paul's singleness was
[1:37:02] an exception to that
[1:37:04] he wasn't called to have children
[1:37:07] for some reason
[1:37:10] and then all work yeah maybe with
[1:37:11] lazarus above
[1:37:13] okay let me find a place to close here
[1:37:18] um i think i'll just go to the what i
[1:37:21] want to finish with
[1:37:23] because the other ones i think i can uh
[1:37:25] well here let's go to this one let's go
[1:37:26] to speaking curses because that's one we
[1:37:27] got to be careful of
[1:37:32] okay we'll do this and then we'll close
[1:37:33] with the jesus takes away every curse
[1:37:36] so church
[1:37:37] jesus tells us to bless our enemies not
[1:37:39] to curse them so the new testament is
[1:37:41] mostly dealing with curses with our
[1:37:43] words we're not supposed to curse people
[1:37:45] or harm them with our words right
[1:37:48] and then he says he says but there are
[1:37:50] times we may curse things like jesus
[1:37:52] curse the fig tree
[1:37:55] and then i have lots of quotes i'm not
[1:37:56] going to share every night but brother
[1:37:57] ram will curse cancer in someone he'll
[1:37:59] curse it in the prayer line or he'll
[1:38:01] curse the female trouble he'll curse it
[1:38:03] because children of god have power to do
[1:38:05] that
[1:38:06] right
[1:38:07] and command that life he said i command
[1:38:09] that cancer to leave
[1:38:13] so jesus says
[1:38:14] love your you said you've heard it said
[1:38:16] love your enemy hatred i'm sure i love
[1:38:17] your neighbor hate your enemy but i say
[1:38:19] to you love your enemies bless them that
[1:38:20] curse you do good to them that hate you
[1:38:22] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:38:23] you and persecute you that ye may be the
[1:38:25] children of your father which is in
[1:38:26] heaven for he maketh the sun to rise on
[1:38:28] the evil and the good instead of the
[1:38:30] rain on the just and the unjust and the
[1:38:31] church said
[1:38:33] i'm almost done here james
[1:38:35] but the tongue can no man tame it's an
[1:38:38] unruly evil full of deadly poison there
[1:38:40] with we bless god and even the father we
[1:38:42] curse men which are made after the
[1:38:45] similitude of god out of the same mouth
[1:38:48] proceedeth blessings and cursings my
[1:38:50] brethren these things ought not so to be
[1:38:53] let's make sure we're blessing people
[1:38:54] praise god
[1:38:56] we bless god we say oh praise the lord
[1:38:58] let's make sure we keep blessing our
[1:38:59] enemies as well
[1:39:05] here's where here's where jesus said
[1:39:07] uh verily i send you if you have faith
[1:39:08] and doubt not ye shall not only do this
[1:39:10] which is done to the fig tree
[1:39:13] so you can curse things right
[1:39:16] but also if you shall say to this
[1:39:17] mountain be thou removed and cast in the
[1:39:19] sea it shall be done
[1:39:21] so it's kind of like you're cursing the
[1:39:22] mountain kind of like that but you're
[1:39:23] just commanded to lead
[1:39:25] i just heard a new uh revelation on that
[1:39:27] fig tree uh jesus didn't curse it
[1:39:29] because it was out of season jesus
[1:39:32] cursed it because before the actual
[1:39:34] fruit came on i guess there's like a
[1:39:35] little bud that has to come first
[1:39:37] and so jesus saw because there was no
[1:39:39] buds on the tree it's basically like a
[1:39:41] dead tree
[1:39:42] so then he cursed it because it didn't
[1:39:44] have that initial bud right jesus
[1:39:46] wouldn't curse something for nothing
[1:39:47] right
[1:39:49] it was didn't it failed to even bring
[1:39:50] forth that first bud
[1:39:53] right and that's
[1:39:54] let's bring forth more than
[1:39:55] justification church come on let's bring
[1:39:57] more than sanctification let's produce
[1:39:59] the baptism of the holy holy ghost and
[1:40:01] let's produce real fruit to the holy
[1:40:03] spirit
[1:40:04] that we're blessed
[1:40:08] he said what sort of things you desire
[1:40:10] or ask in prayer believing you shall
[1:40:12] receive
[1:40:15] uh yeah so just real quick
[1:40:16] there's a whole list of other things but
[1:40:18] the main thing church if you sense a
[1:40:19] curse is
[1:40:20] i'm afflicted or i'm a slave or i'm
[1:40:23] something like this and i'm not seeing
[1:40:24] the blessing i'm not abundant in my life
[1:40:28] satan needs to be exposed
[1:40:31] and you have to resist him
[1:40:34] and then diligently hearken
[1:40:36] and obey that's the only way to get
[1:40:38] god's blessings
[1:40:41] let's stand to our feet here what's the
[1:40:43] cure for every curse jesus christ is the
[1:40:45] cure for every curse
[1:40:47] cursing is everyone remember here's what
[1:40:48] we read earlier right paul says we know
[1:40:50] this curse
[1:40:52] but no but that no man is justified by
[1:40:54] the law in the sight of god for it is
[1:40:56] evident that just shall live by faith
[1:40:58] the law is not of faith the man that
[1:41:00] doeth them shall live therein thank god
[1:41:02] there's more to this christ hath
[1:41:03] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[1:41:06] being made a curse for us
[1:41:09] so i'll say like this the curse is gone
[1:41:12] jesus took it there's no more curse for
[1:41:14] you and i praise god
[1:41:16] we just get the blessing that he
[1:41:18] purchased praise god
[1:41:20] for it is written cursed is everyone
[1:41:22] that hangeth on a tree church you
[1:41:23] haven't have a right to say that i'm not
[1:41:25] cursed because jesus took my curse
[1:41:29] he took it he paid the penalty for my
[1:41:32] for that curse that was belong to me but
[1:41:35] jesus paid it and he set me free praise
[1:41:37] god
[1:41:38] why that the blessing
[1:41:40] not the curse that the blessing
[1:41:44] of abraham might come on
[1:41:46] bride of christ fellowship
[1:41:48] through jesus christ
[1:41:51] that we might receive the promise what
[1:41:54] is the blessing really the baptism of
[1:41:55] the holy ghost the promised land
[1:41:59] the promise of the spirit through faith
[1:42:02] revelation
[1:42:03] assurance trust
[1:42:05] in the will of god
[1:42:08] brother ram says he's praying
[1:42:10] when i see the token i'll pass over you
[1:42:11] it's a sign it's a sign that the price
[1:42:12] has been paid jesus paid the price and
[1:42:14] you receive it from him holding the
[1:42:16] token in your hand you have an assurance
[1:42:17] of resurrection you have the assurance
[1:42:19] that everything you have need of in this
[1:42:21] journey is provided in this token
[1:42:24] of his suffering at calvary
[1:42:27] when he met the price
[1:42:29] of every curse
[1:42:32] that could be put on you so i don't care
[1:42:34] what people try to put on us
[1:42:36] i don't care
[1:42:37] i really don't
[1:42:39] i don't care what any curse someone
[1:42:40] tries to put on me i'm blessed because
[1:42:42] i've got the token praise god
[1:42:45] i got the blessing of abraham the token
[1:42:51] he paid the price for every curse it can
[1:42:53] put on you that token speaks peace
[1:42:57] it speaks blessing
[1:43:00] not curse
[1:43:01] musicians if you'll come here i'll stop
[1:43:03] right there i gotta like i said i got a
[1:43:04] whole lot more slides there but let me
[1:43:06] stop for your sake
[1:43:08] our sake
[1:43:14] hope you enjoyed that by god's grace i
[1:43:15] think that's just such a beautiful
[1:43:16] thought
[1:43:18] [Music]
[1:43:24] really makes everything simple doesn't
[1:43:25] he
[1:43:27] we don't have to worry about the
[1:43:28] blessings and how the blessings are
[1:43:29] going together how am i going to have
[1:43:30] enough how is this going to don't you
