[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] we're going to write a commentary on the
[0:05] seven Church agents to S to all the
[0:07] world that we can and the Holy Spirit
[0:09] began to reveal to me to to warn the
[0:13] people and to place
[0:15] this greetings friends in the matchless
[0:18] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:21] purpose of this video is to answer the
[0:22] question our church ages in the Bible of
[0:26] course the answer is yes and anyone that
[0:28] knows my Ministry would know that I
[0:30] believe in the seven Gentile Church ages
[0:33] by God's grace I'll show Bible support
[0:36] for this but my name is Pastor Jesse
[0:38] Smith I pastored bride of Christ
[0:40] Fellowship here in akan Ohio for the
[0:42] last 17 years and I defend the Bible
[0:45] revelations that Jesus Christ revealed
[0:47] to his Prophet The Late William brandham
[0:49] who lived from 1909 to
[0:52] 1965 recently as I've listened to
[0:55] podcasts and videos of the people that
[0:57] have left the message I call them
[0:58] brother Ram's accusers
[1:00] I've heard numerous people say the
[1:02] church ages are not in the Bible and
[1:04] Friends it Grieves my spirit and just
[1:06] shocks me that these people cannot find
[1:08] the church ages in the Bible so I
[1:11] thought I'd make this video by the grace
[1:13] of God as a help hopefully to them and
[1:15] anyone else who has questions about
[1:18] whether or not the church ages are in
[1:20] the Bible most of the proof on this
[1:23] subject came from my studies and what I
[1:26] wrote in my 2021 book it's in chapter 7
[1:28] The Mystery of the seven stars and seven
[1:31] golden candlesticks most of this
[1:33] information is on page
[1:35] 407 through
[1:37] 415 beginning on page 409 there's five
[1:40] proofs on the biblical evidence for the
[1:42] revelation of the Seven Stars and seven
[1:44] golden candlesticks and you can listen
[1:47] this for free on my YouTube channel the
[1:49] book's available on Amazon I'm not a
[1:51] book salesman so if you can't afford it
[1:53] I'll send you a free PDF copy of the
[1:55] book and on this video I'm going to
[1:57] summarize the main points about the
[1:59] seven Church ages the first point is
[2:01] that Jesus calls these seven stars seven
[2:04] angels proving their seven literal men
[2:07] because Jesus said unto the angel of the
[2:09] Church of Ephesus write why would Jesus
[2:12] tell John to author a handwritten letter
[2:15] to a Heavenly Angel at
[2:17] Ephesus God speaks directly to Heavenly
[2:20] Angels sending them from his throne to
[2:22] minister to Believers the Lord does not
[2:24] need men to write letters to
[2:27] Angels second the seven angels are
[2:30] symbolic of human preachers because
[2:33] sometimes human preachers are referred
[2:34] to as angels in scripture the word angel
[2:37] means messenger and John the Baptist is
[2:39] called God's messenger in Matthew
[2:41] 11:10 the prophet David is called an
[2:43] angel of God twice 1st Samuel 299 2
[2:46] Samuel
[2:48] 19:27 Paul says the Galatians received
[2:50] him as an angel of God in Galatians
[2:53] 4:14 and then the angel that showed John
[2:56] all the revelations in the Book of
[2:58] Revelation was called a prophet in
[3:00] Revelation 22: 8 and 9 the third fact is
[3:03] that God uses men to help save men
[3:06] Angels assist men but men are God's
[3:08] primary tool for sharing his way to
[3:11] Salvation like Romans 10:14 says how
[3:13] should they hear without a
[3:16] preacher fourth notice the location of
[3:18] the Seven Stars they're in Jesus's right
[3:20] hand God's right hand of power or
[3:23] authority is reserved for Christ and the
[3:27] men that would inherit God's power as
[3:29] winess es of his resurrection it's
[3:31] according to Acts 1:8 and acts
[3:34] 4:33 and lastly Abraham's seed are
[3:37] faithfield humans are referred to as
[3:39] stars in Genesis
[3:41] 15:5 Daniel 12:3 also says the saved and
[3:46] soul winners are like stars and in John
[3:49] 5:35 John the Baptist is called a
[3:51] burning and Shining Light and that's
[3:53] what a star
[3:54] is next Jesus interprets the seven
[3:57] golden candlesticks as seven churches
[4:00] they are seven Gentile cities located in
[4:02] Turkey notice that no Jewish churches
[4:05] are mentioned because John wrote this
[4:07] around 95 ad and God had already blinded
[4:10] Israel or the Jews because of their
[4:12] unbelief and turned to the Gentiles
[4:15] nearly 50 years prior that's according
[4:18] to acts 13: 14- 48 and Romans 11: 1-8
[4:24] and Romans 11:
[4:26] 25-29 Jesus Christ calls God's Focus on
[4:29] saving the Gentiles the times of the
[4:31] Gentiles in Luke
[4:34] 21:24 so another synonym for church ages
[4:38] is times of the Gentiles you can use
[4:40] either one so Jesus Calls the time God
[4:43] is dealing with the Gentiles after he
[4:45] blinded Israel he calls it the times of
[4:47] the Gentiles and then he tells us there
[4:49] are seven Church ages during this times
[4:52] of the Gentiles then the Bible said
[4:55] he'll go back to Israel after the last
[4:57] Gentile Believers are saved according to
[4:59] Luke
[5:00] 21:24 and Romans 11 as mentioned earlier
[5:04] also in Matthew 21:
[5:06] 33-46 Jesus plainly teaches he's going
[5:08] to take the Kingdom from Israel and give
[5:10] it to the
[5:11] Gentiles notice Jesus and Paul teach the
[5:14] times of the Gentiles or the church ages
[5:16] have an ending point again that's Luke
[5:18] 21:24 where Jesus said it and it's
[5:21] Romans 11:25 where Paul said it so the
[5:24] times of the Gentiles are also called
[5:26] seven Church ages notice there are seven
[5:28] churches
[5:30] the many member Gentile bride is called
[5:32] Jesus's Church on many occasions but
[5:34] most notably in Romans
[5:36] 16:16 Ephesians 3:21 and Ephesians 5:
[5:41] 23-32 again proving the term Church ages
[5:44] is
[5:45] biblical and maybe most importantly the
[5:48] scriptures that literally call them ages
[5:50] are found in Ephesians 3:5 Colossians
[5:54] 1:26 and Ephesians 3: 21 now it just
[5:59] struck me one reason the accusers of
[6:01] brother Bram may not believe in church
[6:03] ages is because they read the wrong
[6:05] Bible translations the wrong Bible
[6:07] versions I was looking online earlier
[6:10] and some of the modern Bible versions do
[6:13] not use the word ages but if you read
[6:14] the King James version it uses the word
[6:17] ages and that's where we get it and
[6:19] that's where we get the terminology for
[6:21] church ages or times of the
[6:23] Gentiles so twice Paul says the Old
[6:26] Testament had ages in Ephesians 3:5 and
[6:28] Colossians
[6:30] 126 and then in Ephesians 3:21 Paul says
[6:33] unto him be glory in the church by
[6:36] Christ Jesus throughout all ages World
[6:39] Without End so two verses speak of past
[6:42] ages Ephesians 3:5 Colossians
[6:45] 1:26 and Ephesians 3:21 speaks of all
[6:49] future ages so if there is past ages and
[6:52] future ages there must be ages now so
[6:55] again the Bible plainly teaches there
[6:57] are Church ages any person that would
[7:00] deny that is either dishonest or
[7:03] completely ignorant of the Bible the
[7:05] scripture also foretold this 2,000-year
[7:08] Gentile Church ages in Hosea 6:
[7:12] 1-3 the Bible said God will revive
[7:15] Israel on the third day or after the
[7:17] 2,000 years of dealing with the Gentiles
[7:20] because one day is with the Lord as a
[7:22] thousand years second Peter
[7:24] 3:8 that verse also goes with acts 2:17
[7:28] how Peter said this spirit will be
[7:29] poured out in the last days or the last
[7:31] 2,000 years before God goes back to
[7:34] Israel and Paul said in the last days
[7:36] perilous times shall come in 2 Timothy
[7:39] 3:1 again days speaking of 2,000 years
[7:43] notice in Revelation 1: 13 through 16
[7:46] Jesus's location is standing in the
[7:48] midst of the seven candlesticks proving
[7:50] his constant presence with the one
[7:53] Church of Jesus Christ Jesus stands with
[7:56] the church during the seven Church ages
[8:00] this is what he also promised in Matthew
[8:02] 28:20 he said Lo I'm with you always
[8:05] even unto end of the world in Hebrews 13
[8:07] says he would never leave us nor forsake
[8:11] us also beginning on pages
[8:13] 412 through 415 I show three
[8:16] applications for the seven letters the
[8:19] seven letters to the seven Gentile
[8:20] cities have three applications first
[8:23] they applied literally to the Christians
[8:25] around 95 ad or whenever John wrote
[8:28] those letters some people say 90 ad some
[8:30] people say 100 AD but they literally
[8:33] appli to those seven Gentile
[8:36] churches the second interpretation they
[8:38] were prophetic to the Future ages
[8:41] there's three simple clear-cut examples
[8:43] that prove this first Jesus warned the
[8:46] church in samna would have tribulation
[8:48] 10 days but must be faithful unto death
[8:51] in Revelation 2:10 the 10 days are
[8:54] historically accurate in one or two ways
[8:57] either the 10 persecutions on the anti-
[8:59] Nan church or Diocesan 10year
[9:03] persecution the Bible says one day can
[9:05] be symbolic of a year that's in numbers
[9:08] 14:34 and Ezekiel 4: 5 and
[9:12] 6 second Jesus foretold there would be
[9:14] an openo missionary age to the Church of
[9:17] Philadelphia and this was from 1750 to
[9:20] 1906 during this age the world saw the
[9:23] greatest missionary efforts through men
[9:25] like William kery and David
[9:27] Livingstone the final example is a
[9:29] lukewarm condition of the final Church
[9:31] age leoa which represents today's
[9:34] churches falling away from the faith
[9:36] putting Jesus's Spirit outside of their
[9:39] churches and this lines up with jesus'
[9:41] Prophecy of the end times in Luke 18:8
[9:44] Jesus said when the son of man cometh
[9:46] shall he find faith on the
[9:49] earth third and finally the seven
[9:51] letters speak prophetically to
[9:52] individuals in all ages every honest
[9:55] Christian knows what it's like to desire
[9:57] to return to his first love as taught in
[10:00] Revelation
[10:02] 2:4 we all gain inspiration from Sam's
[10:05] letter that tells us to fear none of
[10:06] those things which we shall suffer in
[10:08] Revelation
[10:10] 28-10 and all Christians benefit from
[10:12] the warning to Le oysa against
[10:15] lukewarmness and that they must
[10:17] constantly strive to be on fire for
[10:19] Jesus's sake and the lukewarm condition
[10:22] was of course mentioned in Revelation
[10:24] 3:16 the letter to the church at Le
[10:27] oia and I want to remind all of our
[10:29] viewers that I have numerous videos
[10:31] about the church ages I have a video
[10:34] about the Book of Revelation all 22
[10:37] chapters but especially the video on the
[10:38] church ages in chapters 2 and
[10:41] three I have a video about did Columba
[10:44] live during his church
[10:45] age I have another video about the seven
[10:48] Church ages being foreshadowed in the
[10:50] Old
[10:51] Testament and lastly I have a video
[10:53] about how brother Brandon received
[10:55] revelation of the seven Church ages from
[10:57] the Lord and how he reference some of
[11:00] Clarence larin's work to preach the
[11:02] seven Church
[11:03] ages brother Brandon referenced
[11:05] historians over 20 times when he
[11:07] preached the seven Church ages he
[11:08] referenced Lin's work on at least three
[11:11] occasions although he didn't use the
[11:12] name Lin later he did later he than Lin
[11:15] for his work on Daniel 70 weeks and the
[11:17] Seven Seals and brother Ram said he got
[11:19] the dates of the seven Church ages from
[11:21] historians but he says the revelation of
[11:24] The Messengers came from the Holy Spirit
[11:26] and that's accurate by God's grace I'll
[11:28] try to leave those links there in the
[11:30] description for you in closing I hope
[11:33] this short video has been a blessing
[11:35] friends again it just broke my heart
[11:37] when I heard these accusers of brother
[11:39] brandham say the church ages are not in
[11:41] the Bible made me incredibly sad I was
[11:44] shocked and it just goes to show many of
[11:46] these people never really studied the
[11:48] Bible they call themselves bereans but
[11:51] they really don't search the scriptures
[11:52] with an open heart possibly they're
[11:54] using the wrong Bible from my experience
[11:57] talking with these people they will only
[11:58] only research the negative information
[12:01] about brother brandom the gossip about
[12:03] brother brandham the slander about
[12:04] brother brandham and they will not read
[12:07] the two books I've written about the
[12:09] bible-based ministry of brother brandham
[12:11] they won't read research that supports
[12:13] brother brandham they only want to
[12:14] criticize brother brandom and so I'll
[12:17] end this video with a prayer for them
[12:19] dear heavenly father I pray God your
[12:21] Holy Spirit would have mercy on these
[12:23] accusers of brother brandham may they
[12:24] open their hearts to the word of God and
[12:27] may they open their Bibles with an
[12:28] honest heart and believe the holy
[12:32] scriptures father forgive them many of
[12:34] them don't know what they're doing and I
[12:36] pray this video could be used to help
[12:38] some we know all that the father has
[12:40] given to Jesus will come so I pray for
[12:44] them that they will come to know you
[12:45] come to recognize the truth and I ask it
[12:47] in Jesus Christ's name
[12:50] amen if you have any questions concerns
[12:52] or testimonies about this video please
[12:54] contact
[12:56] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[12:59] the desire of your
[13:02] [Music]
[13:05] heart
