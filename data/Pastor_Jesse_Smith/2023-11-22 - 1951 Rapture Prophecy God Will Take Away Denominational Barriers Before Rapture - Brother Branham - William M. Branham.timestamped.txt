[0:00] it was going to come that's prophecy
[0:03] remember that I spoke that in the name
[0:06] of the Lord you can put that down upon
[0:10] the book now that was true I didn't know
[0:13] saying going to say
[0:15] that look when Solomon built the temple
[0:18] it was cut out from all over the world
[0:21] but when they come together there wasn't
[0:23] a bug of a s or the sound of a hammer
[0:26] every block no matter this might have
[0:28] been cut like one this this and two this
[0:30] and this and three this and this and
[0:32] Fess or whatever it was but when they
[0:34] come together they went D Tale one with
[0:37] the other that's right and there wasn't
[0:39] any organ there wasn't any buzzing there
[0:41] wasn't any fussing they just went
[0:42] together and made the temple of God
[0:45] that's right and I believe that God is
[0:47] cutting out everywhere Born Again
[0:50] children of God and go to bring them
[0:52] together I may not live to see it but I
[0:54] hope I do but someday you're going to
[0:57] have to you remember these young people
[0:58] sitting here someday those
[1:01] denominational barriers and ideas that
[1:04] Fanatics has got out there and scooped
[1:06] around and separated the people will be
[1:08] taken away and God will bring his church
[1:10] together and take it home just as
[1:12] certain as anything in the world it was
[1:15] going to come that's prophecy remember
[1:18] that I spoke that in the name of the
[1:22] Lord now you can put that down upon the
[1:25] book now that was true I didn't know
[1:28] saying going to say that
[1:30] now that's right that's how God will
[1:32] bring his church together you can depend
[1:34] on that and as long as you arue and fuss
[1:37] one you're in the kindergarten God will
[1:40] just keep you there till you learn
[1:41] enough to get out of it but
[1:43] oh amen well praise the Lord all right
[1:49] try get out have faith step out on the
[1:53] word of God Jesus said we the disciples
[1:56] come said we've seen one cast out devils
[1:58] and we forbid him there start
[2:00] denomination again said forbid him
[2:03] not amen be one with him after all go
[2:06] join up they won't join up don't forbid
[2:09] him go
[2:10] on that's the way to do now watch
[2:15] closely Jesus said the works that I do
[2:18] bear record of me the works that you do
[2:22] bear record of you Jesus said this will
[2:25] all man know that you're my disciples
[2:27] when you have love one for the other is
[2:30] that right then your Works bear record
[2:34] of you when you in a man that says that
[2:37] he loves me and hates his brother loves
[2:40] me who he has not seen and hates his
[2:43] brother who he has seen he's a liar in
[2:45] the truth not any is that right that's
[2:48] exactly the truth friends that gospel
[2:50] wasn't written in vain that's the truth
[2:52] we look over these great big Greek words
[2:55] and so forth somebody told me not long
[2:57] ago said I was talking something on this
[2:59] already said what business you got s up
[3:01] with a seventh grade education I said I
[3:03] might not read but the seventh grade but
[3:06] I read a whole Carlo to them I know what
[3:08] I'm talking about if it's up to the
[3:09] seventh grade and I know one thing that
[3:11] people look over trying to get their
[3:13] people educated they send them off to
[3:15] these uh cemeteries or C all the same
[3:19] thing that's about right uh a dead
[3:23] place a seminary preacher always reminds
[3:26] me of an incubator chicken a little
[3:28] incubator chicken is true Tri ain't got
[3:30] no M to go to and that's just about way
[3:32] it's Reading Writing and arithmetic gets
[3:35] and great big swell words while you go
[3:37] over the top of the Common People anyhow
[3:39] whatever you look way out out there and
[3:42] Lead Out judgment and mercy and so forth
[3:44] what you should know and the love of God
[3:46] that shed our bre in our hearts by the
[3:47] holy ghost that tears down traditions
[3:50] and builds us up in Christ Jesus new
[3:52] creatures in his love and power that's
[3:54] the things that we ought to have amen we
[3:58] go over the top of that and go out there
[3:59] there's some big Greek words somebody
[4:02] told me said well preacher you don't
[4:03] know the Greek words I said you don't
[4:05] know the Bible right if you know this
[4:07] word don't mean this it means that I
[4:09] said brother I know the author better I
[4:12] know his book amen I better have the
[4:14] author anyhow anytime his book's fine
[4:17] that's right but I'd really know the
[4:18] author wouldn't you and you know him by
[4:21] the love though I speak with tongue as
[4:23] many angels and have not charity it
[4:25] profit mean nothing right right I'm not
[4:30] against speaking in tongues I'm not
[4:31] against any of God's gifts or any of his
[4:33] blessings or the Holy Spirit I'm just
[4:35] saying we're leaving off that one thing
[4:38] that's more important than all that's
[4:41] the love of God Amen that makes us one
[4:44] in Christ
[4:47] Jesus
