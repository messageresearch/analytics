[0:00] [Music]
[0:12] god bless you and welcome to the
[0:13] defending the message podcast i'm your
[0:16] co-host pastor jesse smith our other
[0:18] co-host brother amen lee isn't available
[0:21] for this recording as he has some
[0:23] responsibilities he had to attend to so
[0:25] i'll be hosting solo on this episode
[0:28] i felt an urgency to record and release
[0:30] this podcast as quickly as possible in
[0:33] response to the latest attack against
[0:35] the character of god's prophet brother
[0:37] william branham
[0:38] today's topic is defending the
[0:40] revelation of the seven seals that god
[0:42] gave to his prophet brother william
[0:44] branham and i'll also briefly defend
[0:46] brother william branham's revelation
[0:47] from the lord jesus regarding the seven
[0:49] church ages
[0:55] i'll begin with the recent accusation
[0:57] that has been made against brother
[0:58] william branham
[0:59] a youtube video series was released
[1:01] between april 4th
[1:03] and 18th 2022 and it claimed brother
[1:06] branham stole his teachings about the
[1:09] seven seals from clarence larkin and
[1:11] charles tays russell of course this
[1:13] accusation is false but first here's a
[1:15] short background about both men
[1:18] larkin was a baptist minister who lived
[1:19] from 1850 to 1924 and has some
[1:23] beautifully illustrated bible teaching
[1:25] books available
[1:26] and it seems he had quite a bit of
[1:27] revelation from the lord regarding the
[1:29] book of revelation
[1:30] and numerous other topics such as daniel
[1:32] 70 weeks and some of these thoughts
[1:34] brother branham used like the dates of
[1:36] the seven church ages and the seven-fold
[1:38] glory of jesus christ in revelation
[1:40] chapter one brother branham referenced
[1:42] larkin on numerous occasions
[1:44] most notably in the feast of trumpets
[1:47] 1964. let's listen to the quote
[1:50] i'm just leaving it at that and
[1:51] presuming after a while we'd preach on
[1:54] the seals not knowing what the seals was
[1:57] i had my own idea as every minister does
[2:00] of reading maybe what other man had said
[2:03] and believing as much as i possible with
[2:05] them on the things that they had brought
[2:08] up their conclusion
[2:10] uh i'd read the book of mr smith yuri
[2:14] smith which is the adventist
[2:16] teacher
[2:17] and um i'd read his uh his thoughts on
[2:20] it and i'd read mr larkin i'd read all
[2:24] so many different ones of their
[2:26] commentaries on this but
[2:28] uh somehow or other
[2:31] i thought i had a little view of it
[2:34] myself that might be
[2:35] if a place is different
[2:37] and brother brandon even said he was
[2:39] thankful for larkin's views when he
[2:40] preached the 70th week of daniel and
[2:42] again brother brahm used numerous
[2:44] thoughts from larkin regarding the 70
[2:46] weeks of daniel let's listen to the
[2:47] quote
[2:50] men trying to explain what these 70
[2:52] weeks were
[2:54] i've read many of their commentaries on
[2:56] them
[2:57] and uh i'm very grateful
[3:00] to
[3:01] mr smith
[3:03] of the adventist church for his views
[3:06] i'm very grateful to dr larkin
[3:09] of his views
[3:11] i'm grateful to all these great scholars
[3:14] for their views
[3:16] on this and in reading them it
[3:18] enlightens me much that i can find
[3:20] places that looks right
[3:23] but to get the views that i i thought
[3:25] that i would like to explain
[3:28] uh search through the encyclopedia of
[3:30] time
[3:31] to find out what time meant
[3:35] now regarding both larkin and russell i
[3:37] don't know what their eternal
[3:38] destination is only god knows that but
[3:41] it seems with larkin it seems his life
[3:42] was free from scandal which is different
[3:44] from russell and so now get into charles
[3:47] tays russell he lived from 1852 to 1916
[3:50] he was the founder of what would become
[3:52] the jehovah's witnesses i haven't
[3:54] studied extensively on russell but it
[3:56] appears he was a false prophet having
[3:58] multiple failed prophecies
[4:00] it's notable though that he did have
[4:02] some genuine revelations such as
[4:03] non-eternal hell and the three-person
[4:06] trinity doctrine being a false doctrine
[4:09] back to the accusation against brother
[4:11] branham so far we've not seen a video
[4:14] accusing brother branham on his
[4:15] teachings regarding the seventh seal but
[4:17] i'll be ready to respond shortly after
[4:19] it's released lord willing if it does
[4:20] come out
[4:22] i'm purposely not going to mention the
[4:23] names of brother brahms accusers because
[4:25] this is not a personal attack on them
[4:27] sometimes i've done that during my
[4:28] sermons and if i said anything false
[4:30] then i publicly apologize for the
[4:32] statements that i made but here in this
[4:34] podcast i just want to keep names out of
[4:36] it
[4:36] before getting into the seven seals i
[4:38] just want to put a humble plug in here
[4:40] because some of my other videos that are
[4:42] related to these types of subjects might
[4:44] help you
[4:45] just in case you're not aware of them
[4:46] i'd imagine you're interested in these
[4:48] subjects since you're listening to this
[4:49] podcast as we defend the message and
[4:51] ministry of brother william branham on
[4:53] my youtube channel i've got a hour-long
[4:56] video about larkin comparing larkin's
[4:58] teachings with brother branham's proving
[5:00] brother brahm did not plagiarize larkin
[5:02] brother branham referenced numerous
[5:03] preachers many preachers and the video
[5:05] fully proves that now it does seem
[5:08] brother branham forgot to reference
[5:09] larkin on the future home which he used
[5:11] at least eight of his teachings
[5:13] but again brother branham's main
[5:14] emphasis in that sermon was about the
[5:16] three works of grace
[5:18] how the earth has to go through three
[5:20] works to purify itself just as the
[5:21] believer has to go through three works
[5:23] of grace to bring his life to a
[5:25] completion and of course larkin did not
[5:27] teach the three works of grace according
[5:29] to my studies so please anyone correct
[5:31] me if i'm wrong enlighten me if i'm
[5:33] wrong on any of these facts
[5:35] also i recently published a video about
[5:37] the brown bear vision and in that video
[5:39] also i gave brief responses to other
[5:41] accusations against brother branham such
[5:42] as the tent vision the vision of the
[5:44] three hundred thousand and one meeting
[5:46] the ohio river municipal bridge vision
[5:48] the seven major visions of 1933 and the
[5:51] arizona cloud from february 28 1963
[5:55] and there's numerous other videos i put
[5:56] out defending brother branham his
[5:58] ministry his teachings and his character
[6:00] such as a video about there's no women
[6:02] angels and there should be no women
[6:04] preachers three prophecies of brother
[6:06] branham that are in the process of
[6:07] coming to pass a video about how brother
[6:09] branham did not pretend to speak in
[6:10] tongues defending brother branham's
[6:12] character showing how brother branham
[6:14] was open to receiving correction and not
[6:16] every word on brother graham's tapes was
[6:18] thus saith the lord because remember
[6:19] again friends we're trying to stay in
[6:21] the middle of the road there's two
[6:22] extremes around the ministry of brother
[6:24] branham one extreme exalts his every
[6:26] word to thus saith the lord this is
[6:28] heresy this is idolatry so we're
[6:30] standing in love against that side and
[6:32] rightly dividing the word of truth
[6:34] showing how they're wrong the other side
[6:35] attacks brother branham tries to
[6:37] discredit him and claim he was a false
[6:39] prophet a charlatan so we're refuting
[6:42] their misunderstandings and lies and
[6:44] attacks as well by the grace of the lord
[6:46] jesus christ our purpose of this podcast
[6:48] is defend jesus's message and messenger
[6:51] and we want to try to answer as many
[6:53] questions as we can by the help of the
[6:54] lord as we seek the lord pray to him and
[6:57] wait on him for his answers and they
[6:58] always come in the right time in season
[7:01] for god makes everything beautiful in
[7:02] his time
[7:07] i'm now going to refute the plagiarism
[7:09] accusation regarding the seven seals
[7:12] i'll go seal by seal starting with the
[7:14] first seal ending with the sixth seal
[7:16] but first i want to acknowledge yes
[7:18] brother adam used some of the exact
[7:19] words from charles taye's russell and
[7:22] clarence larkin but only as it fit the
[7:24] revelation the holy ghost gave to him
[7:26] and brother brahm didn't plagiarize them
[7:28] because he referenced larkin uriah smith
[7:31] and many other bible teachers and
[7:32] pastors and ministers whose books he
[7:34] read and gained insight from as far as i
[7:37] can find brother branham never
[7:38] referenced charles tay's russell so it
[7:40] seems he forgot to actually state his
[7:42] name but that doesn't change the fact
[7:44] that brother branham referenced many
[7:46] authors and told us he was reading many
[7:48] books during the week of the seven seals
[7:50] and of course this podcast will prove
[7:51] beyond a shadow of a doubt that brother
[7:53] ram didn't plagiarize russell larkin or
[7:55] any other one it's my opinion that
[7:56] brother branham was a seventh grade
[7:58] educated kentuckian and he didn't
[8:00] understand the importance of referencing
[8:02] or citing his sources but that's okay
[8:04] god was merciful god is merciful in all
[8:06] of our weaknesses and all of our human
[8:08] mistakes and he remains a genuine
[8:09] prophet by the grace of god here's a
[8:11] quote where brother brahm talked about
[8:12] it being a tremendous week as he studied
[8:14] for the seven seals he said he'd pick up
[8:16] the books and oh all the writers and
[8:19] everything and read in read down in
[8:21] their book so brother iran was clearly
[8:22] transparent saying that he was reading
[8:24] lots of books during the seven seals
[8:26] series
[8:27] this has been a tremendous week for me
[8:30] i'm tired my mind is tired
[8:33] because i i was the best that i could do
[8:36] and something strange going on every day
[8:39] i would be amazed to walk in the room
[8:42] and be there for a few minutes
[8:44] and see something's turning completely
[8:46] around
[8:46] and here i go in there i pick up the
[8:48] notes i pick up books of dr smith you're
[8:51] a smith and all the writers and read and
[8:55] read down in their books i say now
[8:57] here's the sixth seal here's the fourth
[8:59] seal now what does this man say he'd say
[9:01] what was this
[9:03] i looked and all of a sudden when i got
[9:05] white here just unfolded like that then
[9:07] i grab a pen right quick go to writing
[9:09] it down like that whatever i was seeing
[9:11] and doing watch it like after got it
[9:13] rolled down then i'd take the rest of
[9:14] the day go down and chase this out and
[9:17] see if it tied all the way down to the
[9:19] scriptures then it proved all things
[9:22] i got this year and i think now there's
[9:24] many people had visions there's many
[9:26] been revelations if it's contrary to the
[9:28] word leave it alone
[9:29] that's right
[9:31] as i go through this subject seal by
[9:32] seal i'll start with comparing charles
[9:34] tay's russell and brother branham
[9:36] because it's the latest accusation
[9:38] against brother branham and plus i've
[9:39] also already done an extensive
[9:41] comparison between larkin and brother
[9:43] branham on my youtube video and please
[9:45] contact me if you need a link to that
[9:52] the timing of the first seal
[9:54] charles russell said the timing of the
[9:56] white horse rider was beyond john's epic
[9:59] or church age
[10:01] this means russell's first seal lasted
[10:02] from 73 a.d to 325 a.d
[10:07] and friends remember i have screenshots
[10:09] of all these quotes from charles day's
[10:11] russell's book the finnish mystery
[10:13] released in 1917 by the watchtower bible
[10:16] and track society russell said quote
[10:19] as it related to the epochs of the
[10:21] church beyond his own epoch that of
[10:23] sumernia end quote brother branham's
[10:26] timing was much different god's prophet
[10:28] said this white horse writer began
[10:29] writing in the first church age around
[10:31] 53 a.d
[10:32] while russell said the start time was 73
[10:35] a.d a difference of 20 years
[10:38] that is not plagiarism let's listen to
[10:40] brother branham's quote
[10:41] here he is he's the antichrist he
[10:43] started rising the first church age now
[10:46] he rides on down on down through every
[10:48] age
[10:50] russell's end date for the first seal
[10:51] was 325 a.d
[10:53] while brother branham's end date was
[10:55] about 385 a.d a difference of 60 years
[10:59] so regarding the timing of the first
[11:00] seal it's obvious brother ram did not
[11:02] plagiarize russell
[11:04] now regarding larkin and brother branham
[11:06] larkin said the timing of the first seal
[11:08] was in the 70th week of daniel during
[11:10] the great tribulation period which is
[11:12] nearly a 2 000 year difference than
[11:14] brother branham because brother branham
[11:15] said around 53 a.d larkin said
[11:17] tribulation period which is still in the
[11:19] future
[11:21] let's look at the white horse rider
[11:22] russell said the white horse rider was
[11:24] quote the bishop of rome end quote
[11:27] brother brahm said the writer was the
[11:29] antichrist spirit and later became the
[11:31] pope brother brahm never said the bishop
[11:33] of rome in the entire first seal the
[11:35] bishop of roman 3 25 was not even a pope
[11:38] because the first pope was pope boniface
[11:41] iii
[11:42] according to the anti-nicean fathers
[11:44] volume number eight who became the first
[11:46] pope in 606 a.d
[11:48] the big bishop up there over all of it
[11:51] which is far actually called a pope but
[11:53] he was a he was a bishop then and
[11:56] boniface the third was the one who
[11:58] become the first pope
[12:00] so let's notice the difference between
[12:01] the writers god's prophet said the
[12:03] writer began as a spirit while russell
[12:05] said the writer began as a man the
[12:07] bishop of rome
[12:08] now regarding larkin larkin said the
[12:10] writer was the future antichrist the
[12:12] person of the antichrist during the
[12:14] great tribulation period
[12:16] so this proves brother bram did not
[12:17] plagiarize larkin on the first seal
[12:20] and again there's a two thousand year
[12:21] difference between larkin and branham
[12:23] here's an extra thing i want to add in
[12:24] to show brother ram did not plagiarize
[12:26] russell russell said that god forsook
[12:29] the church in the first seal and the
[12:31] bishop of rome defeated infinite justice
[12:33] or the lion beast which was one of the
[12:36] four beasts that surrounded the throne
[12:37] in heaven according to revelation
[12:39] chapter 4 and verse 5.
[12:41] russell said and i quote
[12:42] thus we see the apparent defeat of
[12:44] infinite justice in the first epoch
[12:46] apparently god forsook his church having
[12:49] jeopardizing all its interest by placing
[12:51] the power in the hands of the
[12:52] self-seeking ecclesiastical system but
[12:55] worse things are coming end quote
[12:57] brother branham taught much different
[12:59] brother brandon said the early church
[13:00] had the line anointing and was able to
[13:02] combat and withstand the antichrist
[13:04] spirit here's one quote about that
[13:06] the holy spirit manifests himself which
[13:09] is the word
[13:11] that's the reason early church had
[13:13] healings and miracles and visions and
[13:15] power
[13:17] is because it was the living word in the
[13:20] form of the light of the tribe of judah
[13:23] right now to combat that
[13:26] amen
[13:27] before moving on to the second seal
[13:29] let's look at the four beasts
[13:31] russell said the lion beast was infinite
[13:32] justice brother branham said it was the
[13:34] line anointing of supernatural signs
[13:36] wonders and miracles of the holy ghost
[13:39] and you'll see that on pages 78 79 and
[13:41] 80 of his book russell said the line
[13:44] represented justice the ox represented
[13:46] power the man represented love and the
[13:49] flying eagle represented wisdom brother
[13:51] branham taught completely different
[13:53] brother branham taught these were
[13:54] anointings on the church to help them
[13:56] combat and overcome the four horse
[13:59] riders or the antichrist spirit brother
[14:01] branham said this anointing saved the
[14:03] world
[14:03] so brother ram's revelation was much
[14:05] greater than russell's because russell
[14:07] said god's infinite justice could be
[14:09] defeated but we know the church of the
[14:11] living god by the baptism of the holy
[14:13] ghost and the anointing that they have
[14:15] for their day makes the church
[14:16] invincible whether they live or die
[14:18] because they live to the glory of god
[14:19] and they keep the faith here's a quote
[14:21] where brother brahm said the revelations
[14:23] god gave him regarding the four beasts
[14:24] were thus saith the lord and of course
[14:26] they were because russell and larkin did
[14:28] not agree with brother branham on these
[14:29] subjects and brother branham's
[14:31] revelation was scriptural
[14:34] when the beast went forth in the form of
[14:37] a man to combat that
[14:39] don't forget this class don't forget it
[14:42] see remember
[14:45] all the days of your life
[14:48] these beasts are correct it's thus saith
[14:51] the lord
[14:54] regarding the bow and no arrows of the
[14:56] first seal russell said jeremiah 9 3 was
[14:59] the fulfillment and brother random never
[15:01] said that you can search the first seal
[15:03] brother bram never references that
[15:04] scripture brother branham said it meant
[15:06] satan was a bluff and russell did not
[15:08] say that so again brother brown did not
[15:10] plagiarize the first seal from russell
[15:12] or larkin
[15:13] the rider has no errors for his boat did
[15:16] you notice
[15:21] [Music]
[15:23] so he must be a bluffer
[15:37] maybe he's got a lot of thunder no
[15:39] lightning
[15:41] but you find out christ had both
[15:44] lightning and thunder
[15:46] but out of his mouth goes a sharp
[15:48] two-eighth sword
[15:49] and he smites the nations whether his
[15:51] god case might nothing
[15:55] but he's playing a part of a hypocrite
[15:58] he's going forth riding a little white
[15:59] horse going out to conquer
[16:07] the second seal we'll begin with the
[16:09] timing russell said on page 107
[16:12] quote this period beginning with the
[16:14] year 325 80 and extending to the year
[16:17] 539 was the period of formation of
[16:19] creeds end quote
[16:21] so his second seal lasted from 325 to
[16:24] 539
[16:25] and brother branham's second seal lasted
[16:27] from about 385 to 1095 a.d so the timing
[16:31] between russell's second seal and
[16:32] brother ramsey's second seal was not the
[16:34] same brother branham started 60 years
[16:37] later and lasted 556 more years beyond
[16:40] russell's timing for the second seal
[16:42] proving brother ram did not plagiarize
[16:44] charles tay's russell regarding the
[16:46] timing of larkin's teachings on the
[16:48] second seal larkin said the timing was
[16:50] again during the 70th week of daniel in
[16:52] the future tribulation period which is
[16:54] nearly a 1 700 year difference from
[16:57] brother branham let's look at the red
[16:59] symbol of the second seal russell said
[17:01] red represented quote the color of sin
[17:04] imperfection end quote and the red horse
[17:06] rider was the quote
[17:08] period of formation of creeds end quote
[17:11] and russell wrote this on pages 106 and
[17:14] 107 of his book
[17:16] brother branham said different
[17:17] brother brahm said red represented rome
[17:20] or the roman catholic church killing
[17:21] christians by the millions
[17:23] brother branham said the seal took place
[17:24] when the roman catholic church was given
[17:26] power to kill with the sword which began
[17:29] around 385 a.d according to research
[17:32] from edmond broadbent who wrote quote
[17:35] priscillian a holy ghost-filled bishop
[17:37] of spain and six others are said to be
[17:39] the first saints executed by the false
[17:41] church in 385 a.d end quote that's from
[17:44] the pilgrim church 1935 page 37. so
[17:48] again this proves brother bram did not
[17:50] plagiarize the meaning of the red horse
[17:52] rider let's listen to brother m's quote
[17:54] about the red horse rider that's wrong
[17:57] don't do it as a nation it does it as a
[18:00] church
[18:02] every nation under heaven
[18:04] is to roam
[18:06] now
[18:07] i remember he's got a sword he's going
[18:09] forth a sword in his hand riding red
[18:13] horse wading through the blood of
[18:15] everybody that disagrees with him how do
[18:17] you understand it how many understands
[18:19] what the seal is now all right
[18:22] all right this rider and all his kingdom
[18:25] subjects
[18:26] that are slain down through the age
[18:29] that's drawn all this blood on the
[18:32] martyrs of the saints
[18:34] will be slaying by the sword of jesus
[18:37] christ when he comes
[18:38] they that take the sword will be slain
[18:40] by the sword they took the sword of
[18:43] dogma and antichrist and cut down the
[18:46] real true worshipers all down to the
[18:48] ages of the millions and when christ
[18:50] comes with the sword for it's his word
[18:53] that proceeds out of his mouth
[18:59] now regarding the sword brother branham
[19:01] did agree with russell on this because
[19:02] russell said
[19:04] quote they destroy one another as
[19:05] teachers end quote
[19:07] referring to creeds and that's on page
[19:09] 106 and 107 of russell's book and here's
[19:12] the quote again where brother branham
[19:13] said they took the sword of dogma and
[19:15] antichrist and cut down the real true
[19:17] worshipers all down through the ages by
[19:19] the millions but again brother ram's
[19:21] emphasis was the literal sword not the
[19:23] spiritual sword of creeds because this
[19:26] is the sermon where brother brandon
[19:27] brought out the historical fact of 68
[19:29] million souls were martyred by the roman
[19:31] catholic church and he got that number
[19:32] from samuel s schmucker from his book
[19:34] the glorious reformation
[19:37] regarding the second beast the ox
[19:39] russell said the ox was infinite power
[19:41] brother ram said it was sacrificial
[19:43] saints it was christians gladly willing
[19:45] to be martyrs so this revelation is
[19:48] completely different
[19:49] not
[19:50] plagiarized see that shows that the
[19:54] age
[19:55] as the antichrist got settled down and
[19:57] come into the five higher age the little
[20:00] church
[20:01] could do nothing
[20:03] but just
[20:04] just simply labor and another thing
[20:08] the ox is uh also
[20:11] is a beast of sacrifice
[20:15] they
[20:16] they give their lives just as freely as
[20:18] they can give them
[20:20] regarding the writer of the second seal
[20:22] russell wrote quote the same writer the
[20:24] antichrist end quote and then recall he
[20:27] said in the first seal the writer was
[20:29] the bishop of rome brother branham
[20:31] agreed to a degree saying the writer
[20:32] changed his form starting out as a
[20:34] spirit but then became incarnate in a
[20:37] pope so these are not exactly the same
[20:39] thoughts they're slightly different so
[20:41] again brother brown did not plagiarize
[20:43] the second seal writer from russell
[20:45] here's a quote from the second seal
[20:47] where brethren said the antichrist kept
[20:48] changing his forms
[20:50] from nicolaitan spirit spiritual
[20:52] antichrist to the pope to the false
[20:54] prophet then to the beast then the devil
[20:56] himself incarnate
[20:59] satan's trinity same person
[21:03] coming just incarnate from one to the
[21:05] other that's where them bugs did that
[21:07] worms one to the other exactly
[21:10] nickelodeon
[21:11] spiritual antichrist pope
[21:14] false prophet
[21:15] beast the devil himself incarnate you
[21:19] can't do now you keep that on your mind
[21:20] now when you follow this you're going to
[21:22] see these writers come right straight up
[21:25] to that
[21:26] see i'm laying you a picture here if i
[21:27] had it on a blackboard you could
[21:29] understand it better see i'm watching
[21:31] first now you remember this the first
[21:32] thing he is
[21:34] he's an antichrist spirit
[21:36] amen john said so little children the
[21:38] spirit of antichrist already worked in
[21:40] the children of disobedience see if they
[21:41] have to get a start
[21:43] and then it become kind of a saiyan in
[21:45] the next church age and the next church
[21:47] agent was a doctrine and the next church
[21:50] he was crowned
[21:52] i isn't that just as plain as reading
[21:54] any way
[22:01] the third seal
[22:03] regarding the timing of the third seal
[22:05] russell said the third seal lasted from
[22:07] 539 to 1160 a.d
[22:10] brother random taught that the third
[22:11] seal was the black horse rider which
[22:14] represented the dark ages and the dark
[22:16] ages lasted from around 1095 and this
[22:18] influence continued till about 1906
[22:21] so there's a huge difference between the
[22:23] timing of the third seal between russell
[22:26] and brother branham brother branham's
[22:28] third seal started 556 years after
[22:31] russell's third seal began
[22:33] and brother branham's third seal ended
[22:36] 746 years after russell's third seal
[22:39] ended russell's ended in
[22:41] 1160 a.d and brother branham's ended
[22:44] around 1906 a.d which is the time when
[22:47] the eagle anointing or the prophetic
[22:48] anointing
[22:49] started arriving for god's saints in
[22:52] order to receive the ministry of god's
[22:53] prophet brother branham
[22:55] larkin said the timing of the third seal
[22:57] was again in the 70th week of daniel
[22:59] which was over a 900-year difference
[23:01] than brother branham's third seal
[23:03] because brother and said the third seal
[23:04] began in 1095 a.d and larkin's third
[23:08] seal hasn't even happened yet because
[23:09] its future in the great tribulation
[23:12] regarding the symbols of the third seal
[23:14] russell said the beast was infinite love
[23:17] or he said the man represented infinite
[23:19] love
[23:20] brother braham said the beast was the
[23:21] wisdom of man not infinite love
[23:24] so this is not plagiarism
[23:26] russell also said the beast meant quote
[23:28] apparently complete triumph of the
[23:30] powers of darkness and the apparent
[23:32] inaction of infinite love permitting it
[23:34] end quote
[23:36] unreal russell said the infinite love of
[23:38] god was inactive during this third seal
[23:40] timing but brother branham said the man
[23:42] anointing was strong in luther and men
[23:45] of that age
[23:46] brother branham said this anointing
[23:47] saved the world
[23:49] so this was not plagiarism brother bram
[23:50] did not play dries larkin let's listen
[23:52] to the quote
[23:54] now notice
[23:55] the
[23:56] peace come to combat it now was man and
[23:59] we all know that this
[24:03] beast of man this power of man and his
[24:07] intellectuals recognize that that
[24:11] kosher that martin luther had in his
[24:14] hand when he was climbing those steps
[24:17] he said this is the blood of jesus
[24:19] christ
[24:20] this is the body of jesus christ and
[24:23] luther thought it down and said it's
[24:25] bread and wine
[24:27] amen
[24:28] it's not the body of christ because it's
[24:30] been exalted and sitting at the right
[24:32] hand of god
[24:34] making intercession amen see
[24:36] wisdom
[24:37] god bless you study the scripture and
[24:40] watch it it was revealed to him that the
[24:42] blood of jesus christ sanctifies the
[24:44] believer
[24:46] and he shouldn't then what he do you
[24:49] come out in another reformation he saved
[24:52] the world in his day like luther did see
[24:54] what was it that man beast power going
[24:57] on
[24:58] i'd like to play another quote from the
[25:01] church age book where brother branham
[25:02] said the man anointing produced the
[25:04] greatest preaching there ever was during
[25:07] the church ages now this quote may shock
[25:09] some people because many message
[25:11] preachers today are saying they're the
[25:13] greatest preachers or brother branham
[25:14] was the greatest preacher ever or
[25:16] today's young people are the greatest
[25:18] young people ever now they're allowed to
[25:19] have their opinion but i just humbly
[25:21] disagree in this quote it says the man
[25:23] age preachers were the greatest
[25:26] preachers of all time let's listen to
[25:27] the quote
[25:29] the preaching of the word was never
[25:30] greater
[25:31] as satan raised up his hordes of free
[25:33] thinkers as the originators of communism
[25:36] rose up as liberal theologians spread
[25:38] their filthy wares
[25:40] god raised up mighty warriors of faith
[25:42] and the greatest works of christian
[25:44] literature and teaching and preaching
[25:46] came from this era
[25:48] never has its preachers and teachers
[25:50] been matched and never will they be
[25:52] the spurgeons parkers mclarens the
[25:55] edwards bunions muellers brainerds barns
[25:58] bishops all came from this era
[26:01] they preached taught and wrote the word
[26:04] they glorified his name
[26:06] now i do believe we have the greatest
[26:08] revelation in the church ages but i'd
[26:10] also want to say our revelation is equal
[26:12] to that of the first church age because
[26:14] that's what we're all going to be judged
[26:15] by romans 2 verse 16 says in that day
[26:19] when
[26:20] god shall judge the secrets of men's
[26:21] hearts according to paul's gospel so the
[26:23] alpha has become the omega we have the
[26:25] same revelation that paul had and john
[26:28] had
[26:29] as brother and went beyond the curtain
[26:30] of time and they all rejoiced in the
[26:32] fact and were resting on the fact that
[26:33] brother brown preached paul's message
[26:35] nothing new it was the same revelation
[26:37] from the first church age
[26:39] but again brother branham said the
[26:41] greatest preaching and teaching came
[26:43] from the age of the man anointing and
[26:44] they will never be matched
[26:47] now regarding the writer of the third
[26:48] seal here's where russell and brother
[26:50] brahm did agree they both believed it
[26:52] was the popes anointed by the antichrist
[26:54] spirit
[26:56] so they agreed on that but remember they
[26:57] greatly differed on the timing of this
[26:59] seal
[27:00] regarding the symbols of oil and wine
[27:02] russell and brother ram seemed to agree
[27:03] on the meanings as russell said the oil
[27:05] was quote the supply of the holy spirit
[27:07] of full submission to the will of god
[27:09] end quote anne russell said the wine was
[27:11] quote a symbol of doctrine true or false
[27:14] and its accompanying joy's end quote but
[27:16] again brother ram never said the false
[27:18] doctrine was wine
[27:19] he said the wine was the new wine that
[27:21] fell on the day of pentecost the
[27:22] stimulation of revelation by the word of
[27:24] god they agreed on the interpretation of
[27:26] oil but differed on wine
[27:28] and larkin said the oil and wine was
[27:31] literally natural oil and wine that
[27:33] believers are going to have to use
[27:34] during the great tribulation period so
[27:36] as we end the third seal we can see
[27:38] brother bram did not plagiarize the
[27:40] timing of the third seal the meaning of
[27:42] wine and he did not teach the wine and
[27:44] oil were natural oil and wine so brother
[27:47] ram was not plagiarizing the third seal
[27:56] the fourth seal the timing of the four
[27:58] seal was very different between russell
[28:00] and brother branham russell said it was
[28:02] quote pre-reformation period end quote
[28:05] likely from 1160
[28:07] to 1516 a.d
[28:10] brother branham alluded to the fact that
[28:12] the fourth seal was from 1906 to the
[28:14] current time period and also said the
[28:16] pale horse rider's last ride would be at
[28:18] armageddon so again we have a huge
[28:21] difference between these two men brother
[28:23] branham's was almost 400 years later and
[28:25] his end date is still in the future so
[28:28] it's clear brother ram did not
[28:29] plagiarize russell on this
[28:32] notice russell said the four seal was
[28:34] pre-reformation period brother branham
[28:36] said the reformation was under the third
[28:38] seal
[28:39] completely different
[28:40] here's some quotes from brother branham
[28:41] saying the eagle anointing was there now
[28:43] when he was alive and so using logic the
[28:46] eagle anointing had the battle of the
[28:48] pale horse rider so that's why we
[28:49] believe the pale horse rider started
[28:51] writing at the beginning of the
[28:52] laodicean church age because this was
[28:54] the age in which the eagle anointing
[28:56] would fall upon believers of course
[28:58] follow brother branham as a prophet
[28:59] eagle to our age but then also fall upon
[29:02] the believers who would have the same
[29:03] holy spirit as jesus said they would be
[29:05] the eagles gathered around the fresh
[29:07] word the carcass which is the word of
[29:09] god for this day
[29:12] now on this year we find that this fella
[29:16] here is an eagle this man that this
[29:19] living creature that's uh
[29:21] poured for here now
[29:23] but in the eagle age the last age the
[29:27] prophetic age
[29:29] where there is to rise
[29:31] prophetic utterance
[29:34] see
[29:37] to whom the secrets
[29:39] always comes
[29:41] now we find out that eagle asia's
[29:43] promised in
[29:45] revelations 10 7 and america 1 4 that
[29:49] would be in the last days
[29:52] that's right
[29:53] that uh it would be here
[29:55] now we see that the devils changing for
[30:00] um
[30:01] four beasts meant
[30:03] what power they was revealed
[30:06] uh to the what power he revealed to the
[30:08] world
[30:10] and how they ended on his pale death
[30:13] horse
[30:14] now let's look
[30:15] at god's
[30:17] powers of this beast
[30:19] to combat
[30:20] them another detail about the four seal
[30:23] is that russell said the fourth part of
[30:25] the earth which the pale horse rider had
[30:27] power over to kill with the sword and
[30:29] with hunger and with death and with the
[30:30] beast of the earth russell said this was
[30:33] over europe but not asia africa or
[30:36] america
[30:37] and brother branham said it was all the
[30:39] nations of the world so we have a huge
[30:41] difference here russell said quote over
[30:44] the fourth part of the earth over europe
[30:46] but not over asia africa or america end
[30:49] quote brother branham said he rode over
[30:52] every nation under heaven let's listen
[30:54] to the quote
[30:55] look what he's riding on this pale
[30:57] looking grizzled colored horse mixed
[30:59] with black red and white
[31:01] coming into the battle
[31:09] regarding clarence larkin larkin said
[31:11] the timing was during the 70th week of
[31:13] daniel or the great tribulation period
[31:16] brother branham's start time was around
[31:17] 1906 so that means brother branham's
[31:19] start time was was about 120 years
[31:21] different from the start time of larkins
[31:24] and of course we know the great
[31:24] tribulation hasn't started yet but it
[31:27] will likely start sometime soon no man
[31:28] knows the dare of the hour but just
[31:30] showing there's a difference of almost
[31:32] 120 years between brother branham's four
[31:35] seal and larkin's four seal so again
[31:38] brother bram did not plagiarize russell
[31:40] nor larkin
[31:41] regarding the four seal rider russell
[31:43] said the writer was the papacy during
[31:46] the pre-reformation period brother
[31:48] braham said this four-seal rider would
[31:50] end up being the full antichrist the
[31:52] pope antichrist during the great
[31:54] tribulation period and take his last
[31:56] ride down to the battle of armageddon so
[31:58] this is a huge difference especially
[32:00] regarding timing but also it's a huge
[32:03] difference with the completion of each
[32:04] seal as russell's seal ended with the
[32:07] reformation by the branhams ends with
[32:09] the ending of daniel's 70th week the
[32:12] ending of the great tribulation period
[32:13] which is the battle of armageddon
[32:20] the fifth seal regarding the timing of
[32:22] the fist seal russell said they were
[32:24] christian martyrs during the reformation
[32:26] period quote disclosing the reformation
[32:29] in the days of luther end quote and
[32:31] russell said the fifth seal ended in
[32:34] april
[32:34] 1876. brother brahm taught the reality
[32:37] form of the fifth seal takes place after
[32:39] the rapture because after the rapture
[32:42] the souls on the altar which are jews
[32:44] will cry out to the lord seeking
[32:45] vengeance but the lord will tell them no
[32:47] there's still a certain number of
[32:49] martyrs jewish martyrs that must be
[32:51] fulfilled before they're given white
[32:53] robes at the white throne judgment so
[32:56] here we have a huge difference between
[32:57] russell and brother bam's timing russell
[33:00] said it started in 1517
[33:02] when luther nailed the 95 theses on the
[33:04] church door in wittenberg and ended in
[33:07] 1878
[33:08] brother rams fist seal hasn't happened
[33:10] yet and so there's at least a difference
[33:12] of almost 140 years between russell's
[33:15] end date and the start time of brother
[33:17] branham's fifth seal because we know the
[33:19] great tribulation is yet future now with
[33:21] larkin and branham they agree on the
[33:23] fifth seal saying they are jews but
[33:25] larkin taught that these souls are the
[33:27] ones saved after the rapture
[33:30] brother branham said these jews were the
[33:31] saved jews from the time of jesus
[33:32] crucifixion where they cried out let
[33:34] jesus blood be upon us and our children
[33:36] throughout the entire church age history
[33:38] even from the days of eichmann hitler
[33:40] and stalin during the holocaust when
[33:42] they killed over 6 million jews so it's
[33:44] basically all the jews martyred from the
[33:46] days of jesus throughout the entire
[33:48] church ages and then there's another
[33:50] group that has to die during the great
[33:51] tribulation period as well to fill up
[33:53] the number of martyrs let's listen to
[33:55] brother rams quotes
[33:59] they had in their blindness martyred
[34:03] their
[34:04] messiah now they were reaping for it
[34:08] they realized that they recognized eggs
[34:10] has gone on they seen them when they
[34:12] come before the altar of god
[34:14] but now the grace of god
[34:17] is to them
[34:19] now these souls under the altar
[34:24] uh
[34:24] the this these uh souls
[34:28] understanding now it's under the altar
[34:30] why they were martyred by sinful man
[34:34] like eichmann
[34:36] see they're holding right on millions of
[34:38] them
[34:40] but they remain jews
[34:43] jews and hitler hated them so tonight
[34:46] sort of stalling all the rest of the
[34:48] world
[34:49] but they stayed true to what they
[34:51] believed
[34:52] and they killed them because they were
[34:55] jews
[34:56] and now look what a thing they had to do
[34:58] see there was guilty of murder so they
[35:00] got murdered
[35:03] they cried out his blood beyond us
[35:04] that's right
[35:06] that's right
[35:08] and they were blinded
[35:10] now if they hadn't been blinded god said
[35:12] let alone
[35:13] they're not worthy but then if they was
[35:16] blinded by god his grace reached down to
[35:18] him
[35:19] amen
[35:21] talk about amazing grace
[35:24] and give each one of them because all
[35:28] israel will
[35:30] [Applause]
[35:36] though they had tried to get rid of
[35:38] joseph his grace reached to him though
[35:40] they tried to get rid of jesus he still
[35:42] comes right back around because he's
[35:43] dying and getting each one of white
[35:44] robes he's going to take around home
[35:46] anyhow
[35:52] regarding the fist seal larkin said
[35:53] quote but they were not the martyrs of
[35:55] the christian church
[35:57] for they had been resurrected and taken
[35:59] up with the church these martyrs are
[36:01] those who will be killed for the word of
[36:02] god and their testimony after the church
[36:05] is called out end quote so see larkin
[36:07] said they were jews that would die
[36:09] during the great tribulation period
[36:11] brother braham said they were jews that
[36:12] died from the days of jesus crucifixion
[36:14] that were blinded that were blinded to
[36:16] jesus's identity as messiah all
[36:18] throughout the church ages even through
[36:20] world war ii and the holocaust all the
[36:22] way up to the end of the laodicean
[36:23] church age so it's clear brother brown
[36:25] did not plagiarize russell or larkin in
[36:27] the fifth seal
[36:33] the sixth seal
[36:35] regarding the timing of the sixth seal
[36:36] russell said the sixth seal earthquake
[36:39] literally took place on november 1st
[36:42] 1755
[36:44] the stars that fell from heaven russell
[36:46] said fell as a meteorite shower on
[36:48] november 13 1833
[36:51] russell said the moon became his blood
[36:53] on may 19 1750 and of course brother ram
[36:56] said the sixth seal hasn't happened yet
[36:58] it's future he calls it the great
[37:00] tribulation seal so there's a huge
[37:02] difference between russell's timing and
[37:04] brother branham's timing of the sixth
[37:05] seal over 150 years difference so
[37:07] brother bram did not plagiarize russell
[37:09] on the sixth seal
[37:11] regarding clarence larkin and brother
[37:12] branham the sixth seal is the first time
[37:15] that brother branham agreed with larkin
[37:17] about both the timing and the details of
[37:19] the seal so catch that for five seals in
[37:21] a row brother ram did not agree with
[37:23] larkin on the symbols and timings of the
[37:25] first five seals
[37:27] proving brother branham was not a
[37:28] plagiarist and yes brother brown used
[37:30] similar terminology to larkin regarding
[37:33] the sixth seal but it wasn't plagiarism
[37:35] as brother adam referenced both
[37:36] historians and larkin by name for his
[37:38] help on daniel's 70 weeks and the seven
[37:40] seals
[37:41] recall that quote from brother branham
[37:43] from the feast of trumpets in 1964 where
[37:46] he said he read larkin's work regarding
[37:48] the seven seals bless us under brother
[37:49] rams quotes
[37:51] i'm just leaving it at that and pursuing
[37:53] after a while we'd preach on the seals
[37:56] not knowing what the seals was and i'd
[37:58] read
[37:59] mr larkin
[38:01] oh so many different ones of their
[38:03] commentaries on this
[38:06] i'm very grateful to dr larkin
[38:09] of his views
[38:10] i'm grateful to all these great scholars
[38:14] for their views
[38:16] on this and in reading them it
[38:18] enlightens me much that i can find
[38:20] places that looks right
[38:23] larkin said regarding the sixth seal
[38:24] quote these physical convulsions will be
[38:26] earth's travailing pains as she labors
[38:28] to bring forth the new creation of the
[38:30] millennial age end quote
[38:37] the seventh seal regarding the timing of
[38:39] the seventh seal russell said the
[38:41] seventh seal was quote the seal of the
[38:44] living god end quote or holy ghost
[38:46] baptism from revelation 7 verse 2. this
[38:49] is extremely different from brother
[38:50] branham
[38:51] russell went on to say that when the
[38:53] quote full number end quote of saints
[38:55] were sealed quote persecution in a
[38:58] public way and on an unprecedented scale
[39:01] may be expected to begin almost
[39:03] immediately end quote this is completely
[39:05] different from brother branham who said
[39:07] the seventh seal was the literal day and
[39:09] hour of jesus's coming at the time of
[39:11] the gentile rapture and brother ram said
[39:13] the bride misses the persecution russell
[39:16] said the bride is persecuted to an
[39:18] unprecedented scale and notice russell
[39:20] said the seal of the living god was from
[39:22] revelation 7 verse 2 which brother
[39:24] branham said was the 144 000 jews so
[39:28] russell thought he and his followers
[39:29] were the 144 thousand jews brother ram
[39:32] did not think that brother brown knew it
[39:34] was literal jews so again brother brahm
[39:36] did not plagiarize charles russell on
[39:38] the seventh seal
[39:40] regarding clarence larkin in the seventh
[39:41] seal brother ram did use a lot of
[39:43] larkin's terminology and you can see
[39:45] that on my youtube video i'm not going
[39:46] to go into depth on that in this podcast
[39:49] but there was one major difference
[39:50] brother branham said the seventh seal
[39:52] was the day and hour of jesus coming
[39:54] according to matthew 24 36 but of that
[39:57] day and hour knoweth no man no not the
[39:59] angels of heaven but my father only
[40:02] clarence larkin never taught the seventh
[40:04] seal was the literal day and hour of the
[40:06] rapture sir brother ram used some of his
[40:08] thoughts but the timing of it and the
[40:10] exact identity of it was different
[40:12] brother branham had the revelation from
[40:14] god that it was the day and hour the
[40:15] rapture larkin did not have that
[40:17] revelation
[40:18] let's listen to brother rams say the
[40:19] seventh seal was the day and hour of the
[40:22] rapture seven
[40:25] figures under
[40:26] straight together
[40:29] mike was spelling out something
[40:31] notice at that time
[40:34] john's started right he said don't write
[40:36] it
[40:39] jesus
[40:40] never spoke of it
[40:42] john couldn't write it
[40:45] angels know nothing about it
[40:47] amen what is it
[40:49] it's the thing that jesus said even the
[40:53] angels of heaven didn't know nothing
[40:54] about it see
[40:58] he didn't know it himself amen he said
[41:01] only god would know it amen
[41:03] but he told us when we began to see
[41:05] these signs
[41:06] coming up
[41:08] now you're getting somewhere
[41:09] all right
[41:11] remember he hid the seventh seal from us
[41:14] he wouldn't do it when the angel stood
[41:16] day by day telling it but then he
[41:17] wouldn't do it on that so there's
[41:19] silence in heaven no one knew
[41:22] it was the coming of the lord
[41:24] because the seventh seal there was
[41:26] silence no one knew there was an inner
[41:28] hour that christ would come as he
[41:29] revealed the tooth
[41:32] and that last trumpet like the last seal
[41:35] will be the coming of the lord it shall
[41:37] sound in the dead in christ shall rise
[41:40] first
[41:41] just rest until that time
[41:43] that brings a conclusion to the seven
[41:45] seals and my conclusion is brother ram
[41:48] did have daily visitations from the holy
[41:50] ghost each day he sought god for the
[41:53] true meaning of the seven seals in march
[41:55] 1963. brother branham was not lying to
[41:58] us he was telling us the truth
[42:00] and again friends i have screenshots of
[42:02] all this history from charles russell's
[42:04] book and i can share those on a future
[42:06] youtube video if you'd like
[42:08] it just takes a lot of time to produce
[42:09] those which is fine i'd love to do it
[42:12] but i thought i could quickly get this
[42:14] podcast out to prove and show beyond a
[42:16] shadow of a doubt brother bram did not
[42:17] plagiarize the seven seals from larkin
[42:20] or from russell yes he used some of
[42:22] those thoughts
[42:23] but he did reference larkin and he
[42:25] referenced many books he was reading but
[42:27] the timing and meaning of the symbols
[42:29] and the four beasts almost every single
[42:31] one of them was completely different
[42:32] from those two men
[42:34] so my conclusion about brother graham's
[42:36] accuser saying brother branham
[42:38] plagiarized the seven seals is that the
[42:40] accusers are either being honest
[42:43] but have very weak and lazy research and
[42:46] of course are completely wrong
[42:48] or they're being dishonest deceptive
[42:51] and doing subjective research on purpose
[42:54] in order to defame brother brahms
[42:55] character
[42:56] only god knows which one it is but the
[42:58] research i've done clearly shows brother
[43:00] ram did not plagiarize either russell or
[43:03] larkin
[43:04] and i think it's easy to tell that their
[43:06] research was very weak and subjective
[43:08] because their videos were so short this
[43:10] means they didn't show much evidence for
[43:12] their claims at all and i'm not bragging
[43:15] or anything but look how long this
[43:16] podcast is it has to be so long because
[43:19] there's so much information there was so
[43:21] much research to do on all three men and
[43:24] any honest person would say this podcast
[43:26] has put much more research into the
[43:28] subject of charles russell brother
[43:30] branham and clarence larkin and their
[43:32] teachings on the seven seals and the
[43:34] seven church ages so i will continue to
[43:36] pray for brother graham's accusers that
[43:37] they'll repent and either stop doing
[43:39] research or with the repentant heart
[43:42] delete their old research and put out
[43:44] new research but it's likely they won't
[43:46] repent but i will not stop praying for
[43:48] them what a joy it is to defend jesus
[43:50] christ his message and his messenger
[43:57] differences about the seven church ages
[44:00] i'll briefly show the differences
[44:01] between charles russell brother branham
[44:04] and clarence larkin regarding their
[44:05] timing of the seven church ages and also
[44:07] their choice of messengers for a full
[44:09] teaching on larkin versus brother
[44:11] branham's understanding of the church
[44:12] ages see my youtube video as i
[44:14] referenced earlier
[44:16] the first church age ephesus
[44:18] charles day's russell said the messenger
[44:20] was paul which was the same as brother
[44:22] branham so they agreed on that
[44:24] clarence larkin said there was no
[44:25] messenger so brother braham did not get
[44:27] this idea about messengers from larkin
[44:29] but the timing of the first church age
[44:31] was slightly different russell said it
[44:33] started in 33 a.d and lasted to 73 a.d
[44:37] brother branham had the start date for
[44:39] 53 a.d which was 20 years different than
[44:42] charles russell and his end date was
[44:44] almost 100 years different
[44:46] in 170 a.d so again this is not
[44:49] plagiarism brother rams dates were
[44:51] closer to larkin larkin said the ephesus
[44:53] church age was from 70 to 170 a.d but
[44:56] again not exactly the same and friends
[44:58] before moving on remember that brother
[45:00] brahm did say he got the dates for the
[45:02] church ages from historians so brother
[45:04] ram never claimed those were all
[45:06] revealed by the holy spirit or that he
[45:07] had some new revelation no one else knew
[45:10] regarding the dates let's listen to the
[45:12] quote
[45:13] remember as i said before sometimes on
[45:15] these things we might disagree upon them
[45:18] as far as as the theology is concerned
[45:22] and most of my dates i take from the
[45:24] authentic uh
[45:26] historians which really not interested
[45:29] in any side they just wrote down facts
[45:31] whatever it was what the churches did
[45:34] and of course the divine part of the
[45:36] interpretation
[45:38] i tried to place it up on there myself
[45:40] the best that i know how
[45:43] so it's clear from listening to this
[45:45] quote that brother braham used dates
[45:46] from numerous historians when studying
[45:48] the church ages but then he looked to
[45:50] the lord for the revelation aspect of it
[45:52] the meaning of the symbols symbols and
[45:54] descriptions fit into each church age
[45:57] the second church age was smyrna
[45:59] charles dave's russell said the
[46:01] messenger was saint john the beloved
[46:04] brother braham said the messenger was
[46:05] iranius larkin did not have a messenger
[46:08] so we can see how brother ram did not
[46:10] plagiarize russell on the messenger
[46:13] regarding the dates russell said it
[46:15] lasted from 73 to 325 a.d
[46:18] but the brand's dates were completely
[46:19] different he said 170 80 to 312 a.d
[46:24] so brother adam did not plagiarize
[46:26] russell on the second church age
[46:28] brother rams dates did match larkin's
[46:30] dates which was 170 to 312 a.d but again
[46:34] brother brown didn't plagiarize he
[46:35] thanked the historians for all the dates
[46:37] as you just heard the quotes
[46:39] the third church age was pergamos
[46:41] charles day's russell said the messenger
[46:43] was aries brother bram said the
[46:45] messenger was saint martin larkin had no
[46:47] messenger
[46:48] regarding the dates russell said it was
[46:50] from 325 to 1160
[46:53] brother rams was completely different he
[46:56] said it was 312 so started earlier from
[46:58] 312 to 606. and again brother rams dates
[47:02] matched larkin but brother branham
[47:04] referenced historians for the date
[47:07] regarding the fourth church age thyatira
[47:09] charles russell said the messenger was
[47:11] peter waldow brother ram said the
[47:13] messenger was columba clarence larkin
[47:15] did not have a messenger so brother
[47:16] abraham didn't plagiarize the messengers
[47:19] from charleston's russell
[47:21] regarding the dates of the third tier in
[47:22] church age russell said one thousand one
[47:25] hundred sixty to thirteen seventy eight
[47:28] brother rams was completely different he
[47:29] said it went from six oh six to fifteen
[47:32] twenty a d and again brother bran's
[47:34] dates matched larkins exactly and
[47:36] brother ram referenced historians for
[47:38] the dates
[47:39] the sixth church age was sardis charles
[47:41] day's russell said the messenger was
[47:43] john wycliffe brother bram said the
[47:44] messenger was martin luther larkin did
[47:46] not have a messenger
[47:48] regarding the dates russell said it was
[47:50] 1378 1378-1517
[47:53] brother brahms was totally different on
[47:54] his dates he said 1520 to 1750. and
[47:58] again those dates from brother branham
[48:00] matched larkin's dates and brother
[48:02] branham referenced larkin and historians
[48:04] for their help the sixth church age was
[48:06] philadelphia charles russell said the
[48:09] messenger was martin luther brother
[48:10] brown said it was john wesley so brother
[48:12] ram didn't plagiarize that larkin didn't
[48:14] have any messengers
[48:16] regarding the dates russell said it was
[48:18] 1517 to 1874.
[48:21] brother rams was very different he said
[48:22] it was 1750 to 1906 and those dates were
[48:26] close to larkin but not exactly larkin
[48:28] started
[48:29] larkin ended his in 1900 brother branham
[48:32] ended his in 1906 their start dates were
[48:35] the same 1750 but their end dates were
[48:38] different
[48:39] regarding the final church age the
[48:41] laodicean church age russell said
[48:44] he was the messenger for that age but
[48:45] the random said it was elijah which we
[48:47] know was brother branham's ministry
[48:49] larkin did not have a messenger
[48:52] the time period for laodicea according
[48:53] to russell was 1874 to 1918. brother
[48:57] adams was totally different he said it
[48:59] began in 1906 and has not ended yet he
[49:02] says it ends at the rapture of the
[49:04] gentile church larkin state started at
[49:06] 1900 which was six years different from
[49:08] brother branham and he did not have an
[49:10] end date of course either
[49:12] so my conclusion regarding the church
[49:14] ages is that brother bram did not
[49:15] plagiarize them from russell they were
[49:17] very different it seems like he got some
[49:19] type of idea about the format from
[49:21] russell and larkin and of course brother
[49:23] branham's dates matched larkins very
[49:25] closely which was fine brother bran
[49:27] referenced larkin and historians for his
[49:29] dates he never claimed the dates were
[49:30] directly from god
[49:37] we have one listener question we'd like
[49:38] to answer and respond to joshua from
[49:41] india asked isn't it possible for the
[49:43] prophet brother braham to prophesy or
[49:45] speak thus saith the lord without saying
[49:47] thus saith the lord the answer is yes
[49:50] but remember brother ram told us and he
[49:51] cares do you care in 1963 he said the
[49:54] way to know for sure that god is
[49:55] speaking he said it will speak it it's
[49:57] thus saith the lord but no doubt there
[49:59] are times when a prophet can just speak
[50:01] something and it doesn't have to have
[50:02] thus saith the lord following it and it
[50:04] can be a prophecy
[50:06] for example brother rahm told florence
[50:08] humes in 1955 that she be healed from
[50:11] tuberculosis
[50:12] and he must have saw vision because he
[50:14] said go weigh yourself in the next two
[50:16] mondays and you'll know what i've told
[50:17] you is the truth
[50:18] so he had to see a vision and he told
[50:20] her she'd get healed which she did she
[50:22] lived over 50 years beyond that and was
[50:24] completely healed from tuberculosis
[50:26] brother braham did curse satan in the
[50:28] name of the lord jesus christ in that
[50:30] prayer line with sister humes and her
[50:32] healing came to pass so it was thus
[50:33] saith the lord even though brother ram
[50:34] didn't say thus saith the lord
[50:36] you also see that in the scripture paul
[50:38] told the philippian jailer believe on
[50:39] the lord jesus christ and thy in thy
[50:41] house shall be saved the bible doesn't
[50:43] record paul saying thus saith the lord
[50:45] but what paul said came to pass the
[50:46] philippian jailer invited paul into his
[50:48] house and barnabas and the flipping
[50:51] jailer he and his entire house were
[50:52] baptized and saved and they were
[50:54] baptized in the name of the lord that's
[50:56] according to acts chapter 16.
