TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Revelation chapter 9 the themes of this chapter are the sounding of the fifth and sixth trumpets and the passing of the first woe the fifth trumpet brings torment only not death on the earth for five months upon any person who does not have the seal of God or the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their foreheads which means everyone that is not one of the 144,000 Israelite believers will be tormented the torment comes from locusts that are like horses prepared for battle having faces of men hair like women and Tails like scorpions these locusts had a king over them which we believe will be Satan according to Revelation chapter 20 verses 1 to 3 revelation 9 verse 12 states that this fifth trumpet is also the first woe the sixth trumpet brings plagues and death as an army of 200 million horsemen with heads of lions kill one-third of the men on the earth who failed to repent of their wickedness based upon the descriptions of these horsemen no doubt they are not literal men but demons the timing of events is as follows although we could be wrong it seems the fifth trumpet follows the first four trumpets notice also that this fifth trumpet sounds after the 144,000 Jews are sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost according to Revelation chapter 9 verse 4 and then the sixth trumpet follows the fifth all of this takes place either during or after the three-and-a-half year Tribulation Period as we are not completely sure recall that each trumpet is initiated or pronounced by the two witnesses of Revelation chapter 11 the symbols and key revelations include God's protection of the 144,000 under the fifth trumpet and the hair of the horse shaped locusts that torment everyone for five months concerning God's protection of the 144,000 verse four states that the locusts will not torment those who are sealed with a seal of God in their foreheads which means the 144,000 Jews who were seal with the Holy Ghost in Revelation 7 verses 1 through 8 we again see the truth that the merciful God oftentimes protects true believers from torment as we know God spared Noah and his family from the flood and he spared Daniel from the Lions and the three Hebrew children from the fiery furnace he also spared the faithful Jews who sighed and cried for the Bauman's done in Jerusalem in Ezekiel chapter 9 concerning the hair of the horse shaped locusts in verse 8 we see the truth that God designed women to have long uncut hair as these tormenting locusts had hair as women st. Paul taught that all Christian women should have uncut hair which is their glory and also their covering according to 1st Corinthians 11 verses 1 to 16 it seems that during the 5th trumpet God is going to allow the tormenting locusts to have long uncut hair as a rebuke upon the unbelieving men and women who did not honor God's biblical requirements for hair length if you'd like more bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the book of Revelation please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
