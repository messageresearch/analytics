TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but we find here that God in spite of all the failure that Moses had done he still had his hand on him and he called him to go do his service calling him to his commission and what a consolation that must have been to Joshua when he heard God say as I was with Moses so will I be with you amen although if I'm trying and I fail God won't leave me I don't have much confidence in anybody's too afraid to do anything I'd rather be found a failure than too lazy to try one time it was said that the Ballard and Ballard Flower Company hired a man and he was going to sign his name and the man had no eraser on the end of his p canel and Mr Ballard said to him said why haven't you got a razor he said I don't make mistakes he said then I can't use you because if you make mistakes you you don't make mistakes you won't do nothing that's true God don't hold you responsible for your mistakes he holds you responsible for all your will willful sins he that sins willfully after he has received the knowledge of the truth but a man that's going to do something's going to blunder he's going to fall he's going to make mistakes but if he's really divinely calling God in his heart he'll Rise Again amen used to be coming to the church here years ago and they may be here this morning a little man and his wife they used to sing a song that Thrill Me go something like this forgive me Lord and try me one more time I'll be yours if you be mine if I follow if I fail let me rise and try again forgive me Lord and try me one more time I like that amen for any good soldiers that to get wounded or hurt but if he's still a soldier and got a purpose and something to fight for he'll rise and try again any good soldier of the Cross will do the same thing and to Joshua the new commander of the army after Moses had passed on seeing that God stayed with him in his mistakes he held his commission up no matter what Moses done it was Moses office that God respected he was a prophet he was above all the prophets he was really more than any Prophet that had when his own sister laugh that him for marrying an Ethiopian girl he called him together and he said don't you fear God said if there be one among you who spiritually a prophet I will speak to him in visions and make myself known to him in dreams but it's not so with Moses I speak lip to ear with him don't you fear God see that's not a good thing to upon God's people you heard him when you do so God had commissioned Moses his failures meant nothing God know his heart and he one time Moses complained about having too much to do and so God took his spirit and divided among 70 they had no more Spirit than they had at the beginning but only a thing they just had more Machinery same amount of spirit God can put his entire Spirit Upon A man if he wants to he can scattered amongst thousands if he wants to one day he put his whole Spirit Up On A Man Called Jesus now he scattered it through his churches everywhere God keeps his Commission now Joshua the new Warrior only two left now that ever left the promised land that was Joshua and Caleb now Joshua the new Commander to lead an army to step into the place where a great man like Moses stood it was no little task I think of a minister today that's called of God to step into the tracks where Jesus stood am what a command what a commission but each is called of God is commission to stand in that same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the way each minister is called to stand where he did the works that I do shall you do also each minister is our dained of God is commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus perform that's quite a command and how it must have felt when Joshua standing there that morning talking to God he said I'll not fail thee and as I was with Moses so I be with you no man shall stand before you all the days of your life I will destroy and devire I'll make the way clear only be strong and very courageous be not dismayed that's wearied don't be afraid I'm with you I'll see you through what a commission to be given to this new man called Joshua
