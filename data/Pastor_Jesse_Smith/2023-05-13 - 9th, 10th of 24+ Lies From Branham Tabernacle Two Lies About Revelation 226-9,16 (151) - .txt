TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] that's good but that is just that's just being able to read the Tabernacle because these people claim to believe every word that you say to be true but they don't I don't believe that their own actions prove that they don't greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to continue the series on the 24 or more lies coming out of Branham Tabernacle located in Jeffersonville first let's review the first eight lies before moving on to the ninth and tenth lies the first lie is every word on brother bram's tapes is thus saith the Lord the second lie is all the answers are on brother Rams tapes the third Lie Is We must unquestionably believe every word on brother branham's tapes even if brother random lied the fourth lie is that preachers have to catch a false Vision that is also a denominational mandate that preachers have to play the tapes as the primary event in the worship service the fifth lie is that the tapes are the token and being part of a tape church is the evidence of having the token the sixth lie is that Tate boys are the true five-fold Ministry and playing tapes is number one in the fivefold ministry the seventh lie is that brother branham's human spirit and mind and soul are identical to the Lord Jesus Christ Spirit mind and soul the eighth lie is that brother Branham has a living Ministry today and anyone who doesn't believe that is a Demas so now let's move on to the 9th and tenth lie both these lies come from the same statement made by the leadership at Branham Tabernacle and also there's a moment where Branham Tabernacles Pastor again does name-calling to anyone who disagrees with his lies so the ninth lie is that revelation 22 verse 16 is Jesus telling us to be taped churches and of course this is a lie so let's listen to the full quote in context praise the Lord you know many critics I hate to go in that direction after saying that but without Revelation say brother Branham never said play tapes in church that's called ears but can't hear that's what it's called others say we just believe the Bible and it don't say it in the Bible neither well I've got news for both of you it does say it in the Bible Jesus himself said play tapes in your local churches [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so maybe if they won't hear Brother random maybe they'll hear the word praise the Lord here it is the last thing Jesus is telling his bride in his word listen s my angel now we've been talking about this angel is Malachi 4 5 this Luke 17 30. we've been talking about him he's the he's this angel that told John all the secrets that's that angel to do what to testify unto you these things things all the Mysteries all the seals oh everything all the Mysteries where is he supposed to do it in the churches [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] praise the name of the Lord remain standing isn't that wonderful there it is right there in the word you got a Scofield bible and if you haven't done it read in your Scofield bible on your churches and read down in the column and see what those churches are this is local [Music] [Applause] churches he sent his Angel to preach in the churches and the only way you can do that is by pressing play playing this message this is the will of the Lord it's the perfect [Applause] with this word now that we've heard the LIE here's a few points I want to make first the Bible never said to play tapes in every Church the Bible supports living men who are currently alive on the Earth are to preach God's Living Word of course this is found in Ephesians 4 verses 8-16 and also Romans 10 verses 13 through 17 and II Timothy 4 verse 2 and 2nd Timothy 2 verse 2. notice how incredibly sad it is to see Branham tabernacle's leadership saying something Jesus never said now I want to be gracious here because as a minister I've made mistakes and all ministers make mistakes so I'm asking God for Mercy to have mercy on Brandon tabernacle's leadership because all preachers make mistakes even me even brother Branham every preacher makes mistakes but when a preacher is shown his mistake he should repent and then make it right publicly if he preached something wrong publicly which I've had to do numerous times and I'll continue to do by the grace of God the second point is brother Graham never said every church has to play tapes as their primary event in the worship service there are no quotes that say every church should play brother Rams tapes first above living preachers I think if my memory serves me correct there's only two quotes or brother random encourages people to play tapes I think it's in questions and answers 1964 and in those cases the Believers had no living preachers to preach to them so brother random allowed them to play tapes brother Brown we have no preacher where we live that we have tape service on Sunday night only should we take our children to another church for Sunday school are the tape Services sufficient well let that be according to where your children are going see now if you get your children that are young and you get them out into some kind of a group out there that'll just pound the stuff into them at the if they they shouldn't know I wouldn't do it if they if they seem to learn enough from the tapes and things and you say you put them over in a Catholic Church take them over to Catholic Church more or something like that I wouldn't advise that the if they uh but now if you got a nice little church or that maybe disagree to other things with you and your children want to go to Sunday school they're full gospel people or something like that's perfectly all right but see when you come to a place where it depends on how your children take it so you watch what your children does on how they react to it and see if you don't have a church to go to should you just listen to the tapes yes that's uh that'd be fine do but anyone who's listening to brother Branham knows the majority of the quotes from Brother Branham say that the fivefold ministry will perfect the Bride of Jesus Christ because that's what the Bible says and brother Rand tells preachers he's right behind them preach as hard as you can don't change a thing about the Evangelical fivefold Ministry and yet Branham Tabernacle has changed everything by putting tape playing above living preachers Also regarding the two quotes where brother Branham says it's okay to stay at home and play tapes you've got to take that into context because two sermons earlier and questions and answers part one brother random gave a Stern warning to people that filed his message to go to church brother Brown said if you can't come here to the Tabernacle get some church somewhere go to it he said sure you go to church wherever the church doors open you take off as hard as you can go and then brother Brown tells a story about some ministers who tried to get followers of brother Branham to go to church and they would not go to church and brother Branham rebuked them but the RAM said if they stayed at home they dishonor the resurrection of Christ but the RAM said quote you go to church somewhere end quote brother Ram said he would go to church at a church if they only believe one thing that he believed that Jesus was the son of God let's listen to the quotes you don't have to take all they do what part of bread they're serving you serve the bread well they got the garlic while you just leave it alone see Brian I can't make them you know that's the time sure you go to church wherever the church door opens you take off as hard as you can go that's if they don't believe what now you don't have to protect don't join them don't join in them churches but go to and fellowship with them how do you know it's not the Lord he said to make everything work together for the good and maybe there's soul in her ought to be saved and you can Shine the ride to them should we go to the other churches even when they disagree with you sure yep just did when they disagree with him go ahead uh we know to Sharon said uh it should we go to another church that disagrees with you sure I know I'm not the only people on the beach you know there's this other a godly man everywhere I hope I'm one of them but don't never get down here I was called in on something like this uh the other day a group in Arizona called my attention to that see administer a group said the only thing that we have against you brother Graham is one of the things the people that's come down here with you we can't get them to go to church anywhere so they got children and everything they won't go to church and said well we told me welcome down come to our church I know they put a pressure on you I want you to join but you don't have to join but but damn kids in Sunday school somewhere and you're going to church don't sit at home go fishing hunting and things like that on Sunday you said well I'm not a legalism well you better be in that manner for a while dishonoring the resurrection of Christ you go to church somewhere if I if I went if I couldn't get if I went to a certain church I know there's only one thing that people ever said that I believe they said they believed Jesus was Son of God they said it I doubt it but I go hear him say that maybe say that's this church May the next Church would be something like the Baptist they say yeah yeah I experience I'll go with them that then I believe Jesus Christ the son of God I believe you have to have an experience all right then maybe there's Assemblies of God now they believe uh see all right now I can hear about three or four slices of bread with them see so friends it's a shame most people that follow Brenham Tabernacle do not even physically attend a home church I know there's construction going on regarding a new Branham Tabernacle but that doesn't do away with a command from Hebrews 10 24 and 25 that every believer should attend a physical church and gather with Believers somewhere and do it more as the day approaches and of course we'll have a separate video on this later by God's grace the third point is that the word churches in revelation 22 verse 16 refers to the seven Gentile churches mentioned earlier in the Book of Revelation Revelation 1 verse 11. revelation 22 verse 16 says I Jesus have sent mine Angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star so Branham Tabernacle falsely interprets the word churches here as meaning every local church in the seventh Church age revelation 22 verse 16 never says in the churches in laodicea so again Branham Tabernacle is adding to the word of God of course in this scripture Jesus means he sent his Angel to testify to John these things in the seven churches and of course that aligns with Revelation 1 verse 11 which says saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seeest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus and unto Smyrna and unto pergamos and unto thyatira and unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto laodicea now of course the Book of Revelation has at least three applications it applied to the literal seven churches the Gentile churches in Asia that received these letters around 90 or 100 A.D but second they also had a prophetic meaning to the Future seven Church ages and then third of course they apply to the individual every individual knows what it's like to leave their first love like it says in the letter to Ephesus and then every believer understands the importance of being hot for Jesus and not being lukewarm or cold as a letter to the lay of the decisions speaks of so there's at least three applications to the letters to the seven churches so finishing up on this ninth lie Jesus is not telling the laodicean church age to be taped churches in revelation 22 verse 16. Jesus is reiterating before the end of this book that he sent his Angel whether it's a Heavenly angel or a theophany of a past Prophet to testify unto John the entire Book of Revelation 2 the seven Gentile churches mentioned Revelation 1 verse 11. moving on to the tenth lie Branham Tabernacle said that the angel of revelation 22 verses 6 through 9 and 2216 is brother Branham and I believe this is a lie for at least two reasons before going over the two reasons let's listen to this lie again so you can understand the context the last thing Jesus is telling his bride in his word listen Jesus hi now we've been talking about this angel is Malachi 4 5 this Luke 17 30. we've been talking about him he's the he's this angel that told John all the secrets that's that angel to do what to testify unto you these things what things all the Mysteries all the seals oh everything all the Mysteries so Point number one proving This Is A Lie Is that brother Brandon himself taught on numerous occasions that there is no pre-existence of souls brother random cannot be the angel of revelation 22 and really of the entire Book of Revelation so the proof of this is found in who is this Melchizedek 1965 and also in the church age book so let's listen to these two quotes you'll see brother random said every man started in the mind of God and then came to flesh brother Rayner said only Jesus went from the mind of God to theophany to flesh and who is this Melchizedek 1965 brother Ram taught that Jesus came down the regular line and the regular line was four parts the first part was attribute in the mind of God the second part was theophany the third part was flesh body and the fourth part was a glorified body so Jesus came from attribute theophany flesh glorified but brother Graham said we bypassed that second stage theophany so our order is different than Jesus's order we went from attribute in the mind of God to a flesh body so in other words we did not pre-exist our souls did not pre-exist before we came in these bodies of Flesh each human's order of existence goes attribute one number two flesh number three theophany and fourth glorified So based on this brother random could not have been the angel or Prophet that revealed The Book of Revelation to Saint John that's because there's no pre-existence of souls brother Bram did not pre-exist in a theophany body before he came to the Earth because no one does except the Lord Jesus Christ so let's listen to the quotes from who's this Melchizedek and the quotes from the church age book s [Music] that could appear disappear and then he become fresh and return back again resurrected that same body in a very bad condition that your dad passed the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted and sin and then if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting amen we have not yet the batteries but now before I close this subject I know there is a question in your minds you will want to know if I believe in the doctrine of pre-existence I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of souls any more than I believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of Souls be careful here and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word or seed that is it way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated Romans 9 13. and neither was born and neither had done good or evil see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and Covenant of God now the second point is that the angel of revelation 22 was likely a Heavenly Angel and not a theophany of a human being or prophet so the U in revelation 22 16 is not Branham Tabernacle and it is not the Believers of the laodicean church age I'll read it again I Jesus have sent mine Angel to testify unto you the you is Saint John Jesus is saying I have sent mine Angel my heavenly Angel most likely to testify unto you Saint John these things in the churches meaning John was going to get the Revelation from Jesus's Angel and then share it with the seven churches now let's prove this by Brother Rams quotes even there's numerous quotes where brother Ram says this angel that was sent to John to give the Book of Revelation was a Heavenly Angel here's one from the manifestation of the spirit 1951. and notice brother Branham said it was a prophetic spirit that was an anointing this heavenly Angel let's listen to the quote testify these things is that right and the whole book of Revelations we showed John and the angel of the Lord is that right and John fell down to worship the angel angel said see that you do it not is that right for I am a godfellow servants the prophet is that true the prophetic spirits that have been on the prophet down to the age will share a prophesying through John's showing him by an Angel that same spirit is in the building tonight here's a second quote from the presence of the Lord Jesus 1955 brother Ram says it again he says we do not know who the angel was in the context he's talking how God sends Heavenly angels to the Believers such as Gabriel so let's listen to the quote Jesus has set my angel to signify these things which will shortly come to pass now a true angel you're going to throw back Jules of Smith and so forth to me but Lance it don't work with the scripture a real true angel will come and vindicate this scripture to the dance that's it now the prophets worship God a true Angel won't be worshiped it's not worship of Angel it's a it's a Ministry of angels that comes from God now these Niner Angels comes perhaps this Angel's with us or come see your your Rumble servant if that's probably a minor Angel but when Gabriel comes granted there's something really on the road me Gabriel announced the first coming of the Lord Jesus and Gabriel will announce the second coming of the Lord Jesus amen and lastly to show the balance brother Brown said this Angel could have been Elijah he said this in the revelation of Jesus Christ 1960. so again we have quotes on both sides we have quotes that brother Brown says this Angel sent to John was a Heavenly Angel and then we have quotes from Brother Brown said it could have been a theophany of a human Prophet so again this proves not every word brother Branham said is thus saith the Lord if you make every word of brother Branham thus saith the Lord then this is a contradiction because in one place he said it's a Heavenly Angel and another place he said it could be Elijah so we're thankful that real Believers have the right balance they can rightly divide the word of God by the Holy Ghost so let's listen to this quote from the revelation of Jesus Christ 1960. the Bible doesn't say who the angel was but we know that it was a problem what the Bible later said Jesus has set my angel to testify these things which surely come to pass then we find out that when John started to worship the angel the angel said see that you do it now Revelations 22 I believe it is and then he says for I am about fellow servants and as the presence live in America the castle but this planet was sent and John being the careful look at the nature of the rest of his Epistles prove that was John wrote it before closing I want to add another lie coming out of random Tabernacle if you noticed earlier in the quote random Tabernacles leadership name called again and said anyone who doesn't agree with these ninth and tenth lies is fulfilling the scripture about unbelievers found in Matthew 13 verses 10 through 16 and also acts 22 verses 27-29 and Romans 11 verses 7 through 11. so let's again listen to this lie coming from Branham tabernacle's leadership that says anyone that disagrees with them has ears that cannot hear the Lord you know many critics I hate to go in that direction after saying that but without Revelation say brother Branham never said play tapes in church that's called ears but can't hear you that's what it's called others say we just believe the Bible and it don't say it in the Bible neither so friends notice Branham Tabernacles leadership are exalting themselves as the ones who are the Blessed because they have ears that can hear that Jesus said we're all supposed to play tapes in our churches which is a lie it's not found in the Bible and Bram Tabernacle leadership is making the group who's in the right Believers like you and I who believe in living preachers as God's provided way to lead the church today random Tabernacle is making the true group out to be the group that does not have the ears to hear the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven and as usual Brenham Tabernacle is guilty of what they're accusing others of random Tabernacle is saying our hearts are wax gross because we cannot hear with our ears and wax gross in the Greek means to make thick to make stupid to render the soul Dole or callous Supreme Tabernacle is saying we have dull or calloused ears because we don't play tapes in our churches as the main event of the worship service and of course Branham Tabernacle is wrong and notice friends this is one of the most severe accusations someone can give to another because Jesus used this against the blinded Jews who rejected his ministry Paul used it against the Jews who rejected his ministry to the Gentiles and Paul used it about Jews who were blinded to the Messiah in the previous scriptures mentioned and the sad part is again Branham tabernacle's leadership is misinterpreting revelation 22 16 because the Bible never places Tate boys above Apostles prophets evangelists teachers and pastors from Ephesians 4 verses 8 through 16. they're ignoring the fact that only living preachers preach the gospel according to Romans 10 verses 13-17 they're ignoring where Paul said preach the word he didn't say play the word Paul said preach the word in second Timothy 4 verse 2 right before he was martyred Paul never changes gospel and then Paul said also in second Timothy 2 verse 2 commit the gospel to Faithful Men not faithful tape players or not faithful tape boys because Faithful Men would teach others also he never said Faithful Men would play the word to others also so friends who is the group that is changing Paul's gospel it's Branham Tabernacle who is the group that's keeping every iota of Paul's gospel well by God's grace that's those of us who believe in the true faithful Ministry and do not add tape voice to the fivefold ministry in closing let's close with another word of Prayer in hopes that at least one or more of the people caught in the Trap of the state Church movement will repent father God I come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I humbly ask God that these truths the Lord could be shared with those who are deceived and caught in the snare of this man-made denominational system of the tape Ministry Lord Jesus May those in the tape church ministry have ears to hear may they understand that their leadership is adding to the Bible and even adding to brother Ram's tapes as they worship brother Ram's tapes so God be merciful Lord your word will not return void I know you'll take videos like this and other videos of other ministers who believe the truth and you'll direct them to all those who are predestinated and elected and chosen and foreknown to eternal life father I pray you do this in your mercy by Your Grace by your Holy Spirit we know all things are possible to them that believe we know all that the father has given to you will come we thank you God for your grace and mercy and may the Holy Ghost Minister true to those who want to hear it I ask all this in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart foreign
