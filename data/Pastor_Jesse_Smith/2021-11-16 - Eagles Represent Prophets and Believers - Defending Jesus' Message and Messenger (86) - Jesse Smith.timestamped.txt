[0:00] [Music]
[0:07] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:09] of the lord jesus christ
[0:11] do eagles represent prophets
[0:15] the answer is yes based upon two
[0:18] scriptures
[0:19] and it's also apparent jesus christ
[0:21] himself
[0:22] uses eagles to represent believers and
[0:25] specifically the believers alive at the
[0:28] time of his second coming
[0:31] there is a group of people who have left
[0:33] the bible-based teachings of brother
[0:35] william branham
[0:37] who i'll call
[0:38] accusers of brother branham and they
[0:41] claim that the bible does not compare
[0:43] god's prophets to eagles
[0:46] they state this of course in a sad
[0:48] attempt to discredit brother branham as
[0:51] a true prophet of god
[0:53] the purpose of this video is to show
[0:55] brother branham was right and his
[0:56] accusers are wrong
[1:00] eagles represent the prophets moses and
[1:03] aaron
[1:04] there are 34 uses of the word eagle or
[1:07] eagles in the king james version 30 in
[1:10] the old testament and 4 in the new
[1:12] testament
[1:14] it's interesting to note god uses the
[1:16] eagle to represent swiftness and
[1:19] strength
[1:20] in both evil and good people
[1:22] the eagle also represents watchfulness
[1:25] in believers
[1:27] if you have questions about those
[1:28] scriptures contact me personally or do
[1:31] your own concordance word search
[1:34] to prove eagles represent prophets you
[1:37] look at the very first use of the word
[1:39] eagle from exodus 19 verse 4.
[1:42] this verse is alluding to moses and
[1:45] aaron as eagles and both men were
[1:48] prophets
[1:49] exodus 19 verse 4 says ye have seen what
[1:52] i did unto the egyptians and how i bear
[1:55] you on eagle's wings and brought you
[1:58] unto myself
[2:00] notice god used two eagle wings to bring
[2:02] israel out of egypt to himself
[2:05] god appears to be the eagle in this
[2:07] verse
[2:08] as albert barnes taught as well and he
[2:11] also likened himself to an eagle in
[2:13] deuteronomy 32 verses 11 through 13
[2:17] which says
[2:18] as an eagle stirth up her nest
[2:20] fluttereth over her young spreadeth
[2:23] abroad her wings taketh them beareth
[2:25] them on her wings so the lord alone did
[2:28] lead them and there was no strange god
[2:30] with him
[2:32] he made him ride on the high places of
[2:34] the earth that he might eat the increase
[2:36] of the fields and he made him to suck
[2:39] honey out of the rock
[2:41] and oil out of the flinty rock
[2:45] back to exodus 19 verse 4
[2:47] notice the two wings of the eagle
[2:50] first samuel 12 verses 6 through 8 is
[2:53] the second portion of scripture that
[2:55] alludes to moses and aaron being the two
[2:58] wings or prophets that brought israel
[3:01] out of egypt
[3:02] verses 6 and 8 declare
[3:05] and samuel said unto the people it is
[3:07] the lord that advanced moses and aaron
[3:10] and that brought your fathers out of the
[3:11] land of egypt
[3:13] when jacob was come into egypt and your
[3:15] fathers cried unto the lord then the
[3:17] lord sent moses and aaron which brought
[3:20] forth your fathers out of egypt and made
[3:23] them dwell in this place
[3:26] so we see similar wording in both
[3:28] scriptures about both wings and two
[3:31] prophets bringing israel out of egypt
[3:34] notice exodus 19 verse 4 says how i bear
[3:38] you on eagle's wings and brought you
[3:40] unto myself
[3:41] and first samuel 12 6
[3:44] and verse 8 says moses and aaron that
[3:46] brought your fathers up out of the land
[3:49] of egypt
[3:51] notice the same words of brought you and
[3:54] brought your in reference to how god
[3:56] brought israel out of egypt he used
[3:59] moses and aaron the two eagle wings
[4:04] many scriptures call moses a prophet
[4:06] such as deuteronomy 34 verse 10 so
[4:08] there's no debate about that but some
[4:11] might question aaron as a prophet but
[4:13] exodus 7 verse 1 records god himself
[4:16] calling aaron moses prophet
[4:19] exodus 7 verse 1 says and the lord said
[4:22] unto moses see i have made thee a god to
[4:25] pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be
[4:27] thy prophet
[4:29] the prophetic gift must have been upon
[4:31] moses's family for miriam also had the
[4:34] gift of prophecy according to exodus 15
[4:37] verse 20 which says and miriam the
[4:40] prophetess the sister of aaron took a
[4:43] timbrel in her hand and all the women
[4:45] went out after her with timbrels and
[4:47] with dances
[4:49] it's easy to see the similarities
[4:51] between a prophet and an eagle and how
[4:53] they can be both used interchangeably as
[4:56] both have amazing eyesight the ego and
[4:59] the natural and the prophet in the
[5:01] spiritual the bible calls prophets seers
[5:04] because of the heavenly visions they see
[5:07] which correlates to the amazing eyesight
[5:09] of eagles who can see their prey from a
[5:11] mile away
[5:14] first samuel 9 verse 9 says before time
[5:16] in israel when when a man went to
[5:18] inquire of god thus he spake come and
[5:21] let us go to the seer for he that is now
[5:24] called a prophet was before time called
[5:26] a seer
[5:28] jesus calls end time believers eagles
[5:31] the gospels have two instances of jesus
[5:34] calling believers eagles which are
[5:36] matthew 24 28 and luke 17 verse 37.
[5:41] these are parallel passages so they are
[5:43] records of the same event
[5:45] both texts give us a full context of how
[5:48] christ jesus represents end time
[5:50] believers as eagles
[5:52] first here's what matthew 24 verse 28
[5:55] says and notice the context is also the
[5:58] second coming of the son of man
[6:00] for as the lightning cometh out of the
[6:02] east and shineth even unto the west
[6:05] so shall also the coming of the son of
[6:07] man be
[6:08] for wheresoever the carcass is there
[6:11] will the eagles be gathered together
[6:14] moving to luke 17 verses 34 through 37
[6:18] notice the context is again the second
[6:20] coming of jesus christ which will be the
[6:23] pre-tribulation rapture for jesus gives
[6:26] three situations in which one person is
[6:28] left and the other is taken
[6:31] it says i tell you in that night there
[6:33] shall be two men in one bed the one
[6:36] shall be taken and the other shall be
[6:38] left
[6:39] two women shall be grinding together the
[6:41] one shall be taken and the other left
[6:43] two men shall be in the field the one
[6:45] shall be taken and the other left and
[6:47] they answered and said unto him where
[6:49] lord and he said unto them wheresoever
[6:52] the body is thither will the eagles be
[6:54] gathered together
[6:57] any honest bible reader concludes that
[6:59] believers will be gathered around the
[7:01] meat of god's word at the time of
[7:03] jesus's second coming
[7:05] meat in the new testament is likened
[7:07] unto both the perfect will of god by
[7:10] jesus christ in john 4
[7:13] 34 and also deep mature teachings that
[7:17] differentiate mature believers from
[7:19] immature believers
[7:21] john 4 verse 34 says jesus saith unto
[7:24] them my meat is to do the will of him
[7:26] that sent me and to finish his work
[7:30] mature meat-eating believers are able to
[7:32] discern good and evil in their daily
[7:35] lives according to hebrews 5
[7:37] 14
[7:39] but strong meat belonged to them that
[7:41] are of full age even those who by reason
[7:44] of use have their senses exercised to
[7:47] discern both good and evil
[7:50] there is also the truth of the carcass
[7:52] or body being fresh meat or the message
[7:55] of the hour peter calls this present
[7:57] truth in second peter 1 verse 12 saying
[8:00] wherefore i will not be negligent to put
[8:03] you always in remembrance of these
[8:04] things though you know them and be
[8:07] established in the present truth
[8:10] there have been times throughout the
[8:11] church ages when truth was lost to the
[8:14] believers but not to god
[8:16] god is infinite and never loses truth or
[8:19] revelations
[8:20] but truth was lost in the church ages
[8:22] such as the doctrine of the one person
[8:24] godhead
[8:26] in my latest book the twelve new
[8:28] testament mysteries revealed there's a
[8:30] section fully teaching this truth on
[8:32] pages 421-425
[8:36] seven scriptures speak of a full
[8:38] restoration of truth at jesus's second
[8:41] coming those scriptures are matthew 17
[8:43] 11 acts 3 20 through 21 joel 2 verses 23
[8:48] through 26 daniel 12 4 daniel 12 9
[8:53] revelation 10 verses 7 through 11 and
[8:56] matthew 24 verse 14.
[8:59] so this evidence points to the fact that
[9:01] some truth would be lost during the 2000
[9:03] year-long time of the gentiles as jesus
[9:07] called it in luke 21 24 or seven gentile
[9:11] church ages
[9:12] ecclesiastes 3 verse 6 also shows how
[9:15] there are times to get and times to lose
[9:19] this speaks of both natural and
[9:20] spiritual as revelation 2 verses 4 and 5
[9:24] speaks of leaving your first love and
[9:26] jesus promises it can be restored
[9:29] see my book for the full teaching and if
[9:31] you'd like a free copy and can't afford
[9:33] one i'll be happy to mail you one
[9:35] the reality that there are ages is
[9:37] firmly taught in the bible
[9:39] despite either the lies or ignorance of
[9:42] brother branham's accusers
[9:44] who have left brother branham's message
[9:46] in the following scriptures you find the
[9:48] truth ephesians 3 verse 5 and colossians
[9:51] 1 verse 26
[9:53] which speak up past ages
[9:55] and ephesians 3 verse 21 which speaks of
[9:58] future ages
[9:59] if paul in the bible speaks of past and
[10:02] future ages then he must have been
[10:04] living in an age himself which he was
[10:07] the ephesian church age
[10:11] more bible proof about eagles
[10:14] four more scriptures prove eagles can
[10:15] refer to god his prophets and true
[10:18] believers
[10:20] ephesians 4 verse 11 places prophets as
[10:23] an office in the five full ministry
[10:25] which jesus christ himself set up and
[10:27] ordained to edify the body of christ
[10:30] it is undeniable there is a prophetic
[10:32] preaching gift within the body of jesus
[10:34] christ and first corinthians 12 10 also
[10:37] teaches any member of the body of christ
[10:40] can have the gift of prophecy even if he
[10:42] or she is not a preacher
[10:45] further every true born again holy
[10:48] ghost-filled christian has the spirit of
[10:50] prophecy in their lives according to
[10:52] scriptures revelation 19 verse 10 and
[10:56] john 16 13 a believer has a testimony of
[10:59] jesus christ which is the spirit of
[11:01] prophecy
[11:02] revelation 19 10
[11:04] for the testimony of jesus is the spirit
[11:07] of prophecy
[11:08] john 16 13 how be it when he the spirit
[11:12] of truth is come he will guide you into
[11:14] all truth for he shall not speak of
[11:16] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[11:19] that shall he speak and he will show you
[11:21] things to come
[11:23] friend god shows the believers things to
[11:25] come as i've seen it in my life on
[11:27] numerous occasions whether through a
[11:29] dream or a word from the lord
[11:32] just in my simple humble insignificant
[11:34] little life the spirit of jesus christ
[11:37] has foretold the future in the following
[11:39] ways
[11:41] first on numerous occasions we've needed
[11:43] prayer for serious needs
[11:45] and believers have spoken words of
[11:47] comfort for telling the outcome of the
[11:49] events before they've happened
[11:52] second both my wife and i have had
[11:54] dreams warning believers of their fall
[11:56] from the truth and we share them with
[11:58] the individuals who did not take heed to
[12:01] the dreams and those individuals fell
[12:03] into the sins they were warned of in the
[12:05] dreams
[12:07] third before giving birth to one of our
[12:09] children my wife had a dream giving us
[12:11] the name for the child and the details
[12:14] of his birth that there would be no
[12:16] midwife present and the dream came to
[12:18] pass exactly in that manner
[12:21] fourth one friend of mine told me twice
[12:24] i have prophesied to him and didn't
[12:26] realize it regarding a season of rest
[12:28] that was coming
[12:29] and the removal of an administrator we
[12:32] needed in order to preach with freedom
[12:34] the gospel in a public school
[12:37] if end time believers are eagles as
[12:40] jesus says all believers are eagles
[12:42] throughout all the ages for god is
[12:45] father eagle as he declared in
[12:47] deuteronomy
[12:48] and within the family of believers are
[12:50] prophet eagles whose main ministry is to
[12:52] foretell the future
[12:55] the eagle anointing
[12:57] the final scriptures about eagles are in
[12:59] revelation 4 verse 7
[13:01] and revelation 6 verses 7 through 8.
[13:04] in revelation 4 verse 7 we see four
[13:06] beasts around jesus's throne and the
[13:09] fourth and final one is the flying eagle
[13:12] and the first beast was like a lion and
[13:14] the second beast like a calf and the
[13:16] third beast had a face as a man and the
[13:19] fourth beast was like a flying eagle
[13:22] in revelation 6 verses 7 through 8 this
[13:26] fourth beast shows john the fourth horse
[13:28] rider of the four seal and the rider is
[13:31] death
[13:32] and when he had opened the fourth seal i
[13:34] heard the voice of the fourth beast
[13:36] saying come and see and i looked and
[13:38] behold a pale horse and his name that
[13:40] sat on him was death and hell followed
[13:43] with him and power was given unto them
[13:45] over the fourth part of the earth to
[13:47] kill the sword and with hunger and with
[13:49] death and with the beasts of the earth
[13:52] although mysterious to some god has
[13:54] shown us the revelation of these four
[13:56] beasts
[13:57] for they are throne guards to jesus's
[13:59] throne
[14:01] these four beasts are also seen in
[14:02] ezekiel chapters 1 and 10.
[14:05] here are some visuals and they are not
[14:07] my original work
[14:09] if i can find the references i'll place
[14:11] them in the video
[14:12] two examples are evident in the old
[14:14] testament the 12 tribes were arranged in
[14:17] four groups around the ark or throne of
[14:19] god's presence and historians like
[14:22] matthew george easton author of easton's
[14:24] bible dictionary say jewish historians
[14:27] claim the four groups had four banners
[14:30] with the lion ox man and eagle
[14:33] the second example is the four gospels
[14:35] in the book of acts the book of acts
[14:37] represents the presence of god acting in
[14:39] the church and their acts teaching and
[14:43] doctrines are all guarded by the four
[14:44] gospels of matthew mark luke and john
[14:48] in other words jesus's life power and
[14:50] teachings in the four gospels paved the
[14:53] way for the book of acts
[14:54] the apostles in acts were completely
[14:57] ordained and directed by jesus christ
[15:00] and in complete harmony with his three
[15:02] and a half year ministry recorded in the
[15:04] four gospels
[15:06] note that the holy ghost had brother
[15:07] branham speak this truth about the four
[15:09] beasts as thus saith the lord in march
[15:12] of 1963.
[15:14] let's listen to the quote
[15:16] but the antichrist is cunning he's got
[15:18] all kinds of things that represents
[15:20] christianity only got off on the other
[15:22] side something against the original
[15:23] doctrine of it that's what makes him
[15:25] antichrist
[15:27] so the reformers when the beast went
[15:29] forth in the form of a of a man to
[15:32] combat that i don't forget this class
[15:35] don't forget it
[15:37] see
[15:38] remember all the days of your life
[15:42] i think these beasts are correct it's
[15:45] thus saith the lord
[15:49] brother branham said the four beasts
[15:51] were anointings of the holy ghost
[15:53] believers who lived in the time of the
[15:55] gentile church ages would need to
[15:57] overcome satan and his antichrist spirit
[16:01] this is accurate especially in light of
[16:03] the seven seals
[16:05] which the fourth beast the flying eagle
[16:07] reveals in his words to john
[16:10] the flying eagle revealed the identity
[16:12] of the fourth horse rider which was
[16:14] death
[16:15] death is a spirit and must be the
[16:17] antichrist spirit for god's spirit or
[16:20] spirit of christ is life
[16:22] romans 8 verse 2 plainly teaches this
[16:25] for the law of the spirit of life in
[16:27] christ jesus hath made us free from the
[16:30] law of sin and death
[16:32] so the flying eagle anointing is the
[16:34] anointing of the holy ghost upon end
[16:36] time believers
[16:38] as they watch and pray for jesus's
[16:40] second coming
[16:42] first john chapter 2 verses 22 and 23 is
[16:45] more proof that the fourth horse rider
[16:47] is the antichrist and he is equivalent
[16:50] to the spirit of death because the
[16:52] antichrist spirit denies the father and
[16:54] son the son is the word and the word is
[16:57] truth and life proving this death rider
[16:59] is the antichrist spirit for he denies
[17:02] the truth of the word remember that the
[17:04] spirit of the son is life
[17:07] first john 2 verse 22 and 23 say who is
[17:10] a liar but he that denieth that jesus is
[17:13] the christ he is antichrist that denieth
[17:16] the father and the son
[17:17] whosoever denieth the son the same hath
[17:19] not the father but he that acknowledges
[17:22] the son hath the father also
[17:26] the timing of this fourth beast the
[17:28] flying eagle points to the end time
[17:30] right before the rapture of the new
[17:32] testament church right before god
[17:34] returns to the jews
[17:35] this is seen in the order of the seven
[17:37] seals
[17:38] the first four seals have horse riders
[17:41] while the fifth sixth and seventh do not
[17:43] have horse riders
[17:45] the fifth seal in particular gives us
[17:47] proof of the timing of the events the
[17:49] fifth seal focuses on the jews for they
[17:52] are the souls under the altar that do
[17:54] not have the testimony of jesus
[17:56] but the testimony of the word of god or
[17:59] old testament
[18:00] this means the first four seals deal
[18:02] with the gentiles during the time of the
[18:05] gentiles or seven church ages
[18:08] the pale horse rider or fourth and final
[18:10] horse rider has a ministry of death and
[18:13] destruction and is combated by the
[18:15] fourth beast the eagle anointing since
[18:18] eagles represent prophets like moses and
[18:21] aaron and new testament prophets and
[18:23] believers
[18:24] this shows a prophetic anointing is upon
[18:27] christians in the last age
[18:30] the evidence of this prophetic anointing
[18:32] is the ministry of william branham who
[18:34] spoke with thus saith the lord
[18:35] accurately in my latest book i detail 30
[18:38] thus saith the lord's statements and
[18:40] they're found in the 13th and final
[18:42] chapter on pages 751 through 762.
[18:47] this is the flying eagle age right
[18:49] before god returns to the jews in which
[18:52] holy ghost-filled christians are
[18:54] anointed with the spirit of prophecy
[18:56] today's christians also called jesus's
[18:58] bride in the bible are hot or on fire
[19:01] for jesus
[19:02] as expressed in revelation 3 verse 16
[19:05] due to their hearts being turned back to
[19:07] the apostolic fathers as taught by
[19:10] malachi 4 verses 5 and 6
[19:13] we have thus saith the lord for doctrine
[19:15] and prophecy and we love it overcome by
[19:18] it and live by it
[19:22] in closing i hope this video has been a
[19:24] blessing please contact me with any
[19:26] questions or concerns
[19:27] [Music]
[19:31] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[19:33] the desire of your heart
