TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] but the Bible said and he promised in the last days he would send the spirit of Elijah and would call the people the children of God back to the original Faith like it was in the beginning of the world now remember it's thus sayeth the Lord it'll come to pass in this day I charge you in Christ's name to do this you preachers I charge you to read the newspapers or take consideration anywhere you want to go and see if it isn't on the Earth right now now greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to do a part two on the seven Thunders and by God's grace I'll give reasons 10 through 14 on why I believe the Thunders have already uttered but again I'll humbly say that I'm open to God changing my mind if he wants to reveal them in the future by God's grace hi friends I'm Pastor Jesse Smith I pastored bride of Christ Fellowship here in in akan Ohio for nearly 18 years June will be our 18th anniversary by God's grace and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his genuine Prophet The Late William brandham 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother bram's Godly Christian character so I'll briefly review the nine reasons I put on part one and then I'll get into reasons 10 through 14 reason number one brother brandham said seven times after the seventh s sermon that the Thunders or seals were already fulfilled revealed or history number two brother brandom never mentioned the seventh seal Vision with the threefolds after preaching the seventh seal which makes me think it was already fulfilled and he knew the Thunders had already uttered the revelations of the Seven Seals reason number three when asked directly about the seven thunders in questions and answers part 4 1964 brother brandham said they were already revealed reason number four brother brandham put it in print in his church age book released in December 1965 that the Thunders were the revelations contained in the Seven Seals and of course there's many quotes after the Seven Seals where brother Ram said the seals were revealed and made known and brother brandom would have read over the church age book a couple times as he said his daughter said perhaps five times the fifth reason was if the Thunders aren't revealed then our hearts are not turned to the apostolic fathers but of course I believe my heart and many Believers of the end time message have hearts turned back to the apostolic fathers Paul Peter James John and so forth the six reason is that Revelation 6 ver1 says a thunder sounded at the first seal which I believe was one of those seven Thunders that were later revealed on the earth in Revelation 10: 3 and four so there are not eight Thunders reason number seven there are no thus say the Lord's statements from Brother brandham on a future opening of the Seven Seals and seven Thunders and then I never heard brother Bram mentioned this Vision about the seventh seal anymore for the rest of his life which was nearly 32 months after he saw the vision of the seventh seal and the eighth reason if the Thunders are still Mysteries then the mysteries of Revelation 10:7 are not fulfilled and Revelation 10:7 isn't history but brother Ram said Revelation 101:7 was history it was God's prophecy fulfilled and then the ninth reason was the order of Revelation 10 seems to fit what has happened in reality since 1965 when brother Brandon went off the scene to the present time now let's move on to the new reasons I haven't released yet here reason number 10 if someone else comes to turn our hearts back to the fathers by giving us the revelation of the Thunders then brother brandom's thus sayi the Lord statement that he was the Fulfillment of Malachi 4:5 and6 was wrong last year I felt like the Lord reminded me of this thus sayi the Lord's statement from Brother brandham when a new person a false prophet raised up and said he was going to take brother brandom's mantle and turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers but then the Holy Spirit reminded me of brother brandom's statement in the anointed ones the end time 1965 brother brandom quotes Malachi 4:5 and6 about turning our hearts back to the original Faith he said it's God's promise it's it's thus sayith the Lord and then he said now remember it's thus sayith the Lord it'll come to pass in this day brother random said examine every cult and Clan every man every church every newspaper and he said see if it isn't on the Earth right now so there we have a thus sayi the Lord Malachi 45 and6 was fulfilled in brother R's ministry right there in July of 1965 let's listen to the quote but the Bible said and he promised in the last days he would send the fear of Elijah and would call the people the children of God back to the original Faith like it was in the beginning of the word that word would confirm the son of man in the last days the same as it was of Sodom yesterday today and forever he promised to do it yes it's God's promisees thus sayith the Lord notice they did the same thing just as Moses did until God got enough of it amen now remember it's thus sayeth the Lord it'll come to pass in this day now search over the world take every cult take every Clan take every man take every church I charge you in Christ name to do this you preachers I charge you to read the newspapers or take consideration anywhere you want to go and see if it isn't on the Earth right [Applause] now now that we've heard the quote we also have to consider the next step we have to look at what brother random had written in the church age book and in this statement we get the two things that the seventh Church age messenger was supposed to do and notice there's a chronological order of the effects of the uttering of the seven Thunders so let's read the quote you're very familiar with this one probably now this messenger Malachi 4 in Revelation 107 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers now pause right there remember brother bam said in July of 65 it came to pass in his day with thus sayith the Lord number two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so so I'm going to put on the screen now you can see it here I'll just call it the orderly effect of the seven Thunders based upon that quote so the first step is the revelation of the seven Thunders that's the first thing that has to happen that's according to that statement he will reveal the mystery of the seven Thunders which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals so now look at the second step after the Thunders utter then we have the Second Step then we have the revelation of the Seven Seals then the third step after that is literally our hearts are turned back to the Pentecostal fathers so again before moving on to reason number 11 if someone else comes to turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers according to brother Ram's statement they would have to reveal the seven Thunders be a prophet as brother Ram said in the church age book chapter 9 the latan church age and then those Thunders would give us the revelation of the Seven Seals and then our hearts would finally be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers this is why I believe God used brother Braham to utter what the seven Thunders said which were the revelations of the Seven Seals and then when we received that we literally had our hearts turned back to the apostolic fathers reason number 11 if someone came to reveal the seven Thunders for rapturing faith that would be the last sign to us before the Rapture and yet that would go against the six thus sayi the Lord's statements from Brother Bram that said his ministry was the last sign to the Gentiles before the rapture and friends I wrote about this last sign from Brother brandham on pages 728 through 733 in my 2021 book and I have all six quotes from Brother brandham about his ministry being the last sign before the Rapture in the book so again if someone came in the future to reveal the seven Thunders that would literally give us rapturing faith and then that rapturing Faith would spread from the real Holy Ghost filled churches to all the other ones it would seem that would be the last sign before the Rapture because people would would say oh there's a Revival the seven Thunders have been revealed and then that Revival would lead to a literal body change where their bodies would be swallowed up death would be swallowed up in life and that would be a great sign for the Believers that the Rapture was on moving on to reason number 12 according to the church age book the Thunders must come through a prophet so if brother Bram did not reveal the Thunders then the entire bride worldwide would have to recognize this other new prophet and he must be undeniably the prophet with the thus sayith the Lord Revelation on the seven Thunders that comes out of the Bible it have to come straight out of the Bible and brother R said it must come to a prophet on page 324 the church age book chapter 9 it will take a prophet to get the Revelation because God has no other way of bringing out his scripture Revelations except by a prophet cuz he said it was in the end time period that the seven Thunders of Jesus came forth Revelation 10 3 and 4 so just humbly friends I don't see how this could happen this seems very unlikely that a man will rise up and be a Vindicated Prophet so this man would probably likely already have to have visions that have been fulfilled throughout his life because a person is born with a prophetic gift so they would be seeing visions all their lives and they would have a thus sayith the Lord maybe multiple thus sayith the Lords future prophecies that had already come to pass so everybody would know this person was a prophet and then after that then they would give us thus sayith the Lord with the revelation of the seven Thunders which would be rapturing Faith so to me this seems unlikely it seems more biblical that Revelation 10 1:7 was brother R's Ministry and it was fulfilled from 1963 to 1965 and then today it's God's will to fulfill Revelation 10: 8-1 that it's the Bride of Jesus Christ Christ that is supposed to take the revelation of the Seven Seals to the Gentile Nations and then when that last soul is filled with the Holy Ghost then the Rapture can occur but of course we know there's numerous things happening at that time brother Ram tells us the United States government will have to change laws in order to persecute and kill Christians but Jesus Will rescue the Christians before the Antichrist system can lay down the mark of the beast reason number 13 since the revelation of the Thunders is is the revelation of the Seven Seals then the Seven Seals have not yet been revealed if the Thunders have not uttered so basically if we're looking for the seven Thunders to utter then we don't even know what the Seven Seals were we don't know the revelation of the Seven Seals but again there's many quotes from brother brandham that tell us he believed the Seven Seals were opened and again this is based upon that quote from page 327 in the church age book chapter 9 two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals so it's clear brother Ram showed the Thunders have to utter first and then you have the revelation of the Seven Seals and then the hearts get literally turn back to the apostolic fathers and the 14th and final reason I believe the Thunders have already uttered is that brother Ram never mentioned the seven thunders in the Rapture sermon from December 4th 1965 I searched for lots of words in this sermon but I found that he only mentioned the preview of the Bride vision and not the vision of the seventh seal so again this makes me think that he realized the seventh seal Vision was already fulfilled and then also friends there was five times in this sermon the Rapture sermon that brother brandom said the Seven Seals were either unfolded made known twice he said they were revealed and then once he said they were opened and again if brother Ram said the Seven Seals were unfolded made known revealed or opened then that makes me believe the seven Thunders already uttered their voices because that's what the Thunders were about the revelations the opening of the seals the unfolding of the Seven Seals i' like to go through those five quotes from The Rapture sermon here just briefly in the first quote he said the great mystery of the book was to be unfolded by the seventh Angel's message let's listen to the quote now here also a type of the seventh Church Ages which in Revelations 10:7 that the great mystery of the book was to be unfolded by the seventh Angel's message now in the second quote he said when the seventh angel begins to sound the mystery of God was to be made known right there the seals let's listen to the quote now watch now in the seventh Church age when the seventh angel begins to sound the mysteries of God was to be made know right there the seals that the reformers had been had had time Luther didn't live long enough neither did Wesley the ages didn't live long them reformers they had their message of that day and the people grasp it and denominated it in the third quote he said begins to sound his message that the mysteries of all the things that's been twisted up down through the age would be revealed in that time so we see the mystery of all the things that's been twisted up would be revealed by the seventh messenger let's listen to of the quote now we're living in the seventh Church age and when the Bible said that this seventh Church age when the messenger of the seventh Church age begins to sound his message that the mysteries of all the things that's been twisted up down through the age would be revealed in that time here we see it the son of man coming among his people and doing just exactly confirming his message as he said he would do here we find it in this last St in the next quote he said all these Mysteries would be revealed by a prophet he said it would take direct Prophet from God to reveal it let's listen to the quote now remember the message is promised and when all these Mysteries has been all so bundled up by a bunch of Ecclesiastes it will take a a direct profit from God to reveal it and that's exactly what he promised to do see and then finally brother brandham said brother Bram said and them Seven Seals open those Mysteries and showing those things is what's happened I didn't know it so again past tense Seven Seals opened let's listen to the quote and my message all the time knowing back there under healing and so forth like that was just to catch the people's attention knowing the message would come and here it is in them Seven Seals open those Mysteries and showing those things is what's happened I didn't know it but this man standing right here now was standing right with me when youall heard me preach that sermon sir what time is it that morning exactly where it said it would be there stood Seven Angels standing right there from the heaven and as they went up and that Whirlwind Tak them up there we stand in watching went away science tucked the picture of all the way across the Nations down into Mexico in closing friends I hope this video was a help again by the grace of God this is part two in the series then Lord willing I'll do a third part and in the third part I hope to show all the reasons that the seven Thunders could be revealed in the future but again I lean towards this understanding that the seven Thunders were already uttered they already uttered the revelations of the Seven Seals but I want to be humble I want to be open to further Revelation by the Holy Ghost because of brother rah's vision and then because of all these large amounts of quotes that connect rapturing Faith with the revelation of the seven Thunders friends let's continue to seek the Lord Jesus Christ seek his face hunger and thirst after righteousness and surely we be continually filled with the Holy Ghost in Our Minds when we're born again we're filled one time in the soul we're sealed to the day of our Redemption so we thank God for that we thank God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and surely he'll come to us we'll see Jesus At The Rapture because he comes to all those that love is appearing as 2 Timothy 4:8 says and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing so he will come to us for the Rapture he'll change our bodies because we love his appearing at the Rapture if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
