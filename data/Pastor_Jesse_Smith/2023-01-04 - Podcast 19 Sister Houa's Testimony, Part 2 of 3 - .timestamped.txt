[0:03] [Music]
[0:10] God bless you and welcome to the
[0:12] defending the message podcast I'm your
[0:15] co-host Pastor Jesse Smith and here's
[0:16] our other co-host
[0:18] and I'm Eamon Lee we're grateful again
[0:20] to be having this podcast and we get to
[0:23] enjoy part two of our sister who has
[0:25] testimony we surely enjoyed part one
[0:27] and we're so thankful the Lord put those
[0:29] different testimonies on her heart and I
[0:31] know just like with all the other
[0:33] testimonies that the Lord will direct
[0:35] this testimony to the people that need
[0:38] to hear it so I'm very confident of that
[0:40] and I'm thankful for our sister's
[0:41] courage to share what God has done and
[0:44] thankful for the Holy Spirit to bring
[0:46] all these things to our sisters
[0:47] remembrance so we have a list of about
[0:49] eight or more testimonies and we'll kind
[0:52] of watch the time and see how much time
[0:55] it takes to record all these but we're
[0:56] grateful for all these eight testimonies
[0:58] and maybe we'll think of more as we're
[1:00] going on recording and we'll just hear
[1:02] how the Holy Spirit brings remembrance
[1:05] to our sister of how God gave her these
[1:07] testimonies
[1:08] foreign
[1:14] testimony that me and my wife had and
[1:17] she's gonna go into it but this is a
[1:19] time when we first came to the message
[1:21] and God spoke to her
[1:22] so when I first came into the message I
[1:26] believe it was the first three services
[1:29] when I attended on Sunday in the car
[1:32] when I was on the way to church Sunday
[1:34] morning I had earrings in my ears and I
[1:38] was at a stoplight
[1:40] and I Heard a Voice speak to me and it
[1:43] told me to take out my earrings
[1:46] at first I thought I was going I thought
[1:48] I was crazy to be hearing stuff but it
[1:52] repeated it
[1:53] The Voice spoke again and it told me to
[1:55] take out my earrings
[1:57] and so I did that I took out my earrings
[2:01] and when I came to church for service my
[2:04] pastor ended up preaching about Isaac
[2:06] and Rebecca and he preached about
[2:08] earrings
[2:10] and that he said only slaves were
[2:14] pierced to their ears and it was to
[2:16] identify them as a slave and that's when
[2:20] I knew that that was God telling me take
[2:23] out your earrings so you can hear the
[2:25] word
[2:25] wow sister praise God yeah I now
[2:27] remember that testimony from many years
[2:30] ago I don't remember preaching on
[2:32] earrings but I remember you giving that
[2:33] testimony so praise God and you're
[2:35] exactly right the scripture says a slave
[2:37] in the Old Testament was before an
[2:39] indentured servant and they were still
[2:41] allowed to go free but if they wanted to
[2:43] stay a servant for their lifetime and
[2:46] basically move into that permanent
[2:47] slavery mode permanent servant mode then
[2:50] the Bible said they would take them down
[2:52] and put an all in their ear and brother
[2:55] bran used that as a type to show in the
[2:58] New Testament if you won't take your
[2:59] freedom if you won't take the Liberty
[3:00] the Holy Ghost
[3:02] then your ear gets marked in other words
[3:04] your spiritual ability to hear the word
[3:06] of God is taken away
[3:08] and you become a slave to the
[3:09] denominational system the mother Harlot
[3:11] system
[3:12] and of course the mother Harlot has
[3:14] daughters which we know are the
[3:15] Protestant churches who hold the false
[3:17] doctrine of the mother Harlot the Roman
[3:19] Catholic Church
[3:20] I think there was 15 times the Bible
[3:23] said earrings were mentioned and the
[3:25] majority of them were negative cases in
[3:28] the Bible where the earrings became
[3:30] idols and the earrings were signs of
[3:33] heathens and so the voice you heard was
[3:36] a very scriptural voice no doubt it was
[3:39] the voice of the Holy Spirit praise God
[3:41] one thing that's unique about you
[3:42] Sisterhood is that you hear the voice of
[3:44] God sometimes which is wonderful I
[3:47] myself I've been a Christian 22 years
[3:49] I've never heard God's voice like that I
[3:52] just feel convicted in my heart like the
[3:53] Bible said it entered into Moses heart
[3:55] to do the will of God and that's kind of
[3:57] feel how God speaks to me but I just
[3:59] want to tell you that's a wonderful part
[4:00] of your testimony that when you hear the
[4:02] voice it's a scriptural voice and that's
[4:04] how we know it's the right voice because
[4:06] like in this case It'll point you the
[4:08] scriptures oh yeah I can see cutting the
[4:10] bodies wrong making yourself bleed is
[4:11] wrong we're New Testament Believers
[4:14] We're Not to cause ourselves to bleed
[4:16] the Bible says be be modest of course
[4:18] earrings you know can be expensive and
[4:20] lavish fish and they draw attention to
[4:22] the person and it's more humble to not
[4:24] wear earrings so everything in the New
[4:26] Testament points to no earrings so I
[4:28] just want to say that's a wonderful part
[4:30] about your testimony how you at times
[4:32] get to hear the voice of God and what a
[4:34] privilege that is to you
[4:35] and what an expression of God's love to
[4:37] you as well sister
[4:43] and our testimony close to hearing from
[4:45] the voice of God was with while driving
[4:49] her car and she got into a car accident
[4:52] and still testify on what happened after
[4:55] that
[4:56] so apparently I I forgot what day it was
[4:59] but it was early in the morning and I
[5:02] figured I was going to go grab some
[5:04] coffee
[5:06] before work
[5:07] and
[5:09] it was during the month of December and
[5:11] I was driving and I got into the
[5:15] Christmas spirit and I thought it was
[5:18] okay to listen to Christmas music and so
[5:22] I'm driving and I'm listening to it and
[5:26] I thought I was at a turning lane and I
[5:29] thought it was okay for me to turn
[5:31] because I didn't see cars coming from
[5:32] the opposite end so I turned and right
[5:36] when I turned from the corner of my eyes
[5:38] I saw a car coming right at my vehicle
[5:41] and so it crashed right into the back of
[5:45] my vehicle on the side it was the right
[5:48] back near the trunk
[5:51] and I just got new tires too and the
[5:54] tires were flat and blown up and
[5:56] everything but I was very grateful that
[5:58] I actually survived that car accident
[6:00] because my car was totaled so right
[6:04] before I got into the car accident a
[6:07] voice spoke to me and it told me to turn
[6:09] off the music and like I I don't know
[6:12] what got into me but I was just so into
[6:13] the Christmas music that I ignored at
[6:15] the voice and it came again it spoke
[6:18] again a lot stronger and it's told me to
[6:20] turn off the Christmas music and since I
[6:23] didn't listen to them right then when I
[6:24] turned that's when I got into a car
[6:26] accident and that's when like you know I
[6:30] I can say that like I woke up from what
[6:32] I was doing like oh like maybe I should
[6:35] like I should have listened to the voice
[6:37] so you know I felt really really guilty
[6:40] and bad about not doing it and out of
[6:43] that my car got totaled
[6:46] and I didn't have a vehicle to drive for
[6:49] like the next week or so but out of it
[6:51] all you know I I repented right after I
[6:55] got home and I repented and I cried out
[6:58] to the Lord to forgive me for not
[6:59] listening to his voice in the first
[7:01] place
[7:02] then out of that a blessing came out of
[7:04] it too you know I I received some money
[7:08] for my insurance for the vehicle
[7:11] and I was able to use that money to
[7:14] purchase my next vehicle which I have
[7:16] right now
[7:18] yeah I appreciate you sharing that
[7:19] that's a very personal testimony but you
[7:21] hear God's voice again it testifies of
[7:24] how God he's patient and he uh like he's
[7:27] patient with all of us and he's teaching
[7:28] us to obey his voice and so that's a
[7:31] beautiful testimony of God speaking to
[7:34] you multiple times and you know and now
[7:36] God is teaching you to hear his voice I
[7:39] mean I'm sure all of us can relate to
[7:40] that you know getting in the Christmas
[7:41] spirit you know sometimes we go out in
[7:43] the restaurants and they have these
[7:44] songs on that don't seem that they don't
[7:46] seem too awful like uh
[7:48] like a death metal band or something
[7:50] like that you know they don't seem awful
[7:52] they just seem oh this is kind of nice
[7:53] and it's the holiday season and
[7:55] and so I'm sure we've all experienced
[7:57] that but again it just shows the level
[7:59] of um dedication the Lord wants us to
[8:01] have you know to be faithful in season
[8:03] out of season
[8:09] praise God we'll move to our third
[8:11] testimony uh when our sister who
[8:12] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[8:15] recall that service and so we'll let our
[8:17] sister kind of tell the the background
[8:19] behind that and maybe the week leading
[8:22] up to that I think there was some
[8:23] testimony in that and then we can kind
[8:25] of talk more about the details and what
[8:27] a wonderful testimony that is to the
[8:28] glory of God
[8:29] so after my husband received the Holy
[8:33] Ghost
[8:34] he was expressing so much of God's love
[8:38] to me and he was talking so wondrously
[8:41] about
[8:42] what it feels like to have the Holy
[8:44] Ghost
[8:45] and
[8:46] he he constantly keep asking me so when
[8:49] are you going to receive it when are you
[8:51] going to get it and so I
[8:54] I'm like okay you know let me let me
[8:57] pray about it you know and see
[9:00] and um it got to the point where he said
[9:03] you should receive the Holy Ghost and he
[9:07] said maybe you should clean out your um
[9:09] closet and and things that you know
[9:13] isn't golly
[9:15] because at that time and I'm ashamed to
[9:16] say it now but at that time I was still
[9:19] wearing pants
[9:21] and the only time I wore pants was I
[9:23] wore pants to work
[9:25] because I worked in the medical field so
[9:28] that was the only time and and my
[9:31] husband told me you know
[9:33] you should get rid of all your pants
[9:36] and then concentrate your yourself unto
[9:39] God to receive the Holy Ghost
[9:42] and so I took his offer and I got rid of
[9:45] all my pants
[9:47] and then within that week you know he's
[9:51] like oh and also I listened to brother
[9:54] branham's sermon the eagle that's the
[9:56] Earth its nest I listened to that sermon
[9:59] as well and so throughout that week I I
[10:01] consecrated My Flesh and all I did was I
[10:04] I just focused I just had all my focus
[10:06] on God and you know prayed and seek
[10:11] and then that following Sunday came
[10:14] I just want to add a few things before
[10:16] Sunday happened
[10:19] um that week that happened I was
[10:21] listening to a lot of people talking
[10:23] about the Rapture and how God sold of
[10:26] the Rapture was going to happen and I
[10:28] got all caught up into and I really
[10:30] thought the Rapture was literally going
[10:32] to happen like very soon and then there
[10:34] was this false doctrine that I I thought
[10:37] that was real was What's called the
[10:38] three days of darkness
[10:40] I remember watching that and they said
[10:42] some scary stuff on there and it spooked
[10:45] me out and it was like in the middle of
[10:47] the night and I got so confident I'm
[10:49] like I woke up and I shook my wife up
[10:51] and she was like why'd you wake me up
[10:53] I'm like honey you have to listen to
[10:55] this this is very scary because it's
[10:58] talking about demons coming out and you
[11:00] have to act candles and everything and
[11:02] it's gonna be Darkness over the whole
[11:04] world and
[11:05] I got really nervous and scared and then
[11:08] that's when I that's when uh I was
[11:11] telling her you need to get the Holy
[11:13] Ghost because you can be left behind if
[11:14] you don't make if you don't um get the
[11:17] Holy Ghost or else you know all this is
[11:19] gonna happen and I remember at night
[11:21] time we went and we prayed and we felt
[11:24] the presence of God as I laid my hand
[11:26] upon her back
[11:27] and uh we prayed that night and we
[11:31] thought she would receive it but then
[11:33] she didn't but um that following night I
[11:36] remember cool told me in the following
[11:38] morning that I woke up drenched in sweat
[11:40] and she said she felt uh a huge blanket
[11:44] wrapped around me like a holy presence
[11:47] do you remember that and and that when
[11:50] she felt that I was having a dream that
[11:52] I was talking to Pastor Jessie about
[11:54] this and I that following day I called
[11:57] off work and meanwho went to go see
[11:59] Pastor Jesse to go talk about this and
[12:02] to like
[12:03] we we went and we talked about this to
[12:05] see what what the deal was with this
[12:07] three days of darkness because it
[12:09] spooked me out yeah it did I believe it
[12:12] did spook up cool a bit and that's when
[12:14] she decided to like get rid of all of
[12:16] her pants
[12:17] and dedicure her life to the Lord yes
[12:21] and then from there throughout that week
[12:22] that's when
[12:24] you know I got rid of all my pants and I
[12:26] consecrated My Flesh to bring it under
[12:29] subjection to God's word and that week I
[12:32] I just focused on God you know I turn on
[12:35] a sermon listen to music and I just
[12:38] thought of the Lord and I did go up for
[12:42] prayer for the Holy Ghost
[12:44] and since I didn't receive it then it
[12:48] was after service when I was gathered
[12:51] with three other Saints and we knelt
[12:55] down and prayed for the Holy Ghost
[12:59] and it was then that I received it
[13:02] yeah I remember that moment I remember
[13:04] Lydia come knocking on my door after the
[13:06] service and she's like Daddy can you
[13:07] pray for me for the Holy Ghost I'm like
[13:09] absolutely so he came out here and then
[13:11] I saw you and brother amen praying I
[13:13] just had this thought I thought why
[13:15] don't we kneel down
[13:16] and just bow you know humble ourselves
[13:18] before the Lord and just bow down and
[13:20] pray
[13:21] and I think I was holding your hand I
[13:23] think you were holding your wife's hand
[13:24] and you know Lydia was on the left side
[13:26] of me and just I just remember when we
[13:28] first started praying it was so sincere
[13:30] and I heard sister who I just start he
[13:33] just it just went up every time she'd
[13:35] she'd speak it went a little louder a
[13:37] little louder a little louder like I
[13:40] could tell the Holy Ghost is going to
[13:41] fall here it was a beautiful moment like
[13:44] those are those are special Eternal
[13:45] moments right
[13:46] and uh we're just praying and as you
[13:49] worship as we're all praying your
[13:51] worship just got increasingly louder
[13:53] louder and then you had a long scream
[13:56] and a PR and a praise uh and a shouting
[14:00] hallelujah we're all weeping and crying
[14:03] and you just gave God the glory for a
[14:05] number of minutes there and I just I
[14:06] just knew I said the Holy Ghost fell
[14:08] praise God God moved Upon Our Sister
[14:12] and I was just so blessed I know we've
[14:14] been praying for that I know amen and I
[14:16] had been praying for that you've been
[14:17] praying for that
[14:18] and so it was just so wonderful to see
[14:21] God uh back up his word you know he said
[14:23] repent be baptized and you shall be
[14:25] filled with the Holy Ghost so I was
[14:27] elated I was rejoicing for you and what
[14:30] God had done for you
[14:32] so the day when I received the Holy
[14:34] Ghost
[14:35] I was I was rejoicing and right when I
[14:40] walked out of church and I sat in my car
[14:43] I got attacked like I was told that I
[14:47] didn't have it I didn't have the Holy
[14:49] Ghost and
[14:52] you know as as a newborn holy ghostful
[14:54] person I didn't know what to expect you
[14:56] know from it but it that that voice just
[15:00] kept telling me Oh you didn't you don't
[15:02] have the Holy Ghost
[15:04] oh no no you don't have it
[15:07] and I remember telling this to my
[15:09] husband and I'm like
[15:10] like what like that that can't be God
[15:15] and so my husband prayed for me and then
[15:18] we went home
[15:19] and I was okay and during the night
[15:24] that voice woke me up at four four
[15:27] o'clock in the morning
[15:28] and it just it it just didn't leave me
[15:30] alone it just kept saying you don't have
[15:32] it
[15:33] you don't you don't have it
[15:36] and it was it pushed me to the point
[15:39] where I almost thought that I didn't
[15:41] have it
[15:43] but I'm like no that's that's not true I
[15:45] I do have it
[15:47] I just don't know why I'm hearing this
[15:48] voice telling me that I don't have it
[15:50] and it just kept telling me you don't
[15:51] have it you don't have it
[15:53] you you don't have it you'll never have
[15:55] it you don't have it
[15:57] and so it kept me up
[16:00] for like almost an hour to the point
[16:02] where it exhausted me and so I woke my
[16:04] husband up and I I told him and that's
[16:06] when he prayed for me and that that that
[16:09] evil spirit left me I was able to fall
[16:13] back asleep but then I knew I had to get
[16:15] up because
[16:16] I had to get up for work so
[16:20] laughs
[16:21] so technically I lost like two hours of
[16:24] sleep over fighting
[16:27] yes I I had moments where that that
[16:31] voice would come back and tell me oh you
[16:33] don't have it you don't have the Holy
[16:35] Ghost
[16:36] and sometimes it'll put me in doubt but
[16:39] when I pray and I ask God to to give me
[16:41] some kind of revelation of some sort to
[16:45] to just validate that I do have it you
[16:48] know God has always done so and I just
[16:51] had one recently just a couple of I
[16:54] think it was just a few weeks ago and
[16:55] I'm like I've been praying about it and
[16:57] I'm like Lord give me a revelation of
[17:00] Jesus Christ or or have my husband tell
[17:03] me that I have the Holy Ghost you know
[17:05] just just as validation and I remember
[17:09] praying this Wednesday and right when I
[17:13] came to a Wednesday service it was when
[17:15] my pastor was preaching I forgot what
[17:18] the sermon was called but he he started
[17:21] talking about the revelation of Jesus
[17:23] Christ and so I'm like all right there's
[17:27] my confirmation my validation is right
[17:30] there
[17:31] and so all the doubt left and I feel
[17:34] good now
[17:36] that's a great testimony of overcoming
[17:37] the accuser right Satan's the accuser of
[17:40] the Brethren oh you don't have it you
[17:41] don't have it he's accusing you
[17:44] um reminds me of Jesus after he got the
[17:45] Holy Ghost where'd the spirit take him
[17:47] right out into the Wilderness to be
[17:48] tempted
[17:49] so just your your case fits that
[17:52] perfectly you get the Holy Ghost and
[17:53] right when you get out of the car you
[17:55] start getting tempted and I and I like
[17:57] how you discern the voice because this
[17:58] is not the voice of God because it said
[18:01] you'll never get the Holy Ghost yet God
[18:03] promised you would God said if you
[18:05] repent and get baptized you shall
[18:07] receive the Holy Ghost so how can that
[18:09] voice say you'll never get it that God
[18:11] would never say that right God would say
[18:13] yes child you can you know yes child you
[18:16] have
[18:18] um so again wonderful how God gives you
[18:22] Grace to hear his voice and then discern
[18:24] the wrong voices well that's a beautiful
[18:27] testimony
[18:29] and then the Bible says fear hath
[18:30] torment so that voice coming back
[18:32] tormenting you waking you up at
[18:34] different times that's not the voice of
[18:35] God
[18:36] you know that's that's the spirit of
[18:38] fear the spirit of Doubt uh trying to
[18:41] bring torment to you and I like how
[18:42] brother amen prayed and the devil left
[18:44] that's like a it's a casting out of a
[18:46] spirit you know casting down
[18:47] imaginations that exalted themselves
[18:49] against the word of God
[18:51] so one full testimony there and I'll
[18:53] just say this this one thing I've seen
[18:54] about your marriage you two
[18:57] is that you always support each other
[18:58] you know you always pray for another you
[19:01] know it seems like if if one if one of
[19:03] your struggling the other one comes
[19:04] around and helps you out I mean that is
[19:06] so beautiful that is exactly what a
[19:08] marriage is supposed to be praise God
[19:11] I literally when I'm down my wife picks
[19:13] me up and when my wife needs a pickup I
[19:15] can pick her up by God's grace you know
[19:17] it's such a beautiful thing about your
[19:19] marriage so I just want to encourage you
[19:21] with that as well by God's grace
[19:27] praise God here's a fourth testimony
[19:29] where our sister experienced a
[19:30] supernatural touch from the Holy Spirit
[19:33] during an evening service on a Sunday
[19:35] night
[19:36] and the Holy Spirit brought healing
[19:39] so it was after second service
[19:42] I believe I wasn't feeling good that day
[19:45] and I was really really exhausted and
[19:47] tired and I remember it was at the end
[19:50] of the service and we were standing up
[19:51] and I believe we were we were praying
[19:54] and when I closed my eyes I felt like I
[19:56] was going to just fall over
[19:58] so I sat down and right after service
[20:03] when it ended my eyes were still closed
[20:05] and I was just praying and I was I was
[20:07] in the position of praying and I I was
[20:09] praying that knowing that God was going
[20:12] to just move and just heal me and I just
[20:14] felt like
[20:16] whatever whatever was on me got pulled
[20:21] right off of me
[20:22] like it was just yanked right off
[20:25] and after I opened my eyes
[20:29] I felt so much better
[20:32] like
[20:33] like it was a miracle of me just sitting
[20:35] there just praying and asking for
[20:36] deliverance and I got delivered like
[20:38] right there in my chair oh and like the
[20:42] wind came by the wind came by like I
[20:44] felt like a brush of wind
[20:47] Flow by me and like that's when it got
[20:50] ripped
[20:51] right off of me like whatever it was
[20:54] that was on you it just
[20:55] I'm not too sure how to like say it like
[20:58] like it was just pulled right off of me
[21:01] and I I got he delivered like right
[21:05] there in my chair
[21:06] and then I remember I I told my husband
[21:08] about it
[21:10] yeah I remember that service it was
[21:11] again a really uh anointed service but
[21:13] the cam was preaching for us on a Sunday
[21:15] night and I think we were always kind of
[21:17] tired that night and it was in the it
[21:19] was in the winter time and different
[21:20] ones of us were battling sickness
[21:23] and then from what I remember from that
[21:25] time sister I think you had said like
[21:26] you felt the spirit of God kind of come
[21:28] through the wall at least that's how I
[21:30] remembered it and I've told it that
[21:32] testimony and it's just like Acts
[21:34] chapter two
[21:35] uh they're all one Accord and the Holy
[21:37] Spirit came in like a rushy Mighty Wind
[21:39] praise God and as then the wind of God
[21:41] struck you and like you said that that
[21:44] sickness would just instantly pulled
[21:46] away just instant Deliverance praise God
[21:49] and we've had that wind at least another
[21:51] time in our in our service we've had the
[21:53] wind of the Holy Spirit when
[21:55] um three or four of the children got the
[21:57] Holy Ghost back in I believe it was June
[22:00] of 2020 if I'm not mistaken my niece
[22:03] testified of feeling the wind of the
[22:05] Holy Spirit strike her one of my
[22:08] daughters felt the wind of the Holy
[22:09] Spirit as well so three or four people
[22:11] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:13] so it's just awesome to see that Jesus
[22:15] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[22:16] forever he still speaks his voice he
[22:19] still sends his Holy Spirit and he can
[22:21] instantly deliver at any time and of
[22:24] course it's all dependent upon God's
[22:26] will also like how you felt like you
[22:28] knew you were going to be healed well
[22:29] that's Revelation or that's a gift of
[22:32] faith perhaps God revealed to you
[22:34] somehow you had this faith that I'm
[22:36] going to be healed and God's going to
[22:37] heal me and there was no doubt and God
[22:39] just came and did it what a wonderful
[22:41] testimony God heard your prayer God knew
[22:43] you were weak and tired or whatever the
[22:45] situation was and God brought
[22:47] Deliverance right after you sat and
[22:48] heard the word and praised him you gave
[22:50] God your all you did all you could do
[22:52] and God did the rest by God's grace
[22:55] foreign
[23:02] we had our guest Preacher Brother Cadre
[23:05] Dix come and he was preaching and he was
[23:08] hearing a story about someone at church
[23:10] who wanted to repent but they didn't
[23:13] want to so she said in a prayer wow
[23:16] brother Kaji was preaching that if
[23:19] brother codrick grabs her hand then
[23:22] she'll go up and repent and during that
[23:24] service she left their hand up to pray
[23:26] and brother Cadre went and he slapped
[23:28] her hand like a high five and she ran up
[23:31] repenting that that day and that stirred
[23:34] me up so I went after prayer
[23:37] um after service and I went and I prayed
[23:39] and arrows outside like outside
[23:41] fellowshipping and I was praying to God
[23:44] I'm like God I want the same experience
[23:47] that woman had and I pray that someone
[23:49] would touch me and for some reason I
[23:52] felt someone touched my back and it was
[23:54] my wife and I don't know what happened
[23:56] there but I felt the Holy Spirit come
[23:58] upon me while she touched my back
[24:01] and that she heard I don't know if you
[24:03] heard the voice to God or whatever led
[24:05] her to do that but
[24:07] do that I see about like I don't know
[24:10] how to say it I felt the anointing when
[24:12] she placed her hand up on my back
[24:14] and God answered that prayer
[24:16] yeah it was after uh service and uh
[24:21] my husband was praying at the altar I
[24:23] was praying on my chair and I suddenly
[24:26] stopped and
[24:28] I believe it was the Holy Ghost
[24:31] it made me turn around to look at my
[24:33] husband and it led me to put my hands on
[24:37] him and I didn't know why I didn't even
[24:39] know what my husband was praying for and
[24:42] so I laid I put my hand on my husband's
[24:44] back and I started praying for him and
[24:46] after he got done praying and he he's he
[24:49] told me he's like wow I was just asking
[24:51] that God about that to how someone's
[24:53] hand be put on you know on my back or
[24:56] their hands to just be laid on my back
[24:58] to to know that you know God was with
[25:01] him and
[25:03] I didn't know that
[25:05] I just went with whatever the Holy Ghost
[25:07] led me to do
[25:09] that's a wonderful testimony you know
[25:10] when brother Diggs comes we always have
[25:12] really good good services and I think
[25:14] the last time he was here he basically
[25:15] preached like the next part in my Joshua
[25:17] series and didn't even know I was
[25:18] preaching on Joshua uh so just to
[25:21] discernment of spirit was really good uh
[25:23] time in the Lord
[25:25] yeah that's a great example sister again
[25:27] you know how they that are the sons and
[25:29] daughters of God are led by the spirit
[25:31] of God you know so the Holy Ghost LED
[25:33] you to go pray for brother amen and that
[25:36] doesn't happen every service right you
[25:37] know that's not something that's a
[25:38] normal thing to do you go lay hands on
[25:40] your husband and pray like I can't
[25:41] remember last time I laid my hands on my
[25:42] wife to pray
[25:44] um so God LED you to do that so God
[25:46] would show brother amen that he'd heard
[25:47] his request praise God and then God
[25:49] answered his individual prayer that he
[25:51] had on his heart as well so again
[25:53] awesome to see the spirit of God working
[25:55] between you two and uh you know God
[25:58] answering your prayers kind of reminds
[26:00] me also Gideon how Gideon put a fleece
[26:02] before the Lord Lord I just need this I
[26:03] just need a little touch
[26:05] and God gave that to Gideon reminds me
[26:06] of I went to Pennsylvania one time and
[26:08] it was actually brother Matt Leitner who
[26:11] we saw last weekend and he said I was
[26:13] preaching and then I think I was
[26:15] preaching the message of God be with us
[26:16] where be all the Miracles from Gideon
[26:19] and brother Matt said Lord I know you're
[26:21] going to hear Heal Me of these allergies
[26:23] but can you just give me a sign
[26:25] and so I prayed that for him at the
[26:28] altar he went back to his seat and he
[26:30] said as he was worshiping all his Sinus
[26:32] and Congestion just vanished instantly
[26:34] it's like it it was lifted like it was
[26:36] kind of like an evaporation type of
[26:38] feeling
[26:38] and so he come back up and testified in
[26:41] front of everybody that God gave him the
[26:43] sign that he desired now when he comes
[26:45] next time we've got to ask him if he's
[26:46] done with allergies Yeah by God's grace
[26:48] but God gave him a sign there that was
[26:50] years ago
[26:51] just like you desire to sign brother
[26:53] amen and then God used you to be that
[26:56] other one that person on the other end
[26:58] who is led by the spirit to answer the
[27:01] prayer request
[27:02] foreign
[27:08] we're gonna have a third part and hope
[27:10] you'll be blessed by this podcast that
[27:13] we did today Amen brother I've been so
[27:15] blessed by these testimonies

[27:20] our sister following the leadership of
[27:22] the Holy Ghost standing on the word of
[27:24] God overcoming the wicked one by the
[27:26] word of God and her testimony

[27:29] testimonies and Lord willing we'll have

[27:43] Ghost always points us to the word of
[27:45] God God bless you friends as the Holy
[27:47] Ghost anoints you to defend the Gospel
