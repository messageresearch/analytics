Description:
As a humble Holy Ghost filled Christian, William Branham welcomed correction and received it from the Holy Spirit, his wife, other ministers, prayer line patients, and more. Bro. Branham's "human side" needed correction, as he readily admitted. The "divine side" of Brother Branham, or his prophetic gift using "Thus Saith the Lord," did not need correction, although some divine statements need explanation because the "human side" was so close to the "divine side." This video also addresses and refutes the critical accusation of, "Who are you to correct God's prophet?"

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to show how william branham's human side as he called it was open to correction but the divine side or the prophetic gift in his life that moved him to speak with thus saith the lord was not to be corrected for it was god's infallible word i'll also show how closely the human side and the divine side were sometimes only one breath away let's begin by addressing the criticism of who are you to correct god's prophet friends this criticism is a shallow statement some around brother branham's message make to criticize ministers like myself and others that take different opinions than brother branham on minor doctrines his predictions his hopes and other human ideas he had this shallow criticism usually sounds something like this who are you to correct god's prophet the real question is who are you to make brother branham equal to jesus christ by making every word human opinion prediction hope and human idea brother branham had as unquestionable another real question is who are you to call yourself a minister and not labor in bible doctrine in order to find the truth regarding one of brother branham's minor doctrines opinions predictions hopes or other human thought another related question is who are you to break the bible commands in first thessalonians 5 21 first peter 3 verse 15 acts 17 verse 11 and 2 timothy 2 verse 15 that command us to prove all things be ready always to answer questions about the hope we have within us the command to search the scriptures daily to prove all things preached are so and the command to rightly divide the word of truth in this video you'll see how brother branham was always open to correction and received it from numerous people as he knew and shared publicly that his human side made mistakes more importantly the bible says everyone needs correction outside of god and his son jesus christ i honestly believe the preachers who use this criticism of who are you to correct god's prophet are many times using it as their excuse not to study and rightly divide the word of truth it seems they are just lazy and not willing to study something out or they just want to give some statement in their sermon authority that it may not have remember that understanding doctrine is literally called work or labor in the bible and god gives double honor to those who labor in doctrine according to first timothy 5 17 let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor especially they who labor in the word and doctrine here's the outline for this video first we'll look at bible teaching that all men including prophets need correction second we'll look at brother branham's quote explaining the human side and the divine side third we'll look at examples of how brother branham and his attitude and openness about being corrected and lastly we'll look at how close brother ram's human side was to his divine side bible teaching that all men need correction beginning with hebrews chapter 12 god chastens or corrects all his sons and daughters if he doesn't they are not his children hebrews 12 verse 6 through 8 says for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening god dealt with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons friends the greek word chastise means to learn or instruct or to correct it means to train children to be instructed or taught or learned to cause one to learn so the context is clear god has to cause all his children to obey him to be taught of him to learn of him to be corrected by him or else they are not god's children and notice the scripture said every son so every son and daughter must be corrected by god i want to quickly show some bible examples of how men and even prophets needed correction from others peter was a prophet who prophesied of the day of the lord and he needed corrected by another prophet paul in galatians chapter 2 regarding peter discriminating against gentiles and not eating with them but he was corrected by paul through the holy spirit elijah told god he was the only one left who'd not bowed the knee to baal but then god corrected him and said there were seven thousand who had not bowed their knee to baal moses was a prophet and he was corrected and had his life saved by his wife zipporah when she circumcised their sons and circumcision was certainly a doctrine that god had given to abraham because the word doctrine means instruction and abraham was instructed to have all the males circumcised so this is a clear example of how god will use others to correct prophets on doctrine sometimes indirectly as in the case with zipporah because we know women and wives are not supposed to rebuke their husbands by the word according to first peter chapter three but the woman's godly example is supposed to convict her husband and that's exactly what happened in zipporah and moses's case and that's found in first peter 3 verse 1 her husband may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives and zipporah circumcising their sons and saving moses's life was in exodus chapter 4 verses 25 and 26 and brother random even said that zipporah saved the life of her prophet husband moses god was after saved him moses her sephora got a sharp rock and went and cut the foreskin off of her baby and threw it before moses and said thou art a bloody husband to me is that right and god would have tough moses but perhaps an angel was standing there said zappora catch it quickly see there you are going down to egypt and i'll watch how neglectful a man can go in the end god met him down here in the end and would have slayed him and support went and tucked a sharp rock and circumcised her two children with a sharp rock and filled the foreskin before moses and said you're a bloody husband to me only save moses life john the baptist needed correction when he doubted if jesus was the messiah in matthew chapter 11 and we know jesus corrected him of course in love by telling his disciples to see what was happening in their campaigns all the miraculous signs wonders and miracles proving jesus was the messiah many more examples could be given such as jacob the prophet not knowing that his son joseph was actually alive and then finding out later towards the end of his life and brother brahm told us that god's prophets don't know everything and he just tells them what he wants them to know briefly i want to mention something that people have asked about in first samuel 3 verse 19 the bible said in samuel grew and the lord was with him and did let none of his words fall to the ground some people have tried to make this seem like samuel never said anything wrong in his entire life and of course that's not the case if you look at the entire context of the bible every prophet who had the human sin nature which means all prophets outside of jesus christ all sinned and fell short of the glory of god according to numerous scriptures like in job but also in romans chapter 3. so this scripture that says none of samuel's words fell to the ground has to refer to all his statements that were spoken with thus saith the lord because romans 3 again says all are under sin there's none righteous no not one there's none that seeketh after god all are gone out of the way none that doeth good no not one and all their tongues have used deceit so i believe this means samuel was vindicated by god every time he spoke in the lord's name i believe the same is true about brother branham but we have to understand that only brother brahm's statements that were spoken with thus saith the lord were the statements that have never fallen to the ground brother branham's human opinions thoughts and ideas have fallen to the ground even his human predictions such as the 1977 prediction that america would be destroyed before 1977 with only tree stumps left and brother ramsey's hopes and dreams that billy paul would be a full prophet and then later recognizing billy paul wasn't called to preach and then trying to keep myself from sin at that time as much as i knew how i thought maybe god would let my children come into the blessing the full blessing and maybe my little boy would fully fear a prophet sent from god i pray for that billy has been my chum i've raised him his mother died when he was just 18 months old and they've been father mother both to him but it seems like he doesn't have a call to be a preacher he's bashful backwards and so forth some of my other videos deal with these subjects so please contact me if you'd like links to those videos brother branham's quote explaining the human side and the divine side i've used this quote on numerous videos before but from the sermon he cares do you care listen how brother branham explains there is a divine side to him and it always speaks with us saith the lord but there's also a human side to him and brother brahm said he always asks us to be careful what we're listening to and in context he's saying be careful not to make something thus saith the lord that wasn't thus saith the lord that was only his human opinion or idea did you prophesy that there be a million negroes uh killed on the art did you just announce that there would be this happening now see i've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to there's so much of it that it's just the human side but always if there is something that goes forth it will speak it it's thus saith the law even to visions or anything no i just was talking about martin luther king on this great disaster that they're having in the south with the the colored people and that's reason i see that not that there is any uh any prophecy concerning it i have nothing on it from the lord and be sure now if i say anything from the lord like that to tell you it's always i'm speaking now but when he speaks i say it's not me it's thus saith the lord and i can't say it until he tells me i could be altogether wrong in my thought about martin luther king i don't know i can't say that's just my opinion there's a great need in the body of christ to understand how to carefully listen to god's prophet william branham there's two groups on the fringe that are off the narrow road or the correct path one dangerous fringe listens to brother branham and makes every word on the tape thus saith the lord this is a great heir this is a great sin this is a heresy for it rejects the necessity of needing the bible to validate every teaching belief prediction or statement the other dangerous fringe is listening to brother rams tapes but never quoting from them and never giving brother adam credit for the revelations and teachings god gave to him this group is afraid to acknowledge god's prophet messenger for this day they quote the bible which is wonderful and absolutely necessary but fail to mention god's vindicated servant brother branham remember what paul said in second timothy 1 verse 8 he asked timothy and those that were under timothy's leadership to not be ashamed of paul and so that's how we are today we are not ashamed of paul nor are we ashamed of brother branham god's prophet for this day be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me as prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god so the group who is balanced and right down the middle of the road so to speak is not ashamed to be followers of god's seventh church age messenger brother branham but they're also careful to rightly divide the tapes as brother branham taught us and brother bran plainly said if there's a mistake on the tape or a mix-up on the tape as he called it look in the bible other day i got something mixed up i happen to hear it yes i called it right there and it's on the tape i probably hear from it when i was talking about the seven trumpets it was a great teaching i didn't touch the edge of it but if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the bible you see it's seven months after that remember that brother branham taught us in the church age book that john the baptist and brother branham needed no greater honor than what jesus gave them so we certainly honor john the baptist and brother branham for having the spirit of elijah for being prophets and messengers forerunners of jesus christ but we also must remember john's words when he said he jesus must increase but i the prophet must decrease this doesn't mean we'll ever forget about brother branham or we'll stop quoting brother branham but the emphasis has to be on jesus christ who is the word examples of brother branham being corrected and his openness to being corrected brother branham was a humble holy ghost-filled christian and he was open to being corrected at almost any time you'll see now how he says he was corrected by the holy spirit his wife other brothers a woman in the prayer line and was open to being corrected by anyone in this home church as long as it was done in a godly manner he also wanted deacons who would not be puppets and agree with everything he said brother branham appreciated men with differing opinions listen as brother branham says the holy ghost corrected him on the first seal no i would have absolutely today and i hope that people are spiritual i would have had a horrible mistake on that if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock the day when the holy spirit came in the room and corrected me on something that i was writing down to faith listen here how brother branham said his wife was his correction and married men would know what he's talking about now my wife she's my correction you know brethren what i'm talking about listen as brother branham was corrected by other brothers such as brother sherrod one time i thought it was right to receive a prayer someone give you brother man corrected me on that brother i hate to correct you on anything but you're mistaken there that you call those people but not receiving their faith you call them to lose their reward he said it's more blessed to give listen here how brother branham let a brother correct him in front of other brothers in 1961 questions and answers so it isn't the star isn't messiah he's just reflecting the messiah now the star does not reflect its own light the star reflects the light of the sun is that right huh now if uh if the star reflecting its light then its light would have to come from the from god because it is a glacier of some sort isn't it huh a sun of itself all for the sun yeah here brother branham says he was open to being corrected by any other brother in his home church and how he also would make time for anyone to correct him even a baptist minister and then i expect you brethren at any time that you see me to get away from this scripture to come to me privately and tell me or i'm wrong i don't care if you're one of the trustees or you're the janitor whoever you are your duty bound to me as a brother in christ to tell me when i'm wrong scripturally if it's a question let's sit down and solve it out together a baptist minister a few weeks ago come up and to my house and said i like straightening out on the god head sometime when he got the time called me up brother i said i got time right now because i want to be straight and we lay aside everything else to do it listen here our brother branham considered it a loving act to correct someone which is what hebrews 12 and proverbs 9 verse 8 say this is when the dean of a lutheran college attempted to correct brother branham but the dean was wrong and brother ram said he appreciated being corrected and wanted to be corrected he wanted to be right proverbs 9 verse 8 says reprove not as corner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and he will love thee any holy ghost-filled christian will appreciate being corrected because he has the desire in his soul to be guided into all truth by the holy spirit i said i'll forgive you for that because i believe that you didn't understand and i said i love you because that you're interested enough in our lord jesus to try to correct me thinking i'm wrong i said i appreciate that anybody will try to correct me when i'm wrong i i want to be corrected listen as brother branham was corrected by a woman in a prayer line when he misspoke her last name you believe god can tell me what your name is would it make you believe more would be strong [Applause] listen as brother branham welcomed trustees who were not puppets and would disagree with him by their own some time convictions someone was in a dispute uh on a income tax and they said to me he said why your trustees are nothing but puppets i suppose i said if i had a trustee on the board that had a different idea and wouldn't stand up and i don't care who's speaking about it would express his own views of it i threw him off the board yes sir though it was contrary to my belief i want him to express what he thinks is right that's what i got him there for see what he says about it listen here as brother branham appreciated the people in the congregation listening carefully and then listen how he accepted help and correction from brothers while preaching regarding the seven thousand jews who did not bow their need to baal that question this morning i was trying to answer just as honestly as i know how i just read the first part of the verse and it was a wouldn't have been right but the holy spirit understanding and i my mind see look the last two or three days what's been happening the uh i called 700 7700 this morning was trying and it's picked up for the people in that show that she's watching now the believers can see the word is made flesh in their generation god speaking about it then real true believers m7 000 what's the 700 in days of elijah 7 000 listen to this quote as brother branham admits he made a mistake in the feast of the trumpet sermon he knew he would hear about his mistake and he wasn't upset about it but he gave him this great advice to look in the bible and he was especially concerned that the ministers would look in the bible and find the right application of the teaching on the feast of the trumpets the other day i got something mixed up i have to hear it yes i called it right there and it's on the tape i probably hear from it when i was talking about the seven trumpets it was a great teaching i didn't touch the age of it but if you have to catch that on your tape remember look in the bible you see it's seven months after that some minister might pick that up and then you'd have it you see there all right listen here our brother branham appreciated a man who would disagree with him because he was not a pushover how many pushovers do we have today men that falsely say they believe everything brother branham said when brother branham admits not everything he said was infallible or from the lord brother braham said to believe that that he was infallible was tommy rot and one of the most awful things you could believe and uh a big fine man a scholar was staying after the seven seals he said uh brother branham you're being a typhus typologist rather said how in the world are you going to put that church in the rapture without the tribulation period this man comes from a a great a man a great teacher that's a bosom friend of mine very good man and he's a lovely brother uh i'd be garrison to say one word against the brother i wouldn't anyhow as a as a christian i wouldn't say nothing against him he don't agree with me on that one subject but he's my precious brother we eat together and always just a damn you fella i take his magazine read his articles and he writes some of mine so forth and i've talked many texts out of what i i've already read his article sure he's saying he's a great man but he he just can't agree with me i appreciate that uh his sincerity though you don't just want his pushover just has to grieve everything he's saying he's got his own convictions and he stands for i appreciate that and he's a good man of oh i'm not a teacher a scholar at all but this man's full teacher and scholar but i i can't agree with him because i don't see it but it doesn't pertain to salvation is pertaining to the coming of the lord they're claiming here that some brethren up there that said that i sent them up there and they're preaching that man should leave their wives and hunt for their spiritual mate and that that i am perfectly infallible that there's nothing and over some of the office things you've ever heard and the ministerial association got a hold of it and they're writing me a letter about it and um but i sent them up there and it's causing a lot of confusion and some of them prophesying and saying if one man should leave this wife and go marry that one this church knows that we don't stand for no such tommy rod is that we believe in the bible listen as brother branham hoped men would come after him and make more sense of the message it had been since luther first brought the first reformation i hope that's simple enough that you can understand it these men if they pick up this and goes out with it they can make more sense to it see to bring it to a place you would i just want to lay this seat but i hope they make it come to life and of course we know many men have misused this quote but brother brahms still desired this and knew men would do it who were anointed of the same holy ghost and could rightly divide the word of truth as brother brahm said that was the most important thing for our day is a man anointed the holy ghost who could rightly divide the word of god now to bring up this faith in christ there's ministers that's the most important thing in the day is a good god-sent preacher i admire them and their gift is far beyond anything can be done in anything else as a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of god the most wonderful gift in the world is to be a minister how close the human side was to the divine side i want to start with this quote from the god of this evil age brother branham says thus saith the lord that a woman that cuts her hair is spiritually dead no matter how much she runs speaks in tongues dances or shouts and that is true according to first corinthians chapter 11 because she's disgraced her head her husband and that also disgraces christ and god but notice in the very next breath after he says that's thus saith the lord the word of god brother randall quotes the wrong scripture he quotes first corinthians 14 but actually the scripture about hair is first corinthians 11. let's listen to the quote if she cuts at all i don't care how much she dances sings sit in the choir speaks in tongues runs up and down who has all kind of aids society she's dead that's thus saith the lord the word of god first corinthians 14 so friends here you can see how the human side and divine side were sometimes just one breath away so we've got to be very careful even on quotes that say thus saith the lord we must be very careful how we interpret them and understand them there's numerous other quotes from brother branham that we've got to rightly divide it seemed to say he was speaking with the holy spirit's authority but now that time has passed we can see brother branham was just hoping these dreams or opinions were from the holy spirit and we realize now that they weren't they were just brother adam's human opinions first brother branham said the spirit told him to say joseph was a prophet but later there's a quote where brother graham says that's just my prayer anyhow brother branham also said he hoped joseph would have double times double the gifts that he had everything that he had and of course we know joseph has not done one prayer line like his father nor has he traveled 28 times around the world nor spoken 28 squirrels into existence so we see how this was just brother brahms desire he thought it was the holy spirit but brother brahm never spoke that joseph was a prophet with thus saith the lord when i dedicate him to the lord the morning there's many little babies standing in the head mothers with him along the altar when i picked up joseph in my arms not thinking of what he's saying i said joseph my son thou art a prophet that's my prayer anyhow and i believe it'll be god will take everything that he ever give me and double times devil and put on that boy that will not leave that he'll take my place when i picked him up the spirit caught me and said joseph my son you are a prophet god let my spirit come in a double portion on my son when i come to the end of the road and i can't go no farther i want to hand this bible to joseph and say honey don't you don't shoot compromise on one word stay true to god if it takes everything there is you stay true to god friends christians deal with this often they think something that they feel or desire is from the lord but if there is no silent thus saith the lord then we've got to be humble and admit that perhaps that was just our opinion another example is that in the church age book brother branham said the 1977 prediction was issued with divine inspiration so we can clearly see how brother graham thought this was inspired of the lord but now that time has passed 1977 has come and gone and the millennium has not been ushered in so we see again how we have to be very careful to separate the human side from the divine side because america was not in a state where only tree stumps were left due to total annihilation so i repeat i sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and usher in the millennium and that i predict now this is not the lord saying this the other about the woman in his is the lord but i predicted in 1936 33 that the world would be total annihilation before 77. so i didn't know that if they had something that could annihilate it like they got now but i seen the nation in total annihilation just stumps and trees and things like that another example is brother branham saying that a sister's dream about him dying by gunshot was from the holy spirit let's listen to that let's remember brother brown did not die by gunshot heading into a church service and remember brother branham seemed to agree with this by saying waiting that uh-huh when it's finished some sister just had a dream she sent it to me and said i seen him at church fixed away he's going to kill me secretly sometimes i'm getting out of my car going in and be fired but so then the spirit said not at this time but it'll come later ever god forbid that i compromise on anything a final thought about this is that jesus disciples thought that john would not die according to john 21 verses 22 and 23 this is a good example how jesus's own disciples could misunderstand something he said and the saying went abroad among them that was a misunderstanding that john would live to see the coming of the lord so we thank the lord for that example to again prove to us we have to be very careful what we make divine make sure we separate the human side from the divine side among prophets and really among all christians in closing i hope this video has been a blessing friends and i hope you're able to see how brother braham was always open to correction he knew he had a human side and a divine side friends we have the same if we're born again we have a divine side the baptism of the holy ghost in our souls a portion of god's own eternal life and we have a human side and of course we're not all prophets very few of us actually are but we still get words from the lord rather through dreams visions or other gifts that god gives us so we must be very careful what we make divine as something from the lord we must always be open to correction in humility second peter 3 verse 18 says but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ knowledge means a mature understanding so we must constantly grow in our understanding of the ways of the lord paul also said in philippians 1 verse 9 and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment paul's prayer as a prophet was that christians would abound in love in knowledge which is understanding and in judgment which is discerning because the devil is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour we must constantly grow in love for christ and his word in understanding of the word and also in discerning between the true spirit and the false spirit we know if we're born again christ will help us do that for he said he will guide us into all truth if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
