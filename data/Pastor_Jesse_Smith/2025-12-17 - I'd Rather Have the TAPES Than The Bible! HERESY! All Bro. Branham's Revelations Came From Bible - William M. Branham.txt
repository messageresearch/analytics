TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Now if he is our absolute there can be no other absolute. Greetings friends in the matchless [music] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer the question would you rather have [music] the tapes of William Brham or the Bible? Recently I was thinking about this subject and just noticing how brother Brandham received revelation [music] from God. He did not receive revelation from God from his own tapes. [music] He received revelation from God according to the Bible. So, I'm [music] sure most of you who know me know my stance. If I'd rather have one or the other, I'd rather have the Holy Bible. [music] Thankfully, by God's grace, we don't have to choose between the two. We can have both. But the Bible is the absolute. Brother Brandham said his absolute was the Bible. Brother Brandham said God's absolute [music] is the Bible, and there's only one absolute, and there can be no other. But God's absolute is his word. He gives it and heavens and earth will pass away, but it shall never pass away. I like that. When we got one absolute, and that's the word of the living God, that settles it forever. No matter what anyone else says. Now, if he is our absolute, there can be no other absolute. You can't have say, "WELL, MY MY church is my absolute. My creed is my absolute." If Christ is your absolute, you believe Christ's word. There's no other way to do it. &gt;&gt; So, it is an undeniable fact that the Holy Bible is the absolute, God's absolute. That means it's the absolute of the universe and every true believer. The tapes are not the absolute. So, I'll leave a link in the description to the videos I've made about how the Bible is the absolute. I trust those will be a blessing to you by the grace of God. So, this video also exposes the complete idolatry of those who worship Brother Bram's tapes, such as those at the current Brandom Tabernacle who believe every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord. That's heresy. That's idolatry. And what they've done is they've worshiped the creature instead of the creator as Romans 1 25 and 26 say. They changed the truth of God into a lie and worship and serve the creature more than the creator who is blessed forever. Amen. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections. If people will not repent of worshiping humans, whether prophets or tapes, God will give them up to their own devices. Friends, brother Brandham also said, "If I die in my tracks, my absolute is the word of God." He did not say, "If I die in my tracks and my and I'm at the point of death, my tapes are the absolute." Brother Graham also said, "My words will fail." And yet the Bible itself says, "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but God's words will never fail. They'll never pass away." Brother Ram said, "It's also one of the most awful things to say that every word he says is infallible." Now, over the years, I've heard people say around the message that they've heard preachers hold up a Bible and quote books from Brother Brandham and raise the quote books higher and say they'd rather have the quote books of Brother Brandham than the Bible. Again, that's absolute heresy. That's a disgrace. That's a shame. That is the mark of a heathen. Alls one has to do is think, how did Brother Random get his revelations? Did he get his revelations from listening to his own tapes? No. He got revelation from the Holy Bible as this video will show here by the grace of God. But first, let's listen to a quote from Convinced and then Concerned 1962. Brother Ram said, "People are falling away and not interested in the Bible. They're falling away from the fundamental facts of the Bible." Brother Ram said, "I think all ministers who love the word of God and know that that's the only standard in which we can be assured that we're right. Not upon some theory like press play and obey, but upon the word of God. That's the only basis," Brother Random says. And then he tells a story of a black brother who said, "I'd rather be standing on the Bible than standing in heaven." And he was asked, "How would you think that?" He said, "Because heaven and earth will pass away, but my word won't pass away." Brother Ram said, 'I think he had something there. He said, 'If you're standing in heaven, it might pass away, but the word of God will never pass away. So, that's a good place to stand. And then he quoted Tommy Osborne, who said he wouldn't want to be sacriiggious, but he'd put down his Bible and stand on it to show that I'm standing there on the Bible. Brother Bram said that was rather very cute. And then he says, "People are getting away from their interest in the Bible." And isn't that true? Tape worshippers, alls they think about is tapes. They're disinterested in the Holy Bible. and they won't let anyone tell them different. That's why they isolate themselves, sit at home, don't go to church physically, isolate themselves away from the body of Christ and real men of God who preach the word of God by the anointing of the Holy Ghost. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; We find today that there is such a falling away. It seems to be that people are not interested like they used to be. They are falling away from the the fundamental facts of the Bible. They are seem to be drifting. And I think all ministers who love the word of God and know that that's the only standard in which we can be assured that we're right is not upon a someory but up on the word of God. That's the only basis. &gt;&gt; Right? as I don't want to say this sacriiggious but in the south it was told that a colored brother once packed a Bible under his arm and could not read and uh his boss asked him said why do you pack it he said because I believe it and he said I believe it from kiver to kiver and kiver also for it's got a holy bible and he said I want to say another thing I would rather be standing on that Bible than be standing in heaven And the man said, "How would you think that?" He said, "Because heavens and earth will pass away, but my word won't pass away." I think he had something there. And both heavens and earth would pass away. So you're standing in heaven. It might pass away. In the earth, it will pass away. And but the word will never pass away. So that's a good place to stand. You're in Chicago one night. I heard brother Tommy Osurn, our gallant brother, say if it I believe this word. is that if it wasn't sacriiggious, I'd put it down and stand on it to show that I was standing there. Thought that was rather very cute. Today we find oh that people get away. They get away from the word. Get away from the interest. There seems to be not very much interest in it. &gt;&gt; Now let's look at three stories from brother Bram's life. Just three that I thought of briefly where he got revelation from the Bible and not from his tapes. Uh but first member in desperation September 1st 63 brother Brandham said the seven seals was his regular commission. He said it was directly the word of God. So we'll first see how did brother Random get the revelation of the seven seals. Did he get it from his tapes? The answer is of course no. He got it from the Holy Ghost, the pillar of fire that would visit him every day during that wonderful week of March of 1963. I'll use a quote from the fourth seal and the seventh seal. Brother Random said in the fourth seal that he would sit there and the vision would go to breaking forth. He'd pick up his pen and start writing and maybe stay there for hours till the vision gets finished. And then he'd go back and say, "Well, looks like I've seen that somewhere." Get my concordance. Go looking back. And then he says, "Here it is right there. There it is over here again." Then I just tie it right in. I know that's God. as long as it's comparing scripture with scripture. Notice he did not say I know it's God as long as it's agreeing with all of my tapes. Brother Ram said that's the way it has to do. Just putting a building together. The stones has to fit stone by stone. So taking scripture upon scripture is building a foundation. Building a building [clears throat] and a foundation based upon the word of God that the storms of life will not overthrow. That's why the storms of life will overthrow the faith of tape worshippers because they're not building their faith upon the word of God only. Let's listen to this quote from the fourth seal. &gt;&gt; Just go up there and take the Bible and sit [snorts] down and sit there until when it goes to breaking forth like that. I pick up my pen and start writing and just stay there maybe for hours till it gets uh it gets finished. Then I go back and I find out as I see where he said this. I thought, well, looks like I've seen that somewhere. I get my concordance, go look back. There's something like that. And here it is right here. And then here it is over here again. Here it is back here and down here and over here. Then I just tie it right in. I know that's God. As long as it's comparing scripture with scripture, that's what it has to do. It's like putting a building together. The stones has to fit stone by stone. Then from the seventh seal, brother Ram would say when he was waiting for the revelation of the seals, he'd walk up and down the floor, kneel down, go back and pick up the Bible, not his tapes, sit down and read. And then all of a sudden, when he got quiet, the vision would unfold. He'd grab a pen, quick, write it down. And then he'd say, "I take the rest of the day and trace this out and see if it tied all the way down through the scriptures, then prove all things." So he quotes 1 Thessalonians 5:21. Brother Bram proved all of his revelations from the Holy Ghost, from the pillar of fire, from God, from the Lord Jesus by the Bible, not his own tapes. Brother Bram said, "If it's contrary to the word, leave it alone, not contrary to the tapes." Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Well, what is it, Lord?" I walk up and down the floor a while. I kneel down, pray, go back, pick up the Bible, sit down, read, walk back and forth. Then all of a sudden, when I got quiet, it just unfolded like that. Then I grab a pen right quick. Go to writing it down like that. Whatever I was seeing and doing, watch it like that. I got it wrote down. Then I take the rest of the day and go down and chase this out and see if it tied all the way down through the scriptures. Then it prove all things. &gt;&gt; I got this shirt. I think now there's many people had visions. There's many been revelations. If it's contrary to the word, leave it alone. &gt;&gt; That's right. Leave it alone. Second, brother Ram said this numerous times in numerous ways, but he said, "Whenever the angel of the Lord that was commissioned to him for his ministry would give him an instruction. It was always perfectly in line with the Holy Bible. It always agreed with the Holy Bible." The one time he said this that I liked was speak to this mountain, November 23rd 59. He said, "That's the reason I know it's the angel Lord because he bears record of his word of God's word, the Holy Bible, not brother Ram's tapes. And if the angel told me one thing that wasn't scriptural, I would not believe him. It has to be with the word first. God's word is eternal. Notice he didn't say it has to be with my tapes because my tapes are eternal. He never said that. And then he quotes Galatians 1:6-12. If an angel come and preach something else, Paul said that wasn't right. But if it's the word of God, the angel of God will verify that word every time to be the truth. If it's a true angel from the Lord, if an angel comes and speaks and says just exactly what the word says, not the tapes, then that's the angel from God. Beautiful quote. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; When he stands before me in that light that you see on the picture, and reveals it, it every time is perfect with the scripture through and through. That's the reason I know it's the angel of the Lord because he bears record of his word. And if that angel told me one thing that wasn't scriptural, I wouldn't not believe him. It has to be with the word first. God's word is eternal. Cuz an angel could come and preach something else. Paul said that wasn't right. But if it's the word of God, the angel of God will verify that word every time to be the truth. If it's a true angel from the Lord, if it's something off color, then don't you listen to it. But if an angel comes and speaks and says just exactly what the word says, then that angel's from God. &gt;&gt; Third, and finally, I want to play this quote from Seed of Discrepancy, January 1865. Brother Ram told this story many, many times of how he got the revelation of the anointed ones at the end time. Right after he visited Mishuaka, he used his discernment gift to discern the spirits of these two men who were speaking in tongues and then giving interpretations. One was a genuine Christian, but one was an adulterer. And then brother Ram went into his cave. And how did God show him the revelation of the anointed ones of the end time? By listening to his tapes. No. God sent the natural wind three times to blow his Bible to the same text, Hebrews chapter 6. God wanted brother Ram to read Hebrews 6 so he would understand the anointed ones at the end time. And remember, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. If Jesus was ever going to reveal something to somebody, it would line up with the Holy Bible. That is our absolute. It's God's absolute. It's the eternal absolute. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; So, I I got to talk to one of them and I asked him a few questions and he was a real genuine Christian. There was no doubt about that. That man was a real believer. And the next man, when I talked to him, if I ever met a hypocrite, that was one of them. That man was actually he his wife was a blond-headed woman and he had children by two children by a blackheaded woman. And I thought, well, now what? Here it is. I'm I'm all mixed up. I'm a fundamentalist. It must be the word or it isn't right. And here's that spirit. One rang out according to all I know genuine and the other was no good at all. And spirit fallen on both of them. Now, how can that be? I had me puzzled. Two years later, I've been praying in a cave where I'd go to pray. got dusty in the cave and one afternoon I walked out laid my Bible on a log and the wind blowed open to Hebrews the 6th chapter which said uh that in the last days how it would be if we fell away from the truth and renewed ourselves again unto repentance there was no more sacrifice for sin and how the thorns and thistles which is n to rejection whose end is to be burned but the rain cometh upon the earth often to water it to dress it but the thorns and thistles would be rejected Ed, but the wheat would be gathered. And I I thought, well, it just the wind had to blow that open. Well, I just laid the Bible down again, and I thought, well, now I'll just And here come the wind and blow it open. That happened three times. And I thought, well, now that's strange. And then I was raised up. I thought, Lord, why would you open that Bible for me to read that? I when I get down to that word thorns and thistles, which is nine to rejection, whose end is to be burned. I thought, why would you open that to me there? and is looking out across. Now, these real visions come without pulling into any gear. That's this God. See, &gt;&gt; in closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Remember Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Heaven or earth shall pass away, but the words of Jesus will never pass away. The Holy Bible is our absolute. We're so thankful for that and thankful that Brother Ram pointed us back to the one only absolute. There could be no other, the Holy Bible. We'll keep praying for tape worshippers that they repent of their heresy and their idolatry. And again, we're thankful we have both the Bible and the tapes. The tapes point us back to the Bible. The ministry of the seventh church age messenger, Brother William Brandham, was essential. It was prophesied by numerous prophets. It had to come. Praise God. It came. And the purpose of it was to turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers to preach what Paul preached. Just like brother Brandham preached what Paul preached, not to add one word to the Bible, not to take one word away from the Bible. And for those who idolize the tapes, if you'd rather have the tapes, would you rather have the 1952 book called Early Spiritual Experiences that said the third person of the Trinity burned in Brother Ram's heart, or would you rather have the Bible that never says God is three persons? That's just a simple humble question that ought to humble the tape worshippers and get them to repent on their knees weeping and crying because brother Brandham also said trinitarianism is of the devil. So of three persons is of the devil according to the Bible and according to brother Brandham. So this shows the folly of tape worshippers. They'd rather have the tapes than the Bible. Perhaps they might not say it out loud but that's how they act. And if they exalt the tapes being equal with the Bible, it's the same sin. They're still adding to the word of God. And God will add to them the plagues that he promised he would either in this life or the life to come. We do not add one word to the Bible. We do not take one word away from the Bible. Thank you, Jesus, that we have the Bible. Thank you, Jesus, that we have the absolute, the Holy Bible, the word of God. Brother Ram said we can hang our souls on every word of the Holy Bible. Friends, let's be interested in the Bible. Let's make sure our interest is on the holy word of God. And yes, then we'll still listen to tapes of Brother Brandham, but they'll point us to more Bible study and prayer. If an angel ever visited you or if you ever had a dream from God, it will point you back to the Bible, for the Bible is our absolute. Thank God for an absolute, the Holy Bible. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please [music] contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire [music] of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed.
