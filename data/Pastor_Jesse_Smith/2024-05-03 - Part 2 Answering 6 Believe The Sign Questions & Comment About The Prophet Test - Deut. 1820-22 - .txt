TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] what about the people that believe in the Lord now and don't and not the way you preach they don't have to believe this they don't have to believe the way I preach it see don't have to believe that but those who can accept the word in its fullness not me preaching it because it's a Bible sessle greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to do a part two on answering the six questions from the believe the sign website and YouTube channel I released part one on April 13th 20124 after listening to part one again I felt I would expound on some of their questions a little more by God's grace and also through the comment section I thought I'd add some more Bible verses more Revelation by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor of bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the Bible Revelation that Jesus Christ revealed to his true Prophet The Late William brandham 1909 to 1965 and I also defend brother bram's Godly Christian character so by God's grace I'd like to add a little more to question 1 2 and three the Lord willing here so question one said can you please show us where William brandham is Vindicated as a prophet of God scripturally and so I started that on part one I felt in this part too I would emphasize Revelation 10:7 a little more the Bible said the seventh angel would finish finish the mystery of God and this is not a Heavenly angel with a Heavenly trumpet this is an Earthly Angel because God does not use Heavenly angels to save human beings many times in scripture humans or Godly men were called Angels such as David and Paul I have a video about this so I'll leave a link in the description as well by God's grace how the seventh angel Revelation 10:7 is an Earthly messenger an Earthly Angel it's different from the seventh angel with the th trumpet in Revelation 9 but again recall I wrote a book in 2021 there are 12 Bible defined mysteries in the New Testament there's the book again the 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed there are the godhead Israel's spiritual blindness The Mystery of the New Testament Church composed of both Jew and Gentile the New Testament Church is the bride of Christ godliness restored to man Christ in you the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Seven Stars and the Seven candlesticks The Mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven the mystery of Babylon the great the mystery of iniquity the mystery of God's will the mystery of the Rapture those are the 12 New Testament Mysteries and brother brandham gave us six of them with thus say the Lord so we believe the rest of them of course are faithful Bible teachings because they align perfectly with the other six so brother brandom is Vindicated scripturally in many places of course Revelation 10:7 Amos 37 brother brandom revealed The Mystery of the revelation of the Seven Seals to us and on one video I showed there's over 110 differences between true Bible doctrine that we call the message cuz that's what the message is it's the Bible teachings Bible scriptures God is fulfilling right now versus the denominations and non-denominational churches that transgress the word of God they teach traditions of men rather than the traditions of God rather than the true teachings of God some of those teachings are brother Ram's Revelation on the Book of Revelation how the seven angels in chapters 2 and 3 are actually seven humans because Angels do not preach Doctrine to Believers how Revelation 13 has both the Beast out of the sea paple and Pagan Rome and also the United States of America in Revelation 13 11-18 The Truth on there's two future resurrections the truth on hell is not Eternal there are prophets after Jesus there is a message of the hour there are three works of Grace tongues are not the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost water baptism does not save but we should do it if we have the chance in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ full immersion in water we're saved by grace through faith in Jesus's blood men should have short hair women should have as long as hair as possible long uncut hair makeup is a sin high heels are a Sin tattoos are a Sin we must have separate garments for men and women exposing the thighs nakedness according to Isaiah 47 1-3 and avoid expensive hair and jewelry serpent seed is the original sin there's no women Angels no women preachers allowed marriage and divorce until death there's only one case where a man could divorce his wife and marry another Jesus said that's for the cause of unconfessed fornication tithes and offerings having a home Church predestination and for knowledge gender is stable man has three parts to his being Pope is the Antichrist and so many more wonderful Revelations God revealed to brother brandham all right moving on to question number two question two is why did William brandham change his mind on his doctrines through his ministry I thought I would emphasize a little more on this question about God's timing in brother brandom's life brother random changed some of his teachings and doctrines because he had to wait on God for the revelation of those subjects just like any other preacher 1961 was the right time for brother to get thus sayi the Lord that God is one person 1963 was the right time for brother brandom to get the revelation of the Seven Seals 1965 was the right time for brother brandom to preach the true Revelation on marriage and divorce and it's the same for every believer 1517 was the right time for God to reveal the 95 thesis to Martin Luther same is true for Abraham 75 years old was the right time for God to call Abraham to separate from his family and then 100 years old was the right time for Abraham to receive Isaac God always works at the right time and season we can't question well why did God let Paul or Saul do so much damage to the New Testament Church before saving him and revealing the majority of the New Testament to him so he could write it and put it in print for us today God gave Paul the right Revelation at the right time just like he did for brother brandham God gave brother Bram the right Revelations he needed at just the right time I'd like to say a little bit more about the Trinity again in my 2021 book by God's grace chapter 1 is about the Trinity I show eight problems with the Trinity Dogma the first problem it's it's a Dogma that adds to the Bible Proverbs 35:6 and Revelation 2218 and 19 say we should not add to the Bible this is the most decimating argument to the failure of the Trinity Dogma it adds to the Bible so it cannot be from God second Jesus and his Apostles taught and affirm pure Hebrew monotheism rather than trinitarianism you'll never find Jesus or the Apostles preaching three persons it's not in the Bible third the athian Creed or 6th Century trinitarian confessional contains multiple contradictions to Bible teaching on the godhead I have six just listed in my book and there's no doubt more there's six contradictions in the Creed that contradict the word of God that's what Jesus said in Matthew 15 he said your Traditions transgress the word of God therefore they're in vain so we know the Trinity Dogma is in vain it's not true worship fourth major Bible contradictions and inconsistencies exist among trinitarians trinitarians can't even agree on their false doctrines fifth the early trinitarians did not affirm the Holy Spirit was divine until the Council of Constantinople in 381 ad that's extremely sad and just sinful that the trinitarians didn't recognize the Holy Ghost was divine until 381 ad six trinitarian images and artwork are often deceptive creating false representations of the godhead of course that's Satan deceiving people through their imagination they use false images to deceive these trinitarians that don't know the Bible seventh some trinitarians use two fear tactics to persuade others to believe in the Trinity heresy and hell they say anyone that doesn't believe in three persons is a heretic I've been called a heretic by believe the sign on their podcast shame on them and then some trinitarians say you'll go to hell if you don't believe in three persons exactly the opposite is true you'll go to heaven if you just believe the Bible preaching and Bible teaching that God is one person remember Hebrews 1 ver3 Jesus Christ is the image of God's person there's only one person in the godhead and eighth and finally God sent a prophet named William Bram to warn Christians about the false Trinity Doctrine even stating quote trinitarianism is of the devil I say that thus sayith the Lord end quote and one more statement on question two they asked about water baptism in the formula friends there are fewer doctrines in the message that are as rock solid and true as the water baptism full immersion in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'll show a screenshot here of my Bible with the notes about water baptism of course I have an entire video on this I'll leave a link to that in the description brother random changed his ideas on water baptism because God solely revealed to him the true water baptism found in the scripture Matthew 28:19 says baptized in the name of the father and the son and of the Holy Ghost so it was Jesus giving a revelation there's one name to the father there's one name to the son there's one name to the Holy Ghost and it's the Lord Jesus Christ the name of the father is in John 5:43 Jesus said I come in my father's name the father was called Jehovah and Jesus the name Jesus means Jehovah is salvation so that verse proves Jesus has the name of the father when we say Jesus is actually the name of the father Jehovah is our Salvation second the name of the son Matthew 1:21 Mary was told Jesus would be a son and call his name Jesus so the name of the son is Jesus the name of the father is Jesus the name of the son is Jesus and then Jesus said in John 14:26 the comforter would be sent in his name the Holy Ghost comes in the name of Jesus Christ so anybody with any spiritual understanding any humility any love for the word of God we recognize there's one name to the father Son and Holy Ghost that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and also acts 236 God has made the same Jesus whom you've crucified both Lord and Christ Lord Jesus Christ and also as I'll show you in my Bible there's a great difference between using titles father son holy ghost or titles versus the literal name of Jesus Christ I have five points in there I'll just go through these quickly I'll probably make an entire video on this but all the Miracles and water baptism in in the book of Acts were performed in Jesus's name none of them were performed in father son Holy Ghost titles second it's the Antichrist job to blaspheme the name of Jesus and they do that by changing his name to titles that's Revelation 136 third I have 14 historical references from dictionaries and Bible almanacs that say the early Apostles only use the literal name of Jesus Christ at baptism fourth my brother Simon heard a preacher preach this wonderful Revelation and then Simon expanded on it but he said King Saul was a type of the denominations and David was a type of Christ we can see that plainly but after King Saul got an evil spirit on him he changed the way he addressed David he no longer said the name of David he called David the son of Jesse so it's a beautiful type of how denominations reject the revelation of Jesus Christ they disrespect the name of Jesus Christ and they only use title father son Holy Ghost it's a beautiful teaching like I said I'll probably make a video on this by God's grace and then Fifth and finally one of the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven was the woman hiding leav in three measures of barley in Matthew 13:33 and Luke 1321 and I believe it's plainly obvious that this is a parable of the false Church the Roman Catholic Church hiding the LIE of three persons in the godhead in other words the Roman Catholic Church in the early stages of their Church injected leevan or a lie about God related to the godhead they called him three persons they change the name to titles father son Holy Ghost I'd like to add a little more to the third question so let's read the third question by God's grace can someone who claims to be a prophet of God have prophecies and visions that have failed to come to pass so again the answer is no and I think what believe the sign and other accusers of brother brandom are trying to say is that they think brother brandham has had prophecies that have failed and of course that's not true what's happened is there was some prophecies that brother brandham wasn't sure about if they'd been fulfilled but the accusers of brother brandham have jumped to false conclusions they cannot prove these prophecies did not come to pass nor can I but I'm just giving the best answer that I can see the most logical the most spiritual answer I can see by the grace of God because we don't want to jump to false conclusions and again it's a sin to revive brother brandham it's a sin to slander brother brandham so regarding this question I want to speak a little more about Deuteronomy 18 20-22 of course these are inspired verses but believe the sign and other accusers of brother brandham are misunderstanding these verses it's just like Matthew 28:19 if you just take that one verse face value and you don't look at all the baptisms done in the book of Acts then you'll come to the false conclusion that we must baptize in the titles father son Holy Ghost same thing is true about the profit qualification for Deuteronomy 18 20-22 if you just take those verses face value you'll misapply them you'll Mis understand them and again I also addressed this on the 70-minute brown bear Vision Video so I'll leave a link to the description for that by God's grace you can watch that so there's two reasons believe the sign and other accusers misapply Deuteronomy 18 20-22 and I put this on the podcast the first reason is God stayed with brother brandham after brother brandham failed the brown bear Vision the vision didn't fail brother brandham failed the vision because it was a conditional promise of God after brother Bram failed the vision he still preached the Seven Seals with genuine Revelation from Jesus Christ he did not plagiarize them any honest person knows that God gave him thus sayi the Lord our marriage and divorce anointed ones at the end times and other super important Bible revelations by God's grace and the second point about Deuteronomy 18 20-22 is that it was a a conditional promise of God regarding brother brandham and the brown bear vision and here's where believe the sign and other accusers make their mistake if you apply Deuteronomy 18 20-22 to Isaiah when Isaiah said Hezekiah would die then Isaiah is a false prophet because he spoke something in the name of the Lord and it didn't come to pass so accusers of brother brandom are taking Deuteronomy 18 20-22 out of context they have to look at other scriptures about prophets and prophecies second if you apply de 18 20-22 to Jonah Jonah is a false prophet because he said Nineveh would be destroyed and it wasn't if you read the Book of Jonah Jonah never gives any conditional element to his prophecy that Nineveh was going to be destroyed and it's obvious Jonah was speaking the name of the Lord because the people of Nineveh humbled themselves and immediately repented and sought God so this means the Bible didn't record the conditional element of Jonah's warning but of course it was conditional Also regarding Deuteronomy 18 20-22 I want to make another statement we must be very careful how we interpret brother Brand's Visions just like any other Visions in the Bible if you apply the false understanding of believe the sign and other accusers of brother brandham about Deuteronomy 18: 20-22 their false understanding would make God a false prophet if you read First Kings 19: 15- 17 God told Elijah he'd anoint three people haziel juu and Elisha and any honest person knows he only anointed one of them that was of course Elisha in 2 Kings 2 9-15 so again believe the sign makes God a false prophet if they don't understand Deuteronomy 18 20- 22 has to be interpreted by the rest of the scripture and not just one set of isolated verses and again that's because God said Elijah would anoint three people he only anointed one so again this goes to this amazing Revelation that God can interpret his prophecies any way he wants heel was likely anointed by Elisha it seems in 2 Kings 8: 13-15 and it seems a son of a prophet anointed juu king in 2 Kings 91-113 so when we interpret brother bram's Visions we must keep First Kings 19 in mind we must put ourselves in the shoes of those who might have known Elijah's Prophecy from the Lord in First Kings 19 we have to remember God could interpret the Visions any way he wants for example the vision of the 300,000 in India that could have been just in the brother Ram's 1954 Gatherings where the mayor of Bombay said there was half a million or it could have been fulfilled by other message preachers that went to India after brother Brandon went off the scene and collectively all those meetings would have produced 300,000 it's up to God but no doubt the vision came to pass either way it either came to pass through brother bram's trip there in 1954 or message preachers preaching there after brother Bram went off the scene that would match the Bible First Kings 19: 15-1 17 God can use other people to fulfill his prophecies and of course people like believe the sign or other accusers of brother random will probably mock me and make fun of me for that that's fine but I'm standing upon the word of God that is certainly a possibility I don't know for sure the interpretation but neither do the accusers of brother brandham they don't know for sure and if they say they do they're not telling the truth they're just presuming they're jumping to false conclusions so we have scripture on our side as message believers they don't they're misinterpreting the scriptures now in the final section of this video I just want to address a comment that was left on the part one of this series just this is just a two-part series it's from a person called Jeffrey Porter 4357 he left a very long comment and I appreciate long questions long testimonies or long comments in general but it just takes me a while to get back to them because of a busy schedule so I'll read through little parts of his comment and then reply he starts by saying quote there's a lot left to be desired in this rebuttal to the BTS questions and from someone who is genuinely hoping to see a qualified response it's disappointing end quote so my response is I'm sad to read this jeffre Porter but I said on my video I made a 70 minute long video addressing the brown bear vision and over 10 Bible verses about conditional and unconditional bible promises and prophecies did you watch that Jeffrey Porter but you know what's even more sad There is a ton to be desired concerning believe the signs teaching on the Seven Seals their research is the weakest shoddiest research I've ever seen so is the weak research from believe the sign due to their ignorance about what brother random taught about the Seven Seals or are they purposely trying to deceive those that are questioning the message also remember jeffre Porter 43 57 believe the sign says there's women Angels that's easily disproven because the women with stor Wings in Zechariah 59 were Babylon and Assyria exiling Israel to their lands and then believe the sign falsely said brother Brandon pretended to speak in tongues I have a video that clearly debunks that but will they take down their false videos their false teachings of course not and when is believe the sign or any of brother Ram's accusers going to respond to those truths there's no women Angels brother Ram didn't pretend to speak in tongues there's 38 differences between brother brandham and Lin and Charles Tes Russell on the Seven Seals what about the six thus sayith the Lords that have come to pass what about the 12 New Testament Mysteries brother R gave us six of which had thus sayith the Lord what about the eight thus sayith the Lord Pauline doctrines brother Ram gave us so see friends there's so much more to be desired from Brother Ram's accusers they ignore all the wonderful Bible truths and Revelations Jesus Christ revealed to brother brandom I've been genuinely waiting for replies on all these subjects along with anyone from the side of brother Ram's accusers who read my two books defending brother bram's Bible revelations but all I can do is wait on the accusers to have the courage to respond the next section of the question is quote First the prophet test is very sadly proven in Deuteronomy 18:20 you may have forgotten to include that in your list of five but scripture could not be more clear in establishing how to know if someone is a true prophet if someone proclaims in the name of the Lord that which does not come to pass then God did not say it and pay them no mind not well this prophecy was likely fulfilled at that time or may have come to pass at this time or this was a conditional promise end quote so my first statement is you're right I didn't list Deuteronomy 1820 on my list so I'm sorry about that for some reason I just forgot to list that I believe Deuteronomy 1820 is requirement but if Jeffrey looked at my list it's assumed because I listed on number five you have to have the anointing of the Holy Ghost for Supernatural signs and prophecies so of course I believe a genuine prophet of God has prophecies that came to pass brother brandom had at least six and as I said another message preacher or Pastor in the United States has a list of 10 more prophecies related to healings that he's working on hopefully he'll share those with me when he's done and again Jeffrey Porter as I said on the podcast and also on this video you make Isaiah and Jonah false prophets if you use your misunderstanding of Deuteronomy 18:20 because both spoke in the name of the Lord and they didn't come to pass so this proves a lot of brothers accusers are ignorant of the other Bible verses about prophecies they major on Deuteronomy 18:20 but they forget all the other Bible verses like First Kings 19 15-17 which prove God can interpret his word in any way he wants the accusers of brother brandom make God a false prophet if they literally apply Deuteronomy 18:20 to God's promises for Elijah to anoint three people in First Kings 19:1 15-17 but true believers do not make God a liar the next part of the question is quote which leads into the underwhelming response regarding the number of William bram's prophecies which came true how can we not address that not a single prophecy on tape was recorded or mentioned before the event transpired end quote Jeffrey Porter 4357 friend I have a video with six thus say the Lords recorded before they came to pass and again another Pastor as 10 thus say the Lords regarding healings that came to pass before they manifested so of course I'll leave a link to that in the description to say there's no single prophecy brother Ram spoke beforehand is total ignorance so hopefully this person can watch that video by God's grace the next part of their comment is not even the 1933 prophecies are referred to on tape or in any print material before the 1950s this is extremely problematic particularly when so many tracks are available prior to 1947 that document the early days of his ministry there's a lengthly trail of material available published by William Brenham personally that leads all the way back to the time frame those prophecies allegedly were given that failed to mention any part of them equally concerning our statements on tape describing how the prophecies would be receiving updates by his team where's the scriptural precedence for amending prophecies end quote friend I did not put the 1933 prophecies on my videos about fulfilled prophecies because I did not have proof they were recorded beforehand but that doesn't mean they were not genuine so again dear friend you're jumping to false conclusions you're just assuming that the prophecies were not spoken in 1933 but you don't know that cuz you weren't there for sure and next brother randam was not trying to amend prophecies if you read the quote about brother random saying he needs to revise his prophecies he meant get them ready to publish and also share in his upcoming Church age preaching series and the church age book this quote was from November 1960 just one month before he preached the seven Church ages series brother random said we're going to take some of these old prophecies and dig them out and revise them a little or bring them up to date and put them in papers I'd like to read some things that I'd like for you to to this one first I'd like to read something to you I'd like to read your prophecy that was given I got on uh and Man by the way Mr Mercer and many of them are go take some of these old prophecies and dig them out and revise them a little or bring them up to date uh and put them in papers I'd like to read some things that I'd like for you to um to um this one first I'd um like to read something to you brother random only used the word revised twice in the entire 18 years of sermons that are on tape so this was not a word brother Bram used very much so it's most likely he didn't understand the full meaning of it it seems brother man misused the word revise and probably meant revisit he was going to revisit the old prophecies in order to get them ready to print okay the next part of this question was quote concerning progressive revelation how can that reconcile with William brandom's use of thus say the Lord throughout the entirety of his ministry can we simply wave off each contradiction from one use of the phrase to another by classifying it as growth in the ministry does God contradict his own word while in the process of revealing more truth end quote first of all friend progressive revelation is seen in Paul's life Martin Luther's life Abraham and more look at the Ephesians in Acts 18- 19 they received progressive revelation they had John's baptism and then the next chapter they get the baptism for the holy ghost from St Paul friend brother Ram's use of thus say the Lord throughout his entire Ministry was perfect I've never seen one of his thus sayith the Lord's fail or contradict any other thus sayith the Lord's statement now of course there are contradictions in brother bram's doctrinal statements as he grew in Revelation like on the White Horse Rider the first seal because originally he taught it was the Holy Spirit but his last teaching on it with thus sayith the Lord was it was the Antichrist so in that case the thus sayth the Lord statement is the accurate one and just shows he grew in Revelation from the 50s to 1963 regarding the Seven Seals and of course the first seal in the white horse rider there are no contradictions on the say the Lord statements that were literal prophecies in other words when brother Brandon was speaking that thus sayith the Lord for the first time I'm not referring to when brother Brandon was trying to remember the details of prophecies I'm talking about only the literal moment of the original first prophecy there were no contradictions with those prophecies okay the next part is quote the last concern our voice regarding your response pertains to the scriptural need for a gentile Prophet one thing I noticed when I made efforts to study the Bible without without only message glasses on was that the Book of Malachi quite clearly begins with the heading it was the word of the Lord to Israel imagine my added surprise to learn that Malachi 3 and 4 were not originally written as separate texts divided into two chapters and the shock of realizing that it suddenly made a lot more sense with what Jesus said concerning John the Baptist fulfillment of that scripture adding the word Apostolic to the text to make it fit the message translation is still adding to the word the rest of restation of Hearts referred to Malachi Was the removal of the need for Old Testament Prophet intercessors made possible by the sacrifice on Calvary that allowed for all to have direct communication with God once again just like Adam had in the Garden of Eden you even mentioned it yourself in this video the holy spirit will lead you and guide you to all truth that is the restoration described in Malachi end quote okay so first yes Malachi begins with addressing Israel but there's numerous Old Testament books addressed to Israel yet they contain promises to Gentiles this is a very weak argument to try to take brother brandham out of Malachi 4:5 and6 let's take one example Isaiah 1:1 says the word is for Judah and Jerusalem but if you go to Isaiah 25:8 it speaks of the Gentile Rapture because it says death will be swallowed up in Victory Paul quoted this scripture from Isaiah 258 in 1 Corinthians 15:54 which was for Gentiles that were going to be raptured so Paul says the New Testament Church contains both Jew and Gentile in Ephesians 2: 11- 24 so that example right there from Isaiah totally disproves this comment from Jeffrey Porter 4357 and again this shows how God can interpret his word any way he wants and I want to say no the restoration of the hearts was for the end of the church ages because the Turning of the hearts of the fathers to the children was fulfilled by John the Baptist according Accord to Luke 1:17 that is the scripture that you're ignoring dear friend John turned the hearts of the fathers to the children this means John turned the hearts of the Believers at Jesus first coming to have a burden for the Believers at Jesus second coming that's the only interpretation that makes sense now we say the word to the apostolic fathers to help give understanding to make it more simple or concise and of course I know the word Apostolic is not in Malachi 4:6 but we know John turned the hearts of the fathers to the children which must be the Believers at the first coming of Christ according to Luke 1:17 and then another Elijah had to come to turn the hearts of the Believers at the second coming of Christ back to the hearts of the Believers at the first coming of Christ this is the only logical explanation of Luke 1:17 and remember there's no other verse in the Bible that states the literal phrase turning the hearts of the children to to the Fathers as it's spoken of in Malachi 4:6 so there must be some fulfillment of that second part of Malachi 4:6 turning the hearts of the children to the fathers and so it must be the Elijah to restore all things as Jesus said in Matthew 17:11 it must be Revelation 10:7 finishing the mystery of God the Turning of the hearts of the fathers to the children is putting the burden on the Believers at Jesus first coming to help prepare the Saints at Jesus second coming to be ready for Jesus's return the Rapture and finally the last section of this comment is quote apologies for such a long response I watch this video with genuine interest and hope that valid counterpoints were going to be made but there's a considerable amount of dancing around certain scriptures and topics here it's unclear whether this is intentional or in good faith defense for all you've ever only known what I'll say is this our savior warned us against false prophets who would arise in great signs and wonders and deceive the very elect if it were possible the prophet test of Deuteronomy 18:20 is so important in recognizing whether we are being cleverly duped just like Eve who calls the fall of humans with one word being added williiam Mar and brandham added many words to scripture such as the word ages in church ages does not take an elite Revelation to grasp the Simplicity of this beautiful gospel which clearly instructs us against adding to the word God bless you sir end quote okay well I'd say God bless you sir as well but let me say when I listen to the accusers of brother brandom whether believe the sign or other podcasts and videos I have a genuine interest to see if they will show honest research and honest conclusions but I'm almost always disappointed by especially their weak shoddy research and false conclusions and assumptions false assumptions that they jump to in order it seems like they're trying to revile brother brandham or slander brother brandham and make him to be a false prophet when he's not a false prophet he's a true prophet and jeffre Porter Dear Sir you and the accusers are the ones dancing around all the Bible proofs that brother Brandon was a prophet like I listed above the 12 New Testament Mysteries the six fulfilled thus say the Lord's statements I've written two books about brother Ram's Ministry I have over 200 videos 70 podcasts and it seems all the accusers brother brandham just ignore the Bible proofs that I share so the accusers of brother brandom are the ones dancing around the scriptural proof and prophetic proof that brother brandham was a genuine prophet of God dear friend brother brandham never deceived us he pointed us to Jesus Christ he said Jesus Christ is the absolute of course many around brother Brandon fell into sin and idolatry but that's exactly what happened in Jesus's day of course any day whether it's Luther's day Luther said he hoped 10% of his people were saved but but brother William Maran brandham was a faithful Bible prophet and dear friend I believe humbly I'm saying this you are clearly duped on Deuteronomy 18:20 because you're potentially making Isaiah Jonah and even God himself false prophets because they all either spoke in the name of the Lord or they were the Lord speaking and what they said did not come to pass or in God's case what God told Elijah to do Elijah didn't do all of it he only did onethird of what God told him to do and dear friend no brother brandom wasn't like Eve humbly you and the accusers I believe are more like Eve because you're accepting God as three persons with no Bible for that you're letting women cut their hair with no Bible for that God never asked a Godly woman to cut her hair and Friends it seems like a lot of accusers of brother brandham are either ignorantly or purposely slandering brother brandham who was a forgiven Son of God a child of God by the blood of Jesus Christ and they're denying the true research about the Seven Seals and so many more topics regarding the church ages also I can say as Mercy friend you're very deceived on the word ages go watch my video about our church ages scriptural of course this again shows people's ignorance especially they're ignorant to the King James Bible the King James version uses ages many times Paul says there's ages of the past and there's ages in the future so that means there's always ages and of course this is the age of the Gentiles so we can replace Gentiles with a church because we're part of the church church so Church ages Gentile ages they're synonymous so anyone that says the church ages aren't in the Bible they're just ignorant of the Bible and lastly friend I'd say you are the ones adding to the word of God the accuser brother brandham because they say women can wear makeup they can paint their faces they can cut their hair they can have non-binary relationships they can watch Dracula and other sinful rated R movies they can listen to Bon joy and all kinds of wicked rock and roll songs they can get tatto tattoos and go to tattoo parlors and apparently they say it's not sinful but of course all these things are sinful so dear friend I hope you'll stop adding to the word of God I hope you'll reach out to these accusers of brother brandham that support all these sinful acts and dear friend are you speaking out against those that's my question to you we're not adding to the word as message Believers at least our church isn't I know some do but they'll be judged for that hopefully they'll repent of it so dear friend why don't you speak out against those false doctrines and those false statements from the accusers of brother brandham God bless you too sir in closing friends hope this video was a blessing sorry to be so lengthy but I just wanted to answer that I kind of felt led of the Lord to answer that long question there by God's grace and again friends please never email me at my former email SBC Global please email me
