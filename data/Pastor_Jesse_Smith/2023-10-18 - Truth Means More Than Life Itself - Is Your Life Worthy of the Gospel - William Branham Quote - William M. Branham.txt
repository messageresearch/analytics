TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so they don't come to the spiritual Feast that they're invited to do you believe that God has given America an invitation the last 15 years to a great Revival to a spiritual Feast did they come no sir no sir then to reject to come is that life worthy of the Gospel though they call themselves that when a man come to me not long ago and sit at a table and said brother brandom I want to reach across the table a great man I want to take hold of your hand I love you I was in a church and heard him preaching said I love you I believe you're a God servant I said thank you doctor I love you too he said I want to tell you how much I love you as a brother and said you see My Little Queen sitting here my wife you remember her I said I do said the doctor give her two weeks to live with sarom cancer and you come to the city and you prayed for her and looked up and saw a vision looked back and told me thus sayith the Lord she'll be healed great spot in her back sunk in like that look like a great big uh like the uh part of a woman's breast pulled inwardly in her back right on her spine there's not even a spot of it today said there sets my queen a living today that how could I do anything but love you for praying that prayer of faith how can I keep from bleeding you to be a Sten of Lord when you saw me and told just exactly what would happen he said now I've got something for you brother Brandon he said I belong to the greatest Pentecostal League there is I said said yes sir I know that he said I talked with the brother not long ago and they told me to get in contact with you and tell you that it was a shame that you took that god-given Ministry to a bunch of people off the river and around like that I said that right said yes said God sent that Ministry to hit the nerve spots the big spots the highlights I seen the devil talking right then I thought yeah jump out off this mountain and show you know Office Buildings I thought this lead him out a little far my old mother used to say give the cow enough rope she'll hang her on S I said is that right yes said it's a shame but what you do said what are you today you can hardly buy yourself a meal and said look at Oral Roberts them stepped in and got out there with the 100th of the ministry you got and look what they go I said yeah that's right see and he said my group will take you we'll take you right in as as one of our Brethren they'll all give you the right hand of fellowship and we'll Charter a plane and give you wages of 500 a week or more if you want it and we'll send you to every major city in the country this happened right in Phoenix Arizona right across the table and he said and we'll pay your said then let the world the outside world let the dignitaries the big guys the up and up so you're always talking about the down and out the got the up and outs so let them see the hand of the Lord and I take my wife along and others can prove Pro that those things that you say comes to pass I said yes sir that' be great I see the man in the position of a DL LD a writer of Books see doctor of literature fine writer fine man see he didn't know the scripture did you know that angel that performed them kind of works never did go to Sodom he stayed with the called out group Abraham he just didn't know it I just let him alone sat there a little bit I just wanted to see what the catch was now I said well uh uh what would I have to do said well brother brand just the only thing they said we discussed it a few things little petty things that you teach it you just lay them aside I said for instance what brother all he said you're baptism you know you know you kind of baptized like the one that's something like that and said little things like that I said oh I went ahead and he said the initial evidence when preachers and just a few little things like that I said uhhuh I said you know I'm surprised that one servant of God would ask another servant of God after paying the tribute to me you did and calling me a prophet and knowing that the word of the lord of the revelation of the word comes to the prophet and you turn around Dr pulp it don't speak of your good intelligence and would say and ask one servant of God you asked another servant of God to compromise on the thing that it means more to him in life itself I said no sir brother po by no means what I do it no sir what is it there a grain of eternal life live or die whether you're a great guy or not a great guy I passed by other day no disregards to these two men I looked over there and there was a great picture there at Tulsa Oklahoma old Roberts new a place coming a seminary to educate ministers it's go to call and I know DEA Caren brother Carl Williams and them that are on the Board of Trustees of $50 million with a three million dollar billing a Pentecostal boy that's a great lot that God has done for him I think me with the Seminary I'm against it to begin with and I said the future home of or Roberts great Seminary went on down the road there was a great modern thing and old Roberts in a little ragged tent come to my meetings over in Kansas City can they said the future home of Tommy osbor oh man about three or4 million Doll place going up like that and there Tommy Osborne one of the finest Christian man he's a real man a real godsent man stood right across the street there a little nervous boy little boy and girl in a car run around said brother Bram I there when I seen that Maniac Run out and I seen you point your finger in his face and say in the name of Jesus Christ come out of and I see him fall across your feet after he his prophecy and said tonight I'll knock you PL out in the middle of that that audience of 6,500 people and said I've seen you stand there never rais a voice and said in the name of the Lord because that you have challenged the spirit of God tonight you'll fall over my feet he said I'll show you whose feet I fall over and I said come out of him Satan and just fell backwards and pinned my feet right to the floor he said God is God brother R that's all right so I've had myself nailed in the house for two or three days he don't pull no punches he'll tell about he not ashamed of it said you think I got a gift of healing I said forget it Tommy you're sent to preach the gospel go preach it go with brother Bosworth there I looked there and I seen I started before both of those I thought there's or Roberts with 500 machines that not even a human hand touches the letters $4 million in a mailo last year 4 million one4 of all the money that was taken up in the whole Christian world over one4 of the money in all Christian come into one man what a place I went out there to sitting now oral is my brother my I love him he's a real fell real guy and I love him and he just thinks the world of me and I do of him too we just don't agree on scripture and Tommy osbor not a better I just think the world of he's one of the finest man that I've met Tommy osor and those men I thought when I went into their office and seen what they had I think I'd be ashamed for to come to see mine one little typewriter and us trying to get the letters out what a thing set in the end of a trailer at that time I thought what would that me and I walked out and I thought well future home of or Roberts the future home of Tommy osbor one don't speak to the other one so I went down the road and I thought but what about me and something said look up L yes Lord let me lay my Treasures in Heaven Hallelujah well there's where my heart is I'm not saying that for pity I'm just saying that because it happened and God knows that that's right see where is your Treasures do you want to be some great somebody if you are you're nobody you get to a place that you don't want to be a great somebody you want to be a humble little servant to Christ that's the way out that's all
