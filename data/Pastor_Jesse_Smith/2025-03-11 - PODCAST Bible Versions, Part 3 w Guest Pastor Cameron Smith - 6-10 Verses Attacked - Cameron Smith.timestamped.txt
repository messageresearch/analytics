[0:02] but to me the Bible is the infallible
[0:07] word of
[0:08] Goden and I believe that God has watched
[0:11] over his word that there's not one
[0:14] punctuation out of
[0:17] place greetings friends in the matchless
[0:20] name of the Lord Jesus Christ welcome to
[0:23] part three of the Bible versions podcast
[0:26] my brother cam Smith and I have been
[0:27] working on this podcast series has aimed
[0:30] to raise our faith that God has one
[0:33] perfect infallible translation of the
[0:36] Holy scriptures and that's the King
[0:37] James version Bible by the grace of God
[0:40] just as God promised in Psalm 12: 6 and
[0:44] 7 I'll read those now the words of the
[0:47] Lord are pure words as silver tried in a
[0:49] furnace of Earth purified seven times
[0:52] Thou shalt keep them oh Lord Thou shalt
[0:55] preserve them from this generation
[0:57] forever
[1:00] so truly it is thus sayith the Lord that
[1:02] God is going to preserve his pure words
[1:05] in every generation so there must be a
[1:07] pure translation with pure words and we
[1:10] believe that's the King James version
[1:11] Bible by the grace of the Lord so here
[1:13] in part three we're going to look at
[1:14] five more verses that God has helped
[1:16] brother cam to find throughout his
[1:19] studies over the past few years
[1:21] comparing false translations with the
[1:24] true translation the King James version
[1:26] Bible the first scripture will be
[1:28] revelation 22: vers 18 the second
[1:31] scripture will be acts
[1:33] 238 the third scripture will be
[1:35] Revelation
[1:36] 1:20 the fourth scripture will be
[1:39] Revelation 2 and6 and also Revelation
[1:43] 2:15 and the final scripture will be
[1:45] Genesis
[1:47] 6:2 so notice the attacks of the enemy
[1:49] on the pure word of God here in part
[1:51] three with Revelation 22:18 Satan will
[1:54] be attacking the Holiness of scripture
[1:57] and the severe punishment for those who
[1:59] take away from the word Satan wants to
[2:01] try to lessen that punishment second the
[2:04] attack on acts 238 is really an attack
[2:06] on the three works of grace and the
[2:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost third the
[2:11] attack on Revelation 1:20 is an attack
[2:13] on the seventh angel brother brandom and
[2:16] of course the other six Church age
[2:18] Messengers the fourth scripture
[2:20] Revelation 2:6 and then Revelation 2:17
[2:23] is again attack on the seven Church ages
[2:26] and Jesus's hatred against the
[2:28] Antichrist spirit so the enemy is trying
[2:30] to lessen Jesus's hatred on the
[2:33] Antichrist spirit and then Fifth and
[2:35] finally it's Satan's attack on the
[2:37] serpent seed Satan has tried to convince
[2:40] some people that the Nephilim were the
[2:42] result of angels marrying human women of
[2:45] course that's a lie the real truth is
[2:47] the truth of the serpent seed as God
[2:49] revealed to his Prophet brother William
[2:51] brandham so friends I trust you'll
[2:53] really enjoy this podcast here it's a
[2:54] deep dive into the scriptures by the
[2:57] grace of God and remember part two if
[2:59] you haven't listened to that I encourage
[3:00] you to listen to that where Satan
[3:02] attacked Matthew 4:4 that was an attack
[3:05] on living by every word and loving Jesus
[3:08] by obeying every word of God Satan
[3:10] attacked Revelation 10:7 that's an
[3:12] attack on our seventh Church age
[3:13] messenger so we see another attack on
[3:16] the seven Church age messenger in part
[3:18] two Satan also attacked Genesis 4: 1 and
[3:22] 2 another attack on serpent seed and
[3:25] then Satan attacked the measure of
[3:27] equality with God the baptism of the
[3:29] Holy Ghost in Philippians 2: 5-7
[3:32] Colossians 1:26 and 7 and 1 John 3:9 and
[3:36] lastly from part two s attacked hair
[3:38] length 1 Corinthians 11
[3:41] 1-16 also friends recall that I do
[3:44] believe people can get saved with the
[3:46] false translations because there is a
[3:48] lot of Truth in there regarding
[3:50] salvation but I don't believe those
[3:52] people reading from false translations
[3:54] can ever get to the baptism of the Holy
[3:56] Ghost and the revelation of the message
[3:59] of this hour
[4:00] because Jesus said in John
[4:02] 16:13 the Holy Ghost will guide you into
[4:04] all truth so if people are trusting in a
[4:06] false translation they're not going to
[4:08] have the full truth of God's word so God
[4:10] can't lead them any deeper into the word
[4:12] of God because all these major doctrines
[4:16] foundational Bible truths especially on
[4:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost are all
[4:20] attacked by Satan in these false
[4:22] translations so again friends remember
[4:24] God's word cannot fail Psalms 126 and 7
[4:27] says God has to preserve his pure words
[4:29] in every
[4:30] generation and this podcast has helped
[4:33] show that that Satan has perverted many
[4:35] of the words of God now we're up to 10
[4:39] scriptures that Satan has attacked
[4:41] trying to get the people to believe some
[4:43] false teachings some false doctrines but
[4:45] God's bride will be in the word all the
[4:47] way as brother Ram said in the church
[4:49] age book that's one of the signs she's
[4:51] baptized with the Holy Ghost she's in
[4:53] the word all the way make no mistake
[4:56] about it a person that is truly baptized
[4:58] by the Holy Ghost into the body of
[5:00] Christ receiving the fullness of the
[5:02] spirit will be in the word all the way
[5:06] that is the evidence of being baptized
[5:07] with the Holy Ghost Judas failed
[5:10] multitudes fail right there and when
[5:13] they fail to go on in that word their
[5:15] names are taken off the book of life and
[5:18] also at the end of this podcast I put
[5:19] those four or five quotes from God's
[5:21] Prophet brother brandham that I put in
[5:22] part one brother R said a genuine faith
[5:25] in God will never add or take away from
[5:27] the word of God so think about that
[5:29] friends all these false translations
[5:31] have words taken away brother Bram said
[5:33] if you had genuine Faith you wouldn't do
[5:35] that in the next quote brother Bram said
[5:37] he wanted to teach exactly the way it is
[5:39] in the Bible not one word taken away not
[5:41] one word added so that's what we aim to
[5:43] do and the third quote brother Ram said
[5:45] he preached what Paul preached exactly
[5:48] the way Paul preached it so that means
[5:49] every word he believed every word Paul
[5:52] wrote preach it the same and yet these
[5:54] false translations take many words of
[5:56] Paul away and that last quote from
[5:58] spoken word original seed that's one of
[6:00] my favorites March 1962 brother random
[6:03] said faith can only take its resting
[6:05] place in the word of God and brother
[6:07] brandom said the Bible is the infallible
[6:09] word of God God has watched over his
[6:11] word there's not one punctuation out of
[6:13] place so I believe that as well and I
[6:16] know there's quotes from Brother brandom
[6:18] different quotes on both sides so what
[6:20] do we do we go back to the word of God
[6:21] and that's where Psalm 12:6 and7 is so
[6:24] important also revelation 22 18- 19 we
[6:28] live by every word of God every word is
[6:30] pure God will preserve his words God has
[6:32] and he will continue to preserve his
[6:34] word for every generation so now let's
[6:36] get into part three we're thankful for
[6:38] the Lord Jesus Christ revealing his
[6:39] truth to us also I'm very thankful for
[6:41] my brother Cam doing these studies over
[6:43] the years truly I can see it was the
[6:45] Holy Ghost guiding brother cam to study
[6:47] this topic because we see all these
[6:50] attacks from Satan on the true word of
[6:52] God attacking the seven Church age
[6:54] messenger the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[6:57] serpent seed hair length all the these
[6:59] very important topics by the grace of
[7:01] God so hope you enjoy part three friends
[7:04] please let me know if you have any
[7:05] questions or concerns God bless
[7:12] you God bless you and welcome to the
[7:14] defending the message podcast I'm your
[7:16] host Pastor Jesse Smith in today's
[7:18] podcast we're going to do a part three
[7:20] on the Bible versions debate and we've
[7:23] had the privilege of having my brother
[7:24] in the natural and the spiritual Pastor
[7:26] Cameron Smith with us on the first two
[7:29] podcast and he's again joining us here
[7:32] on the third podcast as well just a
[7:34] reminder the first podcast we looked at
[7:36] a very brief but powerful history on the
[7:39] Bible versions debate and then in the
[7:42] second part we covered five topics Bible
[7:45] topics that modern Bible versions
[7:48] pervert or change and we know if
[7:50] anyone's trying to pervert or change the
[7:51] word of God that would be Satan and they
[7:54] were the first one was living by every
[7:56] word of God from Matthew 4:4 and then
[7:58] the second one is Revelation 10:7 the
[8:01] verse about our Prophet The Late William
[8:03] Marin brandham third was serpent seed
[8:05] out of Genesis CH 41 and two and the
[8:09] fourth was our equality with God by the
[8:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost a measure of
[8:13] the Holy Ghost uh in Philippians chapter
[8:16] 2 and Colossians 1: 26 and 27 and the
[8:21] fifth and final topic was hair lengths
[8:23] from 1 Corinthians 11:
[8:25] 1-16 so we're excited for this uh
[8:28] recording here by God's grace we'll try
[8:29] try to cover as many uh topics as we can
[8:32] in about an hour and an hour and a half
[8:34] and after the edits it might be down to
[8:35] 45 minutes or more we'll kind of see how
[8:37] that goes we're just excited to record
[8:39] again and remember a very powerful
[8:42] statement brother Cam said in the last
[8:44] podcast was that why would message
[8:46] Believers want to use a Bible that
[8:49] actually attacks the messenger in
[8:51] reference to Revelation 10: 7 so that
[8:55] was just I felt a very inspired
[8:57] statement inspired of the Holy Spirit uh
[8:59] if God has sent us a prophet to finish
[9:01] the mystery of God why would we want to
[9:03] use a Bible that attacks his ministry
[9:06] and actually changes revelation 10:7 of
[9:09] course we wouldn't uh we believe what
[9:11] the Bible says in Psalms 12:7 Thou shalt
[9:14] keep them oh Lord speaking of the words
[9:16] of God Thou shalt preserve them from
[9:19] this generation forever and so Cam and I
[9:21] were talking before this podcast
[9:23] recording just if there is no Bible
[9:25] currently that is a perfect infallible
[9:28] perfect inter ation of the word of God
[9:30] then God's promise in Psalm 12:7 has
[9:33] failed but we know it cannot fail the
[9:36] word of God is forever settled in heaven
[9:38] and God will move all Heaven and Earth
[9:40] just to fulfill one of his words of
[9:43] promise and of course every word of God
[9:46] will be fulfilled so with that I'm going
[9:48] to hand it over to brother cam he can
[9:49] just give us an introduction or kind of
[9:51] give us his initial thoughts before we
[9:53] get into these uh topics here by the
[9:55] grace of God it's so wonderful to have
[9:57] our brother back so brother cam we love
[9:58] you God bless you and uh we're excited
[10:01] to have you back all right God bless you
[10:03] brother Jesse uh thanks for having us
[10:05] once again um we appreciate the Lord's
[10:08] uh opportunity to to do this again uh
[10:11] knowing that uh uh this is actually a
[10:14] very very important topic uh to all
[10:16] believers not just message Believers but
[10:19] uh all those who believe in the Bible
[10:21] and uh you know as we've covered in the
[10:23] last uh uh two podcasts we we find that
[10:26] it was actually uh it was actually a
[10:28] move of the the devil to always pervert
[10:30] the word and uh the issue is if you have
[10:33] many different um words that are
[10:36] different that are placed in Bibles you
[10:38] come into different doctrines you come
[10:40] into different understandings and uh
[10:43] what that means is that now there's
[10:45] almost like if you could say a
[10:46] kaleidoscope of different ways that you
[10:48] could come to God instead of one way uh
[10:52] and that's as you opened up that's
[10:54] exactly what we're looking at we're
[10:55] looking at a God who actually gave us an
[10:58] interpretation that's perfect with that
[11:01] King James Bible so that we can all come
[11:03] the common way and uh that's kind of
[11:06] what we're looking at uh in regards to
[11:09] making it to eternal life there has to
[11:11] be a way Jesus Christ said in John 14:6
[11:14] I am the way the truth and life no man
[11:15] come to the father but by me so who is
[11:18] this Christ who is this Jesus uh John
[11:21] 1:1 says that in the beginning was the
[11:23] word the word was with God and the Word
[11:25] was God so Jesus was that word so uh how
[11:29] can we say that Jesus being the word uh
[11:32] that there would be many different
[11:34] understandings of who he is so now that
[11:36] you actually see that Christ is the word
[11:38] how can it be so sporadic how can it be
[11:41] so different with so many different um
[11:43] takes that you can take on it so many
[11:45] different ways to Christ uh when Jesus
[11:48] is single uh he's a person just like you
[11:50] or I uh he has a specific resemblance of
[11:55] who he is and that's what we see in his
[11:57] word so as you opened up with brother in
[12:01] mark 13:31 it says Heaven and Earth
[12:04] shall pass away but my words shall not
[12:06] pass away and uh the word of God has the
[12:11] ability not even as the Heaven and the
[12:14] Earth uh does because the Heaven and
[12:16] Earth can pass away but God's word can
[12:18] never pass away and in opening and
[12:21] understanding this uh in proverbs 30 uh
[12:24] verse 5 it says every word of God is
[12:26] pure uh he is a Shield unto them that
[12:31] put their trust in him add thou not unto
[12:33] his words lest he reprove thee and thou
[12:37] be found a liar so notice God gives
[12:40] These Warnings in his Bible about adding
[12:44] or taking away from the word and with
[12:46] great reason because uh that is what we
[12:49] have watched over thousands of years of
[12:51] human existence is as God re has
[12:54] revealed himself in written language by
[12:57] his word uh there have been those who
[12:59] have altered that or changed that uh
[13:02] from a human perspective from the
[13:04] leading of the devil uh to try to
[13:06] pervert who God is and uh God doesn't
[13:08] like that so of course uh there's
[13:10] repercussions for that now in
[13:12] Deuteronomy 4:2 it says ye shall not add
[13:15] unto the word which I command you uh
[13:17] neither shall you diminish ought from it
[13:20] that you may keep the Commandments of
[13:22] the Lord your God which I command you uh
[13:26] so the area brother if it's possible
[13:29] what we'd like to do is uh begin to go
[13:31] uh and show a few of these little
[13:33] changes and let's see if they actually
[13:35] make a difference in how we believe or U
[13:39] maybe it would make it stronger towards
[13:41] a judgment or it would make it something
[13:43] that we would be a little bit more
[13:45] fearful of as we approach our uh our
[13:48] entrusting our Salvation to Jesus Christ
[13:51] so uh with that uh I hit the ampi a lot
[13:55] the ampi Bible was actually written by a
[13:56] presbyterian minister's wife um and she
[14:00] interpreted the Old Testament and uh of
[14:03] course the way that they have tried to
[14:06] portray the Amplified Bible as they have
[14:09] actually tried to say that um it
[14:11] actually uh they actually try to make
[14:13] sense of the Greek
[14:14] words and with a better understanding of
[14:17] the Greek words okay now uh you can
[14:20] better serve Jesus Christ because you
[14:22] know more uh the Amplified Bible has
[14:24] actually become very important uh uh to
[14:27] many preachers in the message circles uh
[14:30] but uh in a careful observance I think
[14:33] that we can see that there's actually
[14:35] some issues there let's start with an
[14:37] example here uh let's go into the King
[14:39] James Bible to Revelations 22:18 and 19
[14:44] and I I want to hit this area because
[14:46] this is of course very important about
[14:47] what we do with the word of God uh it
[14:49] was actually the serpent that took one
[14:51] word out and it caused all the pain and
[14:54] suffering our our hair falling out our
[14:56] gray hair our uh our our inability to to
[14:59] speak all uh our inability to live right
[15:02] uh and all that actually came from
[15:03] twisting one word of God uh so in
[15:06] Revelations 22 the very end of the Bible
[15:09] um it says in the 18th verse for I
[15:12] testify unto every man that heareth the
[15:14] words of the prophecy of this book If
[15:16] any man shall add unto these things God
[15:19] shall add unto him the plagues that are
[15:20] written in this book and if any man
[15:23] shall take away from the words of the
[15:25] book of this prophecy God shall take
[15:27] away his part out of the book of life
[15:31] and out of the holy city and from the
[15:33] things which are written in this book so
[15:37] if we were going to move to the
[15:38] Amplified Bible uh let's take a look and
[15:42] see what that would say in Revelations
[15:44] 20218 it says uh I testify and warn
[15:48] everyone who hears the words of the
[15:50] prophecy of this book uh and of course
[15:52] it it does a lot with brackets trying to
[15:53] explain words it says it's predictions
[15:56] consolations and admonitions uh if he
[15:59] adds anything to them God will add to
[16:02] him the plagues or afflictions
[16:04] calamities which are written in this
[16:05] book now listen this this gets very
[16:07] interesting it says and if any one takes
[16:10] away from or distorts the words of the
[16:12] book of this prophecy God will take away
[16:15] from that one his share from the Tree of
[16:21] Life and from the holy city New
[16:23] Jerusalem which are written in this book
[16:28] uh so here it is the the warning about
[16:31] adding and taking away in the King James
[16:34] Bible it tells us that if if any man
[16:36] would take away from the words of this
[16:38] prophecy God is going to take away his
[16:41] part out of the book of life he'll be
[16:43] blotted out of The Book of Life uh which
[16:46] means what there's nothing left but
[16:48] damnation uh but the Amplified actually
[16:52] changes that and it says if anyone takes
[16:55] away or distorts from the words of this
[16:57] book of this prophecy that he will only
[16:59] lose his share from the tree of life
[17:04] it's a huge difference so now where one
[17:08] would actually uh say wow I'm going to
[17:10] get cast into the Lake of Fire if I uh
[17:13] if I take away and distort the word from
[17:15] this book now the aite actually changes
[17:18] it and says you're only going to lose
[17:19] your share his share from the Tree of
[17:21] Life not the Book of Life the Tree of
[17:23] Life um now why is that important
[17:26] because remember uh working with serpent
[17:28] seed and the in the original creation um
[17:32] there was a tree of life there but
[17:34] nominal Christianity believes that that
[17:36] tree of life was an actual tree there's
[17:39] been much debate over it whether it be
[17:41] apple
[17:42] apricot pear but they believe that uh
[17:46] Eve ate a natural
[17:48] fruit and therefore um that caused all
[17:52] the fall which for some reason and
[17:54] somehow that showed them that they were
[17:56] naked uh so here it it is it is
[17:59] completely lessen so I'm just going to
[18:01] lose a couple bites out of a fruit
[18:04] that's all I'm going to lose out of
[18:07] this so a very good difference as we
[18:10] begin this brother wow brother that's an
[18:13] amazing verse you know again I just I
[18:15] can I Can See Clearly how the Holy Ghost
[18:17] has anointed you to spend time you know
[18:19] and even has directed you brother cam to
[18:21] go to these certain topics this is an
[18:24] amazing perversion of the word of God
[18:27] because it allows these people who take
[18:29] away from the Bible the true Bible
[18:30] version it allows them to have eternal
[18:32] life just lose a little bit of reward or
[18:34] use or lose a little bit of partaking of
[18:37] some uh spiritual benefits in the future
[18:40] home but in reality God takes away
[18:42] eternal life they do not get eternal
[18:45] life because we know verses like uh
[18:47] Revelation
[18:48] 13:8 say that having your name in the
[18:51] book of life means you have eternal life
[18:53] and if your name's not in there then you
[18:56] don't have eternal life you'll worship
[18:57] the Beast system so Revelation 138 says
[19:00] all that dwell upon the Earth shall
[19:02] worship Him whose names are not written
[19:03] in the Book of Life of the lamb slain
[19:07] from the foundation of the world so this
[19:09] is such a perversion of God's word in
[19:12] the Amplified Bible and just returns us
[19:15] as brother Cam said so wonderfully
[19:17] returns us to the fear of the Lord we
[19:19] should fear God so much of course with
[19:21] love but also with reverence uh we must
[19:24] keep the fear of the Lord and not add
[19:26] one word to God's word nor take it away
[19:29] that's what the bride of Christ will do
[19:30] we know Jesus had that anointing of the
[19:32] fear of the Lord in the book of Isaiah
[19:34] says that he had all those anointings
[19:36] that's what we need we want to reverence
[19:39] every word of God respect every word of
[19:41] God so great one to start with brother
[19:43] cam that's the sixth one it's a much
[19:45] lesser punishment for taking away the
[19:49] words of God but we know there is an
[19:52] eternal damnation for taking away words
[19:55] of God it's taking your name out of The
[19:57] Book of Life
[20:04] so as we continue uh you're going to
[20:07] find that uh sometimes it's just one
[20:09] word and it's amazing because it's
[20:11] literally right back uh to the Book of
[20:15] Genesis and how this all started out and
[20:18] uh the individuals who are interpreting
[20:20] these Bibles uh of course by copyright
[20:22] they have to change it a little bit they
[20:24] have to make it different um but
[20:27] sometimes the way they change it it it's
[20:29] actually making a tremendous distinction
[20:33] between truth and false uh let me do
[20:36] this so uh of course one of the greatest
[20:38] and most important things to our faith
[20:41] uh of course is the revelation of water
[20:44] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ it
[20:47] is of course by the scripture uh it is
[20:50] the pathway uh to receive the Holy
[20:54] Spirit um but once again I want to head
[20:56] a little Direction with that that
[20:58] Amplified Bible and I'm I'm going to
[21:00] work just with acts 238 here so here it
[21:04] is you know the Holy Spirit falls on
[21:06] them um and and everyone's like okay
[21:08] they're drunk and Peter said it's only
[21:10] the third hour of the day we're not
[21:11] drunk this is that which was spoken of
[21:13] by Prophet Joel right and uh you know he
[21:16] of course brings them to the place where
[21:19] okay uh they say to Peter they said men
[21:21] and Brethren what shall we do and Peter
[21:24] says in Acts 238 he says then Peter said
[21:27] unto them repent
[21:29] and be baptized every one of you in the
[21:32] name of Jesus Christ now here it is one
[21:35] word for the remission of sins and ye
[21:41] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[21:46] all right amen so now I'm going to take
[21:48] you back to the Amplified because this
[21:49] is what a lot of message Believers are
[21:50] believing this is what they're reading
[21:52] now to to give them a better
[21:54] understanding of the Bible uh it says in
[21:57] the Amplified it says Peter said to them
[22:00] reent brackets change your old way of
[22:03] thinking turn from your sinful ways
[22:05] accept and follow Jesus as the Messiah
[22:08] and be baptized every one of you in the
[22:12] name of Jesus Christ but watch this it
[22:14] says
[22:16] because of the Forgiveness of your
[22:19] sins and you you will receive the gift
[22:24] of the Holy
[22:26] Spirit now so so Jesus said he said
[22:31] whosoever believeth and is baptized
[22:35] shall be saved but now watch what the
[22:38] Amplified does so in the King James
[22:40] version it says be baptized in the name
[22:42] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[22:43] your sins it joins that you need to do
[22:47] both of these for the remittance of your
[22:50] sins but in Acts 238 and the Amplified
[22:54] thank God it kept in be baptized in the
[22:56] name of Jesus Christ but it says uh that
[22:59] you want to be baptized in the name of
[23:01] Jesus Christ because of the Forgiveness
[23:04] of your
[23:05] sins so where Jesus joined them together
[23:09] the Amplified now separates them and
[23:12] says well the only reason you're
[23:14] actually getting baptized is because of
[23:17] that
[23:18] forgiveness so uh what we see is there's
[23:21] actually a
[23:22] distinction where Jesus said uh he that
[23:25] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[23:28] but now we find in the Amplified that it
[23:31] actually says uh repent it's all done
[23:34] right there and then be baptized because
[23:37] of your
[23:38] forgiveness so it doesn't say that your
[23:40] forgiveness is linked to both it says
[23:43] that your forgiveness is only linked to
[23:46] that initial repentance where Jesus
[23:48] actually United them together yeah very
[23:51] good point you take that also with Mark
[23:53] 16:16 about where Jesus said you must be
[23:56] baptized he that believeth and is
[23:58] baptized AP ized shall be saved and this
[24:00] helps support the truth where a lot of
[24:02] people say well I don't need to be
[24:03] baptized and right the thief on the
[24:05] cross wasn't baptized well that's a
[24:07] totally different circumstance he didn't
[24:10] have the chance to be baptized but every
[24:12] other person in the book of Acts that
[24:15] was not on a cross had a chance to be
[24:18] baptized at least recorded in the
[24:20] scripture so yes this uh this is an
[24:23] awful change the Amplified is an awful
[24:25] change to acts 238 and remember even in
[24:27] Acts chapter 10 pet commanded Cornus and
[24:30] his house to be baptized it wasn't a
[24:32] suggestion you might want to do that uh
[24:35] it was a commandment you must be because
[24:37] you have the Holy Ghost again as the
[24:39] Bible says Jesus fulfilled all
[24:41] righteousness so even the Lord Jesus was
[24:44] baptized as an example to the Believers
[24:47] he didn't have to repent but of course
[24:48] he did it as an example and he also did
[24:51] it because the lamb had to be washed
[24:53] before being presented we know that's a
[24:55] type of the Old Testament The Book of
[24:57] Leviticus the the burnt offering had to
[25:00] be washed uh before it was presented so
[25:02] Jesus of course had to be baptized
[25:04] numerous reasons the Lord Jesus was
[25:06] baptized so we have to understand that
[25:09] all these scriptures tied together and
[25:12] uh it also requires the individual to
[25:14] make that decision right uh they're not
[25:17] getting baptized because they're
[25:19] forgiven they're getting baptized for
[25:21] forgiveness so great uh very good uh
[25:24] point there brother I never noticed that
[25:26] so anything else you want to share about
[25:27] that
[25:29] no I I think you added exactly what was
[25:31] needed to be said There Brother um but
[25:34] it it shows how it just one word one
[25:38] word and and it it changes the entire
[25:40] meaning of what's going on and uh I
[25:43] guess if I could add this as it's coming
[25:44] to my mind is that we have to remember
[25:47] that nominal Christianity uh not not
[25:49] Pentecostals but nominal Christianity
[25:51] Evangelical and so forth uh they believe
[25:54] as soon as you repent you get the Holy
[25:56] Ghost that's right good yes so they
[26:01] believe that it is not enjoined together
[26:05] they don't understand so when brother
[26:06] brandham told us about the baptism he
[26:09] said that when they get baptized in the
[26:10] name of the father son Holy Ghost
[26:12] they're actually getting baptized into
[26:13] the Catholic
[26:15] church so uh we understand that God
[26:19] actually he'll save us because we have
[26:23] the answer of a good conscience towards
[26:25] God and get baptized showing that we're
[26:27] bu bued with Christ and we have risen up
[26:33] uh in the likeness of Christ beautiful
[26:35] brother great points there again
[26:38] connecting this topic to the three works
[26:40] of Grace that was a very beautiful point
[26:42] there brother uh yeah denominations say
[26:44] you just got to get baptized and you get
[26:46] the baptism of Holy Ghost but what they
[26:48] do is they're wrong they all deny the
[26:50] three works of Grace justification
[26:52] sanctification and the baptism of the
[26:54] Holy Ghost so yeah as you're talking as
[26:56] you're talking this reminds reminds me
[26:59] of the importance of free moral agency
[27:02] and how there's two perspectives on it
[27:03] there's God's perspective right and then
[27:05] there's our human perspective brother
[27:07] Ram talked about this James says you got
[27:09] to have faith that acts right James says
[27:12] uh faith without works is dead right
[27:14] we're saved by faith and our works and
[27:17] brother M tells us and I think it's F
[27:18] works as Faith expressed that this is
[27:21] from uh man's perspective James is
[27:23] talking about what man sees our free
[27:25] moral agency our faith in action so we
[27:28] we repent but then we get baptized in
[27:30] water and then because of obedience to
[27:33] the further commands of God we get the
[27:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's
[27:36] backed up by acts acts
[27:39] 5:32 God only gives the Holy Ghost to
[27:42] them that obey him so that's why these
[27:43] denominational people they never get the
[27:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost because they
[27:46] don't get Sanctified uh they don't stop
[27:49] watching uh porn or they don't stop
[27:51] watching dirty movies or they uh they
[27:54] continue living in sin they don't get
[27:55] Sanctified so God's not going to fill
[27:57] with the Holy Ghost
[27:58] uh but of course brother M says the book
[28:00] of Romans is God's perspective you know
[28:03] uh we're saved by grace well of course
[28:04] that's Ephesians chapter 2 but the book
[28:06] of Romans also talks about how Abraham
[28:08] wasn't saved by works right James says
[28:10] he is saved by works and brother said
[28:13] they don't fight against each other they
[28:14] both go together because you have God's
[28:16] perspective and you have man's
[28:18] perspective right so so that brings us
[28:22] and that's why we're hitting the
[28:23] Amplified version because um if an
[28:26] individual is putting faith fath in a
[28:29] specific Bible then of course what will
[28:32] they do there's actually subtly being
[28:34] seeds implanted in them by what they're
[28:37] reading so they're actually setting
[28:40] themselves up for an opinion of man that
[28:45] has now been treated as if it's the word
[28:48] of God and what we're finding is that
[28:51] that's actually a doctrine that they're
[28:53] trying to implant in the people so I
[28:56] I'll do one more about the Amplified and
[28:59] just show that and then we'll we'll kind
[29:01] of get into more of the other versions
[29:03] as
[29:09] well so the next one I would like to go
[29:11] to is Revelations 1 120 and here's
[29:15] another example of the amplifi before we
[29:17] get moving into some other things um it
[29:19] says in that 20th verse it says the
[29:21] mystery of the Seven Stars which thou
[29:23] sawest in my right hand and the Seven
[29:24] golden candlesticks uh the Seven Stars
[29:27] are the angels of the seven churches and
[29:29] the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest
[29:32] are the seven churches this is to show
[29:35] you that they're putting their
[29:37] preconceived Doctrine in it now the
[29:40] Amplified of course from a a
[29:42] presbyterian perspective uh them
[29:44] interpreting or at least one who claims
[29:46] to be one of them uh in the 20th verse
[29:48] he says as for the mystery of the Seven
[29:50] Stars which you saw in my right hand and
[29:52] the Seven golden
[29:55] lampstands it says the Seven Stars Are
[29:58] are the
[29:59] Angels and it has in
[30:02] parentheses Divine
[30:05] messengers of the of the seven churches
[30:08] and seven lampstands are the seven
[30:10] churches so this example here uh here
[30:14] they are we know what we have been
[30:16] taught by uh the scripture and by the
[30:20] prophet um and Angel is a man it can be
[30:24] a man it can be both uh uh from uh an
[30:27] angel in heaven uh it could be Jesus
[30:30] Christ as an angel uh but yet we have
[30:33] seen in the Book of Revelations how an
[30:35] angel could be a
[30:36] prophet so here uh in Revelations
[30:41] 1:20 we have been taught by our Prophet
[30:44] that those uh Seven Stars those seven
[30:47] angels are seven men uh who will be to
[30:51] each dispensation of the seven Church
[30:53] ages but notice in the Amplified it
[30:57] doesn't say that they're Messengers it
[30:59] says they are Divine
[31:01] Messengers so now it's making it
[31:04] completely appear as if those are
[31:06] Heavenly
[31:08] Angels uh that are going to give
[31:10] messages to church is and who are they
[31:14] where are they coming from so uh a huge
[31:17] distinction because now this will affect
[31:20] the way we believe excellent point there
[31:22] brother yeah I just was studying on that
[31:24] recently um I kind of wrote about that
[31:26] in my 2021 book there's four reasons why
[31:28] these seven angels in Revelation 120
[31:31] have to be human preachers or human
[31:35] Messengers and the first one is the most
[31:37] obvious why would Jesus tell John to
[31:40] write a letter to a Heavenly Angel at
[31:43] leoda when does God ever want a human to
[31:47] give a message to an angel it's the
[31:49] other way around right God always sends
[31:51] the angel to tell the human something
[31:53] and why would a Heavenly Angel need a
[31:54] handwritten letter so that's just one of
[31:58] the four reasons that makes no sense at
[32:00] all um and then like you said brother
[32:02] you said it so right you know Paul was
[32:04] called an Angel by the Galatians David
[32:06] was called an angel uh twice once in 1st
[32:09] Samuel once in 2 Samuel and the word
[32:12] angel means a messenger so John the
[32:14] Baptist is called a messenger by the
[32:16] Lord Jesus so he's likened into an angel
[32:18] a burning and Shining Light right so
[32:22] he's a he's a man Anointed with the
[32:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost well John
[32:25] didn't have it in his soul but he had it
[32:26] in his Spirit he was anointed on fire
[32:29] preaching the word of God he was a
[32:31] messenger of the Covenant so excellent
[32:33] point there excellent point yeah so of
[32:37] course it affects message Doctrine
[32:39] exclusively to us um we have to remember
[32:43] that most nominal Christians have uh
[32:45] have been exhorted by their pastors
[32:48] exhorted by by these preachers that uh
[32:51] and I've had this witnessed to me before
[32:52] is that you can't understand the Book of
[32:54] Revelations so you can read it but don't
[32:57] don't expect much uh it reminds you of
[33:00] of when brother Brandon was dealing with
[33:03] that man in his his experience and and
[33:06] uh he was reading about
[33:08] John uh in the Book of Revelations and
[33:11] he said he must have got some hot
[33:12] peppers and and just kind of lost his
[33:15] mind and brought forth this
[33:17] book and brother Bram said that you know
[33:20] kind of rebuked him and he said he could
[33:21] have lost his job but uh he rebuked him
[33:23] and said he said that was the written
[33:25] word of
[33:26] God God that was divine that was an
[33:29] inspired word that God was doing so yeah
[33:33] it's it's very
[33:34] important that's awesome brother as
[33:36] you're talking it you know just opens up
[33:38] more and more um so this eighth one
[33:41] Revelation 1:20 that's an attack on the
[33:44] seven Church ages and it's also an
[33:47] attack on brother brandham as the
[33:48] seventh Church age messenger so why
[33:51] would we want to use a Bible the
[33:52] Amplified Bible if it attacks the
[33:56] doctrine that brother brandham gave to
[33:58] us of course we wouldn't and then I was
[34:00] reminded you know on the seventh one
[34:01] with acts 238 that was an attack really
[34:04] on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[34:06] three works of Grace so all of our core
[34:09] biblical
[34:10] Fundamental Bible revelations that God
[34:13] has restored at the end time are being
[34:16] attacked of course by Satan as he
[34:18] perverts the word of God and produces
[34:20] these false Bible translations wonderful
[34:22] brother right
[34:29] so the next example we would like to
[34:33] give is actually working with uh the the
[34:37] nanism of the four spirits of antichrist
[34:41] that would actually face the church and
[34:44] uh in Revelations 2:6 it says but in the
[34:48] King James uh but this thou Hast that
[34:50] thou hatest the Deeds of the
[34:53] nians uh which I also hate so it tells
[34:58] us in that Ephesus Church that they had
[35:01] uh this
[35:03] nianis uh that was actually uh something
[35:07] that the early church hated it's very
[35:10] interesting here because Jesus only says
[35:13] twice in the King James version in the
[35:16] seven Church ages of something he
[35:19] hates this is the first time he says it
[35:22] and he says he hates the Deeds of the
[35:26] nicians
[35:28] okay now the other versions are are
[35:30] fairly close to that but when we go to
[35:34] uh Revelations 2:15 a few Church ages
[35:37] down uh we see that coming up again and
[35:41] in Revelations 2:15 the King James
[35:43] version it says so as thou also them
[35:45] that hold the doctrine of the nicians
[35:48] now here it says now watch this he says
[35:51] which thing I hate so Jesus said in
[35:57] Revelations 26 he hated it the church
[35:59] hated it but now in Revelations 2:15 he
[36:03] doesn't say that the church hates it
[36:06] anymore but he does express and say I
[36:09] hate it so Jesus never changes that he
[36:15] hates
[36:16] nianis okay so in the Amplified in the
[36:21] 15th verse it says ye also have some who
[36:25] in the same way are holding to the
[36:27] teaching of the nicians
[36:30] period and IV says likewise you also
[36:33] have those who hold to the
[36:36] teaching of the
[36:38] nicians period so in the new
[36:42] versions uh it actually takes out where
[36:46] at first it says the church hated and
[36:48] Jesus hated but now in Revelations
[36:51] 2:15 uh the new versions actually take
[36:54] out that Jesus uh has that type of
[36:59] hatred for the nians now we of course we
[37:02] see in the King James the church didn't
[37:04] have that hatred anymore uh so this is
[37:07] very important because uh what we see is
[37:11] according to the teachings of brother
[37:12] brandham is that the Antichrist Spirit
[37:15] of organization is actually fourfold um
[37:18] it is given in the Deeds of nians the
[37:20] doctrines of the nians uh the teaching
[37:23] of balum and then the teaching uh of
[37:26] Jezebel so
[37:28] we see by our interpretation that
[37:31] brother brandham gave to us that nianis
[37:34] in being broken down to Greek form
[37:37] actually means to conquer the
[37:39] Ley um it is the
[37:43] deception uh where Man by humanism
[37:47] begins to
[37:49] blend uh a way of leading the church by
[37:53] his own human will and therefore
[37:56] deposing
[37:58] the spirit of Jesus Christ being the
[38:00] full leadership to the church now of
[38:05] course uh Jesus the only time he talks
[38:08] about nanism he says he hates it the
[38:11] doctrines of the nicians actually was
[38:14] when it became the unbending way for man
[38:19] to have this hybrid leadership over the
[38:23] church the church accepts it and there
[38:27] therefore uh the church is doomed
[38:31] because of that it it does nothing but
[38:33] actually causes the church to move to
[38:35] the next form which is balam ISM so what
[38:39] we see in the new versions is and and
[38:41] and this is why it's important to us
[38:43] message Believers also is because uh
[38:45] that is the revelation of the
[38:48] seals it was a white horse and then it
[38:51] Blends into a red horse the White Horse
[38:54] being deception which is exactly what
[38:57] nickan ISM was it was actually now
[39:01] taking the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[39:04] out of the church which that's what
[39:05] Jesus hates he can't even be the husband
[39:09] to his wife he has to share that with
[39:11] carnal man and Jesus doesn't want to do
[39:14] that he wants his leoty uh to be
[39:18] conquered by him to be led by him he
[39:20] wants his minister to be led by him but
[39:24] uh according to these new versions uh we
[39:27] see that they actually take away that
[39:29] Jesus hates the
[39:31] progression of that Antichrist
[39:34] Spirit wow brother that's very good yes
[39:37] Jesus lays out that four-step Antichrist
[39:40] process and this false Bible version
[39:42] takes out Jesus's hatred for sin so the
[39:46] equivalent to this would be like going
[39:48] to Proverbs where it says you know six
[39:49] things the Lord doth hate right and
[39:52] taking those out of the Old Testament
[39:54] right that would be the maybe like a Old
[39:56] Testament equivalent to it of course we
[39:58] would never do that we want to hate what
[40:00] God hates of course with a Divine or
[40:01] holy hatred uh and we want to love what
[40:04] God loves we want to have the heart of
[40:06] God we want to be a bride after the
[40:09] heart of the Lord Jesus and I love what
[40:11] you said brother Braham said it started
[40:12] off as a sang but then it became the
[40:14] unbending way right the second stage the
[40:18] the doctrines of the nickan the
[40:20] instruction of the nicotin so around the
[40:23] message uh we got to be very careful
[40:26] what new instruction people start adding
[40:29] to their preaching trying to make it an
[40:31] unbending way uh in in regards to
[40:35] separating the leoty from the clergy or
[40:38] we'd say the preachers from the
[40:39] congregation we got to be very careful
[40:42] that we don't uh add our own man-made
[40:44] doctrines because that would already be
[40:46] the second step that Jesus hates he
[40:48] hated the First Step At the beginning he
[40:50] hated just the saying of these uh false
[40:52] doctrines before they became doctrines
[40:55] so excellent point there brother I never
[40:56] saw that before
[40:58] yes and uh maybe just to add one point
[41:01] is uh here we are we are coming in at
[41:04] the very end of the disp the Gentile
[41:07] dispensation and uh due to that fact uh
[41:11] we have a different challenge perhaps
[41:15] than all the other ages uh because now
[41:18] God has actually brought the restoration
[41:21] of the word through the seventh angel um
[41:24] but here you and I uh we weren't here in
[41:26] the 60s we we weren't here at that time
[41:29] but those that actually followed uh
[41:33] after brother bram's passing um they
[41:35] have also established many different
[41:38] doctrines and uh of of course they are
[41:42] not in unity with others doctrines so it
[41:47] therefore puts the church into a spot it
[41:50] puts us preachers in a spot that we
[41:53] realize that there are differences so we
[41:55] need the leadership of the Holy H spirit
[41:58] because he is actually the only one who
[42:00] can rightfully bring us the true
[42:03] Revelation um so um if I could give an
[42:06] example uh an extreme one uh there are
[42:08] those who believe in polygamy and of
[42:11] course they get that from
[42:13] quotations uh while I I believe you and
[42:16] I and by the example of Our Lives we
[42:18] believe a man should have one wife uh
[42:21] and children and so forth um so what
[42:25] would make one right and one wrong well
[42:26] obvious ly this man that interpreted uh
[42:30] basically a legalizing of polygamy um
[42:33] even in message ranks uh he is taken on
[42:37] an anti- position because he doesn't
[42:39] have the revelation of what that is so
[42:42] that's what nickan is actually doing
[42:44] he's now bringing not just uh actions
[42:48] but he's also bringing it under a word
[42:51] interpretation to be a lord over God's
[42:55] people and of course what we we've seen
[42:57] many lives destroyed because of even
[42:59] that Doctrine and
[43:01] confusions yeah no doubt a lot of
[43:03] confusion a lot of uh lustful Spirits in
[43:06] there that's just one good example
[43:08] brother excellent example uh as you were
[43:10] talking I thought about the four-step
[43:12] process that works out through the
[43:14] church ages right you know through the
[43:17] the so the fourth step the depths of it
[43:19] was actually in that fourth Church age
[43:21] th tyan right but then also this
[43:24] four-step process it does happen in
[43:26] every Church age individually with every
[43:29] Ministry because this four-step process
[43:31] is also the four steps to sin and
[43:33] spiritual death like James 1: 1314 and
[43:37] 15 say God doesn't tempt any man but we
[43:41] can see those four steps just like the
[43:42] four horse riters just like the four
[43:44] bugs uh we can see them uh right listed
[43:47] here it's uh lust enticed is the first
[43:50] so that that would be equivalent to the
[43:52] the Deeds of the nicians the second
[43:53] would be lust conceived that would be
[43:55] the equivalent to the doctrine of the
[43:58] nicians then you have sin which would be
[44:00] equivalent to the doctrine of balum and
[44:03] then the fourth would be death which
[44:05] would be equivalent to the spirit of
[44:07] Jezebel or The Jezebel the four step The
[44:10] Jezebel religion so God yeah and so you
[44:13] stated it very plainly brother wow even
[44:14] since brother Bram died 1965 now from
[44:17] 1966 on we've seen all these people come
[44:20] after brother brandom and if they
[44:22] started their Ministries with pure
[44:24] hearts if they didn't protect it if they
[44:26] didn't keep hating the spirit of
[44:28] organization then these four stages
[44:31] would produce themselves and they'd Fall
[44:33] Away in those individual lives and
[44:36] Ministry uh but we just can't point at
[44:38] them we got to look at our lives too and
[44:39] make sure we're keeping the pure word of
[44:41] God so this is another great scripture
[44:43] brother I had never thought about this I
[44:45] had never heard that I never seen how
[44:47] the Amplified did that so excellent
[44:49] point there anything else you want to
[44:50] say on that brother well that is the
[44:53] what message people would like to call
[44:55] the Pinnacle
[44:57] of the Revelation that was given to us
[45:00] was the opening of the
[45:01] seals so you know this is just taking
[45:04] out one portion as far as just saying
[45:06] okay well uh he doesn't hate that
[45:09] anymore he doesn't like it a little bit
[45:11] but he doesn't hate it but uh to us it
[45:15] is actually this four stage horse rider
[45:18] is actually what destroyed the church
[45:20] and you said it very
[45:21] wonderfully um that we're all going to
[45:25] fight this so we need the purity of the
[45:28] word given by the leadership of the Holy
[45:31] Spirit and we need to hate especially
[45:35] nanism because that is the deceptive one
[45:40] Jezebel is not necessarily the the most
[45:42] deceptive Jezebel just like okay we the
[45:43] prophets I'm going to kill
[45:45] them and she put that doctrine of of of
[45:49] death out uh so uh yeah it's it's very
[45:52] important and especially for us as
[45:54] message Believers because you know Jesus
[45:56] will have an un organized bride
[45:58] completely uh there's a I believe
[46:00] there's a quote where brother BR talks
[46:02] about not one Speck of
[46:04] denominationalism so that that's what we
[46:06] want to be so let let us hate it like
[46:09] Jesus hates it
[46:11] Hallelujah absolutely yeah we we got to
[46:14] agree with every word of God it goes
[46:15] back to that first Doctrine you talked
[46:17] about you know uh Matthew 4:4 we must
[46:19] live by every word of God and we're not
[46:22] claiming uh Perfection but it's our
[46:24] desire of course uh we what I mean is we
[46:27] sin every day but it's our desire to
[46:29] want to fulfill every word of God to to
[46:32] be obedient to every word of God and
[46:34] like you said this is this can be very
[46:36] deceptive uh in message ranks or even in
[46:40] general churches or if they miss Satan's
[46:42] deception and they don't hate false
[46:44] doctrine that
[46:46] separates um you know clergy or
[46:49] preachers from the leoty if they don't
[46:51] catch that then they start becoming
[46:53] exalted preachers they start magnifying
[46:56] themselves they start calling themselves
[46:57] the greatest of all time which we have a
[46:59] video about that we've taught about that
[47:00] preached on that and that is a real
[47:03] manifestation I believe in my humble
[47:05] opinion that's a real manifestation that
[47:07] the Deeds are certainly in the works and
[47:10] if they if they would continue to preach
[47:12] Doctrine and try to use verses to
[47:14] support their own prideful statements
[47:16] then to me that would be an obvious sign
[47:18] that they have allowed the enemy to give
[47:20] them the doctrine of the
[47:23] nicians yeah one one more thing to add
[47:25] brother um the church age book goes into
[47:28] this which is very powerful but uh just
[47:31] as you were saying it it built four
[47:33] stages into the four Church
[47:35] ages um of course in the fourth Church
[47:37] ages it went to Jezebel but uh in the
[47:40] church age book it actually says that
[47:43] then it started going back the other way
[47:45] with
[47:46] restoration so when Jezebel was
[47:49] removed um then bism set in and then the
[47:54] doctrine of ncol uh the doctrine of
[47:56] Nicol they were coming out of that so
[47:59] our specific age is actually the age
[48:02] where it's so close it would deceive the
[48:04] elect if possible or that white horse
[48:07] riter as far as resisting what that is
[48:10] to get back to the effective word uh
[48:12] because that's what the church first
[48:13] church had so they had to be free of
[48:16] nianis in order to manifest the fullness
[48:20] of the word which we are coming to our
[48:22] the hearts of the children turn back to
[48:25] the Pentecostal fathers and the same
[48:27] works and power and Leadership so uh
[48:31] yeah it's a very important topic so but
[48:33] you're exactly right uh that is what uh
[48:35] you've done those videos um and and this
[48:38] is the issue is that once nickol aism is
[48:42] accepted they actually start if a
[48:44] minister in the message uh accepts
[48:47] nianis they go to the doctrines they go
[48:49] to the Deeds uh the uh excuse me the the
[48:52] doctrines and then they go to
[48:55] bmismart and so what we'll find is
[48:57] exactly like Jesus when Jesus was
[49:00] crucified it was actually those who
[49:02] actually stood against him those who we
[49:04] came to they actually became a Jezebel
[49:07] spirit to him to kill him off so those
[49:11] that will be in that ministry that's so
[49:14] close they themselves will
[49:17] turn and they will become a Jezebel
[49:20] spirit unto those who are actually going
[49:23] to the fullness of the word that's a
[49:25] great thought yeah that got me thinking
[49:27] brother uh beautiful point I had
[49:29] forgotten about that where the four
[49:32] stages now go in revers because God's
[49:34] restoring the church that makes total
[49:36] sense with Martin Luther John Wesley
[49:39] isua and here we are wow uh brother
[49:42] Ram's ministry here at the end time
[49:44] beautiful point there so this is again
[49:46] attack on the revelation of the Seven
[49:48] Seals great point there and then as you
[49:50] said that um I was thinking you know if
[49:54] we're being restored we'll battle that
[49:56] first step right the deed yes the Deeds
[49:58] of the nicians because we're being
[50:00] restored back exactly right and and
[50:04] that's that is the restoration because
[50:06] you and I we must be 100
[50:09] submitted to Jesus Christ to for the
[50:12] leadership to take a local body into a
[50:15] Rapture right and that's what Enoch
[50:17] would have had right Enoch was raptured
[50:18] because he walked with God he pleased
[50:20] God he was pleasing in all of his deeds
[50:23] of course all of his Doctrine as well
[50:25] right right and brother one more thing
[50:28] too you know I thought two more things
[50:29] to add to that you know we're battling
[50:31] the Deeds right but we also have the
[50:33] eagle anointing to do it because of the
[50:35] force seal so the eagle the prophetic
[50:38] anointing uh feeding on the the fresh
[50:41] carcass Jesus said where the carcasses
[50:43] the Eagles would be gathered so if we
[50:44] have the anointing to be on the fresh
[50:46] word and Fly Above the things of the
[50:48] world we fly above the Deeds of the
[50:50] nians will be flying around in Heavenly
[50:53] places in Christ Jesus and then we also
[50:55] have the seventh step on the Statue of
[50:57] perfect man brother Ram said it applies
[50:59] to the individual but brother R said
[51:01] also applies to the church age so that
[51:03] means brotherly brotherly kindness will
[51:06] be a major factor in overcoming the
[51:09] Deeds of nickol in so as brothers we
[51:11] want to love each other as sisters
[51:13] Brothers and Sisters in Christ we want
[51:14] to love each other we'll never want to
[51:16] divide we'll never want to put our own
[51:18] thoughts and opinions in it and be led
[51:19] by man the brotherly kindness uh inside
[51:22] of us by the Holy Ghost will want us to
[51:24] treat everyone as a a brother and sister
[51:27] in Christ and not exalt ourselves above
[51:30] others right Amen brother that's exactly
[51:33] right um and of course when you you get
[51:36] into some of that wording uh I didn't
[51:38] plan to go this way but uh when you look
[51:41] at how the the new versions actually
[51:43] talk about the stature of a perfect man
[51:46] uh so you know we would find that in uh
[51:50] the King James it would say brotherly
[51:52] kindness uh that that root word of
[51:54] course in the Greek is is actually
[51:55] Philadelphia
[51:57] which is Brotherly Love um but you know
[52:00] if you look in the NIV it doesn't say
[52:02] brotherly kindness it actually says
[52:05] Mutual affection so you see when you
[52:09] start changing the
[52:11] wordings you'll find in these different
[52:13] versions now your stature of a perfect
[52:15] man actually has exclusively changed now
[52:19] it's not brotherly kindness It's
[52:23] actually Mutual affection well
[52:27] that's very vague in every sense of
[52:30] those two words Mutual does not say
[52:34] brother it says Mutual so when what does
[52:36] that mean when you're around someone
[52:38] else uh you want to show
[52:42] affection uh so it it doesn't uh signify
[52:46] what the King James says because the
[52:48] King James says that the issue and the
[52:49] challenge would be amongst brothers and
[52:52] that the overcoming Spirit of that
[52:54] adding to it would be to love your
[52:56] brother it would be able to show them
[52:58] kindness and the NIV of course would
[53:01] change that to a mutual affection
[53:03] instead so it's a different uh
[53:07] requirement completely right that
[53:09] reminds me of Jesus when he was there
[53:11] teaching and uh his mother and the the
[53:14] his Brethren come and say uh we want to
[53:16] talk to him and said who are my brothers
[53:18] who's my family that these who are
[53:20] sitting right here with me so uh those
[53:23] who obey the fresh word of God the the
[53:25] true revelation
[53:27] the present truth as Peter said yeah
[53:29] mutual affection is so broad it's so
[53:32] General Jesus is referring to the
[53:34] brothers right like he said in Matthew
[53:36] 25 as you did it to the least of these
[53:38] my brethren you did it unto me and
[53:41] brother said the foolish virgin we not
[53:43] his Brethren uh the the Brethren are
[53:45] those who are born again with the
[53:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost again getting
[53:48] back to the three works of Grace
[53:49] justification sanctification and baptism
[53:52] Holy Ghost so yeah great point there
[53:53] brother that might be a whole another
[53:54] topic you know or whole another subjects
[53:57] that we can cover in this uh it' be
[53:59] great to study on the Statue of perfect
[54:01] man
[54:07] amen so this is another one brother I
[54:09] would love to turn here and uh this
[54:13] recently last several years here uh has
[54:16] been really big on my heart because uh
[54:19] there there's actually a movement that's
[54:21] it's been advertised actually not even
[54:24] advertised proclaimed to be almost this
[54:28] unbending Revelation that explains
[54:31] everything that we're dealing with and
[54:34] what's getting ready to happen and uh
[54:36] what I have found out that that this
[54:39] Doctrine uh of the
[54:42] Nephilim um is actually uh it is the
[54:45] perfect counterfeit to serpent
[54:49] seed and uh I would like to go through
[54:52] this in the new
[54:53] versions uh I I have a whole bible study
[54:57] on this I and actually kind of go
[54:59] through the history and some of the
[55:00] things on that uh but uh I would like to
[55:03] show you what the Bible says um so if
[55:06] you actually go into the Old Testament
[55:08] you'll find that uh the statement or the
[55:10] phrase sons of God uh it doesn't really
[55:15] happen a lot but in
[55:20] job6 the King James Bible actually says
[55:24] now there was a day when the sons of God
[55:27] came to present themselves before the
[55:29] Lord and Satan came also among
[55:34] them okay now in the Amplified and
[55:38] hopefully we can go into some greater
[55:40] depths with this but it says now there
[55:41] was a day uh when the sons of God
[55:45] parentheses Angels Came to present
[55:48] themselves before the Lord and Satan uh
[55:52] parenthesis adversary accuser also came
[55:55] among them
[55:56] then IV says one day the Angels Came to
[56:01] present themselves before the Lord and
[56:04] Satan also came with
[56:06] them uh so in
[56:09] job6 uh we find that the King James
[56:12] version uh it says sons of God and and
[56:15] this is very important because uh what
[56:18] actually happened is uh there's a modern
[56:20] doctrine of the
[56:22] Nephilim uh which people actually
[56:25] believe that Angels came down and
[56:27] procreated with women uh and therefore
[56:31] uh created this race of Giants and uh
[56:35] I've heard even message believers they
[56:36] said brother cam there are giants hiding
[56:39] in the in the caverns of the Earth
[56:41] getting ready to come forth and uh in
[56:43] this Doctrine they say that at the very
[56:45] end time that these Giants will come out
[56:47] and take over the Earth and so forth um
[56:50] but this is what happened in Genesis 6
[56:54] it talks about the condition Before the
[56:57] Flood and it said that the sons of God
[57:00] saw that the the daughters of men were
[57:03] fair and they took for them as
[57:05] wives what we find is is that the new
[57:09] versions are actually changing the
[57:12] meaning of the phrase sons of God to
[57:16] actually mean Angels they found all
[57:20] these manuscripts uh and they found out
[57:23] that in these ancient manuscripts soal
[57:26] called that they actually say sons of
[57:28] God are actually
[57:30] Angels well in our first reading in job
[57:33] 1:6 we find that the new versions
[57:35] actually tells us that sons of God are
[57:39] angels uh so that of course is uh not
[57:43] true from what we know but what they're
[57:44] saying is is that there's a counterfeit
[57:47] human hybrid race that actually has come
[57:51] forth uh from the procreation of angels
[57:55] now the scripture tells us and this is
[57:56] why you know a Bible believer you you'll
[57:58] always look at the word of God but in
[58:00] Hebrews 1:5 it says uh For unto which of
[58:03] his angels said he at any time Thou Art
[58:06] my son this day have I begotten thee and
[58:09] again I will be a father be to him a
[58:11] father and he shall be to me a son so
[58:15] the Bible tells us that when did he ever
[58:17] call an angel a
[58:19] son when he say unto them Thou Art my
[58:22] son so this Doctrine which has come
[58:27] forth now the new versions are actually
[58:29] telling us that there is this human
[58:31] hybrid race but we as message Believers
[58:35] we of course know that that actually
[58:37] went back to Genesis 3 uh with the
[58:42] Affairs that Eve had with the
[58:45] serpent so
[58:47] basically now there's a whole different
[58:51] doctrine that has come forth and the new
[58:53] versions actually are telling us that
[58:55] the these angels actually have a hybrid
[58:57] race on Earth right now amongst us which
[59:00] word in the English is Nephilim in the
[59:03] Hebrew that's what I forgot so the word
[59:06] Nephilim actually uh it's only stated uh
[59:08] I believe twice in in the Old Testament
[59:12] uh Nephilim uh that would be in Genesis
[59:14] 6 and and then it comes back around and
[59:17] and talks about uh the Giants uh in
[59:21] Joshua's time so and and looking at the
[59:24] land so it only says that twice
[59:27] but what they've done is they've
[59:29] actually talked
[59:31] about this new
[59:33] interpretation of that Hebrew word uh
[59:36] and actually it's it's Ben L so sons of
[59:39] God so they're actually saying that that
[59:44] actually means Angels though it's never
[59:46] interpreted that way if we had time and
[59:49] and like I said I did a Bible study of
[59:50] it but you'll find that there are other
[59:53] occasions in the Old Testament where
[59:54] these sons of God presented them
[59:56] themselves before God and it words that
[59:58] in the King James version accordingly it
[1:00:00] says they presented themselves before
[1:00:03] the Tabernacle unto God but what they do
[1:00:06] is they will uh actually now come up
[1:00:09] with this whole separate idea uh in
[1:00:13] Genesis 6 and ver first verse it says it
[1:00:16] came to pass when men began to multiply
[1:00:18] on the face of the Earth and daughters
[1:00:20] were born unto them that the sons of God
[1:00:23] saw the daughters of men that they were
[1:00:26] fair and they took wives of all which
[1:00:29] they chose and the Lord said uh my
[1:00:33] spirit shall not always strive with man
[1:00:35] for that he is also flesh yet his days
[1:00:38] shall be 120 years there were giants in
[1:00:42] the earth in those days and also after
[1:00:45] that when the sons of God came in unto
[1:00:47] the daughters of men and they bare
[1:00:49] children to them and the the same became
[1:00:52] Mighty Men which were of old men of
[1:00:56] Renown uh so now because they can
[1:01:00] interpret they interpret that these sons
[1:01:02] of God in the Book of Job are angels so
[1:01:06] they come back and say well look there
[1:01:08] were sons of God here that took
[1:01:10] Daughters of men and they produced
[1:01:13] Giants okay so when I studied this out
[1:01:18] uh because that sounds very
[1:01:21] plausible but the King James version
[1:01:24] only says sons of God well I wonder if
[1:01:27] uh Genesis 6 would actually
[1:01:30] fit with the understanding of serpent
[1:01:33] seed that we have and because we know
[1:01:36] that brother brandham told us that uh
[1:01:38] the Giants were actually a production of
[1:01:40] Cain's seed hybrid with the woman's
[1:01:44] seed uh so if you go to Genesis 64 again
[1:01:47] it says there were giants in the earth
[1:01:49] in those days and then you have your
[1:01:52] semicolon and it says and also after
[1:01:56] that when the sons of God came in unto
[1:02:00] the daughters of
[1:02:02] men so it actually will back up what
[1:02:05] brother Brandon brought as serpent seed
[1:02:07] because it actually says that before the
[1:02:09] sons of God came in unto the daughters
[1:02:12] of men there were already Giants in the
[1:02:14] earth in those days so what we have is
[1:02:18] and they said it was actually the uh a
[1:02:20] Jewish sect that came up with that
[1:02:22] belief um that the Angels actually
[1:02:26] corrupted themselves with human uh
[1:02:29] women this is an attack then on the
[1:02:31] serpent seed teaching is that right
[1:02:33] brother cam absolutely because uh what
[1:02:36] what the revelation of serpent seed is
[1:02:37] it is a hybridism with the true seed of
[1:02:41] God uh with a seed that is not a son of
[1:02:45] God's seed which we understand that the
[1:02:47] serpent was created uh to be almost like
[1:02:52] man brother brandom said he was hairier
[1:02:54] he was bigger but yet appealing to Eve
[1:02:58] uh in the knowledge that he was trying
[1:02:59] to bring her which is of course uh the
[1:03:02] the advances of um of sex so what this
[1:03:07] Doctrine actually does is it tries to
[1:03:09] explain this giant hybrid race not from
[1:03:13] the serpent it actually makes it from
[1:03:15] demon Angels Fallen Angels who came down
[1:03:20] and turned somehow created a flesh for
[1:03:22] them to live in because angels are
[1:03:24] ministering spirits
[1:03:26] and created a flesh somehow which can an
[1:03:29] angel a fallen angel or even Satan
[1:03:31] create no they can only pervert we never
[1:03:34] see that Satan can create flesh uh if
[1:03:37] think about it if Satan as demons could
[1:03:39] create flesh uh wouldn't they be living
[1:03:41] right amongst us right
[1:03:43] now so uh it's not even biblical in any
[1:03:46] sense but this is what uh of course
[1:03:49] false doctrines and twisting the word of
[1:03:51] done and now the new versions have
[1:03:53] changed uh these rendering to make this
[1:03:57] the belief of how hybridism uh actually
[1:04:01] got in and caused a false genetics in
[1:04:06] the uh in in a hybrid human race that
[1:04:09] lives amongst us which we know that it
[1:04:11] was the serpent that actually came forth
[1:04:14] and brought forth his seed into Eve
[1:04:17] produced twins with Adam's seed and of
[1:04:20] course uh there we find two offsprings
[1:04:24] one of a hybrid human and the other of a
[1:04:28] son of God's seed and of course that
[1:04:30] hybrid seed of course became just like
[1:04:32] Satan he was a murderer he was a liar uh
[1:04:35] he was evil so this of course uh shows
[1:04:39] where they're trying to take the people
[1:04:41] now they're they're trying to get them
[1:04:44] they'll look and they'll say uh oh that
[1:04:46] this the serpent had uh uh sexual
[1:04:49] relations with Eve that's insanity but
[1:04:52] they'll at the same right they will say
[1:04:55] well fallen angel came down made himself
[1:04:58] a flesh and took a human woman to be his
[1:05:03] wife so that means that they had they
[1:05:05] had actually marriage processions and
[1:05:08] that angel lived on Earth with that
[1:05:11] woman and produced Giants from that well
[1:05:14] was the angel a giant there it just it
[1:05:16] just does nothing but add confusion and
[1:05:18] unanswered questions which tells you
[1:05:21] that you know God is not a bringer of
[1:05:22] confusion uh God is a bringer of Truth
[1:05:25] uh so here it is we have these things
[1:05:27] that they're putting into the newer
[1:05:30] Bible versions that were not part of the
[1:05:33] original script amen excellent
[1:05:36] observation there brother I never knew
[1:05:37] that about the Nephilim and the new
[1:05:40] Bible versions you know brother Ram said
[1:05:42] serpent seed doesn't save you he said he
[1:05:44] said but it sure does bring more light
[1:05:46] on the truth we're all trying to
[1:05:49] see so that false Bible translation I
[1:05:53] think I made a video one time on this
[1:05:54] you know uh the Nephilim is so close to
[1:05:57] the truth but so far away uh it's so clo
[1:06:01] it's so close because there is a hybrid
[1:06:03] race right it's the human race right uh
[1:06:06] so there is a hybrid between uh human
[1:06:09] and beast it's not the angel and human
[1:06:12] hybrid it's the serpent and human hybrid
[1:06:16] and uh like you said brother very well
[1:06:17] uh Genesis 3:15 it's thus sayith the
[1:06:19] Lord there's two kinds of offspring God
[1:06:22] said that it's not brother brandom it's
[1:06:24] not you or I not any other preacher God
[1:06:27] said there's hatred between uh thee The
[1:06:29] Serpent and the woman between thy seed
[1:06:32] her seed so God recognized there's two
[1:06:35] different offsprings now of course we
[1:06:36] know they've all intermarried around the
[1:06:38] time of the flood and so all of our
[1:06:40] flesh uh is born in corruption and so
[1:06:43] that's why we need we need a Heavenly
[1:06:44] birth you must be born again John
[1:06:46] chapter 3 and 1 Peter 1:23 you must be
[1:06:48] born again of The Incorruptible seed the
[1:06:50] word of God so we all need a new seed
[1:06:52] it's a spiritual seed but uh excellent
[1:06:55] point you you said it perfectly like
[1:06:57] brother brandom said it Satan is not a
[1:06:59] Creator Angels cannot create themselves
[1:07:01] a physical body to procreate with human
[1:07:05] women and yeah that's such a funny
[1:07:06] statement to think like Angels come down
[1:07:08] and had wedding processions like that's
[1:07:10] just
[1:07:11] ridiculous it it's hard to believe what
[1:07:13] these people actually believe and the
[1:07:15] depths of their confusion or deception
[1:07:17] that that they actually go to um demons
[1:07:20] can only transform like uh Paul said
[1:07:22] about Satan he transforms himself into
[1:07:24] an angel of light uh but Satan and his
[1:07:27] demons cannot create physical bodies in
[1:07:30] order to procreate or else like you said
[1:07:32] there would be a bunch of demon human
[1:07:34] hybrids here running around right now
[1:07:36] why would he stop procreating right he'd
[1:07:38] want to overtake the Earth right and
[1:07:39] kill all the Christians and and so forth
[1:07:42] like that so again excellent point
[1:07:43] brother we see this attack against
[1:07:45] serpent seed it falls flat it takes away
[1:07:48] from the word of God and we always want
[1:07:49] to stay with the word of God yeah Satan
[1:07:52] never had the ability to come in flesh
[1:07:53] himself but when uh when it came time to
[1:07:56] betray Jesus the Bible said Satan
[1:07:59] entered Judas well why wouldn't Satan
[1:08:02] just come himself as and make his own
[1:08:04] flesh he didn't do it uh then you you
[1:08:07] come down to our age where where we see
[1:08:10] that uh the Antichrist will basically
[1:08:13] he'll take leadership over the Earth
[1:08:16] well why don't Satan just come himself
[1:08:18] and do this if he's cast out of heaven
[1:08:21] so we see a great
[1:08:22] inconsistency uh with the very fact that
[1:08:25] Angels never have the ability to make or
[1:08:30] create a flesh for themselves uh and the
[1:08:33] issue is uh mainly is that from
[1:08:35] Alexandria we have what they call the
[1:08:37] Book of Enoch and and the Book of Enoch
[1:08:40] uh there was a man I believe his last
[1:08:42] name is Wy in the uh right early 1900s
[1:08:45] and he put together a book of Watchers a
[1:08:48] Book of Enoch there's there and it's
[1:08:50] actually it's called a
[1:08:51] pseudepigrapha and it's a gathering of
[1:08:53] of different writings to make one book
[1:08:56] and he made um This Book of Enoch from
[1:08:59] five different renderings of This Book
[1:09:02] of Enoch and he put them all together
[1:09:05] and made one Book of
[1:09:07] Enoch so it was never accepted by the
[1:09:10] King James fathers even though it was
[1:09:12] there uh but they also found that there
[1:09:15] was never a Hebrew rendering of the Book
[1:09:18] of
[1:09:19] Enoch so once again you have you have
[1:09:22] corrupted manuscripts from Alexandria uh
[1:09:26] you know just like the Westcott hortex
[1:09:28] the sinicus and they actually bring them
[1:09:31] out and they try to infuse this into the
[1:09:33] church as true Doctrine wow excellent
[1:09:36] point I never saw that about Judas you
[1:09:38] know Satan filled his heart just like
[1:09:40] ananas and safire Satan filled their
[1:09:42] bodies right filled their hearts and
[1:09:44] then the future Antichrist will be
[1:09:45] filled according to 2 Thessalonians
[1:09:47] chapter 2 filled with Satan excellent
[1:09:49] point why didn't Satan just create his
[1:09:50] own human body excellent point I love
[1:09:52] what brother Ram teaches us you know if
[1:09:53] it's the Revelation if it's the true
[1:09:55] revelation of God it always points you
[1:09:57] back to the word of God and it won't
[1:09:58] contradict anything in the scripture
[1:10:00] excellent amen so it seems like you know
[1:10:04] regarding the Book of Enoch it just
[1:10:05] takes a little bit of historical
[1:10:07] research and you'll see why the church
[1:10:10] you know especially around the time of
[1:10:11] the King James version 1600 then the
[1:10:13] revised version was it 1818 but you know
[1:10:16] we we know why they did not include the
[1:10:18] Book of Enoch as an inspired text right
[1:10:22] yeah and and and honestly brother the
[1:10:24] five books hadn't been put together
[1:10:27] yet which one do you choose so it's just
[1:10:31] like the Apocrypha you know what I mean
[1:10:33] they go against the Bible and and
[1:10:35] there's really not a 100% proof of the
[1:10:40] authorship or the inherency so and and
[1:10:43] then you're you're talking about a time
[1:10:45] when they were backslid people you know
[1:10:47] the the books that have been given to us
[1:10:49] were were people moved on by the Holy
[1:10:51] Ghost but I mean you read the book of
[1:10:52] mccabes and some of these other places I
[1:10:54] mean it might be hisor to some sense but
[1:10:57] but the worshiping of angels and things
[1:10:58] like that that that ain't an inspired
[1:11:00] word praying to the dead and things like
[1:11:02] that you we don't that's obviously not
[1:11:05] inspired absolutely yeah like we've
[1:11:07] heard you know the reason these
[1:11:09] Apocrypha books and other books Book of
[1:11:10] Enoch are rejected uh because they
[1:11:13] totally contradict all the other
[1:11:15] inspired the reeded
[1:11:17] texts yeah it's exactly right and I and
[1:11:21] I would say this uh brothers that uh
[1:11:24] when you look even with what we covered
[1:11:27] last time and this time um it is a
[1:11:30] deliberate attempt of Satan to try to so
[1:11:36] spread out Truth uh so to say that uh it
[1:11:40] makes it so only the elect will be able
[1:11:43] to to see what truth is and and actually
[1:11:47] work on it you know there was something
[1:11:49] that that Drew us you know when you when
[1:11:51] you read that and you seen a scripture
[1:11:52] not in the Bible and it's this different
[1:11:54] version you there's something that says
[1:11:56] why is that the idea is it looks like
[1:11:59] Satan what Satan is trying to do is is
[1:12:02] he's trying to make all these little
[1:12:05] small
[1:12:06] changes but actually it destroys the
[1:12:09] interpretation that leads to Perfection
[1:12:12] and that's what we're looking for we're
[1:12:14] we're looking to uh believe exactly what
[1:12:17] he said so you know as brother brandom
[1:12:19] said he said one word
[1:12:21] off one word off uh when we all and this
[1:12:25] case of Brotherly kindness we all ought
[1:12:27] to be seeking the Lord for leadership
[1:12:30] Even in our disagreements as far as if
[1:12:32] someone believes us or someone believes
[1:12:33] that so it requires uh the place that it
[1:12:37] should be pointing us to is Lord we need
[1:12:40] a greater leadership from you a greater
[1:12:43] unfolding of yourself amen very well
[1:12:45] said yeah the elect cannot be deceived
[1:12:47] you know these little issues Satan
[1:12:49] brings out you know uh the Bible said
[1:12:51] we're not ignorant of his devices so the
[1:12:54] ways he deceives and he deceives by just
[1:12:56] changing Little Words Right little uh
[1:12:58] brother Ram say he's not going to come
[1:12:59] out and right away do some awful easy to
[1:13:02] detect deception it's a small thing
[1:13:04] first and in these five examples we've
[1:13:07] seen how Satan's try to convince people
[1:13:10] there's a lesser punishment for changing
[1:13:11] the word of God that was the sixth
[1:13:14] Doctrine the the seventh was attacking
[1:13:15] the three works of Grace in relation to
[1:13:18] the water baptism and influencing people
[1:13:20] that they're already born again when
[1:13:22] they're not so that even attacks the
[1:13:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:25] in Acts 238 the eth one was Revelation
[1:13:28] 1:20 the attack on the church ages and
[1:13:32] the attack on brother brandom as the
[1:13:33] seventh Church age messenger and then
[1:13:37] the ninth was the attack on the
[1:13:39] revelation of the Seven Seals and
[1:13:41] brother Ram's Revelation on the
[1:13:42] four-step process of the
[1:13:44] Antichrist uh but thank God for the
[1:13:46] four-step restoration process of the
[1:13:48] Holy Ghost and then 10th the attack on
[1:13:51] the revelation of the serpent seed God's
[1:13:54] truth will prevail the hybridization of
[1:13:57] Beast and Humanity uh and also the then
[1:14:00] the necessity today for the spiritual
[1:14:03] seed the seed of the word of God The
[1:14:05] Incorruptible seed the baptism of the
[1:14:07] Holy Ghost
[1:14:13] amen well we've come to the conclusion
[1:14:16] of this third podcast very thankful
[1:14:18] again for brother cam uh donating his
[1:14:20] time here and uh sharing What the Lord
[1:14:22] Has revealed to his heart I feel very
[1:14:24] inspired I'm very encouraged by these
[1:14:26] wonderful Revelations and truths our
[1:14:28] brother showed to us we thank God for
[1:14:30] the Holy Ghost guiding us into all truth
[1:14:32] giving us uh confidence that he's
[1:14:34] preserved his word to this generation as
[1:14:37] Psalm 12:7 says and this reminded me of
[1:14:40] uh Matthew
[1:14:42] 24:4 Satan's deception will be so close
[1:14:44] that it would deceive the verel if it
[1:14:46] were possible thank God it's not
[1:14:48] possible now we have 10 examples of
[1:14:51] course Lord willing if the Lord allows
[1:14:53] we'll get to the rest of them with of
[1:14:55] course there's many more uh but now we
[1:14:56] can see 10 clear examples of Satan
[1:15:00] slightly intelligently brother Ram said
[1:15:02] Satan's a genius at his job he's a
[1:15:04] genius to try to just change one little
[1:15:06] word uh emphasize something a little
[1:15:08] less take away from the serpent seed or
[1:15:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the
[1:15:12] church ages or the Seven Seals but the
[1:15:15] elect cannot be deceived so again we're
[1:15:17] thankful for this opportunity and our
[1:15:19] faith is more solidified on the King
[1:15:22] James version as the infallible word of
[1:15:24] God and so we'll let our brother cam say
[1:15:26] a few things in closing here by God's
[1:15:27] grace thank you brother cam for being
[1:15:29] with us in this podcast yeah we thank
[1:15:31] you as well brother we appreciate that
[1:15:33] hard work that you're doing and get
[1:15:35] truth out to God's elect wherever they
[1:15:37] would be and uh I agree with all of that
[1:15:40] wholeheartedly brother it's it's the
[1:15:41] hour where uh the more you're looking
[1:15:44] the more God is revealing uh the more
[1:15:46] you feel that pole to to get in and eat
[1:15:49] the word uh it is God's desire to show
[1:15:52] in every case in every point every
[1:15:54] Doctrine
[1:15:55] uh that he is the Living God in that
[1:15:57] Doctrine uh in that point of view so uh
[1:16:00] we're so glad that uh you know what here
[1:16:02] it is God has revealed to our eyes that
[1:16:05] uh we found truth and uh we believe that
[1:16:08] with all of our hearts and uh what we
[1:16:10] see is every angle that God sets us at
[1:16:12] we see that there are answers there
[1:16:15] there proof evidences to show us you
[1:16:18] know even with these Bible versions
[1:16:19] they're showing us that that this Bible
[1:16:22] is not this Bible they are different and
[1:16:25] thank God for eyes to see the
[1:16:27] differences and the reasons why uh so
[1:16:30] once again we we appreciate all the
[1:16:31] listeners and everyone who who are
[1:16:33] interested in this type of a topic
[1:16:34] because it's it's a little bit deeper
[1:16:36] but yet it's very rich and uh the
[1:16:38] distinctions are made very clear by the
[1:16:41] Lord Jesus
[1:16:47] Christ in a genuine Faith Of God will
[1:16:50] believe in God and God is the word it'll
[1:16:53] never add nothing should the Bible tells
[1:16:56] us if we add one word or take one word
[1:16:58] away our part will be taken from The
[1:17:00] Book of Life Revelations 22:18 the last
[1:17:03] closing chapter I stand before him I
[1:17:06] want to be found innocent I've ever
[1:17:08] trying to add one thing to that word or
[1:17:11] take one for play just exactly the way
[1:17:13] it is teaching people to right up to it
[1:17:17] the Bible says this I can't help what
[1:17:19] anyone else says I got to stay right
[1:17:21] with that and here was those people
[1:17:24] standing around like that when I said
[1:17:26] will Paul have to be judged for the
[1:17:28] gospel he preached said yes I said I
[1:17:30] preached every word just exactly the way
[1:17:33] he did and the millions screamed out we
[1:17:36] are resting on
[1:17:38] that that's way I wanted to be on the
[1:17:40] cross there I want to be that way just
[1:17:43] like that just what Paul said I don't
[1:17:45] want to add one thing to it take one
[1:17:46] thing away from it just what the Bible
[1:17:48] said that's just way I want to keep it
[1:17:50] going and of course you keep it like
[1:17:53] that you got the to have somewhere that
[1:17:56] faith can take its resting
[1:18:00] place and to me I don't know how you
[1:18:03] feel about it but to me the Bible is the
[1:18:08] infallible word of God Amen and I
[1:18:12] believe that God has watched over his
[1:18:15] word that there's not one punctuation
[1:18:18] out of place
[1:18:25] and so we want to thank our listeners
[1:18:27] thank you for your downloads thank you
