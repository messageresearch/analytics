TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ esther jewish queen of persian king xerxes the first who lived about 500 years before christ is never recorded as wearing makeup in the holy bible the king james version and so it's wrong to use her as a proof that christian women and men can wear makeup this video will show bible proofs that esther is never recorded as wearing makeup along with a timeline to support why esther probably avoided wearing makeup and lastly some questions and answers regarding makeup usage the inspiration for this video recently came after i noticed my most popular video to date makeup in the bible which has about two hundred ninety seven thousand views published in twenty fourteen did not address the subject of esther and the question about her use of makeup since then i have addressed this subject in my 2019 book called restoring christian modesty so this video will use the teachings from that book and if you can't afford that book please contact me i'll be happy to either email you a pdf copy or mail you a paperback copy bible proof esther did not wear makeup comparing two scriptures about esther from esther 2 verse 9 and chapter 2 verse 12 with the three scriptures about makeup in the king james version which are second kings 9 30 jeremiah 4 30 and ezekiel 23 40 we arrive at the conclusion that the context of these scriptures and the hebrew definitions of the words related to the face and face painting are speaking of different treatments esther chapter 2 verse 9 and chapter 2 verse 12 declare she was given things for purification which were oils of myrrh and sweet odors the two hebrew words for purification numbers 8562 and 4795 in the hebrew lexicon both mean rubbing or bodily rubbings so the truth is esther was most likely given moisturizing oils for topical skin care esther 2 verse 12 says she was given 6 months with oil of myrrh and 6 months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of women these two hebrew words for rubbing oils are different from the hebrew word for face paint from jeremiah 4 30. which is number 6320 in the hebrew lexicon which means antimony black paint or i cosmetic the hebrew lexicon says make up use the mineral antimony which is said to be cancer-causing according to wikipedia the true conclusion is that esther was recorded as using only oils and balsam a gum substance from trees and not minerals like metals and charcoal which is what makeup was made from again according to wikipedia i like to read a portion from my 2019 book restoring christian modesty from page 80. numerous people have erroneously told me that esther wore makeup but there is absolutely no scriptural support for this belief the bible never says esther painted her face as it says for jezebel and twice for israel in allegories scripturally esther was purified using oils not face painting esther 2 verse 9 and esther 2 verse 12 declare she was given things for purification which were oils of myrrh and sweet odors esther was most likely given moisturizing oils for topical skin care perhaps esther's lack of makeup was the distinguishing characteristic that attracted the king to her inner beauty and this thought was shared with me by a sister in the lord named joyce greeley so i want to thank her for sharing that thought with me please do not be deceived by the gross misunderstanding among churches concerning esther as scripture never states that she used makeup to paint her face do not be influenced by those who add to the words of god for they shall be found liars according to proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 we must keep god's commands and live according to proverbs 4 verse 4 let thine heart retain my words keep my commandments and live let's look at a bible timeline that may help us understand why it's likely esther did not wear makeup recall mordecai was a staunch jew who faithfully kept the word of god refusing to bow to haman as you're probably aware mordecai was esther's older cousin if mordecai was strong enough to defy the political pressure of persia and their mandate to bow down to haman surely he was grounded in moses's law and knew the necessity for israel to not imitate the heathen practices of the canaanites written some thousand years previously according to exodus 34 15 deuteronomy 31 verse 16 and verse 20 joshua 24 15 and judges 2 verse 12 to name a few so the timeline would be as follows about 930 years before mordecai around 1500 bc god commanded moses and then later joshua to abstain from the ways of the heathen and i've previously cited those scriptures then 365 years or so before mordecai around 884 bc was when jezebel wore makeup and mordecai would certainly have been aware of her wicked ways 112 years before mordecai in jeremiah's time jeremiah wrote about the evils of makeup in jeremiah 4 30 so it's likely mordecai would have known jeremiah's words as well 83 years before mordecai again in jeremiah's time around 602 bc jeremiah wrote in chapter 10 verse 2 about the evils of imitating the heathen and makeup is first recorded as being used by the egyptian heathens as jeremiah said israel must not learn the way of the heathen 74 years before mordecai in ezekiel's time around 593 bc ezekiel wrote about the evils of makeup in ezekiel 23 verse 40 so it's again likely mordecai would have known about ezekiel's words this brings us to esther's time period of becoming the persian queen around 519 or 515 bc using this timeline please consider again the probability that perhaps esther's lack of makeup was one distinguishing characteristic that attracted the king to her inner beauty make up questions and answers i thought it'd be helpful to read three questions and answers from my 2019 book about modesty found on pages 113-1-14 question 1 god bless your heart for trying to correct the body of christ but the scriptures you cited spoke to the heart of evil jezebel and the rebellion of israel what about esther who took an entire year to prepare for the king written by p.s january 2018 my answer was dear friend thank you for the respectful tone of your comment first the three scriptures i quoted on the 2014 makeup youtube video clearly identified face painting as an evil trait as god never asked anyone to face paint and all three women were under the judgment of god for their idolatry second esther never painted her face there seems to be a huge misunderstanding among churches with esther as she never used facial cosmetics she was purified using oils but not face painting esther cannot be used as an example to support makeup wearing as she was never given cosmetics esther 2 verse 9 and 2 verse 12 states she was given things for purification which were oils of myrrh and sweet odors it never says she was given makeup to paint her face now that's the end of the answer but i also had this thought too that i'd like to share with you god was very concerned about the outward appearance for example in leviticus 19 27 god taught israel and their men to not trim their beards and round off the corners of their beards because this would make them look like the heathen men that surrounded them if trimming a beard rounding the corners was enough of a change of the physical facial appearance that it might lead a person into heathen idolatry how much more would adding paint to the face lead someone into idolatry so these two examples of face painting and trimming one's beard and rounding the corners of the beard show how god went to extra lengths to help israel not to imitate the worldly sinful people and heathens that surrounded them question number two what about a lady who has defects like acne or scars from an accident or surgery what about a bad burn that can be covered with full cover foundation a little blush come on what about if it's your daughter or your wife with aging spots feeling ugly in front of you this question was from rc november 2017. my answer was thank you for the questions first i'm very happy you refrain from lipstick and other makeup second i would encourage those with scars to seek god about this topic but since we know god never changes it would seem god would give them the same answer makeup is a heathen trait that should be avoided when people see their scars the women could use them for a testimony about the grace of god for keeping them healthy or alive third we teach women and men should never wear any makeup under any condition i know that seems harsh to you but we obey based upon our love for jesus and his holy bible you said a little blush is acceptable but to me i respectfully say that your words remind me of a little leaven leavens the whole lump in first corinthians 5 6. a little bit of sin is still sin and will grow into more sin a little bit of worldliness is still worldly we must not love the world neither the things that are in the world last if my wife and daughters feel ugly due to aging spots i will reassure them that i love them unconditionally and that god's word says they are fearfully and wonderfully made in god's sight and also mine question number three god tells us to obey his commandments so obviously those are sins is wearing makeup and trousers sinful they're obviously out of order as god is an orderly god but are they truly sins or is it semantics just curious this question was from bj november 2017 answer thank you for the question crossdressing or men wearing skirts and women wearing men's pants is a sin and even more an abomination according to deuteronomy 22 verse 5 makeup is a sin as well as god told israel not to learn the ways of the heathen in jeremiah 10 verse 2. make up wearing is an expression of pride also a proud look is an abomination according to proverbs 6 verses 16 through 17 what could be more prideful than wearing a false face to impress or seduce others that was the end of my answer but let me again read proverbs 6 verses 16 and 17 and emphasize this scripture in light of makeup wearing and also rounding of the beards proverbs 6 verse 16 says these six things doth the lord hate yea seven are an abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood so without a doubt most people wear makeup to make themselves more attractive or make themselves feel more beautiful that's an expression of pride remember psalm says that you're already fearfully and wonderfully made and you do not need anything external added to your person or body than what god already gave you neither men nor women should ever wear makeup a question about one of brother branham's makeup quotes in november of 1961 brother branham said it was all right i imagine for women to add some makeup to give themselves some color this statement could not have been thus saith the lord because both previous to this statement in 1956 and 1961 and after this statement in 1963 and 1964 brother branham said the bible teaches all makeup wearing was a sin the no makeup doctrine is biblically accurate according to the verses we've already discussed second kings 9 30 jeremiah 4 30 and jeremiah 23 verse 40. makeup was a heathen trait and israel was told to not learn the ways of the heathen in jeremiah 10 verse 2 a prideful look is also an abomination let's listen to this quote from brother branham don't dye your hair something look like something you come out of this some mire somewhere don't if you're colorless and you want to make yourself look like you got some color it's all right i imagine but don't make yourself look like jezebel like a barn somewhere being painted here's two quotes from brother branham before this quote saying all make up wearing is a sin this day you got too much hollywood evangelism some little 65 guy with manicured hair set up there a bunch of women with earrings hanging down like the several steps and all that paint on their face to paint a barn and hair that used to be a sin among you holy people what happened any birth is a mess i don't care where it's at if it's in the big bin in the barnyard or if it's in a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess and the new birth is too it'll make you squall and bald wash all that paint off your face it'll do things for you that you didn't think you would do you'll [Music] and here's two quotes from after that quote in 1961 stating that all makeup wearing is a sin and notice in brother brown's vision of the bride she had no makeup on i said how can i teach them algebra when they won't even learn their abcs certainly how can you do it such a conglomeration of sin the mark of it shows anyone knows that paint is a heathen trait i'm a missionary heathens paint the indians painted their faces here in arizona before they know god do you ever know god you don't have to tell them no more about it take it off chosen at war with god when they take it all shows are at peace with god and not knowing until just a few minutes ago look like or just recently see did you notice the bride come in view twice the first seed the six both of them had exactly the same one and the reason they were dressed in different parts she'll come from all nations it'll make up the bride each one had long hair no makeup and real pretty girls and they were watching me that represented the bride coming out of all nations see each one represented the nation as they marched perfectly in line with the word friends it's difficult to say why brother branham said it was all right to wear some makeup but also condemn the wearing of any and all makeup it could have been an honest mistake or a personal sin in a weak moment all prophets outside of jesus christ were human and fall short of the glory of god and of course brother branham taught us to take every doctrine back to the bible and when you go back to the bible you never find a woman being asked by god or a man to paint their faces a word about old testament customs we can certainly use the old testament books of the bible and the law to build doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness as second timothy 3 verses 15-17 teach and that is what we're doing here on this video we're using old testament scripture to show how god has always been and always will be against makeup use it's important to know that israelis in the old testament kept customs that were not completely holy such as the custom of taking numerous wives like abraham david and solomon also the custom of accepting and wearing some type of earrings in the case of rebecca and job next the custom of a virgin wearing a veil in the presence of her espoused husband like rebecca and isaac and again the custom of requiring men to wear their beards in a certain way the holy ghost in the new testament through jesus christ saint paul and other bible authors have declared these customs as unholy and sinful or just not needed in some cases such as multiple marriages we know being married more than once with a living spouse is now called adultery in the new testament so the old testament custom of having more than one living spouse is now sinful in the new testament other old testament customs are now considered worldly such as earrings and thereby should be abstained from at all times in closing i hope this video has been a blessing to you learning about esther and how she never wore makeup all of these topics are wonderful topics and exercises and rightly dividing the word of truth here in the new testament under the leadership of the holy ghost and the holy ghost will always point us back to the word of god if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
