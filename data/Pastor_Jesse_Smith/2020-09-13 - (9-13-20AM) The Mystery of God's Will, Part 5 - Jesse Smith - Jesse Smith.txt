12 sorry about the delay let's look at verse 31 first corinthians 12 31 just one verse and then we'll go to acts 17. this is the gifts chapter and we're looking at the will of god and lord willing we'll get the gifts a little bit more this morning we looked at it a few well maybe a year ago with the purpose series let's read verse 31 together it's rita on three one two three but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show i unto you a more excellent way praise god so we're supposed to covet them but love governs all of them as we covet them uh let's go to acts 17. i don't know the verse i'll see it when i get there here so acts 17 let's look at verse 26 and 27. acts 17 26 and 27 let's read that together on three one two three and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us praise god let's have a word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's just make it known unto god by raising your hands or praising god heavenly father we love you god we're gathered in your house you've taught us uh lord through the scripture that the singing goes lord and then comes the word lord and and so father the singing has uh rejuvenated our minds and our bodies and and and raised us up in worship and and cast out all of our thoughts of anything else lord and we're fully focused on you now god and lord we ask now that your holy spirit will minister through the word and father i just pray you anoint me to speak and receive anoint your people to to receive and lord anoint us as we give our testimonies and have communion today may everything in this day glorify your great name for this is the day of the lord this is the lord's day we will rejoice and be glad in it father so we graciously we worship you we give you praise thank you for all your all your amazing grace all you've done in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you being seated praise god so i want to take a few minutes here and uh just share a few things by god's grace to kind of i like to update everybody on the ministries and everything um you can switch over to my phone lydia just for a minute here i'm just re uh rejoicing after yesterday's debate we had a really nice it was just more like a discussion rather than a debate um i want to show you i kind of flagged a few things so we just passed over a million views on the on the uh the youtube channel now we're up to about a million three thousand so after seven years brother bang we hit a million nothing's gone viral yet but at least we hit a million so let's thank the lord for that uh that just encourages me you know every now and then we'll hit one of those milestones and uh we're doing our part to get the word out i want to uh share this uh i sent brother joseph branham a uh a reply last month okay and then a week later he put this out you know he sends a weekly email to all of his followers uh and he says when now this is exactly what i wrote he said when a man preaches says you don't have to believe every word on the tapes the prophet made mistakes which i told him that he said so himself which brother branham did say he said he made mistakes and we can show them to you and i can i did all that to him there is a difference when it was god speaking through him and when his own thought or ideas and then they quote and then he uses a quote brother i'm talking about jesus christ how if anybody changes anything about jesus christ it's a seed of discrepancy so that quote doesn't even relate to brother branham that qu he is making brother branham jesus christ and i can share this website if you want so i just want to see what we're up against you know and i haven't heard back maybe i will i hope i hear back i send my email right away actually i put a comment at the bottom of this page and i'll show that to you i just want to tell you you know the same in every detail then some man is going to tell you there are mistakes and what he said there's i've told you this there's nothing wrong jesus ever said brother branham is the one who made mistakes because all men and women make you mistakes then some man is going to tell you their mistakes and what he said see even brother brandon like that's not a capital h that's a lowercase h but the power anointing of the holy spirit through him which is what we believe it takes anointed men of god to rightly divide the word of god he will tell you what is and isn't the word not to me he isn't so here is look every time i bring this to the family of brahms they always double down on it he's he's every word is thus say the lord no man is going to tell me what to do so i've tried brother baby i've tried the angel see the angel lord told his prophet get the people to believe you now we do but not every word and then he uses this which brother ram did say this in the name of jesus christ don't add one thing but he's not talking he didn't say every word on the tape he was referring to the revelations that god gave him and i showed you that whenever we preached on that remember to prove all things series remember that i don't know if the blinds were here at that point but i showed it to you brother brown was he was copying moses moses said if you change one thing add one thing you're cursed he said and brother man says so say hi in the name of jesus christ don't add one thing to the tapes he's not talking about everything on the tape he's talking about the revelations god gave him on the tapes everybody everybody knows that they should at least you just do exactly what the lord your god is see the brother says thus saith the lord in the name of jesus christ do what the lord god has commanded you to do don't add to it the word uh when god speaks the word he doesn't need any man or woman no one else to to say what that means so that's what joseph's saying see every word on the tape is thus say lord how can a preacher uh interpret that the way we do he said but they don't want uh he said but they don't want to lean on what the word says see they're making brother brahm the word they are literally making william branham the word of god he preached the word but he wasn't the word right now if you say you want to get real detailed did he have the word living inside him yeah was he a manifestation of the word yeah so are you though so i agree with that but they're making brother brandon all the word they're making them equal with jesus christ because they just use the quote the wrong way they want to lean upon what some minister says instead of what god said that's not true we are leaning on well you're leaning on what i say but it's because it's in the word of god right and no matter what church you went to that's what you would do you would as long as the minister says it's in the word that's what you lean upon right prophet told us the scriptures repeat i think he might have been done dealing with me i think i think he was dealing with me i don't know else who he could be dealing with to me uh okay and so here i just wrote a little reply at the bottom i said is that it oh yeah i just said god bless you i said i'm a pastor and joseph and i are in email contact i don't believe every word on the table thus says lord can you please ask joseph if the third person the trinity burns in his heart i said i write and i church i wrote this in godly love we kind of i laugh now but i really i'm humble with these guys and respect hoping joseph will see not every word on the tape is divine brother branham said and i listened to it this week you can listen to it if you want brother brandon said we love him that great third person of the trinity who burns through our hearts i said i hope to hear from you soon thank you [Music] still haven't heard anything that was last week that was two weeks ago see church god's word is right god will share his glory with nobody he won't share his glory with william branham with paul jesus christ gets all the glory so see and i'm so i'm battling on that side that's a it's not a hard battle church you know just i'm trying to get these people to repent and then yesterday i had three and a half hours on the debate that was really wonderful it was very well structured everything was really good um do i have any emails about that i don't know if i have any emails about that dang i still gotta get to yours buddy that was from a long time ago so i'll get to that but i've been overwhelmed yeah thank you sir i i'm gonna get to that eventually um okay so i think that was it um anything else okay you can take it off here lady i think that was all in the show um you know simon had listened to the first debate i emailed him the first part of it and he said he was he was amazed he said wow brother jesse said what a great job the lord did and he said maybe you should preach that to your church and play it to you and i might play portions of it maybe tonight or later but i wasn't planning on that if you get a chance to listen to that it was really well structured there was five questions i got to ask him five questions he would respond for five minutes and then i got three minute rebuttal and then they got three minutes after me so the person who was getting the the question got the last word on it which was okay because i know god gets the last word on everything right so i got i got the last word on his five questions but then he got the last word on my five questions and then we closed at the end with 10 minutes just to give our f we introduced ourselves for 10 minutes our introduction and then we closed with 10 minutes and i was just preaching at the end and i said i said i'm casting the net and you're not saying get the baptism the holy ghost you get get water baptist baptized in jesus christ's name as it went on i got more bold you know it was it was good but i'll tell you that i was shaking like a leaf beforehand so thanks for your prayers ever prayed for me i was right here laying on my face but they meant i'm like how can i do this you know but god was gracious to me because i have nothing i just want to like paul said i want to be set for the defense of the gospel i want to defend this message praise god and that doesn't mean everywhere on the tape the word of god on the tape and everybody knows that by now by god's grace um so let's get to the word of god i just want to look a few uh minutes here give me about 30 minutes to preach i've already gone 10 so give me 30 minutes and then i'll try to close we'll do some songs and then we'll give our testimonies praise the lord so uh wednesday let me just quickly review we looked at uh relationships uh you don't have to guess on relationships if you're in the perfect will of god or not uh the bible says you you you take it before the lord right you present your body the first thing is keep your body pure right present your body living sacrifice sacrifice everything that will keep your body from being pleasing to god and then get a transformed mind and then make your choice as far as relationships we looked at that i appreciate the nice feedback we got from that on wednesday a couple people told me they really enjoyed that message i got emails right afterwards about it people were listening around the world um just a couple with questions but that's right now the thing i want to share i think my wife mentioned it the thing i want to share again is that in the message we the brothers have to be extremely careful how they handle their power and authority and that's why many message churches have failed because men are not born again and they take all the authority over women and they abuse their wives and they abuse their children and pastors will do it and that's nothing but the spirit of satan that's the antichrist spirit you got to be careful power only shows what kind of character you got power reveals what's in your heart and so that's one thing and i use that with divorce a woman can leave her husband just if she's getting abused she can she doesn't have to stay there and be abused uh as long as it's with the lord and everything like that i don't see how the lord would ever lead a woman into being abused i don't see how that's right uh so people make all these laws in the message and not many churches but some churches you know in other words we just want to say that that god is guiding us into all truth praise god and if you have a question about marriage please let us know but we've got to really make sure as brothers as leaders that we don't abuse the power god has given to us praise the lord brothers that's all hear all the brothers say amen ready amen praise god we're the ones with the authority leadership and we have to be very uh humble by god's grace and then we looked at vocations whatever god's called you to do to work do it with all your heart we saw there's nothing more important than taking care of your children um and then uh work whatever god's called you do it with all your heart praise god because and then don't worry about being rich because godliness with contentment is great gain amen praise god and every time i told this before maybe i haven't lately but every time i've needed a job or something i just cried out to god and god answered the first time was after i graduated from college we found out my wife was pregnant we already married of course and found out my wife was pregnant and i didn't have a job i was just like fresh off a college degree i'd even go to the ceremony you know i was like i'd rather serve jesus you know no i wish i would have went i had a little picture to remember it but then the bills start coming in and my wife's working at a coffee shop pregnant and i'm not doing nothing but amen that really shook me i got on my knees and i said god i'd rat i remember i was weeping crying by my bed while my wife's at work i should have planned ahead you know got a part-time job or something anyways i cried out and said jesus i'd rather die than not provide for my wife and this baby to come little lydia and the next day i called and i begged my uh uh my former boss at the grocery store i begged him can i have a job he's like i can't give you full time he said i can give you 15 hours a week i said i'll take it and so i rejoiced i had a job uh two days later i got a call from gojo said they'll give me full time and i said glory hallelujah and uh so each time and then i was like go joe i got the call for the teaching job a few months into that and uh each and so i haven't had to get a different job since then uh so the lord has provided amen and each time and i just had another woman uh tech or email me this week she said i was there at the interview and at the interview numerous people on the staff were christians they said we knew you were a christian right when you walked in the door so it's nice after 17 years people still remember your spirit right how many know your testimonies still speaking praise god amen even after 20 15 years people will still remember the love of god in your life you have to say one thing about i didn't say one word about jesus at that interview but they knew i love jesus somehow praise god so see your life speaks way louder than anything you say praise god it's brother ram taught us now we looked at location where should you live uh this is most determined by your job of course because you have to have an income and you have to provide um but god determined your birth and uh so you would learn to seek him so god put you in a place on the earth wendy in hong kong most of us in the united states right bang's parents and laos is that right bank yeah sometimes i get those countries mixed up um uh where they were born oh van you were born in laos right okay praise god do you remember the plane right over here brother okay i'm just curious i didn't know how old you were but see god knew vang would be born there praise god and god made it a way to bring him over here praise god we read this scripture and said that god determined the bound of your habitation that you should seek the lord so god knew vang would want to believe all the truth so god made a way to send him all the way across the ocean praise god to america where he could hear the message of the hour amen praise god same thing with sister when he praise god see because god the bible said they would feel after him so it's after remember god first reaches out to every person he puts the law on their hearts and every person has a thirst for god but then god moves you in places in your life physically so you have a chance to hear the word of god amen that you might feel after him oh lord i feel you uh draw in my heart i want to draw closer to you praise god because the bible says draw nearer to god and he'll draw nigh to you praise god now of course we know he's the first mover we know he first but the bible does tell us then we must respond praise god and then find him though he be not far from every one of us amen so see god determines church your starting location you must trust him uh he'll guide all the places you'll inhabit you may never leave your region of birth sometimes i wish i could leave ohio to a warmer place i see my friends you know we saw our friends go down to florida they visited us yesterday i thought oh you lucky you lucky ducks you know now sometimes i'll be like that but you know uh everybody has a order god's gonna use there may be surprises in your life right abraham moved at least 15 times and i don't have i forgot to pull it up it's a pdf if you want it it'll i can share with you after service but it goes through abraham's journeys 15 different physical locations i love i love the first one praise god because the bible said in ezra he was worshiping idols remember matthew mclard showed us that scripture i forgot all about that one he was an idol worshiper but god said separate yourself and come and follow me and come to a land that i will show you praise god so here he was worshiping idols brother bang where's my eyes but yet then he could still hear the voice of the true god amen that's like us praise god we were steeped in idolatry but somehow god's voice still got through to us amen glory and so he moved 15 times and sometimes it was against the will of god right when it went down to egypt it was out of the perfect will of god sometimes church we will make mistakes and will go places out physically outside the will of god but if you love god if you're a child of abraham god will bring you right back in the perfect will of god amen amen he might do pretty harsh things to do it but he's going to get you there praise god he's going to get us back to the perfect will of god if we're a child of god see he was still a friend of god despite all of his moving and despite all of the maybe the uncertainty he was going out looking for a place he didn't even know where he was going yet he was still the father of faith in church that that shows us no matter how hard your situations are even physically you can still be the friend of god you can church you can still talk to him as you're picking up your boxes praise god you can still talk to him as you run the u-haul and you can still rent him and talk to him throughout all the process and still give him glory you can be his friend and i know he'll be a friend to you praise god he's faithful amen if he was abraham's friend with every move he'll be your friend as well joseph was completely shocked his world church was turned upside down in the old testament sold out from amongst his brethren at 17 years old how many are so mature at 17 that you could handle a a move a slavery right a slavery at 17 and god still blesses everything you do wow that's powerful you're just 17 and yet you can go just be totally shocked and be taken out of your element and go right into potiphar's house and everything you put your hand to is blessed praise god that's how we want to be though if god would allow something like that to happen right we want to be able to see because it's the same life right you seek god first you just take care of business it's the same life if i would move places or something would happen it's the same life we put god first jesus number one and business number two and everything else will work out for god's glory amen so his life really didn't change other than the physical surroundings because he was a he was a servant of god see it's god's purpose for his life was to save many lives and so god had to move him to save the life and and all god-directed moves will glorify god and put you in position now lot remember a lot is the great lesson he made the disastrous choice and i've warned a couple of families in this church that are no longer here but i've warned a couple of them and i said you're making decisions now i thought they were making decisions while they were going to our church that was like lot they were choosing uh to invest more in financial things and and business and they started missing more church and i told them i told the head of the home i said you're making a lot decision because lot said well i could either here or oh my there's financial gains and so brother ram said he forgot about the promised son right and the families especially men especially men unless they're led by their wife you know like ahab and jezebel especially men they have to put the word of god above everything praise god the bible said gather more as you see that day approaching i mean i've seen how many people have i seen now maybe 10 maybe more that they start really good for god but then they cut short on their church attendance and worship of god and they go after the things of the world and it's immediately felt in their family life you can see the effects in their life let's not make a lot decision let's make an abraham decision praise god physically he chose well i've got greater i've got a greater opportunity here for a financial gain yeah well then what's going to happen when you die like what you forgot what god god was in this hour god is bringing forth a promised son praise god that's what god's doing in this hour that's the don't you want to be around that praise god but they would rather be around financial success than be around the coming of abraham's seed praise god the promised son they'd rather have financial blessings than just see god's promised word come to pass we get a lot of that today in the message it's mostly men that make that decision see put your uh you got to choose to put your family among godly people and influences even if it means less money and benefits right god that's a hard thing for americans to do but church i'm a witness you put god first god will he'll eventually he'll bless you in the latter end amen praise god see and a major factor of where you live is your home church you're supposed to frequently increase your gathering with christians it's god's will for your life so you have to choose a location that allows you to fulfill this command satan loves to scatter the sheep that's what that's his main thing if he can just scatter the sheep remember paul said he i cried for three years because wolves are going to come in and devour the kill and we chop up and eat up the lambs and devour and make the lambs run make the sheep spread that's his main desire we should see church as our as our ship as our sheepfold praise god this is where we gather at nighttime amen this is where we feed all throughout the week and then we come in here and we rest with a shepherd jesus amen amen that's right but satan loves to scatter the flock jesus even remember he was even weeping or not weeping but he was he had compassion he said they're like sheep scattered without a shepherd he said pray that god will send four shepherds into the fold amen amen that was that was his prayer church jesus christ prayed that so lord your location should allow you have a pastor and a church family you regularly serve and worship with that's usually as we said up to the the man uh all decisions the man we've said brother ma'am even said it the man's not smarter than the woman that's not why he gets to make the decision it's because it's god's order i'll be the first to say my wife is smarter than me and you all know that cause i'm not very smart i'm not the sharpest tack in the sharpest nail my wife was a valedictorian i'm thankful for that y'all that's why i was one reason i wanted to marry her she was everything i wasn't real smart but uh but god places the authority with the man so the man has to learn to seek god take it take uh advice and wisdom women can have the how many know women can have the gift of wisdom and knowledge i've seen a woman cast out a devil now she later on she just made some things she wore some things i wouldn't wear or wouldn't allow a woman to wear but i've seen a woman cast out devils all those gifts are available to women so man has to take that he has to take this word of wisdom that knowledge and then he has to go to god and prayer he has to build a family altar praise god amen like abraham he's got to build it one at a time one one stone at a time one revelation at a time praise god and he's got to meet god on the uh those sands of of fellowship and and by by the stones of sacrifice he's got to meet god and he must be led by the holy spirit not led by his wife but led by the holy spirit praise god amen now and i've told you this before i made one great mistake with this and it was with a sister a lady i'll just say it because she's not here anymore but i constantly pray for her we pray for often um she was fasting about taking a job in iraq or saudi arabia sorry uh and then she was fasting she came home and got a letter saying she'd been approved to teach english in saudi arabia well she came and told me about it and i thought well you're fasting yeah and i said as long as you live stream every service yeah go over there for a year and that'd be fine and it's always something she always wanted to do well she made it over there and we prayed and cried and before she left and she made it over there and she made it through the first maybe hour of the first service on a wednesday night and then the internet connection went down and she never listened to one more sermon the rest of time she was there so i i apologize i talked to her the next a couple months later after that i apologized to her i said i should not have approved of that now she met she might have went past my advice right and still done it but the fact was i i felt that was one area where i i did it wrong i made a mistake i should not have blessed that okay and then we know things happened in her life i'm not going to get in that i know um uh so that's one area where i would say i made a mistake on that one but it taught me a lesson in church we all make mistakes right uh the thing to do though is learn from it so you don't make the mistake again right how many want to learn from their mistakes i want to learn that the next time it doesn't happen and so that's one example where when you leave the anointing of the holy spirit says always stay under the anointing amen we get the anointing every wednesday night don't we sister naomi says beatrice we get the anointing every wednesday night too right i know you know if you're live streaming you do too right you know i'm just saying like romance said always stay where the anointing is being poured out praise god amen so see when you leave the word you know you don't get the anointing you don't get the refreshing you don't get the blessing praise god so you have to stay under that uh and when you don't you you fall away you backslide uh satan traps the people okay now it's interesting you might you pray for brother cam because he and i had to talk yesterday he said i can't tell you not jesse said but i'm praying about the next uh move of my life and i said oh like i can't wait to hear about this he said but i'm reading your chapter on because i gave him a copy of this chapter he said boy he said that's a hard thing i said that's right that's hard you got to build that altar praise god i'm just thankful i'm not in it right now right i mean who wants to be in that i mean most people don't like to be in that area right between a rock and a hard place where they called her uh valley decision that's what it is yeah most people don't like i don't like it either uh so let's pray for another camera at the end of the service as well i'm gonna do it on time oh my so uh and you know i've talked to wendy about maybe moving closer but she feels led to stay there and i said that's fine i appreciate that our hearts you know go out to her and it's going to have to be for a testimony god is going to use sister wendy for testimony i believe on the day of judgment for someone that won't even drive 10 minutes to church an hour two hours and she'll still stand there at three and a half hours church now who's gonna have a who's gonna have an excuse on the day of judgment not many people so it's it's powerful if the queen of sheba did it one time and she got mentioned by jesus what about you what about you sister she did it one time now that was a long journey was it like a month brother and says a month or two i looked it up one time i can't remember how so one month all across the desert you know bring all of her sister sister wendy's come year after year after year after year so you have to pray you have to pray and find what is god's will for your life he'll show your church remember we saw it on wednesday if you ask for wisdom he'll pour it out liberally praise god he won't give you a drip by any man right he won't give us like a what do they call those eye droppers what do they call that that's what they call he's not gonna give you a little eye drop of wisdom he's gonna like pour out the whole cup he's gonna pour out the whole cup you need any more amen praise god amen amen you asked for god wisdom if you really want to do what's right he's going to pour out blessings upon you praise god abundant blessings that's the word of god the thing is people just aren't willing to wait long enough they think it has to happen in their time and just like balaam if they really want to go god knows they really want to go right so god knows so tell them first pour it out liberally um can i ask again can i go to that you fill it in god said fine go go and then he's so merciful i'll send you even a third i'll send you uh give you a second warning the angel stop in his donkey right in between that narrow path still merciful and remember he went to hell so look at this is god's grace it's god's grace it's so important where you go where you live praise god so important that you support the word of god and you do god's perfect will the first word of god amen amen god's pleading with him don't go to hell don't go down there don't curse my don't cause barrack to curse and deceive and get he's plea constantly pleading that's god's mercy praise god amen dealt with this physical location now here's one thing i want to bring up here uh i don't think i'll get the gifts because this this clock is called that's a busy body that clock is a busy body uh there's ministries church outside of preaching and outside of gifts the bible lists a few so one of them is missionary work now that kind of goes with the fivefold but you'll see what i mean like there's people you can support missionaries if you're a sister you can support a missionary right uh prayer is a ministry and providing relief for the poor and needy i just got a reminder on my phone every month it comes up send this money to this you know what is it called a community pantry whatever it is because i remember i sat down a few months ago and i asked i think asked naomi and amen and who else do you know anybody who needs food and nobody did nobody well the non-better sense i'm out to help somebody jesus said help the poor praise god and do it in a secret don't tell nobody about it i don't know if i lose my reward for tonight but i'm trying to uh i'm trying to do what jesus said praise god because that's the main thing that this believe the sign has against the message the message people don't live the word of god many of them don't many of them don't the brother was saying yesterday they left the message and only two people in a church of 800 came to see why they left or three maybe three or four that church i know everybody i know and i told this i said well the reason i don't because i was scared i didn't have any answers i said i imagine that's how a lot of people feel because i never studied those things i never studied brother brandon every single event in his life like that i didn't know the answers i could have showed him where the word was wrong you know with his women he thought these things there's women angels i could i could show them that's wrong but i couldn't i could and i didn't have the time i didn't i can't just go study things and how am i how am i supposed to preach by the way i'm going around the world seven times how am i supposed to preach that as a sermon i just i don't know how i can do that or brother and the brother man visit the graves of confucius and muhammad or not i don't or buddha i don't know he said he did they say he they have there's no proof of it well how can you prove it are you going gonna go back in time in a time machine and follow him around i said you'd have to follow him around and to really know if and then to the vatican did he go to the vatican or not they say he lied and abroad man didn't i said i believe him the only way you can prove it is either to talk to him or follow him around his entire life and you don't have any first person you don't have any first person knowledge of that so i gave him the benefit of the doubt because he pointed this bible and he made this bible real to me and that made that gave me a true relationship with jesus christ and that's what he said in the church book he said i don't write this book so you follow me or come to my church he said there's one goal that i have that's to restore a true spiritual relationship between god and man amen hallelujah that's what i used in my opening yesterday i said use that i said that's what this message done for me delivered me from all my sins and gave me a true relationship with jesus christ oh thank the lord praise god now now for anything you do seek god for any move in the in a missionary work because acts 16 6 says paul was forbidden of the holy ghost to preach in asia god may forbid you to do a ministry all missionary work is not led of the lord this is the true example i know there's quotes on that but again are you gonna exalt brother branham above jesus and that's really what people do they even though the bible says this they'll still put brother branham above jesus and the word they'll put brother branham above acts 16 6. what up that's just so awful they don't even know they're doing it sister wendy but when they say well brother man said it every time a missionary work is always that of the lord every time and yet the bible says this they've essentially made brother branham deity and they're worshiping a man amen praise god i know heaven's saying amen too hallelujah praise god i know it because it's the word and even brother branham would admit that remember he would just tell stories where the holy spirit forbid him to go to a place right i mean he even admits in his stories but he just makes quotes and says things that was his opinion at that time but in actual practice he said i only go where the holy spirit leads me praise god ah thank god for the truth amen see that's what i love because the truth is not just the bible it is but the truth is a spirit praise god and as long as i'm in contact with that spirit praise god that all the truth comes to me amen as long as i got a good fellowship with that spirit because truth is a spirit yeah on his second missionary trip god's will for paul cut him off from doing missionary work in asia minor now here's how they did it they started by praying and fasting let's go to acts 13 1-3 lydia can you pull it up there hon this is what we did before we started cam's church amen uh we had a day of prayer and fasting over at the waterloo no the mo drive church we had a day of prayer and fasting i remember because brother bart brought over some foam and that was that was concrete floors so my knees really got sore so he brought some foam pads i thought oh bless his heart you know my knees don't have to hurt now look at our look at our troubles in america you know then he forgot it so i got to use it for a little while afterwards now they were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers i like that as barnabas and simeon that was called niger and lucius of cyrene and manean which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch and saw next verse so before they did any missionary work they ministered now who ministered to god the prophets and the preachers amen you are ministering to god every time you sing buddy you keep doing it praise god amen you're ministering to god amen like we were singing that song casting crowns and so you're singing i'm back there casting crowds like give all the crimes of jesus amen give glory to jesus exalt his day give him a sacrifice of praise amen who they minister to god they're blessing god and as they fasted the holy ghost said separate me barnabas and saul for the work where unto i have called them they didn't know what god wanted to do paul didn't know he was going to go with barnabas so they had to pray and fast before and be sent out by the holy spirit so if you have a ministry you should start with that praying fast i remember i used to pray and fast before all my youtube videos now i still do that most of the time but not every time but before i started that ministry i pray and fast for everyone sometimes i go back and look at my first video i'm like oh i look like such a silly guy you know i'm kind of like scared like greetings in the name of the lord yeah so i thought i was gonna get a lot of backlash i just i'm just honest i'm just a man like you're a woman you're a man you know i thought i was gonna get attacked and fired from my job and i had all these you know i still wonder sometimes on facebook if they're gonna catch me on there just saying something i guess they just do the best we can by god's grace trust in the lord verse three oh yeah and when they fasted and prayed they laid their hands to them and sent them away praise god that's what we do with brother cam we pray we fast that day we pray with all the saints we united together we uh prayed for him anointed or ordained him as pastor i ordained him as a pastor and then they went off they had dedication services where brother brooks came and ordained him as well but that was through our church that church started through our church by god's grace and that's how you do it when you start a ministry you got to pray and fast and look for god's will brother cam says it even now he's like he didn't want to be pastor cam thought maybe another brother would be pastor but the lord put it on our hearts that he would be pastor everybody looked at him when they said who wants to be the pastor there was stephen and uh who's other preacher maybe andrew allen yeah that's right alex okay thank you uh there was so there's numerous choices but when it all went down they all took the vote to brother cam that was the right choice i love the brothers but that's right choice see when you're praying fast god will direct everything amen remember everything has to be done in god's time uh and god will make us uh prosperous now if you go can you pull up here romans 110 lydia that's my 30 that's my 40 minutes so give me five more i'll finish up here i'll be like i hadn't got started that's okay i don't want to wear you out and i don't want to wear myself out how long is your testimony now okay would you say like a minute five minutes okay all right good job uh okay maybe i got a little extra time to preach [Music] romans 110 i'm just i'm so happy today i just feel real free after yesterday i was i was three and a half hours of just you know and i was praying beforehand and fasting and my mind i just i was i had a headache all night last night because i was under such pressure and nervous you know so i feel really good today all the pressure's off now look what he says make and rate paul said i make a request to god if by any means now at length i might have a prosperous journey what by the will of god i'm only going to travel to rome if it's by the will of god and i want god to prosper my journey so i can come see you see every every visit well should i visit the church should i go visit that church you should pray about it and i'm not saying like pray every day but if something comes up pray about it well i could go to this meeting or pray right pray about it now he's a prophet of course uh now say in the same book 32 romans 15 32 please whenever you see these here see it was all depending upon the will of god we should and remember james says that do everything by the will of god we shouldn't say well i'm going to go there next year and i'm going to make so much money james said don't do that that's foolish the business might fall through he said say if it be the lord's will praise god if it be the lord's will i'll do that now uh there it is that i may come unto you with joy by the will of god so you can when you visit a place you can be real happy if you know it's god's will for you to go there if not you shouldn't do that right and may with you be refreshed so see when things fall in line with the word of god everybody gets refreshed amen the prophet the people the pastor everybody gets refreshed and we just pray about things and seek god's will for instead of our own you know some pastors lock down their churches and say you can't go you can't go this and you should always be at your opposite duty i believe you should always be at your post of duty but i believe it's free if you have the liberty the holy spirit and god's leading you go visit somebody that's fine the main thing to do is just know where your home church is because that's where you really live your true life that's where everybody knows what you really are praise god there may be there is a there's a opportunity to go and you will be refreshed i've done it when i go preach places or when i'm not preaching i get refreshed and you know it's the will of god because you pray about it beforehand amen and so we look at these scriptures and we want to stay with them see uh prayer is so crucial uh paul prayed and fasted before the trips we saw that remember acts 12 they had unceasing prayers for when paul i'm sorry when peter got in prison and god responded by sending him an angel praise god unceasing prayer so the prayer chains we talk about uh that's you can clearly see that through the scripture and now i want to go pull up first corinthians 12 8. helps there i've always had this question about helps is there a gift of helps now most denominational people they make it an extra gift i don't believe it is uh it's not one of the nine gifts of the spirit no way because paul only listed nine and nine has a good number nine fruits of the spirit remember i preached on numerology last year nine nine doesn't deal with uh you know nine was specifically right for gifts and for uh fruits of the holy spirit you can see it planing through the scripture but helps ah there it is for until one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another i'm sorry it's uh 12 28 honey i'm sorry my fault first corinthians 12 28 i'm probably talking too fast i'm too free too happy and god has some of the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles and get their healings helps governments diversities of tongues so it's a little bit confusing you know paul puts helps and governments in here what what is the gift of government you might say maybe deacons it might be but it's not one of the nine that he already listed earlier in the chapter remember the early chapter he lists all the nine gifts of the holy spirit so the word actually means if you look in the greek it means aid or relief so paul said some people are gifted to give aid and relief to other people right so i wonder who that is in our church because as we get to these gifts you know we want to i that's been that's my whole desire is that everybody will know the talents god has given to you and then just invest in them right just whatever god gave you five three or five two or one you find that talent you find that supernatural ability god gave you you know that's what the word gift means it means charisma it means it means a supernatural power brother amen it means like it's like a i don't know let me get the word here real quick uh extraordinary that's what it means an extraordinary power can you imagine that some people just have extraordinary power to pray amen hallelujah praise god some people just have extraordinary power to sense the needs of people when they need food or they need clothes it's a gift somebody some people just have an extraordinary power to give wisdom you know do this at that time do this not this do this at that time some people just have extraordinary power to pray for the sick and they recover amen there's just an extraordinary power the mother said how do you know you've got it because you can do it because you see the power operating your life now the thing where we get just discouraged no satan will discourage us it's because we want to see it more and more and more and more and more and more all the time and so we don't see it all the time we get a little discouraged i know that's how i am but it's up to god how often it happens now with helps though it helps it's not one of the official gifts but paul lays it in here with governments it's something that people have it's an ability people have to help jesus calls this almsgiving like joanna tabitha phoebe and the macedonian christians are examples of relief ministries joanna was the wife of chuza herod steward and teamed up with susannah imagine your sisters teaming up you know joanna said hey sister susanna you want to follow around the prophet of god and we'll give him food we'll feed him we'll mend his clothes you know we'll we'll get him water do you want to team up and do that and she's like yeah glory to god let's let's leave our homes behind we have a burden for a ministry we in other words we have the gift of helps now it's not one of the nine gifts but it's it's a supernatural ability uh let's read it uh luke 8 1-3 they had a supernatural guidance and leadership we want to help the preacher so jesus don't have to worry about getting food his disciples don't got to worry about going to order pizza for us that'd be for us right don't have to worry about going to chipotle and get your your meal let's have the sisters take care of that so the brothers can just deal with pray for the sick rest preach god's word amen now it came to pass afterward that they went throughout every city in the village they were constantly traveling preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god and the twelve were with him verse two and a certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene out of whom went seven devils amen and joanna the wife of jesus herod stewart and susannah and many others which ministered unto him of their substance so people that were blessed by the ministry supported the ministry praise god amen hallelujah that's what you and i should do if this ministry helps you then you get behind it with all you got praise god amen support it with all you got tabitha was full of good works and olmstein's making coats and garments for the needy i preached on that numerous time that's acts 9 36-39 she just had a burden to help the poor and god thought so much of it he raised her from the dead by peter's prayer paul urged the romans to assist phoebe in her business of securing what's sakura mean aid romans 16 1-2 i'm trying to close i really am let me get to this paragraph here we're close romans 16 1-2 and i commend you unto phoebe our sister which is a servant of the church which is at chanteria so this sister had a special burden for the church she this sister went in rome there helped this other church that was her burden and what you do verse 2 that you receive her in the lord has become a saint so that you assist her in whatever business not preaching she has need of you for she has been a secure many and of myself also secure means aid for the needy and she previously met paul's physical needs paul says please help those sisters that are making clothes feeding the preachers now you have to feed me i got god gave me a good job you know i don't need i don't need your money but i you have to feed me but you see somebody that needs you see a preacher out there that needs something help him out praise god i don't know if that'll happen but the way things are in america but how about how many want an open heart to this lord give me an open heart if there's a extraordinary ability i have to help and aid people or give someone relief then lead me to do it lord let me yield to your power that your power will work through me so i can help the church over there i can help the brother over there i can help the sister over there and this is the key uh second corinthians eight one to five now we're not going to read all that because of time second corinthians eight one to five here's the key to it you know we wonder well lord who should i help who should i help the first thing before you try to decide is give your present your body as a living sacrifice unto god in other words give your body to god first and then god will tell you to who to go help praise god now in this case this is paul calls this the collection of the poor well i'll just read it moreover brethren we do to you to wit of the grace of god bestowed upon the churches of macedonia how that in the great tribe of affliction that of the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves in other words these macedonian states were under physical persecution they were poor and persecuted but eve they they wanted to give so much to help out another church they were so burdened he said they wanted to give more than what they had but they only had a certain amount verse 4 praying with or praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministry to the saints and this they did not as we hope but here's here it is right here church how do you find who to help first he said they gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god so you've got to fir if you want to do god's will church with aid or whatever relief you got to first give yourself to god you got to lay yourself on the altar of sacrifice amen amen give yourself to god first and then god will by the will of god he'll give you to help somebody else now you can guess i mean if you want to guess and just do a ministry and just guess that i don't think it'll end good but i think it'd be outside the will of god but first give yourself to god lay in god's presence fast and pray and see where god would have you to help somebody remember it's not everybody not everybody can be helps right so this entire this harmonizes with this entire chapter on the will of god as you find god's you find god's will after you yield yourself completely to god last scripture first corinthians 16 15. first corinthians 15 16. let's let's take paul's advice and find someone within our home church who diligently serves the needy and then offer to help that family or maybe god's going to raise up one of our families to be like this family let's read look at this look at these scriptures just 15-16 i beseech you brother and you know the house of stefanus that it is the first fruits of caia and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints that you submit yourselves unto such and to and to everyone that helpeth with us and labor paul writes and tells them there's one family in the church that's really good at minutes they're really burdened i says they're good they're gifted they're really gifted at ministry and he said they have addicted themselves all they want to do is help the church of god he said so in other words go help him out church think about that if just half the churches in america preach this you've got to be addicted to serving other people i tell you a lot less teenagers would be addicted to marijuana you got licensed to be addicted to one thing serving people in the church praise god that's the only time the word addiction brother amen the word addict addiction that's the only time it's used in the entire king james version amen we must be addicted to helping other people praise god amen i know it's a different thing in laodicea i know it's different now but just look just we need to pray look around us praise god is there needs that we can help out i think one of the big just as far as time consuming one thing i could use is just somebody that likes to edit videos but i know that's a it takes a special technology gift that would save me a lot of time because i spend that's that's the thing i just wish i could put off like if there was a job i could put off on somebody i'll record the video can you edit it because that takes all the time uh because god has provided all my physical needs and i fast so fast and pray and i got all that thank god preaching we have all that but you know there's different ministries you know as uh time goes on but let's stand to our feet here let's uh pray that god will help us to be addicted to serving the saints in our church oh i had one thing on here uh you know we had to stop uh sunday school a few years ago just because we were you know worn out there's other reasons too but that's a ministry too it would take a lot of devotion you know it's not easy but that's another ministry that's a way to be addicted to serving other people you know people feel that it's you know it's all that of the lord uh malcolm why don't you come and play piano you don't have to come back because we just want to have a word of prayer here let's pray for jose's uh yeah let's pray for jose's family they're not doing good at all against covet now sometimes church we know that's fear right um it's like the box of rattlesnakes you know if the devil lies to you and tells you you got it then you get it you know spirits are not the spirits are waiting there right they're waiting to anoint people they want to anoint people the demon powers um and then they get it so i don't know the situation but we know the holy ghost is greater than than any demon and the prayer of the saints prevails above all things all human powers as long as it's god's will and i know we know it's god's will to heal 99 of the time so i'm believing it's god's will to heal jose's stepdaughter and son-in-law so let's pray together here uh i do want brother amen if you and johnny don't pray for me [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] you
