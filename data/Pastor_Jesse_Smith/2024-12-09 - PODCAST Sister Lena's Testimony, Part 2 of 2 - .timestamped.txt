[0:08] God bless you and welcome to the
[0:09] defending the message podcast I'm your
[0:12] host Pastor Jesse Smith in today's
[0:14] podcast we're the second and final part
[0:16] of our sister Lena's testimony we trust
[0:19] her first part of her testimony was a
[0:21] blessing to all the saints who were able
[0:23] to listen to it I know for me it's
[0:25] always encouraging as I go back and
[0:26] listen to the podcast when I edit the
[0:29] podcast it stir up Faith in my heart it
[0:31] reminds me of God's grace his love his
[0:34] compassion his provision so again it's a
[0:36] great reminder of the power of a
[0:38] testimony because we overcome by the
[0:41] blood of the lamb and the word of Our
[0:42] Testimony so with that let's get into
[0:45] part two of our sister Lena's
[0:52] testimony now we'd like to hear about
[0:54] our sister and her conviction to be
[0:56] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[0:58] Christ
[1:02] so when I decided to be baptized I don't
[1:05] remember too much like prior to the
[1:09] baptism I just remember Austin and I
[1:12] were talking about it
[1:14] and believe we decided together to get
[1:18] baptized
[1:19] and believe Austin just like reached out
[1:21] to brother Jesse and then set a time up
[1:25] for us to get baptized um yeah I don't
[1:29] remember too much I just know like when
[1:31] we were talking about it like I was
[1:32] really excited to do it and I
[1:35] just like I just remember being excited
[1:38] and really wanting to do it cuz at first
[1:41] I didn't really understand it too much
[1:44] until it was explained and stuff and
[1:46] then Austin was I believe Austin was
[1:48] talking to me about it and then that's
[1:51] when we went to we went to the Sheffield
[1:54] Church to use their pool inside their
[1:57] Church to get baptized and
[2:00] I was really excited and then like but
[2:02] prior to the baptism I got like really
[2:05] sick like right when we got there so
[2:07] then I was just like I won't go into
[2:08] that but then I was dealing with that
[2:11] and then like after I went and got
[2:15] baptized it's probably cuz like I was
[2:16] really nervous and then my nerves
[2:18] probably made me like really sick I get
[2:20] nervous a lot so like I was just nervous
[2:22] but yet really excited to do it and then
[2:25] finally when it was my turn to get
[2:26] baptized I just I don't know I just I
[2:28] was just happy like definitely like
[2:30] Supernatural but like it wasn't like
[2:32] anything too crazy besides like me just
[2:34] being like really excited to do it and
[2:36] just like excited for this next step in
[2:39] my life so then when it happened I was
[2:42] just like I was just really happy and I
[2:45] was just like oh praise God the water
[2:47] was I was just really cold cuz it was
[2:48] cold that night after we left but other
[2:50] than that it was just like it was just I
[2:53] don't know it was just beautiful I was
[2:54] just happy after it was done I was just
[2:56] like really excited and happy to see
[2:58] where the Lord takes me
[3:00] yeah was a very memorable night you know
[3:01] we got recordings of those and we
[3:03] watched them a couple times since then
[3:05] and the awesome thing is you know we
[3:07] went up to Sheffield and uh they were
[3:08] willing to give us warm water and uh
[3:11] meet with us I think on a Saturday night
[3:13] if I'm not mistaken and then the
[3:15] wonderful part about those Saints from
[3:16] Sheffield they're such wonderful
[3:17] Christians you know we've known them
[3:18] since 2001 and they open up their church
[3:21] and then I don't know if I told you both
[3:23] but they did follow-up calls they've
[3:24] done a couple you know three or four
[3:26] follow-up calls how is the brother and
[3:28] sister doing how's Austin are they still
[3:30] serving the lord and each time I've been
[3:33] able to say yes Hallelujah by God's
[3:35] grace they're doing great and then they
[3:37] just Rejoice so it's been a source of
[3:39] strength it's been a a great testimony
[3:41] you know that we could call upon the
[3:43] Lord and uh see two lives changed there
[3:46] and that was the outward expression of
[3:48] what had happened on the
[3:54] inside now our sister would like to
[3:56] share a testimony about a time when God
[3:59] heard a prayer and we felt the power of
[4:02] God fall on us on a Wednesday night
[4:04] service the Lord Jesus mightily answered
[4:07] our sister's request for one of her
[4:09] family members who was in a very
[4:11] desperate
[4:12] situation so there was like one night
[4:16] where I couldn't really like I couldn't
[4:19] sleep at all I was just like laying
[4:20] there tossing and turning like I it was
[4:23] just like sleepless night and then it
[4:25] was probably super early in the morning
[4:27] probably like 4 in the morning or
[4:30] something I get a call from my siblings
[4:34] in Arizona saying you know a family
[4:37] member of ours is not
[4:40] right it's just like going through
[4:42] something and not really right in the
[4:45] mind like allowing bad spirits to take
[4:49] over which led this family member to
[4:52] make some very irrational decisions
[4:56] which led to them going in my not
[5:00] knowing where she was not knowing what
[5:03] happened to her so like Austin and I are
[5:05] like really stressed and then I call my
[5:07] brother in California like we're like in
[5:09] different states so we don't know what
[5:10] we're doing so we're talking to our
[5:11] siblings and we're like okay so what are
[5:12] you guys doing about we're like they're
[5:14] just like oh you know I don't know it is
[5:17] what it is you know this person's around
[5:19] they can do what they want I'm like what
[5:21] do you mean call the cops why are we
[5:22] like not doing anything you guys are
[5:24] there with her so then that's when
[5:27] Austin and I and my brother in
[5:28] California all decided like yeah well
[5:30] we're going to have to call the cops
[5:31] just you know put out a missing person
[5:33] on her because if she's not in her right
[5:35] mind you know allowing these bad spirits
[5:37] to lead her to make these crazy
[5:40] decisions then you know we need to make
[5:43] sure like she's okay so then we called L
[5:47] have upd um so they and they put out a
[5:50] missing person report on her so like if
[5:53] someone saw her like with her car
[5:55] whatever the case may be they will call
[5:57] us and let us know like what's going on
[6:00] and like if they found her or not um so
[6:04] then Wednesday night um we came to
[6:07] church you know we let brother Jesse
[6:09] know everything that's going
[6:11] on and after service but Jesse's like
[6:16] you know we're all going to you know
[6:17] we're going to pray so like few the
[6:19] Saints stayed back inside the sanctuary
[6:21] and we're all praying okay so yeah it
[6:24] was Austin me brother Jesse and sister
[6:27] Naomi and we're all praying and you know
[6:31] during the prayer I'm like really kind
[6:33] of like doubting and it's like I don't
[6:35] know what's going to happen like it was
[6:38] a very nerve-wracking
[6:40] situation so then we're all praying and
[6:42] then sister Naomi is shouting Jesus
[6:45] Jesus Jesus and then a moment later
[6:48] Austin starts shouting Satan get out
[6:50] Satan get out and then it was just like
[6:51] a
[6:53] very emotional prayer and it was
[6:56] beautiful and the Holy Spirit was
[6:57] definitely there in the midst of it all
[6:59] you know leading us through that prayer
[7:01] and by the end of it I was feeling a bit
[7:04] like I was definitely encouraged but I
[7:06] was still like I don't I don't know what
[7:07] going to happen not necessarily doubting
[7:09] but I was just like it was like scary
[7:11] situation to be in with this family
[7:13] member um and I think I believe the
[7:17] following day we got a call from the
[7:21] police department letting us know they
[7:23] found this family member and you know
[7:26] she was admitted to the hospital and
[7:27] they're just keeping an eye on her and
[7:29] that
[7:30] she ended up being fine um she was in
[7:34] the hospital for a few days or so
[7:36] recovering and then she was able to go
[7:38] home to recover from there and the Lord
[7:43] it was all by the grace of God like the
[7:44] Lord definitely moved in that situation
[7:47] and by the grace of God this family
[7:49] member hasn't fell back into that and or
[7:52] allowed those spirits to take over her
[7:54] again so I'm definitely grateful for
[7:56] that as well it was just definitely
[7:58] beautiful beautiful testimony there yeah
[8:02] I remember that prayer that was a very
[8:03] Supernatural moment one of the most
[8:06] maybe desperate prayers you know we've
[8:08] ever prayed here at the church and it
[8:09] was amazing to see God answer the next
[8:11] day really a life was on the line I mean
[8:13] there was a lot of things we can't share
[8:15] but a life was on the line and God
[8:17] stepped in and uh it was powerful to see
[8:20] the name of Jesus called upon and then a
[8:23] rebuke against Satan because no doubt
[8:25] Satan comes to steal kill destroy Satan
[8:27] was trying to destroy that life
[8:30] but uh the spirit anointed Naomi and
[8:32] then brother Austin and called Jesus on
[8:35] the scene rebuked Satan and it was a
[8:38] very happy ending to a situation that
[8:40] was very desperate very dark and uh that
[8:43] turned into a great testimony where I
[8:46] think it was good so Austin Lena could
[8:48] see the power of God In Prayer you know
[8:50] and of course it was a great reminder to
[8:51] us I I love seeing the power of God In
[8:53] Prayer that was one of those rare
[8:55] special moments brother brand called him
[8:56] red letter days where just something
[8:58] amazing something Supernatural happens
[9:01] by the power of the Holy Spirit really
[9:03] gave us a chance to see God speaking
[9:05] right through people as they pray you
[9:07] know the Bible says if we don't know
[9:08] what to pray for the spirit of God will
[9:11] give us groanings and so there's
[9:13] groanings right Naomi's groaning um
[9:15] Austin's groaning and God shows up and
[9:18] answers the prayer so just amazing
[9:19] testimony there by the grace of God we
[9:21] still Rejoice even yet this day three
[9:23] years later you know we still Rejoice
[9:25] for what God has done his protection
[9:28] over our loved ones and and how they're
[9:30] safe to this
[9:35] day next we're going have our sister
[9:37] share about when she received the
[9:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost before I
[9:42] received the Holy
[9:44] Ghost a week prior I believe it was a
[9:47] week um I had like
[9:50] a spiritual attack from the enemy like
[9:54] never before that I can
[9:56] recall um I was laying in bed
[10:00] and I started falling asleep but out of
[10:03] nowhere I just like felt like really
[10:06] heavy something like really heavy on top
[10:08] of me like I couldn't move and then like
[10:11] the scientific term for it would be
[10:12] called sleep paralysis but I believe
[10:15] it's definitely like more spiritual and
[10:16] I definitely took it as like an attack
[10:18] from the enemy um and I'm just laying
[10:21] there and it's like I couldn't move like
[10:22] my eyes were open and I was just like it
[10:25] was just like really eerie feeling and
[10:30] I don't it was like I was scared for a
[10:32] second and then like in my head I'm just
[10:35] like I don't remember what I was praying
[10:36] but I was just like I believe I just was
[10:38] like Jesus calling out to Jesus and then
[10:40] like I was able to like move again and
[10:43] then I just like got up and I just
[10:45] started praying like I just I was
[10:47] praying I was praying you know over my
[10:49] husband cuz I was just like I don't know
[10:50] what just happened that was scary and I
[10:51] definitely felt like it was like an
[10:53] attack from the enemy and like now I
[10:55] think about it I believe it was you know
[10:58] and went to sleep I put on like some
[11:01] Christian instrumentals that way like
[11:02] that's it's going in my head as I'm
[11:04] falling back to sleep again um it was
[11:08] just like it was scary for a moment it
[11:10] wasn't like too bad of a attack cuz
[11:14] sometimes like when people get sleep
[11:15] paralysis they it goes as far as like
[11:17] seeing like act like bad spirits or
[11:20] whatever you may see but I didn't go
[11:21] that far I just felt like really heavy
[11:23] and like this really dark Eerie feeling
[11:25] but after that you know after I prayed
[11:27] it was all fine and then
[11:30] probably like the following week I don't
[11:32] know I was just like the middle of the
[11:34] day and I just like decided to pray you
[11:36] know and um I'm in my room and I'm just
[11:40] praying you know I'm calling out to
[11:42] Jesus and I just was like you know like
[11:45] asking God like you know I don't I don't
[11:48] want to be in control you know
[11:51] um like sometimes like I feel
[11:55] like I'm stuck in my ways and I just
[11:57] want to feel like feel like
[11:59] I'm in control but like I'm not like I
[12:01] have to give it to God and I'm just
[12:03] praying I'm like you know I'm repentant
[12:04] I'm like I'm sorry Lord you know I don't
[12:06] want to be in control like I can't you
[12:08] know I can't do this like I can't do
[12:10] this without you like I don't I don't
[12:12] know what I'm doing and then um you know
[12:16] I'm praying and then like out of nowhere
[12:17] like I just started I just started
[12:19] shouting Jesus like I don't I've never
[12:21] prayed like this before and I was just
[12:22] like you know Jesus screaming his name
[12:25] you know and I was just like I you know
[12:27] I can't do this alone you know and then
[12:29] like it was just like for a second I
[12:32] just I just I just like it was just like
[12:34] not for a very long time but just for a
[12:36] second I just like saw like his nail
[12:38] scared hand reach out to me just and it
[12:40] was just like for a second so I was just
[12:42] like I don't know if I actually saw that
[12:43] or like did I come up with that in my
[12:44] head so like I was really doubting a
[12:46] while after like all this happen but
[12:48] like after I got down with the pray I
[12:49] just felt I don't know I felt different
[12:52] and um I don't know I felt different I
[12:55] felt free I felt happy and I was just
[12:58] like so joyful and then um but right
[13:03] after that I was just like it was
[13:05] definitely something Supernatural that I
[13:06] was really
[13:07] doubting um for a while after twoo cuz
[13:10] I'm just like cuz I was like I think I
[13:12] got the Holy Ghost but like I don't know
[13:14] like I don't was that what that was or
[13:17] was that just like a really just like
[13:19] just a supernatural prer or was but I
[13:22] was like no I I believe I did but I was
[13:25] still doubting cuz I'm just like I don't
[13:26] know so just like for a while after I'm
[13:28] just like praying you know talking to
[13:30] God I'm just like was that it like did
[13:32] you fil me with the Holy Ghost and then
[13:36] like it didn't click till like I believe
[13:40] it was a Sunday actually like we're in
[13:43] church and then like I'm praying at my
[13:45] seat and I'm just like yeah I did and
[13:47] then like I'm just writing in my journal
[13:49] because I like to write as much as I can
[13:50] because like if I don't write it's just
[13:52] in my head and I'll go crazy so I'm just
[13:55] like
[13:56] writing and then like after I was
[13:59] praying and stuff I was like yeah I did
[14:01] get the Holy Ghost and then I was
[14:02] writing and then like when I got done
[14:04] writing that whole testimony down I was
[14:06] just like I have to give it and then
[14:09] like this is true like I I really got
[14:10] the Holy Ghost like I he really filled
[14:12] me like and it was just amazing and I
[14:15] was just so happy cuz I was like I knew
[14:17] it like you know I was doubting but like
[14:19] I KN like I knew that's what it was so
[14:22] then I wasn't even going to give it but
[14:24] I just felt led to like write it down in
[14:26] my journal and and like you know give
[14:28] the test Tony and then that Sunday
[14:30] that's when you know I gave the
[14:32] testimony to the church and that's my
[14:35] story yeah I remember that Sunday
[14:36] morning when you gave your testimony
[14:38] what a wonderful testimony uh we can all
[14:40] see your sincerity we can all see your
[14:42] love for God uh the change uh everything
[14:46] you know everything in your life is
[14:47] growing more like Christ all the time
[14:49] more faith more joy more Victory and
[14:51] what was also Supernatural was that a
[14:53] sister in the church sister Hua had two
[14:55] dreams about uh sister Lena receiving
[14:57] the Holy Ghost beforehand and so again
[14:59] we know the spirit of Jesus Christ is
[15:01] the spirit of Prophecy so those dreams
[15:03] are quite prophetic uh in nature so we
[15:06] thank the Lord for given our sister
[15:07] those dreams and then she shared them
[15:09] with sister Lena and that gave her I'm
[15:11] sure Faith and Hope and courage uh to
[15:14] keep pressing on by God's grace but it's
[15:16] awesome to see God give us dreams and
[15:18] then uh come to pass by the grace of
[15:25] God another very special important day
[15:27] was uh the day brother Austin and sister
[15:29] Lena got married so we want to share a
[15:30] few testimonies about that God did a few
[15:33] Supernatural things there as a day we
[15:35] look back on and remember what a
[15:37] wonderful day God bringing two together
[15:40] and uh we certainly saw God's blessing
[15:42] on every part of the day so we'll let
[15:44] our sister share a little bit about that
[15:46] by God's grace so yeah so our wedding
[15:49] day was act like oh it was one of the
[15:52] best days of my life next to Salvation
[15:54] of course but it was definitely a
[15:58] wonderful day and it went by so fast
[16:00] which made me
[16:03] sad um but before the actual wedding um

[19:05] oh wow yeah this is real we're actually
[19:07] getting married and it's it's amazing
[19:09] like it it's beautiful and I'm just like
[19:13] it was all L of the Lord like everything
[19:15] that
[19:16] happened L of the Lord to this day like
[19:19] the Lord definitely brought us together
[19:20] and it's just like Vindication after
[19:23] Vindication of like seeing how I know
[19:25] like we're supposed to be together cuz I
[19:27] just see it in our lives like I can see
[19:30] that the Lord was like yeah you're
[19:32] you're his rip you know so it was just
[19:34] it's
[19:35] really that just that whole day was just
[19:38] amazing it was definitely a blessing and
[19:41] it turned out beautiful and I'm just
[19:43] really grateful for it all and just like
[19:46] being married I don't know just being a
[19:48] wife to Austin is just great by the
[19:51] grace of God and just being able to see
[19:53] like what the Lord is doing in our lives
[19:56] and like where he's bringing us together
[19:59] it's just amazing
[20:01] yeah it was such a special day um you
[20:05] know Sister Lena and all the Bridesmaids
[20:07] were dressed so modestly it's one of the
[20:09] most modest weddings you know uh I've
[20:12] ever seen that was very beautifully done
[20:15] the landlord was even a blessing um
[20:18] letting us rent out the room for free I
[20:20] mean God God put that on her heart and
[20:22] she's like oh yeah of course you guys
[20:24] can use it whenever you want you know
[20:26] and then to see all the work Austin Lena
[20:27] put into the deck decorations and then
[20:29] other people came around and helped and
[20:31] all the food you know we were worried I
[20:33] know I was worried about the number of
[20:34] people and if there's enough food we had
[20:36] a ton of food and it wasn't even an
[20:38] issue and all the people that were there
[20:40] just had a a fantastic time in the
[20:43] presence of God we got to talk to some
[20:44] of Austin Lena's work friends that
[20:46] didn't know the Lord I got to tell them
[20:48] about the Lord they got to hear that
[20:50] sermon um and uh enjoy the songs and I
[20:53] think Austin did one of the most
[20:54] romantic songs I've ever seen in my life
[20:57] I was so proud of him hopefully he can
[20:59] release that song to the world at some
[21:01] point I'm going to love you for the rest
[21:03] of my life it was so inspired such a
[21:05] beautiful song I hope uh the Saints get
[21:07] to hear that by God's grace and that's
[21:09] what Austin has done he's loved Lena and
[21:11] he's going to keep doing that by God's
[21:13] grace and uh they do compliment each
[21:15] other very well just like sister Lena
[21:16] said they're perfect for one another
[21:19] with their strengths and weaknesses and
[21:21] their love for the lord it's been
[21:22] awesome to see them grow together by the
[21:25] grace of God I didn't mention this but
[21:27] like how much of a bless think it was
[21:29] with the sisters in the Church of how
[21:31] like everyone came together and like
[21:33] made sure we had food I didn't mention
[21:36] that before but like I don't know it was
[21:38] waiting on me I was like wait I forgot
[21:39] so I wanted to mention that because I
[21:41] don't know without them I don't I don't
[21:43] by the grace of God we have them and
[21:45] then like couple of your daughters
[21:47] helping us I won't say their Nam you
[21:48] know helping us get the room together
[21:50] like just like just all the sisters in
[21:53] the church came together to make sure we
[21:55] had you know a beautiful wedding so just
[21:58] wanted to mention that as well yeah it
[22:01] was a real uh work of the body of Christ
[22:04] everybody came together it was certainly
[22:06] a highlight moment to Austin Lena
[22:08] returning in
[22:10] 2021 and then we're married the next
[22:12] year in 2022 you know it was really
[22:15] phenomenal how God worked it all out we
[22:17] are all looking forward to this um just
[22:19] one of the most Happy Days of our lives
[22:22] here in the last few years so we're
[22:24] thankful that God brought you together
[22:26] and everybody played their part to make
[22:27] it a beautiful day
[22:34] also it's been really wonderful to see
[22:36] how the spirit of God has been using
[22:37] sister Lena in different ways in
[22:40] particular it seems like with the gift
[22:41] of discernment we know the word
[22:42] discernment means to judge and uh it
[22:45] means of course to judge the motive or
[22:47] objective behind a person or situation
[22:51] uh judge is the spirit of God or is it
[22:53] not and so we have a number of
[22:55] testimonies here we'd like to share with
[22:56] how the spirit of God has been anointed
[22:58] our sister and using her of course this
[23:00] would encourage anybody who's looking to
[23:01] try to find their gift or um might have
[23:04] questions about the gift of God in their
[23:06] life you know it seems like God is using
[23:08] our sister in this particular channel so
[23:10] we'll let her share some of those
[23:11] brother Austin and and I can share some
[23:13] too by God's grace first testimony I'll
[23:15] give is about sister Kristen um I just
[23:20] remember her I don't remember if she
[23:22] mentioned that she wasn't feeling well
[23:24] but I just
[23:25] remember um we're standing and singing
[23:28] it praying I don't remember which one we
[23:29] were doing I think we were singing and I
[23:33] just felt led to go and put my hand on
[23:36] her shoulder and like pray for her I
[23:39] don't know it was like the first time I
[23:40] felt that way being here so I'm just and
[23:43] then like when it first came to me I
[23:46] just ignored it and I was just like I
[23:49] don't know like I was just like I don't
[23:50] know if I should should I do it I was
[23:52] second guessing I was like I don't know
[23:53] if I should do it should I and then it
[23:56] was just like getting stronger and I was
[23:58] just like all right so then I walked to
[24:00] the back and I placed my hand on her and
[24:03] I was praying for her I don't remember
[24:05] if I asked her if I could pray for her
[24:06] or if I just started praying um but I
[24:11] prayed for her um it was just a short
[24:14] prayer just I just felt led to do it and
[24:18] then after it was
[24:20] over I just went back to my seat believe
[24:23] I went back to my seat and I think I
[24:25] gave her a hug first and then I went
[24:26] back to my seat I don't remember my
[24:27] memories is not the best but
[24:31] um yeah I went back to my seat and then
[24:35] later
[24:36] on I
[24:38] remember her telling me how it was a
[24:43] blessing and how it really helped her by
[24:47] the grace of God yeah I don't remember
[24:49] too much but that's just what I remember
[24:51] and it's all by the grace of God
[24:54] Amen that reminds us of the scripture we
[24:57] read today about uh St Paul in Acts
[24:59] chapter 18 he was pressed in his Spirit
[25:01] to do something you know to basically
[25:02] start the the church there in Corinth
[25:05] and uh stay there and Minister there for
[25:08] a year and a half so wonderful to hear
[25:10] how God pressed your spirit uh to go
[25:12] pray for my wife and uh my wife said it
[25:15] truly blessed her just what she needed
[25:17] and that was January 1st 2023 so great
[25:20] way to start the new year get somebody
[25:21] to pray for you in the hour that you
[25:23] need them to pray for you
[25:30] and I'm just going to throw in a couple
[25:31] that I know of from the uh recent
[25:36] years made it really obvious that she
[25:39] has a gift of discernment is
[25:41] um just generally a lot of times I'll be
[25:46] thinking
[25:48] something and she'll ask me a question
[25:51] pertaining to what I was thinking and
[25:53] I'm like how do she it's really crazy it
[25:55] happens all the time actually or or I'll
[25:58] uh I'll be feeling like stressed out or
[26:01] overwhelmed but I won't be showing it or
[26:03] displaying it at all to where nobody
[26:05] knows and so just sent me down hey are
[26:08] you good you know you overwhelmed and
[26:10] I'm like how do you you know and I'll
[26:11] just you know it's it's really crazy um
[26:14] and it's it's not like it shows like it
[26:16] doesn't show is where it makes it very
[26:18] Supernatural where I'm just completely
[26:20] regular but she'll come out of nowhere
[26:22] when I'm acting normal laughing happy
[26:24] and she hey I feel like you're really
[26:26] overwhelmed and I'm like what you know
[26:27] how do you you know all right just a
[26:31] example that really has no purpose she
[26:33] uh like I guess this is kind of gift to
[26:35] discernment
[26:37] but one day we were talking and she was
[26:39] like I really want to do jury duty I
[26:42] like okay yeah that sounds pretty fun
[26:43] she's like I just looks so fun and she's
[26:45] like I really want to do jury duty and
[26:46] then literally three days three days
[26:49] later in the mail she got summoned for
[26:50] jury duty it was like I I can't make
[26:53] this up man it's insane or um you know
[26:57] we're driving she's like hey you're
[26:59] you're speeding a little bit she was
[27:01] like you know there's probably a cop up
[27:04] here and I'm like nah you know my bad
[27:06] you know it's probably not but my bad
[27:08] and you know I'm always in a rush but
[27:11] literally there was a cop that just
[27:13] popped up out of nowhere I was like oh
[27:14] there's actually an officer there I'm
[27:16] like man I got to really watch my speed
[27:17] and it's nothing crazy I'm not like
[27:18] going 50 and a 25 but just like maybe
[27:20] like seven eight nine 10 over and she's
[27:22] like hey what are you doing uh so that's
[27:25] a little stuff but something major
[27:27] recently that
[27:28] happened is um God helped me open a
[27:33] business and helped Lena and I just
[27:35] really learn how to run a business and
[27:39] so it's cool he's been helping us that
[27:40] way but recently um we trained dogs and
[27:44] we got a really bad
[27:47] review on our Facebook from a lady that
[27:50] was just trying to harass us we didn't
[27:52] actually do anything bad to this lady
[27:54] but she was just trying to harass
[27:56] us and it really uh stressed me out cuz
[28:01] everybody that knows me knows I really
[28:02] care about you know my my clients like
[28:06] deeply and I really do my best for them
[28:09] um so it really stressed me out for some
[28:11] reason I thought it was the end of the
[28:13] world you know we there just because you
[28:14] can't get rid of reviews and I'm like oh
[28:16] no what if somebody reads this and it
[28:18] steers them away and they're like this
[28:19] dude's awful whole time it it wasn't a
[28:22] true one but it just stressed me out it
[28:24] kept me up all night like it was really
[28:26] bad and Lena told me that God told her
[28:30] this was going to happen um the day
[28:33] before but she didn't really tell me
[28:35] because she didn't realize it was
[28:38] discernment she just got the thought she
[28:40] was like oh okay you know she didn't
[28:41] tell me until it happened and then once
[28:42] it happened she was like freaking out
[28:44] she was like oh God told me this was
[28:46] going to happen to you and the way I
[28:48] know was a spiritual attack it just
[28:50] wasn't some person giving us a review is
[28:53] then somebody connected to
[28:56] her also left bad review so that was
[28:59] double but the profile picture on
[29:03] Facebook of this new lady that left a
[29:05] review was like if you saw the it was
[29:06] like satanic it was literally a satanic
[29:09] picture um and the lady's Facebook page
[29:13] had nothing on it it was just literally
[29:14] an empty profile with a satanic profile
[29:18] picture and um you know so Lena told me
[29:21] that God told her this was going to
[29:22] happen but it's just a trial in which
[29:25] case it did stress me out I don't feel
[29:26] like I failed the trial though it just
[29:28] stressed me out but nothing happened so
[29:30] I was just stressed out over it but with
[29:33] hindsight the um the reviews are just
[29:35] gone magically so it's cool they're just
[29:37] I mean it's not magically but you know
[29:39] they're gone when you can't get rid of
[29:41] them uh but the reviews are gone and
[29:44] everything's good all of my clients saw
[29:46] it and we had all of our clients just
[29:47] flood our Facebook with great reviews
[29:49] honest ones I mean it was for me I
[29:51] didn't even need to stress about it but
[29:53] it was crazy because Lena God told Lena
[29:56] it was going to happen or another time
[29:59] we can be talking to people or she'll
[30:02] get a thought about her sister call her
[30:05] sister and then her sister will tell her
[30:07] something bad happened before she knew
[30:10] or and and she'll just go I got to call
[30:12] my
[30:13] sister um or her mom you know or like
[30:17] really anything so it's like she'll know
[30:19] things without knowing it and that's why
[30:22] I believe she has the gift of
[30:23] discernment because it's like she
[30:25] doesn't know that it's God when it
[30:27] happens she just goes huh I have this
[30:29] strange feeling and then she actually
[30:31] listens to the feeling and then it turns
[30:33] out to be true and she had no way of
[30:36] knowing that was even going on so that's
[30:38] why I believe it's the gift so this is
[30:40] an older example but we were getting an
[30:42] apartment and it was going really good
[30:45] we're talking to the realtor or the
[30:47] management lady and me and brother Jesse
[30:50] thought it was great experience right
[30:53] and then we get home and Lena goes hey I
[30:55] think that lady is a little a little
[30:57] messed up or a little uh what's the word
[30:59] I'm looking
[31:00] for little untrustworthy I guess there's
[31:03] a better word but when you know I had no
[31:06] clue brother Jesse thought it was great
[31:09] and she's like no that lady's
[31:11] something's up with her you know and
[31:13] then um we did go to the apartment and
[31:16] there was mold in it and that's why we
[31:18] didn't get the apartment cuz that's why
[31:19] we left our last apartment but there was
[31:21] something that indicated that she was a
[31:23] little um fishy of a person which I had
[31:27] no clue I didn't pick up on and and but
[31:30] basically with hindsight we were
[31:33] proven that this lady was a little fishy
[31:36] but our whole experience with her she
[31:38] didn't display anything to me her
[31:39] brother Jesse that indicated that she
[31:42] was even the slightest bit on
[31:43] trustworthy but Lena soon as we get home
[31:46] she was like there's something up with
[31:47] that lady you know and I was like huh
[31:49] that's interesting you know so that was
[31:50] true I can't remember what it was but
[31:52] that was true so it's been M multiple
[31:55] instances where she'll just come out of
[31:57] the blue to somebody and say something
[31:59] and it was like um she had no way of
[32:02] knowing or she can read a situation and
[32:04] go hey this is false or hey they're
[32:07] lying
[32:08] or um yeah so it's just really really
[32:12] wonderful because I'll look at her in a
[32:14] situation and going hey what is what is
[32:16] this you know how do you feel about like
[32:18] I I often find myself now asking her to
[32:21] pray certain things when we need a sign
[32:24] or when we need to know an answer for
[32:26] something because
[32:28] it God's showing us time and time again
[32:31] that she has a gift of discernment so
[32:33] I'll rely on her connection with God
[32:35] because I don't believe I have the gift
[32:36] of discernment you know and it's
[32:38] supernatural so I'll sometimes rely on
[32:41] her gift and ask her certain things how
[32:43] she feels or how is classic example we
[32:47] train dogs and dogs live with us now and
[32:49] when we're gone I get anxious because
[32:50] I'm like the dogs so I'll ask her every
[32:52] day hey how are the dogs how and it
[32:55] sounds funny but seriously I look at her
[32:56] I'm like hey how are the dogs
[32:58] and she'll go no no no they're good
[33:00] they're good they're good I'm like okay
[33:01] cool or she'll be like now we should go
[33:03] check on them and then we go and check
[33:05] on them and we go in and something
[33:06] actually did happen and I'm like
[33:08] oh yeah so recently like I usually am
[33:12] anxious to get home I got to go check on
[33:13] the dogs cuz they're not our dogs and I
[33:15] want them to be safe and stuff and uh
[33:18] recently I'm like how are the dogs and
[33:20] she's like I don't know we we should
[33:22] probably go check on the we were at
[33:23] church last Sunday and she was like she
[33:26] never is wor worried about the dogs when
[33:28] we leave but this last Sunday she was
[33:31] like we should probably go home and
[33:32] check on the dogs but this time I was
[33:34] like no we're good they're good every
[33:36] time we'll be good and she was like okay
[33:38] and then we get home and we come inside
[33:41] and one of our dogs broke out of the
[33:42] crate and just roam in the house happy
[33:44] as ever man ate all my birthday um jerky
[33:49] all my birthday snacks off the table I
[33:52] walk in the house he's just bouncing
[33:54] around he did nothing wrong he's like
[33:55] hey like thanks for coming went back
[33:58] he's just all happy tail waging he
[34:00] didn't destroy anything he just ate the
[34:02] snacks off the table he was just hanging
[34:03] out nothing bad happened but he did
[34:05] break out of the crate which this never
[34:06] happened and we had to buy a new crate
[34:08] because of it cuz I'm like that can't
[34:09] happen again but yeah so the one time
[34:12] she was like we should go check on the
[34:13] dogs and I was like no we're good and
[34:16] then she was we should have listened you
[34:17] know what I mean so she doesn't know
[34:18] it's God when it happens but when she
[34:20] goes off of that leading it's always
[34:23] true it's always been true and it's you
[34:25] know so that's shown to be the um gifted
[34:28] discernment to me like I so I I'll rely
[34:30] on that gift sometimes and I'll just ask
[34:32] her things because I really trust it
[34:33] because I trust her connection to God
[34:35] not that I'm trusting in her but I just
[34:38] rely on it where that's where we kind of
[34:39] help each other out you know because I I
[34:41] I literally rely on her with some
[34:44] questions and I just go off of how she
[34:45] feels and I trusted enough that she's
[34:48] prayed up you know and she's has a good
[34:50] relationship with God that whatever
[34:52] answer she gives me I just go with it
[34:53] I'm like well okay cool I'll just I just
[34:55] trust her you know and it helps me out
[34:56] with my anxiety so it's pretty good it's
[34:59] really cool very Supernatural thing
[35:01] happening there to go into the one like
[35:04] where the dog broke out the crate prior
[35:06] to that I was putting the dog away and I
[35:08] was just like we probably should get a
[35:10] new crate this crate is like kind of
[35:12] flimsy I feel like you know it's time
[35:15] for a new one I feel like a dog can
[35:16] break out of this one and then I just
[35:17] ignored it and then I had that thought
[35:19] again I was like we should probably lock
[35:20] this crate up better I feel like
[35:21] something could happen um and then I
[35:24] just ignored it I was like H whatever
[35:26] and then literally a couple days or so
[35:28] later the dog got out and I was just
[35:30] like awesome so don't ignore it by the
[35:34] grace of God that reminds me of Hebrews
[35:37] 4:12 the word of God is quick powerful
[35:38] sharper than any two-edged sword
[35:41] piercing even to dividing a under the
[35:43] Soul and Spirit and of the joints and
[35:44] Marrow and is a discerner of the
[35:46] thoughts and intents of the heart and I
[35:48] remember back at that apartment complex
[35:52] I thought that woman was very legitimate
[35:53] I was shocked when Austin told me you
[35:55] know what you had said sister Lena but
[35:57] then yeah when we heard back from her
[35:59] something with the contract or something
[36:00] with money it was going to lock you in
[36:02] too long or there was something
[36:04] dishonest about it and then God you know
[36:06] again Vindicated how you know he's been
[36:08] speaking to Sister Lena in that way a
[36:10] very good judge of character uh judging
[36:13] the spirits Discerning the thoughts
[36:14] intents of the heart so very thankful
[36:17] for that and uh and the Bible said iron

[37:07] moved amongst his people blessed us
[37:10] protected uh guided provided for us in
[37:12] all these ways so we'll let our sister
[37:14] give her closing remarks possibly some
[37:16] advice about people that have gone
[37:18] through poverty or domestic trouble or
[37:22] gone through uh big moves in life big
[37:24] changes in life maybe been raised in in
[37:28] very unfortunate circumstances but words
[37:30] of encouragement of how God has his eye
[37:33] on you and uh God is gracious and God is
[37:36] the great Redeemer something I would you
[37:38] know say is just basically just like
[37:43] you're not alone cuz like you may feel
[37:46] alone a lot me personally I did a lot in
[37:50] that growing up that
[37:54] way
[37:56] um have
[37:58] no not feeling
[38:01] secure just like you're not alone you
[38:04] know God's God's definitely watching
[38:06] over you and he has a plan for our lives
[38:12] and I
[38:13] definitely didn't feel it at the time
[38:16] but I'm I see it now and I see that the
[38:19] Lord allows everything and he definitely
[38:22] wouldn't give us anything we cannot
[38:23] handle you know with him on our side and
[38:27] and I'm actually crazy to say but I'm
[38:30] just grateful for the life I had just
[38:35] because it just it's molded me into this
[38:38] charact this person I am today you know
[38:40] and the Lord is still shaping me into
[38:42] the person he needs me to
[38:44] be
[38:47] and just being reminded all the time
[38:50] that he's with me you know and he was
[38:53] with me you know during the toughest
[38:56] parts of my life where I felt like my
[38:59] whole world is falling apart multiple
[39:02] times and feeling not really caring
[39:06] about myself not really taking care of
[39:09] myself not caring what happened but like
[39:11] the whole
[39:12] time God was with me pulling me
[39:16] through so I I just want to remind
[39:19] everyone that just like God's with you
[39:22] even when you don't feel like it he's
[39:25] there because I wouldn't have
[39:28] got through half of the things I've
[39:30] gotten through you know without him um
[39:34] and like the darkest parts of my life
[39:37] where I just was lost he was there and I
[39:41] definitely see that so that's just what
[39:44] I wanted to say to you guys just like if
[39:48] you grew up in that way and it's also
[39:51] just like being someone who's new to the
[39:54] message you know as a sister just
[39:58] and this is something I need to practice
[39:59] more as well but just like you know it's
[40:02] okay to go to the other sisters in the
[40:05] church who's
[40:06] also you know who's been here longer who
[40:09] can help
[40:10] you get through you know the tough times
[40:15] I need to you know practice this a bit
[40:17] more too but it's okay to like rely on
[40:20] them and
[40:21] like go to them when you're feeling lost
[40:24] because they understand you know they've
[40:28] been through it they've experienced it
[40:30] longer so that's just something I would
[40:33] say to the sisters
[40:35] just
[40:37] yeah wonderful words there beautiful
[40:39] words you know I just looked in my Bible
[40:41] app and there's 11 verses that
[40:42] specifically say I am with thee God told
[40:45] that to Jacob on numerous occasions uh
[40:48] Isaiah spoke it by the Holy Ghost
[40:50] numerous times twice God spoke it
[40:52] through
[40:53] Jeremiah five times and then the Lord
[40:56] Jesus told St Paul in Acts 18:10 for I
[40:59] am with thee so such wonderful
[41:01] encouraging words from our sister thank
