everybody happy this afternoon let's praise the lord we gather together again good to see everybody everybody that's able to see on the live stream and everything we're just grateful to hear good reports of the lord giving strength to the ones that were sick and fighting their battles but you know praise the lord the lord is a healer amen and his word never fails and we're certainly thankful for his mercy and his grace to meet us where we have need amen i'm gonna sing this song uh i am resolved no longer to linger amen oh i am resolved [Applause] [Music] my [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] yes [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] maybe [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] amen he is the greatest he is the highest amen praise the lord we come to worship him [Music] getting quite a bit of feedback there but i think we'll do all right and uh you know we've come to worship the lord jesus and lift him up he's the only one that we want to give glory to and praise to he's the one that we've come to serve and he's the one we come to hear from this afternoon so we definitely don't want to hear from a man because that wouldn't do us any good anyway perhaps maybe he could benefit you a little bit in the flesh you know maybe teach you something intellectually or whatnot but if if we want to get somewhere with the lord according to the spirit it takes the holy ghost to break the word of life to us and then it takes it takes the one who spoke the word the one who is the word to bring that to us so we're certainly grateful let's all stand and uh we're gonna turn to a couple scriptures we're gonna turn to the one we read last night uh but first we're gonna go to galatians chapter 5 and then we're going to turn to hebrews chapter 5 after that now we're going to read verses 16 through 18 in galatians chapter 5 and then we'll go over to the book of hebrews and we'll read i believe it was 11 through 14 and we'll go from there by god's grace so galatians chapter 5 verses 16 through 18 says this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit you're not under the law amen praise the lord for that amen let's turn to the book of hebrews chapter 5. where we read verses 11 through 14 we read this uh last evening but the lord kind of had us go in a different direction but we'll see what the lord will have for us the wonderful thing about the word of god is it's always fresh amen it's always timely the lord has what you have need of when you have need of it he supplies our every need amen he is jehovah jireh and so verse 11 through 14 of hebrews chapter 5 of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing your dull of hearing for when the time you ought to be teachers you give need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and ever become such as have need of milk and that of strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belonging to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer lord we just thank you for your word this afternoon we thank you for giving us the opportunity lord to have the freedom to come together and worship you in spirit and in truth lord we thank you for revelation in this hour for eyes to see and here's to hear lord and in a heart that desires to serve you lord jesus and we just ask right now that you would come and break the word of life to us again this afternoon maybe just go forth lord and get glory to thy self may you just be lifted up we as we want to lift up the name of jesus christ lord we ask that you would just deliver where there needs deliverance lord heal where healing is needed and lord just edify your people by your word lord we just ask that your perfect will be done be with each and every one that is here and the ones that are listening over the the internet connection lord we just pray that you would be glorified and that your perfect will be done in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and you may be seated so as we're you know we've been kind of speaking on uh the last few services here and and it's just kind of following my lot to and uh to end up speaking all these services as it was but we'll just try to go forward and by the grace of god and know that his perfect you know trust it's his perfect will and we're just trusting in the lord anyhow because it's not about the vessel but it's about the word of the lord and we certainly we believe that word and um i guess uh reading in hebrews chapter 5 verses 11 through 14 we really want to focus on the last part of that last verse uh it says but strong meat belin belong it to them that are full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil and we've been talking about in the last few uh evenings just on the idea of that the lord jesus in this hour he wants to express himself through his people he's put within you a portion of himself by the holy ghost and his desire is to push out that expression and express himself through you we understand that there's different attributes to the lord we even we've even i'm sure you've probably i'm sure been taught here and different things understand by the word of the lord you know we talk about the stature of a perfect man and faith virtue knowledge temperance all these different things these virtues and these attributes amongst all the other things of long-suffering and gentleness and meekness and the things that are described as the fruits of the spirit that god desires to manifest through his people and but we find that so many times it seems so difficult to allow these things to to just flow out of the believer and and what we want to speak on this evening is opening the channels so we understand by the message that we've received in this hour that god had placed within each believer a seed a portion of himself that by the word of god he quickened and brought to life you recognized who you were that you were a part of this body of christ you didn't know that you were wandering around in sin we were born and sin shaped in iniquity coming to the world speaking lives we wandered around for so much time you know even if you were born under the umbrella of this word and maybe grew up in it there had to come a time where there was a recognition that without jesus christ without the blood without the holy ghost you were lost that there was that there was there was something that had to be done in your life that god had to turn around and bring to a place of life because without anything outside of that life is death we understand anything outside this word is death just as it was in the garden of eden they didn't even couldn't understand even a concept of death except the fact that the lord said the day you eat thereof that that day you'll die they maybe didn't understand it intellectually but to them there was a simple enough revelation that everything within the word of god is life and everything outside the word of god is death and we understand that truth is becoming more and more prevalent and more and more obvious as we go as we talked about in the last few evenings about that contrast of the light and the darkness and we see that contrast is just becoming greater and greater as the dark and we find as the darkness has gotten darker and darker and darker the light becomes brighter and brighter and brighter see i was actually telling brother simon i texted him and i found out that today although they call it halloween there's also another little holiday that a lot of people don't know about but it's called reformation day they said today is reformation day it's a day that commemorates when martin luther nailed those 95 theses to the wall and said the just shot lit by faith and started that breaking away and coming coming out of her by people just the beginning of that revelation that we see culminated in this hour with a with a restoration of the word and bringing back a fullness of the word so as they're out celebrating their halloween or all these satanic things that they want to do well let's celebrate the fact that this day is a commemoration of god just beginning to draw his people and bring them back out of the darkness that was the catholic church and that nicholaten system and bringing us into a freedom of the word amen so we find that as that darkness has gotten darker and darker and darker that light has become brighter and brighter and brighter what started out with luther goes on to wesley and now at this age by a prophet of william branham comes forth it brings a word and it's just gotten higher and higher and higher and it's what is it doing it's bringing us to a place as we've been speaking to where god can express himself through the bride to stand against all the darkness of the world and it's not about anything that she does in and of herself but it's the very character of god that has the power to stand against the enemy just like it was in the garden of eden we're going back to that place where the only place to be fortified behind is behind that word the only thing that held death at bay from eve and from adam but when eve was tempted with the devil coming and saying you shall not surely die the only thing that fortified her was that word that said if you would stay within this word you'll live but if you go outside that word you'll die and so we find it it's the same way in this day god is desiring to express himself through his people to his people he wants to express himself to you and then as he expresses himself to you his desire is to express himself through you to the world amen as we've been speaking about those things so as when god has come into the believer we talk about it we've talked about it like a seed and it's growing like that little plant and we're watering it and we're we're watering it and watering it and we're feeding it nutrients from the word we talked about that fertilizer and how how the fertilizer it doesn't always smell good you know those trials and tribulations we go through and different things that we go through it doesn't know it doesn't always feel good at the time but we don't understand that the trial of your faith is more precious than gold that if you hold with patience it says we'll reap if we faint not it's it's it may not be though the trials are painful for a season it yields peaceable fruit it yields righteousness it heals holiness those things that are they're on their way that plant may maybe take a long time to it seems a long time to display the fruit sometimes but don't worry even though you can't see it it's growing it's growing and it's growing but what happens is sometimes as god is desiring in you see god sealed you with the holy ghost and now is desiring to take that nature that's in you and push itself out through every part of you he wants a full surrender from his people he wants every every part of you to be completely surrendered he wants a total prisoner for jesus christ in this hour he wants complete surrender just how and we understand jesus himself expressed this in the garden of gethsemane when he even himself expressed his own desire to not suffer the cross and any reasonable logical person would think the same thing knowing what lay ahead of him say lord if there be any other way let me not endure this but what did he say those great words where he gained the victory for you and i he said nevertheless not my will but thy be done so what is it we also have the same cry lord i would so desire maybe not to suffer some of the things i've had to suffer not to go through the trials i had to go through but i say if jesus as the scripture says had to learn obedience through the things he suffered how much for us if the perfect sinless son of god had to come and suffer and and suffer these trials and tribulations and go through these problems and he was perfect how much more us imperfect god trying to build us up in that character how much will we have to go through it but we can have consolation knowing that he's already done the conquering for us so as god is desiring to push out his attributes the whole world is trying to if i can say it this way invade through all these different channels that we have trying to from the inside from the outside in god wants to push from the inside out but satan is trying from the outside to push inwards to see remember he can't stop you because once that feed is planted he says he said who's god has predestinated us to the adoption said he that god has justified he's already glorified amen he's already called you he's already chosen you so now the question is what are we doing to make ourselves available to god to clear out all the channels so that god can work because at that point it comes just as the galatians paul had asked him he says what's hindering you what's hindering you galatians chapter 5 he says he says this i say that walk in the spirit you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary ones to another so that you cannot do the things that ye would so be the desire of the christian to live completely set aside to god and yet there's this battle going on satan in all the things he puts out there even if you could separate yourself from civilization satan's gonna still be right there to drop his try to drop his little inspirations trying to put his little thoughts in there trying to work through every little channel that he can and we understand by the grace of god that there are 10 channels through the prophecy told us there's 10 different channels five into the flesh five into the spirit and then there's one channel into the soul and the five of the flesh we understand see taste feel smell in here and then to the spirit conscious memory reasoning affection imaginations and then to that soul there's only two possibilities there's faith and there's doubt and the only way in there is through your free moral agency it's for your free will you make the decision to either believe the word of god or to doubt the word of god and by the grace of god us being here this evening i trust we've all made that choice that we believe the word of god god comes and seals that in so there's nothing there's nothing to do there that's a finished work on its way so now what happens is god desiring to express through you what will happen so many times as we get gummed up in all these other channels and brother branham in the greatest battle ever fought he talks about how it's just like a little stalk of corn growing it starts out growing but if there's something there blocking it it can grow deform just how a tree if it's got like a brick or something laying near it and it's trying to grow straight that brick would push it off to the side or some stone why because there's something blocking the channel where whereby that tree can grow properly it doesn't stop the tree from growing but it does try to hinder it tries to pervert it it tries to make it less fruitful it tries to steer it from the straight path and so this evening we just want to talk about we're just going to overview a lot of these and i just trust it's a blessing to you but we just maybe go through some of these different channels so one of the very big channels that we have in this day starting with the flesh side is sight oh my doesn't the world love to work by sight how the devil everything out there it's working by sight throwing the televisions and when we finally decided we got enough sense to get the televisions out of the house he put one in your pocket right here put a television in your pocket let you access it wherever you want do whatever you want and what does he do he throws all the wickedness and different things at you but see though in matthew 6 22 the lord says the light of the body is the eye if therefore that i be single that whole body shall be full of light but if then i be evil thy whole body's body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in me be darkness how great is that darkness no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and man how important that is so much so now the lord says if if that light that goes into the eye it's darkness it says thy whole body would be darkness and that you know they have a worldly saying what they call the eyes or the window to the soul and to a certain extent that's true because we take in so many things visually and it affects you in the spirit and so many times to all the wickedness that's out there just the devil is just throwing it to us day after day after day but david said i'm not going to set any wicked thing before my eyes amen the scripture says he says to take the word of god and bind it as fretless before your eyes he says i want the word of god before me all the time every second of every day we need to keep ourselves these are one of the greatest channels that is so easy to get mixed up because as we'll see all these things that the devil is constantly bombarding and bombarding and bombarding every day you go out and you see women dressed wickedly men doing whatever they're doing nowadays you know with the piercings and the tattoos and all all these visual things that that it just wicked this put before your eyes and if we're not careful and this goes for every one of these senses that we're going to talk about if we're not careful we become desensitized to it it's just like if you look at the sun for too long all of a sudden you can't see you'll see spots or if it's just like how they talk about how deep in the ocean there's fish and animals down there that have been down there so long in the darkness that they don't even their eyes don't work anymore and if we're not careful it happens to us when our eyes we could become desensitized and this will go for all these different senses but you let that one crude thing come across your computer you let that one time happen and you say oh lord you get away from it but if you let it keep going pretty soon it starts to desensitize desensitize desensitize just anything that gets hit enough it'll desensitize it just more and more and more and the devil's not going to stop so we need to be very careful about what we're putting before our eyes the bible says it says do not turn to the left or to the right don't even look upon the scripture says about even the wine it says don't even look on the wine when it's red you know we got to be so careful because sin is going to look appealing remember that that serpent in the garden was more handsome even even than adam looked great and powerful and strong and no doubt handsome and who knows but it looked nice it looked good to the flesh but we need as we talked about in hebrews there we need to have our senses exercised to discern good and evil we need to have our senses we and what does it say it says by reason of use it means that we've been using these senses use the spiritual eyesight of the word to help you discern what's wicked and what's not and so many times we just run right over and something looks a little off you know i'm just still talking a little bit about sight but this goes for everything something looks a little off and we'll just push it to the back of our mind well no i don't want to offend or no i don't want to do this but remember what brother branham said if there's a question about it leave it alone i'd rather i'd rather offend in the natural i'd rather offended the natural but have peace with god than to try to appease the people or appease just some little temp temporary desire of the flesh and find myself wanting at the end first thessalonians 5 22 says to abstain from every appearance of evil now that's that's something to definitely talk about on a day like today like halloween where you know even even when i was growing up in the church you know it used to be most of the churches the church i went to at least didn't at least actively seem to celebrate halloween we had like what we called a harvest party or something they did something at a similar time just to get together and i think brother jesse and listening would remember those when we were at the church back there in delta how they would do little harvest parties and stuff to try to at least get the children away from that and that was certainly a noble thing because even now i see so many what we say they claim to be christians and yet would let their children go out on such an obviously demonic day at night i mean it's bad enough that they do everything at night we know that they do things under the cover of darkness because they don't want things revealed by the light you know but we're children of the day by the grace of god amen so what so we're looking we want to even stay away from every appearance of evil oh brother that sounds like it's getting to legalism no it's not about that i'm see legal see we often times as we were talking about works we need to separate works as working for the lord as opposed to trying to salvation by works see i want to live my life and do the works of god because i love him not because i think it'll save me i want to do the works of god because he's changed my life he's shown me the truth of his word and my desire is to to live that close to him to be pleasing to him so i want to abstain from the appearance of evil even if someone else might say oh well you don't need to go that far that's fine you don't have to go that far but i want to go that far so we talk about sight that's everywhere now we're visual creatures everything you go and even even in so much as like even the television programs and things that i remember and this is just my own personal i don't know there's probably scientific stuff about it too i'm sure but i even thought it affects people even in the physical and so much that they wonder why they wonder why the children they say all the children now basically all of them have adhd and all these different things well it's no wonder if you see any children's things so-called children's programs or anything it's just one thing after another and constantly moving and this and that and it's over stimulating desensitizing to the to the children so where they've been so desensitized even if they bring them into the church to hear something like this that isn't as exciting and it isn't flashing and moving and dynamic as that television program they couldn't even sit still and hear the word of god even if they wanted to because they're so used to being stimulated according to the flesh oh we need to be so careful you got to be careful what you're showing your children you got to be careful what you're showing yourself amen and just as much as that we taught we've been talking about the sisters in their dress but that's even a visual a sight representation of what the work that god's done you know so we see god can work by sight see all of these senses are good if they be lined up with the word of god amen all these things are good as long as we can line them up with the word of god so second let's talk about the feeling now this is another big one that we have because everybody wants to feel something everybody wants to have a feeling and oh i've got to have this sensation i've got to have i've got to have this this this feeling manifestation otherwise nothing happened between me and god but see if i can say it this way oh you know people say oh i wanna i wanna i wanna feel the presence of god oh that's wonderful i do too but you can't go just by feelings say oh i felt goosebumps i know the lord is here that that may be true i'm not disregarding that i've felt the presence of the lord and in that and had goosebumps i said you knew the lord was there you could feel the the solemn atmosphere of the lord and the holy spirit just moving across the people but i tell you what i've had goosebumps listening to worldly music too so if you're basing everything on your feelings oh well we got to be so careful because feelings it's such a the whole world is so it says that the that carnal man is sensual that means they live by everything that's feeling and everything that they can feel and and that's that's exactly how they're living in this day the world's gospel now is if it feels good to you that's what you should do but i tell you when you like paul said he said when i became a man i put away childish things it's a child that won't clean their room because they don't feel like it but an adult will look at a situation overcome a feeling because i don't enjoy always cleaning my room or doing the dishes or working on the house but you put away feelings and you work with what you know to be right and if we're not now don't get me wrong again as long as they line up with the words your feelings are great many times i don't feel like going to work but i go because i have a family to provide for i have a job that i need to do and sometimes your physical nature doesn't feel like going to church because you're tired and you're weary and it's uh maybe it's for i know for our brother here it's a journey to get here but you know what by the grace of god brother you guys overcome feelings you overcome weariness you overcome these things and you press forward amen why because it's a sign of maturity when a person can push aside feelings to do what they know to be right because your nature someone offends you you don't feel like loving them at that moment in the flesh it's just the truth because the flesh is enmity with god we all want to act like the devil isn't only we all want to act as if you know there's never any temptation no we know that the temptation is there someone said something to you at work that hit you the wrong way and and the devil's right there to be dropping those little wicked thoughts in there of malice and strife but the child of god can take those feelings and say devil get out of here push aside feeling and go with the word and say yeah i'm gonna have perfect love i'm going to say love overc it covers up a multitude of sins amen love will make you pray for that person you know but we got to be so careful you know the scripture says in uh second corinthians 6 17 let's just read that probably do a few scriptures this evening if that's all right were talking about seeing and that's the first thing you do before you usually touch something is you have to see it first so just like eve she saw something that she went for it so we have to be careful if the scripture says here in the second corinthians 6 verse 17 says let's just read verse 16 and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty so don't even touch it don't even touch it and if i could even go to a spiritual aspect of it you know in the old testament when they came to the mount mount sinai the lord told them said don't even approach the mountain or even touch it or you'll be thrust through with a dart and as we've been talking as we spoke yesterday about finding your place it could be very dangerous to touch something that the lord has told you don't touch it a sister's with the ministry lord the lord said i suffered not a woman to preach or serp authority in the word don't even touch it what happened to the one that that went to touch the ark when it was on the cart when they weren't supposed to see it even goes for the things of god we need to be so careful to be able to discern right from wrong to be able to discern where we're at and who we're supposed to be if someone were to come in here and try to start usurping authority over brother jesse i i pray that the lord would have mercy on that person and that's not lifting up further jesse i'm just using it as an example because we're here but but you think about a a person that would come in and try to pull that nicholaten spirit and try to usurp something and what are they doing they're trying to put their hands upon something that's not theirs don't even put your hand to it doesn't the scripture say touch not mine anointed they do my prophets no harm oh we want to put that up there in lofty place just for the prophets no that's for the people of god you are the anointed for this hour amen yeah there may be false anointed ones there's true anointed ones right here that i'm looking at there's two anointed ones that are watching on a screen right now that god has declared don't touch that anointed amen so be careful how you treat one another i better be careful the way i talk about my brother amen here because he's anointed he's been placed here by god he's a child of god and i won't touch that amen so we got to be very careful touch it's one of those things and that's what if you find what a blind man a blind man what what's one of the sim what's one of the symptoms you're going to find of a blind person how do they go through life they go through life with feelings they're trying to feel their way through oh well i can't i can't see it so i'll just see how i feel about it no thank the lord for i said that we can see amen we're not children of the darkness but we're children of the day amen even though it's gross darkness light shining in goshen right now we can see our way lord said he said if you are in the light as i am in the light that's where we need to be we need to be in the light as he is in the light amen just like the children of israel in the wilderness wherever that pillar of fire went they had to go otherwise it was going to be darkness they better be following that pill or a fire the same with us we're following those bloody footprints we're following the light of the hour as god lights the way through this dark age and we're not feeling our way as blind man so if you find that everything decisions of your life are just based on your feelings you might want to get some isaf but he's offered it in this hour isn't that right laodicea said he's he brought out the eye salve for this hour amen amen so we'll move on to the next one here well i guess i'll just give you another scripture here also in james chapter 1 verse 27. i guess let's just turn there and read it we like to read the word of god james chapter 1 and verse 27 pure religion and then defiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world what are we doing we're trying to keep our robes clean amen we have white robes the lord has clothed us in that that white raiment the righteousness of the saints what is his righteousness that he's given to us right what's the one thing about a white garment that we all know even if you just brush up against just a little brush up against something dirty you're gonna see it and many times we get a little dirty because we're brushing up a little too close with worldly things but no doubt you know there's there's portions of it we have to understand that it's a battle it's a war you know uh us different ones that have to work we go out and we rub shoulders with the world every day but just because you rub shoulders naturally doesn't mean you have to do it spiritually you have an atmosphere that you can create god has made you a little creator create that atmosphere let that holy bubble that holy bale be over you so that even if you rub shoulders with the world when you come back at the end of the day you're just white as snow you're just as clean as you were the first the day you got saved but you know what even if you know the devil tries to get something yeah you touch something spiritually you weren't supposed to touch there's a fountain that's there's a fountain opened in the house of david there's there's a there's a blood that can cleanse that amen we thank the lord for his forgiveness and his grace amen smell here's another one another smell smell is a powerful sense it's a very powerful sense you know god called the sacrifices he wants it to be a sweet smelling savor unto himself it's a it's a pleasant thing you know if you smell is one of the very first signs that you could tell if you're in a good atmosphere or a bad atmosphere you say how do you say that well i tell you what if something's rotten in the house you ever had something rotten in the fridge and you open the fridge you're going to tailbone right away because you're going to smell it there's something there's something wrong in this atmosphere there's something there's death in the camp there's death in the pot also smell has a way of attaching itself to a person i remember when i was a child my parents used to be in a bowling league way back when when they still had those i'm sure they may still have them i don't know and and that was before all the smoking bans and all these different things and i used to hate it i didn't mind the bowling part i mean just throwing pit ball at some pins but they still allow the smoking in there and all the people seem to smoke and they're just an atmosphere about it is when you got home you knew you had been to the bowling alley because that smell of smoke and that atmosphere had clung to you so many i wonder sometimes if maybe some we're maybe not a stench to god sometimes by the atmosphere that we've allowed to come around ourselves and that we allowed to live in god wants us to stay in a holy atmosphere if we look at the book of esther when before she could go into the king the scripture said she had to go six months of purification with sweet smelling odors and oils why because she had to smell a certain way when they went into the temple into the holy place into the holy of holies they had they had a very special ointment that was made of a very specific concoction a very specific bit of ingredients that smelled a certain way when they that they had to go in smelling that way there had to be an anointing about them there had to be a smell that pleased god and what is it now it's our lives it's our prayers it's our worship that we want to send up to god of a pure heart to be a sweet-smelling savor to him but if we're out there rubbing shoulders with the world and and cozying up to the things of the world that smell will get on you that smell will get on you you don't know it but it'll be on you all of a sudden you start to get that prickly nature you don't even know but people people notice your atmosphere we have to be very careful about it in the scripture the lord said that your solemn feasts and your assemblies have become a stench in my nostrils what was it what did they lost they had lost the sincerity of it they had lost the meaning of it it used to mean something but now it was just a ritual we go to church just because that's what we do and many times we have to be very careful of that because it becomes a routine we don't want anything to ever become routine about our relationship with the lord jesus we don't want it to become a stench death is definitely a big stench you know if you remember when they were getting ready at the grave of lazarus at the tomb of lazarus he said roll away the stone they said oh lord it's been four days by now he's stinking what was it they knew that a stench of death was there but what do we find is that it may have been the case they may have wrote the stone away and people passed out from the smell you ever been to a hospital there's a certain smell it's a smell of death it's that smell of that atmosphere that's there but there's there's one thing that can cure that and that's the word of god amen because jesus said i am the resurrection in the life he said your brother shall live again amen so he says lazarus come forth all of a sudden the stink's gone life comes the word is the cure the word's always the cure amen even fire and brimstone has a very particular smell doesn't it if you ever smelled you ever smelled sulfur that egg water they call it egg water that's like some of the sulfur and the different minerals that are in that water yeah you can smell that fire has a certain smell oh but i love it the three hebrew boys went into the furnace but when they came out the smell of fire wasn't even on that's how it is for the bride that's how it is for the people of god yeah you go out to the world brothers sisters they have to work you go out there into the world and you have to work and deal with all the people and their attitudes and their cursing and their their dirty jokes and their stories and all the things that they do but i tell you what you keep yourself underneath the word of god and you'll come out of that and not even the smell of it'll be on you yes lord he can do that why because he's the god that that his angels in camp about is them that fear him they'll keep that off here the only thing that happened to them was the bounds the vines were broken they were free amen let's move on i don't we probably go forever you could go so long on any one of these but we just want to do a quick overview so hearing so we understand the scripture says faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god god as we were talking about god chose the foolishness of preaching to save them that are lost why because of this scripture he said faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of god so those you hear the word and you receive we have to be careful what we're listening to what kind of music are we listening to what kind of what kind of stories and stories i could say testimonies let's put it that way testimonies are we listening to are you are you listen because everything's got a testimony everybody's got a testimony the world's got their testimony of fear and doubt and anger and frustration and absolute hopelessness are you going to listen to that testimony are you going to hear the testimony just like rahab what wasn't she it was in jericho and she said she received the spies and she said we've heard of what god did over there in egypt we heard the testimony of how god delivered and part of the red sea and has defeated every enemy along the way and what did she do she heard it and she received it but if we're not careful our ears get stopped up you ever had an ear infection i used to get them all the time when i was a child i had them so much i had to get tubes in my ears about like six times that was not pleasant but you get an ear infection you can't hear correctly you get stopped up all the fluid in your ear gets stuffed up you can't hear it gets muffled that hap you know that happens in battle a lot the concussion from the grenades and and shooting the rifles and all of a sudden they get tinnitus that ring in the ears there's a lot of soldiers sometimes we get that ringing in the ears we've been fighting for trying to serve the lord and the devil is always right there in your ear doing these things you're fighting the battles fighting the badger on the front line and it becomes harder sometimes to hear the word of god and and take it for yourself but god's got god's got healing for that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god we need to be careful because if we're not careful what if you wouldn't hear if you wouldn't hear the jubilee call and you said well i'm just content to remain they heard but they they didn't listen they didn't receive it the scripture says that the hearing of the word wasn't mixed with faith and then that heard it so we need to be careful that that this word that's being preached isn't just going as we say in one ear and out the other that that we receive it that we're receptive to the word because there's a difference between just hearing something and truly hearing or listening as we say there's a difference between hearing and listening i work in a job as an air traffic controller where that's really all i do is i'm supposed to listen and i'm talking and and that's what they tell us a lot is you a lot of times you have to be careful because when i give an aircraft an instruction i have to hear him say it back they're legally required if i give him an altitude and he's got to climb to this this altitude that he has to the pilot has to say it back to me and i have to verify that it was the right thing and if i don't catch it sometimes if you're very busy and you're busy talking talking talking and you tell this guy something and you're so busy you're thinking about the next thing you have to do and you you hear what they say but you don't really listen to it and then all of a sudden they do something you weren't expecting you say what happened and you can go back and listen to the recording and find out you told him to go to 30 000 feet you told him the right thing but he's he said oh we're gonna go to 35 000 feet and you didn't hear it well that's my fault because i didn't hear it so is it with the people of god you you say that so many are going to come on the end of the road and say lord i didn't hear this or hear that and no doubt they're going to bring up the preachers of the day and how they preach this word how they had a prophet come and preach this word and brother braden i think he even said in many places how my word my voice will echo out for eternity as a witness against them and so will your words echo out that's why it's so important that i i've posted out i want to be clear of the gift i don't want to be guilty of the blood of any i'm i'm clear of the blood of all men why because i'm not shunned to declare unto you the full gospel of jesus christ amen whether they'll hear it or not i don't know but the scripture says that having eyes to see they wouldn't see and having ears to hear they wouldn't hear so is it in this day many people say oh yeah i heard you i heard you i heard you but if you truly heard and you could accept and place it with faith then we'd see something happen now taste the last one of this natural ones i don't want to keep us too long so maybe we'll just kind of rush here a little bit we'll see what the lord has taste that's a very that's one that that's a big variety for people you know taste has so many applications when it comes to well you have a taste of what you hear people have different tastes of food people have different tastes of music some people like the more southern style and some people like the more gospel type of style of of music or whatever it is some people have their own little tastes some people you know and we have to be very careful about this because god has made each one of us unique we were talking about the other day and i said brother amen you know i like food but man blue cheese i just can't get behind that i just can't do it it tastes disgusting to me it tastes like death given personification and a cheese that's what it tastes like to me but that's my taste you see each one of us but see these are the variety and the characteristics god has made and if we're if we're before the word and we're we're honest before god he uses these things for his purpose you know not everyone preaches the same and some people have what we could say a different taste of the way they like to hear the word of god some people just have such an enjoyment for teaching they really love to go deep and don't get me wrong all the children of god love teaching but some maybe that's that's where they just oh they just really love that but some people like maybe how maybe some people don't like the way i minister uh maybe a little bit louder or some people have a taste for this or a taste for that and and you know what none of that matters that's fine whether you prefer the style of one or the other your tastes may differ but let's all agree that if it's the word of god we our spirit and our soul uh we can amen to the word of god no matter which which how it's prepared so so to speak some people like their stakes medium rare and some people like them wrong which you know in my case is anything other than medium rare you know but some people like the the different the different styles of doing it that's fine but let's just all agree we're eating the steak let's just let's just all enjoy the that nutrition that the words providing for you hey man let's just enjoy that but we got to be careful because taste can be such a thing that the enemy can use against the people of god because what happens is so all of a sudden because maybe your taste is a little bit different in the natural way we we need to come in a spiritual manner remember to put all the natural tastes aside and take a spiritual taste for the truth of god because if we're not careful we turn out to be just like the children of israel we're in the wilderness let's turn in the scripture to numbers numbers chapter 21. numbers chapter 21 verse 5. the scripture says and moses i'm sorry and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore have you brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness is there for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this light bread oh my let's turn the back also to numbers chapter 11 verses 4 through 6. just talking about the taste we need to be very careful numbers chapter 11 verses 4 through 6 and the mixed multitude that was among them fell lusting and the children of israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat we remember the fish which we did eat in egypt freely the cucumbers the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic but now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all besides this manna before our eyes oh my oh my isn't that something and then chapter 11 just go down a little bit to verse 33 it says and wow so we understand that they they complained about this manna and so god brings the quail upon the land and they start eating it says and while the flesh in chat in verse 33 was yet between their teeth aaron was chewed the wrath of the lord was kindled against the people and the lord smote the people with a very great plague so what happened if their tastes got perverted god had provided them the manna the scripture says it tasted like honey wafers i can't imagine getting tired of honey wafers even in the natural i couldn't imagine it but it's a spiritual type amen because you think about the power of what they said it's no wonder the lord would see their carcasses fell in the wilderness because they said our soul loathed this light bread and jesus christ said i am that bread that came down from heaven and they said our soul loatheth jesus christ you say oh that's too far it's not too far that's what he said he was that bread there's sustaining power it was so powerful and important that god said you take a handful of that and you put it in the ark you put it in the holy holies to be remembered forever so you can always go back and take a bite of that and be sustained amen and god's brought this word to us and if we're not careful the devil tries to pervert our tastes and say oh i'm so tired of this preaching that brother jesse's been preaching on for months oh i wish something new would come some new thing not realizing that you're just as the children of israel oh we load this light bread we watch something deeper we want something greater we want something different they told the same thing to brother branham give him spiritual gifts teach him these great things he said i'd move past that if they could get the abcs first so it isn't for us we need to be so careful but what was it it was that mixed multitude see it wasn't the children of israel were wrapped up by that mixed multitude that came with them because the scripture says it was the mix verse 4 of chapter 11 the mixed multitude fell a lasting and so what happened they got caught up into that into that atmosphere because then the mixed multitude started to lust and then the children of israel joined in with them so we got to be careful with these murmurings backbitings complainings come don't get caught up in that it'll pervert your tastes you know one of the first and it's it's it's something isn't it that one of the symptoms they said a covet 19 if you lose your taste in your smell right it's one of you and it's been like that forever even with like a cold or a flu what happens you start losing your taste in your smell food doesn't taste the way it used to you can't smell things anymore and remember we talked about even with smells smell is one of the things you can tell when the atmosphere is a little rotten you start to lose your ability to discern now the sudden you can't taste if that two week old casserole is that he could eat or not you can't smell you understand what i'm saying i know it sounds silly but these senses were used to contact the outs the world to help us discern and to understand what's going on but whatever if you find all of a sudden that your taste isn't for the word of god if you find that your life seems to stink a little bit maybe you're a little sick maybe you need a little bit of that bomb that's in gilead it doesn't mean that there's no hope for you but we need to recognize these things because they wanted it they they wanted it so badly we want these we want this meat just like we read in hebrews this meat belongs to them that are mature that have used these senses and exercise them for discernment but these children of israel they just wept all we wanted so god gave it to him and then he spanked him spanked him right away you say oh brother that couldn't happen to a believer oh sure it can because you say well all their carcasses fell in the wilderness oh but i tell you what it can happen to a believer too turn to galatians chapter two how many of you think peter was a believer holy ghost-filled yeah absolutely he was absolutely but it doesn't mean that if we're not careful these things can't affect a believer we're talking about clearing out the channels we're talking about taking all of these avenues that have a way of contacting either our flesh or our spirit and cleansing them out so much so that god can start to express himself galatians chapter 2 verses 11 through 13. now if you understand the story they're getting together at jerusalem and they had the gentiles and the and the jews kind of gathered together and there was kind of little funny feelings there because the jews were so kind of caught up in there even though they were believers they're still kind of caught up in their ways as far as the old ways of all the unclean and all these different things you know the lord was working on him but it was little by little it was a new thing you know imagine all that time it's all unclean and then the lord comes along with a vision to peter and says don't call what i've called without cleanse unclean peter opens the door and now paul is going to the gentiles and they meet at jerusalem and they're trying to get together and now all of a sudden peter sees that the jews are kind of separating themselves because it's kind of a hierarchy type of thing of oh well we're jews though you know i know you may be believers but you're gentiles still and so peter goes along with that and verse 11 it's paul's saying but when peter was come to antioch i was stood him to the face because he was to be blamed for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision so what had happened peter himself had been carried away with this kind of a fear caught up in that atmosphere of these jews that didn't want any part with the gentiles and peter wanting to appease them went along with them and paul comes and says that's not right that's not right so much so in verse 13 and the other jews dissembled likewise with them in so much that part of us also was carried away with their dissimulation we know barnabas was a man of god powerful warrior but i love it because god shows that there's no man perfect besides jesus christ amen he says but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i sent it to peter before them all if thou being the jew lives after the man or the gentiles and not as do the jews why compel us thou the gentiles to live as do the jews who are jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the words of the law shall no flesh be justified amen paul even had to correct peter so it goes to show that we need to be very careful what we're associating ourselves with what we're all these senses what are we listening to what are we hearing why because that mixed multitude started to complain and pretty soon since the children of israel started to weep about it they got caught up in it they were hearing the wrong things and because they started hearing the wrong things look at these other senses in the spirit the memory conscious reason affection but the devil he weaves them all together because what does he start to do they get carried up in this dissimulation this this this contrasting idea of all of a sudden we load this light bread this man is not good enough anymore the word's not good enough anymore we want something better and bigger and better and deeper and more what we call revelation which just turns out to be intellectualism many times and what happens now what they heard from that mixed multitude whining and complaining alters their tastes now they want something just like that now all of a sudden it satan see how he weaves his web he starts working on these senses he starts clogging up all these avenues because now they change their tastes now the man is not enough and so much now the devil starts working on their memory now egypt looks like a paradise to them where they were slaves oh we remember the leaks and the garlic that we ate freely freely first of all it's wrong on two levels you didn't get to eat all you wanted so you didn't get freely as much as you wanted and you were slaves so you were quite literally not eating it freely on every level but you see then they start to reason so see how the devil starts to work all he starts to tie it together and what does he do he starts to paint a false picture and what happens is pretty soon you're just totally blinded just like this day eyes to see a kid here ears to hear or eyes to see they can't see ears to hear but can i hear they say oh we're rich and increase with goods and know it's not that you're poor miserable wretched blind naked and what is it all those things are just symptoms of all the other ones and it's just the devil just working that thing together so we got to be very careful don't think don't think you know yeah peter was a believer but he had his struggles just like we all do praise the lord you know for the word that can come and rightly divide point us out where we're wrong give us some i sav it may not be pleasant at the time think about taste again you know medicine most of the time doesn't taste too good i remember when i was a child we used to have the robitussin it was like for when you had like a fever a flu or a cold oh my goodness still even now i almost think about it almost makes me shudder it's so disgusting and i remember just like thinking with my parents always going to give you a big dose of robitussin i'd be almost crying please i just ran just i'll just you know i'll just deal with the cold i'll just deal with the flu i don't want to take the robot i almost be crying when i was a child but what they knew would do me good the but you know the the medicine that we get doesn't always taste good but the word sure does taste good it's sweet in your mouth like honey amen let's just always be singing the songs of zion oh is that the word on our lips always a positive testimony you know they talk about you know you can all these things go and you can you see where how the truth behind so many things that we say almost in everyday life you say oh well that thing it just left a bad taste in my mouth what is it there's something wrong with it there was something off about it but that taste it's very important it's very important it helps us to discern i had another scripture here i believe if i could find it lord willing job chapter 6 30. he says is there iniquity in my tongue he says cannot my taste discern perverse things and job 12 11 says does not the ear try words and the mouth taste his meat so what is it we find out what is this this is all that discernment these senses not take it spiritually it's not just physically but you can take the spiritual aspect to all these things what kind of words are you speaking are you speaking positive words brother branham said that the man of god is always positive never negative i don't have the quote with me right now but i know that's exactly i believe that's almost exactly how he said he says the man of god he said he's always positive never negative why because regardless of what the situation is just like the shudomite is that it's all all well with thee and the child all is well that's a that's a sweet taste on the mouth that's that's a sweet and not only that that that testimony becomes a sweet savor in the in the nostrils of god he hears that testimony all things are going wrong he said yeah we're more than conquerors amen amen and that taste it helps you to discern it helps you to see the different things we'll just go through a few more here we'll just quickly go through a few of these other ones so we talk about memory going into the spirit now so we talked about see taste feel smelling here those different five natural senses that we deal with and now talking about the the spiritual so we think about memory and lord one this is probably one we'll expand on tomorrow lord if the lord allows so we won't dwell on it too long here but the scripture says i believe it was in romans it says that they did not like to retain god in their knowledge what happened they forgot god just like our nation just like the whole world really as it were now but we've seen in our nation even in the last you know i i can only speak for my lifetime because you know growing up and everything but even in my lifetime just the the direction of this nation as far as even an attitude towards god they not now they wouldn't even not even claim god at all to be even amongst the people let alone anything that they would be proud of or or desire to stand with they don't even want to have god in their knowledge anymore we want to erase it from history oh my peter says in second peter chapter 3 verses 1 and 2 he says i want to stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance that you mean mindful of the words that were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment by the apostles of the lord and savior so what is it god wants you to always have these things in your memory always have these things in your mind this paul said he said whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are holy and virtuous and true he said think on these things keep these things in your memory but what does the devil do he uses the opposite side he always brings back all your failures he's always bringing back all your struggles amen we won't go that too into that too deep now but and then conscience conscience that's another one that the devil see and as you start as we go through some of these senses i hope you understand how the devil uses and tries to weave all these things together they just one right on top of the other see because that memory comes in and the devil's bringing up these memories and all of a sudden now your conscience oh now i can't live with the good conscience before god because of all these things what happens you've forgotten that you were purged from your old sins all of a sudden you're your sight and what does that do your spiritual sight starts to get filmed over all these things work together that's why we need to open up these channels clear them mouth by the word of god and let god work through them so that they're clear that there's no no hindrance to the people of god amen acts chapter 24 let's turn there i hope this is okay we'll close here in just a minute the book of acts chapter 24 [Music] verses 14 to 16. paul says but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship by the god of my fathers believing all things that are written in the law and in the prophets and have hope toward god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense toward god and toward men amen i love that that's what god that's what god wants for his people is to have a conscience void of offense toward god first and then towards men so many we reverse that so many times we'd we'd rather be clear of men and just oh i don't want to offend anybody no i'd rather offend men all day because even the lord said offenses shall surely come they're coming but i'd rather offend man all day but have my conscience clear before god amen then to have my oh well i didn't offend anybody and meanwhile the lord says yeah but she didn't stand for my word have a backbone instead of a wishbone amen hebrews hebrews 10 verse 2. i'll turn there real quick let's go through a few scriptures here as we get ready close and we'll start at verse 1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshiper once purged should not have should have had no more conscience of sins and so is it with the believer god by the sprinkling of that atonement the blood of jesus christ has purged your conscience from sins you don't have to be weighed down by a conscience that's not clear before god because you have faith in the sacrifice that he gave but the devil's always on the other side pointing you not to calvary but to your failures he's always there to bring with that memory bring back your failures and so try to to make that conscience not before god perfect anymore because all of a sudden you start to lack that sight again you start to not be able to hear the word the way it ought to be that you've been purged from those sins that the scripture said their sins and iniquities i will remember no more but the devil's right there remember this then you've got this problem and you have this struggle and that problem and this failure but don't let your conscience weigh you down you say i've uh yes that may be true i had these struggles but i've put it underneath the blood i've gone before my lord i've asked for the forgiveness of sins and he said he's faithful and just to forgive me amen but if we're not careful that conscience is well is there what is it it's the holy ghost to prick you when something's wrong if we've got if you've gotten to the point where you you've overpowered the sight or we've overpowered the smell allowed yourself to get into a place where sin is even at the door it's right there and you put yourself in that situation you've ran over those senses and there's that conscience there there to prick you still trying to to nudge you in the right direction of the spirit and say there's something wrong take the lord for a supernatural sense a holy ghost that can prick that conscience but if we're not careful just like all these other senses could be desensitized your conscience you start barreling over that conscience too many times you'll do it too many times and pretty soon you get your conscience seared with a hot iron all of a sudden oh it doesn't doesn't my conscience is not affected by by drinking oh it doesn't it doesn't hurt me you know to watch those wicked movies not even think all my faith is i have enough faith i can do it oh i'm sure you do now because your conscience was seared first timothy 4 1-2 let's just read that i enjoy reading the scriptures first timothy 4 verses 1 through 2 says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shadows of art from the faith giving heat to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies and hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron and that's speaking about even preaching of the word and lies what is it the word has been right there to prick the conscience no that's not right that trinity that trinity doctrine is not right that baptism doctrine is not right but they just keep preaching it and they just keep speaking it and pretty soon they just run over that conscience enough you know it's just like all these things can become desensitized you think about you think about even in the natural you ever been on a on like a tractor or like a go card or something that has a lot of vibration to it and you're holding onto that steering wheel and by the time you're done you can't even feel your hands anymore what happened your hands became desensitized to that stimulation you ever been around to smell so much that you don't smell it anymore it's a scientific name it's called olfactory fatigue it's where you're smelling sense it smelled it so much that it just kind of shuts it off and it's we got to be so careful that we don't desensitize ourselves to wicked things by allowing these things to to stay may we just recognize and pull out the sword and go to chopping get on our knees and pray that the lord will help us to clear out all these channels affections just the last couple here and we'll just we'll just go really quickly and wrap up i don't want to keep us too long affections matthew 6 19-21 lay night up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust do doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also amen amen galatians 5 24-26 and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts so remember as we spoke in that first scripture how the flesh is lusting against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and their contrary so there's affections that come from this flesh and there's affections that come from the holy ghost in the believer that are at war with one another and so what are we to do we're here to give our affections under the things of god crucify all the fl the affections of the the flesh all the lust of the flesh all those things that are pulling on the flesh crucify that die daily amen and then we'll just kind of go over this to reasoning we know reasoning obviously is such a big one in this age from from the very time you're born now it's just reasoning reasoning and science and and we understand from the very garden of eden that's what was gotten was reasoning you shall not surely die you see satan gets us with reasoning so much and that ties in to every other sense that there is and the devil we've been speaking about the whole time how he works on both sides you think about how how god how god could do something for a person you you need a healing in your life you need you need let's just use healing as an example i was talking with the brother there in texas and we were talking about this and it just it strikes me because that devil he's tricky and he's he's definitely wise he knows how to do it how to try to trick people but we're not ignorant of satan's devices we're not ignorant to his tricks but what does he do the whole time you may need a healing and you're praying and you're believing and the devil's right there god can't do it god can't do it god can't do it and then god does it and then he's right on the other side to say well god didn't do that it was the medicine or you never really had that problem to begin with well which one is the devil it's either it was there and god can't heal it or it was never there god didn't heal it you see how that devil works with that reasoning and he's always right there to jump into that reasoning and and i was thinking i was thinking about this today and i it struck me in a way i never i've never seen it before how so many times we equate that reasoning like with the garden of eden of things that we shouldn't do right of of says don't touch it don't even look at it neither should you touch it should at least you die and satan says ye shall not surely die so what does he do he reasons her away from something that she ought not to do that she does but reverse that how often does reasoning from the devil take us away from the things that we ought to do think about the sister we spoke of yesterday in brother braham's meeting how the devil worked with reasoning where the lord put it on her heart to pray for the baby and the devil tried to risen her away from doing the will of god how often does that happen in our lives oh i shouldn't go witness to this person because of this and this and this and this because my life is this and i've struggled with that and and i've said this before and i've done this and what does it do you start your reason away from the actual work god wants you to do we look at it on the negative so many times or we reason ourselves into doing something we shouldn't do but what about the times where satan gets us away from the things that we ought to do how so many out there that maybe have been witness to about the baptism in the name of jesus christ but they reason themselves out of doing the will of god how the even think of the children of israel at cadence barnea how they were told go possess the land typing the holy ghost and and satan put the reasoning into the heart of the spies oh it's too great we can't do it and reason them right out of the promised land and reason them to not do what god had called them to do we've got to be careful that that reasoning doesn't keep us from fulfilling the word of god amen from doing the things that god promised because we're always make a reason satan's only if you want a reason satan will give you a reason he'll give you a reason to do something that god doesn't want you to do and he'll give you a reason to not do something god does want you to do he's just full of it he's got all the reasons available he's got a he's got a whole oh board a whole book full of reasons he can give you so we need to cast down that reasoning get it out of your mind the only reasoning that matters is the word and then imagination the scripture says that that the imagination of man's heart was only evil continually i believe it was in the days of noah look at the day we're living is that not the way they come up with things that you don't even understand how they can come up with them what is it it's an imagination it's a it's a it's a it's a desire to do something but you know we think of imaginations and we think it's an evil thing but god can use it for good see we call it imagination but i think another word you could use for it would be inspiration when god inspires a child of god to write a song or something like that or god gives an inspiration for a sermon or god gives an inspiration to to build or do something for the lord that's an imagination that's that's an inspiration in the mind of the believer we talked about david david had an imagination and it is mine because what is they call the imagination like your mind's eye the way you the way you can see something in your mind you can come up with ideas and concepts and and something you want to do and david caught the mind of god god had a godly imagination said i want to build that temple was it wasn't an ungodly imagination because that temple was built that house was built it just wasn't for him to do but he had caught what was it that was a godly imagination we put that imagination thing so many times on the bad side it almost becomes a bad word but it's true that the evil if you let the flesh imagination rule you you'll come up with just about anything against the word of god against god i think i wrote down another couple scriptures here forgive me i know my notes sometimes get a little a little uh off with writing things down but maybe we didn't write it down that's okay romans chapter one forgive me if i've kept you too long we'll just we'll be wrapping up here just a second by god's grace and like i said any one of these you could probably just preach sermons and sermons on any one but we'll just kind of give you an overview we're talking about clearing out the channels all of these things if you find if you find that one of these things are clogged up maybe you find that the the devil lately has just gotten you with that conscience there's just something in there that the devil the devil's trying to latch some past sin or something that you've struggled with that the devil is just right there to try to drag you down god's got the answer for that it's the word it's the word of god it's faith in that word is that repentance and and a clear conscience before god that he can give you but we don't rely upon what we can do in and of ourselves we're relying upon the truth that lays within the word of god and what he said about the situation romans chapter 1 verse 21 it says because that when they knew not god when because because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and change the glory of the uncorruptable god into an image made like to corruptable man into birds into four-footed beasts and creeping things and so what do we find they've got vain imaginations vain it doesn't even it doesn't profit anything they just come up with whatever they want to we find that's the way it is in this day they're just all over the place you can find people just coming up with all kinds of wickedness and filth and everything else but if we can get into the spirit of god we find that god has got a wellspring of godly imagination for his people whatsoever things are pure and whatsoever things are holy and what whatsoever things are good we think on these things we allow the inspiration of god to to draw us and to bring out we we we're glorify god when we hear some of the wonderful songs that god's inspired to different ones that they've given that inspiration to and and to even like you see different paintings and and things see satan's seeking all these things that we see and perverted them music and art and all these different things but god has a perfect perfect version of it he's got a holy version of it if we could if we could use it for that so really in the end i guess just to close is you see we battle so much with these senses but let's turn one last scripture here as we close in first john chapter 5 all these things you know are just bombarding bombarding bombarding every day the different things of the world that you see the smells that you have to deal with all the the stinky lives that are out there if we can put it that way the the different atmospheres that you're in the things that you have to you gotta rub shoulders with the world because you got to go shopping or you got to go to work and you have certain things that we have to do in this life the things that you have to hear all the wickedness that's out there you know all these different senses that that we have that the devil is just trying to stop them all up and gum them up but god by his grace wants to show himself through you and we got to clear out those channels john chapter 5 verse 4 and what we do is right here for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god amen so what is it in the end what's gonna what's gonna clear out the channels if that's the victory it's faith in the word of god faith faith will overcome every one of these senses faith will cause your hearing to bring the word of god to fruition in your life faith will give you a holy site to look upon the things of god and to ignore the things of the world and and to see the depth of his word faith will make your life a sweet smelling savor before god and cause your atmosphere to be a sweet atmosphere to be a holy atmosphere to be something that's pleasant to be around faith will cause your tastes to be for the word of god we know that the sermon brother branham preached on a thinking man's filter for a holy man's taste faith will cause your taste to be for the things of god it'll you'll enjoy that manna when it comes you won't consider it light bread you won't loathe the word of god it'll be it'll be sweet in your mouth faith will cause you to to feel real love for your brother and when feeling in the flesh isn't there faith will overcome those feelings and cause you to love them anyhow and cause you to pray for them and to care for them faith will will overcome the memories that satan tries to bring up and cause you to remember the word of god faith will help your conscience to to be sensitive to the holy ghost and be able to take the the the moving of the spirit to move away from wickedness and into righteousness and then also to not be weighed down in your conscience of things that that that you've struggled with or had faults or failures faith will cause you in your imaginations to be inspired of god to imagine instead of a imagination of oh man man what could i have said that would have just zinged that person because they said something wrong to me no maybe your imagination will be go oh man what could i do for brother vang next time i see him god's a godly imagination a god of imagination will be like oh my what what what food could could i cook for my husband when he comes home that that would make him happy what what for the what what could i do for my children that would do something that would just excite them and make my children happy what what could i do you know for my pastor to make him feel appreciated or or the pastor to say what can i do for the people to help maybe have him have some fellowship that's a godly imagination to have what can i do for the kingdom of god faith will cause that faith will cause you to overcome all the reasonings of why god can't do something and say it doesn't matter why he could why it doesn't look like it could happen because the word said it would happen faith will cause you to overcome the reasoning when satan says oh you can't pray for that person because you're just a low down person who had this struggle or that problem and say i don't care the scripture says if we lay hands on the sick they shall recover faith will say i put that under the blood and i'm going to walk forward in confidence in the blood of jesus christ amen faith will overcome all of those senses faith will push out so we got we don't let the world gum it up with all these natural versions of it but faith will go through like a like a shotgun a holy ghost shotgun and just blast it all out it'll scrub it all out the fire of the holy ghost will go and fire up all those channels cleanse them all out and let the flus be unstuck and let the holy ghost come flowing out of your life faith will do it it's that simple oh it seems so it seems maybe so far away sometimes but it's just simple faith in the word of god faith faith will allow the lord to sever you from all the affections of the world faith will let the lord come in and separate your separate you so that your only affection is unto him and to his people faith will make it so that your your love is for the lord jesus and his bride and his people faith can overcome all that it seems really simple but how many of us have found maybe more than one time or another we've had some of those channels blocked up [Music] i'll raise my hand i know i have but by the grace of god the word never fails the word faith in the word of god will allow you not to to overcome so you don't become desensitized to all these things we don't want to become desensitized we don't want to become blinded we don't want to have that ringing in our ears from the battles that we've had we want to be we want to be able to hear that still small voice and be ready to go we want to be able to see every little bit of the word we want to be able to to to feel his presence when he does come and you know what if we don't feel faith we'll say it doesn't matter what my feelings say it's what the word says anyhow remember if it's like if all these senses are fine if they line up with the word and if they're not you take faith and you blast that thing out of there and say it doesn't matter what that sense tells me hey man let's just all stand i hope that's okay let's all stand let's clear out the channels let's get before the lord in prayer let's sing unto the lord songs of zion and and have that righteous a good atmosphere keep those things before you that'll allow those senses to be cleared up [Music] you know if you get into a foggy atmosphere if you get into a a nasty atmosphere you won't be able to see you don't be able to sense what's going on you won't be able to but we want to stay in a clear atmosphere we want to be that like that eagle we want to be way up high where our vision's clear there's no clouds obstructing our view we're not worried about what we feel the unseen force the unseen power of the holy ghost is set on our wings and we're just flying high amen let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord i just thank you for your love and your mercy to your people oh god in your faithfulness thank you o god knowing that lord the victory that overcomes the world is is our faith oh god and lord we don't even live by our own faith but we live by the faith of the son of god who loved us and died for us lord and we're trusting in that right now god to overcome all the senses all these senses that we deal with every day and the different things that we fight and in all these different things father but lord you're more than able to overcome all these things father you overcame them for us we just asked right now that you would bless your people lord may they just go forward lord and as we go to our different places may just keep each and every one bless those that are out listening over the the internet connection lord and we just ask the lord god that your
