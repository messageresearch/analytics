TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 5 jewelry makeup tattoos and high heels includes footnotes numbers 237-315 i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well psalm 139 verse 14. in addition to modest clothing and hair length four other areas of your outward appearance should be examined according to the bible this chapter will expound on the bible's witnesses about the following accessories for your outward appearance jewelry makeup tattoos and high heels christian liberties with the proper understanding of our christian liberties you can be sure you are walking in the faith and strengthening other believers faith at the same time christian liberties can be defined as carnal earthly actions that are not sins but also do not make us more spiritual in other words god gives us freedom of choice and we can either allow actions or disallow them god does not give us freedom of choice in regards to make up tattoos and high heels for each is contrary to scripture however there is some freedom of choice with certain types of jewelry whether we allow or disallow liberties our hearts must offer thanksgiving unto our lord jesus christ if you have any doubt that an action is not pleasing to god and cannot give god thanks during the action you must abstain from it whatever is not done in faith is sin there are times that christians should not display their liberties in public but keep them private between themselves and god alone when deciding whether or not to act upon a liberty loving your neighbor should be your greatest concern the bible commands us to choose actions that please others rather than ourselves as jesus christ modeled for us some texts that deal with christian liberties are romans 14 verses 1 to 23 first corinthians 8 verses 1 to 13 and first corinthians 10 verses 14 through 33 in these texts the specific examples of christian liberties include foods observing holy days and wine first the food we eat is an area of christian liberty as some may choose to eat meat while others may eat only herbs or vegetables in paul's time the eating of meat was an issue as believers in corinth would find themselves in public and private settings where meat would be offered them to eat if those serving the meat to the christians expressed that the meat was offered in a sacrifice to idols the apostles urged believers to be aware that other weaker believers may be watching them and thus it would be wise to refrain from eating the meat due to its connection to idolatry the experienced believer knew that eating meat sacrificed to an idol would not have any impact upon his faith for he could ignore the idolatry and give thanks to christ for the food but the weaker believer may be impacted by fear of the meat's connection to idolatry the lesson is that we should not choose an action that will cause a weaker believer to stumble into sin even if the action does not make us sin next observing holy days are days that christians separate as more important days than others paul stressed that no matter if a day is considered holy every day should be a day to be thankful for some christians might observe jewish feast days or keep the sabbath but the apostle made it clear that these observances were shadows of things to come and not the ultimate meaning which was christ the lesson is to respect others convictions and be thankful that they are worshiping jesus christ last drinking wine is an area of christian liberty according to paul as a guideline christians should abstain from all public and private alcohol consumption except in church communion services and for genuine medicinal needs the major concern with wine as with me offered to idols is that we don't cause others to stumble into sin paul wrote that christians may be offered to drink wine in public or in someone's home and would then have to be very cautious about who was watching them drink wine paul teaches that any drink that has alcoholic content should be not consumed by a christian in a public setting for the protection of the consciences of weaker christians who may see a christian drinking wine and then go get drunk eventually becoming apostate to christianity due to drunkenness recall that drunkards will not inherit the kingdom of god the conclusion is that wine should not be drank in public except during a church communion service the public use of wine was different in the days of christ than it is today wine drank in public would either have been watered down or drank in very small amounts over long periods of time in order to avoid drunkenness as evidenced in jesus's first miracle jesus was god in flesh and god's unchanging standard condemns drunkenness from both testaments jesus would not do a miracle that would lead people to committing the sin of drunkenness therefore either the wine was watered down or the portions of wine that would be drunk at a long wedding reception were very small jesus miracle of turning water into wine was a legitimate miracle as the hand of god created the best quality of wine for the latter part of the wedding reception yet we know god would not be pleased with the reception filled with drunks for his word condemns drunkenness today public usage of wine is not as moderate as the days of christ often celebrations such as receptions and new year's parties result in much drunkenness with very little moderation therefore a christian should refrain from drinking in these public venues that his liberty not become a stumbling block to weaker christians who are watching his actions furthermore wine has become a major money making industry in the united states and it seems that wine tasting has taken on a hobby mentality people taste wine in public settings simply for the fun of intoxication and socialization some may use the excuse of needing to drink wine in order to be at peace while socializing but christians should look to christ who is our peace christians should abstain from this frivolity as we are called to be intoxicated with the holy ghost and not natural wine or strong drink wine can be used in other ways it is noteworthy that paul recommended that timothy use a little wine for his stomach's sake and often infirmities wine can then be used as a medicine in certain cases but great efforts should be made to limit the use in order to avoid a habitual consumption that could lead to addiction while christians should not judge each other about the liberties that they allow we must judge ourselves that we are not causing others to stumble and fall into sin paul is clear that a weak christian can spiritually perish with a defiled conscience through the bad influence of another christian who took his liberty too far and did not consider how his actions would affect another christian in these cases the christian who took his liberty too far not only sinned against the weak christian but also sinned against christ because of this great responsibility that christians have to lead godly lives in front of other christians paul took the attitude that he would not eat meat as long as the world was standing in order that he would not cause another christian to fall into sin each of us must have the same attitude we will abstain from any pleasurable christian liberty for the rest of our lives if we know it may cause the stumbling of weaker christians jewelry while the three examples of liberties above are clearly defined food observing holy days and wine a case can be made for other areas of liberty wearing jewelry seems to be a liberty because the bible provides examples of godly people wearing jewelry ungodly people also wear jewelry so jewelry wearing is not one-sided the bible contains numerous references to jewelry and it is clear that wearing certain types of inexpensive jewelry in moderation is acceptable to our lord four guidelines ensure a believer's jewelry wearing honors god spending little time on jewelry avoiding expensive jewelry wearing few pieces of jewelry and wearing jewelry with a godly message first a christian must spend little time adorning herself with jewelry more emphasis must be placed on her inward adorning than the outward as paul pleaded that women adorn themselves in shame-facedness and sobriety rather than costly array of gold and pearls shamefaciness is not a word we use much today but it means to have a sense of honor and bashfulness reverence and regard for others similarly sobriety means self-control the context of paul's teachings about modest adorning show that women must exhibit self-control on everything they wear our christian sisters must be adorned with an attitude of honor and regard for others especially a regard for men who are often tempted through the lust of the eyes second paul and peter teach that expensive jewelry should be avoided what is valuable in the sight of god and of a great price for christian women is a meek quiet and submissive attitude flaunting wealth is ultimately fleeting prideful and vain in the light of eternity third the amount of jewry worn should be minimal paul teaches sobriety meaning self-control in the greek the haughty prideful daughters of zion lacked sobriety and wore 21 different outward accessories ranging from feet ornaments to bonnets for their heads god assured those women that all their attempts to look beautiful would backfire and their end would be a burning destruction and desolation additionally along with the amount of jewelry worn christians should practice moderation in all things fourth jury must carry a godly message any jewelry with wicked devilish symbols worldly images or foul language does not please god and thus should be avoided at all times whatever we do say or where should glorify our lord and savior jesus christ and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him scripture verifies the types of jewry god accepts rings necklaces and bracelets rings christians can wear some rings that are acceptable unto god the biblical pattern for acceptable rings is that they have a meaningful purpose such as in the cases of mordecai joseph and the prodigal son these rings all symbolized authority and were used in sealing official documents mordecai received a signet ring from king ahasuerus when he was given the power and authority of haman's former position joseph son of jacob was given a ring to wear when he was exalted to second in command in egypt even our lord jesus's parable of the prodigal son included a ring being placed upon his finger once he was restored to his family today christians are most likely to wear wedding rings to symbolize their unending vows of marital faithfulness to their spouse wedding rings can be condemned in certain christian circles but there is no scriptural evidence for this idea although scriptures don't specifically support wedding rings the wearing of wedding rings is not forbidden since godly men wore rings with a purpose wedding rings can be categorized as an area of christian liberty because of their purpose as long as they are not excessive or ostentatious nose rings nose rings are becoming more commonplace in american culture the question is are nose rings acceptable according to the bible the answer is no for a couple of reasons first nose rings pierced through the skin and shed blood and the unchanging god never commanded his people to wear jewelry that shed blood left permanent marks on their skin or damage their body in any way the bodies of christians are likened to a holy temple and thus must be treated with reverence and not purposely damaged your body is not your own you are a temple of the holy ghost our god delights in our obedience to honor the bodies he has graciously created god does not teach us to pierce our bodies cause ourselves to bleed or leave permanent marks on our bodies no new testament teaching permits believers to damage their bodies in any way second we do not have two or three witnesses that prove godly people wore nose rings nose jewels are alluded to in only one scripture isaiah 3 verse 21 as mentioned previously this is a negative example of nose jewels because the prideful seductive daughters of zion whose end was destruction and desolation were adorned in 21 different accessories god was not pleased with their vain outward accessories some think genesis 24 47 supports nose rings but we have very little information about this event abraham's servant put an earring upon rebecca's face at the time of her engagement to isaac but god has never asked his obedient people to pierce and permanently scar their bodies putting an earring upon her face was likely accustomed for her engagement this one isolated ambiguous scripture is not evidence for nose rings because the rest of the bible never teaches anyone to wear them necklaces the bible offers support for the wearing of necklaces in moderation joseph and solomon's bride wore necklaces as representations of their authority necklaces were also used symbolically to represent the reward of obedience if children faithfully obey the instructions and laws of their parents the grace of god would be as a chain about their necks therefore necklaces can be categorized as an area of christian liberty as long as they follow the four guidelines listed above bracelets bracelets may be worn in moderation as they were worn by rebecca upon her engagement to isaac god himself in an allegory of his rescuing and adorning of israel put bracelets upon the hands of his bride bracelets are an area of christian liberty as long as they follow the four guidelines listed above earrings earrings should be avoided at all times because the negative witnesses in scripture greatly outweigh the positive out of the 11 biblical texts about earrings seven passages describe their usage in negative terms conversely two scriptural portions use earrings allegorically in positive terms the final two reference earrings in ambiguous terms additionally modern day earrings require piercing bleeding and scarring of the body which god never ordained for his obedient people in genesis 35 verses 1 to 4 god commanded jacob to return to bethel and build an altar of worship knowing this jacob commanded that his family bury all their idols and earrings under an oak tree in shechem it seems jacob's family had to bury all idols that they worshipped which included false idols and the fashion of wearing earrings before appearing before the living god at the house of god a second negative witness is the israelite's use of earrings after the exodus out of egypt in the absence of moses the backslidden idolatrous israelites broke off their earrings at the command of aaron in order to build the golden calf which god abhorred israel received these earrings from the egyptians during the exodus god's purpose though was not for israel to wear the earrings but to use them to help build the tabernacle in the wilderness later in their exodus journey their armies obtained earrings as spoils of war and they dedicated them to the tabernacle of the lord as an oblation and memorial earrings never became a part of their daily lives a third negative witness involved gideon's interactions with the ishmaelites in judges 8 verses 22 through 27. the ishmaelites possess golden earrings but not israel rather than rule over the ishmaelites gideon requested and received their earrings and formed an ephod that later became an object of idolatry in israel isaiah and hosea record a fourth and fifth negative witness about earrings in both contexts god's two prophets recorded that earrings were a hindrance to women as a source of pride and lustful seduction likewise some women today still use earrings as a tool of pride and seduction exodus 21 verse 6 and deuteronomy 15 verse 17 provide the sixth and seventh negative witnesses about earrings in these texts you can read about earrings called alls in the king james version alls were permanent earrings given to jewish slaves who purposely rejected freedom and wanted to remain slaves forever the purpose behind the all was to leave a permanent mark on the ears of the jewish slaves so that their choice to be a slave for life would be instantly seen by all these slaves ultimately rejected their god-given inheritance which included the land of their forefathers alls were visible signs of the judgment of god upon unbelieving faithless israelites imagine you lived in the days of moses and saw slaves with awls in their ears the permanent visible alls immediately identified who was enslaved the free israelites would not have worn similar earrings to those of the slaves for god is always distinguished between holy and unholy god is not the author of confusion he ordered every part of jewish life their outer garments and hair length reveal their gender their ears reveal their choice of freedom or slavery the biblical pattern for earrings then shows that jewish slaves and heathens used piercings god's people may have possessed earrings as customary engagement gifts for currency or barter but not for everyday wear christians should not have their ears pierced because piercing does not fit the unchanging character of god use the honor your body guideline no piercing our bodies no deliberately causing ourselves to bleed and no leaving permanent marks on our bodies no new testament teaching allows christians to break the honor your body guideline proverbs 25 verse 12 and ezekiel 16 verse 12 give two positive allegorical witnesses for earrings proverbs describes a golden earring as representing a wise judge speaking to an obedient listener with the emphasis on the value of hearing wise counsel not on outward adornment in ezekiel god himself said he adorned israel with earrings which represent israel's obedience to god's wise counsel both of these examples are allegorical and not literal in contrast to the seven literal examples of earrings being described in a negative way two other portions of scripture are ambiguous about the use of earrings rebecca's engagement and job's restoration both rebecca and job were given earrings as gifts but we are not told what they did with them it seems rebecca's earrings were given to her as part of an engagement custom and not as an everyday accessory moreover consider that her relatives in the next generation jacob's family were commanded to bury their earrings before presenting themselves before god in his provided place of worship bethel the idea of earrings as an engagement gift and not an everyday accessory also connects back to god's adorning of his engaged spouse israel job received an earring from each of his friends after god restored his health and family in job 42 verse 11. we cannot presume that god wanted job to walk around daily wearing multiple earrings especially since we know the haughty daughters of zion wore 21 different accessories that manifested their prideful lustful hearts furthermore we know god is more interested in the inward adornment than the outward this story of job provides more support that earrings were used by the followers of god as gifts of custom and perhaps for currency and barter rather than for everyday wear makeup not in one scripture does god command any woman or man to wear makeup or paint their face in any way if god wanted his daughters to wear makeup or paint as the king james version describes it he would have told them to do so in his word god's nature and his simple humble design for the physical appearance align his focus is on the inner man while outward beauty is vain god wants us to present our clean natural faces to others because god created our faces and said our entire bodies were fearfully and wonderfully made even marvelous according to the psalmist no makeup can improve or make more beautiful the face that god already created for each of us for thou hast possessed my reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth write well these scriptures help women overcome all feelings of insufficiency women don't have to hide behind makeup because christ assures their identity is found in him makeup is a superficial and false covering that god did not intend to be added to his creation it's a shame that advertisers in hollywood have convinced millions that the faces god made for them are not good enough the truth is that your face is best just the way god made it and you can rejoice in the true face god gave you we shouldn't desire a false appearance since the bible says that charity or love rejoices in the truth love doesn't rejoice in a false superficial covering but it does rejoice in a true natural appearance three scriptures teach jewish and christian women to abstain from wearing makeup second kings 9 30 jeremiah 4 verse 30 and ezekiel 23 verse 40. the entire rest of the bible can be added to this list because no scriptures command any woman whether godly or ungodly to paint her face or wear any facial cosmetic jezebel wife of ahab painted her face in second kings 9 verse 30. she was likely the most evil woman in the entire bible she murdered god's faithful prophets and by usurping her husband's authority greedily ordered the murder of an innocent man named naboth jezebel devoutly worshiped idols such as baal and practiced whoredoms and witchcraft jezebel is the only woman recorded in the bible as painting her face as the other two examples of women painting their faces were nations depicted as immoral women out of over 440 references to the face in the bible only jezebel is named as the one who used facial cosmetics jezebel an idol worshiper was a heathen in the sight of god who commanded israel to learn not the ways of the heathen at the end of her life jezebel's response to the news of jehu's coming was to paint her face in rebellion to the god of israel which led to her swift judgment without a doubt face painting facial cosmetics and makeup are linked to heathenism and idolatry according to jezebel's behavior in the bible and history itself which chapter 6 covers what may come as a surprise is that jesus prophesied that the same spirit of jezebel would return and seduce christians in the new testament dispensation we must be cautious of women in the christian church who act like jezebel by usurping authority over men silencing the voices of true preachers acting greedily and seducing followers into idolatry and even painting their faces with makeup through a simple study of famous modern televangelists we can quickly find examples of women who preach wear makeup emphasize money and prosperity and allow their followers to participate in sinful idolatrous indulgences if you currently follow a woman with a jezebel spirit repent and cry out to god for his leadership in finding a true church that possesses the spirit of god when the spirit of elijah found himself threatened by the wicked jezebel he ran into the wilderness was fed by god and was made aware of the seven thousand other believers who had not bowed down to the jezebel religion if you see god crying out to him he will lead you to other believers who want to worship christ in spirit and in truth the next scriptural witness jeremiah 4 verse 30 shows god speaking through the prophet jeremiah to all of israel around 600 bc the lord gave the following message to israel at the time of one of the punishments for committing wickedness and rebellion against him and when thou art spoiled what will thou do though thou closeth thyself with crimson though thou decast thee with ornaments of gold though thou rentest thy face with painting in vain shalt thou make thyself fair thy lovers will despise thee they will seek thy life this scripture shows that it is vanity to wear expensive clothing and use makeup peter presents a similar message in the new testament saying a woman's inner beauty and spiritual dormant of a meek and quiet spirit is a great value in god's sight jeremiah 4 is a picture of god issuing a sentence of destruction upon judah and jerusalem through horsemen and bowmen though not a final destruction israel is being punished for their evil doings bitter wickedness rebellion and foolishness god then speaks in verse 30 that israel's lovers will despise her and seek to kill her despite her efforts to wear expensive clothing ornaments and have a painted face notice that israel was not painting her face to please god for god never asked any woman to wear facial cosmetics israel was painting her face to please her idols and the nations that taught her their heathen ways sadly god's people then were doing the same thing jezebel did a few hundred years earlier painting their faces in the day of their destruction the last scripture about makeup is found in ezekiel 23 verse 40 which was probably spoken near the same time as jeremiah spoke his prophecy of destruction ezekiel's audience was most likely jews in babylon due to their exile from the promised land the entire chapter of ezekiel 23 portrays israel as an adulterous woman who lusts after the gods of other nations such as egypt and assyria in verses 40 and 41 and 43 and 44 ezekiel says and furthermore that ye have sent for men to come from far unto whom a messenger was sent and lo they came for whom thou didst wash thyself painteth thy eyes and decast thyself with ornaments and satisf upon a stately bed and a table prepared before it whereupon thou has set mine incense and mine oil then said i unto her that was old and adulteries will they now commit whoredoms with her and she with them yet they went in unto her as they go in unto a woman that plath the harlot so when they in unto a hola and unto aholaba the lewd women god likens israel unto a woman who is receiving her adulterous lovers and gives details on how she prepares for her lovers she washes herself paints her eyes or puts on makeup then puts on ornaments and sits on a bed near a table prepared for a meal this immoral idolatrous woman was going to lure her lover with all the fleshly lusts including his appetite a decorated bed and the visual seduction of makeup based upon these three scriptures second kings 9 30 jeremiah 4 30 and ezekiel 23 verse 40 god's word is against the use of makeup and facial cosmetics the entire rest of the bible does not offer even one hint of god requesting facial cosmetics upon any man or woman what god does want on her faces is his glory the anointing of the holy spirit the bible says we behold his glory and become changed into his image from glory to glory by the spirit of the lord think of how much more spiritual glory could be presented to this lost and dying world if believers spent more time praying and seeking god for the salvation of souls rather than painting a false face upon their countenances let the glory of jesus christ be upon your face instead of makeup but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord numerous people have erroneously told me that esther wore makeup but there is absolutely no scriptural support for this belief the bible never says esther painted her face as it says for jezebel and twice for israel in allegories scripturally esther was purified using oils not face painting esther 2 verse 9 and chapter 2 verse 12 declare she was given things for purification which were oils of myrrh and sweet odors esther was most likely given moisturizing oils for topical skin care perhaps esther's lack of makeup was the distinguishing characteristic that attracted the king to her inner beauty please do not be deceived by the gross misunderstanding among churches concerning esther as scripture never states that she used makeup to pain her face do not be influenced by those who add to the words of god for they should be found liars keep god's commandments and live he taught me also and said unto me let thine heart retain my words keep my commandments and live tattoos during my college days i was greatly tempted to get a tattoo i had already repented of my sins and was serving the lord jesus but not with the knowledge or zeal that i have today many of my college friends were getting tattoos and i wanted one that said jesus above a cross and the words my refuge under the cross i was torn about the final decision as i'd felt a conviction to refrain from marking my body so i decided to call my mother's pastor and his wife and they pointed me to leviticus 19 28 after opening my bible and reading this for myself the question was settled no tattoo for me in leviticus 19 verse 28 the lord told moses you shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead nor print any marks upon you i am the lord based upon this scripture tattoos are forbidden for jews and christians furthermore tattoos are never commanded nor approved of in the new testament the pattern of our holy god is the honor your body guideline that humans not pierce mark or cut their bodies in any way as tattoos permanently mark the skin the bible gives multiple examples of heathens who cut their own bodies due to demon possession first the prophets of baal cut themselves to no avail in the days of the prophet elijah thinking that their false gods would hear their requests second the maniac of gadara who is possessed with a legion of demons cut himself with stones when a person willfully cuts or mutilates his or her own body is a clear sign of demonic activity and the individual must repent and seek deliverance through the power of the blood of jesus christ christians who already have tattoos and feel the conviction of their mistake should first repent and vow never to get another marking on their body believers should not feel pressure to pay lots of money to remove their tattoos though as god is quick to forgive and ready to pardon confess sin instead the believer should try to cover up their tattoos especially if the images or words are immoral high heels there are multiple reasons why high heels should not be worn by christians and jews first scripture eludes to the haughty prideful and seductive daughters of zion wearing high heel-like shoes in isaiah 3 verse 16. moreover the lord saith because the daughters of zion are haughty and walk with stretch forth necks and went in eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet these judgment-bound women were mincing or taking short steps high heels naturally limit the length of each step a tinkling noise as they walked sounds very similar to the noise made when walking in high heels notice that their necks were also stretched out which would be a result of wearing these unnatural footwear second scientific evidence supports both the damaging physical effects that wearing high heels have upon people and also the sexual effects that high heels have upon the opposite sex a research article from 2014 stated that high heels put excess stress upon the foot bones and ultimately damage the musculoskeletal system while preparing to write about high heels i spoke with a licensed podiatrist about the effects of high heels this doctor stated that high heels are the absolute worst shoe a human being could ever wear due to the damaging effects that they have upon a person's entire body he stated that during his training multiple textbooks stated the fact that high heels never help the human body they only damage it christians are alarmed at any activity that damages their bodies which are the temples of the holy ghost believers do not belong to themselves but are the purchased property of jesus christ and therefore should not purposely prop up their bodies in a way that will lead to musculoskeletal damage later on in life third wearing high heels cannot be considered modest because they draw sexual attention to the wear and lead others to harbor lustful thoughts of fornication or adultery a 2017 study suggested that men are more attracted to women in high heels due to the lumbar curvature that high heels produce high heels must be the attire of harlots as spoken in the proverbs since they incite sexual lust jesus said those with unconfessed lust whether committed in the flesh or mind will be guilty of adultery finally recall that there is really nothing new under the sun high heels cannot be a new design in the 21st century that the world has never seen before rather high heels are revival of an older rebellious and seductive act conclusion christian liberties allow believers to respectfully express their own preferences without being disobedient to god and without being under the condemnation of the devil a greater responsibility goes with this liberty and christians must consistently examine their choices to be sure they are influencing other believers in a way that builds their faith rather than destroying it wearing simple inexpensive and meaningful jewelry is a liberty for christians jewelry worn in moderation will not cause genuine christians to become prideful but will serve as an expression of their faith or a sign of their marriage vows while jewry has some biblical support and offers some room for outward expression makeup tattoos and high heels are vividly described as sinful acts in the word of god and therefore should be avoided by all christians there is no liberty to sin in christianity romans 6 verses 1 and 2 states what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein
