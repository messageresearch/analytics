[0:03] Without a doubt, Holy Ghostfilled
[0:05] believers believe that William Brham was
[0:09] the voice of God to the Leodysian church
[0:12] age.
[0:13] Just as John the Baptist was a voice
[0:15] crying in the wilderness, according to
[0:17] scripture, God's prophet William Brham
[0:20] was the voice in the days of the seventh
[0:22] angel.
[0:25] William Brham's voice gave us the
[0:27] finished mystery of God. All the
[0:30] Bible-defined mysteries have been
[0:32] revealed to us through the prophet
[0:34] William Marin Brham.
[0:38] But is William Brham the only voice of
[0:40] God? Some would have us to believe that,
[0:43] but that's incorrect.
[0:46] The Bible emphatically teaches that not
[0:48] only are prophets the voice of God,
[0:51] sometimes even sinners can be the voice
[0:54] of God speaking the truth of God like
[0:57] Balum and Caiaphas.
[1:00] But thankfully for us, every believer in
[1:04] Jesus Christ can be used as God's voice.
[1:09] Brother Brandham said, "When you get in
[1:12] contact with God, it isn't your voice
[1:14] anymore. It's not your thought anymore.
[1:16] It becomes God's thought and God's
[1:19] voice. You are just a vine, just a
[1:22] branch. He's the vine."
[1:25] &gt;&gt; I've seen it work.
[1:27] And to think that if you get into that
[1:30] contact with God, it becomes to it isn't
[1:33] your voice anymore.
[1:35] It's not your thought anymore.
[1:37] It becomes God's thought and God's
[1:40] voice.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; You are just the vine or just a branch.
[1:46] He's the vine and it's his spirit that
[1:49] goes in and energizes.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; He also says it's God's voice through
[1:55] human lips. Every believer in him
[1:58] tonight is likewise possessed. So
[2:00] possessed, so completely given over till
[2:02] his words become like the words of
[2:05] Christ. I and my father are one,
[2:10] &gt;&gt; not three.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; We are one.
[2:14] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; God is in him. God speaks to him. He is
[2:19] no more his own.
[2:22] But he is God's voice
[2:25] &gt;&gt; through human.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And every believer in
[2:29] tonight is likewise
[2:32] &gt;&gt; possessed.
[2:34] So possessed. so completely given over
[2:37] to his words become like the words of
[2:39] Christ.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; He speaks
[2:43] &gt;&gt; and the word is made flesh.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; He speaks and the word is manifested.
[2:48] The works that I do shall you do also.
[2:50] These signs shall follow them that
[2:52] believe.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; We find this truth in numerous places in
[2:56] the scripture. 1 Peter 4:11 says, "If
[3:00] any man speak, let him speak as the
[3:02] oracles of God."
[3:03] It didn't say if any man preach. It said
[3:05] if any man speak. So every true believer
[3:09] should desire to speak the oracles of
[3:12] God. Which in the Greek means a divine
[3:15] oracle, an utterance of God.
[3:18] Some might wonder, how do I know if I'm
[3:20] speaking for God? Whenever you speak
[3:23] God's word in a pure, sincere heart,
[3:26] you're speaking for God.
[3:28] We see this throughout the scripture. In
[3:31] John chapter 4, the Samaritan woman at
[3:34] the well spoke for God. She went and
[3:36] testified. The Bible said specifically,
[3:38] she testified. She did not preach. She
[3:41] testified to many in the city and many
[3:44] believed on Jesus Christ because of her
[3:46] words. Because God was using her voice
[3:49] to speak his truth.
[3:51] In Acts 18, Priscilla and Aquilla talked
[3:55] with Apollos. Priscilla could not be a
[3:57] preacher. So she either testified to
[3:59] Apollos about the baptism of the Holy
[4:01] Ghost or she used a word of wisdom or a
[4:05] word of knowledge. She spoke audibly.
[4:09] God used her voice to relay truth to
[4:12] Apollo so he would know that there was
[4:13] another work of grace, the baptism of
[4:16] the Holy Ghost.
[4:18] Also in the book of Acts, Philip had
[4:19] four daughters who prophesied.
[4:22] Prophesying is foretelling the future by
[4:24] the spirit of the Lord. The spirit of
[4:26] Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy.
[4:29] So, Philip's four daughters became the
[4:31] voice of God to individuals who needed
[4:34] prophecy.
[4:36] Brother Random said, "A woman, a sister,
[4:39] a believer in Jesus Christ can be used
[4:41] in any of the nine gifts." But as far as
[4:44] gifts, the woman has all those can
[4:47] occupy one or any of those nine
[4:49] spiritual gifts according 1 Corinthians
[4:51] uh 12 and is under no bondage that her
[4:55] message should not come forth in its
[4:57] place. You see, each message waits for
[4:59] its time.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was asked if he's the
[5:02] only one that should preach and he said
[5:04] no. He said he's just one pebble on the
[5:07] beach. In other words, he's just one
[5:08] voice among many voices.
[5:11] Now, brother Brandham, is it true that
[5:14] no one should preach but you? No. Every
[5:20] man or that feels a call of God upon his
[5:22] life, get into the ministry, start
[5:24] preaching. We need him. Man of God are
[5:28] anointed all over the world to preach
[5:30] the gospel. See, I'm just one little
[5:33] pebble on the beach among many big
[5:35] stones. something. So, uh there's just
[5:38] many that's more eligible, more worthy,
[5:42] more of anything to preach than me. I'm
[5:44] just one little humble person laying out
[5:48] here. I'm one grain of wheat and a whole
[5:50] garner. See, so it's just a you know
[5:53] what I mean? Any man that's called of
[5:56] God needs to preach the gospel. But this
[5:58] message that I'm preaching
[6:03] uh is the true message of this day and
[6:07] it's the last message.
[6:10] You see what I'm doing, brethren? I'm
[6:12] putting you all the same place I am
[6:15] cuz you're just as much into it as I am.
[6:18] You are messengers of this same message.
[6:22] But of course, Brother Am's voice was
[6:24] extremely important. He was the seventh
[6:26] church age messenger. He fulfilled
[6:29] Revelation 10:7. He had a son of man
[6:32] gift. Luke 17:30. He was one of the
[6:35] seven stars in the hand of Jesus.
[6:39] A verse brother Ram used repeatedly to
[6:41] show how every believer can be the voice
[6:44] of God is Revelation 22:17.
[6:47] And the spirit and the bride say come.
[6:50] And let him that heareth say come. And
[6:53] let him that is a thirst come. and
[6:55] whosoever will, let him take the water
[6:58] of life freely.
[7:01] Three times in chapter nine of the
[7:03] church age book, Brother Brandham showed
[7:06] how the bride was the voice of God and
[7:09] she has a voice. And brother Brandham
[7:11] separated the prophet from the bride. He
[7:15] said, "The church is no longer the
[7:17] mouthpiece of God. He God will confound
[7:20] her false church system through the
[7:22] prophet and the bride. For the voice of
[7:25] God will be in her. Praise the Lord. The
[7:28] bride is the voice of God.
[7:34] Again he says, "Oh God still has a voice
[7:36] for the people of the world even as he
[7:39] has given a voice to the bride. That
[7:41] voice is in the bride as we have said."
[7:45] Praise God. God gave a voice to the
[7:48] bride.
[7:50] And finally, William Brandham said, "The
[7:52] spirit and the prophet and the bride
[7:54] will be saying the same thing, and what
[7:56] they say will have already been said in
[7:59] the word."
[8:01] Friends, take courage. You are God's
[8:04] voice to your friends, your family,
[8:06] strangers, co-workers.
[8:09] All you have to do is say what the Bible
[8:11] says, and you will be the voice of God.
[8:15] And looking back to Revelation 22:17,
[8:18] anytime you say come to church, come be
[8:21] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[8:22] Christ and not father, son, holy ghost,
[8:25] come receive the baptism of the Holy
[8:26] Ghost in your soul. You are the voice of
[8:29] God, because you're speaking what the
[8:32] spirit says and what has already been
[8:34] written in the Holy Bible, the word of
[8:37] God. Praise the Lord for the voice of
[8:40] the seventh angel in Revelation 10:7.
[8:43] And praise the Lord that the bride has a
[8:45] voice to say what the spirit is saying.
