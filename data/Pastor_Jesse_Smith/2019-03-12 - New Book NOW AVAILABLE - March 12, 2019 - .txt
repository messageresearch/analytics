TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ very thankful to announce that my first book restoring Christian modesty God's perfect will for your outward appearance is now available by God's grace I put links in the description below to Amazon for both paperback and Kindle versions paperback is priced at 995 and the kindle version is priced at 695 here's a brief history of how this book came about since 2005 I've been making gospel materials to distribute with the help of other brothers beginning with mp3 files on CD then in 2012 I started researching and tinkering with video editing then around March 2014 I published my first Vimeo video about water baptism by scripture alone seven months later I moved to YouTube and devoted most of my free time to script writing filming and editing now in March 2019 five years after joining Vimeo my YouTube page has over seven thousand subscribers and over six hundred thousand views this is a small channel to most but this has been a big encouragement to me now I'd like to begin a chapter by chapter overview of the book we'll do two chapters on this video perhaps three on the next and then two on the next by the grace of the Lord here are the headlines for chapter 1 I'll read the entire list but then I'll choose a few of the most beneficial lessons from this chapter that I'd like to share with you the Word of God is our foundation the rightly divided word of truth the predicted falling away what is holiness God requires holiness how we become holy holiness is beautiful love is the greatest motivator legalism modesty the beginning and ending a modest clothing today is like the days of Noah the root of in modesty outward nakedness signal spiritual nakedness the dangers of immodesty my experience with in modesty first I think what is holiness will be important we have to understand that holiness is consecration purification and sanctification of heart and life in fact God calls us to perfect holiness in reverential fear or respect to Almighty God it's also crucial to know that Scripture literally States our purpose is that we should be holy and without blame before him the headline love is the greatest motivator is extremely important because it shows the order that we must obey God we start with love for God which produces faith and then faith produces works Jesus Christ plainly taught that love is the greatest motivation for obedience it was Jesus's love for the father that allowed him to keep all the commandments of God the legalism section is very important you'll benefit from understanding that legalism is something that's added to the Word of God so Jesus fulfilled every word of God that did not make him a legalist it made him a loyalist the same applies to you and I if we keep all the Word of God that doesn't mean we're legalists it means we're loyal to obedience to every word of God the modesty headline defines modesty by the Bible because it's a Bible command the beginning and ending of modest clothing is an important section because God initiated modest clothing in Genesis 3 verse 21 and it has remained unchanged through the entire Bible the last mention of modest clothing is in Revelation 7 where we see Jesus and all the Holy Ghost filled Christians dressed in modest robes that go down to their feet we'll spend all eternity in modest clothes the root of a modesty is the influence of demons or evil spirits evil spirits cause people to take off their clothes and display their flesh in an immodest public way the book will also teach that if someone displays their nakedness in public it shows they have a spiritual nakedness as well this means the person does not possess the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's two dangers of in modesty one is causing people to stumble into sin which also means we're sinning against Christ the other is someone becomes captive to the will of evil spirits or they're addicted to demonic powers the last headline is about my experience with immodesty in second grade I was exposed to in modestly dressed women on MTV and has started an addiction to lust that lasted up into my college years but God by the power of the Holy Ghost through the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed me completely from that and I've never gone back chapter two headlines include rightly dividing Old Testament scripture nine categories for placing Old Testament scripture the New Testament Sabbath two or three Bible witnesses we are not under the law blanket statements abominations and magnifying the law to fulfill the law in Chapter two I show nine categories that Old Testament scripture can be rightly divided into this is extremely helpful for everyone to understand that Old Testament scripture can be used to guide our lives in the New Testament there's an important chart in Chapter two this shows all Ten Commandments are still in effect in the New Testament the two or three witnesses section is important because it shows God will give two or three scriptural witnesses for the principles or commands that remain in effect for New Testament believers we are not under the law shows that we are not under the curse of the law but rather were saved by grace but grace does put us under the law of the Holy Spirit according to the Bible the law of the Holy Spirit will never guide us into sin but rather into obedience and the fulfillment of God's righteous Word the abomination section is crucial most of the Old Testament abominations remain abominable in the New Testament and there's a very detailed list of these such as homosexuality idolatry murder witchcraft and other abominations in closing thank you for your support with this book I trust it'll be a blessing to your heart I trust it will teach you a lot more about the Lord and then be a witnessing tool you can use to share with others that Christ might be glorified please contact me with any questions or concerns god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
