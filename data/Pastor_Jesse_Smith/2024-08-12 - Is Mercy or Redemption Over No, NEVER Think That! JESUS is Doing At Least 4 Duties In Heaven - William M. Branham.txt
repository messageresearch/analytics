TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] is Mercy over don't never think that see just keep right on doing everything you can until you're taken away see greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question is redemption over is Mercy over and this is based upon a quote from the first seal from God's Prophet William brandham So my answer is no Redemption is not over Mercy is not over so we'll take a look at this quote and then additional quotes and scriptures by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William Maran brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother bram's Godly Christian character so here's the question does this quote mean Redemption is over in the first seal brother brandom said now when the seals completely are broken the time of redemption is over because the lamb left so this is a good question about the quote if you go on and listen to the rest of the seven seal sermons brother random is convinced the coming of Lord is very nigh very close even later on in 1963 brother renom preached souls in prison now and he was wondering if Mercy was over so if you haven't listened to souls in prison now listen to that and brother R said he was just presuming that Mercy might be over if you fast forward an entire year almost a year and a half to questions that answers 1964 people ask brother Bram specifically is Mercy over is redemption over and I'm going to play two quotes from Brother brandham Where he says don't never think that let's look at the first quote the first quote I want to read is when brother Ram tells us exactly when mercy is over this is in part two of questions and answers 1964 brother Rand said Jesus Takes the book of redemption when the bride is taken from the earth that makes total sense Jesus Takes that book of redemption and then he comes down here and he raptures all those names who are on the book the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and he that's holy is Holy still he that's righteous is righteous still he says then there's no more mediatorial work that's because God is cutting off the Gentile branch and then he's going to graph back in Israel into the holy tree according to Romans 11 let's listen to the quote after the bride is raptured will any of the foolish virgin be saved or will they all be lost no see everything will be finished for the Gentile church when the bride is taken from the earth the spirit of God leaves the Earth he that's filthy is filthy still he that's righteous is righteous still he that's holy is Holy still in other words the sanctuary becomes smoky where the the attorney stands to plead the case Christ leaves the sanctuary his day of mediatorial is over the Rapture comes he leaves from the sanctuary Goes Forth and takes the book of redemption and claims everything he redeemed there's no more mediatorial work how many understands that I got it on one of the seals or one of the yeah the seals I believe it was that Christ comes forth to claim his mediatorial work now and the next quote is from part three of questions and answer 64 the yes specifically is Mercy over it seems some are still finding Mercy in the prayer lines brother Ram said don't never think that Mercy's over he said God still got Mercy open just keep flowing into it as fast as you can God will do the stopping when it's time to stop let's listen to the quote brother B some say Mercy is over and no one can be saved now is this true I'm glad I got this one we walk watch and pray we watch the prayer lines and it seems some are still uh finding Mercy now that's the first question you got too is Mercy over don't never think that see just keep right on doing everything you can until you're taken away see we notice in a prayer line some finds Mercy sure Mercy's the doors are open see I think where you got this uh this thought might lay between see I don't have time to give each one of these scriptures a right place you see each one of these things the right place the in the prayer line you find Mercy certainly if I know Jesus is coming this afternoon I'd be doing just the thing I'm doing right now just continuing right on Mercy is always open see and now where I think you get it is about the finishing of the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals being loed see the Seven Seals it's manifested what takes place how what has took place the seventh Church age where the end of the seventh Church age when I say the end that doesn't mean it's this very hour this very minute you remember the Bible said back in the times of of the Lord Jesus Paul said for the time is at hand amen do you realize how long that was in God's time that was yesterday my time has been 2, years see the time is at hand see what God calls at hand is not what we call at hand see so Just Keep On Believing keep on praying keep on uh God still got Mercy open just keep flowing into it as fast as you can God will do the Stop and when it's time to stop see now by God's grace I want to read some scriptures that I shared with this person who asked the question especially regarding the first seal I said in my opinion and I could be wrong but I believe Jesus left left mediation in order to open the Seven Seals in March of 1963 he had to come forth take the book loose the seals Jesus literally broke those seals in heaven and then came down to Revelation 10 and revealed the revelations of the Seven Seals to God's Prophet brother brandham and now the next part is my opinion shortly after March of 1963 after Jesus loosed the seals and sent it to brother brandham he went right back into mediation because brother brandham said the Heavenly Dimension goes so much faster than our Dimension this is true because it gives Jesus plenty of time to do the numerous things he has to do in heaven first he must still be the mediator the Bible say there's one mediator between God and man it's the man Christ Jesus and the Bible said Jesus ever lives to make intercession Hebrews 7:25 so that's a major purpose of Jesus being resurrected is so he can live to make intercession for you and I because he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he can be a faithful and merciful High priest and we still need Jesus to intercede for us every single day second Jesus also needs time to prepare the New Jerusalem according to John 14 2 and 3 Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you so not only does Jesus have to be mediator he has to prepare the New Jerusalem and brother Bram said he's still doing that in the church age book he said the gates of the gigantic pearls are being raised and hinged this is in chapter N9 of the church age book let's listen to the quote this is the last warning there will not be another the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations have been laid the streets of gold have been paved the gates of gigantic pearls are raised and hinged like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the Heavenly beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly for she glistens and shines with a glory that is unearthly every facet of her beauty tells a story of Amazing Grace and Jesus love she she is a city prepared for a prepared people she awaits only for her inhabitants and soon they will throng her streets with joy yes it is the last call the spirit will not speak in another age the ages are over third Jesus is also doing Heavenly counsels in First Kings 22:1 15-23 we see a Heavenly Council where God is letting the evil spirits come forth and decide who will go deceive Ahab of course the Prophet Micaiah told about this and so this shows God has to have Heavenly counsels in order to bring his word to pass the Prophecies of the prophets have to be fulfilled so God has time also for Heavenly counsels just like he has time for mediation he has time for making the New Jerusalem he has plenty of time for Heavenly councils and the Bible also says that in the Book of Revelation I believe it's chapter 18 where God is going to have the kings of the earth I no I think it's Revelation 17 God's going to have the the kings of the earth do his will and the 10 Kings of the Earth are going to give their power to the Beast for one hour and then fourth just like in the Book of Job the angels and fallen angels all have a Day in heaven when they have to present themselves before the Lord and tell the Lord what they're doing that's according to job 1:6 so there's numerous other things that are happening in heaven but there's at least four things that Jesus has to do in heaven I've never studied this topic thoroughly so I imagine there's many more but this is just what came to me when I replied to this brother's question so Jesus has plenty of time to do all this because his Dimension goes much faster than ours Jesus can do all these things and still have plenty of time to be our intercessor so there is still Mercy there is still Redemption by the grace of God and the last point I want to make is that many are still experiencing Mercy I know people in denominations who've recently got deliverance from Evil addictions I mean very Wicked sinful addictions and they are testifying today of the power of Jesus Christ remember Satan cannot cast out Satan it's not Satan who's giving these people victories and deliverances it's the Holy Ghost because Jesus Christ is still making intercession for people even family members and friends I know in denominations that are not in the message of the hour that are still receiving mercy so praise God for that God has both wise virgin and foolish virgin and of course friends in the message we're still receiving Mercy uh these former Amish friends from Junction City Ohio they're receiving Mercy I've I've seen it myself I see it firsthand they're receiving Mercy forgiveness they have transformed lives by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is transforming their lives some of them are receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I've seen transformed lives in the message and also outside the message so yes there's still Mercy yes there's still redemption in closing friends this is a wonderful topic a wonderful question I hope this video has been a blessing by the grace of God thank God there's still Mercy today thank God there's still Redemption today according to the Bible and according to God's Prophet brother brandham so let's keep pressing into the mercy of God as brother brandham said just keep flowing into it as fast as you can so let's keep drawing nigh to God and God will draw nigh to us if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
