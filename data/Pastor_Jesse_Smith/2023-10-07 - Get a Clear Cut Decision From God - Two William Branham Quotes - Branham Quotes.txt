TRANSCRIPT
========================================
look what he could have done but I could call my father speak to him me straight way send me 12 Legions of angels well one of them could destroy the world said if my kingdom is this world am I subject to th but my kingdom is of above there you are see he could have done that but he didn't see though he could have done it he never listened to Satan's proposition now have you heard people say if if you believe is a Divine healer if you're a Divine healer Go Get Your Divine healer I got a man over here sick I'd like see him heal is that same devil amen he's trying to proposition with you he's trying to make you listen to him instead of God but a real true servant of God will listen to see what father says first like the little stat Cliff baby when they sent over here miss that said brother Brandon I called from Germany there was an American army with one of their jet planes sitting out here at the field would fly me to Germany and back in a day he was a chaplain and the baby's laying dead and that little a mother screaming she said listen but I know I stood right there and seen that woman hold that dead baby in her arms and died that morning I see brother BR walk right out there lay hands on that dead baby to come to life said this is my baby brother Brandon never been a death in their family see and this little thing took sick one morning and died that afternoon here was all of them standing around and giving prophecies and things the babies going to raise up and all like that I said well it's mighty nice sister sa but let me see what father said amen and I went out to the woods and I prayed come back in she done call two three times for got back the next morning nothing the doctor said all right said if that if you have faith like that lady we'll never let the baby leave the hospital let it lay right here you stay right here with it that's all right brother stat went seen the Army and major they said sure we will'll findly him over bring him back and there was a plane setting waiting to take me over that morning bring me back at night to Germany the heidleberg Germany for the resurrection of this baby I said sure God can do it but let's see what his will is then I went out prayed all night nothing happened come back the next morning nothing happened and I started into the room just then I looked there and there stood that light hanging there in the door said don't put your hand on that don't rebuke that that's a hand of God I got her on the phone I said sister STL bury your baby it's a hand of the lord it's God's will something Happ that baby down along the line you live go right where God knows where it's at you can go to it now it lives W you leave it right like that that great Lutheran preacher in Germany wrote a letter and said how I can appreciate what brother brandom waiting for that clear-cut decision of God before he said anything that's it all to God's decision no matter what others say whatever it is don't proposition Satan at all if Satan says now water baptism name father that he proposes you leave it alone God said otherwise he said you're a good man you don't have to be your good woman you don't have to do don't you proposition if the word says something different you stay with the word regardless what is that's the example Jesus give to you and there's that major assault you see that he made on him sister stats Cliff you're not long ago that really had my heart whirling around a little mother she lost her baby and the Lord was seen fit to take it away and she'd call me and she wanted to go to fly me over to Germany and the doctor was so kind to wait let the baby lay there the little fell died suddenly a sweet little plumpy girl and sister stas Cliff had lost her mother and she's pretty well broke up this baby certainly had got the best of her and she got on the phone long distance from Germany and wanted to fly over and I said sister stat Cliff she confessed her faith that she believed that the Lord Jesus had sent me for the work in the last days and such a loyal testimony no one could give him she meant it with all of her heart she hadd seen the Lord God do such things as that raise up the dead after they were dead but you see you really as much as I how a glory that would have been to God in Germany and everything if I could have done it myself I would have done it but the first thing we mustn't go until we know what we're going for so I went out and prayed and I think she stayed on the phone part of the time through the night and the next day I and there was nothing again mey said my wife said sister Sasa called twice any worded from the Lord yet I said not a thing and I said well when I pray again as in the woods that night then of course the little baby had to be taken care of and then just as I was coming in the Lord Jesus Vision struck standing front of me and I heard his voice said don't rebuke that that's the hand of the Lord so I knew then that God for some reason had taken her baby to Glory and it was certainly against the will of the Lord for me to say anything contrary to it and then I thought well that'll be a big let down but the one thing I did I minded the Lord I did what he told me you're not long ago I got a letter from a minister over there and he had made a statement by some more ministers he said the one and he was I think he might have been a German Luther I'm not sure but he said there's one thing that I can admire about brother brandom when all the excitement is going on he St study till he got a clear-cut decision from God then he know what he was doing that's the only way you can do those things is first hear from the Lord when he tells if he told me tonight that to go up there and raise out of that Cemetery President Kennedy I'd invite the whole world to come watch it done for i' have thus sayeth the Lord now but how can I say thus sayeth the Lord until the Lord has said thus many times people gets all excited and go under Impressions and things like that and what the best of their mental can think that ain't always true wait till he tells you and you know it then you've got exactly don't have to guess about it he's done told you it's thus sayith the Lord then he's told you and then you can go say what he said until then you can go and do everything you can do what you can yourself but you can't be sure until God has said so then you're positive on the tape of what time is it sir as many of you's got the tape I could speak for the chapters and anywhere else and say it's thus sayeth the Lord I'll meet seven angels and it'll be known the countryes over see and something's fixing to happen for he told me there it was just three months afterwards see all these other things when you when you the Lord has spoken it's got to happen that's the reason that I know that his word is perfect no matter what people think about it it's the word of God that's right that's thus sayeth the Lord that's and we know that that's true Jesus is coming when I don't know what farm how you come I have an idea but I I don't know it's roting here he said I if I be taken up you draw a man to him and he would come again I know he's coming right amen oh that's positive that's right and it doesn't matter to me when it is see if it's tonight or if it's next year or if it's a thousand years from now just so he comes I got eternal life I ain't going to be any older I'm just going to be there when he comes that's all that's it doesn't matter me when how which way he does it just so I'm there and he promised me that I would be there and he has already given me eternal life because he said he that can receive my words and Believe on him that sent me has eternal life and shall not come to the Judgment but pass from Death to life that's good enough for me right there I that's my absolute that's my absolute he promised it there's no way for it to ever fail it just cannot fail no more than God can fail it's impossible for God to fail that's one thing that God cannot do fail he can't fail aren't you happy for that oh my
