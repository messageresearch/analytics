[25:10] i just felt led i was kind of thinking
[25:12] about going back to here and
[25:14] i'd like to look at philippians chapter
[25:16] three tonight
[25:19] i just you know i'm just moved by this
[25:22] book and just the thought that
[25:25] this scripture is thus saith the lord
[25:27] imagine that god would
[25:29] have a man write a letter from a prison
[25:31] to just a little lonely church you know
[25:33] out in the city
[25:34] and it would be thus saith the lord to
[25:36] you and i just
[25:37] amazing thought there just a deep
[25:39] thought how
[25:41] we should uh cherish and reverence you
[25:43] know god's word to us
[25:45] praise god just how humble this this is
[25:48] this is eternal life on the pages praise
[25:51] god
[25:51] we can receive a portion of that tonight
[25:53] the blessings of it amen
[25:56] so let's read philippians 3
[25:59] verse 1.
[26:04] let's read this together uh 3 verse 1
[26:06] and then read our memory verse here
[26:08] just the first verse philippians 3 verse
[26:10] 1 on 3 1
[26:11] 2 3 finally my brethren
[26:15] rejoice in the lord to write the same
[26:18] things to you
[26:19] to me indeed is not grievous
[26:22] but for you it is safe praise god let's
[26:25] go to
[26:25] our next scripture matthew 6 30.
[26:40] praise god
[26:51] matthew 6 30 let's read 30 down to 34
[26:54] on 3 1 2 3 wherefore
[26:57] if god so clothed the grass of the field
[27:00] which today is
[27:02] and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall
[27:05] he not much more clothe you
[27:07] o ye of little faith therefore take no
[27:11] thought
[27:11] saying what shall we eat or what shall
[27:14] we drink
[27:15] or wherewith all shall we be clothed for
[27:18] after all these things do the gentiles
[27:20] seek
[27:21] for your heavenly father knoweth that ye
[27:23] have need of all these things
[27:25] but seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[27:28] his righteousness
[27:30] and all these things shall be added unto
[27:32] you
[27:33] take therefore no thought for the morrow
[27:36] for the morrow shall take thought for
[27:37] the things of itself
[27:39] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[27:42] thereof may god add his blessings to the
[27:43] reading of his word
[27:44] you may be seated praise god
[27:56] sorry i'm a little bit emotional here
[28:00] tonight
[28:02] it's a bit hard to speak when i got
[28:04] stuff running down my nose here so let's
[28:06] uh
[28:06] let's get to the word of god it's so
[28:08] wonderful to be in the house of the lord
[28:09] praise the lord
[28:14] so we're coming here to the next chapter
[28:16] here in uh the philippians
[28:18] i'm gonna use schofield's uh headlines
[28:21] real quick just to review
[28:23] uh chapter one was we began with christ
[28:26] the believer of spiritual life rejoicing
[28:28] in spite of their suffering
[28:31] and then in verse 8 he went joy
[28:33] triumphing over
[28:35] suffering
[28:38] praise god as paul was suffering in the
[28:40] prison but yet he was grateful
[28:41] that all the prisoners got to hear the
[28:44] gospel praise god
[28:45] through his life and though uh
[28:48] though people bash paul though people a
[28:51] lot of spoke
[28:52] evil about paul a lot of people did
[28:53] speak evil paul yet he said whether
[28:55] christ is preached the right way or the
[28:57] wrong way
[28:58] he said still christ is preached amen
[29:00] amen
[29:01] and then in chapter two uh he started
[29:03] going into christ the believer's pattern
[29:06] rejoicing in lowly service and we saw
[29:08] how
[29:09] paul said we should all have the same
[29:11] mind this mind of a servant
[29:14] and jesus christ is the example let this
[29:16] mind be in you
[29:18] which was also in christ jesus praise
[29:21] god
[29:21] how many got that attitude tonight that
[29:23] i'm just a servant of the lord amen and
[29:25] lord you can do whatever you want with
[29:26] me because i'm just a servant
[29:27] amen i'm not higher than you i'm not the
[29:29] boss i'm not telling you what to do
[29:31] i'm here to do what you want to do
[29:34] praise god
[29:35] that's our attitude that's the mind of
[29:36] christ he humbled himself
[29:39] to become a servant and that's the same
[29:41] mind that we must have humbling ourself
[29:43] becoming obedient to uh sufferings as
[29:47] we'll look at tonight we eventually get
[29:48] to that tonight
[29:50] and then after paul said he was
[29:53] christ was so humble that god highly
[29:55] exalted him
[29:56] he said now he said work out your
[29:59] salvation with fear and trembling
[30:01] amen because god is working in you his
[30:03] good pleasure and
[30:04] he said do not murmur he said be
[30:07] blameless
[30:08] harmless the sons of god hold forth the
[30:10] word of life
[30:11] praise god
[30:15] he said if i be offered upon the
[30:17] sacrifice he said i joy
[30:19] and i rejoice with you all he said he
[30:21] said i'm going to rejoice that i
[30:22] i'm making my life a sacrifice for you
[30:26] you know church sometimes we forget how
[30:27] important that is like beatrice is
[30:29] making a sacrifice i just looked at her
[30:31] she left her husband right just
[30:34] physically
[30:35] and she left her family so she can serve
[30:37] this family
[30:38] that's a sacrifice right sister it's
[30:41] hard right being away from hubby and
[30:43] family think of all her friends that she
[30:44] was with all those years
[30:46] i'm just trying to bring this down to a
[30:47] very simple way that we can understand
[30:49] it because we always see old preachers
[30:51] they make sacrifices but church we make
[30:53] sacrifices all the time in just simple
[30:55] ways right
[30:56] think about what even mothers and
[30:58] fathers how you sacrifice and
[31:00] you serve other people you know this
[31:02] world is going to be a lot of them are
[31:03] going to be condemned because they had
[31:05] abortions right they didn't want to
[31:06] serve their children
[31:07] they want to serve families and uh a lot
[31:10] of people
[31:11] a lot of young people speak evil their
[31:13] parents they don't take care of their
[31:14] parents right they send them off to the
[31:16] now sometimes they have to sometimes
[31:18] they just can't physically take care
[31:20] of their parents as they age but think
[31:22] about how you can make
[31:23] yourself a sacrifice how are you making
[31:27] a sacrifice
[31:28] even like amen huh they can serve their
[31:30] in-laws right
[31:31] they think about you know making meals
[31:33] or paying their bills you know think
[31:34] about that
[31:35] just think you're serving other people
[31:39] i'm just trying to use some simple
[31:40] examples uh that's that's what
[31:42] christianity is all about so
[31:44] let's not forget these simple ways they
[31:46] seem simple but
[31:47] really in god's eyes they're a
[31:49] well-pleasing sacrifice to his great
[31:51] name
[31:52] amen that's what paul says he said i am
[31:55] giving my
[31:56] life as a sacrifice i am offered on the
[31:59] sacrifice for you praise god amen
[32:02] and let's do that tonight praise god
[32:04] let's see let's see our lives as i'm
[32:05] giving my life
[32:06] as a sacrifice for christ and let me god
[32:10] show me if
[32:11] if i got discouraged if i got you know
[32:13] upset if i got down
[32:15] uh if i got angry show me again a a in a
[32:18] fresh man or show
[32:19] renew transform my mind that i can see
[32:22] how i'm supposed to have an attitude of
[32:24] a servant
[32:24] so i can be offered on the altar of a
[32:27] sacrifice
[32:28] for god amen praise god
[32:31] hallelujah it's encouraging for me to
[32:34] know
[32:34] we have a small church but i'm
[32:35] encouraged to know that there's little
[32:36] people all around the world
[32:38] that are being encouraged by our little
[32:40] sacrifice tonight amen
[32:42] they love singing along with our worship
[32:43] they love hearing the preaching
[32:45] they're you know we're here to help this
[32:47] group but it's nice through technology
[32:48] praise god
[32:49] we can help a few people around the
[32:51] world you know
[32:53] encourage them in the faith praise god
[32:54] we're happy to do that
[32:56] it's our pleasure uh to serve the
[32:58] purpose of god amen
[33:00] and paul then we saw how paul uh
[33:03] said i sent timothy to you and finishing
[33:06] chapter two
[33:07] he was like-minded see this book's all
[33:09] about the mind
[33:10] uh having the right mindset winning the
[33:12] greatest battle
[33:14] ever fought praise god and then he says
[33:17] how
[33:18] epiphanitis you know he was sick but god
[33:21] healed him and had
[33:22] mercy on him and i had mercy on paul
[33:25] and he healed his friend praise god
[33:27] that's what i'm asking god for tonight
[33:28] mercy on my dad praise god
[33:31] to give me some more joy that god would
[33:32] heal my father praise god
[33:34] i'm asking god for his grace and i
[33:36] believe i just trusted
[33:37] and believe me with that all that
[33:38] mustard grade seen faith i have
[33:40] that god will do it uh for god is good
[33:43] amen amen
[33:44] now let's begin chapter three just a
[33:46] quick review there now he says finally
[33:47] my brethren rejoice in the lord
[33:49] he said uh to write the same things to
[33:52] you
[33:53] to me indeed is not grievous but for you
[33:56] it is
[33:56] safe let's look at a few of these words
[33:58] now finally paul says finally
[34:01] and he's only halfway through the book
[34:03] it's only four chapters but
[34:04] he finishes the first two chapters and
[34:06] now he's starting so he's like if he
[34:08] broke it in two pieces right
[34:10] the first one is let them know how he's
[34:12] doing and tell him to be servants
[34:14] and now he breaks into this last book
[34:17] or this last section of his letter now
[34:19] of course it wasn't in chapters i think
[34:20] until
[34:21] about the 1800s or 1600s i can't forget
[34:24] i keep forgetting which year it was put
[34:27] in chapters but
[34:28] he could see i'm naturally going to
[34:30] break this letter into two parts
[34:32] and now he begins uh this idea
[34:36] and he's going to break into warning
[34:37] them in just a moment
[34:39] and you're going to see how uh that he
[34:42] warns him now remember
[34:43] what is his greatest desire church his
[34:45] greatest desire is that everybody can
[34:46] think the same way
[34:48] he just says that remember he said it
[34:49] eight times have the same mind
[34:51] be like-minded right uh remember naomi's
[34:54] memory verse
[34:54] is in chapter four right you think on
[34:57] these things right
[34:59] uh meditate on them and the peace of god
[35:01] will keep your hearts and minds through
[35:03] christ jesus
[35:04] it's all about the mind paul paul's
[35:06] telling these persecuted saints
[35:08] in philippi keep your mind on god
[35:11] amen praise god keep your mind on
[35:15] heavenly things amen and so he breaks in
[35:17] this
[35:18] this next part and he's going to start
[35:20] breaking them
[35:21] or teaching them about warnings they
[35:24] said
[35:24] i'm warning you now this is just
[35:27] interesting
[35:28] the experience i just it's
[35:32] kind of hard to understand but i was
[35:33] thinking it's kind of like a roller
[35:35] coaster ride being a christian's like a
[35:36] roller coaster right
[35:37] like you know i i got johnny's text
[35:40] about the animals and i was like crying
[35:41] i was
[35:42] getting close to weeping and then you
[35:44] know not long after that i forget what
[35:45] news i heard but then i got joyful
[35:48] it's like you know just it's up and down
[35:50] now it's all holy right it's not it's
[35:52] not bad
[35:52] it's all holy emotion but it's up and
[35:54] down right it's constant
[35:56] rejoicing and then weeping and then
[35:59] and then it's just up and down
[36:01] constantly uh and and this is
[36:03] this is the the experience of a
[36:05] christian because the bible says
[36:07] you know as a body if the body's happy
[36:09] be happy for the body
[36:10] if the body's hurting hurt with the body
[36:13] in other words try to feel
[36:14] people's pain right try to feel their
[36:16] pain but also
[36:17] try to feel their joy as well praise god
[36:20] you know satan likes to make us
[36:21] a little jealous of people when they got
[36:23] victory right
[36:25] we'll hear about somebody you know god
[36:26] did a miracle you know like we saw in
[36:28] you guys as a uh healing last week if
[36:31] we're not careful
[36:32] say no you know say oh we'll see they
[36:33] got a miracle you don't
[36:37] but see the the reality is to cast down
[36:39] that line and say
[36:40] praise god amen god is working in the
[36:43] body amen
[36:44] amen maybe i'll be next praise god
[36:47] either way somebody's going to be next
[36:49] amen
[36:51] so see that that's the attitude of a
[36:52] christian you know we always rejoice
[36:54] whatever is happening in the body we
[36:56] rejoice with it and then other times
[36:58] you know we we sorrow with it
[37:01] it's quite a you know just to me it's
[37:03] quite a thing as a christian you know
[37:04] learning
[37:05] uh and church what does that take it
[37:08] takes sensitivity right
[37:10] you have to be sensitive to other people
[37:12] not just thinking about me me me what
[37:13] i'm going to do what i want to do
[37:15] but you know especially when people are
[37:17] sad you got to like
[37:19] enter into their sorrow you might have
[37:21] been happy and everything
[37:24] but i've you know we've seen at times
[37:25] where people you know
[37:27] they'll rebuke message people rebuke
[37:29] other people just for being sad but the
[37:31] bible says mourn
[37:32] with those who mourn right
[37:36] or vice versa like we said someone who's
[37:38] mourning they can't rejoice with
[37:39] somebody who's happy praise god
[37:42] so it just takes what a sensitivity it
[37:45] takes uh
[37:46] being led by the holy spirit praise god
[37:50] not being selfish right which we all got
[37:52] to battle every day
[37:53] not being selfish but being selfless
[37:57] and having the mind of christ
[38:01] now he says finally my brethren so he's
[38:04] beginning to kind of
[38:05] change to the end of the letter
[38:09] i like this finally my brethren what
[38:10] rejoice in the lord
[38:12] amen so it's just interesting and church
[38:15] there are eight times i think let me
[38:16] look it up
[38:17] or 10 times that he tells them to
[38:19] rejoice
[38:20] can i read them real quick would that be
[38:22] okay i just want to
[38:23] do rejoice and joy real quick
[38:28] in this book 14 times in this book
[38:32] in a short letter now what if what if i
[38:34] got what if you got 14 texts from me and
[38:36] they all said be happy
[38:37] rejoice what would you say like wow
[38:40] brother jesse really wants me to be
[38:41] happy
[38:42] he must be really happy paul writes one
[38:44] letter can you imagine
[38:46] or one email let's say i've said amen an
[38:48] email but 14 times
[38:50] i tell them rejoice brother amen have
[38:52] joy amen
[38:53] amen that's what paul says paul says
[38:56] remember in chapter 1 verse 4
[38:58] i make all my requests with joy so he's
[39:00] praying constantly with joy
[39:02] in one verse 18 he said whether christ
[39:05] is preached i rejoice
[39:06] and i will rejoice no matter if it's in
[39:09] pretense
[39:10] or in truth he rejoices so rejoices that
[39:13] preaching is going on praise god
[39:16] in chapter 1 verse 25 he says it again
[39:19] i know i'll continue with your
[39:21] furtherance and joy of faith
[39:24] that you're rejoicing may be more
[39:26] abundant praise god so he was going to
[39:28] keep laboring
[39:29] so they could grow in rejoicing
[39:32] 14 times church and then chapter 2 he
[39:36] said fulfill my joy and be like-minded
[39:39] amen verse 16 holding forth the word of
[39:43] life and i may rejoice in the day of
[39:45] christ
[39:46] that's future rejoice right run the race
[39:49] and hold forth god's word and share
[39:52] god's word and testify of god's goodness
[39:54] amen
[39:55] he said and i will rejoice on the day of
[39:58] judgment praise god
[39:59] or perhaps the day when uh the day of
[40:02] christ maybe perhaps
[40:03] when we all get there and at the
[40:04] marriage suffer the lamb i'm not sure
[40:06] which exactly that day is
[40:09] and then he says verse
[40:12] 217 if i be offered upon the sacrifice
[40:15] and service of your faith i joy and
[40:17] rejoice with you all
[40:19] so paul is finding joy with them in his
[40:22] sacrifice
[40:23] in other words when we come together and
[40:24] we have church let's all be happy praise
[40:26] god
[40:27] let's all rejoice amen he said because
[40:30] it's with you
[40:31] i rejoice with you praise god
[40:34] he said for this cause i do rejoice and
[40:36] he said and rejoice with me
[40:39] what do you think churchill uh well i
[40:43] won't
[40:43] i won't say that maybe i'll let me go up
[40:45] let me move on
[40:46] philippians 2 28 he said uh
[40:51] he sent timothy uh that when you see him
[40:53] again you may rejoice
[40:55] and then i may be less sorrowful i'm
[40:56] sorry that was epiphanitis
[40:59] okay so paul was going to rejoice when
[41:01] the saints saw
[41:02] his guest minister i said it was his
[41:05] little lower minister right he's the
[41:06] prophet
[41:07] and underneath him he had he had
[41:08] ministers so he said i'll rejoice when
[41:11] you receive the ministry
[41:12] praise god and then he says finally
[41:14] brethren rejoice in the lord
[41:16] now later on in verse 3 it says he says
[41:19] we're
[41:20] of the circumcision who rejoice in
[41:22] christ jesus so now he tells us why we
[41:24] can rejoice
[41:25] and where where does our rejoice lay it
[41:28] lays in christ
[41:29] and christ is the word amen
[41:32] glory that's why we read our bibles we
[41:34] should rejoice amen
[41:35] because christ is the word in verse
[41:38] chapter four verse one he said my
[41:40] brethren you're my joy and my crown
[41:43] see if at the very least we should have
[41:46] joy just by seeing one another here
[41:47] praise god amen
[41:49] because paul says you are my joy the
[41:50] church he started you know the church
[41:52] that he found remember he wasn't there
[41:53] long
[41:54] but of course it grew over time but he
[41:56] said you're my joy
[41:58] and my crown praise god then he says
[42:01] verse 4 or chapter 4 verse 4 rejoice in
[42:03] the lord
[42:04] sometimes and again i say rejoice did i
[42:06] say that right
[42:08] no rejoice in the lord always
[42:11] aren't you glad god he he gives us a
[42:13] high calling praise god
[42:15] he tells us not just sometimes all the
[42:17] time we do sometimes
[42:18] but god's saying your life will be
[42:20] better if you rejoice always amen
[42:24] and again i say rejoice
[42:28] that's the next one verse
[42:31] 10 and chapter four but i rejoiced in
[42:34] the lord greatly
[42:35] at your care for me so when paul got a
[42:38] gift he rejoiced
[42:40] we got a check in the mail from somebody
[42:42] that uh someone of our friends in
[42:43] another church in the message they just
[42:45] sent a nice little check in the mail i
[42:46] just rejoiced i
[42:47] almost started crying like wow they said
[42:49] we just want to bless you and thank you
[42:50] for being an example of godliness and
[42:52] all these things and
[42:53] i thought man i just makes me joy praise
[42:56] god that people see your testimony you
[42:57] know
[42:58] and there it is 14. can you believe that
[43:01] 14 times in one
[43:03] letter right or one email say it like
[43:05] that
[43:06] in one letter paul says have joy rejoice
[43:09] there's so many reasons
[43:11] to have joy there's so many reasons to
[43:13] rejoice let's choose to be joyful praise
[43:15] god
[43:16] amen more abundant joy praise god
[43:20] now let's look at back at verse one
[43:22] let's finish verse one
[43:23] to write the same things to you what the
[43:25] joy the rejoicing
[43:27] to me indeed is not grievous so it's not
[43:29] irksome so paul says this doesn't bother
[43:31] me to write this it's not a bother to me
[43:35] he says but for you it is safe
[43:39] which means firm or sure or steadfast
[43:43] okay so it's not grievous for me but for
[43:46] you you need it right
[43:47] it's firm it's it's solid you need this
[43:50] he said so 14 times if somebody tells
[43:52] you to rejoice i think you get the
[43:53] picture right
[43:55] right if somebody kept telling you you
[43:57] need to smile more you need to smile
[43:58] more
[43:59] you know you need to sing louder you
[44:01] need to if somebody told you something
[44:02] 14 times i think you get it after a
[44:03] while right
[44:05] you know so paul says he said you need
[44:07] this it's
[44:08] it's for you praise god now verse two
[44:11] now look
[44:12] he tells them rejoice and then he goes
[44:15] right into giving them
[44:16] warnings isn't that something
[44:20] we're supposed to be happy all the time
[44:22] but then watching all the time
[44:25] right see church we have to be so
[44:29] sensitive that we can go
[44:30] one moment rejoicing like i rejoice with
[44:32] the saints when i see everybody but as
[44:33] soon as i leave
[44:34] oh gotta be ready to battle yeah
[44:38] like recently one time i felt really
[44:40] foolish i'll just kind of tell a story
[44:42] of myself
[44:42] i was leaving church here i was so happy
[44:44] i forget what night it was it was
[44:46] it was this year sometime and i'm just
[44:50] driving and i thought i looked i'm
[44:51] driving out the parking lot here
[44:54] and i thought i looked and i did it and
[44:55] my wife's like jesse and
[44:57] i slammed on the brake and we almost got
[44:59] the car accident we were like
[45:00] a few inches to get away from a car
[45:02] accident i don't know if the kids
[45:03] remember that or not
[45:04] but i was just like all happy driveway
[45:06] we had such a good service and
[45:07] i didn't even realize the devil was
[45:09] right there
[45:11] he was taking advantage of my that was
[45:13] my fault but see
[45:14] the devil comes to steal kill and
[45:16] destroy
[45:18] and thank god my wife was aware
[45:21] see see if i get carried off and get too
[45:23] far in the flesh
[45:24] we don't even realize right
[45:27] that there's trouble you know how many
[45:29] people have you heard
[45:30] they've been in their cars in their
[45:32] driveways and hit their kids or
[45:34] because they're just in a hurry you know
[45:36] that happened to my grandpa you know
[45:38] i told you a story god raised my aunt
[45:40] from the dead
[45:41] she got ran over by my grandpa just in a
[45:43] hurry to get out of the driveway
[45:46] but yet we could be so happy or we just
[45:49] got like the bible said we got to walk
[45:50] lightly we got to be aware of what's
[45:52] going on praise god
[45:54] but isn't that something he said rejoice
[45:56] and then now he says beware
[46:00] right isn't that an amazing church just
[46:02] think about it he said rejoice in the
[46:04] lord now you beware of what
[46:06] dogs he says there was nothing lower to
[46:09] a jew well i guess
[46:11] the pig was pretty low too right the pig
[46:13] was pretty low because they were so
[46:14] unclean
[46:15] so i guess i'll say like that there was
[46:16] few things as low as a dog and a pig
[46:19] right to a jew because they were so evil
[46:24] remember jesus said he told that seraph
[46:26] syrophoenicia woman
[46:27] he said the dogs he said you're a dog
[46:30] and she said you're right
[46:32] i am a dog he said the gospel was sent
[46:35] to the
[46:35] lost sheep or the house of israel so
[46:37] jesus was calling jews
[46:39] sheep and gentiles dogs in other words
[46:42] dogs are killers right
[46:44] dogs are dirty the peter says the dog
[46:47] will return
[46:48] to its vomit i don't want to describe
[46:49] that too much
[46:52] right you see somebody they leave sin
[46:54] and then they go back that's
[46:56] dog behavior this dog they're dirty
[46:59] they're filthy right dog's mouths are
[47:02] some of the
[47:03] dirtiest mouths of all animals that's
[47:05] why when people kiss and lick dogs you
[47:07] gotta wonder
[47:08] what are they thinking but maybe they
[47:10] take a shower afterwards or something i
[47:12] don't know
[47:13] but they're filthy they're i mean they
[47:14] carry lots of germs
[47:16] a few things as low as dogs
[47:20] and paul says rejoice and he says beware
[47:24] of dogs
[47:28] beware of evil workers so now we know
[47:30] what dogs are there are people who do
[47:32] evil works
[47:35] he says uh beware of the concision that
[47:38] we
[47:39] means mutilation right dogs
[47:42] rip and tear and kill well we just saw
[47:44] it with the bland family right
[47:46] with turkeys and chickens
[47:49] paul says rejoice in the lord be happy
[47:52] rejoice
[47:52] but beware there's dogs trying to rip
[47:56] and and bite you
[47:59] they're trying to cut the people of god
[48:01] because what are we we're sheep paul
[48:03] said
[48:03] we're delivered to the slaughter all day
[48:06] long
[48:08] quite a picture but do we trust our
[48:10] shepherd you better believe it amen
[48:13] we've got a chief shepherd amen i'm not
[48:15] talking about me i'm nothing
[48:17] right we are the god shepherd jesus amen
[48:20] i'm a miner very small miner the
[48:23] smallest pebble on the beach miner
[48:24] but jesus christ he's the rock amen he's
[48:27] the eternal rock the rock
[48:29] on which everyone else stands amen amen
[48:32] he's our rock and our comfort our
[48:35] strength
[48:38] so beware of those who want to
[48:41] destroy you
[48:45] remember he's telling me servants he
[48:46] said have the same mind serve god just
[48:48] be
[48:49] have this have this mindset but be
[48:51] careful
[48:52] something's trying to cut you
[48:55] be careful the devil's out there trying
[48:58] to kill
[48:59] steal and destroy
[49:06] so how many uh how many uh believe that
[49:08] that if the holy spirit was giving
[49:10] warnings in that day
[49:11] how many believe he'll give warnings
[49:12] today too some sermons are going to be
[49:16] warning sermons right they're going to
[49:19] be warnings
[49:20] and if the people don't take heed then
[49:22] you have to suffer the consequences
[49:24] right
[49:26] you see it many times that people won't
[49:28] humble themselves or repent
[49:30] their lives go into utter debauchery
[49:33] right
[49:33] or worldliness or chaos if they won't
[49:37] take heed to the word of the lord
[49:42] remember it's god's love church god's
[49:44] love that gives us warnings
[49:46] thank god oh my
[49:52] i want you to see here straight
[49:56] rejoicing is so important because the
[49:57] bible says the joy
[49:59] of the lord is our strength she says be
[50:02] strong
[50:03] but dogs are coming at you be strong
[50:06] be strong sheep praise god in other
[50:08] words stay close to the shepherd amen
[50:11] hallelujah because you know satan likes
[50:13] to attack when we're discouraged or down
[50:15] or
[50:16] we separate ourselves from the flock
[50:18] right
[50:19] don't win a fellowship don't want to
[50:20] talk to anybody don't want to be by it i
[50:22] want to talk to anybody about god
[50:24] when the sheep get separated that's when
[50:27] satan loves
[50:28] to attack loves to divide the fold right
[50:35] he says beware but what about all that
[50:37] joy
[50:38] the joy's going to give you strength
[50:40] praise god
[50:41] now look paul name calls you believe
[50:43] godly men call names sometimes
[50:45] yeah yeah brood of
[50:49] brood of serpents john the baptist said
[50:52] generation of snakes jesus said here he
[50:55] calls them dogs
[50:57] they sometimes preachers don't mince
[50:59] words praise god
[51:02] and what is it for it's to give the
[51:03] warning
[51:05] to give the warning god's love
[51:08] gives warnings but satan wants to
[51:11] mutilate or cut or attack
[51:15] god's sheep through what brother jess
[51:19] chapter 3. i'm sorry verse three yeah
[51:22] chapter three verse three verse three is
[51:23] what i meant to say
[51:24] for we are the circumcision which
[51:28] worship god
[51:28] in the spirit and rejoice
[51:32] in christ jesus and have no confidence
[51:36] in the flesh now look three things
[51:39] that separate us from legalists
[51:43] right and we know they're in the message
[51:46] they'll make anything legalistic to make
[51:48] themselves more holy
[51:51] but in this case they were battling
[51:53] circumcision
[51:56] paul says the dogs are the jews in this
[51:59] case
[52:00] that we're trying to tell them you're
[52:01] not it's good not good enough to be
[52:03] saved by grace
[52:04] you have to follow uh our man-made
[52:06] commands
[52:09] and paul says no these are dogs that are
[52:11] going to ruin your relationship with god
[52:16] he said but we are in other words we're
[52:18] the true jews praise god just like
[52:20] esther
[52:21] amen everybody thought she was a gentile
[52:23] but she was a jew praise god
[52:25] we're the we are the ones that are
[52:26] circumcised amen hallelujah
[52:28] we're the ones that that have the
[52:30] covenant with abraham's seed hallelujah
[52:33] we're the ones that got it how do you
[52:35] know brother jesse
[52:36] because the bible said we worship god in
[52:39] the holy spirit praise god and where
[52:41] there's a spirit there's liberty praise
[52:43] god
[52:44] church you've got all the liberty to
[52:45] shout and praise god and
[52:47] cry and weep and prophesy and speak in
[52:50] tongues and pray for the sick
[52:51] we got all the liberty we want here
[52:53] praise god
[52:54] just got to be led by the holy spirit
[52:56] hallelujah so we just wait on god's
[52:58] stopping until we do it
[53:00] we got all the liberty we want oh oh
[53:03] god's leadership
[53:04] uh when it's when it's time to do it
[53:06] that's when you do it praise god
[53:08] right and usually that's after the
[53:10] preaching right any
[53:12] any leadership of the holy spirit
[53:13] usually it's after the preaching
[53:15] usually not always right sometimes god
[53:18] can stop a service short
[53:20] and just go right into prayer for the
[53:21] sick or something like that
[53:24] so we don't want to limit the holy
[53:26] spirit but we want to recognize that we
[53:28] have the liberty of god
[53:31] thank the lord i appreciate the liberty
[53:34] of the holy spirit praise god
[53:38] so why are we true jews well we're
[53:40] circumcised from the things of the world
[53:43] we worship god in the holy spirit we
[53:45] rejoice
[53:46] in christ jesus and he is the word
[53:50] hallelujah and we have no confidence
[53:53] in our flesh
[53:58] in other words we don't uh we don't get
[54:00] excited about things our flesh can do
[54:02] that
[54:03] uh that make us seem like we're better
[54:05] than others
[54:06] right because that's what they were
[54:08] doing they were saying well
[54:10] look i've been circumcised so i'm better
[54:12] than everybody else
[54:13] look look at what i've done and paul's
[54:15] saying that's
[54:16] that you did that he's saying but look
[54:18] what god did in me
[54:20] praise god anybody with a knife can do
[54:24] what you've got
[54:25] but only people who let jesus into their
[54:27] soul can get what i've got
[54:29] amen amen that's the difference
[54:32] see legalists they always have something
[54:34] they can do
[54:35] that they think makes them more holy but
[54:38] paul's saying that
[54:39] that's a man-made righteousness right
[54:42] anybody can do that on their own
[54:44] but what god does is is supernatural
[54:47] it's an
[54:48] inward word praise god it's a
[54:49] supernatural
[54:51] character work that christ does and
[54:53] that's the real value of a christian
[54:55] praise god
[54:56] the inward things when god changes your
[54:59] desires and your passions
[55:01] and your behaviors and your habits amen
[55:03] and it's all based upon god's mercy and
[55:06] his love
[55:06] amen amen that's what we rejoice that's
[55:09] what we got confidence in
[55:11] what he got compensated brother jesse
[55:12] that god took the desire for cigarettes
[55:14] out of my life praise god
[55:16] i didn't work my way into it and beat
[55:18] myself up or anything like that
[55:19] god took it away praise god amen
[55:22] by faith he took it away hallelujah just
[55:25] little things just you know think about
[55:26] things like that
[55:27] even the way i dress you know the way
[55:29] our sisters dress is a good example
[55:32] if they're doing it with their ability
[55:34] then it's their righteousness
[55:36] but if they let god do it and god gave
[55:38] them desire and god took out the desire
[55:41] for them to be worldly and now they want
[55:42] to present themselves holy and not cause
[55:44] men to stumble
[55:45] and glorify god and to redirect all the
[55:48] attention to christ
[55:49] then that's christ righteousness
[55:52] i didn't hear you praise god and yet
[55:54] like i said my flesh still wants to
[55:55] smoke all the time
[55:57] but i never have after god took it out
[55:58] of my life see because i'm winning the
[56:01] battle i'm winning the greatest battle
[56:03] that was ever fought
[56:04] i'm becoming minded like christ i have
[56:06] the mind of christ amen
[56:09] shall i shall i continue in sin that
[56:11] grace may abound
[56:13] god forbid amen
[56:17] it doesn't magnify grace when i sin
[56:20] it cheapens grace it fails grace but
[56:23] when i lean upon his ability
[56:25] and his obedience to the holy spirit
[56:28] then that glorifies god and it magnifies
[56:30] grace amen
[56:31] amen yeah i'll fight every day for it
[56:34] but it's worth the fight praise god
[56:36] that's what i am i'm a fighter praise
[56:37] the lord honestly i am a fighter i'm a
[56:40] soldier of the cross praise
[56:41] that's what soldiers do they fight
[56:43] praise god
[56:44] i'm a lamb but i'm a soldier by they man
[56:47] think about that lambs that fight
[56:49] there's all these different
[56:50] illustrations that we are we're lambs
[56:52] killed all day but then we're soldiers
[56:54] then we're shep i'm a shepherd you know
[56:56] watching over the sheep there there's so
[56:57] many different
[56:58] roles that we fulfill praise god as
[57:00] christians
[57:01] oh my beautiful
[57:06] so we don't put confidence in our flesh
[57:09] things that we can do
[57:13] and this example is of course
[57:15] circumcision paul gives other examples
[57:16] remember the liberties like holy days
[57:19] well you know on easter
[57:22] i always do this and this and this and
[57:23] on christmas i always do this
[57:26] that's fine you know i
[57:29] i fast every christmas and no one else
[57:31] in the church does well look how holy i
[57:32] am
[57:33] yeah that's yeah if you're fast and
[57:35] you're led of the holy spirit well then
[57:37] it's not
[57:37] it's not your glory it's god leading you
[57:40] to do something for him praise god
[57:42] it's not your credit it's god's credit
[57:45] amen
[57:47] see these are all areas where you know
[57:48] legalism slip this is where satan tried
[57:50] that's where that dog tries to slip in
[57:53] right those dogs those evil workers they
[57:55] try to slip
[57:56] in and take away uh from christ's
[57:59] righteousness and try to
[58:00] promote your own righteousness
[58:06] three things church we worship in the
[58:08] spirit the holy spirit we have the
[58:10] freedom of the holy spirit
[58:12] we rejoice in christ we don't get
[58:14] excited about man's creeds
[58:16] we get excited about the living god amen
[58:19] praise god
[58:20] when god does something great and we
[58:22] know it was god that's when we rejoice
[58:24] amen
[58:25] we don't get rejoiced we don't rejoice
[58:26] in our righteousness or anything we can
[58:28] do
[58:29] we rejoice in what god has done because
[58:31] god has been so good to us amen
[58:33] amen and he keeps showing himself alive
[58:35] amen
[58:36] he keeps showing himself answering
[58:38] prayers and his faithfulness and his
[58:40] provision
[58:40] and for all that we give god glory we
[58:42] rejoice in what christ jesus does
[58:45] not us because there's nothing i can do
[58:47] anyway praise god
[58:49] that would do anything good
[58:53] it's so refreshing to go back and see
[58:54] what paul said in it
[58:57] oh bye no confidence in the flesh look
[59:04] at verse four
[59:04] so now he he starts getting into the the
[59:08] example of himself
[59:11] so now he says if anybody could have
[59:13] been a dog
[59:14] he said it could have been me now he was
[59:17] right
[59:18] he literally spiritually was a dog
[59:21] because he was
[59:22] he was holding the coat for stephen to
[59:24] be killed right he was
[59:26] arresting christians and taking them to
[59:28] jail
[59:29] who knows if any died under his care i
[59:30] don't know who knows if any died once
[59:33] they got in prison
[59:34] we don't know but he was polling
[59:35] christians trying to get them to
[59:36] blaspheme
[59:38] the unforgivable sin and trying to take
[59:40] them to jail
[59:42] so paul knows what a dog is he used to
[59:44] be anointed with that wrong spirit
[59:48] right verse four though i might
[59:51] also have confidence in the flesh if any
[59:53] other man thinketh that he hath aware of
[59:55] he might trust in the flesh
[59:56] i more now this is awesome
[59:59] paul's saying if anybody could have
[1:00:02] trusted in their flesh
[1:00:04] it would have been me now look at this
[1:00:07] god took
[1:00:08] the most legalistic zealous
[1:00:12] of all the religious people the worst of
[1:00:15] the i'll say like this the worst of the
[1:00:17] worst
[1:00:18] who like it was all about me and what i
[1:00:20] can do and keeping my body and
[1:00:22] uh you know and now we all want
[1:00:24] discipline right but paul was taking it
[1:00:26] to the wrong he was
[1:00:26] doing it for himself he was he had
[1:00:29] confidence in his flesh
[1:00:31] god took the one who was most interested
[1:00:33] in trusting in himself
[1:00:34] and god humbled him in order to show him
[1:00:38] the the that what god can do god can
[1:00:41] take
[1:00:42] the person who trusts in his flesh and
[1:00:44] make him the one who trusts in the holy
[1:00:45] spirit more than anything else praise
[1:00:47] god
[1:00:49] hallelujah and so nobody nobody can say
[1:00:52] they had a harder battle than paul
[1:00:54] paul had the hardest battle he said
[1:00:56] because if anybody was tempted to
[1:00:58] to be a legalist it was me and i was the
[1:01:01] best legalist
[1:01:03] oh goodness so god takes the legalists
[1:01:07] who work the hardest he said i'm gonna
[1:01:08] make you
[1:01:09] not trust in your flesh i'm gonna i'm
[1:01:11] gonna put weakness in your flesh right
[1:01:13] remember god god told the demon okay
[1:01:15] buffeting devil
[1:01:16] yes go down and torment paul's eyes go
[1:01:19] ahead
[1:01:20] to keep him humble
[1:01:23] first thing about that he's cried three
[1:01:26] times god take this devil away and jesus
[1:01:27] said you need it to keep you humble
[1:01:30] that's how that's how much this guy had
[1:01:32] physical strength
[1:01:36] he said i was the pharisee affair you
[1:01:38] know what a pharisee means separator
[1:01:40] he was so separated from the gentiles
[1:01:43] and that's the one god sent him to
[1:01:45] amen he thought he was so much better
[1:01:47] than that a bunch of holy
[1:01:49] unholy rollers look how great look how
[1:01:51] holy i am
[1:01:52] jesus said now you go preach to him
[1:01:54] praise god and if anybody can know grace
[1:01:57] it was paul praise god oh what a choice
[1:02:00] from god amen
[1:02:01] the man who trusted in his cleanness of
[1:02:03] his flesh
[1:02:04] sent to the unclean to tell them don't
[1:02:06] trust in your flesh
[1:02:08] get away from the things of the flesh
[1:02:10] and trust in the holy spirit
[1:02:11] stop feeding on the world and dirty
[1:02:13] things and feed on holy things
[1:02:17] what a choice
[1:02:22] if anybody could have bragged on their
[1:02:25] self-righteousness nobody could brag
[1:02:27] more than paul
[1:02:29] nobody was more self-righteous or
[1:02:31] legalistic than paul
[1:02:32] a church that'd be like me coming today
[1:02:34] and saying i'm so much better than
[1:02:36] brother amen
[1:02:37] i'm so much better than sister seldom so
[1:02:40] look what i did
[1:02:41] i did this anytime we brag and
[1:02:44] uh and think we're better than somebody
[1:02:46] else right
[1:02:47] anytime we do that we've got a
[1:02:49] legalistic spirit on us
[1:02:51] right because that's what legalism is
[1:02:53] it's confidence
[1:02:54] in your ability praise god
[1:03:01] let's not trust in our flesh
[1:03:04] right because i think we're all pretty
[1:03:06] much aware that our flesh fails often
[1:03:09] praise god bye oh i hate the flesh i was
[1:03:12] just can't wait to get a new body praise
[1:03:14] god can't wait to get a new body
[1:03:16] ah i just battle them all day long
[1:03:22] he said if anybody thought they could
[1:03:23] trust in the flesh i could trust more
[1:03:27] he was circumcised on the eighth day now
[1:03:29] there's a a
[1:03:30] commentator that says that was a rare
[1:03:32] thing in
[1:03:33] judaism the bible commanded boys to be
[1:03:36] circumcised on the eighth day but most
[1:03:37] didn't
[1:03:38] because of distance they would just say
[1:03:40] well next time we get to the temple
[1:03:42] they would do it but paul said i was
[1:03:44] circumcised on the eighth day
[1:03:46] i was a special separated boy my parents
[1:03:49] really believed the law of god most jews
[1:03:52] couldn't say that
[1:03:55] so they're bragging about circumcision
[1:03:56] and paul's like i was actually
[1:03:58] circumcised on the right day
[1:04:00] i'm not trusting that i'm trusting in
[1:04:02] the circumcision of the heart
[1:04:05] i don't know yeah that's a circumcision
[1:04:07] i'm trusting it when jesus
[1:04:09] took away my desire for the world and
[1:04:12] gave me desire for the righteousness of
[1:04:14] god
[1:04:14] amen that's a that's the circumcision
[1:04:17] i'm trusting in
[1:04:21] oh thank you lord he said of the stock
[1:04:24] of israel the tribe of benjamin
[1:04:26] that was saul right that was even king
[1:04:28] saul's
[1:04:29] stock there and hebrew of the hebrews
[1:04:33] he was the jewish message believer of
[1:04:35] all the message believers
[1:04:37] he was the cream of the crop we'd say
[1:04:40] oh my goodness as touching the law of
[1:04:42] pharisee a separativist
[1:04:44] he separated as much every every jot and
[1:04:47] tittle every little
[1:04:48] detail he was totally separate from
[1:04:52] gentiles
[1:04:54] concerning zeal persecuting the church
[1:04:59] touching the righteousness which is in
[1:05:01] the law blameless
[1:05:03] this is a man that studied and read the
[1:05:05] word of god day and night
[1:05:07] to make sure he was doing the right
[1:05:09] thing
[1:05:11] and this was all by his own ability
[1:05:14] church
[1:05:14] by his own ability
[1:05:18] i hope we can understand the difference
[1:05:20] now between our ability
[1:05:21] and god's love because remember remember
[1:05:24] first corinthians 13
[1:05:25] you can give your body think about that
[1:05:26] you can give your body to be
[1:05:28] burned and not have love and it doesn't
[1:05:32] help you at all
[1:05:33] we've seen that a couple years ago there
[1:05:34] was some riot going on a couple years
[1:05:36] ago and
[1:05:37] some man set himself on fire burned
[1:05:38] himself i thought what cause was that
[1:05:41] what cause i don't remember the cause
[1:05:44] now it was such a small little
[1:05:46] to him it was great but i'm talking
[1:05:47] about and that wasn't worth your life
[1:05:51] the bible said you can give away all
[1:05:53] your goods and give them to the poor
[1:05:56] but if you don't have love it doesn't
[1:05:58] profit you anything
[1:06:01] so there must be a huge difference
[1:06:02] between you know being motivated and
[1:06:05] zealous for something there must be a
[1:06:07] difference between human motivation
[1:06:09] and the love of god and there is it's
[1:06:12] selfless agape means selfless right
[1:06:14] god's own love in other words i'm doing
[1:06:18] this
[1:06:18] not because uh i'm gonna get anything in
[1:06:21] return i'm doing this just because i
[1:06:23] love someone else
[1:06:24] just because i care about someone else
[1:06:28] i'm not gonna get any glory i'm not
[1:06:30] gonna get any uh hoopla
[1:06:32] i'm not gonna get uh there's not gonna
[1:06:33] be a facebook post about me you know
[1:06:36] i'm doing this all because i love jesus
[1:06:39] amen
[1:06:41] but paul did all this because he was
[1:06:45] zealous he thought it was right
[1:06:48] all of his own ability
[1:06:52] my look at verse 7 here
[1:07:00] so no man could have trusted more in the
[1:07:02] flesh no man could have been a better
[1:07:04] legalist than paul
[1:07:13] before we read that i'll just share one
[1:07:14] time uh
[1:07:16] one time i was talking with a brother
[1:07:17] and uh
[1:07:19] he was asking me what do you struggle
[1:07:20] with brother jesse and i said you're
[1:07:22] talking on the phone and
[1:07:25] i realized at that moment i'd struggle
[1:07:27] with being critical of other people
[1:07:29] in times of my life i battled that being
[1:07:30] critical
[1:07:32] like uh thinking i was better than other
[1:07:34] people
[1:07:35] yeah even since i've been in the message
[1:07:36] i'm you know i've had to repent at times
[1:07:40] and when he asked me that that's what
[1:07:41] came to me yeah
[1:07:43] there's times i get so zealous
[1:07:46] that i don't really mix it with much
[1:07:48] mercy
[1:07:50] and i've just seen it in my life now i'm
[1:07:52] just being honest with you
[1:07:54] i've there's been times i've been i've
[1:07:56] been really critical about people
[1:07:57] struggling with that and then
[1:07:59] years later i won't battle that for
[1:08:01] years years later i'll start battling
[1:08:03] that and i'm like
[1:08:03] i'll think wow mercy
[1:08:07] i think i was a little too harsh i don't
[1:08:09] think i had enough compassion
[1:08:13] so how many want to be open to being
[1:08:15] more compassionate praise god
[1:08:20] paul's balling out the dogs right he's
[1:08:22] but there's times he said there's things
[1:08:24] that i do
[1:08:25] he said oh wretched man that i am see
[1:08:26] how see i will go on me
[1:08:29] go on these crazy roller coaster rides
[1:08:32] sometimes we're so zealous we get a
[1:08:34] little too far
[1:08:37] and then we get humbled and paul
[1:08:41] says oh wretched man that i am but
[1:08:42] thanks be to god who gives us the
[1:08:44] victory through our lord jesus christ
[1:08:47] in church we can trust this if we really
[1:08:49] repent in our hearts and if
[1:08:51] if god and if we confess our sin and we
[1:08:53] truly are sorry
[1:08:54] then jesus cleanses us from all
[1:08:56] unrighteousness
[1:08:58] because we confess our sins and then
[1:09:01] we're careful the next time
[1:09:03] when we talk about a certain person or
[1:09:05] situation right
[1:09:07] i'm not the only one brother ram said a
[1:09:09] critical spirit haunted him
[1:09:11] there's times he was overly critical
[1:09:15] i mean we all have faults right we all
[1:09:16] have failures and
[1:09:18] troubles so verse seven
[1:09:22] but what things were gained to me those
[1:09:24] i counted loss
[1:09:26] for christ and there's 40 minutes ah
[1:09:27] that was 40 minutes already
[1:09:29] uh let me set it for 10. i'll finish up
[1:09:31] here
[1:09:33] verse 7. but what things were gained to
[1:09:37] me see all those things
[1:09:38] can be a gain to you look what i did
[1:09:41] look what i did i was born i was born in
[1:09:45] this family
[1:09:47] i was zealous for my denomination
[1:09:52] look what all the things i've done i i
[1:09:54] separated myself totally from anybody
[1:09:56] wouldn't even
[1:09:56] go out to talk to anybody i was so holy
[1:09:59] i just stayed in my house all day
[1:10:01] and prayed and passed it all day
[1:10:04] he said what things that were gained to
[1:10:05] me those i have counted loss
[1:10:08] for christ so thinking he was special
[1:10:11] because he was circumcised
[1:10:12] paul said i've lost that i'm not special
[1:10:15] because i was circumcised
[1:10:19] yay doubtless and i count all these
[1:10:21] things but lost
[1:10:23] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[1:10:25] christ jesus my lord
[1:10:27] think about that how many people think
[1:10:28] they're special because they're born in
[1:10:30] a certain family
[1:10:31] oh i was born in the branham family or
[1:10:33] i'm born in the fiscal family now i'm
[1:10:35] not saying they do
[1:10:37] i'm born in the smith family i'll just
[1:10:38] use my family
[1:10:40] see people think we're just we're
[1:10:41] special because we're in family it don't
[1:10:43] have nothing to do with
[1:10:44] it right let's not be prideful
[1:10:47] let's not take confidence in our flesh
[1:10:49] let's have no confidence in our flesh
[1:10:51] and rely totally on the holy spirit
[1:10:54] praise god and
[1:10:58] do you all still believe this is our
[1:10:59] state of the lord you still believe it's
[1:11:01] worth
[1:11:02] god jesus given to the church for 2000
[1:11:04] years you still think it's worth it
[1:11:06] you still think it's powerful and
[1:11:08] effective absolutely
[1:11:10] absolutely we can't trust in anything
[1:11:13] of our flesh of our ability we must
[1:11:16] trust in the righteousness of christ and
[1:11:19] walk by faith
[1:11:20] like we saw the just shall live by faith
[1:11:24] so when god's revealed something to you
[1:11:25] that's faith right he gives you
[1:11:27] assurance that it's right then you live
[1:11:30] by that
[1:11:32] the just shall live by faith
[1:11:38] he says i'm going back to verse 8. yay
[1:11:39] doubtless so without doubt
[1:11:41] i count all things but lost for the
[1:11:43] excellency of the knowledge of christ
[1:11:45] jesus my lord
[1:11:46] see just knowing him church just knowing
[1:11:49] christ
[1:11:50] the knowledge of him
[1:11:53] for whom i've suffered the loss of all
[1:11:56] things
[1:11:57] and you count them but done that i may
[1:12:01] win
[1:12:01] christ all right what a beautiful
[1:12:04] beautiful scripture here
[1:12:07] so paul lost everything he lost his
[1:12:09] previous church membership
[1:12:11] some of us have done the same some of us
[1:12:13] have lost homes
[1:12:14] you know roofs over our heads
[1:12:18] he suffered the loss of everything to
[1:12:21] win
[1:12:22] christ so look look he goes now to his
[1:12:25] free more agency right because he says i
[1:12:28] can win it
[1:12:30] well now that deals with his free more
[1:12:32] his own will
[1:12:34] right simon was talking about the
[1:12:35] sovereign will of god god that's true
[1:12:38] when we look at god's sovereign will
[1:12:39] that's what god is going to accomplish
[1:12:41] something
[1:12:41] but down here when we're on earth a lot
[1:12:44] of it is about
[1:12:45] understanding how to get our will to
[1:12:47] obey god's will
[1:12:49] like i'm not a robot just i'll do i just
[1:12:52] do whatever god wants me to do
[1:12:53] right we have our own choices and we got
[1:12:56] to make our own decisions
[1:12:57] but paul said i will suffer losing
[1:13:00] everything
[1:13:01] that i may win christ jesus amen
[1:13:05] hallelujah that word win means to
[1:13:07] acquire to gain
[1:13:10] to escape from evil to spare yourself
[1:13:14] from judgment
[1:13:18] to win someone over into the kingdom of
[1:13:20] god to
[1:13:21] gain one to fa to faith in christ to
[1:13:24] gain christ's favor and fellowship
[1:13:26] praise god
[1:13:27] amen hallelujah you don't give a
[1:13:30] fellowship to everybody
[1:13:31] praise god right go to a denomination of
[1:13:35] church sometime soon
[1:13:36] see what kind of spirit's there sister
[1:13:37] karen was telling me she said yeah that
[1:13:39] she goes she visits other churches you
[1:13:41] know with family
[1:13:43] she was saying yeah there's there's nice
[1:13:45] things there she said she just said on
[1:13:46] sunday she said but god's spirit is here
[1:13:50] praise god when was the last time you
[1:13:52] went well i know some families get to go
[1:13:54] some more than others
[1:13:55] it's been a couple years since i went
[1:13:58] right it's the fellowship
[1:14:00] the they don't enter into real intimacy
[1:14:02] praise god where god
[1:14:04] can really change their lives and speak
[1:14:06] to their lives and really sanctify them
[1:14:08] that's the main issue right god wants to
[1:14:09] justify them
[1:14:10] sanctify them and fill them with the
[1:14:12] holy ghost they never get that
[1:14:14] intimacy but we know him in the intimate
[1:14:16] ways praise god we know what his heart
[1:14:18] really desires amen
[1:14:20] not just a church membership but an
[1:14:21] everyday fellowship with him praise god
[1:14:24] where you open the door say yeah come on
[1:14:26] in jesus every room you can look in
[1:14:28] every room in my life
[1:14:30] you can look in you can look in my
[1:14:33] bedroom
[1:14:34] jesus you can look in my kitchen praise
[1:14:37] god
[1:14:39] you can look in my parlor my living room
[1:14:41] jesus you can look in my closets
[1:14:44] right jesus you can go through every
[1:14:46] room in my house
[1:14:48] see but the main thing he wants to sit
[1:14:49] down and have some fellowship praise god
[1:14:52] he wants to sup together he wants to
[1:14:53] feed you the word of god he wants to
[1:14:55] break the word
[1:14:56] of life right and feed us on
[1:14:59] his precious word
[1:15:05] so see church when we go through
[1:15:06] suffering we have to remember we're
[1:15:08] suffering
[1:15:09] we're losing things in the natural but
[1:15:11] we're gaining so much more in the
[1:15:13] spiritual
[1:15:15] praise god you might lose a few
[1:15:18] friendships here but i'll tell you god
[1:15:19] will give you way better friends
[1:15:21] if you stay true to god right i've seen
[1:15:23] that to be true over all these years
[1:15:25] i lost people that i thought my they're
[1:15:27] really they're my closest friends but
[1:15:28] god's given me way better friends
[1:15:31] the best friends you want to have praise
[1:15:33] god
[1:15:35] they can all agree on one thing jesus
[1:15:37] christ is lord he's the word
[1:15:38] he died for us he raised for us and he's
[1:15:41] coming back soon praise god
[1:15:43] and his word all of his word needs to be
[1:15:45] preached and it needs to be lived amen
[1:15:48] hallelujah praise god he said i count
[1:15:51] everything
[1:15:52] else dung anything i can do is dung it's
[1:15:55] any animal excrement
[1:15:58] any rubbish any worthless and detestable
[1:16:01] thing
[1:16:03] that's what you're that's what your
[1:16:05] flesh works are they're just
[1:16:07] dumb he said i count them lost
[1:16:10] i count them as done then i may win
[1:16:13] christ jesus
[1:16:15] praise god
[1:16:18] let me find a place to close here so
[1:16:21] winning christ
[1:16:23] is knowing him praise god winning christ
[1:16:27] is knowing christ
[1:16:32] i want to look at a few scriptures here
[1:16:33] i look at my notes i don't forget
[1:16:34] something here
[1:16:43] yeah let's go just go a couple more
[1:16:44] scriptures here
[1:16:47] verse 9
[1:16:50] and be found in him where was paul found
[1:16:53] he wasn't found in the pharisee
[1:16:54] denomination his old church
[1:16:56] he wasn't found in legalism he was found
[1:17:00] in christ he was found in god's word for
[1:17:03] that hour
[1:17:05] i found in him and the i'm sorry
[1:17:08] and not having my own righteousness
[1:17:10] which is of the law
[1:17:12] but that which is through the faith of
[1:17:14] christ
[1:17:15] the righteousness which is of god
[1:17:18] by faith so you have a righteousness
[1:17:22] that's by works by flesh but you
[1:17:25] also have the right righteousness which
[1:17:27] is by faith so let me just close with
[1:17:30] that
[1:17:32] righteousness by your works is something
[1:17:34] you can do that makes you feel holy
[1:17:38] but righteousness by faith is something
[1:17:40] god reveals to you
[1:17:42] that you do right that god
[1:17:45] leads you to do because faith is a
[1:17:48] revelation
[1:17:50] faith is a making known an unveiling of
[1:17:52] god's will
[1:17:53] and then you trust in that so whenever
[1:17:56] god reveals something to you
[1:17:58] and you obey it and you accept it it's
[1:18:00] god's righteousness
[1:18:02] in you praise god but when you just do
[1:18:05] it because you think you're holier
[1:18:07] like with christmas it's coming up here
[1:18:08] pretty soon you know the same thing on
[1:18:10] facebook you know
[1:18:12] they have more christmas battles on
[1:18:14] facebook coming up this year
[1:18:15] but that's one thing where people if
[1:18:16] they don't do it sometimes if they're
[1:18:18] not careful
[1:18:19] they feel like they're more holy right
[1:18:22] they think they're more holy because
[1:18:23] they don't put up a tree or they don't
[1:18:25] give a gift
[1:18:27] well if you think you're more holy
[1:18:29] because you do that the bible said
[1:18:30] that's a liberty that's great
[1:18:31] but don't exalt yourself above people
[1:18:33] that may do something like that
[1:18:36] i just got an email about what do you
[1:18:38] believe about christmas so i sent the
[1:18:39] guy the link i haven't heard back from
[1:18:40] him but
[1:18:42] it's a great balance
[1:18:47] so it's righteousness which is of god by
[1:18:50] faith
[1:18:51] what is righteousness it's the state
[1:18:54] of him who is righteous acceptable to
[1:18:58] god
[1:18:59] praise god it's integrity virtue
[1:19:02] the correct way of thinking and feeling
[1:19:06] the justice or the virtue which gives
[1:19:09] each
[1:19:10] is due praise god in other words you are
[1:19:12] acceptable in the sight of god
[1:19:15] with god's righteousness god accepts you
[1:19:17] and says that's my son
[1:19:18] that's my daughter that's my child
[1:19:21] praise god
[1:19:23] he said that's what i'm trusting in i
[1:19:25] don't have my own righteousness
[1:19:28] i only have the righteousness of christ
[1:19:30] but i've had to suffer
[1:19:32] the loss of everything in order to gain
[1:19:34] it
[1:19:35] let's stand to our feet praise god
[1:19:42] so as we stand musicians if you want to
[1:19:44] come by god's grace you can come
[1:19:50] so what is your righteousness based on
[1:19:52] tonight
[1:19:54] are you feeling righteous and accepted
[1:19:56] by god because of
[1:19:57] what your flesh can accomplish or
[1:20:00] do you feel god's righteousness where
[1:20:02] you see god reveal something to you
[1:20:04] and you obey it because you know it's
[1:20:06] his will praise god
[1:20:08] that's the kind of righteousness i want
[1:20:11] i want the same kind paul had
[1:20:13] where i i suffer the loss of everything
[1:20:16] i used to trust in
[1:20:18] but now i trust in the righteousness
[1:20:20] which is of god
[1:20:22] by faith in christ jesus praise god
[1:20:25] let's bow our heads here tonight
[1:20:32] i'm gonna say brother jesse pray for me
[1:20:34] that i'll trust in the holy spirit
[1:20:36] i'll trust in christ and not in my own
[1:20:38] flesh
