[0:03] this six seal is the Tribulation period
[0:06] that's what takes place
[0:08] the bride has gone I think
[0:14] [Music]
[0:16] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:18] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:21] this video is to prove that brother
[0:23] Branham did not plagiarize Clarence
[0:26] Larkin Charles Tays Russell nor Uriah
[0:29] Smith on The Sixth Seal
[0:30] [Music]
[0:32] from the outset let me state that this
[0:34] Sixth Seal is the seal that is most
[0:37] similar of all the seals between brother
[0:40] Branham and Clarence Larkin I found four
[0:43] differences between brother Branham and
[0:44] Clarence Larkin on The Sixth Seal and I
[0:47] estimate that brother Branham likely
[0:49] used at least six of Larkin's teachings
[0:51] on The Sixth Seal which this video will
[0:54] cover
[0:55] and I believe brother Bram likely forgot
[0:57] to reference Clarence Larkin on these
[0:59] six uses just like I think brother
[1:01] Brandon forgot to reference him on his
[1:03] uses regarding the future home but it
[1:06] should be noted that brother Branham
[1:07] referenced Larkin on Daniel's 70th week
[1:10] in 1961 and then he did State he read
[1:13] Larkin's work on the Seven Seals a year
[1:15] after he preached the seals in 1964.
[1:19] I'm very grateful to Dr Larkin of his
[1:23] views
[1:24] I'm grateful to all these great Scholars
[1:28] for the reviews on this and in reading
[1:31] them it enlightens me much that I can
[1:34] find places that looks right
[1:37] then just leaving it at that and
[1:39] pursuing after a while we preach on the
[1:42] seals not knowing what the seals was and
[1:45] I read Mr Larkin I'd read all so many
[1:48] different ones of their commentaries on
[1:51] this but
[1:53] before getting into the details of The
[1:55] Sixth Seal I just want to remind our
[1:57] viewers that on the first five seals
[2:01] there were 29 differences between
[2:03] brother Branham and Clarence Larkin and
[2:05] Charles Taze Russell proving beyond a
[2:08] shadow of a doubt that brother Brown did
[2:09] not plagiarize Clarence Larkin and
[2:11] Charles Tay's Russell on the first five
[2:13] seals
[2:15] and friends here's a visual of how I
[2:17] calculated the 29 differences between
[2:19] brother Branham Clarence Larkin and
[2:21] Charles Taze Russell on the first five
[2:23] seals so in the first seal brother
[2:25] Brown's accuser only compared brother
[2:27] Branham and Charles Russell and yet they
[2:30] had six differences brother Ram's
[2:32] accuser didn't even compare brother
[2:34] Branham with Clarence Larkin or Uriah
[2:36] Smith on the first seal on the second
[2:39] seal brother Ram's accusers accused
[2:41] brother Branham of plagiarizing Charles
[2:43] Taze Russell yet again there were six
[2:45] differences on the third seal again
[2:47] brother Ram's accuser used Charles Tays
[2:50] Russell but there were seven differences
[2:51] on the third seal between brother
[2:53] Branham and Charles Taze Russell on the
[2:55] fourth seal there were seven differences
[2:57] again between brother Branham and
[2:58] Charles Taze Russell
[3:00] then finally on the fifth seal brother
[3:02] Ram's accuser said brother Brandon
[3:04] plagiarized Larkin but there were three
[3:06] differences between brother Branham and
[3:08] Clarence Larkin on the fifth seal and
[3:10] brother Ram's accuser didn't mention
[3:12] Charles stage Russell know Uriah Smith
[3:14] on the fifth seal so adding up six and
[3:17] six is twelve twelve plus seven is
[3:19] nineteen nineteen plus seven is 26 26
[3:22] plus 3 is 29. there's 29 differences on
[3:26] the first five seals between brother
[3:28] Branham and Charles Taze Russell and
[3:30] Clarence Larkin but there are more
[3:32] differences on the first five seals
[3:34] between brother Branham and Clarence
[3:36] Larkin and Uriah Smith and also Charles
[3:38] Tays Russell which brother Ram's accuser
[3:40] ignored
[3:43] regarding the Sixth Seal brother Ram's
[3:46] accuser compared brother Branham and
[3:48] Clarence Larkin and yet I found four
[3:50] differences between brother Branham and
[3:52] Larkin so 29 differences plus four more
[3:55] equals 33 so now there's 33 differences
[3:58] between brother Branham and Clarence
[4:00] Larkin and Charles Tays Russell on the
[4:02] first six seals
[4:04] and again I'm not counting the other two
[4:06] ministers that brother Ram's accuser
[4:08] left out on all six seals so the total
[4:12] number of differences would be much
[4:14] larger probably 40 50 or even 60.
[4:19] first let's look at the accusation
[4:22] one of Brothers accusers made a video
[4:24] about The Sixth Seal and he called the
[4:27] theft of The Sixth Seal at the 330 Mark
[4:30] he said quote what is painfully obvious
[4:32] is that William Raynham took his sermon
[4:34] on The Sixth Seal directly from Larkin's
[4:36] book he gave Larkin no credit but rather
[4:38] said that he got his Revelation directly
[4:40] from God
[4:41] William Branham did not mention either
[4:43] men as the source of his Revelation this
[4:46] is what is referred to as plagiarism in
[4:49] every instance William Branham stated
[4:50] that his Revelation was Supernatural and
[4:52] came directly from God end quote
[4:56] so here's a few of my initial reactions
[4:58] first I do believe brother Branham used
[5:00] at least six of Larkin's teachings on
[5:02] The Sixth Seal including nearly two
[5:05] complete pages about Jesus's Olivet
[5:07] discourse in Matthew chapter 24.
[5:11] but the four differences brother Branham
[5:12] had with Larkin on The Sixth Seal are
[5:15] substantial as you'll soon see
[5:18] second it's true brother Branham did not
[5:20] give Larkin Credit in The Sixth Seal
[5:22] sermon
[5:23] but I think he likely forgot
[5:26] a year later though in 1964 brother
[5:29] Branham said he had read Larkin's work
[5:31] on the Seven Seals
[5:34] brother Ram said he read Larkin's work
[5:36] on the seals and other authors so this
[5:39] is where I get the understanding that
[5:40] brother Branham likely forgot to mention
[5:42] that he used Larkin's work on the Sixth
[5:44] Seal let's listen to the quote So based
[5:47] upon brother Brown's past Integrity of
[5:49] referring to historians I believe
[5:51] brother Ram most likely forgot to
[5:53] mention that he used Larkin's work
[5:54] during this Sixth Seal sermon for
[5:57] example during the church ages sermon I
[5:59] have a video about it a brother Branham
[6:01] referenced historians over 20 times some
[6:04] by name some by book title and others
[6:06] just by the word historian brother brand
[6:08] was quick to reference historians he was
[6:10] happy to reference historian so brother
[6:12] random was not a plagiarist also
[6:14] remember brother random mentioned Samuel
[6:15] Schmucker in the seals and Uriah Smith
[6:18] among other books that he read regarding
[6:21] the Seven Seals brother Branham had a
[6:23] pattern of recognizing historians and
[6:25] preachers for their ideas that he used
[6:27] of course he wasn't perfect
[6:29] and I don't believe there is a preacher
[6:31] that is perfect on always recognizing
[6:33] where he gets his thoughts and
[6:34] information from but just like in the
[6:36] future Home Series it seems brother
[6:38] Brandon forgot to reference Larkin
[6:40] during this Sixth Seal sermon so I
[6:43] believe it's unfair to say brother bran
[6:44] was a plagiarist based upon his
[6:46] outstanding Christian character his
[6:48] humble Christian Spirit he probably just
[6:50] forgot to reference Clarence Larkin on
[6:52] The Sixth Seal
[6:54] next brother Ram's accuser said brother
[6:56] random said he got his Revelation
[6:58] directly from God
[6:59] I believe this was a true statement from
[7:01] Brother Branham because as you'll see
[7:02] the four differences between brother
[7:04] Branham and Larkin are substantial
[7:07] additionally brother Branham gave us
[7:09] very few details about what the
[7:11] Revelation from God entailed on the
[7:13] Sixth Seal
[7:15] brother Branham could have meant that
[7:16] the Holy Ghost directed him to Larkin's
[7:18] work on the Sixth Seal for at least six
[7:21] of the details brother Branham used from
[7:23] Larkin's work and if God did direct
[7:25] brother Ram to Clarence Larkin's work on
[7:27] the Sixth Seal that would be the same as
[7:28] God directing brother Branham to Samuel
[7:31] schmucker's work on the second seal to
[7:33] prove the Roman Catholic Church's guilt
[7:36] in slaughtering over 68 million
[7:38] Protestants and also would be the same
[7:40] as God directing brother Branham to the
[7:42] right historical references he needed to
[7:45] preach the revelation of the seven
[7:47] Church ages in 1960. so the fact that
[7:50] brother Branham used some of Larkin's
[7:52] work on the Sixth Seal only backs up
[7:55] what brother Ram's Ministry was
[7:57] prophesied to do according to the
[7:58] scripture program's Ministry was to
[8:00] finish the mystery of God and the
[8:03] revelation of the mystery was already in
[8:04] the scripture God was slowly restoring
[8:06] the truth that was lost during the
[8:08] church ages such as justification
[8:10] through Martin Luther sanctification
[8:12] through John Wesley the gifts of the
[8:14] Spirit through William Seymour and
[8:16] brother Ryan was gathering up all these
[8:18] Loose Ends putting them together in the
[8:20] right scriptural order with sound
[8:22] Doctrine from the scripture and he tied
[8:24] all the loose ends together as he said
[8:26] in this quote on the first seal let's
[8:28] listen to the quote
[8:36] [Music]
[8:39] receive a messenger
[8:42] that will take all those loose ends out
[8:45] there and reveal the whole secret of God
[8:49] [Applause]
[8:53] also let me say that this is the first
[8:55] time that Larkin got a seal right but
[8:57] only partially
[8:59] so Larkin's percentage on correctly
[9:01] interpreting the seals thus far is less
[9:03] than 16 percent because one out of six
[9:06] is 16 percent
[9:07] but Larkin wasn't completely right on
[9:10] the Sixth Seal as we'll soon see
[9:13] and recall that all of Larkin's seals
[9:16] happened during the 70th week of Daniel
[9:18] or the seven year tribulation period so
[9:20] that means the first five seals between
[9:22] brother Branham and Larkin were
[9:23] extremely different for example Larkin
[9:26] said the oil and wine of the third seal
[9:28] were literal oil and wine that Believers
[9:30] would survive upon during a war during
[9:33] the Great Tribulation period this is
[9:35] completely different from Brother
[9:36] Branham brother random said the oil and
[9:38] wine represented the baptism of the Holy
[9:40] Ghost and the stimulation of Revelation
[9:42] from the Holy Ghost during the Dark Ages
[9:48] so now let's compare brother Branham and
[9:49] Clarence Larkin on The Sixth Seal
[9:53] here's the four differences between
[9:54] Larkin and brother Branham on The Sixth
[9:57] Seal the first difference is that Larkin
[9:59] said the six seal is one small event in
[10:02] the first three and a half years of the
[10:04] Great Tribulation period this is
[10:06] different from other Branham brother
[10:08] Branham said The Sixth Seal is the whole
[10:10] seven year tribulation period
[10:13] the second difference is that Clarence
[10:16] Larkin had the battle of Armageddon
[10:19] separate from The Sixth Seal
[10:21] The Sixth Seal was well before the
[10:23] battle of Armageddon on Larkin's
[10:25] timeline
[10:26] this is different from other Branham
[10:28] brother Branham said Armageddon ended
[10:30] the Sixth Seal
[10:33] the battle of Armageddon takes place on
[10:35] this side see all right and when the
[10:38] tribulation period is in now
[10:42] and third Larkin had Moses and Elijah's
[10:45] Ministry after the Sixth Seal in the
[10:48] second half of the Great Tribulation
[10:50] period this is different from Brother
[10:51] Branham brother Branham had Moses and
[10:54] Elijah initiating The Sixth Seal and
[10:56] then ministering for only the first
[10:58] three and a half years of The Seven Year
[11:00] tribulation period
[11:02] and now here's these two prophets in
[11:04] here with the word of God and make sure
[11:07] they want to have this
[11:12] houses
[11:15] reimbursemented again
[11:18] amen
[11:19] ities
[11:32] [Music]
[11:37] praise the Lord
[11:55] [Music]
[12:02] is your six seal coming open see
[12:05] and the same time the tribulation Falls
[12:08] of all fat people and while the
[12:12] tribulation is falling in there comes
[12:14] these two prophets of Revelations 11 to
[12:17] preach the gospel to them and they
[12:19] preach a thousand 103 score dates see
[12:24] well that's exactly what 30 days the
[12:27] month like the real character has is it
[12:28] is exactly three and one half years
[12:30] that's
[12:32] now the proof of these claims are found
[12:33] on page 132 and 133 of Clarence Larkin's
[12:38] book called dispensational Truth
[12:40] I have a copy of this book this is a
[12:42] beautifully illustrated book and here's
[12:44] a screenshot so you can see it now if
[12:46] you zoom out beginning on the left here
[12:48] we see the Rapture of the church and
[12:50] Clarence Larkin says that is in
[12:52] Revelation chapter four and five
[12:55] and then we have the first half of the
[12:57] week the first three and a half years
[13:00] you have the middle of the week Larkin
[13:02] shows and then the second half of the
[13:03] week
[13:05] and then after that of course at the end
[13:07] of the second half of the week is the
[13:09] battle of Armageddon and then the
[13:10] millennium
[13:11] now as we look at the map Larkin
[13:13] believed the Book of Revelation goes in
[13:15] chronological order so here are the
[13:17] Seven Seals at the very beginning of the
[13:19] first half of the week
[13:21] the first three and a half years of the
[13:23] Great Tribulation period here's the
[13:25] first seal second seal third seal four
[13:27] seal fifth seal and there's The Sixth
[13:30] Seal the seventh seal is after what
[13:33] Larkin called the interval between the
[13:35] sixth and seventh seal
[13:36] so this map plainly shows The Sixth Seal
[13:39] right here is one small event within the
[13:42] Great Tribulation period
[13:45] but brother random said The Sixth Seal
[13:47] is the entire Great Tribulation period
[13:54] let's listen to the quote
[14:00] that's what takes place
[14:02] the bride has gone
[14:05] think
[14:07] so that's proof of the first difference
[14:10] between brother Branham and Clarence
[14:12] Larkin
[14:13] here's proof of the second difference
[14:15] between brother Branham and Larkin
[14:16] Larkin had the battle of Armageddon
[14:18] separate from The Sixth Seal so again
[14:21] here's the Sixth Seal on Clarence
[14:23] Larkin's timeline it's in the first half
[14:25] of Daniel's 70th week
[14:27] now we slide over here to the right of
[14:30] this chart and the battle of Armageddon
[14:32] is here at the end the very end of the
[14:34] Great Tribulation period
[14:36] now of course the battle of Armageddon
[14:38] is in the right place but Larkin 60 of
[14:41] course is wrong the six seals the entire
[14:43] Great Tribulation period
[14:46] here's proof of the third difference
[14:47] between brother Branham and Clarence
[14:49] Larkin
[14:50] here towards the middle of Daniel's 70th
[14:52] week we have the ministry of the two
[14:55] witnesses as you can see here's Moses
[14:57] and Elijah and their Ministry takes
[14:59] place after the Sixth Seal here's the
[15:02] Sixth Seal on Larkin's timeline and of
[15:04] course we see Moses and Elijah happening
[15:07] after the Sixth Seal and of course
[15:10] brother Ram differed brother Branham
[15:11] said Moses and Elijah initiate the Sixth
[15:14] Seal because they have the power to
[15:16] start the six seal which are the
[15:18] physical changes the convulsions of the
[15:20] Earth the interruption of nature as God
[15:22] begins to pour out his wrath upon the
[15:25] unrepentant people on the Earth
[15:29] and friends I just found a fourth
[15:30] difference while I'm recording this here
[15:32] Larkin has the 144 000 Jews sealed
[15:35] between the six and seven seals
[15:39] but of course that's wrong they cannot
[15:40] get sealed until after the ministry of
[15:43] Moses and Elijah because Moses and
[15:45] Elijah have to preach Christ to the
[15:47] blinded Jews
[15:49] and after Moses and Elijah's Rapture
[15:52] Jesus will reveal himself to the 144
[15:55] thousand and then Zechariah Chapter 12
[15:57] and 13 will be fulfilled where there's a
[15:59] fountain open in the House of David and
[16:02] Jews will realize they crucify their
[16:04] Messiah and weep and mourn from house to
[16:06] house and then a nation will be born in
[16:09] one day with the baptism of the Holy
[16:10] Ghost
[16:12] so now that takes us up to 33
[16:14] differences between brother Branham and
[16:16] these three other ministers on the first
[16:18] six seals
[16:22] now let's go over the six times brother
[16:24] Branham seemed to use Clarence Larkin on
[16:27] The Sixth Seal
[16:28] the first use is brother Ram said The
[16:30] Sixth Seal is the day of the Lord or the
[16:32] day of judgment
[16:38] it shall come as a destruction from the
[16:42] almighty what's this six seal open up
[16:45] and of course we find this work in
[16:47] Larkin's book
[16:49] regarding the day of the Lord Larkin
[16:51] said quote in Isaiah 13 verses 9 and 10
[16:54] we read behold the day the Lord cometh
[16:56] cruel both with wrath and fierce anger
[16:59] to lay the land desolate and he shall
[17:01] destroy the Sinners thereof out of it
[17:02] end quote
[17:05] the second similarity is brother random
[17:08] seem to use Larkin's statement that the
[17:11] Sixth Seal had travail pains before the
[17:13] millennial age
[17:15] Larkin said the Great Earthquake the sun
[17:17] becoming as black as sackcloth the moon
[17:20] becoming his blood the Stars falling to
[17:22] heaven the heaven departing as a scroll
[17:24] and every mountain and Island moved out
[17:26] of their place are travail pains before
[17:28] the millennial age
[17:32] and the World of Nature
[17:35] they have mercy yes
[17:42] I said what's the matter she's
[17:44] incredible
[17:46] foreign
[17:52] [Applause]
[18:15] third similarity is that Larkin said
[18:17] Moses and Elijah were the two prophets
[18:19] to Israel
[18:21] and here you can see Moses and Elijah as
[18:23] the two witnesses according to Clarence
[18:25] Larkin
[18:27] on his chart called the tribulation
[18:29] period or Daniel's 70th week
[18:32] the reign of antichrist
[18:35] the four similarities that brother
[18:36] Branham seem to use Larkin's teachings
[18:39] about Jesus preaching the Seven Seals in
[18:41] Matthew 24 at the Olivet discourse
[18:45] here you can see a screenshot of it
[18:47] brother random spoke of Tuesday
[18:49] afternoon April 4th A.D 30. now
[18:59] now soon April the 4th 80 30.
[19:01] and the first two verses took place on
[19:05] the afternoon of the of April the 4th
[19:08] and 80 30 and the third verse taken
[19:11] place on Tuesday evening of the same day
[19:16] well the brand spoke of the threefold
[19:18] question that was asked Jesus
[19:25] are asked by the Jews his disciples
[19:28] three questions asked what what
[19:32] um uh first first was when shall these
[19:36] things be when they won't be one stone
[19:38] left upon another
[19:39] what shall be the sign of thy coming
[19:41] second question
[19:43] and of the end of the world see it
[19:46] there's three questions now that's where
[19:48] many men make their mistake
[19:52] and then brother random showed how the
[19:54] first second third fourth fifth and
[19:57] sixth seals were in Matthew chapter 24.
[20:16] the fifth similarity is that brother
[20:18] Branham read Exodus 10 verses 21-23 and
[20:22] Larkin use those scriptures on The Sixth
[20:25] Seal
[20:26] Larkin said quote we must not forget the
[20:28] great darkness that for three days
[20:30] overspread Egypt in the days before The
[20:32] Exodus Exodus 10 verses 21-23 nor the
[20:36] darkness that settled over Jerusalem and
[20:38] Calvary on the day of the crucifixion of
[20:40] Christ Matthew 27 45 end quote
[20:53] of course Israel was coming out
[20:58] six and finally brother Branham used
[20:59] Isaiah chapter 13 verses 9 and 10 on the
[21:03] Sixth Seal sermon and Clarence Larkin
[21:05] use these scriptures as well
[21:08] Larkin wrote quote in Isaiah 13 verses 9
[21:11] and 10 we read behold the day of the
[21:13] Lord cometh cruel both with wrath and
[21:15] fierce anger to lay the land desolate
[21:17] and he shall destroy the Sinners thereof
[21:19] out of it end quote
[21:30] Bible in itself you know
[21:33] so in conclusion we can see brother
[21:35] Brandon not plagiarize Clarence Larkin
[21:38] on The Sixth Seal brother Branham had at
[21:40] least four differences from Clarence
[21:42] Larkin on The Sixth Seal it's clear he
[21:44] agreed with him and use his work about
[21:46] six times
[21:48] and based upon brother braham's
[21:49] Christian integrity and how he
[21:51] referenced Larkin on Daniel's 70th week
[21:53] it seems brother Brown likely just
[21:55] forgot to reference Larkin on The Sixth
[21:58] Seal and also the future home we also
[22:00] remember that brother Braham differed
[22:01] greatly from both Clarence Larkin and
[22:04] Charles Hayes Russell on the first five
[22:06] seals and we recognize that God gave
[22:09] Clarence Larkin not all but a lot of
[22:11] understanding on The Sixth Seal so we
[22:13] thank God for that
[22:16] and before moving on remember we have to
[22:18] look at these seals as though Larkin
[22:20] finally got one partially right and that
[22:23] brother Branham had all of them right
[22:24] because brother random had thus saith
[22:26] the Lord
[22:27] and brother random seals and the
[22:29] interpretations of the seals do not
[22:31] contradict any other scriptures in the
[22:32] Bible whereas Larkins Russells and Uriah
[22:35] Smith's do contradict other Bible
[22:37] teachings and historical events that
[22:40] take place in the scriptures
[22:42] where the brand was the only one who had
[22:43] thus saith the Lord on all the seals
[22:47] next let's compare William Branham and
[22:49] Charles Taze Russell
[22:51] here's a screenshot of Charles Tay's
[22:53] Russell's work on the Sixth Seal
[22:58] and Friends there's no similarities
[22:59] between brother Branham and Charles Tays
[23:01] Russell on The Sixth Seal
[23:03] Russell said the timing of the first
[23:05] event of The Sixth Seal took place on
[23:07] November 1st
[23:09] 1755. Russell said quote and lo there
[23:12] was a great earthquake literally the
[23:13] great Lisbon earthquake November 1st
[23:16] 1755 which extended over four main
[23:19] square miles shocked all Africa and
[23:21] Western Europe end quote
[23:26] of course brother branham's Sixth Seal
[23:28] hasn't happened yet it's in the future
[23:30] after the Gentile Church Rapture during
[23:32] the seven year Great Tribulation period
[23:34] or Daniel's 70th week also notice
[23:37] Russell's final event of The Sixth Seal
[23:39] when Sinners hide in the rocks and
[23:41] mountains he said it was already
[23:43] underway at the time of the writing of
[23:45] his book in 1917. Russell wrote quote
[23:49] and said to the mountains of rocks fall
[23:51] on us the real fulfillment is already
[23:53] beginning the great the rich and no less
[23:55] the poor seeking to the mountains and
[23:57] rocks and caves for shelter from the
[23:58] darkening storm of trouble which all sea
[24:01] is gathering end quote
[24:06] here's the timeline comparing brother
[24:08] Branham and Charles Taze Russell on The
[24:09] Sixth Seal again you can see there's no
[24:12] plagiarism here
[24:14] Charles Hayes Russell's Sixth Seal was
[24:16] about from 1755 to 1917.
[24:19] and brother Ram six seal has not
[24:21] happened yet it's still during the
[24:23] future
[24:24] the Great Tribulation period
[24:26] and the dates of those seven years is
[24:28] unknown this again vindicates brother
[24:30] Bynum as a genuine Prophet with a
[24:32] different Revelation than Clarence
[24:33] Larkin Charles days Russell and Uriah
[24:36] Smith
[24:38] now let's compare brother Branham and
[24:40] Uriah Smith on The Sixth Seal
[24:44] again there's no similarities between
[24:46] brother Branham and Uriah Smith Uriah
[24:48] Smith was actually very close to Charles
[24:50] Tays Russell and said the first event of
[24:52] The Sixth Seal was November 1st
[24:55] 1775 and he also said the moon became
[24:57] his blood in 1780
[25:00] here's pictures of those pages and I'll
[25:02] read them verbatim by God's grace Smith
[25:05] said quote the Great Earthquake the
[25:07] first event under this seal perhaps the
[25:09] one which marks its opening is a great
[25:11] earthquake as the more probable
[25:13] fulfillment of this prediction we refer
[25:14] to the Great Earthquake of November 1st
[25:17] 1755 known as the earthquake of Lisbon
[25:20] end quote
[25:22] so it seems charlestones Russell got his
[25:25] interpretation of The Sixth Seal from
[25:27] Uriah Smith because Uriah Smith's book
[25:29] was printed earlier in 1903. also Smith
[25:33] said quote the moon became his blood the
[25:35] darkness of the following night May 19
[25:37] 1780 was as unnatural as that of the day
[25:40] had been end quote
[25:45] also in your eismus book he said in 1903
[25:48] the 60 will be completed not far hence
[25:51] and would be immediately followed by the
[25:53] coming of the Lord
[25:55] regarding the last event Uriah Smith
[25:57] said quote we have reached the year 1903
[25:59] 105 years this side the ending of the
[26:02] days and shaking of the powers of heaven
[26:04] will be completed not far hence as other
[26:06] prophecies show and in immediate
[26:09] connection with that as Joel and John
[26:11] plainly declare the coming of the Lord
[26:12] is to take place end quote
[26:18] here's a timeline comparing brother
[26:20] branham's Revelation on The Sixth Seal
[26:22] and Uriah Smith's teaching on The Sixth
[26:24] Seal
[26:25] again Uriah Smith's teaching is very
[26:27] similar to Charles Taze Russell it seems
[26:29] Russell borrowed a lot of the work from
[26:31] Uriah Smith on The Sixth Seal but
[26:33] anyways Uriah Smith said The Sixth Seal
[26:35] was from 1755 to 1903 right around the
[26:39] time of Rye Smith's death
[26:41] and of course by the brand six seal is
[26:43] during the future The Seven Year Great
[26:45] Tribulation period which hasn't started
[26:47] yet and so the dates are unknown
[26:50] so again we thank the Lord that he
[26:52] revealed the truth of the six seal to
[26:54] his genuine Prophet brother William
[26:55] Branham
[26:58] in closing
[27:01] friends I hope this video was a blessing
[27:03] we're almost done with these Seven Seals
[27:06] showing how brother Ram did not
[27:07] plagiarize Charles Taze Russell Clarence
[27:09] Larkin nor Uriah Smith
[27:11] friends we've got to give brother Brown
[27:12] the benefit of the doubt he lived a holy
[27:14] Godly Christian Life
[27:16] the Lord Jesus Christ used it mightily
[27:18] with his gift of discernment healing
[27:20] prophecy teaching and so many more gifts
[27:23] of the Holy Spirit
[27:25] or the random made references to over 20
[27:27] historians or historical documents
[27:29] during the church ages and reference
[27:31] Samuel Schmucker Uriah Smith during the
[27:33] Seven Seals so CNG just forgot to
[27:36] mention Larkin during The Sixth Seal so
[27:38] we're thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ
[27:40] revealing the revelation of the Seven
[27:42] Seals to his Prophet brother Branham and
[27:44] we look forward to the final video of
[27:46] the seventh seal Lord willing I'll try
[27:47] to get to that here in the next few
[27:49] weeks by God's grace
[27:51] if you have any questions concerns or
[27:54] testimonies about this video please
[27:55] contact me
[27:58] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[28:01] the desire of your heart
