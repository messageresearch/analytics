[0:02] and still he won't move. Seems to set
[0:07] silent. That's when you've got to be
[0:10] sure that he is God. Don't be
[0:14] discouraged.
[0:16] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:18] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:20] this video is to look at three times
[0:23] when God's prophet, brother William
[0:24] Brham, felt God was setting silent or
[0:28] laying silent as he says it in the
[0:31] sermon, Be certain of God from January
[0:34] 1959.
[0:35] Every requirement that God has made or
[0:39] asked, we have met that
[0:41] requirement. And yet he lays
[0:46] silent. He just won't answer us.
[0:50] I'm sure that I'm speaking to people
[0:54] this morning who's come to that
[0:58] place. I've been there many times
[1:02] myself. When I went back and traced my
[1:05] life and turned over every
[1:09] stone and I'd find that I did something
[1:12] wrong, I'd go confess it and say, "Lord
[1:14] God, I'll make it right and go do so.
[1:19] Then come back again and say now Lord
[1:21] thy God you'll answer me surely I met
[1:25] every request that you required me to do
[1:28] and every requirement I have met it and
[1:32] still he won't
[1:35] move seems to set
[1:39] silent that's when you've got to be sure
[1:42] that he is
[1:46] God don't be discourageed
[1:49] encouraged. The only thing is it in your
[1:52] heart to be certain of
[1:57] God. Of course, this has a Bible
[1:59] foundation. So, we'll start with the
[2:00] Bible foundation of how sometimes God
[2:03] doesn't answer our prayers right away.
[2:06] It seems like God is being silent, but
[2:08] of course, God promised he would never
[2:09] leave us nor forsake us. according to
[2:12] Hebrews 13:5 and 6. For he hath said, I
[2:16] will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,
[2:19] so that we may boldly say, the Lord is
[2:21] my helper, and I will not fear what man
[2:23] shall do unto
[2:24] me. So, the Bible foundation of the
[2:28] truth that sometimes God is silent in
[2:30] order to test us or to try us. There's
[2:33] at least four examples. I'm sure there's
[2:35] many more in the scripture, but the one
[2:36] brother Brandham uses is the widow at
[2:38] Zarapath from First Kings 17. She likely
[2:42] waited two or two and 1/2 years until
[2:45] God sent her
[2:46] Elijah. She thought she and her son
[2:48] would die according to First Kings
[2:51] 17:12. And I'm just paraphrasing, but
[2:53] she told Elijah she was going to gather
[2:55] the sticks, use the remaining oil and
[2:58] flour that she had, bake and eat the
[3:01] final cake, and then she and her son
[3:02] would die. So, it seems like God was
[3:04] silent to this widow for about 2 or 2
[3:07] and 1/2 years. But then God answered her
[3:10] through the prophet of God. Second, the
[3:12] three Hebrew children, we'd say,
[3:14] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, God was
[3:17] silent in the sense that God didn't tell
[3:18] them that he was going to save them from
[3:20] the fiery furnace. In Daniel 3:17, they
[3:24] said, "Our God is able to deliver us.
[3:26] But in verse 18, but if not, be it known
[3:28] unto thee, oh king, we will not serve
[3:30] thy gods, nor worship the golden
[3:33] image. So apparently for a short amount
[3:36] of time, God was silent, but then God
[3:38] showed up. He didn't send another angel,
[3:39] as brother Ram dramatizes, God showed up
[3:42] in the midst of the fire, the fourth man
[3:44] in the fire, one likened to the son of
[3:46] man, the Lord Jesus Christ, in his
[3:48] theophony form. Third, uh the prophet
[3:51] Jacob in the book of Genesis, he didn't
[3:53] know Joseph was alive for many years.
[3:55] One estimate is about 22 years. It
[3:58] seemed like God was silent and God did
[4:00] not tell him that his son Joseph was
[4:02] alive in Egypt. And brother Ram said God
[4:06] only tells his prophets what he wants
[4:08] them to know. God doesn't tell them
[4:10] everything. See, God don't tell his
[4:12] prophets everything. He just tells them
[4:14] what he wants them to know. See, God was
[4:17] working out a plan then and he had to
[4:18] work in it. God will, if you'll submit
[4:21] yourself to God, God will make you work
[4:23] right into his plan.
[4:25] And then the fourth example is Job. Of
[4:28] course, Job waited months, the Bible
[4:29] says, to test him in order to prove to
[4:32] the devil that Job loved God, not just
[4:35] for the hedge of protection and the
[4:38] blessings. So, I guess I could add a
[4:40] fifth example here in 2 Chronicles
[4:43] 32:31 regarding King Hezekiah. The Bible
[4:46] said God left him or God took his strong
[4:50] anointing off of Hezekiah. So remember
[4:52] Hezekiah had served God with integrity
[4:53] his entire life and that was based on
[4:56] the anointing and the blessing of God.
[4:58] But God pulled back his anointing and
[5:00] blessing off of Hezekiah in order to try
[5:04] him. Again 2 Chronicles 32:31 that he
[5:07] might know all that was in his heart. So
[5:08] there was still some remaining perhaps
[5:10] selfishness or pride in Hezekiah's
[5:13] heart. So God pulled off his strong
[5:15] anointing and allowed Hezekiah to see
[5:17] the sin that was still in his heart. And
[5:19] of course, all of us have some type of
[5:21] sin in our lives. Brother Ram said, "We
[5:23] sin every day." Paul had to die daily
[5:25] from his sinful nature. So there's five
[5:28] Bible examples of when it seems like God
[5:30] is silent in our lives, but we should
[5:33] not be discouraged. Again, he'll never
[5:34] forsake us. That's what the promise of
[5:36] God is. But he has to test us and try
[5:38] us. So let's look at these three times
[5:40] that Brother Ram talks about God being
[5:42] silent. The first he talked about an
[5:44] Israel life worthy of the gospel, June
[5:46] 30th, 1963. It's a story from 1936 or 37
[5:51] during the time of the Ohio River flood.
[5:54] And it was about the death of Hope and
[5:56] Sharon Rose. I have a video on my
[5:58] channel that just has this full quote.
[5:59] I'm not going to play the full quote
[6:01] here, but Brother Ram was praying for
[6:04] God to heal his wife and daughter. And
[6:06] Brother Random said it was if God said,
[6:08] quote, "Shut up. I don't want to hear
[6:10] you at all." End quote. And so this is a
[6:13] time God was silent to brother Brandham.
[6:15] And of course this was because of
[6:16] brother Ram's disobedience. Brother Ram
[6:19] was invited to preach to the
[6:20] Pentecostals. He tells about that story
[6:22] of going up to Mishawaka and getting
[6:24] many invitations. But he turned down the
[6:26] invitations to cater to his
[6:28] mother-in-law. And brother Ram said that
[6:29] was a great mistake of his life. But I
[6:32] love it. In the midst of being tempted
[6:34] to almost quit the ministry and quit
[6:36] preaching, brother Ram said everything
[6:38] broke up in his spirit realm, his mind
[6:40] realm and the anchor the Holy Ghost held
[6:43] and he was able to keep pressing on.
[6:45] Now, no doubt he was going to go through
[6:46] many more difficult times. He even
[6:48] talked about battling suicidal thoughts
[6:51] and so forth, but God was faithful. The
[6:53] anchor held in the soul. This is why
[6:55] it's so important to be baptized with
[6:56] the Holy Ghost. So, let's listen to a
[6:58] portion of that quote. And here's where
[7:00] I made my mistake, friends. I'll listen
[7:02] to my mother-in-law instead of listening
[7:04] to God. And if I would have went ahead
[7:07] then, this great thing would have been
[7:09] manifested before this and the church
[7:11] had been farther along. But listen to my
[7:14] mistakes. Here's where sorrow
[7:17] started. He just pulled down the curtain
[7:19] as if say, "Shut up. I don't want to
[7:21] hear you at all. You wouldn't even talk
[7:24] to
[7:24] me." Then if he wouldn't talk to me, it
[7:27] was Satan's time. He said, 'I thought
[7:30] you said he was a good
[7:31] God. What's all this you're hollering
[7:34] about? You're just a boy. Look around
[7:36] over the city. Every girl, every boy you
[7:38] ever social, we think you've lost your
[7:40] mind. You have. Now, he couldn't tell me
[7:42] there was no God because I'd already
[7:44] seen it. But he told me he didn't care
[7:46] for me. I said, "That's right." I began
[7:49] to think, well, what? See, everything be
[7:52] to break away when it come to
[7:54] reasonings. But when it come to that
[7:57] that hung, it stayed there. I was just
[8:00] about ready to say then I'll quit. But
[8:03] when it got down to all the reasoning
[8:05] powers that broke away, then it come to
[8:07] that eternal life, that new birth. What
[8:09] if it hadn't have been there?
[8:12] What if it
[8:13] hadn't? We wouldn't have known one
[8:15] another the way we do now. This church
[8:18] would have not been here like this. The
[8:21] thousands and millions around the world
[8:25] But thank God it was there. Then when I
[8:28] thought, what who am I anyhow? Who am I
[8:32] to question his majesty?
[8:35] Who am I to question the creator to give
[8:37] me my very life here on earth? Where did
[8:40] I get that baby? Who give it to
[8:42] me? Not mine anyhow. Just loan her to me
[8:45] for a while. I said, "Satan, get away
[8:48] from me." I went over, lay my hand on
[8:50] the baby. I said, "God bless you,
[8:52] sweetheart. In a minute, daddy will take
[8:54] you down. Put your own mommy's arms. The
[8:56] angels will pack your little soul away
[8:57] and I'll meet you in that morning. I
[8:59] said, Lord, you give her to me. You're
[9:01] taking her away and throw you slainy
[9:03] like Job said, "Yet I love you and I
[9:05] believe you. If you send me to hell, I
[9:07] love you anyhow. I can't get away from
[9:09] that." The second example is from 1960.
[9:12] Brother Ram tells this story in the
[9:14] sermon, "Go tell April 17th, 1960." And
[9:17] it seems Brother Random had a awful
[9:19] sinus infection for about 9 days.
[9:22] Brother Ram had these meetings set up.
[9:24] He was to go there and preach, but he
[9:25] had this high fever in the hundreds for
[9:28] nine days straight. He said he had many
[9:30] anointed preachers come pray for him to
[9:31] get well, but it seemed like the prayers
[9:34] were not being answered. And then
[9:36] towards the end of this nine days,
[9:37] Brother Ram told his wife perhaps God
[9:39] never called him to preach. And brother
[9:40] Rams said his wife kind of rebuked him a
[9:43] little bit and just said to keep silent.
[9:46] Then after that, Brother Brandham just
[9:47] waited on the Lord. And then the Lord
[9:49] Jesus finally ended the silence and came
[9:51] to him. had a vision. Brother Ram had a
[9:53] vision of the Lord Jesus and the Lord
[9:54] Jesus said, "You're catering too much to
[9:56] denominations." So, we can see these two
[9:58] examples, these first two examples, God
[10:00] is silent because brother Random was
[10:02] catering to his mother-in-law and
[10:04] denominations. And the Lord Jesus also
[10:07] said, Brother Ram was failing to
[10:08] recognize his new ministry, the third
[10:11] pole. So, a beautiful story here of
[10:13] being tested here even with some
[10:15] sickness. But again, God graciously
[10:18] comes to brother Brandham at the end of
[10:19] this test just as he returned to brother
[10:22] Brandham after the death of his first
[10:24] wife and daughter Sharon Rose. Let's
[10:26] listen to a portion of this quote from
[10:27] Gotel 1960. I talked something other
[10:30] give me and what it was. It pulled that
[10:32] sinus down and blocked it. Then I laid
[10:34] in the bed for nine days with this a
[10:36] high burning fever. Many my brother and
[10:38] here come to me many famous brothers
[10:40] come prayed for me. Here come brother
[10:42] Grim Snelling. Here come brother Rattle.
[10:44] All these brothers sure all gathered in
[10:46] praying and everything else. Me praying,
[10:48] trying my best, couldn't even whisper. I
[10:50] wonder what's it all about. You know,
[10:53] I'm so thankful for a god-given wife.
[10:55] Aren't you, brethren, a real wife? Real
[10:57] companion. I sit down. I motion to her
[10:59] and got her over close to me. I said,
[11:02] "Meie, sometimes I wonder." I said, "I
[11:05] wonder what's the matter." I said, "Why
[11:08] would them meetings be there and God let
[11:10] me lay like this?" I said, 'Wh was it?'
[11:14] And I said, "Sometimes I wonder if he
[11:16] even called me." She said, "Ain't you
[11:17] ashamed of yourself?" And she told me,
[11:19] said, "Bill, don't you know that God
[11:21] knows what he's doing with you? Just
[11:22] just be quiet." And so I went in that
[11:26] kind of rebuked me a little, you know.
[11:27] So I went in, laid down on the bed. She
[11:29] come in to change the sheets and she had
[11:31] got the the things on her arm and I
[11:34] looked and I seen something make a
[11:36] flicker over to one side and I looked
[11:40] and there was my wall opened up and I
[11:43] seen Jesus. How many have ever heard me
[11:45] say it? I've seen Jesus twice in my life
[11:47] in a vision. He looked down at me like
[11:50] that and he said to me, "You are waiting
[11:54] for your new ministry to be confirmed to
[11:57] you." He said, "I've already confirmed
[12:00] it to you. It's already confirmed.
[12:02] You've got to accept it." And I didn't
[12:05] listen to him just a minute. It come
[12:07] into my mind. I didn't hear that. It
[12:09] just come in my mind like a man that
[12:11] he's been a sinner all his life and he
[12:13] knows there's a Bible, knows there's a
[12:14] God, but all it wants to hear is a
[12:16] sermon. Then something tells him it's
[12:19] you. And the he said to me then, "You've
[12:22] got to accept it the same way. You've
[12:24] got to believe it. I'm afraid of defeat.
[12:27] Anything I'm afraid I'll bring a
[12:28] reproach. I'm always afraid of watching
[12:30] think I'll call the wrong thing because
[12:32] I've talked warning of the Bible how
[12:35] that Moses is giving great power and he
[12:37] smoke the rock instead of speaking to
[12:39] it. And there he stood talking to me and
[12:41] he said but you walk with too many. He
[12:45] said to walk with me you walk alone.
[12:51] I'd seen that. I've been catering too
[12:54] much to denominations and everything.
[12:55] You see somebody trying to tell you what
[12:57] to do and what not to do. You got to
[13:00] follow him. Amen.
[13:02] The third and final example is from the
[13:04] sermon God doesn't call man to judgment
[13:07] without first warning him July 24th,
[13:10] 1963. In this story, brother Brandham
[13:12] prayed for a young mother and she got
[13:14] well, but then she got sick and died in
[13:17] the hospital. And brother Brandham
[13:18] thought because God had healed her at
[13:20] first that she was going to live the
[13:21] rest of her life for the glory of God.
[13:23] and she and her husband and then her
[13:25] mother were going to serve God
[13:26] faithfully. That this family was all
[13:28] going to unite in the Christian faith
[13:30] and serve God. But then the Lord took
[13:32] the young mother home. She passed away
[13:35] and brother Ram said these words. He
[13:37] said he didn't know why he said it, but
[13:38] he said, "God, you owe me an
[13:40] understanding." And brother Ram said,
[13:42] "God did not like that." And God was
[13:44] silent to Brother Ram for about three or
[13:46] four months. Brother Ram said, "God,
[13:48] just let him pout it out." And then
[13:51] after brother Ram repents, Brother Ram
[13:52] finds out that this young mother that
[13:55] passed away should have died a couple
[13:56] years earlier. She should have drowned
[13:58] in a lake at some type of gathering,
[14:00] some family gathering, but God spared
[14:02] her. God had her life saved because she
[14:04] wasn't ready to go to heaven. She would
[14:06] have been lost. So this is an example
[14:08] where God spares someone's life in order
[14:12] to grant them salvation. So this is the
[14:15] mercy of God. God is rich in mercy. So
[14:18] beautiful story here of brother Ram
[14:20] growing in grace and knowledge of the
[14:22] Lord. Brother Ram being very transparent
[14:24] about his mistakes. That's what we all
[14:26] need to be more transparent, more humble
[14:28] about our mistakes. Let's listen to a
[14:30] portion of this quote. And I I I don't
[14:33] know what caused me to do it, but I
[14:34] said, "Lord God, you you owe me an
[14:37] understanding and after me going out
[14:40] there and and telling that husband and
[14:43] him coming to the Lord after you done
[14:45] these things for him and all that and
[14:47] then take that girl's life like that." I
[14:50] said, "You owe me understanding. When
[14:52] you tell God something like that, he'll
[14:53] leave you sitting alone. I don't He
[14:55] don't owe me nothing. I'm in debt to
[14:57] him." Well, he just let me pound it out
[14:59] for a few days, you know. And after
[15:01] about 3 or 4 months, one day I was out
[15:04] on the creek bank and the Lord spoke to
[15:07] me in a vision and said, "Now go to her
[15:12] mother and say this to her mother." Did
[15:16] not her time come the year before that
[15:20] when she was drowning in a creek on a
[15:23] picnic. She should have went at that
[15:26] time, but I had to take her when she was
[15:28] ready to go.
[15:32] That's why all this happened, why you
[15:35] went out there. Then I got down and
[15:38] cried. I said, "Lord Jesus, forgive me.
[15:42] Your poor stupid servant. I should have
[15:45] never said that, Lord." And I went back
[15:47] down to the lady. She lived on Marcus
[15:50] Street. And I went over to her and I
[15:51] said, "I want to ask you a question."
[15:54] She said, "Sure, Brother Bill." And I
[15:57] said, "Is it true that this girl uh uh
[16:02] uh almost said that's right, Brother
[16:04] Brandham?" Said her husband and they
[16:05] they had to get her out of the creek and
[16:07] said they had to use artificial
[16:08] respiration a prone pressure and they
[16:10] had to get a machine and pump the water
[16:12] out of her. Said she had her skirt on
[16:14] this having a picnic. She was out there
[16:16] and stepped in some sand slipped off
[16:17] overhead and strangled in the water.
[16:19] They didn't notice her and directly seen
[16:21] her coming up and going down and they
[16:22] run in and got her and brought her out
[16:24] and said she almost died. Said she I
[16:26] said that was her time to go. See, God
[16:30] knows what he's doing. Now, the Lord
[16:33] probably would have told me that if I
[16:34] hadn't taken the attitude that I did.
[16:37] Lord, you owe me to tell me about that.
[16:39] He don't owe you nothing. In closing,
[16:42] friends, I hope this video was a
[16:43] blessing by the grace of God. It's an
[16:44] encouragement for us to know that God's
[16:47] going to test us. God's going to try us
[16:48] at times. And brother Ram said he loves
[16:51] to see how we're going to react. That's
[16:52] again from that sermon, Be Certain of
[16:53] God, 1959.
[16:55] You know, he loves to test
[16:57] us. He loves to see the reaction of your
[17:02] faith. Did you know that God likes to
[17:06] see how you react?
[17:08] He loves to test us because the Bible
[17:10] says, "As many as I love, I rebuke and
[17:12] chasen." in Revelation chapter 3 and
[17:15] Hebrews 12 said God has to chasen or
[17:17] test or discipline or train every son or
[17:20] daughter that comes to him. So, we're
[17:22] all going to go through this. We
[17:24] probably already gone through it
[17:25] sometimes at some point in our life
[17:27] already, but we're going to go through
[17:28] it again by the grace of God in order to
[17:30] test us, to try us, that our faith might
[17:32] come forth as gold as Job said. Job knew
[17:35] he was being tested and he knew at the
[17:37] end of it he'd come forth as gold. So, a
[17:40] few reminders. Let's remember to put God
[17:42] first just like the widow at Zerapath.
[17:44] Elijah had instructed her, "Bring me a
[17:47] cake first and then the miracle will
[17:49] happen." Of course, brother Ram quotes
[17:51] this and then he quotes Matthew chapter
[17:52] 6 about seek ye first the kingdom of God
[17:55] in his righteousness and then everything
[17:57] else will be added unto us. So, we get
[17:59] the lesson to seek God first in the
[18:00] morning. Put God first in our finances.
[18:03] Make sure the Lord Jesus Christ is
[18:05] number one in our lives. We also
[18:07] remember Isaiah where it says, "They
[18:08] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[18:10] their strength." In every case here in
[18:12] the Bible, the the saints that were
[18:14] tested were eventually visited by God
[18:16] and they renewed their strength by the
[18:18] grace of God. And friends, we want to
[18:20] pass the test. God loves to test us and
[18:22] we want to pass it by being faithful to
[18:24] the Lord. And the story of Job tells us
[18:26] that we can even make awful mistakes in
[18:28] the midst of the test and God will still
[18:30] forgive us and love us. Remember the
[18:32] Bible says that Job actually justified
[18:34] himself more than God. Job said he was
[18:37] more righteous than God. Elahu rebuked
[18:39] him for that. But it was the truth. In
[18:41] the midst of the pain and suffering,
[18:43] even in the midst of prophesying, Job
[18:45] prophesied that I'll stand with the Lord
[18:47] on the earth in my flesh, I shall see
[18:49] God. But he was going back and forth
[18:51] from being in the spirit and being in
[18:53] the flesh. And Job said, I repent in
[18:55] dust and ashes. I abhore myself for the
[18:58] mistakes I made going through the test.
[19:00] in Job 42. So friends, we're going to
[19:02] make mistakes, little mistakes at times
[19:04] when we're tested by the Lord. But
[19:06] remember, just keep waiting on the Lord.
[19:07] Just keep confessing your sin. God will
[19:10] strengthen us. He'll forgive us. He'll
[19:12] renew our strength like the eagle. And
[19:14] lastly, remember that quote from the
[19:16] church age book. It's a beautiful
[19:17] section, pages 116 through 118, at least
[19:20] in the old copy of the church age book.
[19:22] Brother Ram's talking about the love of
[19:24] God and how the proof of God's love is
[19:26] an election or your choosing or your
[19:28] calling. Brother Ram said, "God may
[19:31] commit you to death as he did Paul. He
[19:33] may commit you to suffering as he did
[19:35] Job. That is his prerogative. He is
[19:38] sovereign, but it is all with a purpose
[19:40] because God is not the author of
[19:42] confusion. God is the author of peace."
[19:45] So God wants us to learn peace in the
[19:46] midst of our tests and trials of life.
[19:49] Whatever he commits our lives to, God is
[19:51] trustworthy. We can trust him with our
[19:54] lives and our souls and our eternity.
[19:57] Then on page 117, we get that great
[20:00] quote that character is a victory, not a
[20:02] gift. Power apart from character is
[20:05] satanic, but power with character is fit
[20:07] to rule. What a memorable, powerful
[20:09] quote. And then a little later, Brother
[20:12] Ram says, "The cloudy skies and storms
[20:14] of life are no signs of God's
[20:16] disapproval. Neither are the bright
[20:17] skies and still waters signs of his love
[20:20] and approval. His approval of any of us
[20:23] is only in the beloved. His love is
[20:26] elective love. Does he love us? Ah, yes.
[20:29] But how shall we know? We shall know
[20:30] because he said so. And brother Ram
[20:33] said, "How shall I prove my love to him?
[20:34] By believing what he said and by
[20:36] conducting himself with joy amidst the
[20:38] trials that he in his wisdom allows to
[20:41] come to pass." So friends, let's
[20:43] continue to trust God. As Proverbs 3
[20:45] says, "Trust in the Lord with all your
[20:47] heart. Lean not to your own
[20:48] understanding. In all your ways
[20:50] acknowledge him and he will direct your
[20:52] paths." So when God sets silent or lays
[20:56] silent as brother Ram says, keep
[20:57] trusting in him. He will come and save
[21:00] you. He will renew your strength like
[21:02] the eagle. If you have any questions,
[21:04] concerns or testimonies about this

[21:10] be the desire of your heart.
