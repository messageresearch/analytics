TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 8 the perfect will of god includes footnotes numbers 416-476 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god romans 12 verses 1 and 2. at paul's conversion his trembling astonished being asked the lord jesus christ this humble question lord what will thou have me to do the gracious god answered him and told him to go into the city of damascus and he would be told more about what he must do every true sincere-hearted christian will ask the lord the same thing today what must i do in other words what is your will for my life lord what do you want me to do in the case of this book i hope you've asked yourself this question lord what is your will for my outward appearance hopefully you have been asking this question for years if you sincerely ask this question as a prayer god will give you his perfect will according to his holy bible proving the perfect will of god romans 12 verse 2 teaches that christians can not only know the will of god but prove what is the perfect will of god for their lives this is what children of the light do we walk in the light or will of god and prove what is acceptable unto the lord in fact every part of our lives should be proven to be pleasing to god paul taught once we know god's perfect will we must abide in it what will be your evidence or proof of the will of god it will be the actions that are acceptable to god based upon the scriptures the holy spirit anointed godly men to write for our admonition there is no other proof or evidence we need than the word of god for jesus christ said the word of god is truth in order to prove the perfect will of god paul wrote that we needed a transformed mind the greek word for transformed in romans 12 verse 2 is the same word used to describe the transfigured presence of jesus christ on the mountain in matthew 17 verses 1 through 8. jesus's transfiguration included a face that shined like the sun and rayment bright as light paul said this is what should happen to our minds when we know the perfect will of god our minds are illuminated as the sun the day star has risen in our thoughts and mind darkness confusion and fear have all vanished the truth of god is present in our thoughts and shining in all its glory there is no confusion about what god once done in our lives when we know the perfect will of god through a transformed mind to the believer the truth of the word of god becomes a thus saith the lord an unquestioned authoritative love request from his savior the lord jesus christ today as in every generation satan will battle christians and try to move them out of walking in the perfect will of god those who reject the will of god and accept a sin-loving lifestyle are called workers of iniquity proving that there is no sin or disobedience in the perfect will of god two paths perfect versus permissive there are two paths we can walk either the perfect will of god or the permissive will of god the perfect will of god is the way of full obedience to the word of god while the permissive will of god is the path or way of disobedience and compromise the word of god is the light unto our path as david wrote if we lose our light or scriptural guidance we will walk in a permissive path rather than the perfect path and reap the consequences of disobeying the lord scripture gives us numerous examples of individuals who chose to walk in the permissive will of god rather than the perfect will of god the following four examples cain balaam saul and hezekiah prove there is great danger in choosing the permissive will of god but a person can still be saved despite walking away from the perfect will of god ultimately god is the righteous judge and will grant eternal life to all those he has foreknown cain was given the perfect will of god animal sacrifice by god himself this took place after cain witnessed his brother abel offer an animal sacrifice which please god the animal sacrifice was received by god as the perfect will of god instead of humbling himself and obeying the perfect will of god cain spurned the mercy of god changed his countenance murdered his brother and left the presence of god this proves god will accept nothing but true worship the perfect will of god according to his revealed will which is what jesus christ taught as well it seems likely that cain was lost balaam was a genuine prophet for telling the star of jacob that would lead the wise men to christ but balaam rejected god's perfect will which was against his joining forces with king balak after balaam heard god's perfect will telling him not to go see balak he prayed again to see if god would tell him different balaam did not need a second word from god because he was already given the perfect will of god because balaam's soul loved money more than god's perfect will he chose the wages of unrighteousness and prayed to see if god would let him go with the men god saw balaam's wickedness and let balaam have his permissive will once teamed up with balak balaam preached false doctrine and caused israel to commit acts of fornication that led to the death of thousands of people peter taught that balaam's destiny was hell the mist of darkness forever balaam stands as an example of a gifted individual who could hear from god but love money more than righteousness he ultimately rejected salvation israel's first king saul is an example of someone being saved despite choosing the permissive will of god for the majority of his adult life we know saul was saved because the spirit of samuel called up out of paradise by the witch of endor told saul that he would be with him in paradise the next day but saul's life will be remembered for walking in the permissive will of god as saul's pride and hatred caused him to rebel against the perfect will of god his sins caused him to lose out on god's establishing his kingdom forever what tremendous rewards saw lost because he chose the permissive will of god and guess who saw lost his kingdom and reward too david the man who is after the heart of god or the perfect will of god saul had a premature death as god himself took his life because of his awful transgressions of god's word king hezekiah's life was one of honor and obedience to the god of israel for the majority of his life at the end of his life though hezekiah chose to walk in the permissive will of god his first mistake was to ask god for more years to his life after the prophet isaiah had told him to set his house in order in preparation for his death scripture says it would have been better for hezekiah to die rather than live the extra 15 years because after his healing he catered to the babylonian ambassadors and showed them all the treasures in the lord's house hezekiah remains a striking example of a post-mature death as he died at a later time than god had desired because he chose the permissive will of god now i will return to today a holy ghost-filled christian will have the same desire as christ to walk in the perfect will of god did you know that it was jesus's delight to obey the word of god we must have this same mindset as christ that it is a joy to do the will of god as revealed in the bible david wrote the following of christ then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me i delight to do thy will o my god yea thy law is within my heart when you are born again the commandments of god are not grievous obeying the word is not difficult when you are sealed with the baptism of the holy ghost in your being for you contain the quickening power of the risen christ in your soul by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith paul says but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you if you want to do the perfect will of god you must have a teachable heart as david wrote teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness jesus then explained how humble and sincere you must be if you want to learn from him saying come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light you must come with a humble heart to learn from jesus christ you cannot come to christ and his bible with a prideful heart saying i can dress however i want and still go to heaven i don't have to submit to what the bible teaches about makeup my hair length or modest clothing if you want to learn from the meek one himself the lord jesus christ you must become meek like him meekly prayerfully pick up your bible and let god's word prove the perfect will of god for your outward appearance proving the perfect will of god for your outward appearance through the previous chapters you have been reading the perfect will of god for your outward appearance because the teachings were completely bible-based a brief review will help assure you that this is god's proven perfect will beginning with modest clothing recall the scriptures taught in chapter 3. the bible teaches we must cover all areas of nakedness which include the area from our shoulders down to past our knees according to the following scriptures genesis 3 verse 21 isaiah 47 verses 1 through 3 revelation 1 verse 13. first kings 18 verse 46 proverbs 31 verse 17 and matthew 5 verse 40. these scriptures prove that the perfect will of god is to cover our bodies from our shoulders to our shins by god's design not mine if we wear clothes that reveal any body parts within this range we have broken the perfect will of god and are living in the permissive will of god exposing shoulders bearing the navel exposing cleavage and exposing thighs are acts included in the permissive will of god can anyone prove this teaching wrong according to the bible i humbly offer the challenge to be proven wrong by the word of god i can find no scriptural witnesses of god being pleased when people present their uncovered shoulders cleavage navel and thighs our shoulder exposing tank tops halter or tube tops and spaghetti strap shirts the perfect will of god no those shirts expose the shoulders shoulders are nakedness in the sight of god for they are part of the breast and arms region can anyone prove this wrong by the bible are mini skirts sundresses high slit skirts low-cut dresses short shorts and shorts on men or women the perfect will of god no as all of these garments expose the thigh area which god considers nakedness according to isaiah 47 verses 1-3 can anyone prove this wrong by the bible modest clothing must also include multiple layers or be thick and opaque according to genesis 3 21 matthew 5 verse 40 judges 3 verse 16 and john 21 verse 7. peter in john 21 verse 7 was wearing only his undergarment tunic and was considered naked in the sight of god like peter anyone who wears their undergarments on the outside such as underwear or bathing suits is guilty of walking in the permissive will of god can anyone prove this wrong by the bible are bikinis and skin tight one piece bathing suits the perfect will of god no these suits are one thin layer of clothing and are equal to the amount of fabric used for undergarments they also reveal breasts the navel thighs and all the leg bathing suits reveal nearly every area of nakedness can anyone prove this wrong by the bible are sheer blouses the perfect will of god no for these shirts allow men to see through the outer garments and perceive undergarments god calls the exposing of undergarments nakedness can anyone prove this wrong by the bible modest clothing must be gender specific according to deuteronomy 22 5 even as the lord jesus obeyed this command of separate garments for men and women in our american culture any man who wears woman's clothing dresses bras etc is committing an abomination likewise any woman who wears pants is cross-dressing and walking in the permissive will of god can anyone prove this wrong by the bible modest clothing must also be loose according to first kings 19 13 mark 16 verse 5 revelation 6 verse 11 revelation 7 verse 14 and proverbs 7 verse 10. anyone who wears skin tight clothing thus revealing the form of their bodies is walking in the permissive will of god can anyone prove this wrong by the bible are skinny jeans yoga pants and women's leggings the perfect will of god no for they reveal the literal shape of the human body which is a form of nakedness that can cause others to lust after their bodies and commit spiritual fornications and adulteries can anyone prove this wrong by the bible concerning our outward appearance recall the scriptures taught in chapters 4 5 and 6. we can prove the perfect will of god for our hair length jewelry and skin men's hair length must be short and women's must be as long as possible as women must never cut their hair any man who lets his hair grow uncut is bringing shame upon himself likewise a woman who cuts or trims her hair in any way is bringing herself shame along with her head her husband can anyone prove this wrong by the bible are uncut dreadlocks on a man the perfect will of god no for men are commanded to have short hair could anyone prove this wrong by the bible are bobbed haircuts or the trimming of split ends the perfect will of god for women no for godly women are never commanded to cut their hair in any way can anyone prove this wrong by the bible jewelry can be worn in moderation with a meek and quiet attitude as long as the jewelry is not extremely costly wearing jewelry such as rings bracelets and necklaces in this manner can be the perfect will of god can anyone prove this wrong by the bible jewelry that is extremely expensive is in the permissive will of god so is wearing any jewelry whether inexpensive or expensive with a prideful heart wearing large amounts of jewelry is also the permissive will of god can anyone prove this wrong by the bible makeup tattoos and high heels are not part of the perfect will of god according to the following scriptures 2 kings 9 30 jeremiah 4 verse 30 ezekiel 23 verse 40 leviticus 19 verse 28 and isaiah 3 verse 16. can anyone prove this wrong by the bible if all these statements cannot be proved wrong by the bible then these statements must be the perfect will of god for our outward appearance i am not guessing what is the perfect will of god concerning our outward appearances by the grace of god i have shown you much more than two or three witnesses as jesus and paul required to prove that these teachings are correct as jesus said i say humbly concerning these guidelines for a modest outward appearance which of you convinceth me of sin which scripture have i failed to teach properly who am i causing to stumble with these bible guidelines on modest clothing and outward appearance i am pointing you to present your body to god as a living sacrifice ask for and seek revelation perhaps you want a transformed mind in order to do the perfect will of god but you still may feel like you do not understand all the scripture i have presented thus far if the bible feels like a newspaper like a dead letter then it is time you ask and seek god for revelation revelation is an unveiling of god and his will revelation is more important to you than you know for the lord jesus christ said that the gates of hell cannot prevail against revelation and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it in context jesus was declaring to peter how blessed he was that god not man had revealed to him that jesus was the messiah or christ the revelation or unveiling of who jesus was would be the anchor that would keep peter grounded in god's love satan would try to overthrow peter's faith but the revelation peter received from father god would prevail over all of satan's counsel to destroy him the same is true about revelation for all of god's teachings you need revelation about a modest outward appearance forgiveness gifts and love you name the topic and you need revelation about it all revelation from god will empower his children to serve him and overcome the devil revelation was so crucial that paul prayed for believers to receive it wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power the power and importance of revelation was so great that even our lord jesus rejoiced over his disciples receiving his revelations in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him if you are struggling to understand the scriptures i have pointed out then i encourage you to continue seeking god's will for your outward appearance with all your heart ask seek and knock for revelation as jesus promised everyone that did this would receive of him ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened there is one very important passage about seeking god's will that has been pivotal in many of my times of seeking the will of god for my own life after you read proverbs 2 verses 3 through 9 below i hope you will be unashamed and confident when crying out to god for the revelation of his word yea if thou criest after knowledge and lift us up thy voice for understanding if thou seekest her as silver and searches for her as for hid treasures then shalt thou understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly he keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his saints then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity yea every good path the source of my teachings after reading these nearly forty thousand words contained in eight chapters you may be wondering who is the source of my teachings to begin with i humbly state that i have no teachings of my own with the help of god i teach only the doctrine of our lord and savior jesus christ he is the ultimate divine source of my teachings for it is his bible that i have used to rightly divide these truths about a modest outward appearance but you are probably still wondering which human source meaning which man or ministry did i follow in order to gain these doctrines i am happy to share that i receive these bible doctrines from the ministry of the late reverend william branham 1909 to 1965. william branham's ministry is the human source of my teachings yet god was the divine source god revealed his bible truths to branham as the word of the lord always comes to the prophet the prophetic spirit of elijah anointed william branham fulfilling jesus's promise in matthew 17 verse 11 to restore all things including christian modesty in november of 2001 i was introduced to the ministry of brother branham as we lovingly call him and have followed his bible-based teachings ever since the simplest way to describe the ministry of brother branham is by calling him a prophet of god a new testament prophet is an official preaching office of god according to ephesians 4 verse 11. the qualifications of a prophet include hearing from god foretelling the future in the name of the lord without fail and revealing secrets that were previously hidden by the leading of the holy spirit brother branham met these three qualifications brother branham heard from god throughout his entire life meeting the requirement of numbers 12 6. he shared many of his supernatural encounters with both the lord jesus and the angel of the lord during his entire ministry the angel lord followed him just as moses and paul had an angel with them during their lives in 1946 the angel of the lord visited brother branham and commissioned him to pray for the sick with a gift of divine healing after hearing from and obeying the angel of the lord the healing campaigns of brother branham were miraculous to say the least and led to a spiritual explosion in the pentecostal movement of the 1940s 1950s and 1960s brother branham's ministry spearheaded this worldwide movement a true prophet foretells future events without fail as moses taught in deuteronomy 18 verses 20 through 22 brother branham met this prophetic requirement my youtube video titled three prophecies of william branham details three prophecies that have either come to pass already or are in the process of coming to pass which include the immoral condition of the churches in the united states no greater ministry rising to the gentile people than what god gave to brother branham and no return of christian denominations to an apostolic ministry along with these three prophecies there are many other future prophecies that i believe will come to pass as detailed in my youtube video titled thus saith the lord future prophecies of william branham because god is so gracious he has always sent a prophet to warn his people before times of judgment as seen in four clear examples first in the years before the flood of judgment in noah's day the merciful god sent at least two prophets to warn the people enoch and noah second before israel's babylonian and assyrian captivity god sent multiple prophets to warn the people such as jeremiah isaiah micah and habakkuk third god sent the prophet jonah to warn the ninevites before judgment and thankfully they repented and were spared from the wrath of god fourth god sent the prophet john the baptist and his son jesus to warn israel before the destruction of jerusalem at the coming of titus in 70 a.d finally at the end of the world the unchanging god was obligated to send a prophetic ministry to warn the people before the next judgment which will be the great tribulation period of the wrath of god spoken of in daniel 12 1 revelation 6 verses 12 through 17 revelation 11 verse 18 revelation 15 verse 1 and revelation 16 verse 1 to name a few the ministry of brother branham was god's prophetic voice of warning but also of deliverance one of the most exciting elements of a prophetic ministry is that prophets revealed god's secrets that were previously hidden according to amos 3 verse 7 surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets god revealed many secrets to brother branham which he in turn revealed to us including but not limited to the human identities of the seven stars or angel messengers to the seven churches in revelation 1 verse 20 and chapters 2 and 3. the revelation of the seven seals of revelation chapters 6 and 8. the 12 new testament mysteries the restoration of the one faith of the apostolic fathers the visitation of the son of man jesus christ to the gentiles before worldwide judgment the last sign to the gentiles before worldwide judgment the identity of the final two gentile kingdoms greek and roman that followed the first two kingdoms babylon and the medes and persians described in nebuchadnezzar's dream in daniel chapter 2. the united states identity and position in revelation 13 the mark of the beast his number and image if you seek to learn more about this amazing prophetic ministry of brother william branham please contact me through our church's website at www.brideofchristohio.org please do not neglect the god-ordained supernatural ministry of brother branham according to the holy spirit speaking prophetically through brother branham in 1961 his supernatural ministry was the last sign to the gentile church before the rapture thus saith the word of god thus saith the holy spirit i am so thankful that i did not neglect this ministry and i will end this section by sharing how this ministry has impacted my life the ministry of brother william branham has established a true relationship between the lord jesus and myself while i am thankful for the charismatic church i was raised in it did not contain the pure unadulterated bible teachings that god gave to his servant brother branham while on my own during my college years i attended many different churches but their preaching could not produce victory in my life as i was still a slave addict to many sins and felt extremely helpless but shortly after i heard the bible-based revelations god gave to brother branham the presence of jesus christ became a reality to me and i was completely delivered of my sinful addictions not long after my deliverance i began to see the power of god move even more in my own life and preaching ministry one highlight was an evangelistic trip to guyana in 2011 where i saw god cast out devils in the exact same manner as the lord jesus modeled in mark 9 verses 25-27 god so anointed and filled my body that i saw myself rebuking foul spirits who would cry out rend the one possessed and then leave the person the person would fall down as dead but then rise later in victory and deliverance from the foul spirit the highest compliment i can give to the ministry of brother branham is that he showed to me and millions more that jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever jesus's counsel to be clothed to conclude this book my final thoughts come from the words of the lord jesus christ from revelation chapters 2 and 3. christ's red letter words in revelation include some of the most inspiring prophetic specific and applicable words for us in the 21st century in these seven addresses to seven gentile cities the lord jesus offers counsel compliments rebukes consequences and even eternal rewards to those in the churches the final letter of these seven letters written to the church at laodicea has the most bitter denunciation recorded in scripture jesus offered no compliment to this blind miserable wretched and naked group due to their pride arrogance and avoidance of recognizing their true spiritual condition the laodiceans felt no need for more of god they had no physical persecution so their age was easier physically as they did not have to be slain for their faith but sadly they were slain by their own lusts as they let riches and worldly goods deceive them into a lukewarm nauseating spiritual condition any spiritually minded person should be able to see that we are living in a modern laodicean condition today most churches are richer than ever with bigger buildings and programs than ever before yet the supernatural power of the holy ghost is at its lowest ebb because they do not want more of the word of god instead they want material possessions for a moment focus on christ's words in revelation 3 verse 18. i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i salve that thou mayest see jesus said that repentant faithful christians need three things gold white raiment and i salve first gold represents time-tested unwavering faith most church members do not live by faith which is assurance in the unseen promises of the invisible god church members often reject the commands of god creating a state of unbelief in their lives unbelief is the opposite of faith when trials come these unbelieving church members choose the path that leads to an easier life for they love money wealth soft living possessions and big church buildings more than the word of god their lives are lacking spiritual gold unwavering faith and trust in the divine promises of god your life can be different as you can obtain this unwavering mature faith in the midst of your hardships by obeying all of god's commands second i salve represents the anointing of the holy spirit to see or discern the absolute truth of god paul wrote that christians have received the i salve or enlightening eyes when they understood god's calling and inheritance for the saints most church members are blind following blind leaders according to jesus christ for he said that few will be saved modern laodiceans follow churches that itch their ears and tell them what they want to hear rather than what they need to hear most church members cannot see or understand the bible truths that apply to their lives they will quickly say that the commands of god do not apply to them and applied only to the believers who lived in the days of paul and other apostles the lord jesus christ said the blessing of god is upon the eyes of those who can see and hear the word repent and be converted last white raiment represents the righteousness of jesus christ which is a life of spiritual integrity that walks in obedience to the spirit and not the flesh jesus said that most laodicean church members were naked not clothed with a spirit-led life of integrity to the bible when true believers receive the baptism of the holy ghost they are being endued or clothed in power to live a life of integrity in obedience to the spirit here are a few examples to show whether churches have kept jesus's words with integrity churches publish how much food and money they give to the poor and yet jesus taught not to let anyone know about how much we give to others where is the integrity of secret giving church members frequently and willingly entertain lustful thoughts yet christ said those who lust in their hearts are guilty of committing adultery how many millions of church members attend movie theaters on saturday nights enjoying sinful love-making scenes murder scenes and more evil and then attend church on sunday mornings without repenting pretending they have christian integrity where is the integrity of a clean mind and thought life church members frequently use cuss words and even use god's name in vain where is the integrity of a bridal tongue james 1 verse 26 says if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain white raiment then has a deep spiritual meaning of godly integrity in obedience to the commands of jesus christ those without honest christian integrity are spiritually naked devoid of all christ's righteousness there is also a dual meaning for being clothed physically in god honoring raiment that directly relates to this book as jesus said these laodiceans were naked and unclothed it cannot be coincidental that our generation is both the most spiritually naked and physically naked generation of all time the history of american fashion contained in chapter 6 fully proves this point never before in this nation's history have churches been full of members dressed in sexually revealing fashions churches are full of women who flaunt shameful bobbed haircuts churches are full of women lacking the shamefaceness that paul commanded and instead their faces are painted like that of jezebel the counsel or advice of jesus christ is to be clothed both naturally and spiritually with modest apparel and spiritual integrity the only hope to be an overcomer in your day is to genuinely repent after receiving a rebuke from jesus who is the word of god as a true christian you should expect correction to come from the word of god that you hear preached in god-fearing churches this rebuke from jesus through his obedient preachers is a clear sign of jesus's love for his church for god chastens every child of his that he loves if you and i can receive correction from the word of god and zealously repent and change our minds and lives we can be overcomers in this day and be granted the reward that jesus promised to sit with him in his throne christ counsel is to choose obedience choose modest clothes to cover the areas of your body that tempt others choose clothes that pertain to your gender choose a clean make up free face and let it instead be lighted with the anointing of the holy spirit choose inexpensive and limited amounts of jewelry choose to keep your skin free from tattoo ink punctures piercings and scars choose footwear that is flat choose the perfect will of god for your outward appearance through a transformed mind choose to be part of god's plan to restore christian modesty choose to make yourself ready for the return of the lord jesus christ for our lord is coming for a wife that has made herself ready for her wedding day according to revelation 19 verse 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready this is the conclusion to restoring christian modesty god's perfect will for your outward appearance by jesse smith copyright jesse smith 2019 if you cannot afford a copy of this book please contact me at
