TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the mattress name of the lord jesus christ my name is jesse smith and i was asked to give my testimony so i always want to have a testimony prepared the bible says we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony i just like to start in my childhood you know growing up i had a wonderful childhood i had three older brothers what more could i ask for to play with my wonderful brothers later on the lord gave me a younger sister betsy and then a baby brother paul i had two loving parents my mom and dad were so loving i just have so many great memories from my childhood growing up the first time i started to realize how real jesus was was about second grade i didn't know it you know it was 1988 but my mom had been praying for a miracle and i didn't know that but eventually she came down sick and she went to the doctor they found out she had liver cancer which was uncurable at the time and i still remember this in the winter of 1988 driving in my grandmother's car to visit my mom in the hospital and i remember being told that my mom had six months to live and it was a very sad time one of my mom's friends was praying you know for my mom's healing and one morning she woke up and the holy spirit took my mom's friend to a scripture in psalms 118 verse 17 which says i shall not die but live and declare the works of the lord my mom told me that her friend was so inspired that she came right to the hospital where my mom was sitting in the hospital bed and told her this scripture and my mom said she just accepted it that god was going to heal her of this incurable cancer i'm not sure how much time passed but my mom told me later that the doctors wanted to have a little surgery to go inside and and look at the cancer and see if they could remove any of it according to my dad's testimony the night before the surgery and my dad went up to my mom while she's sleeping in the hospital bed and laid his hand on the location of the cancer and my dad prayed and said in the name of jesus christ i rebuked this cancer and i commanded to leave according to my mom's testimony the next day the doctors took her into surgery opened her up and they found that the cancer had vanished and my dad says that you know once my mom got home from the hospital with a full complete bill of health completely made well my dad says that he remembers my mom skipping and dancing and running out just to get the mail out at the mailbox and so the miracle my mom had prayed for god had fulfilled it and i remember you know in the next few years after that healing my mom would take all of us children at that time i believe she had six children and would take all of us to different churches around the toledo area testifying about the healing power of jesus christ so from that moment on i knew jesus christ was alive and well now my mom of course had taken us to church every sunday religiously and i'm so thankful she did it we had a wonderful supportive home church delta assembly of god the leadership there pastor randy and his wife kathy were so kind to us they were so supportive and i thank god that i grew up in that church and i was able to learn about god and i truly felt the love of god because of all their support a year or two later i was uh swimming with my brothers at my grandma smith's pond and i was you know getting older by that time i was probably third or fourth grade and i thought well i'm a big guy now i can swim across the pond and it was a pretty big pond uh and so i decided okay i'm gonna swim with all the big boys and i'm gonna try to go across the pond and i started off pretty good i was going pretty fast and as i got towards the the end of the pond i started getting really tired and i started getting scared and with all the boys splashing around me i got some water in my mouth i started choking and i remember this i remember choking on the water and i started sinking because i was running out of strength i was running out of just energy and i remember looking up and you know the water was now above me i remember seeing the sun and i remember thinking i'm going to drown i remember thinking this is it and it was a really scary moment i no energy left and i was just going down and all of a sudden out of nowhere my cousin matt demaline i don't know how he did this but he must have swam ahead of everybody he was of course older and stronger he must have saw me sinking down in the water because all of a sudden it was like too two strong arms reached down the water and just lifted me up and uh i remember getting up on shore and i was just kind of shocked and recovering but now i can look back and see that you know god saved my life through my cousin matt and i thank the lord that he did that and i'll always be grateful to matt for saving my life my dad during this time taught me the greatest lesson i ever learned in my life you know i was a sports fanatic i loved at that time i really loved baseball and so i was a big fan of the oakland a's you know mark maguire and jose conseco but my dad of course you know he'd seen the miracle when he prayed for my mom my dad was constantly reading the bible and one day he just taught me the greatest lesson i ever learned he took one of my jose canseco baseball cards and my dad knew how religious i was about my sports so my dad took the jose canseco baseball card and he said jesse did you know last year jose canseco hit 42 home runs and i was like that's right dad yep and then my dad started teaching me this lesson he said did you know jose conseco doesn't like sports cars i said well dad he does i i read a sports illustrated article uh recently that said he does like sports cars and then my dad went on and uh was giving me more questions that were that were wrong about jose canseco and i was a little bit confused and i said dad dad why are you asking me these questions and he said son he said i want to let you know he said the reason i can't deceive you about jose canseco is because you know him so well you've studied him you read about him all the time and he said jesse that's how you have to be with jesus christ he said you have to know jesus christ so well that no man can deceive you and to this day i still consider that the greatest lesson i ever learned was that you and i need to know jesus christ so well that no man can deceive us and later i found out reading scripture that jesus christ said let no man deceive you after all these great lessons i learned and seen god heal my mom in the fifth grade i actually tried to start serving the lord i had a friend named eric and he invited me to his word of life club and i really enjoyed it they gave you a three-ring binder i started memorizing the scriptures and and i really was trying to serve the lord but a little later i got involved with some friends in school and i started listening to worldly music and i still remember it very distinctly when i bought my first non-christian music cd i started listening to that that was actually the moment that i stepped away from walking on god's path i mean i still wasn't saved i had not repented of all my sins but i was just trying to serve the lord and i enjoyed memorizing the scripture but it was through music i fell away but then later around 1999 when i just started college i saw music bring me back to the lord and i i found it was scriptural that wherever you leave the lord you've got to go back to where you left him in order to find him and the example was with abraham and in genesis abraham left the promised land to go down to egypt in a time of famine but later when he returned to the promised land the bible said he had to come back to the very same altar he first set up so abraham to get right with god he had to come back to his original altar and worship there once he got to the promised land so i saw looking back in my life that music was where i left god but then music would be god's tool to bring me back to him after fifth grade uh went to middle school and as i said the music had kind of drawn me away from the lord i started listening to worse and worse music all the time and using worse and worse language and the whole time i knew it was wrong and then one of the saddest moments of my life was when my parents divorced when i was in seventh grade but i know all things work together for good to them that love the lord but later through the divorce i learned that god would show me the truth that no matter what happens no matter what we may seem to lack god allows trials and and difficult situations that he might manifest his power in order to give your testimony a certain ring to it so with my dad's absence god put godly men and godly influences in my life and it also taught me that even though i was left as a child it taught me that i should never leave my children as well and i don't fault my dad and mom for their divorce that's between them and god but i just realized god can use any situation to bring glory to himself and god said he will never leave us or forsake us and so even though my parents were divorced and i felt forsaken god never forsook me he always provided for me he always took care of me and he gave me wonderful male role models as well as i was growing up like teachers and coaches and even family friends one of them was bruce flory he was my friend's dad and he would take brian his son and i and we'd go play basketball and there'd be many times we'd take a break and he would kind of lecture me and and uh teach me about god and he would hold me accountable and it wasn't very easy when i was younger but now i can look back and i thank the lord uh for his influence in my life because he got he he always told me uh to honor god and obey god's word and do what was right also we had a high school football coach named tim spiess and every thursday before the games on friday he would print off bible devotionals and ask us to read them and those devotionals were always helpful because they always got me thinking about god and all i can do is look back now and thank god that he had placed different men in my life to hold me accountable and try to influence me to serve god rather than myself and as i grew up you know we went to high school and had a great high school experience and my whole focus was sports at that time so and that kind of goes with my theme of running the race for christ i was just a sports fanatic i loved everything about sports i played football basketball and ran track but i always remembered you know what god did for my mom and going to church every week hearing preaching and seeing the holy spirit move you know even at our home church there was many times i would hear tongues and interpretation and people would be healed and so the power of god was constantly moving you know in our church services and so i was always convicted about the holy spirit there were so many times in high school i wanted to surrender and give my heart to god and go up to the altar but i never could because i was afraid i love the things of the world too much you know one time when i was 16 i actually finally surrendered i went to a baptismal class and i got baptized and i was so happy i felt so good uh repenting but right afterwards i realized it wasn't a full repentance because as soon as i got into the car i turned on worldly music and that worldly music you know directed my thoughts towards evil things my words so i never really had the change i really wanted to experience but god knows my heart and god was working on me and he was he was dealing with me but by god's grace just a few years later i would finally repent and surrender so in high school i just fully devoted myself to running you know sports and god gave us a lot of success in high school in football we were state champions in 1997 and football was actually going to be a vehicle god was going to use to bring me to akron to fulfill my destiny i'd say you know one particular event was the state championship game in 1997 i caught a touchdown pass and it's just so strange looking back now i wasn't even trying to serve the lord but after i caught that touchdown pass i got on a knee and i gave thanks to jesus for just letting me catch that touchdown pass i didn't know it but there were scouts from the university of akron at the game watching me of course they were watching all the players but it was through that state championship that the coaches got my name they got my information and then the next year i signed a letter of intent for a full college scholarship to play football at akron university but again i see how god used football and sports to direct me to akron to fulfill my destiny as a christian one other sort of spiritual event from high school was my senior year was my last race at the state championship in dayton and our first day at the state championship didn't go so well we were disappointed and the second day didn't start very well either and so my brother cam walked up to me and he gave me some really inspiring words and after cam's kind of like pep talk i went out and won the state championship in the long jump and the 100 meter and the 200 meter dash and i went back and looked at the video and i remember in the 200 dash i would always get really tired at the end but i prayed i had my head down and i prayed before the race and asked the lord to help me to win the race i didn't think i was going to win it but after praying i ran the race and after i won the race i remember i lifted my hands and i just shouted out and i thank god for letting me win the race and i'm not even a christian yet but i recognize god's power in my mother's life and the power of the holy spirit moving in our home church and i still gave god praise because i knew everything was by god's grace because i learned later sports records really aren't important to god records are made records fall no one really cares anymore i don't really care anymore but i saw how god was using it to teach me that he wanted me to run for him god was teaching me parallels between an athletic life and the christian life and i found out later that paul said know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temper in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we an incorruptible crown so looking back now i can see how i devoted my entire life to running and to win the state championship to win the medal or the crown and god was showing me i have to be even more dedicated in order to win the incorruptible crown or the incorruptible medal eternal life through jesus christ our lord so in the fall of 1999 i went off to college and when i got there the doctors found out i had a fracture in my fifth lumbar i believe and so i had to sit out the whole fall season i couldn't play football i had to wear a brace but it was a time where i got to make some friends and god sent christian friends into my life like zach durr and then pastor mike arnold and since i had all this free time i was able to meet with mike and just get thinking about the things of god so in my freshman year i had this back brace on and um i was injured so i would have lots of weekends where i could drive home and see my girlfriend kristen and when i would go home my brother cam would let me borrow his car now cam had just become a christian he was the first one in our family to give his heart to the lord and so he was the answer to my mom's prayers all those years of taking her kids to church and wanting to see them save cam was the first one and then simon gave his heart to lord and i believe i was third when i finally gave my heart to the lord but driving cam's car he had his christian music in his car and one of the songs was called one of these days by ffh and i just remember the lyrics and they were saying one of these days i'm going to see the hands that took the nails for me and even as a sinner you know i was cussing and swearing i was addicted to tobacco watching all kinds of evil things but even as a sinner with a desire to serve god that music started softening my heart i could feel my heart of stone slowly breaking and through that music i started listening i started asking cam for to borrow his music and listen to his christian music it was through that music that god was bringing me back to him because i left god by listening to the wrong music and now listening to the right music was bringing me back to the lord and around the new year around 2000 there was an athletes in action conference and i was invited to go when i got there i was just nervous you know around people but i saw a football player named tim anderson i'd known and he was sitting in the row in front of me and and i saw tim raise his hands and praise god at that moment i was so ashamed of my sin i was so ashamed of running from god and not living a real christian life that i started crying and i repented of my sin that very night and i was determined from this moment on i'm going to serve jesus christ with all my heart i didn't know this but on the very same night three hours away my girlfriend who's my wife now kristen went to a sanctus real concert and she had been to numerous concerts before but they kind of gave an altar call and she gave her heart to the lord on the very same night and so we can see god's supernatural hand she and i were just dating at the time we weren't christians but i can see god's hand to save us on the very same night three hours apart without any plans without any talk previously about christianity at all and so god was saving my future wife and i on the very same night getting us in one accord and in one mind and later we would get married and have children and serve the lord as the pastor and pastor's wife at the church in akron after the conference ended i remember specifically going back into my dorm and i was determined to serve jesus christ and i remember pulling down all my pictures off the wall of uh immorally dressed women and throwing them in the trash and i remember taking all my music you know i'd snoop dogg metallica nirvana i had country music i took all my worldly music and i threw it out in the trash can right outside our door and i started living a life the life god has always wanted me to live a real christian life he started cleaning me out he filled me with joy gladness happiness and i was so i was finally doing what i was called to do serve jesus christ college was a great experience after i was saved i was finally saved i finally got to go to church and raise my hands and read the bible for myself it was a wonderful time i felt like a transformed person i tried to witness to all my high school friends and give them sermons and try to influence anyone i could towards jesus christ i was also playing football and had some great experiences i got to play at the horseshoe in columbus i played against michael vick at virginia tech i played against ben rossberger at miami and while playing football i still had a desire uh to go to the nfl and i was working out and getting stronger i was up to about 190 pounds and i'd set two records uh there at akron for defensive backs with speed in the 40 and then vertical jump but before the beginning of my sophomore season in the summer time we were playing seven on seven and i was number one on the depth chart in other words i was going to be the starting corner uh going into the next season i remember i deflected a pass when we're playing seven on seven and i landed on my and i landed on my left shoulder and separated my ac joint so that caused me to miss almost the whole season uh my sophomore year and after that i could never get as strong i could never get as fast no matter what i tried and i really look back now and i see it was god kind of shutting down my plans and my desires to try to become a professional football player and getting me more focused on him another life-changing event from college happened on thanksgiving night 2001. we were gathered at my family's house in wadsworth and my brother simon had recently given his heart to the lord and i really started studying the scripture and he said jess you've got to listen to this sermon it's called two seeds you gotta listen to it i said okay buddy okay so later that night we drove back to akron where i was living on the college campus and we listened to this sermon called two seeds and my eyes were totally opened uh the bible became a new bible and so at that time i started believing what we call the message of the hour which is god's revelation for today the whole bible restored the same power uh the same truth the same doctrine and that's according to prophecy jesus said in matthew 17 11 that elias would come and restore all things and acts 3 20-21 says that heaven will receive jesus until the restitution of all things so now in college the bible that i've loved now for a couple years has become a brand new bible and god begins revealing himself to me in ways that i never knew before there was times before i knew the message of the hour that i would just kind of scratch my head and what does that mean in the scripture but then after simon brought me these revelations and showed me the the truth from scripture the bible finally started to make sense and it was as jesus said he said the holy spirit will guide you into all truth and that's what i wanted all i wanted was truth as a christian i didn't care which group i had to belong to all i wanted to do was know the truth believe the truth and live the truth in june of 2003 my wife and i were married it was a wonderful day but the day after we went to church and that was the day where the holy spirit filled me i remember we got there a little late but brother brooks was preaching the word of god in power and he was he was focusing on how the blood of jesus christ separates you from all your sins and it will cleanse you and it keeps you and it will guide you into every good work according to hebrews 13. and i remember he was just preaching under the anointing i got so emotional and loving god i just stood up and it was at that moment it's the only time it happened it felt like i had a vision in my mind and i saw i saw jesus on the cross and i saw them nailing the nails into his hands and i started weeping and i could feel the vibrations of the nail pounds and i just after he was nailed to the cross i just started worshiping him and praising him and asking god to forgive me and and i just was just praising him and magnifying the name of the lord and as i left that church i felt like i've never felt before i was so full of love i remember shaking people's hands and just thinking i just want to love people i just want to share god's love with everyone and so i realized that was the moment i was born again because the bible says the love of god is shed in your hearts by the holy ghost i'd been seeking the holy ghost for a couple years at that point and i never really felt like i had a real experience where heaven came down to dwell in my soul but i believe on that day the day after i was married i believe god came down and filled my soul with his holy ghost his seal with the love of god so during my senior year of college after the football season ended my friend tim myers kept urging me to preach and i knew i i knew i needed to i always after i became a follower of the message of the hour i just always felt a pull to the pulpit and tim was praying of course working on me and so in january of 2004 i finally started preaching the gospel i just started there in akron ohio and then i got an invitation from my future pastor isaiah brooks to preach in lima and i really want to know if god wanted me to preach so i fasted a couple days before preaching and i just said god please prove to me that you want me to preach your gospel and even before i preach there was a sister named karen sanders and she gave like a word of knowledge right before i started speaking and it was almost prophetic uh for telling what i was going to preach on and after i preached god's word the altar was full of people repenting crying weeping uh rededicating their lives to the lord i know one brother in particular came up and told me he got delivered from an addiction after that service and so the lord had proven to me that i was to preach the gospel and i thank the lord for that i just want to serve the lord in any capacity that i can after preaching for a few months brother brooks ordained me in august of 2004 as a minister of the gospel about two years later um the lord kind of put it on our hearts to start a church in akron and so we prayed beforehand we talked with our pastor isaiah brooks and in june of 2006 we started a church in akron and i remember i was before we decided i remember i was just you know praying about it and meditating on the things of god and i was i was up sitting uh in my upstairs in chicago falls and i said lord if you want me to be a pastor please show me and i've never done this before and i've never done it since but i just said lord i'm going to open up the bible and and please just speak to me through your bible if you really want me to be a pastor or not i've already i'd already been preaching about two years but i didn't know if i had it i didn't know if i should pass or not so i just close my bible and i open it up and i put my finger down on a page and i pointed to first timothy 4 12 and it said let no man despise thy youth be thou an example of the believers in word and conversation in charity and spirit in faith and in purity so anyone that knows this passage uh knows that paul was encouraging a young preacher named timothy uh to preach god's word despite how young he was and so i took that as my final vindication that god wanted me to pastor and so i started pastoring at 25 years old in akron ohio we started a church with seven wonderful faithful members so the next few years saw my wife and i grow our family god blessed us with uh multiple children we're so grateful for all of them around 2009 i started getting a desire to preach overseas and so from 2009 to 2013 i made uh four trips to south america and trinidad and preached the word of god there and it was during this time that god really showed me the power of the gospel of jesus christ one trip in particular i saw so much supernatural for about 13 days it just felt like i was just constantly walking in the presence of god one night in particular we just finished up a series of meetings and i was doing my my journaling at the end of the day as i normally did when i traveled and someone knocked on my door and and they said you need to come out and pray for this young lady she's got a demon on her and i'll be honest i was very nervous i never cast out a demon before and so i went out there and talked with her and there was all this crowd of young people gathered around maybe 10 or 12 people and and this girl was just staring ahead and she'd barely talk and and you could tell something was wrong with her i didn't know what to do i know they wanted me to pray for her but all of a sudden uh the words of a minister brother troy swadey his words i'd heard him say a few days earlier it felt like they dropped down from heaven and the words came to my mind it said perfect love casts out demons and once that anointing dropped down i knew god was going to drive the demons out of this young lady and then the scripture came to me before jesus did a miracle many times he would put out all the unbelievers and so we were out in just a kind of public setting so i said well i called a few pastors and preachers i said hey let's go pray for this girl i said would you come with me so i knew we had to get away from any of the unbelief and all the commotion so that god could deliver this woman so we took her over far away from the crowd and we just joined hands and i was so confident because that anointing dropped down we joined hands and i asked her i said do you want to be delivered from this demon you know and she's staring ahead and she said yes she just nod her head and said yes and i close my eyes and i said in the name of jesus christ i said by the blood of jesus christ satan the holy spirit is against you and as soon as i said that this woman who i was holding her hand started shaking and fighting me but i was i was totally calm because of the holy spirit and i just kept praying and i started rebuking the devil in the name of jesus christ and pretty soon she let out this loud scream and just fell down to the ground and was passed out and we stood there for a few moments uh and then we tried to wake her up eventually she woke up and she stood up and her face had totally changed and i said let's stand here let's give god praise for god delivering you from this uh evil spirit and later i found out in the scripture in mark chapter 9 that the same thing happened when jesus cast out devils in mark 9 26 the bible said the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead in so much that many said he is dead but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose on that trip there was probably four or five more times that we cast demons out of people one time one of the women even bit me but you know no blood was shed and i thank the lord for that one time the demon fought so hard at the girl that the girl's glasses flew off her they were stomped on but by god's grace we had enough money there we gave her some money to pay for the glasses so that satan wouldn't get the victory but god would get the victory and even returning home to united states there's been a couple of times i've seen uh the same power of god to cast out demons out of people and each time it has been the same where they'll cry out and then it looks like they passed out but then they come back and they feel better and they rejoice and so it's beautiful to see that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he still drives out demons when people want to be free from demons and may god get all the glory for each time this happens there were a couple more really powerful testimonies from guyana before the final service on one of the trips i fasted the whole day prayed studied all day and i preached through god's anointing for about two hours maybe more and the power of the holy ghost was so strong in that place there was a long prayer line maybe 10 or 20 people come up for prayer for different needs one man in particular was an older man and he came up and he said he had trouble with arthritis we prayed for him and he kind of went to the back of the line we prayed for people to get the holy ghost and they were screaming and crying and praising the lord it was a wonderful time after i sat down the gentleman the older gentleman came up and tapped me said brother jesse he said god has healed me of my arthritis and i was just so tired but i was sweating but i said praise the lord i said brother you go up there and testify so he you know gently asked for a chance to testify he got the microphone and he shared what god did and so he marched up and down uh the front of the church back and forth just rejoicing and declaring how god had held him of arthritis there's another great testimony where we were preaching at a different church and it was a hot day i remember as a wednesday morning we had a morning service and it was the only sermon i ever preached without looking at my notes one time i preached on astronaut faith which is basically a message about how um as science has progressed so god's word has progressed the revelation of it and there was so many people that were just paying attention and listening but one in particular was a young mother and she was holding a baby throughout the whole service and she came up for prayer and she said she had a kidney stone and she would like prayer for that i said of course sister we'll pray for you and it was a more quiet service but after the service we sang we prayed i just went outside the church building and sat on a little bench and i was just wiping the sweat off my brow and all of a sudden this young mother comes up and she's she's so filled with joy you can see the joy on her face and she said brother jesse i just want to share with you after you prayed for me for the kidney stone she said i went back to my seat and i held my baby there and i was just praising the lord and she said as i was singing i felt the power of god calm down really warm upon my kidney stone and she said she didn't know what it was but it got really warm and then she said she felt that kidney stone leave down her leg and go out of her body and she said i just want to tell you that god has healed me of the kidney stone and we just i just sat there rejoicing and praising the lord and so those trips to guyana really showed me the power of god and how if we come with faith jesus said all things are possible to them that believe over the years we've continued to pastor in akron we just passed our 14th anniversary we've had many great highlights over the years i'll just share a couple to encourage you you know one morning i woke up and i was really led of the holy spirit on a sunday morning to preach and i preached a sermon called five identifications of her true church a wonderful message originally preached by brother branham and i came to church and i preached it and a sister came up i'm going to try not to use names came up for prayer and said she had bleeding kind of like female trouble and we just prayed for her and she said as soon as we prayed she felt the blood dry up she said as we prayed the blood dried up and then she and her husband called me the next day on a monday night and just were rejoicing telling me how god had healed her and reminded me of the scripture when the woman with the blood issue you know by faith she had to come and press through the crowd and when she touched jesus the virtue and power of christ flowed out of him into her and she felt the bleeding dry up in her body and god had given the victory and her faith had brought about the healing so that was another moment where the power of god from the bible was proven to be the same here in our day and i believe that was 2015 if i'm not mistaken recently we've seen god move through the power of the speaking of the word you know jesus said if you speak to the mountain and if you say move he said if you doubt not he said you'll have what you asked for and the mountain will move recently we've seen this in about four cases and i'm going to try not to use names just for people's uh privacy but the first time we saw it was with the brother from our church named jose we went and visited one of his family members and it was a couple that couldn't have children and so jose said they wanted prayer so we just went over there i remember jose had his guitar we just sang a few songs and i really felt the anointing of god there and we said we're going to pray for you that you can have a baby and we prayed and people were weeping and crying just praising the lord in a real simple humble atmosphere and jose looked at them and he said you're going to have a baby now i was a little nervous at that time i was enjoying the anointing but god had spoken through our brother that god had heard our prayers and they were going to have a baby i'd forgotten about it but fast forward to the the next november i got a text from brother jose saying that this couple had had a baby boy and it was born on my birthday and so that was a great moment where god was showing me his power and i believe he was just showing me his grace that when we follow his leadership when we minister to other people when we speak his word in faith god hears us and god answers and god moves in his time and season not long after that there was a co-worker i had and she and her husband couldn't have children and so i was trying to encourage her i did a bible study with her went over to her house and met with her and her husband i was just really burdened for this this co-worker and you know just like any of us she would battle and say well i don't know we will probably never have a child or anything like that and i was just really impressed and one saturday morning i was just in i was just in prayer and i got on my knees and the anointing of god just came over me i remember there i was just looking out my back window and i said in the name of jesus christ i speak to that mountain of barrenness i speak to that mountain of infertility and i command commanded to move in the name of jesus christ now i'm weeping i'm crying i knew something supernatural had happened after i studied i went upstairs and told my wife i said i think i prophesied or i think i foretold in the name of the lord that this couple's gonna have a baby and it was just a few days or weeks after that i couldn't quite remember what it was i got a text from that co-worker and she and her husband sent me a picture of their pregnancy test that they were pregnant and then nine months later they had a little baby girl so that was just a beautiful moment when there was a lot of doubt and everybody was battling doubt we speak god's word and mountains have to move when they're commanded to move through the name of jesus christ the last one i'll share was just something that happened this past year there's a brother in our church and his dad had a heart attack and uh he had actually died and his daughter gave him mouth-to-mouth cpr but then thankfully the paramedics were able to shock his heart and bring him back to life and that happened on a tuesday night i remember and i didn't know anything about it well that night i had trouble sleeping and i woke up for some reason at 4 15 a.m and there was just three scriptures on my heart and one of them was there's power of life and death in the tongue well later that morning i was working and i got a call from a brother in our church brother amen and he let me know about the heart attack and he said can you pray and i just again felt the presence of the holy spirit and so i said yeah let's pray i left my office and i went out to our deck and i had the phone here and i was looking out you know at the morning sky and as we prayed let's i said let's just agree and i said i speak to the mountain of that heart trouble in the name of jesus christ and i command it to leave and we just agreed we just agreed by faith uh now two weeks went by and nothing seemed to get better uh because of coven 19 uh the family wasn't even allowed to see him but the following sunday the brother in our church his son came up and uh we prayed with a prayer cloth and just believed god was going to do something and we would just keep encouraging ourselves just speak life speak life he's going to be well just speak life and so the brother in our church went to see his dad and the nurses or doctor tried to say or tried to convince him to pull the plug because he wasn't even breathing on his own and the brother in our church wouldn't accept that he wouldn't take that for an answer and we just kept praying and believing speaking the word well two days later after that visit his dad woke up and then not long after that he started talking and it didn't make sense at first but it pretty soon it started making sense and then just a few days after he woke up he went home just as the holy spirit spoke and now this is a month or two later uh he's back to his normal life i guess he goes out in the garage works and just as it was spoken by the holy spirit uh the mountain of the heart trouble left and now he's back home he's well even though the doctor said uh he was going to die and there was no hope for him the spoken word of the holy spirit moved in a great way and it will always operate to give god glory jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and just wait for his anointing wait for his leadership because jesus said apart from me you can do nothing we don't have any power of ourselves to do anything supernatural but if we speak god's word when god tells us to do it and believe it and stay with it god will move and god will be glorified in your life and you'll see the supernatural power of jesus christ operate for his glory so in closing i just want to encourage you to run the race for jesus christ running and athletic events was a big part of my life that's how i met a lot of people you know through high school sporting events and college sporting events but those were great lessons i learned a lot of great lessons through sports eating right sleeping right taking care of your body being fully devoted to sports and god used all those sporting events to show me how he wanted me to serve him just as i had worked so hard in sports and been so dedicated god was showing me i need to show that same dedication to being a christian and in high school i love sprinting events but now god has shown me the christian life is a distance event and the bible says run the race for jesus christ like you will be the one that will win the race take care of your body take care of your mind and so i've learned with sports i could have a few days off running for athletic events and for athletic purposes but with jesus christ i've learned i don't want to take any days off i want to run every day for jesus christ i want to be fully devoted for jesus christ i want to discipline my body my mind my spirit my thinking i want to love the lord my god with all my heart soul mind and strength so i want to encourage all the listeners if you're not running for jesus christ i would encourage you start running the race it is the only race that really matters to run the christian race follow acts 2 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost true repentance is changing your mind and actions heartily making amends for past wrongs and hating sin god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
