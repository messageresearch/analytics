[0:10] God bless you and welcome to the
[0:12] defending the message podcast I'm your
[0:14] co-host Pastor Jesse Smith and today I'm
[0:17] hosting solo due to some busy schedules
[0:19] but by the grace of God we're excited
[0:21] for another episode today for this
[0:23] episode I'm going to answer a listener's
[0:25] question about the number of baptisms
[0:27] that took place in Jeffersonville
[0:28] Indiana in 1933 when brother Brennan was
[0:31] baptizing new Believers in the Ohio
[0:33] River the question was what
[0:35] documentation do you have brother Jesse
[0:37] to defend brother random's claim that
[0:40] 500 were baptized rather than 14 as
[0:43] brother Ram's accusers claim were
[0:45] baptized so I'll get to the answer
[0:47] shortly but let me say this is the
[0:49] second podcast episode defending brother
[0:51] Branham against his accusers as episode
[0:54] 3 was the previous episode in which we
[0:56] defended brother Branham against the
[0:57] plagiarism accusation Lord willing we'll
[1:00] probably do another podcast defending by
[1:02] the Rams Revelations about the church
[1:03] ages and the Seven Seals in the future
[1:05] by the grace of God and again Lord
[1:08] willing we'll probably do more type of
[1:09] these types of a podcast defending
[1:11] brother random against all these false
[1:13] accusations that are coming upon him
[1:15] lately as time allows
[1:18] I think you'll see though that a lot of
[1:19] these accusations against brother
[1:20] Branham are pure presumption and not
[1:23] fact
[1:25] also we do have more testimonies from
[1:26] the Saints in our church that we'll get
[1:28] to they're already recorded but there's
[1:30] a few details that need to get worked
[1:31] out and more edits that need made so
[1:34] Lord willing will be publishing those in
[1:35] the future by the grace of God
[1:38] so here's the outline for the podcast
[1:39] first we'll look at the viewers question
[1:42] and my answer
[1:44] second we'll look at how signs are never
[1:46] ahead of the word of God
[1:48] and third we'll look at undeniable proof
[1:50] brother Brandon was God's prophet in my
[1:53] humble opinion
[1:58] viewer question and answer
[2:01] if you were recently emailed me and
[2:03] asked this question that went something
[2:04] like this
[2:06] one of brother Brown's accusers on his
[2:08] website said a Jeffersonville newspaper
[2:10] article said only 14 were converted at
[2:13] the Ohio river in 1933 but brother
[2:16] Branham said many more in fact 500.
[2:19] brother random also said after the 17th
[2:22] baptism the voice said as John the
[2:24] Baptist was sent to forerun Jesus first
[2:26] coming so your message will forerun his
[2:28] second coming brother Jesse what
[2:30] documentation do you have to defend
[2:32] brother Branham and my answer was
[2:34] brother I have no documentation but this
[2:37] accusation against brother Branham is
[2:38] like men in the other accusations
[2:40] against brother Branham it's solely
[2:41] based upon presumption and ultimately
[2:44] this accusation comes down to brother
[2:46] Adam's word against the newspaper
[2:48] brother random is not here to defend
[2:50] himself so we will never know the answer
[2:53] to this question we will never have
[2:54] actual documentation proving brother
[2:56] Branham was right or wrong now of course
[2:58] I believe brother Brown was right
[3:00] although he could have been exaggerating
[3:01] for example if he baptized Believers for
[3:04] five hours he would have had to have
[3:05] baptized 100 Believers per hour during
[3:08] those 1933 Revival meetings
[3:11] briefly I'd like to look at the exact
[3:12] accusation from the website of course
[3:15] this is one of brother Ram's main
[3:16] accusers his website says quote to date
[3:19] only one single article can be
[3:21] identified from May 1933 published in
[3:24] the local Jeffersonville Evening News 14
[3:27] converted 14 conversions are reported in
[3:30] attempt meeting conducted at 8th and
[3:32] Pratt streets by the Reverend William
[3:34] Marion Branham June 2nd 1933
[3:37] Jeffersonville Evening News end quote
[3:40] so this is the website that the viewer
[3:43] was asking about so brother Ram's
[3:46] accuser is basically saying brother M
[3:47] lied and the newspaper was right only 14
[3:50] people were converted and so there could
[3:52] not have been a 17th person baptized and
[3:55] so there was no voice from Heaven
[3:56] speaking of brother Brown being the
[3:58] Forerunner of Jesus's second coming and
[4:00] they say 500 baptisms was not possible
[4:02] either I like to play the quote from
[4:04] Brother Brian where he says he baptized
[4:06] 500 and then the voice was heard that
[4:08] said he would forerun the second coming
[4:10] of Jesus Christ let's listen to the
[4:12] quote from go away Jesus 1963.
[4:15] that day down there about 33 years ago
[4:18] 34 stand on the banks of the Ohio River
[4:21] there at the bridge and about 5 000
[4:24] people or more gathered on the banks uh
[4:27] just about 20 years old 23 22-23 years
[4:30] old my first Revival I was baptizing 500
[4:33] people that afternoon and the deacons
[4:36] that led me out in the water not the
[4:38] 17th person when I was baptizing I heard
[4:41] a boy say look up
[4:43] I turn to look up Billy's mother we
[4:46] wasn't even married then just going
[4:48] together
[4:49] here come that Pillar of Fire circling
[4:52] out of the bright blue skies at two
[4:54] o'clock on June the 15th coming right
[4:56] down out of the Skies like that and the
[4:58] boys roared out all over the place there
[5:01] and said as John the Baptist was sent
[5:04] forth the forerun the first coming of
[5:05] Christ you have the message you'll have
[5:08] forerun this second coming of Christ
[5:11] photographers taking the picture
[5:14] also it's clear that brother Brown
[5:16] admitted that he usually exaggerated
[5:19] numbers so I want to play that quote as
[5:21] well this is from straight As the gate
[5:22] 1959.
[5:25] very good that uh making a Thor
[5:30] estimating crowds because
[5:33] I usually exaggerate on it
[5:36] so having all these quotes and all this
[5:39] information again I would say I have no
[5:40] documentation the only way to know for
[5:42] sure was to have been there but I wasn't
[5:44] there and I don't know anyone who was
[5:46] there and brother random is not here to
[5:48] defend himself so the main point is that
[5:50] there was a Revival in 1933 with
[5:53] baptisms and a supernatural voice spoke
[5:56] of brother branham's message that would
[5:58] forerun the second coming of Jesus
[6:00] Christ
[6:01] friends brother Ram's accusers are
[6:03] constantly doing anything to distract
[6:05] Believers away from the Bible verses
[6:07] that brother Branham pointed us to or
[6:09] his bible-based message
[6:11] at some point perhaps in the future I'll
[6:13] show how these accusers they love rock
[6:15] and roll women preachers sinful movies
[6:18] allow women to cut their hair in
[6:20] dishonor dressing up for Halloween as
[6:22] Dracula and more sinful behaviors
[6:25] as Jesus said by their fruits they are
[6:27] known
[6:28] these accusers of brother Branham
[6:30] despise the fact that God is one person
[6:32] that there are three works of Grace that
[6:35] there are hair and modesty standards in
[6:36] the Bible and other Pauline teachings as
[6:39] we'll get to later in other words these
[6:41] accusers do not love the spirit of Truth
[6:43] they are not being guided into all truth
[6:45] as Jesus said real Believers would in
[6:48] John 16 verse 13.
[6:50] so when closing out this section again I
[6:52] told the brother I have no official
[6:55] documentation about how many people were
[6:56] baptized and we have to remember we
[6:58] cannot make the newspaper the absolute
[7:00] because there's only one absolute that's
[7:02] the word of God that's one form of the
[7:04] absolute and then the person of Jesus
[7:06] Christ the Holy Ghost he's the absolute
[7:08] so I cannot prove for certain how many
[7:11] people were baptized but neither can
[7:13] brother Adam's accusers all they can do
[7:15] is point to one newspaper article but we
[7:17] cannot make that newspaper article a
[7:19] thus saith the Lord
[7:22] foreign
[7:25] next let's look at signs are never ahead
[7:28] of the word of God
[7:30] I told this brother in the email that
[7:32] there is no way for either side to prove
[7:34] they are right whether it's brother
[7:35] random side or brother Ram's accusers so
[7:38] I told him the proof is the word test
[7:40] brother Ram taught us the word on the
[7:42] godhead water baptism and more the main
[7:45] thing to focus on is the word of God
[7:47] that brother random restored and not to
[7:49] over emphasize the signs of his ministry
[7:52] even when I debated those that left a
[7:54] message in September 2020 I emphasized
[7:57] the word that brother Ryan restored and
[7:59] not the sign so much of course I believe
[8:02] the signs that God gave to brother
[8:03] Branham but an unbeliever will never
[8:05] believe those
[8:06] but the unbeliever cannot deny the word
[8:08] of God that brother and restored through
[8:10] the Holy Ghost leading and through
[8:12] Jesus's role for him as the seventh
[8:14] angel and as a restoration prophet
[8:18] also I share with the brother in this
[8:19] email this quote from Brother Branham
[8:20] from the spoken word is the Original
[8:22] Seed where brother Branham said God
[8:23] never placed signs ahead of his word
[8:26] so this quote seemed to help the brother
[8:27] because we must apply this quote even to
[8:30] brother Ram's own Ministry we must put
[8:32] the word of God that brother man
[8:33] restored ahead of the signs even Jesus
[8:36] mentioned this in a story he told in the
[8:38] Book of Luke about the rich man and the
[8:40] poor beggar named Lazarus when the rich
[8:43] man was in hell he asked Abraham to send
[8:45] back Lazarus from the dead that his
[8:47] other brothers would believe and not go
[8:49] to hell but Abraham answered and said if
[8:52] one rose from the dead they wouldn't
[8:53] believe anyway he said they should
[8:55] believe simply from the law of Moses and
[8:57] so we see Jesus giving us the same
[8:59] principle God never placed signs ahead
[9:02] of his word so let's listen to the quote
[9:04] from the spoken word is the Original
[9:06] Seed
[9:07] God never placed signs ahead of his word
[9:13] hey man that's a scorcher
[9:17] God never placed signs ahead of his word
[9:20] they were added for proof of the word
[9:22] but the word is first
[9:30] approval
[9:31] Elijah said to the woman make me a cake
[9:35] first
[9:36] then watch the miracle happen
[9:39] come to the word first and then what's
[9:41] the miracle
[9:42] the seat word itself is what the Holy
[9:46] Spirit energizes
[9:54] lastly here's undeniable proof that
[9:56] brother bran was God's Vindicated
[9:58] prophet in my humble opinion as I Was
[10:01] preparing for this podcast I had these
[10:02] thoughts about trying to come up with an
[10:04] undeniable proof that brother Ram was
[10:06] God's prophet and it reminded me of a
[10:09] little bit of what I wrote in my 2021
[10:10] book to begin with there are six
[10:13] passages of scripture that declare an
[10:15] authoritative biblical truth about
[10:17] Elijah's spirit in the end time they are
[10:20] Acts 3 20 and 21 Matthew 17 verses 11
[10:23] and 12 Malachi 4 verses 5 and 6
[10:26] Revelation 10 verses 7 through 11 Amos 3
[10:30] verse 7 and Luke 17 verse 30.
[10:34] these six passages give us this
[10:36] authoritative declaration that is Jesus
[10:39] will remain in heaven and not physically
[10:41] return to the Earth until all things
[10:43] including Bible doctrines and the hearts
[10:45] of the Believers are restored to their
[10:47] original Apostolic conditions by the
[10:50] preaching of a prophet Anointed with the
[10:52] spirit of Elijah
[10:54] and again I share this on the September
[10:56] 2020 debate with an accuser brother
[10:58] Branham and they could say nothing
[11:00] against it they just avoided the topic
[11:03] now closely related to this
[11:04] authoritative declaration is the fact
[11:07] that brother random revealed 12 New
[11:09] Testament Mysteries six of them would
[11:11] thus saith the Lord which were the
[11:13] godhead Israel's blindness the baptism
[11:16] of the Holy Ghost the seven Church ages
[11:18] the mother Harlot and the Mystery of
[11:21] iniquity
[11:22] additionally brother Brown gave us eight
[11:24] doctrines with thus saith the Lord first
[11:25] the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism was
[11:27] the true baptism marriage and divorce
[11:30] third the Fulfillment of the image of
[11:33] Daniel chapter 2 with Rome ruling at the
[11:35] end time
[11:36] fourth women who purposely dress
[11:38] immodestly will answer for committing
[11:39] spiritual adultery on the day of
[11:41] judgment
[11:42] fifth a woman who cuts her hair is
[11:44] spiritually dead or not born again
[11:46] because of the shame or repulse she's
[11:49] bringing upon her husband Christ and God
[11:52] sixth brother random's Bible teachings
[11:54] are restoring God's people back to the
[11:55] fullness of Pentecost according to Joel
[11:58] 2 verses 23-26 7 there is an Elijah
[12:01] Messenger to the Gentiles according to
[12:03] Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 and 8 the fourth
[12:07] Ministry of Elijah appeared in the
[12:09] United States in the 1960s and again
[12:11] brother Ram said all of those with thus
[12:13] saith the Lord
[12:15] additionally brother Ram gave us at
[12:17] least five fulfilled prophecies with us
[12:19] saith the Lord
[12:20] he correctly prophesied the passing of
[12:22] Florence shakarin in 1965 just as Elijah
[12:26] foretold king ahaziah of his certain
[12:28] death in Second Kings 1 verses 1 through
[12:30] 17.
[12:32] second he foretold the healing of
[12:34] Florence Humes in 1955
[12:36] third he said there would be no greater
[12:38] gift arise to the Gentiles outside of
[12:41] his in 1961. fourth brother random
[12:44] prophesied of the immoral condition of
[12:46] American churches in April 1965 that
[12:49] certainly come to pass and fifth in July
[12:51] 1965 brother random said it was
[12:54] impossible for Christian denominations
[12:56] to return to the apostolic gospel and
[12:59] there was a certainty of their
[13:00] acceptance of the future Pope Antichrist
[13:03] next in connection to Malachi chapter 4
[13:06] verses 5 and 6. brother Brandon would
[13:08] turn our hearts back to the apostolic
[13:10] fathers which brother Ram said with thus
[13:12] saith the Lord in Souls that are in
[13:14] prison 1963 meaning he would turn our
[13:17] hearts back to the gospel that Jesus
[13:19] Christ revealed to Paul and I have at
[13:21] least 14 Pauline doctrines that most
[13:23] churches reject today but we accept
[13:25] proving we have to be the Bride of Jesus
[13:28] Christ
[13:30] these 14 doctrines are the water baptism
[13:32] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[13:35] three works of Grace
[13:36] the godhead is one person
[13:39] the restoration of the gifts of the Holy
[13:41] Ghost
[13:41] homosexuality is wrong adultery is wrong
[13:45] fornication is wrong murdering through
[13:48] abortions or birth control pills is
[13:50] wrong
[13:50] women preachers is wrong
[13:53] all substance abuse is wrong whether
[13:55] cigarettes weed or any other drug
[13:57] viewing sinful content is wrong
[14:00] shameful hair lengths are wrong
[14:03] false conversions are wrong like saying
[14:05] a scripted prayer of repentance
[14:07] and lastly number 14 wearing immodest
[14:11] clothing is wrong
[14:13] finally friends brother Branham had
[14:14] Supernatural discernments and healings
[14:16] like in the case of Florence Humes and
[14:19] Congressman Upshaw it's recorded on tape
[14:21] in 1955 that brother Ram discerned
[14:23] Florence hume's condition of
[14:25] tuberculosis
[14:27] and then he spoke her healing in the
[14:28] name of Jesus Christ and of course she
[14:30] recovered having many more children
[14:32] grandchildren and great-grandchildren
[14:34] while we don't have Congressman upshaw's
[14:36] miraculous moment recorded on tape he is
[14:39] recorded on tape as testifying of that
[14:41] miraculous healing later on before he
[14:44] passed away
[14:45] a third example is Marilyn Hickey now
[14:48] she's a woman preacher today which we
[14:50] disagree with but brother Ram discerned
[14:52] her infertility her inability to have
[14:54] children in 1956 and then 10 years later
[14:57] she had her one and only child and
[14:59] brother Ram foretold that child coming
[15:01] with thus saith the Lord and it came to
[15:03] pass
[15:04] so friends there could be so much more
[15:06] said but I believe all these statements
[15:08] give us an undeniable proof that brother
[15:10] bran was God's Vindicated prophet
[15:13] and so again we never Place signs ahead
[15:15] of the word of God we've got to place
[15:17] the word of God first
[15:24] we've come to the end of the podcast
[15:25] friends and I hope this was a blessing
[15:27] to you I appreciate the viewer asking
[15:29] this question and hope the answer has
[15:31] been a help to the Saints by the grace
[15:33] of God and again friends many of these
[15:35] recent accusations against brother
[15:37] Branham cannot be proven
[15:39] because brother Ram is not here to
[15:40] defend himself and answer their
[15:42] questions
[15:43] a lot of the claims of brothers accusers
[15:45] are just presumption and not fact but
[15:48] the facts we have are the Bible
[15:49] revelations that God gave to brother
[15:50] Branham because Jesus Christ vindicates
[15:53] these revelations in the Bible and in
[15:55] our lives today that's what drew me to
[15:57] the message it was the Bible revelations
[15:59] that brother random had to fulfill
[16:01] according to Revelation 10 verse 7 Amos
[16:03] 3 verse 7 and other scriptures and then
[16:05] I saw that same Jesus Christ who
[16:07] revealed the word of God to me manifest
[16:09] himself in my life just as he did in the
[16:12] Bible days just as I could read in the
[16:14] scripture proving that Jesus Christ is
[16:16] the same yesterday today and forever
[16:18] thank you for your time friends and hope
[16:20] this short podcast was a blessing to you
[16:22] and may God anoint you to defend this
[16:25] message God bless you
[16:34] bring the good tidings the good news
[16:36] that Jesus raised
[16:39] him today
