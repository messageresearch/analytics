TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to prove hopefully by God's grace once and for all that the Lord Jesus Christ revealed the revelation of the third seal to God's Prophet brother William Branham and brother bran did not plagiarize the third seal from Charles Tay's Russell Clarence Larkin nor Uriah Smith so the outline for the video will be first we'll look at the third seal and compare brother brahm's Revelation to Charles Russell Clarence Larkin and Uriah Smith and then second we'll look at some of the YouTube comments and also a dream the third seal let's begin with the accusation against God's Prophet brother William Branham earlier this year in April one of brotherbraham's accusers on his YouTube channel said quote why did William Branham take the words of Charles Russell and Proclaim them as God's message end quote and of course this is a false accusation against God's true Prophet brother Branham this accuser of brother Branham made a one minute and 29 second video about the third seal but know how brother Ram's accuser took so little time to explain the third seal making a one minute and 29 second video and contrast that with brother branham's sermon of two hours and nearly 11 minutes on the topic of the third seal and also two pages that Charles Taze Russell wrote about the third seal as I study the topic of the third seal I found that brother Braham did agree with Charles Tay's Russell on three statements or three details about the third seal yet brother Branham disagreed with seven other details about the third seal proving brother Ram did not plagiarize Charles Tays Russell and friends just like the example I gave on the second seal video if I was writing about the American Revolution from the 18th century and Aid of my details about the American Revolution were different from any other source such as the Encyclopedia Britannica I would not be guilty of plagiarism and so it is with God's Prophet brother Branham these seven differences brother Branham disagreed with Russell on are significant differences that cannot be ignored and prove once and for all that brother Brown did not plagiarize Charles Taze Russell Clarence Larkin nor Uriah Smith let's begin by looking at the screenshot of the accusation from the video of one of brotherbraham's accusers here's a screenshot of a quote from Brother Branham that the accuser used and notice it's three words same writer now notice this accuser used three words out of brotherbraham's two-hour and nearly 11-minute sermon so I can't say for sure but it seems like brother Ram's accuser is trying to purposely slander brother Branham because he used so little of brother Ram's teaching on the third seal now here's a screenshot of the quote from Charles Tays Russell that brother Ram's accuser used while it's true both men said the same writer and agreed on two other details remember they disagreed on eight other details about the third seal and I'll show how little of Russell's work the accuser actually used so here's a screenshot of the two pages Charles says Russell wrote about the third seal highlighted in blue is the section on the third seal notice highlighted in yellow are the quotes they cited on their video notice what a small portion of information about the third seal the accuser actually used so they used about three sentences or less and ignored the rest of Russell's details about the third seal notice again how little research these so-called researchers actually used and friends let me just say the elect of God cannot be deceived by such weak and shoddy research as this accuser used all I can say is thank you Lord Jesus that the elect cannot be deceived now let's look at the rest of Russell's teaching on the third seal why did the accuser brother Branham omit the rest of Russell's work was it because he wanted to purposely slander God's Prophet brother Branham that seems a likely answer but again I don't know for sure only God knows his heart let's examine 10 details about the third seal and we'll see that brother Branham differed with Russell on 7 out of the ten details again proving brother Bram did not plagiarize Charles Tays Russell beginning with the timing Charles Russell said the timing of the third seal was synchronous to Revelation 2 verses 12-17 which was his pergamos church age or pergamian church age which was from 325 to 1160. and note that Russell said Arius was the messenger to his pergamian church age and of course this differs from brother Brandon brother Branham said the third seal took place during the thyatiran Sardis and Philadelphia Church ages and The Messengers were Columba Martin Luther and John Wesley and for the timing brother Ram said quote he has started writing him in the time of the Dark Ages end quote so here's a visual and you can see how Russell's third seal lasted from 539 to 1160 A.D Russell said it's synchronous to Revelation 2 verses 12-17 so it lasted from 539 to 1160 A.D through the details brother Ram gives it seems his third seal lasted from 1095 the beginning of the Dark Ages to 1906 the beginning of the prophetic age of the eagle anointing the last Church age the laosian church age and the conclusion is brother Ram did not plagiarize Charles Tay's Russell brother Ram's third seal started almost 500 years after Russell's and brother random's third seal ended about 800 years after Charles Tay's Russell's second the black horse Russell said the black horse was quote ugly Creeds and Bulls of popes and councils end quote and there on your screen you can see the screenshot of Russell's quote on the ugly Creeds that represented the black horse this is not what brother Ram taught brother random said the black horse was the Dark Ages he said quote that's what the Dark Horse represented the dark ages for it was a time of midnight to the True Believers that was left end quote thank you the third detail brother Ram did agree with Charles Tay's Russell it was the detail of the writer Russell said the writer was the Antichrist and brother Ram said it was the same writer but again notice that Russell had a 50 chance to get this right in other words the writer was either Jesus or Satan and so with that 50 percent probability Russell got it right on the fourth out of 10 details we have the third difference between brother Branham and Russell Russell said the balances in the hand of the writer were a symbol of scarcity and here's a screenshot of that quote he had a pair of balances in his hand balance joined with symbols of denoting the sale of corn and fruits by weight becomes the symbol of scarcity bred by weight being a curse in the VPS 2626 and in Ezekiel 4 verses 16 and 17 end quote and then he continued quote during this period the common people could have in their own tongue only a few words or verses of the scriptures and for these they were obliged to pay large sums to the clergy who alone had the ability to translate from the dead languages or even to read it all as the services were enlightened the people were starved spiritually end quote regarding the balances brother Branham taught differently than Russell he said quote his balances or his skills in his hand what it means that he was charging his subjects for the kind of the hope of life that he was sending out to them by making he started in that very time of making them pay for prayer charging for prayer they still do it novenas because what was he doing capturing the wealth of the world end quote on the 5th out of 10 details brother Branham and Russell agreed regarding the voice in the midst both Russell and brother Branham said it had to be Jesus so this is their second out of three details that they agreed upon out of the 10 details and of course Russell again had a 50 chance to get this right what other voice One Voice could be in the midst of the Throne of God it had to be the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ on the sixth detail regarding the wheat it's the fourth difference between brother Branham and Russell Russell said the wheat was quote the true Children of the kingdom and you can see it on the screen here brother Ram did not say this brother Branham said the wheat was quote making them pay for prayer charging for prayer they still do it novenas because what was he doing capturing the wealth of the world end quote and also brother Adam said it was paying for prayers to get out of purgatory from the third seal on the seventh detail regarding the oil brother Branham and Russell agreed for the most part so this is their third and final agreement out of the 10 details on the third seal Russell said the oil was the Holy Spirit of full submission to the will of God brother Branham basically agreed he said quote now oil typifies Spirit end quote and of course brother Brown was referring to the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the disciples received on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 verse 4. on the eighth detail regarding wine it's the fifth difference between brother Branham and Russell Russell said quote wine is a symbol of Doctrine true or false and its accompanying Joys end quote so brother Brandon agreed it was Joy but never limited the oil to just Doctrine brother Randall said it was stimulation of revelation of any promised word of God such as with the prophecy of Joel 2 28 which was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost which Russell never wrote about regarding the third seal brother Ram said quote when the truth of a promised word has been truly revealed to his Saint that's filled with oil they all get stimulated wine is a stimulation Glory I feel it right now stimulated with joy shouts and when it does it has the same effect upon them that that wine has upon a natural man because when the Revelation has been given of a truth of God and the True Believer filled with oil and the Revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that it makes him behave his self unnormally end quote on the ninth detail out of ten regarding the Beast which was the man it's the sixth difference between Branham and Russell Russell said this man Beast was quote infinite love end quote well the Rams had this third Beast was the wisdom of man quote nor the man-like Beast of wisdom representing the reformers Luther and Wesley and so forth it wasn't revealed end quote notice brother Brown said this Beast related to the Reformation period but Russell's third seal ended well before the Reformation in 1160 A.D over 400 years prior to the Reformation so of course these are not the same this is not plagiarism on the 10th and final detail regarding the emphasis it's the seventh difference between Branham and Russell Russell's emphasis was on the complete Triumph of Satan Russell said this was the age of quote the Apparently complete Triumph of the powers of darkness and the apparent inaction of infinite love in permitting it end quote this is shocking to see Russell say this completely wrong Satan never has and never will completely triumph over God's love and God will never permit his holy spirit to be completely triumphed over so we can see this was a huge mistake on the part of Russell and again it's a sad thing that brother Ryan's accusers never mentioned this teaching from Charles Tays Russell brother Ram never called the third seal a complete Triumph of Satan brother Ram did say it was the darkest age the program said Jesus would protect the elect by stimulation of Revelation which was the wine and oil which is the Holy Ghost baptism despite the Dark Ages and this anointing saved the world brother Ram literally said the anointing of the man saved the world so the saints were not triumphed over and Friends how could God permit complete triumph over himself over his own beast and notice brother Brandon said the third seal was during the time of the Reformation Russell did not say that Russell's third seal ended 400 years before the Reformation and in Russell's teaching he said the Reformation was for the Philadelphian age only and Russell said Luther was the messenger to Philadelphia but the RAM said Luther was the messenger to Sardis and Wesley was the messenger to Philadelphia as a final summary brother Ram did not plagiarize I found at least seven differences on the third seal itself meaning there are 19 total differences so far on the first three seals because there were six differences a piece on the first and second seal and now there are seven differences on the third seal now let's look at brother Branham and Clarence Larkin here's a screenshot of Larkin's third seal now the timing and the identity of the writer for Clarence Larkin the timing was during the Great Tribulation period or Daniel's 70th week which was the same as the first and second seals and he said the third seal was during a time of War during the Great Tribulation period and again the writer is the same person it's the person of the Antichrist during the Great Tribulation period or Daniel's 70th week Larkin calls him the conserver of food now brother bran never said this brother never said the third horse rider was the conserver of food brother Branham called him the Antichrist spirit in the pope and of course the Roman Catholic Church during the Dark Ages so for the timing here's a screenshot of the difference between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin so brother Brandon's third seal started over a thousand years before Larkins because Larkin's third seal hasn't even happened yet and so this proves there's no plagiarism from Brother Branham and Clarence Larkin regarding the oil and wine Larkin said it was the literal oil and wine that would be crops needed for medicinal purposes during the war in the Great Tribulation period of course brother Graham never taught this brother Graham said the oil was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the wine was stimulation by Revelation so it's clear the conclusion is brother Ram did not plagiarize Clarence Larkin now let's compare brother Bynum and Uriah Smith your eyes missed timing of the third seal seems to be from the end of Constantine's Reign to about 5 38. which he called the establishment of the papacy so a general timeline would be from about 337 to 538 A.D and here's a screenshot you can see the difference between brother branham's third seal and Uriah Smith's third seal notice brother Ram's third seal started nearly 700 years after Uriah Smith and brother branham's third seal ended nearly 1500 years after Uriah Smith's third seal ended regarding the writer Uriah Smith said the writer seems to be quote the false system end quote leading to the establishment of the papacy end quote so it seems Rai Smith did agree with brother Branham on the identity of the writer the writer is basically the Antichrist Spirit working through the pope and all the false preachers and the false religious system of the Antichrist regarding the balances Uriah Smith said the balances were religion and civil powers brother Branham never said the balances were religion and civil Powers he said the balances represented the Roman Catholic Church capturing the wealth of the world during the Dark Ages through novenas or indulgences regarding the wheat and barley Uriah Smith said the spirit of the age would be worldly goods and Love of Money again brother Graham never said we in barley represented worldly goods and love of money he said they represented the natural staff of Life which symbolized the Roman Catholic Church capturing the wealth of the world through indulgences regarding the oil and wine urai Smith said they were quote Graces of the spirit faith and love end quote brother Branham of course said the oil was the spirit and wine was stimulation of Revelation so while both men recognized they dealt with the Holy Spirit brother random differentiated them and said the oil was the third work of Grace the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the wine was the stimulation or Joy or gladness or boldness of the Holy Ghost which your eye Smith did not say so again the conclusion is that brother Bram did not plagiarize your eyes Smith on the third seal now let's look at comments and a dream friends after seeing such vast differences between the first three seals I thought I would go and check brother Graham's accusers video and see what kind of comments they got on the third seal video and I didn't find many comments but the one said thank you dear with five thankful hand emojis and then brother Ram's accuser said you're most welcome now friends I'm not mocking brother Ram's accusers but how can the viewers be thankful for such a short video that ignored so much information of Charles Tay's Russell how can they be serious and be thankful for some of the weakest research possible regarding the seals how can they be thankful for three sentences of Russell's work out of the nearly two pages of his writing on the third seal how can they be thankful for one or two seconds of brotherbraham's information and teaching on the third seal and ignoring the other two hours and 11 minutes this seems to point to the truth that brother Graham's accuser and his viewers are either ignorant or extremely disingenuous because they ignore so much teaching on the third seal and of course all the other seals while I was looking at these comments the scriptures came to me Proverbs 15 28 the heart of the righteous studieth to answer but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things friends how can brothers accusers be righteous when their studying is so extremely weak and incomplete out of two pages they cite less than three sentences and that's just on the third seal video they did even less citations and less research on the other seal videos and then Proverbs 18 verse 13 says he that answereth a matter before he heareth it is a Folly and shame unto him how can brother Ram's accusers and their followers answer the matter on the third seal second seal first seal or any of the other seals without recognizing how much teaching there was on each seal it's most likely true brother randoms accusers and other followers have not fully read all of Charles Tay's Russell's work nor Clarence Larkins Nori rice Miss so again all these observations point to the fact that's very unlikely brother M's accusers and their followers are righteous because they truly do not study to give an honest answer and they're answering a matter declaring brother Branham a plagiarists and all kinds of other Wicked names before they actually even read and acknowledge all the information on each seal next I want to talk about a dream one of my daughters had now this daughter claims to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and on the night of November 18th this daughter mine dreamed about brother Ram's accusers and in the dream they came into our house and they started criticizing every little detail in our house when we would respond and try to give them answers they acted like they didn't even hear us they just ignored us my daughter kept telling them to stop criticizing us yet they wouldn't stop and then brother Ram's accuser started mocking us and we could not stop their criticisms and so my daughter was very sad after this dream of course you could imagine why it was almost like a nightmare to see how unfairly brother Graham's accusers were treating us and of course it was extremely sad to see how they would not listen to any of our convictions they only came into our house to criticize they said nothing positive and they ignored all of our facts so I just thought I would share that dream and those comments to help us further understand the spirit that these accusers are likely under I do not believe they can be Anointed with an honest Spirit especially after seeing how much information on each CL so far they have failed to present they have omitted from their videos how can an honest person an honest researcher omit all these differences and all the details of each of the first three seals and friends let's recall there were seven differences between Russell and brother Branham on the third seal and there were six differences between Russell and brother Branham on the second seal and the first seal how could brother random's accusers ignore these 19 differences between the first three seals so far did they not read Russell's work did they not listen to brother random sermons on the first three seals of course I don't know the answer to these questions all I can do is prove all things and rightly divide the word of Truth and hope that the Holy Spirit Will convict these men of their disingenuous research their disingenuous videos in closing friends I hope this video on the third seal has been a blessing of course I want to end this video again with another prayer for brother Brown's accusers in hopes that someday they will repent of their false accusations against God's true Prophet brother Branham you know Satan is really moving right now as a critical spirit criticizing the message in the messenger and the Believers following the message of the hour but thankfully the Believers who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost will not be deterred because they have the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost guides us into all truth just as this video showed the Holy Ghost guided us into the full truth on the third seal so here's a prayer for brothers accusers dear heavenly father I come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and again Lord for the third time I ask God that you would allow these accusers of brother random to repent of their sins and their false accusations and honestly look at each of the seals and with an honest heart see the truth that God's Prophet did not plagiarize these other preachers Lord your Bible says With God all things are possible so Lord we ask that if it be possible if these men would be willing to repent Lord they could be drawn to repentance Lord God if they've been dishonest and if they've lied Lord for only you know the situation only only you know the reality of their spiritual conditions and Lord you told us to pray for our enemies and of course Lord these men are making brother Brandon I'm out to be a false prophet and that would make them our enemies because we believe brother Brown was God's true Prophet so Lord we praise you taught us to we pray for those who are against us who speak against us and against God's Prophet who speak against the true revelation of the word of God the Lord you promise to save all those that could be saved the heavenly father would not lose one of his sheep so Lord I pray God if these men are sheep they would repent of their sins and come to you and follow the true revelation of the word of God in Jesus Christ's name I ask this amen do you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
