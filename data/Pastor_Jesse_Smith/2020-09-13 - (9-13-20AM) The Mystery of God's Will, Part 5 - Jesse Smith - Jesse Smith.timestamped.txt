[35:33] god
[35:40] so i want to take a few minutes here and
[35:42] uh just share a few
[35:44] things by god's grace to kind of i like
[35:46] to update everybody on
[35:47] the ministries and everything um
[35:52] you can switch over to my phone lydia
[35:53] just for a minute here
[35:56] i'm just re uh rejoicing after
[35:58] yesterday's debate we had a really nice
[36:00] it was just more like a discussion
[36:01] rather than a debate
[36:03] um i want to show you
[36:07] i kind of flagged a few things so we
[36:08] just passed over a million views on the
[36:10] on the uh the youtube channel now we're
[36:12] up to about a million three thousand
[36:14] so after seven years brother bang we hit
[36:16] a million
[36:18] nothing's gone viral yet but at least we
[36:20] hit a million
[36:22] so let's thank the lord for that
[36:26] uh that just encourages me you know
[36:28] every now and then we'll hit one of
[36:29] those milestones and
[36:31] uh we're doing our part to get the word
[36:32] out i want to uh
[36:34] share this uh i sent brother joseph
[36:36] branham a uh
[36:39] a reply last month
[36:42] okay and then a week later he put this
[36:44] out you know he sends a weekly email to
[36:46] all of his
[36:47] followers uh and he says when now this
[36:49] is exactly what i wrote he said when a
[36:51] man preaches says you don't have to
[36:52] believe every word on the tapes
[36:55] the prophet made mistakes which i told
[36:58] him that
[36:59] he said so himself which brother branham
[37:01] did say he said he made mistakes
[37:03] and we can show them to you and i can i
[37:06] did all that to him
[37:08] there is a difference when it was god
[37:09] speaking through him and when his own
[37:11] thought or ideas
[37:12] and then they quote and then he uses a
[37:15] quote brother i'm talking about jesus
[37:16] christ
[37:17] how if anybody changes anything about
[37:18] jesus christ it's a seed of discrepancy
[37:21] so that quote doesn't even relate to
[37:23] brother branham
[37:25] that qu he is making brother branham
[37:27] jesus christ
[37:30] and i can share this website if you want
[37:33] so i just want to see what we're up
[37:34] against you know
[37:37] and i haven't heard back maybe i will i
[37:38] hope i hear back i send my email right
[37:41] away
[37:41] actually i put a comment at the bottom
[37:42] of this page and i'll show that to you
[37:45] i just want to tell you you know the
[37:47] same in every detail then some
[37:49] man is going to tell you there are
[37:52] mistakes and what he said
[37:53] there's i've told you this there's
[37:55] nothing wrong jesus ever said
[37:58] brother branham is the one who made
[37:59] mistakes because all men and women make
[38:03] you mistakes then some man is going to
[38:05] tell you their mistakes and what he said
[38:07] see even brother brandon like that's not
[38:10] a capital h
[38:11] that's a lowercase h but the power
[38:14] anointing of the holy spirit through him
[38:16] which is what we believe it takes
[38:19] anointed men of god to rightly divide
[38:21] the word of god
[38:22] he will tell you what is and isn't the
[38:24] word not to me he isn't so here is
[38:26] look every time i bring this to the
[38:28] family of brahms they always double down
[38:30] on it
[38:31] he's he's every word is thus say the
[38:32] lord no man is going to tell me what to
[38:34] do
[38:35] so i've tried brother baby i've tried
[38:39] the angel see the angel lord told his
[38:41] prophet get the people to believe you
[38:42] now we do but not every word and then he
[38:46] uses this
[38:47] which brother ram did say this in the
[38:50] name of jesus christ don't add one thing
[38:52] but he's not talking he didn't say every
[38:54] word on the tape he was referring to the
[38:56] revelations that god gave him
[38:58] and i showed you that whenever we
[39:00] preached on that remember to prove all
[39:01] things series remember that
[39:03] i don't know if the blinds were here at
[39:04] that point but i showed it to you
[39:06] brother brown was
[39:06] he was copying moses moses said if you
[39:08] change one thing
[39:10] add one thing you're cursed he said and
[39:13] brother man says so
[39:14] say hi in the name of jesus christ don't
[39:15] add one thing to the tapes
[39:17] he's not talking about everything on the
[39:18] tape he's talking about the revelations
[39:19] god gave him on the tapes
[39:22] everybody everybody knows that they
[39:24] should at least
[39:26] you just do exactly what the lord your
[39:27] god is see the brother
[39:29] says thus saith the lord in the name of
[39:30] jesus christ do what the lord god has
[39:32] commanded you to do
[39:35] don't add to it the word
[39:38] uh when god speaks the word he doesn't
[39:40] need any man or woman no one else to
[39:42] to say what that means so that's what
[39:44] joseph's saying see
[39:45] every word on the tape is thus say lord
[39:47] how can a preacher
[39:49] uh interpret that the way we do
[39:53] he said but they don't want uh
[39:57] he said but they don't want to lean on
[39:58] what the word says
[40:00] see they're making brother brahm the
[40:01] word they are literally making william
[40:03] branham the word of god
[40:05] he preached the word but he wasn't the
[40:07] word
[40:08] right now if you say you want to get
[40:10] real detailed
[40:12] did he have the word living inside him
[40:13] yeah was he a manifestation of the word
[40:16] yeah so are you though
[40:19] so i agree with that but they're making
[40:21] brother brandon all the word they're
[40:22] making them equal with jesus christ
[40:24] because they just use the quote the
[40:26] wrong way
[40:28] they want to lean upon what some
[40:29] minister says instead of what god
[40:31] said that's not true we are leaning
[40:34] on well you're leaning on what i say but
[40:36] it's because it's in the word of god
[40:38] right and no matter what church you went
[40:39] to that's what you would do
[40:41] you would as long as the minister says
[40:43] it's in the word that's what you lean
[40:44] upon right
[40:47] prophet told us the scriptures repeat i
[40:48] think he might have been done
[40:52] dealing with me i think i think he was
[40:54] dealing with me i don't know else who he
[40:56] could be dealing with to me
[40:58] uh okay and so here
[41:01] i just wrote a little reply at the
[41:02] bottom i said
[41:05] is that it oh yeah i just said god bless
[41:07] you i said i'm a pastor
[41:09] and joseph and i are in email contact i
[41:11] don't believe every word on the table
[41:12] thus says lord can you please ask joseph
[41:13] if the third person the trinity burns in
[41:15] his heart
[41:17] i said i write and i church i wrote this
[41:18] in godly love we kind of i laugh now but
[41:21] i really i'm humble with these guys and
[41:24] respect hoping joseph will see not every
[41:27] word on the tape is divine
[41:28] brother branham said and i listened to
[41:29] it this week you can listen to it if you
[41:31] want
[41:31] brother brandon said we love him that
[41:33] great third person of the trinity
[41:35] who burns through our hearts
[41:39] i said i hope to hear from you soon
[41:41] thank you
[41:43] [Music]
[41:45] still haven't heard anything that was
[41:47] last week that was two weeks ago
[41:49] see church god's word is right
[41:52] god will share his glory with nobody
[41:56] he won't share his glory with william
[41:58] branham with paul
[41:59] jesus christ gets all the glory so see
[42:03] and i'm so
[42:03] i'm battling on that side that's a it's
[42:05] not a hard battle church you know just
[42:07] i'm trying to get these people to repent
[42:09] and then yesterday i had three and a
[42:10] half hours
[42:11] on the debate that was really wonderful
[42:13] it was very well structured everything
[42:15] was really good
[42:16] um do i have any emails about that i
[42:18] don't know if i have any emails about
[42:19] that
[42:20] dang i still gotta get to yours buddy
[42:22] that was from a long time ago so
[42:24] i'll get to that but i've been
[42:25] overwhelmed
[42:27] yeah thank you sir i i'm gonna get to
[42:29] that eventually
[42:31] um okay
[42:35] so i think that was it um anything else
[42:39] okay you can take it off here lady i
[42:41] think that was all in the show
[42:43] um
[42:47] you know simon had listened to the first
[42:48] debate i emailed him the first part of
[42:50] it and he said he was he was amazed he
[42:52] said wow brother jesse said
[42:53] what a great job the lord did and he
[42:56] said maybe you should preach that to
[42:57] your church
[42:58] and play it to you and i might play
[43:00] portions of it maybe tonight or later
[43:01] but i wasn't planning on that
[43:03] if you get a chance to listen to that it
[43:04] was really well structured there was
[43:06] five questions i got to ask him five
[43:08] questions
[43:08] he would respond for five minutes and
[43:10] then i got three minute rebuttal and
[43:12] then they got three minutes after me
[43:13] so the person who was getting the the
[43:15] question got the last word on it
[43:17] which was okay because i know god gets
[43:19] the last word on everything
[43:21] right so i got i got the last word on
[43:24] his five questions
[43:25] but then he got the last word on my five
[43:27] questions and then we closed at the end
[43:28] with 10 minutes just to
[43:29] give our f we introduced ourselves for
[43:31] 10 minutes our introduction
[43:33] and then we closed with 10 minutes and i
[43:34] was just preaching at the end and i said
[43:36] i said i'm casting the net and you're
[43:38] not saying get the baptism the holy
[43:39] ghost you get
[43:40] get water baptist baptized in jesus
[43:42] christ's name
[43:44] as it went on i got more bold you know
[43:46] it was it was good but i'll tell you
[43:47] that
[43:48] i was shaking like a leaf beforehand so
[43:50] thanks for your prayers ever prayed for
[43:51] me
[43:52] i was right here laying on my face but
[43:53] they meant i'm like how can i do this
[43:55] you know
[43:57] but god was gracious to me because i
[43:59] have nothing i just want to
[44:00] like paul said i want to be set for the
[44:02] defense of the gospel
[44:04] i want to defend this message praise god
[44:06] and that doesn't mean everywhere on the
[44:07] tape the word of god on the tape
[44:09] and everybody knows that by now by god's
[44:11] grace um so
[44:13] let's get to the word of god i just want
[44:15] to look a few uh
[44:16] minutes here give me about 30 minutes to
[44:18] preach i've already gone 10 so give me
[44:19] 30 minutes
[44:21] and then i'll try to close we'll do some
[44:22] songs and then we'll give our
[44:24] testimonies
[44:25] praise the lord
[44:28] so uh wednesday let me just quickly
[44:31] review
[44:31] we looked at uh relationships uh you
[44:35] don't
[44:35] have to guess on relationships if you're
[44:37] in the perfect will of god or not
[44:39] uh the bible says you you you take it
[44:41] before the lord right
[44:43] you present your body the first thing is
[44:45] keep your body pure right present your
[44:46] body living sacrifice
[44:48] sacrifice everything that will keep your
[44:50] body from being pleasing to god
[44:52] and then get a transformed mind and then
[44:55] make your choice as far as relationships
[44:57] we looked at that i appreciate the nice
[44:58] feedback we got from that on wednesday a
[45:00] couple people told me they really
[45:01] enjoyed that message
[45:03] i got emails right afterwards about it
[45:04] people were listening around the world
[45:06] um just a couple with questions but
[45:09] that's right
[45:10] now the thing i want to share i think my
[45:12] wife mentioned it the thing i want to
[45:13] share again is that in the message
[45:14] we the brothers have to be extremely
[45:16] careful how they handle their
[45:18] power and authority and that's why many
[45:21] message churches have failed because men
[45:22] are not born again and they take all the
[45:25] authority over women and they abuse
[45:26] their wives
[45:27] and they abuse their children and
[45:30] pastors will do it
[45:31] and that's nothing but the spirit of
[45:33] satan that's the antichrist spirit
[45:36] you got to be careful power only shows
[45:38] what kind of character you got
[45:40] power reveals what's in your heart and
[45:43] so that's one thing
[45:44] and i use that with divorce a woman can
[45:47] leave her husband just
[45:48] if she's getting abused she can she
[45:50] doesn't have to stay there and be abused
[45:52] uh as long as it's with the lord and
[45:55] everything like that i don't see how the
[45:56] lord would ever lead a woman into being
[45:58] abused
[45:59] i don't see how that's right uh
[46:03] so people make all these laws in the
[46:05] message and not
[46:06] many churches but some churches you know
[46:08] in other words we just want to say that
[46:10] that god is guiding us into all truth
[46:13] praise god
[46:14] and if you have a question about
[46:15] marriage please let us know but we've
[46:17] got to really make sure as brothers as
[46:18] leaders
[46:19] that we don't abuse the power god has
[46:21] given to us praise the lord brothers
[46:23] that's all hear all the brothers say
[46:24] amen ready amen praise god
[46:26] we're the ones with the authority
[46:28] leadership and we have to be very
[46:30] uh humble by god's grace and then we
[46:33] looked at vocations whatever god's
[46:34] called you to do to work do it with all
[46:36] your heart
[46:37] we saw there's nothing more important
[46:39] than taking care of your children um
[46:42] and then uh work whatever god's called
[46:44] you do it with all your heart praise god
[46:46] because and then don't worry about being
[46:48] rich because godliness with contentment
[46:49] is great gain
[46:50] amen praise god and every time i told
[46:53] this before maybe i haven't lately but
[46:55] every time i've needed a job or
[46:56] something i just cried out to god and
[46:57] god answered the first time was after i
[46:59] graduated from college
[47:01] we found out my wife was pregnant we
[47:02] already married of course and found out
[47:04] my wife was pregnant
[47:05] and i didn't have a job i was just like
[47:07] fresh off a college degree i'd even go
[47:09] to the ceremony you know i was like i'd
[47:11] rather serve jesus you know
[47:13] no i wish i would have went i had a
[47:15] little picture to remember it
[47:17] but
[47:22] then the bills start coming in and my
[47:23] wife's working at a coffee shop
[47:25] pregnant and i'm not doing nothing but
[47:27] amen that really shook me
[47:29] i got on my knees and i said god i'd rat
[47:31] i remember i was weeping crying by my
[47:32] bed while my wife's at work
[47:35] i should have planned ahead you know got
[47:36] a part-time job or something anyways
[47:39] i cried out and said jesus i'd rather
[47:41] die than not provide for my wife and
[47:43] this baby to come little lydia
[47:45] and the next day i called and i begged
[47:47] my uh uh
[47:48] my former boss at the grocery store i
[47:50] begged him can i have a job he's like i
[47:52] can't give you full time he said i can
[47:53] give you 15 hours a week i said i'll
[47:55] take it
[47:56] and so i rejoiced i had a job uh two
[47:59] days later i got a call
[48:01] from gojo said they'll give me full time
[48:03] and i said glory
[48:05] hallelujah and uh so each time
[48:08] and then i was like go joe i got the
[48:09] call for the teaching job a few months
[48:11] into that
[48:12] and uh each and so i haven't had to get
[48:14] a different job since then
[48:16] uh so the lord has provided amen and
[48:18] each time and i just had another woman
[48:20] uh tech or email me this week she said i
[48:22] was there at the interview
[48:24] and at the interview numerous people on
[48:26] the staff were christians they said we
[48:27] knew you were a christian right when you
[48:28] walked in the door so
[48:29] it's nice after 17 years people still
[48:31] remember your spirit right how many know
[48:33] your testimonies still speaking praise
[48:35] god
[48:35] amen even after 20 15 years people will
[48:38] still remember the love of god in your
[48:40] life you have to say one thing about i
[48:41] didn't say one word about jesus at that
[48:43] interview
[48:44] but they knew i love jesus somehow
[48:46] praise god
[48:47] so see your life speaks way louder than
[48:49] anything you say praise god it's brother
[48:51] ram taught us
[48:52] now we looked at location where should
[48:54] you live uh
[48:55] this is most determined by your job of
[48:57] course because you have to have an
[48:58] income and you have to provide
[49:00] um but god determined your birth
[49:04] and uh so you would learn to seek him so
[49:06] god put you in a place
[49:08] on the earth wendy in hong kong most of
[49:10] us in the united states right
[49:12] bang's parents and laos is that right
[49:14] bank yeah sometimes i get those
[49:15] countries mixed up
[49:17] um uh where they were born
[49:20] oh van you were born in laos right okay
[49:22] praise god do you remember the plane
[49:24] right over here brother
[49:25] okay i'm just curious i didn't know how
[49:27] old you were
[49:29] but see god knew vang would be born
[49:31] there praise god
[49:32] and god made it a way to bring him over
[49:34] here praise god
[49:35] we read this scripture and said that god
[49:38] determined the bound of your habitation
[49:40] that you should seek the lord
[49:42] so god knew vang would want to believe
[49:44] all the truth so god
[49:46] made a way to send him all the way
[49:48] across the ocean praise god
[49:50] to america where he could hear the
[49:51] message of the hour amen praise god same
[49:53] thing with sister when he praise god
[49:55] see because god the bible said they
[49:57] would feel after him so it's after
[49:59] remember god first reaches out to every
[50:01] person
[50:02] he puts the law on their hearts and
[50:04] every person has a thirst for god
[50:06] but then god moves you in places in your
[50:08] life physically
[50:09] so you have a chance to hear the word of
[50:11] god amen that you might
[50:13] feel after him oh lord i feel you uh
[50:16] draw in my heart i want to draw closer
[50:17] to you praise god
[50:19] because the bible says draw nearer to
[50:20] god and he'll draw nigh to you praise
[50:22] god
[50:23] now of course we know he's the first
[50:24] mover we know he first but the bible
[50:26] does tell us then we must respond praise
[50:29] god
[50:29] and then find him though he be not far
[50:32] from every one of us
[50:33] amen so see god determines church your
[50:36] starting location
[50:37] you must trust him uh he'll guide all
[50:40] the places you'll
[50:41] inhabit you may never leave your region
[50:43] of birth
[50:44] sometimes i wish i could leave ohio to a
[50:46] warmer place
[50:49] i see my friends you know we saw our
[50:50] friends go down to florida
[50:52] they visited us yesterday i thought oh
[50:54] you lucky you lucky ducks you know
[50:58] now sometimes i'll be like that but you
[51:00] know uh
[51:01] everybody has a order god's gonna use
[51:04] there may be surprises in your life
[51:06] right
[51:07] abraham moved at least 15 times and i
[51:09] don't have i forgot to pull it up it's a
[51:11] pdf
[51:11] if you want it it'll i can share with
[51:13] you after service but it goes through
[51:15] abraham's journeys
[51:16] 15 different physical locations i love
[51:20] i love the first one praise god because
[51:22] the bible said in ezra he was worshiping
[51:24] idols remember matthew mclard
[51:26] showed us that scripture i forgot all
[51:27] about that one he was an idol worshiper
[51:30] but god said separate yourself and come
[51:32] and follow me and come to a land that i
[51:34] will show you praise god
[51:36] so here he was worshiping idols brother
[51:37] bang where's my eyes but yet then he
[51:39] could still hear the voice of the true
[51:41] god
[51:41] amen that's like us praise god we were
[51:44] steeped in idolatry
[51:45] but somehow god's voice still got
[51:48] through to us amen glory
[51:50] and so he moved 15 times and sometimes
[51:53] it was against the will of god
[51:55] right when it went down to egypt it was
[51:57] out of the perfect will of god sometimes
[51:59] church we will make mistakes
[52:01] and will go places out physically
[52:04] outside the will of god
[52:05] but if you love god if you're a child of
[52:07] abraham god will bring you right back in
[52:10] the perfect will of god amen
[52:11] amen
[52:15] he might do pretty harsh things to do it
[52:17] but he's going to get you there praise
[52:18] god
[52:19] he's going to get us back to the perfect
[52:20] will of god if we're a child of god
[52:23] see he was still a friend of god despite
[52:25] all of his moving and despite all of the
[52:28] maybe the uncertainty he was going out
[52:30] looking for a place he didn't even know
[52:31] where he was going
[52:32] yet he was still the father of faith in
[52:35] church that that shows us
[52:36] no matter how hard your situations are
[52:39] even
[52:39] physically you can still be the friend
[52:42] of god
[52:43] you can church you can still talk to him
[52:45] as you're picking up your boxes praise
[52:47] god
[52:47] you can still talk to him as you run the
[52:49] u-haul and you can still rent him
[52:51] and talk to him throughout all the
[52:52] process and still give him glory
[52:54] you can be his friend and i know he'll
[52:57] be a friend to you
[52:58] praise god he's faithful amen if he was
[53:00] abraham's friend
[53:01] with every move he'll be your friend as
[53:04] well
[53:05] joseph was completely shocked his world
[53:08] church was turned upside down in the old
[53:10] testament
[53:11] sold out from amongst his brethren at
[53:14] 17 years old how many are so mature at
[53:16] 17 that you could handle a
[53:18] a move a slavery right a slavery at 17
[53:23] and god still blesses everything you do
[53:26] wow that's powerful you're just 17 and
[53:29] yet you can go
[53:31] just be totally shocked and be taken out
[53:32] of your element and go right into
[53:34] potiphar's house and
[53:35] everything you put your hand to is
[53:37] blessed praise god
[53:39] that's how we want to be though if god
[53:40] would allow something like that to
[53:42] happen right
[53:42] we want to be able to see because it's
[53:44] the same life right you seek god first
[53:46] you just take care of business
[53:47] it's the same life if i would move
[53:49] places or something would happen
[53:51] it's the same life we put god first
[53:53] jesus number one
[53:54] and business number two and everything
[53:57] else will work out for god's glory
[53:59] amen so his life really didn't change
[54:01] other than the physical surroundings
[54:03] because he was a he was a servant of god
[54:07] see it's god's purpose for his life was
[54:10] to save many lives
[54:11] and so god had to move him to save the
[54:13] life and and all god-directed moves will
[54:16] glorify god and put you in position
[54:20] now lot remember a lot is the great
[54:22] lesson he made the disastrous choice
[54:26] and i've warned a couple of families in
[54:28] this church that are no longer here but
[54:29] i've warned a couple of them and i said
[54:31] you're making decisions now i thought
[54:34] they were making decisions
[54:36] while they were going to our church that
[54:37] was like lot they were choosing
[54:40] uh to invest more in financial things
[54:42] and
[54:43] and business and they started missing
[54:45] more church
[54:46] and i told them i told the head of the
[54:49] home i said
[54:50] you're making a lot decision because lot
[54:53] said
[54:53] well i could either here or oh my
[54:56] there's financial gains and so
[54:58] brother ram said he forgot about the
[54:59] promised son
[55:01] right and the families especially men
[55:04] especially men unless they're led by
[55:05] their wife you know like ahab and
[55:07] jezebel
[55:08] especially men they have to put the word
[55:11] of god above
[55:12] everything praise god the bible said
[55:14] gather more as you see that day
[55:15] approaching i mean i've seen
[55:17] how many people have i seen now maybe 10
[55:18] maybe more that they start really good
[55:21] for god but then they cut short on their
[55:23] church attendance and worship of god
[55:25] and they go after the things of the
[55:26] world and it's immediately
[55:29] felt in their family life you can see
[55:31] the effects
[55:32] in their life let's not make a lot
[55:34] decision let's make an abraham decision
[55:36] praise god
[55:37] physically he chose well i've got
[55:39] greater i've got a greater opportunity
[55:41] here
[55:42] for a financial gain yeah well then
[55:44] what's going to happen when you die like
[55:45] what
[55:46] you forgot what god god was in this hour
[55:49] god is bringing forth a promised son
[55:51] praise god
[55:52] that's what god's doing in this hour
[55:54] that's the don't you want to be around
[55:55] that
[55:55] praise god but they would rather be
[55:58] around financial success
[56:00] than be around the coming of abraham's
[56:03] seed praise god
[56:04] the promised son they'd rather have
[56:06] financial blessings
[56:08] than just see god's promised word come
[56:10] to pass we get a lot of that today in
[56:12] the message
[56:14] it's mostly men that make that decision
[56:16] see put your
[56:17] uh you got to choose to put your family
[56:19] among godly people
[56:21] and influences even if it means less
[56:23] money and benefits
[56:25] right god that's a hard thing for
[56:28] americans to do
[56:29] but church i'm a witness you put god
[56:31] first god will he'll eventually he'll
[56:32] bless you in the latter end
[56:34] amen praise god see
[56:37] and a major factor of where you live
[56:40] is your home church you're supposed to
[56:43] frequently increase
[56:44] your gathering with christians it's
[56:47] god's will for your life
[56:48] so you have to choose a location that
[56:50] allows you to fulfill this command
[56:52] satan loves to scatter the sheep
[56:55] that's what that's his main thing if he
[56:57] can just scatter the sheep remember
[56:59] paul said he i cried for three years
[57:01] because wolves are going to come in
[57:03] and devour the kill and we chop up and
[57:06] eat up the lambs and devour and make the
[57:09] lambs run make the
[57:10] sheep spread that's his main desire we
[57:13] should see
[57:14] church as our as our ship as our
[57:16] sheepfold praise god
[57:17] this is where we gather at nighttime
[57:19] amen this is where we feed all
[57:21] throughout the week
[57:21] and then we come in here and we rest
[57:23] with a shepherd jesus amen amen
[57:26] that's right but satan loves to scatter
[57:29] the flock
[57:30] jesus even remember he was even weeping
[57:32] or not weeping but he was he had
[57:34] compassion he said
[57:35] they're like sheep scattered without a
[57:36] shepherd he said pray that god will send
[57:38] four shepherds into the fold amen
[57:41] amen that was that was his prayer church
[57:43] jesus christ prayed that
[57:45] so lord your location should allow you
[57:47] have a pastor and a church family
[57:49] you regularly serve and worship with
[57:53] that's usually
[57:54] as we said up to the the man uh all
[57:57] decisions the man
[57:58] we've said brother ma'am even said it
[58:00] the man's not smarter than the woman
[58:02] that's not why he gets to make the
[58:03] decision it's because it's god's order
[58:06] i'll be the first to say my wife is
[58:08] smarter than me
[58:10] and you all know that cause i'm not very
[58:12] smart i'm not the sharpest tack in the
[58:16] sharpest nail my wife was a
[58:18] valedictorian i'm
[58:19] thankful for that y'all that's why i was
[58:21] one reason i wanted to marry her
[58:23] she was everything i wasn't real smart
[58:26] but uh but god places the authority with
[58:30] the man so the man has to learn to seek
[58:32] god
[58:33] take it take uh advice and wisdom
[58:36] women can have the how many know women
[58:38] can have the gift of wisdom and
[58:39] knowledge
[58:40] i've seen a woman cast out a devil now
[58:42] she later on she just made some things
[58:44] she wore some things i wouldn't wear or
[58:46] wouldn't allow a woman to wear
[58:48] but i've seen a woman cast out devils
[58:49] all those gifts are available to women
[58:52] so man has to take that he has to take
[58:54] this word of wisdom that knowledge
[58:56] and then he has to go to god and prayer
[58:58] he has to build a family altar
[59:00] praise god amen like abraham he's got to
[59:02] build it one at a time one
[59:04] one stone at a time one revelation at a
[59:07] time praise god
[59:08] and he's got to meet god on the uh those
[59:11] sands of of fellowship and and by by the
[59:14] stones of sacrifice he's got to meet god
[59:17] and he must be led by the holy spirit
[59:19] not led by his wife but led by the holy
[59:21] spirit praise god
[59:22] amen
[59:29] now and i've told you this before i made
[59:32] one great mistake with this
[59:34] and it was with a sister a lady i'll
[59:37] just say it because she's not here
[59:38] anymore but i constantly pray for her we
[59:40] pray for often
[59:41] um she was fasting about taking a job
[59:46] in iraq or saudi arabia sorry
[59:51] uh and then she was fasting she came
[59:55] home and got a letter saying she'd been
[59:57] approved to teach english in saudi
[59:59] arabia
[1:00:00] well she came and told me about it and i
[1:00:01] thought well you're fasting
[1:00:05] yeah and i said as long as you live
[1:00:06] stream every service
[1:00:08] yeah go over there for a year and that'd
[1:00:10] be fine and it's always something she
[1:00:12] always wanted to do
[1:00:14] well she made it over there and we
[1:00:16] prayed and cried and before she left and
[1:00:19] she made it over there and she made it
[1:00:21] through the first maybe
[1:00:22] hour of the first service on a wednesday
[1:00:24] night and then the internet connection
[1:00:26] went down and she never listened to one
[1:00:28] more sermon
[1:00:29] the rest of time she was there so i i
[1:00:31] apologize i talked to her the next
[1:00:33] a couple months later after that i
[1:00:34] apologized to her i said i should not
[1:00:35] have
[1:00:36] approved of that now she met she might
[1:00:38] have went past my advice
[1:00:39] right and still done it but the fact was
[1:00:43] i
[1:00:43] i felt that was one area where i i did
[1:00:46] it wrong i made a mistake
[1:00:47] i should not have blessed that okay and
[1:00:50] then we know things happened
[1:00:51] in her life i'm not going to get in that
[1:00:52] i know um
[1:00:55] uh so that's one area where i would say
[1:00:57] i made a mistake on that one but it
[1:00:59] taught me a lesson
[1:01:00] in church we all make mistakes right uh
[1:01:03] the thing to do though
[1:01:04] is learn from it so you don't make the
[1:01:05] mistake again
[1:01:07] right how many want to learn from their
[1:01:08] mistakes i want to learn that the next
[1:01:11] time it doesn't happen
[1:01:14] and so that's one example where when you
[1:01:17] leave the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:01:19] says always stay under the anointing
[1:01:21] amen we get the anointing every
[1:01:23] wednesday night don't we sister
[1:01:24] naomi says beatrice we get the anointing
[1:01:26] every wednesday night too right
[1:01:28] i know you know if you're live streaming
[1:01:29] you do too right you know i'm just
[1:01:31] saying like romance said always stay
[1:01:32] where the anointing is being poured out
[1:01:34] praise god
[1:01:35] amen so see when you leave the word you
[1:01:38] know you don't get the anointing you
[1:01:40] don't get the refreshing
[1:01:41] you don't get the blessing praise god so
[1:01:43] you have to stay
[1:01:44] under that uh and when you don't
[1:01:48] you you fall away you backslide uh satan
[1:01:52] traps the people okay
[1:01:56] now it's interesting you might you pray
[1:01:58] for brother cam because he and i had to
[1:01:59] talk yesterday he said i can't tell you
[1:02:00] not
[1:02:00] jesse said but i'm praying about the
[1:02:02] next uh
[1:02:03] move of my life and i said oh
[1:02:07] like i can't wait to hear about this he
[1:02:09] said but i'm reading your chapter on
[1:02:11] because i gave him a copy of this
[1:02:12] chapter
[1:02:13] he said boy he said that's a hard thing
[1:02:16] i said that's right
[1:02:18] that's hard you got to build that altar
[1:02:19] praise god i'm just thankful i'm not in
[1:02:22] it right now right i mean who wants to
[1:02:23] be in that i mean
[1:02:24] most people don't like to be in that
[1:02:25] area right between a rock and a hard
[1:02:27] place where they called her
[1:02:28] uh valley decision that's what it is
[1:02:30] yeah most people don't like i don't like
[1:02:32] it either
[1:02:34] uh so let's pray for another camera at
[1:02:36] the end of the service as well
[1:02:37] i'm gonna do it on time oh my
[1:02:41] so uh and you know i've talked to wendy
[1:02:44] about maybe moving closer but she feels
[1:02:46] led to stay there and i said that's fine
[1:02:47] i appreciate that
[1:02:48] our hearts you know go out to her and
[1:02:51] it's going to have to be for a testimony
[1:02:53] god is going to use sister wendy for
[1:02:55] testimony i believe
[1:02:57] on the day of judgment for someone that
[1:02:58] won't even drive 10 minutes to church
[1:03:02] an hour two hours and she'll still stand
[1:03:06] there at three and a half hours church
[1:03:08] now who's gonna have a who's gonna have
[1:03:10] an excuse on the day of judgment
[1:03:12] not many people so
[1:03:18] it's it's powerful if the queen of sheba
[1:03:20] did it one time and she got mentioned by
[1:03:22] jesus
[1:03:22] what about you what about you sister she
[1:03:25] did it one time
[1:03:27] now that was a long journey was it like
[1:03:28] a month brother and says a month or two
[1:03:30] i looked it up one time i can't remember
[1:03:32] how so one month all across the desert
[1:03:34] you know bring all of her
[1:03:36] sister sister wendy's come year
[1:03:39] after year after year after year
[1:03:42] so you have to pray you have to pray and
[1:03:44] find what is god's will for your life
[1:03:47] he'll show your church remember we saw
[1:03:48] it on wednesday
[1:03:49] if you ask for wisdom he'll pour it out
[1:03:51] liberally praise god
[1:03:52] he won't give you a drip by any man
[1:03:54] right he won't give us like a
[1:03:56] what do they call those eye droppers
[1:03:57] what do they call that that's what they
[1:03:58] call he's not gonna give you a little
[1:04:00] eye drop of wisdom he's gonna like pour
[1:04:01] out the whole cup
[1:04:03] he's gonna pour out the whole cup you
[1:04:05] need any more
[1:04:06] amen praise god amen amen you asked for
[1:04:10] god wisdom if you really want to do
[1:04:11] what's right he's going to pour out
[1:04:13] blessings upon you praise god
[1:04:15] abundant blessings that's the word of
[1:04:17] god
[1:04:18] the thing is people just aren't willing
[1:04:19] to wait long enough they think it has to
[1:04:21] happen in their time
[1:04:22] and just like balaam if they really want
[1:04:24] to go god knows they really want to go
[1:04:27] right so god knows so tell them first
[1:04:31] pour it out liberally um can i ask again
[1:04:35] can i go to that you fill it in
[1:04:39] god said fine go go and then he's so
[1:04:42] merciful i'll send you even a third i'll
[1:04:44] send you uh give you a second warning
[1:04:46] the angel stop in his donkey right in
[1:04:48] between that narrow path
[1:04:50] still merciful and remember he went to
[1:04:52] hell so look at this is god's grace
[1:04:54] it's god's grace it's so important where
[1:04:57] you go where you live praise god so
[1:04:59] important that you support the word of
[1:05:00] god and you do god's perfect will
[1:05:02] the first word of god amen amen god's
[1:05:06] pleading with him don't go to hell don't
[1:05:08] go down there don't curse my don't cause
[1:05:10] barrack to curse and deceive and
[1:05:12] get he's plea constantly pleading that's
[1:05:14] god's mercy praise god
[1:05:16] amen dealt with this physical location
[1:05:24] now here's one thing i want to bring up
[1:05:26] here uh i don't think i'll get the gifts
[1:05:28] because this
[1:05:28] this clock is called that's a busy body
[1:05:30] that clock is a busy body
[1:05:32] uh there's ministries church outside of
[1:05:35] preaching
[1:05:36] and outside of gifts
[1:05:39] the bible lists a few
[1:05:43] so one of them is missionary work now
[1:05:45] that kind of goes with the fivefold but
[1:05:47] you'll see what i mean like there's
[1:05:48] people you can support missionaries
[1:05:51] if you're a sister you can support a
[1:05:52] missionary right
[1:05:54] uh prayer is a ministry and providing
[1:05:57] relief for the poor and needy
[1:05:59] i just got a reminder on my phone every
[1:06:01] month it comes up send this money to
[1:06:02] this
[1:06:03] you know what is it called a
[1:06:07] community pantry
[1:06:10] whatever it is because i remember i sat
[1:06:13] down a few months ago and i asked i
[1:06:14] think asked naomi and amen and who else
[1:06:16] do you know anybody who needs food and
[1:06:17] nobody did nobody
[1:06:19] well the non-better sense i'm out to
[1:06:20] help somebody
[1:06:23] jesus said help the poor praise god and
[1:06:26] do it in a secret don't tell nobody
[1:06:27] about it
[1:06:28] i don't know if i lose my reward for
[1:06:29] tonight but i'm trying to uh i'm
[1:06:32] trying to do what jesus said praise god
[1:06:34] because that's the main thing that this
[1:06:35] believe the sign has against the message
[1:06:37] the message people don't live the word
[1:06:39] of god many of them don't
[1:06:43] many of them don't the brother was
[1:06:45] saying yesterday they left the message
[1:06:46] and
[1:06:47] only two people in a church of 800 came
[1:06:49] to see why they left
[1:06:51] or three maybe three or four that church
[1:06:54] i know everybody
[1:06:55] i know and i told this i said well the
[1:06:57] reason i don't because i was scared i
[1:06:58] didn't have any answers
[1:06:59] i said i imagine that's how a lot of
[1:07:00] people feel because i never studied
[1:07:02] those things i never studied
[1:07:04] brother brandon every single event in
[1:07:05] his life like that i didn't know the
[1:07:07] answers
[1:07:08] i could have showed him where the word
[1:07:09] was wrong you know with his women he
[1:07:11] thought these things there's women
[1:07:12] angels i could
[1:07:13] i could show them that's wrong but i
[1:07:16] couldn't
[1:07:17] i could and i didn't have the time i
[1:07:19] didn't i can't just go study things and
[1:07:22] how am i
[1:07:22] how am i supposed to preach by the way
[1:07:24] i'm going around the world seven times
[1:07:25] how am i supposed to preach that as a
[1:07:26] sermon i just i don't know how i can do
[1:07:27] that
[1:07:28] or brother and the brother man visit the
[1:07:30] graves of
[1:07:32] confucius and muhammad or not i don't or
[1:07:34] buddha i don't know he said he did
[1:07:36] they say he they have there's no proof
[1:07:38] of it well how can you prove it
[1:07:40] are you going gonna go back in time in a
[1:07:41] time machine and follow him around
[1:07:43] i said you'd have to follow him around
[1:07:46] and to really know if and then to the
[1:07:48] vatican did he go to the vatican or not
[1:07:50] they say he lied and
[1:07:51] abroad man didn't i said i believe him
[1:07:54] the only way you can prove it is either
[1:07:55] to talk to him or follow him around his
[1:07:57] entire life and you don't have any first
[1:07:58] person
[1:07:59] you don't have any first person
[1:08:00] knowledge of that so i gave him the
[1:08:01] benefit of the doubt
[1:08:03] because he pointed this bible and he
[1:08:04] made this bible real to me
[1:08:07] and that made that gave me a true
[1:08:09] relationship with jesus christ
[1:08:12] and that's what he said in the church
[1:08:13] book he said i don't write this book so
[1:08:15] you follow me or come to my church
[1:08:17] he said there's one goal that i have
[1:08:19] that's to restore a true spiritual
[1:08:21] relationship
[1:08:21] between god and man amen hallelujah
[1:08:25] that's what i used in my opening
[1:08:26] yesterday i said use that
[1:08:29] i said that's what this message done for
[1:08:30] me delivered me from all my sins
[1:08:33] and gave me a true relationship with
[1:08:34] jesus christ
[1:08:37] oh thank the lord praise god
[1:08:42] now now for anything you do seek god
[1:08:45] for any move in the in a missionary work
[1:08:47] because acts 16
[1:08:49] 6 says paul was forbidden of the holy
[1:08:51] ghost to preach in asia
[1:08:55] god may forbid you to do a ministry
[1:08:59] all missionary work is not led of the
[1:09:01] lord this is the true example
[1:09:05] i know there's quotes on that but again
[1:09:07] are you gonna exalt brother branham
[1:09:08] above jesus and that's really what
[1:09:09] people do they
[1:09:10] even though the bible says this they'll
[1:09:11] still put brother branham above jesus
[1:09:13] and the word
[1:09:14] they'll put brother branham above acts
[1:09:16] 16 6. what up
[1:09:17] that's just so awful they don't even
[1:09:20] know they're doing it sister wendy
[1:09:22] but when they say well brother man said
[1:09:23] it every time a missionary work is
[1:09:25] always that of the lord every time and
[1:09:26] yet the bible
[1:09:28] says this they've essentially made
[1:09:31] brother branham deity and they're
[1:09:32] worshiping a man
[1:09:34] amen praise god i know heaven's saying
[1:09:37] amen
[1:09:38] too hallelujah praise god
[1:09:41] i know it because it's the word
[1:09:45] and even brother branham would admit
[1:09:46] that remember he would just tell stories
[1:09:48] where the holy spirit forbid him to go
[1:09:49] to a place
[1:09:51] right i mean he even admits in his
[1:09:54] stories but he just makes
[1:09:55] quotes and says things that was his
[1:09:57] opinion at that time but
[1:09:58] in actual practice he said i only go
[1:10:01] where the holy spirit leads me praise
[1:10:03] god
[1:10:06] ah thank god for the truth amen see
[1:10:08] that's what i love because the truth is
[1:10:10] not just the bible it is
[1:10:11] but the truth is a spirit praise god and
[1:10:13] as long as i'm in contact with that
[1:10:15] spirit praise god
[1:10:16] that all the truth comes to me amen as
[1:10:19] long as i got a good fellowship with
[1:10:20] that spirit
[1:10:22] because truth is a spirit
[1:10:30] yeah on his second missionary trip god's
[1:10:32] will for paul cut him off from doing
[1:10:34] missionary work in asia minor
[1:10:36] now here's how they did it they started
[1:10:38] by praying and fasting let's go to acts
[1:10:39] 13 1-3 lydia can you pull it up there
[1:10:41] hon this is what we did before we
[1:10:43] started cam's church amen
[1:10:45] uh we had a day of prayer and fasting
[1:10:47] over at the waterloo
[1:10:48] no the mo drive church
[1:10:52] we had a day of prayer and fasting i
[1:10:53] remember because brother bart brought
[1:10:55] over some foam and
[1:10:56] that was that was concrete floors
[1:11:00] so my knees really got sore so he
[1:11:01] brought some foam pads i thought oh
[1:11:03] bless his heart you know
[1:11:05] my knees don't have to hurt now look at
[1:11:06] our look at our troubles in america you
[1:11:10] know then he forgot it so i got to use
[1:11:13] it for a little while afterwards
[1:11:15] now they were in the church that was at
[1:11:16] antioch certain prophets
[1:11:18] and teachers i like that as barnabas and
[1:11:20] simeon that was called
[1:11:21] niger and lucius of cyrene and manean
[1:11:24] which had been brought up
[1:11:26] with herod the tetrarch and saw next
[1:11:27] verse
[1:11:29] so before they did any missionary work
[1:11:31] they ministered now who ministered to
[1:11:33] god
[1:11:34] the prophets and the preachers amen you
[1:11:37] are ministering to god every time you
[1:11:38] sing buddy
[1:11:40] you keep doing it praise god amen you're
[1:11:42] ministering
[1:11:43] to god amen like we were singing that
[1:11:46] song casting crowns and
[1:11:48] so you're singing i'm back there casting
[1:11:49] crowds like give all the crimes of jesus
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:53] give glory to jesus exalt his day give
[1:11:55] him a sacrifice of praise amen
[1:11:58] who they minister to god they're
[1:12:01] blessing god
[1:12:03] and as they fasted the holy ghost said
[1:12:07] separate me barnabas
[1:12:09] and saul for the work where unto i have
[1:12:12] called them
[1:12:13] they didn't know what god wanted to do
[1:12:16] paul didn't know he was going to go with
[1:12:18] barnabas
[1:12:18] so they had to pray and fast before and
[1:12:22] be sent out by the holy spirit
[1:12:24] so if you have a ministry you should
[1:12:27] start with that praying fast
[1:12:29] i remember i used to pray and fast
[1:12:30] before all my youtube videos now i still
[1:12:31] do that most of the time
[1:12:33] but not every time but before i started
[1:12:35] that ministry i pray and fast
[1:12:36] for everyone sometimes i go back and
[1:12:38] look at my first video i'm like oh i
[1:12:39] look like such a silly guy you know
[1:12:42] i'm kind of like scared like greetings
[1:12:44] in the name of the lord
[1:12:47] yeah so i thought i was gonna get a lot
[1:12:49] of backlash i just i'm just honest
[1:12:51] i'm just a man like you're a woman
[1:12:53] you're a man you know
[1:12:54] i thought i was gonna get attacked and
[1:12:56] fired from my job and i had all these
[1:12:57] you know
[1:12:59] i still wonder sometimes on facebook if
[1:13:01] they're gonna catch me on there just
[1:13:02] saying something
[1:13:05] i guess they just do the best we can by
[1:13:07] god's grace trust in the lord verse
[1:13:08] three
[1:13:09] oh yeah and when they fasted and prayed
[1:13:11] they laid their hands to them and sent
[1:13:12] them away
[1:13:13] praise god that's what we do with
[1:13:14] brother cam we pray we fast that day
[1:13:16] we pray with all the saints we united
[1:13:18] together we uh prayed for him anointed
[1:13:20] or ordained him as pastor i
[1:13:22] ordained him as a pastor and then they
[1:13:24] went off they had dedication services
[1:13:25] where brother brooks came and ordained
[1:13:26] him as well
[1:13:28] but that was through our church that
[1:13:29] church started through our church by
[1:13:30] god's grace
[1:13:32] and that's how you do it when you start
[1:13:33] a ministry you got to pray and fast
[1:13:36] and look for god's will brother cam says
[1:13:38] it even now he's like he didn't want to
[1:13:40] be pastor
[1:13:41] cam thought maybe another brother would
[1:13:42] be pastor but the lord put it on our
[1:13:44] hearts that he would be pastor everybody
[1:13:46] looked at him
[1:13:46] when they said who wants to be the
[1:13:47] pastor there was stephen and uh
[1:13:50] who's other preacher maybe andrew allen
[1:13:53] yeah that's right alex
[1:13:54] okay thank you uh there was so there's
[1:13:57] numerous choices
[1:13:58] but when it all went down they all took
[1:14:00] the vote to brother cam
[1:14:02] that was the right choice i love the
[1:14:04] brothers but
[1:14:05] that's right choice see when you're
[1:14:07] praying fast god will direct
[1:14:08] everything amen
[1:14:12] remember everything has to be done in
[1:14:13] god's time
[1:14:17] uh and god will make us uh prosperous
[1:14:20] now
[1:14:20] if you go can you pull up here romans

[1:14:41] five minutes
[1:14:44] okay all right good job uh
[1:14:48] okay maybe i got a little extra time
[1:14:52] to preach
[1:14:53] [Music]
[1:14:55] romans 110 i'm just i'm so happy today i
[1:14:57] just feel real
[1:14:58] free after yesterday i was
[1:15:02] i was three and a half hours of just you
[1:15:04] know and i was praying beforehand and
[1:15:06] fasting and
[1:15:07] my mind i just i was i had a headache
[1:15:09] all night last night because i was under
[1:15:11] such pressure and nervous you know so i
[1:15:12] feel really good today all the
[1:15:13] pressure's off
[1:15:15] now look what he says make and rate paul
[1:15:17] said i make a request to god if by any
[1:15:19] means now at length i might have a
[1:15:21] prosperous journey what
[1:15:22] by the will of god i'm only going to
[1:15:25] travel to rome
[1:15:26] if it's by the will of god and i want
[1:15:28] god to prosper my journey
[1:15:30] so i can come see you see every every
[1:15:33] visit
[1:15:34] well should i visit the church should i
[1:15:36] go visit that church you should pray
[1:15:37] about it
[1:15:39] and i'm not saying like pray every day
[1:15:40] but if something comes up pray about it
[1:15:42] well i could go to this meeting or pray
[1:15:45] right
[1:15:45] pray about it now he's a prophet of
[1:15:48] course
[1:15:49] uh now say in the same book 32 romans 15
[1:15:52] 32
[1:15:53] please whenever you see these here see
[1:15:55] it was all depending upon the will of
[1:15:57] god we should and
[1:15:58] remember james says that do everything
[1:15:59] by the will of god we shouldn't say well
[1:16:01] i'm going to go there next year and i'm
[1:16:02] going to make so much money
[1:16:04] james said don't do that that's foolish
[1:16:06] the business might fall through
[1:16:08] he said say if it be the lord's will
[1:16:11] praise god if it be the lord's will i'll
[1:16:14] do that
[1:16:19] now uh there it is that i may come unto
[1:16:22] you with joy
[1:16:23] by the will of god so you can when you
[1:16:26] visit a place you can be real happy if
[1:16:28] you know it's god's will for you to go
[1:16:29] there
[1:16:30] if not you shouldn't do that right and
[1:16:33] may with you
[1:16:34] be refreshed so see when things fall in
[1:16:38] line with the word of god
[1:16:39] everybody gets refreshed amen
[1:16:43] the prophet the people the pastor
[1:16:45] everybody gets refreshed and we just
[1:16:47] pray about
[1:16:48] things and seek god's will for instead
[1:16:50] of our own
[1:16:54] you know some pastors lock down their
[1:16:57] churches and say you can't go
[1:16:59] you can't go this and you should always
[1:17:00] be at your opposite duty i believe you
[1:17:02] should always be at your post of duty
[1:17:03] but i believe it's free
[1:17:04] if you have the liberty the holy spirit
[1:17:06] and god's leading you go visit somebody
[1:17:08] that's fine
[1:17:09] the main thing to do is just know where
[1:17:10] your home church is because that's where
[1:17:12] you really live your true life
[1:17:14] that's where everybody knows what you
[1:17:15] really are praise god there may be
[1:17:18] there is a there's a opportunity to go
[1:17:20] and you will be refreshed i've done it
[1:17:22] when i go preach places or when i'm not
[1:17:23] preaching i get refreshed
[1:17:26] and you know it's the will of god
[1:17:28] because you pray about it beforehand
[1:17:30] amen and so we look at
[1:17:33] these scriptures and we want to stay
[1:17:34] with them see uh
[1:17:36] prayer is so crucial uh paul prayed and
[1:17:39] fasted before the trips we saw that
[1:17:42] remember acts 12 they had unceasing
[1:17:44] prayers for when paul
[1:17:45] i'm sorry when peter got in prison and
[1:17:47] god responded by sending him an
[1:17:49] angel praise god unceasing prayer so the
[1:17:53] prayer chains we talk about
[1:17:55] uh that's you can clearly see that
[1:17:56] through the scripture
[1:17:59] and now i want to go pull up first
[1:18:00] corinthians 12 8.
[1:18:04] helps there i've always had this
[1:18:05] question about helps is there a gift of
[1:18:08] helps
[1:18:08] now most denominational people they make
[1:18:10] it an extra gift i don't believe it is
[1:18:12] uh it's not one of the nine gifts of the
[1:18:13] spirit no way because paul only listed
[1:18:15] nine
[1:18:16] and nine has a good number nine fruits
[1:18:17] of the spirit remember i preached on
[1:18:19] numerology last year nine nine doesn't
[1:18:22] deal with
[1:18:23] uh you know nine was specifically right
[1:18:25] for
[1:18:26] gifts and for uh fruits of the holy
[1:18:28] spirit
[1:18:29] you can see it planing through the
[1:18:30] scripture but helps
[1:18:33] ah there it is for until one is given by
[1:18:35] the spirit the word of wisdom to another
[1:18:37] i'm sorry it's uh 12 28
[1:18:40] honey i'm sorry my fault first
[1:18:42] corinthians 12 28 i'm probably talking
[1:18:44] too fast
[1:18:45] i'm too free too happy
[1:18:50] and god has some of the church first
[1:18:51] apostles secondarily prophets
[1:18:54] thirdly teachers after that miracles and
[1:18:56] get their healings helps governments
[1:18:58] diversities of tongues so it's a little
[1:19:00] bit confusing you know paul puts
[1:19:01] helps and governments in here what what
[1:19:05] is the gift of government
[1:19:06] you might say maybe deacons it might be
[1:19:08] but it's not one of the nine that he
[1:19:09] already listed earlier in the chapter
[1:19:10] remember the early chapter he lists
[1:19:12] all the nine gifts of the holy spirit so
[1:19:14] the word actually means if you look in
[1:19:15] the greek it means
[1:19:16] aid or relief
[1:19:19] so paul said some people are gifted to
[1:19:22] give aid
[1:19:23] and relief to other people right
[1:19:28] so i wonder who that is in our church
[1:19:29] because as we get to these gifts you
[1:19:30] know we want to
[1:19:32] i that's been that's my whole desire is
[1:19:33] that everybody will know
[1:19:35] the talents god has given to you and
[1:19:36] then just invest in them
[1:19:40] right just whatever god gave you five
[1:19:43] three
[1:19:43] or five two or one you find that talent
[1:19:46] you find that supernatural ability god
[1:19:47] gave you you know
[1:19:49] that's what the word gift means it means
[1:19:50] charisma it means it means a
[1:19:52] supernatural power
[1:19:54] brother amen it means like it's like a i
[1:19:56] don't know
[1:19:58] let me get the word here real quick uh
[1:19:59] extraordinary that's what it means
[1:20:01] an extraordinary power can you imagine
[1:20:02] that some people just have extraordinary
[1:20:04] power to pray
[1:20:05] amen hallelujah praise god some people
[1:20:08] just have extraordinary power
[1:20:10] to sense the needs of people when they
[1:20:12] need food
[1:20:14] or they need clothes it's a gift
[1:20:18] somebody some people just have an
[1:20:19] extraordinary power to give wisdom
[1:20:22] you know do this at that time do this
[1:20:24] not this do this
[1:20:26] at that time some people just have
[1:20:28] extraordinary power
[1:20:29] to pray for the sick and they recover
[1:20:32] amen
[1:20:34] there's just an extraordinary power the
[1:20:36] mother said how do you know
[1:20:37] you've got it because you can do it
[1:20:39] because you see the power operating your
[1:20:41] life
[1:20:42] now the thing where we get just
[1:20:44] discouraged no satan will discourage us
[1:20:46] it's because we want to see it more and
[1:20:48] more and more and more and more and more
[1:20:49] all the time
[1:20:50] and so we don't see it all the time we
[1:20:52] get a little discouraged i know that's
[1:20:53] how i
[1:20:53] am but it's up to god how often it
[1:20:58] happens
[1:21:00] now with helps though it helps it's not
[1:21:02] one of the official gifts
[1:21:04] but paul lays it in here with
[1:21:05] governments it's something that
[1:21:07] people have it's an ability people have
[1:21:11] to help jesus calls this almsgiving
[1:21:15] like joanna tabitha phoebe and the
[1:21:18] macedonian christians are examples of
[1:21:20] relief ministries
[1:21:22] joanna was the wife of chuza herod
[1:21:24] steward
[1:21:25] and teamed up with susannah imagine your
[1:21:28] sisters teaming up
[1:21:30] you know joanna said hey sister susanna
[1:21:32] you want to follow around the prophet of
[1:21:34] god
[1:21:34] and we'll give him food we'll feed him
[1:21:37] we'll mend his clothes you know we'll
[1:21:39] we'll get him water do you want to team
[1:21:41] up and do that and she's like yeah glory
[1:21:43] to god
[1:21:44] let's let's leave our homes behind we
[1:21:47] have a burden for a ministry
[1:21:49] we in other words we have the gift of
[1:21:50] helps now it's not
[1:21:52] one of the nine gifts but it's it's a
[1:21:54] supernatural ability
[1:21:57] uh let's read it uh luke 8 1-3
[1:22:00] they had a supernatural guidance and
[1:22:03] leadership
[1:22:04] we want to help the preacher so jesus
[1:22:06] don't have to worry about getting food
[1:22:07] his disciples don't got to worry about
[1:22:08] going to order pizza
[1:22:11] for us that'd be for us right don't have
[1:22:14] to worry about going to chipotle and get
[1:22:15] your your meal
[1:22:17] let's have the sisters take care of that
[1:22:18] so the brothers can just deal with
[1:22:20] pray for the sick rest preach god's word
[1:22:23] amen
[1:22:26] now it came to pass afterward that they
[1:22:27] went throughout every city in the
[1:22:29] village they were constantly traveling
[1:22:30] preaching and showing the glad tidings
[1:22:32] of the kingdom of god and the twelve
[1:22:33] were with him verse two and a certain
[1:22:35] women which had been healed of evil
[1:22:37] spirits and infirmities mary called
[1:22:38] magdalene
[1:22:39] out of whom went seven devils amen and
[1:22:42] joanna the wife of jesus herod stewart
[1:22:44] and susannah
[1:22:45] and many others which ministered unto
[1:22:46] him of their
[1:22:48] substance so people that were blessed by
[1:22:51] the ministry
[1:22:52] supported the ministry praise god amen
[1:22:55] hallelujah that's what you and i should
[1:22:57] do if this ministry helps you
[1:22:59] then you get behind it with all you got
[1:23:01] praise god amen
[1:23:02] support it with all you got
[1:23:06] tabitha was full of good works and
[1:23:08] olmstein's
[1:23:09] making coats and garments for the needy
[1:23:12] i preached on that numerous time that's
[1:23:14] acts 9 36-39 she just had a burden to
[1:23:17] help the poor
[1:23:18] and god thought so much of it he raised
[1:23:20] her from the dead by peter's prayer
[1:23:24] paul urged the romans to assist phoebe
[1:23:26] in her business of securing
[1:23:29] what's sakura mean aid romans 16 1-2
[1:23:33] i'm trying to close i really am let me
[1:23:35] get to this paragraph here
[1:23:36] we're close
[1:23:39] romans 16 1-2
[1:23:43] and i commend you unto phoebe our sister
[1:23:47] which is a servant of the church which
[1:23:49] is at
[1:23:50] chanteria so this sister had a special
[1:23:53] burden
[1:23:53] for the church she this sister went in
[1:23:57] rome there helped this other church that
[1:23:59] was her burden
[1:24:01] and what you do verse 2 that you receive
[1:24:04] her in the lord has become a saint so
[1:24:06] that you assist her
[1:24:08] in whatever business not preaching she
[1:24:10] has need of you for she has been a
[1:24:12] secure many and of myself
[1:24:14] also
[1:24:19] secure means aid for the needy
[1:24:23] and she previously met paul's physical
[1:24:26] needs
[1:24:27] paul says please help those sisters
[1:24:31] that are making clothes feeding the
[1:24:34] preachers
[1:24:36] now you have to feed me i got god gave
[1:24:37] me a good job you know i don't need i
[1:24:38] don't need your money but i
[1:24:40] you have to feed me but you see somebody
[1:24:42] that needs you see a preacher out there
[1:24:44] that needs something help him out praise
[1:24:45] god
[1:24:46] i don't know if that'll happen but the
[1:24:48] way things are in america
[1:24:51] but how about how many want an open
[1:24:52] heart to this
[1:24:54] lord give me an open heart if there's a
[1:24:57] extraordinary
[1:24:58] ability i have
[1:25:01] to help and aid people or give someone
[1:25:04] relief
[1:25:05] then lead me to do it lord
[1:25:08] let me yield to your power that your
[1:25:10] power will work through
[1:25:12] me so i can help the church over there i
[1:25:15] can
[1:25:16] help the brother over there i can help
[1:25:18] the sister over there
[1:25:25] and this is the key uh second
[1:25:28] corinthians eight
[1:25:29] one to five now we're not going to read
[1:25:31] all that because of time second
[1:25:32] corinthians eight one to five
[1:25:36] here's the key to it you know we wonder
[1:25:39] well lord who should i help who should i
[1:25:40] help
[1:25:41] the first thing before you try to decide
[1:25:43] is give your
[1:25:44] present your body as a living sacrifice
[1:25:46] unto god in other words
[1:25:47] give your body to god first and then god
[1:25:50] will tell you to who to go help praise
[1:25:52] god
[1:25:56] now in this case this is paul calls this
[1:25:58] the collection of the poor
[1:26:02] well i'll just read it moreover brethren
[1:26:03] we do to you to wit of the grace of god
[1:26:06] bestowed upon the churches of macedonia
[1:26:08] how that in the great tribe of
[1:26:09] affliction that of the abundance of
[1:26:11] their joy and their deep poverty
[1:26:13] abounded unto the riches of their
[1:26:14] liberality
[1:26:16] for to their power i bear record yea and
[1:26:18] beyond their power they were willing of
[1:26:20] themselves in other words
[1:26:22] these macedonian states were under
[1:26:24] physical persecution they were poor
[1:26:26] and persecuted but eve they they wanted
[1:26:29] to give so much to help out another
[1:26:30] church
[1:26:32] they were so burdened he said they
[1:26:33] wanted to give more than what they had
[1:26:35] but they only had a certain amount
[1:26:40] verse 4 praying with or praying us with
[1:26:43] much entreaty that we would receive the
[1:26:45] gift
[1:26:45] and take upon us the fellowship of the
[1:26:46] ministry to the saints
[1:26:49] and this they did not as we hope but
[1:26:50] here's here it is right here church how
[1:26:52] do you find who to help
[1:26:53] first he said they gave their own selves
[1:26:56] to the lord
[1:26:57] and unto us by the will of god
[1:27:01] so you've got to fir if you want to do
[1:27:02] god's will church with aid or whatever
[1:27:05] relief
[1:27:05] you got to first give yourself to god
[1:27:07] you got to lay yourself
[1:27:08] on the altar of sacrifice amen amen give
[1:27:11] yourself to god first
[1:27:15] and then god will by the will of god
[1:27:17] he'll give you to help somebody else
[1:27:23] now you can guess i mean if you want to
[1:27:24] guess and just do a ministry and just
[1:27:26] guess that
[1:27:27] i don't think it'll end good but i think
[1:27:29] it'd be outside the will of god
[1:27:31] but first give yourself to god lay in
[1:27:33] god's presence fast and pray
[1:27:35] and see where god would have you to help
[1:27:37] somebody
[1:27:38] remember it's not everybody not
[1:27:40] everybody can be helps right
[1:27:45] so this entire this harmonizes with this
[1:27:48] entire chapter on the will of god
[1:27:50] as you find god's you find god's will
[1:27:52] after you yield yourself
[1:27:54] completely to god
[1:27:58] last scripture first corinthians 16 15.
[1:28:02] first corinthians 15 16.
[1:28:06] let's let's take paul's advice
[1:28:10] and find someone within our home church
[1:28:13] who diligently serves the needy
[1:28:16] and then offer to help that family or
[1:28:18] maybe god's going to raise up one of our
[1:28:19] families
[1:28:20] to be like this family let's read look
[1:28:22] at this look at these scriptures just
[1:28:23] 15-16
[1:28:25] i beseech you brother and you know the
[1:28:26] house of stefanus
[1:28:29] that it is the first fruits of
[1:28:33] caia and that they have addicted
[1:28:36] themselves
[1:28:37] to the ministry of the saints
[1:28:42] that you submit yourselves unto such and
[1:28:45] to
[1:28:45] and to everyone that helpeth with us and
[1:28:48] labor
[1:28:50] paul writes and tells them there's one
[1:28:52] family in the church that's really good
[1:28:54] at minutes they're really burdened i
[1:28:56] says they're good
[1:28:57] they're gifted they're really gifted at
[1:28:59] ministry
[1:29:00] and he said they have addicted
[1:29:02] themselves all they want to do is help
[1:29:04] the church of god
[1:29:06] he said so in other words go help him
[1:29:08] out
[1:29:14] church think about that if just half the
[1:29:17] churches in america preach this
[1:29:18] you've got to be addicted to serving
[1:29:20] other people
[1:29:22] i tell you a lot less teenagers would be
[1:29:23] addicted to marijuana
[1:29:25] you got licensed to be addicted to one
[1:29:27] thing serving people in the church
[1:29:29] praise god
[1:29:30] that's the only time the word addiction
[1:29:31] brother amen the word addict
[1:29:33] addiction that's the only time it's used
[1:29:35] in the entire king james version amen
[1:29:38] we must be addicted to helping other
[1:29:40] people praise god
[1:29:41] amen i know it's a different thing in
[1:29:44] laodicea i know it's different now but
[1:29:45] just look just
[1:29:46] we need to pray look around us praise
[1:29:48] god
[1:29:50] is there needs that we can help out
[1:29:57] i think one of the big just as far as
[1:29:59] time consuming one thing i could use is
[1:30:00] just somebody that likes to
[1:30:02] edit videos but i know that's a it takes
[1:30:04] a special technology gift that would
[1:30:05] save me a lot of time
[1:30:07] because i spend that's that's the thing
[1:30:09] i just wish i could put off like if
[1:30:10] there was a job i could put off on
[1:30:11] somebody
[1:30:12] i'll record the video can you edit it
[1:30:15] because that takes all the time
[1:30:18] uh because god has provided all my
[1:30:19] physical needs and i fast so fast and
[1:30:21] pray and i got all that
[1:30:23] thank god preaching we have all that but
[1:30:26] you know there's different ministries
[1:30:28] you know as uh
[1:30:30] time goes on but let's stand to our feet
[1:30:33] here
[1:30:34] let's uh pray that god will help us to
[1:30:36] be addicted to
[1:30:38] serving the saints in our church oh i
[1:30:40] had one thing on here
[1:30:41] uh you know we had to stop uh sunday
[1:30:43] school a few years ago just because we
[1:30:44] were you know
[1:30:45] worn out there's other reasons too but
[1:30:47] that's a ministry too
[1:30:49] it would take a lot of devotion you know
[1:30:52] it's not easy
[1:30:53] but that's another ministry
[1:30:57] that's a way to be addicted to serving
[1:30:58] other people
[1:31:00] you know people feel that it's you know
[1:31:02] it's all that of the lord
[1:31:09] uh malcolm why don't you come and play
[1:31:12] piano
[1:31:13] you don't have to come back because we
[1:31:14] just want to have a word of prayer here
[1:31:16] let's pray for jose's uh
[1:31:20] yeah let's pray for jose's family
[1:31:24] they're not doing good at all against
[1:31:25] covet
[1:31:26] now sometimes church we know that's fear
[1:31:28] right um
[1:31:32] it's like the box of rattlesnakes you
[1:31:33] know if the devil lies to you and tells
[1:31:35] you you got it then
[1:31:37] you get it you know spirits are not the
[1:31:40] spirits are waiting there right they're
[1:31:41] waiting
[1:31:42] to anoint people they want to anoint
[1:31:44] people the demon powers
[1:31:46] um and then they get it so i don't know
[1:31:48] the situation
[1:31:49] but we know the holy ghost is greater
[1:31:51] than than any demon
[1:31:54] and the prayer of the saints
[1:31:57] prevails above all things all human
[1:32:00] powers
[1:32:01] as long as it's god's will and i know we
[1:32:03] know it's god's will to heal 99
[1:32:05] of the time so i'm believing it's god's
[1:32:08] will to heal jose's
[1:32:09] stepdaughter and son-in-law so let's
[1:32:13] pray together here uh
[1:32:16] i do want brother amen if you and johnny
[1:32:18] don't pray for me
[1:32:26] [Music]
