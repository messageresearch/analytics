TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm happy to be here this morning for this fine gathering of of people especially for the young people as I understand that this [music] uh service this morning is dedicated to the young people of uh Sri. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord [music] Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about youth meetings or youth camps. So, by the grace of God, we'll do that by the scripture and by some quotes [music] from God's prophet, brother Brandham. I received this question through an email from a brother from Central America. And to summarize it, there's a brother in the message [music] from Central America and he doesn't believe in youth camps for at least three reasons. So the first reason is because it's an activity promoted by denominations. Second, he said they are no longer spiritual but business related or done for business purposes. I would imagine money, but I don't know for sure. That's not written in there. But this is just the accusation. And then third, it's a pure social event. So, this precious brother from Central America said, "Can we in the message of the hour do youth camps?" That's a great question. I personally believe it is okay and can be very helpful and beneficial to do youth camps. Now, I don't do them for a number of reasons which I'll get to later, but let me quickly address these three reasons that this one person doesn't believe in youth camps. First, it's an activity promoted by denominations. That might be true, but not all activities done by denominations are wrong. Such as if denominations want to have more prayer, more preaching, or more singing. There would be nothing wrong with that because the Bible tells us to gather more as we see that day approaching in Hebrews 10:24 and 25. And brother Brandham said in the fourth seal, God has got children in the Catholic system. He's got children in the Methodist system. He's got children in the Baptist system. He said, "Now remember, there's people out there just like you, but it's a system that kills the Antichrist spirit that finally gets them to place till they till they won't hear truth." So, we cannot condemn the people in denominations. Now, we can condemn the Antichrist spirit and the Antichrist system of denominations, but there still are believers, few believers, because Jesus said, "Few that find the narrow road in the denominational system." And therefore, our heart goes out to them. Our heart echoes Revelation 18:4, "Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins and her plagues." So, just because a denomination does an activity doesn't mean it's sinful. Everything must go back to the word of God. The word of God is our absolute prove all things. Try every spirit as the Bible says. And also, you know, some people might say uh youth camps originated with denominations. That's why they're wrong. That's not exactly right either because brother Ram said in the seventh seal, he was talking about seminaries. He said they just see it in the ecclesiastical way of looking at it and they see it in the way that the seminaries taught it. That was God's way at one time, but we've lived a past that. That's from the seventh seal. Beautiful quote there. Notice Brother Random said, "Seminaries was God's way at one time." And of course, he's speaking of the man anointing age, the reformation age. Brother Brandham even said in the church age book that the preaching and teaching and writing of the Reformation or the man age was the greatest preaching and teaching of all time. It's so sad though. Message preachers today will call themselves the greatest of all time. That's a very prideful spirit. So, we just have to pray for them. Pride goes before the fall. So, these men will fall if they don't repent of their declarations that they're the greatest of all time. But these are important quotes to see here from God's prophet, Brother Brandham. There's still children of God in the denominational system that have to come out. And seminaries was God's way at one time. And so youth meetings can still be God's way because there's nothing that condemns youth meetings in the Bible and the Bibles are absolute. And then thirdly, this brother said youth meetings are pure social events and there's no way to prove that. That's a very subjective view and it might be true for some youth meetings whether in the message or denomination. But you can't condemn all youth meetings just because some are bad. Just like you can't condemn all churches that don't have youth meetings as bad or good. You have to look at each one individually again because the Bible does not forbid gathering more as we see that day approaching. The Bible does not forbid youth camps, youth meetings, youth conventions, annual meetings. The Bible does not condemn any of that. All right. So, let's go a little bit further in the scripture here. There's no scripture against youth meetings. And in fact, it's a good thing because you're gathering more as you see that day approaching. Some youth camps or conventions or annual meetings might be motivated by a business mindset or a social mindset, but that doesn't mean all are motivated with the wrong motivations. No doubt some of them are motivated by pure motivations to get young people experiences with God, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, or maybe justification, sanctification. In other words, they want God to meet the youth people wherever they are and help them to grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord. The Bible also says, "Unto the pure, all things are pure." So if the Bible does not forbid youth camps, then it can be a pure thing as long as the hearts of the believers are pure. It's wrong for the brother to say every youth convention or youth meeting is wrong because he hasn't been to every youth meeting or every youth convention. I think if the brother was honest and could visit and could visit other youth conventions, he'd see that God still uses youth camps to save the youth, deliver them, heal them, fill them with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's undeniable, friends, in the Old Testament, God loved the annual gatherings of his people at the seven feasts of Israel. Remember in Exodus 23:17, 14-1 17, God said, "Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year." There are three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord. Those were the three mandatory national gatherings. Passover, Pentecost, and trumpets, atonement, and tabernacles. Even at the feast of tabernacles, God told Moses in Deuteronomy 31:10-12 that at the end of every seven years in the feast of tabernacles, gather the people together, men and women and children, that they may hear and that they may learn the word of God. So God even required at the end of seven years for everyone to come and hear the word of God. This was a scheduled public assembly, annual assembly, annual convention. We'd say it was for teaching, renewal, accountability to the word of God. Remember Elcana in 1st Samuel 1 verse three, he went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. And remember, Hannah went every year and she got discouraged because she didn't have a child. That's when she was weeping. And Eli thought she was drunk, but she was just pouring out her soul before the Lord. And then God heard Hannah's cry. God spoke through Eli to tell Hannah that she'd have a son, and she had Samuel. Of course, we know that by God's grace, but that was at an event of this annual temple worship, the annual conventions, we'd say, of the seven feasts of Israel. We also see this in the New Testament in Acts 15:36. Paul said, "Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of God and see how they do." So, this was essentially a scheduled review, a spiritual check-in. We'd say the apostles would come back and see at a routine time to give oversight to the churches that had started by the grace of God. And then even Paul from the transition from the Old Testament to the New Testament, he kept some of the feasts of Israel in Acts 18:21. He said, "I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem." So he still considered these feasts sacred seasons for worshiping and gathering. So we must keep that in mind as well. I believe the Bible says in Colossians chapter 2 that we should not judge others traditions, other holy days that people have because the Bible said also in Romans that one man will esteem a day holy. The other doesn't. So it doesn't matter. Give them their Christian liberty because the kingdom of God is not in meat and drink but in righteousness, peace, and joy of the Holy Ghost. So every believer has that freedom to consider one day more holy to have annual meetings, annual conventions, times to seek the Lord and worship God. There's nothing wrong with that. And even leaders coming together to consider matters is a godly thing. We see that in Acts 15:6. The apostles and elders came together for to consider this matter. So this was a assembly of the elders, the apostles. It was about doctrine. And of course, St. Paul was there. He was a prophet and a prophet attended meetings. So remember friends, the book of Acts is our blueprint. The book of Acts is the pattern we should all try to attain to as brother Ram said in the church age book. So I think that's a pretty good Bible foundation by God's grace. Now let's look at some quotes from God's prophet. And I'm just going to read them. I'm probably not going to play all these, but I encourage you to go study them yourself. Prove all things. Prove what I'm saying. make sure I'm rightly dividing the word of truth and understanding these quotes correctly. The first one is influence November 30th, 1963. Brother Ram said, "I'm happy to be here this morning, especially for the young people as I understand that this service this morning is dedicated to the young people of Shreveport." And he said it's a highlight, a red letter to get to address the boys and girls that will be tomorrow, if there is a tomorrow. So, we're happy for this. So, brother Ram was happy he got invited to [clears throat] preach directly to the young people. So, anyone that condemns youth services probably doesn't know this quote. Brother Ram then mentions how many different denominations are gathered there. So, Brother Ram preached to different young people from different denominations and was happy to do it. Now, this is only one quote about youth services. So, there could be more, maybe not. I don't know. But I never heard brother Ram condemn youth services. And if so, please show me. Can you please prove me wrong? He was happy to preach to the young people. I'm happy to be here this morning for this fine gathering of of people especially for the young people as I understand that this uh service this morning is dedicated to the young people of Sri and it's a very uh fine time in my life and a highlight I call it a red letter to get to address the boys and girls that will will be tomorrow if there is a tomorrow. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, we're happy for this. How many different denominations is represented here this morning in this little group of people? I'd say Methodist, hold up your hands. I just heard him say from denominations. All right. Baptist, hold up your hands. Fine. Presbyterian, just look. Lutheran, Pentecostals, and and um or Nazarines, Pilgrim Holiness, any other denomination I haven't mentioned. Raise up your hand. Wonder if there's Catholics in here. Let's see them. Raise up your hand. Yeah. See, would there happen to be an Orthodox Jew? Let's see your hand. All right, sir. Sometimes I believe here not long ago the last meeting here we had one of the rabbis here in the meeting from the Jewish Orthodox which is the really the mother of all this. See she brought forth the child the Orthodox church uh brought forth the Christian church out of of Judaism come Christianity. And so we are very happy to see you represented here this morning at your church and your [clears throat] stand. And I I certainly believe this that that God if he should come today, he would he would not ask that question if we were all going in this morning. He would just u take those who are ready to go. Next in token September 1st 1963 brother Ram talked about he would go to preach annual meetings in Phoenix. He says then my meetings comes up in Phoenix in January. It's the annual meeting there for Christian businessmen. So brother Ram would go back every year and preach the same convention, the same annual meetings by God's grace. So again we can't condemn annual meetings God did in the Old Testament. Here brother Rams doing in the New Testament. We see the apostles doing it. It's a very scriptural thing to do by God's grace. Then in 1956, April 15th, the deep call to the deep in Columbia, South Carolina. Brother Ram said he was willing to come back the next year for meetings in South Carolina. Brother Ram said, "I trust that by God's help that next April, Brother Bigby told me that he would like for me to return back having full cooperation and fellowship with all the other churches." And there was numerous churches cooperating in these conventions here by God's grace in 1960 June 12 speak to the rock shiake Ohio brother Ram said I want to say this that this has been one of the finest revivals or meetings that I've ever had. In paragraph one down in paragraph 11 he says I hope to be here again next year the Lord willing. Thank you. Thank you. And they were revival meetings. So this church in Shiitak, Ohio had annual revival meetings and brother Ram said, "I hope to be again here next year." So a yearly revival meeting. There's nothing wrong with that. Brother Ram was a part of that. He was often a part of that doing the work of an evangelist as the angel Lord told him to do. Show us the father in southern Pines, North Carolina, June 9th, 1962. Brother Ram says, "I love to be there and set under the teaching of these great servants of Christ. Brother Veale, Brother Parker, Brother Iverson, and would like to hear them. So, this kind of goes along with the video I said how brother Ram liked to sit down and say amen and follow the preachers. Here, Brother Ram says it again. He'd like to hear the living men of the five-fold ministry. Brother Ram, he said he loved to hear them carry on in that harmony. He said, "The next man that raises up and carries on the harmony, that's the Holy Spirit." So, brother Ram loved to be in these conventions where men would preach and there was total harmony of all the preachers in the convention. Brother Brham said, "Brother Parker graciously invited him next year if the Lord carries to come back and have a day to just sit and talk of my own experience of how meeting the spirit itself." And then he said, "Brother Parker, his great love, inviting me to come here to this convention and privilege of turning me loose on the platform to say whatever God would put on my heart to say." So again, Brother Ram attended this convention in North Carolina, Southern Pines, and was invited back for the next year. In presuming June 10th, 62, Brother Ram said it was sweet to ask him to come back the next year for the convention. Brother Parker Thomas has been so sweet to ask me to come back again next year in time of the convention. So again, brother Ram repeatedly was asked to come back and preach conventions revival services. And then in 1965, January 25th, this day the scriptures fulfilled, Phoenix, Arizona, Bill Ram said, "I've enjoyed this. I believe this convention more than any convention I've ever been in." He said, "More harmony and such real fellowship and brotherly love." He said, "I've met many new delegates of heaven, new brethren that I've had the privilege to shake hands with and talk to." He said, "Brother Carl announced me to be back next year if the Lord is willing and we are here on earth. And I hope to meet every one of you here next year again and bring another delegate with him and with she." In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Again, we can see the Bible and God's prophet, Brother Brandham, supporting annual revival, annual conventions, loving the harmony of the Holy Spirit between different churches, all these different churches coming together to hold special meetings. Again, it's fulfilling Hebrews 10:24 and 25. and the other verses in the book of Acts where apostles or elders that started churches will come back and visit and see how everyone is doing, overseeing them, just making sure their faith is strong by the grace of God. There's nothing wrong with revivals. Brother Brandham loved having personal revivals as I showed in that last video about Samson. Brother Brham said he needed a revival while Brandham Tabernacle was having a revival even after the seven seals. So friends, let's be positive about youth meetings. revival meetings, conventions, as long as the hearts of the people are pure. Unto the pure, all things are pure. And if there are some conventions that are motivated by social reasons or money, just pray for them. Stay away from them. If you feel led of the Lord, I imagine I would, but if you feel led of the Lord to go to youth meetings or conventions, go to them by the grace of God. And I realize I didn't really share why I don't do it very often. There's a couple reasons I don't do a lot of youth meetings and youth camps. First, uh the financial resources are just limited in our church. We're just a very small church. Takes a lot of financial resources to go rent a convention or some type of campgrounds. It's very expensive. And as a small church, we don't have the means to do that. So, we don't do that. Second, I have a very large family, so it's hard to uproot my whole family with nine children and then go stay at a place for numerous days in a row. I have adult children that work full-time, so it's hard to get all of us to up and leave and also I have a full-time teaching job, public teaching job as well. So, I have to work full-time and then pastor full-time as well. So, the summer would be the only time I could go to conventions. But again, in the summertime, that's my time to relax. That's my time to help out my family. And also, as a pastor, I'm called to stay with the sheep. So, that's the burden I've had for many years, just stay with the local church. Perhaps there'll be a time and season where I go to more youth conventions, youth meetings, and so forth. But right now, I just feel led to stay home, feed the flock of God that God has given me oversight over by the grace of God as a pastor, a earthly shepherd. But of course, I'm under the great shepherd, the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm just trying to be faithful as a shepherd. Additionally, one thing I want to say as well is that when I came in the message, there was really no burden to do youth meetings. I came in the message at the end of 2001 and the emphasis I heard was simply being born again or receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was preached constantly. I never heard about youth meetings. And so I believe I was born again in 2003 during a regular Sunday morning service by the grace of God. And I've heard, but I can't recall that there's a quote from Brother Brandham that says, "The way you're born into the kingdom of God is the way you normally continue going." So, if you have that quote, let me know. I'd love to hear it. But I just heard a couple preachers say that quote generally, but I've never seen it myself. So that would make sense to me because I was born again just by daily seeking, reading my Bible, praying, longing, crying out for the Holy Ghost, just going to church every time the church doors were open, reading my Bible every day, praying, seeking God daily. But I understand how others other churches might emphasize these annual youth meetings, annual conventions, annual revivals, and there's nothing wrong with that. But the main thing is to get people born again. And what I've told people in the past too, you know, you don't see the book of Acts having youth meetings. And again, there's nothing wrong with them, but you just see the book of Acts spreading the revival of the baptism of the Holy Ghost as Paul ordained elders in every church. Missionaries would take the gospel to places, cities that had no churches. Believers would get saved, filled with the Holy Ghost. churches would be established and then Paul or the apostles would move on. So again, the book of Acts is our blueprint. There's also Christian liberty for churches to have youth camps, youth meetings, revival, and so forth, conventions. So I think again according to my own experience in the message, I've just gone that way. That's all I've known. And even my children, some of my older children have claimed to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Not in special meetings necessarily or youth camps or conventions, but just simply in the meetings that we already hold consistently by the grace of God. My emphasis has been to just receive the Holy Ghost. Not go somewhere to try to get it, but just in your daily life, get justified, sanctified, and filled with the Holy Ghost. So, I hope that's helpful by the grace of God. And I just want to say this too. It takes great sacrifices to have youth meetings and youth conventions. And God will bless all those people who sacrifice. I think of all the sisters or brothers who cook food for people, donate their time, money, resources. Those are all great sacrifices. And God will richly reward those people. God sees your labor of love and your labor of love is not in vain. So friends, just have a loving heart. Seek you first the kingdom of God. Gather more as we see that day approaching. Do whatever God's called you to do. Whether youth conventions or annual revival meetings, whatever God has called you to do, do it. Draw nigh to God. He will draw nigh to you. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you. And may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [music] heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed.
