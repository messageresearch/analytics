TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and a voice said to me I'll meet you in there that'll be the third pool I said why he said well it won't be a public show like the other and I came too greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this videos to answer a viewer's question about my thoughts on brother bram's 1956 tent vision and why I believe it's fulfilled hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA for the past 18 years and I defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ as Jesus revealed it to St Paul and then restored it through his Endtime Prophet brother William Marin and brandham 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character so before getting into these four reasons I believe the temp vision is fulfilled I just want to reference a previous video I made it's called the brown bear Vision Video this is a 70-minute video and towards the end of this video I give brief responses to some questions about brother br's Ministry around the 46 minute Mark I do a short section on the tent vision and so a lot of that content a lot of the quotes and scriptures will be in this video as well and I'll leave a link to the description to that video so you can go watch it if you like by God's grace so here's the four reasons I believe the tent vision is fulfilled first brother random said that the angel told him the tent vision would not be a public show and of course the tth vision was about the third poll so we know the first two polls were public the first poll was the sign in brother bram's hand which I've read numerous books about people that were in brother bram's meetings and they actually witnessed those dots or patterns on brother Ram's hand in order to discern sicknesses and that was a public sign people could see it publicly and of course the second poll was the discernment of the thoughts and in tents of the heart as Hebrews 4:12 speaks of the word of God is a discerner dividing us under soul body and spirit and of course that's also called the Messianic sign that Jesus manifested in John chapter 1 and John chapter 4 but of course that Ministry was never manifested to the Gentiles that's why Jesus had to come to brother brandham at the end time and give him a son of man Ministry in order to show that Messiah sign to the Gentiles and brother R said that sign was the last sign to the Gentiles before the Rapture with thus sayith the Lord there's at least six quotes on this so let's listen to one of them by God's grace is right here among you you'll just remember thus saith the Lord you will never in any oh more Gentile Church age ever see any sign to succeed this go greater this is the last sign to the church so this first reason is the third poll wasn't a public show the first two polls were public so the third poll was the opening of the word and of course it involved the revelation of the Seven Seals and so brother Ram told us when he preached the revelation of the Seven Seals he met with the pillar of Fire or the angel Lord or the Holy Ghost every day for seven days straight in order to get the Revelation and of course this was a private meeting between the Lord and brother brandham I think it was at brother Banks Wood's house if I'm not mistaken so first let's listen to the quote from from why are people so tossed about January 1st 1956 brother Ram said it won't be a public show let's listen to the quote and a voice said to me I'll meet you in there that'll be the third pull I said why he said well it won't be a public show like the other and I came too now the next quote is from the seventh seal uh brother Ram said it's been a tremendous week I'm tired my mind is tired something going strange on every day and then a few paragraphs later he says I've been sitting up there in the room for 8 days and so we see he was shut in it wasn't a public show of the Holy Spirit visiting him and manifesting the revelation of the Seven Seals let's listen to those two quotes together and now we are grateful to God for what he has showed us I've been sitting in the room up there for eight days and the message that I have just got through explaining to you many of you here will understand this has been a tremendous week for me I'm tired my mind is tired because I I have was the best that I could do and something strange going on every day I would be amazed to walk in the room and be there for a few minutes and see something is turn me completely around okay reason number two is that the angel of the Lord interpreted to brandom the meaning of the little room the angel lord said it was in a prayer closet or a place of prayer according to Matthew chapter 6 so the angel Lord cited the scripture Matthew 6:6 but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou H has shut thy door pray to the Father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly so here's the quote from 1956 it's from being led of the Holy Spirit February 19th where brother Ram says the the angel told him to go in the closet and pray and I love what brother Ram said the angel was always scriptural and that's exactly right let's listen to the quote and I said I don't understand that in there and watch he's always scriptural he said did not our Lord say when thou prayest be not like the Hypocrites that like to make a show said enter into the secret closet and when you've done so close the door then pray your father what seeth in secret and he that seeth in secret shall reward thee openly and he said you remember that name that you were hunting that time that you dreamed about and I said yes he said I'll meet you in there in this time it won't be a public Show and The Vision left me now we got the T in making and then in there I'll be able to care pry line right on through now you remember I speak this before it comes to pass the exceedingly abundantly is fixing to take place I can't wait till I get into that place I just my hearts are yearning and burning now let's listen to two quotes from brother Brandon from 1963 the first one is on questions and answers on the seals brother brand said he was to himself alog together in a boarding place he's been alone and it's been a really great time and then after that I'll play a quote from the next day the seventh seal where brother brandom says he's been in that room with the shades pulled down in a light on for 8 days then I'll play the quote from the seventh seal where brother Bram said something strange would go on every day he'd read from UAH Smith and other writers and he say it just didn't work out right then he walked up and down the floor while kneel down and pray go back pick up the Bible and then all of a sudden he got real quiet and it just unfolded it and he'd grab a pen and write real quick whatever he was seeing and doing in the vision watching it like that and wrote it down then he take the rest of the day and search the scriptures in order to prove all things let's listen to the quotes and I I've been to myself all together and been boarding at a place or going down eating at a place and um I've just been alone so it's been really a great time and my mind at this time the reason I had that healing service this morning because my human mind is becoming so um way from my own way of thinking I have tried to stay in a in a room with a Shades pulled down a light on this is the eighth day and not even got in my car to to go anywhere I had to go with some brothers down to Banks to sign some notes and things on money and stuff that been borred for this church but I but I come right straight back and went right to study and the strange thing there hasn't been one person said anything or usually they're knocking and pulling and around there hasn't been one thing it's been very phenomenal Hallelujah where I've been eating at at brother Woods's usually that place is packed around with cars and they had eight or 10 different people go to come stay with them during his time and not a one of them come Lord and here I go in there I pick up the notes I pick up books of Dr Smith you're a Smith and all all the writers and and read in read down in their books I see now here's the Sixth Seal here's the fourth seal now what do this man say he'd say well it was this that I look over here and get another man he said it was such and such and it looked like I just it just didn't work right and I thought well what is it Lord I walk up and down the floor a while I kneel down and pray go back and pick up the Bible sit down read walk back and forth then all of a sudden when I got quiet you're just unfolded like that then I grab a pen right quick go to WR it down like that whatever I was seeing and doing watching it like that to got it roll down then I take the rest of the day and go down chase this out and see if it tied all the way down through the scriptures then it prove all things I got this year I think now there's many people had Visions there's many been Revelations if it's contrary to the word leave it alone that's right leave it alone now the third reason I believe the tent vision is fulfilled is because of the healings of Supernatural Miracles that took place during the week brother R preached the Seven Seals so in the T Vision brother Ram said at least two people were healed there was at least two miracles so let me play that quote it's from being led of the Holy Spirit again February 1956 the ram said the light went into that building and a woman come out on the ambulance stretcher and she was pushing the stretcher out on the other side and a man came out packing his crutches so there were Supernatural Miracles let's listen that quote now look and here what that real soft like moving away from me and went down and went into that little building and then there's something difference between the light and the angel cuz he was still here with me and the light had went into the building and this Angel still speaking behind me which is a big man and he said I will meet you in there so then I said I don't understand why in there he said watch and this woman when she come out of there on the amlet stretcher she was pushing the stretcher out the other side and she said uh the lady asked her with a said what what happened she said I don't know it just happened she said I've been in a Stretcher said I've been down in bed for years and here come the man out packing his crutches and they asked him what said he didn't know and he's coming to the platform to testify now to support that that there were Supernatural Miracles the week of the Seven Seals brother Ram said in the seventh seal that a Collins boy was dying but the Lord Jesus healed him that week then also a girl was battling leukemia and she was healed that week as well brother Bram said the kingdom of God is coming we're just drawing closer to God all the time so in both cases there was miraculous Supernatural healings let's listen to the quote and I'm sure that you've noticed that things has been happening this week I'm sure you noticed that little Collins boy land there dying other night that little leukemia [Music] girl the kingdom of God God is coming right and it's becoming more from the negative to the positive as it has been now that AR to choke people from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then here here amen we're just drawing closer to God all the time and finally reason number four there was people receiving salvation in 1956 again being led of the Holy Spirit February 19th brother brandom said he made an altar call and hundreds of people were receiving the Lord Jesus let's listen to the quote I said yes so um got the line ready to throw again and just as it did at that time he taken me away again and he stood me up in the air over a great Auditorium of or big tent oh I never seen such a tent spread way out and in that there was a looked like i' made an Al calling hundreds of people real softly and sweetly were weeping standing at the altar receiving the Lord Jesus and I said that looks better now to show how that's fulfilled during the week of the Seven Seals brother man told us in the seventh seal that another group had been baptized he said it runs over 100 this week of people being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and friends no doubt more were saved that weren't maybe baptized or didn't have the chance to be baptized maybe they just came in the meetings and stepped out but clearly we can see over 100 people receive salvation that week let's listen to the quote i' like to add this that of all the services I've ever had in my life I believe this week has been the most glorious time of all my life in Services no matter what I have I've seen great Miracles performed of course before in healing services but this is beyond that it's been one of the great times highlights of my life is to be here and seeing the little Tabernacle take on this different look not only that but the inside take on a different look Hallelujah and now uh was asking Billy he was so long back com and getting me he said there have been another group baptized which runs over a hundred this week of uh people being baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen so we are are thankful and God bless you in closing friends hope this short video was a blessing by the grace of God I wanted to make a quick short video in order to answer this precious person's question by the grace of God I believe these four reasons are enough to prove the T Vision was fulfilled and remember friends prophets don't always know their Visions are fulfilled such as John the Baptist remember in Matthew chap 11 John wasn't sure whether Jesus was the Messiah or not despite having the vision that's recorded in John chapter 1 where John saw the Spirit ascending like a dove and it Abode and remained it descended and remained on Jesus Christ so John saw the vision and when he saw it and Jesus was baptized he was sure he was the Messiah but then through prison and other no doubt tests and trials his eagle eyes got filmed over as brother Ram said he had moments of doubt and he wasn't for sure if the vision was fulfilled or not so that's clearly a Bible precedent that prophets don't always understand Visions or know if they've come to pass or not and also want to say too I didn't spend a lot of time researching the tent vision for this video so no doubt there's probably more reasons the tent vision is fulfilled and there's other details I'd forgotten about cuz I haven't been really studying that lately so I look forward to getting some comments and so maybe we can do a part two of this video by God's grace if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
