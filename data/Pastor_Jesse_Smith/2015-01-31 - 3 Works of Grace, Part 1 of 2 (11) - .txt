TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings friends in the name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to show god's three works of grace he uses to fully live inside christians the bible teaches that we are temples buildings or tabernacles of the holy ghost according to the following scripture first corinthians 6 19 what know ye not that your body is the temple the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and you are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods just as the tabernacle of moses in the old testament had three sections to it so the human being has three parts to their tabernacle the body the spirit and the soul first thessalonians 5 23 and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it just as god desired each of the three sections of the tabernacle of moses to be holy today he desires to dwell inside every christian's body spirit and soul in order that he might purify his children and bring glory to his own holy name god uses three works of grace to fully redeem man and have first place or preeminence in the lives of christians as the bible says christ wants to have preeminence in all things especially our lives colossians 1 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence there are three works or steps god uses to completely control and guide the temples or lives of his believing children work number one justification work number two sanctification work number three the baptism or immersion of the holy ghost the bible clearly teaches that the first two works of grace are done by the working of the holy ghost while the third and final work is the coming of the holy ghost himself christ in you the hope of glory coming to seal and abide inside the soul of the christian first corinthians 6 11 and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god let's explain each step the first work is justification this word means to declare or pronounce to be just or righteous as such he ought to be so in other words the believer is righteous in the sight of god as though he never sinned in the first place through faith in the shed blood of jesus christ justification comes by a believer's faith in the finished work of jesus christ's death burial and resurrection therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification justification takes place at the moment of true repentance when the sinner believes in christ jesus and turns from all their wicked ways faith is the foundation of each christian's experience as seen from the teachings of saint peter in second peter 1 verse 5. furthermore justification is the moment when a person is saved from the wrath of god and has the promise of eternal life but the person is not yet filled with the holy ghost as we will show through the examples of peter cornelius and the ephesian christians later in this video we have three videos on true repentance that we pray will be a help to you the viewer as you seek to allow god to have full preeminence in your life beginning with justification the second work is sanctification which means purification of heart and life this work is the removal of all contaminants or worldly sins and habits from the believer's daily life by the work of the holy ghost through the teaching of the word of god sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied in sanctification the holy spirit will continually cleanse the heart the daily life and actions of a christian notice that in saint peter's teaching about how godliness is restored to man sanctification begins after faith or justification and is a process that includes the addition of the six following spiritual attributes virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness once these six attributes are added to your life by sanctification of the spirit and also after faith is received as your foundation then your temple or tabernacle is ready to be capped off with the holy ghost the holy ghost will baptize believers after the second work of grace has been completed as acts 5 32 teaches but sanctification is the cleansing process god uses to teach his children to crucify the lusts of the flesh and to obey the commands of the bible the third and final work is the baptism of the holy ghost in this third and final step god himself in the form of his holy spirit comes to anoint abide and dwell in the soul of the christian we see the abiding of the holy ghost from the life of jesus as the bible records that the holy ghost in the form of a dove fell on jesus and this spirit abode and remained on him according to saint john 1 verses 32 and 33 then in acts chapter 10 verse 38 peter said that jesus was anointed or provided with the holy ghost and power the baptism of the holy ghost is the born-again experience jesus taught that each person must receive in saint john chapter 3 verses 3 through 8 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god as mentioned earlier the baptism of the holy ghost is christ in you according to colossians 1 verse 27 the spirit of christ is now inside the christian in such a way that the bible says he is sealed unto the day of his redemption according to ephesians 1 verse 13 and ephesians 4 verse 30 thus the holy ghost baptism is a seal or authentication that the believer is a genuine christian this seal of the holy ghost baptism never leaves during the earthly life of the christian this constant abiding presence of the holy ghost also keeps the believer faithful to god through his entire lifetime the spirit's abiding keeps the believer fighting the good fight of faith never giving up and going back into a life of sin with a desire to perfect holiness in the fear of god according to second corinthians chapter 7 verse 1. we believe there is a great danger in not teaching the three works of grace the main danger is that preachers will tell new converts that they are born again when in all reality they are only justified or recently saved as preachers we do not want to mislead those who are seeking god if the three works of grace are not taught properly then those seeking god can be greatly mistaken about where they stand in god no doubt many potential converts have been told by preachers that they are saved and going to heaven and then those same potential converts eventually leave the church and deny christ by their words and actions bringing forth no fruit of genuine repentance as john the baptist spoke of in matthew chapter 3 verse 8. this is obvious because many new converts don't immediately give up sinful habits such as cussing smoking drinking arguing stealing sexual sins and the like so their lives prove that they are not yet sanctified because the contamination of the world remains a part of their lives and so because of this false teaching the new converts believe they are saved and born again and are not taught to continue on seeking god for a sanctified life or an even higher life than that such as having the power and the anointing of the baptism of the holy ghost then many new converts often fall out of church and go back into sin and iniquity their lives never reach a sanctified condition and so it is doubtful that their conversion was in fact a genuine conversion experience the bible fully supports this in numerous places the first is matthew 7 verses 21-23 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter in the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity this is the reason we emphasize sanctification as the second work of grace because the work of the spirit cleans the heart and life of the believer so that they no longer do wicked things notice also that jesus said many not a few many on the day of judgment will remind him of the works and supernatural gifts they exercised in the name of jesus but jesus will tell them that he never knew them because of their wicked sins and lawless lives we learn from jesus the operation and anointing for gifts of the holy spirit do not prove someone is saved a person's own holy life proves they are saved because they are doing the will of god which is the word of god the second example is 2 thessalonians chapter 2 verses 10 through 12 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness here saint paul teaches that the antichrist will deceive through unrighteousness or violating the law or word of god the teaching the antichrist will allow deceive people to live in the pleasures of sin those with the antichrist will not love the truth of the bible and so they cannot be saved god will let them believe the lies that they love and they will be damned because they did not want to believe the truth thank you for viewing part one please continue viewing part two at the
