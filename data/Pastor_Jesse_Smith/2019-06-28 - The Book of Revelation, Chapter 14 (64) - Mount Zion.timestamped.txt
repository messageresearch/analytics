[0:03] Revelation chapter 14 the themes of this
[0:08] chapter include the lamb with his
[0:11] 144,000 Jewish saints on Mount Zion the
[0:16] announcements of three angels and the
[0:19] Battle of Armageddon
[0:22] the symbols and key revelations include
[0:25] the father's name written in their
[0:27] foreheads the three angels the Saints
[0:31] that keep the commandments of God and
[0:33] the faith of Jesus the harvest of the
[0:36] earth and the winepress of the wrath of
[0:39] God the father's name written in their
[0:43] foreheads is a symbol of the baptism of
[0:46] the Holy Ghost as previously taught in
[0:49] Revelation 7 verse 3 and revelation 9
[0:52] verse 4 this is the same Holy Ghost
[0:54] baptism that Jesus urged his followers
[0:57] to receive in acts 1 verse 5 which they
[1:01] did receive on the day of Pentecost in
[1:03] acts 2 verse 4 and is the seal of the
[1:06] Holy Ghost that we Gentiles must receive
[1:10] today right now according to Ephesians 4
[1:13] verse 30 and John 3 verse 7 so in
[1:18] Revelation 14 the Jewish people who were
[1:21] previously blinded to receiving Christ
[1:24] as their Messiah are now able to see him
[1:27] as their Savior and are born again by
[1:29] the Holy Ghost
[1:32] note that the father's name in the
[1:34] forehead is a contrast to the horse
[1:37] forehead which is Old Testament language
[1:40] mentioned in Jeremiah chapter 3 verses 1
[1:43] to 15 which is a bold defiant face that
[1:46] refuses to be ashamed of sin the mother
[1:49] harlot of Revelation 17 has this
[1:53] forehead in the New Testament
[1:54] just as a refuses to be ashamed of
[1:57] her sin the true Jewish church is a
[2:00] woman who is boldly in love with Christ
[2:02] and refuses to be ashamed of the gospel
[2:05] of Jesus today the New Testament church
[2:09] called Jesus's bride has this seal in
[2:12] her soul and so will the 144,000
[2:16] born-again Israelis recall from 1st
[2:19] Thessalonians 5:23 that man has three
[2:22] parts to his being a body human spirit
[2:26] and soul the human spirit is renewed day
[2:30] by day
[2:31] according to Ephesians 4:23 and 2nd
[2:34] Corinthians chapter 4 verse 16 so the
[2:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost has to be in
[2:39] the soul of man Christians today are
[2:43] sealed in their soul because jesus said
[2:45] he would send a rest for your soul
[2:48] according to Matthew 11 verse 29 the
[2:52] three angels of verses 6 through 12
[2:55] seem to be symbols of human messengers
[2:57] or preachers because verse 6 says this
[3:00] angel preaches the everlasting gospel
[3:02] and we know that God does not send
[3:04] heavenly angels to preach and save souls
[3:07] but rather men who are anointed of the
[3:10] Holy Ghost are often called angels it
[3:12] seems these angels are human messengers
[3:15] because we have already seen God call
[3:16] men angels in Revelation chapters 1 2
[3:19] and 3 along with numerous other
[3:21] scriptures galatians 4:14 first samuel
[3:25] 29 verse 9 ii samuel 1927 and revelation
[3:30] 22 verses 8 and 9 these three angels
[3:34] seem to be the final three church age
[3:36] messengers to the Sardis age the
[3:39] Philadelphian age and the Laodicean age
[3:41] which are Martin Luther John Wesley and
[3:44] William Branham respectively the Saints
[3:49] that keep the commandments of God and
[3:51] the faith of Jesus is a phrase used to
[3:53] reveal that this group believes both the
[3:55] Old Testament and the New Testament and
[3:58] recognize Jesus Christ as the Messiah
[4:00] that was sent to the Jews but was
[4:03] rejected and then received by the
[4:05] Gentiles a similar phrase is used to
[4:07] describe believers who believe Jesus
[4:10] Christ is the Messiah promised in the
[4:12] Old Testament and have now received his
[4:14] Holy Spirit in the New Testament as
[4:16] ta'en revelation 1 verse 2 revelation 1
[4:20] verse 9 Revelation chapter 6 verse 9 and
[4:23] Revelation chapter 12 verse 17 the
[4:28] harvest of the earth is a symbol of
[4:30] Christ gathering two separate groups to
[4:33] two separate locations at the end of the
[4:35] world according to Matthew 13 verses 38
[4:38] through 40 one group is the wheat or
[4:40] true believers who lived righteously and
[4:43] will be gathered to the kingdom of their
[4:45] father which is with Jesus at the
[4:47] marriage supper of the lamb and then to
[4:49] reign with Christ in the 1,000 year
[4:51] earthly millennial reign the other group
[4:54] is to
[4:55] the unbelievers who do wickedly and will
[4:58] be gathered to the furnace or fire or
[5:00] hell in the heart of the earth to await
[5:03] their judgment at the white throne
[5:05] judgment the winepress of the wrath of
[5:09] God is a symbol of the slaying of the
[5:11] sinners who took the mark of the beast
[5:13] and worshipped His image at the Battle
[5:16] of Armageddon because verse 20 says
[5:18] there is blood that comes out of the
[5:21] winepress the Battle of Armageddon is
[5:24] also seen in two other portions in the
[5:26] book of Revelation revelation 19 verses
[5:29] 11 to 21 and revelation 16 verse 16
[5:33] which tells us the Battle of Armageddon
[5:35] is a gathering of those unbelievers who
[5:38] took the mark of the beast in defiance
[5:41] against Jesus Christ and his followers
[5:44] revelation 19:11 221 tells us that this
[5:48] battle is Christ taking these
[5:50] unbelievers through the winepress
[5:52] according to revelation 19:15 and it
[5:55] tells us how the slaying takes place the
[5:58] sword or word that proceeds out of Jesus
[6:01] Christ's mouth smites these beasts
[6:04] worshippers and then the birds or fowls
[6:07] of the skies of the heavens will be
[6:09] filled with their flesh the timing of
[6:14] events is as follows it seems that
[6:16] chronologically the messages of the last
[6:19] three angels in verses 6 to 12 seems to
[6:22] come first because God is still dealing
[6:24] with the Gentiles every nation kindred
[6:27] tongue and people according to chapter
[6:30] 14 verse 6 and letting them hear the
[6:33] preaching of the everlasting gospel
[6:37] recall that God will only move on to
[6:40] dealing with the Jews until every
[6:41] Gentile believer is sealed into the
[6:43] kingdom of God according to Luke 21
[6:46] verse 24 and Romans 11:25 the next event
[6:52] chronologically would be the scene of
[6:54] the Lamb and the 144,000 on Mount Zion
[6:57] which is seen in verses one through five
[7:00] Christ will most certainly first redeem
[7:03] these 144,000 since they are called
[7:06] firstfruits in chapter fourteen verse
[7:08] four before he destroys all the rest of
[7:11] the men and women on the earth the beast
[7:13] worshippers which is what we see in
[7:15] verses 13 through 20 in this chapter the
[7:19] Battle of Armageddon in verses 13
[7:21] through 20 will be the last event before
[7:23] the 1000 year millennial reign of peace
[7:26] upon the earth for all evil men
[7:28] including all earthly leaders will be
[7:30] slain and then the kingdom of Christ
[7:33] will reign upon the earth for 1,000
[7:35] years or the Lord's Day with Christ
[7:37] ruling nations with a rod of iron a
[7:39] corner Revelation 19 verse 18 if you
