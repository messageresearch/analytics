TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] to either follow the word of God every word that you say to be true but they don't they don't believe in their own actions prove that they don't [Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to continue the series on 24 Lies coming out of Branham Tabernacle in this video we'll cover lies number two and three and there's no specific order of these lies I'll just bring them out as clear as I can by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ again these videos are made with brotherly love and kindness towards everyone who considers Branham Tabernacle their home church just as I expressed in part one of this series before getting into the second and third lie out of Branham Tabernacle let me just read this quote and then we'll listen to it from Brother Branham it's from influences 1964 a minister was trying to tell brother Branham that it wasn't his duty to preach against sin but brother Branham said if the pastors weren't doing it then he had to let his voice cry out against it so the same is true today if some message passes around the world will not call out the sins that Brenham Tabernacle is propagating the lies that they're propagating then I've got to be one of those voices to crowd against it let's listen to the quote [Music] so let's begin with a second lie coming onto Brandon Tabernacle the LIE is all answers are on the tapes because brother Adam's words cannot fail of course this is a lie it is idolatry to make brother Branham possessor of every answer which essentially makes brother random equal to God so we have two witnesses of this first we'll watch a video where the leadership at Branham Tabernacle says this and he doesn't say all the answers but then later in a blog post he says the tapes have all the answers so let's watch the video first he revealed it to his profit do we believe everything that the prophet said the prophet of God told us he said if you have any questions he said the answer is on the tape that's not my words that's his word and his word cannot fail amen amen now let's listen to a quote from brother Brandon where he says he doesn't know all the answers and we'll listen to these quotes back to back listen to the LIE coming out of random Tabernacle and then we'll listen to brother Brandon tell the truth that he doesn't have all the answers let's listen to both quotes back to back hey his word cannot fail ing to the opening of The Fifth Fifth seal Moses and Elijah have had to die what about Enoch I don't know if I don't know I don't know I don't I don't know all the answers about that I don't know and if I don't know I will tell you I don't know if I do know I won't tell you till I do no see myself here's the second witness where Branham Tabernacle claims the tapes have all the answers this is from their blog post from September 23rd 2020 random Tabernacles pastor says quote dear bride whatever we have need of along this life's journey this message provides for us and answers all our questions truly it is our compass that points us to our North Star end quote so again Branham Tabernacles pastor says this message provides for us and answers all our questions now let's listen to brother random say again he doesn't have all the answers what about Enoch I don't know if I don't go on it's okay I don't know I see right I don't I don't know all the answers about that I don't know to further prove brother Brown did not have all the answers he even stated specifically in why I'm against organized religion in 1962 that any Prophet who says he has all the answers is not a prophet and in particular brother Branham is speaking of prophets in the prayer lines who can discern every situation and brother Rams says this is not the nature of God so clearly Brenham Tabernacle is going against the very nature of God by claiming that the tapes have all the answers as brother Ram tells us God doesn't send anyone with all the answers even our Lord Jesus Christ didn't know the day and hour of the Rapture as he said in Matthew 24. only the father knows that answer so let's listen to the quotes back to back we'll listen to Brighton Tabernacles pastor and then we'll listen to brother Branham tell the truth his word cannot fail that's got all the answers to every gimmick that you can bring up remember he's not a prophet amen today they've got to know everything when you're going to have a toothache when you're going to have a tummy ache and everything else and tell you all about it that isn't the nature of our God watch the prophets watch Jesus before moving on to the third lie let's listen to this quote from the smyrnan church age from the church age book brother Brown showed how each Revival produced real Believers but then each move of God eventually denominated and the Holy Spirit left that movement or the ram noticed each denomination said they could prove that they now have all the truth and know all the answers so the very fact that Branham Tabernacle is claiming that the tapes have all the answers shows they have the spirit of organization and not the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and again we'll play it back to back we'll play the leader of random Tabernacle saying they have the answers and then brother Brown's own church age book saying they don't have all the answers poured out his Spirit upon Baptists methodists nazarenes Adventists Presbyterians Brethren Church of God several so named Etc all these Brethren were brought up on different doctrines bylaws Church manuals Etc God swept it all to one side he destroyed their dispensational theories and restored the gifts of the Spirit proving he is the same yesterday and today and forever but did those Pentecostals learn their lesson about Organization no sir they organized right back and have written their own textbooks bylaws and church manual Fellowship book Etc with one idea in mind which is to prove that they now have all the truth know all the answers and for the elite of God who know the way and can show it unto others as God's appointed guides they haven't got it hybridized themselves like the very groups they came out of if they want to be in the bride they are going to have to come out exactly as did their forefathers the third lie coming out of Branham Tabernacle is that they teach their believer should unquestionably believe every word on brother Ram's tapes even if brother bran lied essentially saying don't have your spiritual guard up in other words don't use a thinking man's filter which is the word of God and don't use the gift of discernment of course this is a lie it again encourages idolatry of William Branham and also encourages all the tape church people and press play people to open themselves up to evil spirits according to brother Branham so let's listen to brainum Tabernacle leadership say this that they unquestionably believe every word on the tapes even if brother Brown told a lie and then right after that we'll hear Brother Branham say we cannot just let our mind go blank now and brother random said person coming to Christ should come with all the intelligence they got he said keep your mind alert when you come to Christ let's listen to the quotes we can just sit and relax and just enjoy what we're hearing it doesn't matter we don't have to have our guard up you don't have to do nothing except for saying amen amen he says the bride says Amen to every word what did that angel of the Lord say get the people to believe you so when they're trying to make you doubt well the prophet didn't say this and didn't say this and he made a mistake here made a mistake here I don't care if it's a bare-paced life the world can prove it I believe it the angel said get the people and believe what you said amen we believe it [Applause] now you deny the very commission by saying that he didn't say what the end of the Lord get to people to believe you amen so we don't care what says on them tapes we believe it I don't have to explain it I don't have to understand it I just got to believe it amen [Applause] experience [Music] when you do that you just open your soul to Satan he'll give you something that's true but I think a person coming to Christ should come with all the intelligence thank God according in their mind when they come to him every promise in the scripture your mind alert when you come to Christ don't let it go blank the devil will make you do anything see they'll give you a sensation he can do that too but you want an experience something that the Bible teaches something that's real here's another quote from Brother Branham and he cares do you care 1963 brother Brown said I've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to so let's play these quotes back to back Brenham tabernacle's leader saying you could say Amen to every word believe every word and yet brother Branham says be careful what you're listening to because there's so much of it that is just the Human Side let's listen to the quotes we can just sit back and relax and just enjoy what we're guard up you don't have to do nothing except for saying amen amen amen so we don't care what says on them tapes we believe it I don't have to explain it I don't have to understand it I just got to believe it amen [Applause] did you just announce there there would be this happening now see I've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to I think there's so much of it that it's just the human side but always if there is something that goes forth it will speak it it's thus saith the Lord even divisions or anything that and that's reason I say that not that there is any uh any prophecy concerning and I have nothing on it from the Lord and be you sure now if I say anything from the Lord like that to tell you it's always I'm speaking now but when he speaks I say it's not me it's thus saith the Lord and I can't say it until he tells me I could be all together wrong am I thought about Martin Luther King I don't know I can't say if that's just my opinion anything here's the second witness from Branham Tabernacles blog post this is from October 23rd 2021 the pastor wrote quote dear stimulated bride there's nothing like the sheer Joy of knowing you're listening to the pure Vindicated voice of God no need to have your guard up no need to wonder does this line up with the word is that his thoughts or his interpretation I've got to go check it with the word not us we just sit back relax and say Amen to every word as we know everything we're hearing is thus say the Lord end quote So based upon this blog post the Pastor said not us we don't have to go check it with the word so let's hear where brother random said prove All Things by the word of God and every teaching every Doctrine must be proven by the scriptures says the scripture is always right and only way you can do anything is to the scripture is that true I would like to hear you say Amen when you believe it you see amen means so be it now [Music] [Music] the same thing because we cannot believe scripture everybody created a mass of two three witnesses that every word they established now here is the time that everything that I've said has got to be proven to be right or wrong in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing by the grace of God we've now seen three Lies coming out of Branham Tabernacle and they're easily refuted or debunked by the word of God and quotes from Brother Branham himself let's pray for the leadership in Branham Tabernacle and all the followers of the press play tape Church movement this false movement this man-made denomination let's pray for them to repent and come to the truth father God again I come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and with all humility and love I pray for random Tabernacles leadership and all the members God that they could humble themselves and receive the spirit of Truth and understand their believing so many lies Lord Jesus be kind be merciful be gracious Lord God and I pray God all those who want the truth could be drawn out from these lies and receive the truth by the power of the Holy Spirit I asked this with the love of Christ in my heart I pray you be merciful save all those who can be saved for the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ and I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music]
