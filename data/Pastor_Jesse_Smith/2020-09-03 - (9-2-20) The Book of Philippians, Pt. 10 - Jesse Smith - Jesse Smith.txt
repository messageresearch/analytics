lot so anyways we're thankful and heard back from brother ray he sends his greetings uh he didn't respond why he hasn't been coming but he said god bless all the saints and everything so thanks for asking about him and he said god bless it he said peace he said god's peace and shalom to everybody by the grace of god so happy to hear from him also the air conditioning is officially broken they

gives us strength and i'm refreshing thank you for those songs and everybody doing the lyrics there sister thank you everybody's worship i appreciate that feeling refreshed amen philippians i'm sorry yeah uh yeah philippians 3 please philippians 3. i just felt led i was kind of thinking about going back to here and i'd like to look at philippians chapter three tonight i just you know i'm just moved by this book and just the thought that this scripture is thus saith the lord imagine that god would have a man write a letter from a prison to just a little lonely church you know out in the city and it would be thus saith the lord to you and i just amazing thought there just a deep thought how we should uh cherish and reverence you know god's word to us praise god just how humble this this is this is eternal life on the pages praise god we can receive a portion of that tonight the blessings of it amen so let's read philippians 3 verse 1. let's read this together uh 3 verse 1 and then read our memory verse here just the first verse philippians 3 verse 1 on 3 1 2 3 finally my brethren rejoice in the lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe praise god let's go to our next scripture matthew 6 30. praise god matthew 6 30 let's read 30 down to 34 on 3 1 2 3 wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith all shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof may god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated praise god sorry i'm a little bit emotional here tonight it's a bit hard to speak when i got stuff running down my nose here so let's uh let's get to the word of god it's so wonderful to be in the house of the lord praise the lord so we're coming here to the next chapter here in uh the philippians i'm gonna use schofield's uh headlines real quick just to review uh chapter one was we began with christ the believer of spiritual life rejoicing in spite of their suffering and then in verse 8 he went joy triumphing over suffering praise god as paul was suffering in the prison but yet he was grateful that all the prisoners got to hear the gospel praise god through his life and though uh though people bash paul though people a lot of spoke evil about paul a lot of people did speak evil paul yet he said whether christ is preached the right way or the wrong way he said still christ is preached amen amen and then in chapter two uh he started going into christ the believer's pattern rejoicing in lowly service and we saw how paul said we should all have the same mind this mind of a servant and jesus christ is the example let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus praise god how many got that attitude tonight that i'm just a servant of the lord amen and lord you can do whatever you want with me because i'm just a servant amen i'm not higher than you i'm not the boss i'm not telling you what to do i'm here to do what you want to do praise god that's our attitude that's the mind of christ he humbled himself to become a servant and that's the same mind that we must have humbling ourself becoming obedient to uh sufferings as we'll look at tonight we eventually get to that tonight and then after paul said he was christ was so humble that god highly exalted him he said now he said work out your salvation with fear and trembling amen because god is working in you his good pleasure and he said do not murmur he said be blameless harmless the sons of god hold forth the word of life praise god he said if i be offered upon the sacrifice he said i joy and i rejoice with you all he said he said i'm going to rejoice that i i'm making my life a sacrifice for you you know church sometimes we forget how important that is like beatrice is making a sacrifice i just looked at her she left her husband right just physically and she left her family so she can serve this family that's a sacrifice right sister it's hard right being away from hubby and family think of all her friends that she was with all those years i'm just trying to bring this down to a very simple way that we can understand it because we always see old preachers they make sacrifices but church we make sacrifices all the time in just simple ways right think about what even mothers and fathers how you sacrifice and you serve other people you know this world is going to be a lot of them are going to be condemned because they had abortions right they didn't want to serve their children they want to serve families and uh a lot of people a lot of young people speak evil their parents they don't take care of their parents right they send them off to the now sometimes they have to sometimes they just can't physically take care of their parents as they age but think about how you can make yourself a sacrifice how are you making a sacrifice even like amen huh they can serve their in-laws right they think about you know making meals or paying their bills you know think about that just think you're serving other people i'm just trying to use some simple examples uh that's that's what christianity is all about so let's not forget these simple ways they seem simple but really in god's eyes they're a well-pleasing sacrifice to his great name amen that's what paul says he said i am giving my life as a sacrifice i am offered on the sacrifice for you praise god amen and let's do that tonight praise god let's see let's see our lives as i'm giving my life as a sacrifice for christ and let me god show me if if i got discouraged if i got you know upset if i got down uh if i got angry show me again a a in a fresh man or show renew transform my mind that i can see how i'm supposed to have an attitude of a servant so i can be offered on the altar of a sacrifice for god amen praise god hallelujah it's encouraging for me to know we have a small church but i'm encouraged to know that there's little people all around the world that are being encouraged by our little sacrifice tonight amen they love singing along with our worship they love hearing the preaching they're you know we're here to help this group but it's nice through technology praise god we can help a few people around the world you know encourage them in the faith praise god we're happy to do that it's our pleasure uh to serve the purpose of god amen and paul then we saw how paul uh said i sent timothy to you and finishing chapter two he was like-minded see this book's all about the mind uh having the right mindset winning the greatest battle ever fought praise god and then he says how epiphanitis you know he was sick but god healed him and had mercy on him and i had mercy on paul and he healed his friend praise god that's what i'm asking god for tonight mercy on my dad praise god to give me some more joy that god would heal my father praise god i'm asking god for his grace and i believe i just trusted and believe me with that all that mustard grade seen faith i have that god will do it uh for god is good amen amen now let's begin chapter three just a quick review there now he says finally my brethren rejoice in the lord he said uh to write the same things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe let's look at a few of these words now finally paul says finally and he's only halfway through the book it's only four chapters but he finishes the first two chapters and now he's starting so he's like if he broke it in two pieces right the first one is let them know how he's doing and tell him to be servants and now he breaks into this last book or this last section of his letter now of course it wasn't in chapters i think until about the 1800s or 1600s i can't forget i keep forgetting which year it was put in chapters but he could see i'm naturally going to break this letter into two parts and now he begins uh this idea and he's going to break into warning them in just a moment and you're going to see how uh that he warns him now remember what is his greatest desire church his greatest desire is that everybody can think the same way he just says that remember he said it eight times have the same mind be like-minded right uh remember naomi's memory verse is in chapter four right you think on these things right uh meditate on them and the peace of god will keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus it's all about the mind paul paul's telling these persecuted saints in philippi keep your mind on god amen praise god keep your mind on heavenly things amen and so he breaks in this this next part and he's going to start breaking them or teaching them about warnings they said i'm warning you now this is just interesting the experience i just it's kind of hard to understand but i was thinking it's kind of like a roller coaster ride being a christian's like a roller coaster right like you know i i got johnny's text about the animals and i was like crying i was getting close to weeping and then you know not long after that i forget what news i heard but then i got joyful it's like you know just it's up and down now it's all holy right it's not it's not bad it's all holy emotion but it's up and down right it's constant rejoicing and then weeping and then and then it's just up and down constantly uh and and this is this is the the experience of a christian because the bible says you know as a body if the body's happy be happy for the body if the body's hurting hurt with the body in other words try to feel people's pain right try to feel their pain but also try to feel their joy as well praise god you know satan likes to make us a little jealous of people when they got victory right we'll hear about somebody you know god did a miracle you know like we saw in you guys as a uh healing last week if we're not careful say no you know say oh we'll see they got a miracle you don't but see the the reality is to cast down that line and say praise god amen god is working in the body amen amen maybe i'll be next praise god either way somebody's going to be next amen so see that that's the attitude of a christian you know we always rejoice whatever is happening in the body we rejoice with it and then other times you know we we sorrow with it it's quite a you know just to me it's quite a thing as a christian you know learning uh and church what does that take it takes sensitivity right you have to be sensitive to other people not just thinking about me me me what i'm going to do what i want to do but you know especially when people are sad you got to like enter into their sorrow you might have been happy and everything but i've you know we've seen at times where people you know they'll rebuke message people rebuke other people just for being sad but the bible says mourn with those who mourn right or vice versa like we said someone who's mourning they can't rejoice with somebody who's happy praise god so it just takes what a sensitivity it takes uh being led by the holy spirit praise god not being selfish right which we all got to battle every day not being selfish but being selfless and having the mind of christ now he says finally my brethren so he's beginning to kind of change to the end of the letter i like this finally my brethren what rejoice in the lord amen so it's just interesting and church there are eight times i think let me look it up or 10 times that he tells them to rejoice can i read them real quick would that be okay i just want to do rejoice and joy real quick in this book 14 times in this book in a short letter now what if what if i got what if you got 14 texts from me and they all said be happy rejoice what would you say like wow brother jesse really wants me to be happy he must be really happy paul writes one letter can you imagine or one email let's say i've said amen an email but 14 times i tell them rejoice brother amen have joy amen amen that's what paul says paul says remember in chapter 1 verse 4 i make all my requests with joy so he's praying constantly with joy in one verse 18 he said whether christ is preached i rejoice and i will rejoice no matter if it's in pretense or in truth he rejoices so rejoices that preaching is going on praise god in chapter 1 verse 25 he says it again i know i'll continue with your furtherance and joy of faith that you're rejoicing may be more abundant praise god so he was going to keep laboring so they could grow in rejoicing 14 times church and then chapter 2 he said fulfill my joy and be like-minded amen verse 16 holding forth the word of life and i may rejoice in the day of christ that's future rejoice right run the race and hold forth god's word and share god's word and testify of god's goodness amen he said and i will rejoice on the day of judgment praise god or perhaps the day when uh the day of christ maybe perhaps when we all get there and at the marriage suffer the lamb i'm not sure which exactly that day is and then he says verse 217 if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all so paul is finding joy with them in his sacrifice in other words when we come together and we have church let's all be happy praise god let's all rejoice amen he said because it's with you i rejoice with you praise god he said for this cause i do rejoice and he said and rejoice with me what do you think churchill uh well i won't i won't say that maybe i'll let me go up let me move on philippians 2 28 he said uh he sent timothy uh that when you see him again you may rejoice and then i may be less sorrowful i'm sorry that was epiphanitis okay so paul was going to rejoice when the saints saw his guest minister i said it was his little lower minister right he's the prophet and underneath him he had he had ministers so he said i'll rejoice when you receive the ministry praise god and then he says finally brethren rejoice in the lord now later on in verse 3 it says he says we're of the circumcision who rejoice in christ jesus so now he tells us why we can rejoice and where where does our rejoice lay it lays in christ and christ is the word amen glory that's why we read our bibles we should rejoice amen because christ is the word in verse chapter four verse one he said my brethren you're my joy and my crown see if at the very least we should have joy just by seeing one another here praise god amen because paul says you are my joy the church he started you know the church that he found remember he wasn't there long but of course it grew over time but he said you're my joy and my crown praise god then he says verse 4 or chapter 4 verse 4 rejoice in the lord sometimes and again i say rejoice did i say that right no rejoice in the lord always aren't you glad god he he gives us a high calling praise god he tells us not just sometimes all the time we do sometimes but god's saying your life will be better if you rejoice always amen and again i say rejoice that's the next one verse 10 and chapter four but i rejoiced in the lord greatly at your care for me so when paul got a gift he rejoiced we got a check in the mail from somebody that uh someone of our friends in another church in the message they just sent a nice little check in the mail i just rejoiced i almost started crying like wow they said we just want to bless you and thank you for being an example of godliness and all these things and i thought man i just makes me joy praise god that people see your testimony you know and there it is 14. can you believe that 14 times in one letter right or one email say it like that in one letter paul says have joy rejoice there's so many reasons to have joy there's so many reasons to rejoice let's choose to be joyful praise god amen more abundant joy praise god now let's look at back at verse one let's finish verse one to write the same things to you what the joy the rejoicing to me indeed is not grievous so it's not irksome so paul says this doesn't bother me to write this it's not a bother to me he says but for you it is safe which means firm or sure or steadfast okay so it's not grievous for me but for you you need it right it's firm it's it's solid you need this he said so 14 times if somebody tells you to rejoice i think you get the picture right right if somebody kept telling you you need to smile more you need to smile more you know you need to sing louder you need to if somebody told you something 14 times i think you get it after a while right you know so paul says he said you need this it's it's for you praise god now verse two now look he tells them rejoice and then he goes right into giving them warnings isn't that something we're supposed to be happy all the time but then watching all the time right see church we have to be so sensitive that we can go one moment rejoicing like i rejoice with the saints when i see everybody but as soon as i leave oh gotta be ready to battle yeah like recently one time i felt really foolish i'll just kind of tell a story of myself i was leaving church here i was so happy i forget what night it was it was it was this year sometime and i'm just driving and i thought i looked i'm driving out the parking lot here and i thought i looked and i did it and my wife's like jesse and i slammed on the brake and we almost got the car accident we were like a few inches to get away from a car accident i don't know if the kids remember that or not but i was just like all happy driveway we had such a good service and i didn't even realize the devil was right there he was taking advantage of my that was my fault but see the devil comes to steal kill and destroy and thank god my wife was aware see see if i get carried off and get too far in the flesh we don't even realize right that there's trouble you know how many people have you heard they've been in their cars in their driveways and hit their kids or because they're just in a hurry you know that happened to my grandpa you know i told you a story god raised my aunt from the dead she got ran over by my grandpa just in a hurry to get out of the driveway but yet we could be so happy or we just got like the bible said we got to walk lightly we got to be aware of what's going on praise god but isn't that something he said rejoice and then now he says beware right isn't that an amazing church just think about it he said rejoice in the lord now you beware of what dogs he says there was nothing lower to a jew well i guess the pig was pretty low too right the pig was pretty low because they were so unclean so i guess i'll say like that there was few things as low as a dog and a pig right to a jew because they were so evil remember jesus said he told that seraph syrophoenicia woman he said the dogs he said you're a dog and she said you're right i am a dog he said the gospel was sent to the lost sheep or the house of israel so jesus was calling jews sheep and gentiles dogs in other words dogs are killers right dogs are dirty the peter says the dog will return to its vomit i don't want to describe that too much right you see somebody they leave sin and then they go back that's dog behavior this dog they're dirty they're filthy right dog's mouths are some of the dirtiest mouths of all animals that's why when people kiss and lick dogs you gotta wonder what are they thinking but maybe they take a shower afterwards or something i don't know but they're filthy they're i mean they carry lots of germs a few things as low as dogs and paul says rejoice and he says beware of dogs beware of evil workers so now we know what dogs are there are people who do evil works he says uh beware of the concision that we means mutilation right dogs rip and tear and kill well we just saw it with the bland family right with turkeys and chickens paul says rejoice in the lord be happy rejoice but beware there's dogs trying to rip and and bite you they're trying to cut the people of god because what are we we're sheep paul said we're delivered to the slaughter all day long quite a picture but do we trust our shepherd you better believe it amen we've got a chief shepherd amen i'm not talking about me i'm nothing right we are the god shepherd jesus amen i'm a miner very small miner the smallest pebble on the beach miner but jesus christ he's the rock amen he's the eternal rock the rock on which everyone else stands amen amen he's our rock and our comfort our strength so beware of those who want to destroy you remember he's telling me servants he said have the same mind serve god just be have this have this mindset but be careful something's trying to cut you be careful the devil's out there trying to kill steal and destroy so how many uh how many uh believe that that if the holy spirit was giving warnings in that day how many believe he'll give warnings today too some sermons are going to be warning sermons right they're going to be warnings and if the people don't take heed then you have to suffer the consequences right you see it many times that people won't humble themselves or repent their lives go into utter debauchery right or worldliness or chaos if they won't take heed to the word of the lord remember it's god's love church god's love that gives us warnings thank god oh my i want you to see here straight rejoicing is so important because the bible says the joy of the lord is our strength she says be strong but dogs are coming at you be strong be strong sheep praise god in other words stay close to the shepherd amen hallelujah because you know satan likes to attack when we're discouraged or down or we separate ourselves from the flock right don't win a fellowship don't want to talk to anybody don't want to be by it i want to talk to anybody about god when the sheep get separated that's when satan loves to attack loves to divide the fold right he says beware but what about all that joy the joy's going to give you strength praise god now look paul name calls you believe godly men call names sometimes yeah yeah brood of brood of serpents john the baptist said generation of snakes jesus said here he calls them dogs they sometimes preachers don't mince words praise god and what is it for it's to give the warning to give the warning god's love gives warnings but satan wants to mutilate or cut or attack god's sheep through what brother jess chapter 3. i'm sorry verse three yeah chapter three verse three verse three is what i meant to say for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh now look three things that separate us from legalists right and we know they're in the message they'll make anything legalistic to make themselves more holy but in this case they were battling circumcision paul says the dogs are the jews in this case that we're trying to tell them you're not it's good not good enough to be saved by grace you have to follow uh our man-made commands and paul says no these are dogs that are going to ruin your relationship with god he said but we are in other words we're the true jews praise god just like esther amen everybody thought she was a gentile but she was a jew praise god we're the we are the ones that are circumcised amen hallelujah we're the ones that that have the covenant with abraham's seed hallelujah we're the ones that got it how do you know brother jesse because the bible said we worship god in the holy spirit praise god and where there's a spirit there's liberty praise god church you've got all the liberty to shout and praise god and cry and weep and prophesy and speak in tongues and pray for the sick we got all the liberty we want here praise god just got to be led by the holy spirit hallelujah so we just wait on god's stopping until we do it we got all the liberty we want oh oh god's leadership uh when it's when it's time to do it that's when you do it praise god right and usually that's after the preaching right any any leadership of the holy spirit usually it's after the preaching usually not always right sometimes god can stop a service short and just go right into prayer for the sick or something like that so we don't want to limit the holy spirit but we want to recognize that we have the liberty of god thank the lord i appreciate the liberty of the holy spirit praise god so why are we true jews well we're circumcised from the things of the world we worship god in the holy spirit we rejoice in christ jesus and he is the word hallelujah and we have no confidence in our flesh in other words we don't uh we don't get excited about things our flesh can do that uh that make us seem like we're better than others right because that's what they were doing they were saying well look i've been circumcised so i'm better than everybody else look look at what i've done and paul's saying that's that you did that he's saying but look what god did in me praise god anybody with a knife can do what you've got but only people who let jesus into their soul can get what i've got amen amen that's the difference see legalists they always have something they can do that they think makes them more holy but paul's saying that that's a man-made righteousness right anybody can do that on their own but what god does is is supernatural it's an inward word praise god it's a supernatural character work that christ does and that's the real value of a christian praise god the inward things when god changes your desires and your passions and your behaviors and your habits amen and it's all based upon god's mercy and his love amen amen that's what we rejoice that's what we got confidence in what he got compensated brother jesse that god took the desire for cigarettes out of my life praise god i didn't work my way into it and beat myself up or anything like that god took it away praise god amen by faith he took it away hallelujah just little things just you know think about things like that even the way i dress you know the way our sisters dress is a good example if they're doing it with their ability then it's their righteousness but if they let god do it and god gave them desire and god took out the desire for them to be worldly and now they want to present themselves holy and not cause men to stumble and glorify god and to redirect all the attention to christ then that's christ righteousness i didn't hear you praise god and yet like i said my flesh still wants to smoke all the time but i never have after god took it out of my life see because i'm winning the battle i'm winning the greatest battle that was ever fought i'm becoming minded like christ i have the mind of christ amen shall i shall i continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid amen it doesn't magnify grace when i sin it cheapens grace it fails grace but when i lean upon his ability and his obedience to the holy spirit then that glorifies god and it magnifies grace amen amen yeah i'll fight every day for it but it's worth the fight praise god that's what i am i'm a fighter praise the lord honestly i am a fighter i'm a soldier of the cross praise that's what soldiers do they fight praise god i'm a lamb but i'm a soldier by they man think about that lambs that fight there's all these different illustrations that we are we're lambs killed all day but then we're soldiers then we're shep i'm a shepherd you know watching over the sheep there there's so many different roles that we fulfill praise god as christians oh my beautiful so we don't put confidence in our flesh things that we can do and this example is of course circumcision paul gives other examples remember the liberties like holy days well you know on easter i always do this and this and this and on christmas i always do this that's fine you know i i fast every christmas and no one else in the church does well look how holy i am yeah that's yeah if you're fast and you're led of the holy spirit well then it's not it's not your glory it's god leading you to do something for him praise god it's not your credit it's god's credit amen see these are all areas where you know legalism slip this is where satan tried that's where that dog tries to slip in right those dogs those evil workers they try to slip in and take away uh from christ's righteousness and try to promote your own righteousness three things church we worship in the spirit the holy spirit we have the freedom of the holy spirit we rejoice in christ we don't get excited about man's creeds we get excited about the living god amen praise god when god does something great and we know it was god that's when we rejoice amen we don't get rejoiced we don't rejoice in our righteousness or anything we can do we rejoice in what god has done because god has been so good to us amen amen and he keeps showing himself alive amen he keeps showing himself answering prayers and his faithfulness and his provision and for all that we give god glory we rejoice in what christ jesus does not us because there's nothing i can do anyway praise god that would do anything good it's so refreshing to go back and see what paul said in it oh bye no confidence in the flesh look at verse four so now he he starts getting into the the example of himself so now he says if anybody could have been a dog he said it could have been me now he was right he literally spiritually was a dog because he was he was holding the coat for stephen to be killed right he was arresting christians and taking them to jail who knows if any died under his care i don't know who knows if any died once they got in prison we don't know but he was polling christians trying to get them to blaspheme the unforgivable sin and trying to take them to jail so paul knows what a dog is he used to be anointed with that wrong spirit right verse four though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath aware of he might trust in the flesh i more now this is awesome paul's saying if anybody could have trusted in their flesh it would have been me now look at this god took the most legalistic zealous of all the religious people the worst of the i'll say like this the worst of the worst who like it was all about me and what i can do and keeping my body and uh you know and now we all want discipline right but paul was taking it to the wrong he was doing it for himself he was he had confidence in his flesh god took the one who was most interested in trusting in himself and god humbled him in order to show him the the that what god can do god can take the person who trusts in his flesh and make him the one who trusts in the holy spirit more than anything else praise god hallelujah and so nobody nobody can say they had a harder battle than paul paul had the hardest battle he said because if anybody was tempted to to be a legalist it was me and i was the best legalist oh goodness so god takes the legalists who work the hardest he said i'm gonna make you not trust in your flesh i'm gonna i'm gonna put weakness in your flesh right remember god god told the demon okay buffeting devil yes go down and torment paul's eyes go ahead to keep him humble first thing about that he's cried three times god take this devil away and jesus said you need it to keep you humble that's how that's how much this guy had physical strength he said i was the pharisee affair you know what a pharisee means separator he was so separated from the gentiles and that's the one god sent him to amen he thought he was so much better than that a bunch of holy unholy rollers look how great look how holy i am jesus said now you go preach to him praise god and if anybody can know grace it was paul praise god oh what a choice from god amen the man who trusted in his cleanness of his flesh sent to the unclean to tell them don't trust in your flesh get away from the things of the flesh and trust in the holy spirit stop feeding on the world and dirty things and feed on holy things what a choice if anybody could have bragged on their self-righteousness nobody could brag more than paul nobody was more self-righteous or legalistic than paul a church that'd be like me coming today and saying i'm so much better than brother amen i'm so much better than sister seldom so look what i did i did this anytime we brag and uh and think we're better than somebody else right anytime we do that we've got a legalistic spirit on us right because that's what legalism is it's confidence in your ability praise god let's not trust in our flesh right because i think we're all pretty much aware that our flesh fails often praise god bye oh i hate the flesh i was just can't wait to get a new body praise god can't wait to get a new body ah i just battle them all day long he said if anybody thought they could trust in the flesh i could trust more he was circumcised on the eighth day now there's a a commentator that says that was a rare thing in judaism the bible commanded boys to be circumcised on the eighth day but most didn't because of distance they would just say well next time we get to the temple they would do it but paul said i was circumcised on the eighth day i was a special separated boy my parents really believed the law of god most jews couldn't say that so they're bragging about circumcision and paul's like i was actually circumcised on the right day i'm not trusting that i'm trusting in the circumcision of the heart i don't know yeah that's a circumcision i'm trusting it when jesus took away my desire for the world and gave me desire for the righteousness of god amen that's a that's the circumcision i'm trusting in oh thank you lord he said of the stock of israel the tribe of benjamin that was saul right that was even king saul's stock there and hebrew of the hebrews he was the jewish message believer of all the message believers he was the cream of the crop we'd say oh my goodness as touching the law of pharisee a separativist he separated as much every every jot and tittle every little detail he was totally separate from gentiles concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless this is a man that studied and read the word of god day and night to make sure he was doing the right thing and this was all by his own ability church by his own ability i hope we can understand the difference now between our ability and god's love because remember remember first corinthians 13 you can give your body think about that you can give your body to be burned and not have love and it doesn't help you at all we've seen that a couple years ago there was some riot going on a couple years ago and some man set himself on fire burned himself i thought what cause was that what cause i don't remember the cause now it was such a small little to him it was great but i'm talking about and that wasn't worth your life the bible said you can give away all your goods and give them to the poor but if you don't have love it doesn't profit you anything so there must be a huge difference between you know being motivated and zealous for something there must be a difference between human motivation and the love of god and there is it's selfless agape means selfless right god's own love in other words i'm doing this not because uh i'm gonna get anything in return i'm doing this just because i love someone else just because i care about someone else i'm not gonna get any glory i'm not gonna get any uh hoopla i'm not gonna get uh there's not gonna be a facebook post about me you know i'm doing this all because i love jesus amen but paul did all this because he was zealous he thought it was right all of his own ability my look at verse 7 here so no man could have trusted more in the flesh no man could have been a better legalist than paul before we read that i'll just share one time uh one time i was talking with a brother and uh he was asking me what do you struggle with brother jesse and i said you're talking on the phone and i realized at that moment i'd struggle with being critical of other people in times of my life i battled that being critical like uh thinking i was better than other people yeah even since i've been in the message i'm you know i've had to repent at times and when he asked me that that's what came to me yeah there's times i get so zealous that i don't really mix it with much mercy and i've just seen it in my life now i'm just being honest with you i've there's been times i've been i've been really critical about people struggling with that and then years later i won't battle that for years years later i'll start battling that and i'm like i'll think wow mercy i think i was a little too harsh i don't think i had enough compassion so how many want to be open to being more compassionate praise god paul's balling out the dogs right he's but there's times he said there's things that i do he said oh wretched man that i am see how see i will go on me go on these crazy roller coaster rides sometimes we're so zealous we get a little too far and then we get humbled and paul says oh wretched man that i am but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ in church we can trust this if we really repent in our hearts and if if god and if we confess our sin and we truly are sorry then jesus cleanses us from all unrighteousness because we confess our sins and then we're careful the next time when we talk about a certain person or situation right i'm not the only one brother ram said a critical spirit haunted him there's times he was overly critical i mean we all have faults right we all have failures and troubles so verse seven but what things were gained to me those i counted loss for christ and there's 40 minutes ah that was 40 minutes already uh let me set it for 10. i'll finish up here verse 7. but what things were gained to me see all those things can be a gain to you look what i did look what i did i was born i was born in this family i was zealous for my denomination look what all the things i've done i i separated myself totally from anybody wouldn't even go out to talk to anybody i was so holy i just stayed in my house all day and prayed and passed it all day he said what things that were gained to me those i have counted loss for christ so thinking he was special because he was circumcised paul said i've lost that i'm not special because i was circumcised yay doubtless and i count all these things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord think about that how many people think they're special because they're born in a certain family oh i was born in the branham family or i'm born in the fiscal family now i'm not saying they do i'm born in the smith family i'll just use my family see people think we're just we're special because we're in family it don't have nothing to do with it right let's not be prideful let's not take confidence in our flesh let's have no confidence in our flesh and rely totally on the holy spirit praise god and do you all still believe this is our state of the lord you still believe it's worth god jesus given to the church for 2000 years you still think it's worth it you still think it's powerful and effective absolutely absolutely we can't trust in anything of our flesh of our ability we must trust in the righteousness of christ and walk by faith like we saw the just shall live by faith so when god's revealed something to you that's faith right he gives you assurance that it's right then you live by that the just shall live by faith he says i'm going back to verse 8. yay doubtless so without doubt i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord see just knowing him church just knowing christ the knowledge of him for whom i've suffered the loss of all things and you count them but done that i may win christ all right what a beautiful beautiful scripture here so paul lost everything he lost his previous church membership some of us have done the same some of us have lost homes you know roofs over our heads he suffered the loss of everything to win christ so look look he goes now to his free more agency right because he says i can win it well now that deals with his free more his own will right simon was talking about the sovereign will of god god that's true when we look at god's sovereign will that's what god is going to accomplish something but down here when we're on earth a lot of it is about understanding how to get our will to obey god's will like i'm not a robot just i'll do i just do whatever god wants me to do right we have our own choices and we got to make our own decisions but paul said i will suffer losing everything that i may win christ jesus amen hallelujah that word win means to acquire to gain to escape from evil to spare yourself from judgment to win someone over into the kingdom of god to gain one to fa to faith in christ to gain christ's favor and fellowship praise god amen hallelujah you don't give a fellowship to everybody praise god right go to a denomination of church sometime soon see what kind of spirit's there sister karen was telling me she said yeah that she goes she visits other churches you know with family she was saying yeah there's there's nice things there she said she just said on sunday she said but god's spirit is here praise god when was the last time you went well i know some families get to go some more than others it's been a couple years since i went right it's the fellowship the they don't enter into real intimacy praise god where god can really change their lives and speak to their lives and really sanctify them that's the main issue right god wants to justify them sanctify them and fill them with the holy ghost they never get that intimacy but we know him in the intimate ways praise god we know what his heart really desires amen not just a church membership but an everyday fellowship with him praise god where you open the door say yeah come on in jesus every room you can look in every room in my life you can look in you can look in my bedroom jesus you can look in my kitchen praise god you can look in my parlor my living room jesus you can look in my closets right jesus you can go through every room in my house see but the main thing he wants to sit down and have some fellowship praise god he wants to sup together he wants to feed you the word of god he wants to break the word of life right and feed us on his precious word so see church when we go through suffering we have to remember we're suffering we're losing things in the natural but we're gaining so much more in the spiritual praise god you might lose a few friendships here but i'll tell you god will give you way better friends if you stay true to god right i've seen that to be true over all these years i lost people that i thought my they're really they're my closest friends but god's given me way better friends the best friends you want to have praise god they can all agree on one thing jesus christ is lord he's the word he died for us he raised for us and he's coming back soon praise god and his word all of his word needs to be preached and it needs to be lived amen hallelujah praise god he said i count everything else dung anything i can do is dung it's any animal excrement any rubbish any worthless and detestable thing that's what you're that's what your flesh works are they're just dumb he said i count them lost i count them as done then i may win christ jesus praise god let me find a place to close here so winning christ is knowing him praise god winning christ is knowing christ i want to look at a few scriptures here i look at my notes i don't forget something here yeah let's go just go a couple more scriptures here verse 9 and be found in him where was paul found he wasn't found in the pharisee denomination his old church he wasn't found in legalism he was found in christ he was found in god's word for that hour i found in him and the i'm sorry and not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith so you have a righteousness that's by works by flesh but you also have the right righteousness which is by faith so let me just close with that righteousness by your works is something you can do that makes you feel holy but righteousness by faith is something god reveals to you that you do right that god leads you to do because faith is a revelation faith is a making known an unveiling of god's will and then you trust in that so whenever god reveals something to you and you obey it and you accept it it's god's righteousness in you praise god but when you just do it because you think you're holier like with christmas it's coming up here pretty soon you know the same thing on facebook you know they have more christmas battles on facebook coming up this year but that's one thing where people if they don't do it sometimes if they're not careful they feel like they're more holy right they think they're more holy because they don't put up a tree or they don't give a gift well if you think you're more holy because you do that the bible said that's a liberty that's great but don't exalt yourself above people that may do something like that i just got an email about what do you believe about christmas so i sent the guy the link i haven't heard back from him but it's a great balance so it's righteousness which is of god by faith what is righteousness it's the state of him who is righteous acceptable to god praise god it's integrity virtue the correct way of thinking and feeling the justice or the virtue which gives each is due praise god in other words you are acceptable in the sight of god with god's righteousness god accepts you and says that's my son that's my daughter that's my child praise god he said that's what i'm trusting in i don't have my own righteousness i only have the righteousness of christ but i've had to suffer the loss of everything in order to gain it let's stand to our feet praise god so as we stand musicians if you want to come by god's grace you can come so what is your righteousness based on tonight are you feeling righteous and accepted by god because of what your flesh can accomplish or do you feel god's righteousness where you see god reveal something to you and you obey it because you know it's his will praise god that's the kind of righteousness i want i want the same kind paul had where i i suffer the loss of everything i used to trust in but now i trust in the righteousness which is of god by faith in christ jesus praise god let's bow our heads here tonight i'm gonna say brother jesse pray for me that i'll trust in the holy spirit i'll trust in christ and not in my own flesh my hands are up i'm not actually looking [Music] around lord i believe in your people here tonight they said they still
