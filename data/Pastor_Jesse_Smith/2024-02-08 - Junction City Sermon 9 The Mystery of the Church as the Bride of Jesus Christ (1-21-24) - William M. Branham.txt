TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's good to be gathered here today by God's grace oh thank you sir I appreciate that it's nice to have that uh Ephesians chapter 5:32 so while you're turning there I want to greet everybody in the name of the Lord Jesus uh my wife is finally able to make it today um and my our two youngest Genevie is five and Zion is three so our two youngest were able to make it all the older ones you know they got to hold up the this the service there and uh uh they're in acon by God's grace so uh we're very glad to have my wife and U looking forward to some wonderful Fellowship today by God's grace amen hallelujah I've been keeping track brother irin this is the 10th time I preach for the Saints here by God's grace uh April 2nd was the first time I and wasn't it down here was it down here that's right I think I drew some yeah some chalk and everything up here I think we're back where we started by God's grace so uh this morning I'd like to preach on uh the Revelation God's Prophet brother Ram taught us that the church is the bride so I want to preach on the Bride of Jesus Christ um it's plainly taught through the scripture and uh we would like everybody to see this wonderful Revelation today you know I was raised in a Pentecostal Church somebody was a God church I never heard that we were the bride and then after uh uh after I went to college I went to a Baptist Church I never heard anything about the bride but when I heard this message I started hearing about the bride Hallelujah and I found it all these verses right in the Bible praise God you know this whole Crescendo or the the climax of all human history is Jesus snatching away his bride hallelujah amen before the wrath of God is poured out that's what this is all about that's why we get so excited for weddings don't we hallelujah amen we get so excited for weddings is just a day of uh pure joy it's two Souls being united together a new family unit has been formed but the reason it's so beautiful is because it's a prefigure of Jesus coming to get you and I one day Hallelujah that's why it's so beautiful it's the climax of all history by God's grace so Ephesians 5:32 this a very familiar text if you've ever you know read Ephesians 5 you know the the end of this chapter is about husbands and wives and how husbands should love like Christ and and wives should submit in all things like the church and so this is a uh this is a important text here's where the Bible calls this a mystery this is why most churches don't know that they can be the bride most churches don't know that because it's a mystery it's hid from them but you and I Know It by God's grace Hallelujah Ephesians 5:32 I like if we could all read that together it starts with this is a great mystery let's read read that ready this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated you know so I'm just going to review you know the first time I was here I preached on the mystery of God is finished I show you how brother Brandon fulfilled Revelation 10:7 then I preach on laying foundational Truth uh preached on tithes and offerings and other found foundational truths third time I preached on sound Doctrine versus doctrines of devils and it's so important to have the right Doctrine so important the Bible says if you have the right Doctrine you have both the father and the son Hallelujah that's in the book of uh 2 John 8 and9 so Doctrine is so important uh then I preach on the revelation of the Seven Seals that was June 15th then I preach on the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was two two weeks later two weeks after that I preached on music and worship and that's kind of have been a uh uh a controversy around some of our churches in The Last 5 Years so I'm I'm doing a teaching on that if you like more teaching on that let me know by God's grace we want to have the freedom of the Holy Spirit praise God brother said we have to have such a worship where the Holy Ghost can fall where it's an atmosphere of worship and people can be free in the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen hallelujah and brother Bram says wherever God is there's a lot of noise hallelujah praise God Amen so I like to get free and I like to like to enjoy my freedom as a Christian uh brother Ram says it's okay if you he said if you Pump Up the Music real loud and the people scream and dance and shout and then you turn off the music and everybody stops he said that's okay as long as the people live right Hallelujah so what's the main the main thing is live right Hallelujah some people are more emotional right some people like to shout anybody here like to shout anybody like to raise raise your hand yeah look at that see see now how many people don't like to shout now you don't have to raise your hand but maybe you're just more of a quiet person you're and what they call introvert is that what they call well I'm an extrovert When I Get Around Jesus or when I get around God's people I want to give brother irin a big hug and say glory to God Amen I Want to Be Free Hallelujah in the Holy Spirit and so we got to have the freedom to worship and then I preach on the anointed ones of the end times and how Satan cannot heal then I preach on the serpent seed and the last time I was here back in November I preached on the mystery of the godhead how many appreciate the message of the hour praise God I love it praise God this this uh message is my life I left everything I left all my friends my family my associates to follow this message and this is this message in other words the Bible scriptures God's fulfilling right now this is the focus of my life Hallelujah I pour I pour myself in this I preach sometimes three or four or five times a week I make podcasts I make YouTube videos I counsel people I take people's questions on every app my whole life centers around this message because it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever this is the message God is in right now praise God and that's what this is going to prove here this this uh preaching today is going to prove that uh by God's grace so we're at Ephesians 5:32 it's a great mystery concerning Christ and the church Hallelujah now um I want you to just remember that God Saves you based upon love I know some of you came out of the Amish movement and maybe the focus wasn't on love okay now where I come from there was a lot of talk about God's love I came out of the Pentecostal church and then a Baptist Church there was a lot of talk about love but it was almost too much love there wasn't enough teaching there wasn't enough warning right and so I think you know in our conversations it seemed like you know in some Amish communities there was it was too much fear there there wasn't enough love but I want you to know that Jesus loves you today amen hallelujah Ephesians 2:4 says but God who's rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us God has great love for you that's why he sent his word to you praise God that's why he sent Jesus to die for you he doesn't have just love he has great love hallelujah amen and remember Romans chapter 8 at the end Paul lists 17 things that cannot separate you from the love of God hallelujah Heights nor depths nor angels or principalities fear there's nothing nothing can separate you from the love of God hallelujah amen thank you Jesus but God is going to allow your love to be tested that's what this this life is a testing time amen amen that's right Hallelujah and yes you'll feel God's love other times it'll seem like God's love is far away but we have to know that God said he loves us with a great love Hallelujah absolutely amen so there's a great mystery which church the mystery is which church is the bride now there are some churches that believe they're the bride uh or they call them the elect elect just means chosen The Chosen Church The Chosen bride Hallelujah so which church is the true church brother Ram said the beauty of a church is the character of its people hallelujah so you know we we drove by a big church today and it's a big oh it's a big massive Church there uh and lots of cars coming in they got people directing traffic so whatever they're preaching it it it attracts lots of people but I guarantee you they're not preaching what we're preaching today they might believe they're the bride but who who's to decide who the bride is the Bible is to decide who the bride is amen the holy spirit will decide who the Bride of Jesus Christ is hallelujah and you'll know her by her character and character is your moral makeup all the decisions you make up on right and wrong that's your character Hallelujah I know we got some real good character in this room by God's grace because I've seen it for the 10 times I've been with you and the couple times you've come up to akan to see me by God's grace in our our church there's Godly character here hallelujah so the true bride of Christ will have the character of Christ it will be their obedience to the Bible right I think you told me you know in one of your Amish groups they had a they had a a separate book about an inch and a half thick of all the laws you have to obey that W in the Bible I'm sorry the the bride doesn't have to obey extra commands outside the Bible the bride's got to obey the Bible praise God is that right Jesus said the man lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and the Bible said it's a sin to add anything to God's word right amen hallelujah the Bible says in Proverbs 30: 5 and 6 every word of God is pure the Bible said add thou not unto his words lest he call you a liar on the day of judgment I don't want God to call me a liar I I want God to say Well done good and faithful servant you've been faithful with a very little now I'll make you a ruler over much praise God I just want to be true to this right here I don't want to add anything on to it I just want to be true to this right here and the church said amen so the true bride will be obedient to the Bible commands Hallelujah and we'll just uh hit some scriptures here now Jesus said every tree is known by its fruit so every and he was talking about false prophets right so every every Prophet whether true or false is known by their actions and so if if we had a genuine Prophet which we did William brandham then he would be known by his fruits Hallelujah and you look at brother bram's life he was a Godly dedicated Christian one time Church you know this he turned on a check for $1,500 now how many of you would do that the man tries to get you know he he was just so happy my wife got healed let me give you 1,500 he said no I don't want anything to do with that money now that that's character right there in 1963 brother told a story and he said the Assemblies of God said brother Bram we want to hire you and join our group he said we will fly you around the country rather than driving brother Bram had to drive he said we'll increase your income by five times listen to is your life worthy of the Gospel you'll hear brother M tell this story he said we'll give you your own plane we'll increase your money by five times think about how much money that you would have if your income went up five times he said well and we'll set up meetings in all the big cities he said you'll go preach to the up and UPS instead of these down and outs I'm glad to be a down and out praise hallelujah hallelujah praise God because God rebukes the prideful but he has Grace upon the humble Hallelujah so look look at the Devil saying I'll give you five times a mount I'll give you plane you'll go all the big churches he said if you'll just change a few things on your preaching brother and brother knew it was a trap he said and I knew it was Satan he says for instance what brother what do you want me to compromise on he said well if you could just you know stop preaching against women preachers and they said what else what else uh you know stop preaching that serpent seed and brother man said that's the killer remember that one that would break all the fellowship if somebody somebody don't like serpent seed that kills your friendship right there they don't want to talk to you anymore right he said anything else yeah you know that that you know you got to say tongues are the evidence of the Holy Ghost and uh and they said you know the water baptism you got to you know baptized in the father son Holy Ghost and brother man said I'm ashamed of you I I'm surprised a man like you that would call me a prophet would ask me to compromise on the thing that means more than life itself Hallelujah but said no I will not take your offer amen I'll turn on the money the popularity the pl the easier life I'll turn that down that's Christlike character hallelujah amen he said don't ask me to compromise on the thing that means more than life to me hallelujah amen I love that amen the more I listen to brother Ram the more I see Christlike character in his life amen hallelujah so church that ought to be a great lesson the one thing we should never compromise is on the word of God now see we have to judge the Bible said prove all things judge every tree we can judge every Church the Roman Catholic Church the Baptist the Presbyterian the Seven Day Adventist Jehovah's Witnesses we need to judge all the judge their fruit I think a brother called it one time we are fruit inspectors amen right right those of you who have uh yeah farms and harvest and everything like that don't you go out and inspect your fruit see what kind of harvest you got by God's grace that's what we do as as Christians we examine every group now we even do it in the message don't we brother Levi amen that's right fact right we got to judge because not all message our messag amen let me say this Martin Luther at the end of his life said I'll be I'll be happy if 10% of our baptisms actually stay with the truth that's the same that it happens in every generation just so you know not all message Believers are message Believers amen that's right Jesus had 70 preachers that left him 71 sorry Judas he only had 11 faithful ones and the church said amen 70 that means 70 men went 71 sorry 71 went out and spread all these other false doctrines they they called Jesus oh uh he he he's a false teacher cannibal that's the word there he's a cannibal he said oh you got to eat my flesh and drink my blood think about that 71 preachers went out and said he's a cannibal preacher but they didn't have the Revelation that's the same thing that's happened in brother R's Ministry amen he was a true man of God but we've had 71 go out and the Devils deceive them and they've loved the things of the world more than the word of God Amen that's right how do you know I judge their fruit that's right if they live live in sin if they lie if they tell false Doctrine false Doctrine is a leaven false Doctrine is a yeast amen and it corrupts the whole church the whole teaching but the Bible said we are in the Feast of Christ where we have unleavened bread Hallelujah that's right we have the word of God we have the preaching from the Bible with no leant brother Daniel Hallelujah we got unleavened word it's just word upon word upon word upon commandment Hallelujah and then there's life in the word of God the word of God is truth cuz Jesus is the way the truth and the life hallelujah amen hallelujah see I was raised in denomination so I saw their fruits growing up brother John there's this one guy and I was raised in a church where they said you got to speak in tongues and I was like I never agree with that but but there's one guy a young guy he's probably 15 or 20 he would speak in tongues like every time but then he would go in the church he would steal spoons from the church and go sell them he would like you know bend them and and yeah Simon and I Simon Cam and I saw that and we were just like I thought these guys spoke in tongues and were real they're thieves wow now they might have a gift to speak in tongues there's nothing wrong with speaking in tongues but if you have a gift but you don't live good Godly character it doesn't amount to nothing amen you can speak in tongues with uh men and angels He said but if you don't have love if you don't have love for the word of God love to obey the word of God it profits you nothing praise God Amen that's right and bless that little baby to to to sleep through my preaching there praise God God bless that little child there I don't know how they do that you would think all the screaming and shouting and clapping but yeah God gives them sweet peace amen but see that that's what I saw there and then when I went to the Baptist Church I mean they were good people they were a little deeper in the word of God than the Pentecostals but then they would watch dirty movies and some of the guys would say after church they say let me go hug these girls I want to hug them up and I want their their chest to press up against my chest I thought this this is what what this is what and and I was like I was so brother John the whole time I'm like there's got to be more there's got to be more and then the message came to me I knew there was more Hallelujah because the Bible said there's a deep call to the Deep hallelujah amen that's right if there's a deep call there's got to be a deep to respond Hallelujah that's right remember Simon prayed in the closet for three months God send me a message if there's a greater message send me the message and then the message came to brother Simon Hallelujah praise God Amen God had message Believers right in the factory where he worked there in Archbold Ohio brother Dave lell and brother Freddy uh Boer brother Craig Boer praise God see if there's a deep call if there's a deep desire to be the bride then there's a deep respond to it praise God Amen God is going to call out his bride Hallelujah now I'm way off my notes but praise the Lord anyhow praise God the Bible said prove all things hold fast that which is good try every Spirit whether they're the spirit of God that's how I know brother R's a prophet as well he was right on all of his major doctrines but he was still a man and brother random could be corrected did you know brother random said my wife is my correction did everybody know that he said you husbands know what I'm talking about I want to hear some husband say Amen my wife corrects me all the time things I'm thinking like I'll just say hey maybe I'll go to this she's like Jesse can't do that that's what brother said but said my wife is my correction see cuz he was a man but I love it he was so humble he could accept correction from his wife now of course she wasn't yelling at him screaming at him pounding pans brother brandom you got to do this you know she got to she got to keep her Christian character you know Hallelujah and there's one quote she said she said bill I didn't know you could be wrong on so many things and brother BR laughs and says you're right about that ma yeah I got got the quotes so in other words we we we we we we recognize brother Ram as a a true man of God by his prophecies by his healings by his discernment by his thus sayith the Lords those are all true but in another way at home he was a man as he traveled he was a man and he needed correction as well amen that's what I love about brother random Hallelujah I see the character of Christ brother R was so humble brother Ram said in one place he said you forget about me he said stop stop paying attention to the messenger he said you pay attention to the message amen that's right brother Brandon said if you put too much emphasis on the messenger God will take him off the scene and that's personally what I believe why God took him at just 56 years old think of that brother God took the prophet at 56 years old but God had to do it we we're reading that book called Generations you ever seen that book called Generations it written by Brother R's uh granddaughter George Smith's daughter is it Angel Angela yeah Angel Angela Smith she put together 38 testimonies of people that lived by brother brandham or knew brother brandham really well and some of these brothers were saying you know we leaned upon brother brandham for everything you know think about that every time you got a cough they would call Brother brand can you pray for my cough well where's your faith you know but that's what they said we leaned on brother Brown too much and then after he went off the scene we were kind of awesome where do we go where do we go to for prayer how about Jesus is that a good option now don't get me wrong it's okay to use a gift if someone has a gift of God like a prophet yes you want to go to the gift of God but see he said we focus too much on brother brandom we need to get back more to Jesus Hallelujah that's right see see people that that's just how humanity is Right Humanity just puts too much emphasis sometimes on a man and not enough not enough Focus or emphasis on Jesus Christ who sent the man Hallelujah but God has a way to correct his children Hallelujah now remember uh we try the spirits and remember John 16:13 the Holy Ghost will guide you into all truth I've seen that ever since I came in the message God is guiding us into more truth all the time because more and more heresies pop up in the message I'm not talking about Lutheran or Methodist I'm talking about message heresies more of them rise up but do we know they're heresies because they go against the word of God Amen that's right and they'll go against quotes from Brother brandom Hallelujah that's right that's how we know and I found God guiding us into more truth all the time Hallelujah now Jesus Christ himself said he is the bride okay let's go to Mark 2:19 Mark 2:19 now I'm going to try to preach today I'm I'm just going going to preach as long as I can here today by God's grace hope that's okay like brother said if you need to stand up and stretch your legs he says stand up and stret your legs I want you to see this through the Bible and I'll Trust to be a blessing Mark 2 19 and Jesus said unto them can the children of the Bride chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them so he calls himself I'm the husband I'm the bridegroom as long as they have the rroom with them they cannot fast but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days praise God so Jesus says I'm the husband Hallelujah is that is that plain to everybody can everybody see that all right now there's three Parables well here you know what while we're there let's go to John chapter 3 Mark uh Luke John Mark I'm sorry John 328 let's go to John 3:28 let's just go here brother brandom said the Holy Ghost will always direct you to the word can we all say the word the word the Holy Ghost will always direct you to the word of God on every question whether it's a question about brother Ram's life or question about the doctrine or the church or Miracles every question must go back to the word of God hallelujah brother Ram said if I die he said if I die in my tracks right now he said my absolute is the Bible amen amen Hallelujah there's one quote people misunderstand but brother R said he's doing questions and answers at his home church and he said it was just a men's meeting it was questions and answers 1963 it was uh December 26th right after Christmas and brother Bram said you Brethren you leaders in the church you kind of look to me as an absolute okay that's a quote people misunderstand and that becomes a heresy because now every word on brother Ram's tapes is thus say the Lord that's heresy absolutely he said you kind of look to me as an absolute but he wasn't saying I was the absolute because all the other quotes brother Daniel brother Bram says the Bible's the absolute amen and what brother Bram says you said in a church you can't have two heads a two-headed monster is a very dangerous thing right that's what brother R says he says you got to have one leader in a church and it's the pastor right and all the questions got to go back to one person for the answer that's how God set up the pastor is the shepherd over the flock the P Pastor the shepherd leads the flock and so brother Ram said you kind of look to me as your absolute but don't let anybody tell you brother brandham is the absolute brother Bram never said he was the absolute he said you Brothers kind of look to me to the absolute Hallelujah and there's so many times he said the Bible's the absolute God is the absolute the Holy Ghost is the absolute that's true praise God John 3:28 ye yourselves bear witness to me that I said I am not the Christ but that I am sent before him he that hath the bride there's the first time the bride is used there in the New Testament he that hath the bride is the bridegroom now this is John the Baptist so Jesus already said I'm the bridegroom and now John says the person that has the bride is the bridegroom so John says Jesus has a bride oh is that beautiful John the Baptist recognized the bride of Christ because he had the spirit of Elijah brother random comes he's got the spirit of Elijah and he points out the Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen in other words John the Baptist and brother R were both forerunners of the coming of Christ Hallelujah and both said Jesus Christ has a bride how many believe there in that bride today amen I believe it by God's grace every hand should be up praise God because you're within hearing of the true word of God today if you went to the the Pentecostal church or the Baptist you wouldn't hear the true word of God today you know a lot of them God bless sister Rachel how you doing good to see you did you get that book in the mail I did all right praise God you know you you you you'll hear Baptist and Pentecostals they'll talk about a national Revival and they'll think America's going to get a national Revival brother brand said it's thus sayith the Lord America's past Revival now who's got the message of the hour it ain't the Baptists and the Pentecostals see what they're confusing is the Revival for the Antichrist that's the Revival America is going to have they're all going to follow the Antichrist the whole world is going to follow the Antichrist Hallelujah so who who we going to believe we're going to believe denominations or man who had thus sayith the Lord and who points us back to the Bible hallelujah we're going to follow God's Prophet brother brandom Hallelujah and I'm recording this too I'm going to I put put these on YouTube by God's grace the people like them they like to hear uh people tell me all the time they say I love to see God save the Amish people and bring them into the the light of the gospel because now you're no longer Amish now you're Holy Ghost filed Christians amen just like I'm no longer Baptist I'm no longer Pentecostal now I'm a holy ghost filled Christian Glory 29 no I already yeah 29 he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and Heth him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice what makes you happy what makes you happy is hearing the voice of Jesus amen that's what brings you Joy Hallelujah to to know Jesus's word to know him is life Hallelujah to know his Bible's life because he wrote the Bible praise God Amen this is my joy therefore is fulfilled in verse 29 verse 30 he must increase but I must decrease so John the Baptist had to de increase so they could Focus On Christ the same thing with brother brandom brother Bram had to decrease he had to go off the scene and now Jesus increases amen amen like I said now people don't run to brother Rand for every answer we go to Jesus for every answer praise God that's right Jesus Christ must increase your prayers must increase Hallelujah your worship must increase and it all goes back to Jesus Christ Glory now there are three Parables about Jesus as a husband there's three uh we're not going to read all of them because I want to I want to uh save a little bit of time here Matthew 22 1-14 is the King's son Parable Jesus is the engaged son whose father is throwing him a wedding and everyone that comes to the wedding must wear the right garments how many know the symbols of that what's the symbol of the white garment what's that represent does anybody know close the baptism of the Holy Ghost because without that garment you're not getting into the wedding amen that's right that's good though it is it is true Purity true Purity is being born again beautiful remember one guy gets kicked out and they said how'd you get in here he said I climbed another way and brother uses that to to show how see you got to come through Christ because he's the way right the truth and the life that's right and I like that too I preach it like this I preach like this right before the Rapture the Holy Ghost is going to sweep down through the church and going to take out all the people that aren't born again because that's what happens in the parable is't that beautiful I believe that'll be the latter rain brother talk about thus say the Lord the latter rain the last Revival before the Rapture the king of glory amen the the father God the Holy Ghost is going to sweep through the church and anyone not born again is going to be taken out I don't know how right because we don't know the day or the hour no man knows the day or the hour some will be in the field when the rapture happens some will be in the bed think about that you go to bed you wake up the next moment now you're in the Rapture that'd be a great that'd be a great way to wake up from sleep praise God that'd be better than any nice dream you could have in your bed right you wake up and you're at the meeting in the air with Jesus praise God oh my but that's the first Parable Jesus is the son and he's getting married Hallelujah and he needs a bride Hallelujah the second Parable is the 10 virgins this is the most familiar Matthew 25 1-13 now what's the difference between the wise and foolish virgins the wise virgins had oil who knows what the oil represents Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul you got to have it right in here so see any requirement for a wedding the symbol is going to be what you need to get there the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you got to have the white garments the Bible said uh White is the righteousness of the Saints which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the second Parable you got to have the oil and Zechariah Chapter 4 shows the oil is the holy spirit because the oil is from the two anointed ones right Moses and Elijah also is was Z Zechariah and Hagi from Zechariah Chapter 4 there are these two trees right and the Bible calls them the the the Bible calls them the anointed ones and uh God tells Zer I'll do this not by might not by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord oh Church don't worry we know how God's going to Rapture the church it's not by your might it's not by your power but it's by my spirit sayith the Lord hallelujah God's spir if God's spirit got them ready for the day of Pentecost then God's spirit will get us ready for the Rapture hallelujah amen hallelujah think about that they were lost without Jesus guiding them to the day of Pentecost I mean they they were running away brother John they were scatter Peter's like I'll go with you to the cross and then a few hours later he runs away you know we have we we are not sufficient to get ourselves ready for the Rapture Jesus is going to get us ready for the Rapture praise God and if you want to go in the Rapture then Jesus will hold it off until you're ready to go in the Rapture it's exactly right Hallelujah the Rapture cannot go if you want to go and your desires to go the reason you got to desire is because your name is written on the Lamb's Book of Life in heaven Hallelujah but man said if you didn't have that desire he said brother BR said if you have that desire that proves your name is written on the Lamb's Book of Life in heaven Hallelujah brother said if your name wasn't there you wouldn't even desire it think about most of our friends most of our family they're not concerned about the Rapture but what's different about you you've got a desire you got something on the inside of you that God has placed there hallelujah amen and the Bible said if you Delight in the Lord God will give you the desires of your heart hallelujah amen our greatest desire should be for the wedding between Christ and the church hallelujah amen be our greatest desire amen all right now I showed you those verses now the the last Parable is uh Luke 14 it's called the Great supper Luke 141 15- 24 Christ is the host of a great supper and this is like the great marriage supper of the Lamb how we know the marriage supper of the Lamb scripture it's Revelation 19 199 so there's a parable of a great supper and the Messiah again connects himself with an upcoming marriage and his position as the bridegroom he's throwing a great supper and what's the difference in that Parable you had to come and gather at the supper remember that's the parable everybody made an excuse well I could never get rid of my makeup that's an excuse a lot of churches say that one right well I could never sh shout and scream and and and boohoo at the altar that's an excuse they won't come to the wedding supper I can never receive the Holy Ghost I can never act like that I I I could never believe God sent a prophet well that's just an excuse I could never go to church three times a week or four times a week I could never line up my entire life to the word of God that's excuses but see God's people won't make excuses God God's people will find a way for Jesus to create in them the kind of character that Jesus's bride must have Hallelujah that's right Jesus's bride will let him transform Her Mind by the renewing of the Holy Spirit As Romans 121 and2 says amen that's right brother Daniel think about it how many times has your mind been transformed since you've heard this message brother uran think about it how many times wow I'm transformed I got a I got the opposite thought on that scripture right right brother Levi amen that's right Hallelujah you're just transformed and that's what God has donees that's what God is doing to make you the bride he constantly has to transform your thinking and that in turn transforms your actions your character Hallelujah and so we have three Parables on Jesus as the husband and they must be a bride if there's a husband the Bible also says in Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come Hallelujah so according to Jesus the bride is talking today the bride's got a voice amen hallelujah and what's what's your voice say come to Jesus amen come join us come join this wedding celebration Hallelujah we just got invited to another wedding yet last night if I God's grace there's a family down in South Carolina they invited us out to a wedding and I thought wow what a wonderful thing they're asking us to drive with is it 9 hours or too far yes there's my correction 12 hours down south to the 120 degree weather you know but you know that that's a joy of the family we're inviting you to the wedding and a wedding is an event well you'll cross the you'll cross the country for a wedding won't you amen just like Jesus is going to cross all the dimensions amen hallelujah brother said don't cross the milky white way Hallelujah he'll cross all the the outer space he'll cross everything to meet his bride in the air hallelujah amen oh glory amen so this the bride has a voice today the bride says come hear this word come be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's what the bride says she's got a voice and she speaks what the spirit says how do I know what the spirit says brother Jesse because it's already written in the word of God so sisters you can Witness you can invite people to church remember that woman in John chapter 4 the Samaritan woman at the well the Bible said she went down the city and she told them come see a man who told me everything I did and brother BR said God used her to save almost the entire city a woman she wasn't preaching brother said she was testifying that's what you sisters can do tell your testimonies tell your dreams right that are spiritual dreams tell about your healing tell about your transformation you sister can be used by God to share those testimonies praise God brother said she was so on fire she was like a house on fire on a windy day praise God in other words you ain't going to shut down these testimonies may God help us to have testimonies that glorify God hallelujah amen that's a woman so see sisters you have your place to share your testimonies right and also I believe this a woman brother man said a woman can have all nine gifts of the Holy Spirit some of those are actual words you speak like words of wisdom and words of knowledge and that's where I believe like my wife has I believe my wife has some of those gifts because I haven't understood certain things and she'll just speak something and it will give me the wisdom I need to do it but she has to open her mouth and speak right just like that woman at the at the well she had to open her mouth to run down in the city she had to testify so this is part of the book of Acts Church being restored remember Philip had four virgin daughters who prophesied imagine sitting in a surface like this and a single sister who's a virgin prophesies and said thus sayith the Lord Brother Jesse don't go there tomorrow because there's going to be an avalanche or something thus sayith the Lord and imagine it happen praise God I'd say I'd say that make us real reverent to the spirit of God don't you that's what they had in the book of Acts virgin daughters who prophesied and it came to pass many times is through dreams right so if we are going to be the Bride of Jesus Christ then like brother man said we've got to be restored back to the book of Acts Hallelujah and church we like I tell our church all the time we are we are continuation of the book of Acts we're just in the process of restoration right before the Rapture brother Levi I believe it's going to be brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride thus sayeth the Lord amen so the closer we get to the Rapture the closer we going to see things like the lame walking like limbs being healed Hallelujah the closer we get because it's thus sayth the Lord the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride hallelujah amen and that's according to the Bible That's Joel 2 23-26 brother Bram tells us see brother Bram wouldn't give us a prophecy if it dis agree with the Bible it be right with the Bible hallelujah amen so the the Bible many times speaks of a bride and remember Revelation 21 the city of God the future home descends as a bride Hallelujah that that City represents a bride right it's like a it's like a descending pyramid it descends as a bride and the Earth is like the husband right the city descends like a bride she's beautiful the Bible says she's adorned in Gold transparent gold jewels Gates my she's beautiful and she comes down and she unites with the husband Hallelujah and this is the home of Jesus's bride Hallelujah so the future home that's the home of Jesus and his bride that's their uh that's their permanent address you can you'll look you'll look me up I'll find you there brother Howard you'll have address address I'll have an address too brother it might be Leo bride Avenue something like that something like that look look for me brother I'll be there we'll be there sister Melinda by God's grace we'll be there because we're the bride because we keep all the word of God hallelujah amen we believe all the word of God we won't compromise on God's word hallelujah just like the days of Jesus all right so we're seeing all these good verses now raise your hand I don't know if I need to go over this but how many know that Israel was married to God but then God divorced them raise your hand have you studied that couple okay one two three okay four five okay well let me just go over this since maybe half of you have read that in Ezekiel 16 we're not going to read it but that's where God says I found Israel like a child lying in its blood you know kind of reminds me of the Good Samaritan Parable right half dead right God says I found Israel like a little girl lying in blood but I picked her up I healed her and she grew up and became a beautiful woman and I married her but then she played the Harlot and I had to put her away okay then in Jeremiah God says I divorc Israel Hallelujah let's read that Jeremiah 3:8 brother John you want to read that I'm gonna start having you some of you Saints read for me here Jeremiah 3:8 yep Jeremiah 3:8 whenever you're ready everybody listen here and I saw when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not but went and played the Harlot also amen I gave her a bill of divorcement God loved Israel so much he redeemed her he brought her out of Egypt for crying out loud can I say that he brought her out of slavery right I brought you out of the this system I strengthen you Hallelujah I sent you Moses and Joshua David I said I put you in the promised land but then what they do Solomon was one started it he he built all these Idols to all these false gods asth all these gods and then what happened after that church is all downhill every now and then you had a Revival in a generation but it was all downhill till God says I'm divorcing you all right can everybody see that now how about in the Jeremiah 3:14 brother you got that Jeremiah 34 can you read verse 14 brother turn oh back sliding children says the Lord for I am married unto you and I will take you one of his City and two of a family and I will bring you to Zion amen so God has to divorce Israel but but he says I'm married to you but you haven't been true to me so I've got to put you away Hal Hallelujah now how about verse 20 um Sister Sarah do you got verse 20 Jeremiah 3:20 could you read that 3:20 please amen sister Ruth you want to read verse 22 because here it speaks of I will heal your backsliding although you've been untrue to me I will heal you want to read that s return ye backsliding children and I will heal your back behold we come the amen isn't God so gracious he married a woman Israel who's untrue to him all the time she's so Unfaithful but he says if you just return I'll receive you talk about Grace amen talk about Grace and this was typed in hosea's marriage how many know how many remember Hosea God told him go marry a harlot on purpose because I'm going to show Israel about the husband I've been to I've been to Israel he marries a harlot they have two children and then she goes off in more harlotry but in chapter three he goes to the slave yard and he buys her back he purchases her he purchases her back with all that he has Hallelujah and that's what Jesus did hallelujah amen that's right Jesus gave all of his life Hallelujah he gave all that he was in order to purchase Israel with his own blood and he didn't just purchase Israel he purchased the whole world the Bible says amen he he paid for the sin of Israel but not only Israel but all the Gentiles as well that is another proof that God was in brother Ram's message because brother R could bring out all these Old Testament types of the of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen Church did you know that the Millennium is called married land you remember that Bula land how many you ever heard of BU land let's read that Isaiah 624 but how would you want to get that one Isaiah 624 and5 now listen as brother Howard reads this God is telling Israel I'm going to bring you back to married land what is that that's the Millennium because brother R tells us the Rapture is the marriage ceremony right when we get raptured it's a marriage ceremony and then the Millennium is the honeymoon thousand year honeymoon Hallelujah and then the future home is our permanent residence Living With Jesus thank you Jesus in The Pyramid Home Hallelujah so we got all three we got the ceremony we got the honeymoon we got a future home praise God hallelujah oh that's beautiful my goodness let makes me so joyful praise God Amen uh brother Howard you want to read that here he tells Israel but I'm going to bring you back to BU land which is merried land go ahead verses four and five thou shal no more be be ter forsaken neither shall thy land anymore be ter desate but Thou shalt be called sh whatever you call that heah I'm sorry heah okay and land for the Lord Delight in thee and thy land shall be married for as a Young Man Marth a virgin so shall thy Sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy God Rejoice over thee and the church said amen as a husband rejoices over his bride God rejoices over you the church God loves you God is rejoicing over you why because you've let him wash you and prepare you to be the bride amen amen hallelujah God loves you yes he's got to test you and try you we'll get to that you know with Hebrews chapter 12 every Son of God must be tried that means spank cha the word chasing means to hit and spank we don't like to go through that but sometimes disobedient children need a good spanking right right and so it's you know it's it's true we're his bride in one way but we're also like little children growing up to be a mature woman praise God hallelujah so we are going to married land the Millennium is BU land it's married land it's our honeymoon praise God With Jesus and he Delights in this church he Delights in the Believers as a husband rejoices over over his wife Hallelujah now the Bible also says this let's go to acts 15:14 brother Levi do you want to read that or you recorded sorry brother [Music] 15:14 sister Annie could you get Romans 9 can you I I think it's 9:25 here yep it's 9:25 so uh brother Levi acts 15:14 and sister Annie Romans 9:25 okay brother Levi whenever you're ready brother Simon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name amen I'll pause pause right there thank you brother so this is in the the context where Paul and Barnabas they're they're no longer going to the Jews because the Jews have blasphemed Jesus Remember That from the scripture he said we must now go to the Gentiles but notice he's going there to get a people for his name when I got married to my wife she didn't keep her maiden named hesterman I got a wife for my name Smith right that that's a type right she takes on my name I got a wife for my name's sake now we're the Smith family praise God right right Hallelujah so it is with God God takes his bride and she's called by his name brother says you're Mrs Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah because the Bible says the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named Lord Jesus Christ how many remember that from the book of Ephesians Ephesians 3 the whole family in Heaven and Earth is called Ms Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah and where' you get that name when we baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's when you became a associated with that name Hallelujah you were buried in the name of your husband you want to be identified with your husband that's why we didn't we do the baptisms here brother Daniel is that right so on these I call on these sacred grounds I'll say like that amen amen 17 of you died you're buried and now you're associated with the name of Jesus Christ amen oh Hallelujah now sister now this verse is really wonderful in this verse God calls the Gentiles his beloved that means his favorite if you look it up in the Greek favorite God has favorites I thought he isn't a respector of persons well he's not but those who obey he has to reward more because he's a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him amen that's right God is not a respector of person he'll judge everybody the same but if you're faithful to God you get more rewards just like you you just like you would trust your children right you trust workers if they're faithful with a little bit of work won't you give them more brother yeah that's how it is with God go ahead sister as he says also o I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which were not Bel amen so if you read that whole text he's talking about Jews and Gentiles we're Gentiles because we're non-jewish and it was prophesied in Hosea I'm going to make a people my beloved even though they were not my beloved Hallelujah so Church you are the Beloved of God God Delights in you he loves you nothing can separate you from his love he's your bride Hallelujah and you're and you are his bride you're his wife the Bible says you're the apple of his eye amen amen right that's the truth that's the Bible right the Bride of Jesus Christ is the apple of his eye I'm glad to see some Smiles out there praise God CU your husband Christ loves you that's right he takes great Delight in his people praise God Amen now you become a bride member just by repenting and being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and obeying the word of God that's in 2 Corinthians 11:2 uh Mah can you look that up Mah love that prophet name 2 Corinthians 11:2 2 Corinthians 11 112 Paul Paul says I'm the one that engaged you to Jesus right normally the father engages you to right the father will engage a woman so Paul's like a spiritual father he said you have thousands of teachers but not many fathers right so when when when the when the Corinthians heard the gospel that Paul preached and they believed it and they were baptized Paul said I espouse you to Christ I engage you to Christ amen then brother says in the ible Union it say it say if God put an engagement ring of unmerited Grace on your finger before the foundation of the world because he forew all the people that would be his people praise God amen amen all right brother M uh Second Corinthians 11:2 whenever you're ready buddy I am jealous you jealous I I may present you Chas virgin to Christ amen great reading buddy awesome job there so see Paul says I espouse you to Christ so each one of us when you get saved and baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're now engaged to Christ you are the bride of Christ amen right then the question is will you go on and become born again right will you be the wise or the foolish and we know all by God's grace all of us here by God's grace we want to be the wise vers and praise God Amen Hallelujah praise God let me just say this I want to share this to we talked about the Holy Ghost baptism there last time in akan too everybody has to have a experience with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but let me tell you this but after that you will be tried and after that you might wonder if you are born again everybody I've ever talked to has said that you so you got to have one experience where it's an emotional it's a powerful experience something Supernatural happens but then God is going to let you be tested anyone remember brother Ram's greatest test brother R's greatest test was when God took his first wife and daughter Sharon Rose brother ramam said that was my greatest trial brother I already had the Holy Ghost for a number of years but he said when God took his wife and daughter Satan came in and said I thought you said God's a god a good God but there he took your child you've seen God he all these people cancer God could heal your daughter but he doesn't heal your daughter and I counted brother R said he agreed with Satan five times he said I was about ready to not serve him now let me just stop right there a holy ghost filled man can be so tested by God he can that God allow him to be tested a man who saw all these wonders and miracles could almost be convinced to quitting preaching brother B said but at that last moment when everything broke away he said all reasoning broke away when all reasonings broke away he said there was an anchor he said the new birth hell down in his soul praise God he said then the scripture came to him the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord amen hallelujah exactly right so we in our lives we want to look for a real Holy Ghost experience brother said maybe you'll shout maybe you'll dance maybe you'll scream he said maybe you'll speak in tongues he said you'll do something he said but make sure after that happens make sure your life lines up with the word of God hallelujah amen and then you will be tested but every child of God must be tested amen that's right I shared a quote sisters and we've talked about this I shared a quote online people loved it brother R said a lot of times he said I don't even feel saved I'm GNA say that again a holy ghost filled man who's seen signs wonders and miracles discernment after discernment vision of angels after vision of Angel and he said a lot of times I don't even feel saved see because when he would come out of that that spiritual realm of Visions he was still a man and the church said amen that's right look it up a lot of times I don't even feel saved now we always we could live in the happiness and the joy I just feel like dancing every service I be like shouting screaming every service but God let you be tested the Bible said there's a time today and a time to M mourn brother had to mourn over his wife hope right I just want to lay that in there I was sharing that with a brother the the preacher was preaching for us today we had a good Fellowship yesterday on the word of God it's like all these verses kept coming and then Paul said in uh 2 Corinthians 7:5 when we were come to Macedonia we had no uh our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were're fightings and within in fears let's stop for a moment Paul how many believe Paul was a holy ghost filled man hallelujah amen look at that's good good testimony there he said but I got to a spot where I had no rest and I'm sure your moms feel like that sometimes when the kids are sick you don't get any rest right everybody else gets asleep except you you know at least that's how it is in my house my wife is so gracious to me but Paul's at a spot I have no rest and there's trouble on every side think about that a holy ghost f Prophet yet there's trouble in Corinth there's trouble in galatia there's trouble with these Brethren trouble I'm just surrounded by trouble and there's fightings churches fightings amen amen amen some of our message churches fight sometimes don't we but like brother brand said we're still brandom's we're still Christians right sometimes Brothers fight you said go back in the backyard don't he said all the brothers got to fight on our own grounds if anybody comes against the Broms now we're we're going to gather up we're going to gather all the brands we're going to fight against our our strangers right amen that's how it is brother right us holy ghost filled Brothers we might fight and argue and and things it's all in godliness of course but when it comes down to saying for this message we believe this message amen we believe the Bible Revelation that God gave to us and the Bible said fight the good fight of Faith hallelujah amen and then within were fears so here's a holy ghost filled man I want to share this with our sisters that because we talked about this you can be filled with the Holy Ghost but then also in your soul but then in your mind have fears all around trouble trouble fears trouble but yet you got the seed of God the so the baptism of holy ghost in your soul remember Romans 7 Paul said the things that I want to do I don't do I do the things that I hate how many remember that verse amen and then he says he said oh Wretched Man that I am a holy ghost filled man thought he was wretched everybody catch that what's he talking about he's talking about the sin that dwells within him he still sees his sinful nature right but yet he had the Holy Ghost but he had to be tested and tried he still had to take up his cross daily and follow Jesus that right and then he would say to the Colossians he says the Holy Ghost Christ in you the hope of glory he said which works in me mightily so sometimes brother John he could say God's working in me mightily other times brother John he said I'm a Wretched Man sound familiar to anybody amen sounds like my experience God's doing great God's working mightily in me brother Levi then tomorrow I might be I'm a Wretched Man God have mercy on me thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen thank God for forgiveness amen right thank God for Second Chances and third chances and fourth chances and keep going amen hundreds if not thousands of more chances Hallelujah because he's rich in Mercy he's not lacking in Mercy he's rich in Mercy amen that's right brother Ram said I make thousands of mistakes every year he said sure I do he said but once I recognize I'm wrong I say Lord Jesus forgive me thousands of sins he did in the year that that comes out to at least you know seven or eight sins a day and I'm not giving you a license to sin I'm giving you a license to realize I can have the Holy Ghost and I can be a wretched person sometimes but God gives me the victory praise God and God will bring me back he'll he'll restore me Hallelujah he'll transform my mind he'll bring me back to my first love Hallelujah Hallelujah everybody received that by God's grace you got to have brother say you got to have a you got to have an experience where you can pound the steak in the ground so when you when you do stakes in the ground when you're doing H property right this is my this is Urban's property this is not uran's property right you put a pound of steak so at our house we got a big huge Rock and this this rock represents a stake this side is mine this side's not mine well ra said you got to do that in your life you got to have an experience where you pound that stake down said this is where God did something I was born again but brother R said you're going to be tested to prove that that was real amen the devil's going to come and test you to say was that really real was that really real how do you make sure it's real drive out the enemy Hallelujah said you'll fight for every inch as a Christian Hallelujah you're giving all these promises Born Again Miracles true character Godly character he said but you'll fight for every inch of it hallelujah amen just like Joshua they fought for every inch of the promised land so you've got to have that in your Born Again experience there's been many times I'll say like this honestly there's been many times I've wondered am I Born Again I've been preaching this gospel for 20 years now my first sermon was in January of 2004 I here we are January 200 24 I've been preaching the message of the hour for 20 years but I would honestly say there's many times I wondered am I even born again you know what I do I repent of my sins and I go back and find that steak that I put down in the ground right said Satan I know something happened right here you can't tell me this didn't happen I was there when it happened praise God I'm the one who pounded that steak in the dirt praise God and I'm not diing up and saying no nothing happened there something happened there praise God Amen I've got to go back to that each time nope and I got to Cur I got to go back to that yes something happened there I remember I left that service and I was shaking everybody's hand like I just loved everybody I want to love everybody how can I love everybody I was I thought everybody's an angel in here I found out there wasn't some angels in there later on but I know something happened there love came into my heart I never felt it like that before shouted I screamed clapped my wife was standing right next to me when it happened so she saw it and many times I've shouted and screamed since then braise God but the devil trying to say nothing happened there no something did happen right there right amen because I pounded that in the ground and said I'm remembering that and brother R says it like this he says it's so humble he said if you have a question in your mind he said just keep that until something greater comes amen that's right and the church said amen stay with that if that's your if that's your Landmark if that's your state P I'm stay with this until I get more more land I can possess more Promises of God hallelujah but then remember you'll be tested on that that's right just like Paul Church you remember he was Shipwrecked three times three he was whipped five times and each one was 39 whips do you think in any of those whips he thought am I Born Again why Where's God how come Jesus don't deliver me from this amen he floated sister Wilma One Night in a whole night in the sea floating on a piece of wood you ever think he wondered during those what is 12 hours of Darkness ever think he wondered Where's God where's the angel of the Lord how come God don't rescue me am I really a true prophet of God do you ever think he wondered that during that time amen remember God is the one who said Satan have you considered my servant job right God had a testimony meeting in heaven God knew Job couldn't be swayed from the truth and the church said amen God knew Job would withstand every storm because the Bible Jesus said you got to build your house on a rock of Revelation there Hallelujah God knew job's House was built on Revelation so when the storms come God knew God would job would stand there and he say the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord amen just like brother R when every when all the winds broke down everything when all the winds were blowing the the the the anchor hold brother Ram said who am I anyway when he lost his daughter and wife he said who am I where did I get my daughter anyway Glory he got his daughter from God Amen where did I get her anyway God gave her and God could take her away he said but blessed be the name of the Lord amen that's right amen that's right Hallelujah and he said who am I to question his majesty see brother BR had to learn I can't question things that happened in life God allowed it and how many know there's a purpose for everything in life amen all things work together for good to them that love the Lord them who are called according to his purpose amen everything works together for good amen to them that love the Lord hallelujah now I just want to lay this in there brother Bram says the marriage takes place at the Rapture then we have the marriage supper to Heaven that's one I forgot then we have the marriage supper in heaven where we have communion with Christ in heaven that's while the tribulation is going on okay and then we come down for Armageddon and short after Armageddon then we have the honeymoon the Millennium okay I want I want to make sure I I just state that that's we could preach a whole sermon on that by God's grace and maybe someday I will by God's grace we'll see okay now remember I want to now get into some proofs that were the bride if you got your Bible Galatians 1 verse 6 Galatians 1 verse 6 sister Wilma do you want to read let's see um could you read six and 7 Galatians 1 6 and 7 sister would that be okay and just so you know brother Ram had women read Bible verses in church it's on tape you can hear it she's just not to preach brother said she can do everything except preach right and be leaders and officers in the church uh and we see that in the Bible as well Galatians 1 and can you read uh verses six and seven sister I Marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ amen can you read one more can you read verse eight too sister sure but though we are an Ang from Heaven preach any other gospel unto you than than that which we have preached unto you let him be a first amen thank you so Paul says if you change one thing that I taught by the angel of the Lord You're cursed is that right right Paul even said we I can't change it whatever I wrote cannot be changed all right who else got about brother uh Daniel can you get uh Romans 21:16 brother Daniel these are all the verses I use with people online that are against the message and they're against us I say I use these I said we we can't change anything Paul said we're going to be judged by what Paul said and I give them this this list of all the Paul teachings the Pauline gospels that brother brand restored to us that they disobey but we obey everybody understand that amen we're the bride because we keep all of Paul's gospels and the church said that's why we're the bride because Jesus revealed revealed these truths to Paul and then if we keep them that proves we the bride Hallelujah all right brother Daniel Romans 21:16 and the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel Hallelujah so you and I will all be judged by Paul's gospel the New Testament and and the church saiden and remember when when brother went beyond the curtain of time what did Brother Ram asked uh uh what are we going to be judged by and and he said he said you'll be judged by Paul's gospel and brother ra brother R said that's exactly what I preach when Paul baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so did I where Paul ordained God as one person so did I where Paul prayed or set up the nine gifts of the holy spirit so did I and brother BR said the million shouted we are resting on that hallelujah we're resting on the fact that brother Randon preached Paul's gospel to us brother came around and point us back to the Bible what does the Bible say what does the bible teach and that's what we say we believe the Bible we want more of the Bible we want to believe all the commands of scripture Glory so we have that so we have Galatians 1 and Romans 2:16 we're judged by Paul's gospel and we're cursed if we add or take away anything from it amen right and now we don't have to read it but you know Romans 20 I'm sorry Revelations 22 18- 19 says if you add to the book plagues will be added if you take away your name will be taken out of the book of life that's why we stay with the word of God how's everybody doing everybody doing okay by God's grace okay all right Hallelujah I'm doing good I'm I'm I'm doing good by God's grace all right now let's go to Ephesians 5 here I'm going to try to try to bring this down here a little bit here let me see let me set a little time in Ephesians 5 we see Christ and the church let's go to verse 23 for as the husband is head of the wife even as Christ is head of the church he's the savior of the body so if you look at this text there's five attributes that the woman must have the wife must have five attributes in the natural all right this woman has to do five things so guess what Jesus's woman Jesus's wife has to do five things is that right the first is this woman only has one headship right who's the head of the woman the man who's the head of the Bride Jesus Christ amen hallelujah now most churches don't have the headship of the Bible most churches have the headship of a famous pastor or a denomination or a book of creed or what they call them is bylaws you ever heard of bylaws right okay you probably he's laughing the bylaws is what run is the head of the church but brother ad says we have no Creed but Christ we have no bylaws we have no book but the Bible hallelujah amen right we have no law here but love love the word of God Amen see that so right now this this just this first there's five of them this first attribute eliminates almost all the churches from being the bride because Christ is not the head of the church amen right all right now here are 10 I might have read this before but it's worth reading again here's 10 teachings Paul gave us that most churches break okay most churches break and then they're guilty of not letting Christ be the head of them but if you keep them that proves you're the bride the first one is homosexual relationships Paul condemned homosexual relationships a lot of churches are going for that today the second is adulterous relationships men divorcing and remarrying divorce and remarriage that's sin the bride won't do that the third one is fornication we were at a wedding one time and this pastor was thankful that the couple was living together before they were married living in fornication I know it's awful it was a Lutheran Church I I can't remember which one it was some denomination think about that rejoicing over fornication that ain't the bride and I tell you she didn't look like a modest bride either number four birth control pills are like murder pills right so a lot of churches allow birth control pills that's murder because they will they will abort a fertilized pregnancy Fifth and and Paul says we can't have the spirit of murder right fifth women preachers Paul said I don't allow woman to preach six uh the Bible says if you destroy your body God will destroy you so cigarettes drunkenness substance abuse that's a sin I sat with a Lutheran man one time and he and his whole wall was lined with beer bottles look at all the beers I've dranken and he said it's okay to get drunk as long as you're with the Luthers and long as you don't do anything bad so people can't tell me uh you know churches don't think they can get drunk they absolutely can think that they think that and he's like you need to become a he right when I got in the message he said you need to become a Lutheran Pastor I said no if I preach it all I'm going to preaching the message and so I did Hallelujah number eight is viewing sinful M movies in television shows because Paul said avoid all appearance of evil but these people will allow pornography they'll allow sex scenes and movies they'll allow all this trash but Paul said don't let it even come in front of your eyes number nine shameful hair lengths right they let the women cut their hair they let their men grow long hair now think about this all of these Church all of these disqualify them from being the bride but it qualifies you to being the bride amen Oh I thought I thought I'd get a Lotter amen than that praise God Amen the bride has the headship of Christ amen her headship is the word ninth is is uh they they uh they take false conversions they say as soon as you believe you're filled with the Holy Ghost that's nonsense Paul said have you received the Holy Ghost since you've been a Believer and number 10 in modest clothing Paul said dress in modest clothing so right there there's 10 simple doctrines that all these churches break disqualifies them from being the bride because their bylaws are their head instead of the Bible their headship amen the second attribute is in verse 24 uh fans 5:24 the church is subject to Christ in everything let's all say everything can we everything so all those 10 everything glory and we've seen it my wife and I we' we've uh you we've had that church since 2006 we're coming up on almost 18 years in June 18 years and our church I believe is obedient in everything are we perfect no but all these commands we are trying our church is trying by God's grace to be obedient to everything Christ says so for example if someone needs a car I went and got a couple cars for people now of course used ones I can't afford a new car you know but like but like if somebody needs something we're the book of Acts if somebody don't have something I mean we've let two people move in with us for a little bit of time well three three that's been hard to say no that's been hard sisters um but that's what the Bible says if you don't have a home give him a home amen that's right right how many times have I people in Mar Church uh we're out of money what do I do got to give money that's what the church does if you say you love somebody but don't help them the Bible said your faith is not your faith is not alive Hallelujah see we are the book of Acts church we must be just like the book of Acts obeying every word the third attribute is washing Ephesians 5:26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with a washing of water through the word of God and these kind of go together so when you learn to obey the Bible when you come service after service week after week month after month year after year when you let God's word change your life you're being Washed by the word you're being Washed by the word hallelujah the Bible says that in 1 Peter 1:22 you're purified in obeying the truth through the spirit amen hallelujah I can't help but get excited so amen I know you're used to it but I just want to make sure I say it Hall I just got to clap some say that's right amen I love the word of God you get washed as you obey the truth of God's word Hallelujah that's part of the washing process amen Jesus washes his bride he's patient with her to obey the commands of God how many times have you noticed what was brother R's main sin he battled has anyone remembered it's the critical spirit the critical spirit and the critical spirit is you can find nothing good to say about somebody I just put the video out yesterday brother R says pray for me I'm haunted by a critical spirit now this makes total sense God had revealed all these things to him he talked to angels and so when he see people off the word of God he just criticized them but he said I can't do that I've got to let God judge them he said oh God let me not criticize them he said Lord help me love them Lord let me love them he bowed it all the way up till 1963 listen to this message standing in the Gap brother Ram said I was so fed up with it I preached all these years and the about women and they keep getting shorter hair more makeup he said he said I'm ready to take my wife and move up into Colorado and I only come down and stomp down when I got thus say the Lord and then I'll stomp back up and the angel said if you do that your wife will divorce or leave you not divorce the your wife will leave you think about that he got so caught up in his complex these people won't hear me they won't hear me he said I lost the feeling for the people like Moses lost the feeling for his people remember he lost the feeling he said you bunch of rebels you want water from this rock here's your water smack bunch of rebels brother Bram said that happened to him in the New Testament with the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah amen and he said forgive me for calling you ricketta and Ricky he would name call these modern people you he said you bunch of Ricky and retas he said the Lord told me I shouldn't name call like that just like Moses Moses said you bunch of rebels right amen right Church listen to that and brother talked to the angel he's driving and the angel and he said I thought I was a prophet and the angel says you're not an Old Testament Prophet you're an Apostolic Prophet Old Testament prophets could walk away in the wildness like Elijah sit out by the Brook of cheriff and then come back in with thus say the Lord and walk out but the New Testament Prophet they stay with the church amen amen look at Paul Paul didn't stay away from the churches what' he do he went in a circuit and strengthened the churches he stayed with the churches praise God and God tells brother brandham that so all all these people they misunderstand uh you know brother brandham as a prophet he was a new testament Prophet not an Old Testament Prophet The Angel tells him that in standing in the Gap 1963 Hallelujah he said I can't go out until God changes my feeling for the people well guess what God Chang his feeling for the people amen God gave him a soft heart even if more people paint their faces and more men compromised on the word of God whatever the sin was he said I'm still I'm going out for that bride I'm like El eer going to get that Rebecca hallelujah praise God I've got to go out and get a bride ready for Isaac I got to get a bride for Jesus Christ hallelujah amen oh I love this message I love love God's Prophet because he point us back to the word of God we can learn so much from Brother bram's preaching his life the fourth attribute is joined that's in Ephesians 5:31 for this cause a man shall leave his father mother and be joined join means glued so a woman I'm sorry a man has to leave his children and be joined to his wife glued to his wife okay and that's what we do as the church we're glued glued to Christ and also that means we're glued to Christ's people that's why we gather more in church as we see that day approaching amen I think I told you this before May when I preach laying foundations brother Bram said if you got the Holy Ghost you can't wait for Daniel's door to open on Sunday morning to go to his house and have church amen hallelujah or brother irin and sister wil's house when they're hosed Church you can't wait he said if Jesus Christ is in your heart you can't wait to see the Saints and fellowship with them because that's your brother and sister hallelujah amen hallelujah I know that's the truth before I before you know when when I was raised in Pentecostal church I would sit down like this while the preachers preaching imagine me brother I'm sitting down like this I don't want to hear anything the preacher says and now God Saves me now I'm up shouting and screaming and spitting and trying to get everybody to believe the word of God hallelujah I love going to church I'm always the first one to church and I'm the last one to leave that's normally how it goes by God's grace and I used to hate going to church my mom would have to take bats brother Levi she would pull off the the our blankets on Sunday morning and hit us with bats to try to get us up to go to church and then she would get a spray bottle of water and vinegar while I was sleeping she pulled back and spray me right in the face get up Jesse it's time to go to church I didn't want to go to church and now I'm the first one at church praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus that's right Hallelujah I'm the one let's get ready to go and that's all all these things by God's grace see because we want to be glued to [Music] Christ brother Ram says I'd rather have you love my children than love me and brother R said that's how God feels in other words when you love God's children it shows you love God Amen the only way I can prove to irin or anyone that I love God is to love him and love Wilma the Bible says if you can't love the people you can see you cannot love the person you can't see so part of being the bride is loving God's people around you amen that's why we gather more we got to be glued to the bride right as a bride we got to be glued together and glued to Christ amen and let me S say this because there's a lot of people in the message don't know how to do this but if somebody offends you go to them oneon-one like Matthew 18:15 says right now it can't be a man and a woman that aren't married so if the man's offended he's got got to take his wife and go to the woman or go to the man right you don't want to you don't want to have men men and women that aren't married together like that but let's do that so many people are afraid to talk about offenses but Jesus said if you just do that you'll feel so much better right but so many people today don't like people on YouTube they just want to go on YouTube and blast somebody blast me or blast brother random and they don't even talk to me first about it that's not the Christian way the Christian way is if I differ with my brother my sister I'm going to go to them oneon-one or with a small group and let's talk this out brother Ram said in that sermon uh Church order he said even if the janitor disagrees with me he said let's go and talk about it let's solve this out together by the scripture amen so who's the janitor here Sister Miriam right so brother R was the leader of the church so he said even the low we said the lowest no you're not the lowest is stupid but what I'm saying I hey I scrubed the church I I scrub the toyset at our church I scrubbed them yesterday yesterday I I don't taking any shame in that I'm supposed to be a servant and I do that to remind myself that I am a servant I just put a little baking soda in there right I scrub it up with the brush it's all clean I I need to be a servant I need to remember I'm no better than anybody Amen in fact the minister should be the most servant amongst all of the people that's right they should be the biggest servants or the the not biggest but the people who want to serve the most that's right but brother R says I'll take the lowest they say the most humble person in the church and if I'm wrong he said you're Duty bound to correct me by the scripture all right amen and I got all the quotes you want any of these quotes just text me or email me I will gladly give you all these quotes most of them I got online too by God's grace now the fifth and final attribute is reverence the Bible said in Ephesians 5:33 nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband now you've probably been to some Churches recently that were not message churches right did you see the same level of reverence in those churches no we uh I've been invited to preach at a Baptist Church numerous times good people they're nice people but there's no reverence in in this really in the sanctuary they'll talk and laugh and walk across before service there's really no praying and waiting on God there's just not that reverence and you've probably heard of some people they take coffee and donuts into church right they're giving themselves uh diabetes while they're hearing the word of God I'm talking about the donuts now coffee is good just don't put any sugar in it but they they give themselves diabetes yeah it's so irreverent this is a but the Bible said God's house is a house of judgment it's a courthouse who's ever seen a person on trial eating Donuts at their trial right is that is that right right it's so ridiculous right and and this proves they don't have the reverence that they need that God is worthy of the Bible says examine yourselves whether you be in the fa the faith the Bible says how you going examine yourself when you're sitting back eating a donut popping jokes while the word of God let me chug down all this coffee and all these Donuts that's good good joke preacher is that that reverence for our husband Christ that's not reverence that's irreverence Hallelujah so we have a great reverence in the message everybody that was around brother bram's Ministry you know this if you read the church the supernatural book everyone that was around brother R's Ministry said there was a different level of reverence in his ministry amen everybody knew that that's right exactly right and that's the same thing my wife and I found when we come to this message we even walked in these guys homes these were single guys in their 20s and I'm like this is this this is different this is a holy atmosphere in here they got Jesus on the wall they're 20 they're big Burly guys you know like Dave lellan big muscle guys they got all this humble picture of Jesus I had this long hair like I my mullet you know short in front long in the back you know I'm walking in there like what what is going on it just it was a different atmosphere I come to the church I see people praying before service Hallelujah I see people praying after service Hallelujah people seeking God hungry for more of God the bride reverences her husband amen that's right right my wife doesn't bad talk me I don't bad talk her we reverence one another right right there's reverence there there's respect there's Godly appreciation for one another and that's what this bride has this bride has has reverence for Christ okay now I'm going to close with this we can judge every Church by this standard right here amen that's right proving that proves we are the Bride of Jesus Christ because brother Brandon pointed us back to the Bible in everything that we do there are here's the groups in Christianity there's 1.3 billion Catholics are they the bride they're actually the false bride they're the mother Harlot a cage of unclean the hateful Birds how do you know because of her false doctrines that's how you know the fruits of her Ministry after that the next biggest group is Protestants now we fall under that by God's grace then you have Eastern Orthodox anglicans Oriental Orthodox and all others now all these groups cannot be the bride there can only be one bride in all these groups now I listed 15 doctrines I've already listed 15 remember when I went through homosexuality fornication birth control pills all these things none of these churches keep all 10 of those or all 15 of those so they cannot be the bride here's another one they don't do the B baptism is the right way they don't preach on three works of Grace they say God's three persons that's a lie they crossdress men wearing women garments women wearing men's garments and they many of them deny the supernatural gifts of the Holy Ghost so right there is 15 now at my H our I'm sorry our church I preach and I showed 110 false doctrines think about that I I went through real fast I could have preached a whole sermon on it but I listed 110 different doctrines between us and everybody else think about that brother there is in other words listen Church there's a great difference between you and all the other churches Hallelujah that's why God loves you hallelujah amen there's a huge difference brother in invisible Union brother Ram says there's hundreds of these differences and then he names bobbing hair the right baptism he said that's just a few of them he said there's hundreds of them he said brother random the me the pre the message you're preaching is wrong he says go search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they which testify of me amen he said if you do that he said you'll find out the message is Right amen amen hallelujah I love it praise God Amen brother Irvin why' you marry sister Wilma because there was so many differences between her and all the other women Amen to that right brother brother he said am why did I marry my wife Kristen cuz I knew I couldn't live without her I couldn't have anybody else marry her she had to be mine that's what brother R said don't marry him unless you can't live without him amen there a lot of nice women but there something different about her Hallelujah for me and I can list hundreds of reasons why we found all some of our old love letters recently find some of our old love letters it's kind of funny to see all the changes you know but I list all these reasons I think on her 40th birthday we did 40 reasons why we love mommy you know went through all these reasons that's a small number because brother Ram says there's hundreds of differences between the Bride of Jesus Christ and all the other churches claiming to be the bride in other words Jesus isn't going to get confused are the Junction City Saints bride or not I I can't really tell the difference between them and and the Methodist Church down or the Amish Church down the road is there am Church down the road by your your house brother I wonder uh which one is the bride no Jesus knows because he spent time with you he's washed you in the waters of the word hallelujah he's dressed you Hallelujah he spent time with you Hallelujah he's seen your reverence amen he's seen that he's the head of your church hallelujah amen he's done all of that so that's why he can call you his beloved that's why he can call you bride because You' let him go through these five steps of washing you you obey him you submit to him you reverence him you love him and he loves you praise God let's stand to our feet let's have a word of prayer I could have went through all these I listed all the differences between uh Catholics Baptists lutherans 7 Day Adventist Jehovah's Witnesses Mormons ethern Eastern Orthodoxy Oriental Orthodox I went through all this to show how there's only one bride and she keeps all the word of God and brother Ram said in the church age book she will try to line up her life according to the blueprint of the book of Acts and that's what we're trying to do here we're going to Lord willing try to establish a church here in the near future as far as voting in leaders and so forth like that that's what the Bible did that's what they did in the Bible sometimes in the Bible the Holy Ghost would just say Paul and Barnabas you go this you go on the missionary trip but Paul told Titus you or you ordain Elders in every city you know we need in Junction City we need an elder praise God we need a leader we need a pastor right just like we need an acronym ordain Elders in every city in other words ordain a bishop or an overseer or a pastor it's the same word Elder Bishop overseer they're all the same now you can have brothers that are Elders that are more advanced in the faith that's true but if you're talking about the leader of the church that's the the elders the same as the bishop The Bishop's the same as the pastor but Church be encouraged Jesus knows you Jesus knows you're the bride Jesus knows you're his beloved just keep reverencing him just keep him as your headship praise God was this sermon a help to anybody by God's grace all right well that's nice to see that boy Comforts my heart praise God I know I preach long I know it's hard to stay awake when I'm free sometimes but I know we go through all the cares of life but I'm very glad I wrote a whole chapter on this if you want to chapter on this is in chapter four of the 2021 book this is one of the Mysteries brother Ram finished the mystery of the church as the Bride of Jesus Christ who's filled by the Holy Ghost amen now let's bow our heads let's have a word of prayer and as we pray think in Your Heart Lord do I need to be more reverent to you Hallelujah remember we went through these examples all these attributes Lord do I need to be more joined to the body of Christ do I separate myself from the church a little too much could I be more attached to the people spend more time with the Saints or how about Lord uh I need to be washed you know I've recently sinned I need you to wash me in the waters of the word or how about I need to submit my life there's some things in my life I need to submit because the bride is submissive in all things or how about that first one Lord you need to be the head of my life I've been trying to run my life too much I need you to be the head of my life hallelujah praise God let have word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for today Lord I'm so grateful for the freedom and liberty I feel in the Holy Ghost with this young church here Lord God filled with wonderful beautiful Believers Lord God Saints of like Precious Faith Lord it is always an honor and privilege of my life to come down here and preach this glorious gospel Paul's gospel Lord God brother R pointing us back to Paul's gospel Lord God which we will be judged by we must not add or take anything away Lord we seen today you rejoice over your bride as I Rejoice over my wife and Lord I remember my wedding day was the happiest day of my life outside of being saved and Lord if I Rejoice that much to see how beautiful she was to know that she's going home with me tonight we'll always be together if I rejoice and delighted in her that much how much more do you Delight in us as your church Lord God Hallelujah Lord thank you for these five attributes of a real bride in Ephesians 5 I pray Lord you deal with each person now Lord as we pray As we sing as we worship Lord God Jesus I pray you would just wash us Lord God hallelujah you've called us to be your bride and just create that bride character in us we hear it all the time brother BR talking about the bride and preacher talking about the bride but now we can see it in the Bible Hallelujah he that hath the bride is the bridegroom Hallelujah Jesus you are the husband we are the bride you're looking for a people called for your name's sake that's why we were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah that's why we'll submit to every word of God thank you Jesus as I've seen you do it in our church there for 17 years I know you do it here Lord as well by Your Grace by your mercy Lord God thank you Lord God for this opportunity L I pray now Lord if there's anyone that needs special prayer I just pray Lord you would give us the Faith Lord God Hallelujah to believe all Promises of God to receive what you want to do today Lord God as your prophet taught us we must find the perfect will of God we must ask according to thy will that your will would be done not our will would be done dear God Lord we thank you for today Lord Jesus we thank you for Bible evidence Bible proof that you have a bride and you're washing her and getting her ready for that wedding day Lord ah we're looking forward to that wedding day when we see you face to face Hallelujah as Peter said we've seen we've loved the one we haven't seen But Lord one day we will see the one that we love Hallelujah one day we'll see you face to face on that day we'll have bodies liken unto your glorious body so Lord we thank you God guide your people now Lord God I pray you'd minister to their needs and prayer requests bless our fellowship as well Lord God and may this church grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ as we prepare for your coming Lord we

before we started our church we had a day of prayer and fasting and then we voted for leaders and then when brother cam started the church I you know uh I was there and I I made I helped start that church we had just a day of prayer and fasting we would just pray fast pray fast throughout the day and then at the end we voted for the leaders and God's helped that church Move On by God's grace and where do we get that that's Acts chapter 13 the Bible said the prophets and the teachers would gather they'd pray and fast and the Holy Ghost would say send me separate me Paul and Barnabas for this ministry so as you're talking about that as you're thinking about you know electing a pastor and deacons and treasur so forth keep that in mind I'll be happy to do that with you day of prayer and
