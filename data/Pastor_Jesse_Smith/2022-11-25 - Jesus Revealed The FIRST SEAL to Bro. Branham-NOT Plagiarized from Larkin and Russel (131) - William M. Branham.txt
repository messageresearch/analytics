TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to prove hopefully by God's grace once and for all that brother Branham received the revelation of the first seal from the Lord Jesus Christ and did not plagiarize it from Clarence Larkin Charles Tays Russell nor Uriah Smith so by the grace of God we'll begin a series on the Seven Seals and the revelations that the Lord Jesus Christ revealed to his Prophet brother William Branham earlier this year I did a podcast it was our third podcast and showed how brother Bram did not plagiarize Charles Tays Russell and Clarence Larkin so you can listen to that podcast if you'd like but then I also wanted to go a step further and show how brother Ram did not plagiarize from Uriah Smith either by God's grace we'll show screenshots of each of The Minister's books and writings on the Seven Seals and hopefully this gives our viewers and our listeners undeniable proof without brother Branham did not plagiarize either of these three ministers this will also show how these so-called researchers today or accusers of brother Branham missed the truth that was laying right before their faces and in most cases the truth was just a few lines away from what they were reading many times on the same page or on the next page this proves brother Ram's accusers who say they are researchers were either incredibly shoddy or weak with their research or were honestly ignorant of what brother Ram taught on the Seven Seals or were dishonest on purpose in order to slander God's Prophet brother Branham while denying the truth that laid right before their faces before getting into the first seal let's begin with hyperbole or exaggeration on everything brother Branham read of other people friends brother Brandon's accusers use the following quote to make brother random out to be a liar because he said everything he read from other ministers was different than what came to him in the room as he studied for the Seven Seals but obviously this quote from Brother Branham was hyperbole or an exaggeration let's listen to brother Ram's quote now I want to make this real clear every time every time that these seals has come to the place everything that I ever believed on him and has read of other people has been contrary to what come to me in the room obviously this statement from Brother Branham was an exaggeration or Hyperbole and notice brother M did not say thus say the Lord in this statement he did not say thus saith the Lord everything I ever thought was different from these men if you actually keep listening to brother Ram's statement here he said his mind was weary from the week of study because it was a long week of strain of studying and preaching let's listen to these quotes then this morning I'll never forget this morning the grace of our savior to his tired weary servant when I answered a poor person's question and the best of my mind and all of a sudden as if I'd taken something away from a child so it's clear to me and every other honest person that brother random was just exaggerating in this statement from the seventh seal a simple comparison of brother Ram's quotes on each of the Seven Seals shows brother random use some or a little bit of the teachings from Larkin Russell and Uriah Smith as we'll show in this series but as we'll also show brother Ram's Revelations were different from all three men now one simple example of this is from the seventh seal as brother Ram's accuser showed regarding the seven seal Clarence Larkin said quote the seven seal extends down to the ushering Inn of the Millennium to illustrate a rocket fired into the air May burst into Seven Stars and one of these Stars into seven other stars and one of the second group of stars into a third Group of Seven Stars end quote now let's listen to what brother Branham said of course brother random used some of the same terminology saying the ushering Inn of the Millennium and firing a rocket into the air let's listen to the quote [Music] it's just like fire rock and that rocket explodes here and it goes up then explodes again it puts out five stars one of those Stars exploded pulls out five stars submit Stars explodes moves out five stars cement see and Friends remember in 1964 brother Branham admitted that he read Larkin and other ministers writings about the Seven Seals as this quote from the Feast of trumpets clearly states let's listen to the quote leaving as much as I possible with them on the things that they had drawn up their conclusion uh I read the book of Mr Smith your eyes Smith which is the Adventist a teacher and um I read his uh his thoughts on it and I read Mr Larkin I'd read all so many different ones of their commentaries on this but somehow or other I thought I had a little view of it myself that might be of a piece is different but in every seven seal sermon except for the fifth and sixth seals which brother Reina mostly agreed with Larkin on but not completely brother Branham taught each seal differently in regards to the timing of the seal and or the identity of the writer of the horse and or the identity of the four beasts and also the identity of the souls in prison so the statement that everything brother Branham ever thought about the seals was different was just hyperbole it was an exaggeration it was not a thus say the Lord statement and of course brother Branham admitted he usually exaggerated numbers and we know he exaggerated certain statements but he was a man he was fallible all men do that all men make exaggerations and hyperbole so let's remember that as we move on into the Seven Seals the first seal let's begin with the accusation there is a four minute and 36 second video from April of this year 2022 that accuses brother Branham of stealing the first seal from Clarence Larkin and Charles Tays Russell of course this is not true brother random did agree with some of Larkin and Russell's work but not all the false accusation of plagiarism on the first seal is as follows quote what is clear is that William Branham did not have a special revelation of the first seal he stole it from Clarence Larkin and Charles Tays Russell and passed it off as though it was something brand new that he got directly from God a revelation that had been hidden before the foundation of the world but this is clearly not true end quote another sad part about this untrue YouTube video accusation is that brother Ram's accuser used Jeremiah 23 verse 30 to say God condemns brother Brandon because he stole his teachings from Larkin and Russell it's so sad that these accusers of brother Branham are condemning him for something he's not even guilty of and so brother Brandon's accusers are condemning him for something he's not guilty of what does that mean for them what kind of character do they have if they're falsely condemning someone of course that doesn't speak well to their character of course this accusation is false so let's begin by comparing brother Branham with Clarence Larkin so here's a screenshot of the accusers video where they try to say brother random plagiarize from Clarence Larkin as you can see on their screenshot they have three statements from Larkin this writer has a bow no arrows mentioned you can find this on page 53 of Larkin's book dispensational truth the next statement is this white horse rider is the Antichrist and you can find that on page 54 of Larkin's book the third statement is this white horse rider will be Satan Superman and that is also on page 54 of Larkin's work as you can see all these quotes from Larkin are accurate and brother Branham did use some of these quotes from Larkin but the difference between Larkin and brother Branham is brother branham's timing was nearly 2 000 years prior to Larkin's timing so here's the proof here you can see the screenshot of page 54. you can see the two places where brother Graham's accusers quoted Larkin but in between I have highlighted the portion brother Ryan's accusers left out now how could they point out two things Larkin said but ignore everything in between it seems the reason they could ignore everything in between the two statements is because they're trying to slander God's genuine Prophet brother Branham so let's read what Larkin said about the white horse rider quote in other words this white horse rider is the Antichrist he is the prince who is to come of Daniel's vision of the 70 weeks and who will confirm the Covenant for one week the last or 70th week with Daniel's people the Jews end quote now notice Larkin said the white horse rider is to come it was future tense brother Branham said the white horse rider was past tense 2000 years ago let me keep reading Larkin's work quote Daniel 9 27 this Covenant will probably be the privilege to return to Palestine and rebuild the Temple and re-establish their sacrificial form of worship and National existence in exchange for the financial assistance of the Jewish Bankers of the world in his schemes of establishing worldwide Commerce and the formation of a gigantic Corporation with its commercial center in the rebuilt city of Babylon so that no one can buy or sell unless they have his Mark the mark of the beast Revelation 13 verses 16-17 for we are told in Daniel 8 verses 23-25 that through his policy also he shall cause craft manufactories to prosper in his hand end quote now let's listen to brother Ram's quotes about his timing of the first seal brother Ram said the white horse rider started writing during the first church age brother Ram said the white horse riders started writing during the first church age which was either 30 A.D 33 A.D or 53 A.D depending on which coat you use from Brother Branham but either way 30 33 or 5380 is completely different to a time that's 2 000 years in the future let's listen to the quotes that was the birth of the church on the day of Pentacles then after the Ephesian Church age from 1853 I am A.D 170 then started in the Samaria Church now Jesus Messiah wrote Into the City of Jerusalem Triumph on the back of a white View on Palm Sunday April the 2nd 80 30. Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday 80 30. also brother Brandon said this white horse rider rode until the Roman Catholic church had power to kill with a sword which was around 385 A.D let's listen to brother Adam's quote from the second seal from 1963. power from the innocent wife to a bloody red watching now has come remember he's got a suit he's going for a sword in his hand riding red horse waiting to the blood of everybody who disagrees with him how do you understand it yeah how many understands what that seal is now all right but guys you can do some Stratos wow yeah it really arrives oh sure now he's giving great power and a great sword to kill now let's look at the identity of the writer Larkin said it was a literal person of the Antichrist on page 54 of Larkin's book he said the white horse rider is the literal person of the Antichrist to come in the tribulation he said quote in other words this white horse rider is the Antichrist he is the prince who is to come of Daniel's vision of the 70 weeks and who will confirm the Covenant for one week the last or 70th week with Daniel's people the Jews Daniel 9 27 end quote then in the next paragraph Larkin says the rise of the Antichrist will be some years before the Rapture because he has to reach a position of power to make a covenant with the Jews beforehand Larkin Roe quote the rise of this white horse rider necessarily antidates the beginning of the 70th week or the seven years of his Reign for he must have reached a position of power to make a covenant with the Jews at the beginning of the week but he does not become the Beast as described in Chapter 13 1-8 until the middle of the week that is until after Satan is cast out of the heavenlies and incarnates himself in him his rise to power and the rebuilding of Babylon will take time so the Rapture of the church will doubtless and to date the beginning of the week by some years end quote two paragraphs later Larkin wrote quote this white horse rider will be Satan Superman the scriptures clearly teach that there is some day to arise a human being who will be the embodiment of all satanic power end quote and remember this is different from Brother Branham brother Branham said the white horse rider was the Antichrist Spirit or the nicolaidan spirit not a literal man at first brother Ram said different brother Ram said the identity of the writer was the nickel Aiden Spirit or the Antichrist spirit here in the second seal by the ram said he was the nicolete in spirit to begin with let's listen to the quote [Music] in a man and that he was crowned and receive the throne and was crowned and Friends noticed brother Ram said this white horse rider was the Antichrist spirit in all the false churches as first John 2 Verse 18 says and brother Branham actually cited this verse in the first seal let's listen to the quote from the first seal where brother ramsites first John 2 verse 18. sit over here little children but she's already come and working in the children's what what to get the forearm in there the Nickelodeon Spirit to make an organization so as we conclude this section comparing Branham and Larkin we see brother Branham did not plagiarize Clarence Larkin both the identity of the writers were different and also the timing of the writers was different or the ram said the writer was the Antichrist Spirit or Nickelodeon spirit Larkin said the writer was the literal man of the future Antichrist brother Graham said the timing was either 30 33 or 53 A.D compared to Larkin who said it was still in the future it hadn't happened yet and we can see Larkin's timing for the first seal was almost a 2 000 year difference than brother branham's so brother Ram's accusers are false brother Brown did not steal the first seal from Clarence Larkin it is undeniable now let's compare William Branham with Charles Taze Russell here's a screenshot of brother Ram's accusers video where they claim brother Branham stole the first CEO from Charles Tay's Russell quote and behold a white horse and he that sat on him the bishop of Rome the embryo Pope the personal representative of Satan end quote that's from Charles Tay's Russell's book The finished mystery 1917 or 1918 depending on which source you use now friends let's see where brother rand's accusers got this reference it's from page 106 of Russell's book now you can see the two red arrows pointing to the two quotes brother Ram's accusers used but notice in between they left out the truth about what Russell really taught again this doesn't speak well to the research abilities and character of brother Ram's accusers they're picking and choosing which statements to cite from Charles Tay's Russell rather than looking at the whole of Russell's teaching Billy Graham said the White Horse represents a power a charger brother Brandon makes the White Horse and the white horse rider one in the same it's the Antichrist it's the Antichrist spirit but very good uh uh exclamation of it what a great event and he said I hear some white horse a white horse is a power charger and said the man that stood on that was the the White Horse or the Holy Spirit he said you have the books his hand in there who was the white horse rider hey so it wasn't the Holy Spirit white horse rider went out they went his mighty it is Conquering power it's a great boat it is Conquering power if you want me to tell you who he is he's the Antichrist that's exactly what he is now because you see if a Antichrist Jesus said that the two would be so close together and so it would just see the very elected divide is targeted Antichrist it's the Antichrist spirit now let's take a look at page 106 of Russell's work notice what brother Brown's accusers left out they left out this statement quote Behold a white horse the doctrine's teachings of the Lord and the apostles recognized as The One and Only Rule of faith and practice of God's Church end quote so Russell said the White Horse was the true doctrines and teachings of the Apostles brother random did not say that brother Branham made the writer and the horse the one in the same Antichrist power so why didn't Brothers accusers read that part of Russell's research it seems like they knew it didn't agree with brother Adam's teachings and they were trying to purposely slander brother Branham now we can see how brother Branham and Russell did not agree on the identity of the white horse now let's look at the identity of the writers Russell said the writer was the bishop of Rome the embryo Pope but again brother Rand said the writer started out as the Antichrist spirit that Saint John warned was already in the world in first John 2 verse 18. so the difference is Russell said it was the bishop of Rome one person and brother random said it was the Antichrist Spirit deceiving many during the first church age so this is not plagiarism let's look at the timing of Charles Tay's Russell's first seal now according to Russell's own writing Russell's first two seals started in 325 A.D and lasted to 539 A.D and now here's one more visual of how brother Ram did not plagiarize Russell's timing on the first seal brother random's first seal lasted from either 30 33 5380 to 385 A.D so it was well before Russell's first seal took place Russell's first two seals were from 325 to 539 A.D now what's interesting is that Russell places the timing of the first seal and second seal as nearly identical in the next two screenshots I will show how Russell said the first and second seals begin at the same time in 325 A.D here are the first screenshot shows how Russell said the first seal was beyond John's epic and of course John's epic was 73-325 A.D meaning the first seal began after 325 A.D quote and I saw John be held envisioned the first range and wonderful feature of the divine plan for the permission of evil as it related to epochs of the church age Beyond his own epic that of somernia end quote and notice here also Russell said the first seal began under the reign of Constantine which is again on page 106 of his book The Finnish mystery Russell said quote was given unto him under the reign of Constantine who murdered his own son in the same year in which he convened the Council of nice the opposition of the Empire to Christianity gave way to favor and the Imperial pontifus Maximus became the patron of the profess but really apostate Church of Christ end quote here in the second screenshot this shows Russell saying the second seal began in 325 A.D as well here's a quote from page 107 and Russell speaking of the second seal he says quote this period beginning with the year 325 A.D and extending to the year 539 was appeared in a formation of Creed's end quote so it's difficult to understand what Russell meant but he clearly said the first seal was beyond John's Epic and so the first and second seals have to begin at the same time according to Russell which was completely different from Brother Branham so here's a visual we can see John's epic which Russell said was Smyrna lasted from 73 to 325 A.D and here's pictures of Russell's book from page 27 where he says Saint John was the messenger to the Sumerian Church age which of course differed from Brother Branham and remember two things first brother Branham never made Saint John the Divine a messenger like Russell did and second brother Brandon made iranius the messenger to the Sumerian Church age not Saint John the Divine so there's two more proofs brother Braham did not plagiarize Charles Tays Russell Russell said quote to the second epic of the church was Saint John himself he was the one whom Jesus specially loved end quote and then a few paragraphs under a quote of the church in Smyrna as applied to the history of the church from A.D 73 to 325 is particularly appropriate end quote so you can see from Russell's own words the first seal was beyond John's own epic and there's a screenshot if you want to see that again I want to make an additional conclusion on the first seal brother Brandon's first seal showed the early church was anointed by the line anointing and brother Brandon said it was thus saith the Lord in the fifth seal 1963. let's listen to the quote remember all the days of your life see these feasts are correct it's thus saith alone brother Ram said the line anointing empowered the early Saints to save the world but Russell said the first seal was God apparently forsaking his church yet the Bible says God cannot forsake us in Hebrews chapter 13. Russell said God forsook his church when infinite Justice or the lying Beast was defeated by the ecclesiastical system let's read Russell's quote and show it on the screen quote thus we see the apparent defeat of an infinite Justice in this first epic apparently God forsook his church having jeopardized all its interests by placing the power in the hands of a self-seeking ecclesiastical system but worse things are coming end quote this is incredibly ridiculous of Russell to say that God would forsake his church and that the white horse rider the bishop of Rome could defeat God's line anointing and of course Russell was wrong but why didn't brother Ram's accusers share this about Russell's teaching if they're such great researchers such thorough researchers such honest researchers why didn't they share all these details from Russell's book because of course that would go against their narrative to slander God's Prophet brother Branham so the conclusion on Russell versus brother Branham regarding the first seal is that brother branham's first seal started nearly 300 years before Russell's first seal started and again in conclusion brother Brown said the writer was a spirit and then became a pope Russell said the writer was a man the bishop of Rome Russell never mentioned the Nickelodeon Spirit as the writer you can search his writings on page 106 107 and Beyond he never mentioned the nicolaitan spirit brother Graham said the White Horse was a deceiving Spirit while Russell said it was the exact opposite the doctrine of the Lord Jesus and the apostles so the conclusion is brother Brown did not steal the first seal from Charles Hayes Russell that would just humbly say shame on brother Brown's accusers for making such statements now let's compare brother Branham with Uriah Smith now we've already heard a lot about brother Brown's first seal so let's go right to Uriah Smith's writings this is from page 403 and Uriah Smith's book called Daniel and the Revelation 1897 page 403 quote the first symbol a white horse and the writer who Bears a bow and to whom a crown is given and who Goes Forth conquering and to conquer is a fit emblem of the triumphs of the Gospel in the first century of this dispensation the whiteness of the horse denotes the purity of faith in that age and the crown which was given to the writer and his going forth conquering and to make still further conquests the Zeal and success with which the truth was promulgated by its earliest ministers end quote so just for good measure friends I want you to see that the timing of your eyes Miss first seal was the same as brother branham's it was the Gospel in the first century but the identity of the writer is the exact opposite your eye Smith said the writer was the earliest Ministers of the gospel and we've already shown brother Ram said the writer and the horse was the Antichrist spirit so the conclusion on the timing and identity of the writer was brother and his first seal started the same as your eyes but brother Rams lasted much longer while the Rams first seal lasted to about 385 A.D Uriah Smith's first seal acid to the first century or about 100 A.D also brother random said the writer was the Antichrist spirit and then became a man and then a pope Uriah Smith said the writer was opposite from Branham a group of literal men the Holy Ghost filled Apostles during the first century so our conclusion is brother Ram did not plagiarize the first seal from Uriah Smith in closing friends I believe this video proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that brother Branham received his Revelation on the first seal from the Lord Jesus Christ brother Ram did not steal the revelation of the first seal from Clarence Larkin Charles Hayes Russell Nori Rai Smith we want to first thank the Lord Jesus Christ for the truth that he gave to his servant his true Prophet brother William Branham but we also want to pray for brother man's accusers so they'll repent of their dishonest research whether they're ignorant of it or whether it was purposeful so let's pray for them father God in all humility I just pray for these accusers of brother Branham or something's happened to them perhaps they have a complex or some evil spirit or lying Spirit has come upon them I pray Lord God they could recognize their faults and repent of their lives and their false accusations and their slandering Lord Jesus let the spirit of Truth come upon them and may they repent of their sins may they be honest about the truth that you revealed to your humble servant brother Branham Lord Jesus we're asking you to do it let thy perfect will be done and we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen looking forward to the second seal next by the grace of God friends if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
