[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:10] of the lord jesus christ the purpose of
[0:13] this video is to show that the new birth
[0:15] and the baptism of the holy ghost are
[0:17] one in the same
[0:19] recently a viewer asked me to make a
[0:21] video about this subject and after a
[0:22] prayer and waiting on the lord i felt
[0:25] led to do it because it's such a major
[0:27] important
[0:28] critical doctrine for the bride of jesus
[0:30] christ
[0:31] and for the church in general
[0:33] we know salvation is a major doctrine
[0:35] according to god's prophet brother
[0:37] branham and therefore the baptism of the
[0:39] holy ghost would also be a major topic
[0:41] as well because the baptism of the holy
[0:43] ghost is needed to go in the rapture
[0:46] according to matthew chapter 25 verses 1
[0:48] through 13
[0:49] and 1st thessalonians chapters four and
[0:52] five
[0:53] here's a summary of my explanation of
[0:55] how the new birth and the baptism of the
[0:57] holy ghost are one in the same
[1:00] the new birth and holy ghost baptism are
[1:02] the same event in the soul of the
[1:05] believer
[1:06] and thanks to brother branham's
[1:07] revelation on the anointed ones at the
[1:09] end times that the holy spirit gave to
[1:12] him we know there is also a filling or
[1:14] baptism of the holy spirit in the human
[1:17] spirit or mind which is the second realm
[1:20] of man because man has three realms or
[1:23] parts to his being according to first
[1:25] thessalonians 5 23
[1:27] here's a visual
[1:28] and the very god of peace sanctify you
[1:30] holy and i pray your whole spirit that
[1:34] your human spirit or mind
[1:36] and soul
[1:37] that's the core of your being where free
[1:39] moral agency is located as well
[1:42] and body your flesh body
[1:45] be preserved blameless unto the coming
[1:47] of our lord jesus christ
[1:49] god's revelation of this hour tells us
[1:52] there are two kinds of fillings or
[1:54] baptisms
[1:55] there is one filling in the human spirit
[1:58] and then a different filling in the
[1:59] human soul
[2:01] the most important filling or baptism
[2:04] of the holy ghost is in the soul of the
[2:06] believer
[2:08] for when you have that baptism you are
[2:10] sealed or marked by the holy ghost
[2:13] unto the day of your redemption
[2:15] according to ephesians 4 verse 30.
[2:18] this video will fully show how the
[2:20] baptism of the human spirit was
[2:22] available in the old testament and is
[2:24] still available today but there's a
[2:26] greater baptism today that's the baptism
[2:28] of the holy ghost in the soul
[2:31] let's begin by looking at quotes from
[2:33] brother william branham god's prophet
[2:36] what will help most of our viewers is
[2:38] the fact that brother branham taught the
[2:39] filling and baptism of the holy ghost
[2:42] were different events before he preached
[2:44] the seven seals in 1963
[2:47] and then afterwards he taught that they
[2:49] were one in the same
[2:50] so again brother branham grew in his
[2:52] understanding of the baptism of the holy
[2:54] ghost before he preached the seven seals
[2:57] he thought they were two different
[2:58] events the filling was different from
[3:00] the baptism
[3:01] but after the seven seals were loose
[3:03] from the book and the full revelation of
[3:05] god was given to brother branham he
[3:07] understood that the sealing of the holy
[3:08] ghost was the same as the filling and
[3:11] baptism
[3:12] and that event takes place in the human
[3:14] soul in the new testament
[3:16] this first quote is brother branham's
[3:17] previous teaching on how the filling and
[3:20] baptism were different let's listen to
[3:22] the quote
[3:24] i never thought there's a person believe
[3:25] that like me though this morning i heard
[3:27] charles fuller as it's going down he
[3:29] believes too that the new birth is not
[3:31] the baptism the holy ghost the new birth
[3:33] is being born the holy ghost is a
[3:35] baptism
[3:39] now here's the quotes showing the
[3:40] filling and baptism are one in the same
[3:43] from the church age book
[3:45] so when i invite those who are
[3:47] spirit-filled to come and deal with
[3:48] those who have answered the invitation
[3:50] to receive the spirit
[3:52] these dear ones surge forward and deal
[3:54] with the people in such manner as to
[3:55] encourage them to yield to god and
[3:58] believe to speak in tongues
[4:00] this has caused a great deal of
[4:02] confusion
[4:03] and i want to tell you exactly what i
[4:05] mean
[4:06] i mean for the sinner to come forward
[4:08] and be born again which is to be
[4:10] baptized into the body of christ by the
[4:12] holy ghost which is exactly what took
[4:14] place at pentecost when the church was
[4:16] launched
[4:17] in other words to be born of the spirit
[4:19] is to be truly baptized with the holy
[4:21] ghost
[4:22] it is one and the same
[4:26] what is the baptism with the holy ghost
[4:28] it is the spirit baptizing you into the
[4:30] body of christ it is the new birth
[4:33] it is the spirit of god coming in and
[4:35] filling you after you have repented
[4:37] having heard his word and been baptized
[4:40] in water as an answer of a good
[4:42] conscience toward god
[4:45] despite what some people say about the
[4:46] church age book it was and is a powerful
[4:50] book brother branham said on tape that
[4:52] the church age book was so biblically
[4:54] clear that readers would understand deep
[4:56] doctrines like the book of life if they
[4:58] had any light of god in them at all
[5:01] let's listen to the quote
[5:04] there comes your name on the book see
[5:06] you guys
[5:13] he's grammarizing this book of the seven
[5:16] church ages and the
[5:17] problem come up the question about your
[5:19] name taken off the lamb's book of life
[5:21] it's part of a lot of ministers so once
[5:23] you get the book you'll understand if
[5:25] you got any light in you
[5:27] notice
[5:28] now you'll turn your head won't even
[5:30] look at it
[5:31] if you don't want to see it like my
[5:33] mother you say you can't get blood from
[5:34] a turnip because there's no blood in it
[5:37] branham fully supported the church age
[5:39] book and its revelations about the
[5:41] messages and messengers to each church
[5:44] age that he said he'd stand at the day
[5:46] of judgment for the book let's listen to
[5:49] the quote and consider the magnitude of
[5:51] this statement
[5:53] in my book you'll all be drawn out in
[5:55] the seven churches which he told me
[5:57] which i stand by as a witness to god to
[6:00] be judged in their judgment party it
[6:02] comes from god not from my faith
[6:06] after the opening of the seven seals you
[6:07] can look at quotes from brother branham
[6:09] and see how he used new birth and
[6:12] baptism of the soul interchangeably
[6:15] let's listen to this first one from a
[6:19] instance i paradox that every born-again
[6:21] member of the body of christ is a
[6:24] paradox in themselves
[6:26] i believe each one of you methodists and
[6:29] presbyterian and lutheran
[6:31] that never had experienced the baptism
[6:33] of the holy spirit
[6:35] was in some formal church that did not
[6:37] believe in the genuine new birth and has
[6:40] now received the baptism of the holy
[6:42] ghost is a perfect example of a paradox
[6:47] they because something happened to you
[6:48] that changed your whole being
[6:52] and anyone could look at that and know
[6:54] that what a paradox is america
[6:59] the next one is a quote from the token
[7:03] when god has given you the true baptism
[7:06] of the holy spirit
[7:08] then the life of jesus christ is within
[7:10] you
[7:11] now that's true every theologian i have
[7:12] to admit that to be this it's a new
[7:14] birth
[7:15] you're born anew of the holy ghost and
[7:17] because a god has did this and you know
[7:20] you're no good in yourself and you
[7:22] accept what god has did then he sealed
[7:24] you into his kingdom by the holy spirit
[7:29] here's a brother random quote from
[7:31] modern events made clear by prophecy
[7:32] from 1965
[7:34] you'll hear brother adam say how your
[7:36] human spirit or mind can be filled with
[7:38] the holy spirit and then that anointing
[7:41] can leave and you would be lost
[7:43] there are numerous quotes like this
[7:45] after the seven seals because that was
[7:47] when the full revelation began being
[7:49] open to brother branham
[7:54] this many people just can't believe it
[7:56] even spirit spirit-filled people
[7:58] of course give you one little choke the
[8:00] baptist the holy ghost don't mean you're
[8:01] going in not at all and you're not gonna
[8:04] have don't have to do your soul that's a
[8:05] baptism
[8:07] here's the inside soul in here that has
[8:09] to come from god but then on the outside
[8:11] you have five senses and five out inlets
[8:14] to your contacts you're looking on the
[8:16] inside you have a spirit and in there
[8:18] you have five outlets your conscience
[8:19] and love and so forth five outlets to
[8:22] that spirit remember in that spirit you
[8:25] can be baptized for the genuine spirit
[8:27] of god and still be lost it's the soul
[8:29] that lives
[8:31] that was ordained of god didn't jesus
[8:33] say many will come to me that day and
[8:35] said lord have i cast out devils
[8:38] done great mighty words prophesied the
[8:40] great gifts of god he said depart from
[8:42] you that work iniquity i never even knew
[8:44] you
[8:46] many will come in that day didn't care
[8:47] this is prophesying
[8:49] he was the devil we find out later
[8:52] tonight
[8:53] a great man was supposed to be great
[8:55] leaders in that days with humility and
[8:56] everything else but failed to see the
[9:00] word of god itself may manifest before
[9:02] them
[9:04] we could just take a bunch of i got
[9:05] rolled down here how about balaam
[9:08] this powerful statement from brother
[9:10] branham that a person can be justified
[9:12] and sanctified but then lose their
[9:14] salvation
[9:15] is fully backed up by scripture because
[9:17] hebrews 10 29 says a person can be
[9:20] sanctified which is the second work of
[9:22] grace
[9:23] and then trodden underfoot the son of
[9:25] god which means to blaspheme the holy
[9:27] ghost so this means if a person was
[9:29] sanctified it can only mean their human
[9:32] spirit or human mind was anointed by the
[9:34] holy ghost but not their soul
[9:37] and of course judas iscariot is a good
[9:39] example of this no doubt he was
[9:41] justified and sanctified but then
[9:43] towards the end of his life he
[9:44] transgressed the word of god sold out
[9:47] his soul and satan filled his heart and
[9:49] the bible said he went to his own place
[9:51] in acts chapter 1. he forfeited his own
[9:54] salvation and was lost
[9:56] hebrews 10 29 says of how much sore
[9:58] punishment suppose ye shall he be
[10:01] thought worthy who hath trodden
[10:02] underfoot the son of god and hath
[10:04] counted the blood of the covenant
[10:06] wherewith he was sanctified
[10:08] an unholy thing and hath done despite
[10:11] unto the spirit of grace
[10:13] another hebrew scripture teaches this
[10:15] reality as well in hebrews chapter 6
[10:18] verses 4 through 6 which says a person
[10:21] can crucify to themselves the son of god
[10:23] or the holy ghost and be lost even after
[10:26] partaking of spiritual blessings of the
[10:28] holy ghost
[10:29] for it is impossible for those who were
[10:31] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[10:33] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[10:36] the holy ghost and have tasted the good
[10:38] word of god and the powers of the world
[10:40] to come if they shall fall away to renew
[10:42] them again unto repentance seeing they
[10:44] crucified to themselves the son of god
[10:46] afresh and put him to an open shame
[10:49] i believe in my humble opinion that the
[10:52] reason brother brahm changed his
[10:53] thinking about the new birth and the
[10:55] baptism of the holy ghost
[10:57] is because he had to receive the
[10:58] revelation of this subject
[11:00] this subject is specifically called a
[11:02] mystery by paul in the bible in
[11:04] colossians 1 verses 26 and 27
[11:08] even the mystery which hath been hid
[11:10] from ages and from generations
[11:12] but is now made manifest to his saints
[11:15] to whom god would make known what is the
[11:16] riches of the glory of this mystery
[11:19] among the gentiles which is christ in
[11:21] you the hope of glory
[11:23] so the phrase christ in you is a
[11:26] synonymous phrase for the new birth or
[11:28] the baptism of the holy ghost in the
[11:30] soul
[11:30] it's synonymous for being born again as
[11:32] well
[11:34] the revelation of the mystery of
[11:35] godliness unlocks salvation in the old
[11:38] testament
[11:40] as we just explained the revelation of
[11:42] the mystery of christ in you or the
[11:44] baptism of the holy ghost helps unlock
[11:47] another bible mystery which is the
[11:49] mystery of godliness
[11:51] or how god restores godliness to man
[11:54] as brother branham taught this and
[11:56] listed it as schofield's eight mystery
[11:59] in 1962
[12:02] in the sermon is this the sign of the
[12:04] answer
[12:05] let's listen to the quote
[12:07] the seventh mystery
[12:09] is our
[12:10] god even christ
[12:13] as the
[12:16] incarnate fullness of the godhead
[12:19] embodied in whom all divine wisdom and
[12:23] godliness is restored to man
[12:26] ninth mystery
[12:27] is the mystery of iniquity found in
[12:30] second thessalonians
[12:31] and so forth the tenth mystery is of the
[12:35] seven stars of revelations 1 20 we just
[12:38] been through that the seven stars of the
[12:40] seven churches and seven messengers and
[12:42] so forth
[12:44] in the mystery of godliness which is
[12:46] found in first timothy 3 16
[12:49] god restores godliness or god's
[12:51] character qualities to man through the
[12:54] three works of grace which are
[12:55] justification sanctification and the
[12:58] baptism of the holy ghost
[13:00] in the first two stages of grace
[13:02] justification and sanctification god
[13:04] builds a believer's character through
[13:06] his character virtues or attributes
[13:09] which peter lists in second peter 1
[13:11] verses 5 through 7.
[13:13] and beside this giving all diligence add
[13:15] to your faith virtue and to virtue
[13:18] knowledge and to knowledge temperance
[13:21] and to temperance patience and to
[13:22] patience godliness and to godliness
[13:25] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[13:27] kindness charity
[13:30] when a believer is justified he has the
[13:32] anointing of faith
[13:34] in sanctification the believers anointed
[13:36] with virtue knowledge temperance
[13:38] patience godliness and brotherly
[13:40] kindness
[13:41] so there is one holy ghost anointing for
[13:43] justification
[13:45] and there are six anointings for
[13:46] sanctification
[13:48] so the longer you serve god faithfully
[13:49] the more anointings god gives you and
[13:52] they're all just more anointing of the
[13:53] holy ghost
[13:55] lastly in the third work of grace the
[13:57] believer is capped off or sealed by the
[13:59] baptism of the holy ghost in his soul
[14:02] which is also called charity by peter
[14:05] and this is god's own spirit because god
[14:07] is charity god is love
[14:10] this revealed mystery now helps explain
[14:12] why old testament saints could not be
[14:14] baptized with the holy ghost
[14:16] in their souls
[14:18] meaning they could not have the new
[14:19] birth
[14:20] just as jesus taught in john 7 verses
[14:23] 37-39
[14:25] in the last day that great day of the
[14:27] feast jesus stood and cried saying if
[14:29] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[14:31] drink
[14:32] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[14:34] has said out of his belly shall flow
[14:37] rivers of living water but this spake he
[14:39] of the spirit which they that believe on
[14:42] him should receive so notice jesus is
[14:44] speaking of future receiving of the holy
[14:47] ghost which was fulfilled in acts
[14:49] chapter 2 verse 4.
[14:51] let's finish verse 39
[14:52] for the holy ghost was not yet given
[14:55] because that jesus was not yet glorified
[14:58] old testament saints could not be filled
[15:00] with the holy ghost in their souls
[15:02] because their sins were under animal
[15:04] blood
[15:05] but after jesus raised from the dead new
[15:08] testament saints could have the baptism
[15:09] of the holy ghost in their souls again
[15:12] here's the diagram of the three parts of
[15:14] man the old testament saint could only
[15:16] have the holy ghost on their flesh body
[15:19] like samson had a powerful anointing to
[15:21] defeat one thousand philistines
[15:24] and lift up and carry away the gates of
[15:26] a city
[15:27] old testament saints could also have the
[15:29] anointing on their human spirits or
[15:30] minds which is how they could prophesy
[15:33] or write many chapters of the bible
[15:36] without one word failing and without
[15:38] making any mistakes
[15:40] this means any believer before the day
[15:42] of pentecost other than jesus christ
[15:45] could not have the baptism of the holy
[15:47] ghost in their souls they could only
[15:49] have the feeling of the holy spirit in
[15:51] their human spirits or minds
[15:55] old testament saints could have the
[15:57] anointing of the character qualities of
[15:59] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[16:01] patience godliness and brotherly
[16:03] kindness
[16:04] but they can never be baptized with the
[16:06] holy ghost in their souls according to
[16:08] john's revelation in john 7 verse 39
[16:12] so anytime the old testament or the four
[16:14] gospels say someone was filled with
[16:16] god's spirit
[16:18] it means they were filled in their human
[16:19] spirits or minds their minds were
[16:22] anointed with the holy ghost not their
[16:24] souls
[16:25] here's an excerpt from my 2021 book
[16:28] where i deal with this subject from
[16:30] pages 353 to 360.
[16:33] this is not the whole section just a few
[16:35] paragraphs
[16:37] old testament examples of the temporary
[16:39] anointing
[16:40] now that you've learned the human spirit
[16:42] the second part of your being is only
[16:44] anointed temporarily by the holy ghost
[16:47] you can understand old testament bible
[16:49] examples referring to believers being
[16:51] filled with the holy ghost
[16:53] you know these temporary fillings only
[16:55] anointed their minds not their souls
[16:58] because jesus was not yet glorified
[17:01] pharaoh recognized god's spirit in
[17:02] joseph in genesis 41 verse 38 saying can
[17:06] we find such
[17:08] a one as this is a man in whom the
[17:11] spirit of god is
[17:12] in exodus 28 verse 3
[17:15] wise hearted jews were filled with the
[17:16] spirit of wisdom in order to make
[17:18] aaron's priestly garments
[17:20] bezellio was filled with the spirit of
[17:22] god in all manner of workmanship to help
[17:25] build the tabernacle of moses
[17:27] but it was his human spirit that was
[17:29] filled with god's spirit not yet his
[17:32] soul because hebrews 10 verse 4 says it
[17:34] was impossible for the blood of bulls
[17:36] and goats which sacrifices he was living
[17:39] under to take away his sins
[17:42] numbers 14 verse 24 says caleb had
[17:45] another spirit with him which caused him
[17:47] to follow god fully in the days of
[17:49] joshua
[17:50] in numbers 27 verse 18 joshua had god's
[17:53] spirit for the lord told moses take thee
[17:56] joshua the son of nun a man in whom is
[17:59] the spirit and lay thine hand upon him
[18:02] micah knew his mind was filled with
[18:04] god's spirit saying but truly i am full
[18:07] of power by the spirit of the lord and
[18:09] of judgment and of might to declare unto
[18:12] jacob his transgression and to israel
[18:14] his sin
[18:16] all prophets had god's spirit
[18:18] temporarily anointing them
[18:20] numbers 11 verses 25 through 29 shows
[18:23] how god put a portion of his spirit that
[18:25] was already upon moses on 70 elders
[18:29] causing them to prophesy without ceasing
[18:32] additionally the revelation of godliness
[18:35] helps us understand that john the
[18:36] baptist elizabeth zacharias and others
[18:39] in the four gospels were not yet born
[18:42] again in their souls but their human
[18:44] spirits were filled with the holy ghost
[18:47] again proven by the authority of john 7
[18:50] 39
[18:52] i'll read another portion from my 2021
[18:55] book on pages 360 and 361
[18:59] new testament examples of the temporary
[19:01] anointing
[19:03] john the baptist and his parents
[19:05] zacharias and elizabeth are three new
[19:07] testament examples of the temporary
[19:09] anointing of god's spirit
[19:11] technically the new testament did not
[19:13] begin until after jesus death and
[19:15] resurrection
[19:17] hebrews 9 verses 16 and 17 validates
[19:20] this saying
[19:22] for where a testament is there must also
[19:24] of necessity be the death of the
[19:26] testator for a testament is of force
[19:29] after men are dead otherwise it is of no
[19:31] strength at all while the testator
[19:33] liveth
[19:34] these three individuals are classified
[19:36] as new testament examples
[19:38] because their temporary anointing is
[19:40] recorded in luke's gospel which is
[19:42] considered part of the traditional new
[19:44] testament canon
[19:46] luke chapter 1 records john and his
[19:48] parents being filled with the holy ghost
[19:50] luke 1 verse 15 says
[19:52] for he john
[19:54] shall be great in the sight of the lord
[19:56] and shall drink neither wine nor strong
[19:58] drink and he should be filled with the
[19:59] holy ghost even from his mother's womb
[20:03] speaking of elizabeth luke 1 verse 41
[20:05] says and it came to pass that when
[20:07] elizabeth heard the salutation of mary
[20:10] the babe leaped in her womb and
[20:12] elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost
[20:14] luke 1 verse 67 mentioned zechariah
[20:17] saying and his father zacharias was
[20:19] filled with the holy ghost and
[20:20] prophesied
[20:22] weigh these three experiences with
[20:24] jesus's words in john 7 39
[20:27] but this spake he of the spirit which
[20:29] they that believe on him should receive
[20:31] for the holy ghost was not yet given
[20:34] because that jesus was not yet glorified
[20:37] based upon the messiah's declaration
[20:40] john and his parents were temporarily
[20:42] filled with the holy ghost in their
[20:43] human spirits or minds and not in their
[20:47] souls additional proof is found in
[20:49] john's doubt of christ as messiah
[20:53] matthew 11 verses 2 and 3 reads now when
[20:56] john had heard in the prison the works
[20:57] of christ he sent two of his disciples
[21:00] and said unto him art thou he that
[21:02] should come or do we look for another
[21:04] the pressure stress and agony of prison
[21:07] life had caused john to doubt his
[21:09] earlier experience of seeing the holy
[21:12] ghost ascend and remain upon christ at
[21:14] his baptism that he performed
[21:17] john could doubt his supernatural
[21:18] experience because his soul was not
[21:20] sealed
[21:21] indeed john lacked the greater power in
[21:23] his soul to be an unwavering witness
[21:26] that only the holy ghost baptism could
[21:28] provide
[21:29] acts 1 verse 8 identifies this power
[21:31] saying but ye shall receive power after
[21:34] that the holy ghost has come upon you
[21:36] and ye shall be witnesses unto me both
[21:38] in jerusalem and in judea and in samaria
[21:41] and unto the uttermost part of the earth
[21:45] three other new testament passages teach
[21:47] of the temporary anointing of god's
[21:49] spirit upon the human spirit or mind
[21:52] matthew 7 verses 21 through 23
[21:55] show that many persons who had god's
[21:57] anointing temporarily will be lost and
[22:00] sent to hell because they chose to work
[22:02] iniquity rather than righteousness
[22:05] two of jesus's parables give us more
[22:07] information about this fact
[22:09] and those parables are called the we and
[22:11] the tares and the net cast into the sea
[22:14] hebrews 6 verses 4 through 8 describes
[22:16] wicked people who temporarily enjoy the
[22:19] blessings of the holy spirit the hebrews
[22:21] author clearly states these reprobates
[22:23] can be enlightened of the spirit taste
[22:25] of heavenly gifts partake of the holy
[22:28] ghost but still fall away from living a
[22:30] true christian life
[22:32] lastly hebrews 10 verses 26 through 29
[22:35] speaks of those who sin willfully after
[22:37] receiving the knowledge of the truth
[22:39] god's judgment and fiery indonation
[22:43] is against those who serve god with his
[22:44] anointing long enough to be sanctified
[22:47] but then trot and underfoot the son of
[22:49] god and live despite the spirit of grace
[22:55] in closing
[22:57] i hope this video has been a blessing
[22:58] friends and i hope it's proved fully by
[23:01] the scriptures by brother madam's quotes
[23:03] using the understanding from john 7 39
[23:06] that the new birth and baptism of the
[23:08] holy ghost are the one and the same
[23:10] event in the soul of the new testament
[23:12] believer
[23:13] yes no doubt there are many church
[23:15] members today around the world who have
[23:17] been filled with the holy spirit in
[23:19] their human spirits or minds
[23:21] but if they fail to go on in humility
[23:24] serving the lord daily repenting growing
[23:26] in the grace and knowledge of our lord
[23:28] jesus christ they will either turn into
[23:30] reprobates like the workers of iniquity
[23:32] and be lost or remain foolish virgins
[23:35] the rest of their lives not redeeming
[23:37] the time as paul says in ephesians
[23:39] chapter 5 paul said the wise virgins
[23:42] redeem the time
[23:44] ephesians 5 16 and 17 clearly state this
[23:48] redeeming the time because the days are
[23:49] evil wherefore be not unwise in other
[23:53] words do not be a foolish virgin
[23:55] but understanding what the will the lord
[23:57] is
[23:58] so all the believers who continue moving
[24:00] on in their walk with god keep
[24:02] progressing in revelation will receive
[24:04] the baptism of the holy ghost in their
[24:06] souls and then they will redeem the time
[24:09] they will walk circumspectly or exactly
[24:12] according to ephesians 5 15 and they
[24:15] will understand the perfect will of god
[24:17] as romans 12 verses 1 and 2 also states
[24:21] but foolish virgins can be saved but
[24:23] they won't do the perfect will of god
[24:25] they will be virgin or without idolatry
[24:28] to all the word that they've accepted
[24:30] but they'll still be foolish because
[24:32] they failed to recognize the revelation
[24:34] that god has given for this hour
[24:36] and that's the revelation god gave to
[24:38] his prophet brother william branham
[24:41] who pointed us to the absolute jesus
[24:43] christ who is the word of god
