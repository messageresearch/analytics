god today yes hallelujah amen you got your bible let's go to hebrews chapter one now lord willing and you all been sneaking around listening to my sermons and brother cam amen if you did i'm going to be bringing the same thing this morning you just have to be double blessed how about that but anyways i just felt to bring this to the little church this morning i thought this would be a good thing to talk about and that is the ministry of angels amen let's look here hebrews chapter 1 verse 6. how many believe in them hallelujah yes sir and their bible doctrine yes a bible doctrine even in hebrews chapter 1 verse 6 and also in verse 7. and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him yes now the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire notice this in christ the mystery brother said so my opinion the first thing that he made was angels heavenly father we are so privileged to be gathered into the house of the lord like this is such an honor for us glory thank you lord as we have experienced no doubt one of the greatest unsettling events more that any christian could experience and that was the closing of the temporary closing of these church doors father what a privilege it is to be able to gather back in them lord we so thank you for the privilege of being able to gather you genesis thank you lord as we open up the bible now and begin to look at some things from not only the scripture but for brother branham i'm praying that you will come and anoint every part of this lord that it will be a benefit to the body of christ yes as we commit the word to you now both speaker and listener in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen amen god bless you may be seated i'm going to shed this jacket because i'm a hot preacher and it's hot anyways we uh appreciate the lord but that's what happens when you live under holy ghost fire it gets hot sometimes amen that's right brother right so we appreciate the lord and just to let you know a little word about ourselves before we get started you know we haven't we haven't stopped traveling it hasn't shut us out and we we go about three weekends every month still the lord helping us to be able to get to little places and we're trying to be very wise just to let you know up front we've not been around not one person that has any dealings with coca has not been exposed to cove in any way whatsoever i wouldn't be here if i was i'd try to protect you all and myself and uh so the lord's helped us to you know kindly know ahead of time in different little places we had a meeting coming where uh just a day before the meeting or a day and a half for the meeting the brother called and said that some of the people had come down i ended up preaching over the phone to them folks and uh so we've been trying to be very smart now if you are in a condition you don't want to shake hands that's fine just wave at me and smile you know that's all right and uh i certainly understand that but anyways what we're trying to say is that the lord's blessed us throughout the last several months and we had we parked the van the third week of march and didn't move it again until the last weekend of may and uh you know some of the meetings they've been trickling but it's just because of the conditions of the churches and so uh continue to pray for us because i usually speak to you about mission work and some of the things we're doing in missions and what we've got going for the jesse now is we're working with some different brothers who's trying to do some virtual things to go out into those other countries since we can't physically travel and uh so you pray the lord will help us in that because if we can connect the zoom meetings and those type of things skype a lot more you know it's all free of charge and there's no cost associated except for you know somebody's internet bill or something like that but anyways we're trying to do that in the work of missionary we did make it to egypt this year as i told you great and uh god really blessed that meeting it was a wonderful time myself for the jason mars and who was the host of the meeting and brother dale smith and we went in there with brother ken um uh uh ken well kenny cats no not brother kenny no oh he's gonna hear this view and going to say how'd you forget my name anyway i used to go to lyman many many years ago and i see his face but i can't get a passport you see that's what happens hey man i rolled over to bed the other day and i said i i um you something like that anyway i'll think of it i'll call you all at 2 30 in the morning when i remember but anyways real quickly we're just we're just working that in for mission and we've done a few conventions this year uh virtually i participated in an international convention this year that went into about i think they said 16 or 17 nations around the world i had a great response out of that so you know just little things we're trying to do for the lord as we move forward into these things so if you pray for us if you will always continue to pray for the family we need it and as you can see my wife's not here but jesse knows what that's all about it's school time and she's she's working on her master's degree now she's trying to get to graduate school because the hope is to move up into an administrative type position after some years of teaching she got a couple more years to go before she gets what they call a professional license once she gets that then she can just go anywhere around the country and teach and wonderful so you all pray for her she's got quite the load because she has to teach both virtually and in person and it's double duty it's quite a bit and uh but anyways we're we're happy in the lord and very thankful for the way god's been moving for us and i sure appreciate you all his prayers and your support of us through the years and appreciate the opportunity to be here with you like we are right now all right that's all i wanted to show especially all right now let's go back to the scripture there and let's look at hebrews one and six now i just want to take that first verse for a moment and i just want to kind of introduce to you my setting as it was because uh initially when paul begins to bring this scripture together he starts speaking about the first begotten in the world and if you'll notice the first begotten end to the world was not the physical body of the lord jesus christ because we know that brother tells us in questions and answers that the son or the logos that proceeded out of god that was the first light or the first what we would say begotten out of god in other words this is the theophany or melchizedek that would later be seen as melchizedek that proceeds forth comes out of god it is in a way of saying the first begotten of the world and we know that this begotten this melchizedek then becomes jesus christ and now it's not one or two it's not a trinity or trinity but it's one god manifested all in all amen notice that the scripture that paul introduces here is that let all the angels of god worship him so then all of the focus of the angels of the lord then was upon worshipping almighty god now notice that angels then will be made spirits and his ministers a flame of fire so notice how paul kind of puts this together and then here we have another brand in christ the mystery so my opinion the first thing he made was angels so then we know that if god created this community of angels then the purpose behind this creation was not for eternal life and it was not for the purpose of having a uh just because god wanted as they say uh uh to build up his ego and wanted somebody to worship him but there was a purpose in the creation of these angels and you'll notice that the angels of god g-o-d which is an object of worship so not in the eternal form or the unseen form that could not be seen was not officially or considered to be god at that moment because as an object of worship he was not in an object form that could be worshiped so when god creates these angels and then moves into this logos then with jesse the angels hallelujah praise the lord now he is an object of worship so we see a picture now of how that god began in creation with these angels of the lord and how that he came into his own being in god because of these angels of god now peter tells us that there are elect angels so all of these angels that were created there would be a population among these angels that would be elect that could never fall that could never walk away from their position in god and there would be a community of them or a population of them amongst this community that would absolutely fall as satan would become through lucifer's deception and how that he changed everything in heaven and tried to pervert and switch the program around then lucifer the light bearer then becomes the devil then jude records to us that then these angels that once regarded in heaven now they fall and as they fall down from heaven hell is then created to house these demons so hell was not something created initially but then we know the bible said hell was created for the devil and his angels god's angels but his angels so we understand that according to jude then that there was real estate that each of these angels had had had possessed in heaven and all of them had a portion or something say a potion of real estate in heaven and this real estate was something that god had positioned them this is your place i will say on a one to ten scale if the angel was a nine or an eight or a seven whatever powers and gifts that was offered to this angel when he fell from heaven he did not lose sonship he did not lose relationship with god but he left the real estate or as jude says it their first estate that was in heaven or the first condition of these angels so then after falling from heaven if there was an eight or a seven or a one or a three or whatever there was they never lost their creative uh uh being what they were created to be whatever powers or abilities they had when they fell from heaven they come right on down and initially they kept all the same power and and ability that they had but yet now reserved as jude said under chains of darkness and this is why when brother bran would enter into the discernment he'd be standing on the platform and he'd look out over the platform maybe the patient on the platform and he would say i see a dark streak running between you and this person over here and them demons he said are calling for help so once they fell from their first estate and then fall into this place hell of the fifth dimension or the regions of the lost or on the countdown but then call it the horrible dimension then these demons take upon them a shroud of darkness these angels now go from being light and from light bearing now there's a shroud of darkness that falls upon them and now they're identified by this gifted prophet to see that dark streak that dark shadow the woman that had the cancer that was shadowed to death had the black hood over her now that signifies a separation from god because god is light and once they separated from god then there's no darkness in the lord so once they separate from the light then they fall under this shroud of darkness hallelujah that bastard listen to that slow amen now remember that once these angels then are housed in this fifth dimension now these angels that were holy and never smoked never drink never cursed never done any of these things now these demons have separated themselves from their position in god and their only end is the lake of fire remember an angel has no redemption whatsoever an angel cannot be saved an angel cannot be born again an angel cannot be convinced to change their ways whatever they are and whatever choice they make that's what they are even to this day right now yeah so all of those spirits over 6 000 years ago if you want to say it that way or ever how many tens of thousands of years ago it might have been this population of angels decided to follow lucifer and all of his lives i want you to think about something we talk about our battles and our trials down here in time but do you realize the actual first rebellion that ever what was constructed or put together the first protest if you want to say actually began in heaven amongst the angels of god right the first rebellious attitude the first rebellious spirit the first rebellious nature it manifested itself in heaven amongst these angels the first war that was ever thought between good and evil took place amongst these angels the first sin that was ever committed actually did not begin on the earth but sin actually began in heaven i'm bigger i'm brighter i'm better than everybody else and you know i'm so much like god i can handle this business all by myself some people still got that kind of idea themselves right but anyhow we need the lord's help no matter amen amen amen let me just be very plain to you i used to think when i was a boy i'm a new christian 1415 that uh you know i reach a spot in my life that i would come to the place to where i'd be able to handle the business and the closer i got to god the less i would need him and i'd have more authority and more power and i'd come to a place to where god wouldn't even have to step in i just have it all by the tail and know how to handle it i'm coming to find out amen been 30 years of the pulpit this coming june and 30 years serving the lord i've been saved going on 32 years but i received the holy ghost about 30 years ago and in that 32 year span that even going back to when i was six years old when i first felt the touch of the lord i can honestly tell you from a baby all the way up to right now a 43 year old man that i not only need him more and even more so than i thought but there's not a day of this life that i live in this life i can't wake up and say lord help me i can't go through the debt lord i need your strength i need your help i need your grace i can't live without it he's my focus on my purpose amen amen it should be ours as well don't you agree lord and i think so now remember that these angels of the lord them have certain characteristics about them that have been thoroughly identified in the bible though slowly hinted at throughout scripture i'll give you an example of what i mean we know pardon me that the angels of the lord can take on a natural characteristic and we didn't know this until later on but just look for example at the serpent when the serpent was standing there in the garden of eden we know that the devil actually took this being over and after using this serpent to convince eve to break the word of god then satan moves off of this serpent and then just goes right on to the next task of the next thing that he added his ambition so satan lucifer who was an angel actually took on a human form to speak to eve and to try to convince eve of what it was thank you of what it was that god was trying to hide from her as he said that god's trying to keep things from you you'll be as a god you'll know good and evil so it was an angel or lucifer or the devil taking a human form and coming down and manifesting himself through the serpent in his life then we know of course that in genesis 19 verse 1 that the two angels that moved down to sodom to go visit lot of course there's three angels initially the ones that uh come to abraham and when he sees those three he looks at three and calls him lord amen that's the true revelation of the god and i don't care what these critics and what these defectors and these people are trying to say and and i watched some of the debate the other night i was very thankful to the lord that somebody's speaking up against this nonsense but i don't care what that bunch is saying the very fact that you deny the very godhead of jesus christ you're a trinitarian you're a heathen and you need to repent and get saved amen and actually my message if i would have a message to send over to the critics of the defectors is this brother jesse let's not talk doctrine let's not talk brother brad let's not talk scripture let's talk about y'all getting saved because you behave like a bunch of humans live like a bunch of humans your life is not even scripturally right according to the bible i say i call you to repentance get saved get born again amen because you need the baptism of the holy ghost like one preacher that left this message said well it's not about what wine i drove about drinking wine it says about choosing which one i like the best you need to repent that's right some of these men cut their hair and wearing pants oh that's old testament yes but the scripture that they report all the time about brother branham being a false prophet his old testament amen so let's just be honest today amen what is it it's demon power it's the devil that moves on human beings to try to convince them just as satan the first angel did yeah the first demon did convince eve against the word so is these spirits in the last day doing the same things right amen amen i don't call men and things that have denied the message i listened to a man my mother and i was listening to a man this morning the one that wrote god's generals and he praised brother branham and put him on a very high pedestal and talked about what a great man he was and the gifts of god he said oh but when he got into that teaching of course they're trinitarians and they're baptized in trinity right all that of course they don't like that teaching because this is a bible doctrine that god is one not three yeah he is one yeah praise the lord thank you amen and if they plan on grabbing this clip and throwing it on their website so be it but i i'm not afraid to stand up for what i believe is bible christianity amen i believe in my heart that if a woman is a woman a man is a man we ought to dress like it act like that's like jesus have mercy like it amen so we realized then that these angels then took this human form and when these two angels then appeared down to lot lord said my lords that's a plural on that if you didn't get that amen and then notice that they were the angels of the lord that visited lot down in sodom all right now don't forget when you say well that's old testament seems to be the battle cry of people these days and they read the old testament well that's old testament yes but it's the bible yes and we believe in the old testament we know what yes if you want to understand the old testament you must filter it through the apostle paul that's god's filter for the new testament yes amen and paul was to teach us about mixing our clothing and about not eating you know animals with hor uh uh a a fort hood for food something i said amen poor tools or things of that like pig or something like that amen paul would have dealt with it in the new testament that was god's filter that was god's bridge to tell us what we were going to carry over and what was it amen the apostle paul come right over the new testament and teach a woman how to dress and how to be here amen he talked about marriage and divorce he talked about the difference between a woman and a man he said from the beginning it was not so that is a law now there's something to be carried over right amen they tell us what it's supposed to be so we say well paying tithes you know this is a thing an argument about well paying tithes is an old testament doctrine i understand what they're trying to say i get what they're trying to say but the silence of the scripture the fact that the new testament nor paul peter john or none of the rest of them condemn the offering of tithing into the house of god their silence is permission to what we're supposed to do today amen we're supposed to offer our tithes offer our offerings and give it into the storehouse that's not just one building in indiana that's wherever you get your passport right that's what the holy spirit amen amen amen that's right it's not supposed to go to new york or to go to arizona or go down here they're supposed to come where you get your father that's the pastor that preaches to you that's right now notice again angels can take on this human form and even did so in the new testament would you like to see that hebrews chapter 13 verse 2 now notice what the apostle paul said we believe the writer of hebrews is paul because his language and so forth is so much the same yes and notice he said be not forgetful to entertain strangers all right well paul tell us why for thereby some have entertained angels unawares now you know in this day and age if we walked out here we saw a big ufo going through it'd be on facebook tweeting we tweeted we twitter it we knew everything in the world it'd be all over the world before midnight we saw this unidentified flying object but i wonder sometimes if we don't miss the mark a little bit by god when he sends into the church house unidentified flying visitors right maybe to check and see what our attitude perhaps might be toward those individuals that will just come in unannounced maybe we'd have a type of spirit toward him to show him grace show him mercy show him love because remember the church is supposed to be a hospital where if you're sick you can come and find healing amen this is the the good the the parable of the good samaritan it is that pastor that brings them into the end and begins to bind up their wounds and bring them back to perfect amen amen the church is supposed to be a hospital but the church is also supposed to be a judgment seat then if the body of jesus christ assembled together as jesus said where two or three are gathered here in my name i'll be right here in the midst of that then not only is the forgiver here but the judge is also president setting up the door watching the motives and the objectives of the church remember that in the old testament the holy spirit said he would send evil angels among those people to test them and remember the prophet tells us in christ is the mystery that once the body of christ gathers as it were or collects himself around the message of the hour for their day and for their time he said that it goes good for a while he said but then all of a sudden evil angels or fallen angels he called it will come and get into that message and try to stir up all kinds of chaos and nonsense all right listen friends i'm going to be honest with you it does i i when i look at the people that have left this message and they deny the message and they think it's a bunch of nonsense i don't blame some people for being offended at the way they are i mean they've gone to churches and they have been so mistreated and and and judged and made fun of and all kinds of filth and things i circled through our ranks but listen to me don't blame that on william branham don't blame him [Applause] amen it's the devil of good evil influences that stirred up all of this mess that's got us in the condition we're in today amen that's why we need men of god to call it out that's right praise god we need a holy ghost son of god that's got a gift in his life that can step here in this platform and when he sees the devil moving identify it yes simply just identify the truth of what is amongst us whether it be good whether it be bad if we would simply take time to identify the spirit of god and the spirit of the devil then the people can rightly judge which way is which hallelujah yes one or two opinions many times brother because we don't have the right kind of orders from the pulpit yes sir and when we blend these things together and just preach happy messages and good one-liners and make everybody feel good and they go home they go home not knowing what the devil looks like that's right brother right it's the lord and you've got to identify it you've got to call these things out unless the people don't know what right and wrong looks like yes i mean i live in a world where every day of my life it is day and then this night yeah and yet when it comes to the pulpit we're supposed to preach the day and never talk about the night but yet i live in a world where there is somehow when it comes to the house of god we're just supposed to preach about red roses and pink bunnies amen the house of god is a judgment the two spirits would be so close as jesus remarked and he said but yet we as the bride in the last day would not only call it out but we would withstand what's the most amen and it's not just sin because william branham said it was sin it's not just sin because me or brother jesse or some other preacher said so it is sin because god in his word declares what is right and what is wrong amen now notice again in psalm chapter 8 verse 5 notice the bible speaking about jesus identifying that he was made a little lower than the angels now i'm going to take this in a certain way and i hope you understand my meeting i'm going to try to be very very gentle as i say this next remarks because we've got younger ears sitting in the church this morning but there is a reason that the lord jesus was made differently than the angels of god in other words there were no glands to make children and and and reproductive systems to make children in angels an angel cannot propagate their species right an angel has no ability amen to feel the call of being a father a man to marry a wife fall in love with a girl and and have a household full of kids you know three or four or eight or 12 or whatever whatever the likes of the number is and i i laughed to myself when i think uh about i i saw on facebook the number eight coming i laughed at myself and samantha when she lived in pennsylvania up there in albion you know there was a lady she was an amish lady that had 17 children amen and i got to laugh at it i told sam when i saw the announcement i said brother jesse's halfway there and then he's working he's working his way up jacob's lap that's right but oh you know may god bless you with a hundred more just like it i you got some good kids sitting here they love the lord and they try to serve the lord thank god for them thank you man they're little treasures yes he looks little but he's bad amen but if it meant defending his family maybe so who knows but however we see the holy spirit then banging into this understanding about angels that angels have no reproductive system within them now notice jesus then was made lower than the angels now let's catch this trail coming from the top moving down to the bottom the angels of god were made they had no glands in their lips they had no sexual reproductive system and so when they angel right and then jesus was made the angels he was made lower than the angels were they uh human type people sure they have like a uh physiology about like a man would have uh they have arms they have legs you know they can speak they have hair brother venom talked about when he saw the angel of the lord uh you know he didn't talk about the colors of their eyes and you know different things like that but yet they're not men in terms of there is no tree of knowledge of good and evil for an angel to partake of but a man was made jesus then was created under this sexual order all right now follow my thought now notice that in matthew chapter 22 verse 30 notice then that the bible now we went from the top to the bottom now we're going from the bottom back to the top now the bible said that once we are born again of the holy spirit then our bodies will be changed going back up now watch this from the resurrection though neither merit nor given in marriage now we understand what that means but he said as are the angels of god in heaven so notice that the angels of the lord i just want to take this for just a moment that the angels of the lord don't know what it means to fall in love they don't know what it means to as us brothers you know lay your eyes on that pretty girl and there's a little jump that takes place on the inside of it amen brother adam talked about that he said that whenever adam first looked at eve he said there was a little that moved in he said that set a strain down to humanity amen and and i remember you know the first time i had a little with sam you know i i i i just fell in love with her and and and i thought about her all the way home lieutenant went from tennessee back to ohio i thought about it the whole time couldn't get it off my mind amen it was just a a wonderful experience and and but an angel doesn't understand that they don't know what it means you know to long to have a conversation or want to sit down and talk to him a little bit more find out a little bit more about him angels don't get that but a human being is made with a certain physiology that their systems are under the order of the tree of knowledge of good and evil which we know is the sexual program right now remember even brother branham said because our whole system is made up under this order under these these orders of god that the day you eat there is the day you die remember that our bodies also bear because of reproduction it bears in our body the marks of iniquity that has come from generations of our family yeah so in my cells right now in my dna it is not only the sins of my father but it would be my grandfather and then all the way back so many generations come back to adam from the very beginning all of that sin chases down it branches out in many different fingers and splinters in different directions right until there is a a a combination of those things that have fallen into my body why because of the tree of knowledge of good and evil there are aspects of my temper that is probably just me but there's aspects of my temper that would be my granddad and my great-granddad and aunt suzabel and aunt lucy and uncle owen and whoever else is around amen and now i want you to pay attention now that the angels of the lord don't understand that they do not know what it means to be a product of generations of sin or disgrace or whatever it might be blessings on the other side so the angels of god them brother jesse have never smoked never drank never cursed never lied never committed adultery never had one sin that has been poured into their system through a reproductive system lord of those angels understand what it means to wrestle with mommies and patients right right or that is whatever his is you know they don't understand what that means now watch this to talk about justification as a child of god once i receive the holy ghost my soul is justified i am forgiven how as though it never took place in the beginning but when my body is changed watch what jesus said then i will be made just like the angels which are in heaven [Applause] amen amen [Applause] our bodies will be justified in such a manner that you won't have great granddaddy's impatience yes amen and if you struggle today we'll say with like temper you know i'm just using common average things but if you struggle with temper today that's not just your temper your fight that's years of generations of temper and anger and things that's been poured into you right brother scientists call it the grab bag of human life what a gift package and all of this that lays inside of you it's not just you that's battling yourself but you're battling generations of things but jesus said we would be made like the angels of god in heaven and did you know some of you boys and girls sitting here and i just say this for your benefit as much as the older ones here but you know brother man talked about not even a boy and girl kissing you know i read a study here the other day uh from some experts that were doing some scientific research about dna the passing of dna they took two individuals that were you know elementary school sweethearts or whatever they was and they took these individuals and they took swabs out of their mouth and so forth like that and they've done some testing to break down to see if they could catch the swapping of dna and if that dna still existed and so they took these two individuals they swabbed them out and they confessed you know that they had their first kiss maybe when they was 10 or 12 or what it was 40 years later they could still find the dna from the other person in their mouth 40 years later brother branham said it's a potential sex act it's potentially committing adultery and these people out here that say brother branham didn't know what he was talking about i'm sorry you don't know what you're talking about all right if science even proves some of these things are absolutely the truth that if a man or woman was to kiss one another remember brother battle said a man does that he's morally obligated to marry that woman and he should be he should be morally obligated to marry her morally now we're not talking scripture now but morally why because it is the passing of these genetics the dna showed up 40 years down the road 40 years they still had each other's dna in their mouths amen it goes to prove that our systems our bodies because we're made under the tree of knowledge of good and evil we are made to house the generations that's been poured into us amen and if that be the case i'll say this in a veiled way but what about all these men and women on friday nights and saturday nights and after football games and after uh bar nights and all of that what kind of a mix and conglomeration you think is going on in america today right right not to mention around the world what kind of things are being swapped and shared and all around and they might carry on about all of their their their great securities of how they protect themselves but brother at the end of the day it's more than just a physical act they're actually swapping out today right yes don't tell me there's not a hybridization going on that's going on right before our eyes yes sir i mean they advertise it they put it on billboards they show it because it's a tree of knowledge of good and evil but i like this in luke chapter 20 verse 36 jesus said that we cannot die anymore amen because we are equal unto the angels why our bodies then will be changed now watch and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection so our bodies then are changed into that infinite condition where there has never been one cell swap except for god amen god god god god god amen praise god praise god oh bless the lord and hallelujah amen bless the lord o my soul notice now angels do not have infinite knowledge yes did you know that yes sir look here in mark chapter 13 verse 32 but of that day and hour no man knows not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father all right so jesus said the angels don't know the day nor the hour here's another one in revelation chapter eight verse one when he opened up the seventh seal there were silence in heaven about the space of a half an hour and brother adam said the reason that took place is because the angels of god went completely mute because they never heard the mystery of god that was going forth like what they heard and they noticed that even if an angel would have flooded a wing might have given away a secret it's a god when he hollered out that lion roared out there everything went silent and they sat in all as they listened to the revelation coming forth the mystery that was going to break from that silence amen from the lion roaring and from the thunders and sounding their voices to break forth the revelation of what it was amen the angels of god kept themselves completely still and quiet now if they don't know the day nor the hours jesus said in matthew 24 36 no man knows the day nor the hour not the angels that are in heaven then you and i right now this very moment should be rejoicing until we lose our breath to know that satan who was an angel does not have perfect knowledge but because the angels don't know it they don't know what to do with them [Applause] it opens up the channel there to realize that that dumb old devil only knows what god lets you know hallelujah amen and safety with all of his wisdom still don't understand the great mysteries of this bible all right all right amen let me tell you something friends one reason that i get up here and preach like i preach and say the things that i say is because to me this message in this bible is more than a bunch of catchphrases and cliches right to me the message of the hour is a revelation of secrets [Applause] i believe those secrets are being revealed to us hallelujah amen and then these fellows they stand up oh you know brother brown just plagiarized larkin and that's all the message was to you you needed to get out that's right amen it's not just the repeating of a bunch of doctrinal phrases shame on you that's right i don't know better than that about the message of the hour i don't care who you are what your name is but let's learn the revelation you don't run a revelation god reveals himself yes there is amen unless god reveals it it's more than a collection of catchphrases yes sir this message is more just than just a well brother random he pulled from this and he pulled from that yes he did same as i do same as you do which one of you sisters in here hey man when you go to cook make cookies or bake a pie or do some kind of a recipe i don't know some of your brothers may cook too i don't know about you but when i pull a recipe i i go to find somebody that's done something with it i want to see what they've done amen and while i've got it in my hands i may realize they use too much lemon juice so i may tweak it the flavor may not be right with that much lemon juice i may change that around i would use less lemon juice that's all brother branham did he took all of these great mysteries of god that tasted good for the age they was all right i enjoyed amen but to them the flavoring of the hour of what jesus christ longer healed brother man would take him recipes and he would change them up so they'd have the right [Applause] and it tastes good before i couldn't read it with the right flavor that's right i think god was mad at me right remember brother said the same thing he said i used to think god was mad at me and jesus loved me until i realized they were the same thing what happened the recipe you know sometimes when you take a bitter taste and a sweet taste you think well that bitter taste is awful i'll give you an example who likes chocolate in here yeah you ever tasted cow coffee it's as bitter as almost chewing on the back of that that chair right there but you put some milk in it you put some sweetener in it and that bitter taste becomes what you were shooting your hand up about it because the recipe doesn't always mean that everything tastes good at the time so here you have martin luther he would serve up the dish he would have certain things that were right certain things that were wrong yes yes but the master chef of the last hour took all of the recipes [Applause] was it a good revelation right yes sir sometimes you have to understand that this messenger of god was not sent to come here and and and bring something new that wasn't brother branham's purpose he spent the first majority of his ministry we'll look at it this afternoon but he spent the majority of his ministry in the beginning just restoring back to the church hallelujah i want to give him a few years to really dig into the things that need to be done that's right brother yes and then he didn't fully do that himself he said i'm hitting the high spot he said you young people take this revelation dig into it bring it to revelation later what i'm trying to say hallelujah man when you stand up and say i've got 12 or 13 pages of notes left i believe with all my heart that's what we're getting now that's right of course but the same revelation hey so here the devil did not have infinite understanding of you and me that's right praise god praise god oh i thank the lord he studied me since i've been a boy he's watched me from birth all the way up to this time in my life now and he's trying to figure out every way in the world how to get me turned out that's right brother you don't know how to fight you don't know how to wrestle because every time he gets me in the corner jesus gets me out of infinite it god himself could not get me out of the troubles i was in but the dumb old devil oh yeah you say say that quietly no he's a dumb old devil you heard me i said louder he's a dumb old devil yes he is and this satan that we fight this all this super smart being he's as smart as dumb amen because here's the thing about it how in the world could god almighty how in the world could god almighty project his losing soul vividly and yet he still goes on today to me it's a dumb old devil amen now let's look here for just a few moments first peter chapter 1 verse 12. i'm not going to hold you alone this morning because we've got this afternoon coming amen and i i'm going to try to take this real slow now and just catch the whole meaning of this today in the message now watch in first peter chapter 1 verse 12 peter then speaking about the ministry yes well she said unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves in other words revelation didn't come because i read the bible yes yes hold on saying i went out there to study the scripture matter of fact paul spent all that time with gamalia and still had it wrong yeah that's right right in his own words he said i have paul he's nice assault sat at the feet of gamalia he learned all there was to know in that word he knew the upside down side left side right side but yet when it come to the revelation of the hour he went out to arabia for three years just to get all straightened out when he decided camellia and learned goodbye one hand cannot give another man of revelation praise god praise god one woman can't give another one vice versa okay revelation comes from almighty god so now watch they ministered unto us the things which are now reported unto you by them they have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven all right i want you to notice that this is real preaching preaching is not reading right preaching is not speaking preaching is a ministry to the body of jesus christ amen in other words if i'm preaching to you i am a ministry unto you yeah not just reading quotes that's right brother right a lot of people have got this wrong they think that ministry has standards i could take my scriptures out here and ask this brother to come and just read them for us that's not preaching right brother right he might have a nice speaking voice i might enjoy hearing his way of approach but that's not preaching right what you have is you have a lot of these individuals that are stepping into the pulpit now with a with an excited enthusiasm about what they know and what they believe but there is no ministry of the holy ghost behind amen amen that's what we're seeing yes amen good one miners is not gospel preaching that's right brother yeah i mean i've done all that i guess everything get saved get the holy ghost we're the bride we're going in the rapture glory to god same people that did all that glory to god stuff there's about half of them are backslid today most people know the bible right right they don't even understand the message of the hour yes sir unless they couldn't take their bible leave nobody how to get saved because they don't know how to get saved themselves that's right all that stuff is just intellect that just proves you can read yes sir that's all it is amen but a revelation from the holy spirit sent down from heaven watch which things the angels desire to look into yes amen and the word look that peter uses here is actually to stoop or to bow or to bend down in order to look at a thing so these angels of god that have watched over you your entire life yes hasten your birth yes with you remember brother and talked about that little sweet spirit that come near your mom i realize that was you but it was also these angels of the lord good heavenly presence and remember everybody has this yes sure when they come to this world everyone has an angel that watches over them until they come to the age of accountability once they come to the age of accountability and they step before god and god sets them like zacchaeus as the brothers said their brother cams the other day you know you talk about zach is sitting in those trees he said the place where two pla that point where two places meet you know he had to make a decision comes out of god glory but god commissioned these angels to serve right now i want you to think about something for a minute how in the world then if god is omniscient meaning that god cannot be everywhere but god knows everything how does the lord help us if you can't be everywhere at the same time i always used to wonder about this another who preaches things he's on omnipotence he called her a nepotin is the word and i've been being you know omnipotent or as he would say omnipotent you know and and he knows the end from the beginning how does god help us then well here's the way the angels of the lord yes he sends his help to the angels of god amen now i want to show that to you these angels of the lord in matthew chapter 4 verse 11. i've read this to you before but i want to bring this back in light of what we're talking about notice when jesus is in fights that's plural fights i said he's on the mountain next time he's down here and he's over there he's on the pinnacle the temple is everywhere now the angels of the lord if you'll notice them they come after the devil leaves him notices the devil leaves him and that's a pretty good thing and the devil leaves yes yes and behold the angels came and ministered unto him this word minister means to wait at a table and offer food and drink to guests so the angels of the lord are like your waiter yeah anybody ever been to a restaurant and somebody walks up there hello my name is juan or my name is julio or my name is jessie or whoever you are you know i just want to say uh welcome to our place and you know and so forth and can i take your order well the angels of the lord the same word that jesus that matthew uses here about the angels ministry is the same word we would use for a waiter now notice if that be the case then the angels of the lord are acquainted with our lives but they don't fully understand redemption so peter said they look what's going on with those people it's something that they see you on a bar stool or in a church house or everywhere you was maybe on a football field or you know whatever you used to on a track or some kind of thing and they've watched you your whole life and they see your ambitions and what you got your focus on and then you get saved amen and then you get born again amen the little revival that we had here a number of years ago and and and you folks were coming to the message of the hour you know and and receiving the lord as your savior and receiving the holy ghost and gifts and things falling amongst the body them angels just went wow no wonder god give him that good throwing arm he's going to have to throw that holy ghost seed out there all that but they watched you right brother i understand what you're all about but they don't understand the redemptive part of you yes because they're made to serve yes sir they don't understand what redemption is wonderful yeah i had a couple tell me some time ago about this they said brother man that makes me nervous i don't like to be watched i said what if i'm in the bathroom or in the shower or something like that i said that you the lady and her husband asked me some of the angels watching this while we're you know uh washing our hair and things like that i said listen sister i said she was the nervous one about it i someone asked you a question she said yes i said do you ever go into a restaurant and the waiter takes your order and then you start entering into a serious conversation i said does the waiter stand over the top of you and listen take notes she said no it doesn't i said what does he do he goes back in the corner and minds his own business until he's needed because he's a servant i said amen many of these angels of god are not created in a way to understand romantic things or or you know the physiology of a body they could not relate with what it means that's right for the urgency of need to go to bathroom yes sir but it's made in such a way to even understand that that's right so even if they were looking right at you they ain't got no clue what's going on that's right but they don't because they have that gentlemanlike nature given by the holy spirit and they don't move until they're called forth amen i remember what the bible said you have none yeah good brother because you ask not good so if you're a little low on spiritual holy ghost juice or if you're sitting at the table of god and you ain't got no fork and you ain't got no straw all you gotta do is call for these servers i need more i need a refill of the whole amen i need a refill of joy i need a refill yes hallelujah we only do this because it's the service of god not because it's a worship of angels hallelujah we do not worship angels yes sir would you like to see that that's in colossians chapter 2 verse 18. paul said let no man beguile you of your reward and a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels we do not worship angels but we do give credit where credit is due yes sir yes sir these angels of the lord were created to meet as you say well there must there's a lot of people seven billion people in this world or eight billion whatever it is and all these people in the world how all of these angels we've run out of angels oh i'm so glad you said that to me amen remember that when these demons fell from heaven that there were two hundred thousand thousand demons remember that two hundred thousand thousand demons but then when paul speaks about the angels of the lord in hebrews 12 he said we are in incompass i can't ever get that word right but we are we in other words they surround us they they they watch over us a great cloud and he said there was an innumerable host of those amen amen amen and who set the rule to say god can't create glory and we don't know right on every population that comes along the lord may speak a whole another population of them at all we don't know exactly but we know this that there's an angel of the lord said jesus that beholds my father's faith on my behalf always on my behalf watching over my life good hallelujah amen praise the lord jesus now notice as we go into this just a little bit about the servitude of these angels of the lord notice that it is because these angels are called of god in the service to the bride let me go a little bit further let's try to yeah this up and pick it up the afternoon but notice in the service of god that these angels of the lord then are commissioned to minister unto the body then paul connects that servitude with the ministry did you notice that he takes these angels of god and said did not he make his ministers flames of fire now this is in the message greatest battle ever thought brother adam said that the ministry of spirits he said these angels he said glory hallelujah he said ministering spirits go forth the minister of the word of god so in other words while i'm standing here on this platform or the gesture into the man of god as he stands here the gift of the lord when it cuts into operation then the angels of god that are sent to minister through that brother come to bring the anointing of the holy spirit to minister through that man of god you ever wonder why a preacher gets off his notes yes because if you have a need and not your need in my notes because that angel's called to serve he will swing that anointing in the way of service yeah [Music] on the gift of god i don't care how dry the service how dead the service how dead you are how tired you are always pulling on that word [Applause] amen that angel is called to serve you even yeah in your direction that's right hey man let somebody just annoy the singer come up here and get on a piano or pick up a guitar or something like our brother in the solo service and and and these young people as they play i mean just just look at how the holy spirit will pick up the anointing on it that's right right and listen let me tell you something when you're playing this music over here and you don't really realize how you made that note you've got an angelic anointing [Laughter] yes sir you're scared of that you scared your bottom lips equipment i'm going to mess this song on the pieces but let the anointing fall that's angels of the lord hallelujah outside of that you've got a good talker he's an industrial speaker right brother if the angel of the lord does not accompany that man to the platform i don't care how many quotes he reads how many times he says the prophet's name he is not called minister he's just an exhorter that's right brother because a called preacher is anointed by the angels of the lord to bring the gospel it's the holy ghost of course but the angels of the lord are commissioned to deliver these gifts to the people amen amen absolutely amen and and i just say it like this you know we we uh as i was listening to this morning about some of the testimonies that brother branham and his meetings they said when the angel of the lord would show up now this is not on tape but this is testimony from people in the meetings said that the angel of god while brother brandon be praying would sometimes leave his hand lay his hand on some of their shoulders and said they would leave a glowing imprint that would fall around the rest of the meeting the rest of the night that was testimony for some of the people of brother venom's meetings amen amen he talked about one of the ushers that was standing there and said brother branham walked in told him what his name was talk to him as though he'd been with him all day long and said he turned around and got his hat started to go to the platform he stopped to run but his hand and shoulder said your wife had that disease today when she went to the doctor but she's healed of it don't you worry about that said he goes home that afternoon and so that evening sits down and talks to his wife and said honey what about that she said i didn't want to tell you i didn't want to scare you she said but i had a certain thing said she died before him and never was plagued with that thing god completely healed her just like that i got news for you brother that wasn't a man who practiced good psychology and had plants around the tent that was the holy ghost yeah when brother bennett would walk into a room a brand new room of 50 and 60 people that called every one of my name come on why is that be spiritual that was the holy spirit it was the angel of the lord in our city and ever the evangelist of god that's what done these things brought these great manifestations of the lord hallelujah amen when i say wise up i'm not talking necessarily to you specifically i mean in general we have to be wide awake for the hour that's what it is amen just like when the cry went forth for the virgins to wake up i mean it in the way of don't be spiritually sleeping on what is going on around us we might be alone but we are never alone amen amen amen there's always something around us always something watching over us thank you jesus hallelujah amen mama when you can't get to your baby don't forget the angel of the lord can get there quicker than you amen they don't need a passport they don't need to take a gas amen all you got to do is call for them and they didn't happen we've all heard the stories about people out in the middle of nowhere you know and and there's no there's no lights there's no town there's no electrical wires there's nothing and they're out of gas they're trying to pass through it all of a sudden some man comes from nowhere the tank of gas and then goes back into nowhere we know what it is it's the angels of the lord so if they're called to encamp about us don't those same angels of god aren't they commissioned to come bring us healing and signs and oneness god uses them angels to deliver it to the servants of god amen in the bride of jesus christ remember god didn't call an angel to preach he called man that's right but the angel is commissioned to serve that preacher amen hallelujah amen listen i'm saying around the world i've played music around the world i i've i've sat in in in meetings and talked to people about the bible all my life i've spent my whole life in the christian church yeah like that i heard saying this morning i'll probably die right in the middle of it that's true i thought about that about myself about you know i was born into the church i'll probably die right in it i'm kidding and and you know i've spent my life doing them things and feel the holy spirit when it comes down on the platform and as we were singing this morning you feel the holy ghost you know i like that yeah brother jesse when i step to this platform and i open up my bible i've felt it for 30 years yes there's a presence of a being that steps on this platform right behind me i felt it just this morning when i started to read my scripture to you i felt that change come right back behind me what is that what brother branham said the angels of the lord are the ministers of spirits the minister of the body of jesus christ yes that's the reason why we should not take church lightly amen amen because the angels of the lord are amongst us said the reason he didn't like auditoriums he said because it took him days to preach all his devils off the rapture set up everything sports events he said wrestling boxing all that stuff going on concerts and what more and he said but he liked the church he said because that's where the angels of the lord amen amen that's right why don't we have more visitations from it because our lives and our atmospheres are not a place for heavenly beings to feel comfortable in yes yes think about that just a moment how can an angel of the lord visit us and we not be able to see it i know wouldn't it be great if we could say well i had a visitation from the age of the lord sure but just because you don't see it don't mean it wasn't there that's right have you ever been praying and you know you get done praying and you you feel like there's a supernatural thing which is not certain maybe not the holy spirit exactly but you knew he was in a heavenly realm well that's because jesus said that these angels of god would be witnesses in judgment they're good note-takers yes you think you take good notes in church they do better than you because they take all the thoughts and intents and they catch all that stuff they see actions if you put your eye in a certain way nobody else might see it but they that's why judgment may not be anybody could be able to escape not one thing that's right you have to do is call for the angel's homework record and what you've done and so forth like that and cause the whole night from teachers you know jesse will say all right bring your homework children you know hey listen i ain't got it the dog ate it not on that day amen the angels of the lord have got our record up well that ain't me i didn't do this all right call the tape up let's prove this you won't be able to escape it because the angels of the lord are taking notes and keeping records did you ever stop to think that when you're in your prayer closet and you don't feel the holy ghost you get discouraged and you think god's not even listening but you didn't stop to consider maybe the angel of the lord was taking your order amen it may not even be that you feel the holy ghost at that time just have faith in the process yes have confidence in the program that god established and when you're talking to the lord and you don't know whether god heard you or not just remember the angel of the lord took your order he's taken it up to the kitchen to make sure the chef prepares it right and i don't know about you but i would much rather have a well done meal than just some old mcdonald's process thing any day of the week they could pop them out on a manufacturing thing you know and get you a stack of cheeseburgers in a few moments time but let me tell you when a real chef gets that meat and he packs it together and he seasons it just right maybe he sticks it in a marinade goes overnight like that i meant to wait a little longer but all the results are so much that's right all right there's a way with the angels of the lord if we can only understand that they're commissioned by god to make sure you are all your needs are met yes yes they're taking your order well you say i don't feel god but hold still you don't have to feel god yes remember jesus never said did you feel it he asked you if you were all right amen amen amen that's right if you don't feel it all the time maybe it's because the holy spirit may not be resident right there in your in your prayer closet or in your car yes remember if he's if he's omniscient and he can't be everywhere at the same time listen there were moments even though the the pillar of fire dwells within us by the seal of god remember there were moments that the prophet of god would say i'm waiting on him to show up that showed us that there were times that god almighty and his ever whatever manifestation you'd like to identify and the pillar of fire in the logos call it what you want but that shows us there were times that the holy ghost was coming from one place to another yes he may not be right in your residence right at that moment he might not be on your neighbor in your neighborhood or on your block at that moment but don't forget if you call for god's help the servers are there taking the order amen amen that's why we should ask in faith not a miss yes believing god speaking the word you promised it lord this is what you said yeah the man likened it to a cashier check you know that yes he said sometimes then angel cashiers might get busy he said but the check would be cash sure enough you said the bottom of it jesus name is wrote at the bottom of every check he said just sign it and tell it you know what you want the old song call him up call him up tell him what you want amen we may not always feel the holy spirit in those moments but that doesn't mean that god's provision isn't being made for you and i yes hallelujah notice in genesis 28 12 he dreams a dream talk about jacob he sees a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached up into heaven and the angels of god were ascending and descending on i love to say this in our minds we think heaven is just a quiet peaceful like a library you know we got right in our mind you know that everything's just you know people are just strolling leisurely down you know down to the rolling fields of bluegrass but i want to point your attention to something we'll pick it up tonight that heaven is a beehive of activity yes heaven is a metropolis of activity ever been to a busy city i don't i don't mean africa amen that's a little town compared to new york in places i'm talking about a metropolis i mean it's a busy city of uh of movement and motions and activity i'll just call your attention that whenever brother branham crossed from this realm into the other the very moment he crossed between that that time veil once you look what was taking place he looks back on the body he sees his bed he turns one direction and millions are running and screaming our precious brother it is a beehive of activity amen i would just advise you that if you ever get in a place to where you think maybe that things are moving too slowly i'll just tell you to close your eyes and use your faith in your long-range vision and look in that realm and picture in your mind the millions upon millions of angels of the lord that are buzzing back and forth in and out of that busy kitchen serving the children of god and how much activity is taking place you might be 17 on the list but wait your turn yes yes wait your turn because all that activity is being stirred up for the benefit of the body of jesus christ amen amen heaven is not a place of folding our hands a little slumber a little sleep heaven is a metropolis of activity there's always something moving over there if you don't think so just look at when john got a view of it yes yes he looks around at the throne of god and the angels are singing i mean at the very time that the very seals are getting ready to come open and god opens up his eyes to look in that dimension and see that hour that the lamb is getting ready to take the book look there's a call going all around heaven like you be in a shopping center and people are calling the person with the red dodge parked in front of the place please go uh so and so please ever been in the store and here they're just calling calling calling calling calling amen no doubt that people were hearing over the loud speaker elijah sitting somewhere another up against the juniper tree maybe yeah yeah hallelujah all of a sudden the call came over amen who is worthy to take the book and loose the seal what i'm trying to tell you after all the angels and them elders fell on their face worshipping it wasn't a quiet place for everybody sitting back in the bark lounge heaven is a place of activity amen constant movement and constant activity and then why because the children of god have many needs yes sir i mean let me just give you an example what i mean we're not going to do this physically but just mentally in your mind think of it this way if i started with me and i and then just each one of us with a clipboard and a pencil and a paper we just went down through this church and and i'm not hiding nothing not nothing secret everything just exactly the way it is write down every need that we've got just in this room alone i would guarantee you there'd be two 300 needs our families our health our lives our future our thoughts our trials are battled just in this room right yes sir yes sir it's a busy kitchen up there yes yes there's a lot of orders pouring in yes sir thank god our chief chef knows how to handle all that activity thank god he knows how to handle all that business yes don't forget the wheel may be full of tickets come on somebody yes sir yes sir it might be full of tickets but get you the time because if you want it prepared right you want it done right you know i hear some people they say oh i want my son and daughter saved or whatever whoever the person might be but yet what they're saying is they want the mcdonald's version of that yeah they want god to usher them through some big thing and just pour them out into some kind of a manifested son of god no if god if i'm gonna pray and ask the lord to move on a son or a daughter or a aunt or an uncle or brother sister mom dad whatever it is i want to pray god take him to the kitchen and really do a masterpiece yes hey man it takes you years to get them in that condition where they're humble enough where when they come it is perfect i don't want a macdonald's version that's right i don't want a burger king version or a wendy's version of salvation when i put my order in i want it to be done right hey man hey man that's what i feel when i go eat somewhere and then if i'm gonna order chicken i want it to be cooked all the way through yes sir if i'm gonna order a burger and i ask for medium well or medium rare i want to do exactly what i order when i go to a place and i say i want a diet pepsi i don't want a regular one if my taste is too sweet i say hey come fix this i want to diet amen if i go into a supermarket and you know my mom loves aldi's and uh and and we do too you have a holiday up here yes and and you know sometimes we go into them places and it's kind of hit and miss with some of the products you know every now and then you'll buy a little thing it might be cheaper a version of eggs or some kind of thing they'll do and it might be a buck and a half cheaper but by the time i get done choking it down i'd gladly pay the buck and a half for the better version some of it some of it i mean just a few little things here there you're kind of hitting this on things yeah brokers walmart they all do the same thing so when i buy something i put an order and i want it to be right yes i want it to be satisfied if i ask god to save me if i ask god to give me the holy ghost if i ask god to heal my body if i ask him to do anything in my life and i'm claiming that my own self this morning healing in my body from this diabetic condition i've been claiming this thing ever since it struck my body eight years ago i don't want god just to do a mcdonald's patch up on me i want it to be a perfect job when he gets done with it amen amen when i put my order in i want it to be satisfied yes i want it to be fulfilling and i want it to be exactly what i've asked amen amen and there's nothing wrong with that that's right i i i laugh i'm not laughing at the brother i'm laughing with him but i laughed at the a friend of mine back home he said that when he was getting ready to get married he said he was talking the lord about a wife and the holy spirit said to him tell me what you want he said oh i want a godly woman he said no i mean tell me what you want and he told her right now said i wanted to be so tall i want to have this color right here i want her to stand you know and have this kind of eyes and all that and and god sent him a woman to his exact specifications they've been married almost 32 years now i'm telling you brother put your order in but wait for god to send it in the right way yeah i know these young people won't get wrapped up in this they got a good mom and dad but a lot of times young people get too big of a hurry trying to get married right they jump into one relationship after another afternoon that's the mcdonald's version wait until you get that chef special yeah and then because marriage in life is a whole lot better when you've got the right one right and just jumping from one thing to another that's right brother amen heaven is a beehive of activity yeah man let's stop there we'll pick it up this afternoon stand with me if you will come brother let's sing worship the lord just a moment i'm going to turn it back to brother jesse and i'll see you this afternoon
