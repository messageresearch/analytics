Description:
A listener asked if we had any documentation for how many people Brother Branham baptized in 1933 in the Ohio River. We have no documentation to prove the exact number, but no one can be certain about the exact number of baptisms. 

Brother Branham's accusers cite a newspaper article saying 14 people were converted, yet Brother Branham said 500 were baptized. Brother Branham is not here to give his response, and we were not witnesses, so we will never know the answer on this side of eternity. 

Bible believers must remember that God never places signs ahead of His Word. It's undeniable God used Brother Branham as a prophet to restore His true Word, as many examples are given to support this fact.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your co-host Pastor Jesse Smith and today I'm hosting solo due to some busy schedules but by the grace of God we're excited for another episode today for this episode I'm going to answer a listener's question about the number of baptisms that took place in Jeffersonville Indiana in 1933 when brother Brennan was baptizing new Believers in the Ohio River the question was what documentation do you have brother Jesse to defend brother random's claim that 500 were baptized rather than 14 as brother Ram's accusers claim were baptized so I'll get to the answer shortly but let me say this is the second podcast episode defending brother Branham against his accusers as episode 3 was the previous episode in which we defended brother Branham against the plagiarism accusation Lord willing we'll probably do another podcast defending by the Rams Revelations about the church ages and the Seven Seals in the future by the grace of God and again Lord willing we'll probably do more type of these types of a podcast defending brother random against all these false accusations that are coming upon him lately as time allows I think you'll see though that a lot of these accusations against brother Branham are pure presumption and not fact also we do have more testimonies from the Saints in our church that we'll get to they're already recorded but there's a few details that need to get worked out and more edits that need made so Lord willing will be publishing those in the future by the grace of God so here's the outline for the podcast first we'll look at the viewers question and my answer second we'll look at how signs are never ahead of the word of God and third we'll look at undeniable proof brother Brandon was God's prophet in my humble opinion viewer question and answer if you were recently emailed me and asked this question that went something like this one of brother Brown's accusers on his website said a Jeffersonville newspaper article said only 14 were converted at the Ohio river in 1933 but brother Branham said many more in fact 500. brother random also said after the 17th baptism the voice said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun Jesus first coming so your message will forerun his second coming brother Jesse what documentation do you have to defend brother Branham and my answer was brother I have no documentation but this accusation against brother Branham is like men in the other accusations against brother Branham it's solely based upon presumption and ultimately this accusation comes down to brother Adam's word against the newspaper brother random is not here to defend himself so we will never know the answer to this question we will never have actual documentation proving brother Branham was right or wrong now of course I believe brother Brown was right although he could have been exaggerating for example if he baptized Believers for five hours he would have had to have baptized 100 Believers per hour during those 1933 Revival meetings briefly I'd like to look at the exact accusation from the website of course this is one of brother Ram's main accusers his website says quote to date only one single article can be identified from May 1933 published in the local Jeffersonville Evening News 14 converted 14 conversions are reported in attempt meeting conducted at 8th and Pratt streets by the Reverend William Marion Branham June 2nd 1933 Jeffersonville Evening News end quote so this is the website that the viewer was asking about so brother Ram's accuser is basically saying brother M lied and the newspaper was right only 14 people were converted and so there could not have been a 17th person baptized and so there was no voice from Heaven speaking of brother Brown being the Forerunner of Jesus's second coming and they say 500 baptisms was not possible either I like to play the quote from Brother Brian where he says he baptized 500 and then the voice was heard that said he would forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote from go away Jesus 1963. that day down there about 33 years ago 34 stand on the banks of the Ohio River there at the bridge and about 5 000 people or more gathered on the banks uh just about 20 years old 23 22-23 years old my first Revival I was baptizing 500 people that afternoon and the deacons that led me out in the water not the 17th person when I was baptizing I heard a boy say look up I turn to look up Billy's mother we wasn't even married then just going together here come that Pillar of Fire circling out of the bright blue skies at two o'clock on June the 15th coming right down out of the Skies like that and the boys roared out all over the place there and said as John the Baptist was sent forth the forerun the first coming of Christ you have the message you'll have forerun this second coming of Christ photographers taking the picture also it's clear that brother Brown admitted that he usually exaggerated numbers so I want to play that quote as well this is from straight As the gate 1959. very good that uh making a Thor estimating crowds because I usually exaggerate on it so having all these quotes and all this information again I would say I have no documentation the only way to know for sure was to have been there but I wasn't there and I don't know anyone who was there and brother random is not here to defend himself so the main point is that there was a Revival in 1933 with baptisms and a supernatural voice spoke of brother branham's message that would forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ friends brother Ram's accusers are constantly doing anything to distract Believers away from the Bible verses that brother Branham pointed us to or his bible-based message at some point perhaps in the future I'll show how these accusers they love rock and roll women preachers sinful movies allow women to cut their hair in dishonor dressing up for Halloween as Dracula and more sinful behaviors as Jesus said by their fruits they are known these accusers of brother Branham despise the fact that God is one person that there are three works of Grace that there are hair and modesty standards in the Bible and other Pauline teachings as we'll get to later in other words these accusers do not love the spirit of Truth they are not being guided into all truth as Jesus said real Believers would in John 16 verse 13. so when closing out this section again I told the brother I have no official documentation about how many people were baptized and we have to remember we cannot make the newspaper the absolute because there's only one absolute that's the word of God that's one form of the absolute and then the person of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost he's the absolute so I cannot prove for certain how many people were baptized but neither can brother Adam's accusers all they can do is point to one newspaper article but we cannot make that newspaper article a thus saith the Lord foreign next let's look at signs are never ahead of the word of God I told this brother in the email that there is no way for either side to prove they are right whether it's brother random side or brother Ram's accusers so I told him the proof is the word test brother Ram taught us the word on the godhead water baptism and more the main thing to focus on is the word of God that brother random restored and not to over emphasize the signs of his ministry even when I debated those that left a message in September 2020 I emphasized the word that brother Ryan restored and not the sign so much of course I believe the signs that God gave to brother Branham but an unbeliever will never believe those but the unbeliever cannot deny the word of God that brother and restored through the Holy Ghost leading and through Jesus's role for him as the seventh angel and as a restoration prophet also I share with the brother in this email this quote from Brother Branham from the spoken word is the Original Seed where brother Branham said God never placed signs ahead of his word so this quote seemed to help the brother because we must apply this quote even to brother Ram's own Ministry we must put the word of God that brother man restored ahead of the signs even Jesus mentioned this in a story he told in the Book of Luke about the rich man and the poor beggar named Lazarus when the rich man was in hell he asked Abraham to send back Lazarus from the dead that his other brothers would believe and not go to hell but Abraham answered and said if one rose from the dead they wouldn't believe anyway he said they should believe simply from the law of Moses and so we see Jesus giving us the same principle God never placed signs ahead of his word so let's listen to the quote from the spoken word is the Original Seed God never placed signs ahead of his word hey man that's a scorcher God never placed signs ahead of his word they were added for proof of the word but the word is first approval Elijah said to the woman make me a cake first then watch the miracle happen come to the word first and then what's the miracle the seat word itself is what the Holy Spirit energizes lastly here's undeniable proof that brother bran was God's Vindicated prophet in my humble opinion as I Was preparing for this podcast I had these thoughts about trying to come up with an undeniable proof that brother Ram was God's prophet and it reminded me of a little bit of what I wrote in my 2021 book to begin with there are six passages of scripture that declare an authoritative biblical truth about Elijah's spirit in the end time they are Acts 3 20 and 21 Matthew 17 verses 11 and 12 Malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 Revelation 10 verses 7 through 11 Amos 3 verse 7 and Luke 17 verse 30. these six passages give us this authoritative declaration that is Jesus will remain in heaven and not physically return to the Earth until all things including Bible doctrines and the hearts of the Believers are restored to their original Apostolic conditions by the preaching of a prophet Anointed with the spirit of Elijah and again I share this on the September 2020 debate with an accuser brother Branham and they could say nothing against it they just avoided the topic now closely related to this authoritative declaration is the fact that brother random revealed 12 New Testament Mysteries six of them would thus saith the Lord which were the godhead Israel's blindness the baptism of the Holy Ghost the seven Church ages the mother Harlot and the Mystery of iniquity additionally brother Brown gave us eight doctrines with thus saith the Lord first the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism was the true baptism marriage and divorce third the Fulfillment of the image of Daniel chapter 2 with Rome ruling at the end time fourth women who purposely dress immodestly will answer for committing spiritual adultery on the day of judgment fifth a woman who cuts her hair is spiritually dead or not born again because of the shame or repulse she's bringing upon her husband Christ and God sixth brother random's Bible teachings are restoring God's people back to the fullness of Pentecost according to Joel 2 verses 23-26 7 there is an Elijah Messenger to the Gentiles according to Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 and 8 the fourth Ministry of Elijah appeared in the United States in the 1960s and again brother Ram said all of those with thus saith the Lord additionally brother Ram gave us at least five fulfilled prophecies with us saith the Lord he correctly prophesied the passing of Florence shakarin in 1965 just as Elijah foretold king ahaziah of his certain death in Second Kings 1 verses 1 through 17. second he foretold the healing of Florence Humes in 1955 third he said there would be no greater gift arise to the Gentiles outside of his in 1961. fourth brother random prophesied of the immoral condition of American churches in April 1965 that certainly come to pass and fifth in July 1965 brother random said it was impossible for Christian denominations to return to the apostolic gospel and there was a certainty of their acceptance of the future Pope Antichrist next in connection to Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6. brother Brandon would turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers which brother Ram said with thus saith the Lord in Souls that are in prison 1963 meaning he would turn our hearts back to the gospel that Jesus Christ revealed to Paul and I have at least 14 Pauline doctrines that most churches reject today but we accept proving we have to be the Bride of Jesus Christ these 14 doctrines are the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the three works of Grace the godhead is one person the restoration of the gifts of the Holy Ghost homosexuality is wrong adultery is wrong fornication is wrong murdering through abortions or birth control pills is wrong women preachers is wrong all substance abuse is wrong whether cigarettes weed or any other drug viewing sinful content is wrong shameful hair lengths are wrong false conversions are wrong like saying a scripted prayer of repentance and lastly number 14 wearing immodest clothing is wrong finally friends brother Branham had Supernatural discernments and healings like in the case of Florence Humes and Congressman Upshaw it's recorded on tape in 1955 that brother Ram discerned Florence hume's condition of tuberculosis and then he spoke her healing in the name of Jesus Christ and of course she recovered having many more children grandchildren and great-grandchildren while we don't have Congressman upshaw's miraculous moment recorded on tape he is recorded on tape as testifying of that miraculous healing later on before he passed away a third example is Marilyn Hickey now she's a woman preacher today which we disagree with but brother Ram discerned her infertility her inability to have children in 1956 and then 10 years later she had her one and only child and brother Ram foretold that child coming with thus saith the Lord and it came to pass so friends there could be so much more said but I believe all these statements give us an undeniable proof that brother bran was God's Vindicated prophet and so again we never Place signs ahead of the word of God we've got to place the word of God first we've come to the end of the podcast friends and I hope this was a blessing to you I appreciate the viewer asking this question and hope the answer has been a help to the Saints by the grace of God and again friends many of these recent accusations against brother Branham cannot be proven because brother Ram is not here to defend himself and answer their questions a lot of the claims of brothers accusers are just presumption and not fact but the facts we have are the Bible revelations that God gave to brother Branham because Jesus Christ vindicates these revelations in the Bible and in our lives today that's what drew me to the message it was the Bible revelations that brother random had to fulfill according to Revelation 10 verse 7 Amos 3 verse 7 and other scriptures and then I saw that same Jesus Christ who revealed the word of God to me manifest himself in my life just as he did in the Bible days just as I could read in the scripture proving that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever thank you for your time friends and hope this short podcast was a blessing to you and may God anoint you to defend this message God bless you bring the good tidings the good news that Jesus raised him today [Music] foreign [Music]
