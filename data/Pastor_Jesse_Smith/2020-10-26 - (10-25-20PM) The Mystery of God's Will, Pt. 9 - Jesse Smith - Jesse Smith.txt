few things i want to just some current events i'd like to update john i want to share amen had a real good question so i want to just go through that real quick with a few scriptures it is on the battery must be dying okay so i'll just use the handheld mic so praise the lord uh first john 2 17. so we want to finish the series lord willing tonight we'll see how it goes uh about the mystery of god's will the bible clearly calls it a mystery so to the world and denomination it's going to be a mystery uh but to god's elect god's dearly beloved it's going to be revealed and it's going to be made known praise god and so we're grateful for that all the mysteries of god must be finished in the end time and taken around the world and so we're grateful that this mystery has been revealed and we're living it praise god we're living in the mystery of the revelation rather of the mystery of god thank the lord for that first john i'm sorry 217 first john 2 17. let's read that together ready one two three and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever may god add his blessings to rhema's word you may be seated praise god now you can switch over acacia to the i just got a few things i want to share on my phone real quick and i don't really have any other slides other than that um here let me start with that i'll start with this one brother amen had a good question because this morning we were looking at dearly beloved and how one of the meanings is like a favorite so i was pointing out how god has favorites he offers he offers uh salvation to all but then he has ones that will be his favorites and brother ram likens it unto a husband and wife right there's many women out there there's many churches but christ chose one church the bride right and now we know she's part of many different churches but it's a spiritual choosing um and he had a good question he said what about the scriptures about partiality i think that was an excellent question with amen excellent question um so i just thought i would briefly say it um there's a few scriptures on partiality in the days of malachi they were backslidden right so that god had to send a prophet so he said or they admitted they've been partial to the law so obviously being partial is a sin right being partial in the law and judgment first timothy 5 21 i charge thee before god and the lord jesus christ and the elect angels that thou observe these things without preferring one before another doing nothing by partiality so concerning god's commands we're not partial to any of them we obey all of them okay uh now here's a good one james 2 4. let's get the context of this one the context is someone walks into the church that's rich and says oh oh sit up right up front here right or somebody's so rich oh why don't you preach tonight you're rich you've got gold rings on and um so he said don't have a respect to persons if someone comes in with good you know fancy clothes on um and are you then not partial in yourselves and become judges of evil thoughts so i tried to just briefly amen and i didn't have much time but i just tried to show this morning as we're looking at dearly beloved that's dealing with relationship right that's dealing with relationship so it and brother brahms said you're going gonna have friends that are more special than others right you know so you're just gonna have relationships there now they're god ordained relationships where you trust those people more you have a more intimate connection because of the holy spirit and so in other words like a husband and wife god is going to choose groups of people where uh where you are you are extremely close to them right but you'll still treat everybody the same right as far as you'll still treat them with love and care and everything like that but you are going to have people that uh they're your favorites that that's kind of what brother bam said you have special friends um but you know it's because of god's grace it's a god it's a god-given choice i'm sorry it's a god-given uh blessing for your choice to follow him and so i hope that i hope that comes off right if not we can study more scriptures on it you know but another one this one's about wisdom with when we exercise wisdom which is choosing which is the right choice at the right time remember that's wisdom knowledge is just what what to do but wisdom is when to do it and how to do it so he says but the wisdom that's from above is pure peaceable gentle easy to being treated full of mercy and good fruits without without partiality and without hypocrisy so you know uh in our dealings with people we have to give wisdom without partiality right we have to give instruction no matter if they're a close friend or not we should give god's wisdom equally to all but i was sharing with brother amen when he asked me that the scripture came to me i'd never thought about it before but the scripture came to me jesus had three really close disciples he had 12 but he had three really close ones peter james and john right and there was those three could go up to mount transfiguration those three could go in the house with a little girl jairus daughter where was everybody else he had certain ones that were closer than others right and so we'll have that in our lives we'll have those who are extremely close by a spiritual bond that god has given to us and now favorite may may not be the right word to use but it came up in the lexicon so i was enjoying that this morning i just thought i'm one of god's favorites praise god not because anything you know necessarily different about us we just love god's word and that automatically creates a spiritual bond right it creates a blessing of god when you obey god you get the blessings of god so i try to i hope that helps a little bit uh but that was an absolute great question brother amen um yeah we're not to be we're not to be partial in pouring out wisdom and judgment and discernment and even love because we're to love our enemies but god it will give us special relationships that will treasure above others right i mean think of all the message people i've met but yet i've got a group of close really fr real close friends that i just treasure those relationships more than others and i hope you do as well by god's grace if you don't like we said this morning a friend shows himself friendly right like i even apologize to john out there i said sometimes i'm not a really good friend because i just all i think about is you know i'm preaching that's all i can think about helping my family cleaning the house you know washing dishes johnny called me this week i really appreciated it but i was washing dishes so was he was surprised i picked up because sometimes i don't pick up but i said i'm washing dishes i got free time you know i can just pick up there so god you know he places certain people that they're going to be naturally naturally just closer to us so i hope that's a blessing uh by god's grace like you know paul he had he loved everybody right he had all these you know loving relationships but then he had my son my dearly beloved son the gospel timothy you know he just had partners in the gospel that he was naturally going to be closer to so i hope that helps a little bit by god's grace i hope so buddy if not we can definitely do more studies on it because i never thought about that question that was a good question i was just all caught up in the beloved you know the bride you know we're the bride and uh but yeah brother does say we have uh real good close friends i don't know did you see this this week catholic leaders condemn pope francis's endorsement of same sex unions wow uh the mother harlot uh november should be full of abominations think of all the abominations she already has right with idolatry transubstantiation uh mary worship i mean think about all the and now here's another one now if you read the article if you want i can share it with you um i read it before service uh pope francis is on record saying homosexuality is is okay and we have to accept them and i'm sorry he's sorry that they've been mistreated but the interview was from from 2019 so they've hit it for a whole year and it just came out now i don't understand the timing of that i don't know why they would i know why they'd hide that because it's going to make a lot of catholics upset because it's so far left it's so evil it's so abominable now not the souls of the people i you know they can they can come out of that we know i've met people in the message that have come out of homosexuality right numerous and it's amazing god can still save them but most of them will be reprobate-minded and most of them will be lost okay i'm not condemning them that's what the word of god says and i don't know each and every case i can't condemn individual cases but i just thought i'd share that with you i was frankly shocked because you know it seems like the catholic church would just stay on like you know no abortion no like they're big on family right you know we have we have family members are catholic and they're big on having children they're big on you know husband and wife and the family culture so i was just i was shocked to see that um so if you want the article i can share it with you but just another sign you know about uh i mean i guess in one way maybe i shouldn't be surprised because lutherans and everybody else you know presbyterians they're adopting homosexual leaders right and they've got to unite on i mean they've got to unite on all these things but i said the last thing may be the communion though unite on he did say that so uh just a little bit very sad news but again she's a mother harlot and she's the cage of every unclean and hateful spirit that's another spirit right another uh evil spirit that has to be in that cage sadly but i just thought i'd update you on that okay so you can you can turn off my phone now that's all i have i i wasn't really i didn't have any notes really to show for tonight i got them on my ipad and they're kind of not they're not very nice to look at as far as they got writing all over them and different colors and everything so uh glory to god in the church say amen amen they can do whatever they want they're the false bride we're the truth we keep all the word of god so we just need to remember to pray god save what you can save what you can and use us to do it uh if you're willing by god's grace so let's take them a little bit here i'll set the timer when we do 40 minutes i'll try to preach in about 40 minutes we'll see how we do i just want to finish this thought tonight on the revelation of the mystery of god's will amen hope you've enjoyed it like i said brother cam's family is reading this this chapter right now for their devotions and he said he's really enjoying it he said it's really solid so that's my prayer that's my prayer my prayers to do my part of revelation 10 7 to 11. to take that word of god and prophesy it again to many nations kindreds peoples and tongues i want to do my part in taking that mystery that open book revelation and taking it to the world i just want to do my little part uh by god's grace so uh seem like there's something else i want to say i just can't think of it now maybe i thought there's something else i wanted to say all right forgive me okay so let's just quickly i just want to do a quick summary uh ephesians 1 9 says god has made known to us the mystery of his will right and that's because we wanted to know it the bible says the eyes of the lord go run around the earth searching for he that has a pure heart right and god is the uh the father is searching for true worshipers that will worship him in spirit and truth so that's why god found you because he knew you'd want the truth praise god and so it's made known to us and we saw it's a holy calling second timothy 1 9 says he's called us with a holy calling so the will of god is known it's holy ephesians 1 4 we're chosen in him before the foundation world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love praise god uh and then also we know the will of god means desire or pleasure so god has revealed to us the mystery of his desire the mystery of his pleasure and uh this is my summary of it the revelation the mystery of god's will is god initiates so that means he reaches out to us and rev reveals his will to every person making them responsible for responding to him and seeking his future desires that's what i believe because there's a lot of questions about the will of god is it known and who's whose responsibility is and i believe god reaches out to every heart praise god i believe god so wants to save each one of them he doesn't delight in people being lost he delights in those being saved amen i know he knows some won't be saved we know that but the bible said god does not delight in the death of the wicked and so uh now we know there's three aspects to god's will there's a sovereign will which no one can change nothing can change it it's going to happen now there's the known will of god which is the holy word of god amen the bible but then after that then there's the progressive will of god the future will that he makes known to us and that's one reason why we're here tonight aren't you right i'm here tonight you're here tonight so god can further make known his desires for my life and your life right no doubt about it that's what we want all of us are here to we want to know more about his known will right we want to know more about the bible but we also want to know more about his future desires for us and what we should do and now uh there's two aspects to finding god's progressive will remember it was there's two things his progress his future will always has to line up with his known will his word it can't be outside the word it's going to line up with the word if it's going to be the perfect will of god and the second thing is it has to be in his season the brotherham talked out about the five musts i think you can summarize them in there um in those things because we we know it came by the prophet the word of god always comes by a prophet all the other five months i believe it can be summarized in there now his progressive will then i we showed how there's always service david did the david served his generation by the will of god so whenever you're in the perfect will of god you're going to be serving others you're not the one being served you are actually laboring for other people when you're in god's perfect will praise god and then also you have submission you're learning to submit when you're in god's perfect will submit to church leadership right uh and family members you know we have to submit to our family members and we have to submit to the government right as long as they don't go outside the word of god and then the third thing is there's always suffering jesus learned to obey by the things he suffered so if we're to obey god's will and go in the perfect will of god we have to learn how to suffer and obey in the midst of it praise god then we saw how we find the permissive will of god that's by the bible said romans 12 this is how you prove the perfect will of god you present your body living sacrifice and you let the word of god transform your mind that's why you're here tonight praise god you get a good brain washing right to clear up clear up your mind just get everything out that's not everything that's darkness get it out and let the light of christ shine into our minds amen that's and then they says then you can prove to people the perfect will of god amen and so that's what we want to do we want to prove all things how many believe that let's prove all things we should be able to prove all things by the word of god now uh let me now go into the things i haven't really preached we looked at gifts and we looked at marriages and jobs and vocations and locations i'm not going to review that i'm going to go right to what's left of what i wanted to preach and what i felt led to right on so let's look at some rewards here are the rewards for doing god's will and i'll just give you a little preview they're glorious because you really can't get anything more glorious than eternal life so first john 2 17 we read it the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever amen so the first reward is eternal life you will abide forever think of that a country where you never cease to exist you'll always be there you will abide there you'll live there uh like the bible says you have to worry about another person living in your house or another in the millennium you want to worry about somebody harvesting your crops you'll get to do it i really don't like heart i don't really like gardening that much maybe i'll get to do something different but uh but the bible says it you know it will have a stability and with eternal life it'll be so stable all because you did god's will you chose to do what the word said here and so in the next kingdom god's when god's kingdom truly comes in the physical aspect of it he makes you a ruler there as well and you're a steady you're a steady uh say like pillar i guess i'll say like that you're a steady presence in pillar for a thousand years man ruling with a rod of iron many of us will be ruling with rods of iron it seems like according to the scripture because all the overcomers were promised that in the sardis church age so see church living god's will in this short fleeting life entitles you to unimaginably amazing eternal life to come just we just have a short vapor anybody seen a vapor this week with all the cold you know you see it from the exhaust from the cars you know you see it when it got hot it got up to 77 this week right 80. you see the when we had frost that morning in one of the mornings and you see it evaporate that's like your life that's like our lives right it looked pretty good for a while right but then it's going to fade pretty soon right if the lord tarries and look look real real strong looks real strong but then it quickly fades away time moves so fast i was telling brother stephen this morning i said brother you just keep on that graduate degree he's working on a graduate degree and it seems like it's going to be so far it's going to take so long to get there it's going to go like this don't you think sister diana couple years ago like that you just think about it since the gram's been here it's been two years can you believe that just like that and it just seemed like how did that happen it's a vapor but yet we're to the bible says we're to cherish every moment praise god and redeem the time because the days are evil praise god and we have been redeeming the time amen i've never been happier praise god we've never been enjoying such a fellowship like this we've never enjoyed it like this it's just been wonderful praise god it keeps going i'll say this it goes from glory to glory amen praise god it really has it really has uh i think in the days before you know naomi and karen came and then the you know amen and hua it's really going from glory to glory by god's grace it really is god would send us different ones and it's just wonderful uh it's just living with the beloved right it's fellowshipping with jesus's beloved there's nothing greater than that praise god we saw that this morning so life being a vapor those who do god's will in other words those who are diligent those who crucify the lusts of their flesh they are rewarded with eternal life and then responsibilities in the next life because the world will pass away thank god amen all the corruption in washington dc is going to pass away all the corruption in silicon valley is gonna pass away thank god amen right all the corruption of these human traffickers and these prostitution rings and all this corruption is gonna pass away thank god but the word of god will abide amen hallelujah it's going to abide because it is it's eternal it's immutable it's unchangeable the word of god so when we know we're doing the will of god it gives us that foretaste and that assurance that we will we will never have an ending as well praise god we'll be a part of the unending kingdom just by doing god's will notice it didn't say thinking god's will although we want to think about god's will we've got to do god's will right not not just by hearing god's will that's good it's good to hear god's will but we have to do god's will praise god we got to obey the word of god it's more than hearing it more than thinking about it it's even more than speaking it it's living it praise god amen it's manifesting god's glory it's obeying the voice of god so that's the first reward eternal life the second reward is joining and fellowshipping with god's eternal family praise god uh hold up mark 3 33 this is just a glorious what a promise what what what a perspective jesus christ gives to these people how many know some families that are really tight-knit and it's like well you just they only fellowship with their family i know a couple families like that day if you're not in their family you don't get invited you know and i guess you know there's some understanding for that but i'm just talking about close-knit families and i guess they can have their favorites right they can they're allowed to have their favorites but uh think think about this you know families are such a critical aspect i'm talking about your natural family but here jesus is preaching and gets interrupted by his natural family and just no and we know his reaction let's go to mark 3 33. and he answered them actually go to verse 32 can we do that one too uh a little background and the multitude said about him and they said behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee uh we love this we love this scripture for the catholics right did jesus ever exalt mary above anybody else no he didn't right verse 33 now he says uh and he answered them saying who is my mother or my brethren 34 and he looked round about on them which set about and said behold my mother and my brethren next verse for whosoever shall do right do the will of god the same as my brother and my sister and my mother amen what a response and this this is why you and i we leave our family you know some of our natural family behind if they're not believers that's why we leave them behind and we come to god's family right here amen praise god because this is jesus's real family and he i like how he doesn't even hesitate he said behold which means look behold this is my real family those who come to hear the word of god that's the real family of god amen i love that so see the first thing is eternal life second thing you have fellowship with the true family of god amen tremendous blessing so your spiritual family is in fact your real family naomi your dad this week uh he saw that picture of malachi and i and my son zion and he's like he said do i have permission to make that my profile picture on whatsapp and i just realized it now he's family right by the blood of jesus and so his his profile picture is malachi zion and i i thought what a what a good example of just he could have any of his natural family i mean he probably has before right but he wanted he wanted to be i associated with his spiritual family hey man i think i think that's so awesome don't you think that i was so touched by that i was so tickled by that that really made me happy that that he can see now he's an older wiser man right very wise man experienced decades and decades of serving christ way longer than i've been alive he's been serving christ and yet look at the wisdom that he can recognize my spiritual family is my real family that's what i want to grow into that too don't you i thought that was such a wonderful blessing there so see interrupted by natural family jesus says hold on i want you to recognize who my real family is first those that hear the word of god that's my true family hallelujah and remember not just here but do doing god's will makes you part of god's forever family amen it's forever family praise god eternal family amen now go with me if you would uh matthew 10 33 let's read this matthew 10 33 i know some of this is familiar but it's just good to see how it connects to the will of god yes it's god's will to dress modestly right it's god's will not to destroy our bodies with smoking and drinking and and and drunkenness and and whoremongering and all these things but that actually because you separate that it actually brings you into your real family praise god so see natural family ships or relationships rather are extremely important as we said but really the spiritual ones are your true family now let's look at matthew 10 33 to 38 but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven think not that i am come to send peace on the earth i came not to send peace but a sword let me stop right there right most of us think of jesus and peace and happiness enjoying all these things but a lot of that is for you and your soul right in fact did how much peace did paul have in his life after he became a christian hardly any hunted down remember those men put curses on they put a bounty on paul's head he's constantly running from place to place yet the bible says jesus says i don't come to bring peace i come to bring a sword praise god but yet if we receive his spirit we have peace inside of our being amen so it's kind of like we get the peace inside but then it's war outside praise god you get the peace on the inside but then it's battle after battle seems like every side amen amen brother amen sometimes we have battles on every side family work and then you know there's trials at church sometimes and there's sometimes just it feels like there's trials on every side but that doesn't take away the peace of god in our hearts at least it shouldn't praise god and if we backslide a little bit then god will restore our minds praise god because it's a matter of daily renewing our minds every single day he said i don't bring peace but a sword for i'm coming to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be they of his own household all right look at that so your enemies are those in your own house how many can say amen to that i've seen it you know with like i said with my mother and father and different ones uh siblings at times they they uh fight against the true word of god now it's really gotten better over the years it really has got a lot sweeter over the years uh but at first it was such a a battle between good and evil i'll say it like that good and evil he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me there's the suffering right there's the suffering there's the service there's the submission a cross the bear what's your cross to bear tonight praise god for many of us it's our family how can i get god how can i get my family to be saved for some of us it's a ministry song surprise amen song service after song service for me sermon after sermon after sermon it's a it's a daily sacrifice for the mothers it's serving the children meal after meal after meal right they just keep eating when are they going to stop they're never going to stop there's hardly any breaks right but it's this constant uh burden that you carry to do the will of god and many times your foes are of those of your own household so see it all comes down to love if you love god you'll take up your cross and follow jesus amen if you love jesus then you'll say well that's if he took a cross i can take a cross because i know my cross won't come won't pale in comparison to the cross he bore hallelujah if he had a cross if that was god's will for him to take a cross then lord help me gladly to take your cross for me what what do i need to die to what what is the what is the selfishness that i need to die to what do i need to crucify what of my my desires or my my passions are my uh my goals or dreams what do i need to crucify and god help me to take up that cross and follow you praise god amen hallelujah now here's another benefit as part of god's family mark 10 29 and 30. remember peter is saying you know he talked about the rich young ruler the rich young ruler uh leaves and and leaves jesus and peter says who then can be saved he said with god all things are possible and then peter says we've left all what about us verse 29 and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there's no man that have left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time now praise god houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and the world to come eternal life hallelujah what a there's a double reward for doing the will of god blessings now and eternal life later amen natural friends and natural families and lands and and places where you could go if you needed help praise god but also eternal life in the life to come hallelujah i've seen that nothing but the truth everywhere i've ever gone with most message people they'd give their uh they give me their last dollar if they wanted to most people uh they they'd house us i never forget that one time i went to canada with brother tim myers and i think bang went that time we had a flat tire well this message family that you know we're at a youth meeting this message family we never met just said oh yeah come on over and they just let my wife and i and and lydia said i think lydia was the only one on the scene at that point they just invite they didn't know us from from anybody you know from adam they know it's from adam but yeah they had they they sensed the love of god and we had such a good fellowship i mean the mom made us pretty good breakfast you know and pretty good lunch and and then we had time to take we went to a canadian well it was really expensive over there in canada went to the canadian uh auto shop to fix it up and the guy and then you know the husband and wife did such a great job and that's where i really that's what really one of the first times i really saw the love of god where they're just like yeah come over you got a flat tire come over stay the night you came back you can't drive back to usa tonight come over we'll feed you we'll take care of you uh and we stayed in contact for numerous years and that's exactly what jesus said if you forsake your natural family i'll give you a hundred fold of the next family praise god jesus is family amen hallelujah that's so true so true jesus uh never lies he always tells the truth and we receive a hundredfold now in this time and then eternal life in the world to come praise god how many brothers how many messes brothers you think you got brother johnny quite a few huh look at him he smiled if you count your sisters in the lord sister karen how many sisters the lord do you think you have how about beatrice back there how many sisters or brothers in christ you think you have that's a pretty big family but the bib jesus said if you forsake your natural i'll give you a hundred full i see you got about a i say 100 times whatever you think you have think about that they take you in they do anything for you i'll never forget this we went down guyana went guyana we went down we got these little boats right i thought i was gonna die uh you're going 40 miles per hour we're going down these churches down the river i forget the name of that river there in guyana man we traveled for like two hours and i'm like when is this trip going to end and then gas started leaking in the boat i'm like oh mercy lord have mercy on us but we got to this way far down i mean it was it was like there was houses miles apart on the river miles and we pulled to this this place and the preacher come down and the the first thing they say they greet us and then the wife's like got any dirty clothes i was like yeah actually yeah i just preach and i got like a i have a sweat stain around my white shirt i'm like yeah i actually do she walked over there and she got out a washing board and she was just smiling church i can still picture she's smiling she got the hose and she's washing my shirt and it come back like spotless i'm like she don't even know me from anybody and she did the same for brother brooks we're just guests you know we come in there and she's just glad she's just smiling they probably don't get many visitors you know and they're the old lifestyle right where they're not like all like we're like this all the time you know it's just there's so much pressure right but they're just uh laid back no pressure happy to wash my dirty and then and all my other dirty clothes you know you can imagine all the dirty you know all the smells and all the dirt and everything like that you know just happy to wash for the kingdom of god and the next morning they're up there hanging on the clothes line and it's 95 degrees there and everything's sparkly white clean and everything i thought my i've got another mother i got my mom my mother-in-law and i got another mom here by god's grace that's what jesus said jesus said just like that just take in their family like that and treat you like royalty and this is what jesus says that's the true family of god i don't know about you but that's an awesome family right there that's a pretty uh trustworthy family right to be adopted in a family like that so think of the gains many times as we think about the losses god help us to get our minds on the gains amen all the gains that we're going to receive now praise god may god help us to see those gains now st nobody i remember one time there was a friend we had named jimmy he was he and i actually graduated together we played uh he didn't play football so he played track we ran track together won a state championship and everything like that right after i became a preacher um i shared the message with him he got saved and baptized and i remember cam warren i think it was cam cam said now you be careful you just got he was all excited about you know the water baptism in the godhead and cam warned him i said cam said you be careful the next few days satan's going to try to take this away from you and he was just like okay okay nice guy i mean i'm still in contact with him jimmy and the very next day he got into a car accident he slid off the road and totaled his car now he was okay but when cam and simon tried to contact him after that he said i don't want nothing to do with you guys anymore so he saw this accident as god saying you did the wrong thing rather than us giving him the warning he should have saw it the way we told him that satan's going to try to scare you away from us satan's going to try to he was upset he's upset that a soul got baptized in the right way right and so instead of recognizing his real family he went back to the other family and that's so sad because it was even warned a fourth time now be careful satan's going to try to throw you off of this and try to uh get you off of the narrow way but i was grateful he was there and i got ordained because i got the picture in my office he was there when i got ordained down in lima but see he uh he saw the he he didn't think it was worthy to come over to this side he didn't see the the blessings that we see you know the bible says when satan attacks you like that you're supposed to give god glory praise god you're supposed to rejoice when you go through trials right not shirk away from the truth but rejoice because i'm getting i'm getting persecuted or i'm suffering because i made the right choice but it takes a spiritual mind to accept that praise god it takes a spiritual mind to do it so church now we have a hundredfold now in this time houses brothers and sisters mothers children lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life now upon on top of that we have a great heavenly inheritances waiting uh as well right so here's a few more rewards let's read to get your bibles ready uh john 15 10. okay can you pull it up there i have numerous more rewards here i hope you like these by god's grace i thought you really like these mine what great rewards that we have john 15 10 if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love praise god so what do you do one reward is i get to live in love amen how many remember what it was like to live in sin are you glad you get to live in love now who's who's happy about that what a what a privilege praise god to live in life instead of death to live in life praise god to abide in every day to abide in love what a privilege what a reward of doing the will of god i get to dwell in love every day next james 1 25 okay james 1 25 another abide in his love in james 1 25 another reward here but whoso looketh in the perfect law of liberty and continue with therein he be not a forgetful hearer but to do of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed so again the blessings of god it kind of goes without saying the blessings of god come upon us by doing his will your deeds your works your actions will be blessed by god people will see god's hand upon your life praise god and next first john 3 22 and 23 first john chapter 3 22 and 23 this is a glorious one as well church you have the the the blessing of knowing that god hears your prayers and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things which that are pleasing in his sight and this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ and love one another as he gave us commandments praise god what an assurance what insurance we have to know that god heard my prayer he may not answer it the way i want to but he heard my prayer he hears me i'm his child my father has his ears open to me as we saw on wednesday his faces toward me his face is not away from me in other words the prince of god is on my life amen in other words god's looking down and he hears my prayers and he he knows who i am praise god amen hallelujah see what what a promise what a reward the assurance that he hears our prayers this is for people that do the will of god next uh matthew 5 19 another beautiful promise here and i hope all these scriptures church encourage us to keep praying right to keep standing keep believing because we know there's rewards now and in the life to come matthew 5 19 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven so there's going to be like in the millennium right we know there's going to be people in the holy city jerusalem right when it's got to be re-anointed according to daniel 70 weeks right the holy city's got to be re-anointed uh where the prince of god is there right the people of god are all there and there's going to be a group of people that are called great right this this beloved people this beloved dearly beloved group they're going to have the label as great people because they taught the word they knew the word they taught the word and they helped others to obey it as well hey man isn't that glorious they should be called great in the kingdom of heaven i don't want to be called least in the kingdom of heaven i want to be called great in the kingdom of heaven and that to get that it's so simple keep the commandments and teach others to do the same hallelujah thank you jesus now as you wait upon god's will you get three more rewards the first one you eventually get the answer you actually receive the promise the bible said hebrews 10 35 to 38 cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for you have need a patience that after you've done the will of god you might receive the promise amen so the first reward is sometime after you do god's will you'll receive the promise scripture says for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry he says now the just shall live by faith if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him oh see there's a great temptation many times for people to draw back and say well i'm not going to pray anymore i'm not going to trust in god anymore it hasn't happened yet how do i know god heard my prayer but that's not what faith does faith takes a hold of it and knows that after i've done the will of god then i receive the promise praise god so that's a great benefit after you do god's will you actually receive the promise amen he promises it to you whether it's bodily healing right knowledge of who you're going to marry or financial need right whatever the need is just hang on to god and eventually it will come praise god my sister told a testimony yesterday my mom we were of course really poor because my parents were divorced and my mom she just did little side jobs but my mom remembers when the elect the uh electric company came to my mom's house and i don't know if i was at college by that time or not i probably was at college by that time and uh the electric company said uh mrs smith we're gonna shut off your uh electric if we don't have the payment in like a week and uh betsy testified she was crying in tears and she said she said betsy stay down here downstairs i'm gonna go up and pray and then uh my my sister said she heard my mom just shouting and praying up in the room uh and when she come down she had tears in her eyes and then betsy said she was there when somebody came and just brought a check over uh i forget which stranger it was but some some stranger brought over a check and uh betsy said she received it and that that's the amount that they needed to keep the electric on so see she did the will of god you make your request known unto god and god hears the prayer amen i wasn't there for that i wish i would have been there for that one but that was a great testimony see we must do the will of god and then wait wait for god to work on our behalf and then the second reward is renewed strength isaiah 40 verse 31. this is what we're getting right now a lot of strength praise god we're waiting for this rapture when is this rapture going to come is this when is the squeeze going to come right we everybody preaches about the rapture because we all want to see it that's what we're living for praise god all right and we have since brother bran was here he was preaching about the rapture for all these years and so we shouldn't get weaker we should get stronger praise god because the bible says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint so that's another reward that we should have we should be stronger for the message stronger for the word of god because we're waiting and god promises as you wait i'll strengthen you praise god but it's hasty believers who try to force their will instead of waiting on god's will and they actually grow weaker in faith instead of stronger so when you and i if there's times we try to do it ourselves or figure it out right or we're ourselves with uh with problems right worry instead of worrying we need to have faith praise god but when we do that we actually get weaker when we try to figure out we're actually stronger when we cast our cares upon the lord for he cares for us amen amen we're actually stronger just by coming to the house of god worship and sing along with brother amen and the saints and just praising god and forget about it and trust god to take care of it amen we're actually stronger just forgetting about the things we can't control and god will make us stronger in due season he promised so he promises to strengthen your faith as you wait upon his time in season hallelujah that's the second one so the first one is actually you actually gain some of these promises you actually see them fulfill the second one he renews your strength as you're waiting after you've done the will of god and the third one is you understand god's will i thought this was just a beautiful portion of scripture uh pull up deuteronomy 4 6. i never seen this scripture like this until i was studying i think i found it in one of the commentary writers now look at this this is speaking of of course israel but we know it applies also to the the gentiles keep therefore and do them the commandments for this the commandments is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations right so when you keep god's commands when you give god's when you do god's will the bible says the commandments are your wisdom and understanding and all the nations look at you and they see something different praise god oh man i think about all your family members they see something different about your life don't they see when you do god's will it instantly separates you as a different kind of a person you're a dif a different kingdom right different family or something different now they might think we're like different like this but we're not we're different because we have the wisdom of god amen we have the understanding of god the same thing was true for israel god's will made them different and made them stick out they were a peculiar people and so is the bride of christ a peculiar woman praise god she's a special church there's not many like her and i'm glad to be a part of it amen hallelujah see god's will is your wisdom and you understand it's your understanding now you understand the world right now we understand the mother harlot some people are cheering some people are cheering in their churches that the pope said that and we're like oh god have mercy save us praise god we want the truth and we we want to be your bride and we want to get out of here right we don't want to be a part of this trash and this uh this sin and debauchery we don't want to be a part of that so see some people celebrate that uh or or cheer for that but we are uh we're earnestly condemning for the faith that was once delivered to the saints amen hallelujah and but it shows that we have the understanding right we have the understanding to do god's will and your life makes sense as you read god's word right your life makes sense you it all falls into place you know exactly what you're doing as a christian go to ephesians 5 here let's read this ephesians 5 14. and let me say like this before we read it you and i should know we should all we should know almost every step that we take right this scripture proves it we'll read it a little bit we shouldn't just make guesses many times and what we're doing we should wait upon god's will and then when it's known then we make a step into god's perfect will okay so wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepless and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light next one now think of the foolish versions here see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but why stop right there that word circumspectly means exactly so when you are awakened from the darkness of sin and now your eyes are open and now the light of jesus christ is shining and you're a wise virgin christian and you're born again you walk exactly in the perfect will of god praise god you're not going to walk purposely like into a wrong relationship right you're not going to walk purposely in the wrong job or the wrong situation you're not going to purposely walk in there because the light is on praise god god's light is shining and you can you can see darkness you can you have a sense of darkness you have a sense of evil so you walk precisely you know exactly where god wants you to go hey man i'll try to finish my i really didn't think i did okay i thought i'd get done more than that praise the lord i wanted to finish tight so see your life makes sense so when the light of god is on we make the decisions and the choices that we know are god's will and we stay in god's perfect will now go to john 7 16 and 17. this the will of god is a huge topic i just had to condense it because it's just such a major huge topic it's all because it's all connected with obedience uh john 7 16 and 17. i'm almost done here jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that set me if i love this if any man do his will he shall know the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself in other words the only way you'll know the doctrine is right is if you experience it right how do you know christianity is right because i've experienced it that's how you know you have to do it right that's why we tell people just just try it right try it give jesus a chance praise god give him a chance because the only way to know what the right teaching is is to experience doing god's will and that as soon as you do god's will god blesses you amen amen that's what jesus says he said you have to do my will then you know whether the teaching's right or not see because you grow in wisdom and understanding he blesses you for obedience and then you'll know the right thing praise god so see you'll know and understand true doctrine because of the spirit's presence in your soul praise god now let me close with this let me close with here's the consequences for rejecting the revelation of god's will so those are the blessings i hope that was a blessing to you praise god hope i didn't build it up too much and i hope i didn't disappoint you on that but i thought that was beautiful my look at all those blessings so the consequence is the worst one is being lost to hell eternally separated from god like jesus taught in matthew 7 with the false prophets he said not every one that says unto me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of god of my father which is in heaven so to be saved you have to do the will of god right which we know is repentance like the thief on the cross he repented right now there is that question with the foolish version can they because they seem surprised right on the on the day of judgment uh and that's a whole other thing it's kind of hard to know but i i believe god does say that way if he's merciful but that's just my opinion i could be wrong but jesus says he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say lord lord have we not prophesy thy name and done cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then i will profess to them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so it's not enough to do miracles and operate spiritual gifts god wants simple humble obedience to his will the known will of god and the progressive will of god so look at that church they had enough these uh workers of iniquity they haven't had enough knowledge of the known will of god to see miracles happen right that enough of the the known will of god but they denied the progressive or future will of god that was leading them past gifts right because you their gifts are great right but you got to be born again the giver's got to be in you praise god the one who gave the gifts has got to be living inside of you praise god hallelujah see it's not enough to just know the or do the known will with gifts we have to do the will of god from our souls the word of god has to get down into our soul and that's why these false prophets jesus says are like wolves because they know god's known will but they blatantly re refuse the future will of god and of course you know some of the known will of god too the second consequence is unfulfilled potential how many times have we seen that people have they have so much potential like especially we see a lot with preachers some of the some of the wonderful gifted preachers but then they sell out uh the message for some worldly thing right and oh what if they just could have kept going what could god have done with a servant of god like that unfulfilled potential remember the bible says many will be saved but will have no reward right this must be foolish virgin they're saved but they lose the reward if they would have just diligently and faithfully obey the will of god let's read that real quick first corinthians i think it's first corinthians three and if it's chapter two forgive me but i think it's chapter three all right okay yeah uh 3 14 if any man's work abide which he hath built there upon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer lost but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire all right so everybody can see that by god's grace there's going to be some people their only reward and brother bam says in the church age book their only reward is eternal life they have no other inheritance no other positions no other responsibilities all they inherit is eternal life because they forsook their potential that's why we tell you know that our children and brother amen invest in your talents you know invest in your music like loris told malachi he said he had good vice he said don't ever be satisfied with your piano playing he said don't ever think you've arrived malachi so i'm gonna echo that for you tonight buddy same thing for me don't ever feel comfortable as a preacher keep pressing into the things of god uh realize how little you are realize how enough we have nothing and we need more of god amen so we can reach our potential of yielding to god and then god can use us in in greater ways so unfulfilled potential is another consequence for rejecting the revelation of god's will a third one is in inward confusion sadness sorrow or grief uh let's go to mark 10 17. this is the rich young ruler mark 10 17-25 is this helpful tonight i hope somebody's being blessed tonight by god's grace hope it's a blessing praise god i want to read 22 just for time's sake i know i know i said i'm going to close pretty soon verse 22 mark 10 22 and he was sad at that saying and he went away grieved for he had great possessions grieved in the greek means confusion sadness sorrow and grief brother ram said jesus offered him the highest office in the universe was an apostle right in the church and yet he turned it down for money and he left with a uh an inward sadness and confusion and grief because he loved his money so much now church you and i know that doesn't go away you can suppress it with pleasures right you can suppress it with pleasures and drunkenness and all kinds you can try to suppress that but it'll never go away right because that's that conviction it's that conscience where the person knows i should have done that and they'll do everything they can to forget about it so that's another consequence of rejecting god's will i'm glad church we can have a conscience that's free from guilt hallelujah i'm glad that man we can go to bed at night and we know i don't know what god asked me to do i've done everything he asked me to do i try to do it the best i can i'm giving him everything i got praise god i haven't turned down one thing i may not have uh reach it at the right time or accomplish it right away but i'm pressing toward it hallelujah oh what an assurance church we can have in our souls we don't have to sleep with grief right we have to go to bed with sadness and confusion in our lives we can go to bed rejoicing saying thank god i've done everything i know how to do to do god's will but not this fella the bible said he walked away grieved and yet the bible said jesus loved him jesus loved him enough to call him to be an apostle and he walked away so a third consequence is a sadness of mind and soul confusion sorrow grief praise god i think i'll end with just a few more thoughts here um matthew 7 8 here's jesus's guarantee what a beautiful this is an infallible guarantee i think aldi does a double guarantee money back if you're not satisfied right you get food replaced and you get your money back jesus goes way beyond a live stream just for a moment here
