mystery of israel's spiritual blindness so let's look at that here i'm sorry romans 11 25. romans 11 25. just one verse sorry wrong romans 11 25 by god's grace let's read that together on three one two three for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness is in part is happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles become in so let's have a word of prayers ask god to minister to us let's not forget as we're looking at israel let's remember let's not look away from ourselves we just want to look at them and see what god did and ought to raise our faith to understand what god is doing right now and the confidence we should have that he's going to finish this gentile age all the fullness of the gentiles will be brought in right before the rapture so it all ties together by god's grace let's pray ask god to meet all the needs heavenly father we love you we bless your name tonight lord jesus we cry holy holy holy is the lord god almighty holy holy holy is jesus christ we are not holy but you share your spirit with us and that makes us holy lord god to the degree that a human could be holy in our souls lord we know your spirit abides there that makes us holy and we're grateful for that eternally lord god as you've given us eternal life but father we need your holiness in our minds and in our bodies lord god so we pray lord tonight let your holy spirit stir up our minds by way of remembrance lord god transform our minds renew our minds lord god that our our our minds can speak the word of god and our bodies will come into subjection to it encourage us tonight strengthen us tonight lord god help us to get our eyes lord god and praying for others of course uh the lost but also israel the blinded and remember your people lord remember to pray for peace in israel so father we bless your name tonight thank you god for your mercy we pray you anoint me anoint your people in jesus christ's name the saint said amen god bless you lord willing we'll need some readers children so if you've got your bibles we appreciate that uh tonight we're uh looking forward to this little lesson on uh israel's spiritual blindness you know i just had a few thoughts uh you know recently you know with israel we've seen how uh you know the united states has led the way in helping israel uh make a few peace deals i believe i'm not mistaken there's three or four i was reading a little bit before service but didn't have a chance to read as much as i'd like but people were shocked there hadn't been peace deals in over 25 years so people were very surprised at these people that care about israel sinners don't care but those of us who are believers and know the scripture know the history of god's word uh we're very encouraged by that now one article there may one article i read tonight made it sound like uh one one country may only have peace with israel be recognized israel for financial gain of course that's not real peace right uh so we understand that uh we know some of the reasons why uh that peace may be between israel and other countries uh is is not because they respect judaism or israel's god it's because it's a financial gain or a political gain we understand that and we know at the end time you know uh we know there will be a peace treaty i believe uh through my most recent study that the peace deal will be seven years uh between rome and israel and the world but then it'll be broken in the midst of the week after three and a half years and then nations will come up against israel but that time jesus christ will come michael will stand up actually before that according to daniel chapter 12. michael will stand up for the people of israel and the bible said those whose names are on the book will be saved so uh we see you know israel having a little more peace aren't you glad god's heard our prayers right no doubt their prayers as well as they pray constantly at the western wall they're just constantly praying offering prayers to god uh and yet god hears them certainly because they're blinded so we know israel plays an important part because as we read here in the scripture tonight we read that israel is blinded until all the gentiles are come in that are going to be saved that includes the wise virgin and the foolish virgin praise god so we know there's a certain number and as soon as god is done with that number of souls that are saved then god is done with the gentiles the bible likens it unto cutting off a branch so god cuts off the access to his life to the prayer answers to the healings all these things and then judgment strikes the gentiles of course in the tribulation period but then israel's grafted back in uh and given the life of god through the two prophets right and we know they'll rebuild their temple they'll have animal sacrifices until uh sometime after the two prophets come uh and and die and are resurrected and raptured and then the the the the remnant will glorify god it won't be long after that after all the armies come up against israel jesus christ will come and protect those hundred forty four thousand of course he'll reveal himself to them as well uh so we understand that about israel we'll get to maybe more of that lord willing in the next few weeks by god's grace but i just want to remind uh everyone of some good scriptures here so i have a scripture i like to read in first corinthians 2 verse 10. so lydia can you get that first corinthians 2 10. this is a beautiful scripture about the deep things of god and as our church knows don't ever be critical of the mysteries of god i know some people are critical of them but we're not critical of the mysteries we know the mysteries reveal they're there to hide it from the wise and prudent but they're there so god can then reveal the revelation of the mystery to those who truly believe his children those uh those who really want to become his family and and understand that the things of god those who want to do the will of god god reveals it to them so lydia if you could read first corinthians 2 10 please but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god okay so those who have the holy spirit those who are really born again in church i hope everybody's catching this next thought if you're born again the spirit will guide you into the deeper things right remember even jesus one time said we need to launch out into the deep he had some more teaching to do and some miracles he had to launch out into the deep to reveal himself uh in a special situation right he said launch out into the deep to reveal more of himself well here the scripture is clear on that um the spirit searches right the deep things of god okay so it's not two persons searching out you know the holy spirit searching out the things of the first person right it's not the third person searching out the first person it's the holy spirit in us uh the spirit searching the deep things of god of the spirit okay so if we are born again we will naturally be drawn to the mysteries we know around the message a lot of people recognize god sent a prophet but they get cold and complacent and they fail to get born again but if they get born again the spirit will guide them into the deeper things right into the promised land into their inheritance into their possessions praise god uh and then into the deep things of god which the deepest things that god would have to reveal to us would be mysteries and we know revelation 10 7 said the mystery of god would be finished it would be eaten and then by john it would be taken around the world to every nation kindred tongue people to the gentiles so we know it is prophecy from the holy spirit that everyone uh or every nation will hear the revealed mystery of god we're privileged to be able to hear it for many years praise god since the time brother left the scene about 55 years ago we've been privileged to hear the mysteries of god so if you have the holy spirit it will cause you to search your bible it should be your favorite book and the children said i said amen it should be your favorite book because the spirit is going to guide you to search the deep things of god now of course god can lead us into history of course god can lead us into the arts and you know sciences and things like that but while we're in that we should be able to find knowledge about god as well and it should always draw us back to the bible because the holy spirit will guide us to search the deep things of god okay it's just like a marriage right any happy marriage the couple learns more and more about each other over the years right because they're truly in love but if a couple's not truly in love or they fall out of love or they backslide out of love then they don't care to spend any time with each other anymore or learn more about it or or hear about how their uh their their life is going you know have that godly relationship that a marriage couple should have it's the same thing with god if you're truly jesus's bride if you truly love jesus you want to learn more about him okay so i just want to bring that scripture out and it's the same thing daniel 2 22 says he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him okay so this is god's character god reveals deep things to those who want to receive it to those who want uh the light to be turned on right the bible said we were in gross darkness right the bible said we were dead in sins we were children of the night but when you come to christ the light turns on has anyone ever been thankful for a light to be turned on in the night time so you don't stumble and crash into something i do it all the time that's why i put my phone on the flashlight mode i gotta have some light because i'm gonna have trouble if i don't have light well god's spirit reveals turns on the light to reveal his plan his secret things then they're no longer secret right now their secret to the world because the bible said we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery praise god and so when we talk when we preach many people can't understand our sermons because they're deeper they're more mysterious you have to have a more revelation to understand the current revelation so uh we thank god for that and we're not better than anybody but uh we are hung we're more hungry than other people to know the deep things of god and by god's grace we receive more revelation than others not not because of anything we've done but because of god's grace and god's mercy to us as we've said is lord show all your truth to me and god has poured out abundantly from heaven praise god so let's now i just want to read that scripture there that you saw that the spirit has to guide us into deeper things if we're born again because it searches the deep things okay so before getting to the blindness i just want to tonight lord willing tonight's service i'll set the timer for about 30 more minutes we've probably done uh 10 already uh we like to uh just do a quick brief history of israel's history interacting with god okay so we'll look at that and lord willing tonight we'll look at some numerous scriptures so please have your bibles handy children so if you start at adam and eve you find his godly seedline was going to go through abel but he was killed so god raised up another seed seth and then you see that that godly seed from seth to noah of course remember seth after seth the men begin to call upon the name of the lord praise god see it's that it's that new seed right that calls upon the name of the lord praise god uh then noah had three sons ham shem and japheth shem is the faithful servant to god in all things and then uh out of uh shem uh god promised uh to bless father abraham he's the ninth descendant from shem so nine descendants later abraham comes forth and god recognizes that the seed of abraham is going to be a blessing to the entire world so god is going to use this special believing seed line right to bless the whole world and that's in genesis 17 19 and 20 21. malachi can read that genesis 17 19 20 and 21 genesis 17 19-21 yes and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant with this eat after him and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him will make him fruitful [Music] exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation but my covenant y established with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year amen so notice the everlasting covenant goes with abraham i believe it was last summer if i'm not mistaken or maybe two summers ago these years go really fast remember we taught on the covenants children remember the eight covenants we taught on i know we did some of our services out there on the deck i don't know when it was really warm it might have been last spring actually i can't remember yeah it might have been last spring because the covet i think that's what it was um so i've already preached that part of this chapter but god gives the everlasting covenant to the believing seedline through abraham and isaac now five generations from isaac comes moses god's prophet to deliver israel out of egypt and slavery uh and once you get to moses time you see a lot of god's compassion of his love for his people these are some beautiful uh descriptions of god's love for his people so three months after the exodus and they're out in the wilderness god instructs moses to tell israel they're a special treasure to him so when was the last time anyone's told you you're a treasure to them that's very very very rare right you know it's it's a it's a beautiful description you are a special treasure not just a treasure you're a special treasure and that's in exodus 19 4 5 and 6. i'll read that one lydia because i'm already there he said you have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bury you on eagle's wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will only obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel now can we just stop a moment church how many know that we are kings and priests unto god now this is under the blood of bulls and goats god said of all the nations you are the most special you're a peculiar uh special treasure unto me and you're a kingdom of priests so you're the ones that are interceding you're the ones that are dealing with uh god and man right and so how much more us we're under the blood of jesus christ oh my think about that of all the churches in akron and ohio akron area god looks on ours right has a very special fellowship because we believe more of his word because we've left the things of the world like abraham right we've left everything we've known and we've uh come out into the wilderness sanctified go in the promised land the baptism of the holy ghost and god sees our church as one that's following in the ways of god uh just not just justification justification is glorious but in onto sanctification where your whole life is cleaned out and set aside for service and then the holy ghost puts us into service praise god what a treasure we are to god in this hour praise god that we'll let god take away cussing uh and worldliness and cigarettes and and immodest clothing and immoral videos right and all the lust of the flesh we will let god take all that away and god says you're a special treasure under me so now i don't feel uh any uh conviction remember when i preach that uh how you're god's favorite yep see this is it right here this is it if israel was god's favor under blood of bulls and goats what about us under the blood of jesus christ see it's a it's a dearly beloved it's a special treasure peculiar people peculiar treasure church if you love jesus christ in that way you're a treasure to christ amen your love your songs tonight is a treasure to the king of kings and lord of lords let's say hallelujah you ready hallelujah thank you jesus what what i tell you those aren't those beautiful words those are just some of the most comforting words you could read that you're a treasure unto god and you're his priest you're the one who's going to deal with his dealings with other humans your family your friends your loved ones your associates your co-workers your your classmates god is going to use you and me to minister to those individuals and grant them grace or grant them warnings uh whatever god uh declares about their destiny because he has predetermined everything by his foreknowledge praise god so you couldn't hardly find any more beautiful comforting words than that could you they're just beautiful remember so israel was above egypt above persia above greece china japan russia you name it rome israel was above all them right uh and all of these the bible says we're aliens according to ephesians 2 12. so lydia can you get ephesians 2 12. bible said these were all aliens so you and i were previously aliens but israel was the chosen special privileged peculiar people in the earth all around all the earth if it is round uh israel was god's special people treasure because of god's grace to abraham and his seed so lydia uh ephesians 2 12 that at the time you were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world wow so look at that all these countries had no hope no covenants no guarantee from god god was just dealing with israel and church remember we got to look at that for today there's a very similar situation today anyone that denies the name of christ jesus said if you deny me before men i'll deny you before the father and the holy angels so look where people place themselves think about all the the the billions of muslims maybe the billions of hindus that deny jesus christ oh god be merciful is my prayer may god may some of them be watching tonight so they can know that they can have a covenant with god through jesus christ now this is a beautiful promise as we saw but remember it's by condition god said if israel obeyed if they kept a covenant they remain a kingdom of priests and a holy nation unto god but of course as we know they often wavered right uh and then uh some hundred eight so i'm sorry some 800 years before christ god anointed isaiah to foretell that spiritual blindness would come on them as a result of their rebellion now if you know i was looking this up earlier moses's covenant lasted about 1500 years so that means about 700 years after the mosaic covenant god foretold and said this isn't going good i'm going to have to blind you right so after 700 years so that's maybe seven or eight nine generations right uh after that time god knew he was gonna have to blind them so he lets them know about 800 years in advance why don't you let her go and let her she can't stand back there sorry church just a moment so it was god knew it was going to be a covenant that lasted 1 500 years but 700 years almost halfway into it god lets isaiah know tell them that eventually i'm going to blind them he blind them about 800 years later through a spiritual blindness okay so the scripture says this it's isaiah 6 9-10 and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not and see indeed and perceive not make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed so god lets him know 700 years in he's gonna have to blind them okay next then in jeremiah's day about 200 years after isaiah the lord himself called israel a backsliding israel okay so that's now over halfway through that 1500 year period right that's about 900 years into that 1500 year period god literally calls them a backslidden people and that's in jeremiah 3 6. now they had some godly men right like joshua samuel david solomon hezekiah josiah but the majority were evil men that led people into sin children you remember that trivia question which king was known as the one that led israel into sin jeroboam jeremiah i missed it and you guys told it to me it was jeroboam i even read it uh yesterday when i finished uh second kings jeroboam was known as the one who made israel to sin at church we want our testimony to be making people holy praise god we want our children to make help their friends become holy i want my preaching by god's grace to make you holy i don't want to make you sinful or compromise or lukewarm i want to make you holy on fire for jesus christ hallelujah thank the lord i believe it's happening hallelujah thank you jesus so even in israel's disobedience he couldn't they couldn't override god's grace because god's promises all right now 42 generations after abraham god sent his promised son jesus christ and we know in matthew chapter 10 verses 5 through 7 jesus tells the disciples don't go to the gentiles who do you say to go to the lost sheep of the house of israel that's right the jews he said go not in the way of the gentiles into any of the samaritans any enter not in their cities go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel and as you go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand isn't that gracious think about that children god knows he's gonna god knows his own people are gonna reject him but he gives them one more chance one more chance to receive him and have their eyes open and their hearts open and their ears open he gives them one more chance and he doesn't send somebody else to come he comes himself amen before he said abraham and moses and and joshua and solomon and hezekiah josiah nehemiah he says all these men of god but this time he says i'm coming myself praise god i'm going to create a body god in flesh jesus christ the word became flesh and dwelt among us he was sent to his own but his own didn't receive him his own received him not what a beautiful expression of god's love because there is treasure because there is his dearly beloved he comes himself and offers his love to them and even when he turns it down he says father forgive them they know not what they do he spreads his arms open on the cross showing he was he had open arms of love to any that would believe on him and receive him what amazing love remember israel's literal words can you imagine saying these words away with him away with him crucify him we have no king but caesar that's what the churches are saying today away with holiness away with the baptism only goes uh we'd rather we have no uh king but the media right or we have no king but hollywood we have no king but celebrities but our our cry ought to be come lord jesus come lord jesus you're our king make us holy you're the king of kings and lord of lords amen that ought to be our desire we ought to pray at church come lord come come into the service come in my home come in my job come in my life fill my mind fill my thoughts fill my lips with your word calm be closer to me because i want to feel your presence i want to please you i want to be one who receives you in this end time before the gentiles are pruned off or it off now because god gave the if god had to give them what they wanted they wanted unbelief they didn't want to believe they said away with him we don't want him as our prophet so because god has to give them their free more agency he gives them over to unbelief and most of the israelis are blinded to seeing jesus as the messiah so let's look at uh let's look at uh well there's four of them let's just look at one jesus quotes what we read earlier remember in isaiah 6 9-10 we read that prophecy about shut their eyes make their ears heavy lest they see with their their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and be converted now this is pretty amazing church all four gospels record that scripture and even paul says it in acts 28 so this is not just a regular old testament scripture this is a major turning point scripture for the old testament god was going to finally say okay i'm going to give you over to blindness i'm going to give you over to deafness i'm going to give you over to having no sense no understanding because i gave you 1500 years now look at that church the gentiles have had 2 000 years right and look how merciful god is to us israel had 1500 okay so let's just read one malachi can you get matthew 13 verses 14 and 15. now remember this is in all four gospels plus the book of acts this is a very often quoted scripture this isaiah 6 9-10 about ears but can't hear so malachi it's matthew 13 verses 14 and 15. and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand then seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull appearing and their eyes they have clothes at any time they should see with their eyes and here with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them praise god now think about that church that scripture laid there for 800 years we've only been waiting 55 for the rapture right brother and tell us about the rapture shot voice trump we've been only waiting 55 they waited 800 years for these scriptures and the messiah came the government's on his shoulder all the but there was also the consequences when they would reject him but these scriptures waited 800 years then jesus quotes that scripture and brings it this day this scripture is fulfilled oh my one of these days the scripture of the rapture is going to be fulfilled praise god and we want to be a part of that by god's amazing grace now um paul quotes this in acts 28 verses 25 to 28 it's rather long but let's just read the last verse solidity can you read acts 28 28 because paul specifically says god is going to blind israel but then open the eyes of the gentiles so that's acts 28 28. be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of god is sent to the gentiles and that they will hear it all right so see salvation of god is sent to the gentiles it was first sent by jesus during his life to the the jews the lost sheep or the house of israel but now because god is blind of them he goes now and sends salvation to the gentiles and they will hear it aren't you glad you're one of those that heard it praise god i've heard the salvation of jesus christ and it's changed my life it's delivered me from my sins my dead and sins condition and it's quickened me in the power of the holy spirit unto life praise god amen now there's uh four scriptures paul writes in romans 11 that explain israel's blindness okay so let's look at those so malachi romans 11 that you can go to romans 11 2. um so we can pick up uh numerous things here so malachi romans 11 can you read seven and eight what then israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for what the election hath obtained and the rest were blinded the coordinates is written god has given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and they should not hear unto this day thank you lydia can read verses 9 and 10. and david says that their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a recompense unto them that their eyes be dark and that they may not see and bow down on their back all the way amen now we see from these scriptures there's an elected group of israelites that believe okay they're called the remnant group that received christ and the rest were blinded let me go back and look at romans 11 25 real quick here malakai can you read romans 11 25 for i would not rather that you should be ignorant of this mystery unless you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happening in israel to the fullness of the gentiles we come in all right that's right thank you that was our opening scripture as well yep so the rest are blinded and these scriptures are actually quoting paul's actually quoting isaiah 29 verse 10 and psalm 69 verses 22 and 23. i love how paul writes the new testament constantly quoting the old testament right it's like a prophet referring to other prophets a genuine prophet will always quote previous prophets right and believe their prophecies praise god so the purpose of the blinding of israel was to save the gentiles we can see it clearly now i'm going to read romans 9 31 and 32 and 33 but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling stone as it is written behold i lay in zion a stumbling stone and rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed praise god so the reason they're blinded went unbelief because they stumbled at the stumbling stone they failed to believe in jesus christ they failed to step on that stone right or to to uh to benefit from that stone instead they stumbled over it and fell they tripped over it rather than uh benefiting from the stone all right remember the scripture says uh literally read romans 11 24. uh i i just want to go through this so it's clear as we approach the main text of this chapter romans 11 24 huh which is wild foreign nature and were grafted contrary to nature to a good old tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be grafted into their own olive trees amen so this scripture again proves that israel was part of that holy tree but they were cut out but they'll be grafted back in praise god okay malakai you read romans 11 27 this scripture says the merciful god is going to remember his covenant and eventually take away israel's sins we know brother and preached that and we know it's part of daniel uh chapter nine i believe about gabriel's six-fold purpose and his visit to daniel so how can i go ahead for this is my covenant unto them when i should take away their sins praise god so god is going to keep his covenants and he will he will take away all israel's sins just like he's washed away our sins through faith in jesus christ all right so that's the background we made it through good i still got about 15 minutes okay great so we'll get started on this and we'll see how far we go by the grace of the lord so this is a mystery so what is the confusion right almost every church can recognize that israel is blind spiritually because they just got to read the verses we just read they just got to read romans 11 right but what's the what's the mystery about it uh the mystery centers on this can spiritually blinded jews be saved or they are they all destined for hell right so this this mystery covers salvation uh are all blinded jews who've lived for the past two thousand years uh saved or not is it possible for blinded jews to be saved can blinded jews living now be saved and so here's the revelation that god has given to us through his prophet the revelation of the mystery of israel's spiritual blindness is this the covenant keeping god still saves blinded jews who faithfully follow old testament commands promising them white robes of eternal life and of course we get that revelation from the fifth seal where they cry out or the jews are under the altar crying out for vengeance and jesus says wait a little while until your fellow servants have been killed as well and then the bible said and white robes were given unto them at a future time of course we know that will be the white throne judgment okay so that's the revelation now it seems on the surface level but do we want a surface level understanding the bible children no we don't want to we want a deep revelation in the bible it seems on the surface level that jesus says i am the way the truth and the life and no man comes to the father but by me and so we we hear a lot of evangelicals say no you have to have faith in christ to be saved jews are all lost jews are all lost but they fail to go deeper in the scriptures that we're going to get into in the next few services lord willing as we preach on the revelation of israel's blindness and it's because of this we've already looked at it last spring but just to remind ourselves it's because of this when god gives a covenant it stands forever until he ends it right you should remember the uh noahic covenant the noah covenant doesn't that still stand today have we had a worldwide flood since noah's day no because that covenant still stands right think of the other covenants there's the david covenant now that was conditional the eden covenant many uh promises still stand from the eden covenant right with uh men leading their wives so headship of the man over the woman that's the eden covenant or the adamant covenant i'm sorry the adamic covenant adam's covered in other words and so that's the revelation that we get when we read the bible so in other words a blinded jew even though he's rejecting the current message of the hour the new covenant well god knows that he's blind to them they can't see it so god lets them be received by keeping the previous covenant they were under since they can't receive the current covenant god lets them live under the previous covenant and if they're faithful to that covenant then god receives them amen now that's a real good holy ghost deep understanding of god's word praise god the only way you get that is by reading the scripture and hearing god's prophet teach it in the seals amen that's the only way our only place i heard it and the beautiful part was he ends many of those sermons with that's thus saith the lord praise god so we have to worry about people you know i get it many times people shooting surface level scriptures at me saying oh no jews can't be saved john 14 6 and all these things that doesn't move us because we've gone deeper in the scripture the holy spirit has taken us deeper in the mind of god praise god we don't have a surface level understanding we have a deep understanding of the heart of god and we see god keep all of his covenants until it's his time to end them but if he hasn't entered them they're still in effect and people benefit we still benefit from the adamant covenant right the noah noahic covenant we still benefit from the abrahamic covenant praise god we still benefit from all these covenants and so jews are still benefiting from the mosaic covenant hallelujah amen thank the lord sometimes i just enjoy the word so much i gotta amen what i'm saying praise god so um now in our last few minutes here we've got about 10 minutes by god's grace in the book i'm showing six biblical evidences that solidify the fact even blinded jews can be saved and i'll list them now we'll just get to the first one tonight the first proof is jesus's prayer for forgiveness for israel on the cross that's the first proof jews can still be saved the second proof is paul's teaching in romans 11. the third proof is the foreshadowed events of joseph's life from the old testament okay the third proof is the fifth seal i'm sorry the fourth proof is the fifth seal the fifth proof is god's righteous judgment based upon knowledge and the sixth proof is god's unconditional covet covenant with israel through abraham you guys remember that that covenant is unconditional right as far as god is going to keep that unconditionally anyone who does their part of the covenant god will receive him because it's unconditional right there wasn't going to be an ending time during human history praise god so let's get our bibles to let's just go through this section here and then we'll be done tonight by god's grace while hanging on the cross and dying after being beaten worse than any man could ever be beaten in the past present or future jesus utters these beautiful words lydia can you read luke 23 34 some of the most beautiful words uh recorded in scripture luke 23 34. then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his arraignment and cast lots amen this reminds me of that song this is amazing grace praise god amazing this is amazing unmerited favor although his own people according to the flesh called for the blood of their own messiah he breathed mercy on many of them instead of judgment okay and so see see how jesus says he says there have to be some blinded because they don't know what they're doing right now some of them did right we know judas knew what he was doing right children because the bible said he was the son of perdition so he was going to go to destruction his soul was going to be is eventually going to be destroyed so when jesus said father forgive them he meant the ones that were blinded to it didn't mean the ones that were purposeful doing it and the ones that are going to have to answer because they purposely were killing the messiah but this is amazing grace to the group that was blinded there that didn't know they were crucifying the messiah so see jesus words reveal why some blind jews from his time period could still be saved they didn't know what they were doing how many of you would hold it against somebody if they didn't know what they were doing you wouldn't hold it against them it might hurt you right you might be disappointed you might be sad but if they didn't know then you wouldn't hold it against them so the principle is spiritually blinded jews cannot fully understand the consequences of accepting i'm sorry i'm rejecting christ just like a natural man innocently trips over an object in his path uh so so the same thing happened to blinded jews they unintentionally stumbled over the stumbling stone they stumbled over jesus's life right they didn't understand it they didn't understand his actions they didn't understand his miracles they didn't understand his words but praise god we understand that praise god we understand his life his actions his words we understand the gospel it's good news to us tonight is it not it's such glorious good news for us tonight but there was a group at the cross not everybody but there was a group at the cross and of course that didn't even attend the crucifixion that were blinded to it they didn't know what was happening they didn't know it was the messiah dying okay and this is true because of jesus christ's own words and notice he offers them what forgiveness blinded groups that don't know what they're doing god can offer them forgiveness and mercy now let's look at the other side the the sad part there was a group in malachi turn to psalm 69 if you could there was a group at the cross that knew he was the messiah right because remember nicodemus come up and said master we know we know you're a master in israel and no man could do these things except god was with you so many of those sanhedrin leaders imagine caiaphas and other ones they knew he was the messiah and like judas is scared he sold out the son of god uh a holy man so he knew what he was doing he'd seen the miracles for three and a half years judas knew what he was doing so malachi can you read psalms 69 [Music] and let me look up the exact scripture there's i i list eight in the book but i don't want to read all those for time's sake here tonight so i'm 69 it's 20 through 28 but they're just such a beautiful portion here 20 to 28. well you know why don't you why why do we split it malcolm you're not uh so malakai read 20 through 24. reproach has broken my heart and i'm full of heaviness and i looked for some to take pity but there was none for comforters but i found them they gave me also a goal for my me and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink let their table become a snare before them and that would should have been for their welfare they'd become a trap but their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their wounds continually to shake far out that indignation upon them unless they wrathful anger take hold of them okay so here we see the suffering servant jesus christ his heart was broken remember brother ram said he died of a broken heart look what it says reproach hath broken my heart his own people reproaching him railing at him accusing him mocking him he was full of heaviness i imagine that's probably like a important greek word i can't look that one up on here now you ever thought of that he looked for pity but nobody had pity on him when something bad happens don't you want somebody to feel sorry for you oh go get somebody some ice they hurt themselves right have pity on them nobody had pity on jesus he said i found no one to give me pity they offered him gall for meat they gave him vinegar to drink which would make it worse so the judgment is put on them in verses 22 23 24 25 let their habitation be desolate none dwell in their tents for they persecute him whom not a smitten and they talk to the grief of those whom thou has wounded now look at verse 27 add iniquity unto their iniquity so see they knew what they were doing iniquities when you know you purpose you already know it's right i'm sorry you already know it's wrong and you do it anyway so add iniquity onto their iniquity and let them not come into thy righteousness so there were some that were going to be totally blotted out and we'll get to it right here verse 27 let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not written with the righteous so see church that gives us the idea there's multiple books right there's a book of people that are living currently and when they die their name must be removed from that book but then there's a group that's written with the righteous so see there was people that because they crucified christ because they said away with him away with him their names were removed off the book of life because they turn down the author of life all right so that's a scripture hopefully that's new to some of you maybe you haven't found that one before was that new to you children have you kind of knew or had you read that one before okay i thought that'd be a blessing i i hadn't read that one for a long long time that was a beautiful scripture to see that there were some there that were they were saying crucify him crucified and they didn't know what they were doing but there was some there that were saying crucify him crucify away with him and they knew what they were doing god said i'll forgive the one that doesn't know but we're going to add iniquity to the ones that did know and their names will be removed from the book of life that's amazing that's quite astonishing and only god is the one right god lets the angels know i remember her brother ben rod say that the angels will come and sever the righteous away from the wicked or vice verse of the wicked away from the righteous only god and the angels truly know so see there were some in the multitude that were just ignorantly caught up in the moment and they joined the mob maybe unintentionally for this group jesus prayed for mercy jesus wouldn't pray for their forgiveness in vain right would jesus pray a vain prayer is god going to turn down the prayer of jesus christ absolutely not that's his son that's his holy son so jesus's prayer cannot be denied anyone that says jews can't be saved doesn't know the scripture jesus christ prayed forgive them that don't know they're missing out on salvation they don't know they're crucifying the lamb that's why i believe more and more that people can be saved on the day of judgment and not even realize because right here they didn't even realize what they were doing and yet jesus prayed father forgive them when they don't know what they're doing see god definitely heard jesus prayer he'll pardon the blind of jews who didn't know what they were doing when they turned their backs on their own savior god's forgiveness is so great he pardons jesus own disciples who desert him in his greatest hour of trial what do you want to be there to help your friend or your brother or your sister in their worst moment what did you want to be there well jesus even jesus didn't have anybody in his hardest moment no one to pick him up no one to help him yet he says father forgive them we know of course though john and the few women were present at the cross but none could save him none could save him now that doesn't show god's love i don't know what it does god is so merciful even when some get caught up in it they get caught up in crucifying and condemning the son of god jesus still says i'll forgive those that didn't know what they were doing but i'm not going to forgive those that knew what they're doing so malachi if you'll come praise god hallelujah thank you jesus thank god for his amazing love let's see him there oh love of god how rich and pure let me pop the lyrics here [Music] the love of god [Music] is [Music] and thank god [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] after looking at jesus love he could forgive someone many
