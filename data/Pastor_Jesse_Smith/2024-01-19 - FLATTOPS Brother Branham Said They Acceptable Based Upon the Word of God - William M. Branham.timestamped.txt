[0:03] is it wrong to have a flat top haircut
[0:07] no brother I just say that see I don't I
[0:09] don't think God cares how a man cuts his
[0:12] hair as long as he cuts
[0:15] it greetings friends in the matchless
[0:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:20] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:22] viewer's question I received by email he
[0:26] asked our flat top haircuts wrong this
[0:29] brother is from an overseas country in
[0:31] Africa and he said this topic is
[0:34] dividing the Brethren the truth is that
[0:36] flat top haircuts are not sinful
[0:38] according to brother brandham as this
[0:40] video will show but first i'm Pastor
[0:43] Jesse Smith I pastored bride of Christ
[0:45] Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA for 17
[0:48] years and I defend the Bible revelations
[0:50] that Jesus Christ revealed to his humble
[0:53] genuine Prophet brother William Branham
[0:56] and also defend brother bram's Godly
[0:58] character against the accus accusers of
[1:00] brother brandham who are often foolishly
[1:03] slandering brother brandham and my often
[1:05] prayer is that they will repent and ask
[1:07] God for forgiveness for slander friends
[1:10] it's sad to hear about the division in
[1:12] this African country but it is
[1:15] understandable in one way especially if
[1:17] the Brethren don't have access to all of
[1:18] brother Ram's quotes on a particular
[1:20] topic it's also understandable because
[1:22] from 1959 to
[1:25] 1963 brother brandham spoke negatively
[1:28] about Flatt tops eight times and never
[1:30] spoke positively between that 5-year
[1:33] time period but what a lot of people may
[1:36] not know is that the final two mentions
[1:38] of flattop from Brother brandom were
[1:41] 1964 and he said they were not sinful in
[1:44] 1964 and you'll see brother BR was asked
[1:47] directly were Flatt Toops wrong and he
[1:49] said no before getting this quote I just
[1:52] want to share a few of the negative
[1:54] quotes from Brother Brenham I'm not
[1:55] going to play them I'm just going to
[1:57] read them I personally don't feel like I
[1:59] need to go through all the eight
[2:00] negative quotes but you can understand
[2:02] the context in one quote brother brandom
[2:04] said an old man wants to be a teenager
[2:07] again so he'll get a flat top haircut
[2:10] with a duck tail in the back he wants to
[2:12] be like one of these rock and roll Kings
[2:14] well the ram said it's a sin and
[2:16] disgrace now it's a sin and disgrace for
[2:18] a man to be like a rock and roll king to
[2:21] do the sins of rock and roll Kings but
[2:23] as brother R will tell us later the
[2:25] Bible doesn't condemn flat top haircuts
[2:27] in a second quote brother R said a bunch
[2:29] of Flatt top haircuts Ricky who run
[2:32] around with women with bobbed hair so
[2:35] brother random Associates Flatt top
[2:37] haircut boys with Bob teed women now of
[2:40] course Bob tear is sinful that's 1
[2:42] Corinthians 11 1-16 any honest Bible
[2:46] reader knows that in another quote
[2:48] brother random was basically rebuking
[2:50] JFK but he said the Americans wanted a
[2:53] flat top Ricky a modern Elvis of the day
[2:56] smart educated politician with a genius
[2:59] brain you got it he said now of course
[3:01] JFK did not have a Flatt top haircut but
[3:05] it seems brother brandham is saying the
[3:07] worldly men and women got what they
[3:09] wanted a modern politician who is no
[3:12] doubt a sinful man hopefully he repented
[3:14] before he was assassinated but we don't
[3:15] know but it's the association brother
[3:18] Brandon is making with with a modern
[3:20] trendy politician who is a sinner and
[3:23] one more quote brother was talking about
[3:25] popular sex Queens he said don't
[3:27] identify yourself with one of these flat
[3:30] Elvis Presley and I'm not even sure if
[3:32] Elvis Presley ever had a flat top I'm
[3:34] not sure and then he mentioned Pat Boon
[3:36] he said let Christ reflect himself in
[3:39] you so we can see from these quotes
[3:41] brother Ram was basically associating
[3:43] modern sinful men like Elvis Pat Boon
[3:46] and JFK with the Modern Trend of that
[3:49] day the modern haircut for men the
[3:51] popular trendy haircut was Flatt tops
[3:54] but of course some of these men did not
[3:55] even have Flatt tops now let's get to
[3:57] the main quote where brother random says
[3:59] Flatt top haircuts are not sinful this
[4:02] quote is from questions and answers part
[4:04] 2
[4:04] 1964 August 23rd evening service so
[4:08] let's listen to the question brother BR
[4:09] has directly asked a question about flat
[4:12] top haircuts let's listen to the quote
[4:14] brother BR is it wrong to have
[4:18] a flat top haircut now friends right
[4:22] after this question brother Ram tells a
[4:24] story of a woman he slapped on a leg I
[4:27] think on a bus after they laughed at a
[4:29] joke together because he didn't know she
[4:31] was a woman because she was dressed like
[4:33] a man which is an Abomination according
[4:35] to Deuteronomy 22:5 and Friends remember
[4:38] my 63rd video is called Abominations in
[4:41] the Bible please go watch that video if
[4:43] you don't understand how some of the Old
[4:45] Testament Abominations carry over to the
[4:47] New Testament I'll leave a link to that
[4:50] video in the description a related video
[4:52] is my 62nd video do the Ten Commandments
[4:55] apply to Christians so please rather
[4:57] than criticizing me if you disagree
[5:00] please humbly go watch the video humbly
[5:02] read your Bible pray and I believe if
[5:04] you do that you'll see that God carries
[5:07] over many moral Commandments from the
[5:09] Old Testament into the New Testament
[5:12] it's undeniable so I plead with you
[5:14] especially if you're an accuser brother
[5:16] brandom or an accuser of me please
[5:18] humbly go watch the video and look at
[5:20] the Bible verses that I used the Bible
[5:23] is my absolute the Bible was brother
[5:25] brandom's absolute so please go humbly
[5:28] study the script scripture if you are a
[5:31] Berean before you put negative comments
[5:33] on this video and as I've told a person
[5:37] in the comments recently yes I will
[5:39] delete comments and I will block people
[5:41] if they no longer debate with respect if
[5:44] they troll me if they name call me
[5:46] unjustly I'm here to help people but I'm
[5:49] also here to warn people as Colossians 1
[5:51] says and after I've warned them if they
[5:53] continue to act disrespectful I'll block
[5:56] them and then of course I'll pray for
[5:58] their repentance
[6:00] brother Ram told this story about
[6:01] accidentally slapping this woman on the
[6:03] leg because he said Sometimes women get
[6:05] haircuts like men and that's true I see
[6:07] a lot of elderly women in my area they
[6:09] get haircuts just like men my wife and I
[6:12] were just talking it's so sad you see
[6:14] elderly couples and you can't tell
[6:15] really who's the man or woman sometimes
[6:18] because they have the same haircut same
[6:20] pants same shoes it's a really sad
[6:23] disgrace anyways I thought I would play
[6:25] this story brother Ram tells right after
[6:27] being asked about Flatt tops it is a
[6:29] funny story in one way and sad of course
[6:31] in another way that a woman would be so
[6:34] abominable that she would dress and act
[6:37] and sound just like a man let's listen
[6:39] to the quote I I suppose this is a man I
[6:43] I hope it is well now some women do that
[6:48] sure I was going up on a bus one time I
[6:50] State game warden here going up here I
[6:52] sit there and a man was talking like
[6:54] that had a welder's cap on Isis talking
[6:56] to him and he was going ahead smoking a
[6:58] cigarette had a welder glasses pushed up
[7:00] like that was right up here around
[7:01] sellers bird and I sitting there talking
[7:03] to that fell he said something and we
[7:04] all got laugh and I hit him on the leg I
[7:06] said boy that that really Takes the Cake
[7:08] doesn't it and I sitting there like that
[7:10] and directly some a woman sitting across
[7:12] there said say Ruth are you going
[7:22] to had on overhauls great big burle just
[7:25] like a man sitting there smoking a
[7:27] cigarette and blowing it out her nose I
[7:28] thought it was a man
[7:30] sound about dropping a sulene torch and
[7:32] doing something hit on somebody's head
[7:33] and knocked the watch called off and
[7:34] start laughing I laughed to and slapped
[7:36] her right on the
[7:37] leg thinking it was a man I didn't know
[7:40] the difference you can't tell him and
[7:42] the Bible said any woman that puts on a
[7:44] garment pertaining to a man it's an
[7:45] Abomination there we are then friends
[7:48] after this story brother answered the
[7:50] question and said no flat tops are not
[7:52] wrong to have because he didn't think
[7:54] God cares how a man cuts his hair as
[7:56] long as he cuts it of course he goes
[7:59] back to the Bible 1 Corinthians 11
[8:01] 1-16 I love brother Ram's answer because
[8:04] it again shows how he was a word Prophet
[8:07] going back to the Bible because his
[8:08] absolute was the Bible he goes to the
[8:11] Bible for the answer I love that about
[8:13] brother brandham and remember friends
[8:14] brother brandham wasn't Perfect by any
[8:16] means he never said that anyone that
[8:18] says that is a liar and a deceiver and
[8:20] has an antichrist Spirit but on brother
[8:22] ROM's major doctrines from the Bible as
[8:24] I've stated on many of my videos he was
[8:26] exactly right by the help of the Holy
[8:28] Ghost and brother even gave us thus
[8:30] sayith the Lord on numerous doctrines
[8:32] and Mysteries I wrote about that in my
[8:35] 2021 book The 12 New Testament
[8:38] Mysteries so now in this quote you'll
[8:40] hear brother brandom say I just say that
[8:43] regarding Flatt top haircuts so eight
[8:46] times brother brandom just Associated
[8:48] Flatt tops with other sinful actions of
[8:50] his day but that did not mean Flatt tops
[8:53] were sinful themselves so it just seems
[8:56] Flatt tops were just a trendy popular
[8:58] haircut that people were talking about
[9:00] maybe in the news but there was nothing
[9:02] sinful about the flat top haircut let's
[9:05] listen to the quote no brother if you
[9:07] want a flat top hair tiut I tell you you
[9:10] just wait to get about my age you'll
[9:12] have
[9:13] one it's all right I didn't mean that
[9:16] like that buddy bless your heart if you
[9:17] believe brother Braham tell you the
[9:19] truth I don't think God says anything
[9:21] about man his his covering is just long
[9:23] as he cuts his hair if he lets his hair
[9:25] go down long like a woman the Bible says
[9:27] it's a shame for a man to do that
[9:29] but now if as long as you got your hair
[9:31] and you're a little boy and I know I've
[9:33] said a whole lot about it you Ricky with
[9:35] that plat top haircut and all like that
[9:37] and things like that but I I just say
[9:39] that see I don't I don't think God cares
[9:41] how a man cuts his hair as long as he
[9:44] cuts it because his head is God but a
[9:48] woman's head is a man so this short
[9:51] quote ends with brother BR giving a
[9:52] Stern warning to women who cut their
[9:54] hair and this of course relates to the
[9:56] video I made about why did brother
[9:57] brandom say a man could divorce his wife
[10:00] if she cut her hair it's video number
[10:02] 129 if you want to watch that I'll leave
[10:04] that in the description as well in
[10:08] closing friends it's a joy to defend the
[10:10] Bible revelations God gave to brother
[10:12] brandham as as Philippians 1:7 And1 17
[10:15] say Paul said in the defense and
[10:17] confirmation of the gospel and then he
[10:20] says knowing that I am set for the
[10:22] defense of the gospel and even this week
[10:24] I was thinking of how we have to defend
[10:26] the gospel there's a beautiful type of
[10:28] that in the oldest Testament Israel had
[10:30] to fight to possess the promised land
[10:33] but then after that once they were in
[10:34] the land they had to fight to defend the
[10:36] promised land and so by God's grace we
[10:38] do that we defend the Bible revelations
[10:40] of this hour the end time message that
[10:42] God has revealed to his servant his
[10:44] Prophet brother William brandham I want
[10:46] to end though with a prayer for Unity in
[10:48] this African country as St Paul prayed
[10:51] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[10:53] spirit endeavoring means giving
[10:55] diligence to keep Unity it means
[10:58] exerting oneself giving effort to keep
[11:02] the unity and to end the division or
[11:04] stop the division it's in Ephesians 4
[11:07] veres 2-6 with all loneliness and
[11:10] meekness with long suffering forbearing
[11:11] one another in love endeavoring to keep
[11:13] the unity of the spirit in the bond of
[11:15] Peace so I pray for these African
[11:17] brothers that they'll have the bond of
[11:19] Peace they'll choose to love rather than
[11:21] criticize one another and divide from
[11:24] each other there's one calling one
[11:25] Spirit even as you are called in one
[11:27] hope of your calling one Lord One Faith
[11:29] one baptism one God and Father of all
[11:32] who's above all and through all and in
[11:34] you all so let's have a word of prayer
[11:36] father God I pray your great Holy Spirit
[11:38] Lord will use this video to help the
[11:40] Brethren there in Africa lord it's
[11:42] understandable how there could be a
[11:43] little bit of confusion here especially
[11:45] if the Brethren haven't heard all the
[11:46] quotes So Lord we just ask that the holy
[11:48] spirit will bring Unity forgiveness if
[11:51] people have hurt one another I pray they
[11:53] will endeavor or give diligence give
[11:55] effort to bring the unity of the Holy
[11:58] Spirit May the churches be unified for
[12:00] the glory of God may they take every
[12:01] question back to the absolute the word
[12:03] of God and I pray God you'll do a great
[12:05] work of the Holy Spirit of healing and
[12:07] unity and love of the Holy Ghost In
[12:10] Jesus Christ's name
[12:12] amen if you have any questions concerns
[12:15] or testimonies about this video please
[12:16] contact
[12:18] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[12:21] the desire of your
[12:22] [Music]
[12:24] heart
