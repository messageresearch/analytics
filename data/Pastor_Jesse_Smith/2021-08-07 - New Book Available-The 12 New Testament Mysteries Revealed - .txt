TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ my second book is now available uh the title is the twelve new testament mysteries revealed rapture wisdom for christ's bride the book is now available on amazon in paperback the kindle version is still pending it's awaiting approval from amazon so i apologize about the delay there now the audio book is free on my personal website pastor jesse smith dot com forward slash 12 mysteries book i have 6 out of the 14 chapters finished on the audio books i'll be working on that project to finish it up in the next month or two lord willing and recall friends i still have the audio book free for the first book called restoring christian modesty now friends the purpose of this book is twofold first for message believers it gives them a bible foundation to prove that brother branham finished all the mysteries of god in the bible and what we mean by that is any doctrine that was called a mystery in the new testament has been revealed according to revelation 10 verse 7 it was given to the seventh church age messenger which we know was william branham if you look up the word mystery in the concordance the word mystery is used 27 times 12 of them are bible doctrines and that's what the book teaches brother branham actually said thus saith the lord on 6 out of the 12 mystery so we have prophetic proof that the mysteries of god are finished and half of them are backed with thus saith the lord these 12 mysteries were foreshadowed in at least two places in the bible elijah's twelve stones that he used to restore the altar of worship before the fire fell i believe that typed brother branham are restoring the 12 new testament mysteries before the fire fell which is the latter rain also the 12 pieces of shoe bread i believe we're a type of the new testament worshiper feasting on the 12 mysteries that brother branham revealed to us by the power of the holy spirit in fact friends brother branham taught this revelation in the sermon fellowship by redemption in 1955. now he didn't mention 12 new testament mysteries but he described our worship as new testament believers as an anti-type of the old testament tabernacle of moses so for example the outer court was the washing of the water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ now in the holy place you had three furniture pieces first you had the light of the seven golden candlesticks which type the anointing of the seven church ages is the same in every church age and that represented the anointing of the holy spirit for sanctification the second furniture piece was the table of shoe bread which is the bread or truth of the gospel and that's where i believe this book comes in the 12 new testament mysteries the third piece was the altar of incense which showed you had to have a sincere prayer life to take you into the third place the holiest of holies or the baptism of the holy ghost so see friends we can understand all the mysteries and not have charity according to first corinthians 13 but new testament worshipers should have the truth and remember the bread represents truth according to first corinthians 5 verse 8 paul said we worship with the unleavened bread of sincerity and in truth so the goal of this book again is to teach message believers the truth of the revelations that god gave us through brother branham the doctrinal truth of it that they might develop a prayer life and take them into the baptism of the holy ghost now second purpose of this book friends is to prove to those who do not follow the message that our message is completely bible-based last year i debated uh believe the sign back in september 2020 and their claim is that the message is not based upon the bible but back in november of 2018 when the lord inspired me to start writing this book my goal was to prove that this message is completely backed by the bible so those are the two full purposes of this book now the price is 1995. now friends please know we're not out to make money i already put those quotes from brother branham and in my desire just to spread the message in the previous video about this book now we don't have nothing to sell well i'll take that back the boys has the books and tapes and the pictures i think and so forth in the back of the building and there i buy those books brother gordon lindsey prints those books and i buy them for 40 cents less than i have to sell them then pay for them to be transferred you know what you make you don't make nothing you lose on it's the message and the pictures i think they just about expenses to send them is about we don't want to make nothing we brought nothing into this world it's certain we take nothing out what we're trying to do i wouldn't even let those books be there or those things if i didn't think it would help you some way see and i told the boys if i walk to the bookstand stand around watch a few minutes and see an old dad come up say how much is that book it's uh 50 cents and he reached down only got give it to him anyhow let it go see anyone and can't afford it and anything like that some poor person let him have it it's right it'll come some other way somewhere and so it always has and it always will if you just put god first that's all put god first but our ministry only makes two dollars on these books and remember i didn't make any money on my first book i'm not trying to make any money i'm trying to get the message out now friends if you know anyone who cannot afford this book and their reader and they live in the united states please contact me i'll mail them a free copy if they're not a reader let them know about the website with free resources for this book that have the audio book on it and they can listen to it for free also they can follow along with the pdf version on any smartphone tablet or desktop computer friends we're not a big enough church yet to mail these overseas but this week i had a request from a pastor in nepal for the book so i emailed him the pdf and i sent him a love offering so he can print off a copy in his country and then if he feels led of the holy spirit that the teachings are true he can preach them to his people and lastly friends just remember if you want to stay in contact with my ministry that spreads the gospel of jesus christ the true message teaching to the people you can subscribe to my blog on pastorjessiesmith.com down at the bottom of the page i still plan to leave youtube at the end of this year i do not want to support platforms that limit free speech if you have any questions about this book please contact me i'll put the amazon link in the description along with a link to my personal website god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
