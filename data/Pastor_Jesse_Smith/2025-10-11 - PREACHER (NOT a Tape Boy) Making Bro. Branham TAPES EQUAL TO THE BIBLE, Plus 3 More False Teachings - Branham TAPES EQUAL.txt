TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and that um that I am perfectly infallible that there's nothing and what was some of the awst causing a lot of confusion and uh this church knows that we don't stand for no such Tommy rod as that we believe in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to expose preachers who exalt the tapes of William Brham to being equal with the Bible with the end goal that the listeners will learn to rightly divide the word of truth and keep themselves from the idolatry of worshiping William Brandham's tapes or William Brandom. A couple months ago, I watched a preacher from a youth meeting here in the United States and it was a good faithb buildinging message. And then I even watched the testimonies afterwards and there were a lot of great supernatural testimonies. But even amongst the testimonies, there were numerous false doctrines which I'll go through in this video here by the grace of God. So again, we see that the rain falls on the just and the unjust. Now, I'm not saying this preacher is unjust, but I'm showing how the Holy Ghost falls when people have simple faith in the simple truths of God's word and how God will overlook men's mistakes. Even when I preach and I'll make mistakes, yet God will come down and vindicate the word of God, certain truths that I preach. Not everything, of course, because no man is perfect. This just shows the grace of God to fallible human men that the infallible God would come down and vindicate certain truths and elements or aspects of the sermon. But of course, not every word of the sermon. That would only be the Lord Jesus Christ who every word of every sermon he ever preached was absolutely correct. So, by God's grace, we'll look at this lesson here and hope it's a good lesson that it will help message believers not to idolize the tapes of Brother Brandham, nor Brother Brandham himself. Remember friends, Brother Brandham said to make him infallible is one of the awfulst things you can do. He went on to say, "It's Tommy Rot in this quote from 1962." So, that's one reason why I'm making this video. It is so awful in the sight of God to exalt William Brandom and his tapes to being equal with the Bible. It's awful. It's the Antichrist spirit. It's idolatry and it needs to be called out by the grace of God. I want to make about five points here before I get into the exact quote from the preacher. Point number one is that we must criticize when criticism is due. Brother Bram said this in the spoken word original seed. He was criticizing mega churches that have millions and millions of dollars and were not spreading the gospel like they should. Brother Brandham said, 'I don't feel bad about criticizing. It's due criticism. I don't want to hurt nobody's feelings, but I'd rather hurt some man's feelings than hurt God's feeling. And that's what this video is all about as well. Preachers who worship the tapes should be criticized. They should be rebuked and called out. I won't call out the name of this preacher. Some people have asked me to give names, but friends, just be more careful when we listen to preachers not to believe every single word they say. When you listen to a sermon, be in communion with the Holy Ghost and ask the Holy Ghost to help you discern truth from air so you can accept the truth. So again, idolizing brother Ram's tapes is due criticism. It should be criticized. I have many videos where I've criticized the tape church movement, the Jeffersonville, Brandon Tabernacle tape worship movement, the press play and disobey movement. That needs criticized, that needs rebuked and more people ought to do that by the grace of God. Point number two, it's also a warning video. The Bible says in Colossians 1:28, we preach Christ warning every man, teaching every man in all wisdom. So this video is also a teaching video because we want to present every man perfect or mature in Christ Jesus. We must warn the idolattors. We must listen carefully to what preachers are saying and prove all things as 1 Thessalonians 5 says, "Take everything back to the word." Just like the Brians in Acts 17:11, they search the scriptures daily whether those things were. So we have to do that for brother Brandham. We have to do that for every preacher. And if you don't, you're probably a lazy Christian or just trying to lazily get through life, just get through the sermons without actually spending time with God and having a relationship with God. Point number three, we get the good lesson that evangelists in this case should not teach. An evangelist is not a teacher, just like a pastor is not a prophet. You don't hear me say thus sayith the Lord and give prophecies because I'm not a prophet. Now, I made a recent video where brother Brandham had all five gifts, all five preaching gifts, which is true. So, in the New Testament, you can have a preacher that has more than one gift, but as we'll see from the comments of the preacher on this video, he does not have the gift to teach. He shouldn't be teaching. He should just be evangelizing, which means declaring the truth of the word of God. And that seems to work for him with divine healing and miracles, which is great. That's wonderful. But he has no business teaching the word of God because of the idolatry that he's propagating whether he knows it or not. Brother Ram said in Taking sides with Jesus 1962, "A prophet isn't an evangelist. An evangelist isn't a prophet. A pastor isn't an evangelist. An evangelist isn't a pastor." And then he quotes Ephesians 4:11 about the five-fold preaching gifts. And again, friends, I understand like a pastor can be called out to do some evangelistic work. And I understand an evangelist could eventually be a pastor if God calls them into a different role. But in this case in particular, as you see, this evangelist should not be teaching because he can't rightly divide the word of God on certain simple topics. Point number four is just the point about the power of persuasion. I watched this service. It was a youth meeting here in the United States. And this preacher is so charismatic because of his charm, his passion, his enthusiasm. He causes the audience to believe him because of how he speaks rather than what he speaks. Because he's so good at talking, so emotional, sweating all the way through his shirt, shouting, praising God, dancing all around. The people get emotional and persuaded just because of his charisma. And they're not listening to what he's saying. They're just excited about how he's saying it. You know, the hundreds of youth and adults in attendance at this youth meeting are all jumping up shouting. Preachers are standing and shouting, punching at the air and agreeing with these false doctrines. They're agreeing with idolatry because of the emotional buildup and the power of persuasion. So, as preachers, we must be very careful not to work up people's emotions, but to point them to the word of God. And of course, the Holy Ghost brings emotion. I know the quotes on that. But this is a prime example of too much emotion which causes the people to accept everything the preacher is saying. To accept the idolatry of saying every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord. And friends, remember I got a video series with over 60 proofs that not every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord. I've kept adding to that amount and I have probably over a hundred by now simple proofs that not every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord. Anyone that says that is insane or deceived. Anyone that says every word on tape is thus say the Lord is foolish. They either have no discernment or they've neglected their discernment gift that it does not operate anymore. And they don't believe everything brother said because brother Bam said he's not infallible. So they're lying saying they believe everything when in reality they don't. And the fifth and final point is that tape worshippers, which could be tape boys or even preachers, as this video proves, they will do any kind of mental gymnastics to accept every quote as thus sayeth the Lord. Over the years, I've interacted in comments with people, and I'll just give two simple examples. The first example is the White Horse Rider. Some Jeffersonville people were telling me that the White Horse rider was both the Holy Ghost and the Antichrist. Brother Ram said it was the Antichrist spirit with thus sayith the Lord in 1963, but they were doing mental gymnastics to show that well somehow perhaps the White Horse Rider did start out as the Holy Spirit, but then he transitioned into the Antichrist. They're willing to do any mental gymnastics rather than accepting the quotes that brother Brandham said, "I'm not infallible and I would have been completely wrong about the first seal had it not been for the Holy Ghost that swept down into his room at about noon the day he preached the first seal." So, these tape worshippers are so deceived they'll do anything to try to prove their point. A second example is recently I was again interacting with a tape boy and I showed him the quote from 1956 love where brother Brandham said Jesus saved me from a death of sin and an eternity in hell. So brother Brandham said Jesus saved him from an eternity in hell. And I said, "Is this quote thus sayeth the Lord that Jesus saved brother Brandham from eternity in hell?" Because I said a year later in September 57, Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 part one, brother Brandham said, "Therefore, there cannot be an eternal hell. There's a hell, fire and brimstone. We know that, but there's no eternal hell." And this tape boy went through all this mental gymnastics of using def different definitions of eternal and everlasting to try to prove that the first quote was true that Jesus saved brother Brandham from an eternity in hell. Now why can't he just have enough logic and enough humility to say brother Bram grew in his revelation and his understanding? And the first quote was not thus sayith the Lord. Jesus didn't save anybody from an eternity in hell because there is no hell that lasts eternally. Jesus saved many believers from hell but not an eternal hell. So friends, this is the sad state many tape boys are in. All those tape girls, the male and females and the Jeffersonville movement and now all these preachers. And again, this group that I listen to, they're called the open book group. And they're the ones that call themselves the greatest of all time. Brother Brandham told us not to ever do that, not to call each other great. And yet these preachers keep doing it. So that will be between them and God. But we know this one fact. Pride goes before the fall. We should never call ourselves great. We do not want to get anointed with the pride of life. We want to keep humbling ourselves rather than exalting ourselves. Okay. By God's grace, let's get into these four false teachings here. So, in this youth meeting from a couple months ago, the first false teaching was the worst in my opinion. It was the idolatry of worshiping every word on Brother Ram's tapes. I'll give the quote here. The quote says, quote, "When you confess the word of God, you can't say,"Well, this is what Brother Random said, but let me tell you what I think." That's a coward. But a bold person is one that can just read it and say it and stand behind it, and I stand behind every quote from 47 to 65, from Genesis to Revelation, because we know what we're talking about." End quote. So, the preacher was preaching about what boldness is. He gave a definition from the Greek lexicon and he said the people should be so bold that they stand behind every word from 47 to 65. I'm sorry that is idolatry because he says just like standing behind every word from Genesis to Revelation. That is complete total idolatry. And again hundreds of young people are jumping up and shouting in this open book revival youth meeting. Preachers are standing up, punching the air, shouting. I got the video of it. They're worshiping tapes and happy about it and shouting about it and rejoicing about it. And this proves this brother is not a teacher. If he was a teacher, he would take all the scriptures back to the book of Acts where it really talked about boldness about being filled with the Holy Ghost and searching the scriptures daily whether these things were so. Now, I'll continue on with this quote. Quote, "We're not a bunch of idiots. We're not a bunch of educated idiots." I know there's a lot of stuff that pops up on YouTube, but you've got tapes. Get back in them. I don't care what a polished up hierling. I'm sorry. I'm done playing with these devils. I don't care how fancy. I'm not looking for a PowerPoint. Stay with what's on the tapes. There is no confusion. There's no misunderstanding. It's the sealed book sayings unsealed. If he's saying what's on the tapes, he's an Einstein in my book. End quote. So again, the preacher exalts any preacher that will say every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord to an Einstein. And that's completely wrong. He's not an Einstein. He's an idoltor. Of course, he attacks YouTube preachers, which this brother came at me a couple years ago when I put out the interracial marriage video, and he just attacked me with three quotes. I replied, I kept the replies, but then he deleted all of his comments. So really, who was the coward? It was this brother who was the coward. So, I do have a little history with his brother. I met him face to face. So, he says, "We believe every word from 47 to 65, like Genesis to Revelation, and we're not idiots." And I'm not name calling friends, but this man is deceived. And also, years ago, this man's wife before they got married was posting on I think Instagram maybe, I don't know. And her screenshot said, "Just say amen to every word of the message. Don't doubt or question it. It's that simple. I thank God for choosing me to see the light of this day. Again, this is a complete idolization of William Brandham's tapes. This is total tape worship. You cannot say amen to every word of the message if you're talking about every quote from William Brandham. If you do, then hell is eternal. If you do, then the white horse rider is the Holy Spirit and the antichrist spirit at the same time. If you do, then the entire world was blown up with just craters and things and tree stumps left by 1977. Friends, any honest person would admit that the tapes are not infallible. Yes, there are infallible statements with thus sayith the Lord on the tapes, but not every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord. So, this tape worship runs in the family. Husband and wife both worship the tapes. And then he's basically saying that only a devil would say you can't stand behind every word from 47 to 65. So, he's calling people like me devils. He's calling anyone that uses any type of discernment devils. So friends, this is a very dangerous place to be in. May God have mercy on this man. And yet hundreds of youth, hundreds of adults, and dozens of preachers up front will all shout, punch the air, and agree with this. It's so sad. Now, the second false teaching was God's not in heaven. The preacher is preaching. And here's the exact quote. Quote, "Deity is not in heaven. deity is in this city state in a youth camp tonight in the redeemed flesh of the new generation of the open book and they've got a word confession end quote now friends there are two quotes where brother Ram says deity is not in heaven but he never majored on it and he never said thus sayith the Lord think about that friends how could deity not be in heaven that means when we pray our prayers don't go to heaven yet the Bible says our prayers are collected in vials in heaven and will be poured out. This proves this evangelist should not teach the word of God. This evangelist never studied this topic out very well at all. In 1964, brother Ram said, "Tonight to look to the temple where Jesus stands at the right hand of the majesty with his own blood, the voice of the sign." So, Brother Ram says, "Of course, Jesus Christ tonight in 64 sits at the right hand of the majesty on high in heaven." There's many quotes like this of course throughout the entire message. So this evangelist is contradicting other quotes from brother Brandham. So this false teaching of God's not in heaven. It breaks the word of God. You can't teach that through the Bible. Yes, I know the mighty angel came down in Revelation 10, but he must have gone back up because brother Ram said that even after the seal's revealed in March of 63 there in 64, he says he's back in heaven or he's in heaven seated at the right hand of the majesty on high. So this evangelist should not teach the word of God. He should just evangelize and declare truths about divine healing, salvation, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And the Bible says in 2 Corinthians chapter 5, to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. Well, that preacher just broke that scripture. How can they be present with the Lord if deity is not in heaven? So this preacher doesn't think thoughts out all the way because he's not a teacher. He just looks at things in a very shallow manner. He just looks at a quote. Why I believe it? I idolize every quote on tape. It must be right. And I'll just keep preaching it. I've heard this preacher use this quote year after year. The third false doctrine actually didn't come from this sermon, but it's an older one. And the evangelist said, Brother Random had vindicated opinions and he was relating it to wearing men's shorts. Yet in 1965, Brother Ram said, "My opinion is just like anybody else's." So this preacher is exalting every opinion of brother Brandham to being divine, which is a false doctrine. Of course, he's worshiping every word on tape. And he doesn't understand that an opinion is a view or judgment not necessarily based on fact or knowledge. So God doesn't vindicate opinions. God doesn't vindicate man's ideas that are not based upon facts or knowledge. God only vindicates his word. God does give us liberty of the spirit, freedom of the spirit, but God does not have any opinions. Everything God says is based upon fact and knowledge because he's the author and finisher of our faith. He's the fountain of all goodness, wisdom, knowledge, understanding, power, love, grace, mercy. But this preacher doesn't know that the fact that men should not wear shorts is not an opinion. That's a Bible teaching from Isaiah 47 where the Bible says in verses 1 through3 that the thighs are nakedness. So again, this evangelist is not a teacher. He doesn't know the definition of the word opinion and is leaving out quotes from brother Brandham like the marriage and divorce quote 65 where he says, "My opinion is just like anybody else's opinion." If we have a modesty teaching such as men should not wear shorts and women should not expose the thigh, there's got to be a Bible foundation for it. And if he was a teacher, he would find that and realize it's not an opinion. It's a Bible teaching on modesty from Isaiah 47. So again, very sad this brother tries to teach, but he's not called to be a teacher. And the fourth and final false statement from this preacher was a prideful statement. I'll read the quote and then explain it here. By God's grace, the preacher is reading from the church age book. Quote, "The word has never failed in the mouth of believing Christians and in this last age. It is here stronger. It is here stronger. Don't get mad at me. It is here stronger in your mouth tonight than Hattie writes. Is that okay? Is it here stronger tonight than in Banks Woods? You know what's pushing against that right now? Is that devil that's fixing to fall at your feet? But go ahead and say, "Amen, end time generation. That ain't nothing but the truth. It's greater in me than any generation before me." End quote. Now friends, this preacher is misapplying this quote or brother Ram's talking about his day in his ministry. In brother Ram's ministry, the word in his mouth was greater than previous generations such as Luther, Wesley, and Isuza. But that's because he had a prophetic son of man ministry. His gift was greater. So therefore, the spoken word was greater. But brother Ram's not saying that every single Christian will have a greater spoken word power now here in 2025 than back in 1965. Brother Ram did not say that the generation after his generation would be greater than brother Ram's generation and have the spoken word in a greater way. And also this quote by brother Ram in the church age book was not thus sayith the Lord. So we can't make it thus sayith the Lord. Now, we know brother Ram talked about the third pole being used in a great way at this time of the squeeze, which we're hoping for that. We're praying for that. But that's not even thus sayith the Lord. There's no thus sayith the Lord statement in that. So, this brother lacks balance. He lacks any teaching on this topic. And friends, notice he just exalted this generation above Hadtie Wright and Banks Woods. Hadty Wright, of course, believed for her children's salvation and God gave it to her. Banks Woods I believe saw the dead fish come back to life if I'm not mistaken. I could be mistaken on that. Now remember Hadtie was the third out of five third pole testimonies in Look Away to Jesus 1963. The first was brother Ram speaking to Sunny Shimp. The second was the squirrels brother Ram spoke. The third was Hadty Wright. The fourth was the Colorado blizzard when brother Ram spoke to the blizzard. And fifth was Mida's miracle. So this evangelist in a youth meeting just exalts all this generation above those third pole examples. And he's really exalting this generation above brother Brandham because brother Brandham was involved with Hadti Wright's third pole experience. Friends, how often are these youth in the youth camp raising the paralyzed like in Acts chapter 3? How often are people getting healed by the sick being in their shadows? Like in Acts 5:15, like brother Ram said, I never want to get in the way of anyone's faith. But let's have discernment to see if this evangelist is interpreting this quote the right way. So this is a very prideful statement. The word is greater in you than it was in Hattie Wright and Banks Woods. Well, that also must mean it's greater than it was in Brother Brandham's mouth. again, exalting this current generation higher than everybody else. And that's what I showed in my bride pride video from a couple years ago. Seasoned message ministers will walk into youth meetings and say, "You're the greatest youth of all time." Seasoned ministers will say, "Today's mothers are the greatest mothers of all time. What about Susanna Wesley? What about Sister Ma? What about Jockabed?" And yet, the people will swallow it down. They'll shout. They'll jump. They'll say, "Amen." not even discerning what's being said. So, in closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God that you'll listen closely to what preachers are saying, especially the preachers who are extremely popular. And I'm happy for every preacher that God moves through their ministry like this evangelist. I'm happy for him in one way, but I'm very sad in another way because mixed in with his truth about faith and healing and the Holy Ghost and miracles is idolatry. And people just swallow it down, think it's right, they just accept it because they're caught up in the emotional moment. So there's the idolatry mixed in, there's the pride mixed in, there's the name calling mixed in. He name calls and calls people devils who don't believe every word on tape. So as the Bible said, let's speak the truth in love. This video is made in love. Love is corrective. I didn't call the brother's name. I'm not trying to defame him or anything. But when I see videos like this of people worshiping the tapes, it does fire me up. I feel the zeal of the Lord to stand for the truth of God and call out these lies to call out this idolatry. Just like the days of Hezekiah I read this morning, Hezekiah became king. He cleaned out the house of God. He destroyed all the idols, stomped them, took them and threw them in the waters to wash it all away. Friends, it's idolatry to worship the tapes of brother Brandham and make them equal to the Bible. The tapes of William Brham are not equal to the Bible. If that's the case, then we now have more books added on to the Bible. But as brother Brandham said, and the Bible says, you can't add one word to the Bible, nor take one word away from the Bible. I pray friends, you'll take heed from this video, take warning from this video to rightly divide the word of truth. I keep praying for these preachers. I'll keep doing that by the grace of God. And may we worship Jesus only. May we know that only one person is infallible. Only one book is infallible from Genesis to Revelation. That's the Bible. Let's be satisfied with that by the grace of God. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. I'm &gt;&gt; very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ. to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He has never failed. [Music]
