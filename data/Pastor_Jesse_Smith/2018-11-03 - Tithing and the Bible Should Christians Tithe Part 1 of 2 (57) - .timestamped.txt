[0:06] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:11] this video is to enter the question
[0:13] should Christians pay tithe the answer
[0:16] is yes according to the Bible not only
[0:18] should they tithe but they should also
[0:20] give offerings
[0:22] here's scriptural proof directly from
[0:24] the New Testament about the necessity to
[0:26] give tithes and offerings there are four
[0:29] New Testament Scriptures that support
[0:30] tithing and offering ties are supported
[0:33] in 1st Corinthians 9 verses 1 to 16 and
[0:36] acts 4 verses 33 to 37 offerings are
[0:41] supported in Luke 21 verse 4 and acts 24
[0:44] 17 definition and origin first the word
[0:50] tithe means tenth or a tenth part 10%
[0:54] tithes originated before the law in
[0:57] Genesis chapter 14 with Abraham being
[0:59] the first type payer around 1900 BC so
[1:04] you and I need to remember that typing
[1:06] is an act of faith God originated before
[1:08] the law then ties were continued during
[1:12] the law about four hundred years after
[1:14] Abraham in 1490 BC as recorded in
[1:18] Leviticus chapter 27 verse 30 finally
[1:22] around 59 ad God confirmed that tithing
[1:25] was ordained even after the law in the
[1:27] New Testament in 1st Corinthians 9 verse
[1:30] 14
[1:32] an example of tithing and offering for
[1:36] example if you were paid $1,000 for work
[1:38] $100 would be 10% and would be your
[1:41] tithe payment you'd have 900 left and
[1:43] would want to give a free will offering
[1:45] to support God's ministry if you gave
[1:47] $10 as an offering that would be an
[1:50] additional 1% making your total giving
[1:53] $110 or 11% you would have $190 left to
[1:58] use as you see fit
[2:01] payments to whom are ties paid as you'll
[2:05] soon see st. Paul teaches ties are paid
[2:08] to New Testament preachers just as Old
[2:10] Testament Saints paid their tithes and
[2:12] offerings to the Levites New Testament
[2:15] Christians are not under the Levitical
[2:16] priesthood but God has ordained a
[2:18] similar system for giving under the
[2:21] Melchizedek Priesthood in the Old
[2:23] Testament the believers brought their
[2:25] tithes and offerings to God's storehouse
[2:27] or tabernacle or temple according to
[2:30] Malachi 3 verse 10 Christians should
[2:32] bring their tithes and offerings to
[2:33] their storehouse or main place of
[2:35] worship which is their local church each
[2:38] local church is led by the pastor or
[2:40] Shepherd which is one of the five
[2:42] preaching gifts according to Ephesians 4
[2:44] verse 11 the ties only not the offerings
[2:48] go directly to the pastor so you can
[2:50] either live on them not having to work a
[2:52] separate job while focusing on studying
[2:55] the Word of God and praying or he can
[2:57] work a regular job and donate most or
[2:59] all the ties to support the churches
[3:01] ministries helping the poor maintaining
[3:03] the facilities and doing missionary work
[3:05] etc the offerings go directly to the
[3:08] church treasury and not to the pastor as
[3:10] they pay for all the other needs of the
[3:12] assembly New Testament tithing
[3:16] scriptural proof number 1 in 1st
[3:19] Corinthians 9 verses 1 to 16 st. Paul
[3:22] replies to those who questioned his
[3:23] apostolic ministry detailing the rites
[3:25] of Ministers which include the right to
[3:28] be compensated for ministering the right
[3:30] to marry a Christian woman as Peter was
[3:32] married and the right to refrain from
[3:34] outside work Paul himself did not always
[3:37] exercise these rights as he did not want
[3:40] to hinder the gospel of Christ but he
[3:42] stated them since some preachers would
[3:44] have to exercise these rights
[3:46] Paul then compares a minister to a
[3:48] soldier a vineyard owner and a Shepherd
[3:51] which all directly benefit from their
[3:53] labor soldiers are paid vineyard owners
[3:55] eat their produce shepherds drink the
[3:58] milk from their flocks Paul even says
[4:00] the Old Testament law gives New
[4:02] Testament ministers these rights quoting
[4:04] Deuteronomy 25 verse 4 which compares
[4:07] preachers to laboring oxen thou shalt
[4:10] not muzzle the mouth of the ox that
[4:12] treadeth out the corn Paul uses a
[4:14] greater to lesser argument to justify
[4:17] his right for preachers to receive money
[4:19] if he supplied spiritual things to the
[4:21] Corinthians the greater blessing it was
[4:24] suitable for him as a preacher to
[4:26] receive material blessings the lesser
[4:28] from them in return the climax of this
[4:32] passage is verses 13 and 14
[4:35] proving tithes and offerings are
[4:36] ordained of the Lord do you not know
[4:39] that they which Minister about holy
[4:40] things live of the things of the temple
[4:42] and they which wait at the altar are
[4:44] partakers with the altar even so hath
[4:47] the Lord ordained that they which preach
[4:49] the gospel should live of the gospel
[4:52] Paul teaches that God wants New
[4:54] Testament preachers to live from the
[4:56] tithes and offerings of the Christians
[4:58] who benefit from their preaching just as
[5:00] or even so the Old Testament ministers
[5:03] the Levites live from the tithes and
[5:05] offerings of Israel a must stop and say
[5:09] that the love of money is a great danger
[5:10] for preachers who receive ties as Paul
[5:14] told Timothy to flee monetary
[5:15] temptations for it is a great temptation
[5:17] ensnare leading to destruction and
[5:20] perdition according to 1st Timothy 6
[5:22] verses 6 through 12 but they that will
[5:25] be rich fall into temptation and a snare
[5:27] and into many foolish and hurtful lusts
[5:29] which drown men in destruction and
[5:31] perdition for the love of money is the
[5:34] root of all evil which while some
[5:36] coveted after they have erred from the
[5:38] faith and pierced themselves through
[5:40] with many sorrows but Thou O man of God
[5:42] flee these things and follow after
[5:45] righteousness godliness faith love
[5:48] patience meekness
[5:51] ministers should not seek to get rich
[5:53] Christ gave all his money away and lived
[5:55] a total life of sacrifice pastors who
[5:59] receive tithes must be faithful stewards
[6:01] for they will give an account of
[6:02] themselves on the day they stand before
[6:04] the judgment seat of Christ for we shall
[6:07] all stand before the judgment seat of
[6:08] Christ Romans 14:10 also even pastors
[6:13] must tithe on the ties they receive God
[6:15] ordains that everyone has to pay tithe
[6:17] even pastors
[6:20] scriptural proof number two acts for
[6:23] verses 33 to 37 gives us a detailed
[6:26] example of how the Holy Ghost
[6:28] immediately led the Saints who were
[6:31] freshly baptized with the Holy Ghost to
[6:33] follow this god-ordained pattern even
[6:35] before God taught it through st. Paul's
[6:37] ministry soon after being born again the
[6:40] believers sold their possessions and
[6:41] laid the money at the feet of the
[6:43] Apostles or preachers who made
[6:45] distribution based upon need and with
[6:49] great power gave the Apostles witness of
[6:51] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and
[6:53] great grace was upon them neither was
[6:55] there any among them that lacked for as
[6:57] many as we're possessors of lands or
[6:59] houses sold them and brought the prices
[7:01] of the things that were sold and laid
[7:03] them down at the Apostles feet and
[7:05] distribution was made unto every man
[7:07] according as he had need
[7:11] offerings scriptural proof number one
[7:14] Jesus allowed a destitute widow woman to
[7:17] pay all of her living in an offering to
[7:19] the temple and he looked up and saw the
[7:22] rich man casting their gifts into the
[7:23] Treasury and he saw also a certain poor
[7:26] Widow casting in thither two mites
[7:28] and he said of a truth I say unto you
[7:30] that this poor Widow hath cast in more
[7:32] money than they are for all these have
[7:34] of their abundance cast in unto the
[7:36] offerings of God but she of her penury
[7:39] hath cast in all the living that she had
[7:43] scriptural proof number two st. Paul
[7:46] himself the apostle prophet and teacher
[7:48] who taught God ordained tithes and
[7:51] offerings in the New Testament paid
[7:53] offerings himself to the temple in
[7:55] Jerusalem and herein do I exercise
[7:59] myself to have always a conscious void
[8:01] of offense toward God and toward men now
[8:04] after many years I came to bring alms to
[8:06] my nation and offerings whereupon
[8:09] certain Jews from Asia found me purified
[8:11] in the temple neither with multitude nor
[8:14] with tumult st. Paul further instructs
[8:17] us on a heart condition when giving it
[8:20] must be cheerful
[8:22] but this I say he which soweth sparingly
[8:24] shall also reap sparingly and he which
[8:26] soweth bountifully shall reap also
[8:28] bountifully everyman accordingly as he
[8:31] has purposed in his heart so let him
[8:33] give not grudgingly or of necessity for
[8:36] God loveth a cheerful Giver this is the
[8:40] end of part 1 please continue viewing
[8:43] part 2 which covers the following the
[8:46] blessings and benefits of paying tithes
[8:48] and offerings consequences of not paying
[8:52] God tithes and offerings if you have any
[8:56] questions about giving tithes and
[8:57] offerings in the New Testament please

[9:03] Christ be the desire of your heart
