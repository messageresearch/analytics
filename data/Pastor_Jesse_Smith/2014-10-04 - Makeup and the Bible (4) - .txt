This video teaches what the Bible says about wearing makeup and facial cosmetics. We learn from reading the Bible that God never asked anyone to paint their face. Instead, God considers the faces He created for us to be fearfully and wonderfully made and He desires one thing to be upon our faces - His Glory, according to 2 Corinthians 3:18. History proves that our nation began with and held the conviction that their faces did not need anything added to them but sadly, the influence of Hollywood changed the minds of millions of people. Our prayer is that these truths from Scripture will set people free from the bondage of trying to "look pretty" according to Hollywood's standards because no cosmetic company can improve upon God's creation.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the Holy Name of Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to present to you perhaps for the first time why some Christian women choose not to wear makeup based upon the Bible's teaching we feel honored and humbled to be able to present to you the following truths out of God's holy Bible and history as you may have never heard anything like this before our prayer is that your heart will be open to hearing these truths out of God's word and that you will be not only a hearer of these truths but a doer meaning that you will choose to present your face the way God intended it without any makeup we also pray you will share these Bible truths with others that you know and love to begin with there is not one scripture in which God commands any woman or man to wear makeup or paint their face in any way if God wanted his daughters to wear paint he would have told them to do so in his word God wants us to present our clean natural faces to others because God created our faces and said our entire bodies were fearfully and wonderfully made even marvelous for thou Hast possessed my Reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well according to the Bible there is no makeup that can improve or make more beautiful the face that God already created for each of us makeup is a superficial and false covering that God did not intend to be added to his creation it's a shame that advertisers in Hollywood have convinced millions that the faces God made for them are not good enough the truth is that your face is best just the way God made it and you can rejoice in the true face God gave you we shouldn't desire a false appearance since the Bible says that charity or love rejoices in the truth according to 1 Corinthians 136 love doesn't rejoice in a false superficial covering but it does rejoice in a true natural appearance from God we will briefly look at what the Bible teaches about makeup then we'll examine the history of our nation and see how we began as a Christian Nation with Godly standards one of which was abstaining from the use of makeup but history will show that eventually the evil influence of Hollywood caused the majority of people to adopt the Heathen practice of painting their faces there are three scriptures that teach Christian women to abstain from wearing makeup they are found in 2 Kings 9:30 Jeremiah 4:30 and Ezekiel 23:40 and literally the rest of the Bible because there are no scriptures in which God commands any woman whether Godly or ungodly to paint her face or wear any facial cosmetic let's explain these three scriptures 2 Kings 9:30 and when J was come to Jezreel Jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out at a window Jezebel was one of if not the most evil woman in the entire Bible she was a murderer of God's prophets and another innocent man named naboth she was a devout worshipper of Idols such as Baal and was guilty of whoredoms and Witchcraft notice that Jezebel is the only individual woman recorded in the Bible as painting her face out of over 440 references to the face in the Bible only Jezebel is named as the one who used facial cosmetics without a doubt face painting and facial cosmetics and makeup are linked to heathenism and idolatry according to Jezebel's behavior and background in the Bible we must learn from truths in the Old Testament as Jesus prophesied that the same Spirit of Jezebel would return and seduce Christians in the new New Testament dispensation according to Revelation 2:20 notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto Idols while we do not believe every woman who wears makeup today is a heathen or idolator we do believe it is our responsibility to humbly speak the truth in love and make our precious Christian friends aware of the roots of wearing facial cosmetics in hopes that some will turn from this ungodly practice we sincerely believe that most people are totally unaware of these scriptures and the history we will soon present so we pray that each believer will open their heart to obeying the gospel of Christ the next scripture shows God speaking through the Prophet Jeremiah to all of Israel his Old Testament people at the time of one of their punishments for committing wickedness and Rebellion against him this scripture shows that his vanity to wear expensive clothing and use makeup just as St Peter tells us in the New Testament that a woman's inner beauty and spiritual adornment of the meek and quiet spirit is a great value in the sight of God and when thou art spoiled What wilt thou do though thou clothest thyself with Crimson though thou deck thee with ornaments of gold though thou renest thy face with painting in vain shalt thou make thyself Fair thy lovers will despise thee they will seek thy life to understand verse 30 we must understand that Jeremiah 4 is a picture of God issuing a sentence of Destruction upon Judah and Jerusalem through Horsemen and bowmen though not a final Destruction for their evil doings bitter wickedness rebellion and foolishness God then speaks in verse 30 that Israel's lovers will despise her and seek to kill her despite her efforts to wear expensive clothing and ornaments and have a painted face notice that Israel was not painting her face to please God and God never asked any woman to wear facial Cosmetics Israel was painting her face to please her idols and the Nations that taught her their Heathen ways sadly in Jeremiah 4:30 God's people were doing the same thing Jezebel did a few hundred years earlier painting their faces in the day of their destruction the third and final scripture about makeup is found in Ezekiel 2340 which was probably spoken near the same time as Jeremiah spoke his prophecy of Destruction but ezekiel's audience was most likely Jews in Babylon due to their Exile from the promised land the entire chapter of Ezekiel 23 portrays Israel as an adulterous woman who lust after the gods of other nations such as Egypt and Assyria here's here's what Ezekiel says in verses 4041 and 43 and 44 and furthermore that ye have sent for men to come from Far unto whom a messenger was sent and lo they came for whom thou did wash thyself paint thine eyes and dexes thyself with ornaments and satest upon a stately bed and a table prepared before it whereupon thou Hast set mine incense and mine oil then said I unto her that was old and adulteries will they now commit whoredoms with her and she with them yet they went in unto her as they go in unto a woman that plth the Harlot so went they in unto aholah and unto aholibah the lwd women we can easily see that God Likens Israel unto a woman who is receiving her adulterous lovers and gives details on how she prepares for her lovers she washes herself paints her eyes or puts on makeup then puts on ornaments and sits on a bed near a table prepared for a meal based upon these three scriptures we conclude God's word is clearly against the use of makeup and facial Cosmetics for the entire rest of the Bible does not offer even one hint of God requesting facial Cosmetics upon any man or woman what God does want on our faces is his glory the Bible says we behold his glory and become changed changed into his image from glory to glory by the spirit of the [Music] Lord let's look at this brief timeline that highlights historical events that relate to our nation's changing attitude toward makeup our timeline begins in the 19th century three sources we found say the following during the 19th century it was considered immoral to paint one's face and make ja up was frowned upon and was associated with prostitution we find then that the majority of Americans were obedient to the word of God in regards to not wearing makeup throughout the entire 19th century which was a continuation of The Obedience from the previous centuries sadly the changes started happening during the 20th century as this nation began rebelling against many of the principles it was founded upon most importantly the principles from the word of God history tells us that obedience began to come to an end during the shocking Roaring 20s the flapper exhibited her Freedom by dancing to Jazz smoking cigarettes she painted on lipstick and Rouge produced by cosmetic companies run by women such as Helena Rubenstein and Elizabeth ardan not long after the Roaring 20s the Great Depression set in in which the majority of Americans began turning to Hollywood to ease their burdens rather than God and immediately began to imitate actors and actresses to ease the sting of economic burdens Americans look to Hollywood more than 85 million people a week Escape their troubles in darken movie theaters many fans imitated the polished makeup of film stars plucked eyebrows dark lipstick gleaming fingernails we learned that as much as possible women also emulated the clothing of movie Queens like Joan Crawford and but now women could be seen everywhere pouting lipstick and dabbing at their noses with a powder puff the Advent of Hollywood and its Stars had made the open use of Cosmetics acceptable but it also brought a new bondage for women that of trying to look like someone [Music] else following the Great Depression and Hollywood's explosion of evil influence rock and roll blues and Soul music became increasingly popular and along with their Fame their Fashions glamorized painted faces as they targeted the Youth of our nation rock and roll blues and soul contributed to youth fashion throughout the 1960s women goop their eyes with black eyeliner and colored ey Shadow today nearly 100 years since the Roaring 20s changed America forever most Americans are totally unaware that our nation once stood upon God's word and abstained from painting their faces we are now a nation in Disobedience and most do not know it fulfilling Revelation 3:17-19 Jesus told us because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with I myself that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent in summary for nearly 150 years our judeo-christian values considered makeup immoral and our nation was obedient to the word of God now for nearly 100 years the sinful influence of Hollywood has glamorized makeup use and S sadly generations of Americans and Christians are totally unaware of these truths our nation has been disobedient to God's word thankfully throughout the years God has sent many witnesses to try and point this nation back to the truth of God's word one such witness was the prophet of God named William brandham let's listen to a quote from 1956 as he pleads with the people of God to abstain from wearing makeup due to its Heathen Roots I just Africa you women is that paint on you know where it come from that's a mark of heathenism they paint their FA and that's where you got it from Heath got Christians wash their [Music] face that might kind Scorch a little brother you better be scorcher and first somewhere else amen the 1980 Bible Almanac reports this teaching that makeup came from Heathen Origins and not from the god of the Bible as it says cosmetics and perfumes Egyptian and Assyrian women use paint as a cosmetic they color their eyelashes and the edges of the eyelids with a fine black powder moistened with oil or vinegar to achieve an effect somewhat like modern mascara we pray we have presented enough Bible evidence and history to prove our conviction to you that the Bible teaches women and men should abstain from wearing makeup we also pray you will receive the words of life we have taught and prayerfully consider whose influence on the subject of makeup you will follow and imitate either the influence of Hollywood and heathenism or the influence of God Almighty and His holy word if God wanted us to wear makeup up he would have put the command in his Bible but he never did that he only asked us to believe his word that the bodies and the faces he gave us were already fearfully and wonderfully made God only desires that his glory be seen on our faces but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord if you'd like more Bible teaching about makeup or any other Bible topic please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
