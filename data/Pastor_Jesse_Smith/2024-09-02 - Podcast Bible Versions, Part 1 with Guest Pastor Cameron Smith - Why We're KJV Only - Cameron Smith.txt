TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but to me the Bible is the infallible word of Goden and I believe that God has watched over his word that there's not one punctuation out of place greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ welcome to part one of our podcast series on Bible translations specifically looking at how the King James version is the only infallible accurate translation of the Holy Bible this will be a short video introduction and then a longer audio podcast will follow so the purpose of this series is to humbly show why I am a King James version only preacher and as you'll see so is my brother Cameron Smith he's a pastor in Napoleon Ohio and as some of you may know in my 2020 debate with Rod Bergen I stated the seven reasons I am a King James version only pastor and as this podcast series will show brother cam has done a lot of research in this area a lot of study so I'm very thankful for that he knows a lot more about this topic than I do so please contact me if you want to reach out and get in touch with brother cam with questions about Bible versions so this is the first part of a few recordings on this topic of King James version only and we hope to have a few more by the grace of God maybe in a week or a couple weeks we'll see how the Lord leads recall Revelation 2218 and 19 If any man adds to the Bible plagues will be added unto him and verse 19 is especially important for this topic If any man takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book I just want to make a quick Point there's over 31,000 verses in the King James version Bible and every other translation takes lots of words away from the King James version Bible so they're in danger of having their part taken out of the book of life is a very very serious thing here's a book brother cam gave me it's called look what's missing and the author of this book David Daniels he only sampled 257 verses remember there's over 31,000 in the King James version he sampled 257 only and I want to show you this I'll do a screenshot of this out of those 257 95% of those 257 are negatively affected in the NIV 91% of them are negatively affected in the ESV and then 78% of them are affected in the Amplified version and those are just a few of the Bible versions remember it's a curse to change just one word or take one word away from God's word and finally I just want to make a few statements about brother brandham our precious Prophet was not explicitly a King James version only preacher as we'll show in future podcasts numerous quotes show this but he has other quotes about not adding or taking away one word of God or not taking away one word of the Bible and so brother Ram's quotes lead me and brother Cam and numerous other preachers to be King James version only because of those quotes I'll put a few of these quotes at the end of the podcast after brother Cam and I get done with our first recording here's a few samples brother brand said a genuine Faith Of God will never add nothing to it and of course that also includes takeaway because he's quoting Revelation 2218 and 19 brother Ram said in 1960 I want to be found innocent of ever trying to add one thing to the word or take away I want to believe it just exactly the way it is teach the people to tow right up to it when brother an went beyond the curtain of time he said in Jezebel religion 1961 I preached every word just exactly the way Paul did don't want to add one thing to it to take one thing away from it just what the Bible said and then spoken word Original Seed brother Bram said there's not one punctuation out of place in God's infallible Bible the word word of God so I'll put some of these quotes at the end hope you enjoy this podcast here it's part one of Bible translations why we're King James version [Music] only God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your host pastor Pastor Jesse Smith in today's podcast we're going to start the next topic of looking at bible versions and we're going to prove by the grace of God that the only trustworthy Bible translation is the King James version the authorized version our listeners will know that I've talked about this off and on for the past few months and we finally got a chance my brother and I to sit down and record the first part to this series hopefully by God's grace so I know this topic will be a blessing to you and again I want to State and most of my listeners will know that I'm not trying trying to create a man-made Doctrine here I'm not trying to cause division here we're just trying to show the truth of God's word and promote the purity of the King James version this is going to all be spoken in brotherly kindness and love it seems most people are just unaware of the facts on this subject and we hope this will be a blessing to all those who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness so with that I want to let my brother cam introduce himself and then we'll get into the topic here by the grace of God all right God bless you you brother it's a blessing to to be speaking with you today about these things um yeah my name is Cameron Smith uh I'm a pastor in thepo Ohio at a church Living Waters and we've been pastoring for about uh almost 16 years and by God's help we have kind of followed that same line you have uh we we desire truth from the inward parts and uh it's our desire brother uh that we might be able to uh Converse on the these things and and to be able to bring some clarification about Bible versions uh it's a very important topic uh I would say even in the message of the hour even right now uh it is more important than it has ever been before and hopefully very soon here we'll be able to get to some of the points to prove that so yeah brother that's uh we appreciate your labor we appreciate your love for the people uh and and your desire to forward them in Christ and I I believe that's desires will yeah I'm very thankful for this topic and uh as I've said before I wouldn't have my current understanding without you brother cam as far as God leading you into these studies and that I've been able to listen to your sermons online it's been a tremendous eyeopener to me so I'm thankful that the Lord LED you into this I mean I've kind of known about this topic over the years in my 2020 debate with Rod Bergen I mentioned the seven reasons I'm King James version only and I've never changed that stance but I appreciate how the Lord LED you into this cuz that's what it's all about like you said it must be for this time in season um that God's put this on your heart the last few years uh because the word of God is being attacked like never before and of course we're nearing the coming of the Lord so I just want to thank you for that brother and uh may the Lord Jesus Christ bless this here Amen brother and I'm and I'm so glad that you've stuck with that King James uh only approach it is the true approach and even now there's more evidence than ever before within the last 10 years that that is 100% factual and if I could start this out brother maybe my testimony just a little bit um we were raised in a Christian home but yet at the uh age of about 1920 uh the late 90s there we had come into a spot where we were actually we gave our lives to the Lord Jesus Christ and we were in the Assemblies of God church and you know the first thing I asked I said well what type of Bible should I get I mean I I want to read the right uh the right version and I I want to be able to understand it and you know what they told me was they told me to actually use an NIV Bible uh so I bought that and uh you know an early Christian you're on fire you're loving the Lord you're you're you're rejoicing at all the things that he's uh now drawn you to because the spirit of God is moving on you that direction so you you instantly get that Zeal and that thrill and uh so we got that Bible and boy did weere it we we read and read and read and I got a big big J one the one that's got all the the notes in it everything like that and one night I was reading and and this is the the opening of my experience with Bible versions um I actually got to uh a place in Matthew 18 where I was reading and I actually before this podcast I got on uh NIV online and and I actually went to the same portion and to my surprise uh it is the same today online as what it was before before so uh let me read it directly from uh the NIV online here uh in Matthew 1810 it says here it says see that you do not despise one of these little ones for I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in Heaven that's verse 10 then directly the next verse uh is verse 12 and it says what do you think uh if a man owns a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away will he not leave the 99 on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off and uh as I read that as a young believer I seen why in the world does it go straight from verse 10 to 12 where's verse 11 and uh I honestly the first thought that come to my mind was there must be a misprint in this Bible I bought a bad Bible somehow the factory messed it up so so I got another Bible and I I took a look at it and I'm like well what is supposed to be there and and I grabbed a King James Bible and uh so I read the 11th verse uh and it said for the son of man is come to save that which was lost and so I went back to the NIV and you know what in 10 or 12 that part is not even in either one so it's not that they threw it in a different verse and just got rid of 11 uh they actually got rid of the phrase for the son of man is come to save that which was lost uh I don't know about you brother Jesse but that's uh uh well I think I know about you as far as this but that is a very important verse and one we shouldn't cut out uh so immediately I I began to study it out the internet was you know fairly new at that point in time as far as uh for me but uh I got online and I and I found out that they didn't put that in there because they said it was not part of the earliest and most reliable manuscripts so that was one of my wakeup points very early on as a Christian uh to show me that there's something going on here a little bit deeper in me so it's not that it was a misprint uh it was actually something that was done intentionally so there was uh you know and and I love it the scripture says that you know the the Lord will guide you to all truth and right off the beginning of my experience in Christ I found out that you know there it is there is a discrepancy between this Bible and other Bibles amen that's an excellent point about God's hand of Mercy God's sovereignty over your life of course all of our lives but you see it in your life God wanted to guide you into all truth and showed you right away how this Bible version was intentionally and I like that word CU it's the evil spirit right it's the Antichrist Spirit behind this Bible version that's intentionally trying to take away words of God uh and we know there's all kinds of warnings against taking away the word of God Proverbs 35-6 uh Revelation 22:18-19 Galatians 1 6-12 there's so many warnings that we must preserve the word of God and we must receive every word of God so excellent story I love that story I never had heard that before till you preached it on a recent sermon and I was so so uh surprised but then so thankful God guided you into all Tre truth Amen brother um and if I could if I could just bring a point up just very quickly here because the twisting and resting of scripture that Paul talked about it is actually written about in the Old Testament uh so even showing that even in the Hebrew text they were already dealing with uh scribes and so forth that were doing things with the word of God that they shouldn't have done and for that you you go Jeremiah 8 it's be 5-9 but I'll just read 89 says how do ye say we are wise and the law of the Lord is with us Lo certainly in vain made he it the pen of the scribes is in vain the wise men are asham they are dismayed and taken uh Lo they have rejected the word of the Lord and what wiom is in them so so if you look at that portion of scripture said the pen of the scribes was in vain so they were actually altering writing things that should not have been now uh very interestingly you can you can see that at this point in time with Jeremiah they're getting ready to go to Babylon you know from there they they actually wrote the the uh Babylonian talet so and and of course there are other writings that came forth there you know some Reed that uh uh part of the book of uh Enoch actually came forth at that point in time so but there was already little sex rising up and and writing things to fit their own perspective about what they thought about God or what they felt that supposedly God was revealing to them wow it's amazing verse brother i' never seen that before that was Jeremiah 8 ver8 right yes praise God so now you can see again how this is a problem the Believers have had down Through the Ages right it stting the Garden of Eden with the serpent and now I never saw that but I never saw that it was in Jeremiah as well yeah so what we're what's impressed upon us is literally Satan from the very get-go has trying to make the church disbelieve their weapon uh brother brandham worked with that you know I believe it was the was it in the greatest battle ever fought uh but he he basically brought out that Satan's great weapon is to get you to disbelieve your weapon which is the word of God see his attack watch listen close this closing his attack is what disbelieve God's word that's his attack now can you see the greatest battle he ever fought there's only two forces Satan and God and what's Satan's weapon against you is to try to get you to dis believe your weapon he disarms you let's let's listen real quiet now listen if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he's disarmed you oh brother Neville I hope we never look he's disarmed you when he gets you to disbel that weapon when you lay that down it finishes your fight you're done hold that weapon don't you lay it down we sees unb so uh if you have a perfect word you can have perfect Faith so you know that's our aim and intention because we also know that that is required for rapturing faith rapturing faith requires perfect word uh so the next thing that comes to our mind as far as uh there I was I was coming out of uh ably of God and and honestly um I just kept reading the NIV Bible I asked others about it and they said well they're basically the same but but you know it's it's very easy for uh sheep especially young sheep just to follow the older sheep uh because you know there's a confidence in you when you see a Christian life and you think that what they're doing is right so almost right off the beginning of my testimony uh I found out that I was beginning to follow the majority I was following those who I felt I could trust uh especially regarding uh Bible versions so until literally until I came to the spot where God revealed this message to me uh in 2002 um I was following the NIV Bible but you know I was taking a a basic uh nominal Christian approach and and it actually took the crying out for truth um and then when God brought the message to me um that was the opening the door where all of a sudden this really became a critical thing I I come to the message and I found there that the King James Bible um it was the Bible everyone was using um actually at that point in time I never heard of any other message believer using any other Bible but then uh perhaps right around 2008 2010 uh I began to hear that preachers in the message or individuals in the message were actually using other Bibles and uh that to me was a little bit alarming and and it kind of reversed in my mind wait a minute when I first come into this I was actually brought right to that spot that they were taking things out of the Bible and now I'm seeing that people in the message are beginning to do the same thing so uh it was something that it really altered my my thinking about what was right and what was wrong and what was going on um so basically what's happened over the last 10 12 14 years is as I began to devote myself to start understanding uh the actual argument and uh you'll actually find within that argument that there are actually two families of manuscripts that are followed and that is where and why we have all these different versions so the King James the authorized King James because many have actually tried to modernize it and they they try to do it with the modern text but uh actually you'll find that it was in 1881 that Westcott and Hort were actually involved with wanting to get away from what they would term the villainous King James version and what their desire was was to come up with an entirely different Bible that would be written from a different Source um so from there they actually had what they would call the alexandrian family uh which is different from the ACT bisan tee family which the King James version was written from uh so just very quickly for this idea so literally the King James Bible is the only Bible that is exclusively written from the bantine manuscripts which is actually 90% of the textual evidence the alexandrian family and this will be a surprise for those who are uneducated on on the topic which is okay because most people don't even look into this uh and that's okay I didn't either until it was forced upon me by the Holy Spirit but uh anyway all the new versions every single one of them including the new King James um they are either altered or written exclusively from the Codex vaticanus or uh the Bible that the Vatican had uh and of course that's they say 93% written that way or 90% the the new versions are written from the exclusively from the Codex of adanus so and and what they make up the rest of is they say 7% of it is actually from codex cicus and then the other 3% is from the alexandrian Scrolls so that is very important now uh So what had happened then is so all these new versions are actually written from the Codex vaticanus which is the Vatican so uh we can go into this later but uh uh for you and I that are Protestants uh that should have an alarm just a a bell that's ringing uh incessantly in uh increasingly in our minds that wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute these uh this Catholic Church church and you know we we respect and love people in there but this system is actually killed according to their own martyrology uh 68 million Protestants so so that that brings an alarm up okay what's going on here and why are the new Bibles written from uh a church that once did nothing but tried to burn Bibles so uh that brings it to our mind uh that this is actually an important subject so anyway uh continuing with this thought of the message I began to hear that preachers were using different Bibles and uh recently I I I was alarmed I I was looking at a track from a a different uh message church and it just actually stopped me writing my tracks as I was reading I was just shocked in their track that they witnessed to others uh they had a one- sentence statement at towards the end of the track and it said the King James Bible is the most accurate Bible translation when I read that I was shocked blown away because they were actually saying that the King James Bible was the most accurate they didn't say it was the only accurate they didn't say it was the infallable Bible translation uh but they actually stated that it was the most accurate that is alarming because if you don't have a perfect Bible you can't trust it so uh brother Jesse you and I uh I I believe we were in complete Unity over this thought but uh the King James Bible is actually the only infallable translation so you know with that you know what I found out was that people in the message or or brothers and sisters in this message uh were now beginning to disbelieve the Bible that God gave us and uh that must needs that someone would take a stand so we appreciate what you're doing brother um and it is our desire too we recently we' preached four sermons U working with this and you could just Trail on forever the the information on the King James Bible on the Bible version debate is very interesting it's it's phenomenal uh you can actually get addicted to it as we see some people will so um that that's a good start brother for where we're going there excellent information brother yeah like you said there is so much information available on this um that's a great introduction to this topic my brother one point I think you brought out that truly helped me it's it's as if I'd heard it before but it wasn't until after I heard you teach and preach on it till it really became s in my mind was this major point that all Bibles come from either one of two sources and so the King James version is the only Bible that comes out of the bantine source of Scrolls is that correct brother yeah that that is absolutely correct and you know if we would look into the purpose of why we were actually doing this that would be the whole of it because there must be some type of mentality that someone had a long time ago to undermine people's confidence in the word of God the fact is as I was told that all the bibles are prettyy much the same they are actually uh very much different so literally here's a quotation so we would look at what was called the bantine family uh that the King James was written from and then you would have the Westcott Hort text and here's a quotation it said I said the New Testament was published in England on May 17th 1881 and 3 days later in the United States after 11 years of Labor this is working with the westcot wh text that they had come up with it says over 30,000 changes were made of which more than 5,000 represent differences in the Greek text from that used as the basis of the King James version so right there if you make thir 30,000 changes in the Bible how can you not come up with different Doctrine how can you not come up with obvious errors or mistakes uh you know as I told you as as I was coming into Christianity taking that portion of scripture out Matthew 1811 is very huge in the point of what Jesus Christ was trying to accomplish so that right there is one of those 5,000 ch changes in the Greek text so you know not only do you have different individuals interpreting the Greek but you also have a different Greek text in itself which is very frightening because uh the Bible tells us in Psalms let me get to this scripture here the Bible tells us in Psalms I believe it's 12 verse 6 it says the words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in in a furnace of fire purified seven times so you and I when we look at a Bible wow this word is it's like silver that was tried in a furnace it's purified it's got to be right 100% verse 127 it says Thou shalt keep them oh Lord Thou shalt preserve them from this generation forever so the psalmist tells us right there that God from even the point of him writing PSAL because a Psalm is a song that he was literally going to preserve every inspired word from that generation forever so uh it's a beautiful thought brother that's an amazing verse brother and uh and then combining that verse with the history we've just shared is life-changing you know especially for someone who wants to read the only true Bible think of that our brother cam stated it 5,000 changes those are 5,000 little bits of truth that Satan took away from people uh that's not just one like it was one word in the Garden of Eden right Thou shalt not surely die well now here in 1881 through Westcon Hort Satan has taken over 5,000 little bits of Truth away from the word of God so going back to that point brother cam brought it was so fresh to me so true you know this topic is easily settled by just taking each Bible version and say which source did it come from right so it's so easy that this is the simplest way I think to kind of uh filter it down any other Bible version outside of those using the source Scrolls of the King James version which would have been the bisontine Scrolls will be a false version because they have false Scrolls and then they constantly take away words from the Scrolls that are in the King James version and Scrolls yes sir so let let me add something brother Jesse so what you'll find is they would say well the King James language is archaic so you can't understand it so what would they come up with they would actually come up with a new King James version and what that was supposedly to do was to update the language of the King James version uh so that's part of the issue here because what they tell you is um they're modernizing the language so people can understand it they're they're modernizing it so okay now we can apply this it makes sense because uh the King James is archaic it's it's using words that we don't understand anymore and and so forth but when you actually start looking into the new King James version uh you will find that the changes that they made were actually based on the Westcott Hort t T they did not try to update the language they actually began to change and start hybriding the King James version with ideas from a Westcott hord text um so that's another thing that is very problematic because uh a lot of the preachers in the message you know were told that uh the Amplified Bible was just actually a modernization of the King James Bible uh it was meant to give clarification and understanding uh to the Greek that the Greek these Greek Scholars can help us is what they were told so it'll help us understand what what the real content of the Bible is uh so unfortunately uh these these message preachers and hopefully maybe they'll hear this maybe maybe they'll take a deeper look into it and uh see what the actual agenda is we have uh of course uh we'll have another video uh working with the actual changes because uh what's always said the proof is in the pudding so if I line up a King James Bible and an amplified Bible um if it's just a a language um upgrade or or or some sort of understanding that supposed to help us it should line up very closely with the King James version like almost exact but we'll find that that's not true at all and actually the interpreters of this Amplified Bible uh they began to start putting their own doctrines in there they they started putting their their own thoughts into there and you can't even teach message Doctrine fully through it the scriptures that they change will actually contradict other scriptures that prove that serpent seed's right uh that that prove that the godhead is right and and so on so we are actually sheep and the wall is getting pulled over our eyes even in this message that all these bibles are the same and there it is the Amplified Bible for example is written completely from the westcot Hort text it's not written from the King James at all um if you actually look into the history of it it was it was actually a presbyterian pastor's wife that took the Westcott hord took the Hebrew and she interpreted her own Bible for the people uh she didn't finish it but uh a committee took it on and they finished her work and therefore we have the Amplified Bible which has been updated uh at least twice the most recent time in 2015 so there's a lot there and you know as you can see there's so much information here but really what we would need to do at some point in time is is to actually look at the evidence especially from a message perspective which is what we're looking at and see if this affects what a godsent seventh angel William brandham gave us yeah excellent points there and I didn't know about the Amplified Bible uh coming from the westcot and Hort text so that would be an excellent point to use like let's say you're listening to this as a uh a viewer you know on YouTube or something or a podcast listener and you're concerned about it you know out of the love of God in your heart for the love of the truth right the love of the true word of God the King James version that might be a good point to take to a pastor something like that of course always go in love uh approach with just a a desire for truth and brother know did you know this and you just want to bring that point like even the Amplified Bible is taken from the wrong Source Scrolls yes so that would bring us to the idea that okay well what is the purpose of all of this this is my personal opinion there is some cover up behind it but we do see interaction but I would say that the very purpose of the writing of a new text written from the Greek which even the writers and even some on the committee were Catholics or Jesuits um it was actually a move of The Counter Reformation and the reason it was done was because if you could pull people to a confusion in the word then you could make their experience with Christ lack you could make it dumb down uh so that one they no longer had a full source of Truth and because they didn't have that full ability to have Truth uh you would be able to make them lukewarm which is the characteristic of the seventh Church age it's a lukewarm Church age now it is very obvious from 1881 that when the Protestants took this hookline and sinker and began to move away from the King James Bible that we are living in one of the most perverted uh lukewarm ages of all time right now and now we're seeing it creeping into the message uh at a very rapid pace and uh what is the purpose well according to our Bible Rome was that fourth beast in the Book of Daniel uh Rome of course everything shows that she was to be the last Beast for 2,000 years she's been ruling to some extent and it will end up with her leading a new world order so that's why a lot of these changes are made in the Bible because you actually have to change the content or or lessen uh the detail of the content in order for it not just to make Christianity more lack in its understanding but but it'll actually join it with other religion so that's why you'll find that uh the deity of Jesus Christ many are alarmed even trinitarians are very alarmed because um they'll take Jesus out and say he they'll take the godhead and they'll begin to to loosen it out so so now all of a sudden uh the deity is not so clear so if you just leave a couple scriptures you you'll alter the entire context or the understanding of the Bible which is why you hear a lot of people that are even from a standpoint uh looking at Christianity based with other religions including Islam Judaism and and they will be saying well we're pretty much all the same no we're not uh there's some tremendous differences but but the overall perspective they're trying to Proclaim is to join protestantism back with Catholicism and then join it into an all new world religion and uh they are closer to that than ever ever before yeah I'm just going to say this humbly this is a very fascinating approach uh brother cam God has brought you through and the approach of seeing how this is all working into the one world religion uh I recently made a video about that even at the Republican National Convention they had a an elected official from California open up the convention with a prayer to the Hindu god and in the background on the screens they had the cross of Jesus they had the Star of David and it was basically calling one of these Hindu gods the one true God but trying to unite it with you know Judaism Christianity U the Muslim faith and so forth so that's that's an excellent point you're making and the devil's in this for the long game right he started this in 1881 of course before that but that's when the Westcott Hort text came out and just decade after decade he slowly introduces these false translations into churches and it makes them lukewarm because they don't have a Zeal for the word of God and I love that point you brought out about 1881 uh that was right at the end of the man anointing right there's four anointings there's a lion ox man Eagle so right at the end of the Philadelphian Church age when the man age anointing is going to switch over to the eagle anointing you know Satan brings in this false group of Scrolls through Westcott and Hort and then here at the beginning of the leoan church age it's a lukewarm Age and what better way to make people lukewarm than to start changing the word of God and uh taking away words adding words adding like they Amplified it adds the Trinity into the Bible the word Trinity into the Bible that brother Bram always pointed out the word Trinity is not even in the Bible but now message people are reading a Amplified Bible with the word Trinity now in the Bible That's How Satan has slowly deceived people so it's very important to see that uh in the timing of it I love how you brought in the timing of it even it goes back to Daniel's Vision you know with I'm sorry with Daniel's interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar 's dream you know the iron and the clay the Catholic and Protestant in the feet of the image and this is their way to do it it's one way to do it to get them into one world religion say all all the bibles are basically the same all religions are basically the same and it's the way to make people lukewarm they're not on fire for the true word of God they've got their own false Bible translations that no longer take a stand on certain important major doctrines and remember even taking one word away from his word would be a sin but now they've changed over 5,000 things about the Greek text and of course many many more Bible verses yeah let me add a little bit more support to this so it was always catholicism's desire to take the word of God out of the people's hands that's why in 400 a right right around 400 ad they actually uh paid Jerome to actually write a Latin Vulgate and uh they put it in Latin which was a dead language that no one uh could understand and that was just for the Catholic hierarchy the intelligent people that they could read it alone and no one else could understand it so the common people they removed the word of God from the common people and think about it that was not even changed until you get to the 1400s and the 1500s when uh early Protestants began interpreting it and it was actually the Catholic priests that actually uh you know think about Martin Luther coming out of Catholicism nailing 95 thesises and coming against that uh so we have that perspective but here's another idea the actual history of Catholicism you know we know this from brother brandham and as far as teaching us that in Revelations 13 where it talked about how one of the heads of that Beast out of the uh sea which was Catholicism would killed to death uh so you have a pagan Rome and then in 325 when Constantine rolled on they had a pole Rome so historically you'll find this in history because there are not many manuscripts at all from the early centuries and I mentioned this a little bit ago and I'll mention it again because this is a great point but uh you will find that Pagan Rome did nothing but try to destroy and St St Christianity historically we find even with Diocesan Diocesan according to the church ages he had 10 years where he absolutely tried to kill every Christian he could possibly kill not only that but historically um he burnt every Bible he could find whether right or wrong as far as maybe it could have been a twisted one uh he burned it uh destroyed it destroyed all the evidence well you would think that would change after Constantine because okay now they're Christian well you'll find what they did of course they put it in Latin but then they also burnt every scroll we can find historically um I actually preached a sermon on it it goes all the way up to uh their own councils where they say that their people are forbidden to have a Bible they're forbidden to read the Bible and if they get caught reading one they will have to recant if they don't want to recant they'll die with their Bible they'll get burnt so quotations are still in their Vatican councils that they had Council of of of Trent and so forth um but Americans and Christians don't even realize how soon that these things happened uh if I remember correctly we'll try to get this resource brother but it was right around the mid middle 1800s uh that the Catholics were still uh having Bible burnings in America I believe it was in Massachusetts is where they had it uh I think if I remember WR is 1847 but they were still burning Bibles publicly not not secretly publicly showing their distaste for the word of God well no wonder Catholicism has so many Creeds and dogmas that don't line up with the Bible they're completely against the Bible but claiming that they are the true representative of Christianity so more clearly than ever before uh this is a a tremendously important topic and it is to keep a Protestant a Protestant so we can't go into the image of the Beast we can't go into this system of the joining with Catholicism and that is why all of a sudden they went from burning the Bible to saying okay we have a new text for everyone to have so it it is very beautiful what the spirit of God has revealed to his children in this age Amen brother amen that's powerful I didn't even know they were burning Bibles brother in the 1800s that's unbelievable yeah and frankly why don't they have to burn them anymore because they change the text they get the same results by changing the versions on most Bible committees uh this is what I've what I've I've listened to other speakers say um there is generally a Jesuit on each Council some of these Bible societies have been bought by Catholicism by the Catholic Church they've actually bought it so they are controlling the spreading of the new versions so uh very alarming excellent point there brother if Satan realized he couldn't get Bibles out of people's hands you know Satan realized after all these years well they'll always want a Bible he knew the next best thing is to change their Bible or pervert their Bible yes yeah now Manley Hall Paul uh I'd love to read this quotation he he wrote about the New World Order and uh and this is 1944 he's a 33rd degree Mason but uh he writes this quotation this this is phenomenal he said to make things right we will have to undo much of the cherished error the problem of revising the Bible shows how difficult it is to do this for the last hundred years from 1944 uh we've been trying to get out an addition of the Bible that is reasonably correct but nobody wants it what's wanted is the good old King James version every jot and TI of it because most people are convinced that God dictated the Bible to King James in English so Manley Hall admits of his knowledge that from 1844 they were deliberately trying to destroy the influence of the King James Bible so sometimes they hide the evidence right out in the open but since most people are you know they might might not be wanting to read they might be illiterate you know they can just say these things openly and and no one checks them no no one's looking and uh here it is they've been telling us their whole plan the whole time and there's many like statements brother that they they say this so part of the move from lyola um you know they were they were saying that they had to destroy the serpent called the Bible so there's a quotation from uh the Jesuits in history from 1997 and it states it says uh and this is from I believe this is from Yola Lo Yola excuse me uh and it says then the Bible that serpent which with head erect and eyes flashing threatens us with its venom while it trails along the ground shall be changed into a rod as soon as we are able to seize it for three centuries past this cruel ASP has left us no Repose you well know with what folds it entwines us and with what fangs it gnaws us so even Catholicism some of their head guys admittingly were telling of the damage that the Bible did to its control over the world so you can see that a Counter Reformation they said they wanted to seize it they said they wanted to change it from from a snake to A rod which we understand that the Bible is no snake the Bible is the in infallible word of God but to a mindset is that that shows right now that they are absolutely Antichrist as their regards to the written infallable word of God yeah brother cim that's a powerful point the Catholic Church recognized the power of the King James version and one of my points that I use to say why I'm a King James version only preacher is that Mighty Men of God use the King James version such as Charles Spurgeon Jonathan Edwards George Whitfield and of course William brandom a prophet of God and other men that were yielded to the Holy Spirit and able to bring forth the pure word of God from the King James version and no wonder these Catholic leaders were so afraid of the King James version because it would produce a genuine Christian experience it produced the baptism of the Holy Ghost right so historically every modern Revival came from the King James version uh Jonathan Edwards had a powerful Revival John Wesley Church age messenger had a incredibly powerful Revival George Whitfield uh powerful Revival um move on you have William Seymour you have Eric Roberts of the Welsh Revival you have early on Oral Roberts um from what I've seen uh Billy Graham uh and and brother brandom all these individuals uh you know the people they clung to that King James version and uh we see that it literally has caused every single major Revival I would say this our Prophet told us that we'll have a bride's Revival how are we going to get a Revival if we move away from the King James Bible when it and it alone is the only and follow source to produce the manifestation of the power of God on the children of God Amen and brother that brings to mind the quotes from Brother brandham you know how are we going to have a Revival if you change even one word just like the serpent changed one word and I'll take it even further even if you change one or two doctrines how can you have the true bride Revival and so that's an amazing point you brought out about all these men even William Seymour brother Bram said the zza Street Revival was the greatest Revival since the day of Pentecost brother R said that that's just the same kind of a thing that happened to our Pentecostal followers over 40 years ago God called out a man in California one crossed eye give him the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost from there form to zeusa Street the old isusa Street Mission from there scattered to have swept the whole nation from Nation went to Nation after Nation until Pentecostal Revival was burning everywhere hallelujah what a [Music] blessing God had provided by Grace I don't care when it was there's never been a Revival like the Pentecostal Revival Right Wesley never had it none of them had it spurge and Calvin Knox great reformers but they never had the Revival like the Pentecostal Revival the greatest thing that struck the Earth since the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost so that's an amazing point that you made there by the grace of God that we got to have the pure word of God the pure word of God will produce the Revival yeah uh God's word cannot fail it absolutely cannot will not never will let us down you know the Bible said he'll never leave us nor forsake us uh and and that is factual and this message which was what it was the Gathering of all the revelations that were true brother Bram didn't come up everything new but he he he picked up all the Loose Ends um you know you know John Wesley had some things William Seymour had some things he put all these things together um and brought forth exactly from the King King James Bible the truth that we were to receive in this hour such a beautiful point there yeah brother Brandon was called to finish the mystery of God Revelation 10:7 restore all things uh Matthew 17:11 turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers Revelation Malachi 45 and6 and so this was part of it yeah brother Braham brought some new things as we've said but not a whole lot uh we know the revelation of the Seven Seals was new uh there's other new things he brought out but a lot of it was restoration restoring what had already been given by God the beginning of the church ages through St Paul and St John and St Peter St James all the writers of the New Testament and brother Ram's uh main Ministry was to restore all things restore our hearts back to the apostolic fathers and of course for that to happen we need the pure word of God the King James version to do that yeah so so literally what what you see is um you know God would raise a prophet up to bring the word but you know who is the great compiler of that Jesus Christ when Jesus Christ came out he brought the Revelation that put it all together he showed the fulfilling he showed uh what the doctrine was that's why you can see Jesus talks about serpent seat uh Jesus talks about all these things and and then you watch that as time so God's move is always he allows Satan to of course get in there with organizational Spirits uh it's it's what it's always been unfortunately it's happened in the message even nowadays but organizational spirits come in and they dull the people from the truth and makes them go to other heirs well what God was doing you know therefore you know just like Jesus they were twisting the word in laws and and uh uh Traditions that weren't even in in the Bible God's inspired word never said it uh but yet Jesus Christ could come out and then the apostles following and and and Paul concluding as a first church age messenger and bring out the totality of what is truth then of course over seven Church ages it would be lost again but then brought in our day right now you know brother brandham he would actually compile once again what was right amongst all the erors that were sewed in by the devil through organizational principles and and the human mind so he would bring us to that and we would have to say okay what is it uh you know that's why that's why when you look at the message there's so many different doctrines now well what's right so most people will run from a quote but they never take it into the word of God if you take it back to the word of God you will find that it is a simple moving source that shows what the prophet told us that was right brother Brandon was like a man he was just like me and you we don't need to canonize the the 1200 sermons of the message he was a man just like we can't canonize our own sermons uh no one can canonize their own words because there's only one that spoke in Perfection his name was the Lord Jesus Christ he's our savior Our God and uh there will be no other Foundation but that's what the prophet did uh is he established with the King James Bible what was right yeah you made some excellent points there brother one point I want to emphasize is that brother brandom said every generation has a chance of the word of God and we and we saw that in the Book of Judges right where another generation rose up that didn't know the Lord and so in each generation they have to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and uh you brought out a great point you know God will allow Satan to inject these false Bibles into society because God has to give people what they want right uh Romans 1:28 God gave them over to a reprobate mind uh because they did not want to retain God in in their minds so people that don't want to retain the pure Doctrine or the true word of God the pure refined words of God God sees that in their hearts just like balum and so because balum didn't want to do the perfect will of God God gives him the permissive will of God so we're seeing that's why God has allowed all this time to go forth because he's got to give them what they want and every seed will bring forth of its own kind thank God we have the seed of God in our souls the Bible said we're born again of The Incorruptible word uh The Incorruptible seed the word of God so that's what we want since we're born again of God's seed that's what we want just God's word and that word is only found in the King James version Bible amen very well said brother and a genuine Faith Of God will believe in God and God is the word it'll never add nothing to it the Bible tells us if we add one word or take one word away our part will be taken from The Book of Life Revelations 22:18 the last closing chapter I stand before him I want to be found innocent I've ever trying to add one thing to that word or take one just exactly the way it is teaching people toore right up to it the Bible says this I can't help what anyone else says I got to stay right with that and here was those people standing around like that when I said will Paul have to be judged for the gospel he preached said yes I said I preached every word just exactly the way he did and the millions screamed out we are resting on that that's where I want it to be on the cross there I want to be that way just like that just what Paul said I don't want to add one thing to it take one thing away from it just what the Bible said that's just way I want to keep it going see and of course you keep it like that you've got to have somewhere that faith can take its resting place and to me I don't know how you feel about it but to me the Bible is the infallible word of God and I believe that God has watched over his word that there's not one punctuation out of place and so we want to thank our listeners thank you for your download thank you for uh sharing these podcasts and videos so we look forward to our next podcast friends God bless you and may Jesus Christ anoint you to defend the message good afternoon friends very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the Gospel
