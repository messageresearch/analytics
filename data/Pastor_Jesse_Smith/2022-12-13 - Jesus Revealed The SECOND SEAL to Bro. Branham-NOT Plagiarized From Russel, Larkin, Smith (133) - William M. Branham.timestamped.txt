[0:08] that's that's
[0:10] the law
[0:17] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:22] the purpose of this video is to prove
[0:25] hopefully by God's grace once and for
[0:28] all that the Lord Jesus Christ revealed
[0:31] the revelation of the second seal to his
[0:34] servant his Prophet brother William
[0:36] Branham as you probably know earlier
[0:40] this year in April one of brother Ram's
[0:42] accusers made a video series accusing
[0:45] him of plagiarizing Charles Tays Russell
[0:48] and Clarence Larkin on the Seven Seals
[0:51] but that of course is a false accusation
[0:54] brother Rams accusers say he plagiarized
[0:57] Charles Tays Russell on the second seal
[1:00] and will prove that was false
[1:02] but first let's review the first seal I
[1:05] want to briefly show six differences the
[1:08] accusers of brother Branham left out
[1:11] regarding the first seal and these six
[1:14] differences proved brother Ram did not
[1:15] plagiarize Charles Tays Russell and
[1:18] Clarence Larkin
[1:19] and of course you can watch the full
[1:21] length video about the first seal and
[1:24] Lord willing I'll leave a link to it in
[1:26] the description
[1:27] the first difference was the timing
[1:29] brother Brandon's first seal started
[1:31] over 200 years earlier than Russell's
[1:34] first seal and brother random's first
[1:36] seal ended 150 years before Russell's
[1:40] first seal ended
[1:42] and regarding brother Branham and
[1:44] Clarence Larkin there is no comparison
[1:46] in the timing of their first seals
[1:48] there's nearly a 2 000 year difference
[1:50] between Brother branham's start time for
[1:52] the first seal and Clarence Larkin's
[1:54] start time
[1:55] Larkin's first seal hasn't even happened
[1:57] yet because he said it starts during the
[2:00] 70th week of Daniel during the Great
[2:01] Tribulation period which hasn't happened
[2:03] yet and brother Randall's first seal
[2:05] started in the first century
[2:08] second regarding the White Horse Russell
[2:10] said it was the doctrines and teachings
[2:12] of the Lord and the apostles brother Ram
[2:14] said exactly the opposite he said it was
[2:16] the Antichrist Spirit or the nicolaitan
[2:18] spirit or the deceiving spirit
[2:21] regarding the color white Russell said
[2:24] it was the doctrines and teachings of
[2:25] the Lord and the apostles again brother
[2:27] random said it was the impersonator of
[2:29] Christ
[2:30] the fourth difference was with the rider
[2:32] Russell said the writer was the bishop
[2:34] of Rome but brother random said the
[2:36] writer started out as the Antichrist
[2:38] Spirit upon the entire age of false
[2:40] teachers
[2:41] citing first John 2 Verse 18 and how
[2:45] there was already many antichrists in
[2:47] the world at the time Saint John wrote
[2:48] that letter
[2:49] then brother Graham said the writer
[2:51] would eventually become the pope and
[2:54] then lastly the Antichrist Pope during
[2:56] the Great Tribulation period but we know
[2:58] that doesn't happen until the end of the
[2:59] fourth seal
[3:01] the fifth difference was the emphasis
[3:04] Russell emphasized the reign of
[3:06] Constantine in the first seal where the
[3:08] Branham emphasized the deceiving
[3:10] Antichrist Spirit upon the false church
[3:13] and I was combated by the mighty
[3:15] Miracles and deeds of the early apostles
[3:18] and the sixth major difference between
[3:20] Russell Larkin and brother Branham was
[3:23] that Russell said the Beast of the first
[3:25] seal which the Bible said was a lion
[3:27] Russell called it infinite Justice and
[3:30] that apparently God forsook his church
[3:33] when infinite Justice or the lion Beast
[3:35] was defeated by the ecclesiastical
[3:37] system of the Roman Catholic Church
[3:39] it's very different from Brother Branham
[3:41] brother random said the lion represented
[3:43] the anointing of the holy spirit that
[3:45] saved the world
[3:46] said the early church had healings and
[3:49] miracles and visions and Power
[3:51] because it was the Living Word in the
[3:53] form of the line of the tribe of Judah
[3:55] writing out to combat that
[3:57] so I hope that summary of the six major
[3:59] differences about the first seal proves
[4:02] positively that brother Branham did not
[4:04] plagiarize the first seal from Clarence
[4:06] Larkin and Charles Tays Russell
[4:09] the second seal
[4:11] we'll begin with the accusation that
[4:14] brother Ram's accusers stated about the
[4:16] second seal they said quote William
[4:18] Branham appears to be teaching the
[4:20] doctrine of Charles Hayes Russell the
[4:23] Watchtower Society the Jehovah's
[4:25] Witnesses as having come straight from
[4:28] God to him end quote
[4:31] of course this is a false accusation
[4:33] first note that brother Ram's accusers
[4:36] said nothing about Clarence Larkin in
[4:38] the second seal why not it appears they
[4:42] didn't mention Larkin because it shows
[4:44] they're aware brother Branham taught
[4:45] nothing similar to Larkin which proves
[4:47] to me they are straining at a net and
[4:50] swallowing a camel because they have no
[4:52] real evidence for plagiarism
[4:54] the lack of a mention of Larkin on the
[4:57] second seal proves they read through
[4:59] Russell Larkin's work and shows they are
[5:01] either very dishonest researchers on
[5:04] purpose
[5:05] or they're very forgetful honest
[5:07] researchers who made awful mistakes but
[5:09] God is the only one who knows and I
[5:12] can't judge their hearts I can only show
[5:13] how it seems they purposely are
[5:15] slandering God's Prophet brother Brandon
[5:17] with dishonest research or at least
[5:20] extremely shoddy and weak so-called
[5:22] research
[5:24] back to the accusation I'll begin by
[5:26] focusing on Charles Tay's Russell
[5:28] because again that's the only name
[5:30] brother Ram's accusers use in their sad
[5:33] attempt to slander brother Brandon and
[5:35] call him a plagiarist
[5:37] I want to begin by showing screenshots
[5:40] from the accusers video and brother
[5:42] Ram's accusers quoted three phrases from
[5:45] Charles Hayes Russell's book The
[5:46] finished mystery
[5:48] and Friends it was three phrases not
[5:51] even three complete sentences and then
[5:53] they falsely claimed brother Branham
[5:55] plagiarized Russell
[5:58] it's shocking for me to see how little
[6:00] information the accusers used of
[6:03] Russell's second seal as he wrote about
[6:05] it on pages 106 through 112 in his book
[6:10] that's nearly seven pages of information
[6:13] about the second seal
[6:15] and brother Ram's accusers used three
[6:18] short phrases
[6:19] it seems brother Ram's accusers were
[6:21] likely withholding much information
[6:24] about Russell's second seal in order to
[6:27] purposely slander God's true Prophet
[6:29] brother Branham
[6:31] so here's the visual of a screenshot of
[6:33] all seven pages
[6:35] that Russell wrote about the second seal
[6:39] so out of these seven pages I'll zoom in
[6:41] and show now
[6:43] the yellow highlighted area are the
[6:46] three phrases whether Ram's accusers
[6:48] quoted
[6:49] it's such a small amount of information
[6:52] compared again to the whole seven pages
[6:55] worth of information about the second
[6:57] seal
[7:03] so the real accusation should be against
[7:06] brother Ram's accusers
[7:07] it appears they chose an extremely
[7:09] limited amount of Russell's teachings to
[7:13] purposely slander God's true Prophet
[7:15] brother Branham so let's look at the
[7:17] three phrases other Rams accusers used
[7:19] on their second seal video the first one
[7:23] is from page 106 Russell wrote quote and
[7:26] when he'd open the second seal end quote
[7:28] the second quote is from page 106 quote
[7:31] the same writer the Antichrist end quote
[7:35] and the third quote is from page 107
[7:38] quote the pope each Pope and his turn is
[7:41] the head of the false church end quote
[7:43] so did Brother random agree with these
[7:45] two statements
[7:47] and note that the first statement isn't
[7:49] an opinion of Russell he's just quoting
[7:51] scripture
[7:52] so the second quote said quote the same
[7:54] writer the Antichrist end quote did
[7:57] Brother random agree with that yes
[7:59] brother Branham agreed and said quote
[8:00] now here's my revelation of it this is
[8:02] Satan again it's the devil again in
[8:04] another form end quote
[8:07] the third and final quote brother man's
[8:09] accusers use the Russell was on page 107
[8:12] quote the pope each Pope in his turn is
[8:15] the head of the false church end quote
[8:17] regarding the pope yes brother random
[8:19] agreed but said much more
[8:21] remember Russell wrote nearly seven
[8:23] pages about the second seal alone
[8:27] well the ram said in the second seal
[8:29] quote notice Satan's Trinity same person
[8:31] coming just incarnate from one to the
[8:33] other that's the way them bugs did them
[8:35] worms one to the other exactly
[8:37] nicolaitan spiritual Antichrist Pope
[8:40] false prophet Beast the Devil Himself
[8:43] incarnate end quote
[8:44] even though brother Branham agree with
[8:46] these two statements there was so much
[8:48] more both Russell and brother Brandon
[8:50] said about the second seal that brother
[8:52] Ram's accusers have neglected to share
[8:55] with you
[8:56] and remember their video was two minutes
[8:58] and 33 seconds long that is not enough
[9:01] time to cover the second seal
[9:03] roller random sermon on the second seal
[9:05] was two hours 18 minutes and 24 seconds
[9:09] and of course Charles Taze Russell wrote
[9:10] nearly seven pages about the second seal
[9:14] so a 2 minute and 33 second video is a
[9:17] weak attempt at accusing brother Branham
[9:20] of plagiarism
[9:21] but again that speaks to the character
[9:23] of brother Ram's accusers
[9:25] and also exposes their motives and
[9:27] objectives because they've ignored so
[9:29] much information and research and that
[9:31] shows whether they're trustworthy or not
[9:34] now here are six differences between
[9:37] Charles Tays Russell and brother Branham
[9:39] on the second seal this is information
[9:41] brother Brands accusers either didn't
[9:43] read or purposely ignored and of course
[9:46] that's to their own shame
[9:48] first the timing of the second seal
[9:52] as you can see on your screen brother
[9:54] random second seal was about from 385 to
[9:57] 1095 because he said the second seal was
[10:00] the red horse rider that was when the
[10:02] Roman Catholic Church jumped off the
[10:04] White Horse and jumped onto the red
[10:06] bloody horse
[10:08] it was when the Roman Catholic Church
[10:10] had power to kill dissenters with the
[10:13] literal sword and of course the second
[10:16] seal lasted until the third seal started
[10:18] which was around the time of the Dark
[10:20] Ages hence the year 1095 A.D
[10:24] which is about the time the Dark Ages
[10:26] started
[10:28] notice Charles Hayes Russell said the
[10:30] timing was from 3 25 to 5 39 A.D
[10:35] and here's a screenshot of that from
[10:37] page 107 quote this appeared beginning
[10:40] with the year 325 A.D and extending to
[10:43] the year 539 was a period of formation
[10:45] of Creeds end quote
[10:49] so regarding the timing of the second
[10:50] seal brother Branham did not plagiarize
[10:52] Charles Tays Russell
[10:57] second let's look at the horse
[11:00] brother random said it's the Pope the
[11:02] false prophet who has power to kill with
[11:04] the literal sword let's listen to the
[11:06] quotes
[11:16] one to the other exactly
[11:20] Indian spiritual Antichrist hope false
[11:24] prophet Beast Devil Himself incarnate
[11:30] now I remember he's got a sword he's
[11:33] going forth for a sword in his hand
[11:35] riding red horse waiting to the cloud of
[11:39] everybody that disagrees with him
[11:42] regarding the horse Russell said it was
[11:44] a Creed horse on page 106 Russell said
[11:48] quote a Creed horse quite different from
[11:51] the scriptures which it misrepresented
[11:53] end quote
[11:58] so it's clear brother Brown did not
[12:00] plagiarize Russell Russell said the
[12:02] horse was a Creed horse well the random
[12:04] said it was the power of Satan in the
[12:07] pope and the Roman Catholic Church to
[12:09] literally kill genuine Christians
[12:12] third let's look at the color red
[12:15] Russell said red was quote the color of
[12:18] sin imperfection though your sins be as
[12:20] Scarlet Isaiah 1 verse 18 end quote
[12:25] this was different from Brother Branham
[12:27] brother Branham said it was a bloody red
[12:28] in the second seal brother Brandon said
[12:30] quote from the innocent white to a
[12:32] bloody red riding red horse wading
[12:35] through the blood of everyone that
[12:36] disagrees with him end quote let's
[12:38] listen to the quote
[12:39] and the Beast in the Bible and her
[12:42] symbol represents of power
[12:45] same system right on another color Tower
[12:51] from the innocent white to a bloody red
[12:55] do you think
[12:57] how
[12:58] ever he's got a sword he's going forth a
[13:02] sword in his hand riding
[13:05] riding sweating to the blood of
[13:06] everybody that disagrees with him how do
[13:09] you understand it yeah how many
[13:10] understands what that seal is now all
[13:12] right
[13:14] so on the third detail brother random is
[13:17] again proven to have a unique Revelation
[13:19] not the same as Russell brother around
[13:21] did not plagiarize regarding the color
[13:23] red
[13:25] fourth let's look at the sword
[13:27] Russell said the sword was Satan's power
[13:29] to destroy as teachers and he said it
[13:32] was the power of the Pope to speak a
[13:34] Creed and then be shared through the
[13:36] Catholic teachers and that would destroy
[13:38] people's faith page 106 Russell said
[13:41] quote that they should kill one another
[13:43] dispose and Destroy one another as
[13:46] teachers by inveying the Roman power
[13:48] against all offenders and there was
[13:51] given unto him a great sword end quote
[13:56] and then picking up on page 107 quote so
[14:00] the papacy has a great and powerful
[14:02] sword in opposition to the sword of the
[14:04] spirit and it too comes out of papacy's
[14:08] mouth the pope each Pope in his turn is
[14:10] the head of the false church this period
[14:13] was the period of formation of Creeds
[14:15] end quote
[14:18] brother bran did not say the sword was
[14:21] the word of the Pope destroying through
[14:22] Catholic teachers brother Rams said the
[14:25] sword was a red sword and it represented
[14:28] the death of over 68 million Protestants
[14:31] let's listen to the quotes
[14:33] listen I'm quoting from the martyrology
[14:37] from the Timeless of Saint Augustine of
[14:41] Hippo until 15 and 86 on the Roman
[14:46] moderology the Roman Catholic Church put
[14:50] 68 million policies today
[14:56] was his sword read a red horse
[15:01] same time
[15:04] same writer amen there's a seal
[15:09] so now we can see brother Ram did not
[15:11] plagiarize on the fourth detail the
[15:13] sword
[15:17] the fifth detail was the emphasis
[15:20] going back to this screenshot of all
[15:22] seven of Russell's pages on these seven
[15:25] Pages Russell emphasized five Catholic
[15:28] creeds
[15:29] that was completely different from
[15:30] Brother Branham and brother Ram's second
[15:32] seal he emphasized the death of over 68
[15:35] million Christian Martyrs and of course
[15:37] he was citing Samuel s schmucker's book
[15:41] the Glorious Reformation
[15:44] so brother random is again acquitted of
[15:47] the plagiarism accusation regarding the
[15:49] emphasis of the second seal
[15:54] and six and finally the Beast
[15:58] Charles Hayes Russell said the Beast of
[16:01] the second seal was infinite power
[16:04] so in other words the ox represented
[16:06] infinite power while the ram did not
[16:08] teach that
[16:10] brother Brown said the ox Beast
[16:12] represented the anointing upon
[16:14] Christians to be sacrificial Martyrs for
[16:17] the faith again connecting this idea to
[16:19] the 68 million Christian Protestant
[16:22] martyrs
[16:23] let's listen to brother Adam's quote
[16:24] from the fifth seal where he says the ox
[16:26] is a beast of sacrifice and the Saints
[16:28] had this anointing on them and they
[16:30] freely gave their lives they didn't mind
[16:33] dying because it was the very Spirit of
[16:35] the age the anointing of the ox upon the
[16:38] real Christians let's listen to the
[16:40] quote
[16:55] gauges a thousand years there the
[16:57] Catholicism control the world
[17:06] that's all right
[17:08] it wasn't God anyhow
[17:11] very
[17:18] so the conclusion between Russell and
[17:20] brother Brandon is that brother Ram did
[17:22] not plagiarize Charles Tays Russell
[17:24] I just showed you six differences on the
[17:27] main details regarding both men's
[17:29] teachings about the second seal
[17:32] and friends I read all seven pages of
[17:35] Russell's work about the second seal and
[17:37] he never mentioned 68 million Martyrs
[17:40] like brother Rana mentioned
[17:42] so that was a revelation the Lord Jesus
[17:45] Christ gave to brother Branham with thus
[17:46] saith the Lord to prove that brother
[17:48] Brown's Revelation came from the Lord
[17:50] Jesus Christ and not the Jehovah's
[17:52] Witnesses
[17:53] and this is why brother Graham said thus
[17:55] saith the Lord at the end of the second
[17:57] seal that his Revelation was from the
[17:59] Lord and not Charles Tays Russell
[18:02] Clarence Larkin nor Uriah Smith
[18:11] Hallelujah
[18:32] the races and visions and everything
[18:33] else it doesn't
[18:36] on the part and how many doors that
[18:38] raise your hand everybody here with
[18:40] their hands up that's right so shall
[18:43] this be
[18:47] for moving on I just want to make a
[18:49] response to one of the comments on my
[18:51] first seal video one of the supporters
[18:53] of brother Ram's accusers admitted there
[18:56] were differences between Russell Larkin
[18:58] and Branham on the first seal but still
[19:00] said brother Brandon plagiarized and at
[19:03] the timing of the first seal didn't
[19:04] matter now friends that's total nonsense
[19:07] just as a simple example details like
[19:10] timing are crucial in order to convict
[19:12] one of plagiarism
[19:14] for example if the Britannica
[19:16] Encyclopedia said the American
[19:18] Revolutionary War was from 1775 to 1783
[19:22] would it be plagiarism if my start date
[19:26] for the American Revolution was 60 years
[19:28] later than the 1775 starting date or
[19:32] 1835
[19:33] and my end date was 556 years later then
[19:38] the britannica's end date which would be
[19:40] 2339 no it wouldn't be plagiarism
[19:44] and friends that's the difference
[19:45] between the start dates between Russell
[19:48] brother Bynum and Clarence Larkin a
[19:50] person cannot be accused of plagiarizing
[19:52] if there are huge differences between
[19:55] the details of the content
[19:59] next let's compare Clarence Larkin and
[20:01] brother Branham which brother Ram's
[20:03] accusers did not do on the second seal
[20:04] video
[20:06] regarding the timing and identity of the
[20:08] rider Clarence Larkin said quote this
[20:10] seems to imply that the Antichrist will
[20:12] not have everything his own way end
[20:14] quote
[20:15] so again Clarence Larkin is saying the
[20:18] writer is the person of the Antichrist
[20:20] and the timing is during the Great
[20:21] Tribulation period or Daniel's 70th week
[20:29] here's a visual showing how brother Ram
[20:31] did not plagiarize Clarence Larkin on
[20:33] the timing of the second seal notice
[20:35] brother random's timing was about three
[20:37] to five to ten ninety five and Clarence
[20:39] Larkin's timing is still in the future
[20:41] it hasn't happened yet
[20:44] it's absolutely ludicrous to say brother
[20:46] Branham plagiarize Larkin or even
[20:48] Charles Tays Russell on the second seal
[20:51] you can find Larkin's information about
[20:54] the second seal on page 55 of his book
[20:58] so it's a simple conclusion to show
[21:00] brother Ram's second seal started nearly
[21:02] 1600 years before Larkins and Larkin's
[21:05] second seal hasn't even occurred yet
[21:07] well the brand said the rider was the
[21:09] Antichrist spirit in a man then in a
[21:12] pope in the second seal
[21:13] Larkin said the writer is the literal
[21:15] person or literal man of the Antichrist
[21:18] during the Great Tribulation period who
[21:20] will make a covenant with the Jews so
[21:23] the conclusion is brother Brown did not
[21:24] plagiarize Clarence Larkin
[21:26] finally let's compare Uriah Smith and
[21:29] brother Branham regarding the second
[21:30] seal
[21:32] your eyes missed timing seems to be the
[21:35] second century until the climax of the
[21:37] reign of Constantine
[21:39] and I say seems to be because he did not
[21:41] specifically State when the first seal
[21:43] ended or when the second seal started
[21:46] but he did give us a start date for the
[21:48] third seal so that's how we know his
[21:50] second seal ended under the reign of
[21:53] Constantine
[21:54] now regarding the writer of the second
[21:56] seal urai Smith gave No Rider
[21:59] he mentioned Constantine and the union
[22:01] of church and state and of course this
[22:03] is from his book Daniel and the
[22:05] Revelation from 1897.
[22:08] here's screenshots of the two pages your
[22:11] I Smith wrote about the second seal
[22:15] and now I'll show you the information
[22:17] Uriah gave about the timing and the
[22:20] writer
[22:21] quote the spirit of this period perhaps
[22:23] reached its climax as we come down to
[22:25] the days of Constantine the first
[22:27] so-called Christian Emperor whose
[22:28] conversion to Christianity is dated by
[22:31] mosheem in ad323 end quote
[22:36] here's a picture of the timing of the
[22:39] second seal showing the difference
[22:40] between brother Branham and Uriah Smith
[22:47] quote of this period Dr Rice remarks it
[22:50] represents a secular period or Union of
[22:52] church and state Constantine aided the
[22:55] clergy and put them under obligations to
[22:57] him
[22:58] he legislated for the church called the
[23:00] Council of nicaea and was most prominent
[23:02] in that Council end quote
[23:07] so the conclusion between Uriah Smith
[23:09] and brother Branham
[23:11] is that brother Brown's second seal
[23:13] started about 185 years later than
[23:16] Smith's
[23:17] for the Rams was 385.
[23:20] your eye Smith was likely around 200 A.D
[23:22] because he said the first seal was for
[23:25] the first century
[23:27] brother Ram's second seal ended about
[23:28] 758 years later than Uriah Smith as
[23:32] Uriah Smith said the third seal started
[23:34] around 3 37 or 338 A.D
[23:38] also brother Ram said the writer was the
[23:40] Antichrist spirit in the pope and the
[23:42] Roman Catholic Church Uriah Smith
[23:45] didn't specifically State who the writer
[23:47] was but it was either Constantine or the
[23:51] union of church and state
[23:53] so the conclusion is brother Graham did
[23:55] not plagiarize Uriah Smith
[23:58] in closing
[24:01] friends I hope this second seal video
[24:02] has been a blessing to you because it
[24:04] again proves that the Lord Jesus Christ
[24:07] revealed the revelation of the second
[24:09] seal to brother Branham just like the
[24:11] Lord Jesus revealed the first seal
[24:12] Revelation to brother Branham
[24:15] and friends it's hard to put into words
[24:17] how disappointed I am with the research
[24:19] or so-called research of brother Ram's
[24:22] accusers
[24:23] it is so incredibly weak and it seems to
[24:26] be so incredibly dishonest it seems to
[24:29] be a purposeful Slanders attack against
[24:30] brother Branham I don't say that is but
[24:33] it really looks like that because of the
[24:35] amount of information that Russell
[24:37] taught about the second seal and how
[24:39] little Orleans accusers actually use on
[24:43] their video
[24:44] and all my statements here are spoken in
[24:45] brotherly kindness and love
[24:47] Jesus said to love your enemies and pray
[24:49] for your enemies
[24:51] and I feel like brother Ram's accusers
[24:52] have become our enemies
[24:54] by falsely accusing brother Branham of
[24:56] plagiarism and other accusations
[24:58] what they're really doing is speaking
[25:00] against the word of God that the Lord
[25:01] Jesus Christ revealed to brother Branham
[25:04] so with Christian love we should pray
[25:06] for them which is what we'll do right
[25:08] now
[25:09] father God again I just come to you in
[25:11] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[25:13] Lord I just pray your Holy Spirit would
[25:14] again deal with brother Adam's accusers
[25:17] father if they watch this video may they
[25:19] be convicted also with the first seal
[25:20] video and be able to recognize the truth
[25:24] and Lord look at all the research and
[25:27] the full content of brother Ram's
[25:28] sermons and compare these teachings with
[25:31] an honest sincere heart somehow Lord
[25:34] they've lost their honesty and sincerity
[25:36] or their ability to look at a subject
[25:38] objectively so I pray May the spirit of
[25:41] honesty come back upon them the spirit
[25:43] of understanding the spirit of knowledge
[25:44] so they could recognize their heirs Lord
[25:46] repent of them and repent of their
[25:49] Slanders and false accusations
[25:51] and Lord have a fresh start serving you
[25:53] dear God that's my humble prayer and
[25:56] Lord if there's anything wrong I said
[25:57] Lord please forgive me just show me I'll
[25:59] quickly repent by your grace Lord God
[26:02] so ask all these things humbly in the
[26:04] mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[26:05] amen
[26:09] friends if you have any questions
[26:10] concerns or testimonies about this video
[26:12] please contact me
[26:15] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[26:18] the desire of your heart
