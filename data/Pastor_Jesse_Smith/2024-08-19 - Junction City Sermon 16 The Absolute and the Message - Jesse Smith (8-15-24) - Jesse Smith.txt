TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so let's read Romans 3:4 uh let's begin on three 1 2 3 God forbid yay let God be true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged amen let's have one more word of prayer you have a need on your heart let's make an know to God as we bow our heads father God my hands up Lord I have need of of you Lord God I need you to come and speak through Me Lord God I'm nothing I can help no one I can do nothing John 15:5 Lord Jesus you said apart from me you can do nothing I can do nothing Lord so I want to be attached to the vine Lord I'm a branch so Lord let me abide in the vine here tonight that you could use me to help your blessed people Lord the people that sing about uh Holy Spirit riging down Hallelujah and uh bringing in the Sheep Lord and all these wonderful songs God that stir our hearts Hallelujah Lord God that create an atmosphere of worship Lord bless your people here tonight Lord God May each person get into the channel of the Holy Spirit forgive us of any sin Lord if there's any resentment or any bitterness Lord or any unconfessed sin I just pray your people would confess them now Lord God that you might be glorified and magnified God as I said You' recently shown me again how how personal you can be and how much you care about correcting your children Lord God you want us to walk in obedience you don't want us to walk in besetting sins right you want us to obey the word of God so bless us here tonight they've made all these sacrifices to come to your house so I pray you'll bless bless them with your word tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated there praise God so again I want to preach on these two thoughts you know they kind of go together uh the message uh I'm sorry the absolute and the message here tonight um do you want that or do you want it doesn't matter to me what's ever better for you all it was kind of dark up here I didn't get to see uh Howard's face real real nicely like I'd like to but now whatever whatever you whatever you all like by God's grace so uh we want to look at uh you know and what I'm going to try to do too I'm going to try to show some some quotes from Brother brandom some scriptures I'm also going to try to play portions of a video I did uh I made on the absolute because it's the truth brother brandom's absolute was Jesus Christ there's many things uh there's variations he said of that he said the absolute is the Bible the ab absolute is Jesus Christ the absolute is the holy spirit Hallelujah the absolute is the pillar of fire brother man made many different similar statements like that but they're all pointing to the one fact the only absolute is God the only absolute is Jesus no man other than Jesus is the absolute okay everybody got that by God's grace so it's very simple to you you know because you've been taught right but I just want to kind of I thought you know this might be the last time I preach you for a little while I don't know it's kind up to our brothers you know uh I said well if this is the last time let me lay this in here real good uh so it brother Brown said you got to pound it and clinch it in there like a nail right you don't you don't leave a nail sticking out halfway you got to put it all the way in there so I'm going to clinch the nail tonight by God's grace I kind of like to slap my RI my palm like that to give it some uh some illustration I want to just nail that in there because I see as a pastor and you know listening to different things and and different visiting ministers and so forth I see that people get deceived from the middle of the road brother R said we got to stay in the middle of the road amen so like when you're driving our sisters and brothers you got to stay in the middle of your lane you get out of your lane a little bit oh my you start scaring people right or you getting towards uh you know the ditch that scares you right and I see a lot of churches getting towards the middle of lane or towards the ditch we got to stay right in the middle of the road praise God it's going to be uh it's going to be a challenge right but but that that's we we got to have something to overcome Hallelujah we got to overcome by the grace of God hallelujah and so uh that's what we see uh as you know brother Brand's family has gone into the ditch because they say every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord they say the tapes are the absolute that's heresy amen because if the tapes are the absolute now you've added on to the Bible and brother R says you can't add one word to the Bible amen I know that's a strong statement but I know what brother random said right and I know what the Bible says amen that's exactly Hallelujah and I've written to brother Ram's Sons both sons of course Billy Paul passed last year I've written to both sons and told them that I wouldn't say it unless I told them first Hallelujah so I know what I'm talking about and I've heard back from both of them I've got letters from both of them I'm sorry I left them at home I could have showed you I I told them the truth but they don't want the truth now I still love them I still love my brothers I still love brother an's family but I'm letting you know they have changed the absolute they say the absolute is the tapes they say the absolute uh they say the tapes are the token they say uh going to a tape church is the token no it's not the token is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's the only token there is right there's only one absolute there's only one message that's Jesus Christ Hallelujah amen so I I know where I'm standing praise God I know what uh the Bible says I know what brother raham says hallelujah and that's how you know uh where you stand because you stay with the word of God hallelujah has anybody brother IR or brother John or anybody has anybody ever preached on just the absolute here or how about what the message is anybody ever preached that here yet to you okay well this would be good then amen Glory Hallelujah and I don't mind preaching a second time if you need it I'll preach it a second time I'll say if I need a sermon a second time Lord give me the sermon Amen Let Me preach it a second time or let me hear another sermon a second time anybody go back listen to the Future home anybody listen to that okay one or two okay all right praise God yeah all right two amen hallelujah I thought about preaching that tonight but you know as I as I got closer to this uh this meeting here tonight I'm like I want to preach this before I go to the the work you know before I leave for the summer all right now I'm going to have brother John brother John Galatians 1 6- 12 uh Sister Sarah can you get Revelation 2218 to 19 and sister Ruth would you get Proverbs 35 and 6 so I got John Sarah Ruth like God's John Galatians 61-12 now while they're turning there remember I'm going to play these quotes you get to hear Brother R's voice hopefully if it plays here tonight I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you unto the grace into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a cursed as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received let him be a cursed for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ amen and the church said amen Paul said if you change one thing that the Jesus Christ revealed to me you're cursed right and just as another example Brenham Tabernacle said we need preachers anymore we need people to press play that has changed the gospel that's a curse because Paul never said well at the end time we won't need preachers anymore the preachers can stop preaching and just press play Paul never said that so that's the that's the route of going the route of being cursed because you changed one thing about the gospel that Paul preached now you're cursed amen hallelujah amen remember Ephesians 4: 8-16 says the preachers the fivefold ministry will preach until we all come in the unity of the faith hallelujah how many know we still got to come into the unity of the faith right we still need unified you you you all need to be unified with us we need to be unified with you we all need to grow in faith until the Bride of Jesus Christ is Unified in faith Hallelujah so we can see that we're not all unified so that means God's still going to use preachers to unify us hallelujah amen all right sister uh Sarah you want to get Proverbs 2218 tonight I'm sorry did I say it wrong reel I'm sorry revelation 22 I'm sorry you're ready to turn you're ready sorry good job for I testify to every man that hear the words of this book If any man shall add these things God shall addto him the ples that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book amen we just preached on the holy city two weeks ago right John warned you if you take if you take anything out of the Bible and don't preach it or don't believe it you your name will get taken out of the book of life and you will your your part in the city will be taken out or if you add anything to the Bible that the Bible doesn't say you get the plagues added to you and brother random has quotes on all these he has quotes on Galatians one that John read quotes on this he has quotes on all these brother Ram is constantly saying these things right brother Ram was to turn our hearts back to what the apostolic fathers Amen brother Ram was to point us back to the Bible Hallelujah he wasn't pointing to himself he was pointing to Jesus Christ hallelujah amen and Jesus Christ reveals himself by the Holy Spirit but he also reveals himself by the word of God hallelujah amen amen all right now uh sister Ruth you want to read Proverbs 35 and 6 every word of God is pure he is a shield to them that put their trust in him add thou not unto his words L he reprove the amen hallelujah every word of God is pure so you don't add one word to the Bible you don't take one word away the Bible says God will call people Liars if they add to the Bible that's what he's going to do with a lot of trinitarians they're going to say well uh my my my uh School taught me you're three persons and God's going to say you lied the Bible doesn't say he's three persons or the women preachers will say well well my my church told me I could preach and God's going to say you're a liar the Bible doesn't say women can preach now those are just two simple examples right the Bible says God will call them Liars on the day of judgment because they've added to the word of God so it's so important that we just stay with the word of God Allelujah all right good now I want to go through a few quotes here before uh I want to say this here now this is my summary so let me just read this slowly the message is the absolute only if you mean the message is the Bible verses that God is currently fulfilling so if a preacher came in our church and said the message is the absolute I'd wait to say Amen until I knew what he was talking about with the message because if he starts saying oh every word on the tape is Right everything brother R ever said was right I wouldn't say Amen because now he's now he's deifying brother brandom now he's adding to the Bible right Hallelujah but if I know that preacher is talking about well the message is revelation 10:7 re the message is uh Malachi 45 and6 AM amen the message is Luke 17:30 and the message is the absolute I'll say Amen because the Bible's the absolute Hallelujah but as I said it's heresy to say the message books and the tapes are the absolute because now you've added to the Bible right now you might know this might not but I have over a hundred examples of human mistakes brother random said that are on the tapes like brother random said women have sperm brother Bram said that he just mixed up his words right so see that quote can't be the absolute because that's not true brother R he said I now brother man had some calculations and he said well I think by 1977 the whole world will be annihilated with only tree stumps left he said that that's just my prediction based upon some numbers and I have a whole video about that if you want to watch that brother was he was just trying to get people ready he he said the Lord didn't tell me this this is just my thought right well if that's the absolute then the absolute's wrong because here we are and there we have a lot of trees that are not stumps and any man that would say every word on tape is the is absolute is thus say the Lord he's insane any woman that would say every word on tape is absolute is dece deed they're insane but thank God you and I have the spirit of truth hallelujah they've got a lying Spirit on them they' got a deceived Spirit on them but we don't we have the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Truth it will only let us believe the truth amen hallelujah praise God I'm happy to be a Christian today amen starting to get happy hallelujah amen I should say Joyful Joyful is the word I want you to see that it all depends this statement the message is absolute it all depends what you mean by the message true if you mean every word on the tape then that's not true but if you mean the scriptures brother random gave us I'll say Amen to that right now I'm going to skip ahead just with this thought but I want you to show you I have a video like this too teaching it I teach it brother Bram used over 30 bible verses to define the message brother Ram never said you know my message is every word on the tapes brother R never said that that's what brandom Tabernacles uh propagating today as a lie that's a lie the message is the scriptures that God gave to brother brandham to point us back to right and I I just made a list I made a list of all I think I took 10 hours and I and I went through every time brother Bram said what the message was and these are 30 verses he used so Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today that today and forever that's the message acts 238 how many been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I did a lot of them right by God's grace that's the message hallelujah amen but said that's the message acts 238 Malachi 45 and6 Elijah will turn our hearts back to the fathers that's the message Hallelujah and church I have quotes on all these I got a video on it like like this here's Hebrews 138 I know it's small but this one example in 1962 brother man said and if I ever see you again this side of the river I'll see you on the other side believing in the same word with the same message that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah Lord Glory so I mean I could go through this whole thing I go through all 30 I have quotes from brother Brandon for all 30 every time he said these verses were th were the message I'll just go to the last one I'll do the first and the last Alpha and Omega all right does that sound good I didn't plan that but it just worked out by God's gra we find out that in Revelation 3 at the Leo age which we're now living in to my interpretation of the scripture that when the message has come forth of the leoan age as it did in each age and each age had a messenger that we come forth in this last day and we find out that that church was very rich so see look what he said the message has come forth of the leoan age so what's the message the message is the leoan church age message right it starts in Revelation 3:14 to the end of the chapter that's the message right and uh here's the quote where brother says it plainly I want to read this one too so you got it right here less than a month before brother Ram died this is December 4th 1965 brother Ram died December 24th 1965 he died the day before Christmas so 20 days before he died he said this many of you strangers perhaps hear about men get up and make these remarks about a message of this hour and so forth what they're getting at what are these people getting at when they say message of the hour he said what they're getting at is God's promise of this hour that he promised what he would do now where did he promise those things in the Bible amen hallelujah it's not in the Book of Mormon it's not in the Quran it's not in denomination it's in the Bible Hallelujah he said and we see him scripturally vindicating that's the key God's message is is what he's scripturally vindicating just exactly what he said he would do in the same manner it's foretold it's just exactly perfectly each time because it's God saying it amen hallelujah the Lord I love this quote brother says this is what the message is it's the scriptures God is fulfilling right now amen and as I showed you I just I just did maybe I think I I calculated 10 10 or 12 hours I just went through all these quotes these are the 30 verses brother ad uses to tell us he says this is my message and he uses each one of those this is my message John 5:24 1 Corinthians 6:11 acts: 15 you know all these he said these are my me this is my message it's not every human thought brother brand ever said that's not the message the message is the scriptures God is fulfilling right now Hallelujah all right now I want to read a few that are just so plain that that you'll uh you you you'll just have to remember by God's grace I believe the holy spirit will help you remember it prise the Lord now God's men will major on the word right because the word has life the word is what we're judged by we don't add to the word we don't take away from the word the true men of God will major and focus on the word of God Amen and brother R says the scriptures are the only absolute prise the Lord only he says no other this is from absolute 1963 now if he is our absolute who's the he is he talking about himself no he's talking about God if he's are absolute there can be no other everybody say those words say no other ready no there's no other if God's the absolute there can't be God in the tapes are the absolute it's either God or the tape and brother ad tells us it's God Hallelujah the tape point us to God just like if you're living in just like Martin Luther Martin Luther has all these books he's written so many books they still haven't translated all of them from German to English he wrote so many letters boy he was a writer boy he was a mastermind he was under that man anointing amen hallelujah but we're under the eagle anointing Hallelujah but see you know Luther was the messenger of his day but not everything he said was thus sayith the Lord and it has to be the same because Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever ever Hallelujah you can't make you can't make Martin Luther the absolute just like you can't make anybody else that that person themselves now Paul's a little different in one way you have to understand his letters were the absolute but he himself in his own human ideas and and maybe his sins he said he sinned every day he had to Die daily that part wasn't the absolute but it was the scripture that's the absolute all right there's no other absolute that's what brother R said he said you can't say well my church is my absolute this church is not the absolute my church is not the absolute Jesus is the absolute hallelujah amen glory you said you can't say my Creed is my absolute if Christ is your absolute you believe Christ's word amen there's no other way to do it Hallelujah there's no other absolute other than Jesus Christ how many can say Amen to thatall there you now I'm just add some scriptures you know Paul told Timothy preach the word I know not sure why I put all these oh yeah here's the here's the one brother R will use yeah when you read that Romans 3:4 let God be true but every man a liar I think we're going to get to that quote in a little bit here um Jesus said the words that I have spoken will judge him see the word is the judge Paul said God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel that just proves all of us are judged by the word of God right here we're not going to be judged by tapes that's for brother Ram we're not going to be judged by Martin Luther's books everybody understand we're going to be judged by the word of God hallelujah now do I respect what's on the tapes of course I preached it for over 20 years I preach brother br's message but as I listen to brother's message he tells me the Bible's the absolute amen and in the sermon he cares the you care 1963 brother said be very careful what you're listening to I've always asked you to be very careful what you're listening to he said so much of my sermons are just The Human Side everybody get this with a prophet you have a human side that's fallible that will make mistakes but you have a prophet side that's Divine and brother said here's how you know when God wants to speak something he'll speak it it'll say thus sayeth the Lord oh my church there's no doubt amen there's no doubt what God what God Said on the tapes is from God what God Said from on the tapes that is from God says thus sayeth the Lord Hallelujah Lord that's how it's always been prophets have always how do you know prophet's right or wrong when they speak in the name of the Lord and it comes to pass Hallelujah the Lord that's how you know right all right so when you listen to brother Ram like he said brother R said prove all things brother ramam said test me by the word that's what brother Ram said right brother R said test me by the word take everything I say back to the Bible right Hallelujah I'm just hoping that there's no William brandom worshippers in here cuz if if you are you're sure going to get burned tonight by God's grace I'm going to preach it till you repent Hallelujah and if you don't repent hopefully you repent later by God's grace we will not worship anything we will not worship anyone but Jesus Christ amen think of how ridiculous the people at brandom Tabernacle are they say the message is the is the absolute and it's the token the tapes are the token I have the quotes I got the recordings I recorded them saying it if if the if the if the record Wars are the token then my phone is born again because I have every sermon from Brother brandom on my phone is my phone Born Again Church no is see you all laugh it's ridiculous what they say and if you had all the books of brother random just up on your shelf let's say it was all these there say there shelves here does your shelf have the the token is your shelf born again because it has the message of course not but see what is it it's the devil deceiving people it's the devil getting people off the middle of the road right and that's why I tried to uh correct them privately before I went public with it right that's what every man even Paul had to call out names sometimes men of God they don't want to but they got to call out names to try to get people to repent the Bible tells us mark them that cause divisions and avoid them that's what the Bible says hallelujah so we must do these things we must tell the people the truth because the spirit of God is leading you into all truth hallelujah praise the Lord that's right brother raham said God's Own absolute is his word so brother Ram is talking about God okay let's just let's just pretend uh that my body is like God's theophany in heaven right brother said God and let's say Jesus sitting on his throne right brother said God's absolute is his word not not the tapes God's absolute God's Own absolute is his word right Glory Hallelujah brother manam said God is the absolute he said let every absolute other otherwise than mine be a lie mine is the truth hallelujah and what is that that's Romans 3:4 right he's quoting Romans 3:4 is just bringing it in a way that we can relate to it right let God be true but every man a liar amen hallelujah mine is the the truth so there is the absolute to Christianity there's the end of all arguments and the church said Hallelujah this is the end of every argument now people will if they have evil spirits on them they'll keep arguing that the tapes are the absolute or the the books are the absolute they'll keep arguing but a real Christian won't argue a real Christian knows God's absolute is the word of God hallelujah you'd be surprised how many preachers will call me a heretic for saying what I'm saying but I'm the one saying what brother br saying brother never said that my tapes are the absolute brother never said that he said you brethren in 1963 it's December 23rd questions and answers brother BR said you Brethren kind of look to me as your absolute he said but it's you follow me as I follow Christ he's using that scripture right he said kind of but right before that brother R said my absolute is the word of God lord I wish I would have put that quote up there but brother man says he says my absolute is the word of God he said I know you Brothers kind of looked at me to be the absolute that's because when he was going to preach there in questions and answers it was on the operation of the gifts and how can a local church have tongues and interpretations and deacons how does how do they take care of all those gifts operating and so brother R said take my teaching on it because you're kind of looking to me as the leader as Paul said follow me as I follow Christ brother Brandon wasn't saying I'm the absolute right he said I'm he was saying he said if if he said any person that has two heads is a monster he says in other words you can't have uh you can't have two leaders you can't have two pastors you got one Pastor because God wants one person uh all the all the questions have to be answered by one person and you do the best you can by the grace of God you understand what I'm talking about a pastor is doing the best he can a pastor is not God a pastor is not the absolute but there has to be someone where everything comes to someone has to answer all the questions right I get a lot of questions at my church right and and the pastor had the all the questions have to be answered by somebody and so God said a pastor a Shepherd over the head of the sheep does everybody understand Hallelujah but you have that quote God is his own absolute that that's why the Bible said when God made a promise to Abraham he couldn't swear by anybody else he had to swear by himself because he's he's infinite he's Eternal no one's greater than God hallelujah he can only swear by himself because he's the absolute Hallelujah right all right and here's where he says it yeah this is the full context I'm sorry ah yeah I'm sorry I wanted to make the uh the writing a little smaller he says that's the way it is in the Christian Life there's a stopping place and there's a going Place God's word is that absolute that's Christ so look God's word and Christ are the absolute if the tra if the traffic signals are not on on then we got a traffic jam well I've been to Guyana South America they don't have traffic likes there I felt like I was going to die every time I stepped into a car these people speed and they'll slam on their brakes at the last moment they're racing to get ahead there's all kinds of car accidents all the time they just move right on all their cars got bumped their buses got bumps and and dents all over them because there's no there's no absolute there's no traffic lights and I think that's what we got up here in the religious Pentagon today a traffic jam of make Believers and unbelievers and everything jammed together you just got a traffic jam why they don't have no absolute one say well we're this we're the absolute the other one said we're the absolute God is the absolute let every other absolute other than mine be a lie mine is the truth so there's the absolute to Christianity that's the end of all arguments the Bible said so that makes it right amen hallelujah now I love this one too this is beautiful now I believe that God can do things that's not written in this Bible I believe he can because he's God but just long as he does what he promise here is good enough for me I don't believe that anything should be added to this book or taken from it and the church said that's what sister Sarah read right Revelation 2218 to 19 I believe it's the complete revelation of Jesus Christ I believe that's what it is amen and all Doctrine Doctrine just means teaching so a lot of these preachers they say oh there's too much Doctrine you can't have too I mean you can't have too much true Doctrine Doctrine means instruction so when a preacher is preaching like maybe Simon Simon was instructing you on the statute of perfect man right and how how th those those those enemies uh for Joshua were a type for you because you're going to fight enemies once you get in the land right that's teaching you that's instructing you how to fight battles church amen if somebody comes and preaches here's how you pray or here's how you fast or here's how you uh here's how you operate the gifts of the holy spirit anytime or here's how you receive a miracle if anybody teaches you how to do something they just gave you Doctrine Hallelujah is that right and Paul said in second Timothy 1 he said teach no other Doctrine than the doctrine that Jesus revealed to him other words the bible teach no other doctrines than what the Bible says is everybody catching this tonight now look at this look how humble brother R says and if you catch me saying things and doing things that's not scripturally and promise scripture for this hour than the thing to do you owe it to me to see the manager and see that I'm straightened up for it see brother random said brother R was so humble he said if I'm wrong I Want to Be Right somebody come correct me by the Bible right that's how your attitude should be too amen right brother Irvin if I'm wrong brother Irvin then you come show me in the Bible I'll say praise the Lord I'm sorry Hallelujah that's what brother Ram said if you catch me saying and doing things that aren't in the Bible come show me because I want to be right that's because that's my absolute amen hallelujah amen glory because look because I'm a hard to see because I'm a human being too I want to go to heaven the same as the rest of you does brother brandom knew if we take away from the Bible our name could be taken out of the book of life that's why he's saying that glory and church just so you know maybe you don't know but let me tell you a lot of churches that claim to be message are not message because Satan has come in and he's taken something maybe on the tape that was just brother Ram's idea or something and they've made it into this big major Doctrine and it's a false Doctrine right that's Satan's job Satan attack the message harder than all the other churches cuz this is the word for our day right right I have a quote from Martin Luther I put it in my book yeah you got the book there Martin Luther said I hope 10% of the people that were baptized he said are still in the Lutheran Church in other words Martin Luther said I've seen 90% of the the message people fall away during my lifetime 90% brother and didn't Jesus say few there be that find the narrow road didn't he say that Matthew 7:14 so when we see people falling away from the message today it don't surprise me it's always been that way Jesus had what uh 82 preachers 70 left him brother Daniel the most of his preachers left him and then Judas left amen most of them left that's how it always is thank God that you stayed true to God thank God that you got the right absolute the absolute is Jesus Christ the word of God hallelujah and then Jesus turned and looked at the 12 and said you want to go to you wern't scared to be in little church and the church said amen don't be scared of being a little church I've had a little little church for 18 years now I'd rather be a little church than a big church with a bunch of false doctrines adding to the Bible taking away from the Bible worshiping brother Bram that's sin that's heresy brother raham came to point us to the word of God right the Bible says you give double honor to the preacher that labor in the word of God brother Ram deserves our double honor the Bible said honor all men right so you give respect to everybody but you give double respect to preachers who labor in the word of God and study the word and preach the truth give them double honor the Bible says brother R said his his ministry the seven Church age messenger he said deserves no other honor than the honor that John the Baptist got Hallelujah see brother is not to be worshiped brother R is not to be an idol brother is not to be prayed to he said never baptize in my name now you all know that but you'd be surprised there's a lot of there's a lot of people around the world that believe nonsense like that because they're not born again if you get born again you get the holy spirit in your soul and brother said that holy spirit's a fire but it's also he said it's a buzzer so when you hear something wrong it goes up don't believe that it's a false preacher he's telling lies and said it's there to protect your life Hallelujah amen amen the Holy Ghost is a buzzer and when you hear a false Doctrine it goes off to protect your life so you don't fall into some false Doctrine like a polygamy Doctrine men can marry as many women as they want that's a lie from Hell Hallelujah the Bible said you stay one until death do you part Hallelujah they just misunderstand brother Ram they they don't even look at brother Ram's own life he only married one woman right after his first wife died he married one right they don't even they don't even look at him look at his example he Liv the example before us hallelujah thank God for a Godly example amen hallelujah so I'll say like that for all of you if you catch me saying things that aren't in the Bible you come straighten me out after service right but you be better be ready to be corrected if you're wrong cuz think about that if I'm wrong you're pulling a sword you're bringing a sword to me to try to correct me but if you're wrong I'm pulling out my sword too we're going to see who wins that's what the word of God is the word of God is the sword right I don't mind being corrected but you better make sure you're right right especially on topics like this because I got quotes and I got the Bible I got brother R quoting the Bible amen saying there's no other absolute he said the Bible God Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is the absolute Hallelujah in other words God in every form God in every form is the absolute hallelujah amen this is God in paper form and the church said brother said the pillar of fire is the absolute that means god in the logos form or God in the theophany form is the absolute Hallelujah he said Jesus sitting on the throne of God is the absolute amen hallelujah God in every form is the absolute praise God hallelujah now I'm getting excited again here brother now here's here's that church order quote yes brother Bram said I expect you Brethren at any time you see me get away from this scripture No not not the tapes not my books if you get me away from the scripture to come to me privately and tell me where I'm wrong I don't care if you're one of the trustees or if you're the janitor so trustees would be a highly esteemed person in the church wow you're a trustee you're in charge of the grounds and you do all the legal documents well you're just the janitor you just you just clean the toilets brother said I don't care if you're the highest man or the lowest man come correct me if I'm off the word of God whoever you are you're Duty bound to me as a brother in Christ to tell me when I'm wrong scripturally if there's a question let's sit down and solve it out together Hallelujah because the Bible says if you bring uh against an elder receive an accusation but before two or three Witnesses now Elder can mean two things it can mean just a a man who has a lot more years of experience or brother said it also can mean a pastor because he's brother calls him the local Elder he's the head of the church okay so Elder can mean two things he says that in the church age book as well Elder can mean two things so brother R is even opening himself up to be corrected by one person if it's just a janitor or if it's trustee come to me privately and try to correct me let's sit down and try to solve it out together I have a whole video on how brother random was open to correction brother random would he'd receive correction from anybody as long as it was scriptural I got a whole video on it boy a lot of people didn't like that video I'm like how can you not like the video there's quotes from Brother brandom on the video oh you say you believe every quote from Brother brand but you don't like the quotes I use on this video oh it's cuz you don't really believe the message you don't you don't believe the Bible amen if you believe the Bible you'd agree with what I said because I use the Bible to explain it Hallelujah now I'm going to skip past that I'll go back to that here let's see yes in 1964 brother Bram said a man came up him to try to tempt him so this man was anointed with the devil and a man come up and Tred to tell brother brandom you prophesied you've had dreams and Visions surely you can write another book to the Bible that's what the devil did to Joseph Smith and Joseph Smith took a hookline and sinker because he's a false prophet right a man came up I'm going to read this quote it's a longer quote but I want you to hear it it's very important a man come up and said you ought to be able to write down what the seven Thunders uttered and it's going to be something outside the Bible he he he he he he puts it on him real thick there put it on real thing to try to get him to add to the word of God but brother Rand was a prophet and you're not going to you're not going to trick a genuine Prophet into adding on to the Bible Glory Hallelujah Amen brother said you cannot add one word to the Bible and we all know the tapes have comments and just words from we have they have words in them that aren't in the Bible so you can't make the tapes equal I've heard people hold up uh the Bible and brother's books and say if I had a choice between these two I'd take the books shame on you amen shame on you there's not two absolutes there's only one absolute and they say well I couldn't understand this Bible if I didn't have these tapes what a lie from the devil there's people in Iran right now in Iraq that never got a tape of brother randam but Jesus Christ is appearing to them and telling them the truth of the word of God hallelujah amen see how slick that devil is I couldn't understand this Bible without the I mean that's true to some degree but this book also has human thoughts in it like I told you right so see it's a lie said there's only one there's no other absolute God's word is the absolute Hallelujah all right now let's read this here so you can see it everyone has always come to me and said can you imagine brother BR them seven Thunders that the voice thundered and he said write it not but close it up and said there'll be seven Thunders that'll be revealed in the last days see seven Thunders that'll tell us now don't that sound real good see but watch what you're talking about when you say that he said see that you write it not John said that see these seven Thunders utter their voices see and he said don't write that see but it's to be sealed up in the book until the last days now someone has been many has been saying to me and theologians said brother brandham said if the Lord God with your experience that the Lord has given you for his people humb humbly saying this you would be eligible to write a Bible yourself your word if God has man manifested right brother Rand had remember the seven major Visions dream brother brand had or visions rather not dream brother had all these Visions from God and they were true and so the Devil comes up and said you might as well put those in a book because aren't they from God what a slick devil but let's leave let's see what brother random answered brother didn't say oh yeah let's let's add on to the Bible brother never said that he I said that might be true in other words those experiences were from God God manifested himself in my life see he was trying to catch me see the devil anointed another man to try to tempt brother Brenham to add on to the Bible Hallelujah but I said you see I couldn't do that why couldn't you you have all the qualifications to add onto the Bible I said but look one word cannot be added or taken away see and he said well then what about them seven Thunders and wouldn't them seven Thunders blasting out wouldn't that be a revelation be given to some man I said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it brother said it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was the Thunders the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of the seven Thunders that's what it was see it's still in the word everybody say still in the word ready still in the word amen you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word God's spirit will never leave that word Hallelujah Lord it'll stay right with that word blinding some and Open the Eyes of others it'll always do that hallelujah amen I know where I'm standing today church amen I know where I'm standing I'm standing on the word of God the absolute praise God Lord amen see they tempted brother Brandon you just try to you just try to add something you just add your own experiences add it on to the Bible brother said I'd be cursed if I did that everybody understand that by God's grace right amen all right now brother said the Keystone or the foundation stone or the Cornerstone of the Bible is that God cannot change his word in other words this church you're a young church but your Cornerstone has to be these verses brother is going to tell us the Cornerstone of your church is that God cannot change right God won't change his word and say well now we don't need preachers just press play God won't change listen to taking sze with Jesus in 1962 brother R said I want to I want to train up ministers so when I go overseas and I leave I can send these brothers to go preach and they can start churches he didn't say when I leave I can send tape players he said I'm going to send preachers because God has always ordained preachers hallelujah it's always been that way amen God's not going to change his program and the church said God will not change his program that's the whole Cornerstone of the church right that God's word does not change oh it makes me happy brother irin amen makes me happy because for 20 years I've stood I've preached for 20 years and no man can deceive me because God showed me his foundation stone Hallelujah no man can knock over my building because I'm founded on the rock hallelujah I'm founded on the Bible everything we believe comes from the Bible and the Bible doesn't change Amen brother Daniel I just got to say God when I get questions about certain teachings and doctrines brother Daniel I just got to say God stir up my Mind by way of remembrance help me to remember the truth help me to remember the Keystone help me to go back to the foundation stone amen Lord because the devil will bring quotes from brother brandom and try to twist it and make it say something it don't say like this week somebody tried to uh bring a a a devil lie to me and said uh they said there's no more Redemption for the the there's no more Redemption for the world Jesus is done being the Redeemer I said sir you are dece Ed by an evil spirit and they took some quote out of the first seal where B said when Jesus Takes the book there's no more Redemption and they just cut it off right there I said you forgot to keep reading right hallelujah hallelujah and I I I showed him all these quotes uh uh a year later in questions and answer 64 they asked brother Ram is Mercy over and brother R said don't ever think that he said you keep flowing into Mercy he said uh with all that you've got he said he said God is still saving he said he said he said Mercy will be over when Jesus raptures the bride off the Earth Hallelujah so Mercy last until we leave so if I'm here there's still Mercy if you're here there's still Mercy when we leave that's when Mercy's over because God cuts off the Gentile branch and he puts back in the Jewish Branch how many Bible readers we got in here tonight that's in Romans 11 God cut off the Israel Branch when Jesus died right because they rejected Christ he grafted in the Gentile branch and then he says when the time of Gentiles is fulfilled I'm cutting the Gentile Branch off and I'm putting the Jews back in ah Lord then brother quotes uh Revelation 22:17 he that's righteous let him be righteous still he that's holy let him be holy still he that's filthy let him be filthy still he that's Unholy let him be Unholy still so Church let's be holy still hallelujah amen let's be holy now amen glory to God see they'll use a quote but they'll bring some devilish lie to come in and say oh there's no more Redemption and Jesus Is On The Mercy Seat I got news for it Jesus does a lot in heaven not only does he intercede that's what the Bible there's at least four things he does in heaven he intercedes I put them on the video this week I have to remember some of them here he intercedes uh the other one he do brother Ram said he oh yeah John 14 says I go to prepare a place for you I go to prepare a mansion for you prise the Lord Daniel you you prepared a really nice house for your wife Miriam and your family but Jesus is going to prepare an even better one for you buddy am so Jesus has to intercede then he has to hear all your prayers but Daniel now it is have to hear your prayers he's got to build your Mansion not only does have to do that he has to have all the all the demons and angels present themselves before him on a certain day in heaven remember that from Job chapter 1 the Bible said there's a Day in heaven when all the Angels got to present themselves even the devils and tell them where what they're doing now God knows but God reminds them I'm the God of this world I'm the God of this I'm sorry I'm the God of this universe amen I'm the God of this universe and then if you read your Bible Micaiah if you read about Micaiah Micaiah said I saw uh I saw heaven open and God was having a counsel in heaven with all the spirits he said who go down and deceive uh Ahab for me and remember one devil come up and said this one devil come up and said that and then the lying spirit said I'll go deceive him I'll be a lying spirit in all the mouth of His prophets and God said go do what you've got to do I've got to fulfill my word that I sent by Elijah oh God's going to fulfill what he said by Brother Ram that had thus sayth the Lord Hallelujah Lord God's going to fulfill the word of Elijah hallelujah amen so I just gave you four things Jesus does in heaven and brother said he can do that because heaven goes faster than this Dimension Heaven goes way faster than this Dimension everything's slow down here right slow to fix things slow to get things done when am I ever get my honeydew list done you know Welly I'll be struggling on that one for a long time but Jesus can go from interceding then he can go from Council and then he can go to to uh to build building uh the future home and then he can go to to meeting with having the demons check in that's what the Bible says how many believe the Bible praise God he has time to do that and the Bible said he ever lives he lives to make intercession for us hallelujah that's why he reigned that's why he conquered death so that he could be he could be touched by the feeling of your infirmities hallelujah amen he can do it all because he can't be limited is anything too hard for God and the church said is it too hard for God to be to Jesus be intercessor build a future home have Heavenly Council meetings is that too hard for God no there's nothing too hard for God but these people that got evil spirits they take one quote and they reject all the Bible you know what he he text it back brother Irvin he just said well you're you're deceived and all these things he didn't even give me a Bible verse that's called being a baby that's called being a child if he was a real man he tried to give me some scriptures to show where I'm wrong but see he had no scriptures that shows he doesn't have the truth hallelujah they'll name call me say oh you're intellectual uh you're a devil you're Satan all these things like that I'm a believer I'm a holy ghost filed Saint I'm a sinner saved by grace Hallelujah and my absolute is the Bible not some man who's trying to just oh yeah he's saying he said yeah I preached that back in 2003 and now you need to get all my tapes and you need to get my teaching on all this and stuff like that I don't want your teaching I want God's teaching Hallelujah I'm not mad I'm just I'm just being serious and Stern because it's a serious thing right one false Doctrine is called a doctrine of devils false Doctrine is called leav and leav puffs up the dough right right one false Doctrine then spreads if it's not corrected it'll spread to other doctrines and then pretty soon the church is full of false doctrines that's what happened at Brand Tabernacle recently I'm not talking about when brother R was here I'm talking about after brother left one false Doctrine if it's not corrected that leav will keep growing it'll impact the whole church doctrine that's what happened to the Roman Catholic Church they got the trinity in there look at them now they hardly even could recognize the Bible right everybody see that I've been keeping track of how long I've been preaching okay uh almost an hour all right okay been a good Audience by God's grace good audience now let's go let's go through these quotes here just briefly this is from the church age book the Keystone the Bible is God cannot change his word God cannot change his word that's the key Keystone of the whole Bible brother said the key given me of the Lord whereby I was able to determine the messenger for each age is a most scriptural one in fact it might be called the Keystone of the Bible it's the Revelation that God never changes and that his ways are as unchangeable as he isise the Lord and then he gives us some verses how many happy about that Hallelujah Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever right oh yeah then somebody said uh oh brother Ram can be our pastor even though he's dead I said that's a lie brother Ram said in the future home I won't always be your pastor and then I took him back to uh numbers 27 in numbers 27 God told Moses Moses you've glorified yourself you're going to the way of all the Earth he said go get Joshua and anoint him before the people he's going to lead the people in and lead the people out because I don't want my sheep without a Shepherd Hallelujah the Lord Glory what am I saying Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever when Moses went off the scene a prophet God raised up another man he didn't say Moses is still your still your uh Pastor now that he's dead he said Moses my servant is dead Joshua only be strong and very courageous Hallelujah amen glory everybody with me a dead man has never been a pastor to any true child of God hallelujah never when Moses died God raised up with Joshua Hallelujah when Paul died God raised up with Timothy brother irin hallelujah hallelujah when brother R died God raised up an Orman Neville Hallelujah brother Neville is a good man of God hallelujah he's a real man of God that's right now Ecclesiastes 3:14 and 15 I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken away from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him okay so those are the two verses brother and remember in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established brother gives us two verses to show that God is unchangeable and his ways are unchangeable that's how he chose the seven Church a messeng MERS he said which man was most like St Paul he's got to be really close to St Paul because God doesn't change his ways so Paul ireneus Martin Columba Luther Wesley brother brandham those are the men that were most like Paul because God doesn't change his ways hallelujah how many believe that by God's grace with all my heart Glory yeah I'm sorry there's still there's still more to this verse sorry that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and God required that which is passed see all this LGB nonsense it already was it was in Sodom and Gomorrah except in s gomorah they had men gangs busting into the houses it was such lawlessness that the law allow them to break into people's houses and do sodomy that which has been or that which is has already been thank God that we're protected by the grace of God here it is brother says an unchanging God with unchanging ways what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it's done for the last time there will never be a change everybody Say Never Never apply that to the church ages the kind of man that God chose for the first age and how God manifested in that man's Ministry would be the example for all other ages what God did in the first church age is what he wants to do in all other ages Lord hallelujah all right now before I get to this let's see I want to play part of this video here's a video I made of this William bram's absolute was Jesus Christ not his tapes sorry I actually I want you to hear some of these this is a video I made years ago because I was so burdened how can these people saying their message Believers make brother Brandon the absolute and his tape's the absolute when brother BR said it's it wasn't Jesus Christ is the absolute there's no other absolute I guess it's what the Bible calls uh righteous indignation I guess this what the Bible calls Zeal and the church said anybody got any Zeal tonight for the word of God God loves Zeal brother now you got to make sure your Zeal don't eat up your wisdom though right don't be zealous over bad things be zealous over good that's why I got Zeal like I do because it's righteous Zeal I know what the Bible says I know what brother Ram said Hallelujah on this topic I don't know everything on every topic but I know what he said on this topic and so this is a 30 minute video guess it it's 30 minute video I can send the link to you just text me whatever uh just be careful on YouTube I know I you know but what what can you say brother brandom had radio Ministries during his life but you got to be careful on the radio too some people say you shouldn't be on YouTube well why is brother BR on the radio then it's the same thing right it's still getting messages out there you can still pick up good stuff and bad stuff Glory all right I'm going to try to go I'm speeding up a little bit William bram's absent was Jesus Christ name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to prove that William bram's absolute was the person of Jesus Christ and not his tapes yes you could say William bram's absolute was Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost the word of God and the Bible so I this video shows brother said all these are the absolute but they're only one they're God right Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost the word of God the Bible brother quotes all these are the absolute never once did he say I'm the absolute and not not the Bible nonsense brother Ram said I'm not infallible brother Ram said no Prophet was infallible in everything they ever said or did Hallelujah brother R said in one quote I got it on here he said to make me infallible is Tommy root you know what that is like rotten stuff right right to make me the infallible is Tommy Rod but yet when he said thus say to the Lord is that infallible yes because you're separating the prophet side from The Human Side and the church said I don't want you to fall asleep that's why I'm saying that I want to hear you say amen I tell you w't me be falling asleep if you're watching whatever your favorite thing is Right amen amen you be falling asleep on me right cuz it's not me preaching it's God's word hallelujah amen when I get tired I got to stand up too I when I get tired I stand up and say praise God glory you got to wake yourself up amen don't get tired on God hallelujah but he never said takes wor the absolute as the T Church Jeffersonville erroneously teaches I first want to express my gratitude to God bit I'm very thankful I've reached out to people in Jeffersonville uh they wouldn't accept uh correction that's fine but they're going to be uh oh thank you brother oh yeah so I start with first you have to Define an absolute the absolute sorry the absolute well I don't walk worthy no but Christ in me makes me walk worthy I love him I testify of him I'm not perfect never will be in this world you're not perfect never will be but my love to him so in that quote brother says I'm not perfect but an absolute is perfect according to brother Ram's own definition that's why it's important to Define things let me see if I can go back sorry I having a little trouble with the controls here oh yeah I skipped ah head way too much forgive me from his Webster's Dictionary was similar see Unlimited in its power perfect in itself and it really is an ultimate the word absolute okay so here brother bam reads out of a Webster dictionary how many got a Websters out there well I got on my phone now I can get on my phone that's a blessing in high school I couldn't do that I had to go look in the actual dictionary anybody remember that oh a you dated yourself see an absolute is Unlimited in its power brother said oh it's perfect in itself brother BR said I'm not perfect so that instantly shows he cannot be the absolute right only Jesus Christ can be the absolute am and it really is Ultimate the word absolute brother bram's own words disprove Jefferson Bill's beliefs that every word of brother Bram is the absolute as you'll soon see based upon these definitions only God or Jesus Christ can be the absolute scripture says the Lord God omnipotent reth which means Almighty ruler of all Revelation 196 and I okay so see omnipotent brother says brother said the absolute is all powerful that's what the word omnipotent means never said I'm I'm omnipotent right he said the Bible said Jesus is omnipotent everybody got that amen as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty thunderings sing Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth brother Brandon plainly says he is not perfect so that discludes him and every single word of his as being the absolute don't walk worthy no but Limited in Power and Jesus had all power Jesus had all power this proves Christ is the absolute Matthew 2818 and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me so he's the absolute he's got all power on the other hand brother brandham admits he has no power just like all of us have now when Jesus Christ heals the sick now I don't say they'll be healed I can't tell you that remember I have no power to heal I don't have power you don't have any power none of us does we have authority how many understands that and the church said amen see to be the absolute you have to have all you have to be omnipotent Almighty all power perfect but says I'm not perfect I have no power I'm sorry he's not the absolute right he can't be because only one person fits that qualification you know who he is amen hallelujah I'm glad I know him amen prise the Lord I know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings hallelujah amen I'm not going to play all this but I want to hit some highlights next God's absolute is himself and his word some of these already I went over here there is only one absolute and that is God himself and his word Romans 3:4 says God forbid be true but every man a liar okay so listen here's the quote brother Ram quotes Romans 3:4 I read this earlier absolute that we're the absolute God's the God's the absolute he said let every absolute otherwise than mine be a lie mine is the truth what he says absolute to Christianity that's the end of all arguments the Bible said so that makes it right Jesus says God's word is the absolute saying Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away in Matthew 24:35 this this is the scripture brother brandom uses in reference to the absolute it's almost got to a place like it was in the days of Judges everybody has their own absolute let me just stop there a moment isn't that true seems like every church has their own absolute but brother said God only has one absolute that's his word it all fails like the Pharaohs and so forth but God's absolute is his word he gives it in heavens and earth will pass away but it shall never pass away I like that how many like that friends if God himself and his word is the absolute how can the words of a man be the absolute they cannot as brother random quoted Romans 34 as proof that God is the absolute God's the absolute someone just playing that again that's probably the fourth time you've seen that tonight I don't want you to forget it that is the truth is the absolute to Christianity now let's listen to four statements by brother brandham that prove his absolute was only Jesus CH Jesus Christ and there can be no other absolute and there is only one absolute always says there's only always one absolute how many other ways can you say it there's only one there's no other it's always just one he's saying Jesus Christ is our absolute Hallelujah but these people from Jeffersonville are saying the tapes are the absolute shame on them they're lying they're liars and God will make them uh God will hold them accountable if they don't repent does everybody understand I'm showing you the quotes you can hear them yourself you can read the Bible yourself and that's what God wants you to do God wants you to be so in love with the word of God till no man can deceive you amen God forbid but if I should fall away and try to bring in a false Doctrine here you would say no brother Jesse that's not the truth I'm staying with the Bible Hallelujah in the church age book brother man said you'll know the seven Church age messenger when he comes he said he said the seven Church age Messenger will be in the word exactly as Paul gave it right and the church said look it up he said exactly how Paul gave the word that's how you'll know he's the seven Church age messenger Paul never said press play on the tapes Paul never said that we don't need a fivefold Minister anymore that that's what the the pastor that's what Joseph brandom said and he said you've got to catch the vision you've got to play the tapes basically saying you've got to catch the vision preachers got to sit down and play brother random that's a lie and I called him out for it he didn't receive it but that's fine he don't have to he's got his own said you're an American citizen you got the right to do that but with God God has one absolute Hallelujah God has one absolute that's his word now listen to these I've already read two of them but I don't think two of them we haven't heard yet the absolute is a person an eternal person and not a collection of audio MP3 files and if your absolute is in some organization or some sensation or something else besides person the person of Jesus Christ you come to the same potion of Shame only work if your absolute is not Christ everybody see that who's the ABS the absolute's a person now see not only is is it this is the person's word this is God's word but this is the word of the person Jesus Christ is the absolute that's the only spner post of the human life and Christ Christ is the word not your church upon this absolute then he quotes Matthew 16 upon Upon This Rock I'll build my church upon this absolute I'll build my church William never said his tapes were the absolute listen as brother brandom says there is only one absolute and there is no other absolute and it wasn't his tapes and cannot be his tapes because there are no other absolutes that's right when we got one absolute that's the word of the Living God that settles it forever no matter what anyone else says okay so there's not two there's not three absolutes there's one absolute right how many believe brother BR was a prophet yes amen me too Hallelujah that's why I'm preaching [Music] this now if he is our absolute there can be no other absolute you can't have say my my church is my absolute my Creed is my absolute if Christ is your absolute you believe Christ's word there no other way to do it amen every say no other again ready no other there's no other absolute there's only one that's Jesus Christ yes sir he is my absolute now making your absolute take in the a time of my trouble he's always asking always everybody say always ready always no other there's only one always it's Jesus Christ amen hallelujah do the tap tapes help us of course I love the tapes I just listened to a message of Grace yesterday 1961 I love the tapes that's where I get my inspiration for my sermons most of the time but I never put the tapes equal to the Bible because the tapes have human mistakes Hallelujah brother brandom's personal absolute was the word oh yeah I love this one the Bible my absolute is the word the Bible and as a pastor here of the church my absolute is the word now that's what I was telling you about earlier he said my absolute is the word of God he didn't say I'm the absolute he didn't say my tapes are the absolute he said the word of God is my absolute how many enjoying these quotes by God's grace I tell you I like to hear Brother Braham say it too he puts all that emphasis on there there's no other absolute you just that Stern prophet of God hallelujah there's no other there's only one Jesus Christ Hallelujah the truth is brother Brandon preached about the absolute Jesus Christ who is the word of God or the Holy Ghost next here's three false beliefs of the tape Church move we'll play these and then we'll we'll close up here leadership at brandham Tabernacle erroneously teaches and I quote I believe everything brother brandom says is thus sayeth the Lord this message has to be my absolute I'm going to pause right there that's what Joseph Brenham brother Ram son said he even wrote to that wrote that to me in a letter I have the letter at home everything he said was thus say the that's idolatry that's like brother R said remember Shadrach Meshach and abedo brother R said that that Idol they were going to bow to was Daniel do you know brother Bram said that because the the uh the the idol was called belto shazar that was Daniel's name and brother BR said that's what people are going to do at the end time they're trying to get people to bow down to brother Bram trying to make him God he's not God he was a servant of God he's a prophet of God hallelujah right end quote this statement makes every word and I have recordings of these as well plus the letters I have video recordings of these brother brandham thus sayith the Lord or infallible additionally they teach and I quote it must be all or nothing I have to believe that everything on tape is thus sayith the Lord and the absolute the token for our day and I must unquestion L believe every word of brother Bram on tape end quote that's what he wrote to me in the letter it's either all or nothing and brother Ram said that's not how it is brother Ram said you got to be careful some of it's human some of it's God the way you'll know is thus sayith the Lord that's God hallelujah this is a dangerous dangerous false do and I humbly believe it's the spirit of idolatry Spirit of idolatry the danger of these statements is deifying William brandham by making every word he said the absolute when not every word he said was from God as he admitted himself on numerous occasions so brother Braham admitted many times not every word I say is from God brother Braham said it many times I'm going to play it for you in 1958 by faith Moses brother brandom said in regards to his 1977 prediction it was not the Lord saying it which means it was not thus sayith the Lord and that I predict now this is not the Lord saying this the other about the woman in this is the Lord but I predicted in 19 and and 3 33 that the world would meet total Annihilation before 77 now this shows right here how insane brandham Tabernacle is they say every word is thus say the lord well if it is then how can this be thus say the lord it's not he this is not the Lord saying this it's a total contradiction brother saying this is not the Lord but Jeffersonville is saying this is the Lord that's a contradiction does everybody see that it's insan that's why I said they have a spirit of insanity if they say every word on the tape is thus say the Lord yeah brother said this is not the Lord You Know What It Takes brother irin is going to take some real mature Believers to really believe God in this day it's going to take that statue perfect man amen it's going to take some real Believers to stand up to the evil Giants of this day I'm almost done you been a great audience William random also said it was a very awful thing in Tommy rot to make him infallible they're claiming here that some Breen up there that said that I sent them up there and they're preaching that men should leave their wives and hunt for their spiritual mate and that um that I am perfectly infallible okay so brother talking about he said some people went up to Michigan and said brother R said you can leave your wife and go find a spirit ual wife that's adultery and then they were saying brother Rand is perfectly in Fable brother R said those are some of the awfulest things a person could say to make brother brandham infallible or every word he said is thus say the Lord and yet that's what the church in brandham Tabernacle that's what they say they say every word is infallible I got the letter I got the audio if there's nothing and some the aw some awest things you've ever heard this church knows that we don't stand for No Such Tommy Rod is that and I shared this with Joseph and Billy Paul it's Tommy Rod if you say every word's in Fable that's Tommy rot it's awful now they were nice in their replies but they wouldn't repent so who you going to stand with you got to stand with the truth amen don't stand with me stand with the absolute amen hallelujah because that's what I'm standing with that's what we all want to stand with is God's absolute the word of God hallelujah right thirdly Jeffersonville teaches only the true Seed of Abraham believe every word on brother bram's tapes or thus sayith the Lord which excludes everyone else from being the Royal Seed of Abraham and I quote but God's Prophet told us there would be a group of people that would believe every word they are the real living Seed of Abraham okay so Joseph brandham said this you have to believe every word on the tape or you're not this the spiritual Seed of Abraham look at the fear that creates in people oh well I believe brother is a prophet and there there's truth on the tapes well I better listen to his son that's an evil spirit because brother just said you can't make me imp perfectly infallible that's Tommy rot everybody understand quote friends notice the pressure of fear this movement is using oh yeah that's what brother said false prophets will always put fear on you to make you follow them right so that's what I believe I've told well I put out there to Joseph I shared the video with him I believe you're a false prophet brother I've told him that I've told I've emailed to Brand tabern about 30 times they never email back and I said I'll come up there and meet with you I said I'll I'll drive down there I'll meet with you and talk about these things but they ever want to meet with me no I said I made a 30 minute long video and just for Joseph and Milly Paul just pleading with them to hear me meet with me they would they watch it well at least somebody ran up Tabernacle watch it it's got like eight views on it somebody somebody watch it but they want to meet with me brother uran cuz who am I I'm nobody that's fine I want to be a nobody but I want to know somebody named Jesus I want to know the absolute praise God say falsely if you don't believe every word of brother brandom on tape as thus sayith the Lord you are not the real Royal Seed of Abraham the truth is real Believers the real Seed of Abraham do not exalt every word of William Brandon to be infallible or thus sayith the Lord this is because they know brother brandham says a true prophet and true leaders won't hold you to their own words in fear but will point you to the word of God Church age book chapter n leoan Church age have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray B words themselves by fear I'm reading a qu they say that if the people don't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow they are false prophets for a true Prophet will always lead one to the word a true Prophet will always lead you to the word and the church said I know you're get tired Jesus Christ and he won't tell the people to fear Him or what he says but to fear what the word says brother said a real Prophet will say fear what the word says Don't Fear a man fear the word sound sound to anybody like the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom that that sound scriptural right thankfully as you listen to more of brother brandom's tapes you find the truth that he made human mistakes yet he was a genuine Prophet brother brandom said he was not infallible okay now listen to this brother brand said I'm not in Fable but yeah I just showed you brother br's son says every word on the tape is thus sayith the Lord who's right brother brandom or a son brother rand's right make mistakes you pray for me I'm not I'm your not infallible brother brandom said prophets are not infallible people prophets are not people prophets are not brother brandom said there were Mix-Ups on his tapes see look at this brother said there's mixup there's mistakes on the tapes yet brandom Tabernacle says every word is thus sayith the Lord I'm sorry God Don't Make Mistakes church has God ever made a mistake no so if there's mistakes on the tapes then they can't be infallible that's right they can't be the absolute about like other day I got something mixed up I happen to hear it I called it right there and it's on the tape and I I probably hear from it but if you Haven to catch that on your tape remember look in the Bible I love that brother R says there's mistakes on the tape so if you catch a mistake he said look in the Bible can we all say amen amen if you hear something on tape and it's not exactly right brother R said look in the Bible Hallelujah and he was talking about the feasts the seven feasts of Israel in that particular quote brother brandom said prophets make mistakes and every Prophet made their mistakes said every Prophet makes mistakes now all I can say I'm a man my words can just fail it's like any other man all of us I prove to you tonight that every Prophet everything else they made their mistakes but God makes no mistakes his word is brother random said he made thousands of mistakes each year I make thousands of mistakes each month and each year Sur I do but when I see him wrong I said God I didn't mean to do that you know my heart I didn't mean to do that I was trapped into that I didn't mean to do you forgive me Lord Brother brandom said every Prophet must be tested by the word have test we must test and prove all things that's in Acts 17 remember the ible said those in uh uh Berea were more noble than those in thessalonica because they took the word of God what Paul said and they search the scriptures every day how many reading your Bible every day you better if not you're going to get deceived if you don't read your Bible every day the word comes to the prophets how do you test the prophet to find out whether it is according to the word if it's according to the word then God's word becomes a lie we all speak the same thing then we must speak not contrary but exactly with this everybody say exactly ready exactly with this word we have to speak exactly what the Bible says that's how a true Prophet is tested word that's how a true Prophet is tested whether he's got the word the Bible say if their testimony is not according to the law and Prophets there's no light in them it's got to be according to the word amen now here is the time okay now I'm going to skip ahead I got to close because there's so many I I didn't realize brother said yeah brother said we must prove All Things by the scripture see everything on tape you got to take it back to the Bible he said that but let me go check that by the Bible I got to prove All Things by now look brother said look brother said if it's contrary to my faith and yet the scripture says so then the scripture is right and I'm wrong look how humble brother irin brother brah was if I say something on my tapes there's a mixup he said look in the Bible if the and if I say something that's not in the Bible then I'm wrong the Bible's right hallelujah amen brother hallelujah oh I'm happy tonight I'm thankful I'm I'm grateful to the Lord Jesus Christ amen CU he sent us a bible-based prophet right now I'm closing with this I'm going to skip to the end you need to watch this video if you if you have any questions about the absolute it'll help you I'm going to close with this quote brother said that's where we point to Jesus Christ the son of God so that's what the tapes do the tapes point us to Jesus Christ don't they right we see brother R discern people in the prayer lines we we hear Miracles all these stories what does that do it makes us go read our Bible right now look what brother man's praying grant that he will be so real to everyone here today even to the little children how many little children we got here we want Jesus Christ to be so real to them right Jesse right buddy that's I know his name and he will become he will become not brother brand brother said brother never said I'll become the absolute he said that Jesus will become the absolute of the entire congregation we ask it in Jesus name and the church said let's stand to our feet I'm going to close here they sing I love him I love him then brother Ram said how many feels he's your absolute the word he is the word do you believe that he's the word and the Holy Spirit dramatized that word to make that light living you of the word the Vindication of the word put the word in your heart put Let the Holy Spirit come in and watch the word move believe be humble don't desire to be a great somebody be a nobody that God can make you a somebody amen God bless you let's have a let's bow our hearts for just a moment I know I preach a hard thing I know I preach where I have to call names but Paul called names brother brandham called names sometimes my name has been called people call people can call whatever they want but I'm trying to get you to see who the absolute is and I got to call names to do it because they've spread false Doctrine to millions of people around the world and I'm just one voice there's a few voices there's some voices crying out against these lies and I want to put my voice in there they told Brother r one time brother Ram that's the pastor's job to teach about women not cutting their hair and not wearing makeup and brother Bram said but if they're not doing it someone's got to do it right so if all these preachers won't call out Bram Tabernacle I'll call it out it's their job to call it out if they don't I'll make Jesus Christ the absolute amen I'll preach it Sister Sarah if nobody else will preach it I'll preach it sister Lydia right brother Irvin if nobody else will say it nobody else call out these these people spreading lies and worshiping brother brandom I'll call it out because I believe Jesus Christ is the absolute Hallelujah let's bow our hearts father God we thank you for tonight Lord God thank you for the patience of your people Lord it was like an hour and 26 minute sermon there Lord God bless them Lord I didn't think it'd be that long but Lord I just trust Lord that this nail was clinched Lord God that the truth was so uh securely planted in their hearts that this church will never receive false teachings that worship your servant brother Brandon and they'll never make a tape or a book an absolute when Jesus Christ is the absolute and Lord I joined brother brandom in that prayer Lord God lord may Jesus Christ become the absolute to this entire congregation even these little children Lord God Hallelujah to every adult from the youngest to the oldest may Jesus Christ be the absolute to each and every one Lord God Amen and may we take everything brother Ram said as he said may we take everything he said back to the Bible may we prove All Things by the word of God Amen Hallelujah for we know Lord God you are the only infallible one you're always the absolute you're the only absolute Hall there can be no other hallelujah thank you God for your truth Lord Jesus father let your blessings be upon this people Lord God lord knowing this was maybe one of my final times for a little bit to preach to them Lord I just wanted to lay this in there so they knew Jesus Christ was the absolute and the message is the Bible verses that God is giving us right now that God's fulfilling right now Hallelujah Grant it Lord God and in that case the message is the absolute the Bible scriptures being fulfilled today are the absolute because it's the word of God hallelujah bless your people with a simple understanding may they receive the truth of the Holy Spirit I ask it by the spirit of truth I ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said
