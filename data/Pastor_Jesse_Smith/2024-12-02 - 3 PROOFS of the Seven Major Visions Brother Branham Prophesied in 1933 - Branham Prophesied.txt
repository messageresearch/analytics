========================================
[Music] so now seem the time of of the end coming seven things I saw five of them have already come to pass greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question are there any proofs of the seven major prophecies that brother RM gave in 1933 so by God's grace we'll be happy to make a video on this hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William Marin brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 and I also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character so here's the outline for the video first we'll look at an overview of the seven major visions and then we'll give three proofs of the seven major Visions then finally we'll look at the earliest record of the Visions we'll begin with an overview of the seven major Visions I'm using the version from the church age book the exposition of the seven Church Ages was released in December 1965 and the Visions begin on page 321 of the church age book here's a visual I made years ago I just got the overview of the seven major visions of 1933 and this is a very short condensed version the first Vision was about musolini and his invasion and then death the second Vision was about Hitler his rise and death and the Sig freed line the third Vision was about fascism Nazism turning into communism and watch Russia the fourth Vision was about advances in science the fifth Vision was about the moral problem centering around women the sixth Vision was about a woman rising in power in the USA and the seventh major Vision was about the United States being bombed here's a few personal comments of mine about the overview of the seven major Visions I realized there are variations of some of the visions and their retellings brother random gave different details over the years about them so I believe the church age book is the best recollection brother random had of the seven major Visions I believe he was doing his best to remember the details brother Ram did not have tape recorders in 1933 in order to record the actual Visions we all know it's very hard for any human being to remember things that happened decades ago so we believe brother BR was doing his best to remember the seven major visions and brother Rand is not here to answer our questions nor the critics questions so we have to do the best we can by the leading of the Holy Ghost to understand the seven major Visions any honest person will admit the Visions shared on tape were after the fact the earliest recording I have of parts of of the Visions is March 1953 which we'll share a little later by God's grace and perhaps I'll do future videos on the seven major Visions going through some of these different details and variations such as Roosevelt's impact on World War II and other details if the Lord leads by God's grace now let's get into the three proofs of the seven major Visions so the first proof I believe is brother Ram's Godly Christian character that is a proof that the seven major visions are legitimate brother Ram said he had these seven major Visions in 1933 and remember friends he's a Vindicated prophet of God he has at least six thus sayi the Lord's prophecies that have come to pass here's a image of the thumbnail of a video I did about the six thus say the Lord prophecies that came to pass I also made a previous video about three Prophecies of William brandham this goes through how brother brand met the Bible requirements for being a genuine prophet of God and no other man alive today that I know of meets these require re Ms for being a genuine prophet of God certainly not Joseph brandham he doesn't meet these requirements Joseph brandham has never foretold anything in the name of the Lord but brother Ram has at least six for tellings of future events in the name of the Lord with thus sayith the Lord that have come to pass making brother brandom a genuine Vindicated Bible prophet of the Lord Jesus Christ brother Ram therefore is trustworthy and he is a legitimate genuine prophet of God and there's no person alive right now that I'm aware of that has at least one or to thus sayith the Lord prophecies that have come to pass so we're thankful God sent brother brandham as a genuine prophet of God the Elijah the forthcoming of Elijah to fulfill many Bible scriptures brother Ram was also a faithful Bible teacher he taught us true sound Bible Doctrine restoring our hearts back to the apostolic fathers according to Malachi 45 and 6 brother revealed the Seven Seals by the Holy Ghost there's 38 differences or more between brother bram's revelation of the Seven Seals versus Clarence Lin and Charles ta Russell's interpretation of the Seven Seals this vindicates brother randam as a genuine prophet of God who finished the mystery of God according to Revelation 10:7 and also revealed Secrets according to Amos 3:7 brother BR had the son of man gift of discernment in prayer lines and that's undeniable I met one person who experienced that and of course the internet's full of videos of people that were discerned by the Holy Ghost gift in brother Ram's life so we know brother ramom did have this Luke 17:30 son of man Ministry it was actually the final sign to the Gentiles before the Rapture also brother Ram is the most humble honest preacher I've ever heard and many people agree with me on that he was so humble about his mistakes his human failures but then he always magnified and gave all the glory to the Lord Jesus Christ and then ultimately on brother Ram's character it always comes down to brother Ram's character being Godly there's many people that have left the message and in all these cases it's brother Ram's word against the word of these deniers or the word of these people that have left the message and we have to remember that most of these people that have left the message most of them deny the Bible truths brother Ram revealed to us such as the revelation of the Seven Seals they deny Holiness standards like they allow their women to cut their hair they allow their women to crossdress and wear pants they allow their women to wear worldly things like makeup they add to the Bible and call God three persons that's heresy some of them not all them some of them allow tattoos some of them enjoy evil Wicked movies some of them support non-binary relationships rock and roll rap and other Wicked influences so we have to remember that most of the deniers of the seven major Visions are deniers of the Bible truths and in some cases they're lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of god let's get into the second proof here that the seven major Visions are legitimate the second proof is current events now this is my humble opinion but I believe we're currently seeing the fourth Vision fulfilled before our very eyes recently Elon Musk showed his progress on driverless Vehicles so here's a screenshot of his driverless car notice the definitive egg shape of course of the top of the vehicle and that's what brother random must have been referring to the bottom of any car will not be an egg shape it'll be the top of the car that would be the egg shape and also here's a video of the inside of this driverless car with no steering wheel just as brother Ram said and the third and final picture is the picture of the bus where you can see the chairs facing themselves brother Ram said he saw in the vision American family playing some sort of a game facing themselves in a driverless car without a steering wheel so I believe the fourth vision is in the process of coming to pass and we're seeing it happen right before our very eyes I'll make a couple more comments here I understand there are quotes from brother Brandon where he says five out of the seven Visions are fulfilled but again those quotes are not spoken with thus sayith the Lord and then there's also quotes where brother Ram says they don't have the highways yet to fulfill the fourth Vision I'll read one of those quotes it's from the voice of the sign 1964 brother Ram said such progress will take place I see automobiles looking like an egg going down the street there's cars go down the highways some kind of a control they don't have to guide it I seen an American family playing Checker in the back of a car they've got the car right now if they just had the highways to put it on so here just a year before brother Ram died he was saying they didn't have the highways yet and also regarding the fifth vision from my understanding the world hasn't seen yet the little fig leaf type apron and of course we don't want to see it as Believers because it's so and modest but I believe that fig Leaf has to be somehow a worldwide phenomenon because the first three visions were so undeniably accurate that it seems the rest of the Visions should be the same way so that's my thought on the fifth major Vision I don't believe it's fully fulfilled yet parts of it are of course and then the sixth Vision I believe this powerful woman will be the Roman Catholic church and I don't believe the Roman Catholic church has the United States under its complete power yet the seems to be connected to brother Ram's statement about the bride will be forced to stop preaching the word as he spoke in spoken word Original Seed 1962 and brother Ram cited Revelation 13:16 he said that will be the sign the squeeze is upon us is when the bride is forced to stop preaching and again remember the sixth Vision has to be undeniably fulfilled just like the first second and third Visions about musolini Hitler and the three isms are undeniably fulfilled and here's the third proof friends I believe the seven major Visions were valid and accurate by the grace of God there's a quote from 1961 in Daniel's 70 weeks brother brand references the major visions and he asked how many remember when brother Bram gave that prophecy he said look at the hands so I'll read the quote here he says that was in 1933 and I predicted that there would be some great tragedy happened to the United States before or by the year of 1977 how many members me saying that look at the hands sure so here we have a recording from 1961 28 years after the Prophecies of the seven major Visions were given in 1933 and there were still people in the congregation 27 or 28 years later that raising their hands remembering when the prophecies were given so to me that's another proof that the prophecies from 1933 were genuine they were given by the Holy Ghost to brother brandom and he was faithful to prophesy them lastly we'll look at earli recordings of the seven major Visions now the first time that I can find that brother Brandon mentions parts of the seven major Visions is in March 1953 Israel and the church Part Two Brother R says there'll be three great isms communism Fascism and Nazism they'll wind up in one ISM then he talks about automobiles they'll look like an egg and that's the way they'll be just before the Rapture so if anyone listening has an earlier audio recording I'd love to hear that perhaps I can make a part two on this so let's listen to the quote by God's grace now I said there will be three great is is isms communism fascism and um Nazism I said they'll wind up in one ISM and that one ISM will dominate the world and will burn the Vatican City you remember me saying that years and years and years ago and just exactly that way I said just before that time comes that are automobiles which is built that old straight back 20 years ago 25 years ago you can remember 20 years anyhow I said they'll look like an egg they'll be shaped that's a vision be something on to shape something like that and that's the way they'll be just before the Rapture next the first quote I found where he mentions seven major Visions was in January 1961 in Phoenix Arizona in the sermon why brother brand said seven things I saw five of them has already come to pass so again this is the first time that I found brother Rand mentioned seven Visions in particular and this also brings out the point that as brother R was trying to remember everything about the major Visions perhaps he had progressive revelation and eventually learned there was seven total visions and to me that seems very likely because brother Braham lived a lot of his life in Visions so we have to consider that a man a prophet of God seeing so many Visions every day week after week month after month year after year decade after decade it would take the Holy Spirit to bring all the details about seven major Visions to his remembrance and perhaps he grew in progressive revelation as far as understanding the exact number of visions that he had there in 1933 let's listen to the quote so that seems the time of of the end coming and five things that the Lord let seven things I saw five of has already come to pass I see a powerful woman stand up in the United States you can write this down if you so this going to happen I don't know she's on the road now exactly and she took over and then I seen in the United States just like something burned over hit it just STP blow up rocks in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God this is an excellent question so I hope this satisfies the person who asked this question in the comments this is a wonderful topic to study the Prophecies of a modern-day Prophet a genuine prophet of God the late brother William Marin brandham I look forward to getting your comments or questions or additional quotes in the comment section perhaps that'll be enough to make a part two on this topic by the grace of God friends we're living in exciting times we're seeing scripture fulfilled about Israel we're seeing the open book taken around the world according to Revelation 10 8-11 Jesus said this gospel must be preached to Every Nation then the end will come we're seeing things change here in the United States by the grace of God so we're admonished by the Lord Jesus Christ to watch and pray and always look up for our Redemption draweth nigh no man knows the day or the hour but certainly know the season of The Rapture according to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse one said but of the times and the seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night so Paul tells us we'll know the season the season will be at a time when the world is not looking for the Rapture but as 1 Thessalonians 5 goes on to say we are are children of the light we will not be caught in darkness we'll see everything we'll see all the prophetic events the light of the Gospel Jesus Christ the light of Prophecy being fulfilled we'll see it happening we won't be asleep and we'll be ready for the coming of the Lord and 1 Thessalonians 5:9 is such a great consolation for us for God hath not appointed us to wrath we will not go through the tribulation period but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ if you have any question questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
