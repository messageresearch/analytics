[0:02] the teacher is a special man he sits
[0:05] back under the anointing of the spirit
[0:08] it's able to take the words and put them
[0:10] together by the holy spirit that the
[0:12] pastor advances either one could not
[0:13] compare with
[0:15] him greetings friends in the matchless
[0:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:20] purpose of this video is to answer the
[0:21] question what is a Bible teacher in the
[0:24] fivefold ministry this video is the
[0:27] final video in a five-part series on the
[0:30] five-fold ministry spoken of by St Paul
[0:33] in Ephesians
[0:35] 4:1 by God's grace we've covered the
[0:38] pastor the Apostle the Evangelist the
[0:41] prophet and now we're looking at the
[0:43] teacher let's begin with a definition of
[0:46] the teacher the word teacher from
[0:48] Ephesians 4:11 is Greek Lexicon number
[0:52] 13:20 one who is fitted to
[0:54] teach for a deeper definition we go to
[0:57] the next Greek Lexicon number number 13
[1:00] 21 did ASCO and it means to impart
[1:04] instruction instill Doctrine into one to
[1:08] explain or expound a
[1:11] thing so this definition gives us a
[1:13] better understanding of the teacher he
[1:15] is one who imparts instruction gives
[1:18] Doctrine explains or expounds a thing
[1:22] now the word instruct also means to
[1:23] command so the teacher gives Bible
[1:26] instructions or Bible commands as we'll
[1:28] see this is very important important to
[1:30] the Lord Jesus Christ ties him perfectly
[1:32] with the Great Commission from Matthew
[1:34] 2819 and 20 let's start with two quotes
[1:38] from God's Prophet brother William Marin
[1:40] brandham about the teacher the first is
[1:42] from God doesn't call men to judgment
[1:44] without first warning him July 24th
[1:47] 1963 brother R said the teacher is a
[1:49] special man he's under the anointing of
[1:51] the spirit to put the words together by
[1:54] the holy spirit that the pastor and
[1:56] evangelist cannot compare with so having
[1:58] the single gift to teach is different
[2:00] than a pastoring gift a teacher doesn't
[2:03] have the pastoring anointing needed to
[2:06] feed the flock counsel the flock and as
[2:08] Paul said take care of the Church of God
[2:10] in 1 Timothy
[2:12] 3:5 if you remember the pastor video
[2:15] brother Bram said the Pastor is able to
[2:16] sit down with two individuals that may
[2:19] have a disagreement and bring them back
[2:21] into fellowship and obviously the pastor
[2:23] gift is a more frequent Ministry where
[2:25] the pastor is feeding the flock of God
[2:26] multiple times a week but as we'll see
[2:28] the pastor can have a gift to teach as
[2:31] well let's listen to the quote the
[2:34] teacher is a special man he sits back
[2:37] under the anointing of the spirit it's
[2:39] able to take the words and put them
[2:41] together by the holy spirit that the
[2:43] pastor evangelist either one could not
[2:44] compare with him but you see in the
[2:47] church there is a pastor and that Pastor
[2:51] is a special person he's built to where
[2:54] he can uh he can put up with the fussing
[2:57] of the people he he is a bird bur
[3:00] barrier he's the ox of the team he he's
[3:04] a man that can sit down when the
[3:06] somebody's got something against
[3:08] somebody else and sit down with them two
[3:10] families and take either side and reason
[3:12] it out and bring it right back into
[3:14] sweetness he he's a pastor he knows how
[3:18] to take care of things the second quote
[3:20] is from Ephesians parallels Joshua 1960
[3:23] brother Bram said Bible teaching is a
[3:25] little treacherous you know and then he
[3:27] differentiates teaching and preaching he
[3:29] said preach teach ing catches The Sinner
[3:31] brings him under condemnation by the
[3:33] word or conviction by the word but
[3:35] teaching places a man positionally where
[3:38] he is then he's rightly able to have
[3:40] faith if he's been taught the word of
[3:42] God correctly let's listen to the quote
[3:45] Bible teaching is usually a little
[3:48] treacherous a little you know kind of
[3:51] walking out on the thin ice we call it
[3:55] but we just feel that maybe at this ha
[4:00] and at this time it might be good to
[4:03] kind of bring the the church to what I
[4:07] think to a a
[4:10] complete uh understanding positionally
[4:14] of what we are in Christ Jesus amen and
[4:19] sometimes I think that preaching is a
[4:22] wonderful thing but I believe sometimes
[4:25] brother beer that teaching goes beyond
[4:29] that amen and kindly especially to the
[4:32] church now preaching usually catches The
[4:36] Sinner brings him under condemnation by
[4:39] the word but teaching places the man
[4:44] positionally what he
[4:46] is and we can never rightly be able to
[4:52] have faith until positionally we know
[4:56] what we
[4:57] are now let's look at a section of I'm
[4:59] calling importance of teaching let's
[5:02] start with Matthew 28:19 and 20 Jesus
[5:04] gives the Great Commission and said he's
[5:06] always with us as we teach others to
[5:09] obey all the commands of God so Matthew
[5:12] 28:19 Jesus said go ye therefore and
[5:14] teach All Nations so teaching must be
[5:17] part of the Great Commission it can't
[5:19] just be preaching or declaring God's
[5:21] Great Tidings but it must be teaching
[5:23] them giving commands giving Doctrine
[5:26] then he repeats it again in verse 20
[5:28] teaching them to observe all things
[5:29] things whatsoever I have commanded you
[5:31] and lo I'm with you always even unto the
[5:34] end of the world how long does it take
[5:36] Christians to observe all the commands
[5:39] well it takes an entire lifetime so this
[5:41] means we'll need Godly teachers during
[5:43] the entire lifetimes of the Believers
[5:46] and thank God we have them by the grace
[5:47] of God so we see Jesus Christ puts a
[5:51] major emphasis on preaching and teaching
[5:54] as a major important part of the
[5:56] Fulfillment of the Great Commission next
[5:59] in Matthew 5 5:19 Jesus said whosoever
[6:01] therefore shall break one of these least
[6:03] Commandments and shall teach men so he
[6:06] shall be called the least in the kingdom
[6:07] of God but whosoever shall do and teach
[6:10] them the same Shall be Called great in
[6:12] the kingdom of God so notice it's very
[6:15] important for teachers to live what
[6:17] they're teaching if they live what they
[6:19] teach they'll be called great in the
[6:21] kingdom of God that's a future reward it
[6:24] should not be a reward teachers receive
[6:26] during their lifetimes because God's
[6:28] Prophet brother brandom told us to never
[6:30] call each other great he said this in
[6:32] trying to do God's service without being
[6:34] his will
[6:35] 1965 he said sometimes great guys get
[6:39] together and they talk about each other
[6:40] saying great so and so brother Ram said
[6:42] don't never do that there's no great
[6:45] ones among us because God is the model
[6:48] of humility he came down from the ivory
[6:50] palaces of Glory to become one of us now
[6:53] who is the big one let's listen to the
[6:55] quote sometimes great guys get together
[6:58] you hear him say great so and so great
[7:00] so and so our great don't never do that
[7:04] there's no great ones Among Us there's
[7:06] only one great one and that's God we are
[7:10] brothers sisters I don't care if you're
[7:13] a pastor or church got five people in it
[7:15] that don't make you
[7:17] little that makes you a
[7:19] brother see if you're true to God's word
[7:22] don't care what how you don't get little
[7:25] God don't have little children and big
[7:26] children he just has children they're
[7:29] all the
[7:31] same notice God himself come from the
[7:36] ivory palaces of Glory to become one of
[7:38] us now who's the big one to not come
[7:42] down here take the form of a priest but
[7:44] a
[7:45] servant wash the very clay that he
[7:48] created the feet of his Apostles and
[7:51] other now who's great now in this next
[7:54] section I'm going to call it teachers in
[7:56] the New Testament you can see how
[7:57] they're differentiated from pastors
[7:59] prophets evangelists and the other four
[8:02] gifts of the five-fold ministry in Acts
[8:04] 13: 1-4 in Antioch there were certain
[8:08] prophets and teachers who came together
[8:11] to fast and pray and minister to the
[8:13] Lord and that's when the Holy Ghost said
[8:15] separate me Paul and Barnabas so it's
[8:18] interesting I don't know why they call
[8:19] it just prophets and teachers perhaps
[8:21] the pastors were busy feeding their
[8:22] flocks and couldn't come and fast and
[8:24] pray I don't know but just prophets and
[8:27] teachers came to fast and pray and God
[8:29] gave Paul and Barnabas thus sayith the
[8:31] Holy Ghost so the early church
[8:33] identified prophets and teachers and of
[8:35] course pastors and evangelists and
[8:37] apostles acts 13 is the sending forth of
[8:39] Apostles so we should be able to
[8:41] recognize them today because Jesus
[8:43] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[8:44] forever next in 1 Corinthians 12:28 and
[8:48] 19 Paul told the Corinthians God hath
[8:51] set someon the church first apostles
[8:53] secondarily prophets thirdly teachers
[8:56] then he said are all Apostles are all
[8:58] prophets are all teachers are all
[8:59] workers of Miracles and of course the
[9:01] answer is no everyone has their
[9:03] individual gift and we must be faithful
[9:05] with the gifts God has given to us the
[9:07] next verse is 1 Timothy 3:2 Paul says a
[9:10] bishop which in this case is overseer
[9:12] which must be a pastor or Shepherd must
[9:14] then be blameless the husband of one
[9:16] wife Vigilant sober of good behavior
[9:18] given to hospitality apt to teach the
[9:22] word apt in the Greek means skillful in
[9:24] teaching so a pastor has to be able to
[9:27] teach as well of course because because
[9:29] he's feeding the flock of God like we
[9:31] said multiple times a week and remember
[9:34] pastors can have multiple Gifts of
[9:35] preaching just like St Paul had all the
[9:38] five preaching gifts I made a video
[9:39] recently how brother brandom had all the
[9:41] five preaching gifts and God would use
[9:43] them at different times and seasons of
[9:45] his life but R said Martin Luther even
[9:47] had all nine gifts of the holy spirit so
[9:50] on top of the preaching gifts Martin
[9:51] Luther may have had he also had all nine
[9:54] gifts of the holy spirit which is quite
[9:56] a great responsibility but he'll be
[9:58] rewarded much because was faithful with
[10:00] those gifts by the grace of God the next
[10:03] section I want to call this both
[10:05] preaching and teaching needed by Jesus
[10:07] and
[10:09] Paul so in Jesus's Earthly Ministry and
[10:12] the ministry of all the apostles in the
[10:14] book of Acts they always had both
[10:16] preaching and teaching it wasn't just
[10:18] preaching it was teaching as well
[10:20] Matthew 4:23 Jesus went all about
[10:23] Galilee teaching in their synagogues and
[10:26] preaching the gospel of the kingdom and
[10:28] healing all manner of sickness and all
[10:30] manner of disease among the people so
[10:32] Jesus both taught and preached and again
[10:36] the difference is teach is to give
[10:37] commands to give Doctrine instruction
[10:40] preach is to declare to publish truth so
[10:45] I'll give some examples in just a moment
[10:46] but the same idea about Jesus ministry
[10:49] is repeated in Matthew 9:35 preaching
[10:52] and teaching and Matthew
[10:54] 11:1 preaching and teaching Jesus did
[10:57] both preaching and teaching Matthew 5:42
[11:00] and daily in the temple and in every
[11:02] house they cease not to teach and preach
[11:05] Jesus Christ we must have both we must
[11:08] preach Jesus Christ we must teach Jesus
[11:10] Christ then next acts 15:35 Paul also
[11:14] and Barnabas continued in Antioch
[11:16] teaching and preaching the word of the
[11:17] Lord with many others so Paul brother
[11:21] ramam said was the greatest missionary
[11:22] outside of Jesus Christ he did both
[11:24] teaching and preaching of course we know
[11:26] Paul said he was also a teacher of the
[11:28] Gentiles that was in 1 Timothy
[11:31] 2:7 here's some simple examples of the
[11:33] difference between preaching and
[11:35] teaching I have three examples the first
[11:37] example is preaching or declaring is God
[11:39] hears our prayers see that's publishing
[11:42] good news that's encouraging God hears
[11:44] your prayers now teaching would be
[11:46] different it'd be using Jesus's prayer
[11:48] and other prayers to explain how to pray
[11:51] when to pray explaining or expounding
[11:54] giving commands on prayer second example
[11:57] of preaching would be the seven seals
[11:59] are revealed that's a great declaration
[12:02] that's great news being published as
[12:04] preachers are preaching but the
[12:06] difference is with teaching when you go
[12:08] to teaching on the Seven Seals you're
[12:10] explaining the symbols and their
[12:12] meanings expounding on them going verse
[12:15] by verse in fact there's numerous quotes
[12:17] from God's Prophet brother Brandon where
[12:18] he talked about he was teaching on the
[12:20] Seven Seals through the revelation of
[12:22] the Holy Ghost the angels of God
[12:24] visiting him for seven days straight to
[12:27] reveal the revelation of the Seven Seals
[12:29] how did he present it to us did he
[12:31] preach it or did he teach it he said he
[12:33] was teaching on the Seven Seals and I'm
[12:35] sure there was times in the sermons
[12:37] where he was preaching or just declaring
[12:38] truths as well but when he was
[12:40] explaining the symbols and giving
[12:42] commands about how to live a Christian
[12:43] Life that was teaching and the third and
[12:46] final example I hear this one often is
[12:48] God is the Healer God's present now to
[12:50] heal Jesus wants to heal that's all good
[12:53] preaching we need that that's preaching
[12:55] but teaching is different teaching
[12:57] explains we must confess our sins first
[13:00] and find the will of God first and then
[13:03] even give thanks to God for God's will
[13:06] whether he heals us or not so teaching
[13:09] will give commands on how a person will
[13:11] go about being healed you might first
[13:14] have to go confess your sins or you
[13:15] might have to first be Anointed with oil
[13:17] or you might have to first let people
[13:19] lay hands on you or you might have to
[13:21] wait numerous years for your healing but
[13:23] teaching will explain those different
[13:26] Avenues of God's healing power
[13:29] in the next section we look at Doctrine
[13:31] or teaching is like refreshing do
[13:34] according to God so think of a morning
[13:36] when you walk out in the grass or in a
[13:39] park and there's DW on the grass that is
[13:42] what God Likens his teaching unto a
[13:44] refreshing du this is found in
[13:46] Deuteronomy 321 and2 God says in verse
[13:50] two my Doctrine shall drop as the rain
[13:53] my speech shall distill as the do so I
[13:56] love this God says when God teaches when
[13:59] God gives Doctrine and instruction and
[14:01] commands it's like rain from Heaven it's
[14:04] refreshing and God's speech God's
[14:07] Doctrine is as the do so notice
[14:10] according to thus saith the Bible
[14:12] Doctrine and teaching is like rain and
[14:15] do Reign and do is required for Life
[14:18] required for growth required for
[14:20] refreshment and our lives require the
[14:23] refreshing teaching of God's word I'm
[14:26] just going to add something in here I've
[14:27] noticed among the goat preachers I call
[14:30] them they are constantly attacking
[14:32] teaching and Doctrine they have a saying
[14:35] that kind of goes like this Jesus isn't
[14:37] a Doctrine and I agree Jesus is not a
[14:40] Doctrine but if Jesus ever gives you a
[14:43] command or if Jesus ever tells you to do
[14:45] something then Jesus has given you a
[14:48] Doctrine because that's what Doctrine
[14:49] means instruction commands and we see
[14:52] Jesus all the time giving commands
[14:54] teaching giving instruction for his
[14:57] Believers to follow and he said said
[14:59] they must observe his teachings in all
[15:01] the areas of their life they must
[15:03] observe all the teaching all the
[15:05] instruction so I believe the goat group
[15:07] here is exalting experiences above the
[15:10] word and we should never do that we need
[15:13] both the word and we need experiences
[15:15] notice what brother Ram said about Moses
[15:17] since Deuteronomy 32 is referring to
[15:19] Moses brother Ram said what was the
[15:21] difference between balam and Moses the
[15:23] difference was Moses's teaching was
[15:26] perfect from the anointed ones of the
[15:28] end time 19 65 let's listen to the quote
[15:32] bam Anointed with the same spirit that
[15:36] was up on
[15:39] Moses what was the
[15:42] difference the teaching of Moses was
[15:45] perfect the Bible said here in second
[15:47] Peter that it was a teaching of balum
[15:50] that Israel received that God never did
[15:56] forgive unpardonable sins
[16:00] now let's look at Joel
[16:01] 2:23 brother Ram said this is thus
[16:04] sayith the Lord for the bride referring
[16:06] to rapturing Faith he said that in the
[16:08] church age book but what about the true
[16:11] seed it will happen just as we have said
[16:14] the people of God are being made ready
[16:16] by the word of truth from the messenger
[16:18] to this age in her will be the fullness
[16:21] of Pentecost for the spirit will bring
[16:23] the people right back to where they were
[16:25] at the beginning that is thus saith the
[16:28] Lord
[16:30] it is thus saith the Lord for that is
[16:33] what Joel 2
[16:34] 23-26 says I'm going to jump ahead in
[16:37] the verse but it says for he hath given
[16:39] you the former rain moderately he will
[16:41] cause to come down for you the rain the
[16:43] former rain and the latter rain in the
[16:46] first month it seems people fail to
[16:49] remember that brother Ram said the
[16:50] latter rain is rapturing Faith which
[16:53] hasn't fallen yet because we haven't
[16:54] been raptured and then they forget
[16:56] brother BR said the former Reign was his
[16:58] is Teaching Ministry so again these goat
[17:01] preachers are bashing teaching bashing
[17:04] Doctrine but yet that was the whole
[17:06] point of brother Ram's Ministry was to
[17:09] teach the people the apostolic faith to
[17:11] turn their hearts back to the apostolic
[17:13] fathers so they would observe all of
[17:15] Jesus's
[17:16] commands what seemed to be the answer
[17:18] came as many began to speak in tongues
[17:21] and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was
[17:23] then believed that this was indeed the
[17:25] long awaited
[17:27] restoration it was not for the latter
[17:29] rain can come only after the former rign
[17:31] which is the spring or teaching rain the
[17:34] latter rain then is the Harvest rain how
[17:37] could this be the real thing when the
[17:39] teaching Reign had not come the prophet
[17:42] messenger who was to be sent to teach
[17:44] the people and turned the hearts of the
[17:46] children back to the Pentecostal fathers
[17:48] had not yet come thus what was thought
[17:51] to be the restoration and the final
[17:53] quickening onto the Rapture had not come
[17:55] so some of these goat preachers don't
[17:57] even know they're bashing the former
[17:58] rain they're in a very sad condition so
[18:01] we continue to pray for them by God's
[18:02] grace brother Ram said this in a resume
[18:04] of the church ages chapter 10 in the
[18:06] church age book he's talking about the
[18:08] anointing that fell at isua Street they
[18:10] thought it was latter rain they thought
[18:12] it was the long awaited restoration but
[18:15] brother Ram said it was not because the
[18:17] latter rain can only come after the
[18:19] former rain he says the latter rain then
[18:21] is the Harvest rain how could this be
[18:23] the real thing when the teaching Reign
[18:25] had not come so brother bam calls former
[18:28] Reign teaching Reign and that's what the
[18:29] word former means in Hebrew teaching the
[18:32] prophet messenger who was to be sent to
[18:34] teach the people and turn the hearts of
[18:37] the children back to the Pentecostal
[18:39] fathers had not yet come so brother
[18:41] Ram's Ministry is called a Teaching
[18:43] Ministry according to the Holy Ghost
[18:45] through brother brandham so again it's
[18:47] sad these goat preachers and other ones
[18:48] are saying they don't need the doctrine
[18:51] or they're saying they don't need the
[18:52] teaching Reign and this is sad because
[18:55] that means they'll drift into Pride
[18:57] complexes and also other false doctrin
[18:59] such as God always wants to heal which
[19:02] means you don't have to find the will of
[19:04] God for healing and I've already
[19:06] witnessed I have videos of these
[19:08] mistakes people have made I've already
[19:10] witnessed numerous of these false
[19:12] predictions from preachers in the goat
[19:14] group they publicly claim someone's
[19:16] going to be healed but then the
[19:17] individual dies and it becomes a sad
[19:20] disgrace and it causes confusion to the
[19:22] Believers how can these famous preachers
[19:24] say God's going to heal them and then
[19:26] God doesn't heal them it almost looks
[19:28] like like a false prophecy but of course
[19:30] the preachers aren't saying thus sayith
[19:32] the Lord in the name of the Lord but it
[19:34] just brings confusion upon people who
[19:36] believe these men to be men of God they
[19:39] speak so boldly and publicly but then
[19:41] their predictions fail to come to pass
[19:43] so this is why it's so important to have
[19:45] teaching of the word of God teaching on
[19:47] Divine Healing so that we know we must
[19:49] find the will of God first before
[19:51] publicly declaring God's going to heal a
[19:53] person here's another quote I always
[19:55] like to share by God's grace the four
[19:57] seal 1963 brother Ram said the
[20:00] Antichrist refuses the true bride
[20:02] Doctrine so there is Doctrine for the
[20:04] true bride of Jesus Christ it's the
[20:06] instruction from the Bible it's all the
[20:08] Bible commands Jesus said his teachers
[20:11] are to help the Believers observe
[20:13] according to again Matthew 28 19 and 20
[20:16] let's listen to the quote the Antichrist
[20:19] refuses the true
[20:22] bride Doctrine and therefore he takes
[20:25] his own bride out and builds her up
[20:28] under a Creed of his
[20:32] own takes his own bride and makes her a
[20:36] denomination she gives birth to other
[20:40] denominations as quoted in this Holy
[20:43] Scripture gives birth to
[20:46] daughters and
[20:49] um she don't she becomes just like her
[20:53] mother natural worldly
[20:57] denomination a oing the spiritual bride
[21:00] the
[21:01] word and next friends here's a very
[21:03] important scripture 2 John 1 8-11 John
[21:07] said whoever abideth not in the doctrine
[21:09] of Christ hath not God so just meditate
[21:13] on that scripture if you would for a
[21:15] moment he that abideth in the doctrine
[21:17] of Christ he hath both the father and
[21:20] son so whoever abides or stays with the
[21:23] true teaching the true doctrine of
[21:25] Christ that proves they're born again if
[21:27] they don't stay with the true teaching
[21:28] of Christ that proves they're not born
[21:30] again they don't have the Father the
[21:32] invisible Spirit or his son the high
[21:34] priest the Lord Jesus Christ then Paul
[21:36] says if any come and bring not this
[21:38] Doctrine do not receive him in his house
[21:41] neither bid him godp
[21:43] speed in this final section I'm going to
[21:45] look at other important quotes from
[21:47] God's Prophet brother brandham let's
[21:49] look at some quotes where brother Bram
[21:50] said the Seven Seals Revelation was part
[21:53] of his third poll or new commission and
[21:56] it was teaching so the opening of the
[21:58] word can also be the teaching of the
[22:00] word brother Ram said the revelation of
[22:03] Seven Seals was a new commission so
[22:06] we'll play that quote then we'll look at
[22:08] a guide from October 14th 1962 brother
[22:13] Ram said we want to go to them last
[22:15] seven last seals to teach that and then
[22:19] he said in God hiding him himself in
[22:20] simplicity at the beginning of the Seven
[22:22] Seals series he said that we might study
[22:25] in this before we go into the great
[22:27] teachings of the Seven Seals and then in
[22:30] the second seal brother random said last
[22:33] evening as we always like in the
[22:35] teaching on the seals teach it in the
[22:37] same way you do on the church ages
[22:40] brother R said he taught the Seven Seals
[22:42] the same way he taught the church ages
[22:44] so now we know the church Ages were
[22:46] teaching sermons so were the seven seal
[22:49] sermons backing up to 1961 the true
[22:51] Easter seal brother brandom again said
[22:53] he taught the church ages he said we
[22:56] found out in our teaching when we taught
[22:58] the church ages let's listen to those
[23:01] quotes and then it come to me not a
[23:03] voice just come to me
[23:06] oh that is the angels of the Lord coming
[23:11] to give me my new
[23:14] commission and when I thought
[23:17] that I raised up my hands and I said oh
[23:21] Lord Jesus what will you have me
[23:24] do and the vision left me
[23:29] for almost an hour I couldn't
[23:32] feeli and now the next time as far as I
[23:36] know to be with you will be after the
[23:38] church is completed and I want to then
[23:41] after the church ages that we want to go
[23:44] down to the seven uh last
[23:48] seals and um the seven last seals in the
[23:52] Book of Revelations to teach
[23:55] that I thought it made a a text that we
[23:58] might study this before we go into the
[24:02] the the great teachings of the Seven
[24:06] Seals many miss him by the way he
[24:09] reveals
[24:13] himself
[24:15] now last evening as we always like in
[24:18] teaching on the U on the seals we had
[24:21] teach it the same way you do on the on
[24:25] the U the church ages and uh when we got
[24:29] finished with teaching the church age
[24:32] the last time when I draw them out here
[24:35] on the on the pulpit on a board how many
[24:39] remembers what took
[24:40] place he came right down went right back
[24:43] on the wall and a light and dra it off
[24:45] himself right on the wall before Sol the
[24:47] angel of the Lord stood right here
[24:49] before several hundred people and now uh
[24:53] he's he's doing something real
[24:55] Supernatural now too and so we're just
[24:59] expecting great things we don't
[25:02] know and first thing you know in the
[25:04] Bible we found out in our teaching when
[25:05] we taught the church ages that Jesus
[25:07] told him before it happened about 200
[25:10] years that there'd be a Doctrine or
[25:12] first it would be a Deeds of the nicadan
[25:14] and then finally become a Doctrine and
[25:16] when it did that he said I hate it and
[25:18] what did the Pentecostal do the
[25:20] Pentecostal up and up
[25:22] starchy class organized and made the
[25:25] Catholic Church the first mother organ
[25:28] organization the little minority was
[25:30] forced off to one
[25:32] side here's another quote from 1954 the
[25:35] seven Church ages brother Ram said he
[25:37] remembered staying a year and 6 months
[25:40] in the Book of Revelation in the
[25:43] Tabernacle that's what I like in
[25:45] teaching I just love teaching oh my I
[25:47] think it's wonderful it gives the basis
[25:49] and settles the Church of course brother
[25:51] R would think teaching is wonderful he
[25:53] just loves it he just loves the rain he
[25:55] just loves the dew falling from heaven
[25:58] and brother R again differentiates
[25:59] preaching from teaching their different
[26:01] Ministries brother Ram said preaching
[26:04] Waters the seeds that the teacher has
[26:06] taught and then he says there's a great
[26:08] vast difference between a teacher and
[26:11] preacher let's listen to the quote I
[26:13] remember saying a year and six months in
[26:16] This Book of
[26:17] Revelation and and the Tabernacle here
[26:20] that's what I like and and teaching I
[26:25] just love teaching oh my
[26:28] uh I I think it's wonderful it gives the
[26:31] bases and settles the
[26:33] church and preaching now there's some
[26:37] people that are preachers they can pick
[26:39] up the word with inspiration and sway it
[26:41] out there in places that's watering the
[26:44] seeds that the teacher has taught see
[26:46] now you got put some seed in first and
[26:49] then water and the watering comes from
[26:52] the preaching of the word there's a
[26:55] great vast difference between a teacher
[26:58] and a preacher see it's two different
[27:01] gifts of the Spirit all together two
[27:04] different gifts and I humbly say this
[27:08] but I haven't the gift of either but
[27:11] mine as usual is praying for the sake
[27:15] that's what the Lord called me to
[27:18] do the last quote I want to play is from
[27:20] the rejected King 1960 brother Ram
[27:22] telling brother Ram is telling about his
[27:24] experience going beyond the curtain of
[27:25] time it's the first time he told about
[27:27] this experience if I'm not mistaken and
[27:29] he said the multitudes beyond the
[27:30] curtain of time told Brother brandham
[27:32] they would go into the higher Realm Of
[27:34] Heaven where Jesus was in other words
[27:36] the seventh Dimension or we might say
[27:38] the third heaven because of his teaching
[27:41] the people said you were sent for a
[27:43] leader and God will come when he does
[27:45] he'll judge you according to what you
[27:47] taught them first whether they go in or
[27:49] not will go in according to your
[27:51] teaching think about that we go into the
[27:54] presence of Jesus Christ because of the
[27:56] Bible teaching the Bible commands the
[27:58] Bible doctrines that the former Reign
[28:01] Ministry gave us and then he gives
[28:03] examples he preached every word Peter
[28:05] and Paul preached he baptized in the
[28:07] name of Jesus Christ he taught the
[28:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's
[28:11] when all the people were screaming out
[28:13] we know that and we know we're going
[28:15] with you someday back to the Earth and
[28:17] is this scriptural yes this is
[28:18] scriptural do we go in according to our
[28:21] teaching yes of course it's repentance
[28:23] that we hear from the teaching and then
[28:25] we have faith in the blood of Jesus
[28:26] Christ but it's first Timothy tothy 4:16
[28:29] take heed unto thyself and unto the
[28:31] doctrine continue in them for in doing
[28:34] this Thou shalt both save thyself and
[28:37] them that hear thee Paul told Timothy
[28:40] he'll be saved if he obeys the teaching
[28:43] and his listeners will be saved if they
[28:45] obey the teaching just like the
[28:47] multitudes beyond the curtain of time
[28:49] shared with brother brandom let's listen
[28:51] to the quote they said now he's just a
[28:54] little higher right up that way said
[28:58] someday he will come to you see said you
[29:01] were sent for a
[29:03] leader and God will come and when he
[29:06] does he'll judge you according to what
[29:08] you taught
[29:10] them first whether they go in or
[29:13] not we'll go in according to your
[29:17] teaching I said oh I'm so
[29:21] glad if Paul does he have to stand like
[29:24] this does Peter have to stand like this
[29:27] yes I said then I preached every word
[29:31] that they preached I never did it from
[29:33] it one side to the
[29:36] other were they baptized in the name of
[29:38] Jesus Christ I did too were they taught
[29:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I did too
[29:43] whatever they thought I did too and then
[29:46] people scream and said we know that and
[29:49] we know we are going with you someday
[29:51] back to Earth said Jesus will come and
[29:55] you'll be judged according to the word
[29:57] that you preached this and then if you
[30:01] are accepted at that time which you will
[30:03] be and said then you will present us to
[30:07] him as your trophies of your
[30:10] ministry said you will guide us to him
[30:14] and all together we'll go back to the
[30:17] Earth to live
[30:19] forever in closing friends I hope this
[30:23] video was a blessing by the grace of God
[30:24] now we have a complete series on the
[30:26] five full ministry I trust God will use
[30:28] it to help strengthen the Saints by the
[30:31] grace of God remember God will use this
[30:33] five full ministry until we all come in
[30:35] the unity of the faith that means he's
[30:36] going to use the fivefold ministry until
[30:38] we're
[30:39] raptured remember what it's for it's for
[30:41] the perfecting of the Saints the
[30:43] maturation of the Saints for the work of
[30:46] the ministry and for the edifying of the
[30:49] body of Christ so I hope this Series has
[30:52] helped you mature I hope it has shown
[30:54] you the work of the ministry and if
[30:56] you're a part of that whether a preacher
[30:58] or supporting it through prayer fasting
[31:00] giving of tithes and offerings and I
[31:02] hope you've been edified as part of the
[31:04] body of Christ thank God the true
[31:06] five-fold Ministry is Jesus's gift to
[31:09] the church according to Ephesians 4:8 he
[31:12] ascended high in Heaven Led captivity
[31:16] captive and then he gave gifts unto men
[31:19] and these are the gifts he gave unto men
[31:21] to lead and Shepherd the flock of Jesus
[31:24] Christ the five-fold preaching gifts and
[31:27] you'll know when you're under the five
[31:28] full ministry correctly because you
[31:30] won't be tossed back and forth on every
[31:31] wind of Doctrine as Ephesians 4:14 says
[31:36] and you'll speak the truth and love
[31:37] growing up into him in all things which
[31:40] is the head even Christ Ephesians
[31:43] 4:15 please remember to always pray for
[31:45] the ministers in the five full ministry
[31:48] they're men they're susceptible to
[31:50] mistakes they need our prayers but God
[31:53] is faithful God will hear your prayers
[31:55] and all the promises in Ephesians 4 and
[31:58] the rest of the Bible regarding the
[31:59] fivefold ministry will be fulfilled by
[32:01] the spirit of the Lord for it's not by
[32:03] might not by power but by my spirit
[32:05] sayith the Lord if you have any
[32:07] questions concerns or testimonies about
[32:09] this video please contact
[32:11] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[32:14] the desire of your heart
