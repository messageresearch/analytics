TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and notice the Bible said here they eat and they drink of course with their pretty women now when you realize that that's all right eating and drinking that's one of the natural laws of life we have to do it but when that's all upon your mind the day the people just become gluttons drunk women drinking in the restaurants and you go into a place where the the high balls and Cocktails are sered the women I've drink the man Jesus said as it was the days of Noah they were eating and drinking and giving in marriage in other words they were living with the women without being married to them amen and today while it's so instituted they did have a Reno that you could get married and divorced and married again all the same day but that's way out of date now the the husband soal and wives pack different keys to their rooms in these big cities now I travel I'm right in the cities and know it to be true that the husband has his dates and the wife has her dates oh it's such a conglomeration of of rotness until it's produced a bunch of of soft lazy no good am uh Hellbound gener these episodes has been on the earth since the days of Noah we find out when God had Noah the prophet of righteousness going forth with his message there was an episode of immorality in that day as the Bible said eating drinking marrying giving in marriage we find out gluttonous and immorality and so forth taking place in that day and then the world fell apart because the people rejected the message of God for that day Noah was a prophet anointed of God sent of God with a message from God and he gave the people a warning before the Judgment come and they sniggered and laughed and made fun of it and scoffed and the whole world system fell apart and that day and is drowned beneath the Seas right why they rejected the message of the hour now after the same manner also 25th verse after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as off as you drink it in remembrance of me for as off remember now far as off as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh forth the Lord's death till he comes how long until he come am wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord let me stop just a minute the reason he said this you notice in another verse here another chapter that he said I understand when you when you come together you're eating even getting drunk at the Lord's table they misunderstood it you see they just glutted in see just like people are doing today just live any kind of life and take it see he said you got homes to eat in see but this is an ordinance that we should keep seeing now not not only that but man they have to set the time up so they can get out and play golf or something like that take a little exercise get some of the fat off of them what a Pity the rest of the world starving to death you think we're not going to receive damnation for these things sure we will I've left the Nations and poor little children ringing their hands in their eyes and crying their little dirty faces like that crying for a piece of bread in America some sometimes in the afternoon a midafternoon A8 plate and half of it red off in a garbage can to feed you a hog it's not right and brother the time's coming when God will make us pay for those things too now that's a wonderful thing but yet in having that many times the people stray away and they make an idol out of the very thing that God has ordained do you believe that look at the serpent the brass serpent in the wilderness did you know the prophet had to tear that serpent to Pieces why because the people are worshiping The Serpent and they made an idol out of it do you believe you can do that today you can make an idol out of your church you can make an idol out of your pastor you can make an ID lot of an evangelist and I'm afraid that that's what a whole lot of it's being done they idolize the man
