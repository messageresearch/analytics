Description:
Part 2 of this series covers "What is the Rapture?" and "Who is the Rapture For?" with complete Bible support. In "What is the Rapture?", Scripture teaches that this rapture event is like a wedding ceremony. It is the unknown day and hour when Jesus' physical body comes down from heaven, stops in the clouds, and calls His wife or bride to meet him in the air. Jesus first resurrects the dead in Christ. Then Jesus changes the bodies of the living, Holy Ghost-filled Christians so both the dead and living Christians can meet Christ in the air. Jesus then takes those believers, His bride or wife, to the wedding supper or marriage reception in the Father's Kingdom. 

In "Who is the Rapture For?", we learn that Scripture teaches the rapture is only for the Holy Ghost-filled Christians - dead or currently living - who have loved and faithfully served Christ. The rapture is like a wedding ceremony, as taught by Jesus in two parables from Matthew 22:1-14 and Matthew 25:1-13. In both parables, there were requirements to be a part of the wedding of God's Son - a wedding garment in the former, and oil in the latter, which are both symbols of the baptism of the Holy Ghost.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what is the rapture the rapture is the secret and unknown day an hour when Jesus's physical body comes down from heaven stops in the clouds and then resurrects all the dead Christians first with his voice the Bible says the dead in Christ resurrect first the Christians who died during the last 2,000 years of church ages then Christ changes the bodies of the living Holy Ghost fill Christians into incorruptible bodies at the last Trump so that both the dead in Christ and living Christians can ascend into the sky and be caught up together in the clouds to meet Jesus in the air the Greek word for caught up means to seize carry off by force to seize on claim for oneself eagerly to snatch out or away at the rapture Jesus ceases or snatches away his bride his wife and then takes these Christians to heaven or the father's Kingdom with him for a wedding or marriage supper while the inhabitants of the earth are being judged and tormented for their sins and rejection of the gospel during the Great Tribulation Period who is the rapture for the rapture is only for Jesus Christ's bride or wife those Holy Ghost fil Christians who have loved and faithfully served Jesus Christ over the past 2,000 years including the dead and those believers currently living the rapture is a meeting in the air of the Holy Ghost filled saints and is the physical union of Christ corporal body and his bride or church in other words the rapture is like the physical wedding ceremony where the physical bodies of the bride and groom are United after the rapture Jesus will then take his wife to the marriage supper of the Lamb according to revelation 19 7 through 9 which is likened unto a wedding reception in today's culture that immediately follows the wedding ceremony but in order to be a part of the rapture the physical union or wedding ceremony with Christ you must first be united to Christ by an invisible union which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost when a person is by the baptism of the holy ghost the believer is sealed unto the day of his Redemption according to Ephesians 4:30 and will always be a part of the body of Christ this invisible union or baptism of the Holy Ghost can be likened unto the engagement or a spousal act of an earthly couple today scripture clearly teaches of this invisible union as Romans 7 verse 4 says that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God st. Paul further supports this truth in 2nd Corinthians 11 verse 2 saying frybo spouse or engaged you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ so we strongly urge you and admonish you to be sure you are born again baptized with the Holy Ghost that you may be a part of Jesus's bride with the evidence that Jesus said every true believer would have being led into all truth by the Holy Ghost according to John 16:13 please see our video the evidence of the Holy Ghost according to Jesus for more teaching on this major doctrine this truth of Holy Ghost filled believers as the brighter wife of Christ is plainly taught in Scripture beginning in Ephesians 5 verses 22 to 32 which tells us that a husband and wife are symbolic of Christ and the church John the Baptist called Jesus the bridegroom in John 329th in revelation 19 verses 7 through 9 tells us that Jesus's marriage is coming and his wife hath made herself ready revelation 19 verse 8 speaks of Jesus's wife or the true church being arrayed in fine linen clean and white which is the righteousness of saints this righteousness is that of Christ and not of our own through his washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost according to Titus 3 verse 5 this symbolism of the bride having specific clothing or garments was also taught by Jesus in his parable in Matthew 22 verses 1 to 14 Jesus taught the kingdom of heaven was like a king which made a marriage for his son when the king came in to see the guests gathered for the wedding he found a man that did to have the wedding garment the man without the garment was bound and cast into outer darkness where there was weeping gnashing of teeth which reminds us of Jesus's other words that the garment of true believers is the power of the Holy Ghost jesus told His disciples to tarry in Jerusalem until they were endued or clothed with power from on high according to Luke 24 verse 49 meaning that once they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost which was recorded in acts 2 verse 4 they would have spiritual clothing or power to be true witnesses for Christ this teaches that all those without the powerful clothing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost will not be a part of the wedding of Jesus Christ Jesus told a second parable that taught that the rapture or his wedding would only be for Holy Ghost fill Christians Jesus called the raptured group the wise virgins in Matthew 25 verses 1 to 13 in the parable only the wise virgins had oil and were ready for the wedding of the bridegroom the foolish virgins had no oil and therefore they were shut out of the marriage this proves that only those with the Holy Ghost baptism will be a part of the marriage of Jesus Christ and his bride the Bible teaches that oil is a symbol of the Holy Ghost as seen in Zechariah chapter 4 two olive branches empty oil out of themselves into the seven pipes and lamps of the golden candlestick which oil the angel caused the anointing in Zechariah 4:14 which was earlier called the spear in verse 6 of chapter 4 the Holy Spirit is always referred to as the anointing as seen in acts 10 verse 38 as Jesus was anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power a true Holy Ghost filled Christian is in Christ or born again of the Spirit of God or else he is none of his or not his bride her wife according to Romans 8 verse 9 being born again is the seal of the Holy Ghost unto the day of redemption meaning that a real spirit-filled Christian does not love the world and backside into many lusts and pleasures true Christians seek to perfect holiness in the fear of God according to 2nd Corinthians 7 verse [Music]
