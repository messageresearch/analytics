[0:14] to either follow the word of God
[0:22] every word that you say to be true but
[0:26] they don't
[0:27] they don't believe in their own actions
[0:29] prove that they don't
[0:30] [Music]
[0:33] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:35] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:38] this video is to continue the series on
[0:40] 24 Lies coming out of Branham Tabernacle
[0:45] in this video we'll cover lies number
[0:47] two and three and there's no specific
[0:49] order of these lies I'll just bring them
[0:51] out as clear as I can by the grace of
[0:53] the Lord Jesus Christ again these videos
[0:55] are made with brotherly love and
[0:57] kindness towards everyone who considers
[1:00] Branham Tabernacle their home church
[1:01] just as I expressed in part one of this
[1:04] series
[1:05] before getting into the second and third
[1:07] lie out of Branham Tabernacle let me
[1:09] just read this quote and then we'll
[1:10] listen to it from Brother Branham it's
[1:12] from influences 1964 a minister was
[1:15] trying to tell brother Branham that it
[1:16] wasn't his duty to preach against sin
[1:19] but brother Branham said if the pastors
[1:21] weren't doing it then he had to let his
[1:24] voice cry out against it so the same is
[1:26] true today if some message passes around
[1:29] the world will not call out the sins
[1:32] that Brenham Tabernacle is propagating
[1:34] the lies that they're propagating
[1:36] then I've got to be one of those voices
[1:38] to crowd against it let's listen to the
[1:40] quote
[1:49] [Music]
[1:59] so let's begin with a second lie coming
[2:01] onto Brandon Tabernacle the LIE is all
[2:04] answers are on the tapes because brother
[2:06] Adam's words cannot fail
[2:09] of course this is a lie it is idolatry
[2:12] to make brother Branham possessor of
[2:14] every answer which essentially makes
[2:16] brother random equal to God
[2:19] so we have two witnesses of this first
[2:20] we'll watch a video where the leadership
[2:22] at Branham Tabernacle says this and he
[2:25] doesn't say all the answers but then
[2:26] later in a blog post he says the tapes
[2:29] have all the answers so let's watch the
[2:31] video first
[2:32] he revealed it to his profit
[2:37] do we believe everything that the
[2:39] prophet said
[2:43] the prophet of God told us
[2:46] he said if you have any questions
[2:50] he said the answer is on the tape
[2:56] that's not my words
[2:59] that's his word
[3:01] and his word cannot fail
[3:04] amen amen now let's listen to a quote
[3:08] from brother Brandon where he says he
[3:10] doesn't know all the answers and we'll
[3:12] listen to these quotes back to back
[3:13] listen to the LIE coming out of random
[3:16] Tabernacle and then we'll listen to
[3:17] brother Brandon tell the truth that he
[3:19] doesn't have all the answers let's
[3:20] listen to both quotes back to back
[3:32] hey
[3:35] his word cannot fail
[3:39] ing to the opening of The Fifth Fifth
[3:42] seal
[3:43] Moses and Elijah have had to die what
[3:47] about Enoch
[3:49] I don't know
[3:51] if I don't know I don't know I don't I
[3:55] don't know all the answers about that I
[3:57] don't know and if I don't know I will
[3:59] tell you I don't know if I do know I
[4:02] won't tell you till I do no see myself
[4:09] here's the second witness where Branham
[4:11] Tabernacle claims the tapes have all the
[4:14] answers this is from their blog post
[4:15] from September 23rd 2020 random
[4:20] Tabernacles pastor says quote dear bride
[4:22] whatever we have need of along this
[4:25] life's journey this message provides for
[4:27] us and answers all our questions truly
[4:30] it is our compass that points us to our
[4:32] North Star end quote
[4:36] so again Branham Tabernacles pastor says
[4:39] this message provides for us and answers
[4:42] all our questions now let's listen to
[4:44] brother random say again he doesn't have
[4:46] all the answers
[4:47] what about Enoch
[4:50] I don't know
[4:52] if I don't go on it's okay I don't know
[4:54] I see right I don't I don't know all the
[4:57] answers about that I don't know
[4:59] to further prove brother Brown did not
[5:02] have all the answers he even stated
[5:04] specifically in why I'm against
[5:05] organized religion in 1962 that any
[5:09] Prophet who says he has all the answers
[5:11] is not a prophet and in particular
[5:14] brother Branham is speaking of prophets
[5:16] in the prayer lines who can discern
[5:18] every situation
[5:20] and brother Rams says this is not the
[5:22] nature of God so clearly Brenham
[5:25] Tabernacle is going against the very
[5:27] nature of God by claiming that the tapes
[5:30] have all the answers as brother Ram
[5:32] tells us God doesn't send anyone with
[5:35] all the answers even our Lord Jesus
[5:37] Christ didn't know the day and hour of
[5:39] the Rapture as he said in Matthew 24.
[5:41] only the father knows that answer
[5:44] so let's listen to the quotes back to
[5:46] back we'll listen to Brighton
[5:47] Tabernacles pastor and then we'll listen
[5:49] to brother Branham tell the truth
[6:04] his word cannot fail
[6:11] that's got all the answers to every
[6:13] gimmick that you can bring up remember
[6:15] he's not a prophet
[6:17] amen today they've got to know
[6:20] everything when you're going to have a
[6:21] toothache when you're going to have a
[6:23] tummy ache and everything else and tell
[6:24] you all about it that isn't the nature
[6:27] of our God
[6:29] watch the prophets watch Jesus
[6:33] before moving on to the third lie let's
[6:36] listen to this quote from the smyrnan
[6:37] church age from the church age book
[6:39] brother Brown showed how each Revival
[6:42] produced real Believers but then each
[6:44] move of God eventually denominated and
[6:47] the Holy Spirit left that movement or
[6:49] the ram noticed each denomination said
[6:52] they could prove that they now have all
[6:54] the truth and know all the answers so
[6:56] the very fact that Branham Tabernacle is
[6:58] claiming that the tapes have all the
[7:00] answers shows they have the spirit of
[7:03] organization and not the true baptism of
[7:05] the Holy Ghost and again we'll play it
[7:07] back to back we'll play the leader of
[7:09] random Tabernacle saying they have the
[7:10] answers and then brother Brown's own
[7:12] church age book saying they don't have
[7:15] all the answers
[7:17] poured out his Spirit upon Baptists
[7:19] methodists nazarenes Adventists
[7:22] Presbyterians Brethren Church of God
[7:25] several so named Etc
[7:28] all these Brethren were brought up on
[7:30] different doctrines bylaws Church
[7:32] manuals Etc God swept it all to one side
[7:35] he destroyed their dispensational
[7:37] theories and restored the gifts of the
[7:40] Spirit proving he is the same yesterday
[7:42] and today and forever
[7:44] but did those Pentecostals learn their
[7:46] lesson about Organization no sir they
[7:49] organized right back and have written
[7:51] their own textbooks bylaws and church
[7:54] manual Fellowship book Etc with one idea
[7:58] in mind which is to prove that they now
[8:00] have all the truth know all the answers
[8:03] and
[8:04] for the elite of God who know the way
[8:06] and can show it unto others as God's
[8:08] appointed guides
[8:10] they haven't got it
[8:12] hybridized themselves like the very
[8:14] groups they came out of if they want to
[8:16] be in the bride they are going to have
[8:19] to come out exactly as did their
[8:20] forefathers
[8:23] the third lie coming out of Branham
[8:25] Tabernacle is that they teach their
[8:28] believer should unquestionably believe
[8:30] every word on brother Ram's tapes even
[8:33] if brother bran lied essentially saying
[8:36] don't have your spiritual guard up
[8:40] in other words don't use a thinking
[8:42] man's filter which is the word of God
[8:44] and don't use the gift of discernment
[8:47] of course this is a lie it again
[8:49] encourages idolatry of William Branham
[8:52] and also encourages all the tape church
[8:54] people and press play people to open
[8:58] themselves up to evil spirits according
[9:00] to brother Branham so let's listen to
[9:02] brainum Tabernacle leadership say this
[9:05] that they unquestionably believe every
[9:07] word on the tapes even if brother Brown
[9:09] told a lie and then right after that
[9:11] we'll hear Brother Branham say we cannot
[9:13] just let our mind go blank now and
[9:16] brother random said
[9:17] person coming to Christ should come with
[9:20] all the intelligence they got he said
[9:22] keep your mind alert when you come to
[9:24] Christ let's listen to the quotes
[9:27] we can just sit
[9:29] and relax and just enjoy what we're
[9:32] hearing it doesn't matter we don't have
[9:33] to have our guard up you don't have to
[9:35] do nothing except for saying amen amen
[9:39] he says the bride says Amen to every
[9:43] word
[9:44] what did that angel of the Lord say get
[9:46] the people to believe you so when
[9:49] they're trying to make you doubt well
[9:51] the prophet didn't say this and didn't
[9:52] say this and he made a mistake here made
[9:54] a mistake here I don't care if it's a
[9:55] bare-paced life the world can prove it I
[9:57] believe it
[9:59] the angel said get the people and
[10:02] believe what you said amen we believe it
[10:06] [Applause]
[10:11] now you deny the very commission by
[10:14] saying that he didn't say what the end
[10:16] of the Lord get to people to believe you
[10:18] amen so we don't care what says on them
[10:20] tapes we believe it I don't have to
[10:23] explain it I don't have to understand it
[10:26] I just got to believe it amen
[10:30] [Applause]
[10:49] experience
[10:50] [Music]
[10:54] when you do that you just open your soul
[10:58] to Satan he'll give you something that's
[11:01] true
[11:02] but I think a person coming to Christ
[11:04] should come with all the intelligence
[11:07] thank God
[11:08] according in their mind when they come
[11:10] to him every promise in the scripture
[11:13] your mind alert when you come to Christ
[11:15] don't let it go blank the devil will
[11:18] make you do anything see they'll give
[11:21] you a sensation he can do that too but
[11:23] you want an experience something that
[11:26] the Bible teaches something that's real
[11:31] here's another quote from Brother
[11:32] Branham and he cares do you care 1963
[11:35] brother Brown said I've always asked you
[11:37] to be careful what you're listening to
[11:39] so let's play these quotes back to back
[11:41] Brenham tabernacle's leader saying you
[11:43] could say Amen to every word believe
[11:45] every word and yet brother Branham says
[11:47] be careful what you're listening to
[11:49] because there's so much of it that is
[11:51] just the Human Side let's listen to the
[11:54] quotes
[11:56] we can just sit back and relax
[11:59] and just enjoy what we're
[12:03] guard up you don't have to do nothing
[12:05] except for saying amen amen amen so we
[12:09] don't care what says on them tapes we
[12:11] believe it I don't have to explain it I
[12:15] don't have to understand it I just got
[12:17] to believe it
[12:19] amen
[12:20] [Applause]
[12:32] did you just announce there there would
[12:36] be this happening now
[12:40] see I've always asked you to be careful
[12:44] what you're listening to I think there's
[12:47] so much of it that it's just the human
[12:49] side but always if there is something
[12:53] that goes forth it will speak it it's
[12:56] thus saith the Lord even divisions or
[12:59] anything that
[13:02] and that's reason I say that not that
[13:04] there is any uh any prophecy concerning
[13:07] and I have nothing on it from the Lord
[13:09] and be you sure now if I say anything
[13:11] from the Lord like that to tell you it's
[13:14] always I'm speaking now but when he
[13:17] speaks I say it's not me it's thus saith
[13:19] the Lord and I can't say it until he
[13:21] tells me I could be all together wrong
[13:23] am I thought about Martin Luther King I
[13:26] don't know I can't say if that's just my
[13:28] opinion anything
[13:32] here's the second witness from Branham
[13:33] Tabernacles blog post this is from
[13:36] October 23rd 2021
[13:39] the pastor wrote quote dear stimulated
[13:41] bride there's nothing like the sheer Joy
[13:43] of knowing you're listening to the pure
[13:45] Vindicated voice of God no need to have
[13:47] your guard up no need to wonder does
[13:49] this line up with the word is that his
[13:51] thoughts or his interpretation I've got
[13:54] to go check it with the word not us we
[13:56] just sit back relax and say Amen to
[13:58] every word as we know everything we're
[14:00] hearing is thus say the Lord end quote
[14:05] So based upon this blog post
[14:08] the Pastor said not us we don't have to
[14:10] go check it with the word
[14:12] so let's hear where brother random said
[14:14] prove All Things by the word of God and
[14:16] every teaching every Doctrine must be
[14:18] proven by the scriptures
[14:28] says
[14:33] the scripture is always right and only
[14:36] way you can do anything is
[14:38] to the scripture
[14:40] is that true
[14:43] I would like to hear you say Amen when
[14:45] you believe it you see amen means so be
[14:48] it now
[14:52] [Music]
[15:10] [Music]
[15:13] the same thing
[15:15] because we cannot believe scripture
[15:21] everybody created a mass of two three
[15:24] witnesses that every word they
[15:26] established
[15:28] now here is the time that everything
[15:31] that I've said has got to be proven to
[15:34] be right or wrong
[15:42] in closing
[15:44] friends I hope this video has been a
[15:46] blessing by the grace of God we've now
[15:48] seen three Lies coming out of Branham
[15:49] Tabernacle and they're easily refuted or
[15:52] debunked by the word of God and quotes
[15:54] from Brother Branham himself let's pray
[15:56] for the leadership in Branham Tabernacle
[15:58] and all the followers of the press play
[16:00] tape Church movement this false movement
[16:03] this man-made denomination let's pray
[16:05] for them to repent and come to the truth
[16:08] father God again I come to you in the
[16:10] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and with
[16:12] all humility and love I pray for random
[16:14] Tabernacles leadership and all the
[16:16] members God that they could humble
[16:18] themselves and receive the spirit of
[16:20] Truth and understand their believing so
[16:22] many lies Lord Jesus be kind be merciful
[16:25] be gracious Lord God and I pray God all
[16:28] those who want the truth could be drawn
[16:30] out from these lies and receive the
[16:32] truth by the power of the Holy Spirit
[16:35] I asked this with the love of Christ in
[16:37] my heart I pray you be merciful save all
[16:39] those who can be saved for the glory of
[16:42] the Lord Jesus Christ
[16:43] and I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen
