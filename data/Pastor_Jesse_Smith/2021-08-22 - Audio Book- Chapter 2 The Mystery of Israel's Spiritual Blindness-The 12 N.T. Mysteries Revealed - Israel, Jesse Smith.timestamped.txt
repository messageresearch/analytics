[0:00] chapter 2 the mystery of israel's
[0:03] spiritual blindness
[0:04] mystery number 2 of 12. chapter 2
[0:08] contains footnotes numbers 284
[0:11] to 368.
[0:14] for i would not brethren that ye should
[0:16] be ignorant of this mystery
[0:18] lest ye should be wise in your own
[0:20] conceits
[0:21] that blindness in part is happened to
[0:23] israel
[0:24] until the fullness of the gentiles
[0:26] become in
[0:28] romans 11 verse 25
[0:32] before discussing israel's blindness
[0:34] it's important to understand her
[0:36] biblical history
[0:37] the old testament richly chronicles
[0:39] israel's relationship
[0:41] with the one person god yahweh the god
[0:44] of the bible
[0:45] this relationship begins in eden showing
[0:48] how god revealed himself to adam's
[0:49] faithful descendants
[0:51] israel through the old testament but
[0:54] later in the new testament
[0:55] had to put spiritual blindness that
[0:57] still exists today
[0:59] upon the jews that he might show mercy
[1:01] to the gentiles
[1:03] adam and eve's godly seed proceeds
[1:05] through cess lineage to noah
[1:08] between noah's three sons ham shem and
[1:11] japheth
[1:12] shem emerges as the faithful servant to
[1:14] god proven by the godly deeds of him
[1:18] and his descendants the lord promises to
[1:20] bless
[1:21] every nation through father abraham the
[1:23] ninth descendant from shem
[1:26] but specifically isaac seed is
[1:28] recognized
[1:29] as the true heirs of his everlasting
[1:31] covenant in genesis 17
[1:33] verses 19 through 21 and god said
[1:37] sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son
[1:39] indeed and thou shalt call his name
[1:41] isaac and i will establish my covenant
[1:44] with him for an everlasting covenant
[1:46] and with his seed after him and as for
[1:49] ishmael i have heard thee
[1:51] behold i have blessed him and will make
[1:53] him fruitful
[1:54] and will multiply him exceedingly twelve
[1:57] princes shall he beget
[1:59] and i will make him a great nation but
[2:01] my covenant will i establish with isaac
[2:04] which sarah shall bear unto thee at this
[2:06] set time in the next year
[2:10] five generations from isaac comes moses
[2:13] god's prophet
[2:14] sent to deliver the children of israel
[2:16] out of egyptian slavery
[2:18] in moses's time god's compassionate
[2:20] description of his love for his people
[2:22] begins to manifest three months after
[2:25] the exodus in the desert of sinai
[2:27] god instructs moses to tell israel
[2:30] they're a special treasure to him
[2:32] exodus 19 verses 4 through 6 reads
[2:36] ye have seen what i did unto the
[2:38] egyptians and how i bear you on eagle's
[2:40] wings
[2:41] and brought you unto myself now
[2:43] therefore
[2:44] if you obey my voice indeed and keep my
[2:47] covenant
[2:48] then ye shall be a peculiar treasure
[2:50] unto me
[2:51] above all people for all the earth is
[2:53] mine
[2:54] and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of
[2:56] priests and an holy nation
[2:58] these are the words which thou shalt
[3:00] speak unto the children of israel
[3:03] hardly more beautiful comforting words
[3:05] could ever be
[3:06] received imagine the creator of the
[3:09] universe calling you his special
[3:10] treasure
[3:12] israel was indeed blessed and highly
[3:14] favored being singled out
[3:15] from every nation under heaven as the
[3:18] holder of god's covenants and blessings
[3:21] in fact paul says all other nations
[3:24] egypt persia greece
[3:25] china japan russia etc were
[3:28] aliens from the commonwealth of israel
[3:31] and strangers from the covenants of
[3:33] promise
[3:33] having no hope and without god in the
[3:36] world
[3:37] indeed israel was the chosen special
[3:40] privileged
[3:41] and peculiar people in the earth thanks
[3:43] to god's gracious choosing
[3:46] but god had conditions to his covenant
[3:48] with israel he said if
[3:50] israel obeyed his voice and kept his
[3:52] covenant they would remain a kingdom of
[3:54] priests and holy nation unto him
[3:57] israel often wavered in devotion to god
[4:00] some 800 years before christ
[4:02] god anointed the prophet isaiah to
[4:04] foretell
[4:05] israel's spiritual blindness that would
[4:07] come upon them
[4:08] as a result of their rebellion to his
[4:10] holy covenant
[4:12] and he said go and tell this people hear
[4:15] ye indeed
[4:16] but understand not and see ye indeed
[4:19] but perceive not make the heart of this
[4:22] people fat
[4:23] and make their ears heavy and shut their
[4:25] eyes lest they see with their eyes and
[4:27] hear with their ears
[4:29] and understand with their heart and
[4:30] convert and be healed
[4:33] then in jeremiah's day about 600 years
[4:36] before christ
[4:37] the lord himself called his people
[4:39] backsliding israel
[4:40] israel had some godly leaders such as
[4:43] joshua samuel
[4:44] david solomon hezekiah and josiah
[4:47] but the majority were evil men who led
[4:50] god's people into evil
[4:52] idolatrous lifestyles israel's
[4:54] disobedience though
[4:56] could not override god's grace to them
[4:58] nor could it hinder his amazing plan of
[5:00] redemption
[5:01] for all nations in his grace
[5:05] 42 generations after abraham god sent
[5:07] his promised son
[5:08] jesus christ to redeem israel from their
[5:11] sins
[5:12] and fill their souls with the holy
[5:13] spirit jesus was the fulfillment of
[5:16] god's promises to abraham
[5:18] to bless his seed and all nations
[5:20] messiah was god's antidote
[5:22] for their sin problem note specifically
[5:25] jesus's command
[5:27] for his disciples to preach to israel
[5:29] and not the other nations
[5:31] which are all bundled together in one
[5:33] group called gentiles
[5:35] matthew 10 verses 5 through 7 says
[5:38] these 12 jesus sent forth and commanded
[5:41] them saying
[5:42] go not into the way of the gentiles and
[5:44] into any city of the samaritans
[5:46] enter ye not but go rather to the lost
[5:48] sheep of the house of israel
[5:50] and as ye go preach saying the kingdom
[5:52] of heaven is at hand
[5:55] sadly israel rejected their messiah
[5:57] their antidote
[5:59] their literal words were away with him
[6:01] away with him
[6:02] crucify him we have no king but caesar
[6:06] the once kingdom of priests rejected
[6:08] their king
[6:09] john 1 verse 11 reads he came unto his
[6:12] own
[6:13] and his own received him not
[6:15] consequently
[6:16] god gave israel what they wanted
[6:18] unbelief
[6:20] due to their disobedience most israelis
[6:22] were blinded to jesus as
[6:24] messiah god then chose to temporarily
[6:27] put spiritual blindness upon
[6:29] backslidden israel so he might save the
[6:32] gentiles
[6:33] giving them an opportunity for eternal
[6:35] salvation
[6:37] it's imperative to realize the gentiles
[6:39] are not israel
[6:40] as some churches believe israel is
[6:42] forever her own
[6:43] independent nation before god and man
[6:46] due to the abrahamic and mosaic
[6:48] covenants
[6:50] numerous scriptures clearly state israel
[6:52] is spiritually blind
[6:53] jesus and paul leave no confusion about
[6:56] this
[6:57] all four gospels matthew 13 verses 14
[7:00] and 15 mark 4 verses 11 through 12.
[7:05] luke 8 verse 10 john 12
[7:08] 40. record jesus quoting isaiah 6
[7:12] verses 9 and 10 as you've already read
[7:16] while in rome witnessing about christ
[7:18] jews some rejected paul's teachings
[7:21] causing him to quote isaiah 6 9-10
[7:24] in acts chapter 28 verses 25-28
[7:29] and when they agreed not among
[7:31] themselves they departed
[7:33] after that paude spoke in one word well
[7:35] spake the holy ghost by isaiah
[7:38] the prophet unto our father saying go
[7:40] unto this people and say hearing ye
[7:42] shall hear
[7:43] and shall not understand and seeing ye
[7:45] shall see and not perceive
[7:47] for the heart of this people is wax
[7:49] gross and their ears are dull of hearing
[7:51] and their eyes have they closed lest
[7:54] they should see with their eyes and hear
[7:56] with their ears
[7:57] and understand with their heart and
[7:59] should be converted
[8:00] and i should heal them be it known
[8:02] therefore unto you that the salvation of
[8:04] god
[8:04] is sent unto the gentiles and that they
[8:07] will hear it
[8:09] the apostle paul wrote four scriptures
[8:11] in romans 11
[8:12] verses 7 through 10 and verse 25
[8:16] explaining israel's blindness paul says
[8:18] an elected
[8:19] remnant group of israel received christ
[8:22] and the rest were blinded to fulfill
[8:23] isaiah 29 verse 10
[8:26] and psalm 69 verses 22 through 23
[8:30] the epigraph romans 11 25 denotes god's
[8:34] purpose in blinding
[8:35] israel so he could save the gentiles
[8:38] but the reason israel was blinded was
[8:40] because they stumbled at the stumbling
[8:42] stone
[8:43] meaning they failed to believe in christ
[8:45] when israel rejected faith in christ god
[8:48] blinded them
[8:49] romans 9 verses 31-33
[8:52] declare this truth but israel which
[8:55] followed after the law of righteousness
[8:57] hath not attained to the law of
[8:59] righteousness wherefore
[9:01] because they sought it not by faith but
[9:03] as it were by the works of the law
[9:06] for they stumbled at that stumbling
[9:07] stone as it is written behold i lay in
[9:10] zion
[9:11] a stumbling stone and rock of offense
[9:14] and whosoever believeth on him
[9:16] shall not be ashamed it's apparent in
[9:19] romans 11
[9:20] that israel's blindness is going to be
[9:21] taken away in the future
[9:23] and shall be grafted back into god's
[9:25] blessings
[9:26] romans 11 verse 27 teaches the merciful
[9:29] god is going to remember his covenant
[9:31] and take away israel's sins but many
[9:34] remaining questions need answered
[9:35] regarding the current
[9:36] 2000 year period of blindness
[9:40] the confusion about israel's blindness
[9:43] the confusion surrounding israel's
[9:45] blindness
[9:46] centers on whether or not spiritually
[9:48] blinded jews
[9:49] can be saved while awaiting a messiah
[9:52] as they currently reject jesus christ
[9:54] the true messiah
[9:56] this question covers the salvation of
[9:58] all blinded jews
[9:59] who've lived for the past two thousand
[10:01] years including those alive when jesus
[10:04] walked the earth
[10:05] is it possible blinded jews from jesus
[10:08] day can be saved
[10:09] can blinded jews living now be saved the
[10:12] revelation of the mystery
[10:14] of israel's blindness is that the
[10:16] covenant keeping god
[10:18] still saves blinded jews who faithfully
[10:20] follow
[10:21] old testament commands promising them
[10:23] white robes
[10:24] of eternal life biblical evidence for
[10:28] the revelation about
[10:29] israel's blindness six biblical
[10:32] evidences
[10:33] solidify the fact even blinded jews can
[10:35] be saved
[10:37] jesus's prayer for forgiveness paul's
[10:39] romans
[10:40] 11 teaching foreshadowing in the life of
[10:43] joseph
[10:43] the fifth seal god's righteous judgment
[10:46] based upon knowledge
[10:48] and god's unconditional covenant with
[10:50] israel through abraham
[10:53] jesus's prayer for forgiveness while
[10:56] hanging on his cross
[10:57] jesus christ uttered forgiveness rather
[10:59] than condemnation
[11:00] in luke 23 34 then said jesus father
[11:05] forgive them
[11:06] for they know not what they do and they
[11:08] parted his raiment
[11:09] and cast lots this is amazing grace
[11:13] although his own people according to the
[11:15] flesh
[11:16] called for his blood he breathed mercy
[11:18] instead of judgment
[11:20] blinded jews from jesus day could be
[11:22] saved
[11:24] jesus's words reveal why some blind jews
[11:26] from his time period
[11:28] could still be saved they didn't know
[11:30] what they were doing
[11:31] the principle is that spiritually blind
[11:33] jews cannot fully understand the
[11:35] consequences of rejecting christ
[11:38] just as a natural blind man innocently
[11:40] trips unawares over an object in his
[11:43] path
[11:44] so some of the blinded jews
[11:46] unintentionally stumbled
[11:47] over jesus's life actions and words
[11:52] no doubt some in the crowd calling for
[11:53] jesus crucifixion
[11:55] knew what they were doing like judas
[11:57] iscariot knew he was selling out messiah
[11:59] a holy man psalm 69 verses 20 through 28
[12:04] says this group will have their names
[12:05] removed from the book of life
[12:07] as will judas's scare it but some in the
[12:10] multitude
[12:11] ignorantly got caught up in the moment
[12:13] and joined the mob
[12:14] unintentionally for this group jesus
[12:17] prayed for mercy
[12:18] jesus wouldn't pray for their
[12:20] forgiveness in vain truly jesus knew god
[12:23] heard his every prayer
[12:25] god definitely heard jesus's prayer and
[12:27] will pardon the blinded jews
[12:29] who didn't know what they were doing
[12:31] when they turn their backs on their own
[12:33] savior
[12:34] god's forgiveness is so great he pardons
[12:36] jesus's own disciples
[12:38] who deserted him in his greatest hour of
[12:40] trial
[12:41] the crucifixion except john who is
[12:44] present at the cross
[12:47] paul's romans 11 teaching paul's
[12:50] teaching in romans 11 provides four
[12:52] foundational truths
[12:54] regarding israel's blindness the blinded
[12:57] israelis are not forsaken for all time
[12:59] verses 1 and 11. god is saving gentiles
[13:03] while israel is blinded
[13:04] verses 11 and 15. spiritual blindness is
[13:08] temporary
[13:09] not permanent verses 23 and 26
[13:13] spiritual blindness is only set in on
[13:16] part of israel
[13:17] not the believing remnant verse 25
[13:21] only part of israel is blinded to
[13:23] christ's identity as messiah
[13:26] paul calls the part that believes in
[13:27] jesus as christ
[13:29] the remnant in romans 11 verse 5.
[13:32] even so then at this present time also
[13:35] there is a remnant according to the
[13:37] election of grace
[13:39] the apostle uses himself as an example
[13:41] of a jew
[13:42] who believes in christ in verse 1
[13:44] calling himself
[13:46] an israelite of the seed of abraham of
[13:48] the tribe of benjamin
[13:51] a small remnant of jews in paul's day
[13:54] believed in christ as messiah
[13:56] and it's still possible for a jewish
[13:57] remnant to see or believe in christ
[14:00] today
[14:01] despite the majority of israelis being
[14:03] blinded god has not completely forsaken
[14:06] israel for all time twice paul says god
[14:09] forbid
[14:10] that he would cast away his people and
[14:12] that they would stumble and fall
[14:13] completely away from god's grace
[14:16] paul says the jews are provoked to
[14:18] jealousy as they see the gentiles
[14:20] receiving god's salvation
[14:21] that was first sent to them israel
[14:24] experiences temporary spiritual
[14:26] blindness
[14:27] romans 11 23 says israel
[14:30] will eventually overcome unbelief in
[14:32] christ and shall be grafted in
[14:34] for god is able to graft them in again
[14:37] observe paul never condemns blinded
[14:39] israel
[14:40] like a broken off branch blinded israel
[14:43] is detached
[14:44] from the god tree meaning they cannot
[14:46] possess god's eternal life
[14:47] the baptism of the holy spirit while
[14:50] living on earth
[14:51] see chapter 6 after the last gentiles
[14:54] are saved
[14:55] israel's spiritual blindness will end
[14:57] and all israel shall be saved
[14:59] which revelation 7 verse 4 tells us is
[15:02] the 144 thousand
[15:04] jews based upon romans 11
[15:07] verse 11 and 15 god is focusing on
[15:10] saving
[15:11] or reconciling the gentiles while the
[15:13] majority of israel is blinded
[15:15] shortly before his crucifixion in luke
[15:18] 21 verse 24
[15:19] jesus foretold god's desire to save
[15:21] gentiles
[15:23] and they shall fall by the edge of the
[15:24] sword and shall be led away captive into
[15:27] all nations
[15:28] and jerusalem shall be trodden down of
[15:30] the gentiles
[15:31] until the times of the gentiles be
[15:33] fulfilled
[15:34] god is graciously giving the gentiles an
[15:36] opportunity to be saved
[15:38] after israel had nearly 1 500 years
[15:41] with salvation through moses's law
[15:44] only god knows how much time the
[15:46] gentiles have left to be saved
[15:48] foolish men constantly guess and miss
[15:50] the date of jesus return to earth
[15:53] but once the last day is fulfilled jesus
[15:56] is returning to catch away his gentile
[15:58] wife
[15:58] and then restore blindness free
[16:00] salvation back to israel
[16:04] foreshadowing in the life of joseph the
[16:07] life of joseph son of jacob
[16:09] foreshadows the life of jesus christ and
[16:12] shows how the blinded jews can be saved
[16:14] at the white throne judgment
[16:15] despite rejecting christ during their
[16:17] lifetimes joseph's life before slavery
[16:20] types jesus's first coming to earth
[16:23] jacob especially loved his son joseph
[16:25] as the heavenly father loved christ
[16:28] gifted in spiritual things
[16:30] joseph shared prophetic dreams with his
[16:31] brothers who despised them
[16:34] christ's spiritual gifts of preaching
[16:36] and prophesying to israel
[16:37] caused them to despise his words jacob
[16:41] sent joseph to check on his brethren
[16:42] but they sold him to egypt god sent
[16:45] christ to israel
[16:46] but they sold him out to rome while in
[16:49] egypt they
[16:50] imprisoned joseph on a false accusation
[16:53] rome arrested jesus on a false
[16:55] accusation
[16:56] while in prison joseph ministered to two
[16:58] prisoners
[17:00] one lived and one died while on the
[17:02] cross
[17:03] jesus hung between two prisoners one
[17:05] received a promise of eternal life in
[17:07] paradise
[17:08] and the other lost joseph was
[17:10] resurrected out of prison
[17:12] and set as second in command to pharaoh
[17:15] jesus was resurrected out of the tomb
[17:17] and ascended to the right hand of the
[17:19] majesty on high
[17:21] while second in command joseph married
[17:23] an egyptian
[17:24] or gentile wife jesus now offers
[17:27] salvation to the gentiles
[17:29] and the saved make up his spiritual wife
[17:31] the new testament
[17:32] gentile church during the famine
[17:35] joseph's brothers went to egypt to get
[17:37] food but were blinded to their brother's
[17:39] identity
[17:40] yet he's merciful to them this example
[17:42] demonstrates that jesus will be merciful
[17:45] to his blinded brethren
[17:46] israel joseph eventually revealed
[17:49] himself to his brothers
[17:50] and explained god allowed them to sell
[17:52] him into slavery
[17:54] in order to save lives during the famine
[17:57] in type
[17:58] jesus's crucifixion saved all people
[18:00] gentiles and jews
[18:02] during the spiritual famine of the seven
[18:04] church ages
[18:05] as joseph established his brothers in
[18:07] goshen jesus will reveal himself to the
[18:09] jews
[18:10] during the tribulation period and
[18:12] re-establish them
[18:13] in their promised land jerusalem
[18:16] the white throne judgment of all nations
[18:19] in matthew 25 verses 31
[18:21] to 46 shows how christ mercifully grants
[18:25] eternal life to surprised doers of good
[18:28] works
[18:28] who were seemingly blinded to his
[18:30] identity during their lives
[18:32] surely this group includes the nation of
[18:34] israel as all nations are gathered there
[18:37] the blessed group of the saved were
[18:39] unaware of christ's presence living
[18:41] inside his followers
[18:42] the brethren in other words they were
[18:45] blinded to christ's body
[18:47] his church his bride but christians like
[18:50] paul
[18:51] are not blinded to other christians
[18:53] philippians 4
[18:54] verse 3 says that paul knew clement and
[18:57] a group of christian women
[18:58] were saved and their names are in the
[19:00] book of life
[19:02] according to jesus this saved group in
[19:04] matthew 25
[19:06] helped him by helping his followers they
[19:08] gave food drink
[19:10] shelter and clothing to christians they
[19:13] made sick visits and prison visits to
[19:15] christians
[19:16] they were blind to the fact they were
[19:18] actually helping jesus
[19:20] but jesus like joseph was not blinded to
[19:23] their identities
[19:24] and remembered their good works to his
[19:26] church and so obtained mercy
[19:29] jesus's gracious judgment reminds you of
[19:31] peter's words in acts 10
[19:33] verses 34 and 35 how god accepts all
[19:36] persons from all nations
[19:38] who fear him and work righteousness
[19:42] the fifth seal the heavenly altar of
[19:45] incense
[19:46] and locations after death the fifth seal
[19:49] in revelation 6 verses 9 through 11
[19:52] is irrefutable evidence that god saves
[19:55] blinded jews
[19:56] for the souls under the altar can be
[19:58] only israelis
[20:00] four details prove this group is israel
[20:03] first they are martyrs slain for the
[20:06] word of god
[20:07] and for the testimony which they held
[20:09] notice they are not slain for the
[20:11] testimony of jesus
[20:13] john the author of revelation is
[20:15] described as having both the testimony
[20:17] of the word of god
[20:18] and also of jesus christ in revelation
[20:21] chapter 1 verse 2
[20:23] and verse 9. john was a christian and
[20:26] believe both the word of god
[20:28] old testament and the testimony of jesus
[20:30] christ the new testament
[20:32] but the fifth seal group faithfully
[20:34] believe the word of god
[20:36] or old testament unto their deaths
[20:38] having no testimony of jesus
[20:41] showing they are jews second they call
[20:44] for vengeance and judgment upon those
[20:46] who killed them
[20:47] but christians do not call for vengeance
[20:50] as both stephen
[20:51] acts 7 6 and christ luke 23
[20:55] 34 pleaded for god's forgiveness upon
[20:58] their persecutors
[20:59] at their deaths third white robes were
[21:02] promised to them
[21:03] after their deaths but christians have
[21:05] white robes
[21:06] representing eternal life clothing their
[21:09] souls while they live
[21:10] on earth jesus says the holy
[21:12] ghost-filled christian
[21:13] is endued or clothed with power upon
[21:17] receiving the holy spirit
[21:19] paul tells believers to put ye on the
[21:21] lord jesus christ
[21:22] in romans 13 verse 14.
[21:25] christ offers a reminder of his imminent
[21:28] return
[21:28] in revelation 16 15 telling saints to
[21:32] keep their garments
[21:33] behold i come as a thief blessed is he
[21:36] that watcheth
[21:37] and keepeth his garments lest he walk
[21:40] naked
[21:40] and they see his shame note also how
[21:44] jesus promises these fifth seal israelis
[21:46] robes
[21:47] just as joseph gave his brother new
[21:49] raiment
[21:50] in genesis 45 verse 22 after making
[21:54] himself known to them
[21:56] fourth revelation 6 11 says there are
[22:00] more fellow servants or brethren
[22:02] of these jews who must be martyred to
[22:04] fulfill a divine
[22:05] appointed number god alone knows this
[22:08] number
[22:08] because only he can calculate the
[22:10] punishment upon israel
[22:12] for crucifying their own sinless
[22:14] blameless messiah
[22:16] matthew 27 verse 25 says israel called
[22:19] for jesus's blood
[22:21] to be upon them and their children and
[22:23] tragically it has been more than six
[22:26] million jews died in the holocaust
[22:28] and thousands if not millions more have
[22:31] given their lives to fulfill this
[22:32] self-inflicted punishment
[22:35] yet the merciful god of heaven will end
[22:37] this persecution
[22:38] at the conversion of the 144 000 jews
[22:42] while granting eternal life to all
[22:44] jewish martyrs
[22:45] who remain faithful to the word of god
[22:48] additionally the fifth seal helps
[22:50] clarify the three different locations
[22:52] for souls
[22:53] after death under the altar of incense
[22:56] paradise and prison none need wonder
[23:00] where his soul will go
[23:01] upon death first faithful blinded jews
[23:05] find
[23:05] shelter for their souls under the altar
[23:07] in heaven
[23:08] near the throne of christ the lord what
[23:11] sweet confirmation for us to know
[23:13] how near jewish martyrs are to christ
[23:16] the one who kept
[23:17] and fulfilled the old covenant and that
[23:19] they can cry out loudly to him
[23:22] and be heard three revelation scriptures
[23:26] describe this golden altar of incense as
[23:28] having
[23:29] four horns while fiery incense is
[23:32] offered upon it
[23:33] with the prayers of the saints recall
[23:35] moses's earthly altar of incense
[23:38] was based upon this heavenly incense
[23:40] altar
[23:41] the altar of incense was the closest
[23:42] piece of furniture to the holiest of
[23:45] holies
[23:46] yet it was separated by the veil
[23:48] likewise in heaven the altar of incense
[23:51] is followed by a veil
[23:52] and a holiest of holies hebrews 6 verse
[23:55] 19
[23:56] reads which hope we have as an anchor of
[23:59] the soul
[24:00] both sure and steadfast and which
[24:02] entereth into that
[24:04] within the veil saved blinded jews are
[24:07] close to christ
[24:08] but distance remains between them and
[24:10] the lord
[24:12] accompanying the altar of incense there
[24:14] must be another heavenly altar where
[24:16] jesus's blood
[24:17] lays as an atonement for sin two
[24:20] revelation scriptures
[24:22] show a portion of jesus's blood is
[24:24] present in heaven
[24:25] revelation 5 verse 6 pictures the
[24:28] heavenly christ manifested
[24:30] as a slain lamb and revelation 19 13
[24:34] says jesus has a visible vesture dipped
[24:36] in blood
[24:37] when he returns on a white horse for the
[24:39] battle of armageddon
[24:41] as colossians 1 verse 14 declares we
[24:44] presently
[24:45] have redemption through his blood even
[24:47] the forgiveness of sins
[24:49] just as the earthly tabernacle of moses
[24:52] required blood for atonement
[24:54] so does the heavenly paradise a location
[24:57] even nearer
[24:58] to christ's heavenly throne then the
[25:00] souls under the altar
[25:01] is the second location souls go but only
[25:04] born against souls
[25:06] since the altar of incense is where jews
[25:08] go who were never born again by the
[25:10] baptism of the holy ghost
[25:13] it must also be the location where
[25:14] christians go who were never born again
[25:17] for any believer not born again lacks a
[25:20] white garment
[25:21] jesus labels these christians as foolish
[25:24] virgins
[25:24] in matthew 25 verses 1 1-13
[25:28] the wise virgin christians possess the
[25:31] oil
[25:32] representing the holy ghost baptism
[25:35] paradise's location used to be in the
[25:37] heart of the earth
[25:38] called abraham's bosom by jesus luke 23
[25:42] verse 43
[25:44] teaches jesus took the repentant thief
[25:46] on the cross to paradise
[25:47] after their deaths on good friday but
[25:50] upon christ's resurrection
[25:52] he led the previously captive believers
[25:54] into his eternal
[25:56] captivity and they resurrected in
[25:58] glorified bodies
[25:59] appearing to many in jerusalem forty
[26:02] days later
[26:03] jesus ascended to heaven with the
[26:04] resurrected saints
[26:06] moving paradise close to his heavenly
[26:08] throne
[26:09] in second corinthians 12 verses 1
[26:11] through 4
[26:12] paul says he was caught up by vision to
[26:14] paradise
[26:15] also known as the third heaven this is
[26:18] where jesus lives with the heavenly host
[26:20] and believers the first heaven must be
[26:23] the atmosphere around the earth
[26:25] and outer space including all the
[26:27] remainder of our universe
[26:29] is the second heaven prison
[26:32] also called hell in luke 16 verse 23
[26:35] is located in the heart of the earth and
[26:38] is the third location
[26:39] only disobedient unbelieving souls go
[26:42] there upon death
[26:44] jesus story of the rich man and beggar
[26:46] lazarus
[26:47] in luke 16 verses 19-31
[26:50] vividly describes this prison of torment
[26:53] in which constant flames
[26:54] discomfort the unjust in first peter
[26:58] 3 verses 18 through 20 peter teaches
[27:01] jesus preached to the disobedient souls
[27:03] in prison
[27:04] when he descended to hell following his
[27:06] crucifixion
[27:08] observe the loving kind jesus rebuking
[27:11] and preaching to the eternal lost souls
[27:13] in prison
[27:14] these souls have no more chance to be
[27:16] saved and yet jesus preaches to them
[27:18] no doubt chiding them for rejecting noah
[27:21] and all the other prophets jesus sent to
[27:23] warn them of judgment
[27:25] for their unrepentant hearts all
[27:27] disobedient souls in prison
[27:29] remain there until the white throne
[27:31] judgment when jesus will command hell
[27:34] to deliver all these prisoners to their
[27:36] heavenly court trials
[27:37] to receive punishment according to their
[27:40] works
[27:42] the bible describes the conditions
[27:43] immediately after a person dies
[27:45] or gives up the ghost first angels will
[27:48] usher the human spirit
[27:50] to enter the third heaven for the
[27:52] believer or to hell's prison
[27:54] for the unbeliever luke 16 verses 22
[27:57] and 23 say the righteous beggar lazarus
[28:01] was carried by the angels into abraham's
[28:03] bosom
[28:04] the rich man also died and was buried
[28:07] and in hell he lift up his eyes
[28:09] being in torments and seeth abraham afar
[28:12] off
[28:12] and lazarus in his bosom since abraham's
[28:16] bosom
[28:16] or paradise moved its location to the
[28:19] third heaven
[28:20] believers now ascend to heaven rather
[28:22] than descending to the heart of the
[28:23] earth
[28:24] faithful jews and foolish virgin
[28:26] christians go under the altar of incense
[28:29] while holy ghost filled christians go
[28:31] very near to jesus throne
[28:33] in paradise a second condition is the
[28:36] human spirit
[28:37] retains its character memories
[28:40] convictions
[28:40] and feelings whether good or bad in the
[28:43] fifth seal
[28:44] faithful jews cry out for vengeance
[28:46] death never took away their desire to be
[28:48] avenged
[28:49] death doesn't change a person's
[28:51] character either in luke 16
[28:53] jesus says the rich man in hell retained
[28:55] his unreasonable conviction
[28:57] that his brothers would repent and be
[28:59] saved if they saw miracles
[29:01] but abraham corrected him saying his
[29:03] brothers would not believe a miracle
[29:05] if they would not hearken to moses law
[29:08] witnessing a miracle doesn't save a
[29:09] person's soul
[29:10] faith and repentance lead to salvation
[29:14] third holy ghost-filled believers
[29:16] receive a new celestial
[29:18] or heavenly body also called a theophany
[29:21] after death
[29:22] paul in second corinthians 5 verses 1
[29:25] through 8
[29:26] says our celestial bodies await us and
[29:28] are eternal in the heavens
[29:30] a perfect sinless theophany body awaits
[29:33] every holy ghost-filled christian
[29:35] paul says we groan earnestly desiring to
[29:38] be clothed upon with our house
[29:40] which is from heaven christians long to
[29:43] live
[29:44] in an eternally pure and holy body
[29:47] the apostle likens this eternal body as
[29:49] clothing
[29:50] without the baptism of the holy ghost a
[29:52] soul is naked before
[29:54] god void of god's own life second
[29:57] corinthians 5
[29:58] 3 states if so be that being clothed
[30:01] we shall not be found naked the saved
[30:05] under the altar of god
[30:06] faithful jews and christians who are not
[30:08] born again will be void of a celestial
[30:10] body
[30:11] but will be given it later at the white
[30:13] throne judgment
[30:15] fourth holy ghost filled believers are
[30:17] present with the lord after leaving
[30:19] their mortal bodies
[30:20] paul writes we are confident i say
[30:24] and willing rather to be absent from the
[30:26] body and to be present with the lord
[30:29] it is uncertain how much or how often
[30:31] you will see jesus
[30:32] as he is constantly making intercession
[30:34] for saints behind the veil
[30:37] but we will be present with him
[30:38] nonetheless according to paul
[30:41] obviously time moves differently in the
[30:43] heavenly dimensions
[30:44] as god created time and works
[30:46] sovereignly within it
[30:47] not being bound by it fifth you'll
[30:50] reunite with saved family members and
[30:52] recognize
[30:53] other believers you've never met before
[30:56] concerning family reunions
[30:58] after the death of the newborn child
[31:00] produced through david and bathsheba's
[31:02] adulterous act
[31:03] david said i shall go to him but he
[31:06] shall not return to me
[31:08] this is a great consolation to any
[31:09] parent who has lost a child through
[31:11] tragedies like diseases
[31:13] accidents miscarriages and more
[31:16] as a believer you'll instantly recognize
[31:18] saints who live before you
[31:20] during the mount transfiguration vision
[31:22] in matthew 17
[31:24] peter james and john recognized moses
[31:27] and elijah
[31:28] men who lived 1500 and 900 years
[31:32] beforehand
[31:33] respectively matthew 27 53 says
[31:37] after jesus's resurrection many of the
[31:39] old testament saints raised with him
[31:41] and went into the holy city and appeared
[31:44] unto many
[31:46] for certain god's spirit within you will
[31:48] cause you to know
[31:49] another believer who possesses the holy
[31:51] spirit
[31:53] lastly believers will bask in and join
[31:56] in the angels
[31:57] unceasing worship and glory revelation 4
[32:00] verse 8 says the four beasts
[32:02] rest not day and night saying holy holy
[32:04] holy
[32:05] lord god almighty which was and is and
[32:08] is to come
[32:09] christ is the focus and recipient of
[32:12] this devoted worship
[32:13] he alone is worthy to receive all praise
[32:16] loud voices exclaim
[32:18] worthy is the lamb that was slain to
[32:19] receive power
[32:21] and riches and wisdom and strength and
[32:24] honor and glory
[32:25] and blessing in stark contrast
[32:28] unbelievers and even a group of fallen
[32:31] angels
[32:32] suffer torment by flames in the darkness
[32:35] of hell
[32:35] awaiting judgment
[32:39] god's righteous judgment based upon
[32:41] inherent knowledge
[32:43] building upon the fifth seal god's
[32:45] righteous judgment based upon
[32:47] each person's inherent knowledge
[32:49] supports the truth
[32:50] that blinded jews can be given eternal
[32:53] life
[32:54] the fifth seal tells us blinded jews are
[32:56] saved because god helped them
[32:58] have an overcoming testimony revelation
[33:01] 12
[33:01] 11 reiterates this saying they overcame
[33:04] him
[33:05] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[33:07] of their testimony
[33:09] it's true all are saved by grace through
[33:11] faith
[33:12] but god honors a person's choice for he
[33:15] cannot force anyone to accept grace and
[33:17] faith
[33:18] each person's free moral agency either
[33:21] accepts
[33:22] or rejects faith after accepting a
[33:24] believer has a testimony
[33:26] report or witness in both heaven and
[33:29] earth
[33:30] in the case of blinded jews they could
[33:32] only understand the old testament
[33:34] and god will judge them accordingly if
[33:36] they accepted faith in god's covenant
[33:38] like noah abraham moses and others
[33:42] they will be saved rotating to a broader
[33:45] perspective
[33:46] all humanity will be judged by what they
[33:48] knew about god
[33:49] and how they reacted to it men can also
[33:52] be judged by what they didn't know
[33:54] if they failed to seek god for it
[33:56] scripture calls this sin
[33:58] neglect as both salvation and a person's
[34:01] individual gifts from god
[34:03] can be neglected christ's words in
[34:05] matthew 25 verses 20 and 21
[34:08] and luke 12 verses 47 and 48
[34:11] declare a person as rewarded or judged
[34:14] based upon their actions
[34:15] in response to their knowledge of god's
[34:17] will jesus said the following to the
[34:20] servant who doubled his five talents
[34:22] well done thou good and faithful servant
[34:25] thou hast been faithful over a few
[34:27] things
[34:27] i will make thee ruler over many things
[34:30] this good servant knew what christ
[34:32] wanted done
[34:33] and did it well so he was rewarded with
[34:35] responsibility
[34:36] for many things luke 12 verses 47 and 48
[34:41] say there are punishments for those who
[34:43] knew god's will
[34:44] and refused to do it and those who
[34:46] didn't know god's will
[34:48] it's easy to understand punishments for
[34:50] those who purposely refuse god's will
[34:53] jesus affirms this in matthew 7 verse 21
[34:56] saying only those who do the will of god
[34:58] enter heaven
[35:00] why would christ punish someone who
[35:02] didn't know his will
[35:04] the answer is the group had the
[35:05] opportunity but never asked god to know
[35:08] his progressive
[35:09] or future will see chapter 11.
[35:12] they cared so little about spiritual
[35:14] things they never took time to
[35:16] pray and seek god the reality is that
[35:19] all who want to know god
[35:20] on every continent in every language can
[35:23] know him
[35:24] every person has an awareness of god and
[35:27] a spiritual thirst for him
[35:29] christ promised all who asked would
[35:31] receive
[35:32] luke 11 verse 10 reads for everyone that
[35:35] asketh receiveth
[35:37] and he that seeketh findeth and to him
[35:39] that knocketh
[35:40] it shall be opened it's jesus's
[35:43] unveiling promise to reward
[35:45] everyone who seeks him romans 2 verses
[35:48] 14 and 15
[35:50] teaches a universal responsibility to
[35:52] god's law
[35:53] paul says god wrote his law upon every
[35:56] man's conscience
[35:58] therefore all men are without excuse on
[36:00] judgment day
[36:01] because of two things god's inward law
[36:04] manifest
[36:05] in them and the witness of god's power
[36:08] in creation
[36:10] in each soul is the god knowledge of
[36:12] good and evil
[36:13] each soul observes the undeniable power
[36:16] and beauty
[36:17] of god's creation and must choose
[36:19] whether to respond in love
[36:20] and appreciation or hatred and
[36:23] skepticism
[36:25] blinded jews from the days of jesus's
[36:27] earthly ministry
[36:28] through today will be fairly judged by
[36:31] the law of moses they heard
[36:33] not jesus's teaching if they were
[36:35] ignorant of it
[36:36] each person being judged by their
[36:38] knowledge will get a fair trial
[36:40] from the righteous one god's covenants
[36:43] with israel through abraham
[36:46] as seen in the fifth seal god mercifully
[36:48] grants blinded jews eternal life
[36:50] because of his covenants with abraham
[36:52] and his offspring
[36:53] israel genesis 12 verses 1 through 9
[36:58] records god's unfailing promises to
[37:00] abraham
[37:01] his family's possession of canaan's land
[37:03] and the blessings for every nation
[37:05] abraham and his seed are god's chosen
[37:08] people perpetually
[37:09] and through their family the entire
[37:11] world is blessed
[37:13] undoubtedly the amount of blessings
[37:15] within the covenant were based upon
[37:16] conditions
[37:17] as genesis 18 verse 19 says abraham's
[37:21] children after
[37:22] him must keep the way of the lord that
[37:24] the lord may bring upon abraham
[37:26] that which he hath spoken of him god
[37:29] foreknew the small remnant of abraham's
[37:31] seed
[37:31] he could use to fulfill his promises
[37:34] deuteronomy 11 verses 26 through 28
[37:38] records god's conditional promises
[37:40] spoken with if
[37:42] as moses ministers to abraham's seed
[37:45] behold i set before you this day a
[37:48] blessing and a curse
[37:49] a blessing if you obey the commandments
[37:51] of the lord your god
[37:53] which i command you this day and a curse
[37:56] if you will not obey the commandments of
[37:57] the lord your god
[37:58] but turn aside out of the way which i
[38:00] command you this day
[38:02] to go after other gods which ye have not
[38:04] known
[38:06] a thousand years after abraham his seed
[38:08] israel
[38:09] possessed the promised land yet they
[38:12] corrupted themselves through idolatry
[38:14] abraham seed erroneously said god had
[38:17] forsaken them
[38:18] and forgotten about them but the israeli
[38:20] prophet isaiah
[38:22] recorded jehovah's comforting words for
[38:24] the rebellious people
[38:25] in isaiah 49 verses 13 through 16.
[38:30] sing o heavens and be joyful o earth
[38:33] and break forth into singing o mountains
[38:36] for the lord hath comforted his people
[38:38] and will have mercy upon his afflicted
[38:40] but zion said
[38:41] the lord hath forsaken me and my lord
[38:44] hath forgotten me
[38:45] can a woman forget her suckling child
[38:48] that she should not have compassion on
[38:50] the son of her womb
[38:51] yea they may forget yet i will not
[38:54] forget thee
[38:55] behold i have graven thee upon the palms
[38:58] of my hands
[38:59] thy walls are continually before me
[39:02] god promises israel he can never forsake
[39:05] nor forget them
[39:06] by saying they are engraved upon his
[39:08] hands jesus's nail prince
[39:11] which thomas needed to see to believe in
[39:13] his resurrection
[39:15] would be god's proof of his unfailing
[39:17] covenant with israel
[39:18] the cross proves that his faithfulness
[39:20] and compassion
[39:22] is strong like a nursing mother's love
[39:24] for her baby
[39:25] even in the midst of israel's rebellion
[39:28] a mother's love is deep
[39:29] but there could be no deeper devoted
[39:31] love than
[39:32] jesus dying in our place 200 years after
[39:36] isaiah
[39:37] the prophet jeremiah reiterated god's
[39:40] faithful love for israel
[39:41] in beautiful terms jeremiah 31
[39:44] verses 31-34 records god's promise to
[39:48] give
[39:48] israel new covenant which was preached
[39:50] by jesus and his disciples
[39:53] afterwards jeremiah declared israel
[39:55] would never cease from being god's
[39:57] nation
[39:57] and he'd never cast them off thus saith
[40:00] the lord
[40:01] which giveth the sun for a light by day
[40:03] and the ordinances of the moon and of
[40:05] the stars for a light by night
[40:07] which divideth the sea when the waves
[40:09] thereof roar the lord of hosts is his
[40:11] name
[40:12] if those ordinances depart from before
[40:14] me saith the lord
[40:16] then the seed of israel also shall cease
[40:18] from being a nation before me forever
[40:20] thus saith the lord if heaven above can
[40:22] be measured and the foundations of the
[40:25] earth
[40:25] searched out beneath i will also cast
[40:28] off all the seed of israel
[40:29] for all that they have done saith the
[40:31] lord
[40:33] god attempts to convince backslidden
[40:35] israel of his love
[40:37] by referencing the steadfastness of the
[40:39] sunlight
[40:40] moon stars and oceans since these
[40:44] ordinances never cease
[40:45] god's love for israel will never cease
[40:48] if anyone is able to measure the heavens
[40:50] god will cast off israel but as the
[40:53] heavens are immeasurable
[40:54] so is god's love for abraham's seed
[40:56] israel
[40:58] indeed god's unconditional love for
[41:00] israel will be strong enough to grant
[41:02] salvation
[41:03] even to blinded jews
[41:07] covenants testaments and the gentile
[41:09] time period
[41:10] examining god's covenants testaments and
[41:13] the times of the gentiles
[41:15] will help you understand his dealings
[41:17] with all mankind
[41:18] in particularly the nation of israel it
[41:21] is the immutable power of god's
[41:23] covenants
[41:23] that allows even blinded israelis to be
[41:26] saved
[41:28] beginning with covenants and testaments
[41:30] these two words are synonymous
[41:32] meaning a compact or league the old
[41:35] testament uses only covenant
[41:37] never uses testament in the king james a
[41:40] total of 256 times
[41:42] the new testament uses both covenant and
[41:45] testament
[41:46] 24 and 13 times respectively
[41:49] the same greek word diotheky meaning
[41:52] arrangement a compact a covenant a
[41:54] testament
[41:56] is interpreted as both covenant and
[41:57] testament repeatedly in the new
[42:00] testament christians sometimes use
[42:03] dispensation
[42:04] and covenant interchangeably but their
[42:06] meanings are different
[42:08] dispensation's modern definition is a
[42:11] system of government at a particular
[42:13] time
[42:14] but in the greek lexicon a dispensation
[42:16] is a stewardship
[42:18] or an overseeing job the same greek word
[42:21] for dispensation is also used for
[42:23] stewardship
[42:24] in jesus's parable of the unjust steward
[42:27] in luke 16
[42:28] verses 1-13 on the other hand a covenant
[42:32] is a compact
[42:33] or agreement some say there are multiple
[42:37] dispensations throughout human history
[42:39] and that is true if one is using the
[42:41] modern definition of dispensation
[42:44] but not true if using the scriptural one
[42:47] the king james mentions the word
[42:49] dispensation four times
[42:51] and paul is the only bible writer who
[42:53] uses it
[42:54] three of these verses point to one
[42:56] dispensation
[42:57] that belonged to paul the gentile
[42:59] dispensation of the gospel of jesus
[43:01] christ
[43:02] the subject of paul's dispensation is
[43:04] covered in chapter 3.
[43:07] the fourth mention of dispensation in
[43:09] ephesians 1 verse 10
[43:11] speaks of god gathering everything in
[43:13] christ in the dispensation of the
[43:15] fullness of times
[43:17] paul says god has one dispensation or
[43:20] oversight
[43:21] of all time periods and he'll gather
[43:23] everything together in christ
[43:25] in the new jerusalem when all heaven and
[43:27] earth are subject to him
[43:29] returning to covenants paul points out
[43:31] god has multiple covenants
[43:33] not just one romans 9 verse 4 says
[43:36] who are israelites to whom pertaineth
[43:39] the adoption
[43:40] and the glory and the covenants and the
[43:42] giving of the law
[43:43] and the service of god and the promises
[43:46] again in ephesians 2 verse 12 he writes
[43:49] that at the time you were without christ
[43:52] being aliens from the commonwealth of
[43:54] israel and strangers from the covenants
[43:56] of promise
[43:57] having no hope and without god in the
[43:59] world
[44:00] how many covenants has god made with man
[44:04] scripture names eight covenants
[44:05] initiated by god and granted to man
[44:08] each covenant or compact established a
[44:11] new beginning for a group of people
[44:13] and is a further expression of god's
[44:15] love grace
[44:16] and faithfulness in biblical numerology
[44:19] the number eight represents new creation
[44:22] or new beginning as seen in the
[44:23] following examples
[44:25] god saved eight souls by water during
[44:27] the flood and gave humanity a new
[44:30] beginning
[44:30] in genesis 8 verse 18 and first peter 3
[44:34] 20. every male hebrew was circumcised on
[44:37] the eighth day
[44:38] representing their new beginning as part
[44:40] of abraham's covenant
[44:42] in genesis 17 verse 12.
[44:46] god forgave israel through sacrificial
[44:48] atonement
[44:49] giving them a new beginning as the glory
[44:51] of god fell on the eighth day of
[44:53] sacrificing
[44:54] in leviticus 9 verses 1 through 24
[44:58] a leper was declared clean at the door
[45:00] of the congregation
[45:02] on the eighth day of his or her recovery
[45:05] a new beginning of cleanliness
[45:07] in leviticus 14 verses 10 and 11.
[45:10] israel held a holy convocation or sacred
[45:13] assembly
[45:14] as an extra sabbath day on the eighth
[45:16] day of the feast of tabernacles
[45:18] to mark the beginning of the civil year
[45:21] leviticus chapter
[45:22] 23 verses 33-44
[45:26] david the youngest and eighth son was
[45:28] chosen by god as a man after god's heart
[45:31] to give israel a new beginning after
[45:33] king saul's failure
[45:35] in 1st samuel 13 14 and first samuel 16
[45:39] verses 10 and 11.
[45:42] paralyzed aeneas was healed by peter
[45:45] in the eighth year of his infirmity as a
[45:47] new beginning of sound health
[45:49] in acts 9 33 paul lists eight things to
[45:54] meditate upon
[45:55] in order to renew your mind in
[45:57] philippians 4
[45:58] verse 8. charity is the eighth and final
[46:01] attribute
[46:02] in the stature of a perfect man that
[46:04] makes you a new creature
[46:05] in christ jesus according to second
[46:08] corinthians 5
[46:09] 17 and 2 peter 1 verses 5 through 7.
[46:14] the late baptist minister clarence
[46:16] larkin 1850-1924
[46:20] contributed much to the church's
[46:21] understanding of the eight covenants in
[46:24] his book
[46:24] dispensational truths some but not
[46:28] all of the following covenant details
[46:30] are referenced from larkin's great work
[46:32] for all eight covenants you discover
[46:34] when they were initiated
[46:36] their commands and conditions and their
[46:38] unique signs
[46:40] the edenic covenant is the first
[46:42] covenant found in genesis 1
[46:44] verses 26 and 30 and genesis 2
[46:48] verses 15-25
[46:51] god initiated this covenant with adam
[46:52] and eve before sin
[46:54] entered humanity the first two unclothed
[46:57] humans
[46:58] lived in complete innocence and
[47:00] obedience as god graciously commanded
[47:02] them to reproduce and fill the earth
[47:04] with people
[47:05] subdue the earth and keep the garden and
[47:08] have dominion over the fish
[47:10] birds and all other living creatures man
[47:13] and animal were both limited to a
[47:14] vegetable diet
[47:17] the only condition for this holy
[47:18] covenant was adam and eve's
[47:20] abstinence from eating from the tree of
[47:22] knowledge of good and evil
[47:24] chapter 9 reveals the true identity of
[47:26] the forbidden fruit
[47:28] it was not a physical fruit and god's
[47:30] secret behind the real identity of the
[47:32] two trees
[47:33] tree of life and tree of knowledge of
[47:35] good and evil
[47:37] as long as the couple kept this
[47:38] condition eternal life and peace was
[47:41] theirs
[47:41] within their bodies after eve was
[47:45] beguiled or deceived by the serpent
[47:47] into eating the forbidden fruit adam
[47:49] willingly sinned by partaking of the
[47:51] forbidden
[47:52] fruit plunging humanity into sin slavery
[47:55] to the devil ii peter 2 19 says
[47:58] for of whom a man is overcome of the
[48:01] same as he brought in bondage
[48:03] paul calls satan the god of this world
[48:06] in second corinthians 4 verse 4
[48:08] and this was the moment he took that
[48:10] title
[48:11] after adam broke god's covenant the
[48:13] blessing of eternal life
[48:15] inside their bodies ended and death set
[48:17] in
[48:18] god drove adam and eve out of the garden
[48:20] and set cherubims
[48:22] with flaming swords to keep mankind from
[48:25] accessing the tree of life
[48:27] still the covenant's commands remained
[48:29] to reproduce
[48:30] subdue the earth and have dominion over
[48:33] all living things
[48:35] these covenant commands continue
[48:37] unending
[48:38] throughout all covenants including the
[48:40] eternal covenant
[48:41] because the eighth mirrors the sinless
[48:43] condition of the first
[48:45] the only difference is the eternal has
[48:47] no conditions
[48:48] since satan and sin are annihilated
[48:52] the adamic covenant is the second
[48:55] covenant found in genesis 3
[48:57] verses 14-24 it was initiated by god's
[49:01] own animal
[49:02] sacrifice to make atonement for adam and
[49:04] eve's sin
[49:05] before sending them out of the garden
[49:07] god made coats of skins to cover adam
[49:09] and eve's
[49:10] newly discovered nakedness here adam and
[49:13] his offspring learned
[49:15] without shedding of blood there is no
[49:16] remission of sin
[49:18] by faith adam abel and their godly
[49:21] offspring
[49:22] understood how to offer offerings and
[49:24] gifts to god
[49:26] in this covenant god commanded curses
[49:28] and consequences for the serpent's
[49:30] beguiling
[49:31] and adam and eve's disobedience the
[49:34] serpent is cursed above all cattle and
[49:35] beasts
[49:36] forced to go upon his belly and eat dust
[49:39] note the serpent was an
[49:40] upright standing creature before this
[49:43] curse
[49:44] while speaking to the serpent in genesis
[49:46] 3 verse 15
[49:47] god places enmity or hatred between he
[49:50] and the woman
[49:51] and their separate offsprings most
[49:53] importantly
[49:54] god declares the first prophecy of the
[49:56] cross of jesus christ
[49:58] four thousand years in advance promising
[50:01] a member of eve's seed
[50:02] would bruise the serpent's head while
[50:04] the serpent would bruise his heel
[50:07] jesus indeed began to destroy the works
[50:10] of the devil
[50:11] and his resurrection was a public
[50:12] triumph over every demon
[50:14] foe the genesis 3 verse 15 foretelling
[50:18] is expounded upon and fulfilled through
[50:20] four future covenants
[50:22] abrahamic mosaic davidic
[50:25] and the new covenant eve's not cursed
[50:29] but her consequences are multiplied in
[50:32] sorrow in conception
[50:33] and bringing forth children additionally
[50:36] her desire
[50:37] or longing is to be to her husband which
[50:39] means her desire was previously for
[50:41] someone other than her husband
[50:43] the serpent her last consequence is her
[50:46] husband will rule over her
[50:48] meaning adam is the leader in their
[50:49] marriage and she is under submission to
[50:51] him
[50:52] as taught in the new testament as well
[50:55] like eve
[50:56] adam's not cursed but the ground is
[50:58] cursed for his sake
[51:00] adam would bring forth food through
[51:01] sorrowful sweaty
[51:03] hard work battling thorns and thistles
[51:07] all conditions of the commands from this
[51:09] covenant remain to this day
[51:11] god's promise to send christ to bruise
[51:13] the serpent's head
[51:14] is his ultimate expression of love to us
[51:17] but god commendeth his love toward us in
[51:20] that
[51:20] while we were yet sinners christ died
[51:23] for us
[51:25] the adamic covenant is fulfilled and
[51:27] ends
[51:28] when the eternal covenant begins because
[51:30] it seems the inhabitants of the earth
[51:33] during the millennium will still be
[51:34] farming and working the land
[51:37] it also seems deaths still occur
[51:41] the noahic covenant is the third
[51:43] covenant found in genesis 8
[51:45] verses 20 through chapter 9 verse 17.
[51:49] nearly 1700 years after the adamic
[51:53] covenant the lord initiated this
[51:55] covenant
[51:56] immediately following noah's sweet
[51:57] smelling burnt offerings
[51:59] when he left the ark the lord's covenant
[52:02] is between him and all living things
[52:05] man and animals he promises never to
[52:08] curse the ground again
[52:09] nor smite every living thing through a
[52:11] flood but god will smite again all
[52:14] living things with fire
[52:15] in preparation for the eighth covenant
[52:18] according to second peter 3
[52:19] verse 10 but the day of the lord will
[52:22] come as a thief in the night
[52:23] in the which the heavens shall pass away
[52:25] with the great noise
[52:27] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[52:29] heat the earth also
[52:30] and the works that are therein shall be
[52:32] burned up
[52:34] god blesses noah and his sons by
[52:36] reaffirming the
[52:37] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[52:40] the earth command
[52:41] he previously gave in the edenic
[52:44] covenant
[52:45] animals will continue to fear and dread
[52:47] mankind as man's dominion over all
[52:50] living things
[52:50] continues a new diet is allowed by god
[52:54] previously mankind were vegetarians man
[52:57] can now eat the flesh
[52:58] of animals but must abstain from eating
[53:00] their blood
[53:02] god also commands capital punishment to
[53:05] be established in human government
[53:07] in genesis 9 verse 6 saying whoso
[53:10] sheddeth man's blood by man shall his
[53:13] blood he
[53:13] shed for in the image of god made he man
[53:17] this law is carried out using much
[53:19] discretion in the fear of the lord
[53:22] as both moses and david killed men david
[53:25] indirectly killed uriah
[53:27] and yet god let them live romans 13
[53:30] verse 4
[53:31] shows capital punishment remaining in
[53:33] the new testament
[53:35] to conclude this covenant god provides
[53:37] the first token
[53:38] or sign for a covenant the rainbow
[53:42] the bow will be in the clouds and god
[53:44] will remember his covenant with man
[53:46] and all living things to never destroy
[53:48] the earth again
[53:49] through a flood all commands and
[53:51] conditions of the noah
[53:53] covenant remain to this day but it ends
[53:56] when the eternal covenant begins
[53:58] for there is no more death
[54:01] the abrahamic covenant is the fourth
[54:03] covenant found in genesis 12
[54:05] verses 1 through 3 and genesis 17 verses
[54:09] 9-14
[54:11] about 400 years after noah's covenant
[54:14] god initiated this covenant with abraham
[54:17] and his offspring only previous
[54:19] covenants were promises to all mankind
[54:22] but here god focuses on one family
[54:25] god confirmed his covenant with abraham
[54:27] through a blood sacrifice in genesis 15.
[54:31] even after abraham's death he visited
[54:33] abraham's son
[54:34] isaac and grandson jacob in order to
[54:37] confirm
[54:38] this covenant with their family the lord
[54:40] then focused in on one group of people
[54:43] to make a great nation through his
[54:44] holiness shortly after mankind's
[54:47] complete defiance
[54:48] at the tower of babel through the
[54:50] abrahamic covenant god created two
[54:52] groups of people
[54:54] jews and gentiles jews are descendants
[54:57] of abraham as the word jew
[54:59] is short for judah the tribe named after
[55:01] the great grandson of abraham
[55:04] gentiles encompass all other nations
[55:07] peoples
[55:07] and tongues the lord promised abraham to
[55:11] make a great nation of his seed
[55:13] make his name great bless him and all
[55:15] that bless him
[55:16] curse those who curse him and make him a
[55:19] blessing to all families of the earth
[55:21] like the noahic covenant the lord
[55:24] assigns a token for abraham's covenant
[55:26] but it is not in nature like the rainbow
[55:29] his everlasting token
[55:30] is in their flesh male circumcision
[55:34] abraham's covenant has supernaturally
[55:36] shaped and transformed human history
[55:38] during the seven years of famine in
[55:40] genesis 41
[55:41] egypt was blessed and spared from
[55:43] destitution
[55:44] because they blessed joseph abraham's
[55:47] great-great-grandson
[55:49] under the faithful leadership of moses
[55:51] joshua david and solomon
[55:53] many of israel's enemies were cursed and
[55:55] defeated helping to make the nation
[55:57] independent and powerful in modern
[56:00] history
[56:01] the united states has become the world's
[56:03] superpower because of its
[56:04] judeo-christian foundation
[56:06] and initial adherence to god's laws the
[56:10] constitution and bill of rights
[56:11] are heavily influenced by the torah and
[56:14] pauline epistles
[56:16] america's prosperity has overflowed into
[56:19] nearly every other nation
[56:20] in part because of her continued support
[56:23] for israel
[56:24] although other nations have their needs
[56:26] met few experience the vast levels of
[56:28] freedom
[56:29] and prosperity as americans
[56:32] the nation of israel continues to
[56:34] experience prosperity and innovation
[56:36] because of god's faithfulness to
[56:38] abraham's covenant
[56:39] since becoming re-established as a
[56:41] sovereign state in 1948
[56:44] israel has grown into a world leader in
[56:46] patents
[56:47] research entrepreneurship and innovation
[56:51] in recent years all men witness israel's
[56:54] innovation story
[56:55] is extraordinary chapter 3 expounds on
[56:59] god
[56:59] mysteriously and graciously opening up
[57:02] this covenant to the gentiles
[57:04] as faith in christ makes a believer
[57:06] abraham's
[57:07] spiritual seed israel is abraham's
[57:10] natural seed or offspring
[57:12] faith in jesus christ makes a believing
[57:14] jew or gentile
[57:16] a member of abraham's spiritual seed
[57:18] galatians 3
[57:19] 7 proclaims know ye therefore that they
[57:22] which are of faith
[57:23] the same are the children of abraham
[57:26] since abraham's true seed is spiritual
[57:29] the circumcision token
[57:30] is now spiritual paul calls it the
[57:33] inward
[57:34] circumcision of the heart in romans 2
[57:37] verse 29
[57:39] all conditions and commands from this
[57:41] covenant remain to this day
[57:43] however as great as the abrahamic
[57:45] covenant was and
[57:46] is it lacks a solution to man's sin
[57:50] problem
[57:51] the answer is total forgiveness through
[57:53] jesus's blood
[57:54] the greatest of all blessings two
[57:56] covenants though
[57:57] preceded the new with important purposes
[58:01] the abrahamic covenant began some 1900
[58:05] years before christ
[58:07] and ends when the eternal covenant
[58:09] begins because its purpose will be
[58:11] fulfilled
[58:12] all alive then will already be eternally
[58:15] blessed
[58:15] with eternal life the mosaic covenant is
[58:19] the fifth covenant found in exodus
[58:21] chapters
[58:22] 20 through 40 and deuteronomy 30 verses
[58:26] 1 through 10.
[58:27] about 400 years after abraham god
[58:30] initiated this covenant with israel
[58:32] generally referred to as the law through
[58:35] moses on mount sinai
[58:37] in exodus 24 moses sprinkles the people
[58:39] with blood
[58:40] and joining them to god's covenant moses
[58:44] law can be divided into three groups
[58:46] moral ten commandments civil
[58:50] between hebrews and ceremonial levitical
[58:53] priesthood
[58:54] the ceremonial law includes the creation
[58:56] of a priesthood
[58:57] to order worship in the tabernacle god
[59:00] called
[59:01] israel to be a kingdom of priests
[59:04] the ark of the covenant symbolizes this
[59:06] covenant representing the presence of
[59:08] god
[59:09] aaron's rod that budded a pot of manna
[59:12] and moses's two tables of commandments
[59:14] were placed inside the ark these three
[59:17] articles foretold the new testament
[59:19] blessings
[59:20] of resurrection believing the original
[59:22] truth
[59:23] and the holy ghost seal respectively
[59:26] like the two previous covenants this
[59:28] oath has a sign
[59:30] sabbath keeping israelis worked for six
[59:32] days of the week
[59:33] but were forbidden to work on the
[59:35] seventh because the lord made the earth
[59:37] in six days
[59:38] and rested on the seventh the entire
[59:41] chapter of deuteronomy 30
[59:43] expresses god's unfailing commitment to
[59:45] israel
[59:46] despite his foreknowledge of her
[59:48] idolatry causing her to be scattered all
[59:50] over the world
[59:51] and rejecting the forthcoming messiah
[59:54] god promises to gather
[59:56] israel from all nations giving her a
[59:58] heart that completely loves him
[1:00:00] and causing her to forever possess the
[1:00:02] land of israel
[1:00:04] this covenant's purpose is described by
[1:00:06] paul in galatians 3 verse 24 as
[1:00:09] our schoolmaster to bring us to christ
[1:00:12] the law teaches how inherently evil we
[1:00:15] are
[1:00:15] to a holy god our sins demand a just
[1:00:18] penalty
[1:00:19] death truly the law was added because of
[1:00:23] transgressions
[1:00:24] the law was holy and just and good but
[1:00:28] also carried
[1:00:28] an insurmountable curse breaking one
[1:00:31] command
[1:00:32] imputed to you the same guilt as
[1:00:34] breaking all the commands
[1:00:36] james 2 verse 10 explains for whosoever
[1:00:39] shall keep the whole law
[1:00:40] and yet offended one point he is guilty
[1:00:43] of all
[1:00:45] all five offerings sin peace
[1:00:48] meal trespass and burnt and the vast
[1:00:52] amount required of each
[1:00:53] point us to a desperately needed once
[1:00:56] and for all sacrifice
[1:00:57] to put away all sin the law would
[1:01:00] continue
[1:01:01] till the seed should come the promised
[1:01:03] seed of the woman
[1:01:04] genesis 3 15 in the adamic covenant
[1:01:09] our need is fully satisfied in the new
[1:01:11] covenant through the death and
[1:01:12] resurrection
[1:01:13] of jesus christ leviticus 26
[1:01:17] verses 41 and 42 highlights the
[1:01:20] principle
[1:01:20] that god's former covenant blessings
[1:01:23] remain true
[1:01:24] even in the current covenant god told
[1:01:26] israel through moses
[1:01:28] that they would possess the promised
[1:01:29] land but then fall away from his
[1:01:31] commands
[1:01:32] causing him to scatter israel among
[1:01:34] heathen nations
[1:01:36] but he promised to restore them to
[1:01:37] living in palestine when they confess
[1:01:40] their sins in humility
[1:01:41] israel's genuine repentance will cause
[1:01:43] god to say
[1:01:45] then will i remember my covenant with
[1:01:46] jacob and also my covenant with isaac
[1:01:49] and also my covenant with abraham will i
[1:01:51] remember and i will remember the land
[1:01:55] god forever remembers his promises even
[1:01:57] during the period of moses covenant
[1:02:00] god still remembers and keeps the
[1:02:01] abrahamic covenant
[1:02:03] to give abraham seed the land of
[1:02:05] palestine
[1:02:06] based upon the condition of their humble
[1:02:08] obedience
[1:02:10] israel's humble confession of sin and
[1:02:12] subsequent possession of all of
[1:02:14] palestine
[1:02:15] is yet in the future to be fulfilled by
[1:02:17] the 144 thousand
[1:02:19] spirit-filled jews spoken of in
[1:02:22] revelation seven
[1:02:23] verses one through eight this mosaic
[1:02:26] covenant
[1:02:26] is the current covenant blinded israel
[1:02:28] is under at this moment
[1:02:30] because they rejected the new covenant
[1:02:32] preached by jesus
[1:02:34] peter paul and other remnant jews who
[1:02:37] accepted christ
[1:02:38] despite casting away the new covenant in
[1:02:40] the first century blinded israel retains
[1:02:43] god's blessings
[1:02:44] from all previous covenants mosaic
[1:02:47] abrahamic
[1:02:48] noic adamic and edenic
[1:02:52] any blinded jew will receive god's
[1:02:54] covenant blessings if he sincerely loves
[1:02:57] god
[1:02:57] and obeys him god cannot cast away all
[1:03:00] israel
[1:03:01] because he promised to bless and never
[1:03:03] forget faithful jews
[1:03:05] and he will keep his word the mosaic
[1:03:08] covenant began around
[1:03:09] 1 500 years before christ
[1:03:12] and ended at jesus resurrection for
[1:03:15] jesus followers
[1:03:17] romans 8 verse 4 explains christians
[1:03:20] observe and obey the righteousness of
[1:03:22] the law
[1:03:22] or moral commandments of the law through
[1:03:25] the holy spirit's power
[1:03:26] in the new covenant the mosaic covenants
[1:03:29] still continues
[1:03:30] though for the faithful blinded jews
[1:03:34] the davidic covenant is the sixth
[1:03:36] covenant found in second samuel 7
[1:03:39] verses 4 through 17 and luke 1 verses
[1:03:42] 30-33 about 500 years after
[1:03:46] moses's covenant god initiates this oath
[1:03:49] to david
[1:03:50] through the prophet nathan just like the
[1:03:53] abrahamic covenant
[1:03:54] god again chooses to deal with one man
[1:03:56] and his offspring
[1:03:58] rather than making a worldwide covenant
[1:04:00] both covenants of abraham and david
[1:04:02] start with one man but extend to bless
[1:04:05] and
[1:04:05] impact the entire world in the davidic
[1:04:09] covenant
[1:04:10] god builds upon the mosaic covenant
[1:04:12] which established the law
[1:04:14] and priesthood through david god
[1:04:16] promises a kingship
[1:04:18] which points to the true king jesus
[1:04:20] christ who will someday
[1:04:22] rule all nations with a rod of iron in
[1:04:24] the millennium
[1:04:25] and new jerusalem nathan tells david god
[1:04:28] will establish the throne
[1:04:30] house and kingdom of his son solomon
[1:04:33] forever
[1:04:34] god says the same in psalms 89 verses 3
[1:04:37] and 4.
[1:04:38] i have made a covenant with my chosen i
[1:04:41] have sworn unto david my servant
[1:04:43] thy seed will i establish forever and
[1:04:45] build up thy throne
[1:04:47] to all generations of course these
[1:04:50] promises were conditional
[1:04:52] and based upon solomon and his son's
[1:04:54] obedience
[1:04:55] as recorded in second chronicles 7
[1:04:58] verses
[1:04:58] 18 through 22 verses 19 and 20 read
[1:05:02] but if ye turn away and forsake my
[1:05:04] statutes and my commandments
[1:05:06] which i have set before you and shall go
[1:05:08] and serve other gods and worship them
[1:05:11] then will i pluck them up by the roots
[1:05:13] out of my land
[1:05:14] which i have given them and this house
[1:05:17] which i have sanctified for my name
[1:05:19] will i cast out of my sight and will
[1:05:21] make it a proverb
[1:05:22] and a byword among all nations
[1:05:26] solomon's sins and the many sins of his
[1:05:28] royal offspring
[1:05:30] eventually turned israel away and god
[1:05:32] plucked up the nation and scattered her
[1:05:34] abroad
[1:05:35] the last king of israel of david's seed
[1:05:38] was zedekiah
[1:05:39] who was expelled from his throne around
[1:05:41] 587 bc
[1:05:43] since that moment there has not been a
[1:05:45] son of david ruling in israel
[1:05:47] god has postponed his promises until
[1:05:50] jesus's second coming
[1:05:52] ezekiel 21 verses 26 and 27
[1:05:55] records this showing how the crown would
[1:05:57] be removed out of israel
[1:05:59] until he come whose right it is until
[1:06:02] jesus returns thus saith the lord god
[1:06:06] remove the diadem and take off the crown
[1:06:09] this shall not be the same
[1:06:10] exalt him that is low and abase him that
[1:06:13] is high
[1:06:14] i will overturn overturn overturn
[1:06:17] it and it shall be no more until he come
[1:06:20] whose right it is and i will give it to
[1:06:23] him
[1:06:24] god will never do away with david's
[1:06:26] house the gracious lord promised to
[1:06:28] preserve the house of david
[1:06:30] because of his covenant promise in
[1:06:32] second chronicles 21
[1:06:34] verse 7 how be it the lord would not
[1:06:36] destroy the house of david
[1:06:38] because of the covenant that he made
[1:06:39] with david and as he promised to give a
[1:06:42] light to him
[1:06:43] and to his sons forever
[1:06:46] jeremiah 33 verses 17-26
[1:06:50] further witnesses god's promises to
[1:06:52] david are steadfast
[1:06:54] god challenges jeremiah's hears to try
[1:06:56] to break the covenant of day and night
[1:06:58] to see if he will break his covenant
[1:07:00] with david certainly
[1:07:02] man cannot alter the repetition of day
[1:07:04] and night and so
[1:07:05] god will never alter his promises to
[1:07:07] david nor can man number the stars
[1:07:10] heavenly hosts and sands of the seas and
[1:07:13] thus man cannot count how greatly
[1:07:15] god will multiply the seed of david a
[1:07:18] few chapters previous to this
[1:07:20] god tells jeremiah he will not cast away
[1:07:22] israel because his faithfulness to them
[1:07:25] is like the continual ordinances of day
[1:07:27] and night moon and stars
[1:07:29] and ocean waves the prophet isaiah and
[1:07:33] angel gabriel
[1:07:34] give us further details about the deeper
[1:07:36] meaning of god's
[1:07:37] forever covenant with david the david
[1:07:40] covenant
[1:07:41] can be fulfilled only through jesus
[1:07:43] christ who came through
[1:07:44] the seed of david according to the flesh
[1:07:47] isaiah 9 verses 6 and 7
[1:07:50] says the messiah will have an unending
[1:07:52] throne and kingdom
[1:07:54] of the increase of his government and
[1:07:56] peace there shall be no end
[1:07:58] upon the throne of david and upon his
[1:08:00] kingdom
[1:08:01] to order it and to establish it with
[1:08:03] judgment and with justice
[1:08:05] from henceforth even forever the angel
[1:08:08] gabriel affirms this telling mary that
[1:08:10] her son jesus
[1:08:12] would be given the throne of his father
[1:08:14] david
[1:08:15] to reign over the house of jacob forever
[1:08:17] with an unending kingdom
[1:08:20] the everlasting throne speaks of jesus
[1:08:22] ruling in the eternal covenant
[1:08:24] in the new jerusalem thus the david
[1:08:27] covenant
[1:08:27] will be renewed once jesus begins
[1:08:30] reigning on the earth
[1:08:31] during the millennium and will continue
[1:08:33] without end throughout eternity
[1:08:36] it is noteworthy that the unending
[1:08:38] throne and kingdom of israel was first
[1:08:40] offered to saul
[1:08:41] but his disobedience and rebellion
[1:08:43] caused god to choose david
[1:08:45] and his seed as the kingly family first
[1:08:48] samuel 13
[1:08:49] 13 reads and samuel said to saul
[1:08:52] thou has done foolishly thou has not
[1:08:54] kept the commandment of the lord thy god
[1:08:57] which he commanded thee for now would
[1:08:59] the lord have established
[1:09:00] thy kingdom upon israel forever only god
[1:09:04] knows the great blessings and rewards
[1:09:06] men lose due to their selfish
[1:09:08] disobedience
[1:09:11] the new covenant is the seventh covenant
[1:09:13] found in jeremiah 31
[1:09:15] verses 31-34 and luke 22
[1:09:19] 20 nearly 1 000 years after the davidic
[1:09:22] covenant
[1:09:23] god institutes this covenant through
[1:09:25] jesus shed blood
[1:09:27] instantly making moses his covenant a
[1:09:29] thing of the past
[1:09:31] the name new covenant contrasts with the
[1:09:34] old covenant
[1:09:35] given to moses hebrews 8 13 reads
[1:09:39] in that he saith a new covenant he hath
[1:09:41] made the first old
[1:09:43] now that which decayeth and waxeth old
[1:09:46] is ready to vanish away
[1:09:48] the law was the old covenant but grace
[1:09:50] is the new covenant
[1:09:52] in luke 22 20 messiah says the cup of
[1:09:55] the lord's supper
[1:09:56] is the new testament in my blood which
[1:09:58] is shed for you
[1:10:00] christ's death through his blood
[1:10:02] sacrifice and his resurrection
[1:10:04] caused this testament to take effect
[1:10:06] according to hebrews 9
[1:10:08] verses 15 through 17. verses 16 and 17
[1:10:12] say this testament went into effect
[1:10:14] after jesus death for where a testament
[1:10:17] is
[1:10:18] there must also of necessity be the
[1:10:20] death of the testator
[1:10:22] for a testament is of force after men
[1:10:24] are dead
[1:10:25] otherwise it is of no strength at all
[1:10:27] while the testator liveth on calvary
[1:10:31] jesus skin was opened up so much that
[1:10:34] his bare bones were exposed
[1:10:36] god's sacrifice had to be torn open to
[1:10:38] institute the new covenant
[1:10:40] because previous covenants were
[1:10:42] confirmed with torn apart sacrifices
[1:10:45] noah and moses offered sacrifices from
[1:10:47] torn beasts
[1:10:48] all five of abraham's sacrifices were
[1:10:51] torn apart before god's spirit
[1:10:53] passed between the pieces the pardoning
[1:10:57] power of jesus's holy
[1:10:59] sinless blood cannot be overemphasized
[1:11:02] while other covenants were confirmed
[1:11:03] with shed blood
[1:11:04] the coats of skins for adam and eve
[1:11:06] noah's burnt offering after exiting the
[1:11:08] ark
[1:11:09] abraham's sacrifice of five divided
[1:11:11] animals and moses is sprinkling the
[1:11:13] people with blood
[1:11:15] only the new covenant completely
[1:11:17] abolishes sin
[1:11:18] and a sinner's guilty conscience the sin
[1:11:21] question
[1:11:22] am i truly forgiven in god's sight is
[1:11:25] settled once and for all
[1:11:26] through jesus's all-sufficient sacrifice
[1:11:29] for those who truly love christ and
[1:11:31] confess their sins
[1:11:33] god forgives all their sins and
[1:11:34] trespasses colossians 2 13
[1:11:37] says he's forgiven you all trespasses
[1:11:41] not some all jesus blood is the perfect
[1:11:45] remedy for sin
[1:11:46] making the new covenant the final
[1:11:48] covenant that requires blood
[1:11:50] the eternal covenant and eden covenant
[1:11:53] are bloodless
[1:11:54] hebrews 13 verses 20 and 21
[1:11:57] says jesus blood is the blood of the
[1:12:00] everlasting covenant
[1:12:01] and makes believers perfect in every
[1:12:04] good work
[1:12:04] to do his will working in you that which
[1:12:07] is well pleasing
[1:12:08] in his sight the benefit and blessing of
[1:12:11] jesus's precious blood
[1:12:13] makes the new covenant a better covenant
[1:12:16] established upon better promises
[1:12:19] each covenant god establishes gets
[1:12:21] progressively greater
[1:12:22] and concerning forgiveness of sins the
[1:12:24] new covenant is god's triumphant
[1:12:26] masterpiece
[1:12:29] accompanying the better promises comes
[1:12:31] greater responsibility for men
[1:12:33] to receive this covenant the consequence
[1:12:35] for turning down such powerful
[1:12:38] sin cleansing blood is sore punishment
[1:12:40] hebrews 10 29 says
[1:12:42] of how much sore punishment suppose ye
[1:12:46] shall he be thought worthy who hath
[1:12:48] trodden underfoot the son of god
[1:12:50] and hath counted the blood of the
[1:12:52] covenant wherewith he was sanctified
[1:12:54] an unholy thing and hath done despite
[1:12:57] unto the spirit of grace
[1:12:59] god's spirit of grace will cause the new
[1:13:01] covenant good news
[1:13:02] to be preached and offered to every
[1:13:04] nation before the end time
[1:13:07] the lord has appointed a day of judgment
[1:13:09] to bring closure to this covenant
[1:13:11] and his son's righteous blood will be
[1:13:13] the standard for judgment
[1:13:15] acts 17 verse 31 promises
[1:13:18] because he hath appointed a day in the
[1:13:21] which he will judge the world in
[1:13:22] righteousness
[1:13:23] by that man whom he hath ordained
[1:13:27] whereof he hath given assurance unto all
[1:13:29] men in that he raised him from the dead
[1:13:33] the baptism of the holy ghost is the
[1:13:35] sign of the new covenant
[1:13:36] also called a seal or mark in the
[1:13:39] believer's soul
[1:13:40] just like the rainbow and circumcision
[1:13:42] were tokens of previous covenants
[1:13:44] the holy ghost seal is the new testament
[1:13:46] token
[1:13:47] unlike the previous covenants the life
[1:13:49] of the sacrifice
[1:13:51] jesus spirit now comes upon the believer
[1:13:55] the new covenant was first sent to
[1:13:57] israel through jesus's earthly ministry
[1:14:00] but most israelis rejected messiah
[1:14:02] becoming spiritually blind
[1:14:05] god for knew israel's future allowing
[1:14:07] him to have mercy upon the gentiles for
[1:14:09] a season
[1:14:10] saving their souls through the new
[1:14:12] covenant see chapter 3
[1:14:14] but the lord promised to return to
[1:14:16] blinded israel and give her another
[1:14:18] chance to receive the new covenant
[1:14:20] shortly after the rapture of the gentile
[1:14:23] church
[1:14:25] it is certain 144 000
[1:14:28] redeemed guileless jews will stand with
[1:14:31] jesus christ
[1:14:32] on mount zion according to revelation 14
[1:14:36] verses 1 through 5. this mountaintop
[1:14:38] experience is preceded by jesus
[1:14:41] revealing his identity to israel causing
[1:14:44] them to mourn in anguish
[1:14:46] upon realizing they crucified their
[1:14:48] messiah two thousand years ago
[1:14:51] zechariah 12 verses 10 through chapter
[1:14:54] 13 verse 1
[1:14:56] says jews will go from house to house
[1:14:58] mourning
[1:14:59] after realizing their ancestors pierce
[1:15:01] jesus
[1:15:02] but then christ opens a fountain of
[1:15:04] grace and forgiveness for them
[1:15:08] then romans 11 verses 26 and 27
[1:15:11] is fulfilled and so all israel shall be
[1:15:14] saved
[1:15:15] as it is written there shall come out of
[1:15:17] zion the deliverer
[1:15:18] and he shall turn away ungodliness from
[1:15:20] jacob for this is my covenant unto them
[1:15:23] when i shall take away their sins
[1:15:27] the new covenant began at jesus
[1:15:28] resurrection and
[1:15:30] ends after the white throne judgment
[1:15:32] because blood for forgiveness is no
[1:15:34] longer needed
[1:15:36] death hell and satan have all been cast
[1:15:38] into the lake of fire
[1:15:40] sin is forever defeated
[1:15:44] the eternal covenant is the eighth
[1:15:46] covenant found in isaiah 65
[1:15:48] 17 and revelation 21 verses 1-5
[1:15:53] god promises this unending covenant as a
[1:15:55] return
[1:15:56] to the sinless conditions of the edenic
[1:15:58] covenant
[1:16:00] god and man will again enjoy close
[1:16:01] fellowship but now it will be impossible
[1:16:04] for it to end because all god's enemies
[1:16:07] are destroyed
[1:16:09] isaiah 65 17 offers the first glimpse of
[1:16:12] this covenant
[1:16:13] saying for behold i create new heavens
[1:16:16] and a new earth
[1:16:17] and the former shall not be remembered
[1:16:20] nor come
[1:16:20] into mind new heavens and a new earth
[1:16:24] simply means renovation and restoration
[1:16:26] it doesn't mean god is going to blow up
[1:16:28] this earth and make a new one
[1:16:30] no god is going to redeem this earth and
[1:16:33] the heavens by holy fire
[1:16:35] second peter 3 verse 10 reads but the
[1:16:37] day of the lord will come as a thief in
[1:16:39] the night
[1:16:40] in which the heaven shall pass away with
[1:16:42] a great noise
[1:16:43] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:16:45] heat the earth also
[1:16:47] and the works that are therein shall be
[1:16:49] burned up
[1:16:51] revelation chapters 21 and 22 build upon
[1:16:55] isaiah's inspired promises
[1:16:57] in breathtaking detail notably
[1:17:00] revelation 21 verses 1
[1:17:02] through 5 says and i saw a new heaven
[1:17:05] and a new earth for the first heaven and
[1:17:07] first earth were passed away
[1:17:09] and there was no more sea and i john saw
[1:17:12] the holy city
[1:17:13] new jerusalem coming down from god out
[1:17:15] of heaven
[1:17:16] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:17:18] husband
[1:17:19] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[1:17:21] saying behold the tabernacle of god is
[1:17:23] with men
[1:17:24] and he will dwell with them and they
[1:17:26] shall be his people
[1:17:28] and god himself shall be with them and
[1:17:30] be their god
[1:17:31] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[1:17:33] their eyes and there shall be no more
[1:17:35] death
[1:17:35] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[1:17:38] there be any more pain
[1:17:40] for the former things are passed away
[1:17:42] and he that sat upon the throne said
[1:17:44] behold
[1:17:45] i make all things new and he said unto
[1:17:47] me right
[1:17:48] for these words are true and faithful
[1:17:52] indeed the new jerusalem is a
[1:17:54] significantly better eden
[1:17:56] compare the two for a moment god's two
[1:17:58] children adam and eve shared a garden
[1:18:01] now god's innumerable children share a
[1:18:04] massive city
[1:18:05] eden had a deadly adversary but new
[1:18:08] jerusalem has only peaceful allies
[1:18:11] satan entered and brought a curse in
[1:18:13] eden but he'll never step foot in the
[1:18:15] new jerusalem
[1:18:16] and there will be no curses there eden
[1:18:19] had a nightfall
[1:18:20] but our future home has no night there
[1:18:23] the lamb
[1:18:24] our day star is the light in that city
[1:18:27] the tree of life was just one of many
[1:18:29] trees in eden
[1:18:30] but here it is elevated above all trees
[1:18:33] to the pinnacle of the city
[1:18:34] and so large until it encompasses both
[1:18:37] sides
[1:18:38] of the pure river of water of life
[1:18:42] this city is divine and unique god is in
[1:18:45] everything
[1:18:46] in this city god is all and in all
[1:18:50] first corinthians 15 28 says and when
[1:18:53] all things shall be subdued unto him
[1:18:55] then shall the son also himself be
[1:18:57] subject
[1:18:58] unto him that put all things under him
[1:19:01] that god may be all in all
[1:19:04] the city's precious stones great high
[1:19:06] wall
[1:19:07] 12 gates 12 foundations and streets of
[1:19:10] pure
[1:19:11] transparent gold all tell god's
[1:19:13] matchless redemption story
[1:19:15] there'll be no need for men to build a
[1:19:17] temple for the lord god almighty and the
[1:19:19] lamb
[1:19:20] are the temple of it peter says the new
[1:19:24] jerusalem
[1:19:24] is the home of holiness he writes
[1:19:27] nevertheless we according to his promise
[1:19:30] look for new heavens and a new earth
[1:19:32] wherein dwelleth righteousness
[1:19:34] finally a kingdom of kindness a reign of
[1:19:37] righteousness
[1:19:38] since you're drawn to this kingdom peter
[1:19:40] asks you to be diligent now
[1:19:42] to live without sin in true holiness
[1:19:45] second peter 3 14
[1:19:46] says wherefore beloved seeing that you
[1:19:49] look for
[1:19:50] such things be diligent that ye may be
[1:19:52] found of him in peace
[1:19:54] without spot and blameless
[1:19:58] daniel's 70 week prophecy many struggle
[1:20:02] to both
[1:20:02] understand the meaning and placement of
[1:20:05] the daniel's 70 weeks prophecy
[1:20:07] yet it directly connects to israel's
[1:20:09] current blindness to the gospel
[1:20:11] where does this prophecy fit in the
[1:20:13] timeline of god's covenants
[1:20:16] due to israel's disobedience in the
[1:20:17] mosaic covenant
[1:20:19] god expelled his people from their land
[1:20:21] into heathen lands
[1:20:22] such as babylon and assyria judah's last
[1:20:26] king zedekiah
[1:20:27] was finally expelled from jerusalem in
[1:20:30] 587 bc
[1:20:31] during the babylonian exile as a young
[1:20:34] man the prophet daniel was one of the
[1:20:36] prisoners led away into captivity
[1:20:38] to babylon despite experiencing constant
[1:20:41] communion with god
[1:20:42] through prayer and seeing his miraculous
[1:20:44] power in being delivered from a den of
[1:20:46] lions
[1:20:48] daniel aged into an old man and yearned
[1:20:50] for the time his people
[1:20:52] would return to their promised land
[1:20:55] in daniel chapter 9 you find daniel
[1:20:57] reading jeremiah's writings see jeremiah
[1:21:00] 25 verses 8 through 14
[1:21:03] and the holy spirit gives him
[1:21:05] understanding that
[1:21:06] israel's 70-year period of expulsion
[1:21:09] from their land
[1:21:10] is coming to an end verses 4 through 19
[1:21:13] record daniels seeking god's face
[1:21:16] through fasting and intercessory prayer
[1:21:19] he begins by worshiping god and thanking
[1:21:21] him for his mercy
[1:21:22] and the keeping of his covenants in
[1:21:24] humility
[1:21:25] the prophet confesses his sins and the
[1:21:28] sins of israel
[1:21:29] specifically stating how they broke
[1:21:31] moses's covenant
[1:21:32] and their just punishment
[1:21:35] the angel gabriel appears to daniel in
[1:21:38] verses 20 through 29
[1:21:40] telling him how he is loved in heaven
[1:21:42] and his prayers were heard
[1:21:44] gabriel also says he is sent to give
[1:21:46] daniel's skill
[1:21:47] and understanding concerning the matter
[1:21:49] of israel's return to judea
[1:21:52] the 70 weeks prophecy includes verses 24
[1:21:55] through 27 70 weeks equals 490 years
[1:22:00] because a week and means seven years
[1:22:03] genesis 29 verse 27
[1:22:05] explains that jacob fulfilled rachel's
[1:22:07] week by working seven
[1:22:09] additional years for the right to marry
[1:22:11] her so 70 weeks means
[1:22:13] 70 times 7 equaling 490 years
[1:22:19] daniel 9 24 introduces the prophecy
[1:22:22] upon thy people jews and upon thy holy
[1:22:25] city
[1:22:26] jerusalem it records gabriel's list of
[1:22:29] six things that must happen
[1:22:31] at the end of a 490 year period so
[1:22:34] daniel's prayers
[1:22:35] for national and spiritual restoration
[1:22:37] can be fulfilled
[1:22:40] first to finish the transgression
[1:22:42] israel's spiritual blindness causes
[1:22:44] transgressions
[1:22:45] or rebellion the two thousand year
[1:22:48] rebellion ends
[1:22:49] when the jews with new sight except
[1:22:52] christ
[1:22:52] as their messiah second to make an
[1:22:56] end of sins sin is ultimately unbelief
[1:22:59] and israel's sin will end when they see
[1:23:02] the resurrected jesus
[1:23:04] physically appear to them just as joseph
[1:23:06] revealed himself
[1:23:07] in person to his 11 brothers in egypt
[1:23:12] third to make reconciliation for
[1:23:14] iniquity
[1:23:15] israel's iniquity is pardoned in one day
[1:23:18] when the
[1:23:19] thousand jews are born again by the holy
[1:23:22] ghost
[1:23:23] who institutes the ministry of
[1:23:25] reconciliation
[1:23:27] fourth to bring in everlasting
[1:23:29] righteousness
[1:23:31] the one thousand-year millennium is the
[1:23:32] time of righteousness
[1:23:34] when the glory of the lord fills the
[1:23:35] earth and satan is bound
[1:23:37] and unable to tempt anyone according to
[1:23:40] habakkuk 2 verse 14
[1:23:42] and revelation 20 verses 1 through 7.
[1:23:48] to seal up the vision and prophecy in
[1:23:51] hebrew
[1:23:52] seal means to be stopped showing
[1:23:54] daniel's vision
[1:23:55] and this prophecy is complete at jesus's
[1:23:58] second coming
[1:23:59] daniel 12 4 expresses the correct
[1:24:02] meaning of the 70 weeks prophecy
[1:24:04] would not be known until today the time
[1:24:06] of the end
[1:24:09] sixth to anoint the most holy at the
[1:24:12] beginning of the millennium
[1:24:13] ezekiel 43 verses 1 through 5
[1:24:17] says the newly rebuilt jewish temple is
[1:24:19] anointed by the holy ghost
[1:24:21] as god's glory comes like a rushing
[1:24:23] mighty wind
[1:24:24] into the house by the way of the gate
[1:24:27] whose prospect is toward the east
[1:24:30] the temple not king jesus needs anointed
[1:24:33] for jesus is already eternally anointed
[1:24:36] by the spirit
[1:24:37] christ never dies again living with all
[1:24:40] of heaven's power
[1:24:41] according to matthew 28 verse 18 and
[1:24:44] romans 6
[1:24:45] verse 9. it's apparent none of these six
[1:24:49] events can happen until blinded
[1:24:51] israel gained spiritual eyesight through
[1:24:54] repentance
[1:24:55] and acceptance of jesus christ this
[1:24:57] monumental event
[1:24:59] takes place during the tribulation after
[1:25:01] the new testament church is raptured
[1:25:03] away
[1:25:04] to the marriage supper of the lamb and
[1:25:06] the completed
[1:25:07] three and a half year ministry of
[1:25:09] israel's two prophets
[1:25:10] moses and elijah
[1:25:14] in verses 25 through 27 of daniel
[1:25:16] chapter 9
[1:25:17] the 490 year period is now divided up
[1:25:20] into three time periods
[1:25:22] seven weeks or 49 years 62 weeks
[1:25:26] or 434 years and one week
[1:25:29] seven years this is the key to
[1:25:32] understanding the prophecy
[1:25:35] the first two time periods seven weeks
[1:25:37] plus 62 weeks
[1:25:39] are combined to mark the point of jesus
[1:25:41] death
[1:25:42] then god cuts off israel for rejecting
[1:25:44] jesus
[1:25:45] essentially causing a two thousand year
[1:25:48] pause in this prophecy
[1:25:50] in order to save the gentiles the third
[1:25:52] period
[1:25:53] or seven years that remain occurred
[1:25:55] during the seven year tribulation period
[1:25:57] when god grafts israel back into his
[1:26:00] grace
[1:26:03] first time period of seven years in
[1:26:06] verse 25
[1:26:07] gabriel tells daniel there will be seven
[1:26:09] weeks or 49 years
[1:26:11] until the going forth of the commandment
[1:26:13] to restore and to build jerusalem
[1:26:15] and the street shall be built again and
[1:26:17] the wall even in troubles times
[1:26:20] according to larkin the starting date
[1:26:22] for this prophecy is 445
[1:26:24] bc when artaxerxes longimanus
[1:26:28] king of persia ordered israel's temple
[1:26:30] to be rebuilt
[1:26:32] the temple was finished 49 years later
[1:26:35] in 396
[1:26:36] bc in troubleless times nehemiah 4 verse
[1:26:39] 17 confirms the troublesome conditions
[1:26:41] of rebuilding the wall
[1:26:43] saying they which build it on the wall
[1:26:45] and they that bear burdens
[1:26:47] with those that laid it every one with
[1:26:49] one of his hands wrought in the work
[1:26:51] and with the other hand held a weapon
[1:26:55] second time period of 434 years
[1:26:59] this period of 62 weeks is also placed
[1:27:01] in verse 25
[1:27:02] and must be added to the first mentioned
[1:27:05] seven weeks or 49 years
[1:27:07] to know when the messiah would appear as
[1:27:09] king to israel
[1:27:11] daniel 9 25 says unto the messiah the
[1:27:14] prince
[1:27:15] shall be seven weeks and three score and
[1:27:17] two weeks
[1:27:19] john 12 13 captures the jewish multitude
[1:27:22] acknowledging jesus's royal princely
[1:27:24] position as their king
[1:27:26] only to crucify him within less than a
[1:27:28] week
[1:27:29] hosanna blessed is the king of israel
[1:27:32] that cometh
[1:27:33] in the name of the lord then in daniel 9
[1:27:36] 26 the prophecy says
[1:27:38] messiah would be cut off but not for
[1:27:40] himself
[1:27:41] after the 62 weeks this means we must
[1:27:44] add the previous 7 weeks
[1:27:46] 49 years to these 62 weeks or
[1:27:49] 434 years jesus crucifixion
[1:27:53] was his being cut off in order to bear
[1:27:55] all humanity's sins
[1:27:57] christ died for us for our sins not his
[1:28:01] hebrews 9 28 explains so christ was once
[1:28:05] offered to bear the sins of many and
[1:28:07] unto them that look for him shall he
[1:28:09] appear the second time
[1:28:10] without sin unto salvation
[1:28:15] adding the 62 weeks plus 7 weeks yields
[1:28:18] 69 weeks
[1:28:19] or 483 years 434
[1:28:23] plus 49 equals 483
[1:28:26] when you begin at artaxerxes order in
[1:28:28] 445 bc
[1:28:30] and add 69 weeks or 483 years
[1:28:34] you come to the year 38 a.d as the date
[1:28:37] for jesus's crucifixion
[1:28:39] but there seems to be a problem jesus
[1:28:41] began preaching around 26 a.d
[1:28:44] and was crucified after his three and a
[1:28:45] half year preaching ministry
[1:28:47] in 30 a.d there's an eight year
[1:28:49] difference between
[1:28:50] 30 a.d and 38 a.d
[1:28:54] there are 475 years from 444 bc
[1:28:58] to 30 a.d but we need 483 years
[1:29:02] how can god's prophecy be short eight
[1:29:05] years
[1:29:06] a simple resolution matches the dates
[1:29:08] correctly
[1:29:10] two different calendars need examine to
[1:29:12] understand the prophecy
[1:29:14] solar and prophetic the solar calendar
[1:29:17] has
[1:29:18] 365 and one-fourth days per year
[1:29:21] while god's prophetic calendar has 360
[1:29:24] days per year
[1:29:25] a prophetic year is shorter than a solar
[1:29:27] year as the solar calendar matches the
[1:29:30] amount of time it takes
[1:29:31] the earth to revolve once around the sun
[1:29:35] more time passes on the prophetic
[1:29:36] calendar than the solar because its
[1:29:39] years are shorter
[1:29:41] examining the prophetic year we know god
[1:29:43] has 12 months in his year
[1:29:45] because solomon had 12 officers over
[1:29:47] israel
[1:29:48] each man his month in a year revelation
[1:29:52] 11 verses 2 and 3 show 42 months
[1:29:55] equals 1 260 days
[1:29:58] in god's prophetic calendar each month
[1:30:00] has 30 days
[1:30:03] 1260 divided by 42
[1:30:06] equals 30.
[1:30:09] with these calculations verified by
[1:30:11] scripture you find the all-wise god
[1:30:14] hid the 483 prophetic years
[1:30:17] in man's 475 solar years
[1:30:21] isaiah 45 15 rightly declares
[1:30:24] thou art a god that hides thyself o god
[1:30:27] of israel
[1:30:28] the savior we must compare the number of
[1:30:32] days between the two calendars to see
[1:30:33] the time difference between them
[1:30:35] the solar's 365 and one-fourth days
[1:30:39] times 483 years equals
[1:30:43] 176 415.75
[1:30:48] days god's prophetic calendar
[1:30:51] has 173 880 days
[1:30:55] 360 times 483
[1:30:59] making the difference of 2005
[1:31:04] days now divide this number by 360 days
[1:31:08] and you arrive at 7.04 years
[1:31:12] this means seven extra prophetic years
[1:31:15] passed on the prophetic calendar
[1:31:17] since it's a shorter year during the 475
[1:31:21] solar years
[1:31:24] subtract the seven years from 38 a.d and
[1:31:27] you land at
[1:31:28] 31 a.d there seems to be one year
[1:31:31] remaining between jesus's historical
[1:31:33] crucifixion date
[1:31:35] of 30 a.d and 31 a.d
[1:31:38] keep in mind this extra year allows some
[1:31:41] wiggle room
[1:31:42] for the final six months or so of jesus
[1:31:45] ministry to be completed
[1:31:47] because we are not told jesus's exact
[1:31:49] age at the start of his preaching
[1:31:51] ministry
[1:31:52] luke 3 verses 21 through 23 gives
[1:31:55] jesus's general age
[1:31:57] about 30 years when he was baptized
[1:32:00] saying and jesus himself began to be
[1:32:03] about 30 years of age
[1:32:06] this extra time also gave extra grace
[1:32:09] for the elected believers to recognize
[1:32:11] jesus as messiah
[1:32:12] believing upon him and following his
[1:32:15] ministry
[1:32:17] finishing the latter details of daniel 9
[1:32:20] 26
[1:32:20] we read and the people of the prince
[1:32:23] that shall come shall destroy the city
[1:32:25] and the sanctuary
[1:32:26] and the end thereof shall be with a
[1:32:28] flood and unto the end of the war
[1:32:30] desolations are determined
[1:32:34] the prince in this verse is not the
[1:32:36] messiah for jerusalem
[1:32:38] the city in which was the temple of the
[1:32:40] sanctuary was destroyed and made
[1:32:42] desolate by titus's roman army
[1:32:44] in a.d 70. observe the 40-year probation
[1:32:48] period
[1:32:49] from the time israel crucified christ 30
[1:32:52] a.d
[1:32:52] to the time titus came in 70 a.d
[1:32:56] 40 years later god did the same 40-year
[1:32:59] probation period
[1:33:00] with a generation who refused to possess
[1:33:02] the promised land
[1:33:04] after the exodus from egypt hebrews 3
[1:33:07] 17 reads but with whom was he grieved
[1:33:10] forty years
[1:33:11] was it not with them that had sinned
[1:33:13] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[1:33:17] like a school master putting a student
[1:33:19] in a timeout or detention and discipline
[1:33:22] god has put away or cast away israel
[1:33:25] from his new covenant blessings
[1:33:26] based upon their disobedience his focus
[1:33:29] has been on the gentile people from
[1:33:31] around 30 a.d
[1:33:33] to the date of this publication 2021
[1:33:37] through israel's fall salvation has come
[1:33:39] unto the gentiles
[1:33:42] god has put nearly a 2 000 year long
[1:33:45] pause
[1:33:46] on daniel's 70-week prophecy to show his
[1:33:49] grace to the gentiles
[1:33:51] in other words there's a near 2000 year
[1:33:53] gap
[1:33:54] between the ending of the 69th week of
[1:33:56] daniel's prophecy
[1:33:58] and the beginning of the 70th week
[1:34:01] hosea 3 verses 4 and 5 beautifully
[1:34:04] foretell this long pause
[1:34:06] calling it many days for the children of
[1:34:09] israel shall abide many days without a
[1:34:11] king
[1:34:12] and without a prince and without a
[1:34:13] sacrifice and without an image
[1:34:16] and without any ephod and without
[1:34:18] teraphim
[1:34:20] afterwards shall the children of israel
[1:34:22] return and seek the lord their god
[1:34:24] and david their king and shall fear the
[1:34:27] lord and his goodness
[1:34:28] in the latter days notice also hosea 3
[1:34:33] verse 5
[1:34:34] foretells israel's return to the lord
[1:34:36] paul agrees saying
[1:34:38] god is able to graft them in again and
[1:34:41] will do that when
[1:34:42] the fullness of the gentiles be come in
[1:34:46] once every gentile believer is saved god
[1:34:49] will be done with the gentiles
[1:34:51] and will return to israel chapter 3
[1:34:53] explains how god brought
[1:34:55] gentiles into his family and chapter 7
[1:34:58] reveals god's historical dealings
[1:35:00] with them over the past two thousand
[1:35:02] years called the gentile church ages
[1:35:06] third time period of seven years this
[1:35:09] final week or seven year period
[1:35:11] is the seventieth week and is described
[1:35:14] in daniel 9
[1:35:15] 27 and he shall confirm the covenant
[1:35:18] with many for one week
[1:35:19] and in the midst of the week he shall
[1:35:21] cause the sacrifice
[1:35:23] and the oblation to cease and for the
[1:35:25] over-spreading of abominations
[1:35:27] he shall make it desolate even until the
[1:35:30] consummation
[1:35:31] and that determined shall be poured upon
[1:35:33] the desolate
[1:35:35] the he in this verse cannot be christ
[1:35:38] because our lord would not purposely
[1:35:39] overspread abominations upon jerusalem
[1:35:42] as is the purpose of this man following
[1:35:45] his move to stop jewish sacrifices
[1:35:48] the he is connected to the last person
[1:35:50] mentioned in the previous verse
[1:35:52] titus the roman general the prince that
[1:35:55] shall come
[1:35:56] the he in verse 27 is the person of the
[1:35:58] antichrist
[1:35:59] who will be the future roman leader
[1:36:02] chapter 9 covers scripture
[1:36:03] identifying the antichrist who will be a
[1:36:06] future pope
[1:36:07] of the roman catholic church the order
[1:36:10] of end time events begins with the holy
[1:36:12] ghost filled
[1:36:13] new testament church being raptured to
[1:36:16] meet christ
[1:36:17] and the dead in christ in the air jesus
[1:36:20] takes his faithful saints to heaven
[1:36:21] for the marriage supper the lamb with
[1:36:24] the gentile church ages being finished
[1:36:26] god returns to his people israel the
[1:36:29] great tribulation
[1:36:30] officially begins
[1:36:34] shortly after the rapture the pope
[1:36:36] antichrist makes a one week
[1:36:38] or seven year covenant with many world
[1:36:40] leaders
[1:36:41] including sinful israel the deceitful
[1:36:44] covenant is also called a peaceful
[1:36:46] league
[1:36:47] in daniel 11 verses 22 and 23
[1:36:50] paul says the world will be crying for
[1:36:52] peace and safety
[1:36:54] and that is what the pope antichrist
[1:36:56] will promise to deliver
[1:36:58] the 144 000 faithful jewish remnant
[1:37:01] will refuse to bow to the pope's
[1:37:03] flatteries or not be part of this
[1:37:05] covenant
[1:37:07] it's likely all believing israelis use
[1:37:09] this time to return to living
[1:37:11] in the holy land due to the pope's
[1:37:14] worldwide peace agreement
[1:37:15] which includes the oft violent
[1:37:17] palestinians
[1:37:18] israel will rebuild its temple and
[1:37:21] re-establish
[1:37:21] animal sacrifices for the first time in
[1:37:24] almost 2 000 years
[1:37:26] christ foretold israel's time of
[1:37:28] repossession of jerusalem
[1:37:30] after the gentile rapture in luke 21
[1:37:32] verse 24
[1:37:34] and jerusalem shall be trodden down of
[1:37:36] the gentiles
[1:37:37] until the times of the gentiles be
[1:37:39] fulfilled
[1:37:41] at the same time revelation 11 verses
[1:37:44] 1-13
[1:37:45] describes the supernatural ministry of
[1:37:47] israel's two prophets in judea
[1:37:50] verses two and three say these spirit
[1:37:52] empowered men
[1:37:53] prophesy for three and a half years or
[1:37:56] half of the last
[1:37:57] or seventieth week of daniel the next
[1:38:00] verses
[1:38:00] five and six say their ministries match
[1:38:03] the old testament prophets
[1:38:04] moses and elijah who had power to
[1:38:07] withhold rain
[1:38:08] cause plagues and turn water into blood
[1:38:11] great torments will begin but the
[1:38:13] greatest judgments will happen after
[1:38:14] three and a half years
[1:38:16] because the 144 thousand israelis must
[1:38:19] first accept jesus as
[1:38:20] messiah and be sealed by the holy ghost
[1:38:23] revelation 7 verse 3 records the angels
[1:38:26] command
[1:38:27] to hold off on the cataclysmic judgments
[1:38:30] until
[1:38:30] israel is sealed saying hurt not the
[1:38:34] earth
[1:38:34] neither the sea nor the trees till we
[1:38:37] have sealed the servants of god
[1:38:38] in their foreheads
[1:38:41] halfway through the seven year covenant
[1:38:43] in the midst of the week
[1:38:45] daniel 9 verse 27 teaches the pope
[1:38:47] causes
[1:38:48] israel's sacrifices and oblations to
[1:38:51] cease
[1:38:52] this also marks the end of the three and
[1:38:54] a half year ministries
[1:38:55] of the two jewish prophets who were
[1:38:57] slain by satan
[1:38:59] the beast but are raised from the dead
[1:39:01] and raptured
[1:39:02] three and a half days later in the sight
[1:39:04] of their enemies
[1:39:06] a great earthquake strikes jerusalem
[1:39:08] causing a tenth of the city to fall
[1:39:10] along with seven thousand deaths the 144
[1:39:14] thousand remnant
[1:39:15] see god's power and give him glory in
[1:39:17] the fear
[1:39:18] of the lord daniel 12
[1:39:21] 11 says one month or 30 days after the
[1:39:24] broken covenant
[1:39:25] rome sets up an abomination in israel's
[1:39:28] temple
[1:39:29] as the pope sits in the temple claiming
[1:39:31] he is god
[1:39:32] then rome and her allies send their
[1:39:34] armies to destroy israel
[1:39:36] but god will fight for his covenant
[1:39:38] people zechariah 12
[1:39:40] 9 foretells and it shall come to pass in
[1:39:43] that day that i will seek to destroy
[1:39:45] all the nations that come against
[1:39:47] jerusalem
[1:39:49] in the darkest hour israel's rejected
[1:39:52] king jesus christ
[1:39:53] returns to earth to destroy the armies
[1:39:56] next
[1:39:57] zechariah 12 verse 9 through
[1:40:00] chapter 13 verse 6 says he physically
[1:40:03] reveals himself
[1:40:04] to his 144 thousand brethren and the
[1:40:07] spirit of grace
[1:40:08] and supplications pours upon them as a
[1:40:10] fountain
[1:40:11] washing away their blindness crying and
[1:40:14] mournful israelis weep from house to
[1:40:16] house
[1:40:17] devastated their race crucified their
[1:40:19] own messiah
[1:40:21] yet jesus brings healing and following
[1:40:23] their heartfelt repentance
[1:40:25] the 144 thousand are sealed with the
[1:40:27] holy ghost
[1:40:28] through jesus's amazing grace israel's
[1:40:31] blindness is over
[1:40:33] she was blind but now she sees the
[1:40:35] messiah has done it
[1:40:37] redeem both jew and gentile
[1:40:41] other events during the last three and a
[1:40:42] half years include the wrath of god upon
[1:40:45] beast worshipers
[1:40:46] who rejected jesus christ this divine
[1:40:49] wrath is spoken of in the sixth seal
[1:40:51] of revelation 6 verses 12 through 17.
[1:40:55] the indescribable punishments in the
[1:40:57] seven trumpets
[1:40:58] that are mentioned in revelation
[1:41:00] chapters 8 9
[1:41:02] and 11 fall upon mankind the seven last
[1:41:05] plagues or vials
[1:41:07] are poured out according to revelation
[1:41:09] chapters 15
[1:41:10] and 16. with the sixth seal nearly
[1:41:14] complete
[1:41:15] jesus returns from heaven as every eye
[1:41:17] on earth
[1:41:18] sees him as they wail beholding his
[1:41:21] fiery eyes
[1:41:22] the battle of armageddon ensues based
[1:41:25] upon revelation
[1:41:26] 16 verse 16 and revelation 19
[1:41:29] verses 11 21. christ defeats the pope
[1:41:33] antichrist and the evil spirit
[1:41:35] possessing him and cast them both alive
[1:41:38] into the lake of fire the remaining time
[1:41:42] of the last three and a half year period
[1:41:44] of daniel's 70th week comes to a close
[1:41:47] heavenly fire cleanses the earth in
[1:41:49] preparation for the 1 000 year honeymoon
[1:41:52] christ and his bride walk upon a new sin
[1:41:55] cleansed earth gabriel's sixfold purpose
[1:41:58] is complete
[1:41:59] everlasting righteousness will reign the
[1:42:02] millennial temple will be anointed
[1:42:04] with christ's glory the earth is healed
[1:42:07] malachi 4 verses 1 through 3 is realized
[1:42:12] for behold the day cometh that shall
[1:42:14] burn as an oven
[1:42:15] and all the proud yea and all that do
[1:42:17] wickedly shall be stubble
[1:42:19] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[1:42:21] up saith the lord of hosts
[1:42:23] that it shall leave them neither root
[1:42:24] nor branch but unto you that fear my
[1:42:27] name shall the son of righteousness
[1:42:29] arise with healing in his wings
[1:42:31] and ye shall go forth and grow up as
[1:42:33] calves of the stall
[1:42:35] and ye shall tread down the wicked for
[1:42:37] they shall be ashes under the soles of
[1:42:39] your feet in the day that i shall do
[1:42:41] this
[1:42:41] saith the lord of hosts
[1:42:45] the rewards for receiving the revelation
[1:42:47] of israel's blindness
[1:42:50] receiving the revelation of israel's
[1:42:51] blindness gains a few rewards
[1:42:54] first believers inherit god's blessings
[1:42:56] upon their lives
[1:42:57] when they bless blinded faithful israel
[1:43:00] this is because god's immutable covenant
[1:43:02] with abraham
[1:43:03] and his seed remains in effect as
[1:43:06] believers bless and pray for blinded
[1:43:08] jews
[1:43:09] the lord blesses their health finances
[1:43:12] family
[1:43:12] and more god's divine law remains
[1:43:15] regarding the power of the tongue
[1:43:17] death and life are in the power of the
[1:43:19] tongue genesis 12
[1:43:21] 13 holds true and i will bless them that
[1:43:24] bless thee
[1:43:25] and curse him that curseth thee and in
[1:43:27] thee shall all families of the earth be
[1:43:29] blessed
[1:43:30] your family can be one of the many
[1:43:32] blessed through abraham's obedience
[1:43:34] and now yours this doesn't mean
[1:43:37] believers bless the sinful acts of jews
[1:43:40] who live in sin and reject the mosaic
[1:43:43] covenant
[1:43:44] in fact paul dealt with these kind of
[1:43:45] jews saying
[1:43:47] as concerning the gospel they are
[1:43:49] enemies for your sakes
[1:43:50] but as touching the election they are
[1:43:53] beloved for the father sakes
[1:43:55] the apostle knew some jews may be
[1:43:57] aggressively against
[1:43:59] jesus but later turned to him through
[1:44:01] god's election
[1:44:02] we know the same is true now most jews
[1:44:06] will sternly oppose jesus's cross but
[1:44:08] you know
[1:44:09] 144 000 will eventually experience the
[1:44:12] same grace you have
[1:44:14] through the resurrected messiah
[1:44:17] the other reward is one you possess
[1:44:19] internally hope for israel
[1:44:22] without this revelation your heart would
[1:44:23] feel devastated and despair
[1:44:25] for israel thinking she was cursed and
[1:44:28] bound for hell
[1:44:29] but through christ's spirit in your soul
[1:44:31] you realize jesus
[1:44:32] is the hope of israel paul writes it is
[1:44:35] the lord jesus christ
[1:44:36] which is our hope and with jesus's
[1:44:39] everlasting grace
[1:44:41] love and wisdom you know there is a
[1:44:43] reason to hope for israel's
[1:44:45] total restoration the consequences for
[1:44:49] rejecting the revelation
[1:44:50] of israel's blindness there are two
[1:44:53] possible consequences for rejecting the
[1:44:55] revelation of israel's blindness
[1:44:58] first many believe israel is forever
[1:45:00] cursed because they crucified jesus
[1:45:02] their own messiah this faulty belief
[1:45:05] leads some to curse
[1:45:06] jews in their angry hearts and with
[1:45:08] their words
[1:45:10] in these cases death is in the power of
[1:45:12] their tongues
[1:45:13] yet the spirit of god cannot curse what
[1:45:15] god is blessed
[1:45:16] permanent curses must be differentiated
[1:45:18] from temporary ones
[1:45:20] sinful jews and sinful gentiles too
[1:45:24] fall under temporary curses also called
[1:45:26] spiritual captivity by paul
[1:45:28] in 2 timothy 2 verse 26
[1:45:32] and that they may recover themselves out
[1:45:34] of the snare of the devil
[1:45:35] who are taken captive by him at his will
[1:45:38] another common word for a temporary
[1:45:40] curse is an addiction
[1:45:44] before his miraculous conversion paul
[1:45:46] then known as saul
[1:45:48] was persecuting christians saul was
[1:45:50] hurting his own soul
[1:45:51] taken captive to the lies he believed
[1:45:54] such as jesus not being israel's messiah
[1:45:57] acts 26 verse 11 shows the belligerent
[1:46:00] saw
[1:46:00] punished christians and compelled them
[1:46:02] to blaspheme jesus
[1:46:04] when christ met him on the road to
[1:46:06] damascus he told saul he was kicking
[1:46:08] against the pricks
[1:46:10] this expression is taken from oxen who
[1:46:12] stubbornly kicked against the sharp
[1:46:14] goads
[1:46:15] used to prod them on the ox only hurt
[1:46:18] itself and gained no relief
[1:46:20] paul was doing the same by dragging
[1:46:22] christians to prisons
[1:46:23] he was stubbornly destroying god's joy
[1:46:26] peace
[1:46:26] and love for his life many people
[1:46:29] destroy their own spiritual blessings by
[1:46:31] cursing others
[1:46:32] including the jews anger towards jews
[1:46:36] because they crucified jesus
[1:46:38] should be abandoned because anyone in
[1:46:40] their position would have done the same
[1:46:43] do not let pride arise in your heart
[1:46:44] thinking you would have stopped the
[1:46:46] angry mob from killing jesus
[1:46:48] isaiah 53 verse 6 and 7 washes all pride
[1:46:52] from our hearts by declaring
[1:46:54] we hid as it were our face from him he
[1:46:56] was despised
[1:46:58] and we esteemed him not all we like
[1:47:00] sheep have gone astray
[1:47:02] we have turned everyone to his own way
[1:47:04] and the lord hath laid on him
[1:47:06] the iniquity of us all
[1:47:09] if we had witnessed jesus's arrest
[1:47:11] flogging and crucifixion
[1:47:13] we would have hid too all of us would
[1:47:16] have forsaken him
[1:47:17] but this makes his grace so amazing in
[1:47:19] that he loved us first
[1:47:21] in our unlovable state a famous example
[1:47:25] of a christian leader
[1:47:26] holding the wrong view of jews is martin
[1:47:28] luther
[1:47:29] the great reformation leader of the
[1:47:31] 1500s repeatedly wrote with aggressive
[1:47:34] hostility
[1:47:35] towards jews calling them a serpent's
[1:47:38] brood
[1:47:39] anti-semitism is always wrong even in
[1:47:42] luther's case
[1:47:43] luther influenced some to expel jews and
[1:47:46] burn their synagogues
[1:47:48] these are stains on his testimony but
[1:47:50] luther can plead ignorance for not
[1:47:52] having the revelation of israel's
[1:47:53] blindness
[1:47:54] because all the mysteries of the bible
[1:47:56] could not be revealed until the end time
[1:47:59] daniel 12 4 says god's book is sealed
[1:48:02] until
[1:48:02] the time of the end had luther lived in
[1:48:06] our day
[1:48:06] he would have received the revelation of
[1:48:08] israel's blindness as evidenced by the
[1:48:10] truth
[1:48:11] that he received god's revelation about
[1:48:14] justification by faith
[1:48:15] in the time he lived second
[1:48:18] many gentile religious groups are guilty
[1:48:20] of confusing their position
[1:48:22] with israel's 144 thousand
[1:48:25] future saints these groups see blinded
[1:48:28] israel
[1:48:29] as totally forsaken with no hope and
[1:48:32] consider themselves
[1:48:33] the spiritual israel or 144 thousand
[1:48:36] remnant
[1:48:37] they go as far as believing genuine
[1:48:39] christians will suffer in the
[1:48:40] tribulation period
[1:48:42] which is unscriptural jehovah's
[1:48:44] witnesses are best known for believing
[1:48:46] their followers
[1:48:47] make up the 144 thousand believers
[1:48:50] they misunderstand romans 2 verses 28
[1:48:53] and 29
[1:48:54] by thinking they replace the jews
[1:48:56] applying these verses to themselves
[1:49:00] but paul was writing only to jewish-born
[1:49:02] men who later became christians
[1:49:04] as romans 2 verse 17 suggests
[1:49:07] behold thou art called a jew and restest
[1:49:10] in the law and make us thy boast of god
