TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] He come up on the basis of the shed blood knowing that God required a blood sacrifice and blood was what Job offered knowing that God could not refuse it. The whole picture is a perfect revelation. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to do a character study on the life of Job in order to show how Job was perfect in God's sight in heaven by the blood sacrifice. Yet Job was imperfect on earth or vile as he calls it in Job 40:4 showing the glory of God's complete total forgiveness in heaven despite the battle with our flesh and our sin nature here on earth. this pest house as God's prophet brother Ram tells us. As a recent video showed, Job was being tested or proven to the devil that Job's love for God was genuine and not based upon God's benefits to Job. Brother Ram said this test was for the perfecting of Job's spirit. Look at Job, a perfect man, a just man. And God permitted the evil devil to come upon him and chastise him and everything else for the perfecting of his spirit. See, so evil spirits has God uses evil spirits many times to work out his plan and his will. I'm hopeful that this video will correct any misunderstandings that some spread about Job by claiming that Job never sinned on earth. People misunderstand that because God calls him perfect in Job chapters 1 and two, but then they fail to read on the rest of the scriptural witnesses especially from Elahu and then God himself and Job himself. And hopefully this video then will show the balance in the word of God regarding Job's entire testimony. The ultimate goal is that this video would continue to encourage us to be patient with God as we relate to Job's life because James 5:11 says Job's testimony was to teach us patience. And when we consider what Job went through, really think about the trials he faced, it does make us more patient. Remember, Job suffered for months, not days, but months. According to Job 29:2, Job lost all of his children. In Job 1, Job lost all of his wealth. In Job 1, Job lost his good health. In chapter 2, scripture also says he lost sleep. Job 7:es 3 and 4 said he had weariesome nights. He was full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. Even in Job 7:13-14, he had nightmares as well. He said, "Thou scarest me with dreams and terrifies me through visions." Now, it wasn't God doing that. God doesn't tempt anyone, but God allowed the devil to do that. So, even when he did sleep, he had horrible dreams. His pain intensified at night time according to Job 30:17. My bones are pierced in me in the night season and my sinnus take no rest. Now because of this lack of sleep and pain during the night time, he also longed for death. Job 3:es 3 and 4 say, "Let the day perish wherein I was born and night in which it was said, there's a manchild conceived, let that day be darkness." Job 3:11 said, "Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?" Job 3:20-22 says, "Which long for death, but it cometh not." So Job is suffering not just during the day, but the entire night. So we recognize most people do not suffer on Job's level. Some people experience a degree of Job's suffering. For example, they might experience bad health or they might lose children. They might lose their finances. But it's rare to find someone who suffered on all these levels like Job did. But we remember this book was written for our admonition, for our patience, our learning, so that when we suffer, we can learn to trust the Lord that the Lord gives and the Lord takes away. But blessed be the name of the Lord. So in this first section, let's look at the list of Job's holy habits and attributes. In other words, his godly character. Job 1:5 said he had frequent prayers and blood sacrifices for his children, and he rose up early in the morning. Again, encouragement for us to get up early, pray and seek God. This is what made God called Job perfect in heaven. It was the blood sacrifice just as the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ in the New Testament makes us perfect. I want to play two quotes from God's prophet, brother Brandham, where he recognizes this that the blood sacrifice is what made Job perfect. The first is from fellowship through the reconciliation of the blood. 1955, brother Ram said, "Job came on the basis of the shed blood to God. He knew that God could not refuse it." Brother Ram calls this a perfect revelation. And oh, how that inspires us. The blood of Jesus Christ should be a perfect revelation to us, knowing that God cannot refuse the blood of Jesus Christ. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; Job knew he had not sinned because he come upon the basis of God's word. He come up on the basis of the shed blood knowing that God required a blood sacrifice and blood was what Job offered knowing that God could not refuse it. The whole picture is a perfect revelation. Next in the basis for fellowship 1961, brother Brandham said Job knew he was righteous because he wasn't trusting in his own merits. He'd met God's requirement for the blood sacrifice. Then brother Ram encourages us to do that. Just keep holding out. Stand on the blood of Jesus Christ. It's the only place for fellowship with God is the blood of Jesus Christ. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; When they come down as comforters, the church members come down and accused him. He know that he was righteous because he wasn't trusting in his own merits. But he had met God's requirement because he'd stood on the blood sacrifice. Yes, sir. He know that he was righteous because he was meeting God's requirements. And then you notice if you'll just keep holding out, stand on the blood, don't take nothing else. Belong to your denomination, that's all right. Have education, that's fine. Science, that's all right. But first, place yourself on the blood. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the only place of fellowship. So the blood sacrifices Job made to God made him morally and ethically pure. That's according to the Hebrew. That's one of the definitions of perfect when God calls him a perfect man. So obeying God's commands, keeping his requirements makes us perfect in heaven as well by the blood of Jesus Christ. Okay. So another holy habit Job had was that he understood he was delivered to the ungodly or Satan and that he was turned over to the hands of the wicked. This is found in Job 16:1. So it seems like Job went back and forth between trusting God, knowing that God was testing him, but then also questioning God. The third attribute Job had was that he lived for others. This proves he had eternal life. He lived for the widows. He helped the widows in Job 29:13. He helped the fatherless in Job 29:12. He loved his enemies in Job 31:29. He did not trust in riches in Job 31 24 and 25. And he helped strangers in Job 31:32. May that encourage us in the New Testament to do the same. Another powerful testimony about Job is that he overcame sexual mind battles of lust. According to Job 31 and:es 9 and 10, he made a covenant with his eyes not to look upon a maid. So this is one example of why God called Job a man that is skewed evil. That means he departed from evil. He turned aside. So when the girls would come by, he would turn aside his head and not look. And the final observation is that God called Job perfect which means morally pure. And notice God called him the greatest man in his generation. So that ought to encourage us friends to do these things that Job did. Pray early in the morning. Make sacrifices unto God. Help the widows, the fatherless, love our enemies. Do not trust in riches. Trust in the living God. Help strangers. Overcome lustful thoughts. If we do that, then God will call us great. We shouldn't call ourselves great. As brother M said, there is a trend among some message people to call themselves the greatest of all time or among the greatest of all time. I believe that's a sin of pride. &gt;&gt; Sometimes great guys get together. You hear him say great so and so and great so and so are great. Don't never do that. There's no great ones among us. &gt;&gt; There's only one great one and that's God. &gt;&gt; We are brothers, sisters. But as Job demonstrates, he lived for others. He made early morning sacrifices unto God. And so we must let God call us great or God call us good. And just one more thing to note in Job chapter 38 when God comes and talks to Job, God speaks and says, "Who is this that darkeneth counsel?" So God doesn't even call Job by name in Job chapter 38. God doesn't even recognize his name. Yet in heaven, God is using his name and testifying of his righteousness to Satan. So this shows the love of God in heaven and also the chastening that God gives to his children here on earth. God called Job perfect in heaven, but then when God came down, God didn't even call him by name. Because as many as God loves, he chastens. God didn't baby Job. God didn't tell Job, you're the greatest of all time, or you're the greatest in your generation. God chasened him in order to make him more holy. Now, let's look at a list of Job's failures and sins, his human failures on earth. Job admits the following in the scripture. Job admits first he had great fear that this would happen to him in Job 3:2. And in How can I overcome 1963, brother Ram said Job's fear brought this upon him. In the book of Job, it says here Job feared and what he feared it actually happened. &gt;&gt; What brought it is fear. &gt;&gt; That's what made it happen. His faith would have kept him from it. But his fear brought him brought it to him. He was scared it's going to happen. And it did happen. Now, if he told it wouldn't happen, it wouldn't happen. See what I mean? If you're afraid when you come by the prayer line, maybe I just haven't got the face sufficient. It'll never happen. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; But if you know what's going to happen, it'll happen. &gt;&gt; See, he it's a substance of something. Job had a fear that these things would come up on him and they did. If you have a fear that your disease is going to leave you or won't leave you, it won't. If you have a faith that it will. &gt;&gt; So, we can see how God works with our free moral agency and our failures and our strengths. So because Job didn't cast out the fear during his life, this happened. Brother Ram said his fear brought it upon him. And yet God used that also as an opportunity to prove to the devil that Job really loved God. So again, all things work together for good to them that love the Lord, to them that are the called according to his purpose. Here's another failure. Job did a second one. Job said God put no trust in his servants in Job 4:18. But that's not true. God trusted Job according to Job 1:8 and Job 2:3. So Job said things that were wrong about God. Third, Job admitted he was speaking in anguish of spirit and he was complaining in the bitterness of his soul in Job 7:1. So he admitted complaining. Job admitted he was full of confusion. That's why I said earlier he would go back and forth between trusting God or questioning God. That's in Job 10:15. Job also said he got to a spot where he was at ease or he got too relaxed on God in Job 16:12. So, we know he was faithful most of the time praying early in the morning making sacrifices early in the morning. But he does tell us he got a little lazy. He got at ease at one point. Job said another thing wrong. He said God's wrath was kindled against him and he was an enemy of God. in Job 19:1. But that's not true. Again, if we just go back and read Job 1 and 2, God was bragging on Job to the devil. And yet, friends, despite all these things, Job said, his failures, his fears, he never cursed God in all of this. Praise the Lord. That's such an encouragement to us. We must do the same. We must always give God praise. We must always be careful what we say. I remember the recent video I put out about blasphemy. Sometimes we say the wrong thing. Friends, if we really love God, we'll feel sorry for it. We'll repent of any evil words we say and God will forgive us. Because Paul was the pattern. Paul blasphemed in ignorance. Yet God forgave him. And Paul said, "I'm a pattern in 1 Timothy chapter 1 of all who would believe." So that's you and I. We know God will forgive us just like he forgave Paul. Next, friends, Allahu comes and speaks to Job. And alahu was a type of Christ according to brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; And when these church members came and could not consort him, accused him of being a secret sinner that he had sinned before God. Joel knew he had not sinned. And he knew he was all right. But then God sent a young man down by the name of Elahu. Come down to me Joel. Perfect type of Christ again. &gt;&gt; So if Alahu is a type of Christ, we would see that Christ is corrective. Love is corrective. As Jesus said in Revelation 3, as many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. So notice Job gets two levels of correction. He gets a man correcting him, alahu, and then God comes down after that and God corrects Job himself. A double witness that God loved Job. And because God loved Job, he had to correct Job. So Elahu said Job was righteous in his own eyes and justified himself and not God. That's Job 32:es 1 and 2. So think of that friends. Job was making himself more righteous than God. He was exalting himself above God. Remember Elahu came in God'sstead or Christstead. We'd say as Job 33:6 says, Allah tells Job of his iniquity and his false claim that God counted him as an enemy. So again, Job's sins were iniquities. He knew they were wrong, but he still did them. And Allahu corrected him and said he was not an enemy of God. That's in Job 33:9 and 10. Allah says Job was not just and it was likely due to pride in Job 33 12 and 17. Allah says that Job said wrongly that God took away his judgment in Job 34:5. Allah who said Job was scornful in Job 34:7 and Allah who said Job said it was not a prophet to serve God and God did iniquity in Job 34 9 and 10. Allah also said that Job condemned God who was the just one in Job 34:17. Allah went on to say that Job spoke without knowledge. Job spoke without wisdom. Job added rebellion to his sin. Job added words against God in Job 34:es 35, 36, and 37. And Job later agreed with this. Job later agreed with Elahu in Job 42:3. Job said that he spake without knowledge things that he did not understand. Allah then said that Job said his righteousness was more than God's. Imagine that a believer said, "I'm more righteous than God." That was in Job 35:es 1 2 and 3. And that's what Job said in Job 31:2. For what portion of God is there from above? And what inheritance of the Almighty from on high. So here we see Job exalting himself above God. And yet God was merciful to forgive him. Next, Allah said that Job opened his mouth in vain without knowledge. It's according to Job 35:16. And then lastly, Allah breaks into the mind of God in Job 36:3 because he starts identifying nature such as rain, clouds, light, lightning, thunder, snow, frost, sky, and wind. And this is exactly what God does in the next few chapters in Job 38, 39,40 and 41. So Elahu starts bringing all these examples of nature that Job cannot control. Job cannot explain. So this shows again how Elahu was a type of Christ. Christ was God in the flesh. Emmanuel, God with us. Elahu said what God was going to say. Jesus said, "I only speak that which the father gives me." And Allah had said earlier that he spake by inspiration of the Almighty. In this final section here, God himself comes down to Job and identifies the following sins in Job's life. First, God said, "Who is this to Job?" Notice God doesn't call Job my son or my servant. Although he did call Job his servant when he was speaking to Job's three miserable comforters in Job 42 7 and 8. So when God comes down to correct us, many times it's in rebuke, but yet that's a sign of God's love. God said that Job darkened counsel without knowledge. So Job brought a darkness upon God, exalting himself above God, and he spoke things he didn't understand. That's in Job 38:2. And notice this is powerful. God said Job was guilty of contending with him in order to instruct God and reprove God. That's in Job 40:2. So Job was trying to correct God. Job was trying to teach God. And so what does God do? God comes down in those chapters 38, 39, 40, 41. And God asks Job over 70 questions about nature, about the elements of weather. 70 questions Job cannot answer. And then God never does directly answer Job's questions that he had throughout the book of Job. So God is trying to humble Job. He doesn't answer his questions. He just gives more questions to Job so Job can have an idea of how great God is. If God controls over 70 elements of nature, all the beasts of the field, the weather patterns, the sky, the planets, the stars, surely God knows about Job's life. And God is in control of Job's life. And then let's look at Job's response after God comes down and asks him these 70 questions and rebukes him. Job said, "I am vile." In Job 40:4 again, that means dishonorable, insignificant. And then Job said, "I abhore myself." Job hates himself. In other words, he hated his sinful nature and repented in dust and ashes in Job 42:6. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Just like Job, friends, we too are perfect in heaven. The Bible says we're accepted in the beloved. We're seated in heavenly places. There's no condemnation to us because we're in Christ Jesus. And if God is for us, who can be against us according to Romans chapter 8. And all this is possible by the blood of Jesus Christ. The blood sacrifice we are trusting in. Praying to God daily for forgiveness of sins. Confessing our sins, knowing that if we confess them, God is faithful and just to forgive us of all unrighteousness. While at the same time here on earth, we're in need of correction. We're in need of humility and daily repentance as we serve God on earth as we daily bring this human sinful nature into subjection to the word of God. This reminds us of Jesus saying, "Take up your cross daily and follow me." In Luke 9:23, Jesus gives lots of images or metaphors of the Christian life. It's like a runner running a race. It's like a farmer planting his crops. But he also says it's like taking up a cross and following Jesus. This would be the most uncomfortable metaphor of all. Daily dragging a cross around following the Lord Jesus Christ. gives the imagery of being tired, worn out, slowly dying every single day, dying out to our sin nature. But this daily dying will produce the character of Christ in us. The character of Christ is likened unto gold. Job knew these tests would bring forth his Christlike character as well. Job 23:10, when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. Peter in the New Testament, Peter 1:7 says, "That the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ." Nothing's more valuable than our character getting tested to become more like Jesus Christ. And lastly, Jesus tells us in the Leosian church age, Revelation 3:18, I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire. So gold is time-tested character of a Christian. We have to go to Jesus and say, "I want to buy that. I want time-tested character. I want to be corrected. I want to be made more like Christ by taking up my cross daily and follow him." By taking up my cross daily and following him. And then Revelation 3:19, "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. Be zealous therefore and repent." That's what God wanted Job to do, to be zealous to repent. And that's what God wants us to do as well. That's what Job did. I repent in dust and ashes. And then friends, if we do that, we have a promise that we'll be overcomers just like Job overcame. Now, we won't all be like Job and get double blessings after our trials here on the earth, but for sure, we'll get those blessings in heaven. The rewards are waiting for the believer in heaven. Hebrews 6:10 says, "For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have shued toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister." God sees your labor. Just keep ministering to the saints. Just keep ministering to others, even enemies. The great reward is to him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my father in his throne. We want character that is fit to rule. As brother Ram said in the church age book, character is a victory, not a gift. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. I'm very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He has never failed. [Music]
