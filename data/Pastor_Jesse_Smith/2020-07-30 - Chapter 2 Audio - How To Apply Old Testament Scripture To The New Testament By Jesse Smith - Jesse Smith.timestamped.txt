[0:02] chapter 2
[0:03] how to apply old testament scripture to
[0:05] the new testament
[0:09] includes footnotes 90 to 177
[0:14] and there shall no wise enter into it
[0:17] anything that defileth
[0:19] neither whatsoever worketh abomination
[0:21] or maketh a lie
[0:23] but they which are written in the lamb's
[0:24] book of life
[0:26] revelation 21 verse 27.
[0:31] new testament believers need the old
[0:32] testament for a variety of reasons
[0:35] peter instructed believers to live holy
[0:37] lives and be mindful of old testament
[0:40] scripture
[0:40] because its fulfillment was guaranteed
[0:43] paul wrote that we must learn from it
[0:45] and admonished us to remember the
[0:47] decisions of rebellious israel
[0:49] on their journey from egypt to canaan
[0:51] that we might take heed
[0:53] lest we fall into similar temptations
[0:56] all scripture which includes old
[0:58] testament writings
[0:59] is profitable for doctrine reproof
[1:02] correction
[1:03] and instruction in righteousness
[1:06] rightly dividing the old testament
[1:08] scripture
[1:09] new testament teachers must rightly
[1:11] divide the word of truth
[1:13] old testament scripture is to be rightly
[1:16] divided
[1:16] or placed in one or more of the nine
[1:19] following categories
[1:22] ceremonial laws not in effect for
[1:24] christians but in effect
[1:26] for jews laws not in effect for
[1:28] christians
[1:29] but in effect for jews moral laws still
[1:32] in effect
[1:33] for jews and christians allegorical
[1:37] truths for christians
[1:39] foreshadowing for christians direct
[1:42] prophecy for jews and christians history
[1:46] for jews and christians
[1:48] wisdom for jews and christians psalms
[1:51] for jews and christians
[1:55] these nine categories provide structure
[1:57] for correctly placing scripture
[1:59] but are not meant to limit a passage to
[2:01] only one category
[2:03] passages can be placed in multiple
[2:05] categories for example
[2:07] genesis 22 verse 8 says and
[2:10] abraham said my son god will provide
[2:13] himself
[2:14] a lamb for a burnt offering so they went
[2:17] both of them together
[2:18] as a new testament teacher i can place
[2:21] this scripture in
[2:22] three of the nine categories
[2:24] foreshadowing for christians
[2:26] direct prophecy for jews and christians
[2:28] and history for jews and christians
[2:31] genesis 22 verse 8 is foreshadowing for
[2:34] christians
[2:35] because god provided a lamb for abraham
[2:37] that foreshadowed him
[2:39] providing jesus christ the lamb of god
[2:42] for abraham's seed direct prophecy for
[2:45] jews and christians is a fitting
[2:47] category
[2:48] because god was prophesying that he
[2:49] alone would prepare the body of jesus
[2:51] christ
[2:52] to be a sacrifice for the sins of the
[2:54] whole world
[2:55] jews and gentiles included just as he
[2:58] alone prepared the lamb to take isaac's
[3:00] place
[3:01] on mount moriah genesis 22 verse 8
[3:04] is history for jews and gentiles because
[3:07] both groups can agree that the details
[3:09] and events of the passage
[3:11] are factual i must clarify the
[3:14] difference between christians and jews
[3:16] christians recognize jesus christ as the
[3:18] promised messiah
[3:19] the christ the redeemer of mankind and
[3:22] the one who fulfilled all the old
[3:24] testament prophecy about the son of god
[3:26] furthermore christians are those who
[3:28] have repented of their sins
[3:30] been baptized in the name of the lord
[3:32] jesus been born again of the spirit of
[3:34] god
[3:35] and are observing all of jesus's
[3:37] commands
[3:38] jews on the other hand do not believe
[3:40] jesus christ fulfilled the prophecies
[3:42] about their promised messiah
[3:45] true jews obey the laws of moses and
[3:47] have a zeal for god but do not have the
[3:50] knowledge that jesus christ
[3:51] is their messiah when israel rejected
[3:54] jesus as their messiah
[3:56] god chose to blind the eyes of the jews
[3:58] from believing in jesus
[4:00] christ in order that he might save the
[4:02] gentiles
[4:04] the nine categories first
[4:07] ceremonial laws are old testament laws
[4:10] that pertain to the aaronic priesthood
[4:12] that are no longer in effect for new
[4:14] testament believers
[4:15] but are in effect for jews some examples
[4:18] of these laws include sacrificing
[4:20] animals
[4:21] physical requirements for ministers and
[4:24] hereditary requirements for the
[4:26] priesthood
[4:27] however orthodox jews do not carry out
[4:29] the ceremonial laws because they lack
[4:32] a temple second old testament laws that
[4:35] are no longer in effect for the new
[4:36] testament
[4:37] include various laws such as
[4:39] circumcision prohibited foods
[4:41] and the instant death penalty for
[4:43] blasphemy
[4:44] these laws were given to israel through
[4:46] the prophet moses to all the children of
[4:48] israel but are no longer in effect
[4:50] in the new testament third there are
[4:53] many moral laws from the old testament
[4:54] that are still in effect today
[4:56] including the ten commandments numerous
[4:58] abominations
[4:59] and tithing the ten commandments of
[5:02] moses are still in effect in the new
[5:04] testament
[5:04] as shown in figure one although saturday
[5:07] sabbath-keeping
[5:08] has a different application for
[5:10] christians
[5:12] a separate section of this chapter
[5:13] addresses the fourth commandment
[5:16] the abominations of homosexuality
[5:18] justifying the wicked
[5:20] worshipping graven images and partaking
[5:22] in idolatry are still abominable in the
[5:25] sight of god today
[5:26] for new testament believers figure 1
[5:30] the 10 commandments from exodus chapter
[5:32] 20 verses 1 to 17
[5:35] and its corresponding new testament
[5:37] scripture
[5:38] the first commandment no other gods
[5:40] before me still in effect according to
[5:43] matthew 4
[5:44] verse 10. the second commandment make no
[5:47] graven
[5:48] images still in effect in the new
[5:50] testament according to revelation 9
[5:52] verse 20
[5:53] and acts 17 29 the third commandment do
[5:57] not take the name of the lord in vain
[5:59] still in effect in the new testament
[6:01] according to matthew 6 verse 9.
[6:05] the fourth commandment keep the sabbath
[6:07] day holy
[6:08] this has a new application in the new
[6:10] testament according to hebrews
[6:12] 4 verse 9 and matthew 11 verse 28.
[6:16] the new testament sabbath is the
[6:18] believer resting or ceasing from
[6:20] his sinful works and then doing the
[6:22] works of the holy ghost
[6:24] this spiritual rest begins when a person
[6:26] is born again
[6:27] of the holy ghost according to isaiah 28
[6:30] verses 11 and 12
[6:31] first corinthians 14 verses 21 and 22
[6:35] and hebrews 4 verses 1 through 12.
[6:40] the fifth commandment honor thy father
[6:42] and mother still in effect in the new
[6:44] testament according to ephesians chapter
[6:46] 6
[6:46] verses 1-3 the sixth commandment
[6:50] thou shalt not kill still in effect in
[6:53] the new testament according to galatians
[6:55] 5
[6:55] verse 21 the seventh commandment thou
[7:00] shalt not commit adultery
[7:02] still in effect in the new testament
[7:03] according to first corinthians 6
[7:05] verses 9 and 10. the eighth commandment
[7:09] thou shalt not steal
[7:11] still in effect in the new testament
[7:13] according to first corinthians 6
[7:14] verse 10 the ninth commandment
[7:18] thou shalt not bear false witness stone
[7:20] effect in the new testament
[7:22] according to ephesians 4 verse 25
[7:25] the tenth commandment thou shalt not
[7:27] covet still in effect
[7:29] according to first corinthians 6 verse
[7:31] 10.
[7:33] fourth there is a category called
[7:35] allegorical truths that
[7:36] certain old testament scriptures can be
[7:38] placed into for our learning
[7:41] allegories are symbolic expressions that
[7:43] are interpreted
[7:44] to reveal a hidden meaning examples
[7:47] include
[7:48] ishmael and isaac manasseh and ephraim
[7:51] and abraham's faith in isaac as his seed
[7:55] ishmael the son of the bondwoman hagar
[7:57] represents those
[7:58] under the old testament law who were
[8:00] trying to earn salvation through their
[8:02] own fleshly efforts
[8:04] isaac represented new testament
[8:06] believers who were believing the
[8:07] promises of god by faith
[8:09] and were saved by grace manasseh the
[8:12] firstborn son
[8:13] represents the jews who should have
[8:16] received christ as their messiah
[8:17] as he was first sent to them ephraim the
[8:20] younger
[8:21] represents the gentiles who receive the
[8:24] blessing through the cross
[8:25] or crossed hands of their grandfather
[8:27] jacob
[8:29] galatians declares the blessing of
[8:31] abraham came upon the gentiles through
[8:33] the cross of jesus christ
[8:35] although god asked abraham to sacrifice
[8:37] his son isaac
[8:39] hebrews teaches that abraham had
[8:41] accounted that god was able to raise him
[8:43] up from the dead
[8:45] instead god provided a ram to die in
[8:47] isaac's place
[8:48] and abraham received him in a figure or
[8:51] allegory
[8:52] of jesus christ taking our place in
[8:54] death
[8:56] foreshadowing for christians is the
[8:58] fifth category and are referred to as
[9:00] types
[9:01] types foretell someone or some event to
[9:03] come in the future
[9:05] examples of types include the role of
[9:07] joseph as savior
[9:08] and abraham's divinely provided ram as a
[9:11] substitutionary sacrifice
[9:14] joseph son of jacob was a type of jesus
[9:17] christ
[9:17] as he was sold for 20 pieces of silver
[9:20] which foreshadowed jesus being sold for
[9:22] 30 pieces of silver
[9:24] this fifth category requires bible
[9:26] teachers to be careful how they
[9:28] interpret types
[9:29] as not all types are a perfect match
[9:32] like the example of joseph being sold
[9:34] for 20 pieces of silver
[9:35] and yet jesus was sold for 30 pieces
[9:38] just as joseph was falsely accused and
[9:41] put in prison
[9:42] so was jesus arrested falsely while
[9:45] incarcerated
[9:46] joseph and jesus were both surrounded by
[9:48] two men one lived and one died
[9:51] abraham's divinely provided ram as a
[9:54] sacrifice
[9:55] foreshadowed jesus as god's promised
[9:57] sacrifice for mankind
[10:00] the ram took the place of abraham's son
[10:02] or seed
[10:04] likewise god supernaturally prepared the
[10:06] body of jesus christ
[10:08] through the spirit's conception in the
[10:09] womb of the virgin mary
[10:11] and led his son to die for abraham's
[10:14] spiritual seed
[10:16] there is an exciting prophetic aspect to
[10:19] foreshadowing
[10:20] at times the holy spirit speaks through
[10:22] old testament stories
[10:23] to instruct us regarding future events
[10:26] such as the second coming of jesus
[10:28] christ
[10:29] we can use the life of joseph son of
[10:31] jacob for an example of the second
[10:33] coming of christ
[10:35] joseph and his brothers represent jesus
[10:37] and his brethren
[10:38] the jewish people we know joseph's
[10:40] brothers were blinded to his identity
[10:42] when they went to egypt to request food
[10:45] but joseph
[10:46] eventually revealed his identity to them
[10:48] and saved their lives
[10:50] scripture teaches that joseph put out
[10:52] everyone from before him
[10:54] which would have included his wife when
[10:56] he revealed his identity to his brothers
[10:59] allegorically we know the scriptural
[11:01] fact that jesus
[11:02] brethren the jews are currently blinded
[11:05] to his identity
[11:06] as their messiah so that the gentiles
[11:09] can be saved
[11:10] but one day jesus will reveal his true
[11:12] identity to the jews
[11:14] and he will save them from their sins
[11:16] christ will seal them with the baptism
[11:18] of the holy ghost
[11:19] which is the seal of god described as
[11:22] the seal of god in their foreheads
[11:24] this foreshadow helps teach that the
[11:26] wife of jesus christ
[11:28] the new testament gentile believers will
[11:30] be gone from the earth and raptured up
[11:33] into heaven while jesus stands on mount
[11:36] zion
[11:36] and reveals his identity to his brethren
[11:39] the 144
[11:41] 000 believing israelis
[11:45] the sixth category is direct prophecy
[11:47] and three examples of this category are
[11:49] the rapture
[11:50] the new heavens and earth and jesus's
[11:53] resurrection
[11:54] regarding the rapture it is striking to
[11:56] find that paul used
[11:57] isaiah 25 verse 8 as a direct prophecy
[12:01] for the gentile church
[12:03] in first corinthians 15 verse 54.
[12:06] we should learn a critical lesson in
[12:07] this category the holy ghost can
[12:10] seemingly pull
[12:10] out a scripture from any old testament
[12:13] location
[12:14] and apply it to the new testament
[12:15] believer in any way he purposes
[12:19] god's ways are past finding out he is
[12:21] the author of the word and thereby
[12:23] is the only one that knows how to
[12:25] correctly interpret scripture
[12:28] the new heavens and new earth are direct
[12:30] prophecies found in both the old and new
[12:32] testaments
[12:34] peter echoes isaiah's prophecy and then
[12:36] reminds us to be diligent
[12:38] and steadfast in our walk with the lord
[12:41] jesus resurrection is directly
[12:43] prophesied by david
[12:45] in psalm 16 verse 10 and then recorded
[12:48] as fulfilled in acts 2
[12:50] verse 27.
[12:53] history wisdom and psalms are the final
[12:55] three categories
[12:57] old testament history includes all the
[12:59] events and details
[13:00] from the creation of the world in
[13:02] genesis until the conclusion
[13:04] of the book of malachi books of wisdom
[13:07] include proverbs and ecclesiastes
[13:10] the psalms include 150 songs that focus
[13:13] on the themes of god's glory and wisdom
[13:17] numerous songs are prayers to god and
[13:19] also include heartfelt lamentations
[13:22] that both jews and gentiles can
[13:24] appreciate
[13:26] the new testament sabbath the saturday
[13:29] sabbath day
[13:29] is the only command of the ten
[13:31] commandments that has a new application
[13:33] for christians
[13:34] christians must not be deceived into
[13:36] thinking they will be lost if they work
[13:38] on saturday
[13:39] although there are physical and
[13:40] spiritual benefits to slowing down our
[13:42] lifestyles
[13:43] jesus taught that there is something
[13:45] greater than just resting one day of the
[13:47] week
[13:49] jesus christ offered rest for our souls
[13:52] not just
[13:52] rest for our bodies after his
[13:55] resurrection
[13:56] jesus breathed on his disciples
[13:58] constraining them to receive the
[13:59] born-again experience
[14:01] the baptism of the holy ghost the
[14:03] obedient disciples
[14:05] honored their master and did indeed
[14:07] receive the born-again experience
[14:09] or soul rest as recorded in acts chapter
[14:12] 2.
[14:13] soul rest means that jesus wants us to
[14:15] rest completely
[14:16] from our sinful works the new testament
[14:19] sabbath
[14:20] is for the christian to be born again of
[14:22] the holy spirit
[14:23] and to trust or rest in god
[14:26] the prophet isaiah foretold this
[14:28] born-again experience or soul rest
[14:30] more than 700 years before jesus christ
[14:33] lived on the earth
[14:34] isaiah said for with stammering lips and
[14:37] another tongue
[14:38] will he speak to this people to whom he
[14:40] said
[14:41] this is the rest wherewith ye may cause
[14:44] the weary to rest
[14:45] and this is the refreshing yet they
[14:47] would not hear
[14:49] notice that isaiah plainly said this is
[14:52] the rest
[14:53] the new rest is connected to god using
[14:56] stammering lips to speak to his people
[14:58] which is fulfilled in acts chapter 2 for
[15:01] they spoke with tongues
[15:02] as the spirit gave them utterance in
[15:05] first corinthians 14 verse 21
[15:08] paul later quotes isaiah 28 verses 11
[15:11] and 12
[15:12] and connects it to the tongues that were
[15:14] given to the jews
[15:15] and all other unbelieving nations in
[15:17] acts chapter 2.
[15:20] paul wrote that saturday sabbath days
[15:21] were a shadow of things to come
[15:23] in colossians 2 verses 16 and 17.
[15:27] god's purpose of saturday sabbath
[15:29] keeping in the old testament
[15:31] points to something greater to come
[15:33] jesus teaches that the true rest
[15:35] is the born-again experience he
[15:37] proclaims in john 3
[15:39] verse 7 and john 7 verses 37 and 39
[15:44] in reference to believers receiving the
[15:46] holy ghost jesus says
[15:47] ye must be born again and if any man
[15:50] thirsts let him come unto me and drink
[15:53] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[15:55] hath said
[15:56] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[15:58] living water
[16:00] in the born-again experience a christian
[16:02] rests or walks according to the spirit
[16:05] and does not fulfill the lusts of the
[16:07] flesh for the remainder of his earthly
[16:09] walk
[16:10] the spirit-filled christian will rest or
[16:12] cease from doing lustful sinful habits
[16:15] and will do works that please god now
[16:17] that's a true rest
[16:19] i would much rather rest for my sinful
[16:21] works every day of my life
[16:23] than just relaxing on each saturday but
[16:25] continue in sinful works
[16:28] if you can see the truth about the
[16:30] spiritual rest god is offering today
[16:32] and enter into that rest your obedience
[16:35] will delight the
[16:36] lord jesus christ our god delights more
[16:38] in
[16:39] constant daily rest from sin than just
[16:42] physically resting one day of the week
[16:44] thankfully if we truly receive the
[16:46] baptism of the holy ghost
[16:48] and rest from our sinful lives we will
[16:50] actually have a physical day of rest
[16:52] built into our week
[16:53] which is sunday how great is the wisdom
[16:57] of our god
[16:58] just as the early christians met on the
[17:00] first day of the week
[17:02] so we meet every sunday to honor the
[17:04] resurrection of jesus christ
[17:06] true christians will not forsake the
[17:08] assembling of the saints on the first
[17:10] day of the week
[17:11] because sincere meetings provide
[17:12] spiritual meat edification
[17:15] comfort consolation and more
[17:19] two or three witnesses the holy spirit
[17:22] guides bible teachers
[17:23] to correctly categorize an old testament
[17:25] scripture in one or more of the nine
[17:27] categories
[17:29] to prove the classification is correct
[17:31] the spirit provides the teachers with
[17:33] two or three witnesses from other bible
[17:35] passages
[17:37] jesus and paul both speak of the
[17:38] necessity of having multiple witnesses
[17:41] to establish a word of truth isaiah
[17:44] writes a similar thought that doctrine
[17:46] or instruction must be built line upon
[17:48] line
[17:49] precept upon precept faithful bible
[17:51] teachers use more than one scripture to
[17:53] support their beliefs
[17:55] three doctrinal examples of using two or
[17:57] three scriptural witnesses to prove that
[17:59] an old testament command
[18:01] remains binding in the new testament are
[18:03] the sin of homosexuality
[18:05] the command for children to honor their
[18:07] parents and paying tithes to one's
[18:10] local church all three of these subjects
[18:12] are relevant to and essential for
[18:14] today's world
[18:16] the sin of homosexuality was an
[18:18] abomination in the old testament
[18:20] and is still a sin today homosexuality
[18:23] has multiple
[18:23] old testament witnesses to establish it
[18:26] as a sin
[18:28] three new testament witnesses
[18:29] established this act as a deplorable sin
[18:32] romans 1 verses 26 through 32
[18:35] first corinthians 6 verses 9 through 11
[18:38] and first timothy 1 verses 10 and 11.
[18:42] with two or three witnesses in both the
[18:44] old and new testaments
[18:45] homosexuality is easily placed in the
[18:48] category
[18:49] of moral laws still in effect for jews
[18:52] and christians
[18:54] the fifth commandment of moses for
[18:56] children to honor their parents
[18:57] is taught in the old testament in exodus
[18:59] 20 verse 12
[19:01] and deuteronomy 5 verse 16.
[19:04] but is this command still required today
[19:06] yes
[19:07] because the fifth command has two new
[19:09] testament bible witnesses
[19:11] matthew 19 verse 19 and ephesians 6
[19:15] verses 1 and 2. just as in the case of
[19:18] homosexuality
[19:19] we conclude from the multiple bible
[19:21] witnesses that children must honor their
[19:23] parents
[19:24] as a binding command in the new
[19:26] testament
[19:27] faithful bible teachers place this
[19:29] command in the category
[19:30] of moral laws still in effect for jews
[19:33] and christians
[19:36] a third example is tithing 10 of your
[19:38] income to your local church
[19:40] in the old testament tithing predated
[19:42] the law of moses
[19:43] as both abraham and jacob tithed
[19:46] leviticus 27 verse 30 and deuteronomy 12
[19:50] verse 11
[19:51] are two of the numerous scriptures that
[19:53] commanded tithing in the old testament
[19:56] but is tithing a new testament command
[19:59] yes
[19:59] there are five reasons tithing is still
[20:01] a new testament command
[20:03] and should be placed in the category of
[20:05] moral laws
[20:06] still in effect for jews and christians
[20:09] first the new testament never abolishes
[20:11] tithing
[20:12] second jesus said tithing was one of the
[20:14] least of the commands
[20:16] which means it is still command third
[20:19] jesus never stopped anyone from paying
[20:21] tithes
[20:22] fourth paul teaches that the ministers
[20:25] who preach the gospel
[20:26] should live of the gospel in first
[20:28] corinthians 9
[20:29] verses 9 and 14. the apostle referenced
[20:33] the old testament
[20:34] lesson of not muzzling the ox that
[20:36] treads out the corn
[20:37] and applied it to new testament
[20:39] preachers
[20:41] last hebrews records that abraham
[20:43] willingly paid ties to melchizedek
[20:45] who was god in a flesh body as a
[20:48] prefigure of the true high priest
[20:50] jesus christ since abraham the father of
[20:53] the faith
[20:54] paid tithes without a written command
[20:57] the holy spirit compels christians
[20:59] to pay tithes and offerings because
[21:01] believers are the children
[21:02] or seed of abraham through faith in
[21:05] jesus christ
[21:07] we are not under the law one common
[21:10] phrase i often hear in reply to my bible
[21:12] teaching on doctrine is
[21:14] we are not under the old testament
[21:17] however
[21:17] paul often uses old testament scripture
[21:20] to provide
[21:20] authority for new testament living there
[21:23] is value in teaching from the entire
[21:25] bible
[21:26] as paul said all scripture is given by
[21:28] inspiration of god
[21:30] and is profitable for doctrine for
[21:32] reproof
[21:33] for correction for instruction in
[21:35] righteousness
[21:37] clearly we are not obligated to fulfill
[21:40] every command in the old testament
[21:42] all the ceremonial laws of sacrificial
[21:44] rituals
[21:45] were a shadow of good things to come
[21:47] that jesus christ's crucifixion
[21:49] fulfilled christ declared it is finished
[21:52] on the cross signaling the end to the
[21:55] aaronic priesthood
[21:56] and beginning of the new covenant with
[21:58] better promises
[22:01] paul's writings from romans and
[22:02] galatians teach that we are not
[22:04] under the law meaning we are not saved
[22:07] by our individual works
[22:08] or by our own righteousness the law has
[22:11] the power to curse anyone who does not
[22:13] keep
[22:14] every single old testament commandment
[22:17] in contrast
[22:18] new testament believers are saved by
[22:20] grace through faith in jesus christ
[22:23] for christ bore the curse of god for our
[22:26] sins
[22:26] on the cross of calvary thus the phrase
[22:30] we are not under the old testament is
[22:32] true but must be applied correctly
[22:35] new testament teachers should use
[22:36] appropriate old testament scripture
[22:39] to build doctrine as paul did in
[22:41] ephesians
[22:42] and first corinthians paul affirmed the
[22:44] fifth commandment
[22:45] that children should honor their parents
[22:48] if christians are not under the old
[22:50] testament
[22:50] then where did paul get his authority to
[22:53] teach the children
[22:54] are to obey their parents and also
[22:56] promise them a long life on the earth
[22:58] paul's authority to teach the fifth
[23:00] commandment to christians came from
[23:02] jesus
[23:03] as he was taught his gospel by the
[23:05] revelation of jesus christ
[23:07] it's clear that the fifth commandment is
[23:09] categorized as a moral law
[23:11] still in effect for jews and christians
[23:14] the righteousness of the law is still
[23:15] important to god today
[23:17] when christians walk in obedience to the
[23:19] holy spirit they are fulfilling the
[23:21] righteousness of the law
[23:24] first corinthians 15 verses 51 to 58
[23:28] also demonstrates paul's reliance on the
[23:30] old testament passages
[23:32] as foundation for new testament truths
[23:35] while writing about the future event of
[23:37] the rapture the holy spirit inspired
[23:39] paul to use the same bible phrase as the
[23:41] prophet isaiah
[23:43] death is swallowed up in victory written
[23:46] over
[23:46] 800 years earlier thus both isaiah
[23:50] and paul were preparing us for the
[23:52] catching away of the spirit-filled
[23:54] saints
[23:54] as we look for that blessed hope and the
[23:57] glorious appearing of the great
[23:59] god and our savior jesus christ
[24:02] isaiah 28 verse 8 is categorized as
[24:05] direct prophecy for
[24:07] jews and christians
[24:10] along with these two examples the new
[24:12] testament is replete with references
[24:14] to god's words from the old covenant
[24:17] bible teachers must use the old
[24:19] testament as directed by the holy ghost
[24:21] we owe it to ourselves and those in our
[24:23] realm of influence
[24:24] to continue to study and understand the
[24:26] old testament
[24:27] as the spirit of truth guides us to
[24:30] rightly divide the word of truth
[24:33] a study into new testament teaching will
[24:36] help you understand that we are to
[24:37] fulfill
[24:38] the righteousness of the law according
[24:40] to romans 8 verse 4.
[24:43] christians should willingly choose to
[24:44] obey god's word
[24:46] obeying the will of the holy spirit the
[24:48] law that we are currently under
[24:50] is the law of the spirit this holy law
[24:53] will never lead us into sin
[24:55] but rather into complete obedience to
[24:57] the word of god
[24:58] jesus walked in the law of the spirit in
[25:01] his life
[25:02] because the spirit abode upon him the
[25:04] spirit led christ
[25:06] into full obedience to the word of god
[25:08] and so the spirit will lead our lives
[25:10] the exact same way
[25:13] law of moses was holy just and good but
[25:16] without the power of the new testament
[25:18] relationship with god
[25:20] the believer could not fulfill the
[25:21] righteousness of the law
[25:24] christians today should not despise the
[25:25] law of moses but rather
[25:27] desire to obey the holy nature of the
[25:30] law and those righteous commands that
[25:32] god has carried over
[25:33] into the new testament obeying the holy
[25:36] nature is possible
[25:37] because god's spirit now writes his law
[25:40] upon the fleshly tables of our hearts
[25:42] god's nature has become our nature
[25:47] blanket statements we are not under the
[25:50] law
[25:50] seems to be a blanket statement that
[25:52] people use who do not want to hear old
[25:54] testament scripture
[25:56] used to teach new testament believers
[25:58] believers are called to grow in the
[26:00] knowledge and understanding of god
[26:02] christians should never answer a matter
[26:04] before hearing it as modeled by the
[26:06] saints in berea
[26:07] who search the scripture daily to
[26:09] determine the truth of paul's preaching
[26:11] proverbs says answering a matter too
[26:14] soon
[26:14] without studying it out is a shame and
[26:17] sign of folly
[26:19] some blatant statements are true or
[26:21] partially true
[26:22] while others are false i want to give
[26:25] examples of each kind of statement to
[26:27] help the reader learn how to rightly
[26:28] divide
[26:29] every blanket statement for every
[26:31] blanket statement needs
[26:33] two or three witnesses to prove it true
[26:36] a well-known blanket statement that is
[26:38] true is jesus christ is the only way to
[26:41] the father
[26:42] and no one gets to heaven except through
[26:44] christ
[26:46] this is true based upon john 14 verse 6
[26:49] acts 4 verse 12 and matthew 25 verses
[26:53] 31-46 most bible readers are very
[26:56] familiar with john 14
[26:58] 6 and acts 4 12 but matthew 25 verses 31
[27:02] to 46
[27:03] provides additional support to the fact
[27:05] that no one will enter
[27:06] eternal life except through the mercy of
[27:09] jesus christ
[27:11] in this scene of separation on the day
[27:12] of judgment we see jesus granting
[27:15] eternal life to surprised individuals
[27:18] these surprised ones question when did
[27:20] we help you
[27:21] thereby deserving eternal life this
[27:24] question
[27:25] shows two great truths first the least
[27:28] christian
[27:29] is a genuine representation and
[27:31] ambassador of jesus christ
[27:32] on this earth although not recognized
[27:35] as such by the world some who do good
[27:39] acts to the least known christians
[27:41] will receive eternal life from jesus
[27:43] christ
[27:44] second there will be surprises on the
[27:46] day of judgment from this text it seems
[27:49] possible that perhaps
[27:50] muslims buddhists or members of other
[27:53] faiths
[27:53] that reject jesus christ as savior may
[27:56] be granted eternal life
[27:58] simply due to their treatment of his
[28:00] faithful followers
[28:01] the true christians perhaps gamalia and
[28:04] nicodemus
[28:05] will be granted life because they stood
[28:07] for christians in a time of trouble
[28:10] here are some true blanket statements
[28:12] regarding bible doctrine
[28:14] that may surprise you but yet are 100
[28:16] percent
[28:17] accurate with at least two or three
[28:19] witnesses from scripture
[28:21] no person in the new testament was ever
[28:23] recorded as being baptized in the titles
[28:25] father son and holy ghost all recorded
[28:28] baptisms
[28:29] use the literal name of jesus christ
[28:32] lord jesus
[28:33] or lord god never asked one godly woman
[28:36] to cut or trim her hair
[28:38] instead all godly women had uncut hair
[28:41] as seen in numerous texts john 12 verses
[28:44] 1 to 8
[28:46] luke 7 verses 36 to 50 first corinthians
[28:49] 11
[28:50] verses 1 to 16 and revelation 9
[28:53] verse 8. god never called himself three
[28:57] persons
[28:57] because he is one person instead he said
[29:00] he was the only god and there was no one
[29:02] beside him
[29:05] jesus was never called the second person
[29:07] because he is the physical image of
[29:09] god's one person
[29:11] instead he was called emmanuel mighty
[29:13] god
[29:14] and everlasting father
[29:18] jesus never called a woman to be an
[29:19] apostle our lord called
[29:21] only men to be apostles additionally
[29:24] paul forbade any woman from teaching men
[29:26] according to first timothy 2 verse 12
[29:29] and first corinthians 14 verses 34 and
[29:32] 35
[29:36] the apostles never asked anyone if they
[29:38] wanted to invite jesus into their hearts
[29:40] for salvation
[29:41] instead the apostles preached repentance
[29:44] immersion water
[29:45] and the infilling of the holy ghost this
[29:48] list could indeed grow
[29:50] but i hope it opened your eyes to the
[29:51] fact that much of modern christendom
[29:54] has strayed from teaching sound bible
[29:56] doctrine
[29:57] before making a blanket statement about
[29:59] the bible search the scriptures to
[30:01] answer each question that may come to
[30:03] your mind
[30:06] abominations an abomination is one
[30:09] specific type of moral law
[30:11] that means a disgusting thing in the
[30:13] sight of god according to the hebrew
[30:15] lexicon
[30:16] deuteronomy 12 31 states that god hates
[30:19] abominations
[30:21] god's holy eternal city the new
[30:23] jerusalem
[30:24] will not have any abominable work within
[30:27] its domain
[30:28] since there are 166 scriptures that
[30:30] mention abominations
[30:32] it behooves us to know which acts are
[30:34] abominations in the sight of god today
[30:37] because we want to live in the new
[30:38] jerusalem with christ jesus for all
[30:41] eternity
[30:43] after reading all 166 abomination
[30:45] scriptures
[30:46] i have found three old testament
[30:48] abominations that are no longer
[30:51] abominable in the sight of god for the
[30:53] new testament believer
[30:55] eating a peace offering on the third day
[30:58] offering a blemish animal sacrifice
[31:00] and eating unclean foods eating a peace
[31:04] offering on the third day is no longer
[31:06] an abomination
[31:07] because new testament believers are no
[31:09] longer required to offer
[31:10] animal sacrifices as jesus christ was
[31:13] the
[31:14] once for all sacrifice that god has
[31:16] provided for believers
[31:18] jesus is both our offering in peace as
[31:21] we have peace with god
[31:22] through our lord jesus christ offering a
[31:25] blemish animal sacrifice is no longer an
[31:28] abomination
[31:29] in the new testament because we have
[31:30] already established that god gave us the
[31:32] offering of the body of jesus christ
[31:35] to replace the blood of bulls and goats
[31:38] but it is important to note that our
[31:39] worship in the new testament
[31:41] must be according to the spirit and
[31:43] truth or else the worship is offered in
[31:45] vain
[31:47] there is a spiritual application of this
[31:48] old testament abomination
[31:50] that we can apply to our worship today
[31:52] as we must offer our bodies as a living
[31:55] sacrifice
[31:56] unto god unclean foods from the israeli
[32:00] diet are no longer abominations for the
[32:02] new testament believer
[32:03] as evidenced through peter's heavenly
[32:05] vision in acts 10 verses 9 to 18.
[32:09] the fact that god did away with these
[32:11] dietary abominations
[32:12] was so surprising that peter told the
[32:15] lord not so
[32:16] three times after the lord instructed
[32:18] him to rise
[32:20] kill and eat all manner of four-footed
[32:22] beasts
[32:23] wild beasts creeping things and fowls of
[32:26] the air
[32:27] paul's teaching supports god's visions
[32:29] to peter
[32:30] saying for every creature of god is good
[32:34] and nothing to be refused if it be
[32:36] received with thanksgiving
[32:38] for it is sanctified by the word of god
[32:40] and prayer
[32:41] the only dietary restrictions for
[32:43] christians are not eating blood
[32:45] strangled animals or foods dedicated
[32:48] unto idols
[32:51] here is a list of the abominations that
[32:52] still remain detestable to god
[32:55] and the new testament believer and are
[32:57] categorized
[32:58] as moral laws still in effect for jews
[33:01] and christians
[33:03] note that each abomination has at least
[33:05] two or three witnesses
[33:07] according to the rule for establishing
[33:09] an old testament moral law
[33:11] as a binding command for the new

[35:15] god's immutable character allows us to
[35:17] rightly divide the actions that either
[35:19] gain his approval
[35:20] or disapproval blessing or curse
[35:23] as satan increases his attacks against
[35:25] the true church
[35:27] faithful bible teachers need to continue
[35:29] giving more of their time
[35:30] focus attention and energy into
[35:33] denouncing abominations
[35:35] and feeding the people of god the truth
[35:38] true doctrine will save both the
[35:39] preacher
[35:40] and those that believe him
[35:45] magnifying the law to fulfill the law
[35:49] jesus christ did not come to earth to
[35:50] destroy the law but rather to fulfill it
[35:54] isaiah teaches that christ magnified the
[35:56] law saying
[35:57] he will magnify the law to magnify is to
[36:00] enlarge as with a microscope
[36:03] using a microscope you can see life
[36:04] forms that were previously
[36:06] unseen because they are enlarged jesus
[36:10] did the same enlarging of the law of
[36:12] moses
[36:12] when he preached the sermon on the mount
[36:14] in matthew
[36:16] concerning adultery in matthew 5 verses
[36:18] 27 through 32
[36:20] jesus magnified or enlarged the unseen
[36:24] root problem of adultery when he
[36:26] revealed a previously
[36:28] unseen life form causing it the spirit
[36:30] of lust
[36:32] jesus taught that imagining lustful
[36:34] adultery
[36:35] reaps the same guilt as committing the
[36:37] physical act
[36:39] the spirit of lust is simply a fallen
[36:41] angel or demon power
[36:43] otherwise known as an evil spirit the
[36:46] wisdom of jesus
[36:47] enlarged the law so we can examine the
[36:49] root problem of adultery
[36:51] which is the unseen evil spirit of lust
[36:55] thankfully christians can clean the
[36:57] inside of their cups
[36:58] or their thought lives and be truly
[37:00] clean before the lord
[37:02] conversely the pharisees cleaned only
[37:04] the outside of the cup and not the
[37:06] inside as we clean out our minds
[37:09] bringing every thought into the
[37:10] captivity of christ we submit ourselves
[37:13] to the law of the spirit
[37:15] as a result the spirit quickens or makes
[37:17] the word of god live in our personal
[37:19] lives
[37:19] on a daily basis scripture teaches that
[37:23] you can fulfill
[37:24] all of the law through one powerful
[37:26] channel love
[37:28] paul said you should owe only love to
[37:30] others
[37:31] and that love would fulfill all the law
[37:34] this love would not have been possible
[37:36] without the work of jesus christ on
[37:38] calvary
[37:39] as he shed his love upon us in the form
[37:41] of the holy ghost
[37:43] true love is the holy spirit for the
[37:45] holy spirit
[37:46] is god and god is love
[37:49] christians do not seek to destroy the
[37:51] old testament like
[37:52] christ believers see the magnification
[37:55] of the old testament laws
[37:56] and understand how the law of the spirit
[37:59] helps them fulfill
[38:00] all righteousness and obedience in their
[38:03] daily lives
[38:06] conclusion the holy spirit always
[38:09] rightly divides the word of truth
[38:11] in the mouth of two or three witnesses
[38:14] faithful bible teachers and students
[38:16] test all statements with scripture to
[38:18] find whether they are true
[38:20] including blanket statements creeds and
[38:22] traditions of men
[38:24] proving all things now that you know how
[38:26] the holy spirit rightly divides the word
[38:28] of truth
[38:29] you can begin looking into all scripture
[38:31] to understand god's perfect will for
[38:33] your outward appearance
[38:35] beginning with the four guidelines for
[38:37] modest clothing
