TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name give him a title thus sayth the Lord amen hallelujah hallelujah huj the baptism using the title of father son Holy Ghost is false greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to share a wonderful Revelation that my brother Simon shared with me and he heard a little bit about it from a preacher online and then he went and searched the scriptures and found how King Saul only used the titles of David when he had an evil spirit on him but then when he repented he used the literal name of David and of course this is a beautiful type of the denominational churches how they have evil spirits on them and they use the father son Holy Ghost baptism the titles baptism rather than the baptism using the literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA we're coming up on our 18th year anniversary by the grace of God and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his true Prophet his genuine Prophet The Late William brandham 1909 to 1965 and I defend The Godly character of brother William brandham so I'll start by sharing a few weeks ago my brother Simon preached for us and he was listening to a sermon online and the preacher said that King Saul only used the titles of David when he had an evil Spirit on him and so brother Simon went and found those scriptures and then combined it with some other wonderful scriptures and preach it to us and I was just shouting and rejoicing in the back of the congregation I never heard this Revelation before so Simon didn't originate it but he found the scriptures that taught this wonderful Revelation and magnifies the literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ in water baptism of course also and it goes along with Colossians 3:17 whatsoever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible doesn't say to do all things in the titles father son Holy Ghost it's the Lord Jesus Christ so let's teach us again by the scripture if you go to Matthew 28:19 Jesus said to baptize in the name the one name singular name of the father son Holy Ghost and as my previous video showed the name of the father son Holy Ghost is Jesus Jesus means Jehovah is our salvation and then acts 236 says Jesus is both Lord and Christ Matthew 5:43 said Jesus came in his father's name so the name of the father is Jesus Jehovah and then Matthew 1:21 Mary was told to name the child the son Jesus so the name of the son is Jesus and then John 14:26 Jesus said the comforter will come in my name so the comforter comes in a name the Holy Ghost comes in a name it's in the name of Jesus and then here's this chart I've shown numerous times on videos Matthew 2819 Jesus said father son Holy Ghost then 10 days later on the day of Pentecost in Acts 238 Peter said baptized in the name of Jesus Christ in Acts 8:16 in Samaria the Bible said they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus in Acts 10:48 Peter said or Luke said they were baptized in the name of the Lord acts 19:5 at Ephesus the Bible says they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then Paul said he was baptized in the name of the Lord in Acts 22:16 so we can clearly see the only Bible formula for water baptism full immersion in water is using the literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ and also remember demons were only cast out using the name the literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's in Acts 16:18 Paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit I command the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour friends I've cast demons out a few times maybe six or seven times and each time it was using the literal name of Jesus Christ and reminding the devil about the power of the blood of Jesus Christ that happened a few times in South America mirac ous healings were done in the literal name of Jesus Christ not titles father son Holy Ghost that's in Acts 3:6 Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk Peter didn't say titles Father Son and Holy Ghost and so those are just a few of course you can go through the entire book of Acts and any other New Testament text there was no Supernatural miracle healing or baptism ever performed in titles it was always in the literal name name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's why we do it today that's why we know we're part of the book of Acts church we are continuation of the book of Acts church so we baptize we cast out demons we pray for the sick we rebuke evil spirits all in the literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ so getting to the story of Saul in 1st Samuel 16:14 an evil spirit comes on Saul but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him next we'll see Saul use the title son of Jesse numerous times we'll start in 1st Samuel 20 vers 30 and 31 then Saul's anger was K kindled against Jonathan he said unto him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not I know that thou has chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness verse 31 for as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground Thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom so this shows an evil spirit won't use the literal name and that's what we find in churches that do not have the revelation of the name of Jesus Christ they'll use titles father son Holy Ghost because they got a evil spirit the Bible calls it a spirit of Heir they've made an heir baptism is not performed in titles baptism is performed in the literal name of Jesus Christ next 1st Samuel 22:7 then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him here now ye benjamites will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and Vineyards make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds then verse 8 he says it again there is none that showeth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse and then 1st Samuel 2213 and Saul said unto him why have ye conspired against me thou and the son of Jesse and that thou has given him bread and a sword and a squir of God for him that he should rise against me to line weight as at this day another verse that shows Saul had influenced others in Israel to use the titles was first Kings 12:16 so when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in David neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse so they named David but then they call him also son of Jesse and then finally in 1st Samuel 24:16 Saul had repented of hunting down David and so that evil spirit left him he repented and then he uses the name David again after he repents and gets the evil spirit off him 1st Samuel 24:16 and it came to pass when David had made an end of speaking those words unto Saul that Saul saidis this thy voice my son David and Saul lifted up his voice and wept and remember of course David was a type of Christ David in the Hebrew means loving and in Matthew 317 the father said this is my beloved Son so Jesus was beloved David means loving the Bible said David was a man of war a man of blood and of course that's what Jesus was he was a man of war spiritually speaking and he spilled his blood for the sins of the whole world the Bible says 1 John 2:2 he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world praise God that Jesus Christ shed his blood for all the sins of the whole world and remember friends this is a tactic of Satan to not use the literal name of Jesus Christ brother Ram taught us that in the four seal he used Revelation 13:6 to show a threefold or triple blasphemy that the Beast system uses against the literal name of Jesus Christ the Bible said that he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name brother Ram said give him a title that's the first blasphemy the second is his Tabernacle which is the holy spirit's Dwelling Place the Beast makes it a place in Rome the Vatican City and then third he blasphemes them that dwell in heaven he blasphemes the Saints by saying they were intercessors what a beautiful Revelation the Holy Ghost reveals to brother Bram let's listen to the quote and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name give him a title his Tabernacle which is the holy spirit's dwelling place to make it a place in Rome a Vatican City you just go on down and then that dwell in heaven blasphemed them but saying they were intercessors and and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and he did and to overcome them he did in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God again a beautiful Revelation brother Simon caught from a preacher and then he goes and studies the word of God and gives us all this wonderful Bible evidence for this beautiful Revelation friends remember there's power in the name of Jesus Christ it's the literal name of Jesus Christ that was found in Acts 4:17 they asked the disciples by what power or but or by what name have you done this that's when Peter uttered those beautiful words acts 410 by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth even by him doth this man stand before you whole neither is there salvation in any other there salvation in the literal name of Jesus Christ and there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved so friends we rejoice in this Bible Revelation again this water baptism Revelation is Rock Solid thus sayith the Lord amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the baptism using the title of father son Holy Ghost is false thus sayth the Lord amen amen I command every one of you on here on tape that hasn't been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ be baptized again in the name of Jesus Christ amen Paul in Acts 59 195 said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe it said we know not where it be the Holy Ghost said what was you baptized amen they said we've been baptized but not in Christian baptism Father Son and Holy Ghost is not Christian baptism amen no Christian was ever baptized like that in the Bible amen or for hundreds of years after the Bible it's a Catholic Creed and not a Christian doctrine show me in the Bible amen it's a it's a fraud it's a working of devils amen I don't mean to say the people that's baptized like at are that way God's got a many person out there today that don't know no better but the hour has come am we've got to get back to the word if we expect God to work in this day like we live then the godhead Revelation is Rock Solid I believe everything the Bible says about the godhead and water baptism we just of course reject all the dogma and the additions to the word of God about the godhead and water baptism of course so friends be encouraged keep using the literal name of Jesus Christ it casts out Devils it does Miracles it's a name we're baptized in it's a name we're saved in the Lord Jesus Christ if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
