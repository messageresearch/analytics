TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ when will the Los Angeles earthquake happen a viewer recently asked me my opinion so this video provides my answer by God's grace I have four points on this subject and so I'll start with the first point the first point is likely no one knows when the Los Angeles earthquake will happen I do not know when the Los Angeles earthquake will happen and it seems no one else knows as well only the Lord Jesus Christ knows that answer and before moving on to the second Point Let's listen to a few quotes from Brother Branham where he prophesied that Los Angeles will sink beneath the ocean let's listen to the quotes say of the Lord it will wash these or she's one hour I don't know it will son look here do you know what the Lord says about Los Angeles these places here she's gone you remember what I told you about two years ago how that earthquake could come and can't up here in Alaska I also tell you that Hollywood in Los Angeles is sliding into the ocean California you're doomed not only in California but you world your doomed Church unless you get right with God you're doomed thus saith the Holy Spirit have you ever heard me use that name unless it now let's look at Point number two brother random said Los Angeles would sink before the coming of the Lord but he didn't say which coming of the Lord in the sermon who do you say this is in 1964 brother Branham said quote I predict before the coming of the Lord Jesus that God will sink that place I believe that Hollywood and Los Angeles and then filthy places over there that God Almighty will sink them they'll go beneath the bottom of the sea end quote so a couple things to notice first notice this is a prediction brother Branham never said thus say the Lord it would be before the coming of the Lord Jesus and then also we have to remember we don't know which coming brother Branham was referring to for example is it the Rapture coming which is the snatching away or catching away of the Gentile bride of Jesus Christ before the tribulation sets in or does Los Angeles sink before Jesus comes to the 144 000 Jews and seals them with the Holy Ghost around the middle of the seven year Great Tribulation period or is it during the second half of the Great Tribulation period before Armageddon so at this point friends I don't know and I don't think anyone else knows so we just want to be humble with this question and the answer now my opinion the one that makes sense to me is that the Los Angeles earthquake would happen before the battle of Armageddon towards the end of The Seven Year Great Tribulation period but that's just my humble opinion now let's look at point three it would likely be one of the major earthquakes mentioned in the Book of Revelation and so to me it seems like Revelation 16 Verse 18 would be the worst earthquake ever according to the Bible so the Book of Revelation lists five earthquakes total in The Sixth Seal in Revelation 6 verse 12 it mentions an earthquake and this might be the Los Angeles earthquake Where The Ram said The Sixth Seal was the tribulation seal initiated by Moses and Elijah or two men Anointed with their spirits second verse is in Revelation 8 verse 5. this might be the Los Angeles earthquake there's a higher possibility because it's after the reality form of the seventh seal happens or after the Rapture of the Gentile Church and this earthquake would likely be before the trumpets and vials the third earthquake is mentioned in Revelation 11 verse 13. I don't believe this is the Los Angeles earthquake because this is the Jerusalem earthquake right in the midst of Daniel's 70th week in the middle of the Great Tribulation and it seems like it's only in Jerusalem according to the context the fourth earthquake is Revelation 11 verse 19. this might be the Los Angeles earthquake there's a higher possibility it could be this one the scripture speaks of hail and an earthquake after the seventh trumpet sounds the last earthquake mentioned is revelation 16 verse 18. in my opinion this is most likely the Los Angeles earthquake because Revelation 16 Verse 18 speaks of a great earthquake such as not since men were upon the Earth so mighty an earthquake and so great so my question is how could there be a worse earthquake than an earthquake that would cause Los Angeles to fall into the sea and again this is during the seventh and final vial in the Book of Revelation my fourth and final point is Billy Paul's testimony some people put weight on Billy Paul's testimony concerning Los Angeles sinking now I myself I do not put a lot of weight on Billy Paul's testimony the quote that Billy Paul shares is not on tape so I don't consider it I respect and have brotherly love for Billy Paul as he and I have exchanged letters in the mail but I believe he essentially worships the tapes whether he'll admit it or not or recognize it or not so I do not put a lot of weight on his words there's an excerpt from Peregrine's book called the acts of the prophet and it says quote after making this statement he turned to his son said Billy where are you standing downtown Los Angeles Billy Paul replied where are you standing query the prophet in front of the May Company downtown Los Angeles reply Billy at this brother Branham made a prophetic statement Billy he said I may not be here but you won't be an old man until sharks will swim right where we are standing end quote so there's a few things about this quote we don't understand again it's not on brother Ram's tapes so brother Brown never shared it publicly even in this quote there's no thus saith the Lord for brother Branham third some people say this quote is fulfilled because there's some type of aquarium where they were standing and there's currently an aquarium there right now again I don't know I've never been to that part of Los Angeles another thing about the quote from Billy Paws that apparently brother Branham said you would not be an old man and yet brother Billy Paul is over 85 years old so this doesn't seem to make sense because brother Branham called himself an old man when he was in his 50s so that's another reason I do not put a lot of weight on Billy Paul's story and also friends Billy Paul says just press play and press play and Obey but he and his church and his brothers Church do not allow the full bible-based fivefold ministry like brother Branham did my friends at brother Brandon was here I believe he'd be right behind five-fold Ministry preachers and not behind the Press Play and press play and Obey tape Church movement because that's what brother Branham said in 1964 let's listen to the quote would we still be on fire and preach the gospel or is the time over no keep preaching just as hard as you can preach brother stay with it I'm right behind you and since we're on this topic let me just add a few more quotes where brother Brown said don't change a thing to the Evangelistic Ministry and of course that includes the entire fivefold Ministries so brother Branham said don't change a thing and of course Jeffersonville is guilty of changing the fivefold ministry and then a final quote where brother random says the message of the hour is the fivefold ministry and he never said press play and obey or just press play or change the fivefold ministry in any way we cannot change the five-fold ministry nor any other part of the Gospel because in Galatians 1 Paul says anyone is cursed who changes the Gospel of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quotes uh should evangelists continue on the field in this hour of course what they mean certainly by all means don't change the thing if Jesus is coming in the morning Preach Today like if it's going to be 10 years someday but live life is going to be in this hour don't don't get scribbled up now that's why I'm trying to warn you about see just don't be odd for junior don't change nothing but if you're doing something wrong or doing evil repent all right come back to God continue on your Evangelistic service just as you always did worth the bride of Christ have a Ministry before the Rapture sure that's what's going on right now I've got a kind of serving it is a message of the hour amen I think the bride of Christ sure she's consisted of Apostles prophets teachers vastness and pastors is that right that's a bride of Christ or she's got a Ministry great Ministries the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble I remember I'm not even sure it's the first one on my last son see remember what I preached on humility oh don't forget that I'm going to stop a minute to warn that again remember when God predicts anything great to happen the people are looking so far away but their wisdom till they miss what happens When God says anything is great the word always said it that bunch of ignoramuses that's right but when the great world the great High Church said boy that's glorious God says a bunch of ignorance I believe brother Brandon was here he'd be right behind the five full ministry preachers and not tape worshipers because tape worshipers essentially deny Ephesians 4 verses 8-16 Noah not Billy Paul nor Joseph Branham can change the Gospel of Jesus Christ that he revealed to Paul in Ephesians 4 verses 8 through 16. the fivefold ministry cannot be changed to add a mandatory press play Dogma either before or after a living Minister preaches the word only living men are called to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ as other videos of mine have shown in closing I hope this video was a blessing friends I've got numerous emails about this topic so I thought I'd make a short video about it and again I'm always open to correction by the word of God and by quotes really there's only one spirit that brings correction that's the spirit of Truth which is the Holy Ghost so friends the thing to do is fall more in love with the Lord Jesus Christ he promised if we're born again he would guide us into all truth we should search the Scriptures Daily for the Bible foundations that brother Brandon gave us if there's a great earthquake to come you would think it would be mentioned in the bible brother's Ministry came to point us back to the Bible so friends we're doing our best to rightly divide the word of Truth and we're preparing for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
