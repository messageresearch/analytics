TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now wait what did we have in that plainting time the farmer rine oh you say brother brand nonsense now wait just a minute you take the word farmer in Joel 2 and look at it and see if the Hebrew word you go to Hebrew and see if it don't if you want to write it down m o u r e h Mora and get the Hebrew word interpret see what Mora means teaching the teaching Reign has went forth Hallelujah the denominational teaching ring has went forth a million more and 44 Baptist so and so so and so members in the church or Roberts and then bothers with the Pentecostal moved the economic of the great uh uh Pentecostal move and moved up into the millions see that's right and the seed as went forth the word for the minority the group now watch now remember the word m o u r e H Mora means teaching the farmer rain it says the Mora rain the teaching rain teaching rain went forth Billy G has struck the world the Pentecostal struck the world and the word has struck the world now we said in the last days Joel told us the other part of the scriptures listen close now that that I would be a farmer and latter rain in the same season how many Christians know that say Amen sure what now the other day to my surprise when I looked farmer and latter rain would come in the same season now the word Farmer in the Hebrew word get your Hebrew uh lexon and find out the Hebrew word for Farmer means Mora Mora means teaching there will come a teaching Reign what is it putting the seeds into the Earth what's had what's going on well we find out that there's been a teaching Reign going on the Baptist people a million more in 44 was there goal members of the church Billy Grim's great revivals like great advances look what he done look at or Roberts and the Pentecostals there's been a teaching Reign G forth there's been a national teaching ring communism sold amongst the people every nation they've been talking so much about line not discarding you line Brethren but that's not line the line would have been your the power of God would have struck that thing and should trip the world the latter rain fixing to come what's the matter the church is manufacturing herself something just like Eve tried to do she tried to have more life to manufacture something we've had a Revival Joel said we fuss so much about line had movements called lat rain latter rain farmer rain in Rain outter rain I was reading the other day do you know what farmer rain means in the Hebrew word I can't call it right now I never wrote it down it skipped my mind but farmer rain the first rain means a rign of teaching the second Reign is the spirit that comes up on what's been taught and produces a crop why is it we had such a Revival Pentecostal Baptist all the other trees put forth their buds as Jesus said they would be and what are we hatched out the Baptist said they got a million more in 44 look at the Catholic how they increase look at all denomination look at Pentecost what do we do we seow denominational seeds we reap the denominational Harvest while the church ought to be on fire for God right now there have been a word seed solded back there and there be signs wonders miracles in that church to be together one heart one Accord and marching toward Zion for the Rapture Hallelujah right what did we do we had intellectual speeches instead of the word it is at such a time as this that the messenger of Malachi must come then in the latter reign will come a Mount Carmel Showdown watch this carefully now to see it in the word John was the Forerunner of Malachi 3 he planted the former rain and was rejected by the organizations of his day Jesus came and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown the second Forerunner of Christ will sow for the latter Reign Jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and Creeds for he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the Rapture the first Showdown was Mount Carmel the second was the mount Transfiguration and the third will be Mount Zion this age started just after the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power the Believers sensed this in their spirits and began crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long- awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain the latter rain then is the Harvest Reign how could this be the real thing when the teaching Reign had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turned the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the Rapture had not come in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you in it also was devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that it was not the real these people even before a second generation had appeared organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did
