[0:00] I was telling someone this afternoon in
[0:02] a little meeting I said every son that's
[0:05] born of God has to be tried first
[0:08] chastened I remember when I had mine my
[0:12] greatest hour when a when a man's born
[0:15] get there's a little spotlike size of
[0:16] his fingernail that God injects into him
[0:20] system and it falls into his heart and
[0:22] there are anchors then Satan makes him
[0:25] prove
[0:26] it and if that ain't there you're gone I
[0:29] remember there in hospital at about 22
[0:31] years old 23 maybe long as young
[0:36] man and my father dying in my arms and
[0:40] me talking to God Is A Healer and my own
[0:44] father in a heart attack lady's head in
[0:46] my arm and me praying for him and see
[0:49] him turn those eyes and look at me and
[0:52] fall off to go to meet

[4:09] don't take her Lord he just pull down
[4:10] the curtain as if they shut up I don't
[4:12] want to hear you at all you wouldn't
[4:15] even talk to
[4:16] me then if he wouldn't talk to me it was
[4:19] Satan's time he said I thought you said
[4:22] he was a good
[4:23] God what's all this you're hollering
[4:25] about you're just a boy look around over
[4:28] the city every girl boy you ever
[4:30] associated with think you've lost your
[4:31] mind you have now he couldn't tell me
[4:34] there was no God because I'd already
[4:35] seen it but he told me he didn't care
[4:37] for me said all night long all day long
[4:40] I said that to god what have I done show
[4:43] me Lord don't let the innocent have to
[4:45] suffer for me if I've done wrong I
[4:47] didn't know he was trying me but every
[4:50] son that comes to God's got to be tried
[4:52] I said tell me what I've done I'll make
[4:54] it right what have I done but preach all
[4:56] day long and all night long and just
[4:59] giving my life constantly what have I
[5:01] done Satan said that's right and see now
[5:04] when it comes to you and you've told all
[5:06] of them that you believe he's a great
[5:08] healer and there lays your baby laying
[5:10] there dying he refused to even you're
[5:12] and your wife died with two bers
[5:14] pneumonia you said he could heal cancers
[5:17] and there he is now you talk about him
[5:19] being good and how good he is to people
[5:22] what about you then I begin to listen to
[5:24] him that's
[5:25] reasoning I thought that's right said he
[5:29] could just you don't have to speak the
[5:30] word just look to your baby to live I
[5:32] said that's right and as much as you've
[5:34] done for him and yet that's what he does
[5:36] for you I said that's right begin to
[5:39] think well what see everything begin to
[5:42] break away when it come to
[5:44] reasonings but when it come to that that
[5:47] home it stayed there I was just about
[5:50] ready to say then I'll quit but when it
[5:53] got down to all the reasoning powers
[5:55] that broke away then it come to that
[5:57] eternal life that new birth what if it
[5:59] hadn't have been
[6:01] there what if it
[6:03] hadn't we wouldn't have know one another
[6:06] way we do now this church would have not
[6:08] been here like this there thousands and
[6:11] millions around the
[6:14] world but thank God it was there then
[6:17] when I thought what who am I anyhow who
[6:21] am I to question his
[6:24] majesty who am I to question the Creator
[6:26] to give me my very life here on Earth
[6:29] where did I get that baby who' give it
[6:31] to
[6:32] me not mine anyhow just loaned her to me
[6:35] for a while I said Satan get away from
[6:38] me I went over laid my hand on the baby
[6:41] I said God bless you sweetheart in a
[6:43] minute Daddy I'll take you down put you
[6:44] on mommy's arms the angels will pack
[6:46] your little soul away and I'll meet you
[6:48] in that morning I said Lord you give her
[6:50] to me you're taking her away though you
[6:52] slay me like job said yet I love you and
[6:55] I believe you if you send me to hell I
[6:57] love you anyhow I can't get away from
[6:59] that there you
[7:01] are just been intellectual it all broke
[7:04] away but you got to have personal
[7:08] relationship you've got to be born
[7:12] again
