TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I was telling someone this afternoon in a little meeting I said every son that's born of God has to be tried first chastened I remember when I had mine my greatest hour when a when a man's born get there's a little spotlike size of his fingernail that God injects into him system and it falls into his heart and there are anchors then Satan makes him prove it and if that ain't there you're gone I remember there in hospital at about 22 years old 23 maybe long as young man and my father dying in my arms and me talking to God Is A Healer and my own father in a heart attack lady's head in my arm and me praying for him and see him turn those eyes and look at me and fall off to go to meet God I took him over and bearded him by the side of my brother and the flowers are still fresh on his grave and me preaching a God that heals a sick working for the Public Service Company for 20 cents an hour and my wife working out shirt factory to help us make a living for a little 18months old boy Billy Paul and an eight-month old child that she was packing I've seen sister Wilson nod her head she remembers that Roy Slaughter and some of the oldtimers what did I do walk the streets with a sandwich in my hand come down off the pole and testifying to everybody come by about the love of Jesus Christ go to the garage and ask them if I could use to talk to mechanics go in there and say man have you ever been saved yet I found something in my heart going to grocery stores at night time come home at 2 or three o'clock in the morning from making sick calls all night long couldn't just sit down change and put on my work clothes and sit there in a chair and rest till daylight get up and go so thin from fast fasting and praying till I had to pray to putu my spurs on to get up a pole preaching and preaching God was great God was mercy God was love to the people and here my daddy dying on my arms and my brother died was killed while I standing the pull pit down here at this little colored Pentecostal Church preaching come told me your brother was killed up on the highway your car HD him and killed him his own brother's blood dripping off his shirt where he picked him up on the highway right after you buried him my daddy died then there laid my wife out there and I went come over here this Tabernacle from off this way platform stands told the people six months before it happened there'll come a flood and I seen an angel take a rod and measure 22 feet over Spring Street Sandy Davis and them sitting here life say it's only about eight or 10 inches in 1884 boy what's talking to you I said it'll be because I seen one of them trances and they told me so it'll be there and there's a mark on Spring tree today at 22 ft of water I said I rot over the top of this tab tacle in a boat and I did during that time my wife got sick I prayed for her and I come to Tabernacle there's people was waiting on me I said she's dying oh it's just your wife I said she's dying I went over there and prayed and prayed and prayed and I hold my hands out and she tuck hold me hand she said Billy I'll meet you in the morning stand over there said get the kides together and meet me at the gate I said it's start holling bill I'll be there and she went out I laid her down there in the Marg went up home to lay down and when I did Little Billy Paul stand Miss BR am so sick the doctor expect me to die at any time me praying for Billy and here come brother Frank got me said your baby's dying the little girl I went out the hospital Dr dare wouldn't let me go in and said she got menitis you take it back to Billy Paul have the nurse give me some kind of red stuff to take for some kind of an anesthetic of something to quieten me I had him to leave the room throw it out the window slipped out the back door went out the basement there laid the baby there before the hospital isolated War flies on her little eyes like that and Tuck the old sko bar shoot him away and puted over I got on I said God there lays my daddy and brother y the flowers on the grave there lays hope and hear my baby dying don't take her Lord he just pull down the curtain as if they shut up I don't want to hear you at all you wouldn't even talk to me then if he wouldn't talk to me it was Satan's time he said I thought you said he was a good God what's all this you're hollering about you're just a boy look around over the city every girl boy you ever associated with think you've lost your mind you have now he couldn't tell me there was no God because I'd already seen it but he told me he didn't care for me said all night long all day long I said that to god what have I done show me Lord don't let the innocent have to suffer for me if I've done wrong I didn't know he was trying me but every son that comes to God's got to be tried I said tell me what I've done I'll make it right what have I done but preach all day long and all night long and just giving my life constantly what have I done Satan said that's right and see now when it comes to you and you've told all of them that you believe he's a great healer and there lays your baby laying there dying he refused to even you're and your wife died with two bers pneumonia you said he could heal cancers and there he is now you talk about him being good and how good he is to people what about you then I begin to listen to him that's reasoning I thought that's right said he could just you don't have to speak the word just look to your baby to live I said that's right and as much as you've done for him and yet that's what he does for you I said that's right begin to think well what see everything begin to break away when it come to reasonings but when it come to that that home it stayed there I was just about ready to say then I'll quit but when it got down to all the reasoning powers that broke away then it come to that eternal life that new birth what if it hadn't have been there what if it hadn't we wouldn't have know one another way we do now this church would have not been here like this there thousands and millions around the world but thank God it was there then when I thought what who am I anyhow who am I to question his majesty who am I to question the Creator to give me my very life here on Earth where did I get that baby who' give it to me not mine anyhow just loaned her to me for a while I said Satan get away from me I went over laid my hand on the baby I said God bless you sweetheart in a minute Daddy I'll take you down put you on mommy's arms the angels will pack your little soul away and I'll meet you in that morning I said Lord you give her to me you're taking her away though you slay me like job said yet I love you and I believe you if you send me to hell I love you anyhow I can't get away from that there you are just been intellectual it all broke away but you got to have personal relationship you've got to be born again
