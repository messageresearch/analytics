TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we find here that God has always had Overcomers he's had Overcomers in every age there's always every time and every age that there's been on the earth God has always had somebody he could put his hands on as a witness in the earth he's never been without a witness though sometimes just one but somebody come now like the Saints of old and uh a very fine man a scholar was saying after the Seven Seals he said uh brother Brandon you being a a typist typologist rather said how in the world are you going to put that church in the Rapture without the tribulation period in a time he said you see if it's a type there's got to be uh there's got if it's an antitype there's got to be a type for that antitype to come from and everything I say that is true has a type it has a type you have a shadow and the Bible said the old things was a shadow of the new things to come he said but now you took the Old Testament as a shadow now he said what are you going to do with this church this man comes from a a great uh man great teacher that's a bosom friend of mine very good man and he's a lovely brother and I I'd be Darr to say one word against the brother I wouldn't anyhow as as a as a Christian I wouldn't say nothing against him he's he he don't agree with me on that one subject but he he's my precious brother we eat together and oh he's just a Dandy fell I take his magazine read his articles and he writes some of mine so forth and I've took a many texts out of what I I've read read of his articles hear him say he's a great man but he he just can't agree with me I appreciate that his sincerity though he don't just one of these pushover just have to grieve everything he say he's got his own convictions and he stands for I appreciate that and he's a good man oh I I'm not a teacher or scholar at all but this man's both teacher and Scholar but I I can't agree with him because I don't see it but it doesn't pertain to Salvation it's pertaining to the coming of the Lord he sees that the church has to go through the tribulation period for purification I say the blood of Jesus Christ purifies the church it needs no I believe that the church goes through the tribulation period Church organization that's right but the bride does not would would you choose the woman you had to purify before you married her Christ's bride is chosen and she is elected and she's God's bride a bride of Jesus Christ and now he said how you going to type that if that bride Goes Forth goes up before she goes through the tribulation period say I got scripture it shows you that the church is in the tribulation period I said just read the six seal that's all she's right there under the tribulation period but find out just before that the bride's done gone amen she's in glory at that time she has no purification see he that believeth on me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation or the Judgment but pass from Death unto life Christ gave the a promise that we would not even stand at the Judgment so freely did he take my place and tell I'm absolutely free when I'm pardoned I'm pardoned amen how can you take me out of the pawn shop got a clear receipt of how can you be my redeemer and take me from the pawn shop and the broker still say I belong to him now I got a written receip amen wrot by the blood of Jesus Christ see now now in that here's where we come he said now how are you going to get separate that elected bride you talk about now how you going to put that under a type I said very good I say here it is now in Matthew the 27th chapter and the 51st verse if we let me just read it and then we we got it good then we find find out whether it was typed or not where was the elected bride Matthew the 27th chapter and the and the 50 first verse all right we read this at the crucifixion of our law and behold the veil of the temple was written Twain From the top to the bottom now that was the law the law ended right there because the Veil kept the congregation from the holy articles of God only an anointed priest went in there and that once the year remember now God with his own hand notice from the top to the bottom not from the bottom to the top there some 40 ft High notice not from the bottom to the top but from the top to the bottom showed it was done by God rent The Veil and to then though anyone who whosoever will may come and partake of his Holiness all right from top to the bottom and the earthy quake and the Rocks rent and the graves were open and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection went into the holy city and appeared to manyen there's that elected that bride not all all of the Jewish Church come forth at that time all of them made the same sacrifice all of them has under the shed blood of the lamb but there was an elected group and that elected group as soon as the event come that really believed in it was sincere sincerity now I'm coming to the word overcome now hold that these that had really overcome sincerely making the same offering that the rest of them made but but in sincerity overcome the things of the worldall when the propitiation correctly was made for them they were in Paradise until that PL that time when that time was made they had overcome and was resting sleeping see many bodies of those that slept in the death slept now if we had time we could go on back to Daniel when Daniel that elected one let it overcome and he said close up the book Daniel for thou shall rest in thy L but when the prince shall come which will stand for the people thou shallal stand in the heart here it is Daniel this prophet of God saw the end time coming and he said Daniel you'll stand in your life if that day here he was come forth not all of Israel but the bride type of Israel now the rest of Israel don't come forth until the general resurrection and now at the coming of the Lord Jesus those who are really loving his coming that's living for it when he appears in the sky amen the church and dead and Christ or rise and those be changed in a moment the rest them will know nothing about it remember a to those in the city see the the the Rapture will be like that we'll see each other and we'll see them the rest of the world won't see them and it'll be caught away as a secret going waiting for that time then returning back to to the Earth that glorious Millennium then the Thousand Years the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years and then come forth the general Resurrection where all Israel and also look at there the 12 apostles the 12 Patriarchs all represented we ain't never got to that yet maybe the Lord willing we'll get to it in The Testament how that those walls of Jasper and 12 Stones 12 gates 12 foundations all that's represented here they are on 12 Thrones The Angel messengers of those days to pass judgment upon those who rejected their message Hallelujah heyen there comes forth that great hour yeah what a day what a time that we're living how that we should check up church and we talk about these things coming that's going to come now today let's drop back here and see check ourselves and see if we're right in the faith
