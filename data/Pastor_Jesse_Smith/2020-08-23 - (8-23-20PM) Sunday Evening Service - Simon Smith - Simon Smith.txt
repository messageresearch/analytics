ten [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] breakfast praise the lord saints wow quite a few showed up back praise the lord amen just karen good seeing you little one younger one don't say like that growing up we are back to the teaching mode again here by god's grace hopefully everybody's okay with that i know we're hope i didn't wear anyone out this morning sometimes i get you know we have the little uh the joke there at our home church where living waters tabernacle actually stands for lwt which is long waters tabernacles so we sometimes really can't his averages hour and a half i mean every service hour and a half and some sometimes you know the flash is weary so anyhow i don't want to hold you long i'm probably not going to sing a song special today uh just because we got really good voices here soldiers for uh amen by the malachi but justin i'm sure there's many others that can do a song special here as well and um and hopefully this morning was edifying we wanted to see it last thing i want the whole point you know and i'll say it in whatever the little tiny gift lord give me is to be edified and to to raise your faith on the word of god amen but this thing's supernatural this bible uh is controlled it's it's an open book but it's controlled on how much opens at a certain time and what can open what can be taught and it's all timing everything's timing and waiting on god and thinking and searching and just looking at things on your heart you know so and and god will open it in his due season and the things we're going to need at the end is is just hanging right there i think it's in the hangars waiting for the bride waiting for the season waiting for the exact time for things to be broken and revealed to us because we're going to need these last little bit for the revelation uh for revelation of for rapturing faith so we want we want to be always open to those things and man it works always first time here at this at this uh powerpoint schedule maybe sister acacia is doing a wonderful job there so let's go to revelations 3 verse 14. i got a little bit of reading here and this is uh maybe maybe maybe nothing uh new tonight but i want to rehash some things because this is going to be important i believe maybe refreshing uh going over some things and if i had maybe if i spent a little more time i could actually really dial in a major study on this and show historically documentary documents and those sort of things how solid what we believe is okay we have a real what god's brought us to is we're very uh very powerful and i've noticed things as you as you deal with other christians other people other faiths i'll say like that um then when it comes to revelation you really can't do anything for them because revelation comes by the spirit all you can do is just is is tell them the truth try to explain it the best ability show them the scriptures and then then it's up to god open his eyes so anyhow revelations 3 verse 14 revelations 3 and 14 not of the leo scene church age and i want to and we got a little bit of reading directly after these two sets of scriptures we're going to read because i want to show you how important this is and just what the prophet of god brought in for this you know and for the revelation of jesus christ so this is out of the book of revelation the revelation of jesus christ and verse verse 14 and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and the true the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of god and if we could could we turn to first timothy 3 and i want to teach on a certain subject and i'm really going to start trying myself to to dive back into this because and i'm going to be sending some things just some basic things but there my pastor started preaching on an angle of this and i've never understood the importance and we know it's important but it's very very important and uh you'll see some scriptures on how important this is in uh first timothy 3 uh verse 14 he says these things right i unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly and saint paul wants to visit these these saints here he says but if i carry long that thou mayest know how to let behave out is to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and the ground of the truth and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit scene of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory okay so let's say a word of prayer [Music] dearly father lord jesus lord we love you lord and lord thank you lord and bless all the warriors lord saints that push the way out once again lord for us a second service on sunday lord and lord especially to listen to a different maybe a little awkward kind of a teacher maybe not the most revelation not the most dynamic lord of speech or even articulate or maybe using voice inflection or however you want to say it lord you you build me this way lord this is how i am you know i just pray lord that you would just be able you would i would able to get beside myself lord and just let you speak on and be a blessing to your children once again to your bride to your wife lord i'm not speaking to just a woman here out in the world lord lord this is the elected eternal bride of christ uh standing here before me lord these are the ones you have chosen to be ordained in this hour on this day in this age lord to manifest your lord and lord they come to hear you speak oh we ask that you would speak god in the name of jesus christ amen you may have your seats and that's probably made the way that every minister should view the congregation not as something to where i want to or you would maybe a minister want to elevate themselves as far as be more revelated or understanding or whatever but to really reverence his wife you are the bride of christ and for some reason it falls a lot here to me to speak to the church especially and to the wife of the living god so what we have here is we're obviously dealing with uh the mystery uh of godliness and if i had a topic would be the capstone revelation all right uh there's many things uh angles you could teach on but i want to show you uh you know brother cam has been dealt with a certain scripture and just blew my mind and i want to touch on it today because it was just such a blessing and shows what has taken place in this day i mean you think how how even science has been parallel with the gospel you know uh einstein i believe was oh 1904 or five or six like that has released the document on light and how powerful it is and how you can harness light and how light works and all those things and just years after that how how god would bring forth the godhead you know before bring forth the pillar of fire the revelation of that now it almost goes everything's parallel it's just a race between the carnal and the true between uh the flesh and the supernatural and so we want to get into this just a little bit and this may be rehashed but i want to be i want to just hopefully show you and i do have some pictures in here to help keep you awake and keep you keep your eyes just pretend it's like well this is like a tv screen okay so you have teaching and tv you can't beat it i mean it's just tough to match that in this hour i mean so and and the deodorant has been working it's definitely strong enough for man okay so i've not been sweating uh at all in these areas and regions so very i'm thankful my god's great so um i don't know if you know sister i karen i i forgot to put the odor on this morning and i realized that midway through turnpike drive and i was like that's like well we can stop and hit so i picked up some that all that i had we're selling was secret that's a woman's deodorant and i i know the saying so anyhow it is yeah so it's okay i smell good like the bride i smell like the bride of christ so i want to go back to this uh and maybe touch here um and this was brought back to my attention uh with the church ages we've been going through church ages here at the men's we do men's church age meetings every saturday night we go through as brothers sit there and and and the last maybe the couple times back we we finally got to the portion where uh you know he brought the prophet brought forth the letter to the bride and i called my pastor said hey brother what about if we read this one one sentence or one paragraph at a time then just sit all the brothers sit back and just wait for things to drop and if they're if god would drop anything at that time so we would read a paragraph sit there some brothers would reflect and this and this and me i really was really longing for this part as far as the the letter to the bride and to me it was a blessing there's things in there we don't understand there's things on there we can't interpret yet there's things in there we're waiting to make we're waiting for god to be manifest and but we see the the timeline he's using or the the the pattern he's using you know he's going back to moses he's going back to elijah he's going back to christ the the the three showdowns and and those sort of things and that's and that was to me a blessing you know but as we went into more of the church ages we got to you know a certain thing here and and i want to hit this here and this is a little we're going to go we're going to read a little bit here okay hope so but stay with me let's i know i i know i maybe i should just move my arms more or my legs just to keep motion keep motion and anyhow so you're revelations 3 and 14. notice the prophet of god now brother branham it was it was kind of leasing and trusting brotherly veil to to help write these things and they work together and he from what i've heard he proofread it three times or seven times i'm sorry uh um so we're just kind of we're just throwing this in here um uh because it's in the church age book he says uh my isn't that the most wonderful description of the attributes of our lovely lord jesus our lovely lord and savior jesus christ these words just make me want to shout he's dealing with revelations three here he's dealing with uh these things say the amen the faithful the true witness the beginning of the creation of god right he says they bring such a spirit of reality into my heart just reading him without even waiting for a thorough revelation of the spirit upon them thrills me so even just keep reading the words that did something to him okay and now he says jesus is giving us this description of himself in relation to the last age now this is laodicea he brings this out i am uh those things the amen the faithful the true witness and the days of grace are winding up he has looked from the first century right through to the 20th told us all the things concerning these ages before he reveals the characteristics of the last age to us he gives us one final look at his own glorious and supreme deity and if we could think of that in now we're dealing with god god almighty the creator the one who is eternal has all power all knowledge yes and he brings these things out i just love the way he placed that because of his own gracious supreme deity to be in that presence this is the capstone revelation of himself so he's pushing something supreme here and this is something important he calls it the capstone revelation of himself uh thus saith the amen jesus is the amen of god okay jesus is the so let it be of god amen stands for not for finality it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promise it stands for unchanging promise amen so if god says it it's going to happen if god reiterates it if he pulls it from the old and places new you can bank on it you can guarantee it because he has uttered it twice how much in the new testament is actually pulled from the old that shows it's just as pure and as he's going to be just as faithful as pervert uh uh preserving his word as he's ever been amen amen every word is yay and amen in christ sure it stands for the unchanging promise it stands for the seal of god in other words when he says it it's done nothing can break that seal when he speaks the word that word is now sealed into it moves from eternity and then when he speaks the word it moves into time that's right but it's a sealed word because him and the word are one amen god and the word are one absolute i want you to watch this carefully i would see something really sweet and beautiful i said this is his end time revelation of himself when the day of grace closes then the millennium comes very shortly thereafter doesn't it amen he says well let me read with you and he reads isaiah 56 i'm 65 i'm sorry 16-19 that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the god of truth okay this is isaiah 16. uh i'm sorry 65 verse 16 right so he pulls this and he says he says and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten because they are hid from mine eyes right now he pulls this he says let's read this together he reads all three of these or sorry four of these scriptures but he's focusing on the god of truth the god of truth right he says this is about jerusalem this is the millennium but as we go into the millennium we hear what he says about a certain kind of god verse 16. he that he who blesses himself in the earth shall be blessed of himself in the god of truth yes that is true but the real translation is not god of truth it is the god of the amen so why would the prophet allow uh brotherly veil and they and the the quran collaborated on this to put this in here he says it is the god of amen so we read it uh so we read it shall bless himself in the god of amen and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of the amen because the former troubles are forgotten because they are hid from my eyes behold i create a new heavens and the earth and the former shall not remember nor come into mind right so what is it he's saying he's what he's trying to say is that revelations where he says where christ himself god the son is revealing that he is the amen he's pulling all the way back here in isaiah and saying look he says this is the god of truth or the god of amen as well they're one and the same right now what now the beautiful thing is what he puts here he says the new testament does not reveal another god i was in denomination i know they teach you different and from what i've heard from uh a brother two weeks ago he said there there's a doctrine of two two gods now coming out in the message father and son and the holy ghost is god himself so the same god father and son so those are already dealing with false doctrines again coming making coming alive and this and that the new testament does not reveal another god it is the further revelation of the one and the same god christ did not come down to make himself known why why why is that why didn't he want to reveal himself he did not come to reveal the son he came to reveal and to make known the father and now in this last age we come back we have come back to the capstone revelation he says the most important revelation of godhead in the whole bible that is jesus is god the most important thing if there's outside i'll say this i was like the the token is the is the culmination of the message we must be born again receive the baptist be converted receive his life in us and now we're just as eternal as he is amen right because he is now in us we have become a new creation a new creature right amen but as far as revelation he says the godhead is the most important thing to know the most important revelation of godhead in the whole bible that is jesus is god he and the father are one this is one god and his name is the lord jesus christ and we know we see the power like we said earlier this morning the power of the bee are moving so the now the bible talks about the wiles of the devil and that word wiles means the tricks so there's coming now remember jesus always he said in matthew 16 he says beware of the leaven of the pharisees and scribes and pharisees right so that if he's warning back then about false doctrine and we know this 11 if there's a false doctrine coming there must be uh back then there must be another now remember the revelation has already come who jesus christ was but there must be something so close to who he is coming it'll be a worldwide revelation as they would say jesus is god and he the father of one there is one god in his name is the lord jesus christ okay now and if it's a revelation i guess we maybe think about how powerful a revelation is and i don't know how brother jesse teaches it here but the prophet said he says faith and revelation are like twins right or really close side to my side and i always talk like this and but jesse may have a different way and you can come and correct me if you want or whatever but i always talk like this is that i i teach the the now he never said they were one in some spots he says they're one of the same the son of their twins and however but i teach that a revelation actually comes a split second first and then faith because a revelation is a i know or thus say the lord or i just know it a revelation comes boom uh um i'm going to make the rapture let's say i have a revelation i'm going to make the rapture boom i know it now it's been revealed i saw a vision of me and the white horse is following christ back and this that means i'm right that means i'm making rapture boom that's it now i can have total faith towards it but it takes an opening first once because right here if i cannot see it spiritually it's hope right right but once i see it once god opens it up to me and reveals something to me now i can have all faith towards it amen amen amen that's how i teach it the revelation is just a split second before faith kicks in i i'm trying to think of as a certain thing uh um i'll say it like this when i was in denomination i've told the story right here before when i was in the nomination i was under a certain teacher i was just right i was a year in the year and i was at i was at their team i was at this the bible study okay and they're doing a bible study on trinity and i'm sitting there and my wife's heard this about three thousand times mom my wife i'm sitting there and the man's teaching his name is so-and-so and uh he's teaching and he gets done with the whole study and he's dealing with father someone goes faster goes dealing with three persons and he says yeah now the father is this and he's got he knows all things the son does not know everything because he was limited in this man then the holy ghost is we're not sure he's like he's like a substance of what god was and breaking it all down however and then at the whole column at the whole end of the whole study he's like he kind of singles me out he's like first time he goes or just called me simon he said simon he said when you get to heaven do you ever think it's going to be like this and he said he said there'll be the father on the throne you know white and white beard and just old looking and and he will be the father and then over here on the by the crystal sea jesus would be sitting on the on a dock with his feet just dripping in the crystal sea and and he'll just be sitting there and then he said and then he said he's now the holy ghost he'll become flying and he'll be just flying around just doing whatever it was and he goes did you ever think of it when we look at the heaven that it's going to look like that and me you're saved and this is honest you know the lord knows it's true i said well i i said brother i i just thought it was jesus on the throne [Laughter] amen and that i don't know i didn't understand the importance of why he would visualize and try to imagine this and me i'm just like i i i just thought it was jesus on the throne because it's revelation he's teaching me something and i still can't see it and i'm like i just thought it was and he kind of looked at me and i looked at him like i'm sure he was like wow he's a oneness anointings on him or whatever but that's a basic revelation well not race that's a great revelation now but notice here in revelation of romans romans 1 and 15 so revelation is everything to us yes the prophet said to what pray for revelation more than anything else and this and tonight i'm sure i'm sure most of you know what i'm going to be as far as i'll be heading this way on godhead but this might be a refresher if if if you don't understand these things come talk to me come talk about jesse and i'm sure most you have the revelation but i want to teach it the way god shows it to me okay amen and it's just be like a rehash here he says now so so as much as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also and and the reason i'm hitting this tonight is because there was a brother brother a wonderful wonderful brother brother john skaggs and i'm gonna tell you you mind if i tell you a little testimony the reason i'm i'm hitting on this is because there's something coming according to his this is a secondhand testimony but i want you to be ready i want you to be alert and beware i want you to be asking god for more revelation of this now here's his story is that he was at his house one day and he said the holy spirit said drive to such town he gets in the car and he drives this and this he gets to town he said all right lord it said the lord said go two more blocks move he goes two more blocks take a left take his left and he says take it right here go down the street and he said go in there and there was a trailer there a house trailer and he said lord you only go in there he goes yes just go in there and he said he went in there he opened the door went in knocked and whatever and they were having a church service and at the church service the man was preaching he says there's coming a new trinity doctrine there's coming a new doctrine there's something coming something new being taught and he wondered why god had brought him there and now here he's the lord is revealing to him there's there's something coming remember if this is the age of the greatest deception if this is the age where the devil is going to be uh so close to being anointed that he is almost at flesh we're gonna see we won't see the antichrist in flesh but we are going to see we're right at the time of when he and when satan is kicked out of heaven and he takes over we're right at that time the age of deception this is the greatest the darkest hour this is where anything i mean look at look at america so confused everyone's confused no clue what's going on well some say this someday that there's conspiracy there sometimes i mean we have no idea what's really all we know we're the coming of the lord jesus christ so we must now get this out of our ears get this out of yours and what the bible says keep your right eye single and the whole body will be light so we must focus what on light the whole body is going to be light and we have to be looking at the light amen so and we know the light is the logos the holy ghost god almighty right amen but now revelation is so important here now look at this this is this might seem simple but look look at what it really is so as much as he is and me i'm ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation right to everyone that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek for therein is the righteousness of god revealed so basic salvation is a revelation amen amen sometimes i think us in the message we're so we're so deep and that's okay there's nothing wrong with being deeply or so uh want to know this great mystery this great mystery and those things are wonderful or isn't that but we forget how basic and how powerful salvation itself is just wanting to be saved is a revelation just saying hey jesus christ is god and i want to i'm a sinner just acknowledging your own sin repenting be baptized is a revelation for there it is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith and if you look up where that scripture is the just shall live by faith he's dealing with pastors that are traveling all over and will not stay at home nicolette and where'd that come out of the nicolaitan age which is where luther come out and says we don't have to talk to a priest we don't have to talk about this the pope or this night he's the what we have to talk to one meter mean one meter only and that's the lord jesus christ amen sure yeah so now dealing with this godhead issue dealing with these things uh we're 22 minutes in so let's continue on here we're gonna we're gonna go this is in in in matthew 11 verse 25 and at that time jesus answered and said i thank the o father lord of heaven and earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto obey revealed them right even so father for seem good in thy sight all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth he any man north knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whom the son will reveal him yes so the only way you're gonna know who god is is through the revelation of jesus christ amen amen and i i really believe one of the last couple of revelations because i was talking to a certain man at the job site a catholic man and he's talking about judas and this and this and i said have you ever noticed that after john 13 when judas leaves the scene is when jesus christ reveals who he is he says i am the father he's i am the holy ghost i will come to you and what jesus is revealing he's all of that all that right and even step back going gave me a look and thought about it he was chewing on it and i just left it right there search out the scriptures for and you find them eternal life jesus said that that's what john 5 39 539 now to know him is life the person christ himself not compare he's it's a revelation that god built his church upon and if we don't build upon that same church the bible said abel by faith and faith is a divine revelation see faith is a divine revelation all right the whole thing is just built upon revelation and unless that this is revealed to you jesus said i thank the father that thou has hid these from the wise and from the wise of this world and revealed to babe such as we learned see now the whole thing is built there you've got to know the person amen not even i was like this even the study is nothing you have to know the living person in my prayer when i go to praying and i have a certain need i say i say lord make it so plain i can't miss it and that's how he makes it because he knows i am not the sharpest pipe cutting tool okay i say lord make it so plain lord i cannot miss it and that is a special person to me to him request yes because i want to know if he says something if he does something i know it's him and i can bank on it absolutely sure he says you've got to know the person amen now who is the son let me jump to a scripture here i'm gonna read this here let me jump to it look at this here look at this in matthew 16 verse 13. when jesus came into the century of philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do ye who do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say thou john the baptist some elias some jeremiah one of the prophets and he said to them whom say ye that i am right and he said thou art the christ the son thou art the christ the anointed one the messiah that word christ is another word for messiah in the greek okay yes thou art the messiah the son of the living god right notice he said son of the living god so what is the son who is the image of the invisible god who is jesus christ in the flesh he is the image of the invisible god and when i teach this uh to to do bible studies or whatever what i do is i i probably should have drew it out for you but i i take on a white board or whatever i take my little uh eraser marker and i go like this and i and i and i form a big g okay and that stands for god and i'll do a big g with dots because he's the invisible god i do big d boom boom boom boom boom boom and then i say that's before genesis 1 1 and then i put like a little speaking words or like little lines saying like that that invisible god is speaking and then i'll draw the pillar of fire in yellow or red okay yeah and i watched how people get to illuminate when they see it visually so i take then i take that big g the invisible god and then i put it inside the pillar of fire so now there's a pillar of fire or something visible something light a light a amber burning fire and now it has the big g with dots the invisible god in it and i say there you go now that's as simple as it gets and the one time i told the man said don't touch it don't erase that just leave it right there and for the next three weeks i come back and that same was that thing was just sitting right there on his white board and he just stared at it and he said now i understand amen but let me give you let me give you another testimony this and this is how it works i taught two brothers not related two brothers for three months on baptism it took almost two months to get through baptism because they could not see it oh brother so plain not in this age it is tough it is a baptism is a revelation of god but then when i started dealing with bat or godhead i drew that big g with the dots the invisible god and the pillar fire and i placed that big g in there right and all of a sudden they're like i believe in oneness we're oneness but guess what happened they went back to the denominational pastor and they did an interview with him multi-millionaire big shooter i mean you should see his house in mall me toledo news pluto area big you see his church it's a campus and they did an interview and the two of them sit right here and said oh pastor so-so now can you bring down trinity in between baptism or oneness and trinity and he's like he starts rattling off right and i met him in a parking lot as we always meet when i was in that time of my life we always met in the parking lot and me and him this brother here were sitting in a car and he said simon and this is after he's like whoa i see it i see it he's like simon i just had a talk with my pastor and i think i'm just going to hold off on what you're saying but i'm just going to stay with trinity for right now until i understand more things and yet i drew it i showed him and he was going when he when i drew he's like he saw it he saw the revelation but satan was able to come and take this out now let me show you the difference between teaching and the spirit revelation as a as he's he's telling me simon i just had a meeting with the pastor i'm going to give you i said did you record it he said yeah i recorded it look can you play it on your phone and he gave me his iphone and he started playing it because they recorded it and i'm listening to this pastor break this down i said i'm just gonna say heir his name is eric i said eric that's a lie that's a lie that's a lie and that's a lie and i was just and i was like lord what am i doing here i've been sewing and sewing and sewing i'm tired i'm ready to quit and as soon as i thought that in my heart that this guy is go i just taught him so simply godhead one person ran scriptures for months showed him and he's going to listen to this guy who's all it was reasoning and i hit off and i gave him back the phone i said well that's fine you can do whatever you want and you know what he said he said simon he goes i did have a dream last night oh you did and now i'm like well here's i said i mean everything's ordained you know i just said tell me your dream guess what his dream was about he said simon in my dream he was i was in a car and i was in a parking lot and i said oh this is for me because we were in a car in a parking lot right there i said okay tell me more he goes we were i was in a car in a parking lot he said i got in the car and across the parking lot was jesus he said and his body was normal he said but his head was all disfigured it was all deformed his teeth were shooting out this way and his eyes were all messed up his face was deformed the snack he said it was jesus but he didn't look right and he said i started walking towards jesus and as he approached christ christ then drew himself near to him and he said all of a sudden before he knew it he was like right here and he says jesus was right here he says and he has the world would say he was he was boss he was the main man he said and guess what cyan what he goes and his face was back to normal i said i know the interpretation he goes what i said i'll tell you what exactly what that means because what's that i said if you would just draw closer to jesus christ the godhead would be made plain i said what was deformed he said the god the head of god i said the godhead would be plain if you just draw close to christ and and and i and i was i wasn't even looking anyone said that i said if you would just draw close to him and he swore he was a cuss word i said watch your mouth i was i'm a little bit older quite a bit i said watch your mouth boy i turned and he's like this the holy ghost came down and took over his body for five minutes and in the midst of it he's going like this he couldn't move all he could move was his eyes and his hands start going and he was looking at me scared to death and i just thinking lord get him get him get him get him and as the anointing leaves and he started to decide what was it i said you would not listen to god's servant i've taught and i've taught and i've taught and i've shown you but now god had to come down and discern and break down your dream and vindicate it to you that there is only one person in the godhead and he quit going to that church at that time and i haven't seen him much since then but he said there's one god i said absolutely but that's the difference between a teaching and the holy ghost coming down and making it manifest vindicating a dream yes the interpretation was right he is the individual invis the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature right what was it in the beginning he was a light he was a light body but then in the first coming he was now flesh amen the logos the word of god was made flesh and then all of god came and dwelt within him correct now let's move here and then ii corinthians 4 verse 3 but if our gospel be hidden it is hidden in them that are lost and whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glory's gospel christ who is the image of god should shine unto them notice it calls him the image of god jesus christ let this by mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god amen if god had to choose the light body it was the logos if god had to choose a flesh body it was jesus christ that was his own personal body right who thought it not to be robbery to be equal with god but made himself no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant or more faith he changed himself right put on another mask as the prophet of god would express now here god who is sunday try some dry times in a diverse manner spake and time passed unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken to us by his son who made appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory the expressed image of his person singular amen it does not say in the express person of his person it says an image an image is something you can see amen something something that can be made manifest but not a separate person but just an image amen sure and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down the right hand of the majesty on high amen now let's continue here this is a powerful scripture but i can't find this years and years and years ago one of the first scriptures you found when you come in the message proving the godhead is there does the bible declare three persons plural is there ever an s on the after person or person no no sir but notice here job who knew god who was perfect before god that god knew job and god job knew god all that they would gather all together would altogether hold your peace and it should be your wisdom this is job speaking here now my reasoning hearken to the pleading of my lips will ye speak wickedly for god and talk deceitfully for him will you accept his person job is a prophet here is god almighty right he says will you accept this person will you contend for god it is good that you should uh us it is good that he should search you out or as one man mock another so uh do you so knock him he will surely reprove you if you do secretly accept persons that could be other people or it could mean a prophecy of a trinity hmm because i'll say like this i went to many people who go to trinitarian churches and i break down what they believe and they said well i don't believe that listen you're not a trinitarian and they look at me and then you can see they're counting the cost yeah i said hey i'll do bible studies i'll show you from genesis revelations this is one person and they're just stairs you're like counting man i'm gonna what about what's my girlfriend say or what's my boyfriend gonna say what's uh my mom and dad uh they're not saying it but you can see what they're thinking i just witnessed baptism about four maybe six months ago to a group of brothers and they're not in the message and the one guy as i'm breaking down baptism alone he is like oh he's like he's like simon they're gonna kill you for this do you know what you're doing you know what you're teaching they're not gonna accept this and i'm thinking wow he knows exactly he's counting the cost he he said he said they're going to kill me for this bad just bat not godhead just baptism my wife was there he was blowing up on me he's like shot dude man we got this is kind of dangerous dude i said do you see it he's like man it's right there it's like what you were scared for were you gonna make a move are you ready to baptize well man that's and he made me talk to his mom he won't even deal with me he said you talk to my mom and i said i miss or mrs and say why what you talking about my boys and this and this i well would you like a bible study they always back off because i i i always make myself available god knows i would be there yeah i think i've missed one bible say my entire life and god forgive me it was not alignment i just i had a dentist appointment i shouldn't i should just cancel that appointment and just went there and just but i don't know what happened that person said god forgive me am i so now so what is so important with this here in matthew 16 verse 13 and these things now notice jesus said who do you say that i the son of man am some say baptist john baptist or jeremiah prophet and he said to him but who say ye that i am right why is it so important he says and simon peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god this is a powerful this is dealing with godhead this is one of the capstone revelations okay amen he says and i say to thee thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it right he gives the keys to the kingdom whatever's who bind will buy and they'll loose loose then he charged uh that they would tell no man that he was jesus the christ right yes now what is this not say my church now my church has nothing to do with it's an individual one person all hells against this teaching amen what are you saying someone that has that jesus christ is the son of the living god this is a individual revelation this is an individual thought these are individual scriptures that we need to pull from this is this is a it's not to everybody this is to only the bride this is only to the elect jesus said now peter you and john and all the rest of people you've got the revelation now the whole church is saved no see that's what makes you so precious we've all came out of other things to know these things and now realistically we could say we have the revelation of jesus christ sure it was to him personally i say unto thee thee not to them to thee thou art peter upon this rock i'll build my church and the word peter means stone stone means confessed one or separated one so the true revelation of jesus christ is will come to people who will separate themselves to truth the spirit of truth amen amen now let's continue on here upon a certain stone upon a certain thing a called out church upon this stone upon this revelation flesh and blood never revealed it unto you but upon this revelation this called out group i'll build my church in them and all the gates of hell will never be able to withstand it so what is he saying that all all that is all the backing of hell will be against this revelation right he doesn't say that again about any other revelation in the scripture that hell is against who jesus christ is because by foreknowledge he wrote the bible a certain way and made it look like it could be trinity but then he wrote it and revealed that it was one person in the godhead god allowed those words to be written a certain way to deceive some and and reveal to others yes that's only to the left but the revelation come through the blood see through jesus christ who is the blood of god created blood in the womb of mary and paul knew him by revelations that's how we know him today is only the only way we could know him is by what the revelation of jesus christ now science pretty simple absolutely now when jesus said who do i who do you would you say that i am peter said thou art the christ son of god now notice here the the the same thing is coming here he's at the judgment seat here jesus christ in front of the scribes and pharisees actually in front of the high priest and notice they do not recognize who he is they don't even know who he is they want to know who he is how did peter know who he is and these did not see this is almost undescribable this is you can almost not even explain this because it's so supernatural it is a spiritual thing that's it that's the only thing we say is it's by the holy ghost is by god himself look at verse 62 and then and the high priest arose and said to him answers thou nothing what is it is it which these witnesses against thee but jesus held his peace and notice and the high priest answered and said to him i journey by the living god now he went the right approach because he knew the high priest knew there was only one living god so he says i jury by the living god the thou tell us whether thou be the christ the son of god but notice in this section this portion this gospel in matthew he's jesus said to him thou hast said nevertheless i say unto you hereafter he shall see the son of man coming on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds and then the pride priest ran as close as he has spoken blasphemy but what did he really say and i like how it says here in mark in verse chapter 14 and he held his peace and said nothing again the high priest asked him and said art thou the christ the son of the blessed and jesus said i am yes he revealed to them they had to pull the revelation out of god god revealed to him and they still did not receive it that's just like cain but paul but god actually had the jesus had to pull the revelation out of peter and peter gave them the answer amen jesus revealed to him that he is he says now now they could be right but to me both of them's wrong as a bond it was upon the spiritual revelation of who he was flesh and blood has not revealed this peter unto you peter but my father which is in heaven hath revealed it and upon this rock the revelation of who he is upon the revelation he is the word the whole upon this rock i'll build my church the gates of hell it showed the gates of hell would be against it right yes i was talking to a gentleman that long ago a christian scholar and a gentleman and he said brother branham we refuse all revelations god have mercy we want to be open to all revelations that come from the spirit of god everything we have right now has come as all over comic con comic con what because we're waiting for more amen lord all that we need give it to us amen and it'll come to you forgot the holy ghost i said then you have to refuse jesus christ for he is the revelation of god god revealed in human flesh unless you see it you're lost unless you see it you're lost see how dangerous that trinity is because everyone i meet on the job site that's christian oh jesus christ is the son of god he's the son of god a catholic just told me that but if you do not have the revelation of what you're saying they'll be lost sure now let me show you how powerful this is then martha as soon as he heard that jesus was coming went met him but mary was sat still in the house then said martha jesus lord if thou had been here my brother would not notice the faith of her if you have been here lord he was sick for so long but you would have healed him amen and jesus just like just trying to contain himself oh this girl got faith lord of god yeah that's what i'm talking about that's why i came in this hour i'd find martha yeah sure i mean man his best buddy just died when his buddies just died one of the one of his disciples one of us the one that he just like johnny loved him he came saw faith right there and notice she says but i now but now i know but now but i know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of god god will give it thee look at the faith behind this and jesus said unto her my brother shall rise so so she already had faith that even right now whatever you know she was not expecting what was gonna happen but maybe something else he would say and mark said to him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and he said to her i am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth to me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this and she said yea lord i believe thou art the christ the son of the living god she had the same revelation the same revelation was revealed to her from the father as he's as he's talking to the father through the body through jesus christ the flesh and it came to her and she spoke it she forward frightened she forfeited all that she had all rights to her to recognize the word of god manifested right before he said i am the resurrection the life he that believeth me though we're dead shall he yet shall he live whosoever believe me in me shall never die believe us all this and there was one little more clause that she hadn't come in line with see he just wanted to hear her say thou art the christ in other words the revelation of who your god in flesh yeah lord i believe thou art the christ the son of living god oh brother everything was ready to spark off right then see you already had faith trying faith but now you have faith but who am i who am i thou art the christ the son of living god that word all of god trapped into what his chosen vessel is chosen body amen chosen what i'm hiding right here in the lamb of god amen sure lord now notice here in first john 4 1 believe it beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether it be of god whether it be because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby you know the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that christ is coming the flesh is of god oh yeah how many ministers in this message that taught oneness understood godhead could teach at the back of hand had anointed services and now they're going on the world i know one particularly master teacher master preacher back to trinity and yet for years he preached that god is one one person and the logos came down and god dwelled in the logos the pillar of fire and how they were one and this and this and this and whatever however and he's back to trinity right now did he really have a revelation no he never really had a revelation he had carnal knowledge intellectual conception believe in eternal hell believe in who knows what how many ministers have have said they've taught this well he's got the spirit of god just let's just wait and try the spirits yes amen the bible says mark the end of a man yes you know thou believers that there is one god that will do as well the devils believe also and tremble the scripture says amen now so where do they get most of their trinitarian doctrines from right here then come with jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized him now remember i got some pictures coming here but john verbatim saying i need to be baptized of thee and cometh down to me and jesus answering some suffering not to be so for for thus it uh becometh us to fulfill all righteous then he suffered him and jesus when he was baptized went straightway out of the water so here's the sun the body going down getting baptized so we see the image right here what they would call the man who we know is the man and though the heavens were open to him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and now that they've seen three they're two he says and a lightning upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased and that's how that's the majority of what they get in revelation is three look we see three right here okay that's when i brought the science then discover magazine june 2005 issue about 80 years ago scientists proved that it is possible to be in two locations or more at the same time at least for the atomic or subatomic particles says the electron for such tiny objects the world is governed by a madhouse of physical laws known as quantum mechanics and if quantum particles quantum material can travel and be in one location and more than one more than one location at one time how much is more can the god almighty and jesus christ can dwell in me and you and you and you and you do you all at the same time and yet he's one person what do you do with the big day of pentecost he divided himself the father says put over here a little bit there there all around he's what the same god jesus christ is one person and he can dwell up more than one he can't be everywhere but he can be at more than one place at one time hey man sure i witness to a guy like this right in the funeral he called me he wanted a debate right in a funeral home he come up to me like this a little bit told me he put his face just like this and i waited for him to say something and i unleash every patriot missile i had and he walked away i was like thank you let's get into it augustine on the trinity if you deny the trinity you will lose your soul if you try and explain it you'll lose your mind that's exactly right i believe that second part first part i don't believe but you can take that last one to your back that's right now brother jesse and for those who've went to the uh libraries and such things we have all the we have histories that say this exact same thing many honest trinitarians will admit uh uh however the what uh note that uh the encyclopedia can't britannica states neither the word trinity nor the explicit doctrine appears in new testament the doctrine developed gradually over several centuries and through many controversies and we're going to show those to you amen amen and i like this in acts 17 21 this is amazing how this and paul stood in the midst and we're getting to some stuff here okay i hope this is going to be blessing this is this to me this was a revelation when i taught this to my little brother he was like absolutely so i want to be i want to show you what's hidden behind the words okay the real meanings then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said he men of athens i perceive that and then all things you are too suspicious for i passed by and beheld your devotions and i found an altar which is scripted to the unknown god you know who that was really too that was to jesus christ but they did not know him they was not revealed to them so god sent one of his messengers and started revealing who it was amen he says whom therefore you ignorantly worship him declare i unto you god that made the world and the things therein seeing that he is the lord of heaven and earth dwelt not in temples made with hands now the prophet of god paul had to discern that this altar to the unknown god was to his god amen by the holy ghost it was revealed to him that what this they're worshiping him but they don't know who he is they're worshiping other gods but they have one specific set aside for him and not only is he an unknown god but he has a name amen it's the lord jesus christ he says neither is he's neither worshiped with men's hands as though he needed anything seeth he giveth uh to all life breath and things and he hath made one blood all nations one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and determine the times before they appointed uh and the bounds of their inhabitation that they should seek the lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us now look what it said next for in him we live and we move and have our being amen as certain also of your own poets have said before we are also his offspring now he's dealing with you as being the offspring of god and if god is three that would make you three i debate with the theologian theologian one time and he had he was uh greek and his uh hebrew all over me i couldn't even i can't fight that i can't i'm not a theologian i can't fight that so at the end of the thing i said well let me let me place you in a box i'm thinking myself i said i'm just going to ask you a couple questions okay i said are you three persons if you've got three persons and where made an image are you three persons he said yes i said i looked at the brother i said there we go so you're three people he's like yes sir okay and i went on with other questions this night and i just wanted to state so i could show this brother that they believe they are literally three people okay that's all like that's how you fight him i mean yep you're three okay you said you are three then all right guess what i'm one person now for as much then as we are the offspring of god if we are the offspring of god if we were there in genesis 1 and 26 and 27 28 if we were there before the foundation of the world in his mind if we really express the eternal thoughts of god if we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that godhead is like unto gold or silver deity redemption or stone graven by art and man's device right yes and the times of his ignorance god in the in in the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commands all men everywhere to repent right yeah now we've had to go through that same process again coming out of the catholic church reformation but notice how i highlighted graven by art and man's device that word graven means charmand charagma means a scratchy or an etching that a stamp sculptured figure graven a mark a mark that word right here graven by art it means a mark which is also the same word used for the mark of the beast so why would he list three things gold silver and stone three separate things right we all know what this is that is your graven image that is the trinity symbol here it is on uh well i can actually whoa i actually have this track at home i gave one actually to a brother in thailand he saw it and he was like whoa can i have that take it now i have brother camps because he wasn't using it so this is your trinity doctrine right here okay now father son holy spirit right this is more of the triquetra now and now they break it down to what they actually mean well this is pretty mysterious oh what are you really saying here this is what they're saying right here now there's truth in here and there's lies in here right right father father son holy ghost right i don't have that on there i guess i could here we go there it is right there float up all right and i was teaching this in thailand i said now father son and holy spirit notice how it says father is god we all believe that the son is god i believe that the holy spirit is god absolutely we have no problems there no calls close nothing but notice they say the father is not the holy spirit what was the one word in the beginning that was used for a lie thou shalt not surely die what did cain say i know not where my brother is and they use not as well father is not the holy spirit the holy spirit is not the father the father is not the son the son is not the father the son is not the holy spirit the holy spirit is not the father now what's all we gotta do is erase not and now we have truth now we have truth you take that not out it's an absolute true statement right because the son is the father the father is the son the holy ghost is the son the son is the father all in one sure now that's it now what's the danger about this and there's what they really literally believe three people in the godhead three entities right three three people literally three gods three gods that's what trinitarians believe when you are witnessing to your brothers and sisters who are in denomination try to explain this to them what do you really believe who is god does it make sense no makes no sense now why is it so dangerous as i'm sure brother jesse's taught this there's your triquetra follows the holy ghost and we see the 666 made right out of that symbol right the devil is a mastermind we also see it on the catholic church the pope's head there uh you know the trinity and all sorts all those sort of things and now uh let's move on here now we go back to the scripture so that's graven by art we're we're not supposed to make an image on the christ right under god but notice it says and man's device what does that mean man's device now we're at about an hour right now and i'm almost done that word man's device it means to deliberation a deliberation a thought a device a thought to be in spirited that is to ponder to think about man's device so what that scripture say for we then as as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like into three separate things graven by art and man's thinking thinking craven by r to make a trinity symbol or man's device now why would it mean that the word device means thought or thinking to ponder because it took 462 years to get the trinity doctrine out of seven councils their top seven councils number one nia council that's where uh the church in rome fell and what was their thing at that time the trinity doctrine was adopted as truth but then they had a question is the sun eternal and they had to think on that for 50 more years till the next council and they had to form a doctrine they just could not understand god through the scriptures constantly one is their question was is the holy spirit the third person the next one ephesus the council of ephesus was mary mary the bearer of christ divine nature we're dealing with godhead remember she's co-mediatrix coreydentics lady she is the uh immaculate recep conception the immaculate conception is not jesus christ according to catholic church it is mary was born virgin too ephesus was mary the bearer of christ bearer of christ divine nature as well could she have something to do with salvation next over 100 years or more chancellor dawn or whatever how you say that did christ bless you did christ have two one or two natures and how now that was revealed in our day but said he's what christ had it looked like he had dual personalities because the mystery is that jesus christ was both fully god and fully man the god was inside of him but that flesh had a man's spirit and a man flesh and all that and that's why he would say one thing one way and then say thing another way because sometimes god himself would speak through it and that would be the god on the inside the middle god and then sometimes the flesh would say things as well yes we talked about uh lazarus and the bible says jesus swept was that god weeping or is that the flesh man that was the flesh man that's right and they're reading these scriptures way back then and they could not put it together did christ have one or two natures and how they don't even say god because he think that's the second person trinity the second person trinity have two natures or one then he got four constantinople two how did we and how do we can we interpret dual natures without dividing christ in two constantinople three did christ have one have one or two wills sorry i forgot to eat one or two wills because he didn't want to die but yet he wanted to die because it was the father's will so did he have two wills or one constantinople through uh niacia 2 can icons of christ be worshipped and how and this through these 462 years of counsel these are just the top ones look what they're talking about think not the godhead is like in a silver gold or stone graven by art and man's device in one split second peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus said that's exactly right absolutely no studying no counsel [Laughter] no 462 years one second [Laughter] and that's just how fast god can change us amen amen hey man if god i'll say this if remember what was that great question in the church book when when the bride understands who she is and that she can do the great works did you know the revelation of jesus christ came in one second when is the revelation of who we are gonna come it could come in one second just like that yeah oh help this game i don't think i was thinking about that there we go now why is it so important why am i even touching this because there is a need for it yes and if this be the greatest capstone revelation and he gave some apostles and some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for who's it for who's brother jesse four who am i for who are these ministers that get behind her for you for the bride for the laity we are your servants yes the bible calls them gifts for you so we all what for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all notice what come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god so the purpose of the five fold is to reveal to you who jesus christ really is amen is he a second person is he a third person does he have two dual natures or you just have dual personalities the prophet said because he was both god and man at one time was it god in the flesh was who was he this the true fivefold ministry should be able to teach by the grace of god and make it simple who jesus christ was amen and notice he talks about unity of faith and knowledge of son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth need to be no more children toast to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine notice where the winds of doctrine is going to come where's the gates of hell going to try and stop the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of god and cunning craftiness whereby they lay white they lie and wait to deceive wiles of the devil amen yes praise god he says in some time the capstone will return the head of it all and receive the bride unto himself which the woman took him from is from a man apart took from the man a part of the man every genes of man in the man is in the woman that makes the woman and that's why the word of god is in the church that's what makes the church the bride non-denominational that's the devil every one of my i ain't calling the people in there that they are poor deceived people like jesus said blind leading the blind right he says so it's christ expressing himself in the individual whether he's intellectual or not whether he known as abc's half the apostles didn't know it that's right but they know christ they never had to be taken heed to peter john knowing they had been out of some seminary they take heed and notice that they had been with christ a man let's stand by the grace of god that's a hour and seven minutes but i just wanted to make i want to get you minds ready because a deception is coming and if the gates of hell are coming against the godhead and they have been for a thousand two thousand years with a gentile bride then we must prep for the final test is there a final test coming on that i don't know but let's be ready amen study lord reveal more of yourself to us give us revelation of who you are show us your real give us everything we need hallelujah because we're going to need it the new birth is christ the new birth is christ is a revelation because if you've had that new birth jesus christ will give you that revelation thoroughly god had has revealed it to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when they get all that group together where the revelation is in perfect harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day and it will probably take in one second the revelation of who she is will come at one time it'll be a worldwide move in each local church and then the rapture will go when it knows what it is why do you hug a church why do you thirst is the father trying to reveal the secret hidden secret to you and what's that sermon christ is the mystery of god revealed he's trying to give a full now brother i thought that is the best is my understanding is there greater absolutely it's probably greater way greater probably revelation of it and it's coming but look it's a father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you like your job you let your wife you let your husband let your children let your cares of the world let you let some past you let someone else get that out of you and when you know that way down deep in your heart you're thirsting hungry it's god trying to reveal to you see the revelation the last day is here notice now there's coming to the point remember when he draws knives when we see him we shall be like him we shall be as he is amen we're coming to a an actual real bride awakening amen all hearts minds clear yeah are we doing okay yeah did it help a little bit a little bit greater revelation why would why would peter warren in acts 17 29 beware of these things he said these these images these markings their devices these thoughts these reasonings the revelation of god should come so easily amen absolutely and if he will manifest himself here and that he is here then this very holy spirit that can you res that you can re uh that you receive proves it is him pentecost is the only thing going to prove christianity you can't prove it by science you can't prove it by nothing but by pentecostal experiences you baptist know that and your methods present whatever you are you know it takes pentecostal experience to prove god saints of god i knew this was truth and this message was truth in many many different ways but when a year and a half after i'd been baptized i received the baptism of the ghost i knew this it was i knew that god was god and he had accepted uh i think it's my belief i'll say like that and i had accepted his sacrifice fully and did our best to die out he says and it's to each individual it doesn't prove the organization it proves the individual that's why in many churches as many as a uh big meetings people receive the baptism of the holy ghost that does not prove that the minister's right that the whole assembly is right it proves that that person met god right there amen amen at those kind of meetings every person should receive a baptism of the holy ghost well that's easy to say it is easy to say because there's many times i have not received it again or refilling but in the grand scheme of things when we see these big meetings or even meetings here anointed means where god is moving the holy spirit is moving and someone received the holy ghost that proves that individual right there yeah and that is to that individual into the church uni uh in a whole as well proves that person's been filled with the holy ghost and they can have confidence that god's gonna finish the work amen amen now here's a beautiful thing i saw in the book of revelation of jesus christ in the what they would say the red letters jesus never reveals himself who is this the alpha the omega he does not reveal himself until after the door closes and he says to me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time of the hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he is filthy let me see if he'll be still he is righteous let me register and he is holy holy still and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be i am alpha and omega he said that revelations 1. this is the beginning and revelation 1 the first and last revelations one blessed are they do his commandments for they have the right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city for without our dogs horses whoremongers and murderers adulterers and whoever loveth and maketh a lie i jesus now this he declares who did this now i wonder this too at the closing of the door he's going to reveal himself and have sent my angel remember the prophet said that angel in revelations 1 1 was the same angel all the way through he said it was an eagle he broke forth the godhead he broke forth the revelation 17-18 he broke forth he was there speaking with john and showing those things so much that when he spoke john thought it was god he said get up i'm one of the prophets i jesus have sent my angel to testify unto these things in the churches i am the root the beginning and where all that was that come out of david ingesting all them i am the root and offspring of david and the bright and morning star the revelation of jesus christ comes right at the end amen amen amen and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he crop by flatteries but the people that do know their god shall be strong and do exploits but first you must know your god and that comes through the revelation of the living god jesus christ let's bow our heads dearly father lord jesus we just love you and lord jesus lord we are thankful lord for faithful soldiers lord come to hear a little study god lord on what you said was you anointed your prophet and man of god there to write and say that this was the capstone revelation of the entire bible of all revelations this

wonder if sometimes that one of them demons knew that you were god gets in some people and then people will say the exact same thing that demon's saying they'll look like they're christians it's just the devil's revelation and lord jesus lord we don't want them lord if all the people are eyes closed lord lord if they raise their hands glorious ask lord he would just bless the lord and give them
