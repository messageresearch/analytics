TRANSCRIPT
========================================
revelation chapter 16. [Music] the themes of this chapter include the pouring out of the seven vials of the wrath of god and a blessing pronounced by christ for those who watch for his coming the pouring out of the seven vowels is detailed in 20 out of the 21 verses in this chapter the seven vowels have a strong similarity to the ten plagues that god executed on egypt when israel left egypt in the days of moses the first vow will be grievous soars upon the men who take the mark of the beast similar to the boils of the sixth plague upon egypt the second vow will be the sea turning into blood similar to the first plague upon egypt the third vow will be the rivers and fountains of water turning into blood again similar to the first plague upon egypt the fourth vow will be the sun scorching man with great fire and heat the fifth vow will be darkness upon the seat of the beast which is the vatican in rome for the beast is a kingdom according to daniel 7 and the kingdom of rome rules today not by military force but by religion and this darkness plague is similar to the ninth plague upon egypt the sixth vowel will be the drawing up of the river euphrates and the three unclean spirits like frogs that gather the kings of the earth and the whole world unto the battle of the great day of god almighty which we believe is armageddon the seventh and final vial will be poured out right before the battle of armageddon and will contain the greatest earthquake the world has ever seen rome that great city will be divided into three parts islands will flee away and mountains will not be found great hail will fall upon the men of the earth as they continue to blaspheme god and this is similar to the seventh plague that contained hail from egypt only verse 15 has a different theme which is the blessing pronounced by christ for his wife or bride the new testament church who is currently waiting for the rapture behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame this blessing is likely to christ's bride because first thessalonians 4 verses 15 through 18 and first thessalonians 5 verse 2 and verse 4 speak of christ coming back as a thief the same as in revelation chapter 16 verse 15 the fact this blessing is in a tribulation text does not mean the new testament church goes through the tribulation it seems god left this blessing in the text because he knew believers would be reading this prophetic book for the next two thousand years awaiting his second coming the symbols and key revelations include the mark of the beast the image of the beast repentance the seed of the beast the dragon beast false prophet and the battle of the great day of god almighty the mark of the beast is a symbol of accepting the doctrines and doing the will of the one world religion the image of the beast is symbolic for the united council of catholic and protestant churches that hold false doctrines and will seek to destroy true christians repentance is a key revelation in this chapter because under the fifth vowel the tormented group with pains and sores still refuses to repent of their deeds repentance has a three-fold effect and includes one a change of mind two a hatred for past sins and three a making amends for past sins please see our video series on true repentance for an in-depth teaching into this doctrine acts 2 verse 38 tells us the first step to getting right with god for salvation is to repent and be baptized so we can clearly see that the beast worshipers do not even care to reach the first step towards loving god because they love their sins more than the holiness of god just as jesus taught in john 3 verses 19 through 21 and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deed should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the truth that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god the seed of the beast is symbolic for the vatican in rome for that is where satan's seat is located currently satan's first seat was in babylon or modern-day iraq then he moved his seat to pergamos according to revelation 2 verse 13 in modern day turkey and his thirsty is now the vatican in rome according to revelation 17 verse 9. the dragon and beast and false prophet are revealed as the following the dragon is satan himself according to revelation 12 verse 9. the beast is the demonic spirit behind the kingdom of rome or the vatican according to daniel 7 verse 23 the false prophet is the future pope who eventually becomes the person of the antichrist and deceives the world by his deceiving miracles according to revelation 19 verse 20. this is true because the roman catholic church is the woman who sits upon the beast revelation 17 verse 3 and the pope is the head of the woman or roman catholic church the battle of that great day of god almighty is symbolic of the battle of armageddon because verse 16 tells us this armageddon is located at the modern day plain of azraelon in northern israel the bible name for this location is the valley of jezreel a famous location of the great victories of barrack over the canaanites and of gideon over the midi knights the timing of events is as follows the first six vowels take place sometime after the seven trumpets and the sixth vowel is what gathers the beast armies to the battle of armageddon according to verses 12 through 14 and 16. it seems the seventh and final vow is poured out shortly before the battle of armageddon because men are still alive and blaspheming god because of the plague of the hail see verse 21 the battle of armageddon is when nearly all men and women who took the mark of the beast are slain in judgment by the sword that proceeds out of the mouth of christ jesus according to revelation 19 verses 18 and 19. if you'd
