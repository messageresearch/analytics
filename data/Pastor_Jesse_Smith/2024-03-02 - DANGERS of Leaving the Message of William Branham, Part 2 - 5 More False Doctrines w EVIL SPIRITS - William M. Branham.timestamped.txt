[0:03] no more Bob haired women will enter that
[0:05] City I'll guarantee you that no more
[0:08] short wearing cigarettes smoking horor
[0:10] mongers hores or Liars idolators
[0:12] whatever they was won't enter that City
[0:15] no it all be over sin will be gone
[0:18] nothing to defile its Holiness shall
[0:20] enter
[0:22] there greetings friends in the matchless
[0:24] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:27] purpose of this video is to do a part
[0:29] two
[0:30] on the dangers of leaving the bible
[0:33] message that Jesus Christ revealed to
[0:35] his true Prophet The Late William
[0:37] brandham 1909 to
[0:40] 1965 by God's grace in this video we'll
[0:43] cover five more false doctrines that
[0:46] anti- message people often adopt and
[0:49] therefore they adopt evil spirits
[0:51] according to 1 Timothy 4:1 they give
[0:54] heed to seducing spirits and doctrines
[0:56] of devils but first hi friends my name
[0:59] is Jesse Smith Smith I'm Pastor bride of
[1:01] Christ Fellowship and I defend the Bible
[1:03] revelations that Jesus Christ revealed
[1:04] to his true Prophet William brandham and
[1:07] I also defend The Godly character of
[1:10] brother William brandham before getting
[1:12] into these five more false doctrines I
[1:14] just want to share a scriptural warning
[1:16] for those that have left the message
[1:17] it's found in 2 Peter 2:
[1:21] 14-22 of course the Bible tells us to
[1:23] warn all men in Colossians 1:28 and also
[1:27] 1 Thessalonians 5:14 warn them that are
[1:30] unruly and a lot of these people that
[1:32] leave the message become unruly
[1:35] especially in the area of Pride as we
[1:37] show here by the grace of God but the
[1:40] warning is for those that knew the way
[1:42] of righteousness but then turn from the
[1:45] holy commandment so this is for the
[1:47] people that used to be in the message
[1:49] and have left the message and then live
[1:52] a more sinful life after they've left
[1:55] the message so they would have lived
[1:57] more wholly while following the bible
[1:59] message that that God gave to brother
[2:00] brandham but now they live a sinful life
[2:04] so of course it's not everyone but it's
[2:06] likely many of them by God's grace so it
[2:09] starts off in 2 Peter 2:14 they have
[2:12] eyes full of adultery which we'll get to
[2:15] in a little bit a lot of these people
[2:17] that leave the message now enjoy viewing
[2:19] sinful content and then in verse 14 they
[2:22] beguile unstable Souls we see these
[2:26] anti- message people drawing people away
[2:28] they're deceiving the unstable Souls
[2:31] that were on the message and never
[2:32] became stable through the baptism of the
[2:35] Holy Ghost and then in 2 Peter 25 they
[2:38] have forsaken the right way and gone
[2:40] astray some of them go back into
[2:43] Catholicism some of them don't even
[2:45] serve God anymore some go into churches
[2:47] that have no Holiness standard so
[2:49] they've gone astray and again we're not
[2:51] against the people but we are against
[2:53] the denominational system that Harbors
[2:56] false doctrines and then notice 2 Peter
[2:59] 28 18 they speak great swelling words of
[3:02] vanity many of the leaders of the anti-
[3:04] message movement do this constantly they
[3:08] speak such awful things against brother
[3:10] brandham and those who follow the bible
[3:12] message brother brandham gave us they
[3:14] exalt themselves and then notice they
[3:17] Allure through the lust of the flesh a
[3:19] lot of these people again live a sinful
[3:22] life once they leave the message and so
[3:24] it proves they were tempted by the enemy
[3:27] to leave the message they can go live a
[3:29] s sinful life such as drinking alcohol
[3:32] viewing sinful content living in
[3:34] adultery or non-binary
[3:37] relationships and this is one I see
[3:39] often second Peter 2:19 while they
[3:41] promise them Liberty they themselves are
[3:44] the Servants of corruption and I get
[3:47] these comments often from people that
[3:48] have left the message they say brother
[3:50] Jesse one day you'll be free and leave
[3:52] the message and this is the scripture
[3:54] that the Holy Spirit brings to my memory
[3:57] the people that have left the message
[3:58] are promising people live Liberty but
[4:00] many times they just become servants to
[4:02] corruption servants to sin and I'm
[4:05] thankful I found true Liberty of the
[4:08] Holy Ghost believing the message I used
[4:11] to be a servant of corruption as a
[4:13] Baptist or as a Assembly of God Church
[4:16] member but the message of the hour the
[4:19] bible message has cleaned me from that
[4:21] by the grace of God and the proof of
[4:24] that is in 2 Peter 2:19 for of whom a
[4:27] man is overcome of the same as he
[4:29] brought into bondage a lot of these
[4:31] people that leave the message allow
[4:33] themselves to go into sinful addictions
[4:35] or the bondage of sin and that's what 2
[4:38] Peter 2:20 says when they were in the
[4:41] message they escaped the pollutions of
[4:42] the world but now they're entangled
[4:45] therein again and overcome and the
[4:47] latter end is worse than the beginning 2
[4:49] Peter 2:21 says for it had been better
[4:52] for them not to have known the way of
[4:53] righteousness then after they have known
[4:55] it to turn from the holy commandment
[4:57] delivered unto them that's what the
[4:59] message is to me it's the holy commands
[5:01] of the Bible spoken through the Lord
[5:03] Jesus Christ and then through Paul Peter
[5:05] John James brother R is pointing us back
[5:08] to those Bible revelations those holy
[5:11] commandments so we're thankful for the
[5:13] true Liberty of the Holy Ghost now let's
[5:15] get into some more examples of the false
[5:17] doctrines that anti- message people
[5:20] accept the first one is viewing sinful
[5:23] content I've heard numerous people that
[5:26] have left the message say now they can
[5:27] watch sinful TV shows sinful movies like
[5:31] one of the leaders who has his own
[5:33] podcast of the historical research
[5:36] podcast or I call historical rewrite
[5:38] podcast he says he's free now he can
[5:41] watch murder mysteries now he can watch
[5:43] Dracula unless his children watch
[5:45] Dracula movies and then he named movies
[5:48] that were rated R that were on his
[5:50] bucket list to watch and all these
[5:52] movies contain blasphemy against the
[5:54] name of God sexual morality murder and
[5:58] murder is an abomination the sight of
[6:00] God so friends if that's freedom I don't
[6:02] want any part of their freedom the Bible
[6:05] says abstain from all appearance of evil
[6:07] first Thessalonians
[6:08] 5:22 and Psalm 1013 I'll set no Wicked
[6:12] thing before mine eyes I hate the work
[6:14] of them that turn aside it shall not
[6:15] cleave to me so these people that have
[6:18] left the message and now view sinful
[6:21] content they have a spirit of whoredoms
[6:23] because spiritually they're making love
[6:25] to evil spirits they love the drama of
[6:28] the R-rated movies or worse and I'd say
[6:31] another thing I've also heard this one
[6:33] man say he can now listen to ACDC
[6:35] Nirvana and he sees it as an art form
[6:39] rather than a song with the working of
[6:41] devils it's so sad shame on these people
[6:43] for what they've allowed they're
[6:45] allowing sinful content into their lives
[6:48] along with the spirit of whoredoms this
[6:50] might be a perverse Spirit or a seducing
[6:53] Spirit the next sin that anti- message
[6:57] people often manifest is pride of course
[6:59] this is called a hotty spirit in
[7:01] Proverbs
[7:02] 16:18 its height its exaltation its
[7:06] Grandeur arrogance Majesty a lot of
[7:10] people that leave the message get the
[7:11] spirit of Pride the evil spirit of Pride
[7:15] one man in particular I've heard it he
[7:17] lets other people call him a professor
[7:19] like he's a professor of research on the
[7:22] podcast that he goes on this is prideful
[7:25] one man that left the message writes in
[7:27] his own book he said people call call me
[7:29] a walking Bible friends that's a
[7:32] prideful statement these people exalt
[7:34] themselves with such haughtiness they
[7:37] have such excellence and majesty and
[7:40] they act like they've never contradicted
[7:42] themselves of course brother brandom
[7:43] grew in understanding and Revelation but
[7:45] they act like they've had it all right
[7:47] their whole lives they act like none of
[7:50] their family members or friends ever did
[7:52] anything awful of course we know people
[7:54] around brother bram's Ministry have done
[7:56] awful things or did awful things after
[7:58] brother Bram died and left the scene so
[8:01] we see pride manifesting on a lot of
[8:02] these people that left the message
[8:04] Proverbs 26:28 says a flattering mouth
[8:08] worketh ruin and again these people
[8:09] flatter themselves like they're so free
[8:12] they're so much wiser now that they left
[8:14] the message and of course they
[8:16] pridefully exalt themselves like their
[8:19] bereans and they only study the Bible to
[8:21] condemn brother brandham they never get
[8:23] down to True Bible Revelation most of
[8:26] them aren't even preachers I've offered
[8:28] some of these people free copies of my
[8:30] books and they won't even read them or
[8:32] invest time into them and yet I'll
[8:34] listen to many of their podcasts and
[8:36] YouTube videos in order to prove them
[8:38] wrong so it shows they're afraid of the
[8:40] truth yet they exalt themselves in Pride
[8:43] but this is just as the Bible said in 2
[8:45] Chronicles 13:16 they mock The
[8:47] Messengers of God and despise his words
[8:50] and misuse His prophets until the wrath
[8:51] of God arose against his people to there
[8:54] was no remedy these anti-age people mock
[8:57] brother brandham Yet brother brandham
[8:58] labor hundreds if not thousands of times
[9:01] in prayer lines praying for the sick and
[9:03] The Afflicted traveled to preach the
[9:05] gospel dealt with Sinners to come to the
[9:07] Altar and repent give their hearts to
[9:10] Christ be filled with the Holy Ghost be
[9:12] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[9:13] Christ and these anti- message people
[9:16] they mock brother random as they deny
[9:18] the Bible verses that brother random
[9:20] pointed us to they add to the Bible they
[9:22] take away from the Bible they call
[9:24] themselves bans and they only parrot the
[9:27] slanderous talking points from the
[9:28] believer the slander website and all the
[9:31] weak research done on that website and
[9:33] the historical rewrite podcast they mock
[9:36] brother Brandon while they engage in
[9:39] sexual immorality and they support
[9:41] nonbinary perversion they mock brother
[9:44] Brandon and call him a plagiarist but
[9:45] brother brandham was not a plagiarist
[9:47] they don't even know the research on the
[9:49] first seal they won't even admit that
[9:52] brother brandham referenced his storan
[9:53] over 20 times during the church ages and
[9:56] brother Ram's main Revelation on the
[9:57] future home was the three works of Grace
[9:59] which Clarence Larin did not teach so
[10:02] moving on to the sixth example these
[10:05] anti- message people teach one work of
[10:08] Grace friends to accept this lie they
[10:11] have to have the spirit of he the
[10:13] seducing spirit and a lying Spirit the
[10:16] Bible gives us at least five examples of
[10:18] people that had to experience the three
[10:20] works of Grace now think about that
[10:22] these anti-age people believe in one
[10:25] work of Grace in other words when little
[10:27] children or young teenagers give their
[10:28] hearts the lord they're supposedly
[10:30] filled with the Holy Ghost any honest
[10:33] person who has an honest Spirit knows
[10:36] that that's not the case these young
[10:38] people these young children have to grow
[10:41] in grace and the knowledge of the Lord
[10:42] and receive the full baptism of the Holy
[10:44] Ghost in their souls but these anti-mage
[10:47] people deny that and they say there's
[10:49] only one work of Grace shame on them
[10:51] they've got the spirit of air they've
[10:53] got a lying Spirit remember the five
[10:55] Bible examples are Peter and Mary we can
[10:58] see how they were saved but they had to
[10:59] be Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[11:01] Ghost in Acts chap 2 the Samaritans in
[11:04] Acts chap 8 they were baptized but they
[11:06] hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet so
[11:08] Peter and John had to come lay hands on
[11:10] them acts 10 cornelus and his house they
[11:13] were praying fasting giving alms they
[11:15] knew about Christ but they didn't get
[11:16] the Holy Ghost till Peter came and
[11:18] preached to them and then Acts 19 the
[11:21] Ephesians there were 12 of them they
[11:23] followed Apollos they were Justified and
[11:26] Sanctified but they didn't know about
[11:27] the Holy Ghost until Paul told told them
[11:29] about it Paul laid his hands on them
[11:31] they received the baptism of the Holy
[11:33] Ghost and of course Ezekiel taught the
[11:35] three works of Grace in Ezekiel 36 new
[11:37] heart new spirit my spirit and Friends
[11:40] these people have to have a lying Spirit
[11:43] they deceive Believers into thinking
[11:45] they've already arrived at the spiritual
[11:47] birth when in reality many of these
[11:49] professors of being saved will fail the
[11:52] grace of God and go back into the world
[11:54] because Jesus said few there be that
[11:55] find the narrow road in Matthew 7 many
[11:59] of their converts are false converts
[12:01] with dried dyed confessions their
[12:03] experiences in no way resemble day of
[12:06] Pentecost the book of Acts true baptism
[12:09] of the Holy Ghost experience and
[12:11] remember Jesus Christ said it's a
[12:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost in act chapter
[12:14] 1 verse 5 so these anti- message people
[12:18] reject the true Gospel of Jesus Christ
[12:21] which includes the three works of Grace
[12:24] another example of a false Doctrine is a
[12:26] lying spirit because these anti-mage
[12:28] people they lie about brother
[12:31] brandham so again this one kind of
[12:33] relates to the prideful Spirit but many
[12:35] of these anti-age people are liars
[12:38] brother brandom is not here to defend
[12:40] himself so when they jump to conclusions
[12:42] based on presumptions they are lying
[12:46] they cannot prove many of their claims
[12:48] about brother brandom and I have
[12:49] numerous videos about this and podcasts
[12:52] if you'd like to see that by God's grace
[12:54] they lie about brother brandom
[12:56] supposedly being a plagiarist but
[12:58] brother brandom was
[12:59] there's over 38 differences on the Seven
[13:01] Seals between brother brandham and Lin
[13:04] and Charles T Russell they lie about so
[13:07] many things and again they wouldn't jump
[13:09] to these conclusions if they had an
[13:11] honest spirit so this proves they have a
[13:13] lying Spirit an eighth example is they
[13:16] have shameful repulsive hair
[13:21] lengths that's according to First
[13:22] Corinthians 11
[13:24] 1-16 the Bible said a woman that cuts
[13:26] her hair dishonors her husband or her
[13:28] head
[13:29] of course that dishonors Christ and God
[13:31] as well the word dishonor means
[13:34] dishonorable repulsive and friends the
[13:37] anti- message people will never own up
[13:40] to the fact that God never asked a Godly
[13:43] woman to cut her hair anywhere in the
[13:45] Bible that ought to prove to anybody
[13:48] that these anti- message people are off
[13:50] the word of God but of course they'll
[13:52] just ignore that these women that cut
[13:54] their hair are cutting off God's glory
[13:56] which represents the Holy Spirit
[13:58] according to the book of Isaiah in
[14:00] Isaiah God said my spirit is my covering
[14:02] and then we see long hair is a covering
[14:05] in 1 Corinthians 11 so these women that
[14:08] cut their hair or men that grow their
[14:09] hair out long without cutting it they're
[14:12] repulsive they're shameful and they're
[14:14] rejecting the anointing of the holy
[14:16] spirit in their
[14:17] lives and the last one for this video
[14:20] will be
[14:22] crossdressing recently I put out a video
[14:25] about how brother Brandon was Vindicated
[14:27] to preach against crossdress
[14:29] as Hollywood has had an agenda for many
[14:31] years to get men to crossdress in
[14:33] women's clothing so I'll put a link to
[14:36] that video in the description but of
[14:38] course people that leave the message
[14:39] deny Deuteronomy 225 and they fail to
[14:43] see that the moral law of God in many
[14:45] cases continues in the New Testament I
[14:47] just taught our children about this in
[14:49] our Sunday school and there was over 16
[14:52] I believe Abominations in the Old
[14:55] Testament that continued in the New
[14:57] Testament and so for for the anti-
[14:59] message people to say women can wear
[15:02] women's pants and men can dress like
[15:04] women they no doubt have a perverse
[15:06] Spirit that's according to Isaiah 19:14
[15:09] the Lord hath mingled a perverse spirit
[15:12] in the midst thereof perverse means a
[15:14] warping a distorting so these anti-
[15:17] message people are distorting the
[15:19] difference God put between men and women
[15:21] not only in their hair lengths but also
[15:23] in their clothing and again I've told
[15:26] some of these anti- message people go
[15:27] read the book when women in pants by
[15:30] Greg and Smith from 2003 this shows the
[15:33] history of how there was an uproar when
[15:35] women started wearing pants all the way
[15:37] back to the late 1800s but especially
[15:39] during the 20th century or the 1900s but
[15:43] will they read it no because they've got
[15:45] an evil spirit and they will not accept
[15:46] the truth if they would accept the truth
[15:49] then they'd have the spirit of Truth the
[15:50] holy spirit it's never okay for women to
[15:53] wear pants it's never okay for men to
[15:56] wear women's skirts or women men's
[15:59] undergarments in
[16:01] closing friends I hope this video was a
[16:03] blessing by the grace of God this is
[16:05] probably the final video I'll do at
[16:07] least in the short term maybe in the
[16:08] long term I'll do another video but I
[16:10] just want to show these nine simple
[16:11] examples of how anti- message people
[16:14] they leave the Bible teachings of the
[16:16] message and these are true Bible
[16:18] teachings but if they reject that they
[16:19] have to take on these evil spirits
[16:22] because the Bible says they give heed to
[16:24] seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
[16:27] that's again why I'm so grateful for the
[16:29] Holy Ghost the spirit of Truth like 2
[16:31] John 1:9 says whosoever abideth not in
[16:35] the doctrine of Christ hath not God
[16:37] these people cannot be born again they
[16:39] cannot have God in their souls because
[16:42] they deny the doctrine of Jesus Christ
[16:45] but he that abideth in the doctrine of
[16:46] Christ hath both the father and the son
[16:48] what a promise church doctrine is so
[16:51] important so is Supernatural works and
[16:53] miracles and the power of God that's
[16:56] also important as well but we can never
[16:58] m major on a minor so again if we have
[17:00] the Holy Ghost it'll guide us into all
[17:02] the truth the truth on Supernatural
[17:04] works the truth on the gifts of God and
[17:06] the truth on Bible Doctrine so let's
[17:09] have a prayer for these people again
[17:12] Heavenly Father we ask God again you be
[17:13] merciful to these people that have left
[17:15] the message whether on the tape worship
[17:18] side or the believe the slander side
[17:20] dear God I just pray God they could find
[17:23] the spirit of Truth they could humble
[17:24] themselves and repent of their doctrines
[17:26] of devils and their seduc ing Spirits oh
[17:29] God open their heart and Minds to the
[17:31] truth of this Bible Lord God may they be
[17:33] true bereans and not just bereans by
[17:36] name
[17:37] only God we thank you for your mercy and
[17:39] Grace help us Lord as message Believers
[17:41] to have continual Humble Hearts
[17:43] searching our hearts Lord God examining
[17:47] ourselves whether we be in the faith and
[17:49] Lord we pray again that these people
[17:51] that have left can return back to the
[17:53] truth if it Be Your Will Lord God have
[17:55] mercy on them and God have mercy on us

[17:59] Mercy so we give you all the praise in

[18:12] Christ be the desire of your
