[0:02] I command everyone of you on here on
[0:05] tape that hasn't been baptized in the
[0:07] name of Jesus Christ be baptized again
[0:11] in the name of Jesus Christ
[0:14] amen greetings friends in the matchless
[0:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:19] purpose of this video is to share a
[0:21] wonderful Bible Revelation of rebaptism
[0:24] from the Old Testament and this is a
[0:26] brand new revelation that I had never
[0:28] heard of the Lord revealed it to my
[0:30] brother Simon who's also a teacher and
[0:33] missionary to Thailand and God revealed
[0:35] it to him in early December 20123 while
[0:39] he was on a missionary trip in Thailand
[0:41] so I asked my brother Simon if I could
[0:43] make a video about this wonderful
[0:44] Revelation I think it'll be a great
[0:46] blessing by God's grace I'll go through
[0:48] this wonderful Bible Revelation of
[0:51] rebaptism of course we know rebaptism in
[0:53] the New Testament according to acts 19:
[0:58] 1-7 but it is beautifully typed in the
[1:01] Old Testament through the life of Joseph
[1:03] in the Book of Genesis Exodus and then
[1:05] when his bones are finally buried in the
[1:07] promised land in shikim or chicham
[1:10] however you say it it's a city in Israel
[1:13] in the lot of Manasseh before getting
[1:16] into this Revelation I do want to take a
[1:17] few moments and share how this is an
[1:19] example a beautiful example I believe of
[1:22] how brother bandam said we would be
[1:23] given more information about the same
[1:25] Revelation this is found in the church
[1:28] age book pages 83 and 884 brother
[1:32] brandham wonderfully teaches us that God
[1:34] can't give a first revelation than a
[1:36] second brother Bram said he gives the
[1:38] people more information to help them
[1:40] receive and understand the same
[1:42] Revelation so that's what we have today
[1:44] as message Believers we have the
[1:46] revelation of the water baptism in the
[1:48] name of the Lord Jesus Christ full of
[1:49] Merion and water not calling on titles
[1:52] father son Holy Ghost but calling on the
[1:54] one name to the father son Holy Ghost
[1:56] which is the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:57] Christ and so a person that's been
[2:00] baptized any other way once they receive
[2:02] the knowledge of this true Lord Jesus
[2:04] Christ water baptism should be
[2:06] re-baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:08] Jesus Christ so if a person was baptized
[2:11] in titles father son Holy Ghost and
[2:13] immersed they need to be re-baptized in
[2:15] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or if
[2:17] they were sprinkled with the titles
[2:18] father son Holy Ghost they need to be
[2:20] re-baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:22] Jesus Christ and this idea about
[2:24] rebaptism which brother Brandon preached
[2:26] of course proves there is a message of
[2:29] the hour
[2:30] that needs to be received and it's found
[2:32] in the Bible of course brother's
[2:34] accusers say there's no such thing as a
[2:36] message of the hour and that's a bunch
[2:39] of nonsense these people are not Bible
[2:42] preachers they don't have gifts of God
[2:43] to preach and teach the word of God like
[2:45] brother bradam had to gift to be a
[2:47] prophet Apostle Pastor teacher and
[2:50] evangelist I believe brother bradam had
[2:52] all the five gifts the five preaching
[2:54] Gifts of Ephesians
[2:55] 4:1 the proof text for messages of the
[2:59] hour is Acts 19
[3:02] 1-7 it's a very familiar text to those
[3:05] of us who know the message of the hour
[3:07] Paul comes to Ephesus and he finds
[3:10] Believers there we know there was at
[3:12] least 12 cuz 12 received the baptism of
[3:14] the Holy Ghost but Apollos had already
[3:16] taught them the word of God in all the
[3:17] Old Testament scriptures about Jesus as
[3:20] Messiah and they were Believers but Paul
[3:22] came and asked them that wonderful
[3:23] question have ye received the Holy Ghost
[3:25] since you believed of course they said
[3:27] no we didn't know there was a Holy Ghost
[3:29] and then Paul asked them what were you
[3:31] baptized unto and they said John's
[3:32] baptism of course that's the baptism for
[3:35] repentance and remission of sins
[3:37] according to Mark 1:4 then Paul told
[3:39] them about the Lord Jesus Christ baptism
[3:42] and as soon as these Ephesians received
[3:44] the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism they
[3:46] laid their hands on them and they
[3:47] received the Holy Ghost 12 of them
[3:49] received the Holy Ghost according to
[3:51] acts
[3:52] 19:7 and so the accusers of brother
[3:54] brandham are ignorant of the Bible
[3:56] Revelation about the message of the hour
[3:58] what they fail to see is that God has
[4:00] always had a message of the hour think
[4:02] about if you lived in the days of Noah
[4:03] you had to receive his message of the
[4:05] hour in order to be saved what about the
[4:07] days of Abraham you had to receive his
[4:09] Revelation about circumcision and so
[4:11] forth to be saved then the days of Moses
[4:13] you had to receive his message because
[4:15] it was further revelation of the same
[4:17] message then the days of David you had
[4:19] to receive the further Revelation anyone
[4:21] that's read 1 Chronicles or 2 Chronicles
[4:24] knows David instituted Temple worship
[4:26] and musicians that was not in Moses's
[4:29] message that was a further Revelation
[4:31] given to David through the davidic
[4:33] Covenant God made a New Covenant and
[4:36] gave more Revelation about the Messiah
[4:38] he gave that to David So in David's day
[4:41] you had to receive the message of your
[4:42] hour two more Old Testament examples of
[4:45] receiving the message of your hour was
[4:47] in the days of zerubabel God used
[4:50] zerubabel to rebuild the Jewish temple
[4:52] after Israel's dispersion out of the
[4:54] promised land due to all their sins and
[4:57] zerel had the message of the hour
[4:58] through the two prophets Hagi and
[5:01] Zechariah remember friends they built a
[5:03] brand new Temple it was so much smaller
[5:05] in comparison to Solomon's Temple that
[5:07] the elders wept and cried but the Bible
[5:09] said they had to receive the day of
[5:11] small things and that's in Zechariah 4:9
[5:14] and 10 Ezra 3 12 and 13 no doubt there
[5:17] were Jews there saying we need to have a
[5:19] temple like Solomon's but the message of
[5:21] the hour was a day of small things God
[5:24] was still restoring he was restoring
[5:26] Temple worship so you had to receive the
[5:28] message of your hour and next was John
[5:31] the Baptist John the Baptist demanded
[5:33] everyone to repent and be baptized in
[5:35] water well you don't find that in the
[5:36] law of Moses where did Moses ever ask
[5:39] anyone to be baptized in water for
[5:41] remission of sins you don't see that you
[5:42] see the Waters of Separation The
[5:44] sprinkling of water but now John the
[5:46] Baptist demands people go down into the
[5:48] water be buried in water and be raised
[5:51] up in water so again you have to receive
[5:53] the message of your hour moving forward
[5:56] to the church age we can see how a lot
[5:57] of the revelations were lost beginning
[5:59] in the 2 and third especially the fourth
[6:01] Church age the depths of Satan but then
[6:04] in the fifth 6th and 7th we have the
[6:05] restoration of the Gospel of St Paul
[6:08] through Martin Luther any honest person
[6:11] would recognize Luther's message was
[6:13] restoring justification by faith and you
[6:16] had to receive that message of his hour
[6:18] and come out of the previous teaching
[6:20] and move on into the message of the hour
[6:23] that God revealed to Martin Luther and
[6:24] then to John Wesley then to isua street
[6:27] with William Seymour and now to the B
[6:29] restoration Ministry that God gave to
[6:31] William brandham with thus sayith the
[6:33] Lord and again as I said in my previous
[6:35] videos there's six scriptures that
[6:37] brother Brandon fulfilled in order to
[6:38] finish the mystery of God restore our
[6:40] hearts back to the apostolic fathers
[6:42] there's so much Bible proof If a heart
[6:45] is just humble and will open itself up
[6:47] to the true revelation of the Bible
[6:49] brother Ram's message restored Pauline
[6:52] Doctrine it restored the doctrine of the
[6:55] fathers by the grace of God and another
[6:57] example about more information on the
[6:59] same Revelation is the birth of the
[7:01] Messiah Jesus Christ the first
[7:04] revelation about his birth was Genesis
[7:06] 3:15 then of course Isaiah prophesied of
[7:09] him in many scriptures but most
[7:10] apparently Isaiah 53 Micah said he'd be
[7:13] born in Bethlehem Isaiah also said he'd
[7:16] be born of a virgin Isaiah 7 Hosea said
[7:19] he'd take a flight to Egypt with Mary
[7:22] and Joseph Jeremiah said people would
[7:24] weep at the massacre of the infants of
[7:26] Bethlehem and then Malachi 3:1 said he'd
[7:29] be anounced by John the Baptist God's
[7:31] messenger Now by God's grace we'll get
[7:33] into this wonderful
[7:34] Revelation here's a chart I made so the
[7:38] Revelation that God revealed to my
[7:39] brother Simon is that Joseph of the Old
[7:41] Testament son of Jacob was a type of
[7:44] being buried twice his two burials
[7:46] represent the two baptisms of the New
[7:49] Testament so let's start at the top of
[7:51] this chart Joseph is the type his first
[7:53] burial of course was in Egypt according
[7:55] to Genesis 50: 24 and 25 then Moses took
[8:00] his bones out in Exodus 13:19 but he was
[8:03] first buried in Egypt this is a type of
[8:06] the New Testament believer so the
[8:08] antitype of the first burial is the
[8:11] first baptism in the New Testament it
[8:13] was John the Baptist baptism it was a
[8:15] baptism unto repentance and remission of
[8:18] sins it's according to Mark
[8:20] 1:4 then of course Acts 19 1-5 Paul
[8:23] states that
[8:24] plainly the second burial Joseph had was
[8:28] in chichim in the promised land that's
[8:31] according to Joshua 24:32 Joshua and the
[8:34] people in Israel they brought Joseph's
[8:36] bones and they were finally buried in
[8:38] the promised land this is a type of the
[8:42] New Testament antitype of the Lord Jesus
[8:44] Christ water baptism and this baptism
[8:47] also gives you the baptism in the soul
[8:50] which is also called the baptism of the
[8:52] Holy Ghost or the new birth and this is
[8:55] called the promise of the father so
[8:58] catch that word promise
[8:59] in Joseph's life he was buried in the
[9:02] promised land on his second burial in
[9:04] the New Testament believer's life he's
[9:06] buried in water in the name of the Lord
[9:08] Jesus Christ with the promise to receive
[9:10] the soul baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[9:13] this Holy Ghost Soul baptism the new
[9:15] birth is the promise of the father
[9:17] according to Luke
[9:19] 24:49 acts 1:4 and then Peter says they
[9:22] receive this promise of the father in
[9:24] Acts
[9:25] 233 Jesus said this would be a soul
[9:28] baptism in Matthew 11 11
[9:30] 29 and then we see the Fulfillment of
[9:32] this in our proof text of Acts 19 1-7
[9:36] the Ephesians had already been baptized
[9:38] in the baptism of John they've had their
[9:40] first baptism or their first burial but
[9:42] there was a message of the hour they had
[9:44] to receive and when they received the
[9:46] message of the hour through St Paul now
[9:48] they could receive the water baptism in
[9:50] the name of the Lord Jesus and then the
[9:52] Soul baptism the promise of the father
[9:54] so we see Joseph back in the promised
[9:56] land and then we see the Ephesians re
[9:59] receiving the promise of the father it
[10:01] was on Joseph's second burial and it was
[10:03] on the and it was on the Ephesians
[10:06] second burial or baptism in water that
[10:08] they receive the promise or we'd say
[10:11] possess the spiritual Promised Land by
[10:13] God's
[10:15] grace the final part of this beautiful
[10:18] revelation God revealed to my brother is
[10:20] that because Joseph had this second
[10:22] burial in the promised land he got a
[10:24] reward for it and the reward was a
[10:27] bodily resurrection and a Ascension to
[10:29] Glory this is awesome Matthew 27:52 and
[10:33] 53 said many of the Saints had a bodily
[10:35] Resurrection when Jesus resurrected We
[10:38] Believe Joseph was there we also believe
[10:39] job was there Abraham Sarah many of the
[10:42] Old Testament Saints the Bible said job
[10:45] also prophesied of this in job 19:25 and
[10:48] 26 and then the Bible said Jesus then
[10:50] LED them into Glory he led captivity
[10:53] captive according to Ephesians
[10:56] 4:8 so because of his second burial he
[10:59] got the reward of Resurrection that's
[11:01] exactly what we see with the New
[11:03] Testament believer the reward for being
[11:05] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[11:07] Christ and receiving the baptism of the
[11:09] Holy Ghost the promise of the father is
[11:11] the first resurrection with Ascension to
[11:14] glory and the first resurrection is
[11:16] found in Revelation 20:
[11:19] 1-5 this is known as the Rapture it's
[11:22] the meeting in the air with the Lord
[11:24] Jesus Christ and all the dead in Christ
[11:26] Saints and the living Saints whose body
[11:29] are transformed at the moment of the
[11:31] Rapture that's 1 Thessalonians 4:1
[11:35] 17 and the final proof text of this is
[11:38] Romans 6: 4 and 5 the Bible says if we
[11:41] are buried with him by baptism and if we
[11:43] have been planted together in the
[11:45] likeness of his death we shall also be
[11:46] in the likeness of his resurrection so
[11:48] there it is the promise of
[11:51] resurrection and believers who don't
[11:54] know the message of the hour just think
[11:55] there's one Resurrection but we know
[11:56] there's two resurrections the the first
[11:59] resurrection is the rapture Resurrection
[12:02] as Revelation 20: 1-5 says the second
[12:05] Resurrection is the resurrection unto
[12:07] the white Throne judgment and the second
[12:09] Resurrection is in Revelation 20:
[12:12] 12-15 when the dead small and great
[12:14] stand before God every person that ever
[12:17] lived will be resurrected and receive
[12:19] judgment either eternal life or Eternal
[12:22] damnation in closing friends I hope this
[12:25] video has been a blessing when brother
[12:27] Simon shared this with me I was so
[12:29] blessed this is another example of more
[12:31] Bible information on the same Revelation
[12:34] this is just another proof to me that
[12:36] God is in this message of the hour
[12:38] because all these Bible doctrines
[12:39] brother R gave us from the scripture are
[12:41] typed in the Old Testament the Bible
[12:44] said the law was a shadow the Old
[12:46] Testament was a shadow and we see the
[12:48] reality in Christ Joseph's life was a
[12:51] shadow his two burials show we must
[12:53] repent but then we also must receive the
[12:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost we must be
[12:57] buried in the promise the promise for
[12:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[13:01] Lord Jesus Christ water baptism and
[13:03] before we close I did remember I was
[13:05] reminded that brother Bram gave us a
[13:06] quote and he said thus sayith the Lord
[13:08] you need to be re-baptized in the name
[13:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ if you were
[13:12] previously baptized in titles father son
[13:14] Holy Ghost let's listen to the quote th
[13:17] sayth the Lord amen hallelujah
[13:20] hallelujah huj the baptism using the
[13:22] title of father son Holy Ghost is false
[13:25] amen thus sayith the Lord amen
[13:29] amen
[13:31] amen I command every one of you on here
[13:34] on tape that hasn't been baptized in the
[13:37] name of Jesus Christ be baptized again
[13:42] in the name of Jesus Christ amen Paul in
[13:45] Acts
[13:46] 59 or 195 said have you received the
[13:50] Holy Ghost since you believe and said we
[13:51] know not where it be any Holy Ghost said
[13:53] what was you baptized amen they said
[13:56] we've been baptized but not in Christan
[13:58] Christian baptism Father Son and Holy
[14:01] Ghost is not Christian baptism amen no
[14:04] Christian was ever baptized like that in
[14:07] the Bible amen or for hundreds of years
[14:09] after the Bible it's a Catholic Creed
[14:13] and not a Christian doctrine show me in
[14:15] the Bible
[14:17] amen it's a it's a
[14:20] fraud it's a working of devils amen I
[14:24] don't mean to say the people it's
[14:25] baptized like that are that way God's
[14:27] got a many person out there today that
[14:29] don't know no better but the hour has
[14:33] come amen we've got to get back to the
[14:35] word if we expect God to work in this
[14:37] day like live
[14:38] then so friends this is true God has
[14:41] given us a genuine bible-based Prophet
[14:43] we love brother brandom we love his
[14:45] ministry how he point us back to the
[14:46] word of God he said prove all things he
[14:48] said test me by the word and acts 17
[14:51] says we should search the scriptures
[14:52] daily whether these things be so and the
[14:54] more we search the Bible and brother
[14:56] Ram's quotes the more we know he was a
[14:57] prophet of God
[14:59] if you have any questions concerns or
[15:01] testimonies about this video please
[15:02] contact
[15:03] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[15:07] the desire of your
[15:09] [Music]
[15:10] heart
