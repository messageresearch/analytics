TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show the two mistakes and three additions to the church age book that I found and of course this video is an answer to a viewer's question I had yesterday and also this video is meant as a conversation starter to start looking more deeply at the church age book it's a book I love as I've talked about before and before we look at the two mistakes and at least three additions to the church age book I just want to state five reasons I love the church age book and of course there could be more reasons but first the book is organized by chapter and verse second it's easy to read due to the edited grammar third most of the content is from Brother random's 1960 series on the seven Church ages fourth there are many scriptural citations proving brother Brandon pointed us back to the Bible and then fifth there's numerous sections that address important biblical topics and doctrines like water baptism the godhead serpent seed The Book of Life and many more so here's the first two mistakes that I found and of course there could be more mistakes the first mistake is on page 355 the book says quote now this false church has Zeal make no mistake about that her Zeal has literally been that of the Jews John 2 verse 17 the Zeo of thine house hath eaten me up but it is a wrong Zeal end quote and the reason this is wrong is because John 2 17 is about Jesus's Godly and holy Zeal not the Zeal for creeds Jesus's Zeal was the right Zeal the sinful Zeal of the Jews would be found in Romans 10 verse 2 which says for I bear them record that they have a Zeal of God but not according to knowledge so I believe Lee Vale here cited the wrong verse because John 2 17 speaks of Jesus's holy righteous Zeal and not the wrong zeal the second mistake is found on page 236 this section says quote Satan and his satanic religion are in both of these beasts in Revelation 14 the the Beast that was wounded unto death but lived again is Imperial Pagan Rome that fell to the onslaught of the barbarians and thereby lost her temporal power end quote the reason this is wrong is because Lee Vale wrote down the wrong scripture reference the Beast that was wounded unto death but lived is not in Revelation 14 it's in Revelation Chapter 13 Verse 3. so this is just a wrong scriptural reference by Brother Vale and I'll read Revelation 13 Verse 3 and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the Beast foreign the interruption I'd like to remind our listeners about two resources that that will greatly strengthen your faith according to my humble opinion in 2019 I wrote the book called restoring Christian modesty it's over 120 Pages showing the Bible foundations for a modest and holy appearance it covers all the guidelines for modest clothing and also covers bracelets necklaces Rings earrings nose rings and many more topics one of the most useful parts of this book is the chapter that shows the history of the United States and how they slowly rejected modest clothing and it Chronicles all these changes decade by decade from the 1800s to the present and the second resource is my 2021 book it's an 812 page book about the 12 New Testament Mysteries that brother Branham finished according to Revelation 10 verse 7 brother random said the seventh Church age messenger would finish all these mysteries in the sermon called is this the sign of the answer from December 1962 friends this is an extensive Bible teaching on the major doctrines that brother Brenham gave us proving he was the seventh Church age messenger a genuine prophet of God and the Elijah Prophet to restore all things in a time when so many people are falling away from the message I feel these two resources will strengthen your faith if you want God to draw closer to you you've got to draw closer to him and many times that's through prayer Bible study worship so I know these two resources will be a great help to you they're available on Amazon I'm not a book salesman so if you can't afford them I'll gladly email you the free PDFs you can read them on your phone or tablet or print them off if you like recall acts 17 verse 11 seven the brains were more noble because they searched the Scriptures Daily to prove the things that Paul taught were true and so we must do the same thing today if we're spiritual nobility if we're spiritual royalty in the family of the Lord Jesus Christ the family of King Jesus then we should search the Scriptures Daily to prove brother Brown's teachings were thus saith the word of God thank you for your time now back to the content foreign now let's look at the three additions to the church age book and of course there could be more additions to the church age book that brother Brown never preached but as I said earlier this video is kind of like a conversation starter and I can build the list but again remember I love the church age book there's many wonderful revelations in it but it must be rightly divided because the book is not equal to the Bible just like brother random sermons they must be rightly divided as brother Ram told us prove all things try every Spirit test everything by the word of God every Doctrine must be Genesis to revelation addition number one is that some will enter eternal life solely on the grounds of being good to the Brethren this is found on page 281 I cannot find this statement on brother branham's tapes I hope to do an entire video on this subject I also call it the perhaps Nicodemus and gamalia subject of God possibly granting eternal life to those who were not Christians on the basis they were kind to Christians during their lifetimes there's four Witnesses about this possibility being legitimate the first one is according to brother Ram's Revelation on the fifth seal Jesus will grant the souls under the altar who are blinded Jews eternal life because they kept the testimony of the word of God yet during their lifetimes they never confessed Jesus Christ they were never Christians second in Joshua chapter 9 God granted mercy and forgiveness to the gibeonites because they did not fight against Joshua in Israel God forgave over 440 years of their iniquity in a moment's time because they didn't fight against Israel and remember Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we see him forgiving people in Joshua and then also in the facile the third witness is from a brother random quote from questions and answers 1964. it's from Part Two Brother Branham was asked if people that had been married and divorced and remarried how can both or one of them be in the Rapture brother REM said I don't know he gives the scripture from First Corinthians 6 where adulterers will not inherit the kingdom of heaven but then he says there is places in the Bible he says where there might be a chance of you getting in he cites David eating the shoe bread and also how the priests would blaspheme on the Sabbath by working and yet they're still found blameless brother Graham said a greater than the Sabbath was here a fourth witness of course is Matthew 25 verses 31-46 it's Jesus's story of the white Throne judgment of course the Bride of Jesus Christ the holy ghost-filled Saints will be sitting with Jesus on the Judgment Throne during this time and then the Saints will judge the Earth the Saints will judge the world all people who ever live will come before Jesus Christ and the Saints and Jesus Will separate the sheep from the goats and notice those like the Sheep being saved are surprised at being saved Jesus told them they did six acts of kindness to him but really they did the acts of kindness to Jesus's people and they were surprised at being saved of course any Christian who truly understands the word of God would not be surprised about being saved at the white Throne judgment so this scripture makes it look like people can be saved who are not Christians during their lifetimes just because they were good to Christians but again this is a perhaps statement not a for sure statement just like brother Branham said there might be a chance of you getting in a second edition is Joel 2 verses 23-26 being thus saith the Lord that the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride and that's on page 379 this prophecy is not on the tapes but I see how it fits with Joel 2 verse 28 and Acts chapter 2 with the initial outpouring of the Holy Ghost and then Joel 2 23-26 seems to be the final outpouring of the Holy Ghost before the rapture which brother random calls the latter rain and brothers spoke on this a couple times saying the Dynamics for the Rapture will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost and Friends remember that brother Branham went through at least a couple revisions of the church age book he said that indoors indoor 1965 he said quote and then after he got through sent it back a couple times for more statements which the book is going to press now after about three or four years end quote so it seems brother Brandon would only allow a thus saith the Lord's statement to be in this book if he approved it because he went through it a couple times the Third Edition I found is that the elect cannot persecute the elect that's found on page 359 now two simple Bible examples came to my mind first Saint Paul was elect and yet he persecuted Christians before he was a Christian also King Saul was saved we know he repented right before he died and the prophet Samuel said he would be with him in Abraham's bosom so King Saul was elected to eternal life yet he persecuted David so friends I hope this video has been a good conversation starter I look forward to the comments below and perhaps I'll do another video in the future and Lord willing I'll put these two videos from this week in a podcast hopefully I'll get that out today or tomorrow if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
