Description:
Part 3 of this series covers the Spirit of Elijah and the ministry of William Branham. The Spirit of Elijah has 5 comings according to the Scripture. We believe William Branham was the 4th coming of the Spirit of Elijah, following Elijah, Elisha, and John the Baptist, but preceding the Elijah-witness to Israel, spoken of in Revelation 11. This video ends by showing 4 characteristics of the Spirit of Elijah that were all shared by Elijah, John the Baptist, and William Branham. The 4 characteristics are (1) acted and spoke with "Thus Saith the Lord"; (2) condemned religious, man-made organizations; (3) Condemned immorality in women; and (4) were men of the wilderness.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] the spirit of Elijah God has and will use the spirit of Elijah five times to anoint men or prophets Elijah was the first according to First Kings 17:1 followed by Elisha who had a double portion of Elijah's Spirit according to 2 Kings 29-15 John the Baptist was the third man Anointed with the spirit of Elijah according to Luke 1:17 Malachi 4:5 and6 and Matthew 17: 10-13 We Believe William brandom was the fourth coming of the spirit of Elijah according to Malachi 4:5 and6 Matthew 17:11 Revelation 10:7 and Luke 17:30 we believe the fifth and final man Anointed with the spirit of Elijah will be one of the two witnesses or prophets who prophesied to the Jewish people for 3 and 1/2 years in Revelation 11 the Bible tells us this Elijah Prophet will do one of the same Miracles that the original Elijah performed he will cause it not to rain during the days of his prophecy according to Revelation 11:6 and 1 Kings 17:1 the Elijah Spirit characteristics and William brandham to help us further prove William brandham was the Elijah messenger of today let's look at how two of the previous Elijah anointed men of God behaved Elijah and John the Baptist and let's observe how they were treated so we can see the similarities of how William brandham the Elijah messenger of our day acted for each of these three men were anointed of the same Elijah Spirit characteristic number one acted and spoke with thus sayeth the Lord Elijah and John the Baptist both prophesied and their prophecies came to pass so we see that the spirit of Elijah speaks with thus sayith the Lord and only acts upon thus sayith the Lord straight from God by his Revelation William brandham did the same what other minister Billy Graham or Roberts or modern-day ministers like TD Jakes Benny Hinn or Joel ostein speaks with thus sayith the Lord none that we can find only the prophetic Ministry of William brandham spoke with thus sayeth the Lord Elijah speaking with thus sayeth the Lord First Kings 17:14 for thus sayith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruise of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the Earth John the Baptist acted and spoke with thus sayith the Lord John the Baptist foretold that Jesus Christ would take away the sin of the world and then Christ would also baptize with the Holy Ghost both prophecies came to pass John 1:29 the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world John 1:33 and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost William brandham also acted and spoke with thus sayith the Lord please see our video called three Prophecies of William brandham you will see one prophecy that is already fulfilled the immoral condition of United States churches showing that United States churches would be given over to rock and roll smoking Bob haar and other worldly habits two other prophecies are in the process of being fulfilled no greater Ministry would rise to the Gentiles than the ministry of brother brandham and third no denomination would ever come back to the apostolic teaching of the Bible the second characteristic the spirit of Elijah condemned religious man-made organizations and their leaders these Elijah anointed men of God were set apart from the widely accepted religious schools and organizations of their day and condemn their false Doctrine and man-made systems Elijah and John the Baptist by the spirit of God condemned the leading religious organizations of their day because they would not repent William branam did the same Elijah rebuked Ahab the king of Israel to his face and said his 450 Bale prophets were false prophets First Kings 18:18 and he answered I have not troubled Israel but thou and thy father's house in that ye have forsaken the Commandments of the Lord and thou has followed balum verse 22 then said Elijah unto the people I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord but baal's prophets are 450 men John the Baptist called Pharisees and Sadducees a Generation of Vipers Matthew 3:6 and were baptized of him in Jordan confessing their sins but when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them oh Generation of Vipers who ha warned you to flee from the Wrath to come William brandham condemned the preachers of his day for preaching man-made Creeds and dogmas rather than the true revealed word of God and today I indite this bunch of forain ministers in their Creeds and denominations they're crucifying to the people the very God that they claim that they love and serve amen I indict these ministers in the name of the Lord Jesus upon their doctrine that claim that the days of Miracles is passed and if the water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is not sufficient and not right upon any of these words that they have substituted Creeds for I indict them as guilty in the blood of Jesus Christ upon their hands are crucifying aresh the Lord Jesus the second time they are are crucifying Christ to the public taking from them the thing that they're supposed to be given to them and they substituted something else in its place amen a church Creed for popularity the third characteristic the spirit of Elijah condemned immorality in women Elijah and John the Baptist condemned the rise of immoral women in their day some of which were strong political figures William brandham did the same Elijah condemn the immorality of Jezebel queen of Israel wife of King Ahab First Kings 21:23 and of Jezebel also spake the Lord saying the dog shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel John the Baptist publicly rebuked Herod the ruler of Galilee for his unscriptural second marriage to herodias Luke 3:19 but Herod the tetrarch being reproved by him for herodias his brother Philip's wife and for all the evils which Herod had had done added yet this above all that he shut up John in prison Matthew 14:4 for John said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her William brandham also condemned immorality in women and called out some famous women by name because of their evil influence upon the rest of the nation and especially women old Elijah had bowled out so many those painted faed Jey bells and haircuts and so forth that they were used to that day the old man has spent his life just condemning SE amongst them women and because they had a woman Jezebel there set a past just about like a Hollywood here has and got all the sisters all wound up into it out there and The Jezebel still lives you just look around you can see she does and she's still in great power too yeah don't want you to be influenced by mer Monro I want you to be influenced by Jesus Christ and by his word he is the word if the word don't influence you then Christ came because he is the word you know that of Jaclyn Kennedy she did set the P pace of women all these Waterhead haircuts and things that they have all these sexy dresses like motherhood dresses and things every woman in the country wants wear new Pentecostals too look jacqulyn Kennedy never did hear a message like this if she would have heard it she might have repented long ago but you Pentecostal women you're Ding and out year and out and still you knew nothing about [Music] it the fourth characteristic men anointed with the spirit of Elijah were men of the Wilderness Elijah and John the Baptist were men of the Wilderness so was William Brandon Elijah was from Gilead a mountainous region near River Jordan he spent time at the brook cherith with Ravens later at the threat of Jezebel he went into the Wilderness rested under a juniper tree and spent time alone in a cave hearing the voice of God John the Baptist dwelt in the wilderness until the day his ministry was shown to Israel according to Luke 1 180 the word of God God came to him in the wilderness according to Luke 3:2 John also baptized in the wilderness wore camel's hair and ate Locust and honey according to Mark 1: 4-6 William brandham spent much of his free time in the woods in nature hunting and also communing with God and my Nature's always been to the woods I was born in the wood and I just seem like it's raised up there even my conversion never took it out of me not so much to get the game but just in the woods I think God is there to see him how he moves went back and the next day I went up to my cave where I go to pray way away God gave me that cave that's the place I go to pray in there is a Altar and everything I never touched one thing it was just that way when I found it long ago you see it ain't honey Dre I want to baptize this guy never preacher goes with me this time in the name of Jesus Hallelujah pray for me which I know is true makes my heart hunger and thirst to see God [Music]
