TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Now you say, "How could he be God and be man?" See, there's the mystery. See, in body he was man, in spirit he was God. Someone asked me said, "Then how did who did he pray to in the garden of Gethsemane?" Greetings, friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about the Godhead. The question was, trinitarians often use Jesus's high priestly prayer in John 17 to prove the Trinity. So, does John 17 prove the Trinity? The answer is no. There's not two separate persons talking there. And I know that's mysterious, but the Bible calls the Godhead a mystery in Colossians 2:2. It's not two persons talking in John 17. It's the humanity of Jesus praying to the deity of Jesus. The deity of God can be in heaven and earth at the same time. The deity of God is limitless, infinite, eternal, and God can be in as many persons as he wants, as he proved on the day of Pentecost, 120 licks of fire. God was both in those licks of fire and in the souls of the Holy Ghost fil believers. So that's 240 manifestations right there on the day of Pentecost. So the one great invisible eternal infinite person of God could be in Jesus as he prayed in John 17 and also in heaven. And so this video will help to answer that question by the grace of God. Let's start with some Bible foundation here. Colossians 2:2 calls the Godhead a mystery. The Bible says to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ. So notice Paul doesn't identify the Holy Spirit because to Paul the Holy Spirit was not a third person of a so-called trinity. The word trinity is not in the Bible. It was coined by Theophilles around 180 AD and then Tertullian shortly thereafter. So think of that friends. The word trinity is not in the Bible and it didn't come into usage until about 80 years after the last Bible author St. John had passed away. That proves it's an addition to the Bible and the Bible authors which some people call the giants of the faith. The giants of the faith so-called never chose to use the word trinity. Therefore, Holy Ghost fil believers won't use that word. Now, as I put on a recent video, we might say the trinity of manifestations, the trinity of offices, trinity of attributes, but it is not a trinity of persons. A trinity of persons makes tritheism or the worship of three separate co-equal distinct persons or gods and that's heathenism. So real holy ghost fil Christians are not heathens and they won't accept any addition to the word of God. Let's go to the high priestly prayer of Jesus. We're not going to read all this but I'm going to hit the highlights here from John 17. The main verse trinitarians try to use to prove the trinity is verse 5. And now, oh father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee, before the world was. So before the world came into existence, the son was with the father in glory. And then we also see the use of plural pronouns later on in this chapter down in verse 22. And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them that they may be one even as we are one. So trinitarians try to use the argument that Jesus used plural pronouns like we, us, and our and that proves three persons. That does not prove three persons as we'll get to here by God's grace. Another one is John 14:23 which says, "If a man love me, he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him." And of course, this is speaking of the Holy Ghost because God the Father is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is the spirit of the Son. So the Holy Ghost, Christ in you, the hope of glory. That's the baptism of the Holy Ghost according to Colossians 1 26 27 and 28. And notice it's Christ. Christ is the anointing. Christ is the logos. Christ is the son. So that is the abode of the father and son. The baptism of the Holy Ghost dwelling in the believer's soul. Just real quick, I want to review the eight problems with the Trinity Dogma. I wrote about this in my 2021 book, pages 23 to 32. The first problem is the Trinity Dogma adds to the Bible. The second problem is Jesus and his apostles taught and affirmed pure monotheism rather than trinitarianism. The third proof is the Aanian creed or sixth century trinitarian confessional contains multiple contradictions to biblical teaching on the godhead and there are six examples in my book. The fourth problem is major Bible contradictions and inconsistencies exist among trinitarians. They can't even agree on what they believe. Fifth, the early trinitarians did not affirm the Holy Spirit was divine until the council of Constantinople in 381 AD. Six, trinitarian images and artwork are often deceptive, creating false representations of the godhead. Seventh, some Trinitarians use two fear tactics to persuade others to believe in the Trinity, heresy, and hell. Eighth, and finally, God send a prophet named William Brandham to warn Christians about the false trinity doctrine with thus sayith the Lord. Next, for a good understanding on the Godhead, I would recommend people listening to the sermon from brother Brandham from 1953, questions and answers on Genesis, July 29th. And if you just type in these words into the table app, you can start listening to it right at paragraph 23. Oh, I got a beautiful picture in my mind now. If you could take a little trip with me. And then he talks about how a visible light came out of the invisible God, which we're going to go over today. But that's a great sermon if you want to listen to Brother explain it. Also, I wrote about the Godhead in my 2021 book. It's chapter one after the introduction chapter. So, it's the second chapter into the book, but it's called chapter 1 because I didn't name the introduction as chapter 1. So, let's give some visuals here and a scriptural answer about John 17. Again, in order to understand John 17, you got to go back to the beginning. In the beginning was just the invisible father. Notice there's nothing on the screen other than those words. And then you move on to this visual. Brother Ram tells us and the Bible's clear about it as well. Out of the invisible father came a visible spiritual image of God. And now that something came out of God, now God's a father and now he has a son. The son is also called the logos or the word. And this son, logos, or word has numerous attributes. Here's just six attributes. Again, it's the logos of the word. This is a manifestation of the invisible God. This is the anointing of God. This is the theophony of God because it's a spirit body. This is the son of God because he came out of the father. And this is a visible form of the Holy Spirit in the spiritual realm, a celestial body. So here's the next visual. Now I have three steps which actually could be about four steps as you'll see at the end. But here's a visual to help explain this. First you had the invisible father. He has never been seen and never can be seen at any time in the future. It's according to John 1:18, 1 Timothy 1:17, and 1 Timothy 6:16. No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten son, which is in the bosom of the father. He hath declared him. Now unto the king, eternal, immortal, invisible. That's the key word there, invisible. The only wise God be glory, be honor, and glory forever and ever. Amen. And this scripture is key. 1 Timothy 6:16, who only hath immortality. So only one person has immortality. That's God. God dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto. Whom no man hath seen nor can see. To whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen. So notice God dwells in the light. So if we go back to our visual here, this light, this amber light, this yellowish green amber light, the invisible father dwells inside of that light. But the manifestation of it is called the sun or the word or the logos. And this is what Jesus was talking about in John 17. This is the glory they shared before the foundation of the world. Because when this sun logos or word came into creation because Jesus is the beginning of the creation of God, this manifestation was a creation. There were no planets. There were no stars. There was no universe yet. God's first creation was a manifestation of himself, the word. Now, God used this logos to create all things according to numerous Bible verses to prove this. Let's go to Ephesians 3:9. The Bible said, "To make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ." So, God first created a manifestation of himself. that was his son. And then through that word logos or through his son he created all things. We also see this in Colossians 1:15 who is the image of the invisible God. So the son the logos the word is the visible image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature. So that proves right there that the logos was the first creature created. As Revelation said Jesus is the beginning of the creation of God. Verse 16. For by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created by him and for him. Notice, all things were created by the Son, Jesus. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. Verse 19. And it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell. So God put all of his power, all of his authority in his son, the word, the logos. And then Colossians 2:9 again repeats this fullness of the Godhead truth. For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Now we can understand Genesis 1:26. And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea." And so forth. But the phrase, "Let us" does not prove two persons. It's God speaking through the logos. God speaking through the word. God speaking through his son. So friends, this light, this logos, this pillar of fire, we'd say, has to have its own noun because it's a thing. It's a manifestation. It's the same person, but it's two manifestations, but it's a living manifestation. Another great scripture is John 1 1, 2, and 3. In the beginning was the word or logos and the word was with God and the word was God. See because God created that visible light and then God lived in that light. God dwells in that light. According to 1 Timothy 6:16, the same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. Again, God used his word, his son, the logos, to create all things. And another beautiful scripture, Proverbs 8:12 speaks of wisdom, which is the spirit of God before the foundation of the world. I wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty inventions. If you skip down to verses 22 through31, we find what wisdom did before the foundation of the world. In other words, wisdom is the logos. Wisdom is the word. Wisdom is the son of God. The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting from the beginning orever the earth was. When there were no depths, I was brought forth. When there were no fountains abounding with water, before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth. While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. When he prepared the heavens, I was there. When he set up a compass upon the face of the depth, when he established the clouds above, when he strengthened the fountains of the deep. when he gave to the sea his decree that the wat should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth. Then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delights were with the sons of men. As a side note I use Proverbs 8:30 when I preached the dancing series. The Bible said the logos was rejoicing always before him. And one of those definitions is to play, which means instrumental music, singing and dancing. And that's how brother Brandham described it as well, the son playing before the father. And now the Bible teaches us that the logos went out of God or I might say all of the the God become in his first body form. When the logos went out of God, let's look what it looked like. No one has seen the father at any time. Nowhere. Never did and never will. But then the log go that went out of him become like a little halo of light. Let's see it playing yonder like a child before the doorstep of the father. And now I can see him as he moves over here and he draws into his his memory or his mind a picture of what the world should be. Now he's not a star or nothing. Now by God's grace the next step is the word becoming flesh. John 1 verse14. So this nature of the logos was made into a flesh body. The nature of it. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. So the logos became flesh. In other words, the logos created a human body to come dwell in. Of course, that anointing came at the river Jordan when Jesus was baptized. And next, just like the logos, the body of Jesus was a manifestation of God. 1 Timothy 3:16, for God was manifest in the flesh. The word manifestation also means appearing. God appeared in the flesh. Or we might call it a veiling. God was veiled in the flesh. And then after Jesus died, he rose again. He was given a glorified body according to John 7:39 and John 12:16. So now here's a visual of plural pronouns. Jesus uses we, us, our. That's because the spirit that was in Jesus was with the father before the foundation of the world. And this is the last remaining mystery of the godhead. Why does the father and son use plural pronouns? Remember friends, I was talking with a uh trinitarian preacher recently and I said with trinitarians I can start with your three persons and easily take it down to two because the father and the holy ghost are the self-same person. Jesus was conceived of the holy ghost yet he prayed to the heavenly father. So if you make the father and the holy ghost two separate persons then Jesus has two fathers and that's a lie. That's nonsense. So the father and the holy ghost are the self-same person. Jesus said in John 4 that God is a spirit and then called his father. He prayed to his father and called him holy father. So he's a holy father spirit. God is a spirit. God's a holy spirit. So the father and the holy ghost are not two separate persons. They are one person. They're the same spirit. So now I told the trinitarian man recently I was talking to now you're down to two persons and I said I can show you in the Bible where Jesus said he is the I am that met Abraham and Philip asked Jesus in John 14 show us the father and he said have I been so long with you yet thou has not known me Philillip. So that takes your two persons and brings it down to one and the only remaining mystery is with the plural pronouns. I have this on pages 37 through 40 of my 2021 book if you'd like to read more about this. Now, just to summarize, the best biblical answer is that Jesus had to use plural pronouns because he was both fully human and fully divine. Yet, his human side was not divine. Therefore, Jesus had to use a separate pronoun for himself because he was mortal unlike the immortal father. Remember friends, Jesus even said the father is greater than I. Jesus was referring to his flesh body. His flesh body was not God, the invisible spirit. His flesh body had a word nature and his flesh body was sinless like God. But his flesh body could die. Whereas God, the father, the invisible almighty spirit could never die. So I wrote Jesus experienced temptation in his human will or his human side. But the father cannot be tempted. Jesus died, but the father can never die. Jesus is a human, but the father is an eternal spirit. Consequently, a separate pronoun was needed for Jesus's body. Yet, he was not a co-equal distinct person from the father. He was the express image of the father according to Hebrews 1:3. That word express image means a faximile or an exact reproduction and that's the nature. And Jesus had the exact nature of the father. But his flesh body did not have the divine quality until after the resurrection. Then his body became glorified. So using plural pronouns like we, us, our is both scriptural and so much safer, reverent, and ultimately pleasing to God compared to the sin of adding uninspired words to God's eternal, inspired, inherent word. Like Proverbs 30:5 and 6 says, God's going to call people liars who add to the word of God. And like I told my friend that I debated on the Trinity. He's a Trinitarian pastor. I said, 'Look at the fruits of the Trinity. It came out, of course, before the Catholic Church officially denominated, but it's been one of their main doctrines throughout the history of the Catholic Church. And look at all the clergy abuse, scandals, both with clergy, priests, and with nuns. It's undeniable, friends. Any false doctrine, any addition to the word of God is leaven. If it's not cleaned out, it's only going to grow. and look at the extreme amount of false doctrines in the Roman Catholic Church. I have multiple videos about that if you'd like to watch that. I wrote a chapter about that in my 2021 book. Most Bible reformers believed the Roman Catholic Church was the mother harla of Revelation 17 and 18. And they believe the Pope would be the future antichrist. So the we, us, our is one person but one person with a living manifestation. Because remember friends, a noun is a person, place or thing. And the logos and even Jesus' human body were not a separate person, but they were a manifestation which is a thing. And God dwelt in that manifestation. So when you have more than one noun, you have to use plural pronouns like we, us, our. In closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. I'll share that in the final discussion I had with this trinitarian pastor. It boiled down to this. Both of us said we believed everything in the word of God. But it boiled down to this. He was adding to the word of God. And I said, "My dear precious friend, I don't want to be guilty of adding to the word of God. And the way you're going right now, you're adding to the word of God. So you need to be careful with that." And that's how I left it by the grace of God. But even in that impromptu debate we had sitting at a dinner table for about an hour, I didn't know it was going to happen. And it was kind of surprising and quite enjoyable because I don't often get to debate about the Godhead. I could answer all of his questions, but he couldn't answer my questions. And here's one example. I said, "Here's why the Trinity is so illogical. Why did Jesus need to be filled with two other persons?" I said, "Because your Trinity dogma says Jesus and the Holy Ghost and the Father are co-equal, co-eternal persons." So why does the Bible say in John 14:10 that the father dwelt in Jesus? Why would Jesus need a second person to come and dwell in him when he's already co-equal with that person? See how this is a total contradiction? See how it actually sets up tritheism. And then Luke 4:1 says Jesus was full of the Holy Ghost. John 1:30 through33 shows how the spirit of God descended and then remained on Jesus. So the Holy Ghost came to dwell in Jesus. So now according to trinitarians, Jesus has two co-equal, co-eternal, all powerful other persons dwelling in his person. That's illogical. That's nonsense. Any honest person would not accept that false teaching. But that's what trinitarians have to accept according to their own creeds, their own definitions. And so the trinitarian preacher could not answer that along with my other questions. Did Jesus have two fathers? He couldn't answer that. He couldn't answer why he believed in adding to the word of God. the words trinity, three persons. So friends, we're in a much safer space by just believing the word of God, the Godhead is a mystery. But if you look at all these scriptures and visuals we had on this video, it should be plain that God is one person and that Jesus' flesh was praying to the spirit that was both inside him and also in heaven. Now you say, "How could he be God and be man?" See, there's the mystery. See, in body he was man. In spirit he was God. Someone asked me said, "Then how do who did he pray to in the garden of Gethsemane?" I said, "I'll answer you that when you answer this. Do you believe you have the Holy Ghost?" "Yes." I said, "Then who do you pray to? Where's he at when you're praying to him?" When you claim you have him and yet you're praying to him. See, people just they just get some little idea and run wild with it. You see, that's the way it goes. Now, in spirit, he was God. Jesus said in St. John 3, see, when the son of man which now is in heaven is standing here on earth, when the son of man which now is in heaven, how would you answer that? See, he said he was in heaven and here he was standing on earth. Oh my. You see that he had to be God ominate present. Sure he's present everywhere. He knows every thought by being omnant mission knowing all things he can be ominate present. See and that's what brother Ram said that's what happens with us as well. God is both in us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We the Bible says we have a measure of the Holy Ghost in us. A measure of the eternal God. And yet we look up to heaven and pray to the eternal father almighty God because God is both in us and above us. Now, we're not equal to Jesus. Jesus had the fullness of the Godhead. Jesus had the Holy Ghost without measure according to the book of John. We have it with measure. So, we're not making ourselves equal to Jesus by any means at all. We are sinners saved by grace. Jesus never sinned. Jesus is the masterpiece of God. Jesus is God's own son. So, hopefully this was helpful by the grace of God. Excellent question. So, I appreciate that brother reaching out. Appreciate his patience as well. Thank God for the revelation of the Godhead. Thank God that we know we can have confidence when we go before God. We can say we never added to the word of God. We never took away from the word of God. We believed everything that God said about himself in his holy Bible. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He has never failed. [Music]
