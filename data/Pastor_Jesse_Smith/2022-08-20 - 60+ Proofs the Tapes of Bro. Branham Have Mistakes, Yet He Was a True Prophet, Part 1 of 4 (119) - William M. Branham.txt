In Part 1, 21 out of 64 examples are shown that NOT every word Brother William Branham was infallible, or "Thus saith the Lord." The Tape Church movement, headquartered in Jeffersonville, Indiana, falsely claims to believe every word on the tapes of Brother Branham was "Thus saith the Lord," and they are guilty of idolizing both Brother Branham and his tapes. Please pray for their repentance.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] other day i got something mixed up i have to hear it yes i called it right there and it's on the tape if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the bible you see greetings friends in the mattress name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to prove that the tapes of god's prophet brother william branham are not infallible as the leadership at branham tabernacle declares and of course they're wrong friends i rejoice in the tapes because the tapes contain many scriptural truths and the tapes point me to the absolute which is the word of god and of course the absolute is a person as well it's jesus christ and the bible is the absolute in written form but jesus christ is the absolute in a person in the spiritual form friends i believe brother branham is a genuine prophet of god as i have over 100 youtube videos that teach that along with two books i've written along with 18 years of preaching the bible revelations that god showed to his prophet brother branham for those of us who believe god sent brother branham as a genuine prophet of god we are trying to stand in the middle of the road right now as there are two erroneous extremes around those who claim to follow brother graham's message one extreme is the branham tabernacle and the tape church movement and essentially they worship the tapes and exalt the tapes to infallibility it's my humble opinion they also worship brother branham as well which is of course an awful sin the sin of idolatry the other extreme is the group that denies brother branham as a genuine prophet of god some of these have left his bible teachings and so as true believers of the bible we're standing in the middle and we believe brother branham was a genuine prophet of god but we do not worship him nor do we exalt the tapes to infallibility and again i want to apologize if there's any distracting noises while i'm recording this video i'm recording it at home of course and sometimes the air conditioner will turn on and sometimes my children are running around upstairs or playing you might hear them as well but of course parents will understand that this subject is so important that i may make another podcast about it as well and add the audio from this youtube video into the podcast and then add additional thoughts to the podcast lord willing so this video is focused on defending the bible truth against those who exalt the tapes to infallibility and i humbly say this veto defends against those who worship the tapes and those who worship brother branham and of course they worship brother branham by saying every word on his tape was thus saith the lord if every word brother branham said on tape was thus saith the lord then brother random is equal to the lord but of course we know that's wrong that's a false teaching here's the outline for the video first we'll look at seven obvious proofs not every word was thus saith the lord second we'll look at seven types of human mistakes brother branham made next we'll look at correcting false beliefs about the tapes fourth we'll look at 60 plus honest mistakes on the tapes of brother branham and we'll close with a plea for tape worshipers to repent seven obvious proofs not every word on tape is thus saith the lord i'm going to try to go through these quickly friends as some of these topics i've covered in previous youtube videos but the first reason is brother branham said in certain cases he would say this is not from the lord or this is not thus saith the lord he would repeat phrases that were telling us it was just his opinion or he has nothing on it from the lord one example is from 1951 the angel lord brother ram said quote now this is not the lord speaking this is your brother brother branham end quote so the numerous quotes like these prove not every word was thus saith the lord because brother am specifically said it wasn't thus saith the lord and if branham tabernacle says every word on the tape is thus saith the lord yet brother ram says it's not thus saith the lord then they do not believe brother branham which is obviously the case and it's always been that case they say they believe brother branham but brother branham said your actions prove you don't these people claim to believe every word that you say to be true but they don't they don't believe it their own actions prove that they don't proof number two brother ram said there are mix-ups on the tapes in questions and answers part 1 1964 brother branham said quote like the other day i got something mixed up i happen to hear and it's i caught it right there and it's on the tape and i'll probably hear from it but if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the bible end quote i love this quote because brother branham admits the tapes have mistakes but he gives us these four beautiful words look in the bible that's what the holy ghost was given for to point us to truth to guide us into all truth as jesus christ said in the book of saint john god's word has no mix-ups but the tapes have mix-ups according to brother branham so brother ram's tapes cannot be equal to the bible they cannot be infallible third brother random said he made those kind of mistakes all the time on the tapes like mixing up numbers for example in questions and answers on the seals 1963 they asked brother branham quote did you mean to say 7 000 who had not bowed their knee to balaam or 700 end quote of course you're probably familiar with this brother random said 700 instead of 7 000 and the people asked him about it and brother branham apologized he said quote seven thousand i meant to say forgive me for that end quote and then brother graham said he made these mistakes all the time so from the context we know he misquoted scriptures or misspoke numbers many times on the tapes brother ram said quote i just said 700 instead of 7 000 i make them mistakes all the time end quote so if brother branham is telling the truth here then all the time there's going to be mix-ups on the tapes when brother iran was trying to cite a verse or remember a certain number from the bible and we find that to be the case as this video will show with over 60 proofs of brother adam's honest mistakes on the tapes and of course there could be more mistakes on the tapes fourth brother random said his words will fail not might fail and we know god's word can never fail brother rahm said this in 1950 expectation quote i believe that we must read the word of god each service see my words will fail as all mortals but god's word cannot fail it's forever lasting true end quote so there's many quotes like this brother branham differentiates his words from the word of god brother rams human words will fail but god's words can never fail fifth brother adam defined thus saith the lord as having no mistakes as he did in this quote from 1961 expectation and obviously as we've already seen he admitted to making mistakes on the tapes but in this quote brother ram said quote there's where you must solemnly base your faith on thus saith the lord and now god being infinite and cannot make a mistake and he's perfect therefore all of his all of his promises must be perfect as he is perfect end quote so god cannot make a mistake so if the tapes have mix-ups or mistakes then god did not speak every word that's on the tapes and that's the truth that's what brother brahm taught and that's what we believe six brother ram said to make him infallible was one of the awfulest things you could do he said this in the key to the door 1962 quote they claim in here that some brethren up there that said that i sent them up there and they're preaching that men should leave their wives and hunt for their spiritual mate and that that i am perfectly infallible that there's nothing and oh some of the awfulest things you ever heard end quote friends it is one of the most awful things to say brother branham was infallible and that's exactly what branham tabernacle is doing it's an awful spiritual state to be in so as i said we'll pray for them at the end of this video and the seventh proof is what you're going to see later on this video i'm going to show over 60 proofs of brother brahms human mistakes on his tapes that prove he was not infallible and not every word on the tapes are thus saith the lord seven types of human mistakes brother branham made now of course there could be more kinds of human mistakes brother adam could make on the tapes but this is what i found so far and of course i still believe brother branham was a genuine prophet of god all prophets of god make mistakes in their own human nature in their own human mind but when a prophet speaks thus saith the lord that cannot be a mistake that cannot fail because it's god's word and of course not every word brother brahm said was thus saith the lord so the first type of mistake is what he calls a slip of the tongue there's numerous examples of this as you'll see later on but one example is brother branham said rebecca met her bride now if that's true rebecca met another woman to marry which we know would be an abomination or as rebecca rolled the camel and jumped off the camel right between the house of abraham out in the field she met her brine oh god in the church will meet our bride in the air for we wish alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep brother ram said this on numerous occasions rebecca went to her bride of course later he would say it right rebecca met her bride groom but we can't deny what the tapes say there are times when brother graham said rebecca met her bride so this is just the slip of the tongue brother and meant to say bridegroom the second kind of human mistake is a misquote from the scripture for example for the rapture brother branham cited 2 chapter 4. of course friends there is no second thessalonians chapter 4. and the second is fulfilled in second thessalonians the fourth chapter let's just take a read we just read a few minutes ago see i would not have you either brother concerning those asleep some people may want to think that there is but then brother branham would be adding to the word of god and no man can add to the word or take away from the word without awful repercussions third sometimes brother branham was forgetful like all humans and this is easily seen in different stories that he tells sometimes he forgets the details for example in the man from windsor the story changes numerous times but that doesn't stumble us because we know brother ram's a human and he's forgetful the main point of the story is that god was protecting his prophet and the power of jesus christ is eternally greater than the power of satan fourth a mistake is that brother branham is fallible and he doesn't know all things so for example in one quote brother bram said the human body is made up of 80 percent water and petroleum the body's got to have the water in order to stay alive you're 80 something percent uh water petroleum anyhow and you've got to take these sources in to keep you alive but friends any study on petroleum will tell you petroleum is extremely toxic to any living thing friends petroleum is a liquid mixture that is refined to produce fuels like gasoline kerosene and diesel oil so in other words there's no gasoline or kerosene or diesel in the human body and so there's no petroleum in the human body and if it's injected to the human body there's awful things that take place the nervous system is affected it's also known to be a carcinogen as well a fifth type of human mistake is just a human opinion or prediction one example is like 1977 brother branham said total annihilation would come to the world by 1977 and of course we know that did not happen also brother branham's opinion about martin luther king jr leading millions into a hitler-like death trap that did not happen either a sixth type of mistake is brother ramsey's own dishonesty as he told us about his lie to the irs and so we clearly see a human lie cannot be thus saith the lord because god does not lie the scripture says and a seventh type of human mistake is exaggerations for example brother ram changes the number of people that were at the 1933 ohio river baptism and there's numerous quotes from brother branham where he admits that he exaggerates at times such as in the second miracle 1951 he said quote may god help me not not to exaggerate but just be as honest as i believe from my heart end quote and also straight as the gate 1959 brother ram said quote i'm not very good at making a or estimating crowds because i usually exaggerate on it end quote correcting false beliefs about the tapes i'm going to go through four false beliefs i often hear about the tapes that are wrong and try to bring correction to them first people say you cannot correct a prophet and you cannot judge a prophet so there are no exceptions according to these people now of course some of them are getting this quote from the rapture in 1965 but they're misunderstanding the quote brother ram said quote but nobody set before a prophet because he was he was absolutely the word of god end quote so if you cannot correct a prophet the prophet is infallible he's equal to god and if you cannot correct a prophet then peter was not a prophet but we know he was because paul corrected peter in galatians chapter 2. peter would not have fellowship with the gentiles because he was fearful of the jewish teachers and so he would not eat with the gentiles but paul corrected him to his face and friend anyone knows peter was a prophet he prophesied in second peter chapter 3 about the day of the lord and the fervent heat that would consume the earth and even brother branham called peter a prophet in 1961 god being misunderstood quote then god had a prophet there who could stand up and speak peter said you men of jerusalem and you that dwell in judea don't misunderstand this end quote so if you believe a prophet cannot be corrected then you're making brother rams own words contradict themselves because brother ram said peter was a prophet and yet he was corrected by paul if you cannot correct a prophet then you would have to come to the conclusion that brother brahm lied or was deceived numerous times when he said he was corrected by his wife brother sherrod and other people and of course i have an entire video about this topic if you'd like to watch that please contact me it's on my youtube channel friends even saint paul was wrong in his human mind at times for he did not know he was addressing the high priest in acts 23 verses one through five so if you say a prophet can never be corrected you're contradicting acts 23 verses one through five friends some people are so delusional they said you don't even need to check a genuine prophet of god that's completely contrary to the scripture first thessalonians 5 says prove all things brother graham said test me by the word brotherham said we must prove all things by the scripture and acts 17 verse 11 records the holy spirit saying the bereans were more noble than the thessalonicans because they searched the scriptures daily to find out whether the things paul said were correct or not so the holy spirit gives a spiritual attribute of royalty to those people who will take what the prophet said and make sure it was right every day by searching the scriptures remember friends brother ram said his wife was his correction you can look that quote up quote my wife she's my correction end quote also there's a quote from be not afraid 1961 where brother graham's wife admitted brother branham could be wrong on so many things brother ram said quote my wife she said you can say so many things wrong and that's right she sure is right on that end quote so brother adam even admits he can say so many things wrong and yet branham tabernacle will say every word is right every word is thus saith the lord in the sermon the god who's rich in mercy 1965 brother branham noted that there were theologians sitting behind him and he said quote maybe they will correct me when i'm wrong i hope so end quote so friends here's a true prophet of god brother branham hoping the theologians would correct him when he's wrong brother was not lying he was humble he knew he was a human he made regular human mistakes like all of us and he hoped to be corrected that's the same thing i desire or any other preacher we're going to make human mistakes so we want to be corrected when we're wrong friends if brother adam gave no specific or clear explanation of why he changed the teaching then you'd have to assume both opposing statements were true since they can only say what's on the tapes and cannot correct a prophet and this would lead to many misunderstandings for example the white horse rider in 1960 and 1961 brother brahm said it was the holy ghost and then in 1963 he said it's the antichrist spirit so if you believe every word is thus saith the lord then that one symbol has two meanings it's the antichrist sometimes that's the holy ghost sometimes friends people who believe this are tossed back and forth just like ephesians 4 says they're not sitting under the holy ghost filled five full ministry so they're tossed by every wind of doctrine and of course the truth is the white horse rider was the antichrist spirit because brother ram taught that with us saith the lord and the four horse riders were combating the four beasts so the four forms of the antichrist were battling the four forms of the holy ghost friends some of these people who say you cannot correct or judge a prophet are contradicting themselves because they say you can't judge a prophet and yet then they say brother ram grew in revelation if brother ram didn't say he grew in revelation on a certain specific topic then you can't assume it and you can't correct it so again when people make these false statements they're contradicting themselves i've witnessed preachers say this they say you cannot correct a prophet but then they'll only preach one side of a subject when brother branham has two different opinions on the same subject like the promised land what did israel take in the promised land represent in one case brother graham said it typed the baptism of the holy ghost but in more quotes he said it typed the millennium well which one's right the only one that makes sense because there was wars and death and fighting in the promised land is that the promised land types the baptism of the holy ghost there be no wars or killings or any of that during the millennium because it's a time of a thousand years of peace second you can correct brother branham but not on doctrine so doctrine is the only exception now of course this is wrong because paul corrected peter who was a prophet on doctrine in galatians chapter 2. also brother cheryl corrected brother branham on his doctrine of receiving gifts at first brother branham would not receive gifts he taught the people that but then after brother showed him some scriptures about how other people can be blessed with heavenly rewards if he received their gifts brother ham changed his ways a third false belief is that brother random had vindicated opinions i heard a preacher say this online he was talking about men wearing shorts and said brother ram's opinion was that men should not wear shorts and this brother said i'll take brother ram's opinion because his opinions are vindicated well this is wrong in two ways human opinions are never vindicated as absolute truths because they're not thus saith the lord when there's room for human opinion that's called a christian liberty and saint paul talks about that i wrote about that in my 2019 book about restoring christian modesty and the different christian liberties that we have and second the preacher didn't realize that it's actually a bible doctrine that men and women should not wear shorts because we can prove from the book of isaiah that exposing the thigh is nakedness so that is a bible doctrine so the brother didn't understand that modesty is a bible doctrine and called it an opinion so of course the preacher was wrong and just to back this up brother braham said his opinion was like anyone else's like in marriage in divorce 1965 quote it can't be my own opinion because my opinion is just like anybody else's end quote also brother brown was open to anyone correcting him even the janitor by the scripture in church order 1963 brother ram said quote i don't care if you're one of the trustees or or if you're the janitor whoever you are your duty bound to me as a brother in christ to tell me when i'm wrong scripturally if there's a question let's sit down and solve it out together end quote so brother ram never exalted himself above the trustees or the janitor he was a humble holy ghost-filled christian like all of us should be and he recognized that his opinions were no better than anybody else's remember friends in the sermon he cares do you care in 1963 regarding the martin luther king jr prophecy brother ram said he had nothing on it from the lord he said he could be altogether wrong in his thought about martin luther king jr he said quote i don't know i can't say that's just my opinion end quote so again there's no such thing as a vindicated opinion there is such a thing as the vindicated word of god because that's spoken with thus saith the lord but human opinions fall under the area of christian liberties and fourth and finally a false statement is you should only say what the tapes say friends people that say you should only say what the tapes say are contradicting themselves and you could use many examples again with the white horse rider in 1977 but one i found recently is with the sixth major vision preachers will say say what the tapes say but then they won't agree with the other numerous quotes about the sixth vision such as when brother ram said the sixth vision was not a woman but a church and yet they'll say the sixth vision was fulfilled by a woman kamala harris why aren't they saying what the tapes say when the tapes say the sixth vision is not a woman a few other examples are the tapes say billy paul was the promised joseph in 1951. why don't they call billy paul the promise joseph and not joseph branham why aren't they saying what the tapes say the tapes say arizona could not have another generation due to the high birth rates of mental retardation and the tapes say the entire world would be annihilated by 1977 and of course we know that wasn't the case so the people who say say what the tapes say are not saying what the tapes say they're only picking and choosing what they want to say about what's on the tapes 60 plus proofs not every word on brethren's tapes was thus saith the lord friends by god's grace i'll go year by year and i'll show brother graham's quotes that again show not every word was thus saith the lord so beginning in 1951 believe us thou this brother ram said quote my joseph was right with me when and i didn't know it the little baby that i thought would be joseph is a little girl and i called her sarah end quote so here brother random calls billy paul as promised joseph but joseph was born four years later in 1955. so what is the truth the truth is brother branham was assuming billy paul was his promise joseph because he hadn't had him yet and the truth was brother bran was wrong his promise joseph would come four years later second from 1951 believers thou this same sermon brother ram said quote and maybe my little boy would fully be a prophet sent from god i pray to that end quote so brother ram prayed for billy paul to be a full prophet now of course this was not thus saith the lord because eight years later and let us see god 1959 brother ram said quote but he seems like he doesn't have a call to be a preacher end quote so billy paul is not a full prophet let alone even a preacher so what's the truth behind this prayer from 1951 it was just brother graham's human desire his fatherly desire of course it was wrong billy paul never became a full prophet moving to 1952 in february believing god brother branham said quote prayer it even changes everything it will change the mind of god end quote so here brother rahm said you can change god's mind but later in numerous occasions brother ram said god can never change his mind about anything in the sermon 1965 does god ever change his mind about his word brother braham said quote god never changes his mind about anything end quote then later he says quote he will let you go his permissive will but he won't change his mind he won't change his plan he won't change his word for you no sir you've got to change end quote so what's the truth the truth is prayer cannot change the mind of god brother later said prayer was to change our minds to the perfect will of god now of course brother brown was speaking of hezekiah when he said there in 1952 that prayer can change the mind of god but if we look at that case honestly hezekiah was praying for the permissive will of god and god gave it to him and brother of course recognized that later so god didn't change his mind but god gave hezekiah the permissible of god just like he gave balaam the permissive will of god next in early spiritual experiences 1952 brother branham said the third person of the trinity burned in his heart and he loved him quote we love him that great third person of the trinity who burns through our hearts and we love him end quote nine years later brother graham said trinitarianism is of the devil he said quote trinitarianism is of the devil i say that with thus saith the lord end quote so what is the truth the truth is there is no third person of the trinity as brother ram gave us thus saith the lord on this topic and so brother ram grew in his understanding brother iran changed his doctrine he was a trinitarian but then he moved to a bible-believing one-person godhead believer moving on to 1953 in march brother ram said the promised land typed the millennium quote and the fourth was when they went into the promised land which was the millennium end quote seven years later in adoption part one brother branham said the promised land did not represent the millennium quote now canaan does not represent the age of the millennium it only represents the age of the overcomer the dispensation of overcoming because in canaan they killed and burned and took cities and there'll be no death in the millennium end quote so which one is the truth the truth is the one from adoption 1960 where byram said canaan does not represent the millennium it represents the holy ghost baptism for believers next in june of 1953 brother braham said christ died a sinner and of course i believe this was a slip of the tongue because he seems he said it right in the other times when he spoke on this subject brother ram said quote and when they killed him and he died a sinner end quote friends hebrews 4 15 says jesus was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin so jesus christ did not die a sinner but he did die with the sins of the entire world upon him brother ram got this right in 1954 in god perfecting his church quote he died a sinner and not sin that he had done but my sin and your sin on him drove him to the cross end quote also in june of 1953 brother ram said christ broke the law himself again i believe this was a slip of the tongue christ did not break the law christ fulfilled the law quote they couldn't keep the law christ was come and broke the law himself because grace had already provided a savior moses provided a way of escape end quote so i believe this was a slip of the tongue the truth is christ never broke the law he fulfilled the law christ did break the traditions of the elders which were not the word they were not the law like the washing of hands and washing of pots and so forth but christ never broke god's word in november 1953 brother brahm said jesus never did commission to teach the word of god quote he didn't say go teach the word he said go preach the gospel he never did commission go teach the word end quote friends if you read matthew 28 19 jesus said quote go ye therefore and teach all nations end quote so the truth is brother branham was just confused on this or he was wrong later he probably grew in his revelation and understanding of this but jesus christ did say go and teach all nations go and teach the word of god next in 1954 i only have one quote it's from march what think he christ brother ram said quote moses a very outstanding character of the bible the greatest of all the prophets end quote so here brother ram said moses was the greatest of all prophets but one year later he said john the baptist was the greatest of prophets and then three months after that he says jesus was the greatest of all the prophets so what is the truth jesus is the greatest prophet of all because he was a god prophet but john the baptist was the greatest of the old testament prophets even greater than moses and that was according to jesus christ in matthew chapter 11. brother branham said quote when jesus came he was considered john was the greatest of all the prophets because the rest of them spoke of jesus but john said behold the lamb of god that take away the sin of the world end quote and then in blind bartimaeus 1955 brother graham said quote and the greatest of all the prophets and all the king and lord and master of them was jesus end quote next in 1955 there's only one quote i found that was an honest mistake or change of doctrine it was in being led of the holy spirit in 1955 but the ramp said quote couldn't you believe you can lose your salvation backslide from god so can you the healing end quote i agree with this quote that brother brahms said you can lose your salvation i believe that because of other quotes brother brown gave specifically about judas iscariot and questions and answers part 1 1964 quote was judas iscariot's name blotted out of the lamb's book of life or was it ever on it yes it was on it and was blotted out end quote so judas's name was on the book of life but it was blotted out not the lamb's book of life as brother i'm taught later no names can be blotted off the lamb's book of life but getting back to you can lose your salvation in 1957 brother brahm said you could not lose your salvation quote and god wouldn't save you here knowing he was going to lose you down you might be worked up and think you are saved here that might be true but let me tell you something when you're really saved god don't save you here and know he's going to lose you there end quote so on this topic of losing your salvation you have quotes on both sides which one is true well according to the scripture the one that's true is a person can lose their salvation because jesus said in revelation chapter 3 that if people do not overcome he will blot out their names out of the book of life and of course there's many scriptures in the book of hebrews about people that were sanctified and yet then did despite the spirit of grace and trotted underfoot the son of god they lost their salvation they tasted of the good word of god but then they left the faith and it could be no more renewed unto salvation next in 1957 in march brother ram said rebecca his daughter would take his place in seeing visions quote little rebecca who i believe is going to maybe take my place someday she's seen her first vision just recently end quote now of course we know sister rebecca did not take brother branham's place seeing visions and giving discernments in the prayer lines and prophesying with us saith the lord so this was brother ram's own human opinion his own desire as a father next in june of 57 brother ram plainly said his idea was not thus saith the lord in faith once delivered to the saints he said quote i don't know this may this just is my feeling not thus saith the lord this is william branham i feel that my ministry is closing in america see about finished end quote so if branham tabernacle makes this quote thus saith the lord they're contradicting their own prophet because brahm said this is not thus saith the lord next in october of 57 brother ram said the new birth is not the baptism of the holy ghost quote no when you believe on the lord jesus christ you then have the new birth when you believe on the lord you receive a new thought a new life but it isn't the baptism of the holy ghost end quote he also said this later in 1962 the key to the door quote but new birth is not the baptism of the holy spirit end quote brother branham of course corrected this in the church age book he wrote what is the baptism with the holy ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of christ it is the new birth it is the spirit of god coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience toward god end quote so the truth is the new birth and baptism of the holy ghost are one in the same in 1958 i only have one quote it's from july by faith moses brother branham predicted total annihilation for the whole world before 77 quote and then there will come a total annihilation the entire nation will be wiped out and that i predict now this is not the lord saying this the other about the woman it is is the lord but i predicted in 1933 that the world would meet total annihilation before 77 end quote and then later on he said quote but i seen the nation in total annihilation just stumps of trees and things like that left end quote so friends total annihilation did not come to the world before 77 and total annihilation did not come to united states before 77 with only tree stumps left in 1959 it only had one quote in this quote from thinking on our way brother branham admitted to lying to the irs and of course his lie to the irs was not thus saith the lord he said quote something said to me can you lay your lying hands on that child and i've lied to you and i cause my wife to lie end quote the lord did not tell brother ram to lie so the brotherhood's lie was not thus saith the lord moving ahead to 1960 in march the sermon y brother ram said mary had the egg for the conception of jesus's body in her womb quote and in this case mary had the the egg but the germ the blood cell come from god the creator who made it end quote of course brother ram later said god created both the egg and the germ or the sperm in may of 1960 brother ram said elisha was on mount transfiguration and not elijah so the truth is bill brotherham had a slip of the tongue or maybe was forgetful the truth is elijah was on mount transfiguration quote and elisha had went to heaven 500 years before that but on mount transfiguration they were found talking with jesus end quote again in may of 1960 brother ram said 16 men died at ai but it was 32 according to joshua chapter 7 verse 5. in adoption part 1 brother ram said quote took the life of 16 men i think it was 16 maybe more i believe it was 16 men that was dead end quote again in may of 1960 bill graham said he was a cockle burr but changed to a wheat but of course later in the church age book brotherhood said you always were wheat seed so adoption part one quote i was a cockle bur i was born in sin shaped iniquity come to the world speaking lies born amongst sinners father and mother and all my whole family sinners i was a cockle burr but all of a sudden i became a wheat grain end quote brother bran also taught this later in the token 1963 he said quote his desires and ambitions is of heaven because he's changed from a cocklebur to a wheat end quote then the church age book brother ram says you always were what you were he says quote you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there is no change in specie end quote so in the natural a cockle burr can never change into a wheat grain and brother brahm uses that same thinking that same logic in the church age book to say you were never a pig changed into a sheep he said it's impossible to change the life of the seed and that's true in december 1960 brother brandon said rebecca met her bride so if this is thus saith the lord rebecca married a woman but we know this was a slip of the tongue from brother branham quote for as rebecca rode the camel and jumped off the camel right between the house of abraham out in the field she met her bride end quote and again there's numerous quotes like this and of course there's quotes on the other side where brother bram said rebecca met her bridegroom so he corrected that slip of the tongue also in december 1960 brother graham said the white horse rider was the holy spirit quote the sixth chapter deals with uh with the white horse which was the holy spirit went forth conquering to conquer first went forth was the holy ghost across the earth conquering and to conquer end quote also in the patmos vision brother braham said the same he said the white horse rider was the same in revelation 6 as revelation 19. he said quote when the white horse no it's six when the white horse rider went forth he was given a bow to conquer and to conquer and a sword went out of his mouth what was he the white horse rider of revelation notice the sword out of his mouth goes a sharp two-edged sword the word end quote so in that quote brother ram says the white horse rider was the same person in revelation 6 and revelation 19 but of course later in 1963 brother ram said the revelation 6 white horse rider was the antichrist not the same white horse rider as revelation 19 which was jesus christ the word of god this is the end of part one as there will likely be one or two more parts in this short series lord willing in the next part i'll show 42 more honest human mistakes brother brandon made for a total of 63 human mistakes that i've compiled to date and then offer a plea and prayer for the tape worshipers to repent i'm also going to publish the audio of this series on our defending the message podcast in order to help believers who struggle with knowing whether or not to trust branham tabernacles current leadership in all humility i believe they are not trustworthy due to their 21 false doctrines they currently propagate in order to exalt the tapes to infallibility and exalt brother branham to the greatest prophet who ever lived without any biblical authority to do so and they also either purposely or ignorantly forget to add except for jesus thank you friends for all your support and positive feedback god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
