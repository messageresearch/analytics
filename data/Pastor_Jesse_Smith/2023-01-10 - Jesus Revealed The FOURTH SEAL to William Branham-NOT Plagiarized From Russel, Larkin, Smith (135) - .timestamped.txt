[0:00] [Music]
[0:07] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:13] this video is to prove hopefully by
[0:15] God's grace for once and for all that
[0:18] brother Branham received the revelation
[0:20] of the foreseal from the Lord Jesus
[0:22] Christ and he did not plagiarize it from
[0:24] Charles Tay's Russell Clarence Larkin
[0:27] Noah Uriah Smith
[0:29] as this video will show there are seven
[0:32] differences between brother Branham and
[0:35] Charles Taze Russell on the fourth seal
[0:37] alone
[0:38] now if you're keeping track in this
[0:40] series these seven differences combined
[0:43] with the 19 differences between brother
[0:46] Branham and Charles Hayes Russell on the
[0:48] first three seals make a total of 26
[0:51] differences on the first four seals
[0:54] between God's Prophet brother Branham
[0:56] and the false prophet Charles Tays
[0:59] Russell
[1:00] before beginning the fourth seal let's
[1:02] look at three comments from people
[1:05] criticizing brother Branham and have
[1:07] supported brother Bran's accusers who
[1:09] falsely claim brother Branham
[1:11] plagiarized the Seven Seals
[1:13] so these three comments are from
[1:15] brotherbraham's accusers video about the
[1:18] so-called theft of the four seal and of
[1:21] course as we'll prove in this video
[1:22] brother Branham got the revelation of
[1:24] the force seal from the Lord Jesus
[1:26] Christ and not Charles Tay's Russell
[1:29] these three comments on the theft of the
[1:31] four seal video prove how easily people
[1:34] are deceived who leave this message
[1:36] these deceived people who speak against
[1:39] the message do not even do any research
[1:41] and they don't even follow up on the
[1:43] research done by the so-called leaders
[1:46] of the movement to leave the message
[1:48] that God gave to his Prophet brother
[1:50] Branham
[1:51] the first two comments say quote thank
[1:53] you excellent end quote and quote nice
[1:57] video end quote
[1:59] the third comment says quote ladies and
[2:01] gentlemen Tays Russell is the one
[2:03] revealing to William Marin Branham day
[2:06] by day not hard to see amazing series
[2:09] end quote
[2:12] I'm pointing out these three comments
[2:14] because it shows how deceived these
[2:17] accusers of brother Branham are they
[2:20] call the research excellent nice and
[2:23] amazing
[2:24] and yet as we'll show now this video on
[2:27] the four seal only quoted less than two
[2:31] sentences out of the nearly four pages
[2:33] that Charles Tays Russell wrote about
[2:36] the fourth seal
[2:38] here's a screenshot of the nearly four
[2:40] pages Charles Hayes Russell wrote about
[2:42] the fourth seal highlighted in blue is
[2:45] the portion on the fourth seal
[2:47] in yellow you can see the portion of
[2:49] Russell's work that brother Ryan's
[2:51] accusers actually use on their video
[2:56] these three individuals praising the
[2:59] theft of the four seal video are clearly
[3:02] delusional and greatly deceived because
[3:05] they never studied Russell's Force seal
[3:07] for themselves
[3:09] and along with that they never studied
[3:11] brother Ram's Force seal to know the
[3:13] difference between Charles Tay's Russell
[3:15] and brother Branham
[3:17] how can this so-called research be
[3:18] amazing when this research leaves out
[3:21] the seven differences between brother
[3:23] Branham and Charles Tay's Russell
[3:25] and jumps to a false conclusion that
[3:27] brother Branham plagiarized Charles Tays
[3:29] Russell off of less than two sentences
[3:32] of Russell's research
[3:34] how can the so-called research be
[3:36] amazing when it ignores the two hour and
[3:40] 25-minute sermon brother Brandon
[3:42] preached about the fourth seal
[3:45] so the conclusion about the theft of the
[3:47] four seal video and the comments from
[3:50] these three individuals is that they
[3:52] have answered a matter before they
[3:54] actually heard it
[3:56] Folly and shame unto them according to
[3:58] Proverbs 18 verse 13.
[4:01] they've answered the force seal matter
[4:02] before honestly looking at the four
[4:05] pages Russell wrote about the fourth
[4:07] seal they've answered the four seal
[4:10] matter and ignoring the two hour and
[4:11] 25-minute sermon brother Brandon
[4:13] preached about the fourth seal and it
[4:16] makes us question whether these people
[4:17] are righteous or not because the Bible
[4:19] says in Proverbs 15 28 the heart of the
[4:23] righteous studieth to answer
[4:25] but the mouth of the wicked poureth out
[4:27] evil things
[4:29] how can the author of this series on the
[4:31] theft of the Seven Seals and all these
[4:34] commenters be righteous when they have
[4:37] ignored the first 26 differences between
[4:40] Charles Tay's Russell and brother
[4:42] Branham on the first four seals only God
[4:45] knows friends
[4:46] God is the only one who knows their
[4:48] hearts God will be the judge whether or
[4:51] not their souls are righteous because
[4:53] they've answered a matter before they've
[4:55] heard it and they have not studied this
[4:58] matter out fully
[4:59] may God have mercy on these accusers
[5:02] and again may the Lord Jesus Christ have
[5:04] mercy upon these accusers and guide them
[5:07] to full repentance
[5:10] let's begin with the accusation about
[5:12] the fourth seal one accuser of brother
[5:14] Branham said quote not surprisingly
[5:16] after copying the first three seals from
[5:19] Charles Hayes Russell we again see
[5:21] William branham's Revelation is
[5:23] identical to Russell's end quote
[5:27] and this accuser brother Branham made a
[5:29] two minute and 20 second video about the
[5:31] fourth seal and of course that amount of
[5:34] time is not sufficient to cover all the
[5:37] details of the force seal that both
[5:39] brother Branham taught and Charles Tay's
[5:41] Russell taught
[5:43] now we'll see how their teachings were
[5:45] not identical and brother Ram's accusers
[5:48] are either purposely slandering brother
[5:50] Branham or incredibly shoddy and weak
[5:53] researchers with little to no
[5:56] understanding of what brother Branham
[5:57] actually taught about the fourth seal
[6:01] let's begin with William Branham and
[6:03] Charles Tays Russell
[6:06] see here's a screenshot of the so-called
[6:08] proof that brother Ram's accusers used
[6:11] to show how he apparently stole the
[6:13] force seal
[6:15] they quoted Charles Hayes Russell's book
[6:17] The finished Mystery by saying quote and
[6:18] when he had opened the fourth seal still
[6:21] the same Rider the papacy end quote
[6:24] and then they showed how brother Brown
[6:25] said quote
[6:26] and John went to see and he saw a Pale
[6:29] Horse and again the same Rider upon this
[6:31] Pale Horse now he has a name called
[6:33] Death end quote
[6:35] and that was brother Branham from the
[6:37] fourth seal
[6:39] so did Brother Braham say it was the
[6:40] same writer yes but it was only a
[6:44] partial agreement with Russell as there
[6:47] were seven more details about the fourth
[6:49] seal that the accusers ignored to their
[6:52] own shame
[6:54] here's a screenshot of the nearly four
[6:56] pages Charles Hayes Russell wrote about
[6:58] the fourth seal from Pages 114 to 117
[7:02] highlighted in blue is the portion on
[7:05] the fourth seal in yellow you can see
[7:08] the portion of Russell's work that
[7:10] brother Ryan's accusers actually use on
[7:12] their video again it's such an extremely
[7:14] small amount of information from Charles
[7:18] stage Russell about the fourth seal it
[7:20] doesn't fully represent Russell's
[7:22] teachings on the fourth seal
[7:24] again I'm not the judge of a person's
[7:26] heart but here it looks like brother
[7:28] end's accusers purposely left out all
[7:31] this information in order to slander
[7:33] God's Prophet brother Branham but
[7:36] thankfully the elect of God cannot be
[7:38] deceived by such
[7:39] shoddy weak and limited research
[7:44] so let's begin with the first difference
[7:46] between brother Branham and Russell
[7:48] the first difference is the timing
[7:51] Russell said the timing of the four seal
[7:53] was quote pre-reformation period end
[7:56] quote and it was likely from
[7:58] 1160 to
[8:01] 1516. and here's a screenshot of
[8:04] Russell's quote about the
[8:06] pre-reformation period regarding the
[8:08] force seal Russell said quote an app
[8:10] description of its Chief claim to
[8:12] recognition During the pre-reformation
[8:14] period end quote
[8:17] this timing was completely different
[8:19] from Brother Branham brother Bram said
[8:21] the timing of the four seal was from
[8:23] quote the last age end quote until the
[8:27] time when the Antichrist or beast takes
[8:30] his quote Last Ride end quote into
[8:32] Perdition or the battle of Armageddon at
[8:35] the end of Daniel's 70th week
[8:39] so here's a visual of Russell's timing
[8:41] versus brother Brown's timing notice
[8:43] there's a difference of over 700 years
[8:46] between the start time of Russell's four
[8:49] seal and the start time of brother
[8:50] branham's for seal
[8:53] and also notice there's over a 400 year
[8:55] difference between the end time of
[8:56] Russell's Force seal
[8:58] and of course brother Brandon's Force
[9:00] seal ends at the end of the tribulation
[9:02] period which the tribulation period
[9:04] hasn't started yet
[9:06] so any honest humble person will
[9:08] recognize that these two men's teachings
[9:10] were not identical as brother Ram's
[9:13] accuser said
[9:15] How can any honest person say these are
[9:17] identical teachings
[9:20] the second difference is the Pale Horse
[9:22] Russell said The Pale Horse was quote
[9:24] the ghastly and horrible teachings that
[9:26] God's people must be exterminated end
[9:30] quote in the pre-reformation period
[9:32] and he also said quote the ghastly green
[9:34] of Terror and of death end quote
[9:39] this is not what brother random taught
[9:41] brother Branham said The Pale Horse
[9:42] represented quote political and and
[9:45] religious and and demon powers mixed
[9:47] together end quote so again their
[9:50] teachings on The Pale Horse were not
[9:52] identical Russell's teaching was that
[9:55] the Pale Horse was ghastly teachings
[9:58] During the pre-reformation period and
[10:01] brother Branham said it was the demon
[10:02] powers mixed together writing from 1906
[10:05] which was the start of the last Church
[10:07] age all the way to the end of Daniel's
[10:09] 70th week in the Great Tribulation
[10:11] period
[10:13] the third difference was the writer I
[10:16] mentioned this earlier and this is the
[10:17] one detail brother man's accuser used on
[10:20] his video Russell said quote still the
[10:22] same writer the papacy end quote and
[10:25] brother Brown did say quote same Rider
[10:26] upon this Pale Horse end quote
[10:29] now they're partially the same but not
[10:31] fully
[10:32] they're different because Russell said
[10:34] it was the papacy During the
[10:35] pre-reformation period
[10:37] but brother random shows us how the
[10:39] combined demon powers come into one man
[10:41] the Antichrist person or the person of
[10:44] the Beast and this Antichrist person or
[10:47] beast makes a covenant with Israel for
[10:49] seven years but breaks the Covenant in
[10:51] the midst of the year
[10:53] and then takes his final ride into
[10:55] Perdition at the battle of Armageddon
[10:58] against Jesus Christ and during that
[11:00] battle the Antichrist himself or beast
[11:02] is cast alive into the Lake of Fire
[11:05] and of course Charles Russell did not
[11:07] teach this he said it was
[11:08] pre-reformation papacy so again these
[11:11] teachings are not identical
[11:14] the fourth difference is the Beast
[11:18] Russell said the fourth Beast or Eagle
[11:21] was quote Infinite Wisdom end quote
[11:24] brother random taught different brother
[11:26] Branham said the Beast was quote in the
[11:28] eagle age the last age the prophetic age
[11:31] where there is to rise prophetic
[11:33] utterancy to whom the secrets always
[11:35] come now to wind up all these Mysteries
[11:37] God has promised that there would be a
[11:39] genuine Elijah rise some man Anointed
[11:42] with that spirit and it would reveal he
[11:44] promised it in Malachi 4 end quote
[11:47] so brother Brown tells us the eagle
[11:49] Beast is the prophetic Ministry that God
[11:52] gave to him
[11:53] of course Russell didn't say that
[11:54] infinite wisdom is not identical to a
[11:58] prophetic anointing on the Malachi for
[12:00] Prophet to the Gentiles
[12:02] so that's the fourth proof brother Brown
[12:04] did not plagiarize and teach identical
[12:07] to Charles Tay's Russell
[12:10] the fifth detail was death Russell said
[12:13] death was quote same writer the papacy
[12:15] end quote and gave an example of Pope
[12:18] Innocent III's two decade-long holy
[12:21] crusade in which he had half a million
[12:23] men fighting for him and Russell showed
[12:26] in 1209
[12:30] that an estimated one hundred thousand
[12:33] albigensis died in one day
[12:39] so Russell teaches that death was the
[12:42] papacy killing through the Crusades
[12:45] brother Branham did not teach that
[12:47] regarding the force seal brother Branham
[12:49] said death was quote the anti he's death
[12:51] because the word is life as an
[12:54] antichrist he was death to begin with
[12:56] Antichrist false prophet Beast end quote
[13:00] so brother Branham taught death was the
[13:02] same Antichrist spirit that had been
[13:04] working against the church since the
[13:06] beginning of the New Testament the book
[13:08] of Acts and now the Antichrist Spirit of
[13:10] death was going to work through this
[13:12] last Church age later see in church age
[13:14] and then be headed up in the person of
[13:17] the Antichrist or the Beast which we
[13:19] know will be a future Pope and will kill
[13:21] both with natural death and spiritual
[13:23] death
[13:24] but of course spiritual death being the
[13:26] worst
[13:27] so any honest person can see how these
[13:30] two teachings are not identical
[13:32] Russell said death was the papacy
[13:35] through the Crusades
[13:37] and brother Branham said it was death or
[13:39] spiritual and natural during the
[13:40] laodicean church age and also into the
[13:43] Great Tribulation period
[13:45] the sixth detail is Hell Followed him
[13:48] in his book Russell gave a Bible study
[13:51] showing how death and the grave were
[13:52] equal
[13:53] and said hell does not last forever
[13:56] quoting Revelation 20 verse 13.
[13:59] now those are true teachings but Russell
[14:02] said Jonah went to hell but came out of
[14:04] hell
[14:05] Russell said quote yet there are at
[14:07] least two persons in history who have
[14:08] been in hell and come out of hell one is
[14:11] Jonah who prayed in hell and was
[14:13] delivered from Hell Jonah 2 verse 2 end
[14:15] quote
[14:17] of course brother Brandon did not teach
[14:19] that Jonah went to hell
[14:20] so these teachings are not identical
[14:22] while it's true brother random taught
[14:24] that hell does not last forever which
[14:26] the Bible teaches brother Branham had
[14:28] the true Revelation about hell not being
[14:32] Eternal he said quote when the natural
[14:33] man dies hell follows him that's the
[14:36] grave Hades see that's in the natural
[14:38] but in the spiritual it's a lake of fire
[14:40] Eternal separation from God end quote
[14:43] so again we see how Russell had some
[14:46] understanding but not a complete
[14:48] understanding of hell and so this is the
[14:51] sixth proof that the teachings of
[14:53] brother Branham and Charles Tay's
[14:54] Russell on the fourth seal were not
[14:56] identical
[14:58] and the seventh and final difference
[15:00] between brother Branham and Charles
[15:01] Hayes Russell on the fourth seal was
[15:03] power over a fourth part of the earth to
[15:07] kill with sword and beasts
[15:10] regarding this Russell said quote to his
[15:12] Holiness the pope all the Cardinals
[15:14] inquisitors over Europe not over Asia
[15:18] Africa or America end quote
[15:21] so notice Russell said it was death over
[15:24] Europe but not Asia Africa or America
[15:28] during the pre-reformation period so
[15:30] Russell cut the world into four parts
[15:32] during the pre-reformation period and
[15:34] said the papacy would ride over only
[15:37] one-fourth of the Earth
[15:39] this is not what brother Branham taught
[15:41] brother Branham quoted Revelation 19
[15:44] verse 17 and said this power over a
[15:47] fourth part of the Earth was the battle
[15:49] of Armageddon so in the four seal
[15:52] brother bran cited Revelation 19 verse
[15:55] 17 quote and I saw an angel standing in
[15:57] the Sun and he cried with a loud voice
[15:59] saying to all the files of the air in
[16:01] the midst of Heaven Come and gather
[16:03] yourselves together to the supper of the
[16:05] great God he feeds them to the beasts
[16:08] and Birds now watch over here in the
[16:10] other chapter here of the Book of
[16:11] Revelations and just a minute killed
[16:14] with the sword and death and beast of
[16:15] the earth see the Jezebel Church her
[16:18] actually body is to be eaten by fouls
[16:21] and beasts of the earth just exactly
[16:23] like Ahab and Jezebel was in the natural
[16:25] so are they to be in the spiritual form
[16:28] of a church do you see what I mean end
[16:30] quote
[16:31] brother Brown said it was The Pale Horse
[16:33] Gathering the people from the four
[16:36] corners of the Earth to the battle of
[16:38] Armageddon he said quote and watch
[16:40] from corner from the four corners of the
[16:42] earth they gather them gathers them to
[16:45] Armageddon the Bible says end quote
[16:49] so Russell said only Europe brother
[16:51] Branham said what the Bible said that
[16:53] the pale horse rider gathered armies
[16:56] from the four corners of the Earth but
[16:58] then Jesus Christ would destroy them
[17:00] with the sword of the word of his mouth
[17:01] in Revelation chapter 19 proving the end
[17:05] of The Jezebel Church would be exactly
[17:07] like it was for the end of Jezebel in
[17:10] the natural
[17:11] so in summary brother Brandon did not
[17:13] plagiarize Charles Tays Russell these
[17:15] seven differences prove brother Branham
[17:17] did not teach identical to Charles Tay's
[17:20] Russell
[17:21] and sadly approves brother Ram's accuser
[17:23] did not study before he answered the
[17:25] matter of the fourth seal but by God's
[17:28] grace we'll pray for him and his
[17:29] followers at the end of the video
[17:31] now just for good measure let's show how
[17:33] brother Ram did not plagiarize Clarence
[17:35] Larkin on the fourth seal
[17:37] so here's a screenshot of Larkin's
[17:39] writing about the fourth seal
[17:41] and of course the timing of his four
[17:42] seal is during the tribulation period
[17:45] he said quote the reference here is
[17:47] clearly to some great pestilence that
[17:49] shall come upon the Earth after a
[17:51] devastating War followed by famine
[17:53] during which the dead are left unburied
[17:56] a pestilence is sure to follow the
[17:58] fourth part of the earth over which the
[18:00] pestilence shall sweep will probably be
[18:02] that part of the Eastern Hemisphere
[18:03] covered by the revived Roman Empire
[18:06] see map of the old Roman Empire
[18:09] end quote
[18:11] so Larkin places the force heel right
[18:13] after the third seal remember the third
[18:15] seal he said was some great War during
[18:17] the Great Tribulation period so the
[18:20] timing of brother Bynum and Larkin are
[18:21] not identical
[18:23] brother Ram's four seal started in 1906
[18:25] the last age he said and his fourth seal
[18:28] ends at the end of Daniel's 70th week or
[18:31] the end of the Great Tribulation period
[18:32] this is different from Larkin Larkin's
[18:35] Force seal is sometime during the Great
[18:37] Tribulation period notice Larkin never
[18:39] mentioned the battle of Armageddon in
[18:41] his Force seal teaching like brother
[18:43] Branham did
[18:44] so again we can see Larkin and brother
[18:47] Brandon were not identical
[18:50] and again for good measure let's compare
[18:52] brother Branham and Uriah Smith
[18:55] the timing of Uriah Smith's Force seal
[18:58] was from 538 A.D to the time of the
[19:01] reformers
[19:03] Uriah Smith said quote it must refer to
[19:06] the time in which the papacy bore its
[19:08] unrebuked unrestrained and persecuting
[19:10] rule commencing about
[19:13] ad538 and extending to the time when the
[19:15] reformers commenced their work of
[19:17] exposing the Corruptions of the papal
[19:19] systems end quote
[19:22] so here's a visual showing the
[19:23] difference between brother Branham and
[19:25] Uriah Smith are the Rams Force seal
[19:28] started over 1 400 years after Uriah
[19:32] Smith's Forest seal started and brother
[19:34] Ram's Force seal hasn't ended yet
[19:38] in closing
[19:40] friends I hope this four seal video has
[19:42] been a blessing to you again it proves
[19:44] beyond the shadow of a doubt brother
[19:45] Bram did not teach identical to Charles
[19:48] Tay's Russell Clarence Larkin nor Uriah
[19:51] Smith so as Bible Believers we remain
[19:53] grateful that the Holy Ghost revealed
[19:55] these truths to his servant his Prophet
[19:57] brother William Branham we've now seen
[20:00] 26 differences between brother brahm's
