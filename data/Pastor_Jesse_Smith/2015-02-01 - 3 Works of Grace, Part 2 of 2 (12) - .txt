TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the bible gives us types or foreshadowing of the three works of grace that god has now implemented in the new testament the first example is the earth and how god has and will use three works to redeem this earth and will eventually dwell on this earth just as he has redeemed man in order to dwell in him the first step was the water in noah's flood which is a type of the water baptism that follows justification by faith next the earth was sanctified by christ's blood when jesus was on the cross and his blood poured out on the earth after the soldier pierced his side with a spear the third and final step will be the fire baptism to come upon the earth after the battle of armageddon spoken of by saint peter in saint peter 2 chapter 3 verse 12 looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat notice that this fiery baptism experience allows jesus to return to the earth as son of david and reign for a thousand years this coming of jesus to dwell in the earth is a type of how the holy ghost comes to dwell and abide in our souls through the baptism of the holy ghost here are four more clear examples from nature and the old testament that testify of the three works of grace in the new testament the natural birth of a baby from the womb of a pregnant mother types the three stages of the new birth by the baptism of the holy ghost in the natural birth first the woman's water breaks which types water baptism and justification second there is a bloody show before the child is born which types sanctification third the actual birth of the baby takes place and the spirit of the baby cries out after it enters this world this types the new birth or the baptism of the holy ghost first john 5 8 and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one the nation of israel leaving egypt under the ministry of moses and then possessing the land of canaan the promised land also types the three works of grace in the new testament first israel was brought out of egypt and passed through the waters of the red sea which types water baptism and justification second israel was proved or tried by god in the wilderness for forty years which types sanctification third israel entered the promised land to dwell there permanently and possess the land which types the new birth and how the holy ghost permanently dwells in our bodies god foretold of the three works of grace in ezekiel chapter 36 verses 26 and 27 a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i'll give you and heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them the new heart represents justification the new spirit represents sanctification and god's spirit or my spirit types the baptism of the holy ghost that comes upon a believer as the third work of grace abraham's life itself also foreshadowed the three works of grace first he was called by god to come out from his nation family and house in genesis chapter 12 verses 1 through 3 which types justification and leaving the things of the world next the entire time afterwards was his time of sanctification or second work of grace because we know the third work of grace and abraham's life would have been the token or sign of the circumcision in genesis chapter 17 verses 9 through 14. the token of the circumcision in abraham's life represents the baptism of the holy ghost in the new testament because the new testament teaches this in the following scriptures romans 2 verse 29 but he is a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of god philippians 3 verse 3 for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus which have no confidence in the flesh galatians 3 14 that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith here are three clear examples of real bible characters from the new testament who experience the three works of grace in their lives saint peter cornelius and the believers of ephesus first saint peter experienced justification at some point prior to matthew chapter 16 verses 15-19 because jesus told him that he had already received revelation that jesus was the messiah the son of the living god from god himself the moment peter received that revelation was the moment he believed and recognized his salvation from god peter then experienced sanctification during the entire time that followed his revelation of jesus as the messiah unto the end of acts chapter 1. this is obvious because jesus prayed specifically for peter and all the disciples to be sanctified in john chapter 17 verses 17 through 20. sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word acts chapter 2 showed peter received the third step of grace when he was born again on the day of pentecost the holy ghost filled each of the 120 disciples that were in the upper room according to acts chapter 2 verses 1 through 4 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance a second example is that of the italian centurion named cornelius in acts chapter 10. like peter we don't have the exact moment of his justification but we are told of it in acts chapter 10 verses 36 and 37 the word that jesus was israel's messiah was published and declared to cornelius and he believed the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all that word i say ye know which was published throughout all judea and began from galilee after the baptism which john preached from the moments after cornelius first believed he no doubt entered into the second work of grace sanctification during this work we are told he learned to pray faithfully give alms in secret and also fast in secret as well according to acts chapter 10 verses 4 and verse 30. the third work of grace that took place for cornelius and all those that heard peter's preaching was in acts chapter 10 verse 44 when the holy ghost fell and filled the souls of those that heard and believed his preaching a third example is in the lives of the twelve ephesian church members of acts chapters 18 and 19. acts 18 verses 24 through 28 show the justification of the ephesian believers as the preaching of apollos mightily convinced them to believe that jesus was the christ after those moments of first believing the ephesians then entered sanctification the second work of grace the third and final work of grace took place in acts chapter 19 verses 1 1-7 saint paul came to their church and found that the ephesians had not even heard of the baptism of the holy ghost or the third work of grace so paul re-baptized them in the name of the lord jesus and prayed for them to receive the holy ghost the holy ghost then fell and came upon them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied we pray this teaching on the three works of grace has thoroughly proved that god uses these three works to fully dwell and fill the soul of the christian please know also that even after the third work of grace is complete the baptism of the holy ghost god's love will continue the work of continual sanctification through the entire life of each christian as saint paul taught in 1st thessalonians chapter 5 verse 23 jesus himself experienced this continual lifelong sanctification as well as the bible teaches the holy ghost abode in him and remained in him after the river jordan as we noted earlier from john chapter 1 verse 32 and 33 but we find jesus praying for more sanctification well after this towards the end of his earthly ministry hours before he would bear the cross of calvary john 17 verse 19 and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth we also want to recommend an order of viewing the teaching videos on our website as it may help you much in your christian experience we suggest that you watch the following videos before the others first we recommend you starting with the true repentance video series because a christian must be sure they started their walk with god correctly the christians should start with a sincere repentant heart if not their entire walk with god may be in vain if they denounce the faith at some point like judas iscariot the son of perdition second we recommend viewing water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ immediately after someone believes they should be baptized or totally immersed in water calling upon the name of the lord jesus christ the title's father son holy ghost should not be called upon because jesus said there was one name not names to the father son holy ghost and the five baptisms in the book of acts prove what is that one name the lord jesus christ we believe these two foundational videos will help you start right with god if your foundation is sure if your house or tabernacle is built upon a rock of truth then you can stand straight and tall overcoming all attacks of the devil through the grace of our lord jesus christ if you would like more bible scriptures about the three works of grace god uses to fully dwell inside a believer's soul please contact us god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart you
