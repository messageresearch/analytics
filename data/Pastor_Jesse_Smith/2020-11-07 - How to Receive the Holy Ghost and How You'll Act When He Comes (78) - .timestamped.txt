[0:00] [Music]
[0:10] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:12] of the lord jesus christ the purpose of
[0:15] this video is to teach
[0:16] how to receive the holy ghost and how
[0:19] you'll act
[0:19] when he comes upon your being our
[0:22] previous video series called
[0:24] true repentance and the three works of
[0:27] grace will be helpful to you
[0:28] as you seek the baptism of the holy
[0:30] ghost so please watch those
[0:32] if you haven't yet done so this video
[0:35] was a request from a viewer
[0:37] as we find many believers quickly get
[0:39] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[0:41] christ
[0:42] called justification and move into
[0:45] sanctification
[0:47] and sort of get stuck there desiring the
[0:49] baptism of the holy ghost but not sure
[0:51] what to do
[0:53] so this video focuses on sanctification
[0:56] i'll begin with how to receive the holy
[0:58] ghost to move on from sanctification
[1:01] to receiving the baptism of the holy
[1:03] ghost remember this simple
[1:05] bible-based advice daily bible
[1:08] pray obey here's the bible reasoning
[1:11] behind this advice first the idea of
[1:15] daily
[1:16] if you want the holy ghost baptism you
[1:18] must daily connect to jesus christ
[1:21] don't get in a hurry or allow yourself
[1:22] to become frustrated
[1:24] patiently abide in christ or stay
[1:27] connected to christ as much as possible
[1:30] every day because you grow into the holy
[1:33] ghost baptism
[1:34] by daily loving and serving jesus
[1:37] as he teaches in mark chapter 4 verses
[1:41] 26-28 jesus's parable says the kingdom
[1:44] of god grows in three stages
[1:47] like a wheat plant and those three
[1:50] stages represent
[1:51] justification sanctification and the
[1:54] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:56] mark 4 28 says for the earth bringeth
[1:58] forth fruit of herself
[2:00] first the blade that's justification
[2:03] then the ear sanctification after that
[2:07] the full
[2:08] corn in the ear that's the baptism of
[2:10] the holy ghost
[2:12] and recall that jesus says the kingdom
[2:14] of god is within you
[2:16] or the baptism of the holy ghost christ
[2:19] in you
[2:20] the hope of glory according to
[2:22] colossians 1 27
[2:25] but luke 17 21 is where jesus says
[2:28] for behold the kingdom of god is within
[2:31] you
[2:33] next moving on to bible the bible is the
[2:37] second word of advice because jesus says
[2:40] you are sanctified through the truth and
[2:42] the word
[2:43] or bible is truth according to john 17
[2:46] 17 sanctify them through thy truth
[2:50] thy word is truth jesus confirms
[2:53] sanctification
[2:54] comes by the word for jesus says we are
[2:57] sanctified by the truth
[2:58] and his word is truth so you must feed
[3:01] on the truth
[3:02] love the truth pray the truth and obey
[3:05] the truth
[3:07] this agrees with jesus labeling the
[3:08] three works of grace
[3:10] as the way justification the truth
[3:14] sanctification and the life the baptism
[3:17] of the holy ghost in john 14
[3:19] 6 jesus saith unto him i am the way
[3:23] the truth and the life
[3:26] the next word is pray prayer is the
[3:29] third word of advice from jesus
[3:31] who urges us to repeatedly ask for the
[3:33] holy ghost baptism
[3:35] in prayer hungering and thirsting for it
[3:38] according to luke 11 13 if ye then being
[3:42] evil know how to give good gifts unto
[3:44] your children
[3:45] how much more shall your heavenly father
[3:47] give the holy spirit
[3:48] to them that ask him and matthew 5
[3:52] 6 says blessed are they which do hunger
[3:54] and thirst after righteousness
[3:56] for they shall be filled the last
[4:00] word in the advice is obey it's the
[4:02] fourth word of advice
[4:04] peter who lived with and preached for
[4:06] jesus for three and a half years
[4:08] without the holy ghost baptism told us
[4:11] we must
[4:12] obey god if we want to be born again
[4:15] it's found in acts 5 32 and we are his
[4:18] witnesses of these things and so also is
[4:20] the holy ghost
[4:21] whom god has given to them that obey him
[4:25] so this is a simple summary of
[4:27] sanctification
[4:28] if you're daily reading the bible asking
[4:30] in prayer for the holy ghost baptism
[4:33] hungering and thirsting for it and
[4:35] obeying the word
[4:36] as sincerely as possible you'll soon
[4:38] receive
[4:39] the holy ghost baptism
[4:43] next let's move on to the section how
[4:45] you'll act when he comes upon you
[4:48] you will act in a similar or same way as
[4:51] the saints
[4:52] in the book of acts who receive the holy
[4:54] ghost
[4:55] and thankfully we have five clear
[4:56] examples of how they
[4:58] acted your experience will match
[5:01] acts and then you'll have the holy
[5:03] spirit fruit
[5:04] following your life after you receive
[5:07] eternal life
[5:09] but first of all who is the holy ghost
[5:13] a viewer asked me to teach the identity
[5:15] of the holy ghost
[5:16] who is he scripturally the holy ghost is
[5:20] god himself
[5:21] the father for god is one person the
[5:24] father shares a measure of his own life
[5:26] in your soul the holy ghost baptism is
[5:29] god himself dwelling permanently
[5:31] in your soul walking in your body
[5:34] according to second corinthians 6 verses
[5:36] 16 16-18 and what agreement at the
[5:39] temple of god with idols
[5:41] for ye are the temple of the living god
[5:43] as god hath said
[5:45] i will dwell in them and walk in them
[5:47] and i will be their god
[5:49] and they shall be my people wherefore
[5:51] come out from among them and be
[5:53] separate saith the lord and touch not
[5:55] the unclean thing
[5:56] and i will receive you and will be a
[5:59] father unto you
[6:00] and ye shall be my sons and daughters
[6:03] saith the lord almighty
[6:06] additionally the holy spirit in your
[6:08] soul is also
[6:09] power eternal life and the spirit of
[6:12] truth
[6:13] to name a few examples
[6:16] the spirit is eternal life according to
[6:18] hebrews 9 14
[6:20] the spirit is power according to
[6:21] ephesians 6 10
[6:23] first thessalonians 1 verse 5 2 timothy
[6:26] 1
[6:26] 7 2 peter 1 verses 3 and 4
[6:30] and revelation 20 verse 6. the spirit is
[6:33] truth
[6:34] or the word of god according to john 14
[6:36] 17
[6:37] john 4 24 john 15 verse 16
[6:41] john 16 13 ephesians 1 13
[6:45] ephesians 5 9 2 thessalonians 2
[6:48] 13 first peter 1 22 first john 4
[6:52] 6 and first john 5 verse 6.
[6:57] now getting back to how you'll act when
[6:58] the holy ghost comes upon you
[7:00] you'll have a bible-based experience
[7:02] with evidence or fruits of the spirit
[7:05] from that time on so how is a believer
[7:08] baptized with the holy ghost
[7:10] he's born again by the spirit of god
[7:13] falling into a soul from heaven
[7:15] causing a bold liberating emotional
[7:18] worship experience i call it the see and
[7:21] hear
[7:21] principle every time a believer was
[7:24] filled with the holy ghost in the book
[7:25] of acts
[7:26] observers could see and hear the outward
[7:28] effects
[7:29] of their inward soul baptism just as you
[7:33] see in here a natural baby's birth
[7:35] you see in here a christian spiritual
[7:37] birth
[7:39] in acts 2 verses 1 to 33 peter
[7:42] originates the see in here
[7:44] principle by telling the multitude this
[7:47] therefore being by the right hand of god
[7:49] exalted and having received of the
[7:51] father
[7:51] the promise of the holy ghost he hath
[7:54] shed forth this
[7:55] which ye now see and hear so
[7:58] peter is the one who originated the sea
[8:00] and here principle
[8:04] five texts from the book of acts
[8:05] illustrate this revelation
[8:07] and acts 11 verse 15 proves the holy
[8:10] ghost will fall
[8:11] into the souls of men in a similar
[8:14] worshipful manner every time
[8:16] and as i began to speak the holy ghost
[8:19] fell on them
[8:20] as on us at the beginning yes the
[8:23] spiritual birth experience will be a
[8:25] bold liberating worship experience
[8:28] for every christian not every experience
[8:31] though will be exactly the same
[8:34] there's not one specific outward
[8:36] evidence of the soul baptism
[8:38] as the scripture proves there can be a
[8:40] variety of expressions
[8:41] at the literal moment of receiving the
[8:44] baptism of the holy ghost
[8:46] such as speaking in tongues so others
[8:47] can understand the gospel
[8:49] or declaring god's wonderful works or
[8:52] prophesying or
[8:54] magnifying god but each experience is
[8:57] unashamedly
[8:58] life-changing a believer's experience
[9:00] must also be
[9:01] word-based meaning the christian can
[9:04] identify how his experience
[9:06] matches one of those in the book of acts
[9:08] when the holy ghost fell upon souls
[9:11] it's as if you were there in the upper
[9:13] room in acts chapter 2
[9:15] because you've had a similar experience
[9:18] while emotion comes with a see and hear
[9:20] experience
[9:21] it's not the focus of it lots of
[9:23] worshipers get emotional but never fully
[9:26] repent of their sins
[9:27] to experience a changed life the focus
[9:30] at the beginning of the sea and here
[9:32] experience
[9:33] is lovingly praising god while asking
[9:35] him to fill your soul
[9:37] our father loves to hear his children
[9:39] pray and ask him to fulfill his word
[9:41] just as earthly fathers enjoy meeting
[9:44] their children's requests
[9:46] let's look at the five texts from the
[9:48] book of acts that explain this see and
[9:50] hear
[9:51] principle in acts chapter 2
[9:55] 120 believers got so full of the holy
[9:57] ghost
[9:58] they left the upper room and went into
[10:00] the streets of jerusalem
[10:01] about 9 00 am in the morning declaring
[10:04] the wonderful works of god in such a way
[10:07] that they were accused of being drunk on
[10:09] wine
[10:11] the holy ghost in their souls caused
[10:13] these new christians
[10:15] to express the praises of god which
[10:17] flowed out of their souls
[10:19] into their minds and then further out
[10:21] into their bodies and mouths
[10:23] as they moved around the streets and
[10:24] boldly spake of god's works
[10:29] it's been said a natural birth is a mess
[10:31] and so is a spiritual birth
[10:34] all the joy loud worship emotion and
[10:36] victory comes flowing out
[10:38] at once it looks messy to the world like
[10:41] natural drunkenness but it's a spiritual
[10:43] birth
[10:44] it's an emergence it's eternal life
[10:47] acts chapter 2 was not an unemotional
[10:49] scripted
[10:50] sinner's prayer experience this was the
[10:53] promised
[10:54] living water jesus spoke about flowing
[10:56] out of satisfied souls freshly filled
[10:59] with eternal life the second time the
[11:02] holy ghost falls
[11:03] is in acts 4 31 as recently born again
[11:07] christians prayed for boldness
[11:09] to speak god's word and scripture says
[11:11] the holy ghost filled all the saints
[11:13] who were praying for this petition acts
[11:16] 4 24 says they lifted up their voice to
[11:19] god
[11:20] with one accord so we see the see and
[11:23] hear principle
[11:24] again a second time their loud prayers
[11:27] asked for signs
[11:28] wonders and miracles to be done by the
[11:31] name
[11:31] of thy holy child jesus as soon as they
[11:35] were filled with the holy ghost acts 4
[11:37] says
[11:37] they spake the word of god with boldness
[11:42] the third text is acts chapter 8 verses
[11:44] 14 to 25 when the samaritans
[11:47] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[11:51] this took place about 100 miles from
[11:53] jerusalem peter and john laid hands on
[11:55] the samaritan and the holy ghost fell
[11:57] upon them
[11:58] it fell in such a powerful way that a
[12:00] former sorcerer
[12:01] and recent christian convert named simon
[12:04] was so amazed by how they acted
[12:06] that he offered peter money if he would
[12:09] give him the power to lay hands on
[12:11] people to impart the holy ghost
[12:14] simon was well acquainted with seeing
[12:16] satan manipulate molest and bewitch
[12:18] people
[12:19] through his own evil sorceries but he
[12:21] had never witnessed such genuine pure
[12:24] holy and righteous empowerment as saints
[12:27] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[12:30] a third text of how the holy ghost falls
[12:33] is acts chapter 10
[12:34] verses 44 to 48.
[12:37] though this text is small its
[12:39] description
[12:40] provides great support for the see and
[12:42] hear principle
[12:44] during peter's sermon cornelius and his
[12:46] house receive the gift of the holy ghost
[12:48] as it's poured out upon many gentiles
[12:52] the jews that were with peter heard
[12:54] cornelius and his gentile family speak
[12:56] with tongues
[12:58] and magnify god praise and worship
[13:01] directed to god
[13:02] always flows out of the mouse of
[13:04] spiritual babes
[13:07] and again acts 11 15 proves the holy
[13:09] ghost fell on the gentiles at cornelius
[13:12] house
[13:12] in the same way it fell upon peter and
[13:14] the jews in acts chapter 2.
[13:18] the final time recorded in the book of
[13:20] acts in which believers receive the holy
[13:22] ghost baptism is acts
[13:24] 19 verses 1 to 7 and you see the see and
[13:27] hear principle
[13:29] displayed by two expressions speaking
[13:31] with tongues
[13:32] and prophesied acts 19 6 says
[13:36] when paul laid his hands on them the
[13:37] holy ghost came on them
[13:39] and they spake with tongues and
[13:41] prophesied
[13:42] god sent tongues to share his works with
[13:44] the ephesians
[13:45] revelation 19 10 promises prophecy for
[13:48] those with jesus's spirit
[13:50] saying the testimony of jesus is the
[13:52] spirit of prophecy
[13:54] in closing i hope you enjoyed this short
[13:56] video please
[13:58] contact me if you have any questions or
[14:00] concerns i want to encourage you to keep
[14:02] seeking the holy ghost
[14:03] until just like a plant like a wheat
[14:06] plant
[14:07] stay planted in the ground and just keep
[14:09] feeding on the things of god
[14:11] abide in christ and you will grow up
[14:13] into that third stage the full corn
[14:16] or the baptism of the holy ghost
[14:19] sometimes it takes years to receive the
[14:21] holy ghost i know in my experience it
[14:22] took almost three years
[14:24] think about the apostles they followed
[14:26] jesus for three and a half years
[14:28] but they still weren't born again just
[14:30] as a natural baby
[14:32] god has a specific time in season for
[14:34] all his spiritual children to be born
[14:36] into the kingdom of god
[14:38] lastly i would advise you to listen to
[14:40] the last 45 minutes of the sermon
[14:42] god hiding himself in simplicity from
[14:45] albuquerque new mexico
[14:47] preached by god's prophet william
[14:49] branham
[14:51] in it you can hear how brother branham
[14:52] leads people to receive the holy ghost
[14:55] and he testifies of how the pillar of
[14:57] fire comes and vindicates those souls
[14:59] that did
[15:00] get the holy ghost shower he calls it
[15:04] please contact me if you have any
[15:06] questions or concerns
[15:07] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[15:10] the desire
[15:10] of your heart
