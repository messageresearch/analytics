TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to let you know that my identity was stolen this took place around April 8th and so this hacker has been trying to reach out to people in my contacts and ask for money so please do not send money to this hacker this evil person has full control over my former email address jesse. smith1 sbcglobal.net I've reached out to AT&T to try to get help to get my email back but they do not provide support for that so I will no longer use that email address jesse. smith1 SBC global.net do not accept any emails from that address and please know as always that I've never asked anyone for money the reason I want to make a quick video about this is because we had a visitor attend our church recently visitors come a few times over the last few months and once the hacker stole my email account he saw that the visitor had emailed me a few times and so the hacker impersonated me and asked that visitor for money and because the visitor doesn't know me that well yet the visitor sent him some money and then when I saw the visitor at church we were just talking and he mentioned that and I said brother I never asked you for any money so I wanted to make this video and just warn everyone please do not accept any emails from my former email address the SBC global.net account the email I'm going to use primarily now is jesse. smith1 icloud.com and of course the safest way to contact me is through my cell phone but again anyone that knows me knows I will not ask for money I've never done that and by God's grace I believe I'll never do it so please be aware of this scammer or group of scammers seems like there may be more than one of them but again the scripture says there's no weapon that's formed against us that will prosper and vengeance is mine sayith the Lord God will repay these hackers or the hacker this has been a very difficult situation many hours have put into this but what these hackers meant for evil God will use it for good and I just pray they'll repent of their deception their lies their stealing because they will face Jesus Christ on the day of judgment and I hope they face him with repentant Hearts before they pass away so again in closing please do not accept any emails from jesse. smith1 SBC global.net I will never ask you for money I've been on YouTube for over 10 years I've been preaching for over 20 years I've never asked anyone for a single scent and I will not start now by God's grace and friends please share this video with anyone you know that follows our ministry whether it's the bride of Christ Fellowship YouTube channel or whether it's my personal Channel Pastor Jesse Smith I don't want anyone to lose any money and all the thousands of dollars these hackers tried to take from me has been restored by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and if you think of it please pray for our family if you have any questions or concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
