TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 10 the mystery of iniquity chapter 10 contains footnotes numbers 1602 to 1692 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way 2 thessalonians 2 verse 7 knowing rome is mystery babylon the false mother church and most protestant churches are her daughters lead you to investigate how the mother-daughter team attracts nearly 2 billion members the bible says their congregations thrive through the deceitfulness of iniquity thus the roman catholic church is the mother of and propagator of iniquity in the greek lexicon iniquity means contempt and violation of the law wickedness iniquity or lawlessness is purposely sinning despite knowing god's will it's a well-covered subject in scripture with over 300 mentions paul says iniquity was already working at the time he was writing ii thessalonians around 50 a.d iniquities been living in and controlling the hearts of unrepentant church members for nearly 2000 years but it will head up in the false prophet the pope antichrist multiple examples show a lifestyle of iniquity or habitual sin brings god's wrath and judgment upon the guilty god used the joshua-led israeli army to drive out the amorites when their cup of iniquity was full in god's eyes interestingly god pronounced the amorites doomed to abraham 400 years prior to joshua but showed divine patience for their cup of iniquity to fill lot and his two daughters narrowly escaped god's fire and brimstone wrath upon sodom poured out due to the iniquity of the city judas iscariot's destiny was hell and the thirty pieces of silver he received for betraying christ was his reward of iniquity as the previous chapter showed mystery babylon is destroyed in one hour because her iniquities are remembered in heaven genuine believers will commit single acts of iniquity despite knowing better but they will always repent and change their future behaviors joseph's brothers committed iniquity by selling him into slavery but they repented and revelation shows they are saved crowned and seated with the twelve apostles around jesus's heavenly throne david committed iniquity by unlawfully taking bathsheba and numbering israel but repented and never repeated those sins the apostle paul admits to doing evil sinful acts he hated but assures believers jesus blood forgives all their trespasses john assures the same teaching confession of sins allows the faithful and just christ to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness the universal iniquity problem was so great god sent his dear innocent sinless son jesus to die for past present and future iniquities isaiah 53 verses 5 6 and 11 say jesus was bruised for our iniquities and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all and he justify many by bearing their iniquities this precious gift was not given in vain though and god now requires everyone to accept his son's power to purge their iniquities acts 3 verse 26 says god raised jesus from the dead to bless us in turning away every one of you from his iniquities if you truly believe in jesus you'll gladly accept his blessing of spiritual power to turn from your iniquities to believe in jesus means you stop committing iniquity mark 16 verse 16 proclaims he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned sounds like everyone would believe in jesus and be saved right unfortunately all nations are going to be guilty of rejecting christ through mystery babylon's deceptive sin-loving religion now you'll see how this happens the confusion about the mystery of iniquity the confusion about iniquity centers around which actions lead to habitual iniquity and the appropriate damnable title of worker of iniquity which scripture alludes to over 30 times how does someone become a worker of iniquity and therefore worthy of the lake of fire you've probably heard church members attempt to condone their habitual sins by saying we all have our demons but holy ghost-filled christians should not be bound by demons as servants of satan the revelation of the mystery of iniquity is the antichrist spirit fills and deceives the hellbound majority into blaspheming god's truth under the guise of a sin-loving religious experience workers of iniquity are led by false preachers filled with satan's demons who appear as religious messengers of light but spread spiritual darkness second corinthians 11 verses 13 and 14 described them saying for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light these false ones are destined for and worthy of hell because after knowing the truth they hate blaspheme and fight against it they are more willing to believe lies than bible truth as the specific acts of iniquity are identified in this chapter you'll conclude which groups contain a majority of workers of iniquity and god's wisdom will help you flee from them following after righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart biblical evidence for the revelation of the mystery of iniquity evidence abounds in support of iniquity's revelation and there's no better place to begin than with satan the father of iniquity as jesus is the epitome of godliness leading believers into it satan is the opposite the epitome of iniquity leading billions into it in satan the father of lies you see the same characteristics his children bear today satan the father of iniquity satan's given name from god is lucifer which means lightbearer in hebrew paul says satan often transforms himself into an angel of light but his lying messages enslaved souls in darkness ezekiel 28 verses 11 through 19 says lucifer began as the most bright beautiful angel and was equipped for music ministry in heaven he was an anointed cherub set by god to be a covering around his throne it's likely michael was the other cherub at god's throne as moses's ark of the covenant included two cherubs covering the mercy seat where god's presence dwelt lucifer was perfect in every way until iniquity was found in him as his heart was lifted up because of his brightness and beauty god says his iniquity willful disobedience corrupted his wisdom isaiah 14 verses 13 and 14 reveals his wicked thoughts to exalt himself to be like god for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high satan infamously said i will six times in iniquity providing a stark contrast to jesus's thy will gethsemane prayer in godliness jesus directly rebukes satan for regarding only his will rather than gods in matthew 16 23 get thee behind me satan for thou art an offense unto me for thou savers not the things that be of god but those that be of men satan and his workers are not interested in god's will revelation 12 verses 3 and 4 and verses 7 through 11 explain lucifer's heavenly rebellion as he led the first church split accordingly he's given the titles great red dragon old serpent devil satan and accuser of the brethren in this text lucifer a liar and the father of lies convinced a third of the angels to join his war against michael and the holy angels michael's mighty army prevailed casting lucifer's army out of heaven down to earth and his next act mentioned is beguiling and deceiving a virgin named eve in summary satan's characteristics passed on to his children include disregarding and rejecting god's will for his own a prideful heart accusing others violent and desiring promotion worship and position satan the serpent and eve genesis 3 opens with the subtle sly serpent questioning eve on god's command about which trees she can eat from satan a spirit being had possessed the beast serpent some time before this conversation because all beasts were created sin free and good on the sixth day of creation once cast to earth satan came to eden and found adam and eve as ezekiel 28 13 confirms thou hast been in eden the garden of god knowing he cannot be god of heaven satan observes adam's dominion and connives to take his authority and rule over the earth 2 peter 2 verse 19 reads for of whom a man has overcome of the same as he brought in bondage you know satan succeeded and overcame adam which is why paul calls him the god of this world satan is so shrewd and scripture implores you to be aware of his devices that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil back to genesis 3 eve correctly quotes god's fruit command in reply to the serpent but you find satan doing the same tactic he used in heaven lying and accusing genesis 3 verses 4 through 5 record satan's lie she won't die by touching and eating the forbidden fruit and his accusing god of keeping her from an exalted state of wisdom and existence verse 6 says deceived eve believed the serpent and ate the fruit deciding it was good to eat pleasant looking and able to make her wise you're aware eve then gives the fruit to adam and he eats but read first timothy 2 14 to gain an important truth and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression adam not present at eve's eating finds her and knows she's defiled and destined for death his only choices are to abstain from eating and let her die alone or eat and die with her in hope of god's forgiveness knowing she was part of him taken from his rib he loves her and becomes a type of christ taking her sin upon him eating the fruit christ purposely chose to take his bride sin upon himself and die to redeem her notice satan stealing killing and destroying in eden like jesus warns us in john 10 verse 10 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they may have it more abundantly satan first stole adam's place in eve's heart as genesis 3 verse 16 says eve's desire or longing will be to adam after the fall this means eve longed for the serpent instead of adam then satan killed adam and eve as death literally entered their bodies and eventually took their lives lastly the tempter destroyed their holy sinless state and marital unity the original sin the forbidden fruit and the seed of the serpent you might be wondering how could one apple cause all sin and trouble in the world eve didn't eat an apple because second peter 1 verse 4 says corruption is in the world through lust the forbidden fruit that caused the original sin was a lustful sexual act of adultery between eve and the serpent according to the following nine evidences but first here's a bible-based summary as you'll soon see eve's sexual immorality reveals the mystery of why jesus christ had to be born of a virgin eve's adultery with the serpent is often called the serpent seed doctrine based upon god's own words in genesis 3 verse 15 in which he is speaking directly to the serpent and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel notice your god says the serpent has seed or offspring descendants children in the hebrew lexicon and this is immediately after the fall the fruit eve partook of and shared with adam created two seeds or sets of children the forbidden fruit and two trees tree of life entry of knowledge of good and evil have symbolic not literal meanings the forbidden fruit symbolizes adultery because proverbs 30 verse 20 and song of solomon 4 verses 12 through chapter 5 verse 1 teach eating can represent sexual relations proverbs 30 verse 20 says such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith i have done no wickedness this explains exactly what eve did she was deceived into committing adultery with the serpent thinking she had done no wrong when adam found her defiled some believe song of solomon chapter 4 verse 12 through chapter 5 verse 1 records the wedding night of solomon and the shulamite but it's undeniable eating represents sexual relations in this passage solomon calls her a garden and she invites him to come into his garden and eat his pleasant fruits he says one of her plants is the pomegranate comparing it to her beautiful head within her locks of hair and she says she's going to bring him into her mother's house and cause him to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate e first committed adultery with the serpent lost her virginity and conceived the serpent's seed as paul alludes to in second corinthians 11 verses 2 and 3. for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ adam then found her fallen in sin and partook in sexual relations with her causing her to conceive of his seed cain was the seed of the serpent and abel was adam's seed twins conceived of two separate fathers is called superfecundation according to the journal of forensic sciences nine evidences support the revelation of the serpency doctrine evidence one the bible supports the serpent seed doctrine from genesis to revelation moses jesus paul peter and john all support the serpent seed doctrine through their teachings moses is the author of genesis and recorded genesis 3 verse 15 in which god himself begins the serpent's seed doctrine saying the serpent has a seed or offspring which proved to be cain for he was of that wicked one our lord jesus teaches the serpent seed in matthew 13 verses 24-30 and verses 36-43 in this parable jesus describes the children of god as good seed while the children of the wicked one satan are the tares or bad seed the parable which has numerous applications teaches two different men or sowers planted two different seeds in one field in one application the two men are represented as jesus the son of man and satan the enemy and the field represents the world in another application this parable helps reveal the origin from eden of the two kinds of children the children of god and the children of the devil two males the serpent and adam planted their seeds in one field or one woman eve the seeds or offspring grew and manifested their different natures cain the son of the serpent slew righteous abel for cain was of the cursed seed paul supports the serpent's seed in second corinthians 11 verses 2 and 3 by directly comparing the virginity of the church in corinth to ease virginity when she was presented to adam paul said it was his desire to present the corinthians as a chaste virgin or spiritual virgin to christ then paul says he feared the minds of the corinthians would be corrupted and they would lose their spiritual virginity just as the serpent corrupted the mind of eve causing her to lose her spiritual virginity before losing her physical virginity peter supports the servant seed in second peter 1 verse 4 stating corruption is in the world through lust or a desire for what is forbidden genesis 3 verse 6 says eve thought the tree was pleasant looking and good for food meaning she was physically attracted to the serpent then god declares one consequence for eve's sin is that her desire will be to her husband from henceforth this means her desire was not to her husband when she fell in sin to her lustful desire to the serpent who gave her his seed john teaches the serpent seed in 1st john chapter 3 verses 6 through 15. verse 12 records the holy spirit saying cain was of that wicked one and adam was not the wicked one for this phrase always refers to satan jesus calls satan the wicked one twice in matthew 13 verses 19 and 38 john mentions the wicked one three other times in his same letter and each time it means satan not adam cain even has a separate genealogy from adams in genesis 4 verses 17 through 24 as adams is found in genesis 5 verses 1-32 seth was a son in his adam's own likeness after his image but the bible never says this about cain furthermore the bible states that eve was the mother of all living in genesis 3 verse 20 but scripture never says adam was the father of all living because he was not the serpent was the father of cain and eve was his mother john in revelation 12 9 calls satan that old serpent because he entered and possessed the beast serpent in eden the title old refers to satan as the father of lies and murder from the beginning according to our lord jesus in john 8 44. his wickedness is seen in genesis and continues to revelation but thankfully that old serpent comes to his fiery end through the justice and wrath of almighty god at the battle of gog and magog evidence number two the two trees in the midst of the garden were not literal trees because the tree of knowledge of good and evil was not good for food the two trees tree of life entry of knowledge of good and evil symbolized jesus and satan or the holy spirit and satan's spirit these two trees were different from all other trees in eden genesis 2 verse 9 says every tree out of the ground was good for food proving the tree of knowledge of good and evil was not a regular tree because when eve partook of its fruit sin and death occurred two truths about this evil tree are evident it didn't come from the ground and its fruit was not good for food any tree whose fruit will kill you isn't good for food notice genesis 3 verse 6 says eve believed the fruit was good for food so this is symbolic of her eating the fruit of adultery any sinful act is a fruit of satan just as god's prophet rebuked israel for eating the fruit of lies in hosea chapter 10 verse 13 evidence number three the tree of life was jesus spirit because there is only one way to eternal life if the tree of life was a normal tree like a pear tree it would mean god had a second works-based way to inherit eternal life eating physical food never has and never could give eternal life since eating cannot pardon sin but there has always been and always will be one way to eternal life by faith in god the holy spirit hebrews 11 shows all believers from the beginning are saved by faith as abel was righteous because of his faith similarly hebrews 11 26 says moses followed christ or the holy spirit so salvation by faith was the same in the old testament as in the new jesus claims he is the way the life the bread of life with the words of eternal life he's the only way to eternal life and it's only found in him according to john 5 40 and 1st john 5 verses 11 and 12. evidence number 4 the serpent seed explains the purpose of the virgin birth of jesus the revelation of jesus's mysterious virgin birth is found in this doctrine since mankind's fall into sin came by sex god had to redeem man without sex and then give him divine power over the sin nature the original human race was corrupted through the serpent's seat as the sin nature was passed down to every person from their parents job 14 verse 1 says man that is born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble the same truth is found in psalms 51 verse 5. behold i was shaping in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me god's lamb his son jesus christ had to come to earth through virgin birth to bypass the way sin came into the world sexual reproduction since the sin nature wasn't passed down to jesus he could live a sinless life instead of a sin nature jesus had a word nature in his body because he was conceived of the holy ghost jesus was the word made flesh the purpose of the virgin birth was twofold prepare a sinless lamb sacrifice to pay for all sins and begin a new human race the first fold is magnified in revelation 5 verses 1 through 10 in which no man in heaven or on earth was found worthy to lose the seven seals until the virgin-born lamb of god came forward to take the book our redeemer had to be virgin born without the serpent's sin nature inside him jesus's virgin birth allowed for a new human race to begin in revelation 3 verse 14 jesus says he is the beginning of the creation of god and paul says jesus is the firstborn among many brethren meaning jesus was the first among many to experience the new birth every born-again believer today has mighty holy ghost power in their souls like jesus said after jesus received the indwelling power of the holy ghost at his river jordan baptism he was led into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil jesus's new soul power was going to be tested in jesus's threefold temptation he defeated the same spirit who defeated eve by simply quoting and obeying the word god was proving his gift of the holy ghost baptism could withstand satan's strongest attacks even though eve first sinned in a garden her seed foretold in genesis 3 verse 15 through the power of the holy ghost baptism would eventually crush the head of the serpent in another garden gethsemane jesus preached about the new birth and urged his disciples to receive it because it would be their inward power to become a new creature from the inside out spirit-filled christians still battle the sin nature in their members but the word nature in their souls is a greater overcoming power according to first john 4 verse 4 ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world evidence number five adam and eve covered their loins after eating of the forbidden fruit genesis 3 verses 6 and 7 says adam and eve knew they were naked after eating the forbidden fruit and sowed fig leaves to make aprons or loin coverings in hebrew the loins are the area of the human reproductive parts and they covered their private parts because those were the body parts used in their sinful downfall if the forbidden fruit was an apple they would have covered their mouths with figs or soda hood to cover their heads but it was not a literal fruit also if eating apples caused adam and eve to know they were naked why can't we pass out apples to nearly naked women on beaches so they'll know they're near nakedness and put on modest clothes understand eating a natural apple never has and never will bring awareness of sin and evil just like it did for adam and eve sexual sin always produces feelings of shame in nakedness as ezekiel 16 verses 35 through 41 teaches verses 35 and 36 say wherefore o harlot hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god because thy filthiness was poured out and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers nahum 3 verse 5 agrees behold i am against thee saith the lord of hosts and i will discover thy skirts upon thy face and i will show the nations thy nakedness and the kingdoms thy shame jeremiah 13 26 is another witness saying therefore will i discover thy skirts upon thy face that thy shame may appear evidence number six god's punishments for eve's sin centered on her sexual reproduction and longing for adam in genesis 3 verse 16 god issues a two-fold punishment on eve because she was deceived by the serpent unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee the first fold of god's punishment was she would experience multiplied or increased sorrow from the conception of to the delivery of children the first consequence of eve's sin focused on her sexual reproduction of seed or offspring recognized throughout the bible god's punishments or consequences always fit the crimes for example exodus 21 verse 24 says an eye for an eye tooth for a tooth hand for hand foot for foot a second example is david's sin of adultery with bathsheba both punishments fit his crime first the sword of blood would never depart his house because he had uriah's innocent bloodshed second david's wives were taken from him and absalom laid with them publicly because david laid with bathsheba privately in eve's case god was no different than he was with israel and david all women experienced the pain and suffering in bringing forth seed or offspring as a constant universal reminder from god to all of eve's daughters that she willingly received or accepted the wrong seed in the beginning from the serpent since eve broke her marriage covenant and received the wrong seed she would experience suffering bringing forth annie and all seed because e failed in the area of sexual reproduction all women have increased suffering and sexual reproduction if eve ate a literal apple why didn't god punish her mouth and all apple trees god's punishments focused on human reproduction and the body parts of the loins used for that process the second vote of god's punishment upon eve was her desire or longing and craving would be to her own husband as god's punishments fit the crimes he commands eve to desire crave and long for her own husband which means that before god's command eve desired or longed for someone else other than adam you know it was the serpent and the fruit of adultery eve longed for as she was guilty of lust 2 peter 1 verse 4 declares sin entered the world through lust notice adam in genesis 3 verse 20 recognizing eve is pregnant a mother he names her eve because her name means life and he knew she was the mother of all living adam listened to god's words in genesis 3 verse 15 and knew two separate seeds were already living and growing inside of eve's womb and she would be the mother of all living persons whether they were good or evil when eve received the wrong seed the serpent's seed she became a mother the mother denomination the roman catholic church did the same she became the blind mother church by receiving satan's lies his seed of discrepancy most readers think genesis 4 verse 1 is the first mention of sexual reproduction but adam's naming eve as a mother in genesis 3 verse 20 proof genesis 3 verse 6 is the first mention of intercourse spoken figuratively previous to adam naming her eve had no individual name for god called both adam and his wife adam according to genesis 5 verse 2 male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created eve's fall from her united name with adam shows how false churches make their own names catholic methodist baptists etc but the true bride church is restored back to sharing a name with her husband jesus for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named evidence number seven the serpent was human-like before the fall careful bible study about the serpent in genesis 3 reveals he was very different than snakes today so different in fact he had three human-like attributes first verse 1 says the serpent was more subtle meaning shrewd sly or crafty than any other beast of the field that the lord had made he was the only beast god made with the ability to talk with intellectual reasoning observing those human-like characteristics satan selected the serpent to possess so he could deceive eve as he was present in eden satan and his demons often possess animals or beasts as matthew 8 verses 31-32 teaches second the serpent was an upright creature before the fall because after the fall in verse 14 god curses the serpent to go on his belly the rest of his days originally the serpent was likely in between a chimpanzee and a man but closer to a man standing upright and able to carry an intellectual conversation with the deceived eve third the serpent had seed that united with eve's egg cell causing her to conceive the serpent's own seed according to god in genesis 3 verse 15. because of this god cursed the serpent he changed every bone in the serpent's body so that he had to crawl on the ground but left genetic information in the serpent as proof of his punishment in october 2015 the university of georgia discovered snakes once had legs researchers reported snakes have dna that controls the development and growth of limbs two years later my children read about this finding in a national geographic kids magazine which said snakes once had legs friend god's word and its revelation even in regards to snakes and the serpent seed is eternally true evidence number eight cain was the serpent's son and not adams according to the holy spirit in 1st john 3 verse 12 cain was not the son of adam not his cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous as shown earlier the wicked one refers to satan not adam since adam is called a son of god in luke 3 verse 38. here you find the truth of two separate seed lines atoms and the serpents eve's womb carried two different seeds or sons from separate impregnations she carried twins with cain's conception sometime previous to abel's to those who think that this is impossible you need only study super fecundation as mentioned in the july 1994 journal of forensic sciences article these two separate seeds had separate characteristics adam's seed was blessed in genesis 5 verse 2 and matthew 25 34 while the serpent seed was cursed in genesis 4 verse 11 and matthew 25 41 concerning curses god himself cursed both the serpent and cain and all lost humanity who are sent to the lake of fire are called the cursed note god did not curse adam and eve because he cannot both curse and bless his children according to numbers 22 verse 12. instead the ground was cursed for adam's sake in genesis 3 verse 17. cain's seed life bore the full spiritual characteristics of satan for he was a liar and murder just like his daddy in genesis 4 verses 8 and 9 and john 8 verse 44. due to their opposite characteristics god gave cain a separate lineage from atoms one crucial point of emphasis is the two physical genetic seed lines of adam and cain are no longer separate in the days of noah the literal seed of the serpent passed through the ark through the marriages of noah's sons and has now intermingled with the godly seed all mankind are currently affected by the genetic pollution of the serpent seed since the generations after the flood until today god's seed is known by the reception of spiritual seed faith in their souls and not a natural genetic seed abraham and lot had righteous souls when receiving the seed word of god's promise by faith in the new testament god's blessed seed are recognized by the fact they are born again of the incorruptible seed the word of god the holy ghost seal in their souls evidence number nine the seed of the woman was a literal man jesus and so was the seed of the serpent a literal man cain nearly all believers agree the seed of the woman spoken in genesis 3 verse 15 was jesus christ a literal man who bruised the serpent's head through his death and resurrection victory over sin and death if the woman seed jesus was a man child born apart from human male instrumentality the seed of the serpent would have to come in the same pattern kane fits this pattern as he was a literal man who came into the world apart from human male instrumentality he came through the male serpent seed as the seed of the woman jesus was god's way to produce his word nature in the human race since satan does not have creative power like god genesis 3 shows how he injected his wicked sin nature into the human race through cain the serpent's seed genesis 4 verse 1 is the literal interpretation of the symbolism in genesis 3 verse 6. genesis 4 verse 1 is often used to try to disprove the serpent's seed but god's revelation shows how it fits into the truth of original sin it reads and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord everyone understands the word new means sexual relations but this verse is only a repeat of genesis 3 verse 6 where an eve shares the fruit with adam the previous nine evidences support this for the fruit of adultery and eve sexual relations with adam produced two seeds genesis 4 verse 1 repeats genesis 3 verse 6 with a literal interpretation along with further information about the act including cain's name and gender simply put genesis 3 verse 6 is symbolic and genesis 4 verse 1 is literal the bible often switches from symbolic to literal interpretation as easily seen in revelation chapters 17 and 18. chapter 17 verses 3 and 4 symbolically describe a seven-headed beast and an evil woman but their literal interpretations are found in chapter 17 verse 9 and chapter 18 verse 10 as the seven heads mean seven mountains and the woman represents a city additionally genesis has multiple events repeated in succeeding chapters with additional information provided such as in chapters 1 and 2. genesis 1 verses 26-31 records mankind's creation on day 6 but genesis 2 verse 7 and verses 21-22 gives more information about the same event by detailing how god created adam and eve's bodies from the dust of the earth and breathe life into them before moving on believers do not need to accept the serpent-seed doctrine to be saved since it does not pertain to salvation justification by faith is the doctrine needed for salvation but the servancy doctrine shines more light upon the gospel story taking away the confusion about original sin knowing the forbidden fruit was adultery not an apple helps you understand why god sent jesus christ via virgin birth sin came into the world through sex so our deliver from sin's curse had to be virgin born and free from the sin nature in order to take all our iniquities upon him and pay our sin debt iniquity's attributes in satan and kane having found iniquity starting place in lucifer's heart and his injection of his nature into the human race in cain you witness iniquity's six attributes although there could be more armed with this knowledge you must discern and withstand the wicked one his demons and his human children while diligently doing opposite works first the lawless go through vain beautiful religious acts and create their own traditions it's uncertain how long lucifer helped lead heaven's worship while having iniquity in his heart but it's certain he went through some acts in vain his words from isaiah 14 verse 14 prove he wanted the religious worship to continue but with him as the object and recipient cain in a religious act brought a beautiful colorful offering of fruits fully aware it was not what god required to onlookers his fruit may have looked more classy pious and beautiful than abel's bloody lamb offering but god rejected it satan always hides behind worldly beauty while god hides in simplicity jesus had no beauty that we should desire him genesis 4 verses 6 and 7 show the lord questioning cain about his anger regarding his rejected offering saying he'd accept him if he only offered the correct sacrifice cain went through his religious act willingly and stubbornly disobedient religious acts are often masks the wicked hide behind the serpent hid his agenda behind a religious promise for eve to become like god recall jesus saying false doctrine is hidden among truth like yeast is mixed in dough in his parable on the leaven hid in three measures of meal more will be taught on the religion mask later in this chapter paul teaches workers of iniquity have a form of godliness or outward resemblance of godliness in second timothy 3 verses 1-7 outwardly they look holy but are void of inward holiness never coming to believe all the truth the apostle says they slowly corrupt themselves and others like leavens slow spreading by creeping into houses and leading families into lustful indulgences iniquity-filled worshipers like kane create their own traditions to teach and live by rather than adhering to gods matthew 15 captures jesus christ rebuking the scribes and pharisees for transgressing god's commands by their traditions he says their worship is vain because they teach man-made commands instead of scripture jewish leaders in jesus day were using the oral law later organized and called the mishnah in 3rd century a.d to interpret the written law of moses nearly all modern churches create their own mishnas called bylaws and creeds being equally guilty of transgressing god's word by their sinful traditions thus you can say all bible denying man-made religions and denominations started in genesis through cain's example no matter how religious a person seems discern his heart to see if he believes the truth which leads to the next attribute iniquity workers do not abide in the truth and therefore despise it jesus describes satan accordingly saying he abode not in the truth lucifer left his original heavenly position and cain left his family after murdering abel cain was marked by god and went out from the presence of the lord first john 2 verses 18 and 19 says antichrists iniquity workers leave groups of true worshipers saying they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us concerning cain's mark you already learned the mark of the beast is received when a person rejects god's mark the baptism of the holy ghost for the final time paul calls this a reprobate mind in three instances cain despised the truth about offerings being wroth because god required blood rather than his fruit offering paul says the perishing unrighteous ones despise the truth that could save them in 2 thessalonians 2 verse 10 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved you must love the truth and abide in it third the lawless deny the full power of the holy spirit god's spirit urged cain to repent while reminding him the spirit could empower him to rule over his brother if he only obeyed but cain denied the spirit's work jesus explains in matthew 7 verses 21-27 workers of iniquity accept temporary power to perform miracles in his name but reject god's power to help them do his will in their daily habits acts 7 51 shows stephen rebuking the israeli high priest and jewish council because they always resisted the holy ghost despite their religious acts paul says they're guilty of denying the power of godliness despite having its outward resemblance christianity's power is faith in jesus blood as hebrews 13 verses 20 21 says the blood of the everlasting covenant makes you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through jesus christ the holy spirit is the life of jesus blood so when you obey the spirit you're accepting the power of the blood fourth satan's children lie jesus says satan is a liar and the father of lies in john 8 44 cain lied to our holy god in genesis 4 verse 9 claiming he didn't know where abel was after murdering him in a field second peter 2 verse 19 declares false preachers promise hears blessings they themselves never attain revelation 21 verse 8 teaches unrepentant liars are cast alive into the lake of fire fifth the wicked persecute and kill the righteous lucifer verbally accused heaven's leadership before waging his losing campaign to persecute angels and overthrow heaven his accusations against believers continue without ceasing day and night according to revelation 12 verse 10. kane committed the first murder rising up against his brother abel and slaying him in a field in matthew 23 verses 34 and 35 jesus distinguishes the act of murder as a key trait when recognizing the serpent seed saying that upon you may come all the righteous bloodshed upon the earth from the blood of righteous abel unto the blood of zacharias son of barackias whom he slew between the temple and altar christ says the pharisees are guilty of all the bloodshed from abel to zacharias that's compounded guilt from four thousand years worth of martyrs while unrepentant murderers will surely perish jesus says many are in danger of hell fire for harboring unjust anger against others even if they never hurt anyone this shows a sinner can murder someone in their heart even without committing the violent act worldly sorrow versus godly sorrow or true repentance sixth satan's seed sorrows over their sins but never repents paul calls this worldly sorrow and it needs its own section workers of iniquity feel bad after sinning but never repent and change their behavior there's no record of wicked cain expressing godly sorrow for murdering abel but he does express worldly sorrow after god curses him from the earth sentencing him to become a fugitive and vagabond the pitiful lying wretched cain is only sorry for himself complaining about his punishment for murder having no remorse for his dead brother serpent seed only care for themselves in his second letter to the corinthians paul rejoices that his first letter made them sorrowful unto repentance the apostle distinguishes between two kinds of sorrow worldly and godly now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death sorrow is emotional pain or grief both sinners and saints experience after sinning god builds this painful conviction into every human spirit called conscience along with a soul thirst and no god so there are no excuses on judgment day souls who choose hell are worthy of its torment because they refused to respond correctly to their sorrow rather than forsaking their sin and accepting our loving god's forgiveness they chose to hate holiness fight against and blaspheme it god strives with man sometimes for decades but if a man won't repent the lord gives him over to believe the lies he loves paul writes and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness repentance is the goal of painful emotional sorrow true repentance is threefold a change of mind and behavior making amends for sin and hating sin the first son in jesus's parable of two sons asked to work in their father's vineyard displays a change of mind and behavior initially the first son refused his father's command to work but repented and did the work zacchaeus models making amends for sins as he pledges to restore fourfold the amount he'd gain by false accusation paul saved and born again admits hating his sins he sometimes committed jude 1 verse 23 says to hate any sin defilement in our lives hating even the garment spotted by the flesh worldly sorrow is deceiving because a sinner exudes emotion feeling awful for a sins but the threefold requirement for repentance or the fruits meat for repentance is never visible in his life sadly i've witnessed worldly sorrow firsthand twice praying at an altar with an emotional man for a combined three hours only to see him immediately return to his wickedness bible examples of worldly sorrow include pharaoh called a vessel unto destruction admitted his sin against the lord on multiple occasions even asking moses to bless him but continually harden his heart after each admission of guilt exodus 8 verse 15 chapter 9 verse 27 chapter 10 verse 26 chapter 12 32 and romans 9 verses 14 through 27. balaam admitted his sin in going to balak when he talked with the angel of the lord yet was permitted to go on account of his love for money and was later slain by israel numbers 22 34 chapter 31 verse 8 2 peter 2 verses 12 through 22 aiken acknowledged his sin against the lord but in his fierce anger was stoned and burnt by israel joshua 7 verses 16-26 king saul admitted his sins of rebellion and stubbornness against god to the prophet samuel yet spent years hunting david's life until his repentance shortly before his death and salvation first samuel 15 verses 10 through 31 chapter 26 verse 21 and chapter 28 verse 19. ahab upon hearing god's assessment of his abominable idolatrous and wicked life temporarily humbled himself with fasting and rent clothes but soon returned to his hatred for holiness and died in shame first kings 21 verses 28-29 chapter 22 verse 8 and verses 29-38 judas iscariot repented and returned the 30 pieces of silver he earned for betraying jesus but went and hung himself sealing his doom matthew 27 verses 3 through 10 acts chapter 1 verse 25 how iniquity originates in and fills human minds as lucifer's example teaches iniquity originates in the heart or mind your mind is your conscience state wherein thinking occurs and decisions are made while your soul is your conscience nature every soul begins with a god-given holy thirst to know god and long for his fellowship so men are without excuse on judgment day like a man ignoring his need to get help from a doctor iniquity begins when a mind ignores its soul's need to know god iniquity workers fill their minds with evil instead of good purposely starving their souls hunger and thirst for holiness when an iniquity-filled sinner makes a final determination he will never submit to his thirst for god's fellowship god gives him over to a reprobate mind also known as the mark of the beast luke 12 verses 16 through 21 records a rich man's decision to silence his soul's thirst for god his crop harvest was so great he had to decide to store up treasure for himself or god sadly he chose personal treasures his mind said to his soul soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry jesus calls him a fool because he should have given his extra food to others which would have resulted in heavenly treasure rather than selfishly saving it for himself all acts of disobedience are done by evil spirits influencing human minds eve is the first human example of disobeying god's word after letting her mind be influenced by the serpent's lie paul supports this in ephesians 2 verse 2 saying sinners walk according to satan's fallen angels or spirits that now work in the children of disobedience evil spirits cause humans to do evil works as a believer your spirit works by love and faith according to galatians 5 6. ephesians 2 verse 3 says we are all guilty at one point of fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others your body mind and soul all have desires you know the body and mind only have evil desires so god's children crucify the desires of the body and mind and bring them into subjection to the holy desires of their souls galatians 5 24 reads and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts people commit sins after yielding their minds to harbor and accept evil thoughts devils annoy and live in their minds indeed their minds become a home for devils which paul warns us of in ephesians 4 verse 27 saying neither give place to the devil then paul calls demon-controlled minds strongholds in second corinthians 10 verse 4 for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds the wicked have spiritual castles or fortresses set up by demons in their minds sinners willingly let fallen angels live in and control their minds they are guilty of thinking the bible has errors god doesn't heal anymore sexual sins have no consequences or god doesn't exist the mighty weapon of god's word is the only power that can bring down these fortresses after a person sins once it's easier to commit the same sin the next time sinning becomes a habit evil habits are from evil spirits just as the opposite is true godly habits are from the holy spirit matthew 12 verses 25 through 30 illustrates godly habits being spoiled or ruined by devils entering once strong minds the lord likens a believer to a man dwelling in his house stocked with goods demons then enter the house and steal the goods christ is saying a strong believer can possess goods or habits of his kingdom but have those habits stolen by opening the door of his mind to lies and deceitful thoughts paul urges us not to give heed or open the door to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils don't allow yourself to think evil thoughts jesus teaches the strong man or faith is bound by a devil and then the house is plundered a devil who constantly robs believers today is the evil spirit of fear second timothy 1 verse 7 teaches us fear causes weakness hatred and mind trouble because god's spirit gives the opposite power love and a sound mind the fear demon paralyzes faith robbing your confidence in god like israel's fear of the giants while at kadesh barnia numbers chapter 14 shows the evil report of the ten spies caused fear to spread like wildfire among the israelis despite caleb and joshua's valiant attempt to raise faith it was too late fear demons had already spoiled israel's spiritual goods friend don't allow satan to steal your confidence joy strength song victory or faith imagine every evil thought satan brings you as a box of poisonous snakes a delivery man wants you to sign for in the natural it's your american right to deny any package sent to your door just because someone sent you death doesn't mean you have to accept it if the box is left at your door don't bring it inside take it to the burn pile and ignite it in jesus name just as paul shook the serpent off himself and cast it into the fire satan is sending lies to billions today and when he sends you death turn him down by quoting god's word resist the devil and he will flee keep your mind free from corruption or defilement as paul says in second corinthians 11 verse 3 give your mind over completely to jesus and his words speak the truth in love and season your words with grace rather than bitterness he says men of corrupt minds are destitute of truth specifically resist truth and hold perverted disputes renewing your mind is the way to keep corrupt thoughts from ruling your mind you can't help from thinking evil thoughts but you can cast them away like a farmer you can't keep birds from nesting in your barn but you can drive them out once you're aware of their presence second corinthians 10 verses 5 and 6 teaches your god-given control over thoughts will lead to obedience casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled revelation 12 verses 10 and 11 teaches you overcome satan by two things jesus's blood and your verbal testimony jesus blood provides redemption and total forgiveness when you confess your sins your verbal testimony is speaking or swinging god's word sword against satan and his demons like jesus cutting down satan's temptations in matthew 4 by saying it is written you cut down satan's traps by obeying the word and rebuking satan he failed in this the battlefield of the mind but you can overcome the only way you know you're an overcomer is by overcoming so daily confess your sins and defeat satan by speaking god's word and casting down his deceitful lies it doesn't matter what you have to overcome as long as you know how to overcome because god's word is the greatest power in the universe stockpiles of scriptures say the evil are full of darkness meaning their minds are totally full of evil thoughts peter condemns these beastly-minded sinners saying they have eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls and heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed children they fill their minds with debauchery and habitually sin if you are filled with a love for god's word you'll serve him but if you hate truth you'll be full of darkness and serve the world according to jesus but if thine i be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon paul describes the minds of homosexuals in a similar manner saying their minds knew god's word but refused to retain it therefore god gave them over to a rejected or reprobate mind being filled with all unrighteousness for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their heir which was meat and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers backbiters haters of god deceitful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents without understanding covenant breakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them the iniquity-filled scribes pharisees and sadducees lucifer and cain were religious but their acts were eventually meaningless their iniquity-filled hearts hid behind religious masks until their true colors were manifest fast forward to jesus's earthly ministry and the scribes pharisees and sadducees repeat the same religious vanity two portions of scripture highlight the depths of iniquity in these groups jesus sermon on the mount and his eight woes discourse against them in the week leading up to his crucifixion matthew chapters 5 through 7 contained the most details on jesus sermon on the mount partially taught in private to his disciples but also to a great audience in chapter 5 jesus's beatitudes emphasized blessings upon spiritual purity his disciples were to keep and teach his commands in sincerity and their righteousness was to exceed that of the pharisees the legalist popular religious party of the day our lord magnifies moses law giving insight on anger mental lust adultery swearing resisting not evil giving and loving enemies matthew chapter 6 records jesus's three attacks on religious hypocrites residing in jewish synagogues which would include the aforementioned pharisees messiah blasts hypocritical almsgiving praying and fasting urging believers to do more secret service in god's sight instead of public service in man's sight public worship reformed for man's praise yields no heavenly reward jesus shows the religious hypocrites really serve mammon or riches and not god true worshipers seek first jesus kingdom rather than basic human needs in matthew chapter 7 jesus's fourth hypocritical charge is on those who judge others despite being guilty of the same sins our lord promises to hear our prayers and proclaims the golden rule fulfills the law and the prophets chapter 7 ends with a sobering concise contrast between true and false religion jesus says there are two gates two ways two kinds of prophets two trees with separate fruits and two kinds of builders using two different foundations the two builders workers of iniquity and wise workers express the difference between sayers versus doers iniquity-filled builders give god lip service saying lord lord but fail to do god's will wise workers perform god's will as chapter 11 of this book pursues in depth the few wise workers seek find and enter the straight or narrow gate leading to eternal life most people choose the easy to find broad way as workers of iniquity whose end is destruction in the lake of fire both types of prophets look like sheep but the workers of iniquity are greedy wolves inwardly they're also likened to corrupt trees known by their corrupt fruits or sinful deeds verses 21-23 revealed a shocking truth that wolf preachers temporarily have god's genuine anointing for legitimate miracles and signs but spend most of their lives in disobedience and habitual sin jesus specifically denounces their works as they did not keep god's laws proof of knowing jesus is obeying him and working righteousness in verses 24 through 27 jesus says you build your life upon a solid rock by hearing and doing his commands chapter 5 of this book identifies this rock as genuine divine faith wisely listening to jesus helps you add virtue to your faith then knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and charity spiritual rains and floods cannot destroy this kind of life in contrast a life built on loose sinful sandy living comes to desolation in the storms of life great is the fall of the lying testimonies of religious wolves matching the great falling away predicted in the end days when the antichrist is revealed moving on to matthew 23 you read jesus's scathing discourse of eight woes against the scribes and pharisees one chapter after he silenced their foolish questions observe jesus in verse 28 saying they are full of hypocrisy and iniquity that said messiah calls them children of hell serpents and a generation of vipers they are the demon-possessed spiritual seed of the serpent a woe is an exclamation of grief in the greek and jesus eight woes for their hypocrisy include woe for not entering jesus's kingdom and keeping others out chapter 23 verse 13 woe for devouring widows money and offering long pretend prayers chapter 23 verse 14 woe for worldwide travel to make doubly wicked hell-bound converts chapter 23 verse 15 woe for swearing or making invalid oaths while exalting religious gifts for selfish gain chapter 23 verses 16-22 woe for straining over or over-emphasizing details of commands while omitting the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith chapter 23 verses 23 and 24 woe for dressing clean and holy while being inwardly dirty full of robbery and incontinence chapter 23 verse 25 woe for being like cleaned whited gravestones yet being full of death uncleanness hypocrisy and iniquity woe for honoring dead prophets yet disobeying them and being children of their murderers chapter 23 verses 29-33 jesus ends this discourse by promising to send his true servants prophets wise men and scribes to these hypocrites some of whom they will kill as always the guilt of bloodshed would be upon the workers of iniquity our lord laments for the entire city of jerusalem whom god tried to bring close to him but they would not love him back there they crucified him and crucifying jesus afresh four words in luke 23 33 there they crucified him hold depths of meaning to the mystery of iniquity in context the words reveal the extreme wickedness workers of iniquity stoop to there in jerusalem the city of god the most holy place on earth they the world's most powerful government rome in agreement with israelis the most holy people on earth crucified the world's most gruesome tortuous painful death him the world's most holy innocent perfect person jesus you read it right the most religious people commit the most wicked crimes against the most holy person they claim to love israel god's own people came to this truth-hating condition by sins slow spreading and all-encompassing effects pride covetousness and complete spiritual corruption overcame israel's leaders and people shockingly the hebrews author teaches christ is constantly crucified afresh by individuals who publicly disgrace jesus did you know jesus is crucified daily not physically but spiritually because workers of iniquity disobey truth and teach others to do the same hebrews 6 verses 1 through 8 explains christ is presently crucified by ones who temporarily experience god's blessings only to publicly disobey jesus's teachings at a later time verse 6 says apostates crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame in god's eyes these rebellious ones are like thorn bushes who rejoice in receiving rain but produce sharp prickly thorns likewise the religious lawless enjoy the blessings and feelings of god's spirit but commit sharp despicable iniquities they are like judas publicly kissing jesus in betrayal for selfish benefit hebrews 10 verse 29 describes their crucifixion of truth as smashing it under their feet of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace sore punishments await those who deny the spirit's work of continuous sanctification god's gracious holy spirit leads us to a sanctified life not a sinful disobedient life this proves one can temporarily receive god's grace but then fail to let it continue its cleansing work grace never fails believers but workers of iniquity can fail grace by rejecting it follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled multitudes of preachers currently crucify the effects of the holy spirit by denying the true interpretation of god's word yes the ones who mention the cross are often the enemies of the cross for their god is their belly and wallet they deny the power needed to live a holy life giving license for immorality while presenting an outwardly clean wealthy appearance jude 1 verse 4 foretold the wicked would turn grace into lawlessness paul says from such turn away real christians do experience daily crucifixion dying daily like paul to their selfish desires jesus urgently requires daily cross caring in luke 9 23 paul says proof of you belonging to christ is that you crucify and mortify the deeds and lust of the flesh and the world you'll either crucify god's word or crucify your selfish lusts with god's word christians kill their own sinful wills so they can perform god's will the mystery of iniquity continued working in paul's day through many antichrists jesus's iniquity-filled religious opponents succeeded in killing him but he resurrected and filled his followers with the holy ghost in power christ's followers have battled the workers of iniquity ever since paul says the mystery of iniquity a sin-loving religious guise was already working at the time he wrote second thessalonians around 51 a.d he said it would continue until heading up in that wicked person the antichrist as second thessalonians 2 verses 7 and 8 proclaims for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming a few antichrist doctrines paul rebuked include a legalistic requirement for circumcision declaring the rapture already occurred required abstinence from marriage and meat eating paul goes as far as saying the iniquity-filled church-goers hate sound doctrine keeping to themselves false teachers who tickle their ears and turn them from truth to believe fables nearly 50 years later in 100 a.d the apostle john gave the workers of iniquity a new label antichrists first john 2 verse 18 declares little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time in the greek lexicon antichrists means adversaries of the messiah john continues describing antichrists saying they eventually leave true churches deny jesus as the christ deny the father and son and fail to confess jesus christ has come in the flesh the world's 1.5 billion muslims one billion hindus and millions of buddhists atheists and agnostics all deny jesus as the christ proving they are antichrists but more scripture needs examined to see how many of the 2 billion professing christians are antichrists as well recognizing antichrists by their hell-deserving and non-kingdom works antichrists abound today as paul foretold their drastic increase waxing worse and worse but promised the holy scriptures would make us wise unto salvation in second timothy 3 verses 13-15 in addition to jesus's previously mentioned descriptions of the lawless you recognize modern antichrists by their hell-deserving and non-kingdom works revelation 21 verses 7 and 8 2 peter 2 verses 9 through 22 and jude 1 verses 1 through 25 lists specific sins of hellbound souls you'll see some overlap in the list and i'm leaving repeats for emphasis of course all these sins can be repented of so souls can be saved but jesus says few will choose the narrow way leading to life in revelation 21 john says the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murders and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone peter's second epistle lists the following hell deserving acts walking in fleshly lusts despising government being self-willed speaking evil of good adultery sin addiction coveting loving money forsaking the right way serving corruption unbridled lusts and other pollutions of the world jude's powerful chapter tallies these damning acts turning grace into lawlessness fornication sinfully defiling one's flesh despising dominion speaking evil of dignities corrupting oneself greed not fearing god shameful violence wandering ungodly deeds hard speeches murmuring complaining walking after one's own lusts and mocking antichrists act in opposition to the kingdom of god and paul provides three texts to identify their non-kingdom works to eliminate any confusion about who is in jesus kingdom and who isn't first corinthians 6 verses 9 through 11 galatians 5 verses 19 through 26 and ephesians 5 verses 1 through 8. greek definitions in parentheses follow unfamiliar words for understanding in the corinthians text paul says be not deceived the following unrighteous works of iniquity will not inherit the kingdom of god fornicators sex before marriage idolaters adulterers sex with someone other than your first spouse effeminate child molesters abusers of themselves with mankind homosexuals thieves covetous drunkards revilers or complainers and extortioners or robbers verse 11 rejoices believers hearts though as it magnifies jesus's cleansing power from guilt of these sins and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god in galatians 5 paul says people who commit the following without repentance shall not inherit the kingdom of god adultery fornication uncleanness or lustful luxurious living leschiviousness or unbridled lust idolatry witchcraft which includes drug use hatred variance or contention emulations or rivalry jealousy wrath strife or electioneering for office seditions or divisions heresies man-made tenets envyings murders drunkenness revelings or late night parties and such like paul's ephesians letter warns the following acts give one no inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god fornication uncleanness or lustful luxurious living covetousness or greedy desire to have more filthiness or immoralities foolish talking jesting or evil humor whoremongering or all unlawful sex unclean persons or evil thoughts and acts idolaters and speakers of vain words or those devoid of truth the reality is most church members are antichrist following antichrist preachers who legalize and commit the preceding list of sins many antichrist preachers flaunt their greed adulteries and sins publicly putting christ to an open shame flee from any preacher and church that condones any of the sins you just read just as jesus attacked every aspect of worship of the pharisees and scribes the holy spirit rebukes every worship aspect of modern workers of iniquity because they are demon influenced only evil works flow from their evil hearts corrupt trees only produce corrupt fruit antichrist preachers build their own self-serving kingdoms and ultimately destroy men's souls recall chapter 7's teaching about the four horse riders in the first four seals of revelation chapter 6 verses 1 through 8. the horse riders are the self-same person the antichrist spirit his four-step process for kingdom building and dominion is conquering through deception killing money capturing and worldwide soul destruction demon-filled preachers build their kingdoms through the same steps first they deceive with false doctrine allowing listeners to indulge in their sinful lusts second they kill the reputations of true preachers and christians third they elicit millions of dollars in financial support from their blind followers megachurches and mega bank accounts soon come afterwards fourth they lead their worshipers into the unredeemable condition of having reprobate minds all blind preachers will lead their blind followers into union with the mother harlot the roman catholic church remember god has saved preachers and church members in every organization but they are few and far between of the saved most are foolish denying the full revelation of scripture as chapter 4 details 15 of paul's simple sound doctrines most churches deny in the section judging christian groups and denominations by their fruits look how religious catholics are and how beautiful their churches stand in architectural majesty yet many of their teachings are abominable the same can be applied to many lutherans methodists baptists pentecostals and independents only a small wise group will believe and live all jesus's new testament commands abounding iniquity in the end times in the years leading up to jesus's return in the rapture iniquity will abound to its greatest measure in the antichrist groups causing genuine love for god to be extremely rare jesus announces this in matthew 24 verses 11-13 and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved paul gives the same warning in second timothy 3 verse 13 but evil men and seducers shall act worse and worse deceiving and being deceived america's churches work the worst iniquity as revelation chapter 13 verses 11 through 18 shows their future union with the government in issuing the official mark of the beast which will unleash massive death upon the whole world ezekiel 16 49 and revelation 3 verses 14 through 19 show israel and modern christians falling into iniquity by the same means pride abundance of goods and idleness laodiceans are lukewarm and prideful saying they have no more need of god due to their riches and increased goods let us be hungry and thirsty for more divine righteousness while busily working for the kingdom of god chapter 12 section called the conditions or times and seasons of the rapture provides further description of the times we are living in so you can know how to escape antichrists the trail of the serpent and spiritual twins you can trace the trail of the serpent a phrase used by larkin from eden in genesis all the way to gog and magog in revelation satan's spirit the antichrist spirit closely observes then insincerely imitates the true believer's behavior in order to deceive the masses spiritual twins emerge off the pages of the bible one is god's child and the other is satan's the lord jesus christ provides two proofs of this battle of the twins beginning in matthew 13 verses 24 through 30 and verses 36 through 43 with his wheat and tares parable tares poisonous to eat closely resemble wheat and are only distinguished by their failure to bow at harvest time this signifies their defiance against and failure to obey god's word tares live among the wheat like the wicked can worship right alongside the righteous jesus second mention of spiritual twins is matthew 24 24 for there shall rise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect false christs are temporarily anointed by the genuine holy spirit but their heretical teachings and sin-loving lives reveal their true seed of discrepancy paul says the reason god allows evil men to spread heresies is to reveal the two distinct groups of the twins in first corinthians 11 verse 19. for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you only the elect children of god will not be deceived by the antichrist because they are born again of the spirit of truth the holy ghost the evil twins always exhibit the six iniquity attributes vain religion rejecting and despising the truth denying the full power of the holy spirit lying persecuting and killing the righteous and worldly sorrow jesus uses the evil twins fifth attribute murderous to trace the serpent's trail from cain's murder of abel to the pharisees of his lifetime wherefore behold i send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them ye shall kill and crucify and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous abel unto the blood of zacharias son of barackias whom he slew between the temple and the altar notice christ assuring us the serpent seed would keep murdering even after his ascension to heaven thus throughout mankind's six thousand year history the trail of the serpent is forever stained with the blood of jewish and christian martyrs watch the serpent silently slither through history beginning in heaven and then moving to earth the first set of twins were lucifer and michael both were exalted holy angels until iniquity caused lucifer to battle against his twin in a losing effort on earth the first set of twins was the tree of life jesus spirit and the tree of knowledge of good and evil satan the serpent adam were the next twins but eve's sin in longing for the serpent rather than her own husband began mankind's sin slavery next came cain and abel both offering worship to god but in jealousy cain killed his twin cain's tare children multiply with such abundance that god destroys nearly all living things with the flood shem and ham noah's sons are the next set of spiritual twins as ham was cursed by his father but shem's descendant was abraham the father of the faith abraham was separated out of the remnant of tares from the tower of babel movement and you see twins rise again in his grandchildren esau and jacob esau like cain profanes god by forsaking his firstborn rights to spiritual leadership while jacob eagerly snatches the birthright blessing and connection to the messiah god's true prophet moses next battled multiple tares including janus jambras balaam korah and dathan balaam despite accurately prophesying through his knowledge on how to contact god proved he was a terror when he lured thousands of israelis into sexual immorality at bail pior aiken joshua's twin showed his tare nature by lustfully harboring forbidden treasures while dwelling with israel's victorious army the serpent's trail leads to the days of israel's kings micaiah god's true prophet stood upon truth against 400 tare prophets anointed with a lying spirit the same lying spirit anointed the false prophet hananiah in the days of israel's final king zedekiah whom the wheat prophet jeremiah withstood the new testament opens with the serpent slithering into its pages as john the baptist identifies and rebukes the generation of vipers pharisees and sadducees who attended his services but refused his baptism unto repentance in like manner jesus chides the same religious impersonating tares calling them ye serpents e generation of vipers in matthew 23 33 as a prefigure to the future final person of the pope antichrist judas iscariot is jesus's twin temporarily serving with christ in the power of the spirit for over three years until his satan-filled heart of iniquity betrays christ for thirty pieces of silver observe satan silently slithering into jesus's inner circle jesus was incarnate god and judas became incarnate satan both peter and paul contended with evil spiritual twins god's spirit helped peter discern ananias satan-filled heart that sprang up shortly after the outpouring of the holy ghost baptism in acts 5 3 paul like christ and judas was betrayed and forsaken by demas who loved this present world as proof god's love was not in his heart the apostle john was falsely accused and rejected by prideful diotriphes who loveth to have the preeminence among them finally you reach the prophesied end of the serpent in the book of revelation chapter 7 in this book shows how the serpent morphed into an antichrist horse rider violently writing through the times of the gentiles or seven church ages revelation chapters 19 and 20 show satan's final two attempts at conquering jesus's kingdom in the battles of armageddon and gog and magog respectively revelation 19 finds satan possessing the pope's body and reigning as the world flattering and world ruling antichrist during the tribulation he gathers nations kings and captains for the battle of armageddon as a sort of rematch between satan's army and michaels but this time christ leads heaven's invasion of earth jesus army of white horse riders breaks through the skies and the sword word from jesus's mouth destroys the pope antichrist's armies birds eat until full with the flesh of these reprobates the beast spirit of rome and false prophet antichrist pope are both cast alive into the lake of fire revelation 20 shows satan's final climatic attempt at defeating heaven's king king jesus after one thousand years of confinement the old serpent is loose from the bottomless pit deceiving and gathering all nations whose number is as the sand of the sea christ's jerusalem dwelling bride finds herself completely surrounded and outnumbered but her help comes from above heavenly fire descends and burns the wicked psalms 57 3 rings true he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up see la god shall send forth his mercy and his truth satan is tossed into the lake of fire to be continually tormented day and night with satan tormented in the lake of fire the mystery of iniquity is defeated and brought to an end all accounts will be settled with the impossibility to lie or deny truth in iniquity at the white throne judgment the rewards for receiving the revelation of iniquity those who receive the revelation of the mystery of iniquity enjoy three closely related rewards the first is the blessing of your iniquities being forgiven through confessions of sins with faith in christ cleansing blood god graciously revealed to you the dangers of iniquity and you've repented romans 4 verse 7 excites believers saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered david knew this blessedness expressing it in psalm 32 verse 5. i acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin silah christians know how to genuinely repent from sins admitting their sins while confessing them to the father who guarantees pardon if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness for certain jesus was sent to bless you in turning you away from your iniquities according to acts 3 verse 26 unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities secondly you have the reward of a purified soul after obeying god's commands iniquity makes one forever disobey but you obey god and feel cleaned out in your soul as first peter 1 verse 22 expresses seeing ye have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently a final reward is having the testimony of forever departing from iniquity as an overcomer paul says departing from iniquity is god's foundational seal for his children in second timothy 2 verse 19. nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity everyone has two choices either depart from iniquity or depart from jesus christians choose to depart from all iniquity not some jesus gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works the key to the revelation of the mystery of iniquity is christians are constantly conformed to a holier life being guided into all truth by the inward dwelling of the holy ghost this is the law of the holy spirit making you progressively live more holy like christ did workers of iniquity are lawless becoming progressively more wicked as romans 6 19 tells i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness the consequences for rejecting the revelation of iniquity there are at least four consequences for rejecting the revelation of the mystery of iniquity a first consequence for condoning iniquity is suffering loss of spiritual positions and blessings during life on earth first samuel chapters 2 and 3 record god judging eli's house for his iniquity eli was a priest a descendant of ithamar one of aaron's two remaining sons along with eliezer rather than removing his disobedient and lustful sons from priestly work eli let them continue ministering honoring his sons above god the priestly duties eventually moved solely to eliezer's descendants rather than elise just look around you to see scores of men and women who've fallen from spiritual leadership positions due to unconfessed iniquities israel's unconfessed iniquity caused her slow violent and painful remove from the promised land lamentations details this as chapter 4 verses 6 through 10 shows iniquity brought the removal of god's blessings iniquity brought death by sword starvation and more verse 6 reads for the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of sodom that was overthrown as in a moment and no hand stayed on her just as the saved thief on the cross in jesus day there are many today who commit iniquity but can repent and be saved moments before death they'll have no reward other than being granted eternal life at the white throne god's longsuffering kept these saved from never accepting a reprobate mind thereby keeping them from blaspheming the holy ghost like the saved thief they admit their sin and confess the purity of god's word in their dying moments and will join the surprised saved sheep on jesus's right hand spoken of in matthew 25 verses 31-46 second rejecting this revelation leads a reprobate mind to speak blasphemy against the holy ghost in the greek blasphemy means to speak reproachfully rail at revile jesus says blasphemy or criticism of the holy spirit is an unforgivable sin wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and whosoever speaketh the word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come paul witnessed envy and hate-filled jews in antioch blaspheme his preaching in acts 13 verses 44 through 48. the apostle said the jews blasphemous words judged themselves unworthy of everlasting life causing him to focus on preaching solely to gentiles angry vile criticizers of full gospel holy ghost preaching likewise blasphemed god's spirit today sealing their eternal judgments while living on earth no doubt they'll continue to live in lustful luxurious pleasures but their souls remain dead while alive first timothy chapter 5 verse 6 describes this consequence of being alive naturally but dead to the holy spirit but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth a third consequence is torment in the tribulation for workers of iniquity who live past the day and hour of the rapture once the tribulation period begins they'll suffer god's wrath for rejecting and crucifying the spiritual effects of jesus's blood disobeying the gospel yields the flaming fire of god's vengeance 2 thessalonians 1 verse 8 says in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ finally a fourth consequence is the most dreadful of all the greatest damnation in the lake of fire before the indescribable damnation though is the shock workers of iniquity will experience at the day of judgment the white throne matthew chapter 7 verses 21-23 and chapter 25 verses 41-46 detail this shock as the first text says many will plead with jesus for salvation by reminding him of the miracles they worked in his name during their lives but jesus will say i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity you learn jesus sees through their hypocrisy of knowing enough about god to perform miracles but failing to simply repent from sins and lovingly obey jesus the second text reveals how workers of iniquity focused on satisfying their own sinful lusts rather than serving the needy through six acts feeding the hungry giving drink to the thirsty housing strangers clothing the naked visiting the sick and visiting prisoners the simplest acts of service would have been enough to gain eternal bliss but the self-centered lawless despised the needy and exalted self the lord jesus warns the religious leaders who worked iniquity will receive the greatest damnation in matthew 23 verse 14. woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites free devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation the lake of fire's worst punishments are reserved for religious deceivers who failed to enter into salvation kept others out and failed to warn others as ezekiel 33 verses 6 through 9 and james 3 verse 1 echo the congregations and other hearers who heard but rejected righteousness will also suffer worse than others in matthew 10 verses 13 through 15 jesus says those cities who rejected his disciples preaching will suffer worse than the violent homosexual gang bangers from sodom and gomorrah it's a saddening sobering thought to picture billions upon billions of souls tormented in the lake of fire and brimstone day and night forever and ever in the prince of the holy angels in the lamb all because of their unconfessed iniquity how easily torment could have been avoided by simple humble repentance take this opportunity to bow in prayer confessing any and all iniquities jesus only asks you to acknowledge your sin and depart from them be like jesus love righteousness and hate iniquity then his anointing and power will come upon you and you'll finally feel alive hebrews 1 verse 9 reads thou hast love righteousness and hate iniquity therefore god even thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows conclusion the mystery of iniquity begins and ends with satan the father of iniquity but obedience begins and ends with jesus the son of righteousness and the mystery of godliness christ is author and finisher of our faith indeed satan is a worthy adversary tempter and accuser who comes to steal kill and destroy but jesus is the way truth and the life though all nations and churches work iniquity under the guise of religion your love for the holy spirit the spirit of truth helps you discern imposters and keeps your spirit sincere pure and unmasked without guile in service to jesus psalm 34 verse 2 records this blessed state saying blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile lost souls rejoice in iniquity stubborn rebellion against god but you love obey and rejoice in truth because the love of god is shed in your heart by the holy ghost action steps step 1 purge your heart from all iniquity through confession and faith in jesus blood and ask him for strength to obey all his commands step 2 discern and forsake all association with workers of iniquity following faith charity and peace with them that call on god out of a pure heart step 3 continually examine your spiritual state to ensure sincere growth in grace and knowledge of the lord by letting the spirit guide you into all bible truth um [Music]
