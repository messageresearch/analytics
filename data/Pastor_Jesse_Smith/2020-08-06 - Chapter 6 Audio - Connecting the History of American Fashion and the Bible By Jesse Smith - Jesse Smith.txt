TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 6 connecting the history of american fashion and the bible includes footnotes numbers 316-394 that thou keep this commandment without spot unrebukable until the appearing of our lord jesus christ first timothy 6 14 connecting the history of american fashion to the bible requires an in-depth study this chapter is devoted to this essential endeavor you'll learn when and why americans forsook modesty but first i will share a bit about my personal testimony and research into modesty joyful research researching for this chapter was an absolute labor of love for me and occurred over the course of the past two decades when i first heard about the bible standards for a holy outward appearance in 2001 i was excited to be able to prove to my friends and family that all these new teachings were biblical and historically accurate i wanted everyone to be enlightened by these new bible truths as i had been my enlightenment immediately transformed my own outward appearance as my new love for jesus was most easily expressed in how i could change my appearance to glorify him i was going to hold nothing back i was willing to cut my long hair start covering my thighs by wearing only long pants and abstain from taking off my shirt and showing off my chest as i now reflect upon these changes i can see that they were the natural outworking of the inward change that had already taken place in my heart through the cross of christ for the first time in my life as a new christian and a college student i found trips to the library exhilarating my fiancee now wife and i spent hours digging through university libraries to search its books encyclopedias and almanacs in order to prove all things about a modest outward appearance now i have a three-ring binder filled with the findings as a witness that this nation once honored god's word about modest clothing but is drastically backslidden my joy to research the truths of the bible and connect them to american history came from a long desire i had to serve god as a child i knew god was real in 1988 as a second grade student god supernaturally healed my mother of cancer without any radiation treatments and she is alive today by the mercy of our savior jesus christ after her healing my mother took all six of her children to different churches in the toledo area testifying of god's healing power at each church i heard again and again about the power of jesus christ i always believed in god's power but never experienced repentance for myself during that time in the next decade after my mother was healed i grew into an adolescent passionate about sports rather than christ i selected friends that had the same selfish sinful interests as i and i ran from god's call for my life during this time my mother would faithfully take all six of her children to church every sunday and wednesday many times i wanted to surrender to jesus's call all my life but i could not let go of the world's attractions my change from a sinner to saint did not occur until i moved away from everyone i knew and attended the university of akron i repented of my sins at an athletes in action winter conference in december of 1999 about two years later in the fall of 2001 i heard the truce about a modest outward appearance i learned in amazement the guidelines for modest clothing and how tattoos make up high heels and other accessories were condemned by the bible i thought that if everyone could hear the truth i heard they would quickly repent surely all my female friends and family members would no longer cut their hair wear makeup nor wear pants right all my male friends would never get tattoos nor wear in modest shorts right boy was i wrong next came a separation time between my closest friends and i as my bible beliefs produced a new course of conduct in my life it was painful but essential my best friend at the time wrote to me in an email that the devil was showing me the new doctrines i was believing i felt heartbroken but i could not deny the literal words of the bible about each teaching this separation led to a hunger to understand why the world was in its rebellious condition why wouldn't my friends family and country believe the plain concise words in the holy bible when and why did the masses turn from the holy ways of the lord the search for these answers became the driving motivation behind my library research it seemed god led me to the right library books and even brought them into my education courses i was taking at the university i felt as if god himself was proving to me that his bible standards were the absolute truth and all witnesses pointed to this fact the history of separate garments separate garments for men and women is usually the first noticeable difference between christians and the world my family has lots of first-hand experience with looking different as we have seven females all in skirts and two males both in pants the first record of god requiring separate garments for men and women is found in the book of the law given to moses around 1400 bc god told moses that crossdressing was an abomination a disgusting thing in his sight clothing provided order for gender government and culture without a separation of clothing god knew that seeds of confusion would be planted into the fabric of society these seeds of discrepancy would quickly grow into corruptible fruits which is what we are seeing today through the transgender and lgbt movements these groups have launched a complete assault on god's creative design and order for male and females established from the beginning of creation sadly these modern sodomites will only be stopped by the fire and brimstone of god's righteous wrath just like the fate of sodom and gomorrah believers must keep reaching out to them in hopes to save all who are ordained to eternal life faithful orthodox jews have honored separate male and female garments from the days of moses until today nearly 3400 years this standard has stood the test of time and even jesus christ himself who never broke one command of god never wore women's garments christians have also honored the separation of male and female garments for nearly 2 000 years from the days of the apostles until the present day just as god took cross-dressing seriously calling it an abomination faithful christians did the same greg and smith 2003 noted that in 17th century england a person of either sex could be hanged for dressing in the garments of the opposite sex as christianity spread to north america the laws of the land upheld this command enforcing punishments like prison time and fines for those who cross-dressed unfortunately cross-dressing became socially acceptable around the 1960s and 1970s but faithful christians have never stopped honoring deuteronomy 22 verse 5. ancient hebrew clothing since deuteronomy 22 verse 5 forbids cross-dressing what were the differences between the male and female garments they were similar in one way but different in a number of ways their outer garments were similar in that they were both robes that is where the similarities end though as the female robes were much longer with enough border and fringe to cover their feet the front of a woman's robe was long enough for her to tuck it up over her girdle to serve as an apron male and female outer garments were also different in style and could be easily differentiated at first glance as men's garments resembled a coat-like cloak although both sexes wore girdles men's girdles were more prominent and important because they carried money and other necessities men's girdles also served to fasten their swords to their bodies based upon these differences an individual's gender was instantly detectable at first glance to the onlooker female robes were much longer and and male and female styles were noticeably different by god's holy design our lord wants to keep reverential order among his people with no gender confusion united states fashion history by century and decade i will now summarize and provide specific details about the fashion changes in the united states during the 19th and 20th centuries due to fewer societal changes the 19th century is its own section separate from the 20th century in the 20th century each decade is described separately while highlighting the rapid increase of scriptures that were being broken the 19th century the majority of americans kept the bible commands for an outward appearance during the 19th century but prostitutes and other small groups of women were guilty of breaking these commands prostitutes broke at least three of the four guidelines for modest clothing as they exposed their body parts that god considered nakedness wore skin tight clothes and cross dressed in men's clothing these immoral ones were also part of the minority who wore makeup from mid to late century small groups of women began wearing the pants skirt bloomer costume which broke the command of deuteronomy 22 verse 5. the invention of the bicycle and the freedoms it offered caused some women to cross-dress with the excuses of comfort and function but the move stalled out by the end of the century specific details cross-dressing was against the law and was punishable by arrest and imprisonment women wearing pants in public was a deviant behavior in the united states the idea of women wearing pants of any kind caused an immediate and prolonged uproar it was very bad taste for a female to wear men's clothes or look masculine in any way prostitutes were known for wearing tight form-fitting pants and showed their bloomers or underwear to attract men society associated women in pants with prostitution prostitutes who worked in theaters revealed their flesh especially their legs amelia bloomer helped explode a public controversy about dress reform when she suggested women wear men's trousers under a short skirt in the summer of 1851 the majority of people rejected this idea because of the bible command of deuteronomy 22 verse 5 which was preached by the clergy bloomers did gain some converts in the 1850s but the backlash was so strong that amelia bloomer and her colleagues gave up the fight bloomers were associated with communal groups that believed in free love i.e adultery and fornication and kept bloomers from being widely adopted amelia bloomer began to wear dresses made like other fashionable dresses but with one shocking difference the skirts were knee length a proper woman did not reveal her legs however even when swimming women and girls covered up with long wool trousers beneath bathing dresses the bicycle craze had a more lasting impact on women's clothing than just the use of bloomers in the late 19th century the bicycle impacted fashion causing women to abandon frilly skirts and corsets in favor of sensible bloomers the women's education move of the 1870s permitted female students to cross-dress during performances but most did not allow men to attend those shows with makeup frowned upon women drank vinegar and ate chalk to achieve a pale complexion in the 19th century women continued to wear their hair long and pull back from the face usually piled atop the head the 20th century during the first half of the 20th century the majority of americans honored god's standards for modest clothing and a holy outward appearance the roaring 20s was the exception as millions of women for the first time cut their hair wore makeup and exposed parts of their bodies that their parents and grandparents would not have dreamed of exposing these rebellious ones called flappers joined sinful men and smoked drank danced and arrogantly defied the following scriptures second kings 9 30 jeremiah 4 30 ezekiel 23 40 first corinthians 3 17 first corinthians 11 1-16 galatians 5 21 first thessalonians 5 7 1st timothy 2 9 and 1 john 2 15. the great depression caused a financial crisis that sent most americans back to a humble way of life including fashion choices throughout the 1940s and 1950s the second half of the 20th century saw the majority of americans completely reject a biblical modest outward appearance the sexual revolution emphasized free love unisex dressing and hairstyles and led to the full acceptance of cross-dressing in the 1970s the backsliding trend was unstoppable through the 1980s and 1990s as nearly every body part came into full view on america's streets and beaches americans abandoned even more scripture including deuteronomy 22 5 proverbs 7 10 romans 1 26 and 27 first thessalonians 4 3 and revelation 3 verse 17. the 1910s during world war 1 many women wore pants while working in factories and experienced financial independence while the men were away fighting in the war after the war most women went back to wearing dresses and their previous lifestyles but seeds of change had been planted skirt lengths shortened specific details women would not be caught dead wearing pants in public at the time of the first world war by 1915 skirts had shortened to the ankle the united states entered world war 1 1914 to 1918 in june 1917. for the first time women joined the american armed services civilian women performed a wide variety of wartime jobs most worked in ankle length dresses some especially in factories and on farms opted to wear trousers fashion for women again appeared in turmoil should women abandon pants and return to pre-war styles wearing the pants in the family meant being in charge with husbands and fathers back home women and pants returned to dresses but change was in the air the 1920s the roaring 20s was the first time in american history in which millions of women publicly transgressed god's commands for a modest outward appearance for the first time women cut their hair wore makeup and adopted seductive and luxurious fashions the only force that could and did slow down this immoral trend was the great depression which god seemingly allowed to humble the nation specific details women bobbed their hair and the hemlines of their skirts raised to the knee some women wore trousers in public blurring the gender lines in order to both express lesbian desires and their equality with men in august 1920 after decades of lost battles american women won the right to vote through the 19th amendment to the u.s constitution women's new freedom at the ballot box soon mirrored a new freedom in clothes short hair and simple hats brought freedom from the anxiety of keeping a huge or elaborate hat pinned to an equally elaborate hairstyle women cut their hair and everyone said how practical the woman instinctively realized that here was a passport to freedom in daily life which he was not going to let go the convenience of short hair has been appreciated by many women ever since the bob the shingle and eaton crop of the 1920s rouse noted that changes were not all liberating but some actually became a form of slavery such as wearing makeup she wrote it was now in 1929 commonplace for women to wear makeup in the victorian period it had been considered immoral to paint one's face and many older people still subscribe to this view but now women could be seen everywhere pouting at their compact mirror in an attempt to achieve the desired cupid's bow with the aid of lipstick and dabbing at their noses with a powder puff the advent of hollywood and its stars had made the open use of cosmetics acceptable but it also brought a new bondage for women that of trying to look like someone else the new decade of the roaring twenties transformed young women's fashion as never before for the first time women grabbed their long hair which had always been so time consuming to style and snipped it off bobbed hair was all the rage the boyish bob was chin length or even shorter a sleek cut that swung close to the face the bob called for a hat that also hugged the head the flapper painted on lipstick and rouge produced by companies run by women such as helen rubinstein and elizabeth arden although women hid their curves in the tubular silhouette dresses with no waistline they revealed more skin all through the decades skirts inched higher and higher some states considered fines for dresses shorter than three inches above the ankle but the trend was irreversible by 1926 women's dresses rose for the first time above the knee bathing costumes shrank to sleeveless tank suits by the 1920s skirts for women were short not only were women's clothes changing many women now had short hair and wore makeup after world war one ended big changes were afoot not only had women won the right to vote but dancer irene castle had bobbed her hair as the 1920s roared in more and more women headed for beauty shops to have their hair bobbed at the time few women were eager to have their bobs done in a barber shop with a row of men watching and snickering in many cases this would be the biggest decision the woman would ever make to cut off a lifetime growth of hair knowing her husband father or boyfriend was dead set against it in our town this new style shingle cut seemed to usher in the flapper age next came short skirts rolled down hoes discarded corsets and cigarette smoking it was like a revolution in 1922 a washington dc beach had officials check the bather swimsuits to be sure they were no more than six inches above the knee chicago police arrested women wearing revealing bathing suits for indecent exposure in 1922 the 1930s in the 1930s the great depression affected most americans causing some to return to their humble lifestyles and modest expressions of fashion while god was drawing his little flock back to himself satan used his economic downturn to lure millions into inexpensive movie theaters hollywood's evil influence multiplied during this era especially in the area of makeup women came into the new bondage of imitating the facial cosmetics of female movie stars women followed hollywood rather than god's word breaking the command to imitate god be therefore followers or imitators of god as dear children there were a few famous women renegades who dared to defy the bible commands for modest clothing but their impact had little effect on the majority of americans most women continued to wear long skirts and dresses specific details katherine hepburn and marlene dietrich were some of the first women to wear men's pants publicly in the 1930s and 1940s marlene dietrich made international headlines in 1933 when she appeared off screen in men's clothing the paris chief of police threatened to make her leave town if she continued to wear pants so dietrich changed into a skirt but still wore a man's collar tie and hat to ease the sting of economic burdens americans looked to hollywood more than 85 million people a week escaped their troubles in darkened movie theaters many fans imitated the polished makeup of film stars plucked eyebrows dark lipstick gleaming fingernails as much as possible women also emulated the clothing of the movie queens men also copied their idols clark gable took off his shirt in one movie and revealed that he had no undershirt beneath since not wearing an undershirt was a fashion anyone could immediately afford undershirt sales plummeted hollywood popularized an image of fitness it became fashionable to show off a well-toned body for swimming men abandoned tank suits that covered their chests and for the first time appeared at beaches bare-chested some women tossed out their long tennis dresses and copied tennis champ alice marble who in 1933 dared to wear shorts in wimbledon hollywood also promoted the tan for centuries women had prized a pale complexion as a symbol of leisure people who got tan worked outdoors doing manual labor the 1940s and 1950s by the 1940s and 1950s most americans were still dressing modestly but skirt lengths for women kept rising inch by inch famous female actresses continued to cross-dress in men's pants other rebels were wearing two-piece bathing suits but those outlandish fashions were not the norm yet specific details shocking the most shocking new style of all was the two-piece bathing suit which used far less fabric than the most modest one-piece suit popular before the war high school style 1949-1959 although uniforms were not required at american schools teen girls developed their own the skirt either full or pencil shaped finishing just below the knee and sweater or fitted top pants and jeans were forbidden the styles of the 1950s provided a physical barrier between the sexes which was the same approach as the victorian era the styles made it seem the clothes were not easily removed audrey hepburn wore capri pants in the 1950s the 1960s the sexual revolution of the 1960s literally changed everything in fashion for the majority of americans in this decade the godly standards for outward appearance began to fall drastically mini skirts rose far above the knee for the first time exposing more flesh than ever little clothing was being worn and the material was light fashions focused on sexual availability by the end of the decade two major trends defied god's law about cross-dressing first unisex fashions created a sense of confusion amongst the youth second levi's created its division for women's pants in 1968 making pants readily available for women for the first time ever it is noteworthy that in the early 1960s the supreme court removed prayer and bible reading from public schools the results of removing jesus christ and his standards for modest clothing from schools has been decreased academic achievement increased crime drug use and sexual immorality specific details clothing style suggested accessibility and sexual availability prominent zips and fastenings made it seem clothing was easily removed lighter clothing and much less clothing became popular pant suits became increasingly popular during the 1960s and 1970s skirt length was the most important fashion consideration for the majority of americans unisex dressing was a new trend in part due to the hippie movement women wore men's jeans and shirts in the 1960s some men grew their hair out like women and were suspended from school or lost their jobs in real life the biggest trend in women's fashion was the miniskirt introduced in london boutiques by designer mary quant and others the mini had a hemline eight or nine inches above the knee exposing more skin than any previous skirt the young recognized no boundaries and feel no commitments proclaimed a new york times magazine article short skirts some say are a sign but how are women supposed to sit or bend without exposing more than they wished patterned tights and the first pantyhose resolved that problem but not another the hippies dress reflected their break with society carefree lifestyles including drug use sexual promiscuity both sexes wore jeans sandals and flowing captains young males grew their hair to shoulder length older folks complained that they couldn't tell the boys from the girls men's clothes have become an approximation of women's and women's clothes copy men's one psychologist noted when clothes express such confused roles society is in big trouble british designer mary quant was the first to introduce dresses above the knee in 1960 women goop their eyes with black eyeliner and colored eye shadow the short skirts and low waists of the 1920s were again fashionable in the 1960s london's mod look from carnaby street of the 1960s led to an erratic era of fluctuating hemlines and unisex fashions but if the woman's hair was getting shorter some men were wearing their hair longer hairstyles for some young people became almost identical stemming from the unisex fashions by futuristic designers such as pierre cardin and andre kurigi's fashionable women began wearing pants in the 1960s and 70s the sexual revolution of women's lib meant that women were taking greater strides to enter the workforce and as a result they borrowed more from men's fashion french designer yves saint laurent ysl first created his sleek but controversial lay smoking tuxedo suit for women in 1966 and continued to create androgynous styles each season the look slowly became more widely accepted as an alternative to skirts and dresses the 1970s the main fashion theme of the 1970s was women wearing pants during the early part of the decade companies and fine restaurants would not allow women to wear pants in their establishments but their standards eventually weakened and cross-dressing became a part of everyday life public teachers unions played a big role in allowing women teachers to begin wearing pants to school women and pants hit prime time television as well as mary tyler moore was the first woman to wear pants on a television sitcom specific details one word can sum up women's fashion in the 70s pants women wearing pants was their solution to the problem of previous decades about how long dresses and skirts should be most fine restaurants in the early 1970s would not allow women to enter if they were dressed in pants public school teacher unions helped women gain the right to wear pants to school in the early 1970s as long as the material and color match the top trouser outfits were finally acceptable as everyday wear but not in the majority women and pants saw the hemline controversy unisex clothes were advertised in london and discussion arose about the psychological implications that would result in the early 1970s it was common to see men and women dressed identically in unisex fashion with the same hairstyles it was more common to see women borrowing from male fashion especially among feminists as the 1970s opened many women burned out on skirts by the mini began to wear pants pants sold so well that major designers added pant suits including some for elegant evening wear to their collections in 1968 levi's launched a division for gals some businesses began to accept female employees in pants one survey reported that macy's department store would not permit women employees in pants but the first national bank of boston would if they continue to act like women at t would keep an open mind for the first time in america's fashion history women began to have a real choice between dresses and pants mistress fuller or any woman of the 1600s or 1700s never would have dreamed of pulling on a pair of breeches mary tyler moore was the first woman to wear pants on a television sitcom in the 1970s the writers of her show limited her to one scene per show in which she could wear pants the no bra look became popular in the early 70s the 1980s and 1990s the 1980s and 1990s produced even more disobedience to god's standards for modest clothing major fashion statements were spread through the punk hip-hop grunge and goth movements the trends of cross-dressing and exposing more flesh were irreversible the most shocking of all fashion statements was in swimwear string bikinis and thongs revealed nearly every part of the human body satan had propagated and achieved a condition of complete nakedness and undress specific details the length of the skirts and dresses of women was no longer a major issue by the late 1980s fashion trends were made popular through the punk hip-hop grunge and goth movements on the beaches of america even more radical expressions like thongs reveal breasts and buttocks reaping the whirlwind the united states of america is in the same position that israel found itself in during the days of the prophet hosea awaiting the judgment and wrath of almighty god hosea warned northern israel of the pending judgments upon them for their breaking of god's covenant and their transgression of his laws around 750 bc the united states has done the same through the legalization of sin and the breaking of nearly every law of god including god's standards for a modest and holy outward appearance hosea stated the following words about israel's rebellion against god israel had sown the wind and would reap the whirlwind the phrase sowing the wind is a proverb from the agricultural practice of sowing and reaping or planting and harvesting sowing and reaping is a law of god whatever we plant in our lives we will harvest the consequences whether good or evil as galatians 6 verses 6 and 7 teaches be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting israel had planted seeds of rebellion and disobedience against the commands of god and they were sure to multiply into an awful deadly harvest of the judgments of god the whirlwind came in 722 bc when the assyrian armies invaded the capital city of syria and carried the people of israel away into captivity the united states has also sown the wind remember that america upheld god's modesty standards for the outward appearance for a few hundred years but america has fallen from its love for god the historical facts from this chapter show that evil seeds of disobedience had been planted through the roaring twenties the sexual revolution of the 60s the cross-dressing move of the 70s and the state of undress of the 80s and 90s america is beginning to see a whirlwind develop in cities families governments businesses and communities all over this country it is the whirlwind of sexual abuse homosexuality and the transgender lifestyle the small seeds of undressing women cross-dressing and unisex fashions of the 1960s and 1970s that were planted into millions of mines have now matured into corruptable fruit a cultural majority that hates the truth of god's word and is worthy of the judgments of god the united states along with many other countries is reviving the evil conditions of sodom and gomorrah fulfilling jesus's prophecy the whirlwind of sexual abuse is howling in both hollywood and in the churches the metoo movement of 2018 has exposed hollywood's wicked glorification of sexuality unveiling its rotten toxic filthy and god-hating scores of female celebrities have come forward to accuse and bring conviction upon rich and powerful sexual predators like harvey weinstein and bill cosby churches have experienced this violent wind as in august 2018 pennsylvania grand jury report found that catholic priests had sexually abused over 1 000 victims in the past 70 years these allegations join a growing list of sex abuse cases spanning the globe from louisiana to ireland and from the netherlands to australia the cross-dressing and unisex fashions of the 1960s and 1970s were the seeds of confusion that led to the current rise and widespread adoption of homosexuality and transgenderism god is not the author of confusion if you plant or allow confusion or any seed of sin the harvest will be only death in the sight of god those who accept homosexuality and the transgender movement are insane paul said that homosexuals have received a reprobate mind and are without natural affection in the greek lexicon the reprobate mind is a worthless rejected castaway mindset that god gives to those who will not retain and accept the knowledge of god a person with a reprobate mind cannot be in his or her right mind making them insane in the sight of god furthermore the person is without the natural affection that god intended men and women to have the natural feelings of human beings to be attracted to the opposite sex have eroded the natural feeling to remain the gender of your birth has also been abandoned by millions in this backslidden country paul taught that a reprobate mind actually hates the word of god this god-hating condition is the result of people refusing to worship god and be thankful for his revealed truth the apostle also wrote that the wrath of god or whirlwind would come upon the entire world for this evil we know this judgment includes the united states because the majority of its citizens have chosen sin over righteousness and all nations have been deceived by the antichrist spirit retain the knowledge of god in your mind worship the creator and not the creation love the truth of god's word sow to the holy spirit and reap eternal life receive the truths god is currently restoring to his children conclusion the history of fashion in the united states reveals the immoral sinful downfall through a public undressing of its men and women lucifer like a serpent has slowly slithered through the decades destroying god's holiness standards and establishing his own cultural garden satan's eden america like israel was once a god-honoring nation but has transgressed the commands of the bible and will soon reap the full whirlwind of the judgments of god through my research i realize that most people do not have any idea about the standards of holiness that our nation used to keep the same thing happened to israel after joshua's generation passed away a generation rose up that did not know the lord and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the lord nor yet the works which he had done for israel hardly anyone knows that most women never wore makeup or cut their hair until the 1920s because of their fear of almighty god few americans know that it was a public disgrace for most females to wear pants to school and work until the 1960s and 1970s because the masses heard preaching about deuteronomy 22 verse 5. recognize the purpose that god's spirit has been revealing these truths to you as first corinthians 2 verse 12 says now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god before the wrath of god falls upon america it is your job and my job to spread the truth of god's word to everyone that will listen share truths about god's modest clothing with a lost and dying generation share god's truths with your words in conversation with your modest clothes with your social media account with your daily life
