TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show 30 Bible verses that God's Prophet brother William Branham used to define his end-time message so this video answers the question what is the message and this video is a follow-up on the two podcasts I recently put out that are titled are you the message Parts one and two and I apologize my voice is a little hoarse I preached twice over the Easter weekend and we had a tremendous time of worshiping Our Risen Lord Jesus Christ recall that the word message means any notice word or communication written or verbal sent from one person to another so the bible message of today is the word of God sent from Jesus Christ to his bride the Holy Ghost filled Church of the Lord Jesus Christ and I like to use this quote from Brother Branham from the Rapture 1965 where he calls the message God's promise of the hour what God was scripturally vindicating from the Bible let's listen to the quote many of his strangers perhaps hear these men get up and they make these remarks about a message at this hour and so forth what they are getting at is God's promise of this hour that he promised what he would do and we seem scripturally vindicating just exactly what he said he would do in the same manner foretold it's just exactly perfectly each time because it's God saying it so I really appreciated the feedback from the first two podcasts and Lord willing in the future we'll make a video about how we are the word but the best way to say it is we are a part of the word because we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world according to Ephesians 1 verse 4. of course we know Christ is the word according to John 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the word and the words with God and the Word was God in Revelation 19 Jesus comes from heaven and his name is called the word of God but we must remember and we see from the scripture that we are born again of the word of God according to First Peter 1 verse 23 so there is a portion or measure of the word of God in our souls when our souls are baptized with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost anointing in our souls is a part of God's eternal spirit and God's spirit is the word in spirit form so according to the Bible the only way we can be the word is that we have a portion or measure of the word in our souls and so we fulfill the word of God and when we witness about Jesus Christ we're carriers of the word or when ministers preach about the Lord Jesus Christ we are declaring the word of God but we would never say we are the full word of God because that is for Jesus Christ Alone as the Bible said he was the fullness of the godhead bodily we are not the fullness of the word we just have a portion of the word of God and of course we find this truth in Colossians 2 verse 9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily before we start here's two screenshots of the 30 verses brother Branham uses to define the bible message of the end time here's numbers 1 through 21 and here's Numbers 22 through 30 and of course friends there could be many many more these are just the 30 I found through maybe 10 to 20 hours of study I don't know I'm just guessing so let's begin with Hebrews 13 verse 8 it says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever and let's listen as brother random says this scripture is the same message he's always preached have I never see you again this side of the river I'll see you on the other side believing in the same word with the same mission that Jesus Christ did the same yesterday that said day and forever and Center of handsome but his word will never fail do you believe it here's another quote from three kinds of Believers where brother Rams says the messages Hebrews 13 8. the latter day the evening time when the lights are shining and the things has been opened up and the word Vindicated it proved to be the truth both prophesied comes to pass all these scientific is everything proved that it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever and a man walk out on that he's a non-believer Beyond hopes he's known by the prayer of Satan the second verse is Acts 2 38 which says then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost here's two quotes about that one from taking sides with Jesus and the other from Jezebel religion well you think it's badly thought of now you ought to notice and there's nobody and then this water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and the blessings and things that we believe in and stand for tellers ections [Music] you'll be a servant of God sure will the Bible said he would come the third verse is Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6. it says behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse here's a quote from questions and answers part 4 1964 where brother random quotes Malachi 4 verse 6. on the Holy Spirit wrote it for this prophet he said he will turn the hearts of the fathers first to the children see that with John's first coming he turned the hearts of the fathers the old patriarch fathers to the message of the children which was the new generation then Jesus and that generation then and conjuncts that time together the hearts of the children back to the fathers which means the message of the day will turn the hearts of the children in the church age back to the original Pentecostal faith of the beginning another quote on Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6 as the message is from what shall we do with this Jesus called Christ 1964. let's listen to the quote simple man could there be today and the things that he promised during this day Malachi 4 being fulfilled all the rest of scriptures being fulfilled and sit right here at the end of the time you don't need any man to interpret it no sign interprets itself it's the man turn to God all the church is repent and turn to God on a Washington the fourth verse is Luke 24 47 and that says and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and brother baptized this in with Acts 2 38 because Luke 24 47 said in his name one name singular that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote from Revelation chapter 4 part 3 1961. [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] verse is Jude 1 verse 3. beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints but around uses this quote and Malachi 4 5 and 6 in a sermon God's chosen place of worship 1965. let's listen to the quote and that's supposed to be the message of the hour to restore back the hearts of the children back to the Fate that was once delivered to the Saints won't you accept it tonight the sixth and seventh verses are Revelation 10 1-7 and Matthew 20 verse 6. I'm not going to read all of Revelation 10 1-7 but I'll paraphrase it's the mighty angel coming down with an open book and his voice Thunder seven times then the Bible says in verse 7 for the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has revealed unto his servants the prophets of course we believe this verse is the Lord Jesus Christ coming down in 1963 to reveal the revelation of the Seven Seals to his Prophet brother William Branham and then Matthew 20 verse 6 says and about the 11th hour he went out and found other standing Idol and saith unto them why stand ye here all the day Idol brother Brown says we are the eleventh hour workers and that's the message of the hour it's from recognizing your dance message 1964. Angel's message is to open the mystery of the seals calling the 11th Hour Gentiles workers to receive the same pay that the first hour workers got the eighth verse is Luke 17 30 which says even thus shall be in the day when the son of man is revealed of course this is speaking of Jesus Christ being revealed in the prophetic Ministry of brother Branham in this quote brother random also cites Revelation 10 1-7 it's from what is the attraction on the mount in 1965 let's listen to the quote that's what all this noise is about notice God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelations 10 1-7 and in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angels message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelations 10 1-7 the last message to the last at church age full Fields attacked the end of sage St Luke 17 30 the days when the son of man shall be revealed National rise false prophets and false Christ notice later on the quote brother Ram says Revelation 10 1-7 is fulfilled prophecy let's listen to the quote and the god of Heaven promised the evening time would have evening lights three years ago this mystery was a prophecy but what time is it sir but now is history it's past the promise is fulfilled what time is it sir what's this attraction God fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever let us pray and that's why I believe Revelation 10 1-7 was fulfilled beginning in 1963 all the way to the end of brother Ram's life so he could finish the mystery of God before he passed away of course I wrote a book on that in 2021 I'm not a book salesman but if you want a free copy let me know the 9th 10th and 11th verses are in the next quote from doors indoor 1965 Revelation 18 verse 4 Matthew 25 1-13 and Luke 21 verse 28 Revelation 18 4 says and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues brother Ram says that's the message of today to come out of denominationalism of course Matthew 25 1-13 is the parable of the wise and foolish virgins but the RAM tells us we need to be the wise virgins with the oil of the baptism of the Holy Ghost ready for Jesus coming Jesus is the bridegroom and then Luke 21 verse 28 is Jesus saying when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads you re for your Redemption draweth and I let's listen to the quote we find that our messages today the message that we have of come out of Babylon and be free and be filled with the spirit your land streaming clear and look up our redemptions drawing there we these things are foreign to many people who breathe and call our lovely lord's name here's another quote from why I'm against organized religion 1962 where Bill Graham says Revelation 18 4 is the message of the hour let's listen to the quote immediately after her mystery was made known [Music] then God sent an angel a messenger go ahead [Applause] [Music] the message of the hour my people that should be not partakers of verse plagues uh you're going to cursor the 12th verse is Ephesians 4 verses 8-16 but specifically Ephesians 4 11 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers so brother ram calls the five full ministry the message of the hour notice brother random never said the message of the hour is press play and the fivefold ministry should sit down let's listen to the quote the bride of Christ have worth the bride of Christ have a Ministry for the Rapture sure that's what's going on right now okay the bride of Christ serve me it is the message of the hour amenity the bride of Christ sure she's consist of Apostles prophets teachers Bashers and pastors is that right that's a bride of Christ sure she's got a Ministry great Ministries the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble the 13th verse is Luke 2 verse 49 and he said unto them how is it that you sought me wish ye not that I must be about my father's business of course this is speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ but in this quote brother random says the seeker of the message is being about the father's business and this is from the identification of Christ in all ages 1964. let's listen to the quote there's the secret of the message now just exactly the father's business what is the father's business and notice in the same quote he cites Hebrews 13 8 Malachi 4 5 and 6 Revelation chapter 10 and Luke 17 30. also in this quote brother random cites four more new scriptures to add to the list so in this quote he lists the 13th 14th 15th 16th and 17th verses that Define what is the message of the hour and again those are Luke 2 49 John 14 12 is the 14th verse barely verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and then he cites the serpent seed from Genesis 3 15 and I'll put energy between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel and then he quotes the 16th verse Matthew 5 32 and that says but I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that his divorce committeth adultery of course speaking of marriage and divorce and then another marriage and divorce verse Matthew 19 verses 8 and 9 and he saith in them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except would be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso meareth her which is put away doth commit adultery now notice brother Ram doesn't cite those specific verses but those verses are the revelation of marriage and divorce that brother man preached in February 1965. let's listen to the quote [Applause] and so forth that's a father's business the 18th verse is John 10 verse 35 which says if he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken this verse is speaking how the word of God comes to prophets as it has in every day again Enoch's day Noah's day Abraham's day Moses day Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel and Malachi's day they were all gods or rulers or judges unto whom the word of God came and brother random uses this verse in the identified Christ of all ages 1964. let's listen to the quote God through the word of God came to and here I am the Son of God how do you condemn me oh my the same thing is today it's God manifested in fashion [Music] the message of the hour a lot of the day we can't have the mother messages back there they've come and lived up we live in a glamorable life and just a disclaimer friends we don't call ourselves Gods even though the Bible does call the children of God Gods that's in Psalm 82 verse 6 I have said ye are gods and all of you are the children of the most high that word God's in Hebrew means rulers or judges we believe it's more humble to call ourselves Kings and Priests unto God because that's what the Bible says we are and brother Ram said we're spiritual Kings ruling over the flesh the world the devil and sin in his church age book from 1965 and Romans 5 17 says that we shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ so who rules but a king or a judge and then Revelation 1 verse 6 says Christ hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father the 19th verses are all the verses in the book of Acts chapter 2 verses 1-47 brother random says that it's thus saith the Lord we must come back to the message and he says the message is back to the original Pentecost so which chapter in the Bible speaks of the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost that's Acts chapter 2. and this quotes from Gabriel's instructions to Daniel 1961 let's listen to the quote Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] come back to the original amen get away from your method as fast as pray as the current ideas Pentecostal sinless one the street and surprises whatever it is Church of God Nazarene Pilgrim holding this Church of Christ movement amen amen now I realize this strikes the world amen but the organization in itself [Applause] [Music] for them [Music] will swing the people back to the right to the original Pentecost and The Originals with the originals and the original one Hallelujah here's another quote from why 1961 brother random says Acts 2 is the Pentecostal message and he says it's the message of the hour let's listen to the quote [Music] together [Music] listen to Memphis many calls for Grace blessings for us the 20th verse is Jeremiah 29 verses 10 through 14. brother reads this in desperations 1963 and then in Jeremiah 29 verse 14 brother random reads the end of verse 14 and says we'll bring you again unto the place which I cause you to be carried away captive and then brother random adds the words back to Pentecost I put that in myself it doesn't say that that's what I was meaning to the church so let's listen to the quote [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sick and I will be found in you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captain and I will gather you from All Nations and from all the places unto the place which I cause you to be prepared away captain doesn't say the 21st verse is Joel 2 verses 23-26 in the church age book by the random said these scriptures are thus saith the Lord come back to the message let's listen to the quote what about the true seed it will happen just as we have said the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the Lord it is a saith the Lord for that is what Joel 2 23-26 says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he have given you the former Reign moderately and evil cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the canker worms and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat him plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed the 22nd verse is John 5 24 which says verily bear this and to you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but as fast from Death unto life brother says this is the message of the hour and true Eagles will understand it in the Easter seal 1965. let's listen to the quote he will understand the message of the hour a tree Eagle now the little Eagle problem the Barnyard was eating all right you know what it was just exactly right but then when he heard the truth then he received this truth now in John 14 uh John 5 24 rather Jesus said speaking this way he that Europe my words and believeth on him that sent me had everlasting life and shall not come into the Judgment but pass from Death on the line think how simple it is he that believer the 23rd verse is First Corinthians 6 verse 11 and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are Sanctified but you're justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God now brother Ram doesn't read this scripture but he says the message is the three works of Grace justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we can see this taught in the Bible in First Corinthians 6 verse 11 but let's listen to the quote from it is the rising of the Sun 1965. these three steps before they hit the highway and on the highways a little early life White Lines into the the doors of Heaven that Pearl has been stretched out to the top of these tests if that ain't my message exactly today I would think that a person has to come by these three steps to be able to walk their highways to go along with that the 24th verse is Mark 4 verse 28 and this speaks of the three works of Grace this is Jesus talking and he said for the Earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the ear so in this scripture Jesus is giving a parable and it reveals the three works of Grace he compares the three works of grace to the three stages of a seed growing and brother Rama actually uses the same symbolism in he swore by himself 1954. let's listen to the quote not three different dispensations not three works of Grace but one work and three different manifestations man holy spirit loser under justification without her wisely which magnification do the church now in the back of the Holy Ghost the same Holy Spirit not to the Holy Spirit the same Holy Spirit a little corny come up here the first thing in the former local senior social prophecy stand up wonderfully rejoice as well they got older withered away and as harm went on is it the same life as in this corner here at the first stalk is it up here to here in Grain insane it just went on towards the church going on to that perfect day when Jesus shall come amen see same Holy Spirit saying saying this different distances the 25th verse is Ezekiel 36 verses 26 and 27 that speaks of the three works of grace these verses say he knew her also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I'll take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you and heart of Flesh and I'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them brother Ram cites these verses in 1957 the impersonation of Christianity and these verses teach the three works of Grace new heart new spirit my spirit or God's spirit let's listen to the quote morning [Music] Juliet speaking he says same senses [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we'll swap passes that is what the church sees beneath the bad things it needs the power of the Living God a reason to gratitude members who Revival needs to revise that what you've already got thank you a 26 verse is acts 1 verse 5. this says for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence brother Ram uses this verse in the token message September 1st 1963 the baptism of the Holy Ghost is part of the message of the hour let's listen to the quote since and when the blood was shed the token was set down on the day of Pentacles like a Russian Mighty Wind happened the 27th and 28th verses are about Divine Healing in the Rapture Divine Healing is found in Mark 16 verses 15 through 18. I'll just read Verse 18 they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover then in the same quote brother Brenna mentions the Rapture and the Rapture is found in the first Thessalonians 5 verses 15 through 18. I'm not going to read all those verses but I'll read first Thessalonians 4 17 and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord so let's listen to the quote from 1959 be certain of God and it says the message is Divine Healing and the Rapture let's listen to the quote Paul preached the same message baptism of the Holy Ghost he believed in Divine Healing the power of God the second coming another quote about Divine Healing being the message is from the Ephesian Church age in 1960 and in this quote brother Branham cites Mark 16. let's listen to the quote it begins the church begins at Pentacles the church began at Pentecost with a Pentecostal blessing and was ordained by Jesus Christ to continue on until the last day with the same message and the same blessing work it is amen commission to his church March 16 going to all World preach the gospel these times shall follow them another quote that says Divine Healing is a minor in the message is sir we would see Jesus 1963. let's listen to the quote [Music] the percent of his ministry was on Divine Healing but is the the late brother biles worth many of you knew brother FF Bosworth The Godly saintly man he used to say that Divine Healing is just like uh the bait on the hook you never show the face the hook you're showing the bait and and So Divine Healing is a minor and you can never major on a minor but it so we another quote that says the Rapture is the second coming is from the fourth seal 1963 let's listen to the quote here's another quote that says the Rapture is part of the message but laram said the message is to get the bride ready and prepare for the Rapture from the end time evangelism 1962 let's listen to the quote regardless the entire message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture what can you do according to Montauk courts bring him back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints bring him back to the faith of the fathers of Pentecostal part in the restoration time I will restore saith the Lord that's real event uh income evangelism here's a quote from the Rapture 1965 where brother random sites first Thessalonians 4 15-18 and he said it's the message of God getting the bride ready for the Rapture let's listen to the quote Old Testament we're waiting up to Fourth and come out of that person going to the resurrection wheel drop right right wing into the sky has golden moral grade that'll be what it's made this plane looking forward to brother the 29th verses are Revelation 6 verses 1 to 17 and Revelation 8 verse 1 which of course are the Seven Seals I'm not going to read all of those but please read them in your free time brother Adam says the Seven Seals are part of the seventh Angel's message let's listen to this quote from the unveiling of God 1964. [Music] all around that hour of the seventh Angels message all the mysteries of God should be made known this last hour how the Christ has put on these churches Son of God has revealed his son of man again how did the church is to be put in the order and everything for the last day an old Creed no denomination just absolutely the word living in the individual and again in the Rapture 1965 brother Ram says the Seven Seals are part of he says my message let's listen to the quote and I'm in my message all the time going back knowing the message would come there it is and them Seven Seals open those men showing those things those things happen I in the 30th and final verses are Revelation 3 verses 14-22 I'm not going to read all these verses please read them in your free time but of course this is the message from Jesus to the seventh angel the angel of laodicea and brother Ram said the message has come forth of the laodicean age and each age had a messenger and he says we are now living in the laodicean church age this is from Investments 1962. let's listen to the quote we find out that in Revelations 3 at the lady of SIA age which we are now living in to my interpretation of the scripture that when the message has come forth of the lady of SIA H as it did at each age and each age you had a messenger that we come forth in this last day and find out that that church was very rich and they were so disagreeable with him they put him out of the church in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing again proving that the message is the scriptures that Jesus Christ is fulfilling right now we're so grateful to know these verses and know that Jesus Christ is fulfilling them in our lives just as he did in brother branham's life and Jesus will keep anointing us to finish the Great Commission friends let's continue to Humble ourselves and remember that we are just a part of the word we're a part of Christ we are not the fullness of Christ only Jesus Christ is the fullness of God and we're a part of Christ we're so thankful we can be 11th Hour workers and do our little part before the Harvest comes so may we yield ourselves continually to the Lord Jesus Christ for his service and be thankful that we can have a part in Jesus Christ's message of this hour if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music] foreign
