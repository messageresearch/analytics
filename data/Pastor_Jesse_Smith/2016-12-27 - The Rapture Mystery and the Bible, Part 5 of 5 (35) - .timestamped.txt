[0:03] how will the rap should be done the
[0:06] rapture will be done by the power and
[0:08] authority of Jesus Christ himself
[0:09] through a shout voice and Trump 1st
[0:13] Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself
[0:16] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[0:17] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[0:20] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[0:22] shall rise first the shout is the order
[0:26] command or stimulating cry from Jesus
[0:28] Christ to get his people ready for the
[0:31] rapture
[0:31] we believe this shout or cry is the same
[0:34] midnight cry of Matthew 25 verse 6 the
[0:38] cry that awoke the sleeping virgins both
[0:40] wise and foolish and caused them to trim
[0:43] their lamps and fill their lamps with
[0:44] oil in order to go meet the bridegroom
[0:47] we believe this cry to go out and meet
[0:50] Christ at the rapture went out through
[0:52] the Prophet Ministry of William Branham
[0:54] and is still going on right now for the
[0:57] message of the hour preached from
[0:58] William Branham is still being taken
[1:00] around the world to learn more about the
[1:02] ministry of William Branham and how he
[1:04] is the messenger of the hour please see
[1:06] our video series called the messenger of
[1:08] the hour William Branham
[1:10] all the wise Christians with the oil of
[1:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost will be
[1:16] ready to meet Christ at is soon coming
[1:19] next the voice of the Archangel is a
[1:21] future event that will be the voice of
[1:24] Resurrection for the dead in Christ
[1:25] mentioned in 1st Thessalonians 4:16 the
[1:29] dead in Christ will rise first and then
[1:31] sometime afterwards we which are alive
[1:33] and remain on the earth will receive our
[1:36] body change the same voice that
[1:37] resurrected Lazarus in John 11 43 will
[1:41] one day resurrect all the dead in Christ
[1:43] who faithfully serve the Lord Jesus
[1:45] Christ during the past two thousand
[1:48] years John 11 43 and when he thus had
[1:51] spoken he cried with a loud voice
[1:53] Lazarus come forth
[1:56] lastly the Trump of God will sound which
[1:59] will change the bodies of the living
[2:01] Saints and call the gathering of the
[2:03] dead and living in Christ to the sky to
[2:06] meet Jesus in the air at the rapture or
[2:08] wedding ceremony then we which are alive
[2:11] and remain shall be caught up together
[2:13] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[2:15] in the air
[2:16] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[2:19] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[2:22] a moment in the twinkling of an eye at
[2:25] the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[2:27] sound and the dead shall be raised
[2:29] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[2:31] for this corruptible must put on
[2:33] incorruption and this mortal must put on
[2:36] immortality the shout voice and trump of
[2:40] god are all performed by jesus' Holy
[2:42] Spirit it is the same Holy Spirit that
[2:45] quickened Jesus's own body at his
[2:47] resurrection from the dead
[2:48] this same Holy Spirit has and will
[2:51] perform six raptures Enoch was the first
[2:54] rapture in Genesis 5:24
[2:58] Elijah was the second rapture in second
[3:01] Kings 2:11
[3:04] Jesus's own body was raptured twice so
[3:07] the third rapture was John 20:17
[3:12] the fourth rapture was Jesus again in
[3:15] mark 1619
[3:18] the fifth rapture is the one we're
[3:20] laboring to enter into which is the
[3:23] Gentile bride rapture of first
[3:25] Thessalonians 4:15 2:17
[3:29] and the final rapture will be the
[3:30] rapture of the two witnesses in
[3:32] revelation 11 verses 11 and 12 in
[3:37] closing we hope and pray that the
[3:39] mysteries surrounding the Bible event
[3:40] known as the rapture has been revealed
[3:43] to you although God does not choose to
[3:45] reveal every single detail about the
[3:47] rapture such as the literal day an hour
[3:49] we can rest assure that if we have the
[3:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost we will be
[3:53] ready for the rapture and the spear that
[3:55] draws within us will change our bodies
[3:57] and raise us to meet Jesus Christ in the
[4:00] air at his appearing if you would like
[4:02] more Bible teaching about the rapture
[4:04] please contact us god bless you and may
[4:08] Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
