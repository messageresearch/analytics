[0:00] chapter 9 the mystery of babylon the
[0:02] great
[0:04] chapter 9 contains footnotes numbers
[0:06] 1454
[0:09] to 1601
[0:12] and upon her forehead was a name written
[0:14] mystery babylon the great the mother of
[0:17] harlots and abominations of the earth
[0:20] revelation 17 verse 5.
[0:24] by this point you know the true church's
[0:26] identity and her attributes as jesus's
[0:28] bride additionally the sixteen
[0:31] revelations of the kingdom of heaven
[0:33] further differentiate the true church
[0:34] from the false
[0:36] with this solid scriptural foundation
[0:38] you'll easily recognize the false
[0:40] church's identity
[0:43] the wisdom requirement
[0:45] the book of revelation teaches one
[0:47] requirement to identify the false church
[0:49] wisdom
[0:51] revelation 17 verse 9 says the mind
[0:53] which hath wisdom recognizes that
[0:56] mystery babylon the false church
[0:58] sits on seven mountains which is one of
[1:00] the eleven clues as to her identity
[1:04] god made the false church's identity
[1:06] extremely obvious even identifiable
[1:09] geographically by its seven mountains so
[1:11] that eternal life with him would be
[1:13] freely available to any and all who
[1:16] desire his love
[1:17] a second mention of the wisdom
[1:19] requirement comes from revelation 13
[1:22] verse 18 telling us that wisdom counts
[1:24] the number of the beast 666 in order to
[1:27] avoid taking his mark
[1:31] god's compassionate heart allows
[1:32] everyone a chance to be saved for he
[1:34] makes wisdom easily accessible
[1:37] james 1 verse 5 explains how easily
[1:39] saying if any of you lack wisdom let him
[1:42] ask of god that give it to all men
[1:44] liberally and upbraideth not and it
[1:46] shall be given him
[1:48] in the greek liberally means simply
[1:51] openly frankly sincerely all god
[1:54] requires in exchange for his wisdom
[1:57] needed to recognize the false church and
[1:59] the beast's number is an honest selfless
[2:02] prayer requesting wisdom with the right
[2:04] motive
[2:06] few people ever pray in honest prayer
[2:08] because their intentions when praying
[2:10] are selfish motivated by lusts
[2:13] james explains that most prayers are not
[2:15] answered because they are asked with
[2:17] lustful intent
[2:18] jesus said few would find salvation
[2:21] meaning few would have wisdom
[2:23] freely offered through a sincere prayer
[2:25] to escape the false church destined for
[2:28] the mark of the beast
[2:29] consider the past and current global
[2:31] scale of selfish lustful prayers
[2:35] our heavenly father turns down billions
[2:37] of selfish prayers from around the globe
[2:40] because of their evil nature as the
[2:42] false church has deceived all nations
[2:45] the importance of godly wisdom can
[2:47] hardly be over emphasized solomon says
[2:50] wisdom is the principle thing therefore
[2:53] get wisdom and with all thy getting get
[2:55] understanding
[2:57] if you do not have the wisdom of god
[2:59] humbly bow your head in prayer and ask
[3:01] god for his divine wisdom at this moment
[3:03] before going forward in this chapter
[3:06] pray for more than a minute set your
[3:08] face to heaven praying until you feel
[3:10] god's presence surrounding you granting
[3:12] you the assurance that his wisdom is on
[3:14] the way
[3:17] the confusion about mystery babylon
[3:20] the confusion about mystery babylon
[3:21] centers around her identity
[3:24] is she
[3:25] for she is called a woman in revelation
[3:27] 17 verse 6
[3:29] a real woman yet to rule in the future
[3:31] or merely a symbolic figure of all false
[3:33] religions
[3:34] city kingdom government empire or church
[3:40] the revelation of mystery babylon is her
[3:42] identity as the false mother church the
[3:44] roman catholic church
[3:46] and her daughters are protestant
[3:48] churches who partake in her iniquities
[3:52] please understand this revelation is not
[3:54] a personal attack on roman catholics but
[3:56] rather a desperate loving call for god's
[3:59] people inside the corrupt catholic
[4:01] system to come out that they be not
[4:03] partakers of the church's sins
[4:06] this chapter details 11 proofs that
[4:08] witness beyond a shadow of a doubt that
[4:10] the roman catholic church willingly
[4:11] upholds doctrines of devils abuses its
[4:14] power and makes merchandise of souls of
[4:17] men for self-gain
[4:19] no other church city kingdom or woman
[4:22] can even come close to meeting all 11
[4:24] requirements
[4:26] something jerusalem is mystery babylon
[4:28] due to scripture's repeated references
[4:31] to her as a harlot
[4:32] but the holy city fails to meet a few
[4:34] scriptural requirements
[4:36] first jerusalem does not sit upon many
[4:38] waters as taught in revelation 17 verse
[4:41] 1.
[4:42] waters represent many peoples multitudes
[4:45] nations and tongues
[4:46] jerusalem's influence upon many nations
[4:48] is small in comparison to rome
[4:51] there are only around 11 million jews
[4:53] and about 82 percent live in israel and
[4:56] the united states
[4:57] the 11 million jews pale in comparison
[5:00] to the world's 1.3 billion catholics
[5:03] second jerusalem is never called babylon
[5:05] in scripture whereas peter refers to
[5:07] rome as babylon
[5:09] in 1st peter 5 13.
[5:12] rome is also the legs of iron or modern
[5:15] babylon-like kingdom vividly described
[5:17] in daniel chapter 2.
[5:19] third revelation 18 verse 3 requires
[5:22] mystery babylon to have strong
[5:24] relationships to the kings of the earth
[5:26] and ties with all nations
[5:28] but israel is despised by many nations
[5:30] and often suffers from bias and
[5:32] discrimination at the united nations
[5:35] on the other hand the vatican has
[5:36] diplomats to nearly every nation
[5:39] finally mystery babylon is condemned in
[5:42] revelation 18 verse 21 with prophecy
[5:44] that she will never be found or rebuilt
[5:47] after god's wrath destroys her
[5:50] mystery babylon has an expiration date
[5:53] roman the vatican will be destroyed
[5:55] jerusalem is promised a rebuilding a
[5:57] peaceful habitation and future kingdom
[5:59] in isaiah 2 verses 2 through 4
[6:02] jeremiah 3 verse 17 and isaiah 65 verses
[6:06] 17-22
[6:08] jesus will set up his millennial throne
[6:10] in jerusalem and all nations will gather
[6:13] there to worship and learn the law of
[6:15] god while the wolf and lamb peacefully
[6:17] feed
[6:18] together if you accept god's revelation
[6:21] of rome as mystery babylon you are among
[6:24] a large group of believers who have
[6:26] understood rome's place in scripture
[6:29] church fathers lactantius tertullian
[6:32] irenaeus and jerome taught this along
[6:35] with reformers martin luther john knox
[6:38] john calvin william tyndale and john
[6:41] wycliffe
[6:42] god has liberally granted his wisdom to
[6:44] many protestants that they might escape
[6:46] the false mother church rome and her
[6:49] daughter churches
[6:51] this chapter labors on rome's sins but i
[6:54] am by no means an expert on her rank
[6:56] rebellion and insatiable iniquity
[6:59] recommended reads include the two
[7:01] babylons by alexander hislop
[7:03] 1858
[7:05] and 50 years in the church of rome by
[7:07] charles chinekui 1885.
[7:12] biblical proof for the revelation of
[7:15] mystery babylon
[7:17] revelation chapter 17 and 18 are the
[7:19] main texts that reveal mystery babylon's
[7:21] identity as the roman catholic church
[7:24] but additional bible books prove this
[7:26] statement beyond doubt
[7:29] proof number one the catholic church is
[7:31] a woman
[7:32] revelation 17 verse 3 describes mystery
[7:35] babylon as a woman
[7:37] chapter 4 showed how a woman symbolizes
[7:39] a church in scripture and is easily seen
[7:41] through two examples the people of
[7:44] israel and the new testament church
[7:45] referred to as the bride or wife of
[7:48] christ
[7:50] israel is called the church in the
[7:52] wilderness in acts 7 verse 38 and is
[7:54] likened unto a woman in many cases such
[7:57] as ezekiel 16
[7:59] god calls israel harlot unto him
[8:02] israel's sister samaria has also been
[8:04] involved in abominations and whoredoms
[8:06] just as israel had
[8:08] john describes israel as a woman with a
[8:11] crown of twelve stars representing the
[8:13] twelve tribes of israel
[8:15] christ made of the seed of david is the
[8:18] man child who was to rule all nations
[8:20] with a rod of iron who was caught up
[8:22] unto god and to his
[8:24] throne the second example of a woman
[8:27] symbolizing a church is the new
[8:28] testament church referred to as the
[8:31] bride or wife of christ
[8:33] ephesians 5 verses 22 through 33 shows
[8:36] paul's teaching that a husband is to
[8:38] represent christ and a wife is to
[8:40] represent the new testament church
[8:42] in john 3 verse 29 john the baptist
[8:45] labels jesus christ as the bridegroom
[8:47] and his followers as the bride
[8:51] just as israel and the bride of jesus
[8:53] christ are symbolized as women so is the
[8:55] roman catholic church symbolized as the
[8:57] abominable woman of revelation 17.
[9:02] proof number two the catholic church is
[9:04] the modern day babylon
[9:06] revelation 17 verse 5 says this evil
[9:08] woman has babylon written upon her
[9:10] forehead
[9:11] babylon is first mentioned in genesis
[9:13] chapters 10 and 11 where we witness the
[9:16] origins of spiritual confusion at the
[9:18] tower of babel
[9:19] this group wanted to reach heaven by
[9:21] man-made memes while establishing a name
[9:24] for themselves
[9:25] god stopped their building by
[9:26] confounding their language
[9:29] the roman church is the modern babel
[9:31] because it promotes a false
[9:33] man-made path to heaven contrary to
[9:35] scripture
[9:36] in response to this failed religious
[9:38] system god has permitted confusing
[9:40] doctrine to deceive this church
[9:42] salvation is made confusing through
[9:44] catholic dogma which falsely adds a
[9:46] works requirement for salvation which
[9:49] one apologists calls an arduous process
[9:52] catholicism mandates an unscriptural
[9:54] post-death trip to purgatory
[9:57] just as original babel sought to exalt
[9:59] its own name roma also exalts its own
[10:02] name the holy see and mary's name
[10:05] mother of god
[10:06] far above the name of jesus christ
[10:10] further proof that the catholic church
[10:12] is babylon can be found in daniel
[10:14] chapter 2.
[10:15] in a dream nebuchadnezzar saw a great
[10:18] image and his babylonian kingdom was the
[10:20] head of gold
[10:21] babylon the literal kingdom fell to the
[10:24] medes and persians in daniel 5
[10:26] 28 who represented the great images
[10:29] silver breast and arms historically the
[10:33] grecian empire led by alexander the
[10:34] great was the next kingdom represented
[10:36] by the belly and thighs of brass
[10:39] the ancient roman empire followed the
[10:41] grecian and therefore was the legs of
[10:43] iron
[10:44] because the final earthly kingdom
[10:46] represented in the dream is rome mystery
[10:48] babylon must represent the roman power
[10:52] note carefully that rome is the final
[10:54] kingdom proven by the fact that only the
[10:56] second coming of jesus christ to earth
[10:59] symbolized as the stone cut out of the
[11:00] mountain that struck the image's feet
[11:03] can end rome's reign
[11:05] the first coming of christ did not end
[11:07] the roman empire
[11:08] more support is provided by daniel's
[11:10] description that the kingdom of christ
[11:12] will spread around the whole world or
[11:14] fill the whole earth
[11:16] when he the stone returns to end the
[11:19] roman reign
[11:20] christianity does not fill the whole
[11:22] earth at this moment for most
[11:24] governments ascribe to no official
[11:25] religion
[11:27] which church or woman is closely
[11:29] associated with the city of rome
[11:31] only the roman catholic church has this
[11:33] distinction
[11:35] you may be wondering how rome can still
[11:36] be ruling today since the roman empire
[11:39] fell in the 5th century
[11:41] revelation 13 verses 11 and 12 holds the
[11:44] answer for the beast or evil spirits
[11:46] motivating the roman empire
[11:48] that used to be ruling in babylon the
[11:50] medes and persians and grecians
[11:53] gained a new lease on life by migrating
[11:56] into the papacy
[11:57] the evil spirits of rome now rule
[11:59] through a global ecclesiastical
[12:01] influence rather than through military
[12:03] power
[12:04] the catholic church becomes the modern
[12:06] babylon because she is empowered by the
[12:08] same evil spirits but as a different
[12:10] appearance a church rather than an
[12:13] empire
[12:15] in addition to these bible witnesses we
[12:17] have a final prophetic witness that
[12:19] roman religion reigns until christ
[12:21] returns at armageddon william branham a
[12:24] prophet of god spoke with thus saith the
[12:27] lord that romanism would rule the world
[12:29] until jesus returns
[12:31] in march of 1962 branham said
[12:35] listen it's on tape now to the world i
[12:38] speak or wherever these tapes may go and
[12:40] to you people here no matter whatever
[12:42] happens to me you believe this
[12:44] russia communism isn't conquering
[12:47] nothing god's word can't fail
[12:49] romanism is going to conquer the world
[12:52] jesus christ was born into the roman
[12:54] kingdom and persecuted his first time
[12:57] come here by the roman kingdom
[13:00] and on his second advent coming now his
[13:02] message is persecuted by the roman
[13:04] denominations which is the mother of all
[13:07] of them
[13:08] and when he returns he will come back to
[13:09] wipe out that roman kingdom that the
[13:12] jews has always looked for him to come
[13:14] and wipe out the roman kingdom
[13:16] the catholic hierarchy with all the
[13:18] denominations in the world right now
[13:20] coming together as an organization the
[13:22] confederation of churches organizing
[13:24] themselves together it isn't russia it's
[13:27] rome thus saith the lord
[13:30] proof number three the catholic church
[13:32] is the mother of harlots like jezebel
[13:36] mystery babylon is called a mother in
[13:38] revelation 17 verse 5
[13:40] clearly representing she is the original
[13:42] or first church of her kind
[13:45] the roman catholic church is the first
[13:46] human organized man-led church
[13:49] god is not leading this mother of
[13:50] harlots
[13:52] the roman church unashamedly claims to
[13:55] be the mother church the church from
[13:57] which every church took its start
[13:59] specifically she is the mother of
[14:01] limiting the holy one of israel by her
[14:03] tradition-based worship
[14:05] jesus says unscriptural traditions make
[14:08] god's word of none effect
[14:10] ultimately producing vain worship
[14:13] rather than contending for the apostolic
[14:15] gospel her greatest efforts have been in
[14:17] publicly crucifying the effects of the
[14:19] holy ghost to god's people through
[14:21] idolatrous practices see proof number
[14:24] six
[14:25] the true church of the living god never
[14:27] denominated or organized like the
[14:29] catholic church did the roman church is
[14:32] not the original holy ghost filled book
[14:34] of acts church
[14:37] the mother title of the immoral mother
[14:39] church implies that she has daughters or
[14:41] children
[14:42] jesus identifies the mother and daughter
[14:45] harlots in revelation 2 verses 20
[14:48] through 24 calling the mother church
[14:50] jezebel as he pronounces judgment
[14:52] against both jezebel and her children
[14:56] jezebel clearly represents a church
[14:59] first women symbolize churches second
[15:02] she calls herself a prophetess claiming
[15:04] authority
[15:05] third she has doctrines plunging her
[15:07] into the depths of satan
[15:10] the mother jezebel is a fitting
[15:12] comparison for the roman church as both
[15:14] she and catholicism are linked to sexual
[15:17] immorality death and idolatry
[15:20] see figure 24
[15:22] athaliah jezebel's daughter had a
[15:25] murderous evil spirit just as her mother
[15:28] ezekiel 16 verse 44 states this proverb
[15:31] plainly
[15:32] as is the mother so is her daughter
[15:36] figure 24 jezebel's sexual immorality is
[15:39] found in second kings 9 22 and
[15:42] revelation 2 verse 20. the roman
[15:44] catholic church's sexual morality is
[15:46] found by the clergy and none sex abuse
[15:49] epidemic
[15:51] jezebel's love for death is found in
[15:53] first kings chapters 18 and 21.
[15:56] the roman catholic church's love for
[15:58] death is seen through their papal wars
[16:01] and the inquisition period
[16:04] jezebel's idolatry is seen in first
[16:06] kings 18 verse 19
[16:08] revelation 2 verse 20.
[16:11] the roman catholic church's idolatry is
[16:13] seen through their veneration of images
[16:15] and statues
[16:18] if the roman church is the mother of
[16:20] harlots who are the daughter harlots
[16:22] the daughters are all denominational and
[16:24] non-denominational churches that mimic
[16:27] the mother church
[16:28] these daughters behave exactly like
[16:30] their mother substituting traditional
[16:32] creeds for the true word while
[16:34] overlooking and legalizing sin
[16:37] a common thread binding the mother and
[16:38] daughters is the three-person
[16:40] polytheistic false teaching of the
[16:43] trinity
[16:44] their unity in false doctrine tritheism
[16:47] causes the daughter churches to justify
[16:49] their mother's evils
[16:51] failing to speak out against her past
[16:53] and current crimes against god
[16:55] proverbs 17 verse 15 says he that
[16:58] justifieth the wicked and he that
[17:00] condemneth the just
[17:01] even they both are abomination to the
[17:03] lord
[17:05] any church denying scripture while
[17:06] siding with and supporting the mother
[17:08] church is manifesting her daughterhood
[17:11] to the mother
[17:13] notice also the roman catholic church is
[17:15] the immoral mother church because she
[17:17] received the wrong seed or teaching
[17:20] god's word is likened unto seed in luke
[17:22] 8 11. the seed is the word of god but
[17:26] this mother church denies god's word and
[17:28] takes satan's lies or seed
[17:31] chapter 10 shows how the first mother
[17:33] eve also received the wrong seed by
[17:35] believing satan's lies
[17:38] proof number four the catholic church
[17:40] sits on many waters
[17:43] revelation 17 verse 1 and 15 describe
[17:46] the many waters on which the
[17:48] mystery babylon
[17:50] sits as people multitudes nations and
[17:53] tongues
[17:54] recent data shows how the catholic
[17:55] church sits on or has influence upon
[17:58] many peoples multitudes nations and
[18:00] tongues
[18:02] nearly 1.3 billion people are professing
[18:05] catholics
[18:06] 18 of the world's population
[18:08] nearly 222 000 parishes worldwide
[18:12] parishes in nearly every country on the
[18:15] earth
[18:16] nearly every nation has either
[18:17] diplomatic or other political relations
[18:20] with the holy see
[18:22] the number of catholics is greater than
[18:23] that of nearly all other religious
[18:26] traditions
[18:27] there are more roman catholics than all
[18:29] other christians combined and more roman
[18:31] catholics than all buddhists or hindus
[18:34] the world's two largest protestant
[18:36] churches are the anglican and methodists
[18:39] but they're estimated sizes of 80
[18:41] million members respectively falls far
[18:44] below catholicism's 1.3 billion members
[18:48] anglicans and methodists do not claim to
[18:49] be mother christian churches as the
[18:51] roman church does
[18:53] only the catholic church sits upon many
[18:55] waters
[18:58] proof number five the catholic church
[19:00] sits on seven mountains or hills
[19:03] along with sitting on many waters
[19:05] revelation 17 verse 9 says mystery
[19:07] babylon also sits upon seven mountains
[19:10] as well as sitting on many waters
[19:13] mountains can also be interpreted as
[19:14] hills in the greek lexicon
[19:17] the city of rome which is home of the
[19:18] vatican is famous for having seven hills
[19:21] on which the ancient city of rome was
[19:23] built while the vatican is not built
[19:25] among these seven hills it's a mere five
[19:27] miles from the ancient hills
[19:30] some say that the seven mountains
[19:32] reference could refer to a different
[19:34] location such as istanbul turkey
[19:37] it is true istanbul has seven hills the
[19:40] religious majority in istanbul are
[19:42] muslim the second largest religion in
[19:44] the world
[19:45] but istanbul is certainly not the
[19:47] headquarters or mother city of islam
[19:50] which distinction goes to mecca
[19:52] istanbul is not mystery babylon because
[19:54] it does not meet the other ten
[19:56] requirements needed to be considered
[19:58] mystery babylon
[20:01] proof number six
[20:02] the catholic church is a harlot or
[20:04] to christ revelation 17 verses 1 15 and
[20:09] 16 call mystery babylon a great or
[20:13] both terms originate from the same greek
[20:15] word porne and can be defined as one who
[20:18] yields herself to defilement for the
[20:21] sake of gain
[20:22] another meaning literally says pornei is
[20:25] babylon i.e rome the chief seed of
[20:28] idolatry
[20:29] observe the harlots two gray evils
[20:31] defilement for gain and idolatry
[20:36] the catholic church is a defiled
[20:38] to christ the husband because she claims
[20:40] to be the true church or wife of christ
[20:43] but is not faithful to his word
[20:45] romans 7 verse 4 says the true church
[20:48] that is married to christ will not add
[20:50] to or take away from her husband's word
[20:53] according to revelation 22 verses 18 and
[20:55] 19
[20:56] believers are clean
[20:58] only through jesus's word as he spoke in
[21:01] john 15 3 saying now ye are clean
[21:04] through the word which i have spoken
[21:06] unto you
[21:07] sadly this defiled unfaithful roman
[21:10] church receives and spreads false
[21:12] teachings against her professed husband
[21:14] christ the word for monetary gain
[21:19] like a harlot catholicism has received
[21:21] the wrong seed or false teachings of
[21:23] satan and shared those lies with peoples
[21:26] from nearly every nation
[21:28] revelation 17 verse 2 and
[21:31] revelation 18 verse 3 says she commits
[21:34] fornication with the kings and nations
[21:36] of the earth by pleasing governments and
[21:38] people rather than pleasing her
[21:40] professed husband christ
[21:42] for example during the pope's september
[21:45] 2015 visit to the united states his
[21:49] address to congress called for unity
[21:50] cooperation and peace but never
[21:53] mentioned the nearly 700 000 abortions
[21:56] or murders
[21:57] committed in clinics nationwide during
[21:59] that calendar year
[22:01] nor did he mention the nearly 54 million
[22:03] legal abortions committed since 1973.
[22:07] abortion is murder also called an
[22:09] abomination to god in deuteronomy 12
[22:12] 31
[22:13] if god heard innocent abel's blood cry
[22:16] to him from the ground
[22:17] would he not also hear the 54 million
[22:20] voices cry to him in his heavenly temple
[22:23] if the pope was a true man of god he
[22:25] would have rebuked america and cried out
[22:27] against her for these senseless
[22:29] cold-hearted murders rather than
[22:31] praising her and emphasizing climate
[22:33] change needs above the sanctity of life
[22:36] instead like a wolf in sheep's clothing
[22:38] he was welcomed by the masses with a
[22:40] fanfare of trumpets and a course of
[22:42] amends because he's a tickler of the
[22:44] ears a false prophet and a lover of
[22:47] pleasure more than a lover of god
[22:51] here's a very brief list of some of the
[22:53] seed or false doctrine the mother harlot
[22:55] has received from evil spirits then
[22:57] shared and spread all over the world
[22:59] with kings nations multitudes and
[23:02] peoples
[23:03] mandatory clerical celibacy
[23:06] the roman church forces all priests to
[23:08] be celibate which contradicts the bible
[23:10] truth that even peter was married whom
[23:12] they claimed to be the first pope
[23:14] the bible plainly teaches that jesus
[23:16] healed peter's mother-in-law in matthew
[23:18] 8 verses 14 and 15. paul the celibate
[23:22] prophet of god
[23:23] also taught that peter was married in
[23:25] 1st corinthians 9 verse 5.
[23:27] the apostle paul also wrote in first
[23:29] timothy 4 verses 1 through 3 that
[23:31] seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
[23:34] teach that marriage should be forbidden
[23:36] undoubtedly the worldwide clergy sex
[23:39] abuse epidemic is one result of this
[23:41] false teaching
[23:43] if paul's advice for believers to marry
[23:45] rather than burn with desire in first
[23:47] corinthians 7 verse 9 was obeyed there'd
[23:50] certainly be less abuse
[23:52] transubstantiation
[23:54] this false doctrine teaches that the
[23:56] bread and wine in the eucharist are
[23:58] changed in substance but not appearance
[24:01] into the literal body and blood of jesus
[24:04] catholics claim the eucharist becomes
[24:06] christ's real presence that is his body
[24:09] and blood
[24:10] this lie establishes idolatry the
[24:13] harlot's second great evil
[24:15] exalting common bread and wine into
[24:18] deity
[24:19] paul calls the wine a symbolic cup of
[24:21] blessing
[24:22] not a cup of liquid deity
[24:25] another proof the bread is not divine is
[24:26] paul's teaching that one can eat the
[24:28] bread unworthily reaping guilt and
[24:31] damnation upon himself
[24:33] divine bread eaten would instantly and
[24:36] eternally make the consumer divine but
[24:38] that is clearly not taught in holy writ
[24:41] paul also says we do not know jesus
[24:43] after the flesh anymore
[24:45] instead we know him by his holy spirit
[24:47] being the seal of god in our hearts or
[24:49] souls
[24:51] the pope office and its holy father
[24:53] title
[24:55] the bible never created the office of a
[24:56] pope which means father in latin the new
[25:00] testament preaching officers are apostle
[25:02] prophet teacher pastor and evangelist
[25:05] paul never ordains a pope office
[25:07] jesus christ thought we should call no
[25:09] man father in matthew 23 verse 9. the
[25:13] apostle paul never requested anyone call
[25:15] him father even though he gave charges
[25:17] to believers as a father doth his
[25:19] children said elder should be entreated
[25:21] as fathers
[25:22] described his relationship with timothy
[25:24] was as a son with the father and claimed
[25:27] the corinthians were begotten to christ
[25:29] through the gospel which paul preached
[25:32] the pope is commonly called holy father
[25:34] which is absolute heresy and man worship
[25:37] because the only time the title holy
[25:39] father is used in the bible is when
[25:41] jesus prayed to his father
[25:43] god almighty and called him holy father
[25:45] in john 17 verse 11. the pope is
[25:48] receiving worship and being called a
[25:50] title that was meant for god himself
[25:52] alone breaking the first commandment
[25:55] kissing a pope's ring or priest's hand
[25:58] and bowing to a pope or priest
[26:00] it is common to see people kissing the
[26:02] pope's right hand and even bowing to him
[26:05] as worshipers have been doing for
[26:07] centuries
[26:08] the bible teaches that we are not to bow
[26:10] to any man worship or kiss any man's
[26:13] hand
[26:14] this man worship breaks the first
[26:15] commandment
[26:17] veneration of statues and images
[26:20] the catechism of the catholic church
[26:22] states that the seventh ecumenical
[26:23] council at nicaea in 787 justified the
[26:27] veneration of images of christ the
[26:29] mother of god angels and all the saints
[26:32] while this council may have justified
[26:34] veneration the bible never did
[26:37] nevertheless catholics worldwide bow
[26:39] down to
[26:40] kiss rub and weep on images further
[26:43] exalting them in a way that god never
[26:45] commanded towards any image or man-made
[26:48] statue
[26:49] all these acts of veneration break the
[26:51] first commandment about having no other
[26:52] gods and making no graven image unto any
[26:55] likeness that is in heaven on earth or
[26:58] in the water
[27:00] idolatry is the second great
[27:02] evil as she is the chief global seed of
[27:04] idolatry spread through the worship of
[27:07] statues and images
[27:09] communion of the saints
[27:11] catholicism teaches that there can be an
[27:13] exchange of spiritual goods through
[27:15] prayers between the disciples currently
[27:17] on earth and those that are in glory
[27:20] catholics are to pray for the dead that
[27:22] they might be loose from their sins but
[27:24] the bible says jesus blood already
[27:26] forgives
[27:27] you all trespasses
[27:30] the catechism encourages believers to
[27:32] fly to marry the mother of god in prayer
[27:34] and request prayer from her
[27:37] nowhere in scripture does jesus teach
[27:38] christians to pray to and for believers
[27:41] who have already died and left the earth
[27:44] praying to anyone other than god is a
[27:46] form of spiritualism and should not be
[27:48] taught nor observed for if the heavenly
[27:50] saints of god are not being contacted it
[27:52] would mean that evil spirits are being
[27:54] contacted by those misguided prayers
[27:57] deifying the virgin mary the idolatrous
[28:00] practice of worshiping mary the mother
[28:02] of jesus runs deep in catholicism for
[28:04] mary is called the all-holy one and was
[28:07] supposedly preserved free from all stain
[28:10] of original sin hebrews 4 verse 15 and
[28:13] romans 3 23 plainly teach that jesus is
[28:16] the only person who never sinned and the
[28:19] rest of humanity has sinned and fallen
[28:21] short of god's glory
[28:23] mary was not all holy for she was a
[28:25] sinner saved by grace and rejoiced in
[28:27] god her savior in luke 1 verse 47.
[28:31] in revelation 5 verses 1 through 5
[28:33] jesus only not mary was found worthy to
[28:37] open the book and loose the seven seals
[28:40] additionally catholics exalt mary above
[28:42] god ascribing to her a saving office and
[28:45] the title's mother of god queen over all
[28:48] things advocate helper benefactors and
[28:52] mediatrix
[28:53] isaiah 43 verse 11 proclaims god is the
[28:56] only savior not mary
[28:59] the truth is that god the eternal spirit
[29:01] has no mother and mary was only mother
[29:04] to jesus's human mortal body
[29:06] jesus is the only mediator between god
[29:08] and men and our only advocate
[29:13] proof number seven the catholic church
[29:15] uses the scarlet and purple apparel
[29:18] revelation 17 verse 4 says the mother
[29:21] harlot is arrayed in purple and scarlet
[29:24] it is common to see priests archbishops
[29:26] and the pope frequently arrayed in these
[29:29] colors during annual festivals holy days
[29:32] and seasons of the church year
[29:34] you can do a google image search with
[29:36] the words pope scarlet purple and see
[29:39] hundreds of images of past and present
[29:41] popes priests bishops and archbishops
[29:44] adorning these distinctive colors
[29:48] proof number eight the catholic church
[29:49] is wealthy
[29:51] it's also clear from revelation 17 verse
[29:53] 4 that mystery babylon is a wealthy
[29:56] church as she is decked with gold and
[29:58] precious stones and pearls having a
[30:00] golden cup in her hand full of
[30:02] abominations
[30:03] and filthiness of her fornication the
[30:05] vatican receives free will donations
[30:08] from more than 1 billion catholics
[30:09] worldwide and has over 8 billion in
[30:12] assets
[30:13] vatican city also earns interest on its
[30:16] financial investments and has flocks of
[30:18] tourists and visitors for its museums
[30:20] galleries and libraries which hold their
[30:22] priceless collections
[30:24] the mass services of the roman church
[30:26] showcase golden cups and instruments
[30:28] with precious stones just as revelation
[30:31] 17 verse 4 foretold
[30:35] proof number nine
[30:36] the catholic church is drunken with the
[30:38] blood of the saints
[30:40] revelation 17 verse 6 says mystery
[30:42] babylon is drunken with the blood of the
[30:44] saints and with the blood of the martyrs
[30:46] of jesus
[30:47] is it possible that the catholic church
[30:49] is responsible for the death of millions
[30:51] of true christians
[30:52] history demonstrates that there was much
[30:54] corruption in the roman church and
[30:57] potpourri during the roman empire and
[30:59] middle ages
[31:00] protestant historians recorded medieval
[31:02] roman church practices
[31:04] in the most negative terms and recall
[31:06] the massive corruption of catholic
[31:08] church leaders including adulteries
[31:11] bribes extravagant papal art and
[31:13] architecture projects and most
[31:15] destructive wars of conquest
[31:19] samuel schmucker author of the glorious
[31:21] reformation details the horrifying
[31:24] tyranny and persecution by the catholic
[31:26] church during the middle ages he
[31:28] estimates the roman church was
[31:30] responsible for the deaths of nearly 68
[31:32] million christians who dissented from
[31:34] her teachings
[31:36] this massive slaughter was possible
[31:37] through the catholic inquisition and
[31:40] crusades against heretics which are
[31:42] undeniable historical examples of the
[31:44] roman church being drunken with the
[31:46] blood of the saints
[31:48] revelation 18 verse 24 traces all the
[31:50] slain back to catholicism
[31:53] and in her was found the blood of
[31:54] prophets and of saints and of all that
[31:56] were slain upon the earth
[32:00] proof number 10
[32:02] the catholic church's headquarters is a
[32:04] great city
[32:05] revelation 17 verse 18 says mystery
[32:08] babylon is that great city which
[32:10] reigneth over the kings of the earth
[32:12] the vatican is certainly a great city
[32:14] for this city-state is the epitome of
[32:16] church and state
[32:17] located on the west bank of the tiber
[32:19] river the vatican is the world's
[32:21] smallest fully independent nation-state
[32:24] it operates tax-free and has its own
[32:26] telephone system post office gardens
[32:29] astronomical observatory radio station
[32:32] banking system and pharmacy as well as a
[32:35] contingent of swiss guards responsible
[32:38] for the personal safety of the pope
[32:39] since 1506.
[32:43] history validates how the vatican has
[32:45] reigned over the kings of the earth
[32:47] particularly in europe beginning in the
[32:48] 5th century reaching its height of power
[32:51] during the middle ages then starting its
[32:53] decline in the 19th century napoleon
[32:56] bonaparte famously symbolized the
[32:58] vatican's decline in power when he
[33:00] snatched the french crown from the
[33:01] pope's hands to crown himself at his
[33:04] coronation rather than bowing to him in
[33:06] 1804
[33:08] previously the holy see exercised power
[33:10] over europe's kings and monarchs recent
[33:13] popes have had shrinking political
[33:15] legacies rather than being major players
[33:17] in world politics like popes from the
[33:18] middle ages
[33:20] still vatican influence has flexed its
[33:22] muscle at times as pope john paul ii is
[33:26] credited with influencing kings or
[33:28] rulers of the earth by helping to end
[33:30] the cold war
[33:31] according to former soviet leader
[33:33] mikhail gorbachev
[33:35] former polish senator andres
[33:37] sichipiroski
[33:39] said pope john paul's pontificate was
[33:41] responsible for the downfall of
[33:43] communistic rule worldwide
[33:45] no church other than the catholic church
[33:47] can claim to be a great city and have
[33:49] influence politically and spiritually
[33:52] over the earth's leaders like vatican
[33:54] city
[33:56] proof number 11 the catholic church
[33:58] rides the beast the spirit of ancient
[34:00] rome
[34:01] revelation 17 verse 3 explains mystery
[34:04] babylon is to sit upon a scarlet colored
[34:06] beast
[34:07] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[34:09] heads and ten horns
[34:11] by examining each of these descriptions
[34:13] you can fully recognize that the
[34:15] catholic church sits on or rides upon
[34:17] the spirit of ancient rome scarlet was
[34:20] covered in proof number seven
[34:23] in bible symbolism a beast represents a
[34:25] human kingdom as taught in daniel 7
[34:28] verse 23 the fourth beast shall be the
[34:30] fourth kingdom upon the earth
[34:32] daniel chapter 7 lists only four
[34:34] kingdoms upon the earth until the second
[34:36] coming of jesus christ to the earth
[34:39] this time the kingdoms are symbolized as
[34:41] animals rather than as sections of a man
[34:44] like in nebuchadnezzar's dream in daniel
[34:46] chapter 2. proof number 2 details these
[34:48] kingdoms
[34:50] babylon is the lion the medes and
[34:52] persians are the bear
[34:53] the grecians are the leopard and rome is
[34:56] the dreadful and terrible beast with
[34:57] great iron teeth
[34:59] though this beast or ancient roman
[35:01] empire fell in the 5th century it had
[35:04] already gained new spiritual authority
[35:06] through emperor constantine in the 4th
[35:08] century
[35:09] when constantine changed the empire's
[35:11] capital from rome to constantinople in
[35:14] 330 rome's civil authority was weakened
[35:17] but its spiritual authority was
[35:18] strengthened the title supreme priest
[35:21] pontifex maximus which had been the
[35:24] prerogative of the emperor now devolved
[35:26] upon the pope
[35:28] constantine's move was a fulfillment of
[35:30] john's prophecy in revelation 13 verses
[35:33] 1-3 for this beast was wounded to death
[35:36] but his deadly wound was healed
[35:38] the ancient roman empire died or fell in
[35:41] the fifth century but the spirit of rome
[35:43] and its evil influence lived on through
[35:45] the roman catholic church
[35:47] observe that this one beast out of the
[35:49] sea is a combination of the four beasts
[35:51] mentioned in daniel 7
[35:54] like a leopard grecians
[35:56] feet of a bear medes and persians mouth
[35:59] of a lion
[36:00] babylon and ten horns rome
[36:03] all the violent evil demons who
[36:05] inhabited each ancient kingdom never
[36:07] died they have only changed their
[36:09] dwelling places living now in the
[36:11] catholic system
[36:12] the power the roman church rides upon
[36:14] comes from evil spirits revelation 18
[36:17] verse 2 validates this truth for mystery
[36:19] babylon is the habitation of devils and
[36:21] the hold of every foul spirit and a cage
[36:24] of every unclean and hateful bird
[36:27] just as each ancient kingdom sought
[36:29] world dominance so the roman church
[36:31] seeks global influence and religious
[36:33] dominance writing the demonic beastly
[36:36] power that divides and conquers all
[36:38] nations peoples multitudes and tongues
[36:43] triple blasphemy
[36:45] revelation 13 verse 6 says and he opened
[36:48] his mouth and blasphemy against god to
[36:50] blaspheme his name and his tabernacle
[36:53] and then the dwell in heaven
[36:55] the beast or spirit of rome blasphemes
[36:57] god in three ways his name tabernacle
[37:01] and the saints that dwell in heaven
[37:03] the spirit of roman catholicism
[37:05] blasphemes god's name the lord jesus
[37:07] christ
[37:08] by substituting it with holy trinity and
[37:11] with the titles father son and holy
[37:13] ghost
[37:14] mass services and catholic wedding
[37:16] ceremonies issue prayers and blessings
[37:18] in the name of the father son and holy
[37:20] spirit rather than using the name of
[37:22] jesus christ
[37:24] in holy writ the father son and holy
[37:27] spirit titles were never used in worship
[37:29] or in blessing
[37:30] colossians 3 verse 17 commands us to do
[37:33] all things whether in word or deed in
[37:35] the name of the lord jesus christ
[37:38] ephesians 3 verse 15 and philippians 2
[37:41] verses 9 through 11 teach that the name
[37:43] of jesus christ is the name above all
[37:45] names
[37:46] that the entire family of god in heaven
[37:48] and earth is named the lord jesus christ
[37:52] the roman church does not hollow god's
[37:54] revealed name the lord jesus christ as
[37:56] jesus taught us in his model prayer
[37:59] hallowed be thy name
[38:01] god's heavenly tabernacle is blasphemed
[38:04] because rome calls itself the eternal
[38:06] city and decks the vatican with
[38:08] priceless artwork gold and precious
[38:10] valuables of incalculable measure
[38:14] rome is not eternal for her plagues come
[38:16] in one day and she will be judged in one
[38:18] hour because strong is a lord god who
[38:21] judgeth her
[38:22] the new jerusalem vividly described in
[38:25] revelation chapters 21 and 22 is the
[38:28] true and only eternal city that is
[38:30] coming to earth from heaven and god not
[38:33] man is its builder and maker
[38:37] rome has blasting the saints that dwell
[38:39] in heaven through the practice of
[38:40] communion of saints or the teaching that
[38:43] men should pray to the saints rather
[38:44] than to god himself
[38:46] first timothy 2 verse 5 says jesus
[38:48] christ is the only mediator between god
[38:50] and man and christ never taught anyone
[38:52] to pray to mary or any other believer
[38:55] any true believer whether alive or dead
[38:57] would instantly reject any prayers
[38:59] sacrifice or worship directed to
[39:01] themselves just as paul and barnabas did
[39:04] in acts 14 verses 1 through 18.
[39:07] after god healed a through
[39:09] paul's divinely given words at lystra
[39:11] the natives were preparing to make
[39:13] sacrifices to paul and barnabas but
[39:15] these wise apostles were able to talk
[39:17] them out of their idolatry our lesson is
[39:19] that human beings are never honored with
[39:22] sacrifices prayers or worship for these
[39:24] expressions are reserved for god alone
[39:28] the mark of the beast
[39:30] since the catholic church rides the
[39:31] beast or spirit of rome you can now
[39:33] understand the mark of the beast
[39:35] revelation 13 verses 16 through 18 says
[39:39] and he causeth all both small and great
[39:41] rich and poor free and bond to receive a
[39:44] mark in their right hand or in their
[39:46] foreheads and that no man might buy or
[39:49] sell save he that hath the mark or the
[39:51] name of the beast or the number of his
[39:53] name
[39:54] here is wisdom let him that hath
[39:56] understanding count the number of the
[39:57] beast for it is the number of a man and
[39:59] his number is 600 threescore and six
[40:04] god's spiritual mark for his children is
[40:06] the baptism of the holy ghost upon the
[40:08] christian soul paul and john call god's
[40:11] spiritual mark a seal
[40:13] while most people think satan's mark
[40:14] will be a computer chip tattoo or other
[40:17] physical mark scripture teaches the
[40:19] opposite as the beast mark is also a
[40:22] spiritual mark an unbeliever receives
[40:24] after rejecting god's mark while the
[40:26] mark of the beast movement may culminate
[40:28] with the implantation of a computer chip
[40:30] during the great tribulation
[40:32] the mark itself begins as a rebellious
[40:34] stubborn and prideful human spirit
[40:38] both marks
[40:40] god's seal mark and satan's beast mark
[40:42] are spiritual marks that can be received
[40:44] today
[40:45] god's mark the seal of the baptism of
[40:48] the holy ghost is received spiritually
[40:50] when a christian fully obeys god's
[40:51] requirements for the new birth
[40:54] acts 5 32 said god gives the holy ghost
[40:56] to them that obey him
[40:58] obedience always requires sacrifice for
[41:01] the new birth christians must sacrifice
[41:03] their own will fully dying out to their
[41:05] selfish desires
[41:07] chapter 5 explains how christians die
[41:09] out or crucify the following sins
[41:12] unbelief hypocrisy reasonings sensuality
[41:16] impatience irreverence selfishness and
[41:19] resistance
[41:22] satan's spiritual mark is received when
[41:23] unbelievers reject god's seal by
[41:26] disobeying his path to the baptism of
[41:28] the holy ghost
[41:30] cain is the first pre-figure of someone
[41:31] receiving the mark of the beast
[41:33] not only did cain know god's perfect
[41:35] will animal sacrifice from god himself
[41:38] but he also told him he could rule over
[41:40] his sin nature if he simply obeyed
[41:43] cain like his father that wicked one
[41:46] blatantly rejected god's word and soon
[41:48] murdered his brother
[41:49] it seems god gave cain a physical mark
[41:52] so that other men would not kill him as
[41:54] he wasted his life wandering like a
[41:56] fugitive and vagabond
[41:59] genesis shows the beginning of both
[42:01] marks as cain was the first marked and
[42:03] immediately left the presence of god
[42:06] true believers are marked by constant
[42:07] worship dwelling in god's presence as
[42:10] seth's example proves in genesis 4 verse
[42:12] 26
[42:14] and to seth to him also there was born a
[42:17] son and he called his name enos
[42:20] then began men to call upon the name of
[42:22] the lord
[42:24] unbelievers after cain did not receive a
[42:26] physical mark but instead took a
[42:28] spiritual mark for rejecting god's path
[42:30] to salvation
[42:32] these wicked evil cane-like rejecters of
[42:35] god's love are termed as reprobate in
[42:38] jeremiah 6 30. romans 1 verse 28 2
[42:42] timothy 3 verse 8 and titus 1 verse 16.
[42:45] in the greek lexicon reprobate means not
[42:48] standing the test not approved unfit for
[42:51] unproved
[42:52] spurious
[42:54] according to romans 1 verses 28 through
[42:56] 32 god gives a person over to a
[42:59] reprobate mind who continually refuses
[43:02] his love refusing to retain his word in
[43:04] his mind while having pleasure in
[43:06] committing wicked abominable acts
[43:09] because god's love is so great his eyes
[43:12] run to and fro throughout the whole
[43:13] earth seeking each soul and offering
[43:15] salvation
[43:17] the father is always seeking true
[43:18] worshipers according to john 4 23
[43:22] there will be no excuses for the
[43:23] reprobates who reject god's continual
[43:25] offer of love on the day of judgment
[43:27] because god has revealed his power and
[43:29] godhead to every person through his
[43:31] creation and the human body
[43:35] rejection is the key word for
[43:36] understanding the mark of the beast
[43:38] god desires almond to be saved but few
[43:40] there be that will find it meaning most
[43:43] will reject his gracious offer
[43:45] god foreshadowed the mark of the beast
[43:46] in the old testament with another
[43:48] physical mark called an awl
[43:50] or permanent hearing given to jewish
[43:52] slaves who purposely rejected freedom
[43:55] and wanted to remain slaves forever
[43:58] jewish slaves served six years but in
[44:01] the seventh year they could go free
[44:03] exodus 21 6 and deuteronomy 15 17 detail
[44:07] this mark for slaves who rejected their
[44:09] god-given inheritance which included all
[44:12] the blessings of the land of their
[44:13] forefathers
[44:15] today unbelievers show their spiritual
[44:17] ears are marked with satan's mark when
[44:19] they reject the good news of the gospel
[44:22] offering them freedom from sin through
[44:24] the holy spirit
[44:25] they choose to love sin and remain a
[44:27] slave to it rather than ruling over it
[44:29] like cain should have done
[44:32] believers submit to god's spirit and
[44:34] live righteously and godly in this
[44:36] present world
[44:38] the mark in the right hand or forehead
[44:41] according to revelation 13 verse 17
[44:44] buying and selling during the great
[44:46] tribulation will only be accomplished
[44:48] through one of three ways the mark or
[44:50] the name of the beast or the number of
[44:52] his name
[44:55] first the mark of the beast can be in
[44:56] the right hand or the forehead the right
[44:59] hand mark symbolizes one who has
[45:01] promised or made an oath of allegiance
[45:03] to do the works of the beast under the
[45:05] guise of peace and safety
[45:08] in this case the right hand mark may be
[45:09] called the right hand of falsehood and
[45:12] means that all people including church
[45:14] members will have to do the will of the
[45:15] one world church system hands can
[45:18] represent works as god promised to bless
[45:21] obedient israel in all the works of
[45:23] thine hands
[45:24] simple submission in obedience to the
[45:26] will of the antichrist for the sake of
[45:28] financial gain will cause people to take
[45:31] his mark
[45:33] the mark in the forehead means the beast
[45:35] followers will boldly and unashamedly
[45:38] accept the false doctrines of the world
[45:39] church system which includes
[45:41] trinitarianism universalism and other
[45:44] doctrines not found in scripture
[45:46] the forehead protects the area of brain
[45:48] known as the frontal lobe where
[45:49] decisions are made speech is formed and
[45:52] reasoning occurs
[45:53] it is fitting that god represents the
[45:55] forehead
[45:56] a persuaded made up mind
[45:58] as a hard stone such as flint god told
[46:01] ezekiel that he would make his forehead
[46:03] strong against their the house of israel
[46:06] foreheads
[46:07] sinners foreheads have minds unashamed
[46:09] of committing evil while god promised to
[46:12] mark the foreheads of believers who
[46:14] sighed and cried against all the
[46:15] abominations done in jerusalem as a sign
[46:18] they would be delivered from destruction
[46:20] both god followers and beast followers
[46:23] have marked foreheads and each person
[46:25] must choose the mark he will receive
[46:29] the mark of his name
[46:31] the second means of buying and selling
[46:33] that will take place in the great
[46:34] tribulation is through the name of the
[46:36] beast
[46:37] revelation 14 verse 11 teaches sinners
[46:40] will receive the mark of his name
[46:42] the name of the beast has two
[46:43] applications because there is one name
[46:45] for the person of the antichrist
[46:47] the beast figurehead
[46:49] while the beast or spirit of rome is
[46:51] full of names of blasphemy
[46:54] the antichrist name is the name of one
[46:56] man as taught in revelation 13 verses 17
[46:59] and 18 which says the number of his name
[47:02] it is the number of a man
[47:04] what is the name of the man who will be
[47:06] the antichrist
[47:07] it is the vicar of christ the
[47:09] blasphemous title given to the pope of
[47:11] rome who is said to have full supreme
[47:14] and universal power over the whole
[47:15] church
[47:16] a power which he can always exercise
[47:19] unhindered
[47:20] vicar means substitute originating from
[47:22] the latin word vicarius
[47:25] consider the other official names the
[47:26] pope has given
[47:28] bishop of rome vicar of jesus christ
[47:30] successor of the prince of the apostles
[47:34] supreme pontiff of the universal church
[47:36] patriarch of the west
[47:38] primate of italy
[47:40] metropolitan archbishop of the province
[47:42] of rome sovereign of the state of
[47:44] vatican city servant of the servants of
[47:47] god
[47:48] submitting to the name of the antichrist
[47:51] the roman vicar of jesus christ is equal
[47:53] to receiving the mark of the beast
[47:57] the beast or roman spirit is full of
[47:59] names of blasphemy according to
[48:01] revelation 17 verse 3.
[48:03] what are the beasts many names of
[48:05] blasphemy
[48:06] they are the different names of
[48:08] so-called christian churches all
[48:10] claiming to be true churches
[48:12] for there are thousands of religious
[48:13] denominations existing within the united
[48:15] states and undoubtedly thousands more
[48:18] worldwide
[48:19] muse on this for a moment
[48:21] thousands of different names catholic
[48:23] luther methodist baptism presbyterian to
[48:26] name just a few
[48:27] all claiming to be genuine churches of
[48:29] jesus christ without the power and
[48:31] character of true christianity
[48:35] most church members cuss blasphemy enjoy
[48:38] social drinking drunkenness
[48:40] watch sinful tv shows and movies lusts
[48:44] commit sexual sins fornication and
[48:46] adultery and justify themselves above
[48:50] others pride
[48:52] both peter and paul condemn all of these
[48:54] sins and more stating that christians
[48:56] are free from these sins and that they
[48:58] were committed before a person's
[49:00] conversion to christ in time past of our
[49:02] life
[49:05] just for an example imagine the
[49:06] blasphemy of a church of christ member
[49:08] enjoying a routine pleasure-filled
[49:10] sin-filled weekend
[49:12] on friday night he goes to a sports bar
[49:14] with the guys leaving his wife and
[49:16] children at home
[49:17] to enjoy a basketball game while getting
[49:19] drunk gossiping complaining and cursing
[49:22] players coaches and fans alike
[49:24] perhaps he flirts with another man's
[49:26] wife and gets her phone number in
[49:28] anticipation of a future affair
[49:30] on saturday after wasting the morning
[49:32] hours watching his favorite sinful
[49:33] netflix shows he takes his wife and
[49:36] children to the mall to purchase
[49:37] immodest
[49:38] sexually suggestive swimwear for their
[49:40] upcoming vacation
[49:42] to make the children happy he purchases
[49:43] the newest violent provocative and
[49:46] graphic video games
[49:47] they finish the night going out to eat
[49:49] before catching a movie that exposes
[49:51] them to murders blasphemies sexual
[49:54] morality lusts and lashes
[49:56] due to their exhaustion from the
[49:58] sin-filled weekend the family sleeps in
[50:00] and skips church on sunday but will
[50:02] spend the rest of the day preparing to
[50:03] host their super bowl party
[50:06] it's plain to see that this church of
[50:07] christ member and his family spent their
[50:09] entire weekend blasting the very name
[50:11] they claim to represent jesus christ
[50:14] if i call this man a catholic instead
[50:16] which means a member of the universal
[50:18] church
[50:19] then he just blasphemed jesus's true
[50:21] universal church the wife or bride of
[50:24] christ
[50:26] please remember that i am not attacking
[50:27] the people inside these churches but the
[50:30] antichrist spirit that is guiding their
[50:32] systems
[50:33] because their church bylaws creeds and
[50:35] leaders allow this type of blasphemous
[50:37] behavior
[50:38] the countless church members who live
[50:40] this way are fulfilling jesus's
[50:42] denunciation in revelation 3 verse 1. i
[50:45] know thy works that thou hast a name
[50:47] that thou livest and are dead
[50:49] unconverted sin loving church members
[50:51] have church names they live or confess
[50:54] church of god church of christ etc
[50:57] but are spiritually dead
[50:59] the beast is full of these blasphemous
[51:01] names and these church joiners know
[51:03] nothing of christ's power to make them
[51:05] new creatures
[51:06] therefore if any man be in christ he's a
[51:08] new creature old things are passed away
[51:11] behold all things are become new
[51:15] clinging to one of these thousands of
[51:17] blasphemous names by church joining and
[51:20] rejecting the new creature born again
[51:22] experience is essentially receiving the
[51:24] mark of the beast
[51:27] thus saith the lord on the mark of the
[51:29] beast
[51:31] it's imperative to share that god sent a
[51:32] prophet named william branham see
[51:34] chapter 13 to provide god's warning in
[51:37] revelation regarding the mark of the
[51:39] beast
[51:40] having rejected god's mark the baptism
[51:43] of the holy ghost the beast's followers
[51:45] will join rome's evil worldwide
[51:47] economical move through accepting the
[51:49] mark in one of three ways
[51:51] in the forehead or hand
[51:53] accepting the name of the beast or
[51:55] accepting the number of his name
[51:58] the three succeeding statements about
[52:00] the mark of the beast are available to
[52:02] read and listen to online at no cost
[52:04] the holy ghost inspired branham to share
[52:06] these statements while stamping each
[52:08] with thus saith the lord god's
[52:10] authoritative phrase signaling his
[52:12] divine will
[52:13] on may 4th 1954 branham preached without
[52:16] the seal of god which is the baptism of
[52:18] the holy ghost confederation of apostasy
[52:21] is the mark of the beast that's thus
[52:23] saith the lord
[52:25] on january 19 1964 branham announced i
[52:29] know it's unpopular to speak against
[52:31] organization but that's the mark of the
[52:33] beast that's the thing that's carrying
[52:35] us right into that it's making an image
[52:37] under the beast i don't say that for to
[52:39] be angry i say that because it's the
[52:42] truth brethren the day will come when
[52:43] phoenix will raise up maybe i'm going on
[52:46] but you'll know that that was thus saith
[52:48] the lord
[52:49] on august 23 1964 branham said thus
[52:53] saith the lord that same thing
[52:55] unionization will take place in religion
[52:58] you belong to denomination of some sort
[53:00] or you cannot buy or sell
[53:04] the number of the beast's name
[53:06] the third and final way by buying and
[53:08] selling will take place during the great
[53:09] tribulation is through the number of the
[53:11] beast
[53:12] the name of the beast has a number for
[53:14] is the number of a man 666
[53:17] many have guessed as to what the number
[53:19] 666 represents but there's one clear
[53:22] answer in revelation
[53:24] since the beast is the spirit of rome
[53:26] the single man who is the head of the
[53:28] roman spirit seeking to unite all people
[53:31] under his leadership can be none other
[53:33] than the pope of the roman catholic
[53:34] church
[53:37] how does the pope's name equal 666
[53:40] the title vicarius philae dei
[53:43] or vicar of gods in latin has been
[53:45] associated to the pope's office for
[53:47] centuries
[53:49] when the title vicarius file day is
[53:51] added up using roman numerals the sum is
[53:54] 666 as seen in figure 25.
[53:58] note that u and v were used
[54:00] interchangeably until the middle ages
[54:03] while some contest the validity of the
[54:05] title vicarious file day
[54:07] saying its earliest appearance is found
[54:09] in a forgery
[54:10] it is incontestable that the catechism
[54:13] of the catholic church
[54:14] exalts the pope's office as vicar of
[54:16] christ even to this day
[54:19] vicar translates to vicarius in latin
[54:22] add to this fact the eleven proofs of
[54:24] rome is mystery babylon and it seems
[54:26] very probable that the pope at some
[54:28] point in the past held the title
[54:30] vicarius fellaini day vicar of god's as
[54:33] it is nearly synonymous to his current
[54:35] title vicar of christ
[54:39] the image of the beast
[54:41] revelation 13 verses 14 and 15
[54:44] unveils the beast's plan for humanity to
[54:47] make an image to the beast which had the
[54:49] wound by a sword and did live since the
[54:52] beast or spirit of rome is invisible it
[54:54] seeks an image for itself which is a
[54:56] worldwide economical council
[54:59] these organized churches will get
[55:01] together in a union with the roman
[55:02] catholic church
[55:05] it seems likely that the world council
[55:06] of churches will be the main component
[55:08] of this worldwide image unto the beast
[55:11] as this organization represents nearly
[55:14] 500 million christians and literally
[55:16] seeks visible unity or an image for
[55:18] christians this council is a false unity
[55:21] for any union without union upon true
[55:24] doctrine is erroneous
[55:26] the world council of churches has member
[55:28] churches who hold false doctrines that
[55:29] allow homosexuality adultery and
[55:32] lasciviousness just to name a few
[55:35] these churches do not have unity like
[55:36] jesus unity with the father for jesus
[55:39] always did those things that please the
[55:41] father the world counsels churches allow
[55:43] sins that displease and grieve the
[55:45] heavenly father
[55:48] jesus did pray for christian unity in
[55:50] john 17 verse 11 that they may be one as
[55:53] we are the bible teaches true unity only
[55:55] comes through adherence to the one faith
[55:58] john states christians should have no
[56:00] unity with teachers of false doctrine
[56:02] saying whosoever transgresseth
[56:05] and abideth not in the doctrine of
[56:06] christ hath not god
[56:08] he that abideth in the doctrine of
[56:10] christ he hath both the father and the
[56:12] son
[56:13] if there come any unto you and bring not
[56:15] this doctrine receive him not into your
[56:18] house neither bid him god speed for he
[56:20] that bideth him godspeed is partaker of
[56:22] his evil deeds
[56:25] all churches who reject true bible
[56:26] doctrine and join the world council of
[56:28] churches in a false unity manifest that
[56:31] they are true daughters of the mother
[56:32] harlot the roman catholic church
[56:36] the image of the beast or world council
[56:38] of churches will play a major role in
[56:40] the future great tribulation
[56:42] helping lay down the mark of the beast
[56:44] revelation 13 verse 15 says the beast
[56:47] gives life unto the image of the beast
[56:49] that the image of the beast should both
[56:51] speak and cause that as many as would
[56:52] not worship the image of the beast
[56:54] should be killed
[56:56] the ecumenical move will become so
[56:58] strong politically that governments will
[57:00] enact laws forcing all churches to come
[57:02] under dominion of the world council
[57:04] which is under rome's dominion
[57:06] great pressure to join will be placed
[57:08] upon everyone for this unionized church
[57:10] and state system controls finances and
[57:13] will have power to kill anyone who
[57:15] descends
[57:18] the false prophet or person of the
[57:20] antichrist
[57:22] revelation 19 verse 20 and chapter 20
[57:25] verse 10 describe the judgment of a
[57:27] false prophet who is closely connected
[57:29] to the beast or spirit of rome
[57:31] a prophet is one who speaks for god
[57:34] who is this false prophet who claims to
[57:36] speak for god but teaches false doctrine
[57:38] and is closely connected to rome
[57:41] he can be none other than the pope of
[57:42] rome
[57:44] the catholic catechism teaches that the
[57:45] pope has the authority of christ and has
[57:48] an infallibility in virtue of his office
[57:51] when he teaches on matters of faith and
[57:52] morals yet the pope and his church are
[57:55] filled with false doctrine making his
[57:57] office the false prophet connected to
[57:59] the beast or roman spirit
[58:02] one of those false doctrines was
[58:04] assigning the title holy father to the
[58:06] pope a title given only to the heavenly
[58:08] father by jesus in john 17 11.
[58:11] any pope who accepts his title shows his
[58:13] completely blind spiritual condition for
[58:16] he is robbing god of his sacred
[58:18] distinguished title
[58:20] a modern example showing the pope is a
[58:22] false prophet is the assumption of mary
[58:24] dogma from 1950.
[58:27] pope pius xii announced
[58:29] mary the mother of jesus was taken
[58:31] assumed into heaven body and soul
[58:34] following the end of her life on earth
[58:36] there is absolutely no historical or new
[58:39] testament proof for this claim as it
[58:41] seeks only to further exalt and deify
[58:43] mary
[58:44] instead it remains a false doctrine from
[58:46] the false prophet
[58:49] another common name for the false
[58:51] prophet is the antichrist or the person
[58:53] who will rule deceive and influence the
[58:56] entire world during the great
[58:57] tribulation
[58:59] 2 thessalonians 2 verses 3 through 13 is
[59:02] a detailed description of him and his
[59:04] blasphemous actions
[59:06] he's called the man of sin
[59:08] he's called the son of perdition
[59:10] he's called that wicked
[59:12] in jerusalem's future rebuilt temple he
[59:15] opposeth and exalteth himself above all
[59:17] that is called god or that is worshipped
[59:20] so that he is god sitteth in the temple
[59:22] of god showing himself that he is god
[59:25] his coming is after the working of satan
[59:27] with all power and signs and lying
[59:29] wonders just as the false prophet is
[59:31] said to work miracles in revelation 19
[59:34] verse 20.
[59:35] he deceives with unrighteousness and
[59:37] lies allowing his followers to live in
[59:40] the pleasures of sin
[59:42] those who overcome him will be believers
[59:44] and lovers of truth
[59:47] another prophetic book daniel provides
[59:49] more support and evidence about the
[59:51] false prophet or antichrist pope's
[59:53] future plans
[59:55] daniel 8 verses 23-25 is a compound
[59:59] prophecy fulfilled first by antiochus iv
[1:00:03] from 175 to 164 bc
[1:00:06] and has a future fulfillment in the
[1:00:08] false prophet pope for he shall also
[1:00:10] stand up against the prince of princes
[1:00:12] jesus christ the antichrist pope will
[1:00:15] have political policy to cause financial
[1:00:17] craft to prosper magnifying himself in
[1:00:20] his heart
[1:00:21] all nations will support the false
[1:00:23] prophet pope because of his successful
[1:00:25] political and financial solutions
[1:00:29] daniel 9 verse 27 states he the
[1:00:32] antichrist pope will make a one week or
[1:00:34] seven year covenant with many but will
[1:00:36] break it after three and a half years in
[1:00:38] the midst of the week
[1:00:40] causing orthodox jews to cease offering
[1:00:42] their animal sacrifices and oblations in
[1:00:45] their newly built temple
[1:00:47] this three and a half year period in the
[1:00:48] great tribulation is the same period
[1:00:50] israel's two anointed witnesses or
[1:00:52] prophets are prophesying and manifesting
[1:00:55] god's power
[1:00:56] according to revelation 11 verses 2 and
[1:00:58] 3.
[1:01:00] daniel 11 verses 21 through 31 is
[1:01:03] another compound prophecy fulfilled by
[1:01:06] antiochus iv but with a future
[1:01:08] fulfillment in the antichrist pope
[1:01:10] the vile person or antichrist pope will
[1:01:13] make a peaceful league or covenant with
[1:01:15] israel through deceit and flatteries
[1:01:18] his deceitful heart will be against the
[1:01:19] holy covenant and he will pollute the
[1:01:22] newly built israeli sanctuary by taking
[1:01:24] away the daily sacrifice
[1:01:27] daniel 11 verses 36 through 45 is
[1:01:31] prophecy solely about the antichrist
[1:01:33] pope
[1:01:34] see the connection to 2 thessalonians 2
[1:01:36] verse 4 as the pope will speak against
[1:01:38] god exalting and magnifying himself
[1:01:41] above everyone and everything
[1:01:44] you learn the antichrist pope will enter
[1:01:46] into the glorious land jerusalem and try
[1:01:49] to set up his own tabernacle in the
[1:01:50] glorious holy mountain
[1:01:52] god will let him swiftly come to his end
[1:01:54] though and none shall help him
[1:01:58] catholicism in the united states
[1:02:01] have you ever wondered if the united
[1:02:02] states a world superpower is mentioned
[1:02:05] in the bible
[1:02:06] god's spirit has foretold the prophetic
[1:02:08] description of the united states in
[1:02:10] revelation chapter 13. but did you
[1:02:12] notice that there are two beasts in
[1:02:14] revelation 13
[1:02:15] the first is the beast out of the sea
[1:02:18] and the second is the beast coming up
[1:02:19] out of the earth
[1:02:21] the latter is the united states
[1:02:24] you've already learned the beast out of
[1:02:26] the sea is the spirit of ancient rome
[1:02:28] empowered by the same demonic forces
[1:02:30] that exercise worldwide dominion in the
[1:02:32] kingdoms of the babylonians medes and
[1:02:34] persians and ancient grecians
[1:02:37] ancient rome received a deadly wound
[1:02:39] when the roman empire fell but was
[1:02:41] healed when it gained spiritual
[1:02:42] authority through constantine in the
[1:02:44] roman catholic church
[1:02:47] the second beast in revelation 13 verses
[1:02:49] 11 through 18 is called the beast coming
[1:02:52] up out of the earth who exercises all
[1:02:55] the power of the first beast or beast
[1:02:57] out of the sea
[1:02:58] the power of the roman spirit will be
[1:03:00] exercised by the second beast or united
[1:03:02] states
[1:03:03] compare briefly the similarities between
[1:03:05] ancient rome and the united states's
[1:03:07] world dominance
[1:03:09] largest economies
[1:03:11] strongest militaries
[1:03:13] most influential politics
[1:03:15] most advanced technologies
[1:03:17] freedom and variety and cultural
[1:03:19] expressions
[1:03:20] and religious tolerance
[1:03:23] examining the five symbols of the second
[1:03:25] beast will prove it is indeed the spirit
[1:03:27] of rome in the united states
[1:03:29] first the second beast rides out of the
[1:03:32] earth and not the sea like the first
[1:03:34] beast
[1:03:35] since the sea or waters represent
[1:03:37] multitudes of people earth represents a
[1:03:40] place with a smaller human population
[1:03:42] north america
[1:03:44] second this beast has two horns which
[1:03:47] symbolize america's civil and
[1:03:49] ecclesiastical powers
[1:03:51] horns represent power in scripture as
[1:03:54] jeremiah 48 details moab's fall from
[1:03:56] great military power
[1:03:58] as the lord prophesies her horn would be
[1:04:00] cut off
[1:04:01] third it is like a lamb a young country
[1:04:04] just as a lamb as a young sheep
[1:04:06] but it does not have to be a lamp since
[1:04:08] scripture says like a lamb
[1:04:10] it is the american buffalo selected as
[1:04:12] the national mammal of the united states
[1:04:15] in 2016.
[1:04:17] fourth america speaks as a dragon
[1:04:20] meaning it makes phenomenal claims and
[1:04:21] warnings in front of the united nations
[1:04:24] in september 2018 president donald trump
[1:04:27] boasted america's military will soon be
[1:04:29] more powerful than it ever has been
[1:04:31] before
[1:04:32] for decades presidents have often issued
[1:04:34] warnings to rogue regimes such as the
[1:04:37] soviet union iran saudi arabia and north
[1:04:40] korea
[1:04:41] finally revelation 13 verse 13 says the
[1:04:44] united states does great wonders that he
[1:04:46] maketh fire come down from heaven on
[1:04:48] earth in the sight of men
[1:04:50] this prophecy was fulfilled in august
[1:04:52] 1945
[1:04:54] when america dropped atomic bombs on
[1:04:56] hiroshima and nagasaki in an attempt to
[1:04:59] spare american lives and end world war
[1:05:01] ii
[1:05:03] history and scripture detail the spirit
[1:05:05] of rome rising in the united states
[1:05:08] colonial america began as a protestant
[1:05:10] movement to pursue religious freedom
[1:05:12] and a more abundant life
[1:05:15] indeed the pilgrim fathers part of the
[1:05:17] separatist movement that rejected the
[1:05:19] church of england's roman catholic-like
[1:05:22] governmental institutionalism
[1:05:24] came to north america to escape the
[1:05:26] church of england's religious
[1:05:28] persecution and founded plymouth
[1:05:30] massachusetts in 1620.
[1:05:34] for early americans catholicism though
[1:05:36] tolerated was their religious enemy and
[1:05:38] remained so for nearly 300 years
[1:05:41] even during john f kennedy's 1960
[1:05:44] presidential campaign he had to overcome
[1:05:46] a widespread conviction that no roman
[1:05:49] catholic candidate could be elected
[1:05:50] president
[1:05:51] narrowly winning the presidency
[1:05:53] kennedy rose above the religious taboo
[1:05:55] against roman catholics through his
[1:05:57] style glamour and wit pledging his
[1:06:00] belief of the separation of church and
[1:06:02] state to protestant ministers during a
[1:06:04] televised speech in houston texas
[1:06:08] the book of daniel reveals how
[1:06:09] catholicism slowly but effectively
[1:06:12] gained acceptance and prominence in the
[1:06:14] once protestant strong america
[1:06:17] daniel 2 verses 40 through 43 describes
[1:06:20] the fourth kingdom or roman spirit which
[1:06:22] began as the ancient roman empire but
[1:06:25] was given a new life and appearance in
[1:06:27] the roman catholic church
[1:06:28] daniel says the roman spirit breaks and
[1:06:30] subdues all things like iron but its
[1:06:33] feet and toes are part iron and clay
[1:06:36] making the end of the roman rule partly
[1:06:38] strong and partly broken
[1:06:41] if iron is catholicism then clay is
[1:06:43] protestantism
[1:06:45] and daniel says they never truly mix
[1:06:47] with one another
[1:06:48] but daniel 2 verse 43 says the mixed
[1:06:51] iron and clay in the image's feet
[1:06:53] represents the two substances mingling
[1:06:56] themselves with the seed of men
[1:06:58] the devil's plan has been to control
[1:07:00] both catholic and protestant churches
[1:07:02] pitting each against the other in a
[1:07:04] proselytizing battle
[1:07:07] unconverted catholics and protestants
[1:07:08] have been mingling themselves with the
[1:07:10] seed of men or marrying other
[1:07:12] unconverted people spreading their
[1:07:14] corrupt religion by way of family
[1:07:16] tradition rather than by true spiritual
[1:07:18] experience
[1:07:20] today's unconverted catholics and
[1:07:21] protestants are the modern pharisees
[1:07:24] as jesus says in matthew 15 they draw
[1:07:27] nigh to god with their mouths and honor
[1:07:29] him with their lips but their hearts are
[1:07:31] far from god truly they worship god in
[1:07:34] vain teaching for doctrine the
[1:07:36] commandments of men
[1:07:39] catholicism gradually became accepted in
[1:07:41] the united states through mixed
[1:07:43] marriages of separate beliefs in which
[1:07:45] one spouse was catholic and the other
[1:07:47] was not
[1:07:48] generation after generation of catholics
[1:07:50] took marriage vows according to the
[1:07:52] catholic code of canon law promising to
[1:07:55] remove dangers of defecting from the
[1:07:57] faith while promising to do all in his
[1:08:00] or her power so that all offspring are
[1:08:02] baptized and brought up in the catholic
[1:08:04] church
[1:08:05] herein was fulfilled daniel's vision of
[1:08:07] the iron kingdom rome
[1:08:09] mingling with the seed of men and
[1:08:11] pledging to make all offspring roman
[1:08:13] catholic
[1:08:14] mystery babylon has slowly conquered the
[1:08:16] world through mixed marriages and
[1:08:18] unbelieving children who propagate their
[1:08:20] tradition-based dogma centered man
[1:08:23] inspired and dead religion to succeeding
[1:08:26] generations
[1:08:28] mixing unbelief among believers has
[1:08:30] always been satan's most effective
[1:08:32] tactic
[1:08:33] the devil knows he can most easily
[1:08:35] corrupt people's spiritual lives by
[1:08:37] polluting their daily actions and habits
[1:08:39] in their homes
[1:08:40] satan delights in destroying families in
[1:08:43] the garden of eden he divided and
[1:08:44] conquered the first family adam and eve
[1:08:47] by beguiling eve with his lies and
[1:08:49] misinterpretation of god's word in
[1:08:51] genesis 6 verses 1 through 3 god was
[1:08:54] grieved when the sons of god or godly
[1:08:56] lineage of seth married the worldly
[1:08:58] daughters of men or unbelieving women of
[1:09:01] cain's lineage solely based upon their
[1:09:03] beauty instead of their religious
[1:09:05] convictions
[1:09:06] marrying outside the faith caused
[1:09:08] spiritual degradation in solomon's reign
[1:09:11] and in the lives of disobedient jews in
[1:09:13] the days of ezra nehemiah the apostle
[1:09:16] paul warns christians are not to be
[1:09:18] unequally yoked or have intimate
[1:09:20] fellowship with unbelievers
[1:09:22] and details how corrupt teachers aim to
[1:09:24] infiltrate homes of spiritually weak
[1:09:27] people in order to lead them astray
[1:09:29] john agrees warning christians to refuse
[1:09:32] false teachers access to their house or
[1:09:34] from asking god's blessing upon their
[1:09:36] works
[1:09:39] the rewards for receiving the revelation
[1:09:41] of mystery babylon
[1:09:43] all those who receive the revelation of
[1:09:44] mystery babylon are first able to
[1:09:47] recognize the mother of false religion
[1:09:49] and escape her blasphemies abominations
[1:09:52] idolatries and spiritualism
[1:09:54] by rejecting mystery babylon true
[1:09:56] christians gain the reward of
[1:09:58] recognizing the true church the body of
[1:10:00] christ and see themselves as members in
[1:10:02] particular of this body
[1:10:05] perhaps the greatest reward is
[1:10:07] understanding who your true mother is
[1:10:09] the new jerusalem
[1:10:10] this glorious truth is found in
[1:10:12] galatians 4 verse 26
[1:10:14] which states that the new jerusalem or
[1:10:16] the jerusalem which is above is the
[1:10:18] mother of us all
[1:10:19] in the greek mother means motherland
[1:10:22] so which is your native country rome or
[1:10:24] heaven
[1:10:25] is mystery babylon your mother or the
[1:10:27] new jerusalem
[1:10:29] as a genuine believer in jesus christ
[1:10:31] heaven is your home for ephesians 1
[1:10:33] verse 4 says you were chosen in him
[1:10:36] before the foundation of the world
[1:10:38] you literally came from heaven because
[1:10:40] you came from god's mind heaven has
[1:10:42] always been your motherland
[1:10:46] in john 14 verses 1 through 3 jesus
[1:10:49] promised you when he left this earth he
[1:10:51] was going to prepare a place for you so
[1:10:53] you could be with him forever
[1:10:55] jesus is just about finished preparing
[1:10:57] the new jerusalem for you and the entire
[1:10:59] body of christ
[1:11:00] paul says you are seeking those things
[1:11:02] which are above and have set your
[1:11:04] affection on things above your
[1:11:06] motherland
[1:11:07] when you die or at the body change of
[1:11:09] the rapture you will return to your
[1:11:11] mother heaven the new jerusalem your
[1:11:13] future dwelling place with christ your
[1:11:15] husband is your motherland
[1:11:19] the final rewards are the current
[1:11:20] spiritual benefits you receive after
[1:11:22] accepting god's wisdom about the false
[1:11:24] church mystery babylon
[1:11:27] this chapter began with god's truths
[1:11:28] about wisdom being necessary for
[1:11:31] recognizing mystery babylon and because
[1:11:33] you prayed and asked god for wisdom the
[1:11:35] benefits are seven fold
[1:11:37] james 3 verses 17 and 18 declares all
[1:11:39] seven saying but the wisdom that is from
[1:11:42] above is first pure then peaceable
[1:11:44] gentle and easy to be entreated full of
[1:11:47] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[1:11:51] without hypocrisy and the fruit of
[1:11:53] righteousness is sown in peace of them
[1:11:55] that make peace
[1:11:56] through god's wisdom your character is
[1:11:58] pure peaceable gentle compliant merciful
[1:12:02] fruitful impartial and sincere
[1:12:07] the consequences for rejecting the
[1:12:09] revelation of mystery babylon
[1:12:12] rejecting the revelation of mystery
[1:12:13] babylon as the catholic church justifies
[1:12:16] the mother harlot
[1:12:17] proverbs 17 verse 15 reads he that
[1:12:20] justified the wicked and he that
[1:12:21] condemneth the just even they both are
[1:12:24] abomination to the lord
[1:12:26] catholicism's blasphemies abominations
[1:12:29] idolatries and spiritualism cannot be
[1:12:31] forgiven because she will not repent
[1:12:34] heaven will not forget her sins
[1:12:36] revelation 18 verse 5 states for her
[1:12:38] sins have reached into heaven and god
[1:12:40] hath remembered her iniquities
[1:12:42] the next chapter exposes her iniquity
[1:12:44] loving characteristics
[1:12:46] by not speaking against and leaving the
[1:12:48] mother harlot and her daughters
[1:12:50] rejecters of this revelation will be
[1:12:52] guilty of partaking in her sins
[1:12:55] while babylon followers are alive they
[1:12:57] will suffer the consequences of
[1:12:59] remaining in the mother harlot
[1:13:01] antichrist system
[1:13:02] members may be able to attend their
[1:13:04] spiritually dead churches but they will
[1:13:06] be unable to escape demonic influences
[1:13:09] being tormented by the multitudes of
[1:13:11] unclean spirits present in their
[1:13:13] gatherings
[1:13:14] revelation 18 verse 2 declares that
[1:13:16] catholicism the mother church with
[1:13:18] daughter churches is a habitation of
[1:13:21] devils and the hold of every foul spirit
[1:13:23] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:13:26] bird
[1:13:28] the fatal final future consequences of
[1:13:30] rejecting this revelation include taking
[1:13:32] the mark of the beast in your forehead
[1:13:34] or right hand
[1:13:35] bowing to his name or accepting the
[1:13:37] number of his name
[1:13:39] all those who take the mark of the beast
[1:13:40] will be cast alive into a lake of fire
[1:13:42] burning with brimstone according to
[1:13:44] revelation 19 verse 20 this tragic
[1:13:47] conclusion of rejecting this revelation
[1:13:50] will be separation from the one true god
[1:13:52] being judged in the lake of fire
[1:13:55] conclusion
[1:13:57] our gracious and loving god freely
[1:13:59] offers his wisdom to all mankind that
[1:14:01] they might recognize both the true and
[1:14:03] false church
[1:14:04] the book of revelation provides a clear
[1:14:06] view of these two churches the pure
[1:14:09] blood washed wife of jesus christ versus
[1:14:12] the vile seductive named mystery
[1:14:14] babylon the great the mother of harlots
[1:14:17] and abominations of the earth
[1:14:19] all evidence suggests the catholic
[1:14:21] church is mystery babylon the 11
[1:14:23] scriptural proofs the mark of the beast
[1:14:26] the name and number of the beast the
[1:14:28] false prophet pope
[1:14:29] thus saith the lord from the prophet
[1:14:31] william branham and the rise of
[1:14:33] catholicism in the united states
[1:14:36] revelation 18 verses 4 and 5 says the
[1:14:39] holy spirit is issuing a final call to
[1:14:41] god's people saying
[1:14:43] come out of her mystery babylon
[1:14:46] my people that you be not partakers of
[1:14:48] her sins and that you receive not of her
[1:14:50] plagues for her sins have reached unto
[1:14:52] heaven and god hath remembered her
[1:14:54] iniquities if you're a catholic and one
[1:14:57] of god's people please come out of
[1:14:58] catholicism and into the true church of
[1:15:01] jesus christ
[1:15:02] if you're trapped in a dead protestant
[1:15:04] church a daughter church of the mother
[1:15:06] church come out and let the holy ghost
[1:15:08] lead you to jesus church
[1:15:12] the choice is up to you as to which
[1:15:14] church you want to be a part of but
[1:15:15] jesus church cannot be joined for christ
[1:15:18] says you must be born into it ye must be
[1:15:21] born again
[1:15:22] unconverted catholic and protestant
[1:15:24] churches can be joined with membership
[1:15:26] classes vows and first communions but
[1:15:28] the true church is buried by baptism in
[1:15:31] the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:15:33] born again of his holy ghost
[1:15:37] action steps to come out of babylon
[1:15:40] step one
[1:15:41] if you're a roman catholic or member of
[1:15:44] a denomination or non-denominational
[1:15:46] church holding catholic dogma i.e the
[1:15:49] trinity
[1:15:50] respectfully and graciously leave your
