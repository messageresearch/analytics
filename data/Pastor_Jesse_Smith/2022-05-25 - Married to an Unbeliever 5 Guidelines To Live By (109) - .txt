TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the name above all names the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question how does a holy woman live when her husband is in sin lord willing i'll do my best by the scriptures and the leading of the holy ghost to give answers for both a holy woman who's married to a sinful man and a holy man who's married to a sinful woman first matthew 6 verse 33 tells everyone married or single to seek jesus's righteousness first make it your first desire to seek jesus righteousness daily confessing your sins and dying to all selfish desires as paul said i die daily in first corinthians 15 31 the earlier in the day you read your bible pray and die to your selfishness and seek to express jesus's righteousness in your life or in other words obedience to every word of god the more victory you'll see in your life and in your family the lord willing this is according to matthew 6 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of god in his righteousness and all these things should be added unto you and first corinthians 15 31 says i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily by putting jesus first you will ensure you love christ jesus more than anything or anyone else as commanded by christ in matthew 10 verses 36-38 which says and a man's foes shall be they of his own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and fouleth after me is not worthy of me so jesus says following him will be like taking up a cross which is a slow death to self a slow death to selfishness and the fact that you take up this cross shows that you love jesus more than anything else based upon matthew chapter 10 verse 37 i want to share a few quotes from god's prophet brother branham that go along with this first guideline for believing spouses to seek jesus's righteousness first and always obey god's word first in this first quote from questions and answers part 4 1964 brother ram tells a believing wife who's being persecuted by her unbelieving husband that she does not have to stop reading her bible and that her husband cannot refuse her to read her bible or go to church and then brother adam quotes matthew 10 verse 37 let's listen to the quote brother branham the bible tells us that a wife should obey her husband i am a christian and my husband is a sinner he uh persecutes me in every way that he can and for me not to go to church and read my bible and and denies the word what should i do what should you do now listen you're supposed to obey your husband that's the word now if he tells you and refuses you to read the bible go to church or something like that you don't have to obey that because he that won't forsake his father mother husband wife whatever it is and follow me is not worthy of mine is that right no don't the man i suppose you're not a man's not supposed to use that authority over a woman just because he's her ruler god is her ruler above you brother see and if your wife is doing something wrong then don't uh now you can got a right to tell her she's supposed to listen to you but you ain't got no right to beat her or drag her around or do those things she god made man a helpmate not a doormat remember she she was your sweetheart she should always be that here's another quote from questions and answers part 2 1964 where brother branham again tells a believing christian woman who has a sinner husband that she does not have to obey his commands for her to cut her hair wear shorts or go to ungodly places the believing wife doesn't have to be subject to these sinful suggestions or sinful commands from her sinful husband brother braham says you're not bound to that in other words you're not bound to disobey the word of god and he tells the woman you might have to separate from everything for god notice brother braham said that the woman must seek first the kingdom of god in his righteousness quoting matthew chapter 6 33 showing again that a believing spouse must honor god first and obey every word of god that she or he possibly can and try to live at peace with their unbelieving spouse if at all possible let's listen to the quote also brother branham i believe a woman should be subject to her husband but if a christian woman has a center husband who does not even to one of your services come to one of your services and won't and wants his wife to be doing things cutting her hair wearing shorts and going to ungodly places is this woman supposed to be subject to this man in this way please explain this more clearly as this is a question that is asked often no sister you are not subject to such a person no indeed for this cause you'll leave everything and cleave to god now the thing if you want that man wants to live with you and you be stay a christian but if he's going to make you wear shorts cut your hair and do all these other things in ungodly places you seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness you're not bound to such a person as that but as long the bible says as she is pleased and he is pleased to dwell together you remember that let them and now these i didn't put the scriptures out because i just picked them up you see a few minutes ago i pick up one now and then that i haven't got time but paul said that as long as they unbelieving husband has unbelieving or believing wife or so forth let the believing wife remain with the believing husband as long as it's not contrary now to god if he's pleased to dwell with her go ahead honey if you want to go to church that's all right but i ain't going i don't believe in it don't have nothing to do with it but you go ahead that's art but when he says you can't do it there's a different thing you're not bound to that then you separate everything for god second you should stay in your calling if god called you to serve him and you were married to a sinner remain married to the sinner as commanded by saint paul in first corinthians 7 verses 10 and 11 17 and 20-24 verse 11 says and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife note that a couple according to paul can separate due to one being a christian and the other not being a christian but they cannot marry again because they are bound by their vow until death verse 17 says but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called everyone so let him walk and so ordain i in all churches verses 20 through 24 says let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called art thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather for if he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lord's free man likewise also he that is called being free is christ's servant ye are bought with the price be not ye the servants of men brethren let every man wherein he is called abide therein abide with god remember friends as i mentioned in my previous video husbands love your wives as christ loved the church domestic abuse is never acceptable no one is obligated to take domestic abuse as the abuser is demon-possessed if abuse is happening know that god does not want you to be abused and you should seek physical and spiritual safety you should contact the local authorities as you're led by the holy ghost but as long as you can live together in peace then the bible tells us to remain in our calling third the reason you stay in your calling being married to a lost spouse is because your holy life will sanctify their unholy lives as paul wrote in first corinthians 7 verses 12-16 but to the rest speak i not the lord if any man hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away and if the woman which hath and the husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy notice paul says the influence of one believing spouse upon the children will make their lives holy in other words the godly parent will train the children according to christian moral standards and they will learn to know the ways of the lord as a child verse 15 says but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases but god hath called us to peace again this shows how christians can be separated from an unbelieving spouse in a marriage but this scripture does not give permission for a christian partner to marry anyone else while their first spouse is still living remember all christians are bound by their marriage vows until death here's a quote from god's prophet brother branham from 1962 questions and answers brother branham specifically quotes first corinthians 7 verse 15 about letting an unbelieving spouse depart but twice notice brother branham says but you can't remarry and not that you can remarry again again brother ram always taught believers were bound to their marriage vows until death and they could not remarry again if they had a living spouse because that would cause both to be adulterers let's listen to the the quote depart let him depart now if the unbeliever says i'm not going to live with you any longer you become a christian until a man tells his wife because you got saved go to get out of the world where was once then i'm going to leave you all ain't nothing you do about it let him depart see or the woman say to her husband i'm not going to mix up with that bunch of holy rollers i'm not going to do this i'll separate and leave you don't you leave the church you let her leave a brother our sister is not under bondage in such case that is if your companion is putting you away and wants to depart for it you don't have to just hold on to them if they want to leave you and they are going to leave you for the cause of christ let them leave but you can't remarry but god has called us unto peace now not that you can remarry again he's already stated that but you don't have to live with an unbelieving husband or an unbelieving wife if they are not willing if they're willing say now you go on to church if you want to go down there that's your business you want to go to your church you go ahead for me i don't believe it and i i'll do anything for you i'll not send in your way you go ahead then you just remain there knowing not that your sanctified life will sanctify that believer calls endlessly see either side man or woman you but now just to say i brother branham i got married my wife's unbeliever and here's the sister over here i can marry i'm gonna leave this and marry that one oh no no indeed your about is until death you separate and there's nothing else in the world will permit you to marry in the bible until your companion is dead that's right there are only grounds there's no remarrying nowhere at all except a dead companion that's all see you can't make it contradict itself verse 16 says for what knoweth thou o life whether thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife so see friends you don't know whether or not god will save your unbelieving spouse so paul's godly wisdom told us to abide in our marriages and to trust that our sanctified life will speak to the unbelieving spouse and hopefully cause them to repent and become christians as well there's two scriptures that give us insight on how this sanctification takes place in first timothy five verse fourteen and titus two verses four and five in first timothy five four paul said i will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully notice paul said the wife can guide the home and guide means manage family affairs so the believing wife is not the boss of the home but she manages the home such as she manages the food preparation sometimes education the discipline of the children the training of the children and so much more in other words she has a lot of influence upon the home her every action can glorify jesus christ and that christian character will be seen by her unbelieving husband and her children titus 2 verses 4 and 5 say that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed so a christian wife has a huge responsibility even if her husband isn't saved to love her husband and her children to be discreet which in the greek means to have a sound mind to be sane self-control temperate to curb one's desires and impulses she's to be chased which in the greek means free from carnality modest and reverent and she's to keep the home which means care for the house work at the home take care of household affairs and of course obedient to her husband that the word of god be not blasphemed or in other words that she doesn't bring reproach upon the word of god and the lord jesus christ because the spirit of jesus christ teaches a godly woman to love her husband obey her husband and love her children in this next quote from questions and answers part 1 1964 brother ram tells a believing wife that her life will sanctify her husband who doesn't believe the message brother branham encourages her to go with her husband to his denominational church but don't partake in any sinful things that that church would partake in and then brother brahm told her the way she'd win her husband was by being real salty and he quotes the scripture the sanctified wife sanctifies the husband let's listen to the quote brother branham i have ex accepted god's message of today and also our son and we both have been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ my husband my husband hasn't accepted the message and is fighting this message and he has influenced our son and is taking him to a methodist church he wants me to go with him to church when we are not in service here at the tabernacle would it be right for me to go with him or would it be better to stay out of that denomination well now dear sister you should ever sign no name but perhaps you're listening to your question don't you hear it on tape go with your husband but don't be partakers of what they're doing see you're supposed to love your husband and love is what doesn't you just be real salty he'll get thirsty don't join their denomination he said stay away from that denomination don't join it go to it if you can't get a whole loaf get a half can't get a life let's get a slice see but uh that's where you'll win your husband by doing that don't be irritant then he'll know he's got this as much as you have see but when you show something that you have that he don't have that'll make him thirst to be like you the sanctified wife sanctifies the husband that was just an advice so i i could spend a long time on that but fourth the faithful holy ghost-filled wife has to lead by a quiet example without using aggressive words meaning she lives a godly life without ruling over a husband according to first peter 3 verses 1-7 likewise your wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear notice peter said the wife wins the husband without the word so her actions are to speak louder than her words notice she's not to preach at her husband with aggressive words but she's to let her life speak she's let her testimony speak and that testimony will speak louder than any word she could say and verses three and four says her adorning should be that hidden man of the heart a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god a great price and then peter in verses 5 and 6 says this is how the holy women also in the old testament who trusted in god adorned themselves they were in subjection unto their own husbands notice peter also said the saved wife must be in subjection to the husband and paul said the same paul said the wives to be in subjection in everything in ephesians 5 verse 24 and of course that means she's only in subjection as he gives her requests that obey the bible a godly woman is not required to disobey the scripture or disobey jesus christ because she loves jesus christ more than anything else as we saw earlier in matthew chapter 10. but getting back to peter notice first peter 3 verse 7 for the husbands it says likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so christian husbands with wives that don't believe they should still give honor to their wife trusting that hopefully one day she will be saved and then they'll have rewards together as the bible says heirs together of the grace of life and then that man can expect god to answer his prayers as well because he's treating his wife the right way and husbands remember malachi 2 verses 14-16 god told the men of israel to take heed to their spirits that they don't deal treacherously with their wives because god was a witness between the husbands and wives god sees how husbands treat their wives and how they either use the authority well that god's given them or they abuse their authority god sees all the interactions in the home and the holy ghost will guide a man to love his wife as christ loved the church lastly the saved or believing spouse must fear god and also do good to his or her unbelieving spouse all the days of his or her life as taught in proverbs 31 verse 12 and verses 28 through 30 and ephesians 5 verses 25 and 26 proverbs 31 12 says she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life verse 28 says her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her verse 30 says favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised and for the husbands ephesians 5 verses 25 and 26 say husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word two more helpful quotes from brother branham before closing i want to add a couple more quotes from brother branham that i believe will help message believers who might be married to an unbelieving spouse in this first quote from questions and answers part 1 1964 brother ram talks about a man who's a believer but his wife has divorced him and is suing him this would be an incredibly sad situation but brother ram tells him commit the situation to god and recognize that satan's only trying to tear him up satan wanted to break his health down brother ram told him to be just as happy as he could be and pray to god and say god i love her and commit the whole thing to you lord i want them saved but i can't go no further then commit it to the lord and just let it alone and god will take care of the rest of it lets us into the quote dear brother branham my wife and i were separated she is suing me for a divorce she is not a christian and i believe the message and want her to be saved that nice that's real christian spirit and believe what must i do we also have two boys sign their name brother look let me tell you she's going to sue you for a divorce that's satan you shouldn't do that but if you're a christian and done nothing in the world to enter that woman then it's satan doing that he's only trying to tear you up now if she is one of god's elected she will come to him if she's not she's not worth worrying about then if it does if you worry it'll break your health down and that's what satan wants to do he's working i know at you so you just commit the whole thing to god and go right on serving god just as happy as you can be god will take care of the rest of all that the father has given me will come to me get down on your knees i'll pray with you or anything i'll pray over the matter just say lord god i love her she's a mother of my children if she is and say i i just commit the whole thing to you lord i want to save you know i do but i can't go no further she's going to divorce me anyhow i haven't done nothing if i have revealed it to me i'll go make it right i'll do anything then commit it to the lord and just let it alone then just let it alone for i don't live in the same as as nothing ever happened god will take care of the rest of it in the next quote again from questions and answers part 1 1964 there was a married man who believed the message but his wife and son did not rejoice in the word the man was struggling to claim his family and asked brother brandon what is my course sir brother ram said commit them to the lord and know that all that the father has given me will come to me speaking of jesus brother branham said just show by the sweetness of your life and your consideration for others that you have the real genuine love of jesus christ and he said if you don't have it pray until it comes to you because it had to be real he says pray to the place till your life is full of salt of the savior lifting up jesus christ then he said if you do go to the denominations be careful don't don't join their church let's listen to the quote brother branham i believe the message you teach with all my heart it thrills my soul however my wife and son do not rejoice in the word they do not desire to separate themselves from some other worldly habits you said that we should claim our claim our families i find that difficult to do seeming that they do not live for the word or in the word what is my course sir do i claim them and believe or do i pray father thy will be done and be content in the state i find myself in i would appreciate your guidance brother branham god bless you my brother or sister whoever you may be i i would just commit them to the lord i see because what all the father has given me will come to me amen now the only thing for you people to do now i'm mother when my sister if your husband wants you going out to methodist church you go ahead you might not have a whole loaf of bread but if they even say they believe that jesus christ is the son of god you believe that because we do too now to go off on other tantrums and things just let them go ahead but you eat that much of the bread see and in that you just show by the sweetness of your life your consideration for others if you haven't got it sister dear pray till it comes to you that you won't have to put on anything artificially because when you do that it's not real your husband can tell that but you when you really have prayed to a place that your life is full of salt of the savior he'll make the contact if i be lifted up i'll draw all man i'd go be real careful don't join the churchill please don't do that don't you join the church but go on in closing i hope this short video has been a blessing friends i felt burdened on my heart to work on this video and get it out as soon as i could so please share it with anyone you know who is a christian but they're married to a person who's not a believer and please pray for them friends the most powerful weapon god has ever given us was prayer the scripture says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and remember friends there's no greater miracle than seeing a soul saved so if you're a christian you have a spouse that's not saved keep them in prayer keep living a sanctified life before them and hope and trust that by the grace of god your unsafe spouse will become a believer by the grace of god on a personal note i have seen this happen in one family that i've known the wife was a believer and she trained the children up in the ways of the lord and eventually over the course of 10 or 20 years the husband eventually became a christian now the wife and the children were in the message of the hour and the husband never became a message follower but he lived a christian life before he passed away so the family rejoiced that he was saved and also they can look forward to seeing him in heaven someday because all those who call upon the lord with a pure heart will be saved remember friends with god all things are possible if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
