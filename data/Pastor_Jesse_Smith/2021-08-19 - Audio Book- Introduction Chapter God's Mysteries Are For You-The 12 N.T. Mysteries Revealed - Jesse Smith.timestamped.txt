[0:17] introduction god's mysteries are for you
[0:21] the introduction contains footnotes
[0:23] numbers 1
[0:25] through 120. he answered and said unto
[0:29] them because it is given unto you
[0:31] to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[0:33] heaven but to them
[0:35] it is not given matthew 13
[0:38] verse 11
[0:41] it is at such a time as this the time of
[0:44] the end
[0:45] at the height of satan's greatest
[0:47] deception in which he is trapping all
[0:49] nations
[0:50] in a modern sodom and gomorrah state
[0:53] with the same
[0:54] days of noah conditions of gluttony and
[0:57] drunkenness
[0:58] that jesus christ the true and faithful
[1:01] witness
[1:02] has kept his promise to loose the
[1:04] mysterious seals on his bible
[1:06] and is revealing his secrets therein to
[1:09] you
[1:10] his dearly beloved god's eternal secrets
[1:13] are now at your fingertips
[1:15] his revelations were not originally sent
[1:18] to me
[1:19] i've only compiled them the new
[1:21] testament literally labels 12
[1:23] individual doctrines as mysteries and if
[1:26] god is eternal
[1:27] as he claims then these doctrines are
[1:30] his
[1:30] eternal secrets the premise of this book
[1:33] is to make you aware of god's mysteries
[1:35] he wants you to understand share and
[1:39] live by before his second coming
[1:42] perhaps the thought of god having
[1:44] secrets you haven't known
[1:45] up to this point in your life makes you
[1:48] nervous or uneasy
[1:50] no one likes to feel like they do not
[1:51] know enough but don't fret
[1:54] i want to encourage you that god has
[1:56] chosen this time of your life
[1:57] to reveal his mysteries to you solomon
[2:01] says
[2:01] our omniscient god has a time and season
[2:04] for every purpose
[2:05] under heaven now is the season for you
[2:08] to allow
[2:09] god to reveal his mysteries to you
[2:12] as you read through this book the holy
[2:14] spirit will break down
[2:16] any misunderstandings you may have about
[2:18] his plan of redemption
[2:20] that he may build up your faith in the
[2:22] truth
[2:24] much biblical proof validates god's
[2:26] desire to reveal deeper
[2:28] more intimate knowledge about himself to
[2:31] you
[2:34] a hide and seek romance drama
[2:37] the bible contains the ultimate love
[2:39] story you are probably aware of god's
[2:41] love
[2:42] as scripture says for god so loved the
[2:44] world
[2:45] that he gave his only begotten son but
[2:48] did you know that the father's love was
[2:49] so great for mankind
[2:51] that he planned for his son the lamb to
[2:54] be slain for you
[2:56] before the foundation of the world along
[2:58] with pre-planning your salvation through
[3:00] the death of christ
[3:02] god also chose you in him before the
[3:05] foundation of the world
[3:07] after choosing you he predestinated the
[3:09] events of your life
[3:10] so he would be close to you and that you
[3:13] could seek after him
[3:14] and find him god set up your life like a
[3:18] hide and seek romance drama a clear
[3:21] allegory of this divine romance is that
[3:24] of the husband and wife
[3:26] jesus is the heavenly bridegroom and
[3:28] christians are his earthly bride
[3:31] chapter 4 covers this great mystery in
[3:33] full detail
[3:35] jesus teaches that god's primary role is
[3:38] seeker in this romance saying ye have
[3:41] not chosen me
[3:42] but i have chosen you paul says there is
[3:46] none that seeketh after god
[3:49] ultimately it is god who seeks and gives
[3:52] every good and perfect gift
[3:53] even our faith no man can boast for
[3:56] working to gain the salvation of the
[3:58] lord
[3:59] god loves to be on the seeker side of
[4:01] the drama
[4:03] jesus says that god searches after souls
[4:05] who will worship him
[4:06] in spirit and truth in his own words
[4:09] christ said he came to seek and save
[4:12] that which was lost our lord also stated
[4:15] his desire
[4:16] to hover over jerusalem as a hand her
[4:19] brood
[4:20] but they turned him down god lovingly
[4:23] sought men's souls in the days of noah
[4:25] but found only one in the earth that
[4:28] walked with him
[4:29] noah in a minor way god allows us to
[4:33] feel a need for him
[4:35] causing us to seek him remember the
[4:37] marriage allegory
[4:39] solomon's relationship with his wife in
[4:41] song of solomon
[4:43] portrays this drama well his wife is
[4:46] love sick and seeking solomon
[4:48] but does not immediately find him but
[4:50] once reunited
[4:52] marriage bliss ensues
[4:55] at times god hides himself because he
[4:57] loves to be sought after
[4:59] and feel our love isaiah says
[5:02] verily thou art a god that hides thyself
[5:05] o god of israel
[5:07] the savior after hiding god will then
[5:10] honor those who diligently search for
[5:12] his love
[5:13] proverbs says it is the glory of god to
[5:16] conceal a thing
[5:17] but the honor of kings is to search out
[5:20] a matter
[5:22] sometimes our creator will withhold
[5:24] answers to our prayer requests
[5:26] until we cry out to him in desperation
[5:29] solomon says if thou criest after
[5:32] knowledge
[5:33] and lift us up thy voice for
[5:35] understanding
[5:36] if thou seekest her as silver and
[5:39] searches for her as for head treasures
[5:41] then shalt thou understand the fear of
[5:43] the lord and find the knowledge of god
[5:46] god loves to hear our prayers and feel
[5:49] our need
[5:49] for him it's obvious god loves romantic
[5:53] suspense and fulfillment
[5:55] so he placed this enjoyment in our lives
[5:58] both
[5:58] naturally and spiritually how wonderful
[6:01] it is to be loved and sought after
[6:04] by the king eternal immortal invisible
[6:07] the only wise god perhaps this is why
[6:11] both children and adults
[6:12] enjoy fairy tales of heroic kings
[6:15] rescuing beautiful princesses
[6:17] the tales remind us that our heroic god
[6:20] has defeated all enemies to save us
[6:23] his spotless glorious beloved wife
[6:27] jesus's own words prove that your
[6:29] creator wants to share his heart
[6:31] and mysteries with you jesus is
[6:35] preaching on the mysteries
[6:37] imagine you lived two thousand years ago
[6:40] and were privileged to hear jesus christ
[6:41] preach the gospel
[6:43] you along with the multitudes of
[6:45] followers would probably hang on his
[6:48] every word because of his reputation as
[6:50] a healer
[6:52] picture how you would feel if jesus told
[6:53] the crowd he wanted to share god's
[6:55] secrets with them
[6:56] your heart would explode with excitement
[6:59] and anticipation
[7:00] as god's deep intentions feelings and
[7:03] motives would be shared with you
[7:05] but then to your surprise he told simple
[7:08] parables about
[7:09] everyday work planting seeds fishing
[7:12] and baking bread how could god's
[7:14] intimate mysteries
[7:16] be revealed in such simple everyday
[7:18] tasks
[7:20] yet this is exactly what happened when
[7:22] jesus preached
[7:23] and is recorded in three out of four
[7:25] gospels
[7:27] in the gospel of matthew account jesus
[7:29] taught specifically on seven mysteries
[7:32] related to the kingdom of heaven see
[7:34] chapter eight
[7:36] there's five reasons jesus preached
[7:38] about the mysteries of god based upon
[7:40] matthew 13
[7:42] verses 3 through 51 first
[7:45] god's mysteries were special knowledge
[7:47] for believers only
[7:49] jesus christ specifically stated this
[7:52] saying that unbelievers would not
[7:53] receive
[7:54] god's mysteries both jesus and paul
[7:57] declared that unbelievers loved the
[7:58] world more than god
[8:00] and thus would not desire the gospel
[8:03] recall this chapter's epigraph wherein
[8:06] jesus said it was given unto you to know
[8:08] the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
[8:10] but to them it is not given evidently
[8:14] god gives the understanding of his
[8:15] mysteries only to those who believe in
[8:18] him
[8:18] because only believers desire his
[8:21] knowledge
[8:22] the mysteries are not given to rejecters
[8:24] of the messiah
[8:26] scripture teaches that jesus would
[8:27] preach to multitudes
[8:29] but then would have private
[8:30] conversations with his disciples
[8:32] in order to confirm that they understood
[8:34] his messages
[8:37] second jesus taught the mysteries of god
[8:39] because he knew the knowledge would be
[8:41] valuable and precious to his followers
[8:44] everything about christ is precious to
[8:46] the christian
[8:47] as peter says unto you therefore which
[8:50] believe
[8:51] he is precious conversely
[8:54] god's knowledge is not precious to
[8:55] unbelievers
[8:57] in the discourse from the gospel of mark
[8:59] christ said his parables
[9:01] were just parables to unbelievers
[9:04] meaningless stories
[9:05] messiah said but unto them that are
[9:07] without all these things are done
[9:09] in parables to the unbeliever
[9:12] jesus's preaching was just mundane
[9:15] preaching
[9:16] it was not inspirational life-changing
[9:18] truth
[9:19] like it was to true christians
[9:22] third jesus preached about the mysteries
[9:24] in order to fulfill prophecy
[9:27] about himself one thousand years before
[9:30] christ
[9:31] the psalmist foretold the coming
[9:32] mysteries of god
[9:34] generation after generation were longing
[9:36] for this knowledge
[9:38] over the centuries millions of faithful
[9:40] jews were prayerfully anticipating
[9:42] these amazing revelations from god's own
[9:45] heart
[9:46] the gospel of matthew even recorded that
[9:49] jesus would
[9:50] utter things which have been kept secret
[9:52] from the foundation of the world
[9:54] so even before david in the psalms all
[9:57] the way back to adam and eve
[9:59] god had secrets he was saving to reveal
[10:01] when his only begotten son
[10:03] would roam the earth he created jesus
[10:06] said that many prophets and righteous
[10:08] men had desired to see and hear
[10:10] what the disciples had experienced but
[10:12] were not ordained for that earthly
[10:14] assignment
[10:16] fourth jesus preached the mysteries in
[10:19] parables
[10:20] to give everyone a fair chance at
[10:21] receiving eternal life
[10:24] scripture says god is not a respecter of
[10:26] persons
[10:27] and desires that all would be saved god
[10:30] freely offers salvation to all
[10:32] men in simplicity in fact jesus's
[10:35] parables were so simple
[10:36] that they required hearers to humble
[10:38] themselves
[10:39] and become like a child in order to
[10:42] accept them
[10:43] jesus rejoiced at the thought of god's
[10:45] parables
[10:46] being received by the humble but hidden
[10:49] from prideful
[10:50] self-proclaimed wise men of the world
[10:53] the prophet isaiah
[10:54] nearly 800 years before christ
[10:57] prophesied that even a fool would not
[10:59] err in the way of salvation
[11:01] due to its simplicity god has made
[11:03] salvation such a simple subject to
[11:06] understand
[11:06] while revealing his creative power to
[11:09] all men
[11:10] so that all men will be without excuse
[11:12] on the day of judgment
[11:15] lastly and most importantly god's
[11:18] mysteries contain the keys to receive
[11:20] eternal life jesus said those who
[11:23] received his mysteries
[11:24] would gain the following spiritual
[11:26] abilities see with their eyes
[11:29] hear with their ears and understand with
[11:32] their heart
[11:33] while being converted and healed
[11:36] but sadly in the same scripture jesus
[11:39] taught that most hearers would purposely
[11:40] close their own eyes
[11:42] in order to continue in sin and not see
[11:45] his truth
[11:46] their eyes they have closed those who
[11:49] reject the mysteries will remain
[11:51] unconverted sin sick with unforgiven
[11:54] sins your destiny hinges upon
[11:58] understanding and applying god's
[11:59] mysteries to your life
[12:03] jesus's friends know the mysteries
[12:06] jesus reveals his mysteries to only one
[12:09] group of people
[12:10] his friends obedience is the only
[12:13] requirement for friendship with jesus
[12:15] christ says ye are my friends if ye do
[12:18] whatsoever
[12:19] i command you doers of god's word
[12:22] are god's righteous friends as paul says
[12:25] obedience leads to righteousness
[12:28] know ye not that to whom ye yield
[12:30] yourselves servants to obey
[12:32] his servants ye are to whom ye obey
[12:36] whether of sin unto death or of
[12:38] obedience
[12:39] unto unrighteousness proverbs declares
[12:42] god's
[12:43] secret is with the righteous god's
[12:46] requirement for friendship
[12:47] is obedience based upon love in john
[12:50] chapter 14
[12:52] jesus repeatedly expresses that love
[12:54] motivates believers
[12:56] to obey god's commands saying
[12:59] if you love me keep my commands he that
[13:02] hath my commands and keepeth them
[13:04] he it is that loveth me and he that
[13:06] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[13:08] and i will love him and will manifest
[13:11] myself to him
[13:12] if a man love me he will keep my words
[13:15] and my father will love him
[13:17] and will come unto him and make our
[13:19] abode with him
[13:21] he that loveth me not keepeth not my
[13:23] sayings
[13:24] and the word which ye hear is not mine
[13:27] but the fathers which sent me
[13:30] undoubtedly you can be god's friend if
[13:32] you love him and keep his commands
[13:36] john called the believer's love for god
[13:39] the love of the father
[13:40] teaching that if any man loved the world
[13:43] the love of the father is not in him
[13:46] every human has the choice to either
[13:48] love the sinful things of the world
[13:50] or the holy things of god our father
[13:53] jesus had the love of the father to such
[13:55] a degree
[13:56] that he did only those things which
[13:58] pleased him
[14:00] as friends of jesus he gives us a status
[14:03] that is more personal than mere servants
[14:06] henceforth i call you not servants for
[14:08] the servant knoweth not
[14:10] what his lord doeth but i have called
[14:12] you friends
[14:13] for all things that i have heard of my
[14:15] father i have made known
[14:17] unto you jesus told his earthly
[14:20] disciples
[14:20] all that god showed him holding nothing
[14:23] back
[14:24] we have the same privilege today because
[14:25] jesus said the holy spirit
[14:27] would guide us into all truth and tell
[14:30] us things to come
[14:31] that we might be prepared for his return
[14:35] abraham is privileged to be called the
[14:36] friend of god
[14:38] three times in scripture because he
[14:40] believed god's promises
[14:42] genesis says god knew abraham would keep
[14:44] his commands
[14:45] and train his family to do so based upon
[14:48] abraham's faithfulness god revealed his
[14:51] plans
[14:51] to destroy sodom and gomorrah abraham
[14:55] the faithful friend of both god and man
[14:58] responded by interceding in prayer to
[15:00] god
[15:01] for his nephew lot whom god saved from
[15:03] destruction
[15:06] friends of god in our time will make
[15:08] themselves ready for the second coming
[15:10] of jesus christ
[15:11] paul says we will not live in sinful
[15:13] darkness being overtaken as a thief in
[15:16] the night
[15:16] when judgment is poured out upon the
[15:18] earth
[15:20] because we love the light of god's truth
[15:22] he has not appointed us unto wrath
[15:25] but to obtain salvation by our lord
[15:27] jesus christ
[15:30] mysteries are treasures god's mysteries
[15:34] are invaluable
[15:35] spiritual treasures that must be
[15:37] preached to god's people
[15:39] jesus says his words are truth spirit
[15:43] and life solomon says the value of god's
[15:46] wisdom is so great
[15:47] that nothing on earth could be compared
[15:49] to it
[15:50] you'll soon learn his mysteries are also
[15:52] bred
[15:54] jesus said god's mysteries were given to
[15:57] his apostles
[15:58] who would then preach those truths to
[16:00] all who would listen
[16:02] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[16:05] god's mysteries are meant to be shared
[16:07] and this job was so important
[16:09] that jesus prayed for his messengers and
[16:12] those that would believe on christ
[16:14] through their preaching neither pray i
[16:17] for these alone
[16:18] but for them also which shall believe on
[16:20] me through their word
[16:23] when his mysteries are preached both new
[16:25] and old treasures of truth
[16:27] will be brought forth when we attend
[16:30] preaching services
[16:31] we expect to be reminded of god's
[16:33] eternal truths
[16:34] but also hear new revelations to inspire
[16:37] our commitment to the gospel of jesus
[16:39] christ
[16:40] jesus promises that a spiritual hunger
[16:42] and thirst will be satisfied
[16:44] blessed are they which do hunger and
[16:46] thirst after righteousness
[16:48] for they should be filled to bring forth
[16:52] god's truth treasures
[16:54] ministers study and pray diligent
[16:56] studying and meditation upon the word of
[16:58] god
[16:59] allows preachers to rightly divide the
[17:01] words of truth
[17:03] jesus promises that praying in secret
[17:05] will produce an
[17:06] open public reward for those who
[17:09] practice it
[17:10] the greatest reward a minister could
[17:12] receive is that both
[17:13] he and his hearers would be saved by the
[17:16] life-giving treasures of god's word
[17:19] praying and meditating on the treasures
[17:21] of god was so critical
[17:22] that the early apostles created the
[17:24] deacon office
[17:25] to care for the physical needs of the
[17:28] people so that they could focus on the
[17:30] people's spiritual needs
[17:32] which could be met only through the
[17:33] preaching of god's word
[17:37] stewards of the mysteries god's
[17:40] mysteries are so valuable
[17:41] that paul said all ministers of the
[17:43] gospel were stewards of the mysteries of
[17:45] god
[17:46] the greek definition of steward is a
[17:49] manager or superintendent
[17:51] since i am employed as a public school
[17:53] teacher my mind cannot help but compare
[17:56] the job of a minister
[17:57] with a school district superintendent
[18:01] in both occupations the worker is a
[18:03] manager of someone else's resources
[18:06] and is accountable for his actions the
[18:08] minister handles god's word and people
[18:11] while the superintendent handles the
[18:13] community's facilities
[18:14] and its financial and human resources
[18:18] my school district's budget is
[18:19] approximately 50 million dollars
[18:22] can you imagine being responsible for a
[18:24] sum that large
[18:26] but in reality the gospel minister is
[18:28] responsible
[18:29] for much more than the superintendent
[18:32] because
[18:32] earthly riches eventually perish but
[18:35] eternal life with jesus christ
[18:37] is never ending the fruits of a faithful
[18:39] ministry
[18:40] will be believers who live eternally
[18:42] with jesus walking on streets
[18:45] paved with pure transparent gold
[18:49] paul says ministers are required to be
[18:51] faithful managers
[18:52] of the mysteries of god saying it is
[18:55] required
[18:56] in stewards that a man be found faithful
[18:59] ministers faithfully teach uphold and
[19:02] rightly divide the truth
[19:04] for jesus says the truth will set
[19:06] hearers free from sin
[19:08] the minister's spiritual labor makes him
[19:10] worthy of not
[19:11] honor but double honor preaching truth
[19:15] is such an honorable work
[19:16] that paul says faithful ministers keep
[19:18] believers souls from losing faith
[19:21] he compares preaching false doctrine to
[19:24] being cankered
[19:25] or having gained green a flesh-eating
[19:27] disease
[19:28] saying their word will eat as doth a
[19:31] canker
[19:31] and overthrow the faith of some
[19:34] false doctrine is an evil sin that
[19:37] slowly consumes a worshiper's sincerity
[19:40] causing him to give up his faith in
[19:42] christ
[19:43] the remedy is a god-sent preacher who
[19:45] will faithfully
[19:46] and uncompromisingly preach truth
[19:50] jesus uses the illustration of a
[19:52] household manager to represent a
[19:54] minister
[19:55] in luke chapter 12. he says a faithful
[19:58] and wise steward is blessed by god
[20:00] because he feeds his household their
[20:02] portion of meat
[20:03] in due season god's truths are spiritual
[20:06] meals
[20:07] full of life-giving vitamins david says
[20:10] about god's word
[20:11] oh taste and see that the lord is good
[20:14] and
[20:15] sweeter also than honey and the
[20:17] honeycomb
[20:18] jesus said his meat was to do the will
[20:21] of god
[20:22] or the word of god the church of jesus
[20:25] christ must be healthy
[20:26] growing in grace and knowledge of our
[20:28] lord and savior
[20:29] jesus christ being god steward is a huge
[20:33] responsibility
[20:34] and includes tests sometimes stewards
[20:37] become discouraged
[20:38] or suffer persecution because satan
[20:40] always attacks
[20:42] true stewards through false ones as the
[20:44] children of the flesh
[20:46] will always persecute the children of
[20:48] the spirit
[20:49] in paul's stewardship he experienced
[20:51] much persecution
[20:53] and often requested prayer that he would
[20:55] preach god's mysteries with boldness
[20:57] he said praying for me that utterance
[21:01] may be given
[21:02] unto me that i may open my mouth boldly
[21:05] to make known the mystery of the gospel
[21:07] for which i am an ambassador in bonds
[21:10] that therein i may speak boldly as i
[21:13] ought to speak
[21:15] stewards today like paul of old need our
[21:17] prayers that they may declare the
[21:19] mystery of god
[21:20] boldly the finished mystery of god
[21:25] the bible foretold a time would come
[21:28] when all the mysteries of god
[21:30] are finished or revealed revelation 10
[21:33] verse 7 says
[21:34] but in the days of the voice of the
[21:36] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[21:38] sound
[21:39] the mystery of god should be finished as
[21:41] he hath declared to his servants the
[21:43] prophets
[21:45] now is the time in which god promised to
[21:47] reveal all his mysteries
[21:49] before the second coming of jesus christ
[21:51] to the earth
[21:53] first revelation 10 verses 1 through 6
[21:56] show that jesus is the mighty angel
[21:58] descending to earth to sound forth the
[22:00] contents
[22:01] of the heavenly book that was previously
[22:04] sealed with seven seals
[22:06] two descriptions of this mighty angel
[22:09] match previous descriptions of christ
[22:11] from revelation chapter 1 a face as it
[22:14] were the sun
[22:16] and feet as pillars of fire this
[22:18] visitation to earth is not the physical
[22:20] body of jesus
[22:22] for that body is not an angel being made
[22:25] a little lower than the angels
[22:27] that it might taste death for every man
[22:30] the revelation 10 visitation
[22:32] is that of jesus's spirit or the holy
[22:34] spirit
[22:35] god's spirit is referred to as an angel
[22:37] or messenger
[22:39] many times in the old testament the
[22:41] angel of the lord commissioned to moses
[22:43] could forgive sins which only god can do
[22:46] hebrews calls moses angel christ
[22:49] saying esteeming the reproach of christ
[22:53] greater riches than the treasures in
[22:55] egypt
[22:56] second revelation 10 verse 3 describes
[22:59] the earthly voice of christ as a roaring
[23:01] lion
[23:02] which represents the holy spirit
[23:04] prophesying through a prophet
[23:07] amos chapter 3 verses 7 and 8 says
[23:10] surely the lord god will do nothing but
[23:12] he revealeth his secret
[23:14] unto his servants the prophets the lion
[23:16] hath roared
[23:17] who will not fear the lord god has
[23:20] spoken
[23:21] who can but prophesy notice that seven
[23:24] thunders utter their voices
[23:25] after the line roared a thunder
[23:28] represents the voice of god
[23:30] the seven thunders must be god
[23:32] interpreting each of the seven seals
[23:34] that were loosed off the little book
[23:36] through a prophet
[23:37] prophesying on the earth every time a
[23:40] seal is loosed off the little book
[23:42] a thunder sounds as seen in revelation 6
[23:46] verse 1 and i saw when the lamb opened
[23:49] one of the seals
[23:50] and i heard as it were the noise of
[23:52] thunder
[23:53] one of the four bees sang come and see
[23:57] third the seventh angel mentioned in
[23:59] revelation 10 verse 7
[24:01] has to be a male human being because
[24:03] god's pattern is to save humans
[24:05] through the preaching of humans paul
[24:08] said ye are saved if you keep in memory
[24:10] what i preached unto you god never used
[24:14] angels to preach salvation and bring
[24:16] conversions to men
[24:18] the bible fully supports this
[24:19] interpretation as david
[24:21] paul and a prophet in revelation 22
[24:25] are all referred to as angels david was
[24:28] an
[24:28] angel of god to both achish and
[24:31] mephibosheth
[24:33] the galatians received paul as an angel
[24:35] of god even as christ jesus
[24:38] john was shown the patmos vision by a
[24:40] prophet who was called an
[24:42] angel identified as a fellow servant of
[24:44] john
[24:45] of his brethren the prophets
[24:48] since the seventh angel's voice of
[24:50] revelation 10 verse 7
[24:52] is finishing the mystery of god he must
[24:54] be a human being
[24:56] chapters 7 and 13 prove this man was
[24:59] god's prophet

[25:29] says as he hath declared to his servants
[25:32] the prophets
[25:34] daniel declared the seal book would be
[25:35] opened at the time of the
[25:37] end when many shall run to and fro and

[25:50] through 26
[25:51] speaks of a latter rain that will
[25:53] restore god's people back to spiritual
[25:56] prosperity the prophet malachi said the
[25:58] hearts of the children
[26:00] would be turned back to the hearts of
[26:01] their fathers pointing to a time when
[26:04] christians would experience
[26:05] god's presence like the early apostles
[26:08] in the book of acts
[26:10] jesus the god prophet echoed malachi's
[26:12] prediction
[26:13] that the christian restoration would
[26:15] take place through a prophet
[26:16] anointed with the spirit of elijah
[26:18] saying elias truly shall first come
[26:21] and restore all things the words of the
[26:25] prophets and christ
[26:27] prove that god's mystery will be
[26:28] completed before the second coming
[26:30] of jesus christ lastly the scriptures
[26:34] following revelation 10 verse 7
[26:36] verses 8 through 11 describe how the
[26:39] spreading of the finished mystery
[26:41] actually completes jesus's great
[26:43] commission because
[26:44] it must be preached worldwide revelation
[26:48] 10
[26:48] verse 11 says prophesy again before
[26:51] nations
[26:52] peoples kings and tongues
[26:55] john symbolizes the church who eats the
[26:57] open book
[26:58] and empowered by its revelations takes
[27:01] the revealed mysteries around the world
[27:04] to prepare god's people for jesus's
[27:06] second coming
[27:07] jesus says we are currently in the times
[27:09] of the gentiles
[27:11] the time that god is offering salvation
[27:13] to all nations
[27:14] while keeping the jews blind to the
[27:16] gospel because of their rejection of
[27:18] christ
[27:20] the 12 new testament mysteries the new
[27:23] testament mentions 12
[27:25] mystery doctrines that compose the
[27:27] complete mystery of god
[27:29] spoken of in revelation 10 verse 7. you
[27:32] may wonder why god chose 12
[27:34] mysteries rather than another number
[27:36] when searching scripture the meaning of
[27:38] 12 is government
[27:39] rulership or a kingdom examples include
[27:42] the 12 tribes of israel
[27:44] 12 legions of angels 12 apostles of
[27:47] christ
[27:48] and twelve pieces of shoe bread in the
[27:50] holy place
[27:51] it is through the type of shoe bread
[27:53] that we can understand why there are
[27:55] twelve new testament mystery doctrines
[27:58] in hebrew shoe bread means face and has
[28:01] gained the title
[28:02] bread of the face this indicates that
[28:05] through this bread
[28:06] god's face could be seen israel's high
[28:09] priest could only enter the holy of
[28:11] holies once a year
[28:12] representing seeing god's face but every
[28:16] sabbath god had constant communion with
[28:18] israel through the continual shoe bread
[28:20] that was laying before the lord the
[28:23] lesson is that through continual
[28:24] communion with god
[28:26] you can come into his presence his face
[28:29] for israel the 12 cakes
[28:31] or pieces of shoe bread were placed
[28:33] before the lord
[28:34] alway in the holy place god always
[28:37] wanted fresh bread before his face
[28:39] the holy of holies as his people daily
[28:42] approached him in worship
[28:44] there was never to be a time when god's
[28:47] people were lacking holy bread in their
[28:49] worship
[28:50] after laying before the lord for an
[28:51] entire week the twelve loaves
[28:54] were eaten by the priests as a most holy
[28:56] offering
[28:57] when the twelve new loaves were set in
[28:59] place
[29:00] each tribe of israel the entire kingdom
[29:03] was symbolized as having communion with
[29:05] god through the weekly eating of twelve
[29:08] cakes god sustained israel's earthly
[29:11] kingdom
[29:11] through his holy bread today he sustains
[29:14] his earthly spiritual kingdom
[29:16] through his twelve mystery doctrines
[29:20] for christians the shoe bread was
[29:22] foreshadowing that god is approached and
[29:24] known
[29:25] through the eating or believing of his
[29:27] fresh
[29:28] sacred word bread represents the word of
[29:31] god
[29:32] as jesus name the word of god says
[29:35] i am the bread of life god's name
[29:38] like the shoe bread is sacred or
[29:40] hallowed
[29:41] paul likens a true worship experience
[29:43] unto the unleavened bread of sincerity
[29:46] and truth
[29:48] the apostle recorded that the
[29:49] thessalonians received his preaching
[29:52] not as the word of men but as it is
[29:55] in truth the word of god which
[29:57] effectually worketh also
[29:59] in you that belief christians like
[30:02] israel
[30:02] have a spiritual government of 12
[30:04] leaders jesus told his apostles they
[30:07] would
[30:07] sit upon twelve thrones judging the
[30:10] twelve tribes of israel
[30:12] the spiritual lesson is that god has a
[30:13] christian government
[30:15] representing the entire group of jew and
[30:17] gentile believers
[30:18] who are privileged with god's fellowship
[30:21] through his holy
[30:22] word we as jesus spiritual kingdom
[30:25] on earth have communion with almighty
[30:28] god right now
[30:29] through his 12 mystery doctrines that
[30:31] reveal his secrets
[30:33] furthermore just as israel could see god
[30:36] only through continually eating the 12
[30:38] cakes we can see her
[30:40] understand god only when we have a true
[30:43] understanding of the 12 mystery
[30:44] doctrines
[30:46] any other contradicting views or
[30:47] opinions would be
[30:49] unholy spoiled or stale bred
[30:52] it is no coincidence that there are
[30:54] twelve doctrines labeled as mysteries
[30:56] not three five or ten in the new
[30:59] testament
[31:00] god is showing us his new testament
[31:03] kings and priests
[31:04] that we are to constantly feast on the
[31:06] preaching of his holy
[31:07] fresh and life-giving mystery truce
[31:11] each seceding chapter in this book is
[31:14] dedicated to the following twelve new
[31:16] testament mysteries
[31:18] the mystery of the godhead the mystery
[31:20] of israel's spiritual blindness
[31:23] the mystery of the new testament church
[31:24] composed of both jew and gentile
[31:27] the mystery of the new testament church
[31:29] as the bride of christ
[31:31] the mystery of godliness restored to man
[31:34] the mystery of christ in you the mystery
[31:37] of the seven stars and seven golden
[31:39] candlesticks

[31:43] mystery of babylon

[33:19] paul's tender love and gentleness for
[33:22] new converts
[33:23] characterized his missionary work in
[33:25] thessalonica
[33:27] one of the greatest dangers christians
[33:29] face is receiving the revelations of
[33:32] god's mysteries
[33:33] intellectually instead of by faith
[33:36] genuine faith works through love hebrews
[33:40] uses israel
[33:40] as an example of hearing the word but
[33:43] not mixing it with faith
[33:45] paul witnessed the same type of people
[33:47] who heard and understood
[33:49] god's mysteries but never received his
[33:51] love
[33:52] he said though i understand all
