Description:
This video teaches how God predestinates events in a fair, objective way through His foreknowledge. Since God knows what each person's final choice about salvation will be, He can predestinate all events. 

Four questions are answered with full Scriptural support:
(1) “ Does God forcefully predestinate some people to heaven and others to hell without giving them a choice?" No.
(2) “If God doesn’t force people to be lost, how do you explain Romans 9:21 where it says there are vessels unto honor and other unto dishonor?” See video. 
(3) "Is free moral agency taught in Scripture?" Yes. 
(4) "Does God give everyone an equal chance to be saved?” Yes.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to teach Bible truth about predestination the Greek definition of predestination is predetermined determined before or limit in advance friends God does determine events beforehand but he only predestinate through a fair objective process called his foreknowledge and this order is found in Romans 8:29 through 30 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified so the order is first foreknowledge God's knowledge of each person's choice about salvation before their birth second predestination third calling or election or choosing fourth justification fifth glorification this order is also supported in first Peter 1 verse to elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied these three scriptures Romans 8:29 and 30 and 1st Peter 1 verse 2 lay the foundation for helping answer our questions about predestination let's answer four questions about predestination the first question about predestination is does God forcefully predestinate some people to heaven and others to hell without giving them a choice no the truth is God mercifully and objectively predestinate some people to heaven and others to hell based upon his foreknowledge of each person's own free more agency even before the world was founded God foreknew what each person would choose in regards to salvation and so he wisely predetermined events in their lives so they have the opportunity to be saved and do his will or if they are lost they have no excuses as to why they did not repent of their wickedness Romans 1 verses 19 to 21 says all men are without excuse on Judgment Day for two reasons first because God manifests his creative power in every human body and second his eternal power is revealed through nature God would never punish a person for something he made them do God is just not unjust there is no unrighteousness with God according to Roman's 914 God will save all who love him but God will give those who do not love him what they want eternal separation from him while the separation for sinners is eternal the punishment is not eternal the lake of fire is not an eternal destination which will be covered in a future video Lord willing according to Ephesians 1 verse 5 and verse 11 God predetermines believers to be adopted into his family as his children according to the purpose of his own will Ephesians 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will a second question is if God doesn't force people to be lost how do you explain Romans 9 21 where it says there are vessels unto honor and others unto dishonour friends God does not force people to be lost again start with the order of predestination in Romans 8 and first Peter chapter 1 God starts with four knowledge about each person's final choice whether to love him or love sin based upon his foreknowledge he forms a few vessels of Honor or Holy Ghost filled Christians and the rest are vessels of dishonor because he knows they will love wickedness Romans 917 gives us an example of this as it says God raised up Pharaoh in the days of Moses that he might show his power in him God knew Pharaoh would keep hardening his heart against God's command to let his people go and so God used that foreknowledge to display the ten plagues and the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea romans 9 17 for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for the same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth a third question is is free more agency taught in Scripture yes free more agency is fully taught in Scripture as God does not predetermine our decisions in Genesis chapters 1 through 3 God set life the tree of life and death the tree of knowledge of good and evil before Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden they freely chose death Eve through deception and Adam through willing disobedience God gave Cain the choice of obedience or disobedience Genesis 4:7 says if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over God also set life and death before Israel in Deuteronomy 30 verses 15 to 20 Joshua told Israel to choose you this day who in Joshua 24 verse 15 notice that God tempts no man but he allows temptation and at the same time will not allow it to be overpowering according to James 1:13 job 1 verse 12 and first Corinthians 10:13 God's judgment is based upon human choice according to Roman's 2 verses 6 to 8 God encourages the pursuit of happiness but reminds us that every work and decision will be weighed in judgment Ecclesiastes 11 verse 9 rejoice o young man in thy youth and let thy heart Cheerilee in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment Ecclesiastes 12:13 2:14 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil at Judgment Day the white throne judgment each person will be judged according to their works or decisions within their freemore agency revelation 20 verse 12 and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works a fourth question about predestination is does God give everyone an equal chance to be saved yes and he does it with love and goodness in John 7:37 239 Jesus offered the living water of the Holy Ghost to any man saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink today any man or woman can come to Christ to drink of his Holy Spirit the book of Revelation ends with an invitation to everyone whosoever will to come to the New Jerusalem revelation 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely God is not willing that any should perish wishes all men could be saved and does not delight in the death of the wicked 2nd Peter 3:9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance first Timothy 2 verses 3 through 4 for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior who will or wishes in the Greek have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth God longs for all to be saved because God does not delight in the death of the wicked Ezekiel 33 verse 11 saying to them as I live saith the Lord God I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live terney turn you from your evil ways for why will ye die o house of Israel God offers salvation with love and goodness to every single person Jeremiah 31 verse 3 the Lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yay I have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with loving-kindness have i drawn thee romans 2 verse 4 or despises thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance Jesus love the rich young ruler in ma 10 verse 21 but the young man turned down Jesus's offer to be an apostle because he loved money Jesus also called Judas friend in Matthew 26 verse 50 proving his great compassionate heart even for the son of perdition your responsibility Peter teaches your job and my job is to make your calling and election sure 2nd Peter 1 verse 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall twice Peter tells us to give all diligence as we serve the Lord Jesus Christ diligence in the Greek means to hasten to make haste to exert oneself endeavor give diligence by your own free more agency and by your own love make your calling and election sure prove to everyone your love for God and the location of your treasure is your treasure on earth or in heaven the Bible says your affection should be set on things in heaven for where your treasure is there will your heart be also you and I don't know who is predestinated to be a vessel of Mercy or vessel of Wrath so we must give all diligence to make our calling and election sure Ephesians 2:10 says God created you to do his good works that he ordained you to walk in for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them in closing if you would like more bible scriptures about predestination or have any questions about this topic please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the
