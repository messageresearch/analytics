[25:00] Praise God. It's good to be in the house
[25:01] of the Lord tonight. Amen. It's always
[25:04] good to be in God's house. Amen. I was
[25:06] happy when they said unto me, "Let us go
[25:08] into the house of the Lord." Praise God.
[25:10] Let's have a moment of prayer if we can.
[25:11] Let's just bow our heads and uh you
[25:13] know, I kind of rushed in after work.
[25:15] I'd like to just maybe take a few
[25:16] minutes and pray if we can by the grace
[25:18] of God. Let's we can just quiet our
[25:20] hearts
[25:21] here. Heavenly Father, Lord, tonight we
[25:25] find ourselves with sound minds and
[25:27] sound bodies and we find oursel a
[25:29] privileged
[25:31] people. Lord, it it's always a sacred
[25:35] thing to come into your house, Lord, to
[25:38] bow our heads and to see saints drive
[25:40] miles and miles and minutes and minutes,
[25:42] Lord, to come and hear thy word.
[25:45] It always makes me feel real
[25:47] little. And Father, we appreciate that.
[25:50] We We expect that, Lord, that you would
[25:53] be the great one amongst us, Lord. And
[25:55] that we would love to serve one another,
[25:58] Lord. We would deem it a privilege of
[26:00] our lives to be able to serve hand in
[26:04] hand in a partnership, Lord, with every
[26:06] child of God in this area. Lord, Father,
[26:10] we've given us a great day today, Lord.
[26:12] You've given us grace to get here, Lord,
[26:14] and health and strength, as we said, and
[26:15] food and shelter, clothing, and jobs,
[26:19] Lord God. And we're grateful for that.
[26:21] We want to take the next few hours,
[26:23] Lord, and we just want to make them
[26:25] yours, Lord. We want to focus completely
[26:28] upon you, Lord. We thank you for this
[26:31] this time of worship, Lord. We just
[26:33] raise our hands or we bow our heads and
[26:36] we just want to say thank you, Lord. And
[26:38] we just want to, Lord, commit our lives
[26:40] into your hands, Father. Once again,
[26:42] dear God, take away all of our nerves,
[26:44] Lord. Take away all of our maybe
[26:47] distracting thoughts, Lord. And Father,
[26:50] may you get preeminence here tonight.
[26:51] May your word and your songs and your
[26:54] worship go above everything else in our
[26:56] lives and our hearts and our minds.
[26:58] Lord, help us to be still and know that
[27:00] you are God as the scripture
[27:03] says. Lord, we quieten ourselves. We
[27:06] still ourselves. And Lord, we just Lord,
[27:09] cast down anything that would exalt
[27:11] itself against the knowledge of God.
[27:13] Lord, we just take take your word as a
[27:16] child. Lord God, let us be children
[27:18] tonight that can just Lord, as far as
[27:20] believing, can just believe your word.
[27:23] But let us be mature as far as sin and
[27:25] recognizing sin and casting down sin.
[27:28] But with childlike faith, accept the
[27:30] revealed word of God for this hour here
[27:33] in 2016. Oh, how we need it. How we love
[27:36] it. Oh God, how we're we're just Lord
[27:39] trusting in it, Lord God. Waiting upon
[27:41] it, Lord
[27:43] God. Waiting for thy word to come forth
[27:45] as the dew, Lord, in the morning, God.
[27:48] As the plants wait for the dew, Lord, as
[27:50] the heart, Lord, thirst for the water,
[27:53] so our soul thirsts for thee tonight,
[27:57] God. This service is so important to us,
[28:00] oh God. The word is the absolute in our
[28:03] lives, God. So Lord, refresh us in thy
[28:06] presence here tonight. Bless every heart
[28:08] and soul that press their way out to the
[28:10] house of God. Be with those that are
[28:12] hungered and thirsting, Lord, as they

[28:16] countries, Lord, from Lord, different
[28:19] states, from this city, perhaps Lord, be
[28:22] with your children, God. May you make us
[28:24] more dedicated to you. Make us fall more
[28:26] in love with you, God. And may you have
[28:29] Lord a better uh Lord a better control
[28:32] of our lives as we learn to yield. You

[46:37] Hallelujah. Praise God. Let's go before
[46:38] the Lord in a few prayer requests here
[46:40] by God's grace
[46:42] tonight. Like to have your seats, that'd
[46:44] be fine, too. Here by God's
[46:46] grace. I have one pretty urgent prayer
[46:49] request here. Um I didn't get any
[46:52] written down. Of course, I didn't check
[46:53] the basket before service. So, if you
[46:55] put in the basket, I didn't get it.
[46:58] The most urgent prayer request we have
[46:59] tonight is that um found out yesterday
[47:02] that the student in my class who had
[47:04] cancer, the cancer came back. Uh she got
[47:06] cancer in the liver, a sweet little girl
[47:08] named
[47:09] Kylie. Uh so let's just lift her up
[47:11] before the Lord here. And I told the
[47:14] mother today, I said, uh next time you
[47:17] know, you know, the date of the next CAT
[47:19] scan or whatever more, let me know and
[47:20] ask the church to fast and pray whoever
[47:22] feels led to. You know, um, Brother Ram
[47:25] said, "Some people were born to fast and
[47:27] pray." He told that to Sister Shakarian.
[47:29] Sister Shakarian said, "How come I can't
[47:30] cast out demons?" But Ram, all to do is
[47:32] fast and pray. He said, "You weren't
[47:34] born to cast out demons. You were born
[47:36] to fast and
[47:38] pray." So, I thought I'll let you know
[47:41] next time I find out the date. Uh, she
[47:43] had a CAT scan yesterday and it came
[47:44] back positive.
[47:46] um a seven-year-old girl and uh you know
[47:49] it just breaks your heart to see a
[47:51] mother crying you know and she said
[47:53] we're trying not to be upset with God
[47:54] because we don't understand now they
[47:56] don't know the message or anything like
[47:57] that but but you can imagine how it
[47:59] battle parents would can't you imagine
[48:00] that as a as a parent you know you you'd
[48:03] wonder why a lot it came back you know
[48:05] after radiation things like that so
[48:06] let's let's keep that family in prayer
[48:09] it's kind of urgent request there and be
[48:12] in touch about that I'll try to let you
[48:13] know if you'd like to pass and pray.
[48:16] We'd like to do that by God's
[48:22] grace. So, that's the first request uh
[48:25] that we have this morning or this
[48:27] evening
[48:28] [Music]
[48:31] rather. Uh any other requests that I
[48:34] didn't get with Jose?
[48:37] Yes, sir. Amen. Well, it's good to see
[48:39] our brother Jose back. We will pray for
[48:41] you, man. We missed you. Brother Kevin
[48:43] got up here on Sunday morning. He said,
[48:45] "I just missed brother Jose. I got a
[48:46] real burden to pray for him and his
[48:47] family." So, we prayed for you, brother
[48:49] on Sunday morning and sure appreciate.
[48:51] Good to see you. Let's pray for his
[48:53] health by God's
[48:55] [Music]
[48:57] grace. Any other needs here
[49:00] tonight?

[49:18] Lord. We'll do that by God's
[49:21] [Music]
[49:25] grace. Praise the
[49:27] Lord. Hallelujah. God is good. God is
[49:33] [Music]
[49:36] good. For those we don't see tonight,
[49:38] let's keep them in prayer. uh by God's
[49:40] grace. Not sure where everybody's at,
[49:42] but uh let's just uh pray for our
[49:44] brothers and sisters. We sure love
[49:45] everybody. And thank God for the
[49:48] testimonies he's done in our lives.
[49:51] Amen. So, let's uh bow our heads in
[49:53] prayer. We also pray for tithes and
[49:54] offerings here. How many know God's a
[49:56] healer? How many know God is all
[49:59] powerful? Let's pray to that all
[50:01] powerful God here. Heavenly Father,
[50:03] again, we love you, Lord. We come with
[50:04] thanksgiving in our hearts. Lord, we
[50:06] know you're more than able. Dear God,
[50:08] dear Jehovah, almighty God, creator of
[50:11] heaven and earth. Oh God, we bow our
[50:13] hearts to you, Lord. And we worship your
[50:15] holy name. You're great. You do miracles
[50:18] so great, Lord. We know the greatest
[50:20] miracle, salvation. We thank you, Lord,
[50:23] for Lord, uh changing our hearts and
[50:25] lives, Father God. Manifesting yourself
[50:28] in a powerful way in our lives to
[50:30] change, Lord, what our our temporal
[50:32] destiny was hell. And now, Lord, by
[50:35] predestination, we're going back to
[50:37] heaven, Lord. Redeemed, brought back,
[50:39] Lord. We thank you for that amazing
[50:41] miracle, Lord, of salvation. We give you
[50:44] praise, honor, and glory tonight in your
[50:47] sanctuary. We worship you, Lord, and
[50:49] give you praise. Father, forgive us of
[50:51] our sins and iniquities as we approach
[50:53] the throne of grace and mercy. For Lord,
[50:56] we want hearts that don't condemn us. We
[50:57] want hearts that are pure, hearts
[50:59] without guile. Oh Lord God, help us to
[51:02] be sincere as we pray. Dear God, for we
[51:05] keep the feast, Lord, with sincerity and
[51:07] truth as Christ as our Passover lamb,
[51:09] dear God, that's the the blood of the
[51:12] lamb is there in heaven for us, Lord
[51:14] God. We thank you, Lord, for that blood.
[51:16] Forgive us, Lord, as we approach you and
[51:18] may you minister these needs, these
[51:20] three requests. Father, we pray for
[51:22] Sister Hua's coworker Cindy and her aunt
[51:25] with a brain tumor. Dear God, we just
[51:27] pray that her faith would rise, Lord
[51:29] God, and perhaps use Hua or someone
[51:31] else, Lord, to share the word of God,
[51:33] Lord. It might be your time to call the
[51:34] person home. We don't know. But Lord, if
[51:37] you want to manifest healing or
[51:38] salvation, we just plead for both. But
[51:41] Lord, most importantly, salvation. God,
[51:43] give us the words and give us the
[51:45] leadership. Lord, if you'd allow us to
[51:47] have an open door, we'd love to go pray.
[51:50] But Lord, if we can't physically pray,
[51:51] then we pray now, dear God. And we ask
[51:54] you be merciful to this person. May they
[51:56] know you in the power of your
[51:58] resurrection, oh God. And may you
[51:59] manifest yourself to that individual,
[52:02] dear God. In Jesus name, we pray for
[52:05] brother Jose's health, oh God. He's been
[52:06] battling the last few weeks, oh God. As
[52:09] we just sang, Lord, in the valley, he
[52:10] restoreth our soul, Lord. So restore his
[52:12] soul and bring him back to this
[52:14] mountaintop of health, dear God, where
[52:16] he could serve you with all of his
[52:17] strength. We ask it in Jesus Christ's
[52:20] name, Lord God. Let our faith rise, oh
[52:22] God. And may he experience the healing.
[52:24] We ask you, Lord, for your glory in
[52:26] Jesus' name. Lord, we also pray for this
[52:29] young child, dear God. Lord, my heart
[52:31] breaks and I just weep and cry, Lord, to
[52:34] see this happen, but Lord, it reminds us
[52:36] as even Jesus cried at Lazarus's tomb,
[52:39] yet he knew the outcome was for healing
[52:41] and resurrection. So, Father, may it be
[52:43] that way, dear God. May you bring
[52:45] healing to this child. Oh, Satan, the
[52:48] blood of Jesus Christ is against you. We
[52:50] pray for healing, dear God. And as your
[52:52] prophet prayed, dear God, we set the
[52:54] blood of Jesus between Satan and this
[52:56] child. And may the blood of Jesus
[52:58] overcome Satan. We know will, dear God.
[53:01] We're trusting, believing, confessing to
[53:03] the high priest. May you minister
[53:05] healing, Lord, to this child in all
[53:07] these requests, Lord God. We ask that
[53:09] you be merciful. We ask for your glory,
[53:11] Lord, to be manifested on this earth,
[53:14] Lord God. This is where we need healing
[53:15] now. Your prophet said, "We don't need
[53:17] healing in the millennium. We need it
[53:19] now, dear God. So let it manifest. We
[53:21] pray. We believe." And you said, "All
[53:23] who ask shall receive, dear God." So
[53:26] minister, we pray to these needs. We
[53:28] believe it. We'll thank you for it and
[53:30] give you the praise and honor in Jesus
[53:32] Christ's name. And the church said,
[53:34] "Let's give him the praise." Praise God,
[53:36] Lord. We believe. We take it your word
[53:38] tonight, dear God. Take at your word,
[53:40] Lord. Minister, Lord, to these, dear
[53:42] God. We thank you in advance, Lord.
[53:45] Thank you advance, dear
[53:47] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[53:50] Jesus. Praise God. Thank you,
[53:54] Jesus. Hallelujah, Jesus. Thank you,
[53:57] Lord
[53:58] God. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[54:01] Let's sing a couple more songs here.
[54:03] It's already 7:30. My goodness. Praise
[54:04] the Lord. Let's just sing a couple more
[54:06] by the grace of the Lord
[54:07] here. Amen. Let's sing. Thy word is a
[54:10] lamp unto my feet. Number 465 there in
[54:13] the book there. 465. Thy word is a lamp
[54:15] unto my feet. Praise God. Oh,
[54:20] thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[54:28] light
[54:30] unto my path.
[54:35] Oh,
[54:36] thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[54:43] light
[54:45] unto my path. When I feel afraid.
[54:50] Oh, when I feel
[54:53] afraid and think I've lost my
[54:57] way, still you're there right
[55:03] beside
[55:05] me. Nothing will I
[55:08] fear as long as you are near.
[55:14] Peace be
[55:16] near me to the
[55:23] end. And
[55:25] thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[55:33] light
[55:34] unto my path.
[55:37] Thy word, all
[55:40] thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[55:47] light
[55:49] unto my path. I will not
[55:52] forget. Oh, and I will not
[55:56] forget your love for me. And if my
[56:02] heart
[56:04] forever is
[56:08] wondering, Jesus be my
[56:11] guide and hold me to your
[56:15] side and I will love you to the end.
[56:27] And
[56:28] thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[56:35] lie
[56:37] unto my
[56:39] path. Thy word, oh
[56:42] thy word, is a lamp unto my feet and a
[56:49] light
[56:51] unto my path. I will not forget. Oh, I
[56:57] will not
[56:58] forget your love for me. And
[57:02] yet my
[57:04] heart
[57:06] forever is
[57:10] one. Jesus be my
[57:13] God and hold me to your
[57:17] side. And I will love you to the end.
[57:25] [Music]
[57:28] In
[57:30] my word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[57:36] light
[57:38] unto my path. Thy
[57:41] word and
[57:44] thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[57:51] light
[57:52] unto my. You're the light into my path.
[57:56] Amen. Oh, you're the
[57:58] light
[58:00] unto my path. Sing that again. You're
[58:03] the light. Oh, you're the
[58:05] light
[58:07] unto my
[58:11] path. Amen. Thank God he's our light.
[58:13] Praise God. Let's see one more song here
[58:15] before we get into the word of God.
[58:17] Let's see number 487 a little bit there.
[58:18] 487. Jesus, we're depending on you. How
[58:21] many depending on the Lord tonight?
[58:24] Hallelujah. Every day. Praise God.
[58:26] Israel came to the water. Praise
[58:29] [Music]
[58:35] God. Came to the waters. Didn't know
[58:39] what to do. There was no one to help
[58:43] them. Couldn't see their way through.
[58:46] Then the Lord moved the water and they
[58:50] walked right on through.
[58:52] Oh Jesus, we're depending on
[58:57] you.
[58:59] Jesus, we're depending on
[59:02] you,
[59:04] Jesus. We're depending on
[59:07] you,
[59:10] Jesus. We're depending on
[59:13] you. Depending on you to see us through.
[59:19] When your face tried by fire, don't know
[59:22] what to do. The devil's a liar. There
[59:27] isn't much he can do. Although he tried
[59:31] to stop us, we see our way
[59:34] through. Jesus, we're depending on
[59:38] [Music]
[59:40] you,
[59:42] Jesus. We're depending on
[59:45] you, Jesus. Jesus, we're depending on
[59:51] you,
[59:53] Jesus. We're depending on
[59:56] you. Depending on you to see. First
[1:00:01] verse. Israel came to the water. Didn't
[1:00:05] know what to do. There was no one to
[1:00:09] help them. Couldn't see their way
[1:00:11] through. The Lord moved the water and
[1:00:15] they walked right on through.
[1:00:18] Jesus, we're depending. Let's stand to
[1:00:20] our feet and sing this. Amen. Oh
[1:00:25] Jesus, we're depending on
[1:00:28] you,
[1:00:30] Jesus. We're depending on
[1:00:33] you,
[1:00:35] Jesus. We're depending on you. Depending
[1:00:40] on you to see. Second verse. When your
[1:00:44] face dried by fire, you don't know what
[1:00:48] to do. The devil's a liar. Isn't much he
[1:00:53] can do. Although we tried to stop us, we
[1:00:58] see our way
[1:00:59] through. Jesus, we're depending on you.
[1:01:04] Glory. Oh
[1:01:07] Jesus, we're depending on you.
[1:01:10] [Music]
[1:01:12] Jesus, we're depending on
[1:01:15] you.
[1:01:17] Jesus, we're depending on
[1:01:20] you. Depending on
[1:01:23] you. Sing the chorus one more time. Oh
[1:01:28] Jesus, we're depending on
[1:01:31] you,
[1:01:33] Jesus. We're depending on
[1:01:36] you, Jesus.
[1:01:39] We're depending on you, depending on you
[1:01:44] to see us
[1:01:47] through. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:01:49] Jesus. We depend upon you, Lord. Thank
[1:01:52] you,
[1:01:53] Jesus. All of our hearts.
[1:01:57] Amen. Praise God. Let's get in the word
[1:01:59] of God here tonight by God's grace. Take
[1:02:01] your Bibles tonight. We'll get into the
[1:02:03] word. But John, I got a little slideshow
[1:02:06] here tonight. by God's grace. Like let's
[1:02:08] start Revelation chapter 3:10. We'll
[1:02:10] start there tonight. I told you last
[1:02:12] week I like to look at uh the rapture a
[1:02:15] little bit more. So kind of this week
[1:02:16] I've been studying on that. We had a
[1:02:18] snow day on Tuesday. So that was a real
[1:02:19] blessing. I got some extra time to
[1:02:21] study. I sure appreciate that. Thank
[1:02:25] God. Sure needed that,
[1:02:27] too. So
[1:02:29] uh Revelation 3:10. A title tonight. Uh,
[1:02:34] I'd like to speak
[1:02:35] on the rapture is pre-tribulation. I'
[1:02:39] like to speak on that
[1:02:40] tonight by the grace of the Lord. The
[1:02:44] rapture is pre-tribulation. So, we'll
[1:02:47] look at that here. Uh, Revelation
[1:02:50] 3. Sorry, I didn't know I had all those
[1:02:52] buildings there. Revelation 3:10 and
[1:02:55] then we'll go
[1:02:56] to 1 Thessalonians, I believe, is a
[1:02:58] text. Yes, Thessalonians 4.
[1:03:03] So, you know, the last few weeks I've
[1:03:06] been thinking about the rapture. I've
[1:03:07] got this brother uh who live streams
[1:03:10] because don't have a home church and
[1:03:13] uh said he said, "Brother Jess, could
[1:03:15] you teach some time on the rapture?" And
[1:03:16] I said, "Yeah, let me pray about it."
[1:03:17] And I really felt like I'd like to do
[1:03:19] it. Um so, and as I studied it, it just
[1:03:22] kind of seemed to open up. And by God's
[1:03:25] grace, we like to look at this tonight.
[1:03:26] I've never taken one sermon and just
[1:03:28] focused on how we do how do we prove
[1:03:30] that by the Bible that the rapture comes
[1:03:32] before the tribulation. So, I got to do
[1:03:34] that this week. I really enjoyed it. I
[1:03:35] think you'll be blessed here tonight by
[1:03:37] God's grace. I really hope so. Hope you
[1:03:39] leave out encouraged. Praise God. Hope
[1:03:41] you get taught the word of God and also
[1:03:43] enjoy this message here tonight by God's
[1:03:45] grace. Revelation
[1:03:50] 3:10. Let's read this one together here.
[1:03:52] We can read that. That's not too long.
[1:03:55] Let's read this on three. 1 2 3. Because
[1:03:58] thou hast kept the word of my patience,
[1:04:01] I also will keep thee from the hour of
[1:04:04] temptation, which shall come upon all
[1:04:07] the world to try them that dwell upon
[1:04:10] the earth. Praise God. Let's go to 1
[1:04:13] Thessalonians chapter
[1:04:19] 4. 1 Thessalonians chapter 4:1 15.
[1:04:26] Now, we're real familiar with this
[1:04:28] portion. It's a good thing we are
[1:04:29] because when I was growing up for 19
[1:04:30] years, I never heard this preached one
[1:04:32] time. So, thank God, as we said Sunday
[1:04:35] night, thank God that he brought us in
[1:04:36] this message and now we know just more
[1:04:39] about Jesus in John 3:16. Now, we know
[1:04:41] the whole plan, the mystery of
[1:04:42] redemption, because the book's been open
[1:04:44] to us. Amen. Glory. So, thank God for
[1:04:47] that, brother John. Thankful you had
[1:04:48] safe travel, brother. Good to see you by
[1:04:49] God's grace. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:04:52] uh 1 Thessalonians
[1:04:54] 4:15. I'll read these here because it's
[1:04:57] a little bit
[1:04:58] lengthy, but we're familiar with this.
[1:05:01] Verse 15. For this we say unto you by
[1:05:03] the word of the Lord, this wasn't Paul's
[1:05:05] thought. This was the word that we which
[1:05:07] are alive and remain unto the coming of
[1:05:09] the Lord shall not prevent them which
[1:05:11] are asleep. For the Lord himself shall
[1:05:12] descend from heaven with a shout, with
[1:05:14] the voice of the archangel, and the
[1:05:15] trump of God, and the dead in Christ
[1:05:18] shall rise first. Then we which are
[1:05:20] alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:05:22] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:05:23] the Lord in the air and so shall we ever
[1:05:25] be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one
[1:05:27] another with these words. Now you
[1:05:29] remember before uh man got his hands on
[1:05:32] this Bible there was no chapter
[1:05:33] separations.
[1:05:35] So this leads right into chapter 5 which
[1:05:37] in the original letter there was no
[1:05:39] chapters right? So we keep this same
[1:05:41] line of thought after the rapture. It
[1:05:43] continues down and Paul starts talking
[1:05:45] about how we'll be saved from the
[1:05:46] tribulation. Right? Verse one in chapter
[1:05:48] 5. But of the times and seasons,
[1:05:51] brethren, you have no need that I write
[1:05:52] unto you. For yourselves know perfectly
[1:05:54] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[1:05:56] thief in the night.
[1:05:59] For when they shall say, now they say
[1:06:01] it, peace and safety, then sudden
[1:06:04] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[1:06:06] upon a woman with child, and they shall
[1:06:09] not escape. They Yes. But we shall.
[1:06:14] Amen. But ye, brethren, are not in
[1:06:17] darkness that you should be over that
[1:06:20] the day should overtake you as a thief.
[1:06:23] Praise God.
[1:06:25] Ye are all the children of light and the
[1:06:27] children of the day. We are not in the
[1:06:29] light nor the darkness. So in other
[1:06:30] words, there'll be no surprises for us.
[1:06:33] Praise God. We won't be overtaken and
[1:06:36] surprised. We know exactly and we expect
[1:06:38] what is to happen in the future. We
[1:06:40] expect it to happen and it will happen.
[1:06:44] Why? Because the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:06:45] is the spirit of prophecy for telling us
[1:06:48] things to come. Amen. Verse six.
[1:06:52] Therefore, let us not sleep as do
[1:06:53] others, but let us watch and be sober.
[1:06:55] For they that are asleep sleep in the
[1:06:57] night, and they that be drunken are
[1:06:58] drunk in the night. But let us who are
[1:07:00] of the day be sober, putting on the
[1:07:01] breastplate of faith and love, and for
[1:07:03] in helmet the hope of salvation. That's
[1:07:06] deliverance. For God hath not appointed
[1:07:10] us to what? Wrath. So the day of the
[1:07:13] Lord was wrath to those in darkness, but
[1:07:17] to us, the Bible says this, but we but
[1:07:20] to obtain what? Salvation, which is
[1:07:23] deliverance, right? deliverance by our
[1:07:26] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. How many
[1:07:29] thankful for the word of God tonight?
[1:07:30] Amen. Praise God. Let's have one more
[1:07:32] word of prayer if we can. Heavenly
[1:07:33] Father, we read this holy book, this
[1:07:35] holy words here, Lord God, before us.
[1:07:37] Break it. Help us to understand it now,
[1:07:39] Lord. I've never taught on this topic.
[1:07:40] I've never heard a sermon on this topic,
[1:07:42] Lord, as far as Lord myself. But God, I
[1:07:44] pray you'd open it to us here tonight.
[1:07:46] It's been burning on my heart, dear God.
[1:07:48] And I just trust you'll speak to us
[1:07:50] here. Teach us thy word, Lord. We love
[1:07:52] you so much. and Lord have your way
[1:07:54] tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the
[1:07:56] church said amen. Amen. God bless you
[1:07:57] being se there. Praise God.
[1:08:00] As I said about two weeks ago, I started
[1:08:02] studying on this and then uh was
[1:08:04] emailing sister Kerianne, brother Adam
[1:08:06] about this a little bit this week and uh
[1:08:08] I thought this might be the season for
[1:08:10] me to study it. So as I started studying
[1:08:11] on Monday, just started breaking open.
[1:08:13] It's one of those study sessions,
[1:08:14] brother Jean, you probably know, you
[1:08:15] know, where just like my all these
[1:08:17] things are coming to you and you just
[1:08:18] want to get everything down before you
[1:08:19] forget something.
[1:08:21] So that's what happened to me. I was
[1:08:23] like, "Mcy, Lord, just trying to get
[1:08:24] everything down so I didn't lose
[1:08:26] anything." But I like to uh look at this
[1:08:28] here tonight. By God's grace, I know
[1:08:29] you'll be blessed here. Uh I think we
[1:08:31] can prove it by the word of God that the
[1:08:34] church doesn't go through the
[1:08:35] tribulation. Amen. Now, there's a little
[1:08:36] bit of question as we mentioned on
[1:08:38] Sunday night. There's a little bit of
[1:08:39] question. Well, is there a squeeze type
[1:08:42] of uh session or a um some type of
[1:08:46] brother called it tightening and he
[1:08:48] called it a squeeze. Is there a what you
[1:08:50] say a minor persecution for the bride
[1:08:53] before the rapture? Seems like there
[1:08:55] could. Brother Bam said it like this
[1:08:56] when talking about the millennium. He
[1:08:57] said it seems like there could be. Seems
[1:08:58] like there might not be. So he applied
[1:09:01] that to millennium. Will there be
[1:09:02] children born in the millennium? Will
[1:09:03] children die in the millennium? Brother
[1:09:05] said it seems like there w would be.
[1:09:06] Seemed like there might not be. I don't
[1:09:08] know. And that's what we can actually
[1:09:10] say about the the squeeze. We don't have
[1:09:12] a thus sayeth the Lord on it as far as
[1:09:13] we can see. It seems like it might be,
[1:09:16] but then we're not quite sure because we
[1:09:18] never see a thus sayeth the Lord. That's
[1:09:20] just from my heart. That's just from
[1:09:21] what I've taught, what I can see from
[1:09:23] the quotations. So, it's one of those
[1:09:25] things where you know what? Uh we don't
[1:09:27] need somebody, like we said Sunday
[1:09:28] night, we don't need somebody else to
[1:09:29] make us ready. The Holy Spirit make us
[1:09:31] ready. I don't need an event out there
[1:09:33] to make me ready. The Holy Spirit's
[1:09:35] already in me making me ready. Like that
[1:09:37] dove, the oil on the insides cleaning me
[1:09:39] out all the time anyway. Glory. Amen. I
[1:09:43] don't need to look out there for the
[1:09:44] last sign. We've seen the last sign.
[1:09:46] Now, we can look at conditions.
[1:09:48] Right. We can look at conditions. Like
[1:09:50] brother said, we can look at conditions
[1:09:51] around us and that gives us clues. We
[1:09:53] look at our watch. But as far as the
[1:09:55] last sign, we've seen that brother's
[1:09:58] ministry was the last sign before the
[1:09:59] rapture. Yes. And that's thus sayeth the
[1:10:01] Lord because that's scripture. That's
[1:10:03] revel that's Genesis chapter uh 18 where
[1:10:07] God in flesh comes and discerns
[1:10:08] Abraham's and Sarah's heart or Sarah's
[1:10:10] heart before the body change. That's
[1:10:13] thus sayith the Lord. So we have that by
[1:10:15] God's grace. Now let's get started here.
[1:10:17] There's different views on this subject.
[1:10:18] Some of you remember this. There's more
[1:10:20] than three, but I just I'm just going to
[1:10:21] show you three. There's more than three.
[1:10:23] I'm not surprised by that. Okay, there's
[1:10:25] more than three. So the first one is
[1:10:27] what we believe a pre-tribulation. So,
[1:10:29] we believe the rapture is going to
[1:10:31] happen before the tribulation. That's
[1:10:33] right. And then after that, you have the
[1:10:35] second coming with the church. That's
[1:10:36] Armageddon, millennium, white throne,
[1:10:38] judgment, eternity. Right. Now, a lot of
[1:10:41] people believe this because of the three
[1:10:43] and a half years and the 1,260 days.
[1:10:46] They apply that to the church instead of
[1:10:48] applying it to Israel. And so, they
[1:10:50] believe after that half of the
[1:10:51] tribulation, the rapture goes up. So,
[1:10:53] that's called a mid-tribulation rapture.
[1:10:57] See how important it is to know who you
[1:10:58] are in the scripture, right? See how
[1:11:00] important it is to be identified the
[1:11:02] bride and the foolish virgin. See how
[1:11:03] important that is? It's extremely
[1:11:05] important and know the Jews and
[1:11:07] everything like that. Uh the the third
[1:11:09] one we'll talk about a little bit is the
[1:11:11] post-tribulation. So this is what most
[1:11:13] people believe now. It's kind of swayed.
[1:11:15] When brother Brandon was on the earth,
[1:11:17] uh he said it was mostly people believed
[1:11:18] in the rapture before the tribulation.
[1:11:20] But now as I listen to different
[1:11:22] ministers, I go on YouTube and listen. I
[1:11:23] just type in pre-tribulation, listen to
[1:11:25] a few first few minutes of their of
[1:11:27] their their videos cuz they're nice
[1:11:30] people. But a lot of people now believe
[1:11:31] in this, okay? They believe in that
[1:11:34] because I I think because this said
[1:11:36] people are scared about this that
[1:11:38] they'll miss it. So people like to
[1:11:40] reject that. But people could see this.
[1:11:42] People could be more prepared for this
[1:11:44] because they could see all the
[1:11:44] tribulation say, "Well, I got to make
[1:11:46] ready." So people naturally cling to
[1:11:49] this one nowadays. People aren't living
[1:11:51] like they used to live back in brother's
[1:11:52] day. Are you with me church? They don't
[1:11:55] like this because oh you're scaring me.
[1:11:57] But the Christians not it's not about
[1:11:58] fear. It's about love. Amen. That's
[1:12:01] right. Praise God. So this is the way a
[1:12:03] lot of people now in the mainstream
[1:12:04] churches. I'm not talking about the
[1:12:06] minorities. I'm talking about the
[1:12:07] mainstream. Mainstream believes this or
[1:12:09] some believe. Now there's a fourth one
[1:12:10] where this there's none at all. There's
[1:12:12] no rapture at all. That's what the
[1:12:13] Catholic Church believes. There's no
[1:12:14] rapture at all. They just feel like
[1:12:15] they've already arrived in the
[1:12:16] millennium.
[1:12:18] And we know that's not the case because
[1:12:19] we don't see any lion laying down by
[1:12:21] lamb and them having, you know, just
[1:12:23] good fellowship and things like that.
[1:12:24] But the man said during the millennium,
[1:12:26] Satan's not on the earth. Well, we see
[1:12:27] Satan everywhere,
[1:12:29] right? In cancer and cancer and and
[1:12:32] depression and suicide and alcoholism.
[1:12:34] We see Satan everywhere. But during the
[1:12:36] millennium, Satan's bound in the
[1:12:37] bottomless pit for a thousand years. So,
[1:12:39] we know this ain't the millennium. I got
[1:12:40] a sermon on that. So, I'm kind of
[1:12:41] breaking in that other sermon. So, let
[1:12:42] me stop. All right. So, um, now I was
[1:12:45] taking notes earlier, so I just wanted
[1:12:47] to skip this one. I was watching a video
[1:12:48] this morning. I got through it, but this
[1:12:50] is where I stopped, but I actually
[1:12:51] finished it. So, I forgot to take that
[1:12:52] slide out. Now, I listened to the whole
[1:12:54] message in 1958. Yesterday, on my day
[1:12:56] off, I got to listen to 1958, the sudden
[1:12:58] secret going away of the church. Yeah,
[1:13:00] it's only an hour and 15 minutes.
[1:13:02] There's a nice short sermon. Uh, brother
[1:13:04] Ram though, he says at the beginning, if
[1:13:05] you listen to it, Brother Ram didn't
[1:13:07] have much time to open his Bible. He
[1:13:08] just said, but he was praying for the
[1:13:10] sick so much. So he just said while he
[1:13:11] was coming to church, this scripture 1
[1:13:13] Thessalonians 5 came to his mind and you
[1:13:16] want to preach on it. So he starts
[1:13:17] preaching a little bit about the
[1:13:18] rapture. And then he gives a few types.
[1:13:20] The first type, he said, is your family.
[1:13:22] He said, let's pretend you have children
[1:13:24] that are grown and they're off on
[1:13:25] vacation or they moved away. And he
[1:13:27] said, let's he said, let's imagine that
[1:13:29] they're going to come back and visit
[1:13:31] you, but you don't know the day or the
[1:13:32] hour. He said, my if you were that
[1:13:34] parent, you'd want to have everything in
[1:13:35] order so when your child came back, you
[1:13:37] could just focus on them and not have to
[1:13:39] worry about the mess. He says
[1:13:42] the second one he gave was uh uh the
[1:13:45] attack on Pearl Harbor which Malachi I'm
[1:13:46] sure his eyes would perk up. He loves
[1:13:48] World War II. He gets out World War II
[1:13:50] books every time we go to the library
[1:13:52] every Saturday. Um and brother takes
[1:13:55] quite a while about 20 or 30 minutes on
[1:13:57] Pearl Harbor. And he said they knew in
[1:14:00] advance. There was warnings all in
[1:14:01] advance that the the J he said the Japs.
[1:14:04] Now that's not a politically correct
[1:14:06] term now. So forgive me if there's any
[1:14:08] Japanese out there, but that's the quote
[1:14:09] he uses. Uh the Japs like he uses
[1:14:11] colored and things like that. Negro.
[1:14:13] Those aren't really political correct
[1:14:15] words now. But I'm just saying it. I'm
[1:14:16] not degrading anybody. I'm just saying
[1:14:18] what he said. Okay. But the Japanese
[1:14:20] were going to attack and he gives he
[1:14:22] dramatizes and he goes in to begin
[1:14:24] saying how how uh all these people were
[1:14:27] nervous about it but they planned a big
[1:14:29] shindig. He calls a dance on the
[1:14:31] Saturday night before the Sunday
[1:14:33] morning. I believe it was December 7th
[1:14:34] if I'm not mistaken. Uh where the the
[1:14:36] Japanese attacked and he said they
[1:14:38] planned a big dance. They spent all this
[1:14:40] time and money and uh he said all these
[1:14:42] soldiers were worried. He said but these
[1:14:43] girls walked in and threw their legs up
[1:14:45] on the table. Now can you imagine how
[1:14:46] moral that would have been? And he said,
[1:14:48] "You bunch of worry warts." He said,
[1:14:50] "Uh, we could what do you want to do?
[1:14:52] Worry about war all the time or do you
[1:14:54] want to have some fun?" So he said they
[1:14:56] started throwing back drakes. He said,
[1:14:57] "Pretty soon they stripped down the
[1:14:59] women and then took them out in the
[1:15:00] street and put them on a jeep and just
[1:15:02] drove down there and had a big old
[1:15:03] time." He says, he said the next
[1:15:05] morning, he said, "But the whole time
[1:15:07] they were doing that, trying to tell the
[1:15:09] people, don't worry, don't worry. The
[1:15:11] enemy was closing in."
[1:15:13] Yeah. And they didn't even see their
[1:15:14] destruction coming. Is that right? And
[1:15:17] you know the story, they wake up in the
[1:15:18] morning to explosions and blasts. I
[1:15:20] believe it was 7 something a.m. where
[1:15:22] the Japanese finally came and started
[1:15:24] bombing. He said the men had a hard time
[1:15:25] getting up because of their hangovers,
[1:15:27] right? And he said that's how it will be
[1:15:29] with the rapture. The bride will be
[1:15:31] taken away and they'll be still eating
[1:15:33] and drinking, marrying, giving in
[1:15:35] marriage.
[1:15:36] Praise God. And then sudden destruction
[1:15:39] comes.
[1:15:40] Now he spends the rest of the time
[1:15:42] talking about his tax case. Now you
[1:15:44] can't trust the government if you listen
[1:15:45] to that. And uh they always persecuted
[1:15:48] all the the pro prophets of God down
[1:15:50] through the age. Caesar was after, you
[1:15:52] know, Jesus and the Roman government,
[1:15:54] all these things like that and all all
[1:15:56] the saints. And they said, "Oh, we're
[1:15:58] going to put you in jail, brother, for
[1:16:00] 20 years." And brother said, he said,
[1:16:02] "They did that to my brother." They
[1:16:03] said, "What brother do you have that was
[1:16:04] in jail for 20 years?" They checked the
[1:16:06] records. He said, "My brother Paul, they
[1:16:08] put him in jail." He said, "My brother
[1:16:10] John." They put him in jail on the aisle
[1:16:12] of Patmos. He said, "Glory." Amen. But
[1:16:15] he said, "The laws of the land are no
[1:16:17] longer based upon the Bible." Is that
[1:16:19] right? We know that. But he closes by
[1:16:22] saying, "You know, you don't know the
[1:16:23] day or the hour. The bride's got to make
[1:16:25] herself ready." And he closes with the
[1:16:27] story of the rancher whose son went out
[1:16:30] west to find a daughter.
[1:16:33] Glory to God. Amen. And he goes out
[1:16:35] there and they said they had the
[1:16:36] Charleston dance, which today might be
[1:16:38] the Macarena or what do they call that?
[1:16:40] The dab dance now. Ain't that what they
[1:16:42] do now? the
[1:16:43] dab. And when I was in school, it's the
[1:16:45] ma macarina. I always called it the
[1:16:47] macarina to make fun of it. The
[1:16:50] macarina. They always got a dance. And
[1:16:52] Satan always raised up a dance to
[1:16:53] distract the people. Right? And uh he
[1:16:56] tells a story there how they were doing
[1:16:57] the Charleston and the the rancher son
[1:16:59] said, "I don't want that kind of a
[1:17:00] woman. I want a real woman." So he was
[1:17:02] walking away and he saw a pretty girl
[1:17:04] walk out with a dish pan full of dirty
[1:17:06] water, right? And went out and poured it
[1:17:08] out. And he said he just he said
[1:17:11] something in his heart struck her and
[1:17:12] said that's the one. And he said who are
[1:17:15] you? Can I get your name? And he said
[1:17:16] yeah you get my name. And he said he
[1:17:19] said what do you do all the time? He
[1:17:20] said I just wash dishes. I'm the I'm the
[1:17:22] cousin of all these girls. And he said
[1:17:24] something struck the man's heart. He
[1:17:26] said will you marry me? She said don't
[1:17:27] joke around with me like that. I'm not
[1:17:29] worthy of that. He said will you marry
[1:17:31] me? And she said she said this. I'm not
[1:17:34] even worthy to wash your
[1:17:35] dishes let alone marry you. And he said,
[1:17:38] "That's the way the real bride of Christ
[1:17:41] is." Amen. We're not even worthy there
[1:17:44] to be a servant in the new city. But if
[1:17:46] Jesus loves us and something strike
[1:17:48] Jesus heart and says, "You're the bride.
[1:17:51] Then let's accept his wedding proposal."
[1:17:53] Amen. Glory. And you know the story. He
[1:17:57] said, "I give you my word. I'll be back
[1:17:59] in one year's time." Yeah. He said,
[1:18:01] "Make yourself ready." So he rides off
[1:18:04] and she's so excited. And they said,
[1:18:06] "Why are you so excited? when you're
[1:18:07] just washing dishes. He said the rancher
[1:18:09] son, he said he's going to marry me.
[1:18:11] They're making fun of her and laugh at
[1:18:13] her and just make her a spectacle for a
[1:18:16] whole year. They made fun of her.
[1:18:18] Made her cry. Going to have to battle.
[1:18:21] Well, he promised me. Brother Bham said,
[1:18:24] "Oh, he wouldn't marry you. He does that
[1:18:26] to all the
[1:18:28] girls." They said they're they're just
[1:18:31] teasing you. And brother said, "Jesus
[1:18:34] doesn't tease.
[1:18:36] Amen. If Jesus gave you his word that
[1:18:39] you're his bride, then you'll be the
[1:18:41] bride. Amen.
[1:18:43] He don't tease women like that. He's a
[1:18:46] real man. When he finds the right one,
[1:18:48] he gives her a word and he keeps his
[1:18:50] word. That's a real man. We're going to
[1:18:51] preach on some real men coming up here
[1:18:53] by God's grace. Hallelujah.
[1:18:56] Cuz men, as men, we got to be leaders.
[1:18:58] And we find Satan attacks us the hardest
[1:19:00] because we're the leader sometimes.
[1:19:03] Praise God. Amen. We get all zealous and
[1:19:05] can lead real good for a while, but then
[1:19:07] Satan tries to attack us to make
[1:19:09] somebody else lead us. Praise God,
[1:19:12] church. Could be the children, could be
[1:19:13] the wife, could be somebody's neighbor,
[1:19:16] could be your boss, but the man is to
[1:19:19] lead by the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:22] Amen. Glory.
[1:19:26] And so he said, she got ready. She saved
[1:19:28] up all of her pennies. He said she was a
[1:19:29] saving woman. She didn't go spend her
[1:19:32] money
[1:19:33] frivolously and she bought the prettiest
[1:19:35] dress and about a year to the day she
[1:19:38] said, "I know he'll be here. I just
[1:19:40] believe it." And they're still making
[1:19:41] fun of her. She puts on her dress.
[1:19:43] Remember,
[1:19:45] gives puts her two weeks
[1:19:47] in glory. And he said, he said, she goes
[1:19:50] out there and stands there and they say,
[1:19:53] "Oh, look at her. She's so she thinks
[1:19:55] she's going to be married. This little
[1:19:57] insignificant girl." Yeah, right. like
[1:20:00] he'd marry you. And she said, she just
[1:20:02] looked at her, looked at him and said,
[1:20:03] "He promised me." Amen. Christ promised.
[1:20:07] There'll be a rapture. Amen. We got to
[1:20:10] stand upon his promise. Hallelujah.
[1:20:12] Amen. He said they all run. He said
[1:20:14] they're running around her laughing,
[1:20:16] make fun of her, holding hands. He said,
[1:20:18] he said, they said, "Oh, she he's late.
[1:20:20] He's late. He's late." He said, she
[1:20:22] said, "I'm still waiting for him."
[1:20:24] That's right. When it seems like he's
[1:20:26] late, he's right on time. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:29] Four days late. He's still right on
[1:20:31] time. Lazarus. Glory. Amen. He said,
[1:20:34] "Pretty soon," he said, "the laughs of
[1:20:36] the sisters were overtaken by the wheels
[1:20:40] of the carriage and the horses and the
[1:20:42] ne and they saw dust flying up and here
[1:20:45] comes the rancher son." Brother Rab said
[1:20:47] he jumped out of the carriage, picked
[1:20:49] her up, and jumped back in and said,
[1:20:50] "Honey, I'm taking you home to
[1:20:52] Chicago." Amen. Church, that's what
[1:20:55] Christ does. He comes in a moment. We we
[1:20:58] will we'll will know when he's coming by
[1:20:59] the Holy Spirit. Not the day or the
[1:21:02] hour, but we'll know the coming is soon
[1:21:04] by God's grace. And if the type is
[1:21:07] right, we'll see our loved ones. That's
[1:21:09] right. If that type is correct. If that
[1:21:12] type work for the first coming, then
[1:21:14] perhaps it'll work for the second
[1:21:15] coming. I said
[1:21:18] perhaps thus sayith the Lord, but that's
[1:21:20] what brother taught. Praise God. Ain't
[1:21:23] that a beautiful story? Amen. The sudden
[1:21:25] secret going away of the church. That's
[1:21:27] right. Praise God. She saved up, was
[1:21:29] already he kept his word. He kept his
[1:21:31] promise. Amen. Now, let's get into the
[1:21:34] word of God. Have your Bibles handy if
[1:21:36] you could here. I didn't plan to do
[1:21:37] that. I just kind of came to me. I just
[1:21:38] didn't want to stop from telling that
[1:21:40] story. I just love that story because
[1:21:42] it's just like me. Praise God. All
[1:21:44] right. Reason number one. But I got
[1:21:46] seven reasons, seven Bible proofs on
[1:21:50] uh on why the rapture is
[1:21:53] pre-tribulation. Now, what I did is I
[1:21:54] like I told you, I just typed in
[1:21:56] pre-tribulation last week. I started
[1:21:57] watching videos. I found one I really
[1:21:59] liked and it was called seven reasons
[1:22:01] the rapture is pre-tribulation. So, I
[1:22:03] did I listened to that one and this guy
[1:22:04] was extremely scriptural. I thought,
[1:22:06] mercy, are you listening to brother
[1:22:07] Brandham or what? But I don't know for
[1:22:09] sure. But what I did is I took his
[1:22:11] thoughts and I sifted through because
[1:22:13] not all of them I agreed with. For
[1:22:14] example, he said, he said, "Every
[1:22:16] Christian has the Holy Spirit and will
[1:22:17] go in the rapture." He said, "There's
[1:22:19] not two kinds of Christians. There's
[1:22:20] only one kind." I said, "Nah, that's not
[1:22:21] right. There's two kinds of Christians."
[1:22:24] Praise God. There's a Christian that was
[1:22:26] the that that was cut out of that
[1:22:28] pattern of material fabric, right? That
[1:22:30] that's the elect lady, but the leftover
[1:22:33] remnant, that's still Christian. That's
[1:22:35] still virgin. Is that right? But that
[1:22:38] ain't the right pattern. That's not part
[1:22:40] of the pattern of the bride. Amen. But
[1:22:43] there are two kinds of Christians.
[1:22:45] Praise God. It's exactly right. There's
[1:22:47] one that has oil. There's one that's
[1:22:48] wise and one that's foolish. Now, the
[1:22:50] first reason is the tribulation concerns
[1:22:53] trouble for Israel, not the bride. Okay?
[1:22:58] How many believe that? Amen. Now, this
[1:23:00] next slide has scripture. So, what I'm
[1:23:02] doing is I'm giving reasons, scripture,
[1:23:05] quotes. That's how I'm going to teach
[1:23:07] this. I might not finish this tonight.
[1:23:09] In fact, I doubt I will, but uh maybe
[1:23:12] we'll finish it Sunday night. Unless the
[1:23:13] Kadimas want to give their testimony or
[1:23:15] the ravers. I'm sorry I forgot to ask
[1:23:16] you again. I asked you one time, but I
[1:23:18] haven't followed up with that. But if
[1:23:19] they want to give their testimonies on
[1:23:20] Sunday night, we'd love to hear that,
[1:23:21] too. But praise God. Amen. Sorry,
[1:23:25] brother. I I just forgot. Forgive me.
[1:23:28] Okay. Now, okay, let me give me a
[1:23:30] moment. Well, that's okay. For some
[1:23:33] reason, I didn't I didn't shrink it, but
[1:23:34] that just says scriptures. So, these are
[1:23:36] all the scriptures that prove uh the
[1:23:40] tribulation is for Israel. So, let's
[1:23:43] read a couple of
[1:23:45] these. There's just so many good
[1:23:49] ones. And I got Okay, I got Revelation
[1:23:51] 12. Okay, got that. All right, Daniel
[1:23:54] 12:1 is the most obvious. Let's read
[1:23:56] there. And then Jeremiah 30:7 is a good
[1:23:59] one, too. Uh spelling it out. So, let's
[1:24:02] read this. Daniel
[1:24:07] 12:1. How many believe Daniel is a
[1:24:09] critical book for understanding the end
[1:24:10] time? Amen. Absolutely. Praise God. We
[1:24:12] went through Daniel 70 weeks a few well
[1:24:14] last year and I had just such good
[1:24:16] testimonies come out of that. People
[1:24:18] were so feel like they understood it. So
[1:24:19] I thank God for that by the grace of the
[1:24:22] Lord. Okay. Daniel 12:1. Now just verse
[1:24:24] one because in verse two it breaks ahead
[1:24:27] already to the white throne judgment. So
[1:24:29] verse one is the tribulation. Verse two
[1:24:31] is the white throne judgment because it
[1:24:32] says some are separated from uh the left
[1:24:35] hand and right hand. So see you really
[1:24:37] need the Holy Spirit to rightly divide
[1:24:38] the word. That's where denominations
[1:24:41] fail. They get really critical about
[1:24:43] preachers like me and other preachers
[1:24:44] that will take one scripture here, one
[1:24:46] scripture there, and place it together
[1:24:47] to make a doctrine. They say, "You got
[1:24:48] to do expository preaching and you got
[1:24:51] to take uh you you're taking the
[1:24:53] scripture out of context." I said,
[1:24:54] "Nonsense."
[1:24:56] See, they they feel like if you don't
[1:24:57] take the whole paragraph, you're not
[1:24:58] going to get it. Well, that's not how
[1:24:59] God is. When Jesus came, he took one
[1:25:02] scripture out of Micah. He took one
[1:25:04] scripture out of Malachi. He took one
[1:25:07] out of Genesis.
[1:25:09] Glory. And he start because he hides
[1:25:11] himself from the wise and prudent.
[1:25:13] Praise God. He took a few out of Isaiah
[1:25:15] 9, Isaiah 7, Isaiah 10, Isaiah, he takes
[1:25:18] all Isaiah 53. He takes all these other.
[1:25:20] And it takes the Holy Spirit to teach
[1:25:22] the word. Amen. Not a man's theology,
[1:25:26] but it takes the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:28] Ghost to teach it. Right. Right. Amen.
[1:25:30] Daniel
[1:25:32] 12:1. And at that time shall Michael
[1:25:35] stand up, that great prince which
[1:25:36] standeth for the children of thy people.
[1:25:39] So Michael's going to stand up for thy
[1:25:41] people,
[1:25:42] Daniel. Right. Okay. And there shall be
[1:25:46] a time of trouble such as never was
[1:25:49] since there was a nation even to that
[1:25:51] same time. And at that time thy people
[1:25:55] shall be delivered.
[1:25:57] everyone that shall be found written in
[1:26:00] thy book. Now, if you know later what
[1:26:02] brother uh the Bible's talking about
[1:26:04] here, they're delivered, which means
[1:26:06] they're baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:08] Because if you know the mystery of the
[1:26:09] fifth seal, those martyrs, those Jews
[1:26:11] cry out and say, "How long until you
[1:26:13] avenge our blood?" And the the voice
[1:26:15] says, which must been the voice of the
[1:26:16] Lord, I imagine. And the voice of the
[1:26:18] Lord said, "Uh, here are some white
[1:26:21] robes will be given to you later." He
[1:26:22] said, "But uh Terry here until thy
[1:26:25] fellow servants are martyed like you
[1:26:27] were martyed." Right? And brother man
[1:26:29] uses the fifth seal to show how the
[1:26:31] 144,000 will be filled with the Holy
[1:26:33] Ghost, but will still have to be martyed
[1:26:35] for the gospel. So this is a Holy Ghost
[1:26:38] salvation, a Holy Ghost deliverance,
[1:26:41] which is the greatest deliverance you
[1:26:42] could ever have. Hallelujah. That's
[1:26:45] right. Now verse two, as I said, is the
[1:26:47] white throne. And many of them shall
[1:26:49] sleep in the dust of the earth, shall
[1:26:50] wake, some to everlasting life, and some
[1:26:53] to shame and everlasting contempt. That
[1:26:55] has to be the second resurrection,
[1:26:56] church. There's two resurrections. The
[1:26:58] first resurrection is the rapture. The
[1:27:00] second resurrection we know is the white
[1:27:03] throne judgment. How many with me?
[1:27:04] That's right. If you know your church
[1:27:05] age book, then you'll understand this
[1:27:06] pretty good because a lot of this, you
[1:27:08] know, that's kind of like my beginner's
[1:27:10] textbook. I think I like to I like to
[1:27:12] point people's like, "Amen." And whoa.
[1:27:13] You know, when they first came in, I'd
[1:27:15] say you need to read the church age
[1:27:16] book. That's that's where I start.
[1:27:17] That's a good place to because it's just
[1:27:19] teaching right down through right it
[1:27:21] just teach you teach you teach you teach
[1:27:22] you brother said that's prerequisite to
[1:27:24] understanding other things right praise
[1:27:26] God you have to understand the church
[1:27:28] ages and all those doctrines he said
[1:27:30] that makes way for the seals the
[1:27:31] trumpets all those things like that amen
[1:27:35] now so it's a time of trouble for thy
[1:27:38] people for the Jews praise God uh which
[1:27:41] has never been on the earth or will ever
[1:27:44] be after my what a time Jeremiah 30:7,
[1:27:48] please. Jeremiah
[1:27:54] 30:7. Just really excited to preach
[1:27:56] this. I never took this text before as
[1:27:57] far as can I prove it by the
[1:28:00] scripture that the rapture is
[1:28:02] pre-tribulation. I always believed it
[1:28:04] and like we said on Sunday night, we
[1:28:06] just wonder how will there be a little
[1:28:07] bit of persecution to go through or not.
[1:28:09] And uh there may be, but for sure uh the
[1:28:13] bride, as we saw in 1 Thessalonians 5,
[1:28:16] is not ordained to wrath. She's ordained
[1:28:19] to salvation. Amen. Hallelujah. She's
[1:28:22] not ordained to divine wrath. Now, she
[1:28:24] also gets chastisement, but chastisement
[1:28:26] is different than wrath.
[1:28:29] Praise God. Amen. Like you chasen your
[1:28:31] children. You don't have wrath against
[1:28:33] your children to destroy them. Well, we
[1:28:35] at least we shouldn't in the message,
[1:28:37] right? us Christians now, uh,
[1:28:40] chastisements for all children. All of
[1:28:42] God's children will be chasened, but all
[1:28:44] God's children will not endure wrath.
[1:28:48] What do they got to do wrath for?
[1:28:49] There's no there's no condemnation them
[1:28:51] there in Christ Jesus,
[1:28:53] right? Verse
[1:28:55] seven, alas, for that day is great, so
[1:28:57] that none is like it. It is even the
[1:28:59] time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be
[1:29:02] saved out of it. Yes. Now, I believe
[1:29:06] that again is being saved with the Holy
[1:29:08] Ghost because remember all those that
[1:29:10] don't get uh uh the Holy Ghost worship
[1:29:13] the beasts and die and their names are
[1:29:16] not on the book of life. That's right.
[1:29:18] That's the scripture. I can prove that
[1:29:19] to you. I got I got notes on that, but I
[1:29:21] can't get to it right now. I can't prove
[1:29:22] it to you right now, but I I believe the
[1:29:24] Bible could prove it to you later if we
[1:29:25] study it out. Okay, let's go to Matthew
[1:29:28] 8:9-12. Matthew 8
[1:29:31] 9-12. And brother Jean, can you just
[1:29:33] jump ahead and get Revelation 7 1-4? Can
[1:29:36] you get that by God's
[1:29:40] grace? Matthew 8. We might as well take
[1:29:42] our
[1:29:44] time. I just don't like that feeling of
[1:29:47] trying to rush through a sermon and then
[1:29:48] when I just relax and I go an hour and a
[1:29:50] half or hour 45 minutes and you're all
[1:29:51] so patient with me. So that's right. I
[1:29:53] want to find the in between. All right.
[1:29:56] I don't want to rush, but I I just want
[1:29:57] to be able to say, "Okay, I don't have
[1:29:58] to finish this thought. I can kind of
[1:30:00] continue on this next time.
[1:30:02] Oh my. I've done it good with David with
[1:30:04] that. I've gone what 19 messages. We've
[1:30:06] done good on that. But some of these I
[1:30:08] just feel like I just want to get it all
[1:30:09] in one punch and I just can't do it.
[1:30:11] Matthew 8 9 through12. I'll read that
[1:30:13] and then brother Sean you'll get
[1:30:14] Revelation 7. Matthew 8 9
[1:30:18] through12. Okay. For I am a man under
[1:30:21] authority having soldiers unto
[1:30:24] me. Is that the right
[1:30:27] one? Okay. Yeah. Right. I got to keep
[1:30:29] going. Thank you. And I say to this man,
[1:30:31] "Go." And he goes to another come and he
[1:30:32] cometh unto my servant do this and he
[1:30:34] doeth it. But when Jesus heard he
[1:30:35] marveled and said unto them that found
[1:30:37] ver I said to you I have not found so
[1:30:39] great faith no not in Israel. So he
[1:30:42] comes to a Roman centurion and a
[1:30:43] gentile. He said what amazing faith that
[1:30:46] is. I don't even find that faith amongst
[1:30:48] my own sheep.
[1:30:51] And I say unto you that many shall come
[1:30:53] from the east and the west and shall sit
[1:30:54] down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in
[1:30:57] the kingdom of heaven. But the children
[1:30:58] of the kingdom. So he's talking about
[1:31:00] Jew or Gentiles. So many like the Romans
[1:31:02] and will come and sit down with Abraham
[1:31:05] and his children. But in verse 11, many
[1:31:09] come from the east. I'm sorry, verse 12.
[1:31:11] But the children of the kingdom shall be
[1:31:12] cast out into outer darkness. There
[1:31:14] should be weeping and nashing of teeth.
[1:31:16] Amen.
[1:31:18] I got all kinds of scriptures coming up.
[1:31:20] Weeping and nashing of teeth is always
[1:31:22] judgment and divine wrath. That's right.
[1:31:25] All through the New Testament, right?
[1:31:28] You'll never find one scripture where I
[1:31:30] can find a Christian with weeping and
[1:31:32] nashing of teeth. Unless to be foolish
[1:31:34] virgin now, but I haven't found one yet.
[1:31:37] I don't think I don't think you can
[1:31:38] produce one as far as what I can see by
[1:31:40] searching. But I'm always going to leave
[1:31:41] it open. Perhaps you could. Perhaps you
[1:31:43] could. Okay. So, brother John, can you
[1:31:45] read Revelation 7 1-4, brother?
[1:31:48] And after these things, I saw four
[1:31:52] angels standing on the four corners of
[1:31:55] the earth, molding the four winds of the
[1:31:59] earth, that the wind should not blow on
[1:32:03] the earth, nor on the sea, nor any tree.
[1:32:08] And I saw another angel ascending from
[1:32:11] east, having the seal of the living God.
[1:32:15] And he cried with a loud voice for the
[1:32:19] four angels, to the four angels, to whom
[1:32:22] it was given to hurt the earth and the
[1:32:26] sea, saying, "Hurt not the earth,
[1:32:29] neither the sea, nor the trees, till we
[1:32:32] have sealed the servants of our God in
[1:32:36] their
[1:32:37] foreheads." And I heard the number of
[1:32:39] them which were sealed. And they were
[1:32:42] sealed and
[1:32:45] 144,000 of all the tribes of the
[1:32:48] children of Israel. And the church said,
[1:32:50] "Amen." Amen. Isn't that beautiful?
[1:32:52] There. Here comes these angels ready to
[1:32:54] destroy the earth and the sea and the
[1:32:56] land. And the voice says, "You hold it.
[1:32:58] We first got to get these men sealed and
[1:33:00] these women, right? We got to get them
[1:33:02] sealed with the Holy Ghost. Then we'll
[1:33:04] let loose all these things which we know
[1:33:05] later on are trumpets." How many know
[1:33:07] that by God's grace? Because in
[1:33:09] Revelation 8:7 the Bible said the first
[1:33:11] angel sounded and there followed hail
[1:33:14] and fire and mingled with blood and they
[1:33:15] were cast upon the earth and the third
[1:33:17] part of the trees
[1:33:19] were burned up and all the grass was
[1:33:22] burned up. So see trees are burned up by
[1:33:24] the first trumpet. So see the trumpets
[1:33:27] cannot be poured out or cannot be
[1:33:29] sounded until the 14,000 are sealed. And
[1:33:32] the 144,000 can't be sealed until the
[1:33:34] servants of God have preached three and
[1:33:36] a half years. Amen.
[1:33:38] And then that nation, the 144,000 will
[1:33:41] be born in one day. Amen. Glory. That's
[1:33:44] right.
[1:33:46] See, there's got to be three and a half
[1:33:47] years where these brother said the two
[1:33:49] prophets break open the sixth seal and
[1:33:51] uh uh that's the judgment seal and they
[1:33:53] break open all these things happen. Now,
[1:33:55] see the earthland sea are not completely
[1:33:57] destroyed, but they are doing miracles
[1:33:59] like blood to water. I'm sorry, water to
[1:34:02] blood. Sorry. And also uh like causing
[1:34:04] it not to rain for three and a half
[1:34:06] years.
[1:34:07] But as far as destruction of trees and
[1:34:10] land and sea, it's not going to happen
[1:34:12] until the 144,000 are sealed just like
[1:34:16] you were sealed.
[1:34:18] Amen. You love the Lord.
[1:34:21] See, the trumpets hurt the earth. That's
[1:34:24] what they're there for. That they blow
[1:34:26] the trumpets, angels blow the trumpets,
[1:34:27] and it's a sounding of war. The trumpets
[1:34:30] are for wars. Yeah.
[1:34:33] And so, see, the trumpets cannot be
[1:34:34] blown until the 144,000 are sealed. And
[1:34:37] the 144,000 can't be sealed until they
[1:34:40] see Jesus. And they can't see Jesus
[1:34:41] until the two prophets have introduced
[1:34:43] them to Jesus.
[1:34:45] Hallelujah.
[1:34:47] The scripture interprets itself, church.
[1:34:49] I'm not interpreting that. That's what
[1:34:50] the Bible says. Praise God. Now,
[1:34:53] Revelation 11 1 through 1 through 14.
[1:34:56] Oh, I can't read all that. All right,
[1:34:58] let's go to Revelation 11. That's a lot
[1:34:59] to read. Uh I'll hit the highlights
[1:35:01] because most of you know
[1:35:03] this. Okay. Now in
[1:35:06] verse one and one to let's do one to 12.
[1:35:11] That's where the two prophets have their
[1:35:13] three and a half years of ministry. 42
[1:35:15] months right now after they die. They're
[1:35:19] laid there what? Three days I believe.
[1:35:20] Three three days and a half. It's like
[1:35:22] Jesus. Okay. And well not half but
[1:35:25] three. Oh they have three and a half. Oh
[1:35:27] my. I have to look that up. three and a
[1:35:30] half and then after that they're
[1:35:31] raptured. I believe that's the last
[1:35:33] rapture if I'm not mistaken the se the
[1:35:35] sixth rapture of the six raptures and
[1:35:38] then after that then the Bible said
[1:35:40] verse 13 and the same hour there's a
[1:35:42] great earthquake. So once those two
[1:35:44] prophets are raptured there's a great
[1:35:46] earthquake and the 10th part of the city
[1:35:48] fell and the earthquake were slain of
[1:35:50] men 7,000 and the remnant were
[1:35:52] frightened and gave glory to the God of
[1:35:54] heaven. So see those 144,000 are still
[1:35:57] there. They're the remnant. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:00] To see those 144,000 see the rapture and
[1:36:04] they see the earthquake and they say,
[1:36:05] "My, here, God is coming. Oh my, it's
[1:36:08] almost time to get the Holy Ghost. It's
[1:36:10] Messiah time." Amen. Glory. That's
[1:36:14] right. Now look at verse 14. Now it
[1:36:16] says, "The second woe is
[1:36:18] passed and behold the third woe cometh
[1:36:21] quickly." So the second wo wo must be
[1:36:23] this great earthquake in Jerusalem.
[1:36:25] That's what it must be because the Bible
[1:36:26] says right after this great earthquake,
[1:36:27] then the second wave is already passed.
[1:36:29] The third wo is to come. Praise God.
[1:36:32] Now, I don't have a great timeline on
[1:36:33] that, but you got to place the scripture
[1:36:35] together. It's got to make sense. And
[1:36:36] the Holy Ghost can't contradict itself.
[1:36:38] Praise God. So, the second woe is that
[1:36:40] great earthquake in Jerusalem. Now,
[1:36:43] Revelation 12:1. Now, I got quotes to
[1:36:46] back uh what I'm saying up here.
[1:36:48] Revelation 12:1. And if I don't ask him
[1:36:51] about it, and I'll tell you if I don't
[1:36:52] have one, by God's grace. Revelation
[1:36:54] 12:1. And there appeared a great wonder
[1:36:56] in heaven, and a woman clothed with the
[1:36:58] sun and the moon under her feet, and
[1:37:00] upon her head a crown of 12
[1:37:03] stars, and she being with child cry,
[1:37:06] travailing in birth, and pain to be
[1:37:08] delivered. Out of this woman comes forth
[1:37:10] a child that rules the nations with a
[1:37:12] rod of iron. But this woman is not Mary.
[1:37:16] Brother says it over nine times. I
[1:37:18] looked it up. It's not Mary. He said
[1:37:21] it's the Jewish
[1:37:22] people. Praise God.
[1:37:26] Because then you have Mary running away
[1:37:28] and coming back and all this nonsense
[1:37:31] like that. That woman represents the
[1:37:33] Jewish people because Christ came out of
[1:37:36] the Jewish people. Are you with me,
[1:37:38] church? Ain't Mary said nine times.
[1:37:41] That's not Mary. That's the Jewish
[1:37:42] people. He was born a Jew, right? Out of
[1:37:45] the Jewish people. Okay. Now, let's read
[1:37:48] that. Genesis 37:9 and 10. Let's read
[1:37:51] that. That shows how this woman
[1:37:55] uh with the clothe of the sun and moon
[1:37:58] under her feet and upon her head a crown
[1:38:00] of 12 stars. That shows how that uh
[1:38:03] woman is Israel.
[1:38:05] Okay. Genesis 37:9 and 10.
[1:38:10] Oh, the word is rich. Praise God. Amen.
[1:38:12] Revelation 37:9 and 10. Oh my. And he
[1:38:15] dreamed yet another dream and told to
[1:38:16] his brother and said, "Behold, I have
[1:38:18] dreamed a dream more. And behold, the
[1:38:20] son of the moon and the 11 stars made
[1:38:22] obesence to
[1:38:24] me." And he told to his father and to
[1:38:26] his brethren, and his father rebuked
[1:38:28] him, and said unto them, "What is this
[1:38:30] dream that thou has dreamed? Shall I,
[1:38:31] thy mother, thy brethren, indeed come to
[1:38:33] bow down ourselves to thee, to the
[1:38:36] earth?" So see, there's 11 stars. That
[1:38:39] would mean Joseph would be the 12,
[1:38:41] right? So those 12 stars are the 12 sons
[1:38:44] of Jacob, the 12 sons of Israel. Praise
[1:38:47] God. And that woman has a crown of 12
[1:38:50] stars, which are the 12 tribes of
[1:38:52] Israel. Right? That is Israel. How many
[1:38:55] ready for some quotes now? But Jesse,
[1:38:58] are you making that up? I'm trying not
[1:38:59] to, church. I'm trying not to make
[1:39:00] anything up. Mercy, Lord. I don't want
[1:39:02] to make anything up. I want his
[1:39:03] thoughts, not my thoughts. Quotes. No
[1:39:06] good teacher believes the church. The
[1:39:09] church goes for the tribulation, but not
[1:39:10] the bride. The church goes through the
[1:39:12] purification. Sure, under the sixth
[1:39:14] seal, right? Israel does the same thing
[1:39:16] for the 144,000, but not the bride.
[1:39:20] Amen. The bride's forgiven. She goes
[1:39:22] straight to glory in the rapture. That's
[1:39:23] right. She, in my opinion, the last
[1:39:24] member we call up one of these days. It
[1:39:26] might come, you wouldn't know nothing
[1:39:27] about it. Remember, it's a secret.
[1:39:28] Secret catching away. He'll come in an
[1:39:30] hour and you think it not. You won't
[1:39:32] know nothing about it. She'll be gone.
[1:39:33] Too late.
[1:39:35] Then you notice another purging time.
[1:39:38] That's for Israel when she gathers.
[1:39:39] That's the second fold. God purges
[1:39:41] Israel in the tribulation
[1:39:43] period. Out of the millions that'll
[1:39:46] gather there, they'll be selected
[1:39:48] 144,000 and they will be purged also.
[1:39:50] God's purging Israel.
[1:39:54] Praise God. Amen. Even the 144,000 need
[1:39:57] purged, right? But then they're going to
[1:40:00] get the Holy Ghost. Oh my. They need
[1:40:03] those two prophets to make that that
[1:40:05] message live before them. Are you with
[1:40:07] me, church? The same master program that
[1:40:10] we believe is going to be preached to
[1:40:12] them and it's going to be proven by
[1:40:14] signs, miracles, and wonders by the
[1:40:16] spirit of Elijah and the spirit of
[1:40:18] Moses. Amen. Amen. The lawgiver and then
[1:40:21] the prophet to the nations. Right?
[1:40:23] Hallelujah.
[1:40:25] Church age book chapter 7. Now this
[1:40:27] Daniel 12:1, which refers to these
[1:40:30] 144,000 being sealed during the sixth
[1:40:32] seal.
[1:40:34] See that was remember the salvation in
[1:40:35] Daniel
[1:40:36] 12:1. The salvation is the sealing
[1:40:39] during the sixth seal. And the time of
[1:40:41] the great tribulation or Jacob's
[1:40:44] trouble. So the tribulation is called
[1:40:46] Jacob's trouble. And then he quotes
[1:40:49] Revelation 12:1. We just read that.
[1:40:52] Okay. So I'm not making that up, church.
[1:40:54] That's what brother said. That's what he
[1:40:55] taught. Uh what's attraction on the
[1:40:58] mountain? God, you promise it'd be the
[1:41:00] same thing in this day. I pray you'll
[1:41:01] confirm this word. will deal around this
[1:41:03] one promise there. It'll be like it was
[1:41:05] in Sodom just before Sodom was burnt and
[1:41:06] destruction or judgment struck Sodom the
[1:41:09] Gentile world. So judgment is fixing to
[1:41:11] strike the Gentile world and the Jews
[1:41:13] got three and a half more years through
[1:41:15] the tribulation or the period of
[1:41:16] tribulation. Jacob's trouble the
[1:41:19] continuing of the 70 weeks of Daniel.
[1:41:22] How many remember that when we preach
[1:41:23] that? Praise God. There the 70th week is
[1:41:26] halfway done.
[1:41:28] Praise God. 69 weeks are finished. When
[1:41:31] Jesus ministry started with the Holy
[1:41:32] Ghost, that started the first three and
[1:41:34] a half years. Amen. Of the 70th week.
[1:41:37] That's right. But we got half a week
[1:41:39] left. Yes. In other words, we got three
[1:41:41] and a half years left of ministry.
[1:41:43] Praise God. For time for God to deal
[1:41:46] with the Jews. They got three and a half
[1:41:48] years left until the consummation, the
[1:41:50] finishing of all things. And that breaks
[1:41:53] into the millennium after that 70 weeks.
[1:41:54] That's right.
[1:41:56] But the Gentiles are numbered. It's time
[1:41:58] to go and you give that sign you said it
[1:42:00] would be again. Granted, Lord, we're in
[1:42:02] your hands. So, he's talking about his
[1:42:03] sign of his discernment gift, the son of
[1:42:05] man ministry. We'll get to that. 1964
[1:42:10] questions and answers part one. Even his
[1:42:12] wife was in the pal. Speaking of Joseph,
[1:42:13] the tithe of the bride will be in the
[1:42:15] palace in glory at that time. Then Jesus
[1:42:17] makes himself known to the Jews after
[1:42:19] the wedding ceremony. The three and a
[1:42:21] half years and Jacob's trouble. that
[1:42:23] three and a half years the end of the
[1:42:25] 70th week of
[1:42:26] Daniel glory the Messiah is be cut off
[1:42:30] in the midst and he prophesied three and
[1:42:32] a half years it was cut off so he's
[1:42:34] interpreting Daniel 9:24 to the end for
[1:42:36] us all right there's and then there's
[1:42:39] three and a half years left for the
[1:42:40] prophets Moses and Elijah and then at
[1:42:43] the end of their 70 days he means weeks
[1:42:45] as yet determined upon the people as
[1:42:47] Daniel said at the end of the 70 weeks
[1:42:50] of course Jesus is to make himself known
[1:42:52] to to them. Ain't that beautiful? The
[1:42:55] Jews get the same thing we get. Prophet
[1:42:58] with the anointing and then the sealing
[1:43:01] of the Holy Ghost and Christ himself.
[1:43:04] That's what we got. Amen. A prophet
[1:43:06] first with the power of the
[1:43:08] manifestation and then we see Jesus
[1:43:10] himself. Amen. Glory. Amen. But we get
[1:43:14] it first because they turned it down in
[1:43:15] the book of Acts. Remember they turned
[1:43:17] it down. They blasphemed what Paul and
[1:43:20] Barnabas were preaching. Remember that?
[1:43:21] And or Paul said, "Fine, you judge
[1:43:24] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life.
[1:43:26] Lo, we turn to the Gentiles." Amen.
[1:43:30] Remember the blood curse they put on
[1:43:31] themselves. Remember that blood curse on
[1:43:33] the day of Calvary? They said, "Who
[1:43:35] this?" We pilot said, "I wash this blood
[1:43:38] free from my hands." They said, "Let his
[1:43:40] blood be upon us and our children." And
[1:43:42] it has been ever since. That's right.
[1:43:45] And there's still got to be these
[1:43:47] 144,000 die for the faith as well. And
[1:43:50] then that'll be the finishing. My
[1:43:53] goodness. Feast of the trumpets.
[1:43:55] Remember me preaching on the time when
[1:43:57] Jacob had sent the children of Israel
[1:43:58] down there to get the stuff and the food
[1:44:00] and stuff and how Joseph acted like he
[1:44:01] didn't know them and how all these
[1:44:02] things went on. Then he made himself
[1:44:04] known. You remember? And they were so
[1:44:06] scared they went to weeping. Was the
[1:44:08] same as Jacob's trouble. Praise God. So
[1:44:12] remember, Joseph made himself known to
[1:44:14] his brethren. That's a type of Jesus
[1:44:16] coming down. Brother Bam said he picks
[1:44:17] it up out of Zechariah. Remember
[1:44:18] Zechariah, he's going to show them the
[1:44:20] wounds that I got in the house of my
[1:44:22] friends. And the Bible said they'll be
[1:44:24] weeping uh back and forth from house to
[1:44:26] house, separating from house to house
[1:44:27] and said, "How could we do this?" And
[1:44:29] Jesus will forgive him. So at first he
[1:44:31] has to reveal himself as Messiah.
[1:44:33] They'll mourn, but after mourning will
[1:44:35] come rejoicing will become the birth of
[1:44:38] the nation in one day, in one hour. The
[1:44:40] Bible says a nation born in one day. How
[1:44:42] many know that scripture? I forget where
[1:44:45] it's at, but I think it's in Zechariah,
[1:44:47] but I can look it up and we can find it
[1:44:48] real easily. Okay, so that was a type
[1:44:51] just as the brothers were scared. Oh my,
[1:44:53] what's what's I know was Joseph. What's
[1:44:55] that ruler going to do to us? That time
[1:44:57] they were shaken and scared is a type of
[1:44:59] the tribulation right before Jesus
[1:45:01] reveals himself. That's right. Their
[1:45:03] brother reveals himself to them.
[1:45:05] Question answers part four,
[1:45:08] 1964. Look, I love this. One time a one
[1:45:11] time a man challenged me and
[1:45:13] said he said Revelation 12 is the bride
[1:45:15] and all these things like that. I said
[1:45:17] sir I said brother Brandham said it
[1:45:19] plainly Revelation 12 is not to the
[1:45:21] bride. Revelation 12 is to the
[1:45:23] Jews. The Jew that the bride is not in
[1:45:26] Revelation 12. And the church said but
[1:45:30] says it plainly. Revelation 12 does not
[1:45:34] pertain to the bride. It's pretty
[1:45:37] straightforward to me. I don't know.
[1:45:39] There's no sign of any bride type in
[1:45:41] there. 12 stars. It's a sun and moon
[1:45:43] like Joseph's mom and dad. I mean, there
[1:45:45] is no bride types in there at
[1:45:48] all. Revelation 12, I haven't looked at
[1:45:50] it, but I know it is the woman standing
[1:45:52] in the sun with the moon under her feet.
[1:45:54] The moon representing the law. Ain't
[1:45:55] that beautiful? My the woman represented
[1:45:58] Israel, the church. See, Jesus born out
[1:46:01] of Israel. He came out of Jewish
[1:46:02] bloodline, but he didn't have Jewish
[1:46:04] blood.
[1:46:06] But he had to have the come from the
[1:46:07] seed of David, right? To fulfill the
[1:46:09] prophecies
[1:46:11] and the 12 stars in her forehead was
[1:46:13] those 12 apostles, the 12 church ages
[1:46:15] and so forth would just pass. I don't
[1:46:17] know if he meant 12 sons of Jacob. See,
[1:46:20] and the sun was at his her head, which
[1:46:22] you see, the moon is a shadow of the
[1:46:23] sun, and the law was a shadow of good
[1:46:25] things to come, and that woman is
[1:46:27] Israel, not the bride.
[1:46:31] All right. So if there's any questions
[1:46:34] on reason number one, somebody let me
[1:46:36] know because I believe we can prove
[1:46:38] pretty thoroughly through the scripture
[1:46:40] that time is only for thy people, the
[1:46:44] Jews. Reason number
[1:46:46] two, there's no mention of the bride or
[1:46:50] church in the tribulation text in
[1:46:53] Revelation or I could have put Daniel on
[1:46:55] there, too. You're never going to find
[1:46:57] one scripture that mentions the church
[1:47:00] going through the tribulation, right?
[1:47:02] Praise God.
[1:47:04] All right.
[1:47:08] Now, we don't read need to read Daniel
[1:47:10] 12:1 because I already read it to you.
[1:47:12] Uh, and then we already saw on a slide,
[1:47:14] but remember, it's thy people. So, the
[1:47:16] tribulation is for thy people. Now,
[1:47:19] let's read this. I'll read that.
[1:47:20] Revelation 6:9 because that's a big
[1:47:22] lengthy text. This is the fifth and
[1:47:25] sixth seal. And if you know your uh
[1:47:27] seven seal sermons, but the Ram said the
[1:47:30] there's no horse riders after the fourth
[1:47:31] seal because the rapture's over.
[1:47:35] The rapture done took place and there's
[1:47:36] no more church, right? So the horse
[1:47:39] riders stopped riding,
[1:47:41] right? His last ride is death, right?
[1:47:43] Which will be the tribulation, of
[1:47:45] course. But after that, there's no more
[1:47:47] church. There's no more anointings
[1:47:49] because those four uh creatures are the
[1:47:51] four anointings that go on the
[1:47:53] bride. That's exactly right.
[1:47:56] How many got the flying eagle anointing?
[1:47:59] Amen. Now, I hope you don't have the
[1:48:00] scared eagle
[1:48:05] anointing. We should have the flying
[1:48:07] anointing of the eagle. We're flying in
[1:48:09] heavenly places. We're like brother
[1:48:11] said, we're flying above all the
[1:48:13] nonsense of theology, all the earthly
[1:48:16] teachings and earthly traditions of man.
[1:48:19] We're flying way above that. Amen. Up in
[1:48:21] heavenly places, a fearful thing in
[1:48:24] Christ Jesus. Amen.
[1:48:26] That's right. So there's no creatures in
[1:48:30] the fifth seal. There's no horse rider
[1:48:32] because the church is out of
[1:48:34] here. That's right. And brother said the
[1:48:37] Holy Spirit told him that. He said that
[1:48:40] was a revelation. If you listen, listen
[1:48:41] to the fifth seal again. Brother said,
[1:48:42] "I got that revelation from the Holy
[1:48:44] Ghost."
[1:48:45] Praise God. And then he finishes the
[1:48:47] seven seals by saying the seals plus the
[1:48:49] church ages plus the history are thus
[1:48:51] sayeth the Lord. Amen. Amen. Glory. One,
[1:48:56] a few weeks, a few months later, he
[1:48:58] picks it up and he said, "If my great
[1:48:59] grandchildren live to see the uh live to
[1:49:02] see time and all these things, he said,
[1:49:03] "Those seals will still be the eternal
[1:49:06] truth of God." Amen. Because it didn't
[1:49:08] come from him. It came from the Holy
[1:49:11] Ghost. Amen. Glory to God. Brother said
[1:49:14] in questions answer 63, he said, "These
[1:49:17] are the greatest meetings I've ever had
[1:49:20] because this is not in the line of
[1:49:21] divine healing. This is in the line of
[1:49:23] revelation. Amen.
[1:49:26] Greater than Bombay,
[1:49:29] India. Greater than South South Africa
[1:49:34] where they had 12
[1:49:35] truckloads of stretchers and crutches.
[1:49:38] Greater than that, brother had said the
[1:49:39] greatest meetings I've ever had. Amen.
[1:49:43] Church, because he met the Holy Ghost
[1:49:44] every morning before the service to get
[1:49:47] the revelation. He said I'd see the
[1:49:49] vision. I spend the rest of the day
[1:49:51] running through the concordance and
[1:49:52] Bible to make sure everything lined up
[1:49:55] with the word of God.
[1:49:58] I got the quotes. I'm ready to preach it
[1:50:00] whenever I feel led of the Lord. I kind
[1:50:03] of feel led tonight.
[1:50:05] I feel like I feel so many
[1:50:07] leadings. But let's stay with this here.
[1:50:09] But I'll preach that.
[1:50:11] And I believe it's okay to preach on the
[1:50:13] seven seals. Yes. Brother Ram said,
[1:50:15] "Don't add any interpretation." You're
[1:50:16] right. But you shouldn't add any
[1:50:17] interpretation to any sermon. Brother
[1:50:19] man preached. That's right. Praise God.
[1:50:22] I had quote after quote after quote
[1:50:23] brother said from the seals. He said go
[1:50:25] and study it. He said go and get the
[1:50:27] deeper things. I can only the
[1:50:28] highlights. Right. He said go study it
[1:50:31] deeper so you can understand these seven
[1:50:33] seals. That's right. Praise God.
[1:50:38] Hallelujah.
[1:50:40] So we're not ashamed to preach the word
[1:50:42] of God here. Amen. We need the Holy
[1:50:44] Ghost to rightly divide every topic we
[1:50:46] preach on. That's right, brother John.
[1:50:47] Even if it's water baptism, brother
[1:50:48] Jose, even I got to take a tax on Acts
[1:50:50] 2:38, I still need the Holy Ghost
[1:50:53] understanding and interpretation, not to
[1:50:55] add to that word. Are you with me? Yeah.
[1:50:58] I don't care what the topic is. We're
[1:51:00] never too grown up or too mature or too
[1:51:02] smart or something like that. If the
[1:51:04] Holy Ghost wants to teach and reveal to
[1:51:06] the people that we want to be vessels he
[1:51:08] can use, we need God's help every hour.
[1:51:11] I don't need him less. I need him more.
[1:51:13] Praise God.
[1:51:15] Amen.
[1:51:16] Revelation 6:9. Boy, I sure took a while
[1:51:18] on that.
[1:51:24] Mercy. I guess I'm just stirred up.
[1:51:26] Praise the
[1:51:27] Lord. Verse nine is the fifth seal. And
[1:51:29] when he opened the fifth seal, I saw
[1:51:30] under the altar the souls that were
[1:51:32] slain for the word of God. And not the
[1:51:33] testimony of Jesus, the word of God.
[1:51:35] This is Jews. Yeah. And for the
[1:51:37] testimony which they held, Jewish
[1:51:39] testimony. And they cry with a loud
[1:51:41] voice, saying, "How long, oh Lord, holy
[1:51:42] and true, dust thou not judge and avenge
[1:51:44] our blood on all them that dwell upon
[1:51:46] the earth." So there's still people on
[1:51:47] the earth. This is right after the
[1:51:48] rapture. Brother Brandham said, praise
[1:51:51] God,
[1:51:53] and they're crying out for vengeance,
[1:51:54] which proves they're not bride material.
[1:51:56] Brother Brandham said, anybody that
[1:51:58] says, "Lord, give me vengeance upon my
[1:51:59] enemy or upon that church member or upon
[1:52:01] that person, that's not the spirit of
[1:52:03] Christ." Are you with me, church?
[1:52:07] That is not that's a Jewish that's an
[1:52:09] unconverted spirit, not a Jewish spirit.
[1:52:11] Cuz we're the real true
[1:52:13] Jews, right? Which are circumcised of
[1:52:16] the heart and the spirit. Praise God.
[1:52:20] Amen. I imagine the Jews could say
[1:52:22] something about us Gentiles, too. But I
[1:52:24] don't mean anything derogatory. I just
[1:52:26] We're not natural Jewish spirit, right?
[1:52:28] We don't want to be natural gentile. We
[1:52:29] want to be Holy Spirit. I think you
[1:52:31] understand what I'm saying. If not,
[1:52:33] pardon me because ask me later. Verse
[1:52:34] 11. and white robes were given on every
[1:52:36] one of them. And it was said to them
[1:52:37] that they should yet rest for a little
[1:52:39] season until little season. So three and
[1:52:41] a half years is a little
[1:52:44] season until their fellow servants, so
[1:52:47] fellow Jews also should I'm sorry, also
[1:52:50] their brethren that should be killed as
[1:52:51] they were should be fulfilled. If you
[1:52:53] listen to the fifth seal, you'll love
[1:52:55] it. Again, brother talks about going
[1:52:56] beyond the curtain of time. Beautiful.
[1:52:58] Makes you cry. We also talk about how
[1:53:00] all the 144,000 got to be slain and they
[1:53:03] got to give their blood. They got to
[1:53:05] give their lives for Jesus Christ
[1:53:07] because the Bible said all the rest of
[1:53:09] the fellow servants have to shed their
[1:53:11] blood too.
[1:53:13] See, they're saved by the baptism of the
[1:53:14] Holy Ghost. Praise God. Amen. Now, the
[1:53:17] sixth seal, verse 12, and I beheld, and
[1:53:19] lo, he'd open the sixth seal, and lo,
[1:53:21] there's a great earthquake. That must be
[1:53:22] that earthquake we read about. Praise
[1:53:25] God. In Revelation 11, a great
[1:53:27] earthquake. Might be. I don't know. It
[1:53:29] might be all right. Great
[1:53:31] earthquake and the sun became black as
[1:53:34] sackcloth of hair and the moon became
[1:53:35] his blood. See all those blood moon
[1:53:37] people remember they were talking about
[1:53:38] all that. Now I was all nervous about
[1:53:40] that. But really the next blood moon we
[1:53:42] see in the scripture is in the sixth
[1:53:43] seal in the tribulation. Right? So I can
[1:53:45] see why people get upset. Oh my
[1:53:47] tribulation tribulation. But we have the
[1:53:48] confidence we'll not be here. We won't
[1:53:50] see that.
[1:53:51] I ain't going to see no blood moon like
[1:53:53] that. And I'm not going to see this one.
[1:53:54] I might have seen some other ones back
[1:53:55] in September. But I going to see this
[1:53:57] one. Praise God. Right. Verse 13. And
[1:54:00] the stars of heaven fell upon the earth,
[1:54:02] even as a fig tree cast through untimely
[1:54:05] figs. Fig tree. Remember Hosea? Hosea
[1:54:08] says Israel is the fig tree. Remember
[1:54:10] that? Yeah. We taught that not long ago.
[1:54:14] So who is it like in the sixth seal unto
[1:54:16] the fig tree?
[1:54:17] Israel. Oh my. God's God's
[1:54:20] interpretations never fail. That's
[1:54:22] right. They never fail. when she's
[1:54:24] shaken of a mighty wind. And the heaven
[1:54:26] disparted depart as a scroll when it's
[1:54:28] rolled together. And every mountain and
[1:54:29] island were moved out of their places.
[1:54:30] And the kings of the earth, and the
[1:54:31] great men, the rich men, the chief
[1:54:33] captains, and the mighty men, and every
[1:54:34] bomb man, every free man hid themselves
[1:54:36] in dens and the rocks of the mountains,
[1:54:37] and said the mountains and the rocks,
[1:54:39] follow us. Hide us from the face and the
[1:54:41] sins on the throne. And from the what?
[1:54:43] Say that loud. From the wrath of the
[1:54:46] lamb. That's right. Yeah. How is the
[1:54:48] bride going to get the wrath of the lamb
[1:54:50] when she already accepted the grace of
[1:54:52] the lamb? Right. Amen. How is that
[1:54:55] possible
[1:54:56] to get the grace of the lamb but then
[1:54:58] have to suffer the wrath of the lamb?
[1:55:01] Impossible. This is for those that hated
[1:55:04] the lamb, that denied his word. Amen.
[1:55:06] This ain't for the believer. This is for
[1:55:08] the Christ rejector, the Holy Ghost
[1:55:10] rejector.
[1:55:12] Amen. For the great day of his wrath has
[1:55:14] come. And who shall be able to stand? So
[1:55:16] what's the day of his wrath? The
[1:55:18] tribulation. Praise God.
[1:55:21] Now that's shows the uh that shows the
[1:55:24] second reason. I already forgot my
[1:55:26] second reason. Let me go back. Pardon
[1:55:27] me. Uh oh yeah. Yeah. The church and
[1:55:30] bride is not me mentioned in the tri-
[1:55:32] tribulation text. Pardon me. So that was
[1:55:35] a text for the tribulation. Uh the fifth
[1:55:37] and sixth seal. Here's the quotes. Feast
[1:55:40] of the trumpets. The first three
[1:55:41] chapters of the book of Revelation
[1:55:43] reveals all the happenings of the
[1:55:44] church. Then from the third chapter
[1:55:46] until the 19th chapter of the
[1:55:47] Revelation, there's no more seing the
[1:55:49] church. How many knew this quote? You
[1:55:50] heard it before. The church goes up at
[1:55:53] the fourth chapter of Revelation and
[1:55:54] returns back at the 19th chapter of
[1:55:56] Revelation.
[1:55:58] The bride and the groom together coming
[1:55:59] to the earth.
[1:56:02] Remember, there's three comingings of
[1:56:03] Christ, right? For the bride. To redeem
[1:56:05] her at the cross, to rapture her at the
[1:56:08] rapture, and to reign with her. Amen. At
[1:56:11] Armageddon. Hallelujah. Come back to
[1:56:13] rain. Hallelujah. We come back on white
[1:56:16] horses. Amen. Amen. Shortly after that,
[1:56:19] step into the ashes of the wicked in the
[1:56:20] millennium.
[1:56:23] Glory. And then from the 19th chapter to
[1:56:25] the conclusive of the 22nd, it's all in
[1:56:27] the millennium and what will be in the
[1:56:28] years that's a pilot. During the 4 to9,
[1:56:31] God is dealing with who?
[1:56:34] Israel. Yes. Now, I just tried to write
[1:56:37] out the chapters, so bear with me on
[1:56:39] these. Chapters 1 through three of the
[1:56:41] church ages, or I call them bride ages.
[1:56:43] Right. Now, chapters four and five, John
[1:56:46] saw the lamb take the book, right? Okay.
[1:56:50] Now, just so you know, there are bride
[1:56:52] members in here because John sees 24
[1:56:55] elders, right? 12 of those are the 12
[1:56:58] sons of Israel and 12 of those are the
[1:57:00] 12 apostles, right? Amen. So, there's
[1:57:03] bride members in chapter four and five.
[1:57:05] And the church said, it's so beautiful
[1:57:07] because John breaks into a vision and
[1:57:10] church, John saw himself.
[1:57:12] God was there in the vision and he sees
[1:57:15] 24 elders and he's one of those elders.
[1:57:19] No wonder he can shout and scream. Amen.
[1:57:22] He sees himself at the throne of God. He
[1:57:24] sees the lamb going forth and he sees
[1:57:26] himself falling down throwing crows. My
[1:57:29] what a revelation that would have been.
[1:57:32] Oh
[1:57:33] my.
[1:57:39] Hallelujah. Chapter six. Now you have
[1:57:42] the first six seals in chapter six.
[1:57:45] Now the first four seals are the
[1:57:47] anointings of the bride until the fifth
[1:57:50] seal. Yeah. So technically churches
[1:57:54] technically technically part of the
[1:57:56] sixth chapter deals with the church and
[1:57:58] the bride. Right. The first four seals
[1:58:01] deal with the bride. That's right. But I
[1:58:03] know she goes up at chapter 4 verse one.
[1:58:05] I know that church John's the type of
[1:58:07] the bride. We know that. Yes. But I'm
[1:58:09] just saying technically speaking now
[1:58:11] because the seals are open. We know the
[1:58:14] first four seals deal with the bride. So
[1:58:16] not all of chapter six is just for
[1:58:18] Israel. Part of chapter 6 is for
[1:58:21] Israel. Does everybody understand that?
[1:58:23] Yeah. See, brother man makes the blanket
[1:58:25] statement. Oh, just from one to chapters
[1:58:27] 1 to three and then 19 on. But you see
[1:58:30] now that the seals are open, right? We
[1:58:32] can see, oh, the bride is in there a
[1:58:34] little bit, right?
[1:58:36] Brother Jesse did need that flying eagle
[1:58:38] anointing. Right. Right. That's right.
[1:58:41] The aan bride of Christ fellowship did
[1:58:43] need that flying eagle anointing to fly
[1:58:45] above the chicken yard of denominations.
[1:58:48] Hallelujah, church.
[1:58:50] Oh, now get the tribulation text. Now,
[1:58:52] the tribulation actually starts right
[1:58:54] here in the fifth seal, right? That's
[1:58:56] because remember they're crying out for
[1:58:58] vengeance and the voice says, "Yes,
[1:58:59] they're going to die, but the judgment
[1:59:01] will be poured out upon the evil ones."
[1:59:03] Right? Now, the actual tribulation, as
[1:59:06] far as more detail, chapter seven is
[1:59:08] 145,000 are sealed. Remember, before the
[1:59:11] angels blow forth those seven trumpets
[1:59:13] of destruction, uh, chapter eight is the
[1:59:15] seventh seal and the first four trumpets
[1:59:17] and the mention of the three woes in
[1:59:19] chapter eight. Remember, the first two
[1:59:21] go off beforehand because it says the
[1:59:23] third one's yet to come. Chapter nine,
[1:59:25] the fifth and sixth trumpets and one
[1:59:27] woes pass. That must be the third one.
[1:59:28] Yeah, that must be the third one. Yeah.
[1:59:30] Yeah, that's right. Huh. All right. I
[1:59:32] just saw that one because the second
[1:59:33] one's already done. Oh, I'm sorry. The
[1:59:35] second one's done in chapter 11. That's
[1:59:36] right. Sorry. The second that's the
[1:59:39] first row. Sorry. This uh second one's
[1:59:41] in chapter 11. Now, in chapter 10 kind
[1:59:43] of breaks the continuity of this
[1:59:45] thought.
[1:59:47] Chapter 10 is the open brook brought
[1:59:49] down to earth to finish the mysteries.
[1:59:54] Hallelujah. So see brother John and and
[1:59:56] different brothers Enoch when you study
[1:59:57] the word and studies quotes you can't
[1:59:59] make a blanket statement that there's no
[2:00:00] bride from chapter 4 to 19 because
[2:00:03] chapter 10 is all about the bride.
[2:00:05] That's right. That's right. Amen.
[2:00:08] Because the mysteries must be finished
[2:00:10] and John must prophesy again to every
[2:00:14] nation in tongue and finish the great
[2:00:16] commission. Then the rapture can take
[2:00:19] place.
[2:00:20] Glory. So see we got to be careful with
[2:00:22] blanket statements.
[2:00:28] I just got joy in my heart, church. I
[2:00:31] never seen it so clear before.
[2:00:36] Glory. Glory. Now, chapter 11, the two
[2:00:39] prophets for Israel in tribulation and
[2:00:41] the seven trumpet and second woes
[2:00:43] passed. Yes. Chapter 12, Israel the
[2:00:46] woman and the third and the third woe
[2:00:48] question mark. It seemed like there's a
[2:00:49] third woe at the
[2:00:50] end. Chapter 13, the beast and the mark
[2:00:53] of the beast.
[2:00:55] Brother Brandon, remember I read you
[2:00:56] that on Sunday night? Brother Brandham
[2:00:57] said according to Revelation 13:16.
[2:00:59] Remember what Sunday night? Those of you
[2:01:01] who were here, Brother Bam said the
[2:01:02] spirit told him, "Pick up your pen and
[2:01:04] write." And the spirit said the bride
[2:01:06] will be forced to stop preaching
[2:01:07] according to Revelation 13:16. How many
[2:01:09] remember that? And that's where it seems
[2:01:11] like it's a thus sayith the Lord, but he
[2:01:13] didn't say thus say the Lord at the end
[2:01:15] of it. So I'm just not sure. Okay? You
[2:01:17] might be sure. Bless your heart if you
[2:01:18] are. But I if I don't hear thou say the
[2:01:21] Lord church, I have a hard time saying
[2:01:22] thus sayith the Lord. And I just call
[2:01:24] that respect for the Bible. Are you with
[2:01:27] me? Remember, you can believe all you
[2:01:28] want. Brother and brother D believe
[2:01:30] they're going to live to see the rapture
[2:01:32] before dying. Well, that was hope,
[2:01:35] right? They were just hoping to do that,
[2:01:37] right? But when you got a revelation,
[2:01:39] brother said the church is built on
[2:01:40] revelation because revelation is thus
[2:01:42] saith the Lord. So be careful what you
[2:01:46] call revelation. what what we call faith
[2:01:49] and
[2:01:50] hope. Chapter 14, the lamb is with
[2:01:53] 144,000, an angel with everlasting
[2:01:56] gospel, and then they thrust in the
[2:01:58] final sickle, the final harvest. So, I'm
[2:02:01] not sure that's Revelation 14's always
[2:02:03] been the most uh mysterious chapter to
[2:02:05] me in all of Revelation. I don't know
[2:02:07] about you, but it has for me. So, I'm
[2:02:09] just making myself vulnerable there. I'm
[2:02:11] I'm vulnerable on that one. So the bride
[2:02:12] might be in there too because it talks
[2:02:14] about everlasting gospel. Might be or
[2:02:16] might be just the gospel that we have
[2:02:18] going to the Jews. I'm not sure, brother
[2:02:19] Jean. But Adam, I don't know for sure,
[2:02:22] buddy. I'm trusting the Holy Spirit to
[2:02:24] make it known to us. Okay. Chapter 15,
[2:02:26] the seven last plagues and seven
[2:02:29] vows. 16 pouring out of the seven
[2:02:33] vows. 17 the Catholic Church and Mother
[2:02:36] Harlot. And number 18 says, "Come out of
[2:02:39] her my people." So you have one verse in
[2:02:40] there for the bride.
[2:02:42] Glory and foolish virgin as that for
[2:02:44] that fact. Right. Because the foolish
[2:02:46] virgin is God's people. Yeah. Yeah.
[2:02:49] Remember that. The foolish virgin are
[2:02:51] God's people. And listen, the foolish
[2:02:52] virgin are fornown before the foundation
[2:02:55] of the world. That's right. Remember
[2:02:58] that scripture we heard hit a few weeks
[2:02:59] ago. Let's turn there. Uh Matthew 25.
[2:03:02] Why turn there? Chapter 18 is the
[2:03:03] calling out of Babylon and its
[2:03:04] destruction. Go to Matthew 25. I'll
[2:03:06] prove that to you.
[2:03:09] The foolish virgin is just as much
[2:03:11] predestinated and just as much saved
[2:03:13] before the foundation world as the wise
[2:03:15] virgin. She just don't have the Holy
[2:03:17] Ghost. She just doesn't receive eternal
[2:03:20] life on this
[2:03:23] side. And the church said,
[2:03:26] "Oh
[2:03:29] my
[2:03:35] glory." All right. Matthew
[2:03:42] 25. Let's start at verse
[2:03:46] 31. Oh, I'm sorry. Let's skip ahead uh
[2:03:48] to 34. 34. 34 is where it is. Now, most
[2:03:52] of you know this story if you read your
[2:03:53] Bibles real faithfully or you got a good
[2:03:54] memory. Okay. Verse 34. Then shall the
[2:03:57] king say unto them on his right hand,
[2:03:59] come ye blessed my father, inherit the
[2:04:01] king, the kingdom prepared for you from
[2:04:04] the what? found foundation of the world.
[2:04:10] Praise God. The foolish virgin get
[2:04:13] separated the right side and said, "Come
[2:04:15] inherit the kingdom that I prepared for
[2:04:17] you from the foundation of the
[2:04:20] world. For I was a hunger and you gave
[2:04:22] me meat. I was thirsty. You gave me
[2:04:23] drink. I was a stranger. You took me in.
[2:04:25] Naked, you clothed me. I was sick." And
[2:04:27] look at verse 37. Then shall the
[2:04:28] righteous answer, "Lord, when did we see
[2:04:31] you hungry and fed your thirst and give
[2:04:32] you drink?" And you know what Jesus
[2:04:34] says? when you did it to least of these,
[2:04:36] my brethren.
[2:04:39] So, foolish virgin, when you were kind
[2:04:41] to the bride, you did it to me.
[2:04:46] Right, church.
[2:04:48] Hallelujah. That's why I believe people
[2:04:49] that do me good, I don't know, but I'm
[2:04:51] trusting God will save them. Amen.
[2:04:54] People that don't blasphe what I say,
[2:04:56] people that don't blasphe and make fun
[2:04:57] of what I preach, I'm trusting God will
[2:04:59] save them. Amen.
[2:05:02] Hallelujah. They might not believe. They
[2:05:03] might not be able to believe all that we
[2:05:05] believe, but may God grant them
[2:05:07] salvation because they're good to God's
[2:05:10] brethren. Amen.
[2:05:13] See, the foolish virgin are just as much
[2:05:15] for known as the wise. They just don't
[2:05:19] get eternal life on this side. They're
[2:05:21] foolish.
[2:05:23] Praise God.
[2:05:25] But their names are on the book of life.
[2:05:28] Praise God. And they never get rubbed
[2:05:30] off. They never get blotted out like
[2:05:31] Judas's, like Balam's.
[2:05:35] That's
[2:05:37] right. All right. Don't you love that?
[2:05:39] By God's grace. How am I doing on time?
[2:05:42] Okay. All right. Give me a few more
[2:05:45] minutes, Lord. Will I Now, the bride I
[2:05:47] put finally is mentioned again.
[2:05:50] Remember, there's a few times in there
[2:05:52] she's hiding in there. Chapter 10, she's
[2:05:54] hiding in there. Glor. Chapter six, the
[2:05:57] first four seals. She's hiding
[2:06:00] there. The bride is made ready. And then
[2:06:05] they she comes with Christ at
[2:06:07] Armageddon. That's right. In chapter 20,
[2:06:10] the bride's in the millennium given
[2:06:12] judgment. She sits on the throne with
[2:06:16] Christ.
[2:06:19] Right. And as a part in the white throne
[2:06:21] judgment, Jesus said, "Don't you know
[2:06:23] that?" or Paul said, "Don't you know the
[2:06:24] saints will judge the earth? Don't you
[2:06:26] know the saints will judge angels? Well,
[2:06:28] there they judge the earth during the
[2:06:29] millennial years in Revelation chapter
[2:06:31] 20. Then you have the white throne
[2:06:33] judgment. Verse 21, the holy city come
[2:06:35] down from his description. We preached
[2:06:36] on future home last month. Remember
[2:06:37] that? Glorious. Chapter 22. The
[2:06:40] description of the holy city, the
[2:06:41] invitation of the spirit and bride. And
[2:06:44] Jesus words about his coming. Behold, I
[2:06:46] come
[2:06:47] quickly. Grace be unto you. I come
[2:06:51] quickly, Lord Jesus. Amen.
[2:06:53] Right. Now, does that sound better? Does
[2:06:56] everyone understand that? Now, brother
[2:06:59] makes that statement. You don't see the
[2:07:00] bride anymore through those chapters.
[2:07:01] That's that's true for the most part.
[2:07:03] You don't see many descriptions, but we
[2:07:04] know she's hiding in Revelation 10.
[2:07:07] Right. And we know she's also in the
[2:07:10] first four seals of chapter 6. Yes.
[2:07:14] Now, this quote, I'm going to build
[2:07:17] something off of this, Lord willing,
[2:07:18] later on when I preach on uh more of the
[2:07:21] Revelations. Here's a quote about
[2:07:23] Revelation 10. And I'm going to add this
[2:07:24] to some quotes I have on 1963 and
[2:07:27] Revelation 4 and 5. This might sound way
[2:07:29] out there, but let me just prepare you.
[2:07:31] Everybody take a deep breath. Okay,
[2:07:33] brother put said, "Put on your shock
[2:07:34] proof jackets. Go and put it on uh zip
[2:07:37] it up, church, if you I believe
[2:07:40] Revelation 4 and 5 literally took place
[2:07:42] in
[2:07:43] 1963." Now, I could be wrong and you
[2:07:46] might say you're
[2:07:48] crazy, but I believe it took place in
[2:07:51] 1963. Praise God. Amen. Now, I'm I'm
[2:07:55] going to try to prove that to you later
[2:07:57] on. And it's not to be smarter, but it's
[2:08:00] to show at some point that book had to
[2:08:02] be open. The literal seals had to be
[2:08:05] ripped off of that scroll. Amen. That's
[2:08:07] right. Amen. Right. At some point, that
[2:08:11] has to happen. Yeah. Praise God. Amen.
[2:08:15] And then, Brother Bam stands there after
[2:08:17] the second seal and he says, "This is
[2:08:19] thus sayeth the Lord." And the people
[2:08:21] just erupt and praise God. Amen.
[2:08:25] Because a lamb had loosed the seal and
[2:08:28] it just revealed the revelations and the
[2:08:30] people shout and rejoice
[2:08:33] and an angel had just thundered out that
[2:08:36] and now that ties it with the thunders.
[2:08:38] The revelation of that seal had just
[2:08:39] thundered out that morning and then the
[2:08:42] prophet roars that revelation that
[2:08:44] evening when a lion roar who who who
[2:08:47] doth but fear?
[2:08:49] God reveals his secrets unto his
[2:08:51] servants and prophets. Amen. Glory.
[2:08:55] I believe that.
[2:08:59] And here's why. Here's one reason why.
[2:09:02] Brother Brandham said, "Revelation 10
[2:09:04] 1-7 is history." Yes. Well, as far as I
[2:09:08] understand, that means it happened in
[2:09:10] the past. That's right.
[2:09:12] Praise God. Yeah. Amen. Well, if
[2:09:15] Revelation 10:1-7 history, well,
[2:09:17] Revelation 10:1 has the open book, well,
[2:09:19] that book must have been open then.
[2:09:21] That's right. If in order for it to be
[2:09:23] revealed and open, it had been opened
[2:09:25] already.
[2:09:26] So, when did that opening take place,
[2:09:29] church? When those seven angels told him
[2:09:31] to go back to Jer Jeffersonville and
[2:09:33] open the seven seals.
[2:09:37] Oh my lord. I hope just just hope you
[2:09:39] just understand it from the prophet.
[2:09:41] Okay. What's happened upon Mount Sunset?
[2:09:43] God confirming his word. Remember when
[2:09:45] you got the king's sword? That's about
[2:09:46] sunset. That's what all this noise is
[2:09:49] about.
[2:09:52] Noise.
[2:09:53] Notice it's God fulfilling his promised
[2:09:56] word again of Revelation 10 1-7. He
[2:10:00] talks talking about the clouds. The
[2:10:01] people still in doubt. And as usual, the
[2:10:04] church is just as
[2:10:05] puzzled and science and all through
[2:10:08] Tucson. They're writing pieces and
[2:10:09] putting the paper way back over there on
[2:10:11] Mount Lemon. The big cameras didn't see
[2:10:13] it rising from when we were standing,
[2:10:15] drifting on towards the west, showing
[2:10:17] the time is over. It can't go, but a
[2:10:19] little bit peace there. It's at the west
[2:10:21] coast. Judgment struck just in the very
[2:10:24] way it went. Going right up over Phoenix
[2:10:27] and right on across and to the Prescott
[2:10:29] and across the mountains, the west
[2:10:30] coast, right up on into where was they
[2:10:32] going? Right up into Alaska. And she's
[2:10:34] thundering heading right that way.
[2:10:38] And the observatories and all them in
[2:10:40] Tucson are still asking research of
[2:10:42] science trying to find out what it is.
[2:10:44] So high they can't be fog, mist, or
[2:10:46] nothing up there. What did it? Where's
[2:10:48] it at? Life magazine, remember 1963?
[2:10:53] Yeah. They're just as puzzled of that
[2:10:55] supernatural halo hanging yonder in the
[2:10:58] sky as they was when the magi come in
[2:11:01] following a star, saying, "Where is he
[2:11:02] that's born king of the Jews?" What was
[2:11:04] it? God fulfilling his word. And there
[2:11:06] shall rise a star out of Jacob.
[2:11:09] And the God of heaven promised that
[2:11:11] evening time we would have evening
[2:11:13] lights. Three years ago, listen. This
[2:11:17] mystery of Revelation 10
[2:11:19] 1-7. Three years ago, this mystery was a
[2:11:23] prophecy. What time is it, sir? Remember
[2:11:26] that message from 1962? Amen. Praise
[2:11:28] God. He talked all about Revelation 10
[2:11:31] and all these things and and uh
[2:11:33] predicted it. But now it's history,
[2:11:36] right? It's passed, right?
[2:11:40] So, according to brother Brandham,
[2:11:41] Revelation 10 1-7 is history. But guess
[2:11:44] what? We're doing the rest of the
[2:11:45] chapter right now. Amen. Eating the
[2:11:48] book. The bride eating the book and
[2:11:51] prophesying. You're dead. Hallelujah.
[2:11:54] Amen. It's every nation, kindred,
[2:11:56] tongue, and peoples. Amen. Glory.
[2:12:00] 1 through seven is history. Yes.
[2:12:03] But eight through the rest is going on
[2:12:05] right now. That's right. It's the
[2:12:07] finishing of the great commission. The
[2:12:09] promise is fulfilled. What time is it,
[2:12:12] sir? What's the attraction? God
[2:12:14] fulfilling his
[2:12:16] word. He's the same yesterday, today,
[2:12:19] and
[2:12:21] forever. Praise God. Amen. Can I please
[2:12:25] go one more? Is that Can I go one more?
[2:12:27] Okay. Thank you. Thank you. God bless
[2:12:30] you. Amen. I try not to look at anybody
[2:12:32] in the eye. I just said, "Can I go one
[2:12:36] more?" I don't know what response. I
[2:12:38] don't want to see people's faces
[2:12:40] sometimes. It's hard sometimes. Last
[2:12:42] Sunday, last Wednesday night, I went to
[2:12:44] bed about 11:30 after the service, but I
[2:12:45] was so stirred up by service. Woo, that
[2:12:48] was powerful last Wednesday night. You
[2:12:50] didn't listen to that one, listen to
[2:12:51] that one. That was a good message. The
[2:12:52] Holy Spirit speaking to us by God's
[2:12:54] grace. I got all kinds of testimonies
[2:12:56] after that. Oh, and this week I got more
[2:12:57] testimonies of people stopped wearing
[2:12:58] makeup from those videos we made. Some
[2:13:01] people text me saying, "I wondered for
[2:13:02] years." I said, "I just went and bought
[2:13:04] out all this makeup, put it on. I felt
[2:13:06] convicted. I felt just this week, I'm
[2:13:08] looking on online. I come across your
[2:13:10] video. Thank you for making that video.
[2:13:12] I'm done wearing makeup.
[2:13:16] Glory. You never know, church. You just
[2:13:18] never know." That's right. If it
[2:13:20] delivers one soul from the tribulation,
[2:13:24] Amen. not to take that Jezebel spirit.
[2:13:26] Amen. Yes. And not and men too, not to
[2:13:29] paint their faces up. That's right. Like
[2:13:32] a Jezebel.
[2:13:34] Reason number three, the bride church is
[2:13:37] promised a pardon from divine wrath.
[2:13:40] Right. We get chasened but not wrath.
[2:13:45] Huge difference. Yeah, that's right.
[2:13:47] Wrath is divine judgment.
[2:13:50] Chastening is divine mercy to correct
[2:13:52] us. Yes. Every son and daughter must be
[2:13:55] chasened or they're bastards or they
[2:13:57] deserve wrath. Are you with me, church?
[2:14:00] Here's the scriptures. Let's read it.
[2:14:01] Let's get your Bibles ready. Uh but uh
[2:14:04] brother Adam, can you get this one? But
[2:14:06] Enoch, can you get the next
[2:14:09] one? How's your eyes doing, brother
[2:14:11] Kevin? Can you see? Okay,
[2:14:13] brother. I don't want to put you up
[2:14:15] pressure on on you or anything like
[2:14:16] that. Can you get the third one,
[2:14:17] brother? Okay.
[2:14:19] Um actually, we kind of read that one.
[2:14:21] Yeah. Um, yeah, we did read that one.
[2:14:24] Thank you. Let's just let's just do the
[2:14:25] first two and then I'll just hit these
[2:14:27] because we already read both of these.
[2:14:28] But, um, let's read that one. Okay.
[2:14:30] First Thessalonians 1:10. Brother Adam,
[2:14:32] can you read that one, sir? And to wait
[2:14:34] for his son from heaven, whom he raised
[2:14:37] from the dead, even Jesus, which
[2:14:39] delivered us from the wrath to come.
[2:14:42] Amen. We are delivered by Christ from
[2:14:45] the wrath to come. Delivered.
[2:14:48] Finished work. And the church said,
[2:14:50] "Amen. That's why he died to take our
[2:14:54] wrath that we deserve. He took our
[2:14:56] wrath. We cannot experience wrath
[2:14:58] because Christ paid for it. Amen.
[2:15:01] Not for the bride.
[2:15:04] Israel, foolish virgin. Yes. Sinners.
[2:15:06] Yes. But not the bride. She's washed,
[2:15:10] justified, sanctified in the blood of
[2:15:12] Jesus and by the spirit of our God.
[2:15:15] Brother Enoch wrote Romans 5:9.
[2:15:19] much more than being now justified by
[2:15:22] his blood, we shall be saved from
[2:15:26] uh I'm sorry, we shall be saved from
[2:15:29] wrath through him. Amen. Praise God. How
[2:15:33] are we saved from wrath? Well, we got to
[2:15:34] be in Christ. That's right. And you got
[2:15:36] to be baptized into Christ. When your
[2:15:38] life is hid in Christ, there's no more
[2:15:40] wrath for you. That's right. Oh, yes,
[2:15:42] sir. Amen. That's right. All right. Now,
[2:15:46] 1 Thessalonians 4. We're not going to
[2:15:47] read all that because we already did.
[2:15:49] But
[2:15:52] notice he preach Paul preaches the
[2:15:55] rapture to the Thessalonian church to
[2:15:58] comfort them. Let's read verse 18.
[2:16:00] Brother Kevin, can you read 18? Are you
[2:16:02] okay? Okay, sir.
[2:16:06] Wherefore comfort one another with these
[2:16:08] words? Glory. The rapture is comforting
[2:16:12] words. That's right. not troublesome or
[2:16:15] worrisome words.
[2:16:18] The rapture is a comforting text. And
[2:16:21] the church said, "Amen.
[2:16:24] It's not a fearful text." Praise God.
[2:16:29] We're already delivered from the wrath
[2:16:32] that is to come. There's not one
[2:16:34] scripture where it says the bride must
[2:16:36] go through tribulation. It's for thy
[2:16:38] people. It's for foolish virgin. It's
[2:16:40] for sinners. It's not for the bride.
[2:16:43] Chapter 5, please. 1 Thessalonians
[2:16:47] 5. Now, I mentioned some of these a
[2:16:49] little bit
[2:16:52] earlier. Remember verse three. For when
[2:16:56] they shall say peace and safety, then
[2:16:57] sudden destruction cometh upon who? Us.
[2:17:00] Now, Paul perfectly shows dark people
[2:17:03] and light people. Amen. I'm not of the
[2:17:06] night. I'm of the light.
[2:17:09] Destruction comes upon them, not us,
[2:17:13] them as travail upon a woman child, and
[2:17:16] they shall not escape. Not we, they.
[2:17:21] Are you with me?
[2:17:23] But ye, brethren, are not in darkness
[2:17:25] that ye should be overtaken you as a
[2:17:26] thief. Look, we will not be overtaken as
[2:17:29] that type of thief, that type of
[2:17:31] destruction.
[2:17:33] Praise God.
[2:17:36] All right.
[2:17:39] Verse nine. That's what I want to read.
[2:17:40] Verse nine. For God has not appointed us
[2:17:43] unto what? Wrath. We're not appointed.
[2:17:46] That's not our appointment. Thank God
[2:17:47] for that. I've got appointment on my
[2:17:50] clock. Sometimes I like the appointment
[2:17:51] that says, uh, you're appointed to mercy
[2:17:53] and forgiveness. That's the appointment
[2:17:55] I got. Thank you, Lord, for putting on
[2:17:56] that on my calendar. I got a lot of
[2:17:59] things on this calendar, but the best
[2:18:01] appointment I got is that there's no
[2:18:02] wrath for me. When's that coming up? I
[2:18:04] can't find the day or hour, but I know I
[2:18:06] got that appointment on here.
[2:18:08] It's just kind of one of those hanging
[2:18:10] appointments, right? Just waiting to be
[2:18:12] fulfilled. Just waiting to find its way
[2:18:14] in my schedule. And brother Enoch, I
[2:18:15] know I've got room in my schedule for
[2:18:17] that.
[2:18:18] If I will make room, I know he'll make
[2:18:20] room for me. Amen. He'll clear out my
[2:18:23] schedule so I can make that appointment.
[2:18:27] Glory. To attain salvation by our Lord
[2:18:31] Jesus Christ.
[2:18:34] So, revelation wra scriptures are the
[2:18:37] sixth seal speaks about wrath. We're
[2:18:38] gone at the fourth seal. After the
[2:18:40] fourth seal, we're gone. But there's
[2:18:42] wrath in the sixth seal. There's wrath
[2:18:44] in the two prophets of Israel. They pour
[2:18:46] out the wrath. There's wrath to Israel.
[2:18:48] Revelation 12:12. Uh there's wrath to
[2:18:52] all those who receive the mark of the
[2:18:53] beast in Revelation 14 810 and 19.
[2:18:57] There's wrath in the seven last plagues.
[2:18:59] And there's not one mention of the
[2:19:01] bride. Ain't that a beautiful thought?
[2:19:04] When the word wrath is used, it's never
[2:19:06] connected to the bride except to say we
[2:19:08] don't have that.
[2:19:11] Larry, there's wrath in the vials,
[2:19:15] but we're not here in the vials.
[2:19:19] We're gone. We're at the wedding supper
[2:19:21] of the lamb.
[2:19:23] Someone produced me one scripture that
[2:19:24] says the bride must suffer through
[2:19:27] wrath. Now, remember in your Bible,
[2:19:29] it'll balance us out. There is a the
[2:19:30] Bible said all those that live godly
[2:19:32] life in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[2:19:34] tribulation or
[2:19:35] persecution. So there's a capital T for
[2:19:38] great tribulation. Now in our minds and
[2:19:40] then there's a lowercase tribulation
[2:19:42] where we all have to suffer some
[2:19:43] tribulation. That's right. All that live
[2:19:45] godly in Christ Jesus suffer
[2:19:47] persecution. There's some level of
[2:19:49] persecution you must endure if you're a
[2:19:51] Christian. Yeah. Praise God. But we will
[2:19:54] not go through the great tribulation.
[2:19:56] It's for thy people. Let's close with
[2:19:58] these quotes here. I just got a
[2:20:00] few. There's only one provided way of
[2:20:03] God for anything there. Let's stand to
[2:20:04] our feet. We'll just get done with
[2:20:05] these. There won't be one building
[2:20:07] sitting by another one in Chicago one of
[2:20:08] these days or nowhere else. God is
[2:20:10] fixing to rain out that sick seal upon
[2:20:11] the earth. Break that seal and turn
[2:20:13] loose the wrath of God upon the earth.
[2:20:17] But before he does that, the church will
[2:20:19] be gone. The bride will be gone. The
[2:20:22] church won't. She'll go through the
[2:20:23] tribulation, but the bride will be gone.
[2:20:25] His little wife won't go through that.
[2:20:29] Amen.
[2:20:30] Brothers, can you imagine letting your
[2:20:31] beautiful wife, your bride go through
[2:20:36] the most horrible days that could ever
[2:20:38] be upon the earth? Yeah. And then saying
[2:20:41] you love her. No, I couldn't see that. I
[2:20:44] couldn't see that. No way. If I had
[2:20:47] anything to do at all in my power, I
[2:20:49] would keep her from that. Amen. That's
[2:20:51] right. Because remember, the Bible said
[2:20:53] we're not being made accepted in the
[2:20:55] beloved. We already are. accepted in the
[2:20:59] beloved. You already are the children of
[2:21:02] God. Amen. You already are accepted in
[2:21:05] heaven.
[2:21:08] Chapter one. Now, where will the gentile
[2:21:10] church be while Jesus making himself
[2:21:12] known to his brethren? Remember that the
[2:21:13] bride of Joseph with the two children
[2:21:15] were in the palace. For Joseph had
[2:21:16] commanded, "Let everyone leave me. Put
[2:21:18] them all out from before me." So, the
[2:21:20] gentile bride was hid in the palace of
[2:21:22] Joseph. Where will the gentile church go
[2:21:24] to the rapture? into the
[2:21:26] palace. The bride will be taken off the
[2:21:29] earth. She will be caught up before the
[2:21:31] great tribulation to meet her Lord in
[2:21:33] the air for three and one half years.
[2:21:35] While the retributive wrath of God is
[2:21:38] poured out, she will be in the great
[2:21:40] marriage supper of the
[2:21:43] lamb. Then will he return leaving his
[2:21:46] bride in his father's house while he
[2:21:48] makes himself known to his brethren.
[2:21:50] Brother Ram said at some point during
[2:21:51] the wedding supper, he'll stop and he'll
[2:21:53] say, "Oh, excuse me. I got to slip down
[2:21:54] and see my my other children real quick.
[2:21:58] He said he got to slip down while
[2:21:59] they're having their wedding supper and
[2:22:01] he's got to reveal himself to his
[2:22:02] brethren. Amen. And then he's got to
[2:22:04] slip back up and say, "Okay, my my
[2:22:07] bride, let's get on our white horses.
[2:22:08] It's time for the Armageddon." Right?
[2:22:10] It's time for the armies of God. Army,
[2:22:13] rise up. Get your garments. You got your
[2:22:14] garments on. Get on your horses. It's
[2:22:16] time to go down to earth. Just follow
[2:22:18] me. I like that.
[2:22:20] That's all I'm going to I'm not going to
[2:22:21] try to make my own way. I'm just gonna
[2:22:23] follow Jesus. How do you know, Roas?
[2:22:25] Because I'm following him right now.
[2:22:26] Praise God. Amen. If I can follow this
[2:22:29] word now, it proves I'll follow him
[2:22:32] then. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:22:38] At this very time, the Antichrist
[2:22:40] covenant that the Jews have made with
[2:22:42] Rome will be broken.
[2:22:45] Roman or allies then send their troops
[2:22:47] to destroy all the god-fearing word
[2:22:51] abiding Jews. Praise God. Sister
[2:22:54] Priscilla, you want to come to the piano
[2:22:55] here by God's
[2:22:57] grace. Amen. So Lord willing Sunday if
[2:23:00] God carries and if uh I'm here to
[2:23:04] preach, Lord willing, we'll try to get
[2:23:06] the rest of that. We did parts or
[2:23:07] reasons one, two, and three. How many
[2:23:09] believe the rapture is pre-tribulation?
[2:23:11] How many believe that? Praise God. By
[2:23:13] the grace of the Lord, we believe that
[2:23:15] it's wonderful to prove the scripture.
[2:23:19] Um, let me just read you the the next
[2:23:22] reasons here. I won't have time to go
[2:23:24] through the quotes, but let me just uh
[2:23:25] hit the just so you have them in your
[2:23:27] heart. How many believe the first three
[2:23:29] reasons? How many believe those? Amen.
[2:23:31] The fourth is Jesus thought the rapture
[2:23:34] is imminent and unknown as a thief while
[2:23:37] the 70 weeks are numbered. there. You
[2:23:39] You can know the day of Jesus returning
[2:23:42] to the Jews because it's numbered. Yes,
[2:23:44] that's right. But the rapture is not.
[2:23:46] So, no man knows the day or the hour.
[2:23:48] Yeah.
[2:23:51] Five. The rapture is comfort, not a
[2:23:53] torment of trouble. I got more
[2:23:54] scriptures on that.
[2:23:56] It's all down through the Bible. Brother
[2:23:59] says
[2:24:00] it. All these quotes. Look at all those
[2:24:02] quotes. Six. The rapture is the removal
[2:24:04] of the grace of God in preparation for
[2:24:06] the revelation of the Antichrist.
[2:24:11] And number seven, Jesus's own teaching
[2:24:14] about his coming kept the same types and
[2:24:17] shadows of all the righteous escaping
[2:24:20] wrath. Every time Jesus gives a parable
[2:24:22] about the rapture or a wedding every
[2:24:25] time his children escape
[2:24:28] wrath, I believe we got some pretty good
[2:24:30] reasons, church, don't you?
[2:24:33] I believe the rapture is
[2:24:34] pre-tribulation. Like I said, there's a
[2:24:35] little bit of question. That's okay. As
[2:24:37] long as we know Jesus, he'll answer all
[2:24:39] of our questions. He'll give us the
[2:24:41] grace we need to make it through by
[2:24:43] God's grace. Let's bow our heads for a
[2:24:45] word of
[2:24:48] prayer. Just want to give us a time to
[2:24:50] talk to the
[2:24:52] Lord. You know, we just want to have
[2:24:54] some fellowship. You know, prayer is
[2:24:55] fellowship. So, we just want to have
[2:24:56] some fellowship. Father, we just want to
[2:24:58] say thank you for this word tonight.
[2:25:00] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. To
[2:25:02] those first three reasons, it's proved
[2:25:04] thoroughly through the Bible. Lord,
[2:25:06] thank you. This rapture is for the
[2:25:08] bride.
[2:25:10] Thank you, Jesus. The tribulation is for
[2:25:13] the Jew who's blinded.
[2:25:16] The foolish virgin who's foolish to the
[2:25:18] Holy
[2:25:19] Ghost. The sinner who could care less.
[2:25:22] But Lord, we care. We're looking for thy
[2:25:26] coming. As Paul said, the crown's not
[2:25:29] only for me, but it's for all those that
[2:25:31] love the rapture.
[2:25:35] Lord, we love the thought of meeting you
[2:25:37] in the air and escaping the divine wrath
[2:25:41] of God. We love that
[2:25:45] thought. Father, we always love you and
[2:25:47] praise you for that. Lord, I look at my
[2:25:49] notes, Lord. And the second reason,
[2:25:50] Lord, you never put the bride in any
[2:25:52] tribulation text in the whole Bible.
[2:25:55] Never. Showing there's no even question
[2:25:58] about
[2:25:59] it. And thirdly, dear God, you promise
[2:26:02] we're pardoned. a wrath from divine
[2:26:06] judgment. Thank you that the cross was
[2:26:09] our tribulation period. Amen. Thank you,
[2:26:11] Lord. You took our wrath on the
[2:26:14] cross so we don't have to be concerned
[2:26:17] about that, dear
[2:26:23] God. So Lord, from our hearts, we just
[2:26:25] want to say thank you tonight.
[2:26:28] And Lord, is the one of the reasons
[2:26:29] we'll get
[2:26:30] to the fact that your rapture is
[2:26:34] pre-tribulation gives us a lot of
[2:26:36] motivation to live holy right now. Oh
[2:26:39] my. Thank you,
[2:26:41] Jesus. Every other view, Lord, they can
[2:26:43] say, "Well, I've got three and a half
[2:26:44] years to make it right. I've got seven
[2:26:46] and a half years or seven years to make
[2:26:48] it right." But Lord, we don't say that.
[2:26:51] We don't know if we have any time to
[2:26:52] make it right except the very breath we
[2:26:54] have right now. Oh God, help us to use
[2:26:58] this imminent rapture as motivation for
[2:27:01] thy
[2:27:02] coming. That we'll watch our
[2:27:04] conversations on the way home. We'll
[2:27:07] watch our thought life
[2:27:09] tomorrow. And Lord, the Holy Spirit will
[2:27:12] bring to our remembrance, don't think
[2:27:14] that, Jesse. Don't say that, Jesse. I
[2:27:17] could come today. That's right. Keep
[2:27:20] your lamps trimmed. Amen.
[2:27:22] Keep the carbon off your wick. Let your
[2:27:26] light burn brighter,
[2:27:28] Jesse. Don't let the light burn low and
[2:27:31] get discouraged and speak evil or or get
[2:27:33] fearful or lustful or greedy.
[2:27:37] Be ready for the
[2:27:40] rapture. Lord, help us to have that
[2:27:42] still small voice. Yes. Always reminding
[2:27:45] us to make ourselves
[2:27:48] ready as a servant of you, Lord. says
[2:27:51] that you'll get we'll get to this
[2:27:52] parable later. Help me to serve the
[2:27:55] people the meat in due season and not to
[2:27:58] get drunk and beat them and mistreat
[2:28:00] them. Help me to feed them the word and
[2:28:03] food, the meat word for this
[2:28:06] hour. And as we eat, Lord, we'll watch
[2:28:08] and we'll look and say, "Is he coming
[2:28:11] now? Is our Lord coming
[2:28:14] back? Is he here yet?" Oh, we can't wait
[2:28:18] to see him.
[2:28:19] Oh, we'll see him in the air. We'll see
[2:28:22] him in a glorified body. Yes. And then
[2:28:25] we'll see our body be swallowed up,
[2:28:28] Lord, in the Oh my. And then put on its
[2:28:32] glorified and will rise to meet them in
[2:28:34] the
[2:28:35] air. What a meeting that will
[2:28:38] be. What a meeting that will
[2:28:41] be. How we're looking forward to it,
[2:28:43] dear God.
[2:28:45] Lord, service might have went a little
[2:28:46] bit late, God, but I believe it's worth
[2:28:49] it, Lord God, to every child of God to
[2:28:52] hear these things, Lord. I believe
[2:28:54] preached as clear as I could present
[2:28:56] them by the by the grace of the spirit
[2:28:58] of God. I'm doing my best, Lord
[2:29:00] God. Thank you for this
[2:29:03] word. But Lord, we don't teach it just
[2:29:06] to say we taught it or to have a head
[2:29:08] knowledge. We teach it so that we'll
[2:29:10] feel the urgency of the
[2:29:12] hour and we'll keep our lamp trimmed and
[2:29:16] we'll keep our fire burning bright
[2:29:18] knowing at any time you could
[2:29:20] come. But thank you Lord that we're
[2:29:22] saved from the wrath that's to come in
[2:29:24] the tribulation period. Thank you that
[2:29:26] you've not ordained us. I don't have an
[2:29:28] appointment with wrath. I've got
[2:29:30] appointment with salvation, with
[2:29:32] deliverance, with a body change. Yes.
[2:29:36] Thank you, dear God.
[2:29:40] How many would say, "Brother Jess, I'm
[2:29:41] raising my hand. Pray for me tonight
[2:29:42] that I'll be ready." Bless those hands,
[2:29:46] Lord. You see your children's hands.
[2:29:48] They defied gravity. And they said,
[2:29:50] "Lord, remember me, oh God, that'll be
[2:29:53] played back one day, Lord God, as all of
[2:29:55] our lives we played for rewards, Lord
[2:29:58] God.
[2:29:59] And it'll be witnessed on that day that
[2:30:01] that brother, that sister wanted prayer
[2:30:04] and desired to be right and you answered
[2:30:07] their request, dear God. Well, maybe
[2:30:10] others in other churches didn't raise
[2:30:12] their hands or didn't sincerely
[2:30:15] pray and had to go through the wrath of
[2:30:18] God. But Lord, thank you for grace
[2:30:20] tonight. I pray for your children as a
[2:30:24] priest unto God, a king and a priest as
[2:30:26] we all are, but as a priest, I pray for
[2:30:28] them. I pray, Lord, they'd pray for me,
[2:30:30] Lord God. That our lives would be
[2:30:34] right. That we live a godly life, Lord
[2:30:37] God. Be ready for this rapture. Convict
[2:30:40] us, Lord. Let that still small voice
[2:30:42] speak to your children tonight,
[2:30:43] tomorrow. Let it ever be with us, Lord.
[2:30:46] May it get more clear. May we be able to
[2:30:48] distinguish the voice more as time goes
[2:30:51] on.
[2:30:53] Grant, dear God, as we said, we believe
[2:30:56] you're
[2:30:57] coming in this season, Lord God. We know
[2:31:01] it's soon because we see Sodom rising up
[2:31:04] even stronger. We see the unity of the
[2:31:07] false church. Brother Ram said, the
[2:31:09] false bride of the Catholic Church,
[2:31:13] we see the churches uniting in politics
[2:31:15] going corrupt,
[2:31:17] but Lord, we see a purity happening in
[2:31:19] the bride, Lord God.
[2:31:21] Yes. Those without the garments are
[2:31:25] being told to leave. They're being
[2:31:27] dismissed. They went out from us because
[2:31:30] they're not of the bride. But Lord, the
[2:31:33] bride is staying with the gathering
[2:31:36] before the
[2:31:36] [Music]
[2:31:38] wedding. And Lord, we got our garments
[2:31:40] pure and white
[2:31:42] tonight. Thank you for your
[2:31:44] righteousness.
[2:31:45] Lord, guide us now as we go. Let us
[2:31:50] worship and receive our worship in Jesus
[2:31:52] Christ's name. The church said, "Amen."
[2:31:55] Let's just worship him a little bit. Why
[2:31:56] don't you just raise your hands or maybe
[2:31:57] bow your head and just thank him for
[2:31:58] your Lord Jesus, your your your love,
[2:32:01] Lord God. Thank you for your mercy,
[2:32:02] Jesus.
[2:32:05] Thank you, Lord, that you won't suffer
[2:32:07] us to go through wrath.
[2:32:09] You didn't let Enoch go through wrath.
[2:32:12] You didn't let Elijah go through wrath.
[2:32:15] You even saved Lord Noah and Lot, the
[2:32:19] foolish virgin.
[2:32:21] How much more will you save us
[2:32:24] bloodwashed, Holy Ghost fil, dear God,
[2:32:27] what a
[2:32:28] privilege. Thank you, God, for your
[2:32:30] mercy. Thank you for your grace tonight.
[2:32:34] Thank you, Jesus, for all you've done,
[2:32:36] Lord God. Keep us humble. keep us little
[2:32:39] that we can Lord be true lights and
[2:32:42] reflect your your
[2:32:44] [Music]
[2:32:48] light. Thank you for redeeming
[2:32:50] us. Let's sing a little song. I am
[2:32:52] redeemed. Bought with a price for Jesus
[2:32:55] has saved my whole life. Praise
[2:32:59] God. I am redeemed.
[2:33:04] I'm bought with a
[2:33:07] price for
[2:33:10] Jesus has changed my whole
[2:33:17] life. And if
[2:33:20] anybody asks
[2:33:22] you just who I
[2:33:26] am, just tell
[2:33:29] them I am redeemed.
[2:33:34] Sing it again. Praise God. I am
[2:33:39] redeemed. I'm born with a
[2:33:44] price for
[2:33:46] Jesus has changed my whole
[2:33:52] life. And if
[2:33:55] anybody asks
[2:33:58] you just who I am, just tell
[2:34:04] them I am redeemed. Sing it again.
[2:34:08] Praise God.
[2:34:11] I am
[2:34:14] redeemed. I'm born with a price.
[2:34:19] Lord
[2:34:20] Jesus has changed my whole
[2:34:24] [Applause]
[2:34:26] life. And if
[2:34:29] anybody asks
[2:34:31] you, just who I am,
[2:34:38] just I am redeemed.
[2:34:44] Praise God. Amen. Redeemed, bought back.
[2:34:48] Hallelujah. Brought back to my original
[2:34:50] position in Christ Jesus. Not to the
[2:34:53] vessels of dishonor, but the vessels of
[2:34:56] honor. Praise
[2:34:57] God. Let's sing a little song. A vessel
[2:35:02] of
[2:35:03] honor I am
[2:35:08] today. All because
[2:35:11] Jesus didn't throw the clay away.
[2:35:19] over and
[2:35:21] over. He molds me and makes
[2:35:26] me
[2:35:28] into his
[2:35:30] likeness. He
[2:35:32] fashions the
[2:35:35] clay, a
[2:35:37] vessel of
[2:35:39] honor I am today.
[2:35:45] Oh, because
[2:35:47] Jesus didn't throw the clay
[2:35:52] [Music]
[2:35:53] away. Over and
[2:35:57] over, he molds me and makes
[2:36:02] me into his likeness. His
[2:36:07] passions, the
[2:36:09] clay, a
[2:36:11] vessel of
[2:36:14] honor I am
[2:36:18] today. Oh, because
[2:36:22] Jesus didn't throw the clay
[2:36:26] away. Amen. Aren't you glad, church?
[2:36:29] Your vessel of honor. Christ is going to
[2:36:32] honor you because you honored him in
[2:36:34] life. If you don't deny him on earth, he
[2:36:37] won't deny you there.
[2:36:39] Amen. You're not ashamed of him here, he
[2:36:42] won't be ashamed to call you son or
[2:36:44] daughter there.
[2:36:46] Hallelujah.
[2:36:48] Amen. Hallelujah,
[2:36:52] [Music]
[2:36:54] church. I just want to show you this.
[2:36:56] Oh, it's okay. Okay. Thank you, brother.
[2:37:00] I just want to show this real quickly
[2:37:01] here.
[2:37:03] [Music]
[2:37:06] This is the quote we got where
[2:37:09] uh how the revelation of the seals came
[2:37:12] to brother
[2:37:13] Brandham. Start here and every quote
[2:37:16] starts with the first seal. He talks
[2:37:19] about how the vision was come to him
[2:37:20] every
[2:37:21] morning. Every day something strange
[2:37:23] happened. He would watch it and write
[2:37:24] down every single day of the seven seal
[2:37:27] time. I just went as I just listened, I
[2:37:30] just wrote down every time he said that
[2:37:32] or copied and paste it and it's
[2:37:34] beautiful. We can place it together
[2:37:35] maybe on Sunday or maybe next Wednesday.
[2:37:36] I don't know. But it's hard not to
[2:37:38] preach it tonight. You got another hour?
[2:37:39] I can preach it to you. No, I'm just
[2:37:41] kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm not going
[2:37:42] to preach it tonight.
[2:37:44] But to see this is how a prophet of God
[2:37:47] operated to reveal the word of God.
[2:37:51] We've got the message of the hour,
[2:37:52] church. There's no doubt about that.
[2:37:54] That's right. Now, our prayer is Lord,
[2:37:56] help us to live it. Amen.
[2:37:58] Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Thank God
[2:38:01] for his
[2:38:03] mercy. I want to get to that one
[2:38:09] here. Oh, I can't find
[2:38:14] it. I'll have to get it.
[2:38:16] But okay, I can't find it, but I I must
[2:38:19] have misplaced it. But there's a quote
[2:38:20] at the end of the second seal. He sp us
[2:38:23] back and he said, "Oh," he said, he
[2:38:24] said, "That's thus sayeth the Lord."
[2:38:26] Right? Same thing except after marriage
[2:38:27] and divorce. Thus sayeth the Lord. Now,
[2:38:30] who have you ever heard say that before,
[2:38:31] church, no preacher I've ever heard has
[2:38:33] said that except brother Brandham.
[2:38:36] And no other man's had a gift like him
[2:38:37] or vindicated like him that I know of.
[2:38:41] We're serving the living God and we're
[2:38:43] believing his prophet, church. We are.
[2:38:47] We are believing the prophet of this
[2:38:49] day. Praise the Lord. No doubt about
[2:38:51] that. We'll get to that by God's
[2:38:54] grace. Amen. So, Brother John, we can
[2:38:56] click over there. Let's just have a word
[2:38:57] of prayer. We'll be dismissed here. If
[2:38:59] you want to stay and pray, you can. Uh,
[2:39:01] just watch your email. Once I find out
[2:39:04] uh when this next appointment of of the
[2:39:06] seven-year-old girl with cancer, I might
[2:39:08] send out an email and say, "Can you fast
[2:39:09] and pray like maybe two meals or
[2:39:11] something or all day or whatever you can
[2:39:13] do." I really feel like if we fast and
[2:39:16] pray, the God of mercy will help this
[2:39:18] little child.
[2:39:20] I just believe that if we all just let
[2:39:23] me say this, I'm hoping that Amen. I'm
[2:39:26] not a prophet. I don't have to say the
[2:39:27] Lord, but I'm hoping God will hear the
[2:39:29] prayers of his children.
[2:39:31] Praise
[2:39:32] God. Amen. Let's sing one more song here
[2:39:34] by God's
[2:39:37] grace. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord
[2:39:39] God. Thank you, Father God. Trying to
[2:39:41] think of a rapture song there. Nice and
[2:39:43] slow one
[2:39:45] here. It won't be long. Let's sing that
[2:39:47] prayer there. It won't be long till
[2:39:49] we'll be leaving
[2:39:52] here. It won't be
[2:39:59] long till we'll be
[2:40:04] leaving.
[2:40:06] 374. It won't be
[2:40:13] long and we'll be going home.
[2:40:18] Sing that verse again. Amen. Oh, it
[2:40:21] won't be
[2:40:27] long till we'll be
[2:40:30] leaving
[2:40:34] here. It won't be
[2:40:39] long. And we'll be going home.
[2:40:44] Count the
[2:40:46] years. So count the years as
[2:40:50] months as
[2:40:52] months. Count the months as
[2:40:56] weeks as weeks. And count the weeks as
[2:41:01] days. Any day
[2:41:04] now we'll be going
[2:41:07] home. Is that beautiful? Oh, it won't be
[2:41:12] long.
[2:41:16] Oh, till we'll be leaving
[2:41:22] here. It won't be
[2:41:27] long till we'll be going
[2:41:31] home. Count the years. So, count the
[2:41:34] years as
[2:41:38] months. Count the months as weeks.
[2:41:41] Glory. Thank you, Jesus. Count the weeks
[2:41:46] as days. Any day
[2:41:49] now we'll be going home. Count the
[2:41:54] years. So count the years as
[2:42:00] months. Count the months as
[2:42:05] weeks. Count the weeks as days. Any day
[2:42:10] now we'll be going home. It won't be
[2:42:15] long. Oh, it won't be
