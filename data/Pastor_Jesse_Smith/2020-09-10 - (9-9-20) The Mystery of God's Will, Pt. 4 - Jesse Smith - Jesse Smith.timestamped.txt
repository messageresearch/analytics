[18:20] [Music]
[18:50] jesus christ
[19:02] glad we have uh righteousness
[19:06] imputed to us praise god i'm sure your
[19:09] life and my life
[19:10] has seen victories this week but i'm
[19:12] sure we've all fallen short of the glory
[19:13] of god
[19:15] so that makes the righteousness of
[19:16] christ that much sweeter praise god
[19:19] so let's uh have a few uh
[19:22] prayer requests here i'm sorry it's so
[19:24] hot
[19:25] uh we were asked to move out some of the
[19:28] things in the furnace room as you
[19:29] probably saw
[19:30] they're supposed to work on the furnace
[19:32] and air conditioning unit tomorrow and
[19:33] friday so hopefully
[19:35] we're back to like regular american
[19:37] weather
[19:39] regular american uh temperatures on
[19:42] sunday hopefully
[19:43] i'm not promising um but you know this
[19:45] is i saw the temperature i think it was
[19:47] 80 degrees in here so
[19:49] it's a little bit warmer but not bad
[19:51] compared to places i've preached i'm
[19:53] sure
[19:54] our friends from ghana have had a lot
[19:57] hotter weather than that
[19:59] um but anyways we're thankful for god's
[20:02] grace we're thankful we don't have to
[20:03] pay for that you know
[20:04] but we're thankful for very good
[20:05] landlords um also just a few more
[20:08] announcements uh you probably saw we'll
[20:10] do a few testimonies on sunday
[20:12] and i would like to do the lord's supper
[20:13] on sunday so um
[20:16] i'll try to shorten the sermon i'll try
[20:18] to preach about 45 minutes it's been
[20:19] going good by god's space
[20:22] one thing i want to share with amen had
[20:23] a question for me um if you can't make
[20:25] the 4pm service and you like to do
[20:27] communion after the first service i can
[20:29] do that
[20:30] we've done that before when people have
[20:32] you know responsibilities or something
[20:34] um and it would just look like i just
[20:36] dismissed service everybody would leave
[20:38] except the people that
[20:39] i would minister communion to so we're
[20:41] happy to do that
[20:42] we've done that before it's been a
[20:44] number of years but
[20:46] just so you know i just you know when i
[20:48] was worshiping sunday uh sunday night
[20:50] after service i just was kneeling down
[20:51] here and
[20:52] i just looked over and i just in my mind
[20:55] i thought well where's the bread and the
[20:56] wine that we should have some communion
[20:58] i thought my it's been too long
[21:00] it's time to have the lord's communion
[21:02] so let's have fellowship
[21:04] sunday lord willing with communion also
[21:06] just a testimony my sister
[21:08] uh sent my or sent me a text and said my
[21:11] dad is almost back to normal
[21:12] let's thank the lord for that praise god
[21:18] praise god and
[21:21] so there's been lots of prayers for my
[21:24] dad i thank you
[21:25] very much for the prayers um and let's
[21:28] pray for his salvation praise god
[21:30] i'm sure if you know any of you have any
[21:32] grandparents or parents that aren't
[21:33] saved how you long
[21:35] for them and pray for them to be saved
[21:37] let's continue to pray for the healing
[21:39] of the soul
[21:41] um okay so now let's get into a few
[21:43] prayer requests quite a few
[21:45] but the amen said his work atmosphere
[21:47] needs prayer
[21:48] let's pray for that praise god also i'm

[22:02] spirit will help me
[22:04] and i'll yield to the holy spirit
[22:07] also brother jose's son-in-law and
[22:10] daughter
[22:11] did test positive for coronavirus
[22:14] so let's pray for them jose said he was
[22:16] tested but he's a negative
[22:18] so i still asked him to quarantine you
[22:20] know to stay
[22:21] stayed home for a little while at least
[22:23] until he can quarantine

[27:00] look at tonight
[27:03] pardon me i don't even know if i picked
[27:04] out a text
[27:07] so let's just go to the first one here i
[27:08] think we'll go to uh
[27:12] we'll just go the first one let's go to
[27:14] james15
[27:16] james15 and then we'll read our memory
[27:18] verse
[27:32] hallelujah
[27:45] i'll worship him forever and i love him
[27:47] forever
[27:48] because he's so good
[27:52] james 1 5 let's read this here together
[27:56] we like to look at the mystery of god's
[27:58] will i believe it's part 4 tonight
[28:03] this chapter ends with just practical
[28:06] ways to know you're in the perfect will
[28:07] of god
[28:09] and that's what we desire paul said you
[28:12] can have it if you have a transformed
[28:14] mind
[28:14] and you present your body a living
[28:16] sacrifice
[28:18] lady can you check who honked out there
[28:19] can you see maokai can you check real
[28:21] quick
[28:21] both of you just in case i don't know
[28:23] just nice to know if anybody
[28:25] coming around we got little kids walking
[28:27] the hallway
[28:31] so let's read our scripture james 1 5.
[28:41] let's read that together on three one
[28:43] two three
[28:44] if any of you lack wisdom let him
[28:47] ask of god that giveth to all men
[28:50] liberally
[28:51] and upbraideth not and it shall be given
[28:55] him isn't that a beautiful promise god
[28:58] his wisdom flows out
[28:59] liberally that means like it just flows
[29:01] freely so when you ask god for
[29:03] understanding and how to
[29:04] arrange your life it's like he just
[29:06] pours it out from heaven praise god
[29:09] that's a it's a comforting thought to
[29:10] know right you don't have to you know we
[29:13] don't have to struggle all the time for
[29:14] wisdom or
[29:16] we uh we have to walk in foolishness god
[29:18] doesn't act like that
[29:20] if people want to know the decisions god
[29:22] makes it known praise god
[29:24] what a blessing now go to uh matthew 6
[29:26] let's do our memory verse here tonight
[29:32] i guess we're just kind of taking over
[29:34] the august mary verse right into
[29:35] september i
[29:36] didn't realize that so just now so
[29:39] praise the lord
[29:40] it's worth it i wonder who'd be next
[29:42] though
[29:45] after stephen i think he would be the
[29:48] most recent
[29:49] saint in our church
[29:56] matthew 6 30.
[30:05] what a promise praise god let's read 30
[30:07] down to 34. let's read that on three
[30:09] one two three wherefore if god so
[30:13] clothed the grass of the field which
[30:16] today
[30:16] is and tomorrow is cast into the oven
[30:20] shall he not much more clothe you o ye
[30:24] of little faith therefore take no
[30:26] thought
[30:27] saying what shall we eat or what shall
[30:30] we drink
[30:31] or wherewith all shall we be clothed for
[30:34] after all these things do the gentiles
[30:36] seek
[30:37] for your heavenly father knoweth that ye
[30:39] have need of
[30:40] all these things but seek ye first the
[30:43] kingdom of god
[30:44] and his righteousness and all these
[30:47] things shall be added unto you
[30:49] take therefore no thought for the morrow
[30:52] for the morrow shall
[30:53] take thought for the things of itself
[30:55] sufficient unto the day
[30:57] is the evil thereof may god add his
[30:59] blessings the ring of his word may be
[31:00] seated praise god
[31:06] [Applause]
[31:13] okay so let's set a timer here we'll try
[31:14] to do about 40 minutes by god's grace
[31:19] all right so uh let's look for god's
[31:22] will
[31:23] i'm gonna believe god's will is a is a
[31:26] pretty simple thing to find
[31:28] i do i believe that by god's grace
[31:32] if god is going to be a fair judge he's
[31:34] got to give everybody an equal chance
[31:36] right to know his will
[31:38] find it and then obey it has to be so
[31:40] simple
[31:41] that god would uh for those who accept
[31:43] it god would honor them and give them
[31:45] rewards but for those who would reject
[31:47] it
[31:48] they would have to burn and be tormented
[31:50] for
[31:51] many many many uh years we don't know
[31:54] how long
[31:55] but it has to be such a simple thing and
[31:57] i'm glad god reveals it to us praise god
[32:00] what a uh what encouragement to know
[32:03] now let's look right here we finished uh
[32:05] when or sunday night with
[32:07] how to know god's perfect will
[32:10] present your body so consecrate your
[32:13] body
[32:14] uh consecrate your body set aside your
[32:18] body so
[32:20] it's in a holy condition right and then
[32:23] renew your mind just feed all
[32:26] think on the word of god anything that's
[32:28] pure good holy
[32:30] fill the mind with the word of god and
[32:32] then you'll be able to prove the perfect
[32:34] will of god amen
[32:36] now let's go through how you can know
[32:37] god's perfect will for your
[32:39] relationships
[32:40] uh your job and where you live
[32:43] ministries and then the gifts of the
[32:44] holy spirit i don't imagine we'll get to
[32:46] the gifts of the holy spirit tonight
[32:48] um but i'd like to get to those maybe
[32:49] sunday by god's grace
[32:53] okay now if you consecrate your body
[32:56] and renew your mind you can know god's
[32:59] perfect will
[33:00] what a blessing you don't have to guess
[33:03] is this the right job for me
[33:06] uh who do i marry where's my home church
[33:09] you church we don't have to guess we can
[33:12] know what god wants for our lives
[33:15] that's quite that's quite a wonderful
[33:17] blessing
[33:18] uh and that's why so many people the
[33:20] bible calls them how many know the bible
[33:22] calls them wondering stars
[33:24] sinners are called wandering stars and
[33:26] they are reprobates too
[33:27] they wander from here to there they
[33:30] can't find
[33:31] a place of rest praise god amen it's a
[33:35] good sign that your soul is at rest
[33:37] when your physical location is at rest
[33:40] as well praise god
[33:41] amen it's a true blessing to be able to
[33:44] know that remember you can do
[33:46] you must do all the known will first as
[33:49] you're waiting for god to show you about
[33:51] relationships
[33:52] do everything that you know in the will
[33:54] of god first
[33:55] in the scripture and then wait for the
[33:57] season
[33:58] now waiting is the hard part but we know
[34:01] if we wait upon the lord we'll only get
[34:03] stronger praise god
[34:04] we'll renew our strength hallelujah
[34:07] that's what the scripture says how many
[34:08] are witness to that
[34:09] you've waited on god it might have been
[34:11] hard might have been difficult
[34:13] but your strength was renewed once the
[34:15] prayer was answered praise god
[34:18] hallelujah now let's look at
[34:20] relationships if you've got your bible
[34:21] go to first corinthians 7
[34:23] i'm going to uh ask
[34:27] lydia to switch over i just want to show
[34:31] a little quote
[34:32] it's a confusing quote i'm sorry to some
[34:35] not to the real
[34:36] saint of god who waits on the lord but
[34:40] uh i'll read this in just a moment not
[34:42] yet but let me look at the scripture
[34:43] first corinthians 7 about relationships
[34:46] in fact most of this chapter
[34:48] covers about every single person on
[34:50] earth
[34:52] you're either single married
[34:55] uh yeah you're either singled or married
[34:57] or
[34:58] separated uh so or divorced so
[35:01] it covers about everyone
[35:04] and i love how the previous chapter
[35:06] showed if you were
[35:07] guilty of let's say adultery or
[35:09] something or fornication even
[35:11] homosexuality
[35:12] you can be washed by the blood of jesus
[35:14] christ amen
[35:16] it's such a powerful powerful chapter
[35:18] now
[35:19] uh paul in this chapter um
[35:22] first corinthians seven sorry i'm in
[35:24] romans seven my fault first corinthians
[35:26] seven
[35:27] i want to bring out a few things here
[35:28] that may be uh
[35:31] strange maybe to some
[35:35] uh maybe you don't do it but i'm in
[35:37] constant uh
[35:38] i'm constantly looking at you know the
[35:40] people who worship brother branham
[35:42] you know their websites and i'm looking
[35:44] at the people that despise brother
[35:46] branham that left brother man's message
[35:47] i'm constantly looking at those because
[35:49] it sharpens me
[35:50] i'm able to see where they getting off
[35:53] where are they getting wrong remember
[35:54] the bible said mark those
[35:55] who cause division so i'm doing my duty
[35:58] it may not be your duty and that's fine
[36:00] uh i'm not i'm not saying that at all
[36:03] what i'm saying is i know it's my duty
[36:04] to rightly divide the word
[36:06] so i get a lot of i get a lot of
[36:08] strength actually by looking at the
[36:10] wrong
[36:10] because it points me back to the truth
[36:12] praise god
[36:14] or it confirms what i what god has
[36:16] already showed me in his word as the
[36:18] truth
[36:18] so i constantly look at that and of
[36:20] course listening to brother branham and
[36:22] listening to
[36:22] message preachers i just try to give it
[36:25] equal time
[36:26] how many other how many know you're
[36:27] constantly trying to find balance in
[36:28] your life
[36:29] right you'll get feel like you're caught
[36:32] up on prayer but then your sermon
[36:33] listening goes down
[36:35] and then your bible reading is maybe
[36:36] really good but then your prayer needs
[36:38] to back
[36:38] up right we are constantly looking for a
[36:42] balance in our lives
[36:44] right but the main thing seek ye first
[36:46] the kingdom of god if you can just get
[36:47] the first thing right amen
[36:50] you can get that first thing right
[36:52] ultimately uh it'll go back
[36:54] to nice a nice equilibrium praise god or
[36:56] a nice area of balance
[36:59] if you can just seek the the kingdom of
[37:01] god first
[37:02] i think you understand what i'm saying
[37:03] praise god
[37:06] now paul addresses the single at the
[37:09] beginning
[37:10] uh if a man is burning with passion
[37:13] he should be married okay
[37:17] uh the bible calls it uh burning
[37:22] yes it's verse nine yes therefore if
[37:25] they cannot contain let them marry for
[37:27] it's better to marry
[37:28] than to burn okay now actually verses
[37:32] three
[37:33] through uh seven deal with married
[37:36] couples how
[37:37] they should constantly stay in uh
[37:39] fellowship
[37:40] through the married bed i'll just say it
[37:42] like that generally
[37:43] speaking they should not defraud one
[37:45] another
[37:47] right unless they're gonna fast for a
[37:49] season
[37:51] and paul speaks this by permission
[37:54] and then he says by i'm sorry he said by
[37:56] permission he says i wish
[37:57] men were like me that had the gift of
[38:00] being single
[38:03] and so with your relationship first uh
[38:06] find where you are praise god paul
[38:09] addresses those who are
[38:11] virgins or unmarried and the married and
[38:14] even the
[38:14] those that are separated he addresses it
[38:17] in this
[38:17] entire chapter so we have single people
[38:20] in our church right we have young people
[38:21] that are growing up and
[38:22] uh we'll be single adults uh if the lord
[38:25] tarries
[38:27] uh first they need to if you're single
[38:29] they need to pray and find out if they
[38:31] have the gift to be single
[38:34] right because if god reveals they have
[38:37] the gift to be single then they don't
[38:38] have
[38:38] they can deal with that issue right and
[38:40] they can pray through and
[38:42] have victory in that issue right because
[38:45] that's what paul says in verse
[38:47] seven it's a proper gift the bible says
[38:50] to be single
[38:53] now you don't find a whole lot of people
[38:54] like that right but the bible does say
[38:57] it is a
[38:57] proper gift because
[39:01] marriage is the second uh most important
[39:03] decision you'll ever make in your life
[39:05] praise god
[39:06] so you do it uh the bible says uh you do
[39:09] it in the fear of the lord praise god
[39:12] now the scripture uh says as we read
[39:16] james 1 5 if you need god's wisdom
[39:19] ask him for it amen amen just like you
[39:22] would your father your mother when
[39:23] when you have a need you just ask and
[39:26] believe
[39:27] and the bible said god gives it out
[39:29] generously praise god
[39:32] i'm sure we've all been in that
[39:33] situation we asked for information we
[39:35] get more than what we
[39:36] asked for right we look probably a
[39:39] little embarrassed when we do when that
[39:40] happens to us
[39:41] but god is like that god is so kind and
[39:44] generous
[39:45] uh that god if we ask him he'll pour it
[39:48] out abundantly praise god
[39:50] he'll just keep pouring it out all the
[39:52] wisdom maybe it's a whole lot it's an
[39:54] hour long sermon maybe it's a two-hour
[39:55] long sermon
[39:56] maybe it's a brother random three-hour
[39:58] sermon and the wisdom of god is poured
[40:00] out from heaven praise god
[40:02] in that sermon it comes liberally praise
[40:06] god
[40:06] and so when we ask we we must expect to
[40:09] receive
[40:10] praise god now it's first important to
[40:13] know
[40:13] before we get in this chapter a little
[40:14] bit that vows are a very serious thing
[40:17] and most of us weren't raised that way
[40:18] unless you were raising the message
[40:20] i never learned that till i came to the
[40:21] message when someone makes a vow or an
[40:24] engagement it's a very serious thing
[40:26] now personally i don't believe god holds
[40:28] it against someone if they make of
[40:30] engagement and they break it if they
[40:31] didn't know about it
[40:33] okay let's say if they were in the world
[40:35] uh because i know people like that they
[40:37] were
[40:38] in the world had engagement broke off
[40:41] uh but then came in the message i
[40:43] believe god forgives that
[40:46] because i believe god is rich in mercy
[40:48] now some people would
[40:49] call me a heretic for that but we have
[40:51] to understand it's a different age
[40:53] praise god it's not
[40:54] most people today aren't raised with
[40:56] that kind of understanding
[40:58] and you'd be surprised you know some
[40:59] people do believe that that
[41:02] even if they didn't know better they
[41:04] can't marry again
[41:06] i think that's a wrong thing now it's
[41:08] different if they're married
[41:10] if they're officially married they go
[41:12] through the marriage act and
[41:13] and they live married and then divorce
[41:15] that's different
[41:17] because they uh they had they they made
[41:19] the vows publicly
[41:21] to me that's different they lived in the
[41:23] marriage
[41:24] relationship and they actually live with
[41:27] the individual
[41:28] i believe that's different i believe
[41:29] then at that point they
[41:31] are uh bound to that person as long
[41:35] as they shall live praise god now
[41:38] remember the vow is important because
[41:39] matthew 1 18-20
[41:42] god or the angel recognized joseph's vow
[41:45] to mary
[41:46] and said fear not to take mary thy wife
[41:48] and they weren't even married yet
[41:50] so we know god takes it seriously the
[41:53] power of the vow is taught in numbers
[41:55] 30.
[41:56] now just for your sake by the amen and
[41:58] sister who if you haven't heard this
[41:59] before
[42:00] numbers 30 gives all kinds of details
[42:02] about vows
[42:03] and uh just generally speaking a lot of
[42:06] message people go
[42:07] go back to that book on how to deal with
[42:10] vows
[42:11] i think that's a wise thing to do but i
[42:13] don't believe it's as strict as numbers
[42:15] 30
[42:16] says it is number 30 is pretty strict i
[42:19] mean there's a lot of wisdom in there
[42:20] and i would have to take a whole another
[42:22] sermon just to preach on that chapter
[42:24] but i believe it is a good thing to
[42:25] recognize that every woman
[42:27] is under the headship of her dad right
[42:30] until she's married i do believe that's
[42:31] an obvious
[42:32] scriptural teaching i think people can
[42:35] see that
[42:36] because the bible talks about a married
[42:37] woman if she cuts her hair
[42:39] she dishonors her head and her head is
[42:42] her husband
[42:43] and if it dishonors her husband then it
[42:45] dishonors christ then it dishonors
[42:47] almighty god the invisible spirit all
[42:50] right
[42:50] so that's just a brief thing about
[42:52] engagements
[42:57] now first of all or next if you are
[42:59] single
[43:00] but you're living with somebody and
[43:01] committing sexual sin you know you're
[43:04] clearly out of god's will because the
[43:06] bible says it's god's will
[43:07] to avoid fornication it's totally god's
[43:10] will so uh
[43:12] we've seen this in the message brother
[43:14] and sister people that were
[43:16] fornicating right not married they come
[43:18] into the message and they
[43:19] automatically think they should get
[43:20] married they shouldn't do that
[43:22] without prayer because i i've seen it
[43:25] myself
[43:26] i i know i've seen it myself when we
[43:28] first came in there was people that were
[43:30] living in fornication they thought well
[43:31] we better get
[43:32] married and they didn't even pray about
[43:34] it and later on the man would abuse the
[43:36] wife
[43:37] and it destroyed homes and divorces and
[43:40] now it's led to adultery
[43:43] what they should have done is repented
[43:46] of their sins
[43:47] stop fornicating now see they just got
[43:49] married so they could continue having
[43:51] relations
[43:52] without knowing if it was god's will or
[43:54] not does everybody understand
[43:57] now it's different now there's a there's
[43:59] a difference there too if they if they
[44:01] knew the message
[44:01] and they after they knew the message
[44:03] they made the vows that's different and
[44:05] that just shows they
[44:06] never really prayed about it if the
[44:08] marriage goes astray
[44:09] but the bible says what god has joined
[44:12] together amen
[44:13] amen that's the thing we got to let god
[44:15] join husbands and wives together
[44:17] praise god amen amen so i just want to
[44:20] say that you know for those in our
[44:22] congregation and
[44:23] uh maybe those learning that don't have
[44:25] a home church listening
[44:27] if if someone's in fornication and they
[44:30] hear the message that doesn't mean they
[44:32] should automatically marry
[44:33] unless god has revealed to them that
[44:36] that's the person there to marry
[44:38] okay so i hope that's understandable
[44:41] please if there's any questions about
[44:42] these subjects please let me know
[44:43] because they're
[44:44] they are of the utmost importance praise
[44:46] god marriage and divorce and
[44:48] where you uh work where you go to church
[44:50] these things are very important
[44:53] all right um now if you
[44:57] if they come to the message while mary
[44:59] the bible says stay in the marriage
[45:01] now there's a lot of evil doctrines out
[45:03] there one's called two souls
[45:05] where they let people that were married
[45:07] before the message
[45:08] they come in they let them divorce their
[45:11] previous wife because that their soul
[45:13] wasn't converted yet
[45:14] and now they have a new soul that's a
[45:16] bunch of trash
[45:18] that's a bunch of nonsense right that's
[45:20] tommy rot we'd say
[45:22] because they're already married they're
[45:23] already living they got a family they
[45:24] made a vow
[45:25] in front of everybody probably in a
[45:27] church but see
[45:29] men do that in the message because
[45:30] they're not born again and they never
[45:32] love their wife to begin with
[45:34] and that shows they never had divine
[45:36] love because god's love is
[45:38] love for your wife praise god that's
[45:40] going to make you love your wife
[45:41] until death praise god it's going to
[45:43] make you make you love your husband to
[45:45] death as well
[45:46] praise god the love of god
[45:51] and so see it's a sad sad thing now
[45:53] let's go to the scripture
[45:58] look at verse 10 first corinthians 7 10
[46:00] leave that up there i don't know why my
[46:01] phone keeps
[46:02] sleeping so fast uh verse 10 and unto
[46:05] the married i command
[46:07] yet not i but the lord let not the wife
[46:09] depart from her husband but and if she
[46:11] departs so see
[46:12] there's times women may leave their
[46:14] husbands because of
[46:16] child abuse or themselves being abused
[46:19] or other situations right sisters do not
[46:22] have to stay in situations and be abused
[46:25] they don't have to they can flee right
[46:28] just like the christians
[46:29] in jerusalem they fled persecution in
[46:32] rome
[46:33] like it's the same idea uh
[46:36] god doesn't want people many times to be
[46:38] abused on purpose
[46:42] okay so just uh let that be known
[46:44] because uh the
[46:45] when problems come in the message in any
[46:48] church any church that tries to
[46:49] establish
[46:50] man over woman which that's bible right
[46:53] and it happens in our
[46:54] denominations i've seen it too where men
[46:57] abuse their wives because why there's to
[46:59] submit to everything
[47:01] and they say see you got to submit to my
[47:02] abuse because you must submit to
[47:04] everything
[47:05] that's from the devil that's a lie from
[47:07] hell
[47:08] that's a lie god doesn't want that to
[47:11] happen
[47:13] that's the that's a demonic spirit not
[47:14] the holy spirit the holy spirit loves
[47:17] and forgives and is patient
[47:18] it's got temperance praise god amen well
[47:21] before it has the holy ghost it's got
[47:23] temperance to control the body amen
[47:26] and control the temper and to clean you
[47:28] out of your temper praise god that's
[47:30] what it's to do
[47:32] now look at verse 11 but if but and if
[47:35] she depart let her remain
[47:36] unmarried see or be reconciled to your
[47:38] husband so see whenever there's a
[47:40] physical separation like my parents
[47:42] they got divorced but they never
[47:43] remarried so they could potentially get
[47:45] back together
[47:46] that's what i'm praying for that's what
[47:48] we're praying for tonight we'll pray for
[47:49] that at the end
[47:50] i want to pray for all the parents at
[47:51] the end of the service here all of our
[47:53] parents or grandparents or unsaved loved
[47:54] ones
[47:56] see that's that's the only option if
[47:59] they divorce
[47:59] they can not remarry except the one
[48:02] cause and that was unconfessed
[48:03] fornication
[48:04] before a couple was married because the
[48:06] vow
[48:08] was a false vow it wasn't made in
[48:11] sincerity
[48:12] and so god doesn't jesus doesn't hold
[48:13] that one against a man
[48:15] if his wife lied to him and wasn't pure
[48:19] and lied about it then the vow wasn't
[48:22] real
[48:22] right it wasn't genuine and so jesus
[48:24] will allow a man to put that woman away
[48:27] and marry another but only in the lord
[48:30] now that's so rare church that's so rare
[48:33] so in most cases
[48:34] the person that's married has to remain
[48:36] married till death
[48:38] praise god in most cases even adultery
[48:41] even adultery doesn't allow a man or
[48:43] woman to divorce and remarry not even
[48:45] adultery
[48:47] only fornication because jesus said
[48:49] saving for the cause of fornication
[48:52] the fornication is before marriage not
[48:54] earn
[48:56] okay
[49:00] okay now let's finish verse 11 and let
[49:01] not the husband put away his wife
[49:04] but to the rest speak i not the lord
[49:06] okay so now this is
[49:07] paul if any brother hath the wife that
[49:10] believeth not and she be pleased to
[49:11] dwell with him
[49:12] let him not put her away and the woman
[49:14] which hath and husband that believeth
[49:16] not and if he be pleased or dwell with
[49:17] her let
[49:18] her not leave him for the unbelieving
[49:20] husband is sanctified by the wife and
[49:22] the unbelieving wife
[49:23] is sanctified by the husband else were
[49:25] your children unclean but now
[49:27] are they holy praise god amen look at
[49:30] that paul said
[49:31] try not to separate he said this is my
[49:32] opinion a holy ghost-filled saint
[49:34] even if their spouse uh isn't
[49:38] in the message or isn't a real holy
[49:40] ghost-filled believer
[49:41] their life will influence their spouse's
[49:44] life amen
[49:45] you can't help it right why because
[49:47] light is shining against darkness praise
[49:49] god
[49:50] and it has to have an effect hallelujah
[49:52] light has to have an effect on darkness
[49:54] amen and they said see that makes your
[49:56] children holy too
[49:58] in other words sanctified or set apart
[50:00] because of one holy person the home
[50:02] it keeps the children from a sinful a
[50:05] more sinful life
[50:07] doesn't mean they're saved it means well
[50:09] i guess they would be saved until the
[50:11] the age of accountability whenever that
[50:12] is
[50:13] the mormons say it's 12 or i think what
[50:14] is it nine now they keep changing it
[50:17] one time i talked to them they said it
[50:18] was twelve and the next time it was nine
[50:20] well which one is it how can it change
[50:23] how can god change
[50:25] only god knows that praise god and so
[50:28] see
[50:29] paul is saying remain because your life
[50:32] will have an
[50:32] influence on someone else praise god now
[50:35] verse
[50:36] 15 is well misunderstood by many people
[50:39] but if the unbelieving depart let him
[50:40] depart
[50:41] a brother or sister is not under bondage
[50:43] in such cases
[50:45] but god hath called us to peace
[50:49] now some people a lot of churches not in
[50:51] the message but
[50:52] a lot of denominationals say see you're
[50:54] not under bondage if you depart which
[50:56] means you don't have to remain
[50:58] married and you can remarry that's not
[51:00] what it means because that would
[51:02] contradict
[51:02] verse 11 which says either be me
[51:06] unmarried or reconciled see that
[51:10] you can't have verse 15 contradict 11.
[51:13] they all have to make sense and that has
[51:15] to line up with matthew 5 where jesus
[51:17] said only one cause for
[51:18] remarriage and matthew 19 where jesus
[51:20] said take it back to the beginning
[51:22] praise god go back to adam and eve with
[51:24] relationships
[51:25] praise god see there is no contradiction
[51:28] in the word of god look at verse 17 but
[51:30] as god hath distributed to every man
[51:32] as the lord hath called everyone so let
[51:34] him walk and so ordain i
[51:36] in all the churches
[51:39] there's testimonies all around the
[51:41] message even up north uh the churches we
[51:43] used to attend
[51:44] where one person was saving the message
[51:46] and the other one wasn't but they kept
[51:48] praying for years
[51:50] and years and years and finally the
[51:52] other one came in praise god
[51:54] amen see god because the bible said god
[51:57] called them praise god god called him in
[52:00] that condition
[52:01] see god's trying to get a testimony
[52:03] god's trying to build a character
[52:05] god's trying to make you like christ
[52:06] amen amen a soul winner amen
[52:09] an influencer a living tabernacle of the
[52:12] living god amen
[52:14] he's trying to make you that he's trying
[52:16] to make all of us that
[52:20] recently brother there's a good
[52:21] testimony sister um there's a brother
[52:23] named herb
[52:24] up at a sheffield okay he he and his
[52:27] wife came in the message
[52:29] but their children were old enough they
[52:31] walked away from it
[52:32] brother amen he sat in that pew i
[52:34] remember him he died this year actually
[52:36] a corona virus i think he died
[52:37] or maybe it was a combination of
[52:39] something i remember but he passed away
[52:40] in
[52:40] uh march well two years ago brother
[52:45] before he died his daughter came down
[52:48] with cancer
[52:49] the cancer and she's in her 60s now the
[52:52] cancer drove her to the message
[52:54] she repented she let her hair grow god
[52:57] healed her of cancer
[52:58] and the last time i preached here last
[52:59] time went up there i got the fellowship
[53:01] with her
[53:01] and she told me the whole testimony and
[53:04] it was like what
[53:05] 50 years she was on the message while
[53:07] the parents they just sat there amen
[53:09] service after service they just said
[53:11] amen amen
[53:13] amen and they applied the token and god
[53:17] drove those those children god drove
[53:20] them to his presence
[53:21] god saved them god rewards faithfulness
[53:24] amen
[53:24] amen i wish you could tell her testimony
[53:33] that was so refreshing that was so
[53:34] encouraging to hear wow god will use
[53:36] anything
[53:37] god hears those humble simple prayers he
[53:40] was just a hunter out in the woods i
[53:41] mean that's what he would do he just go
[53:42] hunting that's how
[53:43] he was old and retired and he just go
[53:45] hunting but he kept praying
[53:47] so faithful to god's house so faithful
[53:50] and two years before he dies
[53:52] god lets him see the glory of healing
[53:54] cancer amen
[53:55] and even the greater glory of his
[53:57] daughter being saved
[53:59] sanctified and filled with the holy
[54:00] ghost praise god
[54:02] no greater healing than that praise god
[54:05] amen
[54:06] so see god has called you to a certain
[54:09] testimony
[54:10] right and we must be faithful in the
[54:13] testimony that's called us
[54:15] now here's a quote a lot of people
[54:16] stumble at but this is i notice 1956
[54:20] about marriage and divorce let me tell
[54:21] you something a lot of you women tonight
[54:23] would have an awful time doing that
[54:24] talking about
[54:25] you know how the sinner washed jesus
[54:28] feet with her hair
[54:30] you'd have to stand on your head to do
[54:31] it shame on you the bible said
[54:33] the hair is given to the woman for her
[54:35] glory that's such a perfect line
[54:38] she'd have to stand on her head well
[54:39] then she'd be a modest right
[54:43] and the bible now look this is where
[54:46] people stumble
[54:47] the bible writes gives a man a right to
[54:49] leave and divorce
[54:50] and leave his wife that'll cut her hair
[54:52] that's the bible that's thus saith the
[54:54] lord
[54:55] too bad you got away from the old
[54:58] fashioned trainings isn't it
[55:01] now this quote stumbles a lot of people
[55:03] but not me
[55:05] because the bible says if they depart
[55:07] let them depart
[55:11] now the bible says if a woman cuts her
[55:14] hair it's a shame to her husband how
[55:16] many know that
[55:18] can a man put away his wife for cutting
[55:21] your hair
[55:22] yes but my question is what kind of a
[55:24] man would do that
[55:28] and this is what i wrote somebody
[55:29] emailed me about that this last week and
[55:31] i said
[55:32] sir i said have you ever brought shame
[55:35] upon your wife
[55:36] by disrespecting her out in the church
[55:38] parking lot
[55:39] how many brothers do that think about
[55:42] that
[55:42] she cut her hair which is a shame it is
[55:44] an awful shame right to get there
[55:46] but how many times what if that man has
[55:49] shamed his wife in front of the kids
[55:53] you ever think about that so my question
[55:57] is what kind of a man would want to do
[55:59] that
[56:00] now people in the message now i've i've
[56:03] never met any well i'm sorry
[56:04] i did i'm sorry i didn't meet them but i
[56:06] knew they're from the state of maine
[56:08] there were some message people that used
[56:09] this uh and the pastor was so corrupt
[56:13] he urged his wife to cut her hair in
[56:15] order to divorce her so he can marry
[56:16] another woman in the church
[56:17] that was hap that happened in this
[56:19] country uh probably 15 20 years ago i
[56:22] can't remember the exact
[56:23] uh last time i went up to maine we heard
[56:24] that story and church is split because
[56:26] of this
[56:27] because see they don't understand the
[56:29] word of god but when you but see church
[56:31] when you really get married because you
[56:32] love someone
[56:33] you're willing to endure with them
[56:35] despite their struggles because you know
[56:37] you have struggles
[56:38] and if jesus forgave you you can forgive
[56:41] them praise god
[56:43] so the thing to do is if a woman cuts
[56:44] her hair for man shames his wife
[56:46] uh forgive brother random said i believe
[56:49] if i made a mistake
[56:51] and uh hugged and kissed on a woman
[56:53] while on the mission field i believe my
[56:54] wife would forgive me
[56:55] he said but god gave me the holy ghost
[56:57] so i wouldn't do that praise god
[56:59] amen amen and how many couples did
[57:02] brother
[57:02] unite that were divorced and he brought
[57:04] him back together he never said okay
[57:06] divorce her and go remarry again he
[57:07] never did that
[57:09] he always sought for reconciliation just
[57:12] like the bible says amen
[57:13] be reconciled amen if they sinned
[57:16] against others go confess the sin to the
[57:18] ones they sin against
[57:19] confess it to yourselves and let the
[57:21] love of jesus heal
[57:22] and show the world how the healing power
[57:24] of christ is alive and well
[57:27] in a world that loves to divorce and
[57:30] makes it easy financially to divorce
[57:32] in a world that loves a divorce the
[57:34] church of god if we've got problems and
[57:35] people weren't born again
[57:37] thought they were born again then let's
[57:38] be honest and sincere
[57:40] and let's show the world what real love
[57:42] is praise god
[57:43] but can a man put away his wife yeah the
[57:45] bible says
[57:46] really for any reason right because he's
[57:49] the head
[57:51] he's the head he can do that but i'd
[57:53] question a man that would do that
[57:55] i would question if he's born again or
[57:56] not
[57:58] praise god now that may be hard for some
[58:01] people to do but what do you do with
[58:02] this quote
[58:03] it's thus saith the lord right it's thus
[58:06] saith the lord
[58:07] a man as that authority he can do that
[58:10] he has
[58:11] the authority to do that but if he's
[58:13] really loves that woman i don't think
[58:15] he'll do that do you
[58:17] i don't think so so see a lot of people
[58:20] stumble at that but they fail to
[58:22] understand
[58:23] the rest of the scripture and the the
[58:25] brothers especially will use this
[58:27] in order to go remarry somebody else and
[58:29] that's nothing but uh
[58:31] evil lust
[58:34] all right so now
[58:38] kind of heavy on relationships tonight
[58:40] praise god see how you can prove if
[58:42] you're in the perfect will of god
[58:43] if god called you in marriage stay
[58:45] married if you're single
[58:46] find god's will you get should you be
[58:50] single you got the gift to be single or
[58:51] are you waiting on a marriage partner
[58:55] you're separated remain uh unmarried and
[58:58] see if god will
[58:58] reconcile the couple hallelujah
[59:06] now if you know in this chapter marriage
[59:08] is about
[59:10] serving how many know that marriage is
[59:12] about service
[59:16] go to verse 33 first uh corinthians 7 33
[59:21] remember paul was a zealous man but if
[59:24] everybody would have found his advice
[59:26] and not get married
[59:27] there'd have not been many children
[59:28] right then there'd not been many uh
[59:31] fathers and mothers to to train them up
[59:33] in the way they should go
[59:34] right they would have physically limited
[59:36] uh the number of
[59:38] arrows right they would have limited the
[59:40] number of arrows
[59:41] remember the bible said god's children
[59:44] are god's heritage that means possession
[59:46] amen
[59:47] children are god's possession they're
[59:49] from god amen
[59:50] they belong to god and god wants to send
[59:53] them so that he can shoot them out
[59:55] and battle the enemy at the gates praise
[59:57] god amen
[59:59] like i'm doing tonight god wanted me to
[1:00:01] be an arrow to go shoot
[1:00:02] and fight the enemies here in akron
[1:00:04] praise god and here we are
[1:00:06] we're rebuking demons in jesus christ's
[1:00:08] name amen trying to pray for the sake
[1:00:10] see that they'll recover rebuke sickness
[1:00:12] amen and have
[1:00:13] and fight the enemies right at the gates
[1:00:15] and the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:00:17] against this revelation amen
[1:00:19] here i am flying through the sky but
[1:00:21] amen one of these days i'm going to hit
[1:00:22] that mark and god's going to take me
[1:00:24] take me home one of these days i'm going
[1:00:26] to hit that mark by god's grace now
[1:00:28] that's just one way to look at it you
[1:00:30] might say i already hit the mark that
[1:00:31] might be true
[1:00:32] maybe he'll use me again i don't know
[1:00:34] but uh
[1:00:35] you see the point we've got a we're in a
[1:00:37] battle church we are
[1:00:38] instruments of war your prayers are
[1:00:41] powerful amen we saw that with naomi
[1:00:43] and her mom features praying for my wife
[1:00:46] night after the prayer
[1:00:47] perfect next night there's the baby
[1:00:51] god's grace god's grace
[1:00:54] the fervent prayers of the righteous
[1:00:57] prevail much praise god
[1:00:59] amen now this is all about pleasing your
[1:01:01] wife and husband verse 33 but he that is
[1:01:04] married careth
[1:01:04] for the things that are of the world
[1:01:06] that he may please his wife
[1:01:08] okay so paul says you know you're you're
[1:01:10] not going to be able to fully focus
[1:01:12] uh on your particular ministry
[1:01:15] if uh you're married but at the same
[1:01:17] time
[1:01:18] the reality is and that's true the
[1:01:21] reality is your ministry changes not to
[1:01:23] you
[1:01:24] it changes to sharpening that arrow
[1:01:27] praise god that's what that's what it
[1:01:29] changes to
[1:01:30] instead of just me me me iron sharpening
[1:01:33] iron now you will get sharpened while
[1:01:34] you're training children though that's
[1:01:35] for sure
[1:01:37] but you get you your eyes are off you
[1:01:40] how many no pair your parenting is
[1:01:42] losing selfishness how we know that's
[1:01:43] really the definition of parenting
[1:01:45] losing your selfishness right
[1:01:50] and then now it's off of you and you
[1:01:52] sharpen
[1:01:53] the next generation you get the next set
[1:01:56] of weapons ready to go
[1:01:58] to combat satan one of these days uh
[1:02:01] uh amen knows one of these days i want
[1:02:04] to bring out
[1:02:05] all of jonathan edwards descendants did
[1:02:08] you read that yet in the book
[1:02:10] so that's okay they traced his
[1:02:12] descendants brother
[1:02:13] and out of this preacher jonathan
[1:02:15] edwards from the 1800s
[1:02:17] came like a vice president 20 judges
[1:02:21] like a hundred preachers of one man amen
[1:02:25] one man and you look at his life he was
[1:02:28] one arrow
[1:02:29] but he was sharpening all kinds of
[1:02:30] errors he was training them up
[1:02:32] senators and representatives he was
[1:02:34] training them up
[1:02:35] and out of his lineage come forth a
[1:02:38] royal seed amen a holy seed amen
[1:02:41] that shape they shaped the the direction
[1:02:43] of this nation
[1:02:44] that's what i was telling my kids a few
[1:02:46] months ago i was like i want somebody to
[1:02:47] raise up and meet judges
[1:02:50] so when these left people that you know
[1:02:52] the people on the political left that
[1:02:54] try to change the laws and bring in
[1:02:56] all these wicked laws maybe my children
[1:02:58] stand there and say that's wrong
[1:03:00] it's against the constitution and bang
[1:03:02] their gavel
[1:03:03] i don't know i don't know how long we'll
[1:03:05] tarry but church you know my heart right
[1:03:07] i just want to see righteousness in
[1:03:10] every place we can get it praise god
[1:03:12] whether it's school of politics your
[1:03:15] home the job
[1:03:16] you know work we want righteousness to
[1:03:18] reign amen
[1:03:20] someone do my part praise god that's
[1:03:21] what i'm doing tonight if my children
[1:03:22] are listening
[1:03:23] if they'll listen they'll be sharpened
[1:03:24] tonight praise god because every
[1:03:26] every time i come to church i get
[1:03:28] sharpened i don't know about you do you
[1:03:29] ever get dolled by the holy spirit
[1:03:31] no you just sharpened praise god amen if
[1:03:34] you'll let god sharpen you
[1:03:36] right you either become dull lukewarm or
[1:03:39] become sharper by the holy spirit how
[1:03:42] much time do i get okay wow less than
[1:03:43] two minutes ah
[1:03:45] i thought i might even get to the other
[1:03:47] things well the lord knows
[1:03:49] how many times i preach i didn't think
[1:03:50] and then people were being blessed
[1:03:52] yeah so we just trust the holy spirit
[1:03:59] so god's if you're a parent god's will
[1:04:01] is to diligently
[1:04:02] love teach and discipline and provide
[1:04:05] for your children i have
[1:04:07] one two three four five six seven eight
[1:04:09] nine
[1:04:10] ten eleven scriptures in here that say
[1:04:12] that our job as parents is to sharpen
[1:04:15] the character
[1:04:16] so the children will defeat the future
[1:04:18] enemies
[1:04:20] praise god
[1:04:23] i appreciate that i appreciate i think
[1:04:25] about this i was trained
[1:04:26] enough i was sharp enough even in
[1:04:28] denominational church
[1:04:30] where there was times the enemy was
[1:04:31] coming after me but i've been sharpened
[1:04:32] enough
[1:04:33] i could overcome that temptation there
[1:04:35] was a couple times
[1:04:37] praise god and because i was at least
[1:04:40] given a little bit of sharpening
[1:04:41] i was able to overcome praise god you
[1:04:44] can sharpen the stone a little bit it'll
[1:04:45] cut
[1:04:47] you don't have to cut like real deep but
[1:04:49] you sharpen enough
[1:04:50] it'll cut how many of that
[1:04:55] now if you for all your family
[1:04:57] non-family members the bible said
[1:04:59] live at peace with all men as much as
[1:05:01] possible
[1:05:03] so i've gone through your family right
[1:05:05] your marriage relationships are single
[1:05:07] children and now outside of that
[1:05:09] relatives
[1:05:10] try to live peaceably with all men
[1:05:12] that's the will of god
[1:05:14] have answers ready for those who ask
[1:05:17] about your faith
[1:05:18] and season them with grace jesus says
[1:05:22] bless and love your enemies rather than
[1:05:24] cursing them overcoming evil with good
[1:05:28] i know about you church but that sounds
[1:05:29] like a pretty easy plan to me
[1:05:32] is the will of god so mysterious not
[1:05:34] really
[1:05:35] if we sit and read our bibles and
[1:05:37] believe what it says
[1:05:38] and tie this one with that one and put
[1:05:40] it all together it's a pretty simple
[1:05:42] walk praise god
[1:05:43] and the best part is one one power
[1:05:46] fulfills it all
[1:05:48] love keeps all the commands praise god
[1:05:50] that's why being born again is so
[1:05:52] important
[1:05:53] if you just get born again and live from
[1:05:55] the soul
[1:05:56] and obey the nature god places in your
[1:05:58] soul you'll fulfill everything praise
[1:06:00] god
[1:06:01] amen hallelujah i know it's hot too me
[1:06:04] too
[1:06:06] i don't sweat this much in a while here
[1:06:12] all right this is a shorter one so for
[1:06:14] your job well close to this one okay so
[1:06:15] give me
[1:06:16] give me five think about five minutes
[1:06:17] maybe make it 10.
[1:06:19] god's will for your job is urgent
[1:06:21] question for us
[1:06:24] but remember this parenting is more
[1:06:26] important
[1:06:27] than a job right than money for male or
[1:06:30] female right for a man if a man gets a
[1:06:35] job and he can't
[1:06:36] train his and help his wife and children
[1:06:38] what what kind of job is that
[1:06:41] right would i want to just spend all my
[1:06:42] day working and then never see my wife
[1:06:44] and kids
[1:06:45] no that'd be like a waste of life right
[1:06:48] so man or woman i know we have sisters
[1:06:50] at work you know that's fine if god
[1:06:52] calls him that praise god
[1:06:55] but our our work should not interfere
[1:06:59] with the ways of god praise god we're
[1:07:02] training
[1:07:03] the next generation the bible says and i
[1:07:04] preached this when i remember when i
[1:07:05] preached the proverbs series remember
[1:07:07] that
[1:07:08] some people didn't like that that's okay
[1:07:11] they're gone i know god liked it praise
[1:07:13] god i know that
[1:07:15] that's true proverbs 29 15 says the rod
[1:07:18] and reproof give wisdom
[1:07:20] but a child left to himself bringeth his
[1:07:22] mother to shame
[1:07:24] so see you can have you you and i have
[1:07:27] to work but
[1:07:28] we have to be able to spend time with
[1:07:30] our children in order to direct them
[1:07:33] so they feel like they've got somebody
[1:07:35] they've got a they've got a
[1:07:36] a leader they've got a friend my friend
[1:07:38] calls it a buddy when they become
[1:07:40] teenagers they've got to feel like they
[1:07:42] got somebody on their side praise god
[1:07:44] and they have to have somebody they can
[1:07:46] talk to and ask questions about the word
[1:07:48] of god
[1:07:50] see don't leave them to themselves
[1:07:52] that's why that's why
[1:07:54] child trafficking is so big in the u.s
[1:07:56] right
[1:07:57] because all the parents put their kids
[1:07:59] on the computer all day just go on the
[1:08:01] ipad
[1:08:01] and they leave them to themselves they
[1:08:04] don't spend time with them they don't
[1:08:06] talk to them
[1:08:06] they don't ask them how their day was
[1:08:07] they don't teach them nothing about god
[1:08:09] that's sinners
[1:08:10] right mostly
[1:08:13] i you know and i started supporting a uh
[1:08:17] a rescue operation ministry i just a
[1:08:19] little bit each month
[1:08:22] you know what they found they found most
[1:08:24] parents willingly sell their children
[1:08:26] away
[1:08:26] to child trafficking the majority of
[1:08:29] them because they're so filled with
[1:08:30] drugs they want drug money
[1:08:32] if they'll get ten thousand say ten
[1:08:33] thousand might be a number
[1:08:37] that's awful church that is just so
[1:08:39] isn't that so heartbreaking
[1:08:40] but that's where we live in where there
[1:08:43] the bible said they would lose
[1:08:44] natural affection right because of the
[1:08:47] love of sin
[1:08:48] because of the the great iniquity the
[1:08:50] love of many shall
[1:08:52] wax cold they spent so much time on
[1:08:54] movies and games and drugs that they
[1:08:56] lost the natural
[1:08:57] love for a child what a blessing
[1:08:59] children are praise god
[1:09:00] they're god's possession amen they're
[1:09:02] god's arrows hallelujah
[1:09:09] see they leave them alone to their ipad
[1:09:11] leave them alone
[1:09:12] tv the choice between more money
[1:09:18] or staying home more the choice is
[1:09:20] obvious
[1:09:22] spend more time with your kids i know
[1:09:25] there's homes that they can't make it
[1:09:26] without two incomes i know about that
[1:09:29] i know about that i wasn't making much
[1:09:30] money at all when i first got
[1:09:32] married i thank the lord for it
[1:09:36] i thank god for his mercy
[1:09:40] my mom is to me one of the great best
[1:09:43] examples that even after my parents
[1:09:44] divorced in junior high
[1:09:46] my mom would just stay at home do the
[1:09:49] you know
[1:09:49] lunches and everything like that and
[1:09:52] then
[1:09:53] at night she would go off and clean
[1:09:54] libraries so we were all home and she'd
[1:09:56] get home like at 10 p.m then we'd all do
[1:09:58] our prayer time and
[1:10:00] um we just made it off of government
[1:10:03] food
[1:10:04] for a while and church donations
[1:10:08] but look at the results now praise god
[1:10:11] look at the results now
[1:10:13] three preachers you know everybody now
[1:10:16] goes to church as far as i know
[1:10:17] everybody now goes to church
[1:10:21] she chose the harder way
[1:10:24] but it was well worth the investment you
[1:10:27] can work the rest of your life
[1:10:29] after the children grow up but you'll
[1:10:31] never get that
[1:10:32] time back to train them
[1:10:36] love and invest in our children's souls
[1:10:37] while their hope while there's hope
[1:10:39] proverbs 19 18 says
[1:10:40] chasten thy son while there is hope
[1:10:45] and let not thy soul spare for his cry
[1:10:47] now we know god
[1:10:48] can save anybody at any age praise god
[1:10:50] we know that
[1:10:51] but remember wisdom is all about likely
[1:10:54] possibilities right it's likely
[1:10:56] if we likely don't train them when
[1:10:58] they're young they'll likely not return
[1:11:01] because of our partly because of our
[1:11:03] negligence
[1:11:09] when you pray church for a job you let
[1:11:12] god
[1:11:12] lead you if you love god he'll let all
[1:11:16] the choices work for your good he said
[1:11:18] because all things work together for
[1:11:19] good
[1:11:21] we've got to be open to god moving us
[1:11:24] to different places different jobs paul
[1:11:27] was a tet maker
[1:11:31] luke was a doctor matthew was a tax
[1:11:34] collector
[1:11:36] peter was a fisherman lydia was a seller
[1:11:38] of purple the fine clothings
[1:11:42] you got peter over here he's getting all
[1:11:44] dirty you know fishing
[1:11:48] and then lydia's over here selling fine
[1:11:50] dignified
[1:11:51] purple and gold goggles yet both holy
[1:11:54] ghost-filled saints
[1:11:55] amen praise god now peter wasn't filled
[1:11:59] with holy ghost you know until after
[1:12:00] pentecost but he was on his way
[1:12:03] see god has different callings in life
[1:12:06] now paul was paul made tense by the
[1:12:08] work of his hands built sewed tents
[1:12:11] together made tense
[1:12:13] if god provided for them how many know
[1:12:14] he'll provide for us
[1:12:17] no matter the vocation god said work
[1:12:19] diligently
[1:12:20] ecclesiastes 9 10 says whatever your
[1:12:22] hand finds to do
[1:12:24] do it with your might for there's no
[1:12:26] work or device or knowledge nor wisdom
[1:12:28] in the grave
[1:12:28] where thou goes she said make the most
[1:12:31] of it work with all your heart
[1:12:32] and paul later says be not slothful in
[1:12:35] business
[1:12:37] i should be a very motivated teacher
[1:12:40] which i am
[1:12:42] if i was a lazy teacher it shows i
[1:12:44] wasn't born again
[1:12:45] because a christian is not lazy in their
[1:12:47] work a christian is up and at it praise
[1:12:49] god
[1:12:51] the man said that's one person that will
[1:12:52] work is a christian
[1:12:56] ephesians 6 6 paul tells servants serve
[1:12:58] from your heart not with eye service
[1:13:01] not as men pleasers see obey your boss
[1:13:04] as servants of christ
[1:13:06] doing the will of god from the heart so
[1:13:09] do your job like you were doing it for
[1:13:11] jesus praise god i know some of this is
[1:13:14] a review but i know i gotta
[1:13:15] preach it and wait for the inspiration
[1:13:17] of the holy spirit
[1:13:20] and a lot of people church i'm a i know
[1:13:22] what it's like sometimes you lose your
[1:13:23] heart like
[1:13:24] sometimes you lose a heart for your job
[1:13:25] how many can say you have to say too
[1:13:27] loud
[1:13:28] sometimes you lose motivation so you ask
[1:13:30] god lord created me
[1:13:32] a desire to work for this job like i
[1:13:36] would work for you
[1:13:37] right in other words restore the joy
[1:13:39] right restore
[1:13:40] my love uh show me my purpose
[1:13:44] now it helps me too when people say you
[1:13:45] know we prayed and asked god for you to
[1:13:47] be our teacher and
[1:13:48] you're an answer to our prayers that
[1:13:49] helps too say god
[1:13:51] show me that you place me here for a
[1:13:54] purpose for such a time as this
[1:13:56] like esther praise god
[1:14:00] always remember god doesn't give you the
[1:14:02] job to become rich unless you're one of
[1:14:04] those few saints that
[1:14:05] get to be rich so you can support the
[1:14:07] ministry of god with greater offerings
[1:14:09] but remember first timothy 6 6 but
[1:14:11] godliness with contentment is great gain
[1:14:14] money is only a means to an end right
[1:14:18] the end is loving god and your fellow
[1:14:20] man and
[1:14:21] god loves a cheerful giver how many can
[1:14:23] say amen today let's stand praise god
[1:14:25] that's about 45 minutes
[1:14:28] and maybe 50 by god's grace that's just

[1:15:24] preaching
[1:15:25] and then we'll look at gifts of the holy
