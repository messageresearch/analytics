TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign chapter 20. the themes of this chapter include the Thousand-Year reign with Christ upon the Earth the Battle of Goga Magog and the Great White Throne judgment the Thousand-Year reign of Christ upon the Earth is described in verses one through six and John gets to see a glimpse of what will take place after the awful tribulation period this one thousand year reign is often called the millennium the Millennium is likened unto the honeymoon of Christ and his wife the New Testament Church the Rapture is first and is likened unto the wedding ceremony next the marriage suffer the lamb is likened unto the wedding reception and then the millennial honeymoon follows it this 1 000 year reign is God's opportunity to finally have his seventh day or day of rest that Satan interrupted in Genesis chapter 3 after God's first six days of creation or the first six thousand years this is true because second Peter 3 verse 8 states that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day during this Reign not only will Christ have his own Throne as son of David but all the born-again Christians will sit upon Thrones of judgment as Christ had promised them in Revelation 3 verse 21 and First Corinthians 6 verse 2 because they willingly gave their lives as Martyrs for Christ or they refused to worship the Beast which is the false Christian system of the Roman Catholic church and its Protestant daughters who share false doctrines and abominable works with the mother harlot because these born-again Christians reigned in life over sin the flesh the world and Satan by the Holy Spirit of Christ as Romans 5 17 States Jesus can now trust them to Reign on the earth for one thousand years the Battle of Gog and Magog is described in verses 7 through 10 and is the final battle recorded in holy writ Satan who will be recently loose from the bottomless pit after one thousand years of being locked in the pit Will deceive the Nations that have grown up and multiplied to the number as the sand of the sea during the 1 000 years of peace Satan's Army will Compass or surround the camp of the Saints and the Beloved City Jerusalem according to Psalm 48 2 Lamentations 215 Zechariah 8 verse 3 and Psalm 132 verses 13 and 14. a fire will come down from God out of heaven and devour the deceived Army and then the deceiver himself Satan will finally be done away with for eternity as he will be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone and receive torment day and night forever and ever the great white Throne judgment is described in verses 11-15 and is also detail in Daniel 7 verses 9 and 10 John 5 verses 28 and 29 and Matthew 25 verses 31-46 this is the day when all men and women shall stand before God to be judged from the open books by their works and either given eternal life or the second death which is the Lake of Fire the Lake of Fire is eternal separation from God's presence and ultimately complete annihilation of The Souls of unbelievers who will cease to exist at some point it is important to see that those whose names are found in the Book of Life are allowed to go into life eternal Matthew 25 46 for being kind and gracious to even the least of Jesus's Brethren as Matthew 25 40 States but a true born-again holy ghost-filled Christian already has eternal life during their time of service on Earth as seen in first John 5 13 John 5 verse 24 Romans 8 verse 10 and Colossians 1 verse 27. so this tells us that the holy ghost-filled Christians will be seated with Christ on the throne at the great white Throne judgment just as they sat on Thrones during the Millennium to serve as a witness on this day of judgment as Jesus said the queen of the South would raise up in judgment against the first century generation in Matthew 12 42. the symbols and key Revelations include the old Serpent and the first resurrection the old serpent in Revelation 20 verse 2 is a symbol of Satan as earlier taught in Revelation 12 verse 9. Satan has numerous symbols such as Serpent and dragon and numerous titles such as the devil Satan and Lucifer having multiple symbols and names does not make Satan more than one person just as God has multiple titles such as father son Holy Ghost and yet God is only one person not three persons as most so-called Christians claim for the Bible never calls God three persons instead Christ is the image of the invisible God according to Colossians 1 verse 15 the image of the one and only person of God according to Hebrews 1 verse 3. Jesus is the express image of the person of God the symbol of Satan as the old serpent reminds us that he was the originator of sin in heaven before coming to Earth and possessing the body of the serpent in the Garden of Eden Satan is called the father of lies and so he was the first liar in heaven and the first liar on Earth Satan has two main forms revealing his tactics the power of the dragon and the subtlety of the serpent Satan is both powerful and subtle he overpowers the weak and deceives those who are not watchful Christ justly casts Satan into the Lake of Fire where Satan will receive constant torment day and night as a recompense for all the pain and death his lies have caused the first resurrection is a key Revelation mentioned in Revelation chapter 20 verse 5. most churchgoers are unaware that there are two resurrections the first resurrection is the rapture of the New Testament Church spoken of in first Thessalonians 4 verse 17 and First Corinthians 15 verses 51-54 which is also called The Wedding of Christ and his wife this wedding was mentioned in Revelation chapter 19 as well the Rapture changes the bodies of the dead and living Saints into Incorruptible bodies before the Great Tribulation period and allows them to live in heaven and enjoy the marriage supper of the lamb and also gives them the right to live and reign with Christ for one thousand years in the millennium the second Resurrection According To Jesus is called the resurrection of life and resurrection of damnation in John 5 verses 28 and 29. this is when all men and women in their graves will be called to stand before God and be judged out of God's books for their works only the Holy Ghost filled Christians and Jews will live during the 1 000 year Millennium for the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished as Revelation 20 verse 5 says which means they can only be raised at the second Resurrection since they missed out on the first resurrection which was the rapture the timing of events is as follows this entire chapter is completely chronological sometime after the tribulation period Satan is Bound for one thousand years which allows Christ and his people to complete their one thousand year honeymoon on the Earth at the completion of the 1000 Years Satan is loose for a short season and deceives the Nations to come to Gog and Magog and battle against Christ his wife and Jesus's beloved City fire comes down from heaven to Devour the deceived Army and Satan is cast into the Lake of Fire and the second Resurrection gathers all men and women to stand before God at the great white Throne judgment and receive either eternal life or the second death in the Lake of Fire if you'd like more Bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the Book of Revelation please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
