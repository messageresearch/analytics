TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and then as they was blinded by God his grace reached down to him because all Israel will be saved greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to prove hopefully once and for all by the grace of God that brother William Branham God's true Prophet did not plagiarize the fifth seal before I begin on the fifth seal I just want to remind the viewers that up to this point with the first four seals there are 26 differences between brother Branham and Charles tase Russell only and this is not counting the differences of the Branham had between Clarence Larkin and Uriah Smith on the first four seals I would imagine there'd be around 40 50 or more differences between these three men on just the first four seals only the accusation about the fifth seal one of brother Ram's accusers put out a video last year saying brother Branham plagiarized the fifth seal from Clarence Larkin the video said quote William Branham and Clarence Larkin have an identical interpretation of who the souls under the altar were how did Clarence Larkin get that Revelation in 1919 when the fifth seal was not open until 1963 was William Branham intentionally misleading his followers end quote so of course this is a false accusation my initial reaction is brother Branham and Larkin's teachings were similar in only one way on the fifth seal so they were identical in only one way and that was the identity of the souls but there were three other differences about the fifth seal that they disagreed on brother Ram's accusers are either purposely slandering brother Branham or they are incredibly shoddy and weak researchers with little to no understanding of what brother Branham actually taught about the fish seal here's three points about the accusation first Russell was not mentioned for the first time in these five seals brother man's accuser mentioned Charles Taze Russell the first four seals but not the fifth this means the accuser must have read Russell's work it's most likely he was omitting Russell's full teachings on the first five seals on purpose second so far brother Branham taught completely different than Clarence Larkin on four out of five seals brother Branham and Larkin are very similar on The Sixth Seal which we'll get to which I've already shown in previous videos and also a podcast and Larkin and brother Branham are slightly different on the seventh seal so it can be seen brother Branham did exactly what he said he found the truth of the seals from the visions of the Holy Ghost and he believed quote as much as possible end quote with other Bible teachers let's listen to the quote I had my own idea as every Minister does of reading maybe what other man had said and believing as much as I possible with them on the things that they had drawn up their conclusion uh I'd read the book of Mr Smith your eyes Smith which is the Adventist a teacher and um I read his uh his thoughts on it and I read uh Mr Larkin I'd read all so many different ones of their commentaries on this a third point about the accusation is that Larkin had a 50 chance to Guess Who these Souls were according to scripture they were either Jews or gentiles any group saved in heaven under the altar could be only one of two groups either Jew or Gentile that's according to many scriptures but one example would be First Corinthians 12 13 quote for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one Spirit end quote also remember from the 70th week of Daniel that brother brand was grateful to Dr Larkin regarding his views of Daniel's 70th week and of course I'm sure that would apply to all the other work of Larkin that brother random read let's listen to the quote [Music] Mr Smith of the Adventist Church for his views I'm very grateful to Dr Larkin of his views I'm grateful to all these great Scholars for their views on this and in reading them it enlightens me much that I can find places that looks right the fifth seal now let's look at the fifth seal and compare brother branham's teachings with Clarence Larkins as a summary brother Branham and Larkin have one similarity and three differences the one similarity is that these souls are Jews Larkin said quote but they were not the martyrs of the Christian church for they had been resurrected and taken up with the church these Martyrs are those who will be killed for the word of God in their testimony after the church is caught out end quote and Larkin went on to say quote these Martyrs whose souls are seen are mainly Jews end quote let's listen to Brothers say that these Souls under the altar are Jews now why are these Souls anyway that's and they think who are they that if they're not the early church this is Israel that's to be saved as a nation oh man that are predestinated that's Israel that's Israel itself so that is the only similarity between Larkin and brother Branham here's three major differences between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin first Larkin said their Jews only after the church is called out so these are Jews who are martyred after the Rapture they're martyred during the 70th week of Daniel brother Bram did not limit these Jews to only being Jews that are martyred after the Rapture by God's grace let me quote Larkin again saying these Souls were only Jewish Souls after the Rapture he said quote but they were not the martyrs of the Christian church for they had been resurrected and taken up with the church these Martyrs are those who will be killed for the word of God and their testimony after the church is called out end quote that's on pages 58 and 59 of Larkin's book called The Book of Revelation so notice it's Jews after the church is called out brother Ram said these Souls under the altar included Jews before the Rapture from the time of Jesus Christ being rejected on the cross about 2000 years ago to the present time and also included the Jews in the Holocaust let's listen to the quotes and now they were reading for they realized that they recognized that's just going on they seen them when they come before the altar of God but now the grace of God is to that now these Souls under the altar are the these these Souls understanding now it's under the altar while they were martyred by sinful man like Eichmann yeah see they're holding out on millions of them but they remain Jews the Jews sort of stalling all the rest of the world but they stayed true to what they believe and they killed them because they were Jews and now look what a thing they had to do see that was guilty of murder so they got murdered that's right and they were blind Ed now if they hadn't been blinded God said let alone they're not worthy but then if they was blinded by God his grace reached down to them a room because all Israel will be saved everyone has their names written right that's right I noticed now the whole day I tried to get rid of Joseph his grace reached to him go there try to get rid of Jesus he still comes right back around causes dying to give each one of white girls he's gonna take him out in a home anyhow anyhow here's a visual the difference between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin notice this is a vast difference and the conclusion is brother Bram did not plagiarize Clarence Larkin notice the small amount of time for Larkin's fifth seal to be fulfilled it's only fulfilled during the Great Tribulation period but brother branham's fist seal was different his Souls on the altar included Souls from the time of Jesus crucifixion around 30 A.D throughout the entire church age including the Holocaust and also the Jews that would be martyred and saved after the Rapture so any honest person would realize brother Ram did not play dries Clarence Larkin a second difference is that brother Branham said the white robes were given to the Jews at the great white Throne judgment in the church age book Clarence Larkin said they were given the right robes under the altar Larkin said quote to these martyred Souls white robes were given this does not mean they were resurrected that is given glorified bodies and then robed but that they in their soulish or physical bodies were given white robes for while the spirit of man loses its Earthly or fleshly body at death it still has a body its soulish body that can see here speak etc for How could a soul cry if it did not have a form and physical senses end quote and in chapter 7 of the church age book brother random said quote it is the second resurrection that the souls under the altar are set forth in the fifth seal Revelation 6 verses 9 through 11 are given white robes and of course eternal life or there would be no point of white robes end quote the third difference between brother Branham and Larkin regarding the fifth seal is Larkin said Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 was the Revelation 11 Elijah Ministry to the Jews the same Elijah Ministry that would partner with the Moses Ministry Larkin said quote that Elijah the prophet when he returns will preach Malachi 4. verses 5 and 6 end quote brother Rand did not teach this of course brother Ram said the Elijah prophet of Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 was his ministry to the Gentiles in the seventh Gentile Church age and here's a quote from August 1965 where brother Brandon said with thus saith the Lord that the prophet of Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 who was anointed with the spirit of Elijah and would turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers was on the earth at that time in 1965. so it could have been no one else except brother Branham let's listen to the quote that word forever yeah but he promised to do it and Promises stop and stuff they have the Lord notice they did the same thing as this morning did until God got enough of us I remember against us stay at the Lord it'll come to pass in this day Now search every account take every Clan take every man take every Church you and Christ need to do this you preachers I charge you to read the newspapers or take consideration anywhere you want to go and see if it isn't on the Earth right now before moving on I want to show you the Folly of brother Ram's accusers here's a screenshot of Larkin's two pages about the fifth seal in blue you'll see the material that brother M's accusers tried to use against brother Branham of course to their own shame and folly but in the yellow highlights you'll see the differences between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin so if brother Ram's accuser is really wanted the truth all they had to do was keep reading the next few paragraphs after the first information they used from Larkin and they would have found the truth then all they had to do was just read one more paragraph after their second portion of information from Larkin that they used and they would have found the truth so the truth was laying right in front of their faces and if they're honest they'll repent of their false plagiarism charge and humbly acknowledge the truth that was laying right before them if their hearts are righteous then the Bible says they'll study to answer honestly according to the Book of Proverbs so time will tell if their hearts are righteous or not so now the updated amount of differences between Branham and Russell on the first four seals and Larkin on the fifth seal only is now 29 differences so they were previously 26 differences on the first four seals and now there's three differences on the fifth seal for a total of 29 differences and again remember this doesn't include the many differences between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin and Uriah Smith on the first four seals nor between Russell and Uriah Smith on the fifth seal which we'll look at next by God's grace now let's look at brother Branham and Charles Tays Russell on the fifth seal here there are five differences between brother Branham and Charles days Russell first regarding the timing Russell said the fifth seal was quote the Reformation in the days of Luther end quote and began in quote the spring of 1518 end quote and of course ended at Russell's Church age which he said began in 1874. it seems there may be some overlap between Russell's fifth and sixth seals but based upon this one quote Russell's fifth seal lasted until around 1755 because Russell said the first event of The Sixth Seal was the Lisbon earthquake from November 1st 1755. Russell said quote and I be held when he had opened the Sixth Seal and lo there was a great earthquake literally the Great lispon Earthquake November 1st 1755. which extended over 4 million square miles shocked all Africa and Western Europe including Scandinavian Greenland end quote and of course brother Ram's timing on the fifth seal was that these Souls included Jews who were blinded to Jesus Christ as their Messiah from the time of Jesus crucifixion all the way to the time of the Rapture and then after the Rapture and of course brother Brown said there would be more Jewish Martyrs after the Rapture and they'd be martyred during the Great Tribulation period let's listen to the quotes that's right and they were blinded now if they hadn't been blinded God said let alone they're not worthy but then if they was blinded by God his grace reached down to him because all Israel will be saved everyone has his name written right that's right notice these souls are to wait a little season for the 144 to be martyred oh isn't that isn't that this puts the Bible together so here's a visual showing how brother Graham did not plagiarize Charles Tays Russell on the timing of the fifth seal notice the short amount of time that Russell's fifth seal lasted from about 15-18 which was the beginning of the Reformation to about 1755 when he said the first event of The Sixth Seal happened the Lisbon earthquake and again notice how brother Ram's fifth seal lasted a very long time from 30 A.D the blinded Jewish Souls who were saved despite rejecting their own Messiah and all the Jewish Souls saved who were blinded to the Messiah during the entire church ages including the Jewish Martyrs who have to give their lives during the Great Tribulation period so the conclusion is it's obvious brother Bram did not plagiarize Charles Tays Russell on the fifth seal the second difference between brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell were on the souls Russell said they were Christians from the Reformation brother random said they were Jews as we already saw Russell said they were Christians from the days of Luther's reformation and they were killed by the Roman Catholic church or Rome or the Pope the third difference is on the word slain in the fifth seal Russell said they were either slain by spiritual or natural beheading brother Branham never taught spiritual beheading Russell said quote men that were slain spiritually beheaded some of them literally also Revelation 20 verse 4 end quote the fourth difference between brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell was was on the scripture of the Fist seal that said it was said unto them Russell actually prophesied under the fifth seal that the Saints the Christian Saints would raise from the dead in the spring of 1878 and then later clarified it would be in April 1878. of course this makes Charles Tay's Russell a false prophet because the dead in Christ did not rise in April 1878. Russell said quote which show that as Christ was raised from the dead in 8033 the sleeping Saints would be raised 1845 years later in the spring of 1878 end quote and Russell even called this a prophecy quote as indicated by the prophecies here and noted end quote and then he said quote this we have elsewhere shown marks the date April 1878 end quote the fifth difference between brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell was on the little season of the fifth seal Russell said it was 360 years since Martin Luther and the Reformation to April 1878 Russell said quote 360 years from the spring of 1518 brings us to the spring of 1878 where we understand that God's promise made to the sleeping Saints was fulfilled they were raised from the dead and Babylon was cast off end quote brother Branham said the little season was the Jews who would be martyred during the seven year tribulation period or the last week of Daniel's 70th week let's listen to brother Ram's quote these souls are to wait a little season for the 144 to be martyred oh isn't that isn't that this is pet survival because and finally let's compare brother Branham and Uriah Smith on the fifth seal there's three differences between brother Branham and Uriah Smith first on the timing your eye Smith said the fifth seal was the Reformation period which began around 1517 he said quote following the period of the papal persecution the time covered by this seal would commence when the Reformation began to undermine the Antichrist papal Fabric and restrain the persecuting power of the Romans church end quote and of course as we already said brother Branham said the fifth seal conversation between the slain Jews and the Lord takes place after the Rapture but that group of Jews contains blinded Jews from the time of Jesus crucifixion all the way to the Rapture and then we'll include martyr Jews during the tribulation period here's a visual of the difference between brother Branham and Uriah Smith notice how similar Uriah Smith's timeline was to Charles days Russell they were only different by one year I Smith said the physio lasted from 1517 to about 1755. I noticed brother Ram's fiscio included the blinded Jews who were saved and waiting under the altar from the time of Jesus crucifixion throughout the entire church age including the Jews who were martyred during the Holocaust and will include the Jews who will be martyred after the Rapture during the Great Tribulation period so any honest soul will say that brother Ram did not plagiarize Uriah Smith on the fifth seal the second difference between brother Branham and Uriah Smith was the souls Uriah Smith said they were martyred for their attachment to Christianity he said quote and under it the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God martyred for their attachment to Christianity end quote and of course brother random went to Great Lengths in the fifth seal to show how these Souls were killed for the word of God's sake and not the testimony of Jesus Christ brother Ram clearly showed they were not Christians they were Jews so again brother Rand was completely different than Uriah Smith and the third and final difference between brother Branham and Uriah Smith was the little season Ryan Smith said Rome added hundreds of thousands of Christian Martyrs from the time of the Reformation until the time of The Sixth Seal which he said was November 1st 1775. so Uriah Smith's little season was from around 1517 to about 1775. brother M did not say that for the Rams of the little season was Daniel's 70th week the seven year Great Tribulation period your eyes Smith said quote the little season and during this time Rome added hundreds of thousands to the vast throng of those blood she had already become guilty see Buck's theological dictionary art persecution but the spirit of persecution was finally restrained the cause of the martyrs was Vindicated and the little season of the fifth seal came to a close end quote in closing friends I hope this teaching on the fifth seal was a great help to you by the grace of the Lord again brother Brandon is Vindicated as receiving the revelation of the first five seals from the Lord Jesus Christ from his holy spirit again this makes us feel sad for brothers accusers they're either completely ignorant of brother Ram's teachings on the seals and also the full extent of teaching from Charleston's Russell Clarence Larkin Uriah Smith or they're purposely slandering God's genuine Prophet brother Branham let's pray for their souls father God I just humble myself again Lord God and ask God lord if it be possible that brother Adam's accusers could humble themselves and be convinced by now these 29 differences on the first five seals and Lord we know that's a small number as well there's many more differences so father let the spirit of Truth come upon brother Ram's accusers May the repent of their false teachings Lord you say With God all things are possible so Lord I know it's possible so I ask if it be possible they could be righteous repent of their sins and recognize the truth and repent of their erroneous research and publicly humble themselves admit they're wrong and recognize the truth Lord I just put this in your hands Lord all things are possible and Lord it's our desire that we could save sinners from The Malt through their sins Lord we're reminded of James chapter 5 verse 20 that says if we convert The Sinner from the air of his way we shall save a soul from death and hide a multitude of sins pray God if these accusers are not saved they could be converted they could repent of their lies and their sins and serve you with an honest righteous heart I ask all these things by the blood of Jesus Christ that thy will be done Lord Jesus in Christ's name I ask it amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
