TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to prove that William branham's absolute was the person of Jesus Christ and not his tapes yes you could say William branham's absolute was Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost the Word of God and the Bible but he never said his tapes were the absolute as the tape church movement in Jeffersonville erroneously teaches I first want to express my gratitude to God for brother branham's tapes because brother branham's tapes direct us to the absolute Jesus Christ as I listen to brother branham's tapes I'm directed to the absolute and through prayer I contact the absolute the Holy Spirit but William branham's tapes are not the absolute the tapes are not Jesus Christ we thank God for sending william branham to preach his sermons which were recorded on tape and I believe his tapes have more revelation on them than any other preacher but William Branham never said every word on the tapes was infallible or equal to Jesus Christ again I believe William Branham was a genuine prophet whose ministry fulfilled revelation 10 7 Malachi 4 5 & 6 Luke 17 30 also Matthew 17 11 acts 3 21 and revelation 3:14 this video is a third video in a series aimed at rightly dividing the word of truth regarding the seven false teachings coming out of the Jeffersonville Indiana Tape church movement you can do the other two videos on my youtube channel their titles are overview video 7 false teachings of the Jeffersonville tape church movement and the 2nd is not every word William Branham said was thus saith the Lord friends please know I have reached out to the Jeffersonville leadership in love I have sent emails letters in the mail and also made a private YouTube video for the leaders in Jeffersonville I've received two letters back but it seems the leaders do not want to receive correction for me as I was bringing it through God's Word so in Christian love we must pray for the leadership in Jeffersonville hopefully one day soon they will repent of their false teachings and simply teach the truth of God here's the outline for this video we'll start by defining the absolute and then see how God is the absolute and his Bible and His Word is the absolute we'll prove how brother branham's absolute was Jesus Christ only after that we'll look at the tape Church's false doctrines about the absolute then we'll see more quotes on how brother branham's absolute was Jesus Christ and at the end we'll look at one often misunderstood brother branham quote so let's begin with defining the absolute a modern definition is free from imperfection brother branham's definition from his Webster's dictionary was similar see power perfect in itself and it really is the word brother branham's own words disprove jeffersonville's beliefs that every word of brother branham is the absolute as you'll soon see based upon these definitions only God or Jesus Christ can be the absolute scripture says the Lord God omnipotent reigneth which means almighty ruler of all revelation 19:6 and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth brother branham plainly says he is not perfect so that disc ludes him and every single word of his as being the absolute [Music] [Music] remember an absolute is unlimited in power and Jesus had all power this proves Christ is the absolute Matthew 28:18 and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth on the other hand brother Branham admits he has no power just like all of us have now when Jesus Christ heals the sick I would say they'd be healed I can tell you that remember I have no power to heal I don't have power you don't have any power none of us does we have authority how many understands that next God's absolute is himself and his word there is only one absolute and that is God himself and his word Romans 3:4 says God forbid yay let God be true but every man a liar one said well where do we the absolute does that we're the absolute gods absolutely makes it right Jesus says God's Word is the absolute saying heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall never pass away in Matthew 24:35 this is the scripture brother Branham uses in reference to the absolute it's almost gotten to a place like it was the days of judges everybody has her own absolute but it all feels like the Pharaoh was and so forth but God's absolute is his word he gives it in heavens and earth to pass away they shall never pass away I like that friends if God himself and his word is the absolute how can the words of a man be the absolute they cannot as brother Branham quoted Romans 3:4 as proof that God is the absolute now let's listen to four statements by brother Branham that prove his absolute was only Jesus Christ and there can be no other absolute and there is only one absolute always the absolute is a person an eternal person and not a collection of audio mp3 files that's the only splitter for human life and Christ is the word notice William Branham never said his tapes were the absolute listen as brother Branham says there is only one absolute and there is no other absolute and it was in his tapes and cannot be as tapes because there are no other absolutes now if he is our absolute there can be no other absolute you can't hash-table not my church is my absolute my Preet is my absolute if Christ is your absolute you believe Christ word is no other way to do it yes sir he is my absolute not making your absolute pay in the time of my trouble he's always absolute brother branham's personal absolute was the word the Bible my absolute is the word the Bible and as a pastor here of the church my absolute is the word the truth is brother Branham preached about the absolute Jesus Christ who is the Word of God or the Holy Ghost next here's three false beliefs of the tape Church move regarding the absolute leadership at Branham tabernacle erroneously teaches and I quote I believe everything brother Branham says is thus saith the Lord this message has to be my absolute end quote this statement makes every word of brother Branham thus saith the Lord or infallible additionally they teach and I quote it must be all or nothing I have to believe that everything on tape is thus saith the Lord and the absolute the token for our day and I must unquestionably believe every word of brother Branham on tape end quote this is a dangerous false doctrine and I humbly believe it's the spirit of idolatry the danger of these statements is deifying William Branham by making every word he said the absolute when not every word he said was from God as he admitted himself on numerous occasions in 1958 by faith Moses brother Branham said in regards to his 1977 prediction it was not the Lord saying it which means it was not thus saith the Lord and that I predict now this is not the Lord saying this the other about the woman in his is the Lord but I predicted in nineteen and and thirty 33 that the world would be total annihilation before 77 William Branham also said it was a very awful thing and tommyrot to make him infallible they claimed a year that some brethren up there that does it on sent them up there and they're preaching that man should leave their wives and hunt for their spiritual mate and at the that I am perfectly infallible that there's nothing and all some of the office things you've ever heard and if this church knows that we don't stand for no such tommyrot is that thirdly jeffersonville teaches only the true seed of Abraham believed every word on brother branham's tapes are thus saith the Lord which excludes everyone else from being the Royal seat of Abraham and I quote but God's prophet told us there would be a group of people that would believe every word they are the real living seed of Abraham and quote friends notice the pressure of fear this movement is using they say falsely if you don't believe every word of brother Branham on tape as thus saith the Lord you are not the real royal seat of Abraham the truth is real believers the real seat of Abraham do not exalt every word of William Branham to be infallible or thus saith the Lord this is because they know brother Branham says a true prophet and true leaders won't hold you to their own words in fear but will point you to the Word of God church age book chapter nine Laodicean Church age have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear they say that if the people don't do what they say or if they leave then destruction will follow they are false prophets for a true prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to Jesus Christ and he won't tell the people to fear him or what he says but to fear what the word says thankfully as you listen to more of brother branham's tapes you find the truth that he made human mistakes yet he was a genuine prophet brother Branham said he was not infallible brother branham said profits are not infallible people brother branham said there were mix ups on his tapes think about like the other day I got something leased up I happen to hear yes I called it right there it's on the tape now I probably hear from it but if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the vial brother branham said prophets make mistakes and every prophet made their mistakes now all I could say I'm a man my words can just failed it's like any other man all of us I prove to you tonight that ever prophet everything else they've made their mistakes but God makes no mistakes his word is a truth brother branham said he made thousands of mistakes each year brother branham said every prophet must be tested by the word and we must test and prove all things we all must speak the same thing then we must speak not contrary but exactly with this word that's how a true prophet is tested whether he's got the word the Bible said if their testimony is not according to the law office there's no light in them it's got to be according to the work now here is the time that everything that I've said has got to be proven to be right or wrong don't divide what they prove all things the whole face then we must prove all things by the scripture not what if it's contrary to my faith and yet the scripture says though the scriptures right and I'm on the the scripture is always right and only way you can do anything is come back to the scripture the remember it's the elected is the only time that'll catch it what do you say how do you know what you're not right then catch me by the word contest your denomination by this word that's even if I prove all things the Bible don't stop getting the tapes just stay with it search it by the word and see if it's right the Bible said prove all things I know it's done poppers told Jesus told was the method Darwin also brother branham said be very careful listening to him to know when God was speaking or when brother randoms human side and his own opinions were being expressed which could potentially be fallible see I always asked you to be careful what you're listening to think there's so much of it that it's just the human side but always if there is something that goes forth it will speak it it's thus saith the Lord even to visions or anything I could be altogether wrong am i thought about Martin Luther King I don't know I can't say if that's just my opinion now let's look at more brother branham absolute quotes and remember brother branham never says I am the absolute or my tapes are the absolute listen to these numerous quotations from brother Branham in which he describes the absolute you will discover there are numerous synonyms for the absolute but they really are one in the same thing the person of Jesus Christ brother random calls the absolute Jesus Christ from one place to another but if you just take the real absolute he slays me yeah trust me haha my anchor holds within the veil I had a absolute I tied myself to his word and his word before him he is my absolute I found out all these other things may fail but Christ can never fail now when you become like Paul had the same absolute that he had a christ-centered life is a different life than what you want but he helped to and was not disobedient he carried it out to the minute or it was an absolute and any christ-centered life that's your absolute how happen to one we were reading about he had a christ-centered call that was his absolute and as a closing of this meeting I'm trying to tell you the reason that I acted and said the things I did because long ago I've taken Christ for my absolute there's none of these things bother me or he was hired to an absolute price never true achievement is tied to an absolute absolute is the word and everybody else's that's really bored of the fish the absolutist brother branham calls the Word of God the absolute has got to come to one final absolute and my absolute is the word the Bible and as a pastor here of the church my absolute is the word so forth but God's absolute is his word he gives it in heavens and earth will pass away that shall never pass away I like that now if he is our absolute that can be no other absolute you can't have stable mine my church is my absolute my Creed is my absolute if Christ is your absolute you believe Christ word is no other way to do it the sweetest voice I ever heard my life said don't fear to go anywhere and don't fear to do anything for the never-failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you go absolute my eager whole Jenner because it's a word of the Living God and only one thing dude you have to stop by yourself first the thing in the name of long-stay where when you're you say but brother rather you make people hate you love that's not absolute Kate rest older door my flesh you got us to learn brother branham cause the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost the absolute best our heads just move but you haven't got that absolute down get it if you'd like to have that absolute that assurance in your heart of the Holy Spirit raise your hand say I want something out of punctuate the Word of God I see the word of God maiden minimus that's it mother when a man comes to Christ you don't want to take some preachers word some secretaries work some something else you Protestants don't take this better go to that absolute again and feel with the Holy Ghost in your CD the Bible being manifested of humility love through your life oh then that's your absolute and brother branham calls the pillar of fire and God and the Holy Spirit the absolute but it didn't work it failed Moses had that absolute Paul had to say an absolute the same pillar for the second Holy Spirit the same God now the hours will be them present it's always based upon all these quotes we can conclude that there is one absolute and that is Jesus Christ before we finish let's look at one often misunderstood brother branham quote the one absolute quote about brother Branham that some misunderstand is found in the church order sermon from December 26 1963 brother Branham says you kind of look to me to be your absolute it's got to come to one final absolute and my absolute is the word the Bible and as a pastor here of the church my absolute is the word and I know your brothers you kind of look to me to be your absolute to want as long as I follow God as Paul said in the scripture you follow me as I follow Christ and then I expect you brethren at any time that you see me to get away from this scripture to come to me privately and tell me or I'm wrong I don't care if you're one of the trustees of you're the janitor whoever you are you're duty-bound to me as a brother in Christ to tell me when I'm wrong scripturally if it's a question let's set out and solve it out together after listening this quote let's take into consideration the context in which brother Branham was speaking in first he was having a meeting with his Deacons and brothers in the church as well as the pastor brother Ormond Neville and he was setting the gifts in order like tongues prophecy and interpretation brother Branham began though by saying his absolute was the word and then he says the brothers kind of looked to him as an absolute please know that brother Branham never says Jesus is kind of the absolute brother Branham never hesitated about Jesus Christ being the one and only absolute so this means brother Branham was using a different definition of the word absolute he was using the definition that means in control or complete authority because he's speaking to the local church in Jeffersonville he said someone had to be the head or leader and this agrees with other quotes brother Branham made when he said the pastor has the complete or supreme authority of the local assembly but the full and complete authority of the church is the pastor read that new Bibles hit that's not bad Lord to be sure we're right brother branham then gives a scriptural reference for what he means that he's kind of an absolute he quotes first Corinthians 11 verse 1 in which Paul says to follow or imitate me as I imitate Jesus Christ so it is clear Paul did not want to be worshipped when he said follow me as I follow Christ nor did Paul want every person that heard him to exalt his every word to infallibility this is true because of two scriptures 1st Corinthians 7 12 Paul says but to the rest speak I not the Lord so here's a case where Paul differentiates his own word from God's Word a second example is in Galatians 1 verses 6 to 12 Paul says there's a curse upon anyone who adds or takes away from the gospel he first preached and he said if we or an angel so Paul puts himself in that category so Paul says there's a possibility that he could say something wrong so Paul is saying that even he cannot change the revelation that Jesus Christ gave him at the beginning when understood correctly brother Branham is saying the Brethren wanted to follow him like believers followed Paul yet even every word Paul said was not thus saith the Lord Paul says follow his Christ centered life like he tells the Thessalonians to follow the examples of other godly churches in the book of 1st Thessalonians where Paul told the church in Thessalonica to follow the example of the churches in Judea and Friends remember brother branham's message was to restore Paul's teaching not to change it we are resting on that in closing I hope you can see the evidence from the Bible and brother Rams own words that Jesus Christ is the one and only absolute friend brother randoms tapes are not the absolute but they do direct us to the absolute the unlimited all-powerful person of the Lord Jesus Christ I'll leave you with this quote in which brother branham prays for us to look away from him and see the omnipotent one Jesus Christ the Son of God that Christ might become the absolute to the entire congregation best of Trustees that man who stood with me so gracious in this great dark time that have been through stand with the church who prayed with me and stood behind me in times of trouble lord I love them and I offer my prayer that they will look to You Lord may they look away from this moral play of a service may they look to him who is the omnipotent who is and we know Lord that we are finite no matter who we are we're still mortal but not the messenger but the message granted Lord that's where we point to Jesus Christ the Son of God grant that he'll be so real to everyone here today even to the little children that he'll become the absolute of the into our congregation we asked in Jesus name Amen II [Applause] how are we singing again shake hands of somebody private how many how many feels you use your absolute the word he is the word give me that he is the word and the holy spirit Dermot eyes that word to make that life live in you of the word the vindication of the word but the word in your heart that the Holy Spirit come in and watch the word leave be humble don't desire to be a great somebody be a nobody that God can make you some please contact me if you have any questions or concerns about this video god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
