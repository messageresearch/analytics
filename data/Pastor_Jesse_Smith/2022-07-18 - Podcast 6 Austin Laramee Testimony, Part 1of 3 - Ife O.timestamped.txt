[0:00] through my
[0:02] sickness darkness
[0:06] jesus you got me through
[0:10] my addiction
[0:13] depression
[0:17] [Music]
[0:21] i
[0:25] am grateful that you thought of me
[0:30] and if right where i am is right where
[0:34] you are then i'm right where i'm
[0:37] supposed to be
[0:40] god bless you and welcome to the
[0:41] defending the message podcast i'm your
[0:43] co-host pastor jesse smith and here's
[0:45] our other co-host i'm amen on today's
[0:47] podcast we're going to look at a
[0:48] testimony of one of the believers in our
[0:50] church named brother austin
[0:53] we felt burdened to share people's
[0:54] testimonies because we know we'll be the
[0:56] help to other people the bible says in
[0:57] revelation chapter 12 we overcome by the
[0:59] blood of the lamb and the word of our
[1:01] testimonies
[1:03] so hopefully in the next few episodes we
[1:05] can get more testimonies of some of the
[1:06] saints in the church
[1:08] and post them on podcasts so that people
[1:10] can listen and be encouraged
[1:12] and we know every time that we talk
[1:14] about jesus sing about jesus think about
[1:16] jesus he comes near and the bible says
[1:19] wherever two or three are gathered there
[1:20] i am in the midst of you so we know
[1:22] talking about jesus testifying of jesus
[1:24] it blesses everybody and it brings the
[1:26] presence of the lord
[1:27] and so we're assured that brother
[1:29] austin's testimony will be a great
[1:30] blessing to you today so let's get into
[1:32] his life and see how
[1:34] the message of jesus christ has made a
[1:36] tremendous difference
[1:37] in fact has made all the difference in
[1:39] his life
[1:40] we'd also like to give a warning here at
[1:42] the beginning of this podcast that this
[1:44] episode has a lot of mature content
[1:47] so we do not recommend children listen
[1:48] to this episode our brother austin has a
[1:51] powerful testimony because god reached
[1:53] down and rescued him out of a life of
[1:54] despair
[1:56] even from the beginning of his life
[1:57] because austin was conceived in an act
[1:59] of rape
[2:00] and then grew up in a home full of
[2:02] domestic violence and drug abuse
[2:04] so during this podcast you'll hear
[2:06] different drugs mentioned such as
[2:07] alcohol cigarettes marijuana lsd
[2:11] hallucinogens vicodin xanax acid
[2:15] and also the selling of drugs
[2:18] you'll also hear that that austin's high
[2:20] school had students who would bring guns
[2:21] to school
[2:23] and of course as christians we do not
[2:25] support drug abuse domestic violence or
[2:28] any other gun violence
[2:29] but we felt it was an important part of
[2:31] austin's testimony
[2:33] showing how god's hand reached down to
[2:34] him in the depths of despair and rescued
[2:37] him transforming his life completely by
[2:39] the renewing of his mind according to
[2:41] romans 12 verses 1 and 2.
[2:43] we felt some of these details from
[2:45] austin's life would help certain
[2:46] individuals who have been trapped in
[2:48] drug abuse or domestic violence and his
[2:51] testimony would give them hope that god
[2:53] never leaves nor forsakes anyone and god
[2:55] is rich in mercy and mighty to save
[2:58] anyone who calls upon the name of the
[3:00] lord jesus christ
[3:02] we also hope you'll listen all the way
[3:04] to the end and you'll hear austin sing a
[3:05] song about this particular aspect of his
[3:07] testimony the lord gave him a song
[3:10] called right where i'm supposed to be
[3:12] and in the song austin talks about
[3:14] overcoming depression and suicidal
[3:16] thoughts and the song magnifies the
[3:18] grace of our lord jesus christ to rescue
[3:20] him save his soul and lead him into
[3:22] paths of righteousness for god's name's
[3:24] sake you heard a small portion of this
[3:26] song at the beginning of the podcast as
[3:28] well and with that we'll get started
[3:36] god bless you bro awesome great that
[3:38] you're here with us okay we're gonna
[3:40] start with the first question
[3:41] what was your childhood like in relation
[3:44] to learning about jesus
[3:46] hey uh god bless the listeners of this
[3:48] podcast um my childhood in relation to
[3:51] learning about jesus uh
[3:53] i grew up not really really super
[3:55] religious
[3:56] um
[3:57] i kind of went to church just a bit as a
[3:59] kid i went to baptist church i didn't
[4:01] really take it serious i was kind of
[4:02] there just for the candy for real
[4:04] and the fun stuff they would do
[4:06] you know my mom and dad didn't really
[4:09] push god on me at all growing up so i
[4:11] didn't
[4:12] i didn't really have any opinion about
[4:14] god or any true knowledge of jesus
[4:17] like my church as a kid kind of just
[4:19] taught me that once you're saved you're
[4:21] always saved just you know
[4:23] i remember a day in church they were
[4:25] like
[4:26] do you want to accept jesus into your
[4:27] heart and i was just like yeah
[4:30] and they're like all right
[4:32] let's pray and they're like
[4:34] pretty much just told me that
[4:36] if i just am sincere in his prayer
[4:39] that
[4:40] i accept jesus into my heart and then
[4:41] i'm saved and now i'm going to heaven no
[4:44] matter what now is what they told me you
[4:45] know i'm
[4:46] i'm saved i'm a believer now so i walked
[4:48] away from that i was like okay i was
[4:50] like cool i'm going to heaven now you
[4:51] know no matter what and
[4:53] i'm saved was my candy
[4:55] so you know i just
[4:57] so i didn't really go to church that
[4:58] much as a kid it was just a little bit
[5:00] but i went on my own accord though like
[5:02] i guess my mom told me i would just tell
[5:04] her i wanted to go to church randomly i
[5:06] just started going sometimes but
[5:09] so
[5:10] yeah pretty minimal minimal knowledge of
[5:13] jesus growing up as a at least a small
[5:15] child
[5:16] you said something there really
[5:17] important brother that most churches
[5:19] teach that salvation is only one work of
[5:22] grace they teach as soon as you say a
[5:24] sinner's prayer a scripted prayer they
[5:26] teach that you're saved sanctified
[5:28] filled with the holy ghost born again
[5:30] full of the power of god
[5:32] and yet that's a huge heir
[5:34] and i recently preached on that well i
[5:35] think last year i preached on that and
[5:37] the holy spirit just really brought that
[5:38] to my attention like that is an awful
[5:40] false doctrine
[5:42] and you experienced that i would say i
[5:44] experienced a similar thing when they
[5:46] when i was in assemblies of god and they
[5:48] told me to say jesus over and over again
[5:50] until i blabbered some words out and
[5:51] then everybody rejoiced like i got the
[5:53] holy ghost but i didn't
[5:55] i was crying i was emotional because of
[5:56] all the loud prayers but then i stuck a
[5:59] sucker back in my mouth and ran back
[6:00] outside to play baseball or whatever
[6:02] sport i was going to do so i just
[6:03] thought i would share that for our
[6:05] listeners to know that
[6:06] the churches most churches are preaching
[6:08] a watered-down doctrine
[6:10] and a scripted prayer doesn't change the
[6:13] heart it's when a heart really repents
[6:15] that's when the heart gets changed yeah
[6:17] i remember when i was learning about
[6:19] jesus in the church and when we would
[6:21] pray the prayer meant absolutely nothing
[6:23] to me as a kid like there was no emotion
[6:25] tied to it it was like a empty prayer
[6:28] you know just i was just saying words
[6:30] you know i was like i was just reading a
[6:31] book that i didn't like or something it
[6:33] was just it meant nothing like this
[6:35] emptiness
[6:36] i had no i was just saying it basically
[6:38] to get candy so
[6:40] and i believed it enough to keep going
[6:42] to church you know i believe jesus was
[6:44] real but he wasn't real to me by the
[6:46] church didn't make him real to me and
[6:48] they just didn't explain anything i
[6:51] would i was always confused you know
[6:52] sunday school was complete they just
[6:54] taught the basics god loves you jesus
[6:56] died for your sins but they didn't tell
[6:58] me how to repent or
[7:00] what repentance is or what even sin
[7:02] really is you know or they didn't really
[7:04] teach me anything you know i just
[7:07] learned the basics like god is good he
[7:09] loves you uh
[7:11] don't sin
[7:12] you're saved you're going to heaven
[7:13] that's it
[7:14] i was just like okay and as a kid you
[7:17] know
[7:18] not really going through a lot of things
[7:19] anyways uh i had really no need for
[7:22] jesus you know i was pretty happy kid
[7:24] for the most part
[7:25] so i just you know it's it wasn't real
[7:27] to me until later on in my life
[7:30] so i'd be pretty much my childhood was
[7:32] just pretty much lacking lacking real
[7:34] knowledge of jesus
[7:36] amen can you share that experience where
[7:39] your mom said you woke up and you talked
[7:41] about going back to heaven
[7:44] oh yeah that's crazy yeah
[7:46] uh i guess when i was like two years old
[7:49] um
[7:50] yeah this is real young yeah this is way
[7:52] back i was two years old
[7:54] and my mom said that i came out of my
[7:57] room at like three four in the morning
[7:59] one day and i and i just middle of the
[8:02] night just woke up out of my sleep and
[8:04] went to the living room and and looked
[8:07] at her and told her that god told me i
[8:08] was from the stars
[8:10] and that when i'm a teen he's gonna take
[8:12] me back home
[8:14] so from that point you know i don't know
[8:17] how old i was my mom first told me that
[8:19] but i remember not believing her you
[8:20] know and she said she wrote it down in
[8:22] her journal somewhere you know and like
[8:24] so my whole life she was just super
[8:26] overprotective of me especially when i
[8:28] turned 13
[8:29] you know because teen you know so so you
[8:32] thought i was gonna die she took that as
[8:33] you know i was gonna die because you
[8:35] know it sounds like if god's gonna take
[8:36] you home you're gonna you know you're
[8:37] going back to heaven you know so she
[8:40] thought i was gonna die so super
[8:42] protective
[8:43] and long story short we'll get to the
[8:45] the journey but long story short short
[8:47] when i turned 19
[8:49] i was introduced to the message you know
[8:52] and that's when i really got the
[8:53] knowledge of god and like amazing
[8:55] amazing story on how i even
[8:58] found the message so
[9:00] yeah so it's like a prophet prophecy you
[9:02] know early on in my life that came true
[9:04] one of many it's pretty crazy yeah
[9:07] pretty crazy prophetic thing that
[9:08] happened there
[9:09] it's almost like a prophecy for your
[9:11] life yeah
[9:13] so coming from the stars makes it sound
[9:14] like coming from heaven or coming from
[9:16] the mind of god and ephesians chapter 1
[9:18] says we were chosen in christ before the
[9:21] foundation of the world and actually
[9:23] abraham's seed is likened unto the stars
[9:25] god told abraham your seed is going to
[9:27] be like the stars the number of stars
[9:29] that they are so that's a very spiritual
[9:32] dream there and then going back home
[9:34] home would represent heaven or going
[9:36] back to the mind of god or coming back
[9:38] to god's original plan for your life
[9:40] right
[9:41] that's what that was too it wasn't death
[9:43] it was life amen
[9:45] hallelujah
[9:47] beautiful
[9:53] do you want to share about some of the
[9:56] mental things like just in general terms
[9:59] yeah i went through a lot of things
[10:00] mentally as a kid really like physically
[10:03] everything was kind of all right but
[10:04] mentally
[10:06] i mean it all started i mean at birth
[10:08] already
[10:08] i was already beating odds right like it
[10:11] goes hand in hand with being from the
[10:13] stars because at birth my mom was raped
[10:15] so and she kept me and the doctors told
[10:18] her she only had a 25 chance of ever
[10:21] even having a kid
[10:23] so when you know when she was pregnant
[10:25] she kept me you know and she feared that
[10:27] she wouldn't love me but she said as
[10:28] soon as she had me she fell in love so
[10:30] that was good
[10:31] and then so
[10:33] already off the bat you know that's like
[10:35] god's
[10:36] ordaining everything in my life so but
[10:39] growing up you know it was pretty pretty
[10:41] crazy in my house
[10:43] you know like outside i was kind of like
[10:45] a happy kid but inside i had a lot of
[10:47] demons i was battling
[10:49] from
[10:50] long as i can remember really so there's
[10:52] a lot of
[10:53] my stepdad
[10:55] was around since before i can remember
[10:57] and he was a crazy alcoholic he did
[11:00] drugs and stuff too he used to beat my
[11:02] mom you know they'd be arguing almost
[11:05] i don't know every night i can remember
[11:07] in my childhood there was a bad terrible
[11:09] argument in my house like
[11:11] terrible i mean it's not your average
[11:14] argument you know it's
[11:15] terrible things
[11:17] i just remember being scared all the
[11:18] time
[11:19] as a kid
[11:22] i remember
[11:23] somewhere along the lines getting a
[11:25] sense that i needed to protect my mom
[11:27] like as young as five years old probably
[11:30] i remember having to feel like i need to
[11:32] protect my mom
[11:33] and stuff and
[11:35] always being obsessed with like keeping
[11:37] my mom safe which a normal you know
[11:39] normal kid is that's not their first
[11:40] priority you know i mean everybody every
[11:42] kid's like oh i love my mom i love my
[11:43] dad but this was like a deeper
[11:45] need to save my mom you know protect my
[11:47] mom
[11:48] uh it's probably because of what was
[11:50] going on you know i saw what my dad was
[11:51] doing i felt helpless you know
[11:53] but then since he was my dad i thought i
[11:56] had to respect him and i thought this
[11:57] was normal you know i would i would
[11:59] think that all people were going through
[12:00] this at home
[12:02] you know so i just
[12:03] i didn't really talk about it with
[12:05] nobody and i always felt embarrassed
[12:07] sometimes because
[12:09] we were always a family on the street
[12:10] like the arguments would be so bad you
[12:12] would hear them you could hear them all
[12:13] the way down the street like you hear my
[12:15] parents yelling i was always that kid
[12:16] with the parents so oh it's your parents
[12:18] are yelling again you know so
[12:20] it's kind of embarrassing growing up
[12:22] so we were like that crazy family on the
[12:25] neighborhood you know
[12:26] yeah so it was like that
[12:28] so i used to always just uh
[12:31] i became like very sheltered and i never
[12:33] talked about my issues or nothing i just
[12:35] pretended i like everything was okay
[12:37] growing up
[12:39] never really was vocalizing anything to
[12:41] anybody you know i just held it all in
[12:44] because i just thought it was normal so
[12:46] i'm just like oh this is something
[12:47] everybody just got to go through you
[12:48] know it's nothing you know so
[12:51] it just
[12:52] made me like super depressed but i i had
[12:55] i feel like i had depression as a kid
[12:57] but i just didn't know i did
[12:59] you know because i'm too young to
[13:00] realize like i definitely had anxiety as
[13:02] a kid but i didn't know it as anxiety
[13:04] back then and then uh i used to have
[13:07] flashbacks or just
[13:09] i remember always trying to be a
[13:11] peacemaker with my parents because like
[13:12] i could sense the tension so i would
[13:15] always try to do things to be like oh
[13:16] just keep their minds off of arguing you
[13:19] know drinking
[13:21] and stuff and
[13:23] and so they're always drinking a lot you
[13:24] know there's a lot of alcohol
[13:26] lots of alcohol i hated alcohol as a kid
[13:29] i used to throw beers away
[13:30] tell my parents to stop drinking it was
[13:32] just this begging hated alcohol
[13:35] yeah it was like that all the way until
[13:38] high school graduated high school even
[13:40] like it was my whole
[13:42] whole childhood since i could remember
[13:43] it was just
[13:44] violence
[13:45] just utter violence really i mean the
[13:48] worst arguments you can imagine dude is
[13:50] terrible i could literally hear right
[13:51] now my head my dad yelling is terrible
[13:53] sick
[13:55] it's a shame i have to remember him like
[13:56] that but i forgive him you know but
[13:59] evil
[14:01] there was one word for my childhood i
[14:02] was happy at the same time mentally it
[14:05] was also sad like it was evil my
[14:06] childhood was evil but it was also very
[14:08] happy i can't ex
[14:10] sounds confusing man but i was a super
[14:12] happy kid
[14:13] but it was also
[14:15] when i had to go through that it was
[14:16] just terrible like i literally would be
[14:19] scared i'll be crying i will get up go
[14:21] hide in corners
[14:23] i remember my dad got me a dog he got a
[14:25] dog one time
[14:26] that helped me a lot it was probably
[14:28] like you were happy all day except for
[14:30] when the arguments would start yeah
[14:33] yeah it would be bad it would just wake
[14:34] me up in the middle of night sometimes
[14:35] you know just stuff throwing
[14:37] breaking all the time plates glasses and
[14:40] stuff and like
[14:42] sometimes i would like you know hide
[14:44] some of my toys because i didn't want
[14:45] them to be broke you know or i would
[14:48] i would like
[14:49] try to try to hide under my blankets you
[14:52] know and just ignore it
[14:53] i'll be scared you know and always
[14:56] always be so scared i remember uh so
[14:59] when he got me my dog
[15:01] i finally felt like i wasn't alone
[15:03] because it's like my dog got scared too
[15:05] my dog would literally
[15:07] when it happened he would literally like
[15:08] be shaking crying in the corner too so i
[15:11] i felt like i had a friend you know
[15:14] there was one time
[15:15] my parents you know were divorced when i
[15:17] was i think in seventh grade
[15:19] there was one time
[15:20] my parents were arguing
[15:22] and my dad that night he never did it
[15:24] except for this one night he went and
[15:26] bought some beer and he got drunk
[15:29] and i i remember watching them and he
[15:32] took his hand and he knocked down all
[15:33] these glass jars
[15:35] and i just i can still i can still see
[15:37] it
[15:38] i can still hear the glass
[15:40] you know i was just like
[15:42] i was shocked um
[15:45] that's really the only time though that
[15:46] i saw that to that degree so i can i can
[15:49] kind of you know
[15:51] understand a little bit you know just a
[15:53] little bit about that but just the
[15:55] impression that it has upon a child now
[15:57] this will be important later on
[15:59] because we'll see how the blood of jesus
[16:01] christ right
[16:03] operates in your life and so instead of
[16:06] taking on the traits of your stepfather
[16:09] you take upon the traits of a christian
[16:11] right and that's the power of the gospel
[16:14] amen
[16:21] so then when when did you finally
[16:23] encounter god
[16:25] and finally surrender to jesus
[16:27] all right so
[16:29] it's a good question so it leads you
[16:31] know so coming out of that childhood you
[16:33] know i get to high school in ninth grade
[16:36] i start you know
[16:38] you're a young you're a young dude
[16:40] you're in high school you're you're
[16:42] introduced to all these new things you
[16:43] know new crowds of people
[16:46] and i finally get my little crowd i get
[16:48] into skateboarding real hard it's just
[16:50] ways i would just
[16:52] i was super
[16:54] i would never be home really i would
[16:55] always be out and about skating with my
[16:57] friends just never trying to be home i
[16:59] hated being at home and i was not very
[17:01] close to my parents at this point in my
[17:03] life i barely talked you know i wasn't
[17:05] like i felt like my parents didn't even
[17:06] know the real me
[17:08] because i was so i didn't talk about
[17:09] anything
[17:10] you know and i just kind of shut out
[17:12] everything in the world like i just
[17:13] pretended nothing existed that was bad
[17:15] so it was like eventually it all caved
[17:17] in later in my life but
[17:19] uh so my whole it feels like my whole
[17:21] life i've held everything in so
[17:23] high school i start high school you know
[17:26] and i i start off really good half my
[17:28] year i'm really good you know
[17:29] some of my friends they'll start smoking
[17:31] weed and stuff you know doing cigarettes
[17:33] all that drinking but half halfway
[17:35] through freshman year i'm still the kid
[17:37] in the group that was just like i was
[17:39] scared i was i'll be scared to hang out
[17:41] with some of my friends after school
[17:42] because i just didn't want them to be
[17:43] like hey try this because i want to be
[17:45] the lame kid they'll be like oh i'm not
[17:46] going to do it you know you know how
[17:48] peer pressure and all that trying to be
[17:49] cool and none of that really matters but
[17:51] in high school it's so important to you
[17:53] so i'll be scared to hang out with my
[17:55] friends after school because i thought
[17:56] they were reckless but i really liked
[17:58] them you know
[17:59] and and they're a pretty good crowd good
[18:01] cool crowd like good values not like
[18:03] really bad kids it's just you don't
[18:04] think they're just smoking weed instead
[18:06] just doing things reckless like
[18:08] rebellious teenagers
[18:10] but i remember
[18:12] one day
[18:13] like halfway through my freshman year i
[18:15] remember like a week i was just thinking
[18:17] like all right i'm gonna try smoking
[18:18] weed man
[18:19] i started getting into music really like
[18:21] music was always
[18:22] very
[18:24] important to me and my stepdad was a
[18:25] musician too so i grew up around music a
[18:28] lot it was very important to me
[18:30] i like
[18:31] would find therapy through music
[18:34] i played music my whole life but i
[18:35] started really taking it serious in high
[18:37] school
[18:38] and started making beats like producing
[18:41] and all that and i i one i was just
[18:43] thinking about trying weed you know
[18:44] because i'm
[18:45] i'm just like all right i'm gonna try it
[18:47] and one morning i remember i woke up
[18:49] getting ready for school
[18:50] and there was a joint sitting on my
[18:52] table in my living room and i was like
[18:54] well
[18:55] this is it
[18:56] so i took the joint
[18:58] i laid it up smoked it on the way to
[19:00] school
[19:01] and then i went to school first period
[19:03] class
[19:05] and i looked at my friend you know one
[19:07] of my friend his name was jared i looked
[19:09] at him and i was like dude i just smoked
[19:11] weed for the first time i was like i
[19:13] found one of my dad's joints he must
[19:14] have forgot and left it on the table and
[19:16] i smoked it and he was like no he didn't
[19:18] really believe me i was like yeah you
[19:19] don't i always remember laughing the
[19:21] whole class and thinking it was awesome
[19:22] you know i'm just high so here we are
[19:24] i'm going through high school that was
[19:26] my first introduction to drugs you know
[19:27] and so i start that was like my first
[19:30] relief i'm like oh
[19:33] i don't feel this
[19:34] pain anymore i didn't realize i was
[19:36] depressed even in high school or had
[19:37] anxiety i didn't know what it was at
[19:38] that point but i just knew i didn't feel
[19:41] that weird
[19:42] feeling i was always feeling you know i
[19:43] could talk now i could i could laugh you
[19:45] know i could i could be a personality
[19:48] again you know and
[19:49] so i started
[19:51] music sounded really good so i started
[19:53] smoking a lot you know i started i was
[19:54] like oh i got to get this
[19:56] started doing smoking a lot of weed
[19:58] hanging out with my friends outside of
[20:00] school now i'm like you know joining
[20:02] them smoking weed i started drinking a
[20:04] bit but i didn't really like drinking
[20:05] because of my childhood i kind of didn't
[20:08] really get into drinking through high
[20:09] school just other things
[20:11] but sophomore year comes you know i'm
[20:12] still
[20:13] i'm still smoking weed but then i get
[20:15] introduced
[20:16] i start doing vicodin start doing xanax
[20:19] you know we just pills would come and i
[20:21] would just take them i start studying
[20:23] drugs because i just become infatuated
[20:25] with with
[20:26] mind altering substances and what they
[20:28] did
[20:29] to you so i just became infatuated with
[20:30] it so i just wanted to try everything so
[20:33] because i didn't feel anything anymore
[20:34] so i started doing lots of pills i
[20:37] started taking pills from my mom and she
[20:40] would think that the pharmacy was
[20:42] messing up but it was really me
[20:45] and and and i would go along with the
[20:48] lie i would disagree yeah the pharmacy
[20:49] you know they're probably messing your
[20:50] pills up is terrible like because i was
[20:52] so ashamed of what i was doing going in
[20:54] her purse taking her pills and stuff but
[20:56] i was just sometimes i would take her
[20:58] boxed wine and literally just to go to
[21:01] school i would have to chug like three
[21:02] glasses of wine just to go because i
[21:04] hated i was so depressed
[21:06] hated going to school
[21:08] i got bullied a lot sometimes because i
[21:10] was weird you know i was just that weird
[21:12] kid
[21:13] like everybody liked but also hated it
[21:15] it was weird like everybody hated me and
[21:16] liked me at the same time i didn't get
[21:18] it but it's because i was different like
[21:19] i wasn't scared to speak my mind
[21:22] so i would skip school a lot
[21:24] my life started really kind of falling
[21:26] apart in high school
[21:28] yeah so sophomore year i introduced
[21:30] i started taking lsd a lot of
[21:32] hallucigenics you know start taking acid
[21:35] i would take it in in class and i would
[21:37] tell my teachers you know like what i'm
[21:39] on what i'm seeing and it was like a
[21:41] really really
[21:43] really ghetto high school like i mean
[21:45] people had guns and stuff like people my
[21:47] friends would bring guns to school all
[21:48] the time like be showing me their guns
[21:50] in the bathroom like so it was like a
[21:51] really bad school
[21:53] you know my teachers would let me
[21:55] literally smoke because i was actually
[21:56] really smart in high school i got really
[21:58] good grades and then they saw me as
[22:00] smart but it's just i just didn't apply
[22:02] myself i was just like the outcast kind
[22:04] of person you know but i was always kind
[22:06] to everybody
[22:07] because i was just sad so uh
[22:10] and i hated when other people weren't
[22:12] kind to people because i would get
[22:13] bullied sometimes you know i was just
[22:15] weird you know so
[22:16] see i started taking lsd drinking more
[22:19] having parties you know just kicking it
[22:21] really hard i tried a lot of drugs but
[22:24] not really hard drugs until after high
[22:26] school so i get senior year you know
[22:29] and i i finally graduate
[22:31] with merit royal too my gosh chris has
[22:34] my merit role i graduate and literally
[22:38] and mind you this whole time
[22:40] my parents are still arguing drinking
[22:43] it's a wreck at home i hated going home
[22:46] i hated going i dreaded going home and i
[22:48] would always be high too and i was
[22:50] scared to tell my parents so i'll just
[22:51] go straight to my room sometimes or just
[22:53] not even come home until i'm completely
[22:55] sober and then i'll come home and just
[22:57] tell them oh good night going to sleep
[22:59] now wake up the next day
[23:01] and then yeah get high so
[23:03] so i graduate and boom
[23:06] literally probably a couple weeks after
[23:08] i graduate my dad gets a dui
[23:11] so he's he finally he's like all right
[23:12] i'm going to stop drinking da da i have
[23:14] a problem finally admits it
[23:16] and then literally a couple days after
[23:18] that dui he literally comes home super
[23:20] drunk and i just went off on them and i
[23:22] kicked them out i was like i'm done with
[23:23] this like i just kicked him out of the
[23:24] house
[23:25] but then you know we couldn't afford the
[23:27] bills literally like i was like oh man
[23:29] my mom was super mad at me but also not
[23:32] mad at the same time like because she
[23:33] was just battling you know how it is
[23:35] being abusive really you love the person
[23:37] but then it's not her fault but so after
[23:39] i kicked him out
[23:40] realized we couldn't really pay the
[23:42] bills
[23:43] so
[23:45] i had my friends move in for my friend
[23:47] matt my friend spencer and from that
[23:49] point my childhood home that house
[23:51] turned into a straight trap house i mean
[23:54] just
[23:55] my mom was super depressed so she
[23:56] stopped caring about anything
[23:58] i i didn't care about anything we just
[24:01] started doing all types of drugs started
[24:03] selling drugs out of the house had all
[24:06] types of people in all all through the
[24:07] night all the time while my mom was
[24:10] literally just in the back super sad
[24:12] drinking
[24:13] not even talking to anybody sometimes or
[24:14] just kicking it with us sometimes you
[24:16] know
[24:17] and then uh this is where everything
[24:19] fell apart i mean this is like the
[24:20] climax this is 2016 now i graduated
[24:23] 2015. this is 2016. we were doing that
[24:26] for like six months and
[24:28] it's not sustainable at this point
[24:29] anymore it gets real bad i mean it was a
[24:32] whole bunch of stuff going on in that
[24:34] house and then my mom started talking to
[24:36] this guy and mind you she was with my
[24:38] dad for like 18 19 years abusive
[24:40] relationship meant mainly the whole time
[24:43] and she had maybe been
[24:45] not with him at this point for a couple
[24:48] months met this guy started talking to
[24:50] him and she moved in with him within
[24:52] like two months
[24:53] and just kind of left us all at this
[24:55] house a little bit i mean she said i
[24:57] could go with them you know and live
[24:59] there but i didn't really want to i'm
[25:00] like nah i wasn't for it i was like mom
[25:02] what are you doing i didn't like nobody
[25:04] because i didn't trust anybody so
[25:06] i was just mean to the guy at first
[25:09] so eventually
[25:10] things came to an end we lost the house
[25:12] you know and this is six months after i
[25:14] graduated we lost the house and i was
[25:16] homeless i remember i would just go
[25:18] downtown akron you know just like sleep
[25:20] in parking decks and while all that
[25:21] happened i started i picked up guitar
[25:24] and i started just teaching myself how
[25:26] to play guitar i mean i was so depressed
[25:27] i was sitting in my room for hours
[25:29] straight i mean like eight nine hours
[25:30] straight until my fingers bleeding just
[25:32] learning how to play guitar i'm gonna
[25:34] start learning how to sing because
[25:35] people told me i could sing i didn't
[25:37] believe in myself though but i knew i
[25:38] loved music
[25:40] so i would go downtown and i remember i
[25:43] was being hungry and i would go and i
[25:45] told myself i would never beg
[25:47] that i had a talent god-given talent and
[25:49] and around this point i started kind of
[25:51] questioning god again i was an atheist
[25:53] through high school because i'm like god
[25:54] can't be real i just went through
[25:56] complete
[25:58] uh terror my whole life i'm like there's
[26:00] no god like there's no god i didn't
[26:01] believe in god anymore i was like no
[26:04] so i remember one i would go into
[26:06] restaurants and i would play
[26:08] music and ask them if they like my song
[26:11] if i could just have a sandwich
[26:14] in exchange for me playing and most of
[26:16] the time all the time they gave me a
[26:17] sandwich you know i don't know if i was
[26:18] out of pity or if they really liked my
[26:20] music but
[26:21] it was cool but one night i was sleeping
[26:22] in a parking deck and i was
[26:24] tired
[26:26] i was about to go home i was i was gonna
[26:28] walk home back to my house that we just
[26:30] lost my childhood home that i grew up in
[26:31] i was gonna break into it and sleep in
[26:33] it because i wanted to sleep on carpet
[26:35] so
[26:36] i remember in the parking deck i just
[26:38] was like all right
[26:39] i just got down on my knees
[26:41] and i just prayed how i knew how to pray
[26:43] i never learned but i just prayed from
[26:45] the heart i was i don't even remember
[26:47] what i said but i was like god i was
[26:49] like if you're real
[26:51] why am i going through this can you
[26:53] reveal yourself to me i was like just
[26:55] show me your real because i if there's
[26:57] any point i need you i need you now i
[26:58] was like i'm 19 years old
[27:01] going through i feel like i was like
[27:03] going through the worst thing any 19
[27:05] year old
[27:06] has ever been through even though i know
[27:08] my struggles are probably nothing
[27:09] compared to other struggles but it's
[27:10] just for me personally it was the
[27:12] hardest thing ever so
[27:15] i pray that prayer i'm just like god
[27:17] show yourself to me please anyway just
[27:19] show me that you're real
[27:22] so i ended it with that i went to sleep
[27:24] i woke up and i remember the next day i
[27:26] would just you know just do my daily
[27:27] walks around downtown
[27:30] and then when it got around night time i
[27:32] was like all right i'm gonna walk four
[27:34] hours
[27:35] across akron to get back to my old house
[27:37] and i'm gonna go break in and sleep in
[27:38] it and halfway through my journey i
[27:40] walked into a burger king
[27:42] and
[27:44] i just wanted some water
[27:46] so i had my guitar on my back you know
[27:48] that's all i had to just my guitar and a
[27:50] little backpack full of couple clothes
[27:53] and i walk in just for a glass of water
[27:56] i wasn't even hungry and this guy comes
[27:58] from the back
[27:59] he's like hey man he's like he's like
[28:01] you play
[28:02] right and i was like i have a guitar in
[28:04] my back i play
[28:05] and then uh
[28:06] he's like he's showing me something so
[28:08] i'm like all right sure so i started
[28:10] singing him a song you know that i wrote
[28:12] and i ain't believing myself you know so
[28:13] when i saw people's reactions and that
[28:15] they were shocked that i could actually
[28:17] sing or whatever i would be shocked i'm
[28:19] like oh you actually thought that was
[28:20] good i'm like oh man like
[28:22] i was like you really think that's good
[28:23] and he was like just jaw-dropped shocked
[28:25] so he was like man
[28:26] he was like where are you going i'm just
[28:28] trying to get home man i got to walk
[28:30] four hours he was like here's some bus
[28:32] money
[28:33] so i took the bus money went outside
[28:35] crossed the street waited for the bus it
[28:37] was supposed to come at midnight never
[28:39] came for some reason i don't know why i
[28:41] didn't come so i walked back into burger
[28:43] king and i gave him his money back
[28:46] and then
[28:47] he was just shocked that i walked in and
[28:49] gave his money back he was like you just
[28:50] came in here and gave me my money back
[28:52] i'm and i told him i'm like yeah man the
[28:53] bus didn't come so you know you gave me
[28:56] the money so here you go
[28:58] and he's like you know nobody would do
[29:00] that he was like what he's like so i
[29:02] guess that was a big thing for him you
[29:04] know that for me it was just regular
[29:05] because that's just why i like i didn't
[29:07] think that was a big deal basically he
[29:09] asked something i basically led to like
[29:11] i'm homeless you know i was actually
[29:13] just gonna go break into my old house so
[29:15] i could just sleep that i got tired of
[29:16] sleeping in parking deck so he told me
[29:18] he was like all right man look
[29:20] he started showing me that he does music
[29:22] you know that he has all these
[29:23] connections or whatever but just trying
[29:25] to show me that you could trust i guess
[29:27] i didn't trust him at all though but i
[29:29] was like
[29:30] i was an opportunist and i loved the
[29:32] adventure of life so i was just like all
[29:34] right i didn't trust nobody but
[29:37] he told me he was like listen
[29:39] you could stay in my house tonight
[29:41] you stay in my house i'm gonna have my
[29:42] brother meet you at the bus station
[29:45] so he met me at the bus station i walked
[29:47] there met his brother
[29:48] went to his house he got off at like 2
[29:50] a.m that night he got home
[29:52] told me he just got out of prison from
[29:54] four years three weeks ago
[29:56] and
[29:57] showed me his music but long story short
[30:00] he told me
[30:01] that his grandfather was a preacher and
[30:04] then him and his brother started talking
[30:06] about a guy named william branham and he
[30:08] was like did you know we had a prophet
[30:09] and i'm like oh we don't got no prophets
[30:11] you know it's ancient stuff like all
[30:13] these guys are in a cult you know so
[30:16] started telling me about about this
[30:17] church you know and this thing called
[30:19] the message
[30:20] and i was like huh
[30:22] it's weird
[30:23] and then a couple couple days later in
[30:26] comes
[30:27] pastor jesse smith
[30:29] right and i remember
[30:30] the first conversation i had the first
[30:32] sentence he said i remember in my head i
[30:34] was like if there's any guy that's close
[30:36] to god
[30:37] it's this man right here that i've ever
[30:39] met in my life it's this guy
[30:41] and then i was like okay god i'm like is
[30:44] this you answering my prayer because i
[30:45] mean the way i just met this random
[30:47] stranger just let me live in this house
[30:49] and from then on we became like brothers
[30:52] like him his brother and me like
[30:54] brothers still talk to this day and i
[30:57] lived with him for months at this point
[30:58] he helped me get on my feet taught me
[31:00] how to drive you know
[31:02] helped me
[31:03] learn a lot of street street knowledge
[31:05] you know
[31:07] and like taught me a lot a lot of things
[31:09] about life
[31:11] about music he was the first person
[31:13] besides my parents and my friends that
[31:14] really believed in me that told me
[31:16] you're gonna be you know a good singer
[31:17] you're gonna be this and i didn't
[31:19] believe in myself i didn't believe him
[31:20] but i still kept pushing on and now now
[31:22] you know i believe in myself
[31:24] in a godly way not pridefully but just
[31:26] like i accept i have a gift and i could
[31:28] sing and play
[31:30] so
[31:31] after i met brother jesse
[31:33] that's when you know i didn't believe it
[31:36] at first i thought it was a cult my mom
[31:37] thought i was in a cult
[31:39] because i've never heard none of this
[31:40] but
[31:41] i guess that's when i finally was really
[31:43] introduced to jesus and that's when i
[31:45] first developed my real relationship and
[31:47] i entered the message and then i
[31:50] repented got baptized you know i heard
[31:52] all this stuff and i was like yep that's
[31:54] god answering my prayer i'm like there
[31:56] it is i was like you're real so i
[31:58] believed it ever since and that was that
[32:00] was how i really got introduced to jesus
[32:03] that's how i needed him yeah but it took
[32:05] a long road of pain to
[32:08] get me to that point so
[32:10] that's how it happened that's how i was
[32:12] introduced to this message
[32:19] okay we're ending our first part on this
[32:21] testimony as there's many more stories
