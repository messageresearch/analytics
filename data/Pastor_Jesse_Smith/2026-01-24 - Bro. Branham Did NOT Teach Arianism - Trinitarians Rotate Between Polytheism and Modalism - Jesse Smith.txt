TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And she said, "WELL, NOW HOW COULD HE be divine and weep?" I said, "That was the man part weeping." &gt;&gt; Right? You failed to see he was Emmanuel. HE WAS BOTH MAN AND GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GREETINGS, FRIENDS, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to defend God's prophet, Brother Brandham, as a faithful Bible teacher regarding the Godhead. Recently, Brother Brandham has been accused of being a believer in Aryanism. And that's a false accusation. That's a lie. Brother Brham simply revealed the true understanding of the one person in the Godhead. And he denounced the false heretical polytheistic threeperson lie of the Trinity dogma. I was requested to make this video by a precious brother who saw this accusation. So, I appreciate the brother's desire to defend God's prophet, Brother Brandham. Brother Brham was a Holy Ghostfilled prophet of God, a faithful Bible teacher. And the truth is that trinitarians always have and always will add to the Bible. They'll be guilty of adding to the words of this prophecy. Some more than others. Some Trinitarians add more than others do to the Bible. And of course, Aryanism contradicts the Bible as well. Both trinitarianism and Aryanism are false. They contain contradictions against the scripture. So that's why in the thumbnail of this video, I showed how true believers have only one creed and that creed is Christ and Christ is the word of God. just like to remind you that some trinitarians go so far as to say that they must rotate between modalism and tritheism. Those are not my words. Those are the words of a prominent evangelical trinitarian scholar named Miller J. Ericson. I have his book. And he said, "We must quote, alternate between modalism, one God who changes appearance, and tritheism, three gods." End quote. Any true Christian will understand that he should not rotate between any air and truth. Christians should only believe and confess the truth of the word of God. Jesus said, "Thy word is truth." And yet millions, if not a billion or more trinitarians will rotate between the truth of God's word and tritheism. So it shows the shame and folly that should be on all trinitarians. But thank God for the truth of the word of God. Thank God for sending a prophet to finish the mystery of God. And one of those mysteries is the Godhead. So this is essentially a Godhead video. The Bible calls the Godhead a mystery in Colossians 2:2. And so that mystery was finished through the seventh angel, God's prophet, brother William, Mary, and Brandon. Let's go through four important points here by God's grace. First, we don't label ourselves trinitarians, aryens, modalists, or anything because all those labels have beliefs that limit God and limit his word. We're simply holy ghostfilled Christians who believe only the word of God. Last year, I had supper with a trinitarian pastor and we got into a debate right there in front of both our families. It was a kind debate, but it boiled down to this. I do not add any words to the Bible, yet he would freely add to the words of the Bible. I would call him a brother. He would not call me a brother. I would shake his hand and hug him. He would not shake my hand and want to hug me. So that shows the evil spirit that's on some Trinitarians, not all Trinitarians. Real Christians do not take labels that are man-made labels. They're simply Holy Ghost fil believers. Second, we believe every word in the Bible about the Godhead. The problem is that trinitarians add to the Bible. Arenism adds to the Bible or takes away from the Bible. Remember creeds and dogmas limit the holy one of Israel as Psalm says and they make the commandments of God of none effect especially the first commandment about worshiping only one God. Trinitarians again rotate between one God and three gods. That's according to their prominent scholar not according to me. Matthew 15 spoke of this verses 3 and six. Jesus said why do you transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? Trinitarianism, Aryanism are traditions of men and therefore they transgress the word of God. Verse six says, "You have made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition." So anytime a creed or dogma about the Godhead is created, it makes the commandments of none effect. The word of God does not affect the people in a good way. The creeds actually hurt the people. As we'll see, one of the main sins is pride that comes from these false doctrines. And that's the third point. These creeds actually produce the pride of life, which is an antichrist spirit. Of course, pride is an antichrist spirit and it's the antichrist spirit, a pride because it starts out as a deed. It's just a deed of the nickelans. Then it turns into a doctrine or the unbending way. And that's what we see. Trinitarians are unbending. They will just hold on to their creed that adds to the Bible. And the next step is the doctrine of Balum. And Balum was uniting unbelievers with believers. And that's exactly what happens in many of these trinitarian churches. They have unbelievers and believers sitting there. Fornication was the sin of the feast of bale pior. And that's exactly what we have in trinitarian churches. Many of them, not all, but many of them have fornicators sitting in there. And especially adulterers letting people marry two times, three times. That's basically the modern feast of Baal Peor right there in trinitarian churches. And again, it's so self-righteous. It's so prideful to say I can add three persons to the Bible. I can rotate with tritheism. That's the sin of pride. And think friends, this pride of life goes to all this effort to have these councils as we'll see with the council of Nika and so forth and now all the modern councils. They go to all these great lengths and efforts to defend their man-made religion, their commandments of men. They'll fight to the death for their creeds, their dogmas rather than the word of God. As one time an accuser, Brother Brandham said, "Don't you believe the giants of the faith?" And he was quoting trinitarians. That was such a sly, deceptive statement. No, the giants of the faith are the men who wrote the Bible. And they were never led to write God was three persons. So that was a sly, deceptive lie. Satan, but the Holy Spirit discerned that. The giants of the faith are those who wrote the word of God that never added to the word nor take away from the word of God. And the fourth point is remember there's eight problems with the trinity dogma. I have a two-part video series on this and I have numerous other video resources about the godhead. I wrote an entire chapter on the godhead in my 2021 book. It's chapter 1. I have videos about Genesis 126. Let us There's also a video about the positive uses Brother Ren has of the word trinity when it does not mean three persons. So please let me know if you have other questions about the Godhead. Perhaps I have a video about it already by God's grace. Next, let's look at quotes from brother Brandham about the godhead. Brother Brandham believed both in the full humanity of Jesus and the full deity of Jesus. For example, there's four quotes that say God, very God. Jesus was God, very God. So let's look first at the divinity of Jesus. It was fully God. Now there's four of them. I'll just read one of them. If people really want the truth, they'll go read all four. But Ram's talking about Jesus. He said, quote, "That which is right, for he bought that church with his own blood. That blood is the blood of God. The one who owns that church is God, very God. He is the first and the last. That title spells eternity. He was dead and is alive." End quote. So friends, that quote shows that could only be speaking of Jesus because God the father could never die. Brother Ram said Jesus Christ is God, very God. He was fully God, fully man. There's 38 quotes where brother Ram talks about supreme deity from 1954 all the way to the end of his life 1965 even in the church age book. I'll just read one of them. I'll read one of them from again the church age book about the supreme deity of Jesus Christ. Brother Ram says, quote, "Before he reveals the characteristics of the last age to us, he gives us one final look at his own gracious and supreme deity, this is the capstone revelation of himself. Thus saith the amen. Jesus is the amen of God. Jesus is the so be it of God." End quote. So we see brother Ram fully taught, clearly taught the supreme deity of Jesus Christ. Brother Ram even said Jesus was not a lesser God. He said this in 1959 conference with God. He's talking about Catholics. He said, quote, "But when you try to make Jesus a little lesser God than God, make him a lesser God, you cut his feet off, bring him down just a little bit under the head of God and make him a lesser God, you are so wrong. Jesus was man. He called himself the son of man." End quote. So clearly, Brother Ram said Jesus was not a lesser God. And all the other quotes say Jesus was God, very God. Now, I'll just read one quote to show how brother Raman believed in Jesus's full humanity. But it wasn't the same humanity as our humanity because our humanity is sinful. Jesus's humanity had a word nature, not a sin nature. Therefore, Jesus never sinned. So although he was fully man, fully human, he had a word nature unlike us. So his humanity is different than ours in that aspect. His nature was the word nature. In John chapter 1, the Bible says, "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us." It's a very important point to make. Let's look at this quote from a super sign 1962. Brother tells a story often of a Christian scientist woman who tried to tell him that Jesus was not divine because he wept at the grave of Lazarus. Brother Ram's preaching about the super sign from Isaiah, which was God coming in the flesh in his son. Brother Ram said, quote, "Born in a dirty, stinking stable. Little Jehovah, not laying in a pink basket in a hospital room. Emmanuel, the creator of heavens and earth with swaddling cloth on. Hallelujah. Little Jehovah playing as a kid." End quote. So, Brother Ram's not calling Jesus a second person. He's calling Jesus Jehovah. And then he went to the story about the Christian scientist woman talking about how Jesus wept. She said, "You brag too much on Jesus. You make him divine." Brother Ram said he was divine. She said, "Well, now how could he be divine and weep?" Brother Ram said, "Quote, that was the man part weeping." That's right. You failed to see that he was Emanuel. He was both man and God. He was a man going to the grave weeping. But when he pulled them little shoulders together and said, "Lazarus, come forth." And a man that had been dead four days and stinking come forth and lived again. That was that took more than a man. Right? End quote. So the first example brother Ram shows of humanity and deity is Jesus at the grave of Lazarus. We see both the man part and the God part. Then brother Ram gives three more examples. The second example was when Jesus fed the 5,000. He said quote he was a man when he come off the mountain that night hungry looking on a tree to find something to eat. But when he took five biscuits and two fish and fed 5,000 that was more than a man. That was the creator Jehovah. Right? End quote. So that was the second example. In the man part, he was hungry, but then the God part could create and multiply creation, multiply food. The third example, quote, he was a man when he was lying on that ship that night and 10,000 devils of the sea swore they would drown him, looked up and said, "Peace be still. That was more than a man. That was God who could steal the waves of the sea." End quote. So the third example is Jesus speaking to the storm, saying, "Peace be still. He could control nature." So we see the man part sleeping. Then we see the God part controlling nature. And the fourth example was Jesus on the cross. Quote, it was a man that cried for mercy at the cross. My God, why hast thou forsaken me. But on Easter morning when he broke the seals of death, hell, the grave, and rose up again and said, I am he that was dead and alive forever more. That was more than a man. That was God and his son. End quote. So the fourth example is Jesus's humanity could be forsaken by the deity of Jesus, which was God. And like what brother Ram said, every man that's ever amounted to a hill of beans believe that. Hallelujah. The same is true today. Every man that'll mount to hill of beans believes in both the humanity of Jesus and the divinity of Jesus, the supreme deity, God, very God, God in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself. Now friends, let's go through two sources here to prove brother was not into aranism. The first source is from the encyclopedia of Britannica online. I just search Aryanism on the website. So, let's go through this and I'll bring out my points. I basically copied and pasted the text onto this file. So, I'll put this on the screen. You can see the text from the website Britannica is in white, but then my thoughts are in yellow highlight. Now, again, remember with trinitarianism and Aryanism, you're going to have some things true, some things false. I'll begin here. What is Aryanism? Arenism a christoologgical position in Christianity originated in the early 4th century with Aras and Alexandrian preser. It posits that Jesus as the son of God was created by God not of the same substance. Now let me stop right there and share some thoughts here. Friends, trinitarians fail to see that Jesus as a man had three parts just like 1 Thessalonians 5:23 says, body, spirit, soul. And they also fail to identify which part of Jesus's existence they're referring to. In other words, are are they referring to the existence of Jesus before the foundation of the world or during his earthly life when he was in flesh or his life after the resurrection now that he's in a glorified body? But regarding Aryanism saying Christ is not of the same substance, that's true in one way. God is a spirit. So the flesh of Jesus wasn't the same substance proven by the fact that the body of Jesus could die but the spirit of God cannot die. But Jesus and the father had the same nature. They had a holy nature again because the father's holy. Jesus prayed to the father and said holy father. And Jesus' nature was a holy nature. He had a word nature not a sin nature. So Jesus's body was created by God along with Jesus's human spirit. But the soul or nature of Jesus was not created because it was God's spirit because that's where the spirit dwells in the soul. And the Bible said Jesus was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. That fullness was in his soul. Now notice that fullness was not in his mind because Jesus even said, "I don't know the day or the hour, nor do the angels know. Only the father knows the day and the hour of my return." Of course, Jesus' flesh, while he was alive, before he died, did not have the fullness of the godhead body because again, Jesus' flesh could die, but God's spirit can never die. Now, let's go to the points on Arenism from Britannica. There's five points we'll read here. First, Aryanism stresses God's uniqueness, setting him apart as self-existent and unchanging. That's true. There's nothing wrong about that. God the Father is self-existent and unchanging. Now second views the sun as mutable. So aranism views the sun as mutable. Now friends, Jesus' flesh was able to change. Mutable means able to be changed. To deny this is to deny the Bible. Jesus' flesh increased in wisdom. The Bible said his flesh of course grew from a baby to a child to a teenager to an adult. His flesh then died and then his flesh was raised back to life. So his body was mutable. His human body, even his human spirit was mutable. For again, he did not know the day and the hour of his coming. His will of his human spirit was different than the father's will because he prayed in the garden of Gethsemane, "Not my will, but thy will be done. His human spirit could be tempted, but God's spirit could never be tempted." But now that Jesus is in a glorified body, his human spirit can no longer be tempted. So see friends, the son was mutable in some ways. Now the second point of aranism is the son created from nothing. Now friends that's true. The body of Jesus was created from nothing. God's spirit overshadowed Mary and created the body of Jesus. Anyone that denies that denies the Bible. Now the spirit of God in Jesus' soul was uncreated because that's God's spirit. Now the next part says and not having direct knowledge of the father. Well, this is the one part of Aaronism that is heresy. Jesus specifically said he had glory with the father before the foundation of the world in John 17:5 and also Matthew 11:27 which shows Jesus already knew the father. The son is the only one who knows the father according to Jesus again Matthew 11:27. The third point here on the Bratannica website is Aaronism was denounced as heresy at the first council of Nika in 3:25 which affirmed that Christ is of one substance with the father. End quote. Now friends, the truth is only Jesus' soul anointed with the fullness of the godhead bodily was of one substance with the father. To deny that is again to deny the Bible. It denies Jesus' flesh and Jesus's human spirit while he was alive on earth before his death. Jesus' flesh could not be the same substance because it could die and be tempted. But we could say Jesus flesh shared the same nature as the father. For Jesus's nature was sinless. If trinitarians deny this, they deny the Bible, which some of them will freely do in order to justify their sinful man-made creed. They love the creed more than the word of God. The fourth and fifth points I'll just read. Aryanism was popular throughout much of the western and eastern Roman empires even after it was denounced as a heresy. The christologology of Jehovah's Witnesses can be considered a form of Arenism. There's one more part I copied from the Bratannica. One more paragraph. It says, "What did Aerys teach about Jesus? Aris taught that Jesus Christ was created by God and thus had a beginning." Now, here's what I want to say about that. Jesus Christ in one way did have a beginning. Even the visible light logos, the celestial body that was visible had a beginning. It was when God said, "Let there be light." And when God said, "Let there be light," that wasn't the light of the sun or stars. Because we find that later in Genesis 1, those lights were created later. Plus, Jesus's physical body and human spirit had a beginning since even Jesus's human spirit grew or waxed strong in spirit according to Luke 2:40, which means it was not equal to the father. So Jesus's human spirit while he was a child, while he was alive, before he died, was not equal to the father because God cannot increase his strength. To deny that, any trinitarian that would deny that would deny the Bible. Now let's go back to this paragraph here about Aras. So he taught Jesus Christ was created by God and thus had a beginning differing from God's unique self-existent and immutable nature. He stressed God's uniqueness suggesting the son was not eternal or of the same essence of the father. This view was considered a heresy by the early church because it undermined the concept of the trinity and of the full divinity of Christ. Now, regarding this point where it says Aaronism said the son was not eternal or of the same substance as the father. Well, that's true in one way and trinitarians would have to admit this because Jesus flesh did not have the same essence of the father because Jesus' flesh could grow and learn and didn't know all things and could die. But God the father could never grow, learn, lack knowledge or die. So if trinitarians deny that they're denying the Bible. So it all depends friends. What part of Christ are you talking about? Are you talking about his human body, his human spirit, his soul? Are you talking about how he existed as the logos before the foundation of the world? Are you talking about why he lived on earth before he died? Or are you talking about his current state now in a glorified body after the resurrection sitting at the right hand of the majesty on high? So hope that was helpful, friends. Let's go to the Aanian creed, which is the second source. I quoted this a couple times in my 2021 book. And again, in the Athanian creed, some things are true, some things are false. And this creed is so confusing, which is so different from the Bible. The Bible's so plain. The Bible's so easy to understand. But these creeds are so confusing. No wonder because the creed came from the mother harlot, the Roman Catholic Church, and the mother harlot, mystery Babylon. Mystery confusion. So rather accepting the word of God which is simple easy to understand they create their own creed which causes so much confusion. I think I have six points in my book where I disagreed with the Aanian creed which was the 6th century trinitarian confessional. First the creed says we worship God in a trinity but Jesus said we worship God in spirit and in truth. The Bible never says we worship God in trinity. When Jesus was asked about God, he went back to the shima. Deuteronomy chapter 6. Here, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. It never said here, O Israel, the Lord our God is three persons. So, we do not worship God in a trinity. We worship God as one person. Second, the creed says the son uncreated. But again, the Bible says the flesh of Jesus was created or made of a woman. And Jesus even calls himself the beginning of the creation of God. So how can the creed call him uncreated when Jesus himself said he was the beginning of the creation of God? Jesus said before Abraham was I am the great uncreated I am dwelt in the body of Jesus of Nazareth. So again the body was created. The spirit of Jesus which was the spirit of God was never created. Thirdly, the creed says the sun unlimited. But the Bible says Jesus's human knowledge was limited for it did not know the identity of the woman with the blood issue who touched him. Nor did he know the day and hour of his second coming to earth. The fourth point is the creed says the son is of the father alone. But the bible says Jesus' body was conceived of the holy ghost not specifically naming the father in the womb of Mary. So the creed denies the Holy Ghost as the father of Jesus which anols Matthew 1:20. If the creed is true then Jesus has two fathers since the one who conceives a child is the father. So the truth is that the Bible reveals the father and the holy ghost as the self-same person not two separate persons. Fifth the creed says none is greater or less than another but Jesus declared different in John 14:28. He said the father is greater than I. So the truth is that the flesh of Jesus was mortal during his earthly ministry, but God the father is a spirit and has been and always will be immortal. And six, and finally, the creed says, "God is three persons, but the Bible never uses that language to describe God because he is one person." Hebrews 1:3 says, "The son is the express image of the person of God." Notice one person of God. I always point Trinitarians to that verse. It never says Jesus was the second person. He's the image of the person, the one person of God. As Colossians 1:15 says, Christ is the image of the invisible God, not a second person, but the visible image of the one person of God. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. I don't want to go too long on this, but just want to quickly prove by God's grace that Brother Ran was a faithful Bible teacher, a true prophet of God. God revealed to him the mystery of the Godhead, that God is one person, not three persons. I hope you can see plainly that brother Ram did not teach aranism. Brother Ram taught Bible doctrine. Brother Ram taught the Bible in its purity. Both trinitarians and Aryans add to the word of God and take away the word of God. So there's awful repercussions for that. As the Bible says, "Add thou not to his words, lest thou be found a liar." As Proverbs 30:es 5 and 6 says, friends, brother Ran wasn't perfect. He didn't preach everything precisely right. And again he did grow in revelation. Remember 1952 he said that the third person the trinity burned in their hearts and he was so happy about it. But then by 1960 he said three persons was of the devil. So he grew in his revelation. He's grew in his knowledge of God. Just like the Bible said grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord. But by the end of his ministry he had the revelation exactly right on the Godhead. God is one person not three persons. People will keep trying to slander God's prophet brother Brandham. But friends, heaven and earth shall pass away, but God's word will never pass away. The word of God, brother taught, will not pass away. So, we thank the Lord for that. Thank God that we receive the seventh church age messenger, the forthcoming of the spirit of Elijah, a son of man revealing the son of man, a prophet messenger to the Gentiles before the return of the Lord Jesus Christ in the rapture. If you have any other Godhead questions, please let me know by God's grace. We'll pray about it and see what the Lord leads us to do as far as videos in the future. If you have any questions or concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. is never fails.
