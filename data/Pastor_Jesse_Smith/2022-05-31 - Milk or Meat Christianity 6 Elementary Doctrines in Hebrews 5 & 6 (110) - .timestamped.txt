[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the name above all
[0:11] names the lord jesus christ
[0:13] the purpose of this video is to show the
[0:15] difference between milk christianity and
[0:18] meet christianity
[0:20] the inspiration from this video came
[0:22] from a recent sermon i preached and
[0:23] while i was preaching i felt like the
[0:25] holy spirit gave me a little more
[0:27] insight into this context
[0:29] regarding the scriptures of hebrews
[0:30] chapter 5 and hebrews chapter 6.
[0:33] while preaching on these scriptures
[0:35] i found that a believer could recognize
[0:37] where they are in the three works of
[0:39] grace whether they're in justification
[0:42] sanctification or the baptism of the
[0:44] holy ghost based upon the word that they
[0:46] were hearing and living by the grace of
[0:48] god so let's begin with the context of
[0:51] hebrews chapters five and six and then
[0:53] we'll look at the six doctrines that are
[0:55] needed for a justified christian and a
[0:58] sanctified christian
[1:00] the context of hebrews chapters 5 and 6
[1:04] beginning in hebrews 5 verse 10 the
[1:06] bible says called of god and high priest
[1:09] after the order of melchizedek speaking
[1:11] of jesus christ verse 11 says of whom we
[1:14] may have many things to say and hard to
[1:17] be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing
[1:20] so the hebrews author likely paul tells
[1:22] these hebrew christians their doll of
[1:25] hearing or their slow of understanding
[1:28] regarding melchizedek and jesus christ
[1:30] this should make us grateful that our
[1:32] prophet william branham preached on who
[1:34] is this melchizedek in 1965
[1:37] which provided us great revelations
[1:39] regarding the godhead
[1:42] notice the writer likely paul had more
[1:44] to say about melchizedek and jesus
[1:46] christ
[1:48] but he knew the hebrew christians could
[1:49] not handle that type of preaching
[1:52] verse 12 tells us why for when for the
[1:55] time you ought to be teachers you have
[1:57] need that one teach you again which be
[1:59] the first principles of the oracles of
[2:01] god
[2:02] and are become such as have need of milk
[2:05] and not of strong meat this scripture
[2:08] shows the truth that christians should
[2:10] mature in their understanding so they
[2:12] can teach others about the christian
[2:14] faith
[2:16] but if they're not able to do that that
[2:17] shows they have not moved on in their
[2:19] walk with the lord they've been slow or
[2:21] sluggish as paul said dull of hearing
[2:24] and they need to be taught the same
[2:26] things that they already learned again
[2:29] which paul says they have need of milk
[2:31] and not of strong meat
[2:33] so milk christianity is someone who gets
[2:35] saved but then doesn't
[2:37] grow in their knowledge and
[2:39] understanding of the gospel of the lord
[2:41] jesus christ
[2:42] this is something to consider how many
[2:44] believers today really understand the
[2:46] faith and could teach sinners about how
[2:48] to repent be sanctified and be filled
[2:50] with the holy ghost
[2:52] in hebrews 5 13 it says for everyone
[2:54] that uses milk is unskillful in the word
[2:57] of righteousness
[2:58] for he is a babe
[3:00] the word unskillful means
[3:02] inexperienced in other words christians
[3:04] can have an initial experience with
[3:06] repentance but they must have more
[3:08] experiences with god
[3:10] they must grow in their faith they must
[3:12] mature
[3:13] and experience god in new ways in other
[3:15] words they must be justified and then
[3:17] experience sanctification as well
[3:20] if not paul says they're a babe they're
[3:22] just a baby christian and then verse 14
[3:24] gives us a beautiful text but strong
[3:26] meat belongs to them that are of full
[3:28] age even those
[3:30] who by reason of use have their senses
[3:32] exercised to discern both good and evil
[3:36] so here paul tells us those that are
[3:39] full age mature christians eat strong
[3:42] meat
[3:43] or listen to meaty sermons and then he
[3:45] tells us what these sermons consist of
[3:48] they consist of preaching that helps
[3:50] them discern both good and evil
[3:53] so milk sermons are more general sermons
[3:56] about jesus and christianity in general
[3:58] terms but meaty sermons help a christian
[4:02] discern good and evil in their daily
[4:04] lives
[4:05] and the bible says their senses are
[4:07] exercised to discern
[4:09] now the word exercise in the greek means
[4:12] to exercise vigorously
[4:14] in any way either the body or the mind
[4:17] the word use means a habit
[4:20] whether of the body or mind
[4:22] and so christians that eat strong meat
[4:24] have made it a habit to daily discern
[4:26] good and evil in their lives
[4:29] mature christians daily exercise their
[4:31] discernment to be able to judge and
[4:33] detect if something is good or evil if
[4:36] this is a good influence in their life
[4:38] or a bad influence in their life
[4:41] so based upon these beautiful scriptures
[4:42] so far we can see someone who is
[4:45] justified can only hear milk preaching
[4:48] general sermons about christianity
[4:50] but as a christian becomes sanctified he
[4:52] needs more mature sermons
[4:54] sermons that will help him to see good
[4:56] and evil in his daily life and of course
[4:58] repent of the evil and cleave to the
[5:00] good
[5:02] this means the more mature christians
[5:04] will be able to discern good and evil in
[5:05] their lives
[5:07] and as god's prophet brother branham
[5:08] said the closer we get to the light the
[5:11] more we see our imperfections
[5:13] in blind bartimaeus 1957 brother branham
[5:16] said speaking of daniel curry quote and
[5:19] it began to get lighter lighter lighter
[5:22] no certain place it was coming from and
[5:24] he began to slow up and said then all of
[5:26] a sudden he came to a stop and there was
[5:28] the brightest light he had ever seen in
[5:30] all his life
[5:31] it was a thousand times brighter than
[5:33] the midday sun
[5:35] and he said he heard a voice saying
[5:37] daniel curry did you ever steal anything
[5:38] when you were on earth
[5:40] you were here at my judgment seat and he
[5:42] said i thought i'd been a honest man but
[5:45] said in the presence of that light i
[5:47] realized that there were some things i
[5:49] had pulled little shady deals i didn't
[5:52] think about it when i was on earth but
[5:53] in the presence of that light he said
[5:55] then he said yes lord i have stole end
[5:58] quote
[6:00] how are you rising god the more sinful
[6:03] the whole thing looks
[6:06] and then sometimes in prayer you can
[6:08] imagine
[6:10] when the holy spirit
[6:13] take you up into a sphere
[6:16] then the whole thing looks chaos
[6:19] then when you come back down you seem
[6:21] like you're
[6:21] to the people you're a rascal
[6:24] that's your you're nothing but an old
[6:27] sarcastic
[6:30] but when we come here we are here for
[6:34] one pacific purpose
[6:36] this is the house of correction
[6:39] this is the throne
[6:42] this is the throne of god
[6:45] and judgment goes forth from the house
[6:48] of god
[6:49] and here's where we come together
[6:52] get in love with one another as only
[6:54] christians can't love but in here we are
[6:58] we are under a uh
[7:01] a leadership of the holy spirit
[7:05] the holy ghost is among us
[7:08] and we're here to be to take awakening
[7:11] among us to see where our short places
[7:15] are or shortcomings and how can we catch
[7:19] from where we should be over to where we
[7:22] ought to be now where we are where we
[7:24] ought to be
[7:25] and that's what
[7:27] we study
[7:28] ministers study those places for other
[7:31] people when they see the people they
[7:33] laugh then they begin all that
[7:38] as we grow as christians and become more
[7:40] like christ
[7:41] the more our character is shaped into
[7:43] the character of christ the brighter the
[7:45] light of god shines upon our daily lives
[7:47] and we see our great need to grow in
[7:49] righteousness and godliness
[7:52] as even saint paul said o wretched men
[7:54] that i am
[7:55] who shall deliver me from this body of
[7:57] death
[7:58] but thanks be to god who gives us the
[8:00] victory through our lord jesus christ
[8:03] we never want to become complacent as
[8:05] christians
[8:07] we don't want to be baby christians
[8:09] we want to receive the word that we need
[8:11] for this season of our life whether
[8:13] we're a new christian and we need the
[8:15] milk of the word or if we're an
[8:16] experienced christian and we become dull
[8:19] of hearing and we need to go back and
[8:20] relearn the things we've already learned
[8:22] in order that we can grow and mature and
[8:24] be able to receive the deeper teachings
[8:26] of god's word
[8:28] the six doctrines that are needed for a
[8:31] justified christian and a sanctified
[8:33] christian
[8:36] moving on to hebrews chapter 6
[8:38] verse 1 says therefore leaving the
[8:40] principles of the doctrine of christ let
[8:42] us go on unto perfection
[8:45] in the greek the word perfection means
[8:47] one who has in his own person raised
[8:49] faith to its perfection and so set
[8:52] before us the highest example of faith
[8:56] so this is speaking of christian
[8:57] maturity
[8:58] let us go on unto christian maturity
[9:01] and notice then paul lists six doctrines
[9:04] that are principle or elementary or
[9:06] beginning doctrines that we must master
[9:10] first is repentance from dead works
[9:12] second and of faith toward god
[9:15] in verse two
[9:17] third of the doctrine of baptisms
[9:20] fourth and of the laying on of hands
[9:22] fifth and of the resurrection of the
[9:24] dead
[9:25] and sixth of eternal judgment
[9:30] then verse three says and this we will
[9:32] do if god permit
[9:34] so god must permit
[9:36] or allow us
[9:37] to move on from milk to meat
[9:40] and of course god will allow this
[9:43] if we obey him and the current word he's
[9:45] revealing to us at this particular time
[9:47] of our lives
[9:49] if we're faithful with the word he's
[9:50] bringing to us now then no doubt he'll
[9:52] permit us to move on to the next word
[9:54] that we need to receive
[9:56] the more mature word that we need to
[9:58] grow by
[10:00] let's look at the first doctrine which
[10:02] is repentance from dead works
[10:04] friends i can hardly emphasize the
[10:07] importance of this first doctrine
[10:09] repentance from dead works is the first
[10:11] step to becoming a christian this should
[10:13] remind us of acts 2 verse 38 which says
[10:16] repent and be baptized every one of you
[10:18] in the name of jesus christ
[10:20] it's beautiful to see the continuity of
[10:22] the scripture
[10:23] peter in acts 2 38 gives us the first
[10:25] step repentance
[10:26] which is here the first step paul gives
[10:28] us in hebrews chapter 6 it is also the
[10:31] first sermon john the baptist preached
[10:33] and jesus preached
[10:35] for the scripture says they preached
[10:37] first repentance for the kingdom of
[10:39] heaven was at hand according to matthew
[10:41] 3 verses 1 and 2 for john the baptist
[10:44] matthew 4 verse 17 for jesus
[10:47] because the scripture says from that
[10:49] time jesus began to preach and say
[10:51] repent for the kingdom of heaven is at
[10:53] hand
[10:55] this repentance from dead works is so
[10:57] crucial for a christian to grow
[11:00] out of justification and into
[11:02] sanctification
[11:03] saint paul calls dead works works of the
[11:06] flesh
[11:07] and he speaks of 16 of them in first
[11:09] corinthians 6 verses 9 and 10 and
[11:12] galatians 5 verses 19 through 21
[11:16] i'm going to quickly name them and
[11:17] define them so you will know how
[11:19] important is for christians to repent
[11:21] from dead works
[11:23] the first is effeminate which is child
[11:25] molestation
[11:26] the second is abusers of themselves with
[11:28] mankind which are sodomites and
[11:30] homosexuals
[11:32] third are covetousness and envy which is
[11:35] greedy gain eager to have more what
[11:37] belongs to others
[11:39] fourth is drunkards becoming intoxicated
[11:41] by any form of alcohol
[11:43] fifth is revilers a which is a
[11:46] complainer or someone who protests
[11:48] rashly
[11:50] next is uncleanness which is lustful and
[11:52] luxurious living
[11:54] needing the fanciest clothes the best
[11:56] cars the best electronics
[11:58] next is lashiviousness which is
[12:00] unbridled excess
[12:02] it's lust without any sense of shame or
[12:05] lawlessness
[12:07] next is witchcraft which is which is
[12:09] sorcery or magical satanic arts
[12:12] poisoning and the administration of
[12:13] drugs
[12:15] of course drug use is a huge problem in
[12:17] this society
[12:18] the next is hatred which is enmity or
[12:20] intense dislike or ill will the tenth
[12:24] one is variance which is contention
[12:26] heated disagreements maintained in
[12:28] arguments
[12:30] the eleventh is emulation which is
[12:31] fierce jealousy rivalry pursued
[12:35] twelfth is wrath passionate anger
[12:37] boiling up
[12:38] 13th is strife a desire to put oneself
[12:41] forward electioneering for some position
[12:44] and friends all these definitions are
[12:46] from the greek lexicon
[12:48] 14th is seditions which are dissentions
[12:51] and divisions
[12:52] fifteenth are heresies teaching your own
[12:55] tenants opinions for followers and
[12:58] sixteenth is revelings which are
[13:00] nocturnal riotous frolicsome loud
[13:03] parties that go late into the night
[13:06] friends consider this list of 16 sins
[13:09] how many christians do you know that
[13:11] repent from all these dead works
[13:14] in first corinthians 6 and galatians 5
[13:16] paul says those who commit these sins
[13:18] cannot inherit the kingdom of god in
[13:20] other words if we don't repent from
[13:21] these dead works we'll never be born
[13:23] again by the baptism of the holy ghost
[13:25] into the kingdom of god because jesus
[13:27] said the kingdom of god is within you in
[13:30] luke chapter 17.
[13:32] before we move on to the second doctrine
[13:34] consider how many churches teach
[13:36] repentance from dead works
[13:38] and do they teach repentance from all 16
[13:40] of those dead works perhaps there could
[13:42] be even more dead works
[13:44] it'd be a lengthy study to see if there
[13:46] were even more dead works than what i
[13:48] just listed out of those 16
[13:50] consider jesus said few that would find
[13:52] the narrow road
[13:54] so based upon jesus's words and paul's
[13:56] words few christians will be meek
[13:58] christians most will be milk christians
[14:02] accepting salvation and reaching the
[14:04] first step of grace which is
[14:06] justification by faith
[14:08] they'll have faith in the blood of jesus
[14:09] christ of faith in the gospel the good
[14:12] news of salvation through our lord jesus
[14:14] christ but how many will move on deeper
[14:17] in the christian faith into full
[14:19] sanctification and then into the baptism
[14:21] of the holy ghost
[14:22] it's quite a sobering thought
[14:25] the second doctrine is faith toward god
[14:27] in the greek faith means assurance so
[14:30] christians after being taught to repent
[14:32] should be taught to have assurance in
[14:34] god
[14:35] of course that means his written word
[14:36] and also a spoken word which you might
[14:38] receive through a dream a vision or some
[14:40] other spiritual gift
[14:42] but the main thought here is to have
[14:44] faith toward god assurance in god
[14:47] and not to put your hope or trust in
[14:50] money or riches
[14:51] as jesus said you can only serve one
[14:53] master
[14:54] god or mammon which is riches
[14:57] how many christians mature enough where
[14:59] their faith is not in their job
[15:01] but their faith is in god himself and
[15:03] his holy word
[15:04] the third doctrine is the doctrine of
[15:06] baptisms
[15:08] according to my studies there's at least
[15:09] three kinds of baptisms first there's
[15:12] water baptism which should be
[15:14] administered by speaking the full name
[15:16] of god which is the lord jesus christ
[15:19] there are very few churches that teach
[15:20] this
[15:21] so again this shows how very few
[15:23] christians will move on out of milk
[15:25] christianity and to meet christianity
[15:28] the second baptism is the baptism of the
[15:31] holy spirit in the human mind or spirit
[15:34] this is the spirit filling that old
[15:36] testament saints had before jesus christ
[15:38] died and resurrected
[15:40] and also includes saints like elizabeth
[15:43] zacharias and john the baptist
[15:46] recorded in the gospels
[15:49] john chapter 7 verses 37 through 39 say
[15:51] the holy ghost could not be given until
[15:54] after jesus christ was glorified which
[15:56] they received on the day of pentecost in
[15:58] acts chapter 2.
[15:59] so that means every person who was
[16:01] filled with the spirit before acts
[16:02] chapter 2
[16:04] had the filling or baptism of the spirit
[16:06] in the human mind and not the human soul
[16:09] the third type of baptism then is the
[16:11] baptism of the holy ghost and the soul
[16:13] of the believer
[16:14] this is what jesus came to give us
[16:16] according to matthew chapter 11 he said
[16:18] i'm going to give you rest unto your
[16:19] souls
[16:21] so this is the baptism or rest that they
[16:22] did not have in the old testament
[16:25] again it's obvious most churches do not
[16:27] understand the three kinds of baptisms
[16:29] so we can again see how very few people
[16:31] will move on past justification
[16:33] into the meteor subjects of god's word
[16:35] into sanctification and then into the
[16:37] baptism of the holy ghost
[16:39] for example a lot of pentecostal
[16:41] churches basically teach speaking in
[16:43] tongues is the baptism of the holy
[16:45] spirit and it's the only baptism you
[16:47] need well the true understanding of
[16:49] god's word is that speaking in tongues
[16:51] is a gift of god and not all speak with
[16:53] tongues
[16:54] but being filled with the spirit to
[16:55] speak in tongues
[16:56] most often happens in the human spirit
[16:59] which would be an anointing in the human
[17:01] mind
[17:02] and not the soul
[17:03] but of course i do believe it is
[17:04] possible to be baptized with the holy
[17:06] ghost in the soul and speak in tongues
[17:09] like they did on the day of pentecost in
[17:10] acts chapter 2. but if that would happen
[17:12] we would believe there would be an
[17:13] interpretation for those unknown tongues
[17:16] just like there was on the day of
[17:17] pentecost
[17:19] the fourth doctrine is the laying on of
[17:21] hands so there's three aspects to laying
[17:23] on of hands
[17:25] first is laying on hands for divine
[17:26] healing
[17:27] second is
[17:29] laying on of hands for ordination
[17:31] and third is laying on of hands
[17:33] in violence
[17:35] there's a laying on of hands for divine
[17:37] healing
[17:38] as taught in mark chapter 16 jesus said
[17:40] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[17:42] recover
[17:43] some churches believe in this doctrine
[17:44] others do not it's a shame if a church
[17:47] doesn't believe in that because jesus
[17:48] promised that believers would have this
[17:51] sign they would lay hands on the sick
[17:53] and they would recover
[17:54] laying on of hands in violence is spoken
[17:57] of in first timothy 5 22
[17:59] paul said lay hands suddenly on no man
[18:01] neither be partaker of other men's sins
[18:04] keep thyself pure
[18:06] so in context paul is saying don't be a
[18:08] partaker of other men's sins
[18:10] so sometimes men sin when they lay hands
[18:12] on others to hurt them or beat them or
[18:14] abuse them of course abuse in all forms
[18:17] is wrong all the time
[18:18] and abuse is a sign of demonic
[18:20] possession
[18:21] the other kind of laying on of hands is
[18:23] for ordaining elders
[18:26] as spoken of in first timothy 4 14 paul
[18:29] said neglect not the gift that is in
[18:31] thee which was given thee by prophecy
[18:33] with the laying on of hands of the
[18:35] presbytery
[18:37] so this is speaking of ordaining
[18:38] ministers to preach the gospel
[18:40] and the main idea here
[18:42] is that before you lay hands on someone
[18:44] to ordain them a minister they must meet
[18:46] the qualifications of a minister which
[18:48] paul gave in the previous chapter first
[18:50] timothy chapter 3 verses 1 through 7.
[18:53] before a man can be a minister he has to
[18:56] rule his house well by the word of god
[18:58] keeping he and himself and his family in
[19:01] subjection to the word of god
[19:03] he cannot be a novice or a young
[19:04] christian
[19:06] and he should be an example of the faith
[19:08] to the believers
[19:09] and then once he displays all these
[19:11] attributes and meets all the
[19:12] qualifications
[19:14] then hand should be laid upon him and
[19:15] ordain him as a minister of the gospel
[19:18] so concerning the laying on of hands
[19:20] milk christians will miss out on the
[19:22] power of laying hands on the sick and
[19:24] seeing them recover
[19:26] no christians might also make the
[19:27] mistake of ordaining someone before they
[19:29] should be ordained
[19:31] in other words laying their hands on
[19:32] someone and ordaining them when they're
[19:34] not qualified to serve as a minister
[19:37] and then they might also make the
[19:38] mistake of laying hands on someone and
[19:40] mistreating them which again would be an
[19:42] awful mistake
[19:44] the fifth doctrine is resurrection of
[19:46] the dead
[19:47] now this is important because there are
[19:49] two kinds of resurrections for two
[19:51] different kinds of christians i have a
[19:53] video about this on my youtube channel
[19:55] if you'd like to learn more about this
[19:56] subject
[19:58] but clearly it's a subject a lot of
[19:59] people don't understand
[20:01] most people think there's only one
[20:02] resurrection but there's actually two
[20:05] revelation chapter 20 verses five and
[20:08] six speak of the first resurrection
[20:11] and this is the resurrection where the
[20:13] holy ghost feel christians over the last
[20:15] two thousand years and the old testament
[20:17] saints will live and reign with christ
[20:19] for a thousand years during the
[20:21] millennium this resurrection begins with
[20:23] the rapture of the gentile church which
[20:25] is the next major event that we're
[20:27] waiting to take place
[20:28] and this will take place before the
[20:30] tribulation sets in
[20:32] the second resurrection is where all men
[20:34] are brought to the great white throne
[20:36] judgment jesus speaks of this in john 5
[20:39] verse 29
[20:40] he said and shall come forth they that
[20:42] have done good unto the resurrection of
[20:44] life and they that have done evil unto
[20:46] the resurrection of damnation
[20:49] so this second resurrection takes place
[20:51] after the thousand-year millennium and
[20:53] after the battle of gog and magog in
[20:55] which satan is cast in the lake of fire
[20:57] and then you have the great white throne
[20:58] judgment
[21:00] every person who ever lived at any time
[21:02] of human history will be resurrected to
[21:04] this resurrection and they'll be
[21:06] separated in one of two places either on
[21:08] the right hand as sheep or in the left
[21:10] hand as goats the sheep will be saved
[21:12] the goats will be lost
[21:14] the importance of understanding both
[21:16] resurrections
[21:17] is that we should live for the high
[21:19] calling of god in other words we should
[21:20] live to be a part of the first
[21:22] resurrection
[21:23] and the bible says to do that you must
[21:25] be blessed and holy for revelation 20
[21:28] verse 6 said blessed and holy is he that
[21:30] hath part in this first resurrection
[21:33] so milk christians will fail to
[21:34] understand the scriptures that encourage
[21:36] us to be diligent faithful christians
[21:39] peter twice said to give all diligence
[21:42] to make our calling and election sure
[21:44] but milk christians are more lazy about
[21:46] their walk with god
[21:48] they don't show a lot of diligence
[21:50] they don't form the right habits that
[21:52] christians should form
[21:53] they do not press toward the mark of the
[21:55] high calling of god in christ jesus
[21:57] they're content living a foolish life as
[22:00] paul said in ephesians chapter 5
[22:02] they don't walk circumspectly or exactly
[22:05] they kind of wander through life and
[22:07] they reject the perfect will of god by
[22:10] neglecting the baptism of the holy ghost
[22:12] which makes them foolish virgins as
[22:14] jesus talked about in the parables of
[22:16] the ten virgins five are wise five are
[22:18] foolish
[22:20] and the sixth doctrine is eternal
[22:22] judgment so in this doctrine we learn
[22:25] that god's judgment upon each and every
[22:27] soul will last eternally but of course
[22:29] the punishment does not because there is
[22:31] no such thing as an eternal hell
[22:34] that is because a sinner does not have
[22:36] eternal life and therefore cannot live
[22:39] eternally sinners may be punished for
[22:41] hundreds or maybe thousands or millions
[22:43] of years but at some point they will
[22:45] cease to exist
[22:47] first john 3 verse 15 proves this it
[22:49] says whosoever hateth his brother is a
[22:52] murder and you know that no murder hath
[22:54] eternal life abiding in him
[22:57] i have two videos about how hell is not
[23:00] eternal if you'd like to watch those i
[23:02] think they'd be a blessing to you
[23:03] so again god's judgments upon each and
[23:06] every human and also angel
[23:08] will last eternally but scripture tells
[23:11] us satan will cease to exist at some
[23:13] point ezekiel 28 verse 19 tells us that
[23:16] it says thou shalt be a terror and never
[23:19] shalt thou be any
[23:20] more satan has an ending point at some
[23:24] point he will cease to exist he shall
[23:26] not be any more and so will every other
[23:29] demon that he deceived among the third
[23:31] of the angels that he caused to leave
[23:33] their holy estate and join his power of
[23:35] darkness
[23:37] and so it is with every human sinner
[23:39] every human sinner who's a goat who's
[23:41] ultimately rejected by god because he or
[23:44] she rejected god during this life they
[23:46] rejected the grace of god at some point
[23:49] he or she will cease to exist
[23:51] they cannot burn eternally because they
[23:53] do not have eternal life
[23:55] and god is not an unjust judge god would
[23:58] not punish someone eternally for
[24:00] rejecting his word for only a few
[24:02] decades or so that concludes the six
[24:05] doctrines and notice hebrews 6 3 says
[24:08] and this we will do if god permit
[24:11] so again if a christian will humble
[24:13] himself and be taught to repent from
[24:15] dead works that first doctrine then that
[24:18] christian can move on to faith toward
[24:19] god and then the doctrine of baptisms
[24:22] laying on of hands resurrection of the
[24:24] dead and eternal judgment
[24:26] if a christian learns all these and
[24:28] receives god's truth
[24:30] and grows past justification
[24:32] into sanctification and surely god will
[24:35] permit them to go into perfection which
[24:37] is the baptism of the holy ghost or
[24:39] charity in the soul of the believer
[24:42] in closing
[24:44] i hope this video has been a help to you
[24:46] friends the inspiration of god struck me
[24:48] while i was preaching this and i saw how
[24:50] it connected to the three works of grace
[24:52] so i hope it's a help to you in your
[24:54] christian journey
[24:55] as i'm sure it's your desire to be a
[24:57] mature christian
[24:58] and so i close with that question which
[25:01] food are you in need of milk or meat
[25:04] for some of our viewers you've been
[25:06] feeding on the meat for years you're
[25:08] growing in grace and knowledge of god
[25:10] your heart is constantly on fire for
[25:12] more of the holy ghost and more
[25:13] discernment to recognize good and evil
[25:15] in your daily life to keep the evil out
[25:18] and to continue doing good for the glory
[25:20] of our lord jesus christ
[25:22] other viewers you might have been
[25:23] believers for a number of years but
[25:25] maybe you realize i've become a milk
[25:27] christian
[25:28] i need to go back and learn the
[25:30] elementary teachings again
[25:32] i've forgotten the things that the holy
[25:34] spirit once taught me i've been
[25:36] distracted my mind has been on the cares
[25:38] of the world and other things the thing
[25:40] to do is repent and turn to jesus christ
[25:43] do that first doctrine repentance from
[25:45] dead works
[25:46] search your heart and life see if any of
[25:48] those 16 sins that i listed earlier
[25:50] apply to you and then you can repent of
[25:52] those and bring forth fruits meet for
[25:55] repentance as john the baptist told us
[25:57] friends may we press on toward the mark
[25:59] of the high calling of god in christ
[26:01] jesus being justified sanctified and
[26:04] baptized with the holy ghost
[26:06] if you have any questions concerns or
[26:08] testimonies about this video please
[26:10] contact me
[26:13] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[26:15] the desire of your heart
