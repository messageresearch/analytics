[0:03] when he Fe the paper that I was in a
[0:08] debate greetings friends in the
[0:10] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:13] the purpose of this video is to show
[0:15] that God's Prophet brother William
[0:17] brandham was associated with at least
[0:19] three debates according to his own
[0:22] words over the last few years I found
[0:25] that some people do not think debates
[0:28] are helpful or let of the Lord
[0:30] and of course that's wrong according to
[0:32] the Bible and also according to God's
[0:34] Prophet brother brandom and so I felt
[0:36] the inspiration to make this video by
[0:38] the grace of God so here's the outline
[0:40] we'll look at the three debates brother
[0:42] Brandon was associated with second we'll
[0:45] look at the biblical foundation for
[0:47] debate third we'll listen to quotes from
[0:49] Brother brandom about these three
[0:51] debates he was associated with and then
[0:53] fourth we'll share some personal
[0:55] testimonies from my life about the
[0:57] debate I had in 2020 and I hope will'll
[1:00] be a blessing to
[1:01] you the three debates brother random was
[1:03] associated
[1:05] with the first debate brother random was
[1:07] associated with was the 1950 Houston
[1:10] Texas debate it was a Divine Healing
[1:12] debate between Dr best and brother
[1:16] Bosworth and Friends remember brother
[1:18] brandham permitted this debate to happen
[1:21] he permitted his name to be published in
[1:24] the newspaper associated with this
[1:26] debate and then God Vindicated this
[1:28] debate as God himself in the form of the
[1:31] pillar of fire took a picture with his
[1:34] Prophet brother William brandham so I'll
[1:36] just briefly play this quote from 1950
[1:39] at Thy word brother brandom said all the
[1:41] Christians came by the hundreds by
[1:44] playing trains and everything when they
[1:46] saw in the paper that I brother brandham
[1:49] was in a debate let's listen to the
[1:51] quote and there they come find hundreds
[1:54] and hundreds of miles by plane trains
[1:56] and everything come special when you see
[1:58] the paper that I was in a debate the
[2:02] second debate brother Brandon was
[2:03] associated with was a debate on tongues
[2:06] and he actually had moderators in the
[2:08] debate and the debate was about whether
[2:10] tongues was the evidence of the Holy
[2:12] Ghost or not in the debate brother
[2:14] brandom said love was the evidence of
[2:15] the Holy Ghost and that's scriptural and
[2:17] that ties in with all the other quotes
[2:18] of brother brandham because if you have
[2:20] the love of Jesus Christ you will
[2:22] receive the message of your hour the
[2:24] Holy Ghost will guide you into all truth
[2:26] of the scripture so let's listen to the
[2:28] quote from 1960 debate on tongues
[2:30] briefly listen to these statements where
[2:32] he said so in the debate the brother on
[2:35] the other side was the visitor in the
[2:37] debate let's listen to the quote so in
[2:40] the debate the gracious brother he uh in
[2:46] being the visitor I said now I'm willing
[2:49] to discuss this with you if you will
[2:52] stay strictly with the scripture and
[2:54] don't leave the scripture the third
[2:56] debate brother brandham Associated
[2:57] himself with was a debate with with a
[3:00] Lutheran Dean named Dr hegry I believe I
[3:03] might be mispronouncing that and brother
[3:06] Ram talks about this debate in that
[3:07] sermon debate on the tongues from 1960
[3:10] and this debate was on whether or not
[3:12] Satan can heal and of course brother
[3:14] random said Satan cannot heal let's
[3:16] listen to this quote very
[3:18] briefly I said now that answer is like
[3:20] Dr AG up there time you about Luther you
[3:23] know when I told him he remember the
[3:24] debate that we had you know there on the
[3:27] about the um uh it tell me about that
[3:30] witch woman you know that prayed for the
[3:32] sick and they got healed and said God
[3:33] couldn't heal you her know that so now
[3:36] that we've seen the three debates
[3:37] brother and was associated with let's
[3:39] move on to biblical foundation for
[3:41] debate there's numerous scriptures that
[3:43] could be used such as first Peter 3:15
[3:46] be always ready to have an answer for
[3:49] the reason of the hope that's within you
[3:51] 1 Thessalonians 5 prove all things the
[3:54] book of First John try every Spirit but
[3:57] I think one of the main scriptures is
[3:59] Acts 17
[4:01] 1-3 Paul went into the synagogue of Jews
[4:04] and verse 2 said Paul as his manner was
[4:07] went in unto them and three days and
[4:10] three Sabbath days reason with them out
[4:11] of the scriptures opening alleging that
[4:13] Christ must needs have suffered and
[4:16] risen again from the dead then verse
[4:18] four says some believed so there was
[4:20] fruit to Paul's debates and notice Paul
[4:23] debated every Saturday in the Greek
[4:26] Lexicon the word reason means to mingle
[4:29] thought with thought to ponder revolve
[4:31] in mind to converse discourse with one
[4:34] argue discuss of course we know the Holy
[4:38] Ghost filled Church age messenger St
[4:41] Paul the prophet of God was not arguing
[4:44] in the negative sense because there's of
[4:47] course a Godly way to argue and then
[4:50] there's an ungodly way to argue because
[4:52] the word argue in the dictionary simply
[4:54] means to give reasons or cite evidence
[4:56] in support of an idea action or Theory
[5:00] typically with the aim of persuading
[5:01] others to share one's view notice
[5:04] there's no mention of anger or hatred in
[5:07] this definition it simply means giving
[5:09] your reasons or evidence in support of
[5:13] your idea in the Greek the word opening
[5:16] Paul was opening means to Rouse in one
[5:19] The Faculty of understanding or the
[5:21] desire of learning Paul was led by the
[5:23] Holy Ghost to try to help them
[5:25] understand or learn how Jesus died and
[5:28] Rose from the grave grave according to
[5:30] the scriptures remember learning is not
[5:33] bad learning is actually the result of
[5:34] Revelation because in Matthew
[5:37] 11:29 Jesus said come and learn of Me
[5:40] Jesus used the word learn so there's
[5:43] nothing wrong with learning because
[5:45] learning is the result of Revelation
[5:47] Revelation is unveiling so if
[5:48] something's unveiled you learn what's
[5:50] underneath and that's according to the
[5:52] scripture the word alleging means to set
[5:55] before one in teaching to set forth to
[5:58] explain so when Paul would explain
[6:00] things he was teaching the Jews about
[6:04] how Christ fulfilled all the prophecies
[6:06] about him and some believed praise God
[6:08] for that the other verse for debate and
[6:12] godly debate of course is Isaiah 1:16
[6:14] to18 I'll just skip down to 18 this is
[6:17] the verse brother brandom uses come now
[6:19] and let us reason together sayith the
[6:20] Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they
[6:22] shall be white as snow and there God is
[6:25] saying let us reason in the Hebrew it
[6:27] means prove decide judge rebuke
[6:30] reprove correct be right convince or
[6:33] convict brother Bram said this is what
[6:35] brother Bosworth said at the 1950
[6:37] Houston debate he said I'm not here to
[6:39] debate of course meaning with anger or
[6:42] sinful debate but with holy debate which
[6:45] is reasoning by the Holy Ghost and
[6:47] brother brand said this in 1952
[6:50] experiences brother brandom said that
[6:52] brother bosor said we're here tonight to
[6:54] discuss or to come and reason together
[6:56] upon the words of God let's listen to
[6:58] the quote
[7:00] so Mr Bosworth got up a gallon old
[7:03] soldier at the cross stood this is
[7:04] straight and 30 he stood there and he
[7:06] said we are not here tonight to Fu or to
[7:09] debate he said we are here tonight to
[7:11] discuss or to come and reason together
[7:15] he said upon the words of God he said I
[7:17] have
[7:18] 600 different statements concerning
[7:21] Jesus Christ today and his attitude
[7:24] towards the six is so now that we have
[7:27] the biblical Foundation set let's look
[7:28] at quote from Brother
[7:30] brandham this quote at Thy word 1950
[7:33] brother brandham tells about brother
[7:35] Bosworth getting permission to go to the
[7:37] debate and brother Bram said you can go
[7:38] if you don't argue and then he said his
[7:41] name was in the newspaper that
[7:44] advertised the debate and brother Bram
[7:46] said quote I was in a debate so anyone
[7:49] that says brother brandham wasn't in a
[7:51] debate doesn't know the quotes brother
[7:54] Ram said quote I was in a debate let's
[7:56] listen to the
[7:57] quote ask brother B let me go if you
[8:00] don't argue said I'll not argue so they
[8:03] call the debate and the papers all cared
[8:05] headlines and everything and there they
[8:08] come flying hundreds and hundreds of
[8:10] miles by plane trains and everything
[8:12] come special when they see the paper
[8:14] that I was in a debate the second quote
[8:18] is from God commissioning Moses
[8:21] 1953 brother Bram said Doctor best got
[8:24] real mad angry and he turned around and
[8:27] slapped another preacher in the face so
[8:29] notice Dr best got angry of course
[8:32] that's a sin and then he slapped
[8:34] somebody that's abuse that's violence
[8:37] from a devil and yet when brother
[8:39] brandham came down to pray to close the
[8:41] debate the Holy Ghost took a picture
[8:43] with brother brandham in one place
[8:45] brother Bram said it was the angel of
[8:46] the Lord so even in the midst of Satan
[8:49] anointing Dr best and other people the
[8:51] Holy Ghost come down calm down the
[8:53] audience and God took his picture with
[8:56] his Prophet brother brandham let's
[8:57] listen to the quote
[8:59] so after a while he kept saying and the
[9:02] moderators called him down he didn't
[9:04] answer one question or nothing he called
[9:05] and he got real angry and he turned
[9:07] around and slapped another preacher in
[9:08] the face and when he did that and he had
[9:12] hired the Douglas Studios of Houston
[9:15] that come out and take six 8 by 10
[9:18] glossy pictures of him now here's the
[9:21] remark he said I'm going to skin that
[9:23] old man take his hide off of him and
[9:26] hang him up on the skin on the my study
[9:28] door rubs some salt in it for a memorial
[9:31] and Divine
[9:32] Healing sounds like a Christian doesn't
[9:35] it so then he said that about brother
[9:38] boswood but the skinning went the other
[9:41] way the next quote is from 1950 God
[9:44] revealing himself to the people brother
[9:46] Ram said regarding the 1950 debate I
[9:49] will not say a thing I'll listen to Dr
[9:51] Bosworth and them holding the scripture
[9:54] discussion then brother Bram says don't
[9:56] never argue with people so here he gives
[9:57] a definition the negative definition of
[10:00] debate because there's a positive
[10:02] definition for debate and then a
[10:03] negative definition brother Ram says
[10:06] never argue and fuss never get in the
[10:08] evil spirit of debate and then I love
[10:10] what brother Rand said he come down from
[10:12] the balcony at the end of the debate and
[10:15] he said don't no one feel sorry or feel
[10:17] bad at Mr best so although Dr best had
[10:21] an evil spirit on him brother Bram told
[10:22] the audience don't feel bad at Mr best
[10:26] in other words love your enemies Trust
[10:29] to win them over with love let's listen
[10:31] to the quote I was sitting way up high I
[10:35] said I will not say a thing tonight I'll
[10:37] listen to Dr Bosworth and them holding
[10:39] the scripture discussion but don't never
[10:43] argue with people you just stand still
[10:46] and let God do the thing I wouldn't
[10:49] argue wouldn't debate with no one I
[10:51] don't believe in it in the first place I
[10:53] can only state watch truth if you want
[10:55] to believe it all right if you do not
[10:58] there'll be others who will believe it
[10:59] isn't that
[11:00] right and don't ever argue don't debate
[11:03] God's word not to be busted over like
[11:06] that every person has her right idea and
[11:08] those who believe all right those who do
[11:10] not believe just the
[11:12] same and just then something is picked
[11:15] me up like that and when it picked me up
[11:17] I knew I was to go forward and I come
[11:19] down out of the balconies walk to the
[11:21] platform just as walk the platform I
[11:23] said it's too bad that people have to
[11:26] argue over the word of God I said don't
[11:29] no one feel sorry or feel bad at Mr be
[11:32] because that's all right but I said
[11:34] that's not the Baptist belief because I
[11:36] was rocked in a Baptist cradle in myself
[11:38] and I know the Baptist believe in Divine
[11:40] Healing now praying for the sick and I
[11:42] said that's not a Baptist belief that's
[11:43] Mr best belief alone next quote early
[11:46] spiritual experiences 52 brother Ram
[11:49] again tells how brother Bosworth wanted
[11:51] to have the debate and brother BR said
[11:53] if you promise me you won't fuss and
[11:55] brother Bram said all right so brother
[11:58] Bram said all right to a debate as long
[12:00] as there was no fussing let's listen to
[12:02] the quote I thought that's pretty funky
[12:05] like old Caleb let me go take that
[12:08] City I kind of admired the old brother I
[12:11] looked back few minut I said all right
[12:13] brother Bosworth if you promise me you
[12:14] won't fuss now he's sitting here
[12:16] listening at
[12:17] me and he said I won't fuss I'll just
[12:20] give him the gospel I said all
[12:23] right the next quote from experiences
[12:26] 1952 brother Rand talked about watching
[12:29] brother Bosworth debate and brother Ram
[12:31] said oh my there it is I never thought
[12:33] of that in my life that old Caleb
[12:35] standing there anointed see so brother
[12:38] Bosworth cornered Dr best in the debate
[12:40] with the word of God showing if the
[12:43] names of Jehovah apply to Jesus then
[12:45] Divine Healing still applies in the New
[12:46] Testament brother brandom called Dr
[12:49] Bosworth an old Caleb remember Caleb was
[12:52] the one who went in the promised land
[12:54] with Joshua he had another Spirit which
[12:57] was the Holy Spirit he was just as
[12:59] strong at 85 as he was at 45 and brother
[13:02] Bram compares the man who was debating
[13:05] standing on the scripture Dr Bosworth
[13:07] with Caleb let's listen to the
[13:09] quote he said Mr be I'll ask you one
[13:12] question if you'll answer me yes or no
[13:15] whatever way you answer me then the
[13:17] discussion will be
[13:18] over he said was the Redemptive names of
[13:22] Jehovah applied to Jesus yes or no I
[13:27] drunk down I oh my there it is I never
[13:31] thought of that in my life that old
[13:33] Caleb standing there annoyed
[13:36] him it was different from that Seminary
[13:39] experience setting back there from
[13:40] reading and writing arithmetic he had
[13:41] never thought of those things in the
[13:44] next quote it's from expectancy
[13:46] 1952 here's actually a fourth debate
[13:49] brother brandom said he was associated
[13:51] with so I'm sorry I didn't catch this
[13:52] till now but I'll still put on the video
[13:55] there's three debates because that's how
[13:56] I started the the recording but here
[13:59] brother brandom says he would debate and
[14:01] which doctors would be standing near him
[14:04] during a debate brother Bram said I
[14:06] could stand there amongst the witch
[14:08] doctors debating because he knew my
[14:10] loved ones in America were praying for
[14:12] him let's listen to the
[14:14] quote sometimes when you're debate heing
[14:17] witch doctors and everything else
[14:18] standing nearing Skeptics and
[14:20] unbelievers and everything trying first
[14:22] thing falls on my mind is my loved ones
[14:26] in America is praying somebody's bound
[14:29] to be praying because they got literally
[14:31] hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
[14:33] people at pledge they would pray and
[14:35] that many people there's prayer going
[14:37] before God constantly fing see what I
[14:40] mean constantly moving all the time so
[14:43] this next quote sby of a good cheer 1954
[14:46] brother Brams talking about brother
[14:47] Bosworth debating brother Bram said it
[14:50] did him good to hear Dr Bosworth teach
[14:53] because he could still tie up Satan in
[14:55] the scriptures brother Ram said he heard
[14:58] brother B worth in discussions and
[15:00] debates and he preaches in such a way
[15:02] Satan just can't stand around where he's
[15:04] at so notice brother raham says a man
[15:07] Anointed The Holy Ghost Satan cannot
[15:09] stand around that man when that Holy
[15:12] Ghost anointed man is debating let's
[15:15] listen to the quote usually I don't do
[15:18] this and um and enjoyed the ministry of
[15:21] my brother
[15:24] Bosworth his preaching his
[15:27] teaching he
[15:30] he was teaching this gospel when I was a
[15:34] probably before I was born
[15:37] and I does me good to hear him how he
[15:40] can still tie Satan up in the scriptures
[15:45] and I've heard him in discussions
[15:48] debates and I tell you he preaches the
[15:50] word in such a way the Satan just can't
[15:55] stand around where he's at when it comes
[15:56] to the word he certainly
[15:59] is not as loud maybe as some but he
[16:01] certainly knows what he's talking about
[16:04] next let's look at the debate brother
[16:06] Brandon had with initial evidence not
[16:08] being tongues he said he had moderators
[16:11] uh the first quote was from debate on
[16:14] tongues third paragraph 1960 August 7th
[16:18] brother brandham said that brother Leo
[16:19] was anxious to get brother bram's memory
[16:22] of this debate on tape and that's what
[16:24] they did in Yakama Washington let's
[16:28] listen to the quote
[16:32] now when I first
[16:34] began in this debate that brother Leo is
[16:38] anxious to get on tape here I suppose I
[16:40] see it flickering I guess he's got it
[16:42] running now um I would not U Want You
[16:47] brother Leo to use this to hurt or
[16:49] anything but just I know you wouldn't
[16:51] and I wouldn't say to you
[16:53] brother if a man speaks with tongues all
[16:56] right if he doesn't speak speak with
[16:58] Tong that still is no sign he hasn't got
[17:01] it the next quote it's paragraph 8
[17:04] brother brandham said in the debate he
[17:05] was willing to discuss the scripture as
[17:08] long as at the end they could shake
[17:09] hands and Ste and still feel Brothers
[17:12] one to another let's listen to the quote
[17:15] so in the debate the gracious brother he
[17:21] uh in being the visitor I said now I'm
[17:24] willing to discuss this with you if you
[17:27] will stay strictly with the scripture
[17:29] and don't leave the scripture and I said
[17:32] then at the end of the discussion if you
[17:34] can shake my hand and we'll still feel
[17:36] Brothers one another because if you
[17:38] don't I wouldn't do it see I said
[17:41] because perhaps when it's over you're
[17:42] going to feel the same way you do and I
[17:44] will do the next quote brother brand
[17:46] said they had moderators businessmen
[17:49] they just took down the facts so this
[17:51] proves brother random was an active
[17:53] participant in at least one two or three
[17:55] debates let's listen to the quote but
[17:58] being we got uh moderators
[18:01] here at sworn business manual and so
[18:05] forth that they just they're just
[18:06] they're not interesting either side
[18:08] they're just taking down what facts no
[18:10] matter what their decision is it's just
[18:12] is five or six man just on certain
[18:14] scripture when this scripture is given
[18:16] who takes it who really throw the light
[18:18] on it that's one it tells so next quote
[18:23] brother brandom said this debate lasted
[18:24] 5 hours from 7 until about 2:00 a.m. in
[18:27] the morning it was lengthy debate let's
[18:29] listen to the
[18:30] quote so that taken
[18:33] up most of his time and then it was my
[18:37] time we was from about 7:00 till about
[18:39] 2: in the morning so um was lengthy so
[18:43] um then when he come back he had about
[18:47] 30 35 minutes on that then uh they
[18:50] arrested the people then let me speak
[18:52] again let me speak so I never left his
[18:56] scriptures I Stay right with his
[18:59] scripture that's the only way he can
[19:01] correctly sensely I'm just as open to
[19:03] know what's truth as anybody
[19:05] else in the final two quotes from
[19:08] Jehovah Gyra 56 brother brandom said
[19:10] brother Bosworth won the debate in
[19:13] Houston in 1950 and then brother brandom
[19:15] said he won the debate on tongues in
[19:18] paragraph 30 he said but this fellow
[19:21] lost the debate you know so I just want
[19:23] you to see how brother brandham could
[19:25] say who won debates whoever stayed with
[19:27] the word of God won the debates let's
[19:30] listen to the
[19:30] quotes now the Lord has seven compound
[19:35] Redemptive names we we know that and
[19:38] Jehovah jyra is the one the Lord will
[19:41] provide for himself a sacrifice then he
[19:45] is still Jehovah gy that's how Mr
[19:48] Bosworth won the debate that night with
[19:50] the Baptist minister at Houston Texas
[19:52] when the angel of the Law's picture was
[19:54] taken when on that very one thing that
[19:59] so then but this not a lost the debate
[20:02] you know of course there's a lot more
[20:03] but you see what I'm talking about come
[20:05] right back to the beginning right back
[20:07] to the
[20:08] beginning lastly let's look at
[20:12] testimonies now Friends by God's grace
[20:14] in 2020 it was September I had a debate
[20:18] defending brother brandom as a genuine
[20:20] prophet of God most of the feedback I
[20:22] got from the debate was positive but of
[20:23] course there was some negative feedback
[20:25] even from message Believers and that's
[20:28] fine Brother random said Jesus had to
[20:29] live above all the criticism so any
[20:32] Christian who's trying to do something
[20:33] is going to be
[20:35] criticized but by the grace of God I
[20:36] felt led to do that debate I felt led of
[20:38] the Holy Ghost after prayer fasting
[20:40] preaching the
[20:41] word especially after seeing how Paul
[20:44] defended the gospel in Philippians 1:7
[20:46] and Philippians
[20:48] 1:17 while I was preaching that in
[20:50] Philippians 1 I felt the Holy Ghost
[20:51] anoint me to say I was born to defend
[20:54] this message and then as I left the
[20:56] pulpit I got an email invitation for
[20:59] that debate so I truly felt it was led
[21:01] of the Lord for me to do that debate one
[21:04] negative feedback I got was the daughter
[21:07] of a famous message pastor and she
[21:08] called the debate stupid and normally I
[21:10] don't use that wording but that's her
[21:12] words and it's so sad that she would say
[21:15] that when people say harsh things like
[21:17] that it shows how much they don't know
[21:18] about the message because as his video
[21:20] showed brother brandom supported debates
[21:23] and then God Vindicated debates and of
[21:25] course the foundation for all that is
[21:27] the Holy Bible
[21:28] with St Paul with Isaiah with John's
[21:32] words Paul's words and Peter's words of
[21:34] course by the grace of God so over these
[21:37] last three years since the debate I've
[21:38] got a few testimonies where message
[21:41] believers who were struggling with
[21:42] whether to stay in the message or not
[21:44] watched the debate and decided to stay
[21:45] in the message and then the debate and
[21:48] the following podcast and videos
[21:49] defending brother brandham helped a few
[21:51] people stay in the message and for that
[21:53] I'm eternally grateful by the grace of
[21:55] God and even this week I got an email
[21:58] email thanking me for the debate from a
[22:00] brother in Ghana Africa he said he's
[22:02] been praying for the last few years that
[22:04] God would provide us someone to defend
[22:07] this message and then he found my debate
[22:10] just this week and when he found it he
[22:12] wept he said I wasn't able to thank God
[22:15] enough he said I thank God for answering
[22:18] my prayer and he said brother Smith I
[22:20] don't need a dime from you as a content
[22:23] black preacher of this message I only
[22:25] need a small favor do me this favor keep
[22:27] the message defended and the Lord Jesus
[22:29] Christ glorified if we don't meet on
[22:32] this side we shall meet on the other
[22:33] side keep it up I love you and God bless
[22:36] you bye friends these type of emails
[22:39] make everything worth it by the grace of
[22:41] God and I appreciate the Lord Jesus
[22:43] Christ vindicating the debate he led me
[22:45] to have in 2020 of course he'd already
[22:48] Vindicated the debating of St Paul and
[22:51] of course God's Prophet brother brandham
[22:53] in Houston in
[22:54] 1950 in
[22:56] closing friends I hope this video was a
[22:58] blessing on the topic of debate now of
[23:01] course there could be many other quotes
[23:03] I know there's quotes about how debates
[23:04] can be negative but I wanted to clearly
[23:07] show through these quotes from brother
[23:08] brandham that he supported debates done
[23:11] in brotherly love and kindness and being
[23:13] able to shake hands at the end of the
[23:14] debate and tell somebody they're still
[23:16] your brother that's how I ended my 2020
[23:19] debate I told the brothers God bless you
[23:21] I'll be praying for you and I don't know
[23:23] if they'll stay true to Christ or not I
[23:25] don't know if they'll fall away from the
[23:26] faith or not but I wanted to treat them
[23:28] as a brother and so I tried to embody
[23:31] what the Holy Ghost had said through St
[23:33] Paul and also brother brandom so if you
[23:35] have any other quotes about debates
[23:37] you'd like to share with me just put
[23:38] them in the comments by God's grace I'll
[23:40] try to respond to them when I can if you
[23:43] have any questions concerns or
[23:44] testimonies about this video please
[23:46] contact
[23:47] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[23:50] the desire of your
[23:56] heart
