Description:
In Part 1 of this 3 part series, an overview is given on the doctrine of the serpent seed, which God Himself originated in Genesis 3:15. Many people may be surprised to know that the original sin in the Garden of Eden was not eating a literal apple, but it was the "fruit of adultery" (Proverbs 30:20) between Eve and the serpent. After Eve partook of this "fruit of adultery" with the serpent, she shared the "fruit" with Adam and she conceived two seeds, or children, from two different fathers. The first two Bible proofs are presented. First, this doctrine of the serpent seed is taught throughout the entire Bible. Second, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was not a literal tree, but rather it was the evil spirit of Satan.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to teach nine proofs of the serpent Seed doctrine we want to give a disclaimer that this video series contains mature subjects like adultery human reproduction and so forth Parental Guidance is certainly encouraged before we teach the nine proofs we want to summarize the doctrine of the serpent seed for those unfamiliar with it the word serpent seed come from God's own words in Genesis 3:15 so God is the one who originated this truth that the serpent had seed or offspring or children here's how God's words about the serpent having seed or offspring should be understood the forbidden fruit that Eve partook of in Genesis 3:6 was an act of sexual adultery with the serpent not a literal apple as many erroneously believe Proverbs 30:20 and Song of Solomon 51 clearly teach that eating can be symbolic of sexual relations such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith I have done no wickedness I am come into my garden my sister my spouse I have gathered my myrrh with my spice I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey I have drunk my wine with my milk eat oh friends drink yay abundantly oh beloved after partaking of the fruit of adultery with the serpent Eve conceived a child from the seed of the serpent which is why God later recognized that the serpent had seedar Offspring in Genesis 3:15 Genesis 3:6 stated that after Eve partook of the fruit she went and shared that fruit with Adam meaning she had sexual relations with Adam after she had relations with the serpent Eve then received CE the seed of Adam and conceived again now Eve had two different seeds growing inside her from these two sex acts the seed of The Serpent and the seed of Adam which two seeds God himself recognized and later the two seeds resulted in two sons Cain and Abel from two different fathers Cain's father was The Serpent and Abel's father was Adam so the story of the fall of mankind by the first and original sin in Genesis 3: 1-6 has two symbols that are not to be understood literally which are the eating of fruit and the two trees the eating of fruit was symbolic of sexual intercourse according to Proverbs 30:20 2 Corinthians 11: 2 and 3 Song of Solomon 4: 12 all the way to chapter 5: 1 and Romans 7: 1: 5 a fruit is the end result of a seed and the serpents lie to Eve that she would not surely die if she partook of the fruit was a spiritual seed or thought that was planted in her mind that liar seed that was planted in her mind eventually came into fruition and produced the fruit of an adulterous act with the serpent which God recognized by stating that the Serpent's Seed would have hatred against the woman's seed Eve partook of this fruit with the serpent and then shared it with Adam who also partook of the fruit as mentioned earlier the two trees in the midst of the garden known as the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil were symbolic of the two spirits of Jesus and Satan these two trees were not literal trees like all the other trees in the garden as we will explain soon in this video we will now teach on nine proofs of the serpent Seed doctrine proof number one of the serpent seed is the Bible supports the serpent Seed doctrine from Genesis to Revelation Moses Jesus St Paul St Peter and St John all supported the serpent Seed doctrine through their teachings Moses of course was the author of the book of Genesis and recorded Genesis 3:15 in which God himself said that the serpent had a seed or offspring which we can prove to be Cain for he was of that Wicked one according to 1 John 3:12 the Lord Jesus himself taught the serpent Seed doctrine in Matthew 13: 24-30 and: 36-4 3 in this Parable Jesus described the children of God as good seed while the children of the wicked one Satan were tears or bad seed according to verse 38 the parable which has numerous applications teaches that two different men or sers planted two different seeds in one field the two men then represent God and Satan and the field represents the world this Parable also helps reveal the origin from the Garden of Eden of the two two kinds of children the children of God and the children of the devil two men Adam and the serpent planted their seeds in one field or one woman Eve the seeds or offspring grew up and manifested their different Natures Cain the son of the serpent slew righteous Abel for Cain was of the cursed Seed St Paul supported the serpent Seed doctrine in 2 Corinthians 11 veres 2 and 3 by directly comparing the virginity of the church in Corinth to ease virginity when she was presented to Adam Paul said it was his desire to present the Corinthians as a Chase virgin or spiritual virgin to Christ then Paul went on to say that he feared the minds of the Corinthians would be corrupted and they would lose their spiritual virginity just as the serpent corrupted the mind of Eve and she lost her spiritual virginity and also her physical virginity for God said she had two different seeds immediately after she partook of the fruit and shared it with Adam St Peter supported the serpent Seed doctrine in second Peter 1:4 stating that corruption was in the world through lust which is a desire for that which is forbidden we see the Bible teaches that Eve lusted after the fruit of adultery as also taught by Genesis 3:16 in which God declares the consequences of Eve sin one of which was that Eve's desire would now be to her husband this means that Eve's desire was not to her husband Adam before God gave this consequence but her lustful desire was to the serpent who gave Eve of his own Seed St John supported the serpent Seed doctrine in 1 John 3: 6-15 we have already mentioned verse 12 in this video but we will again point out that the holy spirit said Cain was of the wicked one and we know Adam was not the wicked one for the phrase Wicked one always refers to Satan as Jesus called Satan the wicked one twice in Matthew 13: 19- 38 and St John mentioned the wicked one three other times in his same letter chapter 2: 13- 14 and chapter 5: 18 and each time it meant Satan not Adam Cain even had his own separate genealogy that is separate from Adams in Genesis 4:1 17- 24 as Adam's genealogy is in Genesis 5: 1-32 Adam Adam's genealogy stated that Seth was in the image and likeness of Adam but the Bible never says that Cain was in the image and likeness of Adam furthermore the Bible states that Eve was the mother of all living in Genesis 3:20 but scripture never says that Adam was the father of all living because he was not the serpent was the father of Cain and Eve was indeed the mother of Cain proof number two of the serpent seed is the two trees in the midst of the Garden of Eden were not literal trees because the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was not good for food in Genesis 2:9 the Bible said that every tree out of the ground was good for food this proves that the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was not a regular tree because when Eve partook of it it caused sin and death the tree of knowledge and good and evil was not good for food like every other tree of the garden and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil since sin and death came from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it could not have been good by any means any tree that will kill you is not good for food thus we can say two things about the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil first it did not come from the ground second its fruit was not good for food this proves that the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was not a physical tree but a spiritual tree the evil spirit of Satan the two trees in the midst of the garden were symbolic of the two spirits of Jesus and Satan in fact we believe these two trees are still available today both the spirit of Jesus and the spirit of Satan offer fruits or human actions that can be experienced by humans just as Adam and Eve experienced in the Garden of Eden Eve was deceived into eating the fruit of adultery off the tree of the the spirit of Satan just as Hosea rebuked Israel for eating the fruit of lies from Satan's spirit in Hosea chapter 10: 13 any sinful Act is a fruit of Satan on the contrary any Act of Godly obedience and righteousness is a fruit of the Holy Spirit or the spirit of Jesus Christ so we now see that we may choose to eat of either spiritual tree worldly knowledge or words of eternal life which leads to our third proof [Music]
