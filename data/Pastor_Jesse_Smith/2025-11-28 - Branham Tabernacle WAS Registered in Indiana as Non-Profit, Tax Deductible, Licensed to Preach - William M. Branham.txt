TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I know what that is. Even my tabernacle today of which my foundation now the people who does send donations to this foundation has a government number comes back to you to give you tax resent from all that you send to this foundation. It's a a nonprofit foundation called Bram Tabernacle. Greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about churches being registered with the government. This is an excellent question and there's numerous quotes from God's prophet brother Brandham that help answer this question. By the grace of God, the book of Acts says we ought to obey God rather than men. So any commandment of man that goes against the word of God should be rejected. But if the commandments of men do not go against the word of God, then we should keep them as well. As the Lord Jesus Christ said, "Give unto Caesar what is Caesars's." So that's the balance that we take as holy ghostfilled Christians. We obey all the laws of the land as long as they do not transgress the laws of God. So I'll read this specific question. It says, "Did Brother Brandham register the Brandom Tabernacle with the state of Indiana?" Yes, he did. Now, the brother request copies of that, but I don't have those copies. So, if anybody does have the copies, please share them with me and I'll make another video and then I can leave a link in the description to those documents by God's grace. And then I was asked, did you register the bride of Christ fellowship with the state of Ohio? And the answer is yes, I did. Then the brother said, there are certain message believers in his African country where they don't believe in registering their churches through the state required registration. So, I would say this is a Christian liberty. There's no mandate in the Bible that you have to register your church with the government. But there's nothing sinful about registering your church with the government unless the government is asking you to deny your faith somehow and then you wouldn't want to do that. But in my case and the case of brother Brandham, there was no sin in registering your church organization or organism is the better Bible word with the state as long as the state does not make you deny the faith, the Christian faith in any manner. Also, I'll say before we registered our church, we talked to an accountant and the accountant said there are religious exemptions from registering your church with the state. But in order to take that religious exemption, you have to say that you don't believe in the role of the government. And so I could not take that religious exemption because when I was growing up, my family received food stamps. When I was a child, of course, my mom and father received food stamps. And I'm grateful we had food stamps because it helped feed our family. And then even after I got married, I was in the lowincome classification. So we did receive a little bit of government assistance. I believe it was through wick, women, infants, and children. And so I benefited from that as well. So I'm grateful for that. And so it is not against my faith for governments to help feed people if there's a true need for food. So again, the Bible foundation is Jesus's words about give to Caesar what's Caesars's. And also the entire chapter of Romans 13 speaks about how God gives earthly governments authority and we should follow their authority as long as they do not transgress the word of God. Now look at these quotes from God's prophet brother Brandham here in chronological order. So in 1950 August 24th to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed in Cleveland Ohio. Brother Ram says how Voice of Healing was a nonprofit organization. And notice Brother Ram never criticized the Voice of Healing for being a nonprofit organization. He said, quote, "Always the nonprofit organization, the voice of healing. Brother Lindsay is the editor and brother Moore is the co-editor and sister Anna Gene Moore is the circulating editor." In the second quote, Brother Brandham said in 1951, July 29th am the resurrection of Lazarus in Erie, Pennsylvania, Brother Brandham said, "The missionary Baptist church gave me a local exorter license, giving me the right to marry, bury, baptize, or so forth in the state of Indiana." So there, Brother Brandham states he had a license to preach, marry, Barry, etc. through the state of Indiana. and I have the same through the state of Ohio by God's grace. Thirdly, in 1958, the placing of deacons, brother Random said the Brandham tabernacle had bylaws or written rules for how the church was governed and ran. He said, "The old bylaws were destroyed in the 1937 flood, but brother was able to recopy them and hang them in the Breham tabernacle." He said, quote, "The old set of bylaws was destroyed in the 1937 flood. We have recopied those and will be hung on the wall here soon. the duties of trustees, deacons, treasures, and so forth, pastor, associates, and so forth. End quote. Now, I have a copy of these bylaws if you like them. I don't know if Brandham Tabernacle was the one that printed these out or somebody else typed them out and printed them out and shared them with me. I got them from Bible Believers Church in the early 2000s when I was a member there. I was a member there from about 2004 to 2006, but I visited there from 2001 to 2004 before I became a member by God's grace. So, let me know if you'd like a copy. I can put the copy of bylaws from Adam Tabernacle in a PDF. If you like them, just let me know. Please email me. jesse.smith1icloud.com. Fourth from let us see God, November 29th, 1959, San Jose, California. Brother Ram said, quote, "Even my tabernacle today, of which my foundation, now the people who does send donations to this foundation has a government number comes back to you to give you tax exempt from all that you send to this foundation. It's a a nonprofit foundation called Brandom Tabernacle." End quote. So there, Brother Ram says his church was registered with the government and they had a government number and so does our church. We have a tax exempt status number, a tax ID number with the state of Ohio. So in this quote, we see brother Brandham set up the Brandom Tabernacle as a foundation with the state of Indiana. It was a nonprofit foundation with the state of Indiana. And he also permitted financial donations to be taxexempt, which we do as well here in the state of Ohio. And fifth and finally in all things November 24th evening service 1962 brother Brandham again says Brandham Tabernacle was a nonprofit foundation quote and it'll all been deposited was on deposit in the church and so forth which we were using as a nonprofit foundation end quote. So brother Ram's talking about his tax case where he owed back taxes and he calls his church Brandham Tabernacle a nonprofit foundation. In closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. I kind of want to use this video as a reference. Over the years, I've been asked numerous times about these quotes. I want to put them in one place, one video here, and Lord willing, I'll be able to use this video to answer the question. Did Brother Random register Brandon Tabernacle with the state of Indiana? And the answer is yes. And he had a minister's license through the state of Indiana. So again, it's awesome to see how humble brother Rand was, how much he obeyed the laws of the land. We should do the same by the grace of God. There are other quotes where brother Ram talks about we should obey the big boss and he's speaking of the federal government and no doubt he obeyed the state government and local governments as well by the grace of God because he was a holy ghost Christian. So please share this video with anyone who has questions about taxes, registering with the government, preaching licenses and so forth by the grace of God. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus [music] Christ be the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ [music] to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. [music] The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed.
