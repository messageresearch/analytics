TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] And I one night saw our Lord Jesus. I'm saying this with permission I believe from the Holy Spirit. The angel of the Lord that comes is not the Lord Jesus. It doesn't look like him in the same vision. For the vision I saw of the Lord Jesus that he was a little man. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about angels. Recently, I was asked to do a video about angels. So, by the grace of God, we'll make a simple short video here on angels. So, I'll start off by saying I could be wrong on some of these teachings here. I'm just doing my best by the grace of God. Again, it's not the deepest study I've ever done, but I thought it was an excellent question by God's grace. And so, for the outline, we'll begin with five or six kinds of angels in the Bible. And then second we'll look at various attributes of angels. And third we'll look at brother Brandham's angel by God's grace. So let's begin here uh with the five or six types of angels. And again I could be wrong on some of these. There could be less types of angels in the Bible or more. The first and most important type of angel is the angel of the Lord. This is God in angelic form. It's God taking on a theophony body. Brother Ram calls it the covenant angel. And so we see the covenant angel numerous places. I'll just hit the highlights here. In Genesis 22:15 and 16, the Bible said, "The angel Lord called into Abraham and said, "By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord." So here we see an angel speaking with divine authority, saying, "Saith the Lord," and swearing by himself. So this is God speaking to Abraham. Of course, God gave the covenant to Abraham. We call it the Abrahamic covenant. So that's our first picture of the angel of the Lord as far as I can tell there to Abraham. Second example would be with Moses. Now Moses had a couple interactions with the angel of the Lord in Exodus 3:es 2-6. The angel Lord appears unto Moses in a flame of fire out of midst of a bush and says, "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob." And later God calls himself as the I am God. Brother Ram said in God commissioning Moses in 1953 that was the angel of the Lord Jesus Christ sitting in that bush the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel through the wilderness. Any teacher knows the angel of the covenant was Jesus Christ. So that's something I had to learn when I became a believer. when I really repented and gave my heart to the Lord was that the Lord would show up in angelic form at times to different servants of God, prophets of God throughout the Old Testament. The next one is the angel Lord or the captain of the Lord's host. In Joshua 5:13-15, Abraham said Joshua, the angel Lord that led Israel is the Lord Jesus Christ. And there in Joshua chapter 5, he's called the captain of the host of the Lord. I'll go to the New Testament now here by God's grace. Again, just hitting the highlights in Acts 27 23-2. Paul was in a ship with some prisoners, and he said, "There stood by me this night, the angel of God, whose I am and whom I serve." So, I don't know if this is the covenant angel, the Lord Jesus, or just the ministering angel or guardian angel that was set over Paul because in verse 24, it said, "Lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee." But we can clearly see that Paul had an angel with him throughout his whole life and ministry just like Moses, just like Abraham, just like Joshua and of course just like God's prophet brother Brandham in this day. And then the final angel lord appearance that I want to go over is Revelation 10:es 1-7. Here we see a mighty angel come down from heaven and he has attributes like unto Christ described in Revelation 1. He has a face like the sun and feet like pillars of fire. So those are attributes mentioned of the Lord Jesus Christ in Revelation 1. Revelation 1 said his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and feet like unto brass in Revelation 11:15. And remember friends, brother Ram said Revelation 10 1-7 is history. And what is the attraction on the mountain? 1965. So we believe this means the Lord Jesus Christ came down and met with brother Brandham in order to reveal the seven seals to brother Brham that he could preach them to us. the revelations contained therein with thus sayith the lord. All right, moving on now to the second type of angel is the archangel. Now the only archangel by name is Michael. There's only two occurrences in the entire bible of archangel. Both are Michael. Revelation 12:7 said he led the war against Lucifer in heaven. And then an archangel or voice of archangel is connected to the rapture in 1 Thessalonians 4:16. For the rapture, there's the shout voice and trump. So, the second attribute is the voice and it's called the voice of the archangel. So, perhaps Michael is involved somehow with the gentile rapture. I'm not exactly certain of that, but Michael's the only archangel named and there's only two mentions of archangel in the in the entire New Testament or in the entire Bible. Jude 1:9 also mentions Michael and he's connected with the resurrected body of Moses. So again, you have an archangel connected with resurrection. And so what is the rapture of the gentile bride? It's a resurrection of the dead in Christ first and then we which are alive and remain will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and caught up in the air to meet the Lord and the dead in Christ. What a wonderful promise. But again, archangels are connected to resurrection. Moses's in Jude 1:9 and then also the gentile rapture in 1 Thessalonians 4:16. The third type of angel is the cherub. There are 69 mentions of cherub or cherubam or cherubs in the entire bible. 68 in the old testament, one in the new testament. Of course, I can only hit the highlights of these. Most of the mentions of cherub are recorded in reference to how they were handcrafted and put into the tabernacle Moses and also the temple of Solomon. But in Genesis 3:24, cherub cherubs guarded the tree of life with flaming swords on earth. And then Exodus 25 18- 22 speak of the cherub or cherubam that faced each other on top of the ark of the covenant. They had two wings that touched one another. They faced each other where God communed with the high priest. And then there's many mentions of course of God dwelling between the cherubams in heaven in the Old Testament as well. Psalm 18:10 is very interesting. It says God rides on the wings of cherub. So it seems like God uses cherubam to come down and minister to the believers on earth perhaps, but I'm not exactly certain of that. And fourth, cherubims are mentioned in Ezekiel chapter 10. They're also called living creatures in Ezekiel 10:20. And the Bible says there's coals of fire between the cherubams. So we know cherubams are near the coals of fire in heaven. And that also relates to the fourth type of angel called saraphim. But before we get to saraphim, Lucifer was the anointed cherub that coverth in Ezekiel 28 14 and 16. So God's adversary. Lucifer or Satan was a cherub to begin with, but pride exalted his heart. According to Isaiah chapter 14, I believe. Also related to cherub are the living creatures. Again, Ezekiel 10:14 and 15. These creatures have four faces a piece. They have a face of a cherub, man, lion, and eagle. very similar to the four living creatures or the four beasts or four zunes in Revelation 4:es 6-8. So I don't quite understand the differences there. So the face of the ox is missing in Ezekiel 10, but the face of the ox of course is present in Revelation 4 6-8. So I'm not sure why there's a change there. Perhaps they're different creatures. I don't know. Of course I'm open to learning, open to more Bible scriptures that would give revelation. But one thing's for sure, in eternity, we'll fully understand all these things by the grace of the Lord. The fourth kind of angel is the saraphim. They're called fiery or burners in Hebrew. There's only two occurrences in Isaiah 6:es 2 and verse 6. They carried a live coal in their hand with tongs to lay it on Isaiah's mouth to cleanse him from his iniquity. Brother Ram said, "If that ain't a dressed up servant, I don't know what is." Speaking of the seraraphim, brother Ram preached numerous messages on influence related to Isaiah and his influence he gained from his vision of seeing the Lord high and lifted up in Isaiah chapter 6. Brother Ram said, "If that ain't a dressed up servant, I don't know what is. Reverent, humble, and in action. Oh my, I tell you." So the three sets of wings, Brother Ram typed as reverence, humility, and action. Now the fifth kind of angel is the ministering spirit or guardian angel spoken of in Hebrews 1:14. The angels are sent to them that would be the heirs of salvation. So I believe these would be also called the guardian angels. The Bible said the angel Lord encamps around them that fear God. So that's found in Psalm 34:7. And Jesus said the angel of the children always behold the face of my father which is in heaven. in Matthew 18:10. So, it seems like ministering spirits or ministering angels are a different kind of angel or they could be cherubs. I don't know. But since I don't know, I'm just going to make this a separate group here. A fifth group of angels called ministering spirits or ministering angels or we might call them guardian angels. Now the sixth and final type of angel which again might be another kind of angel I'm not sure are called watchers in Daniel 4:es 131 17 and 23 they are sent from heaven to execute decrees in the case of Daniel chapter 4 this watcher is executing a a decree against Nebuchadnezzar the Bible said Daniel saw a watcher and an holy one come down from heaven delivers a decree of the watchers in verse 17 and a demand by the word of the holy ones. And then in verse 24, it says, "This is the decree of the most high which has come upon my lord the king." So I don't know if watchers are cherub or some other type of angel I've already listed. I don't know for sure or if they're their own separate type of angel. When I did a quick Bible search, I didn't find the word watcher in any other places other than Daniel chapter 4. So by God's grace, let's move on to the next section. Various attributes of angels. Now the word angel means messenger in both the Greek and Hebrew. Uh the Bible says in Hebrews 13:2 that we can entertain angels unawares. Now that would mean that an angel would come down sent from God but then it would take on a flesh body kind of like what happened to Gideon also Abraham in Genesis chapter 18 where Abraham saw three men. It was God's theophony covered in flesh and then two angels who had theophanes that were covered in flesh as well. Well, they look like regular men, in other words, but they were angels. Numerous other Bible characters were entertaining angels and not certain they were angels. I believe Samson's parents had that experience as well. The Bible says in Luke 15:10, there's joy in the presence of the angels over one sinner that repents. So again, I'm not certain if the angels are rejoicing or if it's the rejoicing of the repentant one and those humans who are watching this sinner become a believer, repent of his sins. But the Bible does say there is rejoicing in the presence of angels when sinners repent. Angels are involved in warfare. Like in Daniel chapter 10:es 10- 21, Daniel's angel was helped by Michael to break through the spiritual wrestling match to bring Daniel understanding after a 21-day wrestling match. And then the angel went and returned to the fight after delivering the revelation from God to Daniel. In 2 Kings 19:35, the angel of the Lord smokeote 185,000 Assyrians under Hezekiah's reign. So friends, we got to keep that in mind. The power of angels. If we just have one guardian angel, it's enough to protect us, minister to us. That again assures us if we're called home to heaven at any time, it would be God's will. God allowed it. But if God wants to protect us, surely he can do that because one angel can easily defeat over 185,000 men. Matthew 26:53 tells us that Jesus had access of over 12 legions of angels. He could have called for them, but he didn't in order to fulfill the scripture as God's suffering servant. And praise God to give us eternal salvation through his shed blood. And then finally, Elisha and a servant in 2 Kings 6:16-17 realized there was a mountain full of horses and chariots of fire round about them. So God let Elisha be aware of this host of angels, this angel army that surrounded them and that encouraged Elisha's servant to know that God was protecting them. Now friends, I don't know if an angel army surrounds every believer, but in this case, God let Elisha and the servant see that they had plenty of protection from heaven by the grace of God. The last one I'll share is Matthew 4:11. How the devil left Jesus after his temptation, and behold, angels came and ministered unto him. So again, we get this idea of God sending angels to minister to our spiritual needs after difficult battles. So if we're ever refreshed after a season of difficult trials, tribulations, and so forth, and that would be the angels of the Lord or the angel of the Lord ministering to us and strengthening us. That reminds us again of how as Elijah was under the juniper tree in First Kings 19:5 and an angel touched him and said, "Arise and eat." So it's wonderful to know that God sends his angels when we have need of it. Remember Elijah wanted to die, but God sent his angel instead to strengthen him, give him courage. Such a comfort to know that God will send his angel to us when we need supernatural strength, when we need help from heaven. Lastly, let's look at brother Ram's angel here by God's grace. I first want to start by reading this quote from 1955. How the angel came to me and his commission from Chicago, Illinois. Brother Ram said, "The angel of the Lord that comes is not the Lord Jesus. It doesn't look like him in the same vision. He said, "When I saw the Lord Jesus, he was a little man when he was out praying for his dad in a sagebrush field." He said, "Jesus had a white garment on, a little fellow, had his arms folded like this, a beard kind of short, hair down to his shoulders." The next quote is from Expectation 1950. Brother Ram said, "The angel that followed him, not the Lord Jesus, was a big large man about 200 lb, dark hair to his shoulder." I used chat gtp to make the thumbnail and the image of the angel was from AI and I just put this description from brother Brandham into the AI and that's what it produced. And the final quote is from El Shadi 1959. Brother Ram speaking about the pillar of fire picture from Houston Coliseum 1950. And brother Ram calls that the same pillar of fire that followed the children of Israel. So if that's the case, then that pillar fire picture is the Lord Jesus, the angel of the covenant. And that would make sense because brother Random was restoring the truce of the new covenant or the new testament to the bride here at the end of the leosian church age because it had been lost during the church age. So God had to start restoring it through Martin Luther, John Wesley, William Seymour, and then God's prophet, brother William Brandham. Brother Random said, "Here it is, the pillar fire back again today, dwelling in all of us, the universal church, doing the same thing. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever." In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. It's great to review these truths and to know that when we need ministering to, when we need strength, God sends out his angels to us to help us by the grace of God. I love this verse from Isaiah 63:9. In all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them. In his love and in his pity he redeemed them and bare them and carried them all the days of old. The reason I love this is because it shows that any angel of the Lord that comes to us brings the presence of God, the holy presence of God. So when we feel the presence of the Lord, it could be the Lord Jesus himself or it could be the angel Lord because the angel Lord carries his presence or a ministering spirit. we'd say a ministering angel, our guardian angel, sent to us. And I love how God said he's sending the angel in his love and his pity to the redeemed. And we are redeemed. We're bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ. Jesus paid our ransom, our debt. He purchased us with his holy blood. We belong to him. So, he sends his ministering spirits to bring us what we have need of. The Bible said he bore them and carried them all the days of old. And that's the same for us. It is God's spirit through his angels that is carrying us, protecting us all the days of our lives. We have so much to be thankful for and rejoice in. So friends, let's thank God for his protection, his guardian angels. Let's be constantly aware of their presence. As brother Ram said, let's live so close to God like Zachariah and Elizabeth so that God will visit us just like he visited Zechariah. And again, this was not a deep study by any means, but I was blessed as I was spending a few hours in this study. Please let me know any mistakes I made. Perhaps I can make a part two or if there's additional questions, I could do a part two with questions and answers by God's grace. Praise God for the angel of his presence. Thank God that we get to enjoy the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. [Music] &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed. [Music]
