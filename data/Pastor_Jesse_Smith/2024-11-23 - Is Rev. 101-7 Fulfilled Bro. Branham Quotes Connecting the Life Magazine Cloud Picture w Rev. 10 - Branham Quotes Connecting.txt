========================================
[Music] just as they picked up that light Hunter and put it in Life Magazine of the opening of the seals of the revealing in the age of the seventh angel in the days of his ministry the seventh messenger the mysteries of God which all the Mysteries have been along the ages should be revealed greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ are there any quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham that connect the Fulfillment of Revelation 10:7 with the 1963 February 28th Arizona Cloud recently I was asked this question so I found four quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham that connect the fulfilling of Revelation 10:7 to the February 28th cloud and so that's what this video will cover by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet brother William Marin Brenham who lived from 1909 to 1965 also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character so yes friends I found four quotes where brother Bram connects the February 28th 1963 Arizona cloud with the Fulfillment of Revelation 10:7 before that though I want to remind our viewers that I have a video called four reasons I believe the cloud was Supernatural the February 28th 1963 Arizona cloud and again brother bill rostran has a video with scientific evidence which I believe and of course many message Believers believe prove the cloud was of Supernatural origin so I would encourage you to watch that if you have any questions about that by the grace of God so let's go through the four quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham linking the cloud with the Fulfillment of Revelation 10:7 and I'll go in chronologically order by the grace of God the first quote is from April 12th 1963 the world is falling apart brother BR said just a few days ago them seven angels come down when the prophecy said go to Tucson and wait there for a while and you'll hear a blast go off and then he said the Seven Seals were opened at the Tabernacle the other day he said Remember the sounding of the seventh angel the mystery of God was finished and there come an angel from heaven and swore with his hands raised from Heaven Revelation 10 1-7 that time would be no more exactly right the hour so brother random connects Revelation 10 1-7 being fulfilled with the blast that went off when he was in Tucson so first we'll listen to this quote from Worlds falling apart and then we'll play the prophetic quote from is this the sign of the answer where brother Ram talked about that same blast brother Ram was given the vision to go out west to meet the seven angels and that's when the picture of the cloud appeared appeared brother R actually called this a prophecy in the name of the Lord it was a vision a prophetic Vision that he received in December 1962 to go out west meet the seven angels and there he'd be sent back by the spirit of God back to Jeffersonville to preach the revelation of the Seven Seals so let's listen to this quote from the world's falling apart 1963 just a few days ago and them Seven Angels Came Down that Vision many of you KN it said go to Tucson and wait there for a while you'll hear a blast go off when it goes return back in the 7 seals were open at the Tabernacle the other day when I seen people coming from standing there at 3:00 in the morning and get a place to get into the auditorium and so forth sin the hungry Hearts coming from everywhere I thought oh God we're bound to be at the end now remember the sounding of the seventh angel the mysteries of God was finished and there come an angel from heaven and swore with his hands raised from Heaven Revelations 10 1-7 the time would be no more exactly right the hour what church is he coming to the church that we're living in the ladyo seea church age the Church age now friends let's listen to the quote where brother brand prophesied of this blast going off and then the appearance of the cloud seven angels meeting with brother brandham in March 1963 and of course we know brother brandham wasn't physically under the cloud on February 28th 1963 the earliest he could have been there was sometime early in March of 1963 but we know he could have been there by translation just as Ezekiel was translated by the Holy Spirit he was translated by Vision so either brother R was translated on February 28th or the cloud reappeared to brother brandham in early March 1963 but let's listen to the quote from is this the sign of the answerer brother Bram talks about the blast going off and a snow white pyramid a constellation and that's speaking of the supernatural cloud from February 28th 1963 brother brand thought it would be a blast that would kill him of course it didn't mean that and then I'll ahead to a further quote in that same sermon is this a sign of the answer brother Ram said remember I tell you in the name of the Lord I've told you the truth and something is fixing to happen so that was the prophetic statement in the name of the Lord that brother Brandon would experience this blast out in Arizona he'd be met by seven angels that will commission him to go back to Jeffersonville and reveal the Seven Seals which would be the beginning of the Fulfillment of Revelation 10 1:7 let's listen to the prophecy from 1962 I could see those angels those shaped back Wings traveling faster than sound could travel they come from eternity in a split like a twinkling of an eye not enough to batch your I just a twinkle they were there I didn't have time to count I didn't have time more than this look mighty ones great powerful angels Snow White Wing setting heads and they were and when it did I was caught up into this pyramid of constellations and I thought now this is it I was numbed all over and I said oh my this means that there will be a blast that will kill me I'm standing in an awful place if you but knew it remember I tell you in the name of the Lord I've told you the truth and something's fixing to happen the second quote where brother brandom connects Revelation 107's fulfillment with the Arizona cloud is from January 12th 1964 it's in the message Shalom this is a lengthy quote but I just want to highlight how brother brandom said the 7th messenger all these Mysteries should be finished the seventh Earthly messenger and then he said after that he saw another angel coming down speaking of Christ with a rainbow over him set his foot on the land and sea brother BR said but before he broke forth on those Seven Seals to reveal them that he showed miraculous he showed it first in the heavens that day they took pictures all across Southern United States of Mexico there it hangs now in Life Magazine so brother Ram connects himself as the seventh Church AG messenger of Revelation 10:7 and then Christ coming down to Commission him to preach the revelation of the Seven Seals as fulfillment of Revelation 10:7 and then a few paragraphs later in paragraph 80 he said the seventh messenger the mystery of God which all the Mysteries has been along the ages should be revealed made manifest it should be at that time he did it his words don't fail so brother R said this is done in the past he did it Revelation 10:7 is fulfilled and then skipping ahead to paragraph 170 he said in the church age the seventh Angel's message would be that last message we find over here in Revelation 10 in the days of the message of the seventh angel the mystery of God should be finished then all at once when it's happening a vision broke go to Tucson a great noise speaking of the great blast brother Ram said all of you know about it it's on tape months before it happened then it happened then appeared in the sky Shalom or God's peace so brother Ram said God is giving us peace that he's fulfilled Revelation 10 1:7 the supernatural cloud from February 28th from Life Magazine was Christ coming down to commission brother brandham to preach the revelation of the Seven Seals let's listen to the quotes but did you notice before the Seven Seals was revealed before the great mysterious light showed forth in the heavens uh up here at above Tucson Flag Staff where we were brother Fred to of the man that was the the two man was with me that morning when that would been told months and months ahead of time would happen both brother Fred sopan and brother Jee Norman sitting here this morning when it was there when the blast went off and not knowing these things would take place and he sent me back said that the time was at hand for these Seven Seals which held the seven Mysteries of the entire Bible was sealed in with these Seven Seals and how these angels down Ong the road Messengers and the church ages open to a certain part of that but in the seventh hour the seventh messenger that all these Mysteries should be finished the seventh Earthly messenger see this angel that he speaks of then was on Earth uh angel means messenger and then after that he saw another angel coming down not the Earthly angel that had been given the message here but the another Mighty angel came from heaven with a rainbow over him and set his foot on the land and sea and swore by him that lives forever and ever time shall be no more but before he broke forth on those Seven Seals to reveal them that he so miraculous he showed it first in the heavens amen that day they took pictures all across Southern United States of Mexico there it hangs down the Life Magazine he still a mystery to them but he declares it in the heavens before he does it on Earth he always does that he shows his signs in the heavens first did any of you see the paper where they tuck the pictures of the Moon I have it here if it ain't a perfect image leaving out the seventh age which is not yet exactly the way I draw by the Holy Spirit the church ages amen there's the six of them the seventh is not finished yet the six conditions of the Moon how in its brightness in the first church age dark inness second third fourth fifth and sixth just the way the holy spirit let me draw them on the board and then identify them with his on the wall of the Tabernacle two years ago the moon reflects itself and science again picks up the picture of the church ages amen amen just as they picked up that light under and put it in Life Magazine of the opening of the seals are the revealing in the age of the seventh angel in the days of his ministry the seventh messenger the mysteries of God which all the Mysteries has been along the ages should be revealed made manifest it should be at that time amen and he did it am his words don't fail isn't that a mysterious thing God drawing in the heavens the same thing that the whole same God let me draw on the Blackboard and then by himself that's three times he's perfectly identified amen and just before the pope goes in uh to Jerusalem we heard the word say that in the days of the seventh angel in the church age had just said the seventh Angel's message would be the last message and then what we find out over here in Revelations 10 in the days of the message of the seventh angel the mysteries of God should be finished the seventh seal would be pulled back amen it should be there and all at once was is happening a vision broke say go to Tucson amen a great noise will take place at this time so you be thoroughly understanding and know that sent it'll just shake the Earth nearly amen all of you know about it it's own tape months before it happened that happened amen that appeared in the skies Shalom what is it it's a changing beats the sympathy the third quote post from marriage and divorce February 21st 1965 brother brandom said Revelation the 10th chapter Jesus Promised it all these hidden mysteries on marriage and divorce would be revealed in the end time and you remember the voice said go to Tucson remember the Mystic light in the sky the seventh angel standing there come back and the opening of The Seven Seals watch what's taking place that is true so again brother Ram connects Revelation 10:7 all the Mysteries to his Vision about going west to Tucson and the light in the sky which would have been the Bright White Snow White Cloud that was pictured in Life Magazine brother Bram said that is true let's listen to the quote now on the marriage and divorce it has to be revealed until it's revealed you don't know it but he promised in this last days in this age that every hidden Mystery in the Bible would be revealed how many know is that Revelations the 10th chapter Jesus Promised it that all all these hidden mysteries on on marriage and divorce all these other Hidden Mysteries has been would be revealed in the end time now you remember the voice said go to Tucson remember the Mystic light in the skies the Seven Angels standing there come back in the opening of The Seven Seals watch what's taking place that is true next friends I'm going to put an additional quote in here again it's lengthy this quote doesn't mention Revelation 10:7 but it does mention the Life Magazine picture and brother Bram said that picture he said it's Christ brother Braham took time to talk about this picture and it is the rising of the Sun April 18th 1965 his Easter message is final Easter message brother Ram connects the opening of The Seven Seals the revelation of marriage and divorce the serpent seed all these different questions brother R links all these Mysteries being revealed to the Life Magazine picture of the class and brother ROM said it's Christ so we see brother random indirectly linking the revelation of the Seven Seals which was his vision about going out west to Tucson the prophecy that he had to go out west to meet the seven angels come back and preach the revelation of the Seven Seals brother linking that experience the mysteries of being finished with the Life Magazine picture let's listen to the quote realizing that our time is limited here especially for those friends who are listening in by this telephone I would like to call your attention this morning to a a picture at some time ago was taken by uh the camera of a vision that I had here at the Tabernacle of leaving Indiana to Arizona where I was to meet in a farm of a pyramid seven angels not knowing what would happen later when I got there thinking it was the end of my life but no one could stand the blast and I'm sure all of you are acquainted with the story and then in Sabia Canyon one morning like this while in prayer there had been a sword placed in my hand and said this is the word and the sword of the word later the Angels appeared as was prophesied and at the same time a great cluster of light left where I was standing and moved 30 miles high in the air and around the circle like the wings of the angels and draw into the skies the shape of a pyramid in the same constellation of angels that appeared science took the picture all the way from Mexico as moved from northern Arizona where the holy spirit said I would be standing 40 miles Northeast of Tucson and it went into the air and Life Magazine packed the pictures a Mystic something way in the Spheres where there could be no moisture where there can be no evaporations of anything 30 mil high and 27 miles across and coming right up from where those angels were now they asked to know science the one of them at Tucson wanted to know any significance but I didn't tell them you all knew it told beforehand but it wasn't for them it was for you and so there he spoke to me and said the Seven Seals will be open the seven Mysteries seven F mystery of the Bible that's been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed and we yet a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these Blessings Now hearing those Mysteries marriage divorce serpent seeds all these different questions has been completely uh revealed to us not by man but by God himself let's open those seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in Christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in the last days and now as this went we have the picture outside on the plaque but then I have the picture link present here if you notice as Life Magazine had it but I wonder if my audience visible here has ever really looked at the picture see see and the way it should be you remember I was preaching when this Vision Came Upon the subject of the book of the revelations were the old judges where we've seen Jesus in Revelations one when we started to open the Seven Seals of the or the church ages rather just prior to the opening of The Seven field Christ was standing with hair like wool white and I described that to you that the old English judges and judges of long ago when they went to the bench to be sworn in their supreme authority was given them they wore a white wig as it was over their heads to show their supreme authority well if you'll turn the picture like this and look you can probably see it from the audience it's Christ see his eyes looking here just as perfect as it could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and judge of all heavens and earth when you see his eyes nose his mouth just turn the picture from this way they had it this way the way it's supposed to be and can you see it he is supreme judge there's none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a Vindication this message is the truth it is true and making him not a third person but the only person with a white see you see the dark his face his beard his eyes and notice he's looking from him comes this light shining on the right hand side to which he's looking to on the cross that's where he look to the right or he pardoned The Sinner in the light of his resurrection we still go forth in his name I wish this morning that I had just much time to to stand upon these phenomenas that's beyond any Shadow of Doubt been proven for the past 30 years or 35 years right here at this church that's down on the river when that same light came down here in Jeffersonville in 1933 and spoke those words as John the Baptist was sent the for run the first coming of Christ your message will before run the second we're at the end time and we see it we wonder sometimes why it hasn't spread over the Earth maybe sometime we'll have a chance to explain that if God willing now and finally the fourth and last quote is from July 25th 1965 what is the attraction on the mountain brother Ram's talking about Christ he's talking about the Life Magazine picture he said turn the picture to the right there is Jesus as he was in the seventh Church age the white wig gone Alpha and Omega first and last Supreme judge then brother Ram said what's happened upon Mount Sunset God confirming his word it's God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelation 10 1:7 then brother Ram begins talking about the scientists and all through Tucson still writing about the supernatural cloud from February 28th 1963 but talks about the observatories and all those in Tucson still asking what did it where is it at brother Braham said they're just as puzzled of that Supernatural Halo hanging Yonder in the sky as they was when the Magi came in following a star saying where is he that's born King of the Jews what is it God fulfilling his word so that's a pretty amazing statement in comparison of brother brandham he's comparing the picture from Life Magazine with the star of Jacob that the Magi followed to find Christ brother said the god of Heaven promised the evening time would have light three years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir so again referencing the vision the prophetic Vision he gave from December 30th 1962 he said but now it's history it's pass the promis is fulfilled what time is it sir and what's this attraction God fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever so again brother random saying Revelation 1 10-7 is history it's fulfilled it was a prophecy but now it's fulfilled and it was God vindicating Revelation 10 1- 7's fulfillment supernaturally with a sign in the skies just as when the star of Jacob Vindicated Jesus's birth let's listen to the quote and the other day standing there turned the picture to the right and there's Jesus as he was in the seven Church ages the white wig on showing Supreme deity he's Alpha and Omega he's the first and the last he is the Supreme judge of all eternity standing there to confirm the message of this hour and there shall be light about the evening time what's it all about what was it what's happened up on Mount Sunset God confirming his word that's what all this noise is about notice it's God fulfilling his promised word again of Revelations 10 1:7 and in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelations 10 1-7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills exactly in this age St Luke 17:30 the day when the son of man shall be revealed and there shall rise false prophets and false Christ show great signs and wonders in so much to De see the elected if possible the people still in doubt and as usual the church is just as puzzled and the science all through Tucson yet they're writing PE pieces and putting the paper way back over there on Mount Limon them big cameras didn't see it rising up from where we were standing drifting on towards the West showing the time is over it can't go with a little peace there it's at the West Coast judgment struck just the very way it went going right up over Phoenix right on across onto Prescott across the mountains to the West Coast right on up into where was they going right on up into Alaska and she's thundering heading right that way and the observatories and all of them in Tucson are still asking research of science trying to find out what it is so high there can't be fog mist or nothing up there what did it where's it at they're just as puzzled at that Supernatural Halo hanging there in the sky as it was when the Magi come in following a star saying where is he that's born King of the Jews what was it God fulfilling his word there shall rise a star out of Jacob and the god of Heaven promised the evening time would have evening lights three years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir but now it's history it's past the promise is fulfilled what time is it sir and what's this attraction God fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever let us pray in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God this was an excellent question I received from one of the Saints who I thought I'd share these four quotes and that fifth quote is also very encouraging as well cuz brother randam says that picture the cloud picture was Christ he said it's Christ friends we're so blessed to have received a genuine prophet of God brother William Mar and brandham finish the mystery of God every Bible defined mystery God used brother renam to give us the true revelation of it so we rejoice in that we humbly make ourselves ready the bride has made herself ready for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ we're constantly watching and praying looking for the coming of the Lord and again the Bible says Jesus will appear to all those that love his appearing so we love the Lord Jesus Christ and we love his appearing to his holy ghost filled Gentile bride if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
