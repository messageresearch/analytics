[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] sometimes great guys get together europe
[0:06] say great so and so great so-and-so are
[0:08] great don't never do that
[0:11] there's no great ones among us
[0:13] there's only one great one and that's
[0:15] god
[0:17] greetings friends in the name above all
[0:20] names the lord jesus christ
[0:22] the purpose of this video is to warn
[0:24] christians
[0:25] specifically message believers about the
[0:28] sin of pride that seems to be anointing
[0:31] preachers that i observed over the past
[0:33] few years
[0:35] this sin of pride seems to be
[0:37] manifesting itself in some message
[0:39] preachers that i've observed online
[0:41] as they have publicly and repeatedly
[0:43] declared that they are the greatest
[0:45] christians of all time along with
[0:47] declaring brother branham as the
[0:49] greatest prophet of all time
[0:52] these preachers claims about being the
[0:54] goats of christianity are complete
[0:57] presumption
[0:58] as there seems to be no bible support
[1:00] for their claims as far as i can find in
[1:02] scripture
[1:03] and of course i am always open to
[1:05] correction
[1:06] there's also no quotes from brother
[1:08] branham that support their claims as
[1:10] being goats alongside brother branham
[1:14] it's a sad spiritual state for these
[1:16] message preachers to be in as they've
[1:18] repeatedly exalted themselves and
[1:20] brother branham as the goats of
[1:22] christianity
[1:23] friends this is likely a result of
[1:25] living pridefully in laodicea being rich
[1:28] and increased with goods and it seems
[1:30] their riches have freed them from having
[1:32] burdens on their hearts for the lost the
[1:35] poor the sick the afflicted and other
[1:38] hurting people that they seem to have
[1:40] time to publicly spend time ranking
[1:42] themselves as greater than all the
[1:44] christians including martin luther john
[1:47] wesley charles spurgeon jonathan edwards
[1:50] charles finney polycarp justin martyr
[1:54] six of the church age messengers
[1:56] including saint paul and jesus's 11
[1:58] faithful disciples who were all martyred
[2:01] and saint john who died a natural death
[2:04] just to name a few
[2:06] by the discernment gift of the holy
[2:08] ghost we should be able to judge the two
[2:10] spirits within the framework of the
[2:12] church
[2:13] so which spirit is causing some message
[2:15] preachers and their churches to exalt
[2:18] themselves as the goats of christianity
[2:21] i believe it's an evil spirit of pride
[2:24] and i also believe these claims as the
[2:26] goats of christianity are the beginning
[2:29] of a doctrine of nicolaitans as brother
[2:32] am taught us from revelation chapters 2
[2:33] and 3 in the church ages series
[2:36] remember these doctrines of nicolaitans
[2:39] begin as sayings then become doctrines
[2:42] and then they become the unbending way
[2:45] so as far as i've heard online thus far
[2:47] it is only a saying that they are the
[2:49] greatest christians of all time
[2:51] i've never heard them use scripture
[2:54] to make this presumption that they are
[2:55] the greatest of all time
[2:57] so i hope this video will be a help to
[2:59] bring these brothers to repentance by
[3:00] the grace of god
[3:03] here's the outline for the video
[3:05] first we'll look at the origin of this
[3:07] pride observation
[3:09] second we'll look at bible teaching on
[3:11] pride and brother branham quotes about
[3:14] pride
[3:15] including his personal battle with it
[3:18] third we'll look at the specific
[3:20] examples of prideful declarations of
[3:22] today's message preachers
[3:25] fourth we'll look at the true goat jesus
[3:29] fifth we'll look at who might be the
[3:31] greatest christian servants
[3:33] with the greatest rewards of course
[3:35] outside of jesus christ
[3:38] and six will end with a plea for
[3:40] humility
[3:43] origin of this pride observation
[3:46] the first observation i saw of message
[3:48] preachers and churches exalting
[3:51] themselves was branham tabernacle in
[3:53] august 2020 and again in december of the
[3:56] same year
[3:58] i have closely followed branham
[4:00] tabernacle's pastor's teachings since
[4:03] 2015 when branham tabernacle voted in
[4:06] new leadership
[4:07] it was immediately thereafter that i
[4:09] became very concerned about the false
[4:11] doctrines that began to come out of
[4:12] their church as of this moment today in
[4:15] july of 2022 i have counted and recorded
[4:19] 18 false teachings from branham
[4:21] tabernacle and they're propagating these
[4:23] false doctrines to millions around the
[4:25] world
[4:27] one of which is the presumption that
[4:29] brother branham and they themselves are
[4:31] the greatest of all time
[4:34] now i'm going to read the exact quotes
[4:36] and i've already reached out to branham
[4:37] tabernacle in hopes they would repent of
[4:39] this but they have not responded to me
[4:42] anyone can go on their website branham
[4:44] tabernacle dot org and search for these
[4:47] declarations and easily find them
[4:50] so the first statement is from august
[4:52] first two thousand twenty brother joseph
[4:54] writes quote and today he has sent the
[4:57] greatest prophet of all time
[4:58] william marion branham to lead his bride
[5:01] end quote
[5:03] now friends notice he never said the
[5:05] greatest prophet of all time outside of
[5:07] jesus christ so it seems to be the deity
[5:09] spirit that has anointed branham
[5:11] tabernacle to exalt brother branham
[5:13] higher than jesus christ
[5:15] and if they did not mean that why have
[5:17] they not corrected it in these two years
[5:19] since posting this
[5:22] then in december of the same year
[5:24] brother joseph on the website wrote
[5:26] quote
[5:27] it is the greatest age of all time with
[5:29] the greatest messenger of all time who
[5:31] is gathering the greatest people of all
[5:34] time end quote
[5:37] friends it is incredibly sad that these
[5:39] supposed jeffersonville christians are
[5:42] so bold and prideful to participate in
[5:45] the goat debate placing themselves at
[5:47] the top of the podium when there is no
[5:50] bible command to exalt themselves so
[5:52] highly and so we can see as a total act
[5:55] of pride complete presumption
[5:58] shortly after reading these posts online
[6:00] i began hearing some of the message
[6:02] preachers i have respected most declare
[6:05] they were either the greatest preachers
[6:07] of all time or among the greatest
[6:09] preachers of all time
[6:11] this truly disheartened me and i began
[6:13] to save the video clips of these public
[6:15] declarations
[6:17] then it struck me both groups were now
[6:19] saying the same thing
[6:21] the tape worshipers or jeffersonville
[6:23] tape people were publicly declaring
[6:26] their absolute greatness above all other
[6:28] church ages along with some of the
[6:30] fivefold preachers
[6:32] both of these groups claim to oppose one
[6:34] another
[6:35] but they agree that they are the
[6:37] greatest of all time
[6:39] when i saw both camps
[6:41] the tape camp and the fivefold camp
[6:43] saying the same thing i knew it was a
[6:45] dangerous spiritual condition to be in
[6:47] because i've witnessed how the tape
[6:49] church movement has repeatedly denied
[6:51] the gospel of jesus christ by their 18
[6:54] plus false doctrines
[6:56] brother branham taught us in the church
[6:57] age book that the prophet the holy
[6:59] spirit and the bride would all be saying
[7:01] the same thing and what they said would
[7:04] already be said in the word of god
[7:06] let's listen to part of the quote
[7:08] yes listen to the authenticated prophet
[7:10] of god who appears in this last age
[7:13] what he says from god the bride will say
[7:16] the spirit and the prophet and the bride
[7:18] will be saying the same thing
[7:20] and what they will say will have already
[7:22] been said in the word
[7:24] they are saying it now
[7:27] friends the word holy spirit prophet and
[7:30] bride do not say the laosei and
[7:32] believers and brother branham are the
[7:34] greatest christians of all time so their
[7:36] self exaltations cannot be true
[7:40] by the discernment of the holy ghost the
[7:42] judging of spirits it seems a spirit of
[7:45] haughtiness or pride has infected some
[7:47] very prominent message preachers and
[7:50] their churches
[7:52] after praying about this subject
[7:53] preaching numerous sermons about the
[7:55] subject of the sin of pride i felt led
[7:58] to the holy ghost to make a video
[8:00] warning for both groups
[8:01] so that they may repent of this sinful
[8:03] trend
[8:04] of message preachers and believers being
[8:07] prideful and exalting themselves as the
[8:09] greatest of all time
[8:11] god's word will not return void so he
[8:13] that exalts himself will be abased
[8:16] and he that humbles himself will be
[8:18] exalted
[8:20] i'm offering this warning and rebuke of
[8:22] the sin of pride without calling names
[8:25] other than joseph branham because i've
[8:27] already made videos about him and
[8:28] contacted him personally and now he
[8:30] won't return my emails and lord willing
[8:33] i'll send letters or emails separately
[8:35] to the preachers who have made their
[8:37] claims as being the goats of
[8:38] christianity in hopes it will help them
[8:40] humble themselves under the mighty hand
[8:43] of god according to the scriptures
[8:46] bible teaching on pride and brother
[8:48] branham quotes about pride including his
[8:50] personal battle with it
[8:54] in the greek lexicon pride is defined as
[8:56] self-confidence
[8:58] boasting
[8:59] for a modern definition the new oxford
[9:01] dictionary has a very similar definition
[9:04] two of the definitions say consciousness
[9:06] of one's own dignity or honor
[9:09] and the quality of having it an
[9:11] excessively high opinion of oneself or
[9:14] one's importance
[9:16] first john 2 verses 15 through 17
[9:19] teaches their only three avenues of
[9:21] temptation
[9:22] message people if they're faithful will
[9:25] likely battle pride the most because
[9:27] they already have the sanctification
[9:29] anointing of temperance which gives the
[9:31] believer self-control over bodily
[9:33] passions meaning the lust of the eyes
[9:35] and the lust of the flesh
[9:37] as seen on this image of the stature of
[9:39] a perfect man
[9:42] it seems pride will be the biggest
[9:44] struggle of genuine message believers
[9:47] but we can all overcome it by the grace
[9:49] of jesus christ
[9:50] through repentance and humility
[9:52] i'll begin with first peter 5 verses 5
[9:55] through 9.
[9:56] peter tells us to be clothed with
[9:58] humility
[9:59] for god resists us the proud and giveth
[10:01] grace to the humble
[10:03] humble yourselves therefore under the
[10:04] mighty hand of god that he may exalt you
[10:07] in due time
[10:09] the greek lexicon defines humility as
[10:12] having a humble opinion of oneself a
[10:14] deep sense of one's moral littleness
[10:18] modesty humility lowliness of mind
[10:21] the next verses first peter 3 7 and
[10:24] malachi 2 verses 14 through 16
[10:27] tell us that god resists the proud and
[10:29] will not hear their
[10:30] prayers proverbs 16 verse 18 says pride
[10:34] goeth before the fall
[10:36] proverbs 13 verse 10 says contention
[10:39] comes only by pride and peace is a great
[10:42] blessing
[10:44] psalm 10 verse 4 and 2nd chronicles 26
[10:48] verses 5 and 16 teach pride will not
[10:51] seek god
[10:54] so my question is did these message
[10:56] preachers seek god before declaring they
[10:59] are the goats of christianity
[11:01] and if god did tell them this can they
[11:03] speak it now with thus saith the lord so
[11:05] we can know god told them to say this
[11:08] and then can they provide a genesis to
[11:10] revelation teaching on it with at least
[11:12] two or three bible witnesses to prove
[11:14] their doctrine
[11:15] as brother branham taught every teaching
[11:17] must be taught from genesis to
[11:18] revelation
[11:20] here's a few quotes from brother branham
[11:22] that show pride is a horrible spirit to
[11:24] have
[11:27] [Applause]
[11:40] oh
[11:55] is pride
[11:57] see
[11:58] i told you about the prophets
[12:05] [Music]
[12:06] [Applause]
[12:11] now i'd like to play a quote where
[12:12] brother branham says don't never do that
[12:15] don't never say you're great
[12:17] let's listen to the quote
[12:19] influence
[12:21] sometimes great guys get together europe
[12:24] say great so-and-so great so-and-so our
[12:26] great don't never do that
[12:29] there's no great ones among us
[12:31] there's only one great one and that's
[12:33] god
[12:34] we are brothers sisters
[12:37] i don't care if your pastor church got
[12:39] five people in
[12:40] i don't make you little
[12:43] that makes you a brother
[12:46] based upon this quote where brother
[12:48] branham said don't never do that
[12:51] this select group of message preachers
[12:53] are not saying what the tapes say
[12:55] since the tapes say to never call each
[12:57] other great one of the greatest or the
[13:00] greatest of all time
[13:02] i'd also like to address that numerous
[13:04] message preachers say today's message is
[13:07] the greatest message of all time
[13:09] but is that what the bible and brother
[13:11] branham said
[13:12] just to show we need more balance and
[13:14] humility here's a quote where brother
[13:16] branham said jesus already gave the
[13:18] greatest message any man could ever get
[13:20] on resurrection morning
[13:22] if brother branham was right then how
[13:24] could the laodicean message be greater
[13:26] than the resurrection message
[13:28] since brother random said no message
[13:30] could ever be greater let's listen to
[13:32] the quote our visions come in the old
[13:35] testament but every man went right to
[13:37] the grave wondering would he ever rise
[13:40] again but on easter morning when these
[13:43] disciples got the greatest message that
[13:45] any man could ever get
[13:47] what did they get
[13:49] go
[13:50] tell my disciples i am risen from the
[13:53] dead
[13:54] death had been conquered
[13:57] additionally in 1964
[13:59] white had to be shepherds brother ram
[14:01] said the shepherds had the greatest
[14:03] message
[14:04] he said it was the greatest of all the
[14:06] messages
[14:07] and the message was the messiah is here
[14:09] now
[14:10] if brother branham can't be corrected
[14:12] then why aren't the message preachers
[14:14] saying what the tapes say and
[14:16] apologizing for saying they're the
[14:17] greatest christians of all time with the
[14:19] greatest message of all time and
[14:21] actually the shepherds that heard about
[14:23] jesus's birth about him being on the
[14:25] earth at that time was the greatest of
[14:27] all messages
[14:29] let's listen to the quote
[14:31] coming to give these common herdsmen the
[14:34] greatest message of all times
[14:37] there have been many great messengers
[14:40] will you think of the noah's day and the
[14:42] prophets and and the great priests and
[14:44] so forth have been in the days gone by
[14:46] the great learning man
[14:48] kings pope tapes monarchs
[14:50] but here he comes in the greatest of all
[14:53] the messages
[14:55] that was the message messiah is here now
[14:59] and to make that known he bypassed all
[15:02] the trains to make it known to humble
[15:05] shepherds
[15:07] i certainly have more studying to do on
[15:09] this subject as to which is the greatest
[15:11] message of all time but i just thought i
[15:13] would show you a few quotes that plainly
[15:15] exposed the error of claiming we have
[15:18] the greatest message of all time which
[15:20] goes against these two quotes from god's
[15:21] prophet brother branham
[15:23] here are five quotes that seem to show
[15:25] brother branham battled the sin of pride
[15:28] or the pride of life more than any other
[15:30] but of course this is just my
[15:31] observation
[15:33] the first one is brother branham said he
[15:34] lost his first wife and daughter for
[15:37] failing to preach to the pentecostals so
[15:39] this was not lust of the eyes lust of
[15:41] the flesh this was pride of life
[15:44] second brother branham had amoebas for
[15:46] months because he took the
[15:47] denominational agenda
[15:49] in south africa rather than god's
[15:51] itinerary through the angel of the lord
[15:54] and again that was not lust of the flesh
[15:56] lust of the eyes that was pride of life
[15:58] thirdly brother bran told the story
[16:00] about the purple haired woman in ohio
[16:03] and he wished his children did not have
[16:04] to see such sin but god showed him
[16:06] jesus's blood veil and then brother
[16:09] branham asked her for forgiveness
[16:11] so again that was not lust of the eyes
[16:13] lust of the flesh that was pride of life
[16:16] a fourth example is brother branham told
[16:18] god
[16:19] you owe me an understanding
[16:21] brother brandon said it was like a black
[16:22] sheep came down and he felt like he
[16:24] couldn't contact god for a little while
[16:26] i'm not sure if it was a couple weeks or
[16:28] something
[16:29] so again that was not lust of the flesh
[16:31] or lust of the eyes
[16:32] and the fifth example is brother i am
[16:34] told about his complex in his sermon
[16:36] standing in the gap where he almost left
[16:38] the field of ministry because he lost
[16:40] the feeling for the people the people he
[16:43] preached to for so long wouldn't respond
[16:44] to his preaching they wouldn't believe
[16:46] the word of god
[16:48] so again not lust of the eyes not lust
[16:49] of the flesh likely pride of life
[16:53] prideful declarations from today's
[16:55] message preachers
[16:58] friends before i read the exact quotes
[17:00] from today's message preachers
[17:02] recall the quote played earlier in which
[17:04] brother ram said to never call one
[17:06] another great
[17:08] i'd like to play another quote wherein
[17:09] brother branham explains how pride can
[17:11] happen in a preacher's life which is the
[17:14] same mistake
[17:15] israel king uzziah made brother iran
[17:18] lists five things that can happen to
[17:20] preachers
[17:21] first they can feel secure
[17:23] second they can build a kingdom or
[17:24] ministry
[17:26] third they can have a lot of influence
[17:28] fourth they can have large attendance
[17:30] and fifth they can have people applaud
[17:32] them
[17:33] let's listen to the quote
[17:35] and is that
[17:36] help this standard he was a great
[17:38] influence as i've said
[17:40] isaiah the prophet and then
[17:43] made that fatal mistake just like many
[17:46] other people done
[17:48] when he got felt secured
[17:51] felt that he just had the whole thing in
[17:53] his hand
[17:54] he got lifted up in his spirit
[17:57] he got lifted up to pride
[18:00] now there's a real example for us all
[18:03] you know that's been the trouble
[18:05] i'm speaking to christians and and
[18:07] ministers and i i want to be honest
[18:10] about these things
[18:12] that's where many ministers even make a
[18:14] mistake
[18:16] we've heard so many times about the
[18:18] ministers the the acts that they do and
[18:22] and the things some of them may be to
[18:25] doing things they should not do i think
[18:27] sometimes they're a good man
[18:30] a wonderful christian
[18:31] that's been used of the lord and then
[18:33] finally they get a little kingdom built
[18:36] around them
[18:37] or a lot of influence many people
[18:39] attending their meetings until they get
[18:41] careless
[18:43] and they entirely lift it up the people
[18:45] applaud them and stand up and
[18:48] uh we shouldn't really do that we
[18:50] remember we're just all there's no big
[18:52] people among us
[18:54] [Applause]
[19:04] [Applause]
[19:06] because we're all connected together to
[19:09] one god
[19:10] and we all come off of one tree
[19:13] and now we find that many times
[19:15] ministers gets the feeling just a little
[19:18] secure
[19:19] and uh they keep leading out the first
[19:21] thing you know they'll
[19:26] the fact that these message preachers
[19:28] who are declaring themselves the
[19:30] greatest of all time
[19:31] ignore these two quotes from brother
[19:33] branham
[19:34] whether on purpose or ignorantly shows
[19:36] they are caught up in a prideful spirit
[19:38] of this laodicean age
[19:40] they are caught up in their own goat
[19:42] debate about who is the greatest message
[19:44] preachers of all time
[19:46] friends that is just like the world the
[19:48] sports world loves to debate who is the
[19:50] goat is it tom brady or joel montana in
[19:53] football
[19:54] is it michael jordan or lebron james and
[19:56] basketball
[19:58] even some of our recent united states
[20:00] presidents have repeatedly said that
[20:02] america is the greatest it has ever been
[20:05] and promised we are only going to get
[20:07] greater
[20:08] it's just sinful pride plain and simple
[20:11] message preachers and all christians who
[20:14] are not preachers should be focusing on
[20:16] serving if they want to be great in
[20:18] god's sight according to jesus
[20:21] and if they were doing that they would
[20:23] be concerned with the poor the sick and
[20:25] the afflicted and they'd be concerned
[20:27] about fasting praying giving secret alms
[20:30] and doing works in secret in order that
[20:32] they would not be seen of men and
[20:34] praised this is according to matthew 23
[20:37] 11 but he that is greatest among you
[20:39] shall be your servant and really all of
[20:41] matthew chapter 6
[20:43] where jesus tells us to pray in secret
[20:45] give alms in secret and fast and secret
[20:49] here are five prideful declarations i
[20:51] have heard from the same group of
[20:53] fivefold message preachers who often
[20:56] preach conventions together i'll read
[20:58] the list of five declarations and then
[21:01] go through each one individually
[21:03] and read the exact quotes from the
[21:04] preachers without naming their names of
[21:06] course
[21:07] the first declaration is that brother
[21:09] branham and their group of preachers and
[21:11] their young people and their mothers are
[21:14] the greatest christians of all time and
[21:16] some of the most powerful preachers on
[21:18] the earth
[21:20] second they made prideful predictions
[21:22] that have not come to pass
[21:25] third they've pridefully declared
[21:26] brother branham cannot be corrected
[21:30] fourth they've pridefully declared they
[21:32] will not answer questions and are not
[21:34] willing to debate
[21:37] and fifth they've pridefully said we
[21:39] don't need scriptures to support brother
[21:41] graham's quotes
[21:44] the first declaration
[21:46] brother branham their group of preachers
[21:48] their young people their mothers are the
[21:49] greatest christians of all time and some
[21:51] of the most powerful preachers on earth
[21:53] the first quotes are from joseph branham
[21:55] which i've already read he said brother
[21:56] branham is the greatest prophet of all
[21:58] time and brother branham gathered the
[22:00] greatest people of all time
[22:03] notice joseph never said except for
[22:05] jesus brother branham is the greatest of
[22:06] all time
[22:07] and joseph never used any scripture
[22:10] nor a quote from his father whose tapes
[22:12] he exalts to be equal with scripture
[22:15] saying everything on the tape is thus
[22:16] saith the lord this is idolatry or tape
[22:19] worship so without scripture or quotes
[22:21] joseph's statement is a prideful opinion
[22:24] recall friends brother brahm said don't
[22:26] never do that there's no great ones
[22:28] among us there's only one great one and
[22:30] that's god
[22:32] it's wrong to declare who is the
[22:34] greatest or who will sit on the right
[22:36] and left hand of jesus as we'll look at
[22:38] later
[22:39] at the current time it seems two of the
[22:41] greatest christians are two of the 24
[22:44] elders in heaven right now that are
[22:46] sitting on the right and left hand of
[22:47] jesus
[22:48] in the seventh dimension
[22:50] as revelation chapter 4 and 5 details
[22:53] but it could change perhaps we don't
[22:54] know since the bible does not say
[22:57] who's gonna sit by jesus in the
[22:58] millennium or the future home
[23:00] and friends even jesus did not know who
[23:02] would sit on his right and left hand
[23:04] when he was on the earth
[23:05] so it's similar to the unknown day and
[23:07] hour of the rapture it's information
[23:09] jesus's human side does not know
[23:12] and notice that joseph branham is
[23:14] basically saying he knows more than
[23:16] jesus
[23:18] jesus didn't know who was the greatest
[23:19] of all time but now joseph branham says
[23:21] he does know who's the greatest of all
[23:23] time his father
[23:24] if jesus told that to joseph branham why
[23:26] doesn't he tell us that with a thus
[23:28] saith the lord's statement if there's no
[23:30] thus saith the lord and no scripture
[23:32] then it's just his human opinion
[23:34] the next statement by a preacher is by
[23:37] preacher a i'll call him
[23:39] quote i'm not ashamed to say this
[23:42] it or the message has produced the
[23:44] greatest preachers that have ever stood
[23:46] in a pulpit and preached the word it has
[23:48] produced the greatest mothers it has
[23:50] produced come on church this message is
[23:53] jesus christ end quote
[23:57] notice like joseph branham he did not
[23:59] say except for jesus
[24:01] instead he seemed to make this message
[24:03] generation equal to jesus christ but we
[24:06] are not
[24:07] there is no comparison between us and
[24:09] the lovely lord jesus
[24:11] jesus is all holy
[24:13] we like brother branham are sinners
[24:14] saved by grace
[24:16] preacher a said the message is jesus
[24:18] christ but brother branham said i am not
[24:20] jesus christ let's listen to the quote
[24:23] i remember i am not jesus christ i am
[24:26] your brother a sinner saved by grace
[24:30] i'm like you are
[24:33] also preacher a contradicts brother
[24:35] branham in the church age book when he
[24:37] says the philadelphian age had the
[24:39] greatest preachers outside of jesus of
[24:41] course
[24:42] let's listen to the quote
[24:44] the preaching of the word was never
[24:46] greater
[24:47] as satan raised up his hordes of free
[24:49] thinkers as the originators of communism
[24:51] rose up as liberal theologians spread
[24:54] their filthy wares
[24:55] god raised up mighty warriors of faith
[24:58] and the greatest works of christian
[24:59] literature and teaching and preaching
[25:01] came from this era
[25:03] never has its preachers and teachers
[25:05] been matched and never will they be
[25:08] the spurgeons parkers mclarens the
[25:11] edwards onions mueller's brainerds barns
[25:14] bishops all came from this era
[25:16] they preached taught and wrote the word
[25:20] they glorified his name
[25:23] i've also heard preachers from this
[25:25] group
[25:26] say you can't correct a prophet and you
[25:28] must only say what the tapes say
[25:31] if that is the case they're breaking
[25:33] their own rules because they are
[25:34] correcting the philadelphia church age
[25:36] book quote and refusing to say what
[25:38] brother branham said about the preachers
[25:41] from the philadelphian church age
[25:43] preacher a also said the mothers were
[25:45] the greatest
[25:46] what about brother graham's quotes
[25:48] regarding susannah wesley
[25:50] which mother today in the message prays
[25:52] more than her each day with more
[25:54] children than her
[25:55] remember the greatest are the servants
[25:57] so which mother is a greater servant
[25:59] than susannah wesley
[26:01] and of course i'm not exalting susannah
[26:03] wesley as the greatest woman of all time
[26:05] but she just came to my mind when i
[26:07] thought about women that brother branham
[26:08] complemented very highly for their works
[26:11] of service
[26:12] and how does preacher a's declaration
[26:14] that today's preachers are the greatest
[26:16] preachers that have ever stood in a
[26:18] pulpit fit with first corinthians
[26:20] chapter 3 verses 3-9
[26:23] paul said all preachers are one in the
[26:25] fact they are neither anything they're
[26:28] just tools in the hand of god they're
[26:30] not the great ones only god can give the
[26:32] increase
[26:33] paul magnifies god in these scriptures
[26:35] because he says but god that giveth the
[26:37] increase
[26:39] next preacher b said quote
[26:42] i said god you raised a boy up to be one
[26:45] of the greatest men to ever preach in
[26:47] the whole world end quote
[26:50] again brother branham said don't never
[26:51] do that
[26:52] and how can preacher be correct brother
[26:55] branham
[26:56] saying a living preacher today was one
[26:58] of the greatest men to ever preach in
[27:00] the whole world when again brother
[27:01] branham said in the church age book the
[27:03] philadelphian age had the greatest
[27:05] preachers
[27:06] and notice preacher b did not say except
[27:09] for the preachers of the philadelphian
[27:11] church age like brother branham taught
[27:13] other preachers in this group of
[27:14] preachers say you cannot correct the
[27:16] prophet
[27:17] and you won't correct the prophet when
[27:19] you have the baptism of the holy ghost
[27:21] so do these preachers have the baptism
[27:23] of the holy ghost because they are
[27:24] correcting brother iran's quote about
[27:26] the philadelphian church age preachers
[27:29] next preacher c said quote they demons
[27:33] are coming against the greatest
[27:34] generation of young people that have
[27:36] ever been on the face of the earth our
[27:38] credential is we have met the lord jesus
[27:40] christ ourself end quote
[27:43] friend how can the laodicean young
[27:45] people be the greatest young people of
[27:47] all time
[27:48] where is the scripture for that what
[27:50] about the young people that were on the
[27:52] earth when jesus was on the earth
[27:54] like stephen stephen was killed and
[27:56] martyred
[27:57] around the age of 29.
[27:59] james and john left their father for
[28:01] full-time ministry with no air
[28:03] conditioning or plane flights like
[28:05] today's young people have
[28:07] which young people today have left their
[28:09] father's business in order to preach the
[28:12] gospel
[28:13] and travel the difficult way by boat or
[28:15] walking only
[28:17] and friends didn't james john stephen
[28:19] and moore have the credentials that they
[28:21] met jesus christ to even face to face
[28:24] which young people today have not done
[28:27] weren't their credentials more than
[28:29] today's young people
[28:30] when eventually they gave their lives as
[28:32] martyrs for jesus christ
[28:34] again recall brother brahm said don't
[28:36] never do that in other words don't call
[28:37] the young people the greatest of all
[28:39] time
[28:40] again preacher c said in another message
[28:42] quote whenever the lord brought me to
[28:44] himself and his grace and then allowed
[28:47] me to stand with what i consider to be
[28:48] some of the greatest men alive today end
[28:51] quote
[28:53] now friends why isn't preacher c saying
[28:55] what the tapes say don't never do that
[28:57] there's no great ones among us
[29:00] next preacher d
[29:02] who i'm going to be quoting a number of
[29:04] times
[29:05] said speaking of a living canadian
[29:07] preacher quote he's a seasoned minister
[29:10] one of the greatest that's ever preached
[29:12] that has went around the world over and
[29:14] over and over again preaching that this
[29:16] message has fulfilled malachi 4 5 and 6
[29:19] end quote
[29:20] again recall brother ram said don't
[29:22] never do that there's no great ones
[29:24] among us next preacher d said again
[29:28] quote preacher i don't like this kind of
[29:30] preaching hang around i'm only getting
[29:32] greater end quote
[29:35] my friends it's true we go from glory to
[29:37] glory and faith to faith
[29:39] but that's not something we should
[29:40] publicly declare
[29:42] so we've seen preacher d call other
[29:44] people some of the greatest of all time
[29:46] and then publicly declare that he's only
[29:48] getting greater
[29:50] in the next quote preacher d
[29:52] was invited to come preach and pray for
[29:55] a sick person and he self-proclaims
[29:58] himself as a general in the army of the
[30:00] lord and then exalts the people as the
[30:02] most powerful people in the earth
[30:05] greater than the angels in heaven people
[30:07] with checkbook authority quote
[30:10] when a certain woman
[30:12] gets in trouble you got to have some
[30:14] generals come in i stand before the most
[30:16] powerful people in the earth greater
[30:18] than the angels that are in heaven
[30:20] people with checkbook authority end
[30:22] quote
[30:23] notice friends i see these preachers
[30:24] always leaving out
[30:26] the requirement to find the will of god
[30:28] first before we pray for sick people as
[30:31] brother and i'm taught in numerous
[30:32] places but one clear example is works is
[30:35] faith express 1965. let's listen to the
[30:38] quote
[30:42] that saved your soul can he heal your
[30:45] [Applause]
[30:47] [Music]
[30:47] [Applause]
[30:49] it's body the same revealed you he's
[30:51] your healer as you as your savior
[30:53] but it's got to be revealed first
[30:56] that's the difference
[30:58] you've got to first find the will of god
[31:01] now you've got to find the will of god
[31:03] this morning as you're coming to be
[31:04] prayed for you've got to find the will
[31:06] of god whether it's god's will to heal
[31:08] you or not
[31:11] also preacher d called this woman he was
[31:13] called to pray for the queen of the
[31:15] state she lived in
[31:17] now how did preacher deed know she was
[31:19] the spiritual queen of that state what
[31:21] authority did he have to exalt that
[31:23] woman above all the other women in that
[31:25] state so that seems to be a prideful
[31:27] exaltation of one specific woman in the
[31:30] church in another quote from preacher d
[31:34] quote god sent you some of the most
[31:36] powerful men on earth to preach to you
[31:39] end quote
[31:40] now preacher dee expressed this but how
[31:42] does that line up with those who plant
[31:44] in water being nothing as paul said in
[31:47] first corinthians chapter three
[31:49] so this statement contradicts saint
[31:51] paul's writings in his epistles
[31:54] also preacher dee's focus on power
[31:56] contradicts the following quotes from
[31:58] brother branham where he says we can't
[32:00] judge our life by how much power we have
[32:02] to perform miracles
[32:04] and brother brahm says american people
[32:06] always fall for it when preachers say
[32:08] i've got power in my hands glory
[32:09] hallelujah
[32:11] he said don't you never let anybody tell
[32:13] you they got power to heal they haven't
[32:15] and also brother ram said i have no
[32:17] power to heal and he says none of us
[32:19] does we have authority let's listen to
[32:22] the
[32:27] you have to quotes miracles
[32:29] and we don't judge yourself for how much
[32:32] knowledge you have of the world
[32:35] but always judge yourself look back and
[32:38] take an inventory of what kind of a
[32:40] fruit that the life you presently live
[32:42] now is dead
[32:45] i said there's many people in the
[32:46] country they call themselves divine
[32:47] healers said i got power in my hands
[32:50] [Music]
[32:52] american people fall for it like i don't
[32:53] know what my heart takes
[32:55] and they and they they think that's
[32:56] right they're getting healed closer
[32:59] your faith is in the finished work of
[33:00] jesus christ that's what healing ladies
[33:03] but you never let anybody tell you
[33:04] they've got power to heal
[33:06] [Applause]
[33:07] now when jesus christ heals the sick now
[33:10] i don't say they'll be healed i can tell
[33:12] you that
[33:13] remember i have no power to heal i don't
[33:16] have power
[33:18] you don't have any power none of us does
[33:20] we have authority how many understand
[33:22] that
[33:25] so let's pray for our brothers to be
[33:26] more humble not to talk about how much
[33:28] power they have but to spend their time
[33:30] taking inventory of what kind of fruit
[33:32] they're presently bearing
[33:35] again preacher d said quote i'll stand
[33:37] with generals on that day end quote
[33:40] speaking of either in heaven or the
[33:43] future home again recall brother branham
[33:45] said don't never do that there's no
[33:46] great ones among us
[33:48] now i did find one quote where brother
[33:50] branham alluded to ministers as captains
[33:52] but i rarely if ever hear brother random
[33:54] calling himself the captain
[33:56] or the greatest of all time
[33:58] let's listen to the quote
[34:00] and the chief commanding general of
[34:02] course is jesus christ in the church
[34:04] his ministers are his uh captains of the
[34:08] companies that that's representing him
[34:10] here on earth
[34:13] i also want to show how brother branham
[34:14] was so humble brother ram said he could
[34:17] not even prove his name was there
[34:19] on the lamb's book of life and he said
[34:21] god could use me as a tool for something
[34:23] let's listen to the quote
[34:25] now we don't know
[34:26] you say brother bran
[34:28] can you prove that you're there no sir
[34:31] i cannot prove it
[34:33] god could use me for a tool of something
[34:35] else and use you the same way
[34:37] but i believe and by faith i am saved
[34:41] not but knowledge i'm saved by faith
[34:43] that's why you're safe that's where
[34:45] we're all safe
[34:48] in the next quote brother ram said
[34:50] lovers of self speak of how great they
[34:52] are
[34:52] so notice how close this is to someone
[34:54] saying i'm a general or i'm one of the
[34:56] greatest of all time or i am the
[34:58] greatest of all time let's listen to the
[35:00] quote and the bible says
[35:21] again preacher d said this recently in
[35:23] may of 2022 quote tomorrow morning
[35:26] you're going to have one of the greatest
[35:28] preachers that ever lived in history
[35:30] preached to you i know i'm on sacred
[35:32] ground i've got thick skin i can handle
[35:35] it end quote
[35:36] again remember brother brahma said don't
[35:38] never do that the shocking part about
[35:40] this quote is that the next day the
[35:42] preacher that preacher dee was talking
[35:44] about called him a politician
[35:47] making some in the congregation laugh
[35:50] showing friends their lack of
[35:51] discernment for exalting others as great
[35:54] ones even though brother branham said
[35:56] never do that and again i have video
[35:58] proof of all these statements
[36:01] next i have two other message preachers
[36:03] i'm just going to call them grandfathers
[36:05] who said that their musicians were the
[36:07] greatest musicians in the message
[36:10] i don't have quotes for these i heard
[36:12] one online i could go find it but i
[36:14] don't have it right now and the other
[36:15] one i heard while attending a meeting a
[36:17] number of years ago
[36:19] but again friends what is it in a
[36:20] grandfather a more mature preacher that
[36:23] would want to exalt his musicians as
[36:25] greater than everybody else remember the
[36:27] greatest among us are the servants
[36:30] now we're on to the second declaration
[36:32] prideful predictions
[36:34] in march of this year preacher d said
[36:37] quote in a few days you'll have a head
[36:39] full i don't believe that you stay
[36:42] around and the rapture happens you look
[36:44] over at brother and i remember the
[36:46] service preacher d said you'd have a
[36:48] hair full
[36:49] end quote
[36:50] so to summarize this preacher d was
[36:53] saying the rapture is going to happen in
[36:55] a few days
[36:56] and friends it's been over a hundred
[36:57] days since this bold prediction
[37:00] and the rapture has not happened yet
[37:02] where is the countability for such a
[37:04] statement as this
[37:05] notice again preacher d likely anointed
[37:08] with the spirit of pride predicting the
[37:10] rapture in a few hours and it doesn't
[37:12] happen
[37:13] where is the humility where's the
[37:14] repentance where's the public apology
[37:18] two weeks later preacher d said quote
[37:21] we're just hours before the rapture and
[37:23] we're believing we're getting ready to
[37:24] step over end quote friends it's been
[37:27] almost three thousand hours since this
[37:29] prediction
[37:31] when is preacher d going to be held
[37:32] accountable
[37:34] a third example is again preacher d
[37:36] presuming a healing would happen quote
[37:40] when god heals sister blank it will not
[37:43] diminish his healing power one little
[37:45] iota end quote
[37:47] friends preacher d announced a woman was
[37:49] going to be healed and then the woman
[37:51] died just a few days later
[37:53] after the preacher declared god would
[37:55] heal her
[37:56] friends was there any public repentance
[37:58] for this prediction
[38:00] the third declaration is pridefully
[38:02] declaring brother branham cannot be
[38:04] corrected
[38:05] and again this has to be the sin of the
[38:06] pride of life because it's not lust of
[38:08] the eyes or less of the flesh
[38:10] a new preacher preacher e said quote
[38:13] baptism of the holy ghost and when that
[38:15] revelation is caught then it stops the
[38:17] questioning of the prophet's words
[38:20] nobody sets before a prophet to correct
[38:22] him that's rapture condition god has not
[38:25] entrusted any man to correct a prophet
[38:27] of god end quote
[38:29] friends this quote basically makes
[38:31] brother branham infallible and brother
[38:33] branham said prophets are not infallible
[38:35] people let's listen to the quotes
[38:46] also i have over 50 statements that
[38:48] prove
[38:49] not everything brother branham said was
[38:51] thus saith the lord
[38:52] it's likely that this preacher who says
[38:54] you can't correct brother branham does
[38:56] correct brother branham by choosing one
[38:58] side of a quote when brother branham has
[39:01] quotes on both sides of a subject such
[39:03] as the white horse rider i just wonder
[39:05] would this preacher or any preacher take
[39:07] the quotes before the seven seals where
[39:09] brother branham said the white horse
[39:11] rider was the holy spirit or do they
[39:13] take the quote during the seven seals
[39:15] where brother branham said the white
[39:16] horse rider is the antichrist
[39:18] notice friends preacher e is basically
[39:20] saying i and everyone like me have the
[39:23] baptism of the holy ghost because we do
[39:24] not question any of brother brahms words
[39:26] and of course the brother's wrong
[39:29] and just a few simple examples prove
[39:30] that brother brahm said martin luther
[39:32] king jr would lead millions to a death
[39:34] trap and he never did that
[39:36] brother branham said total annihilation
[39:38] would happen to the united states by or
[39:40] before 1977 that did not happen
[39:43] brother branham said arizona could not
[39:45] have another another generation because
[39:47] of the high birth rates of children with
[39:50] mental retardation
[39:51] brother branham had a slip of the tongue
[39:53] and said rebecca married her bride a
[39:56] woman
[39:57] and brother branham said the rapture is
[39:58] in second thessalonians chapter four
[40:00] which doesn't exist it's first
[40:02] thessalonians chapter four
[40:04] the fourth statement is pridefully not
[40:06] answering questions about the message
[40:09] and being unwilling to debate
[40:12] preacher e said to me i don't have any
[40:14] time if someone wants to raise a
[40:16] question about this message i don't have
[40:18] any time for you
[40:19] and for a person that wants to even try
[40:21] to straighten things out
[40:23] well god has never called me or any
[40:25] other minister to qualify this message
[40:26] in the scripture god's already
[40:28] vindicated it end quote
[40:31] friends this is opposite of what brother
[40:32] branham said brother branham said i
[40:34] always have time to be corrected let's
[40:36] listen to the quote a baptist minister a
[40:39] few weeks ago
[40:40] come up and to my house and said i like
[40:43] straightening out on the god head
[40:44] sometime when he got the time called me
[40:46] up brother i said i got time right now
[40:49] because i want to be straight
[40:51] and we lay aside everything else to do
[40:53] it
[40:55] also recall first peter 3 verse 15 peter
[40:58] commands us through the holy spirit that
[41:00] we ought to always have an answer for
[41:02] the hope that we have within us
[41:04] also remember birth pains 1965. brother
[41:07] random hoped there would be men that
[41:09] could make more sense of the message and
[41:11] bring it to life
[41:12] i thought we're supposed to say what the
[41:14] tapes say why aren't we saying what
[41:16] birth pain
[41:18] up this it goes says with it they can
[41:20] make more sense to it see to bring it to
[41:22] a place you i just want to lay this seat
[41:25] but i hope they make it come to life
[41:27] notice
[41:29] friends the baptism of the holy ghost
[41:31] inside a god called preacher qualifies
[41:34] him to rightly divide the word of truth
[41:36] on all subjects because the tapes of
[41:38] brother branham are not infallible as
[41:40] brother brown told us he said there's
[41:42] mix up on the tapes
[41:43] any honest person will admit that to
[41:46] deny this birth pains quote is to not
[41:48] say what the tapes say
[41:50] friends saint paul debated often about
[41:52] jesus christ so did the minister apollos
[41:55] and you'll find that in acts 17 and acts
[41:57] 18.
[41:58] so if holy ghost-filled men before
[42:00] debated and they were baptized with the
[42:02] holy ghost and jesus christ is the same
[42:05] yesterday today and forever then holy
[42:07] ghost-filled men today will be led by
[42:08] the holy spirit to hold debates at times
[42:11] and here's some quotes from brother
[42:12] branham where he talked about debates he
[42:14] had been a part of let's listen to the
[42:16] quotes
[42:17] when i first with him
[42:20] in this debate that brother leo was
[42:23] anxious to get on tape here i suppose i
[42:25] said
[42:26] i guess he's got it running now
[42:30] i would not
[42:31] want you by leo to use this to hurt or
[42:34] anything but yes i know you wouldn't and
[42:36] i wouldn't say you better
[42:38] if a man
[42:40] speaks with tongues all right
[42:42] he doesn't speak with tongues that still
[42:44] is no sign he hasn't got it
[42:47] as i've often said
[42:49] i hit a little spot last night in the
[42:51] church that i didn't know i was saying
[42:53] it
[42:54] but how this satan is not a a healer
[42:58] and the lutheran college where all those
[43:00] were converted recently when i the man
[43:02] debated with me on the subject
[43:04] said satan could heal and when you hear
[43:07] anyone say think and heal he's wrong
[43:11] and that night while we were laying
[43:13] there
[43:14] brother lee had a dream
[43:17] and it always debated with me
[43:20] about the water baptism in the name of
[43:22] the lord jesus christ
[43:26] also going back to preacher c he was
[43:28] against debate and said
[43:30] why spending time with serpent seed i
[43:32] ain't got time to debate end quote
[43:35] so again this preacher denies
[43:37] the first church age messenger paul who
[43:39] debated often about jesus christ
[43:42] along with the seventh church age
[43:43] messenger brother branham who debated
[43:45] about jesus christ divine healing the
[43:47] godhead and other topics
[43:49] like speaking in tongues
[43:51] so preachers not wanting to debate or
[43:53] answer questions
[43:54] seems to go along with their prideful
[43:56] lifestyles of lavish living flying first
[43:59] class taking no questions offering no
[44:02] counseling surrounding themselves with
[44:04] yes men
[44:05] rarely correcting each other and
[44:07] receiving hundreds of thousands if not
[44:09] millions of dollars in ties
[44:12] the fifth and final statement is saying
[44:14] you don't need a scripture to support
[44:17] brother branham's quotes
[44:19] preacher c said quote bless god i
[44:22] believe brother branham whenever he's
[44:23] got a scripture for every quote
[44:26] and where did you get that in the bible
[44:28] it's sad to say it but some of our
[44:30] message preachers are preaching that
[44:31] tommy rot
[44:33] i don't think they ought to be in the
[44:34] pulpit it's evident they don't know what
[44:37] a prophet is end quote
[44:40] it's sad but this preacher see has
[44:42] decades of preaching experience
[44:45] and yet he says the bible doesn't say
[44:47] you need a scripture for every quote
[44:50] friends our brothers greatly deceived
[44:52] the bible plainly says prove all things
[44:54] in first thessalonians chapter 5.
[44:57] let's listen to quotes where brother
[44:58] branham says we must prove all things by
[45:00] the bible and also every doctrine must
[45:03] be based upon this new testament the new
[45:05] testament church and every doctrine must
[45:07] be based upon the word of god
[45:09] not just one place but from genesis to
[45:11] revelation let's listen to the quotes
[45:14] now we must prove all things by the
[45:18] scripture
[45:21] so heavens and earth as the way god's
[45:23] word will never pass away
[45:26] every doctrine and everything else of
[45:28] the bible that we have in the church
[45:31] must be based upon the word of god
[45:35] must come from the word
[45:37] not just one place
[45:39] but from genesis to revelation have to
[45:43] say the same thing
[45:45] as we cannot base our thoughts upon one
[45:49] little scripture
[45:51] while the bible said in the mouth of two
[45:54] three witnesses let every word be
[45:55] established
[45:58] and strictly as fundamental
[46:00] if anything doesn't come from this bible
[46:03] it isn't true i believe that this is
[46:06] god's truth and everything every
[46:09] doctrine must be based upon
[46:12] this new testament
[46:13] the new testament church
[46:17] the true goat the lord jesus christ
[46:21] friends the acronym goat stands for the
[46:24] greatest of all time today's message
[46:26] preachers are saying they
[46:28] and their congregations are the greatest
[46:30] of all time
[46:32] but they're sadly mistaken
[46:34] in philippians 2 verses 3 through 11
[46:37] the scripture says jesus humbled himself
[46:40] wherefore god hath highly exalted him
[46:42] and given him a name which is above
[46:44] every name
[46:45] so we know the lord jesus christ is the
[46:47] greatest of all time
[46:49] and none of us have any business calling
[46:51] ourselves the greatest of all time
[46:54] here's a quote from the second seal
[46:56] where brother branham speaks about
[46:57] philippians chapter two
[46:59] brother abraham says
[47:01] first it was humility in the lord jesus
[47:03] and then he become great
[47:05] brother ram says let god exalt you
[47:07] he that humbles himself god will exalt
[47:10] let's listen to the quote
[47:12] that's what the world thought of me
[47:16] didn't have a place to lay his head
[47:19] kicked out by every organization
[47:22] but when god
[47:28] [Applause]
[47:37] heaven is named after you
[47:39] and every family they're there all the
[47:42] family on earth is named jesus
[47:45] all the families in heaven named jesus
[47:47] amen and such
[47:50] [Applause]
[47:55] [Applause]
[48:03] see but first it was humility
[48:06] then it become great
[48:08] let god exalt he that humbles himself
[48:11] god will exalt
[48:14] in the next quote from trying to do god
[48:16] a service
[48:17] brother ram says how god come down from
[48:19] ivory palaces of glory to become one of
[48:21] us now who is the great one
[48:24] he washed the very clay that he created
[48:26] now who is great let's listen to the
[48:28] quote
[48:30] notice
[48:31] god
[48:33] himself come from the ivory palaces of
[48:35] glory to become one of us
[48:37] now who's the big one
[48:39] not come down here take the form of a
[48:41] priest but a servant
[48:44] wash the very clay that he created the
[48:47] feet of his apostles
[48:50] now who's great
[48:53] while i was preaching this series about
[48:55] overcoming the sin of pride
[48:56] the thought came to me that jesus was
[48:59] typified by two goats on the day of
[49:01] atonement
[49:02] this is found in leviticus chapter 16
[49:05] verses 1-34
[49:07] both goats typified the lord jesus
[49:09] christ one goat was slain to be
[49:11] sacrificed and the other goat had all
[49:14] the sins put upon it and it was sent out
[49:16] in the wilderness to die alone
[49:19] these two goats showed israel how god
[49:21] would deal with their sin
[49:23] god would put their wretched sins on an
[49:25] innocent sacrifice
[49:27] the two goats
[49:28] and this is what god did to our lord
[49:30] jesus christ the son of god
[49:32] god put all of our sins upon jesus
[49:35] he died for our sins and also he carried
[49:38] our sins far away as a song lyrics tell
[49:40] us
[49:41] living he loved us dying he saved us
[49:43] buried he carried our sins far away
[49:46] rising he justified freely forever one
[49:48] day he's coming o glorious day
[49:51] so we again see how the true goat the
[49:53] true greatest of all time is the lord
[49:55] jesus christ and friends god will not
[49:58] share his glory with anyone else
[50:00] let's listen to two quotes one from 1959
[50:03] living dying buried rising coming where
[50:05] brother ram says these two goats type
[50:07] the lord jesus christ
[50:08] and also one from questions and answers
[50:10] part 1 1964
[50:12] where brother brahm says the same thing
[50:14] let's listen to the quotes
[50:16] the old testament
[50:18] at the sin offering
[50:19] when they got two goats
[50:23] and these goats and jesus represented
[50:25] both of them or they represented him
[50:28] rather
[50:30] and one goat was killed
[50:34] and the other was the sins of the nation
[50:37] was placed upon this goat called the
[50:41] scapegoat
[50:43] and that
[50:44] goat had to
[50:46] go out into the wilderness
[50:49] to die
[50:52] and to be
[50:54] out there alone amongst the beasts and
[50:56] so forth
[50:58] jesus
[50:59] had to be that
[51:01] that goat
[51:03] i want you to notice he was a lamb he
[51:06] was sheep
[51:09] but he was made goat for you now
[51:12] that we being goat might become sheep
[51:17] we being sinners
[51:20] guilty of death
[51:22] subject to death and all sold out under
[51:25] condemnation yet christ become me that i
[51:29] through his grace might become him a son
[51:32] of god seated at the
[51:35] right hand of god
[51:37] and glory
[51:40] the love that he had how he expressed it
[51:43] how he had to make himself what he was
[51:45] to die to save us
[51:48] no more than dr smith on a seven-day
[51:51] adventist on the sacrifice goat he said
[51:53] one goat that was killed two goats into
[51:56] the day of the sacrifice a day of
[51:58] atonement and one goat was killed and
[52:01] the other and turned loose and then he
[52:03] said the goat that was killed
[52:05] represented jesus
[52:07] our sin barrier that died but the goat
[52:10] that was turned loose represented
[52:13] the devil that bears our sins and goes
[52:15] away into eternity with it now
[52:18] you see any to my opinion uh if this
[52:21] ever gets back to an adventist brother
[52:23] i'm not saying anything about that great
[52:25] man dr smith
[52:26] oh he was a smart intelligent fine
[52:29] cultured christian
[52:31] a believer
[52:33] but to me you see it doesn't make sense
[52:35] when you do that you're sacrificing to
[52:37] the devil land
[52:39] they both represented christ death
[52:41] burial and resurrection he also died for
[52:44] our sins and carrying our sins far away
[52:47] both of them was christ
[52:50] so friends it's without question jesus
[52:52] christ is the greatest person of all
[52:54] time
[52:55] and it is an absolute shame that
[52:57] preachers are calling themselves and
[52:59] their congregations the greatest of all
[53:01] time basically making themselves equal
[53:04] to the lord jesus christ
[53:05] [Music]
[53:07] besides jesus among sinners saved by
[53:09] grace who might be the greatest
[53:11] christian servants
[53:13] with the greatest rewards
[53:16] when you look at scriptures about the
[53:17] greatest believers of all time
[53:19] you might start at matthew 11 verse 11
[53:22] where jesus says
[53:23] among
[53:24] them that are born of women there has
[53:26] not risen a greater than john the
[53:27] baptist notwithstanding he that is least
[53:30] in the kingdom of heaven is greater than
[53:31] he
[53:32] so it's clear john the baptist was the
[53:34] greatest old testament believer of all
[53:36] time and brother brahm said this was
[53:37] because he introduced jesus christ to
[53:39] the world let's listen to the quote
[53:42] jesus said yes he is
[53:44] so he never was a man born of a woman as
[53:46] great as that man there that's right the
[53:48] hobbit believes the kingdom of heaven is
[53:50] greater than john but if you've never
[53:51] been a man born every woman is greater
[53:53] than you why are all the other problems
[53:54] spoke of but john introduced into the
[53:57] world this is behold the lamb of god
[54:00] introduced into the world he's the
[54:01] greatest among the prophets
[54:06] also theologian adam clarke from the
[54:08] philadelphian church age added two other
[54:10] points quite powerfully in my opinion
[54:13] another reason he may have been the
[54:15] greatest was because
[54:16] john was prophesied of by other prophets
[54:19] like isaiah and malachi in isaiah 40
[54:22] verse 3 and malachi 3 verse 1
[54:25] and he continued and said where jesus
[54:27] christ himself seems to be the speaker
[54:31] so john was so great because jesus
[54:32] christ was speaking through isaiah and
[54:34] malachi about john
[54:37] clark said because he had the privilege
[54:39] of showing the fulfillment of their
[54:40] predictions by pointing out that christ
[54:43] has now come which they foretold should
[54:45] come
[54:46] and third because he saw and enjoyed
[54:48] that salvation which they could only
[54:50] foretell
[54:52] humbly i might add another reason
[54:55] john the baptist lived an impeccable
[54:57] life of holiness consecration and
[55:00] integrity
[55:01] there were godly men used mightily by
[55:03] god in the old testament but their
[55:05] testimonies were scarred by murder like
[55:07] with moses and david
[55:09] a few of the most godly lives seem to be
[55:11] enoch joseph and joshua but yet jesus
[55:14] christ exalts john the baptist above
[55:16] them john the baptist lived in the
[55:18] wilderness in total consecration and
[55:20] fellowship with god under a nazarite vow
[55:23] awaiting his six months of ministry that
[55:26] would prepare the way for christ
[55:28] he would exalt every valley and lower
[55:30] every mountain straighten every crooked
[55:32] path and make playing the rough places
[55:35] according to isaiah 40 verses 3 and 4.
[55:38] this might be an appropriate place to
[55:40] show that brother random also said moses
[55:42] was the greatest prophet of all time
[55:44] which is different from what he said in
[55:46] other places
[55:47] and then he said john the baptist was
[55:49] the greatest prophet of all time
[55:51] and then said that jesus was the
[55:52] greatest of all the prophets
[55:54] so of course these quotes prove brother
[55:56] branham was not infallible
[55:57] but he grew in his understanding of the
[55:59] word of god let's listen to the quotes
[56:02] let's call another man by the name of
[56:04] moses a very outstanding character in
[56:07] the bible the greatest of all the
[56:09] prophets he was the type of the lord
[56:11] jesus christ the priests and the kings
[56:14] and the law givers
[56:17] and when jesus came he was considered
[56:19] the john was the greatest of all the
[56:21] prophets because the rest of them spoke
[56:24] of jesus but john said behold the lamb
[56:26] of god to take away the sin of the world
[56:30] and
[56:31] god promised the same thing and the
[56:33] greatest of all the prophets and all the
[56:36] king and lord and master of them but
[56:38] jesus
[56:41] now it's likely but i'm not sure that
[56:43] some message preachers will say this
[56:45] since the elijah forerunner of christ at
[56:47] the close of the old testament was the
[56:49] greatest then the elijah forerunner and
[56:51] restorer of the new testament would be
[56:54] the greatest
[56:55] that's certainly a possibility but again
[56:58] jesus never specifically said the elijah
[57:00] restore of the new testament would be
[57:02] the greatest new testament christian of
[57:04] all time nor did brother branham say it
[57:06] with us saith the lord or even as his
[57:08] opinion
[57:09] we have no bible evidence for this claim
[57:12] but we do have brother ram's own written
[57:14] words saying he thought the greatest
[57:16] preaching was done in the man age or the
[57:19] reformation period
[57:21] yet today's preachers will correct
[57:22] brother branham's opinion about the man
[57:24] age
[57:25] yet while claiming no one should correct
[57:26] brother branham
[57:28] consider also the following brother
[57:30] branham will be judged by paul's gospel
[57:32] and not the other way around
[57:35] paul will not be judged by brother
[57:36] branham's gospel this is according to
[57:38] romans 2 verse 16 in that day when god
[57:41] shall judge the secrets of men by jesus
[57:43] christ according to my gospel
[57:46] brother branham preached what paul
[57:48] preached in other words brother adam
[57:50] could not add to what jesus had already
[57:52] given paul brother branham said he could
[57:54] not add or take away one word from what
[57:56] paul preached and taught this leads me
[57:58] to think paul might be the greatest
[58:00] christian servant of all time
[58:02] but again i'm only guessing since jesus
[58:04] did not tell us who would be the
[58:06] greatest new testament believer and only
[58:08] the father knew who would sit on his
[58:10] right and left hands
[58:12] i think it's normal to meditate on which
[58:14] believer would be the greatest in the
[58:16] father's eyes in the new testament after
[58:19] reading matthew 11 16
[58:21] but i think it's wrong to emphatically
[58:23] declare its brother branham and us
[58:26] current message believers with no
[58:28] biblical support
[58:30] speaking of our lord jesus he dealt with
[58:32] the goat debate during his earthly
[58:33] ministry when his disciples argued about
[58:36] who was the greatest
[58:37] as seen in mark 9 verses 33-37
[58:41] jesus had a child placed among his
[58:42] arguing disciples and urged them to
[58:45] become humble like a child which they
[58:47] would be in the 10 days leading up to
[58:49] the day of pentecost for that was the
[58:51] moment in acts chapter 2 when they were
[58:53] born again into the kingdom of god and
[58:55] had childlike faith
[58:57] note also that jesus says the greatest
[59:00] is the servant of all
[59:01] and other words from jesus show the
[59:03] greatest reward which is a hundred fold
[59:05] reward is for the missionary who leaves
[59:08] family wife etc to preach the gospel as
[59:11] jesus taught in matthew 19 verses 27
[59:14] through 30.
[59:15] it's also important to recognize that
[59:17] jesus disciples were arguing the goat
[59:19] debate before they were born again and
[59:22] we never saw them discussing this issue
[59:24] after they were born again in the book
[59:25] of acts
[59:27] so where does that place the preachers
[59:28] who today do not argue
[59:31] but as i observed online seem to rather
[59:34] take turns exalting one another as the
[59:36] greatest or among the greatest of all
[59:38] time
[59:40] it would seem either they're not born
[59:41] again
[59:42] or they could be born again with awful
[59:44] prideful sinful complexes
[59:47] because the book of acts saints did not
[59:49] discuss how great they were
[59:51] paul did note that he labored more than
[59:53] all the apostles but he did it to assure
[59:56] the corinthians that he was indeed one
[59:58] of the firsthand witnesses of the
[1:00:00] resurrection of the lord jesus christ
[1:00:02] like the 11 other apostles in 1st
[1:00:04] corinthians 15 verses 1 through 10.
[1:00:08] and he also told the corinthians in
[1:00:09] second corinthians 11 verse 5
[1:00:11] he was not a wit behind the very
[1:00:13] chiefest apostles
[1:00:15] because he was trying to prove that he
[1:00:16] was a genuine apostle and to persuade
[1:00:19] the corinthians not to listen to the
[1:00:21] false apostles
[1:00:23] it's important to see that it's likely
[1:00:25] that the 11 faithful apostles of jesus
[1:00:27] christ
[1:00:28] with the 12th apostle possibly being
[1:00:31] saint paul or matthias who argued about
[1:00:33] being the greatest seem to be elevated
[1:00:36] to the greatest seats of honor up in
[1:00:38] heaven's seventh dimension or the third
[1:00:40] heaven
[1:00:41] during this current church age time
[1:00:43] period as seen in matthew 19 28 and
[1:00:46] revelation 4 verse 4.
[1:00:48] in matthew 19 28 jesus said the apostles
[1:00:51] would sit
[1:00:52] upon 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of
[1:00:55] israel and this may be in the millennium
[1:00:57] or the future home
[1:00:59] in revelation 4 4 we see that
[1:01:02] 24 seats around the throne of god in
[1:01:04] heaven
[1:01:05] 12 of them were for the apostles and 12
[1:01:07] were for the sons of jacob
[1:01:09] another major text is matthew 20 verses
[1:01:12] 21-24
[1:01:13] which shows the mother of james and john
[1:01:15] requesting that her two sons sit on the
[1:01:17] right and left hand of jesus to which
[1:01:19] jesus says it's up to the father who
[1:01:21] would sit closest to him and it was not
[1:01:23] given to jesus to assign the seats with
[1:01:25] the highest honor
[1:01:27] here we learn a great lesson that if
[1:01:29] jesus himself did not know which saints
[1:01:31] were the goats or the ones that deserve
[1:01:33] the highest honor how can message
[1:01:35] preachers today know and publicly
[1:01:38] declare that they are the goats or the
[1:01:40] greatest christians of all time
[1:01:42] i humbly ask do message preachers have
[1:01:44] greater knowledge than jesus himself
[1:01:47] i think the answer is no
[1:01:49] so it seems the greatest sinner saved by
[1:01:51] grace
[1:01:52] the greatest servants are the twelve
[1:01:54] apostles because they will judge the
[1:01:56] twelve tribes of israel
[1:01:58] and they currently already have seats
[1:02:00] around jesus throne in heaven right now
[1:02:02] during the church ages
[1:02:04] and this makes sense because most of
[1:02:06] them were missionaries most of them
[1:02:08] traveled and spent years preaching the
[1:02:10] gospel in other lands
[1:02:12] and 11 out of the 12 gave their lives as
[1:02:15] martyrs
[1:02:16] saint john the divine was the only one
[1:02:18] who did not die as a martyr he just died
[1:02:20] of natural old age and that fits with
[1:02:23] what jesus said jesus told peter that
[1:02:25] because they had left houses families
[1:02:28] and their occupations he would give them
[1:02:29] a hundred fold reward
[1:02:32] i want to notice too that brother
[1:02:33] branham judged the current preachers of
[1:02:35] his day in comparison against the
[1:02:38] apostles
[1:02:40] in this quote from presuming 1962
[1:02:42] brother branham noted how the preachers
[1:02:44] of his day were totally different than
[1:02:46] the apostles because of their attitude
[1:02:48] towards money brother random said
[1:02:50] preachers of his day were concerned
[1:02:52] about being billionaires
[1:02:53] and bragging about how much money they
[1:02:55] had
[1:02:56] he said how different it was from the
[1:02:57] original pentecost
[1:02:59] when they got the holy ghost they sold
[1:03:01] everything and gave to the poor
[1:03:03] so do today's message preachers resemble
[1:03:05] the poor apostles who constantly
[1:03:07] remember the poor
[1:03:09] or do today's message preachers resemble
[1:03:12] the rich preachers of brother branham
[1:03:13] that were bragging about how much they
[1:03:15] had and about how great they were and of
[1:03:18] course this is based upon acts 2 45 acts
[1:03:21] 4 verse 33 through 35 acts 3 verse 6 and
[1:03:25] galatians 2 verses 9 and 10.
[1:03:28] let's listen to the quote
[1:03:30] i see what they're thinking about
[1:03:32] what are you telling them
[1:03:35] they belong to these big former marks
[1:03:38] and they're prosperous or billionaires
[1:03:42] i said how different you are always
[1:03:44] bragging about what you got how much you
[1:03:46] accumulated in this much time i said how
[1:03:48] different it is from the original
[1:03:49] pentecost they sold everything to have
[1:03:52] you to the poor
[1:03:56] i said you vice versa
[1:03:58] that people knows all about what it
[1:04:00] means to be rich they want to find
[1:04:01] something that satisfies it's got some
[1:04:04] life in it
[1:04:08] here's another important quote from the
[1:04:10] laodicean church age 1960 brother
[1:04:12] branham said jesus didn't commend this
[1:04:15] church the laodicean church
[1:04:17] he had a complaint against it not a
[1:04:19] command he didn't commend this for
[1:04:22] nothing this laodicean age
[1:04:24] now to me this quote is very important
[1:04:27] because brother ram said we do not need
[1:04:28] commending by jesus we need rebuked
[1:04:31] so how can message preachers commend
[1:04:33] themselves as the greatest of all time
[1:04:36] and yet jesus did not commend this age
[1:04:38] brother branham said for nothing
[1:04:40] let's listen to the quote
[1:04:42] now
[1:04:43] now the next verse would be to the other
[1:04:46] churches
[1:04:47] come in
[1:04:48] but he didn't command this church
[1:04:51] he had to complain against it not a
[1:04:52] command
[1:05:05] he had a complaint for this church not a
[1:05:08] command
[1:05:11] it's also important to know that jesus
[1:05:13] promised the overcomers of laodicea the
[1:05:15] highest compliment ever paid to a humble
[1:05:17] steadfast group
[1:05:19] in revelation 3 verse 21 as brother am
[1:05:22] taught in the church age book but again
[1:05:24] remember this promise is not just for
[1:05:26] the laodicean saints it's for every
[1:05:28] overcomer of every church age as he that
[1:05:31] overcometh inherits all things let's
[1:05:33] listen to the quote
[1:05:35] yet in verse 21
[1:05:37] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[1:05:39] sit with me in my throne even as i also
[1:05:42] overcame and am set down with my father
[1:05:44] in his throne
[1:05:46] we find the true vine true spirit true
[1:05:49] church people exalted to the very throne
[1:05:51] of god with the highest compliment ever
[1:05:54] paid to a humble steadfast spiritual
[1:05:56] group
[1:05:58] now now ladies
[1:06:00] that's the last church ages could be
[1:06:02] some overcomers in that watch they
[1:06:04] remember each church age that one
[1:06:07] preceding it inherits all that the other
[1:06:09] one is offered
[1:06:11] watch up here
[1:06:13] in this quote from how can i overcome
[1:06:14] 1963 brother ram said laodicea is the
[1:06:17] grandest of all ages because it blends
[1:06:19] into eternity but a few moments before
[1:06:22] that he said it needed a sharp rebuke he
[1:06:24] never said we were the greatest
[1:06:26] christians though we might have the
[1:06:28] greatest amount of revelation of the
[1:06:29] word of god the restored word of god
[1:06:31] including the seven seals but jesus
[1:06:34] christ's description of laodicea says
[1:06:36] nothing about us being greater than any
[1:06:38] other age
[1:06:39] let's listen to the
[1:06:44] quotes we see that knowing that this is
[1:06:48] the lady of age
[1:06:50] and knowing that this age needs a sharp
[1:06:53] rebuke from god
[1:06:56] it needs a sharp review
[1:06:59] and when uh our clergy gets so soft and
[1:07:02] dirty
[1:07:04] we see this age that we're living in
[1:07:07] it's one of the grandest ages of all
[1:07:10] ages
[1:07:11] this ladies church age is the grandest
[1:07:13] of all the church ages because it's the
[1:07:16] ending of time and the blending of
[1:07:18] eternity
[1:07:19] and then it's the greatest
[1:07:22] sinful age
[1:07:24] it's more sin in this age than it's ever
[1:07:27] been and the powers of satan is as many
[1:07:31] times
[1:07:32] harder to fight against than it was in
[1:07:34] any age
[1:07:38] in one place brother branham called
[1:07:39] laodicea the grandest of all ages but
[1:07:41] here in this quote from does he change
[1:07:43] 1965 brother branham said
[1:07:45] we're in the worst age of them all let's
[1:07:48] listen to the quote
[1:07:50] now i claim that he is alive today and
[1:07:53] his spirit after the church ages were in
[1:07:55] the ladies and churches the last call
[1:07:58] the worst of all of them because he was
[1:07:59] plucked out of the church remember son
[1:08:01] of man
[1:08:02] and he was put out of the church not an
[1:08:05] organization out of an organization but
[1:08:06] a person
[1:08:08] out of an organization
[1:08:10] none of the other church agents had that
[1:08:12] since the lady i'll see you
[1:08:14] if you're spiritual you'll understand
[1:08:18] remember matthew 5 verse 19 jesus says
[1:08:21] the great ones in the kingdom of heaven
[1:08:23] do and teach the truth
[1:08:25] there are so many message preachers
[1:08:26] today that attack true doctrine
[1:08:29] they attack the preaching of doctrine
[1:08:31] and friends sadly they're modeling a
[1:08:33] prideful attitude before their
[1:08:34] congregations and even the children by
[1:08:37] exalting themselves as the goats of
[1:08:39] christianity
[1:08:41] jesus said whosoever therefore shall
[1:08:43] break one of these least commandments
[1:08:44] and shall teach men so he shall be
[1:08:46] called the least in the kingdom of
[1:08:48] heaven but whosoever shall do and teach
[1:08:50] them the same should be called great in
[1:08:52] the kingdom of heaven
[1:08:54] a plea for humility
[1:08:57] in first peter 5 5 peter says be clothed
[1:09:01] with humility
[1:09:02] friends humility is an attitude we must
[1:09:05] put on daily as paul said we must die
[1:09:07] daily he said be renewed in the spirit
[1:09:10] of your mind day by day
[1:09:12] as we humble ourselves we will serve
[1:09:14] others for the greatest among us will be
[1:09:16] the servants
[1:09:18] so today's preachers and all message
[1:09:20] believers must ask themselves
[1:09:22] am i serving or are others serving me
[1:09:26] friend one way to increase your humility
[1:09:28] is to increase your secret acts of
[1:09:30] service to god as brother branham said
[1:09:32] in the church age book and also as jesus
[1:09:35] says in the sermon on the mount let's
[1:09:37] listen to the quote from the church age
[1:09:38] book where brother ram says we increase
[1:09:41] our service unto god
[1:09:43] i know thy works and the last to be more
[1:09:46] than the first
[1:09:48] this is certainly remarkable
[1:09:50] as the darkness of the age increased as
[1:09:52] the honor roll of the martyrs grew
[1:09:53] lengthier day by day
[1:09:55] they worked all the harder they served
[1:09:57] all the more and their faith increased
[1:10:00] how tragic it was that in the ephesian
[1:10:02] age love waned
[1:10:04] and truly nothing is said of the
[1:10:06] increased labor of love in the other
[1:10:08] ages
[1:10:09] but in this age and the darkest of all
[1:10:11] ages they served him even more
[1:10:14] what a lesson that is
[1:10:16] there is no ceasing of this gracious
[1:10:18] service of love unto the lord but rather
[1:10:20] an increasing of it
[1:10:21] that is the secret
[1:10:23] let the enemy attempt to thwart our
[1:10:25] service to the lord
[1:10:26] our reply is increased service
[1:10:29] when the faint are crying in fear that
[1:10:31] is the time to shout the victory
[1:10:34] friends some preachers are exalting
[1:10:36] themselves rather than humbling
[1:10:38] themselves
[1:10:40] we should all humble ourselves and let
[1:10:41] god exalt us in god's time in season and
[1:10:44] not let others exalt us
[1:10:47] brother bran was so humble he never
[1:10:49] called himself the goat he never called
[1:10:50] himself the greatest of all time
[1:10:52] in fact in the seventh seal he said give
[1:10:55] all the credit to jesus christ he said
[1:10:57] i'm not fit to live and i'm not saying
[1:10:59] that to be humble he said let's be gems
[1:11:02] in the crown of jesus christ let's
[1:11:04] listen to the quotes
[1:11:06] um i'm open and trusting that you people
[1:11:09] realize that i'm trying to put this
[1:11:11] grace on jesus christ who is the author
[1:11:15] of all of it and the only reason you
[1:11:17] never heard me talk like this before in
[1:11:19] your life
[1:11:20] but this hour is approaching amen
[1:11:27] may you always bear that in mind to be a
[1:11:30] gem in the crown of jesus christ
[1:11:33] paul said to the church you are you are
[1:11:35] the jewels the gems of his crown we want
[1:11:38] to be the gems of the crown of jesus
[1:11:40] christ
[1:11:41] we don't want never put a man in it you
[1:11:44] forget anything about me
[1:11:46] i am your brother a sinner saved by
[1:11:49] grace
[1:11:50] not fit to live
[1:11:52] that's exactly the truth i stand out to
[1:11:54] be humble that's facts
[1:11:57] there's nothing in me not one sound
[1:11:59] thing at all
[1:12:00] but the grace of god has left my poor
[1:12:04] dimming
[1:12:05] eyes look beyond
[1:12:10] [Music]
[1:12:12] in this next quote from questions in
[1:12:13] answers 59
[1:12:15] brother branham said he said when you
[1:12:17] act like jesus that's where you find the
[1:12:19] holy spirit and the holy spirit makes
[1:12:21] you meek makes you humble makes you
[1:12:23] forgiving
[1:12:24] how can the holy spirit be upon
[1:12:26] preachers that are exalting themselves
[1:12:28] as the greatest of all time
[1:12:30] that's a prideful thing to do not a
[1:12:32] humble thing to do
[1:12:33] it would seem either they're not born
[1:12:35] again or they could be born again with
[1:12:37] awful prideful sinful complexes
[1:12:40] let's listen to the quote
[1:12:42] now if the spirit of elijah upon john
[1:12:46] would make john act like elijah the
[1:12:49] spirit of god upon you will make you act
[1:12:52] like jesus
[1:12:55] now there's where you find the holy
[1:12:56] spirit
[1:12:59] that's what the holy spirit does it
[1:13:01] makes you unique makes you humble makes
[1:13:04] you forgiving
[1:13:08] next is a beautiful quote from influence
[1:13:10] 1963.
[1:13:11] brother graham said he had to constantly
[1:13:13] plead that god would not lift his hands
[1:13:16] from him
[1:13:17] he said all men are subject to mistakes
[1:13:19] and brother ram said he would fall if
[1:13:21] god ever lifted his hand off his life
[1:13:23] let's listen to the quote
[1:13:25] now that's us
[1:13:27] any man any
[1:13:30] he's subject to man
[1:13:32] because he's human he's subject to the
[1:13:35] violations of god's laws and he's
[1:13:38] subject to many things because satan
[1:13:41] tempts him and he's just a human being
[1:13:43] and god ever lifted his hands and fall
[1:13:46] that's all
[1:13:47] and um i've heard people say oh satan
[1:13:49] can't do it yes you just let god lift
[1:13:51] his hand one time and watch what
[1:13:53] happened it's uh i constantly plead god
[1:13:56] don't send him have mercy on me keep him
[1:13:59] away from you see i need god's mercy and
[1:14:02] we all need that
[1:14:05] friends let's do what the scripture says
[1:14:07] let's humble ourselves
[1:14:09] let us pray in secret fast and secret
[1:14:12] give alms in secret jesus said when you
[1:14:14] hold a feast invite the people who
[1:14:16] cannot pay you back
[1:14:18] when peter and paul left one another in
[1:14:20] galatians chapter 2 the bible said their
[1:14:22] last words were to remember the poor
[1:14:24] that's what the early apostles cared
[1:14:26] about and that's what we should care
[1:14:27] about today
[1:14:29] and lastly friends here's a quote from
[1:14:31] power transformation where brother brahm
[1:14:33] says
[1:14:34] we have no brag only on jesus christ we
[1:14:37] only brag on jesus christ
[1:14:40] friends preachers should not be bragging
[1:14:41] on one another
[1:14:43] we should not be exalting one another
[1:14:45] calling each other the greatest of all
[1:14:46] time or some of the greatest in history
[1:14:49] we should only be exalting the lord
[1:14:50] jesus christ
[1:14:52] let's listen to the quote
[1:14:56] come forth god ordained it so that there
[1:14:58] must come forth them seven seals must be
[1:15:01] open it was supposed to be done in this
[1:15:03] lady of sea and age and i think beyond
[1:15:05] any shadow of doubt not as we brag we
[1:15:07] have no brag only on jesus christ none
[1:15:09] of us
[1:15:10] we only brag on jesus christ but we are
[1:15:12] thankful for the privilege of knowing
[1:15:15] but only beyond any shadow of doubt god
[1:15:18] has chosen us in this last days and has
[1:15:21] proven it by the signs and the heavens
[1:15:23] and the earth and every one of them
[1:15:24] coming right straight back to the word
[1:15:26] to prove that it's so
[1:15:27] this age that we live in the message and
[1:15:29] how it is we're not a cult we're not a
[1:15:32] bunch of fanatics
[1:15:33] we are servants of god that's been
[1:15:35] called by the holy ghost
[1:15:38] you'll have all kinds of names tagged to
[1:15:40] you but that don't mean it's so
[1:15:43] in closing
[1:15:46] friends there's so much more on this
[1:15:47] topic i was overwhelmed by the amount of
[1:15:50] quotes and scriptures on the subject of
[1:15:52] the sin of pride
[1:15:55] each one of us need to examine ourselves
[1:15:57] daily to make sure we're in the faith as
[1:15:58] ii corinthians says
[1:16:00] humbling ourself under the mighty hand
[1:16:02] of god
[1:16:03] let us pray for the preachers who are
[1:16:04] exalting themselves and their
[1:16:06] congregations as the greatest of all
[1:16:08] time
[1:16:09] let's pray they humble themselves before
[1:16:11] god has to humble them
[1:16:14] let us only brag on the lord jesus
[1:16:16] christ
[1:16:17] let us not worry about where we are
[1:16:18] ranked among the greatest of all time
[1:16:21] let's be concerned about doing the
[1:16:22] father's business spreading the gospel
[1:16:24] winning souls praying for the sick
[1:16:27] prayer fasting giving of alms
[1:16:29] being a true child of the heavenly
[1:16:31] father as jesus said let us be children
[1:16:34] of our father
[1:16:35] and friends if we're a continuation of
[1:16:37] the book of acts church then we should
[1:16:39] do what they did we should be so
[1:16:41] concerned about the members in our
[1:16:42] church if any of them lack anything we
[1:16:44] should be the first ones to help them
[1:16:46] out to make sure we have all things in
[1:16:48] common because the spirit of jesus
[1:16:50] christ is divine love and divine love is
[1:16:53] a thing we need to make it over there by
[1:16:54] the grace of god
