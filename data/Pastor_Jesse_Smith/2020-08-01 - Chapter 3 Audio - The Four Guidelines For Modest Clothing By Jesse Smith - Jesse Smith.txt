TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter three four guidelines for modest clothing includes footnotes 178 to 226. in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shame-facedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array first timothy 2 verse 9 how should a christian dress in modest apparel you may have wondered how do i know i have enough clothes on no doubt some christians have struggled with the balance of wanting to look fashionable and modern but not become seductive scriptures will give you confidence to know you are dressing in a way that honors god people around you will know that you love the lord jesus christ when you present yourself according to the modesty guidelines of the bible modesty guidelines the clothes we wear are very important to god modest clothing is not a suggestion as paul commands christians specifically women to wear modest clothing in 1st timothy 2 verse 9. paul undoubtedly received the revelation about modest clothing from jesus christ for he claims all his writings were inspired by christ this further proves jesus earnestly wants his followers to wear modest clothing modesty is a commandment for both women and men as the book of genesis teaches after adam and eve sinned modest clothes were so important that god himself came down to eden to provide a sacrifice for their sins and to clothe them in coats or tunics of skins we must stand for modesty because the bible teaches it just like we stand for the sanctity of life because god does teaching followers of christ to observe the commandments of christ is not legalism it is being loyal to jesus's commands just as jesus was loyal to all the father's commands in fact ministers are actually fulfilling jesus's great commission by teaching his disciples to observe the command for modest clothing for jesus admonishes his disciples to observe all his commandments every church was taught modesty every church paul visited heard the same course of conduct including the command for modest clothing does your church teach modest clothing it should god loves unity among his churches god knew that christians would serve god best when they all had the same expectations and course of conduct paul encouraged all christians to have one faith one mind and walk in the same judgment early christians were of one heart and soul and before the second coming of jesus christ all christians will come to a unity of faith in the word of god the true churches of jesus christ will be united on all of their teachings when jesus returns and modest clothing will be included in that group the apostle admonished the philippians to all mine the same rule or standard the greek word for rule is canon which means a carpenter's measuring tape or standard every christians use the same standard the word of god for measuring their lives redirecting attention to christ two dictionary definitions of modest are not revealing or emphasizing the figure and dressing to avoid indecency especially to avoid sexual attention a person who dresses modestly tries to redirect the attention from themselves to someone else our lord and savior jesus christ christians should be humble meaning that they should have a modest opinion of themselves as they consider their weaknesses faults and tendency to fail they should be so impressed with the strength righteousness and prevailing power of christ that they willingly redirect all attention to their lord just as institutions and businesses have guidelines or a course of conduct god's kingdom has its guidelines modest clothing guidelines provide protection boundaries assurance and safety you have probably seen school children wearing uniforms or sports teams clothed identically their outward appearance helps you identify their cause purpose and mission the same is true with christians their modest clothes proclaim their mission to magnify and glorify the lord jesus christ best of all when you choose to dress modestly in obedience the holy spirit gives you the invaluable blessed assurance that you desire in your daily life you will feel pure in your soul peter says obedience produces a feeling of a purified soul he wrote seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently paul says there are three parts to your being mind body and soul your mind and body may not feel pure as the mind is the battlefield of good and evil thoughts but your soul will feel clean from your obedience defining parts of the body by the bible in daniel chapter 2 the bible provides a five-part division of the human body we can use as an outline to help us understand boundaries for each body area daniel was allowed by god to see and interpret nebuchadnezzar's dream of the great image that represented the time of the gentiles led of god daniel saw god's division of the image's body into five parts the head the breast and arms the belly and thighs the legs and the feet this god-ordained division of the human image defines the five different areas of the body first the head division would include the head and neck with the lower boundary being the shoulder next the breasts and arms would include the area from the shoulder down to the bottom of the rib cage third the belly and thighs would begin under the ribs and continue down to the knee this region includes the area referred to in scripture as the loins which is the hips and reproductive area fourth the legs are the area from the shin down to the ankle last the foot division entails the area from the ankle down to the toes with these five divisions in mind god in his mercy has given us a clear upper and lower boundary for our bodies that he wants us to cover with clothing as a rule of thumb christians should cover from their shoulders down to their shins or put another way using the five divisions bible terminology from the breast and arms down past the belly and thighs the upper boundary must be the shoulder because exposed breasts can arouse lustful thoughts the shin or upper leg area below the knees is the lower boundary because exposed thighs and loins are nakedness undoubtedly inciting lustful thoughts whether a person is seated or standing 4 guidelines for modest clothing the bible defines the perfect will of god on how to dress modestly over time and through much study god revealed to me that there are four guidelines though possibly more christians should honor concerning their outward appearance cover nakedness thick clothing or multiple layers clothing loose clothing number one guideline cover nakedness the first guideline is to cover all areas of the body that god considers nakedness the scriptures that teach this guideline are genesis 3 verse 7 and verse 21 isaiah 47 verses 1 through 3 1st kings 18 verse 46 and proverbs 31 verse 17. in genesis 3 verse 7 and 21 god provides the upper and lower boundaries for modest clothing the shoulder and the shin chapter 1 covers god's own choice for clothing in the section titled the beginning and ending of modest clothing just as the unchanging god clothed adam and eve with modest full-length tunics we are sure he wants us closed so that our breasts belly loins thighs and knees are fully covered in isaiah 47 verses 1 through 3 isaiah told the virgin daughter of babylon or people in the city of babylon that god would allow their nakedness to be uncovered in this case nakedness meant uncovered thighs or the area from the hips down to the knee thighs are clearly defined as one of the five divisions of the human body and christians should always wear clothes that cover the thighs and knees first kings 18 46 and proverbs 31 verse 17 prove that the lower boundary for modest clothing is the shin when elijah ran to jezreel he girded up his loins meaning he gathered up the end of his loose robe which probably extended to his feet and tucked it into his belt or girdle so he could freely run by girding up his loins elijah would have exposed his feet ankles and shins but not his thighs the same idea is seen for women in proverbs 31 verse 17 as the distinguished proverbs 31 woman girdeth up her loins with strength at times israeli men and women had to gird up their loins to do physical labor exposing their shins but were still able to cover the nakedness of their thighs it is important to note that unless israelis were involved in physical labor they spent the rest of their time with their robes untucked from their girdles presenting a more modest appearance that covered nearly all their legs more support for covering the shoulders breasts loins and legs there's much more scriptural support for covering the body from the breasts or shoulders down to the upper leg or shins i will start at the top of the body and work my way down some people wonder if the shoulder should be covered exposing the shoulders is nakedness in the sight of god based upon the definition of the tunic in genesis 3 21 a long shirt-like garment an ancient tunic would have certainly covered the shoulders and there are no scriptures that support exposing shoulders in public scripture proves exposing the breast or bosom area is considered nakedness the breasts of a woman are strictly accessible and visible to her lawful husband only whoredom either adultery or fornication is committed when anyone other than her husband presses or handles the breast of a woman women should wear clothes that cover their breasts and the rest of the body parts considered nakedness because jesus taught that men are often tempted to look upon women and lust with sexual desires in their hearts if these sexual sins whether committed in the mind or body are unconfessed those guilty will not inherit the kingdom of god and will burn in the lake of fire additionally there are 75 scriptures in the king james bible that reference the shoulders and none of them teach that exposing the shoulders is a godly act the israeli high priest is an example of covering the shoulders as he wore a garment called an ephod an apron-like garment which completely covered his shoulders before going into the presence of god this ephod was worn on top of the longest tunic-like garment the robe which covered the shoulders and extended to the feet god expresses that the uncovered loins and thighs are nakedness the lord instituted holy garments to cover the nakedness of the regular israeli priests during acts of worship in the tabernacle and temple god commanded the priests to wear breaches to cover from the waist to the thighs which were worn under the long outer robe as the priest ascended the elevated brazen altar worshipers may have seen the linen breeches under the priest's robe rather than the priest's nakedness the legs are not an area of nakedness but christians should wisely choose to cover more of their legs more of the time while both israeli men and women cover their legs one bible almanac writes that israeli women's robes always covered more of their legs than men as women usually covered all of their legs including the ankles and feet when physical work needed done both men and women girded their loins and god allowed their shins to be exposed for short periods of time the section ancient hebrew clothing in chapter 7 elaborates on traditional hebrew clothing the book of revelation gives evidence that all of our legs will be covered in heaven as jesus christ's garment covered his breast and arms and extended all the way to his feet revelation 1 verse 13 says john the apostle whom jesus loved saw a vision of jesus in his glorified body representing christ's supreme deity jesus was clothed in a garment down to the foot the greek lexicon defines garment as reaching to the feet ankles observe first that jesus was not showing off tone muscular arms abs legs and thighs like many do today he was not showing off any body part jesus was clothed modestly the lesson is that jesus christ himself will set the example for modest clothing in heaven jesus is the great shepherd according to hebrews 13 verse 20 he leads the way for the sheep to follow jesus as a man models complete modesty and holiness in the clothing he wears throughout eternity what a blessing it is to know that god delights in modesty standards in this world and in the eternal world to come application to apply the cover nakedness guideline common sense tells you that exposing your breasts down to your thighs incites lustful thoughts in others remember to cover from your shoulders to your shins which is the minimum god's spirit convicts me to cover all of my legs down to my ankles for myself a man god calls me to spiritually lead my family and the church i pastor so i lead in modesty as well my clothing always covers from my shoulders down to my ankles i never wear shorts because they would expose my thighs all my pants reach at least to my ankles although christians do not wear robes today the bible does not command us to wear robes we must still cover the same real estate or body divisions that god considers nakedness number two guideline thick clothing or multiple layers the second guideline is to wear thick opaque clothing or multiple layers of clothes in order to redirect attention away from your body the scriptures that teach this guideline are genesis 3 21 matthew 5 40 judges 3 16 and john 21 verse 7. genesis 3 21 teaches that god clothed adam and eve with coats of skins these skins were probably lambskins since it would fit god's nature to have the first animal sacrifices foreshadow the crucifixion of jesus christ who is the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world if this was the case a lambskin tunic would be very thick this apparel would not reveal the form of the body nor would it be see-through making it very modest an easy example of the thickness of this type of clothing is to picture in your mind shearling or sheepskin boots god wanted thick clothing that did not reveal the form or private parts of the body god's fashion choices are so different from modern fashions layers of clothing are mentioned by jesus in matthew 5 40 in which our lord spoke of one person owning both coats and cloaks in jesus time people needed multiple layers of clothes to keep warm during the cold conditions the coats jesus spoke of were thin shirt-like undergarments like tunics worn next to the skin these coats were the undergarment layer like underwear today but with much more cloth or material than our modern day underwear because tunics were like a very long shirt the cloak was the outer garment or outside garment worn on top of the tunic or coat another word for cloak is robe which is like the scarlet robe the roman soldiers put upon jesus this robe or cloak was an outer garment usually worn over the tunic judges 3 verse 16 provides another example of these two layers coats and cloaks e hood the israeli deliverer hid a dagger under his outer garment by girding it to his right thigh girding the dagger meant binding or securing it in place using a belt or girdle ehood's dagger was hidden from the evil moabite king eglon because it was under his outer raiment or cloak it is important to state that god considered a person to be naked when he took off his outer garment his cloak or robe without the outer garment the person would be viewed in only his thin tunic undergarment while fishing peter had his outer garment off the fisher's coat and the bible records peter as being naked the reason peter was not sinning though was because he was among men only the other apostles jesus did a similar thing when he laid aside his garments before washing the apostles feet both peter and jesus did not sin for they were not around women when they took off their outer garments during work fishing or worship feet washing some erroneously believe david danced naked in public before the lord but according to scripture he wore at least two layers of clothing a robe of fine linen and an ephod of linen david's wife macau said he uncovered himself shamelessly in front of the hand-made servants based upon the context the only plausible meaning for uncovered is that david took off his royal clothing in order to be dressed in the same manner as the levites singers and chenanaya nevertheless the text proves michal's accusation against david was wrong for she died childless david on the other hand became more honored in his servant's eyes because he increased his rejoicing dancing and leaping before god application applying the second guideline means wearing at least two layers or one thick layer of clothing and abstaining from walking around in your underwear or undergarments in public appearing in public or at a pool or beach in a bathing suit would break god's word as most bathing suits and shorts only have one layer of thin clothing swimsuits almost always reveal the form of the body seductively exposing areas of the body that god considers nakedness number three guideline gender specific clothing the third guideline is to wear gender-specific clothing meaning men should wear men's clothing and women should wear women's clothing the scripture that directly teaches this guideline is deuteronomy 22 verse 5. three more scriptures support this guideline by emphasizing god's immutability and jesus example of not cross-dressing malachi 3 verse 6 hebrews 4 15 and hebrews 13 verse 8. although deuteronomy 22 verse 5 is an old testament scripture there are two reasons it applies to christians first cross-dressing is called an abomination or disgusting thing and no new testament scripture permits it the reason old testament abominations remained detestable in the new is because god said he is unchanging his holy nature abhorred all evil aboundable acts yesterday and abhors them today and will abhor them forever for jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever in the days of moses and jesus men and women could be easily differentiated visually just by looking at their outer clothing based upon deuteronomy 22 verse 5. obedient god-fearing jews wore gender-specific outer garments and so do christians today second jesus never cross-dressed like a woman hebrews 4 15 teaches that jesus never broke one old testament commandment since crossdressing was strictly forbidden in the law of moses jesus never wore clothes that pertained to a woman furthermore jesus instituted the new testament and the kingdom of god upon this earth while wearing men's garments jesus modeled and lived this standard during his earthly life if jesus is the same forever then he will remain dressed like a man forever throughout time and then into eternity two other bible references support the fact that god wants specific differences in the outward appearances of men and women first god commanded men to have short hair in women to have long uncut hair this means men and women need different hair lengths and outer garments second in king david's time great emphasis was placed upon the virginity of the king's daughters who wore garments of virginity while we find no record of virgin garments in the new testament this example shows that god's people always have a pattern of visually separating genders god wants his society to operate with defined god-given roles easily determined by gender outer garments and hair length when a society allows gender and clothing to become indistinguishable a state of confusion or babel occurs and god is not the author of confusion in 2015 when bruce jenner publicly declared himself transgender and changed his name to caitlyn he was both widely praised and heavily scrutinized according to deuteronomy 22 verse 5 god considers this transgender act an abomination because a man bruce jenner is wearing the clothes of a woman what most people do not realize though is that the same public scrutiny that bruce jenner received partly for his cross-dressing as a woman was the same public scrutiny that women such as marlene dietrich and catherine hepburn received for wearing pants and dressing as men in the 1930s and 1940s not even 100 years ago the book women and pants by katherine smith and cynthia gregg fully documents the undeniable history of the scrutiny that surrounded women who first began cross-dressing and wearing men's pants application based upon america's judeo-christian foundation american men should always wear pants and women should always wear dresses or skirts without compromise at all times and in all situations other nations may have different types of clothes that pertain to gender for nearly 200 years our country honored the gender-specific clothing guideline but acceptance for cross-dressing became popular in the 1960s and 1970s as chapter 6 details number four guideline loose clothing the fourth guideline is to wear loose clothing as taught in genesis 3 verse 21 first kings 19 verse 13 mark 16 verse 5 revelation 6 verse 11 revelation 7 verse 14 and proverbs 7 verse 10. in genesis 3 verse 21 and 1st kings 19 verse 13 the outer garments coats for adam and eve and a mantle for elijah were loose-fitting garments as previously taught adam and eve's animal skin tunics were thick and long but also loose fitting god never asked anyone to wear tight clothing so loose clothes are his unchanging holy pattern elijah's mantle was undoubtedly loose as he could not have wrapped a skin-tight mantle around his face since robe materials like linen and camel hair are not stretchy the entire heavenly host of angels wear loose-fitting robes mark 16 verse 5 describes the angel's attire on resurrection morning as a long white garment the greek lexicon defines garment as a loose outer garment for men extending to the feet loose long clothing is the will of heaven in revelation 7 verse 14 multitudes of christians who are washed in the blood of jesus will also wear loose white robes in heaven similar to those the angels wear the word robes in revelation 7 14 has the same greek meaning as garment from mark 16 verse 5 a loose outer garment for men extending to the feet it is clear that every person with eternal life will be clothed in loose long white robes for all eternity if we are going to spend all eternity with loose clothes that cover our bodies according to the wisdom and design of god himself then we should be happy to start wearing loose clothing right now when you live your life here on earth according to the will of heaven and wear loose long clothing you are letting the will of heaven come down to earth this is the fulfillment of the lord's prayer thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven proverbs 7 verse 10 speaks of a harlot or prostitute with an evil heart she has the attire of an harlot even in the old testament days certain garments pertain to harlots as genesis 38 verses 14 through 19 speaks of in reference to tamar according to god's truth that there is nothing new under the sun harlots today just like thousands of years ago dress in a way that attracts the attention of men prostitutes are known for wearing tight revealing clothing breaking the bible commands for loose clothing that also covers areas of the body god considers nakedness from a logical standpoint christians must avoid wearing tight clothing because it draws the wrong kind of attention to the body application christians should wear loose clothes at all times not drawing sexual attention to themselves god never asks anyone to wear tight outer garments and he won't start now loose clothes make up both our earthly and heavenly wardrobes putting your clothes to the test based upon these four modest clothing guidelines you can now begin to recognize examples of immodest clothing and give your clothes the word test you can keep the clothes that pass the four guideline tests and send the immodest clothes to your local second hand store to help you get started i made a list of clothes that would most certainly be considered immodest according to the four bible guidelines mini skirts sun dresses high slit skirts low cut dresses shorts short shorts skinny jeans yoga pants halter or tube tops sheer blouses most swimsuits and bikinis and tank tops just to name a few if you have a question about whether an article of clothing is modest use the four guidelines to determine if the clothing is pleasing to god if you feel the four guidelines still do not answer your question then you should ask god to reveal his wisdom while waiting for god's revelation from the bible you should refrain from wearing the questionable clothing until you can prove by scripture that it is pleasing to god scripture declares that god seeks to give us abundant wisdom but we must not doubt that god will provide the correct course of action for doubt will lead us to missing the wisdom of god refraining from wearing questionable clothes shows that you have patience the fear of the lord and a desire to please god more than men ask god for patience for in patience you will possess your soul and have need of nothing conclusion the bible declares that its words are inspired of god and are profitable for doctrine reproof correction and instruction that the christian may be complete and furnished unto every good work in regards to the four guidelines for modest clothing a sufficient amount of scripture provides us with an unwavering doctrinal stand upon the witnesses of holy writ through nearly two decades of bible study i have never found the bible supporting clothes that contradict the four guidelines i have confidence in my creator that his desire and command for modest clothing has never changed and never will it is possible that god may reveal to me a fifth or perhaps sixth guideline in the future as i wait upon the lord for further revelation he will certainly renew my strength as the eagle god will empower me to run the christian race without weariness and walk without fainting i conclude this chapter in hope that you will now have an answer to anyone who asks you about the reason you choose to clothe yourself in such a modest beautiful but often times unpopular way you can say with confidence god has four clearly defined guidelines for modest clothing and i am following his commands in meekness and fear
