TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and I took my Bible the little SC field Bible about like that and I put it on my arms and I took off I believe that the church goes through the tribulation period Church organization that's right but the bride does not would you choose the woman you had to purify before you married her greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to make a reaction video to John Rich's recent stance against the Scofield bible and against the pre-tribulation Rapture Revelation that God revealed to his Prophet The Late William brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William brandham I also defend brother bram's Godly Christian character in this video I'm defending God's Revelation that he gave to brother brandham regarding the Rapture and the fact that the Rapture is pre-tribulation so the origin of this video is last summer I saw a short video with Tucker Carlson and John rich and they were blasting the Scofield bible and that's a Bible that I've Loved it's the Bible brother random used most often he said there were other Bibles probably better that one of my first Bibles and I just learned to read it like that and I just keep the same Bible which uh if I had the Thompson Chain it would have been much better I could found my text much faster on a Thompson Chain but he just got used to using the scoffield Bible and therefore he kept using it he could find the scriptures where they were located on the pages and then after seeing this video I went back and studied the Rapture again and just preached three sermons recently on the coming of the lord The Rapture mystery so I found it's great to revisit subjects and it's interesting how the enemy will attack them at certain times I was surprised by this attack on the pre-tribulation Rapture and upon the Scofield bible so I thought I'd make a reaction video by the grace of God I think I'll start with some quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham on his scoffield Bible the first one is from 1950 the Angel and the commission brother Brandon was wondering about whether his Visions were from God or not the preachers were telling him it was not from God but he told his wife he said he's going to take some time to go into his cave find out whether it's from God or not and he said he would stay there until he died if God didn't answer him but of course we know thankfully God answered him his gift was from the Holy Ghost and it's interesting the only thing he took into that cave was his scoffield Bible he said that little old scoffield Bible then of course the angel of Lord visited him the angel was always scriptural and then I'll play a portion from the angel of God 1947 reiterating what the angel told him a gift of Divine Healing would be given to him for the peoples of the world let's listen to the quotes and this Angel still speaking behind me which is a big man and he said I will meet you in there and watch he's always scriptural he said did not our Lord say when thou prayest be not like the Hypocrites that like to make a show said enter into the secret closet and when you've done so close the door then pray your father what seeth in secret and he that seeth in secret shall reward thee openly now I said to my wife I said honey call them up tell them I don't know when I'll ever be back to work again for I am now going to find out what that is or die I said if I said I got about $23 left in the bank and I'll write you a check and I'm going to leave and I shall never return until I find out what that is that's followed me all my days one says this and one says that but I'm going to find out what it is and I took my Bible little old SC field Bible about like that and I put it under my arms and I took off I went I read until night time I got a cave I go into and be way back in the hill and I prayed and I prayed I was that free but when he came visible it was a man that was seing would weigh 200 lb yes it's true friends I couldn't see and he said to me I just sit there and he said fear not I'm sensing the presence of God to tell you that this peculiar life of yours peculiar birth a gift of Divine Healing to the peoples of the world instead if you'll be sincere and will get the people to believe you there will be no disease stand before your prayer not even to cancer and he said it'll come to pass that you'll tell the people their diseases from a vibration over your hand then if you will be reverent on then you will tell the people the sins of their lives and the things that they have done dear friends there a Bible before me this afternoon has come to pass I went forth here's a second quote where brother brand say said I'm not a scoffield I so brother bran must have known people that just believed every word scoffield said so brother BR was not a scoffield i neither am I a brandham I I don't worship all of brother bram's words like some people do but I know for sure God's Prophet brother Bram was a genuine prophet of God I preach his message for all 20 years I've been preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote and of course the natural meaning of that even Dr scofi in his footnotes I'm not a scofi I but but however in his footnotes there he gives that it meant when the syrians come over and invade it that's true here's a quote from 1957 brother Ram says he has a scoffield Bible he says he doesn't agree with scoffield on many of his theories but he likes the way it's set up he's had it for a long time he knows how to find his subject let's listen to the quote I got a small Scofield and I'm used to the Scofield bible it's markings I don't read the Scofield F notes now because I don't agree with scoffield on many of his the uh his theories but I I do like way it's set up because it's I've had it for a long time and read it and so much kind of know how to find my subject all right so let's move on to this next part here well let's look at I want to look at three comments from this video between Tucker Carlson and John rich I guess in one way you could say it's viral it's got almost 4 million views the first comment is Tucker Carlson's comment on the scoffield Bible and the scoffield commentary we're on the 46 minute Mark Tucker Carlson claims that the commentary of scoffield has had massive effects on our politics resulting in the deaths of many people here's that video clip uh the Bible has had massive effects on our politics that have been very very negative and resulted in the deaths of a lot of people so I do know that for a fact but I don't know much about the theology so would you now my reaction to that is that could someone please tell me which Darby or scoffield comments have led to so many deaths through the American government one person thought perhaps that it was scoffield support for Israel that is carried over into the United States government support for funding Israel's war efforts over the years not sure I can verify that right now I would need videos of past presidents past senators past Representatives saying that they wanted to fund Israel's Wars because God was going in return to bless them and then revealed to them Jesus as their Messi mesiah because that's what Scofield taught Scofield taught just what the Bible teaches that God would eventually cut off the Gentiles and then graft back in the Jews and 144,000 will receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost secondly let's look at John Rich's comment about the buz saww Trap that pre-tribulation Believers might walk into which I believe is ridiculous but let's look at that here so here we're on the 49 minute Mark John Rich claims the danger of the pre-tribulation Rapture is that they will say or pre-tribulation Believers will say it can't be the mark of the beast or Antichrist because I'm still here go ahead and sign me up let's watch the video clip people do so why is it dangerous right now that Christians have this idea that they're going to be out of here before any of the things that are prophesied about happen why is that dangerous it's dangerous because when the mark of the beast shows up when the on a predition shows up who is who refer to as the Antichrist when those things happen and they're still here they'll say well that can't be the mark of the beast that can't be the Antichrist because I'm still here what danger does that put someone in that's not the mark of the beast because I'm still here so go ahead sign me up think about the the level of danger with that and it has not existed in my opinion until recently since technology has gotten to the point to actually execute these things so my reaction on that is that you cannot deceive the elect according to Matthew 24:4 Jesus said it be so close it would deceive the very elect if it were possible so of course it's not possible deceive the very elect because their names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the Bible tells us that plainly The Book of Revelation and the Bible said we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world in Ephesians 1: 4 and 5 so therefore a true Holy Ghost filled Christian will not be deceived by the mark of the beast a true Holy Ghost filled Christian will not accept the beast's Temptation that they cannot buy or sell without its Mark The Book of Revelation is clear that only those whose names were not written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundational world will take the mark That's according to Revelation 13:8 and all those that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so it seems humbly I'm just saying John Rich does not understand predestination you cannot deceive the very elect and third and finally John Rich uses his proof text that there is no pre-tribulation Rapture uh from 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and Matthew 24 for time sake I'm not going to show the video of this but I just want to make some comments here let's look at those two texts in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 yes Paul does talk about the Antichrist but he never says that the Christians will see the Antichrist or be tempted by the Antichrist so John Rich's of course misunderstanding 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 Paul told us when the Antichrist would be revealed in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 he said there must come a falling away first we see that happening of course in the last 100 years or so people falling away from the faith the true Faith the baptism of the Holy Ghost Holiness God as one person the faith of the apostolic fathers 2 Thessalonians 27 says only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way so God is letting the mystery of iniquity already work through many false Antichrist and he will let it continue until the Holy Ghost is taken out of the way this connects to Romans 11 where the Gentiles are grafted in to the holy tree God's spirit but then finally the time of the Gentiles will be fulfilled according to Luke 21:24 as Jesus said and Romans 11:25 I believe it is until the last Gentile believer is saved and then God will cut off the Gentiles that's when the Rapture happens Jesus snatches harpazo is the Greek word Jesus catches away the Gentile Church who's the wise virgin who has the oil Jesus snatches them away takes them up to the meeting of the air takes them to the the wedding ceremony then the wedding reception and that is when God then cuts off the Gentiles and he goes back to the Jews through the two prophets so again Anyone who reads 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 will realize Paul never said the Holy Ghost filled Christians would see the Antichrist himself and have to choose between taking the the Mark or not remember Revelation 3:10 literally says God will keep us from that moment of having to decide because thou kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the hour of Temptation which will come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth and second John Rich read Matthew 24 now Matthew 24 is greatly misunderstood by most people Clarence Larin had a good insight into it he saw how six of the Seven Seals were in Matthew 24 and he notes how they asked Jesus three questions in Matthew 24:3 what's the sign when there won't be one stone left upon another in the temple of Herod when was the sign of Jesus's second coming and what's the sign of the end of the world this is what John Rich misses there's three different comings or there's three different events in Matthew 24 I don't have time to go through all of Matthew 24 but I preached a sermon on it recently so I'll leave a link to that in the description if you want to listen to that by the grace of God to summarize it the six seals are in Matthew 24 and then Jesus answers the question about those three events but his answers are not in chronological order you have to look at the short context of each set of verses and then match them to the three different events so as brother Ram taught us you can't read the Bible like a newspaper it takes the Holy Spirit to understand the Bible and its Revelations there's lots of chapters in the Bible that are not chronological for example Joel chapter 1 and 2 in Joel 1 it ends with the great Army that's speaking of the 144,000 Jews then in Joel chapter 2 you have the rapturing faith anointing promised for us which is yet future tense in Joel 2: 23-26 brother Ram tells us that thus sayith the Lord in the church age book and that is actually before the day of Pentecost scriptures in Acts 2:28 through the end of the chapter the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the Lord it is thus saith the Lord for that is what Joel 223 through 26 says be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust have eaten the canker worms and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed God isn't going to plant a new church but is going to bring his original planting back to Original Seed he is doing it as started in verse 23 by the teaching or former Reign next will come the Harvest Reign or rapturing faith so we know God does not put every chapter in chronological order the same is true about Matthew 24 lastly remember there are six reasons the Rapture is pre-tribulation I have this in my 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed I also have a video about this topic but I'm going to go through them very briefly it's on pages 709 through 718 reason one the Great Tribulation is described as trouble for Israel trouble for the foolish virgins and trouble for Sinners but not for the Holy Ghost filled Christian reason number two there's no mention of Christ bride or church in the tribulation text in the Book of Revelation reason number three the bride or true church is specifically promised a pardon from God's Divine wrath and of course the wrath of God is poured out during the tribulation period reason number four the bride or true church is foreshadowed to receive a pardon from God's Divine wrath reason number five Jesus and Paul taught the Rapture was imminent at any unknown day as an approaching Thief while the other views can number or count to the day and six and finally the Rapture is the removal of the grace of God for Gentiles in preparation for the Antichrist public Revelation and God's return to the Jewish people in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God it's so refreshing to revisit important topics of course like the Rapture and revisit all the scriptures and quotes from God's Prophet brother William brandham telling us that it's a pre-tribulation Rapture again I found it surprising that this summer The Bible that I use most often the scopio Bible was being attacked the Bible our Prophet used was being attacked and of course the pre-tribulation Rapture Revelation was of being attacked of course this man John Rich probably has good intentions it seems like Tucker Carlson has good intentions as well but as we've heard before they're probably just sincere but sincerely wrong remember the Bible calls the Rapture a mystery in 1 Corinthians 15:51 so that means if someone doesn't understand this doesn't mean they're lost doesn't mean they're going to hell the revelation of the Mysteries belong to God's true children who are baptized with the Holy Ghost as Deuteronomy 29:29 plainly proves Revelation 10:7 Matthew 13 Jesus said the Mysteries are given to you they're given to the humble those that become like babes so we Rejoice that the mysteries of God have been finished that's what my 2021 book was about if brother BR fulfilled Revelation 10:7 which we know he did then every Bible defined mystery has to be finished or revealed and they are by the grace of God I thought about doing a entire video on brother Ram's quotes about scoffield and scoffield Bible so if you'd like more information about that let me know if you'd like to see that video let me know by the grace of God praise God that the Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon we don't know know the day or the hour but we're told that we'll know the season according to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 so we want to be ready we want to be watching and praying as Jesus command and we'll be ready to meet the Lord Jesus in the air if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
