========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show the four Bible guidelines for modest clothing the clothing you wear is very important to God in the Holy Bible St Paul commanded Christian women in the New Testament to wear modest clothing in 1 Timothy 2:9 in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety modest clothing is not a suggestion it is a Bible command for both men and women as we'll see later in this video the dictionary definition of modest can be expressed as not revealing or emphasizing the figure and dress ing to avoid indecency especially to avoid sexual attention to summarize modest clothing that God desires based upon the Bible We Believe Christians today should wear clothes that fully cover the breasts belly loins thighs and legs at all times the breasts belly loins thighs and legs are all body areas considered nakedness in the sight of God according to Isaiah 47 1-3 and Genesis 3: 71 and 21 the four Bible guidelines we will present help ensure that Christians will be modestly dressed covering all nakedness if they obey the Bible's teaching the four Bible guidelines the first Bible guideline is we should wear clothes that cover areas that God considers nakedness the following scriptures teach this guideline Genesis 37 and 21 Isaiah 47: 1 through3 the Bible teaches that Adam and Eve were both naked without clothes before sin entered the world as soon as they partook of the forbidden fruit it caused them to sew fig leaves together to to make aprons which were loin coverings the loins refer to the reproductive parts around the area of the hips loins are nakedness in Hebrew the word apron means loin covering Genesis 3:7 and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons but once the voice of God came walking in the garden and acknowledged Adam and Eve's sin God made coats of skins to fully cover more of their nakedness Genesis 3: 21 unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them we learn that God covered the nakedness of Adam and Eve with more clothing than Adam and Eve have chosen for themselves God's ideas about modesty are always better than man's ideas as we will see God usually asks humans to wear more clothing than they think they need we know this because the word coat means a long shirt-like garment like a tunic that covers from the breast down to nearly the feet Adam and Eve at first chose to cover only the loins the hip area with the reproductive parts but God chose to cover nearly the entire body including the breasts belly or abdomen thighs and legs in Isaiah 47: 1-3 Isaiah told the virgin daughter of Babylon or the people in the city of Babylon that God would allow their nakedness to be uncovered which included bare legs and uncovered thighs legs and thighs are nakedness so we learn from God's holy word that men and women should cover their breasts belly or abdomen loins thighs and legs with clothes because any of these body areas left uncovered are nakedness in the eyes of God the second Bible guideline is wear one layer of thick clothing material or wear multiple layers of clothing the following scriptures teach this guideline Genesis 3:21 Matthew 5:40 and John 21:7 in Genesis 3: 21 we learn that God clothed Adam and Eve with coats of skins these skins were probably lamb skins because we believe the first animal sacrifices on Earth which were done by God himself would have most likely been Lambs as a foreshadowing of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ who is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world according to John 1: 29 lambskin clothing would be very thick this clothing would not reveal the form of the body making it very modest clothing an easy example of the thickness of this type of clothing is to picture in your mind shearling or sheep skin boots God wanted thick clothing that did not reveal the form of the body as you read later in the Bible you will find Jesus talking about layers of clothing in Matthew 5:40 as he spoke about coats and cloaks Matthew 5:40 shows that God desired either one thick layer of clothing or multiple layers of thin clothing probably to accommodate the different weather patterns on the earth the Greek word for coat means a tunic an undergarment usually worn next to the skin the coats Jesus spoke of were thin shirt-like garments like tunics worn next to the skin these coats were the undergarment layer like underwear today but with much more cloth or material than our modern day underwear because it was like a very long t-shirt the cloak was the outer garment or outside garment worn on top of the tunic or coat undergarment another word for cloak is robe which is like the Scarlet robe the Roman soldiers put on Jesus in Matthew 27:28 this robe or cloak was an outer garment usually worn over the tunic the Greek word for cloak means the upper garment the cloak or mantle it is important to note here that God considered a person to be naked when they took off their outer garment or their cloak or Robee if the outer garment was taken off then the person would be viewed in only their thin undergarment clothing this guideline is seen in numerous places in the Bible but most easily seen in John 21:7 therefore that disciple whom Jesus loves saith unto Peter it is the Lord now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he GED his father's coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea the Greek word for coat means an upper garment a frock which fishermen use to wear at their work the Greek word for naked means clad in undergarments only the outer garments or cloak being laid aside notice that Peter had his outer garment off the Fisher's coat and the Bible recorded Peter as being naked the way to apply this today is for us to be sure we have at least two layers of clothing on or have one thick layer of clothing on and abstain from walking around in our underwear in public this would include not walking around in public or even appearing in public beaches in bathing suits as most bathing suits and shorts only have one layer of thin clothing which is certainly immodest according to the Bible swimsuits almost always reveal the form of the body which is immodest and almost always expose areas of the body that God considers nakedness the third Bible guideline is wear clothing that pertains to your gender if you're a man you should wear men's clothing if you're a woman you should wear women's clothing the following scriptures teach on this guideline Deuteronomy 22:5 and Hebrews 4:15 the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all though that do so are an Abomination unto the Lord thy God God this is an Old Testament scripture but you must recall that Jesus never crossdressed like a woman we come to this conclusion because the Bible teaches Jesus never broke one commandment in the Old Testament and crossdressing was strictly forbidden in the law of Moses in the Old Testament for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin furthermore this means Jesus instituted the New Testament and the kingdom of God upon this Earth while upholding the truth that men and women should dress different with separate clothing separate clothing for men and women is a teaching we must follow in the New Testament because Jesus modeled and lived this standard before us when he brought out the New Testament these scriptures prove that God-fearing obedient Jewish men and women had separate inner and outer garments in the day days of Jesus Jesus was one of those God-fearing obedient followers of the law of Moses in the days of Jesus men and women could be easily differentiated visually just by looking at their outer clothing this is the way God wanted his Society to operate a society with defined god-given roles easily determined by gender and outer clothing when gender and clothing becomes hard to determine a state of confusion occurs which is a state of Babel and God is not the author of confusion according to 1 Corinthians 14:33 in society today we believe men should wear shirts and pants and women should wear long dresses or blouses and long skirts today's American society is quickly becoming a complete and total perversion of God God's standard for separate clothing for the entire history of our country the majority of men and women obeyed the Bible guideline of separate clothing for men and women it wasn't until the 1970s that it became socially acceptable for women to wear pants please watch the video long dresses in the Bible for an in-depth study into these facts the fourth and final Bible guideline is we should wear clothes on earth like Jesus wears in heaven which are loose long and flowing clothes the following scriptures that teach this guideline are Revelation 13 Revelation 79 and14 and Luke 11:2 in Revelation chapter 1: 13 St John the disciple whom Jesus loved saw a vision of Jesus in his glorified body as Supreme deity Jesus was clothed in a garment down to the foot and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the paps with a golden girdle notice that Jesus was not showing off toned muscular arms abs legs and thighs like many people do today he was not showing off any body part Jesus was clothed in a modest way if Jesus Christ chooses to gladly wear modest clothing in heaven that covers his body all the way down to his ankles then we want to lovingly follow his example here on Earth and wear clothes down to our feet today Jesus taught us to pray and say let it be done on Earth as it is in heaven when we wear modest clothes that cover our bodies even down to our ankles we are letting the clothing style of Heaven come down to earth Jesus is the great Shepherd according to Hebrews 13: 20 he leads the way for the sheep to follow Jesus as a man models complete modesty and Holiness in the clothing he wears this means that all men and women today should follow in the example Jesus left and we modest clothing at all times in our opinion that's the real Measure of a Man he leads the way for modesty for Holiness in every aspect of his life he does not ask the women to do something that he does not do himself if we read further in the Book of Revelation we find that all Christians that are washed in the blood of Jesus will wear white robes in heaven and these robes extend to the feet and I said unto him sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which came out of Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in in the blood of the Lamb if we are going to spend all eternity with modest robes that cover our bodies according to the command and design of God himself then we're happy to start wearing the same type of modest clothing right now the Greek word for robes means a loose outer garment for men extending to the feet so this scripture provides yet another witness that we must seek to cover as much of our bodies as possible whether we are male or female in closing we pray that your prayer will be something like this Lord help me to dress modestly since it is your New Testament Bible command forgive me of dressing immodestly I want to change my life completely I want to please you in everything making my body a living sacrifice for you perfecting Holiness in the fear of God I love you dear Jesus and I know that without Holiness no man shall see you because you're the Lord I want your Bible to be my guideline for how I dress I will not look to Hollywood or anyone else for my standard I will look to Jesus and his example as taught through the Holy Bible if you would like more Bible teaching about modest clothing and also more historical references about the changes in clothing in the United States please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
