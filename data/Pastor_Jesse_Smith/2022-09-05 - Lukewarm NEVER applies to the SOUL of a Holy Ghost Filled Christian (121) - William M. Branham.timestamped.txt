[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the name above all
[0:10] names the lord jesus christ
[0:12] the purpose of this video is to prove by
[0:15] the bible that the lukewarm condition
[0:17] jesus warned about in revelation 3 verse
[0:20] 16
[0:21] never applies to the soul
[0:24] of the holy ghost filled born again
[0:26] christian
[0:28] the origin of this video was last year
[0:30] in 2021 we had a guest minister who
[0:32] preached a wonderful sermon
[0:34] and ended the sermon by sharing quotes
[0:36] about lukewarmness from god's prophet
[0:38] brother branham
[0:40] as i was invited back to the pulpit the
[0:42] scripture of first john 3 verse 9 struck
[0:45] my heart
[0:46] it says whosoever is born of god doth
[0:48] not commit sin for his seed remaineth in
[0:51] him and he cannot sin because he is born
[0:54] of god
[0:55] so as i came to the pulpit i shared the
[0:58] scripture with the church to encourage
[1:00] them and let them know if they were born
[1:01] again
[1:02] their soul could never be lukewarm
[1:05] because the soul that is born again
[1:07] has god's nature in it
[1:09] and god's nature is god's holy spirit
[1:12] and god's holy spirit is eternal life
[1:15] so the soul of a born-again christian
[1:17] will be perpetually on fire or
[1:20] perpetually in revival as we talk
[1:22] recently in the youtube video about the
[1:24] four kinds of revival god's prophet
[1:26] brother branham taught us
[1:28] so in this video i'm going to rehearse
[1:29] the highlights from that sermon it was
[1:31] preached on august 1st 2021
[1:34] my opening texts were revelation 3 16
[1:38] which is jesus's warning to the
[1:40] laodicean church age to not be lukewarm
[1:43] or cold but to be hot
[1:45] i also use luke 3 verse 16
[1:48] which is where john the baptist promised
[1:49] that jesus was baptized with the holy
[1:52] ghost and with fire
[1:54] so i emphasize that word fire because it
[1:56] related to the hot condition
[1:58] jesus promised that believers could live
[2:00] in in revelation 3 verse 16.
[2:04] and then i read acts chapter 2 verses 3
[2:06] and 4 where the holy ghost fell on the
[2:08] day of pentecost and it appeared as fire
[2:10] over the heads of the 120 believers in
[2:12] the upper room
[2:14] so i use these scriptures to show that a
[2:15] born-again christian
[2:17] who has the same baptism of the holy
[2:19] ghost experience today like they had on
[2:21] the day of pentecost
[2:22] has the fire of god in their souls and
[2:25] so their souls can never be lukewarm
[2:27] and then i also mentioned the book of
[2:29] john chapter 14 verse 16 where jesus
[2:32] said i will pray the father and he shall
[2:34] give you another comforter that he may
[2:36] abide with you forever
[2:38] and of course this comforter was the
[2:39] baptism of the holy ghost represented as
[2:42] that lick of fire or pillar of fire that
[2:44] fell in the day of pentecost
[2:46] and so the holy ghost fire would abide
[2:48] with believers forever and where would
[2:50] he abide in their souls of course
[2:54] so from those texts that i used we saw
[2:56] jesus sent the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:58] so his fire would abide in their souls
[3:00] forever
[3:02] making holy ghost filled believers his
[3:04] mouthpiece
[3:05] remember jesus promised in revelation
[3:07] chapter 3
[3:09] that he would not speak through the
[3:10] lukewarm group because he would spew
[3:12] them out of his mouth
[3:14] so the only ones today that truly speak
[3:16] for the lord jesus christ are his
[3:18] born-again holy ghost-filled believers
[3:21] which we call the bride of jesus christ
[3:23] or the wise virgin group
[3:26] now next in my sermon i place the
[3:28] lukewarm group among other bible groups
[3:32] that jesus christ taught about and also
[3:34] that god's prophet brother branham
[3:35] highlighted
[3:37] so in revelation 3 verse 16 jesus
[3:39] listed three conditions hot lukewarm and
[3:42] cold
[3:43] the lukewarm do not speak for jesus and
[3:46] of course the cold do not either
[3:48] so the spewed out lukewarm group
[3:50] reminds us of isaiah 28 verses 1 through
[3:53] 13.
[3:55] in isaiah 28 we see the group is
[3:57] judgment bound verse
[3:59] and these israelis were crowned with
[4:01] pride and drunkenness verses 1 and 3.
[4:04] their priests and prophets who were
[4:06] supposed to be mouthpieces had no vision
[4:10] and no judgment according to verse 7
[4:12] and their worship was likened unto vomit
[4:14] filthiness and uncleanness as verse 8
[4:17] says
[4:18] and that vomit condition is connected to
[4:20] revelation 3 verse 16 because the
[4:22] lukewarm church is spewed out of jesus's
[4:24] mouth
[4:25] they do not speak for jesus christ
[4:28] this lukewarm condition
[4:30] in isaiah 28 also foretold the pharisees
[4:33] in their ultimate rejection of pentecost
[4:35] according to verse 11 and then first
[4:37] corinthians 14 verse 21
[4:41] so here's a visual you can see on your
[4:43] screen
[4:44] and you'll see the three conditions
[4:45] jesus described hot lukewarm and cold
[4:48] notice under hot they speak for god
[4:51] the lukewarm group is rejected from
[4:52] speaking for god and the cold has no
[4:55] connection to god
[4:58] now this chart should remind us of the
[5:00] three kinds of believers
[5:02] sermon brother branham preached which is
[5:04] true
[5:05] but in the church age book
[5:06] and other sermons brother graham spoke
[5:09] of another class of believers as he also
[5:11] spoke of four crosses that were present
[5:14] at the time of jesus persecution
[5:17] now although this is mysterious all
[5:19] these statements from brother branham
[5:21] fit together with the bible
[5:23] remember god hides these truths from the
[5:25] wise and prudent but reveals them unto
[5:27] babes such as would learn the reason
[5:29] this subject is mysterious is because
[5:31] it's about the kingdom of heaven and the
[5:33] kingdom of heaven is a mystery according
[5:34] to jesus christ matthew chapter 13. now
[5:38] in the church age book chapter 7 brother
[5:40] branham said there is another class
[5:43] brother ram said quote secondly there is
[5:45] another class their names are also in
[5:47] the book of life and they will come up
[5:49] in the second resurrection
[5:51] such are the foolish virgins and the
[5:52] righteous as are spoken of in matthew 25
[5:55] end quote
[5:58] based upon that quote now i'm going to
[5:59] show you another visual at the top here
[6:01] we see now four columns or four groups
[6:04] there's hot two groups that are lukewarm
[6:07] and one group that is cold
[6:09] so let's look under hop the first group
[6:11] is hot they speak for god no doubt
[6:13] they're saved
[6:14] and the example from jesus day would
[6:16] have been peter after he got the holy
[6:17] ghost he would have been in the hot
[6:19] group now let's go to the first lukewarm
[6:21] group
[6:22] the second group from the left
[6:24] this lukewarm group was rejected from
[6:26] speaking for god
[6:28] yet they were saved and one example from
[6:30] jesus's lifetime was the saved thief on
[6:33] the cross
[6:34] he was scarcely saved as peter also
[6:36] wrote in his epistle
[6:38] the second lukewarm group or second from
[6:41] the right
[6:42] they spurn god's mercy
[6:44] and they're rejected from speaking for
[6:46] god
[6:47] they are also lost
[6:48] and
[6:49] the person from jesus day who
[6:51] signified this group was judas iscariot
[6:54] the fourth and final column is the far
[6:56] one on the right this is the coal group
[6:58] jesus spoke of
[7:00] this group had no connection to god they
[7:01] were lost and an example from jesus day
[7:04] was the government leader named pilate
[7:08] friends this chart might surprise some
[7:10] but be assured brother branham has
[7:12] quotes
[7:13] saying both of these groups are in the
[7:14] lukewarm group which i'll read now
[7:18] in testimony 1950 in cleveland ohio
[7:20] brother ram said quote and you
[7:21] christians don't stay in that lukewarm
[7:23] condition anymore
[7:25] lay aside everything just get as close
[7:26] to god as you can end quote so here
[7:30] brother ram says christians can be
[7:31] lukewarm
[7:33] then in the church age book
[7:35] chapter 9 brother branham said the false
[7:38] church was a lukewarm group
[7:40] quote in verses 15 to 18 which we have
[7:43] just studied
[7:44] lies the true picture of the ripe and
[7:46] false vine false spirit false church
[7:48] people
[7:49] so then because they are lukewarm and
[7:51] neither cold nor hot i will spew thee
[7:53] out of my mouth end quote
[7:55] so you hear the lukewarm church is proud
[7:58] arrogant this is the false church
[8:01] here's another quote where brother ram
[8:02] said the foolish virgin is lukewarm
[8:04] from 1953 israel in the church part
[8:07] three
[8:07] quote and to you you lukewarm church
[8:10] member that you're trying to impersonate
[8:11] christianity one of these days you're
[8:13] going to try to follow that holy ghost
[8:14] band and you'll find out your wheels
[8:16] will come off out yonder in the muddy
[8:18] somewhere there was ten virgins went to
[8:20] meet the lord five of them were wise and
[8:22] five foolish put oil in your lamp trim
[8:25] her bright one of these days they're
[8:27] going up and there was weeping and
[8:28] wailing and gnashing of teeth end quote
[8:31] so brother brown warned the lukewarm
[8:34] christians
[8:35] to get oil to be born again with the
[8:37] baptism of the holy ghost before it's
[8:39] too late
[8:40] what's interesting is that brother
[8:41] random also used lot from the old
[8:43] testament abraham's nephew
[8:46] he used lot most often to express
[8:48] lukewarmness here's one example jesus
[8:50] christ is saying yesterday today and
[8:51] forever 1963 quote he came down there
[8:55] was lot down in sodom the lukewarm
[8:57] church member half backslidden
[8:59] and immediately after a lot came out the
[9:01] lukewarm left the city then fire
[9:03] destroyed the place end quote
[9:06] of course lot was saved the book of 2nd
[9:09] peter chapter 2 said he was a righteous
[9:11] man
[9:13] here's a wonderful quote that really
[9:14] blessed my heart where brother graham
[9:16] talked about
[9:17] a holy ghost-filled christian that will
[9:19] by no means be a lukewarm so i'm going
[9:22] to read this it's from god's provided
[9:24] place of worship 1965
[9:26] quote now we've already resurrected the
[9:28] dynamics and the mechanics has gone to
[9:30] work quickened us and we're quickened up
[9:32] into the presence of god where his
[9:34] spirit is and now we are sealed together
[9:36] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[9:38] sitting in there that great seat that's
[9:40] already fired up been raised from the
[9:42] dead we're a part of it if you're a part
[9:45] of the bride you are because the bride
[9:47] is part of the groom you know so we find
[9:49] out that it's the same thing and she'll
[9:51] do exactly what's predicted for her to
[9:53] do in this day
[9:54] she won't be a laodicean not by no means
[9:57] a lukewarm she'll be on fire for god
[9:59] she'll be moving on in the spirit of god
[10:02] so here brother brown gives a beautiful
[10:03] description of a believer who's born
[10:05] again baptized with the holy ghost and
[10:08] notice the word he used quicken we get
[10:10] that from ephesians chapter two we were
[10:12] dead in sins and trespasses but jesus
[10:15] hath quickened us
[10:17] he's given us eternal life he's given us
[10:19] the seal of the holy ghost he's made us
[10:21] hot he's put his spiritual seed in our
[10:24] souls the nature of god eternal life the
[10:26] fire of god
[10:28] now let's move on to some bible teaching
[10:30] here about the lukewarm state
[10:32] the greek word for lukewarm is only used
[10:34] one time in the entire new testament
[10:36] revelation 3 16.
[10:38] the greek word for hot is only used
[10:40] three times
[10:41] and all three are in the passage of
[10:43] revelation 3 verses 15 to 16.
[10:46] the greek definition of hot gives us
[10:48] some spiritual clues to this divine
[10:50] connection
[10:51] it deals with enthusiasm zeal and desire
[10:56] so a hot christian or holy ghost-filled
[10:58] christian will be zealous for the word
[11:00] of god
[11:01] another way brother bam described it was
[11:03] knowing the truth and living the truth
[11:07] the greek word for lukewarm means tepid
[11:09] or lacking conviction
[11:11] lacking enthusiasm neglectful insulting
[11:14] or rude
[11:16] and of course the word cold would mean
[11:18] chilly towards god
[11:20] or separated from god or despising god
[11:23] next in this bible teaching let's
[11:25] remember first thessalonians 5 23 which
[11:28] says
[11:29] every person every human has a body
[11:32] human spirit and soul
[11:34] now with that thought in mind let's
[11:36] consider
[11:37] the three states
[11:39] that jesus spoke of in revelation 3
[11:41] verse 16
[11:43] hot lukewarm and cold
[11:46] what's interesting is that all three of
[11:47] these states apply to the three states
[11:50] of every human being
[11:51] and of course we're talking about a holy
[11:53] ghost-filled christian
[11:54] so let me explain
[11:56] the soul of the holy ghost filled
[11:58] christian is always hot because the soul
[12:00] has god's holy ghost fire baptism
[12:03] according to luke 3 16 acts 2 verses 3
[12:06] and 4 and also acts 1 verse
[12:09] and inside the soul is the seed word of
[12:12] god according to first john 3 verse 9
[12:15] and that seed cannot sin
[12:18] because it is the life of god
[12:20] it is a part of god
[12:22] it is god's own life it is eternal life
[12:26] now the human spirit or mind of a holy
[12:28] ghost-filled christian can be lukewarm
[12:30] at times it can even be cold at times
[12:33] so the bible never calls our minds
[12:35] specifically lukewarm since that was
[12:37] only used once but
[12:38] hebrews 12 3 says we get weary or sick
[12:42] and faint in our minds and our minds
[12:45] need transformed daily
[12:47] as paul said in romans chapter 12
[12:50] and paul said he hated the things he did
[12:52] at times
[12:53] according to romans chapter 7 and then
[12:55] he also called himself wretched or an
[12:57] afflicted man at times
[13:00] and even said his carnal mind was enmity
[13:02] against god at times in romans 8 verse
[13:04] 7. so as holy ghost-filled christians we
[13:07] can still be
[13:08] convicted by jesus's preaching about
[13:10] being lukewarm but we know that lukewarm
[13:12] condition will only be in our human
[13:14] minds
[13:15] or human spirits
[13:17] and if we have the baptism of the holy
[13:19] ghost in our soul we've already passed
[13:20] from death unto life and we can never
[13:22] come into condemnation
[13:24] getting back to the human body
[13:26] the human body or flesh
[13:28] is usually cold on god because paul says
[13:31] it's a body of death in romans 7 verse
[13:34] 24 but of course there are times the
[13:36] holy ghost anoints our bodies where
[13:38] we're happy we're shouting we're joyful
[13:40] we're weeping we're crying and the holy
[13:43] ghost anointing that was in our soul
[13:45] overflows into our human mind and then
[13:47] that anointing can overflow onto our
[13:49] bodies as well
[13:50] but most of the time our human body is
[13:52] cold towards the things of god
[13:55] now these bible scriptures are true and
[13:57] it also
[13:58] relates to what brother branham said
[13:59] because in 1957 and god keeps his word
[14:02] part one
[14:03] brother ram said quote listen brother
[14:05] you're never saved by any sign you're
[14:07] never saved by any sensation you are
[14:09] saved when you meet god's condition of
[14:11] his word and nothing else are you saved
[14:12] by that's right god's word has made a
[14:15] way you're not saved because you feel
[14:17] like you're saved i'm not saved because
[14:19] i feel like i'm saved because a lot of
[14:20] times i don't feel that way but i'm
[14:23] saved because god gave me the promise i
[14:25] met god's conditions and upon god's holy
[14:28] word i can defeat satan seven days in a
[14:30] week and as many nights because it's
[14:32] god's word end quote
[14:34] and then brother branham quoted john
[14:35] chapter 5 verse 24 that says verily
[14:38] verily i say unto you he that heareth my
[14:40] word and believeth on him that sent me
[14:41] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[14:43] into condemnation but is passed from
[14:46] death into life
[14:47] i love this quote from brother branham
[14:48] friends because it shows brother branham
[14:50] had three parts to his being he was
[14:52] human just like all of us
[14:54] he said many times i don't even feel
[14:56] saved
[14:57] well that statement fits perfectly
[14:59] with the chart i'd already showed that
[15:01] says believers have all three conditions
[15:03] in their bodies usually
[15:05] holy ghost-filled believers are hot in
[15:06] their soul but they can even be cold or
[15:09] lukewarm in their minds
[15:10] if they're not meditating on the things
[15:12] of god and they've got to restore that
[15:14] or renew that zeal or passion in their
[15:16] minds every single day and many times
[15:19] their bodies will be called on god as
[15:20] well
[15:22] so we cannot trust our feelings we must
[15:25] believe the word and the revelation of
[15:27] the word in our souls and then we must
[15:29] stir up our minds when our minds don't
[15:31] feel hot for jesus
[15:34] so the goal of the holy ghostbuild
[15:35] christian is to have both the soul and
[15:37] the human spirit hot and of course the
[15:39] soul will be hot until the day of our
[15:41] redemption according to ephesians 4 30
[15:44] we have to renew the mind every single
[15:46] day and keep it hot or stirred up
[15:49] or zealous for the things of god
[15:52] getting back to the word hot in the
[15:54] greek for revelation 3 verse 16 it means
[15:57] boiling hot metaphorically of fervor of
[16:00] mind and zeal
[16:02] and so we see the holy ghost-filled
[16:03] saints in the new testament had this hot
[16:06] experience acts 4 verse 31 when the holy
[16:09] ghost fell in the prayer meeting the
[16:11] bible said they were all filled with the
[16:12] holy ghost they spake the word of god
[16:14] with boldness that word boldness is the
[16:16] same word for heart
[16:18] ephesians 6 verses 19 and 20
[16:21] paul said pray for me that i may open my
[16:23] mouth boldly there's the word for hot
[16:25] the same greek word
[16:27] and then in verse 20 that
[16:28] that there and i may speak boldly as i
[16:30] ought to speak that i may speak hot as i
[16:33] ought to speak
[16:35] there's many other verses friends that
[16:37] use this word hot first corinthians 12
[16:39] 31 but covet earnestly the best gifts
[16:42] first corinthians 14 1 follow after
[16:44] charity and desire spiritual gifts
[16:48] revelation 3 19 as many as i love i
[16:50] rebuke and chasten be zealous there's
[16:52] the fire again
[16:53] be on fire therefore and repent
[16:57] and there's many many more scriptures
[17:00] and there's many more scriptures about
[17:01] being fervent in the spirit acts 18 25
[17:04] fervent in the spirit romans 12 verse 11
[17:07] always laboring fervently for you in
[17:10] prayers colossians 4 verse 12.
[17:13] love one another with a pure heart
[17:14] fervently first peter 1 22
[17:17] first peter 4 8 and above all things
[17:19] have fervent or hot charity
[17:22] if god's holy fire is in my soul
[17:25] as a seal can it ever become lukewarm
[17:31] scripture says no
[17:33] scripture says
[17:34] if my soul is sealed with the holy ghost
[17:36] i'm hopped
[17:38] and of course that's first john 3 9 and
[17:40] 10 whosoever is born of god doth not
[17:42] commit sin for his seed remaineth in him
[17:45] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[17:47] god in this the children of god are
[17:50] manifest and the children of the devil
[17:52] whosoever doeth not righteousness is not
[17:54] of god neither he that loveth not his
[17:56] brother
[17:57] so here is absolute bible proof that our
[17:59] souls cannot be lukewarm once the seed
[18:02] of god has been quickened in our soul
[18:06] the seed of god cannot sin
[18:08] notice friends
[18:10] the holy ghost filled bride of jesus
[18:11] christ is the mouthpiece of god
[18:15] the bride is the mouthpiece through the
[18:17] holy spirit and the bible says the spear
[18:19] and the bride say come
[18:21] come to jesus christ come to the living
[18:23] waters of life in other words come to
[18:25] the baptism of the holy ghost so there's
[18:28] only one group on the earth today that's
[18:30] giving that invitation for the living
[18:31] waters and that's the holy ghost-filled
[18:33] bride of jesus christ
[18:35] churches who are not born again
[18:37] including denominational and messed
[18:39] churches are no longer the mouthpiece of
[18:41] god
[18:42] because they're lukewarm they're not
[18:44] born again
[18:45] only born-again churches can be the
[18:47] mouthpiece of jesus christ today because
[18:49] they're the only ones that are hot
[18:51] they're the only ones that are on fire
[18:53] for the gospel of jesus christ before
[18:56] finishing up this video i just want to
[18:58] give a prophet's description
[19:00] as brother ram differentiated between
[19:02] the hot church and the lukewarm church
[19:04] in his sermon from 1960 december the
[19:07] laodicean church age
[19:09] brother branham said
[19:11] chile services or lukewarm services will
[19:13] drive the true believer to the red hot
[19:15] services
[19:17] next he said services that show
[19:19] enthusiasm once in a while
[19:22] are lukewarm
[19:23] because they're only enthusiastic for
[19:25] the music
[19:27] so we must be enthusiastic for every
[19:29] part of the service prayer and the word
[19:31] of god
[19:32] he said in lukewarm churches there's no
[19:34] warmth of the holy ghost he said there
[19:36] is no burden for lost souls
[19:39] he says their lives are loaded down with
[19:41] worldly events causing them lukewarmness
[19:44] he said the lukewarm church is a
[19:45] business everyone has to be paid and
[19:48] complains if they're not paid
[19:50] the song leader or the musician or the
[19:52] preachers they complain if they're not
[19:53] paid
[19:54] he said lukewarm churches are concerned
[19:56] about the size of the crowd
[19:59] he said lukewarm churches are concerned
[20:00] more about the physical condition of the
[20:02] church more than the move of the holy
[20:04] ghost or the spiritual condition of the
[20:06] church
[20:07] brother graham said in lukewarm churches
[20:10] the people are afraid to say amen during
[20:12] the service
[20:13] and don't like when people act drunk in
[20:15] the spirit
[20:17] and lastly he said
[20:18] lukewarm churches have people that are
[20:20] afraid of the manifestation of gifts in
[20:22] their lives
[20:23] due to their fears about what others
[20:25] will think of them
[20:27] so friends we've been warned by jesus
[20:28] christ and god's prophet of this day
[20:30] brother william branham let's do
[20:32] everything in our power by the grace of
[20:34] god to be the hot on fire church
[20:38] in closing
[20:39] hope this video has been a blessing
[20:41] friends as i said at the beginning the
[20:43] origin of this video was a special day
[20:45] for me i i was rejoicing in the sermon
[20:47] that i heard and then that scriptural
[20:49] revelation of first john 3 verse 9 came
[20:51] to me as i walked up to the pulpit
[20:54] it was such a memorable time in the lord
[20:56] and then the lord inspired me to go
[20:57] through all these scriptures and preach
[20:59] this sermon to our local church here
[21:01] giving them the consolation that if
[21:03] their soul is born again their soul is
[21:05] always going to be hot for jesus christ
[21:08] because that seal or that hotness or
[21:10] that fire that oil lasts until the day
[21:12] of redemption
[21:14] but we've got a big job to do in our
[21:15] human minds our human spirits and our
[21:18] bodies
[21:19] to stir them up daily the bible says be
[21:21] renewed in the spirit of your mind day
[21:23] by day
[21:24] second corinthians 4 verse 16
[21:27] and the bible says
[21:28] transform your mind by the renewing of
[21:30] the holy ghost in romans 12 verses 1 and
[21:32] 2.
[21:33] how do we do that as paul said in first
[21:35] corinthians 15 die daily
[21:38] may god grant to you and to me
[21:40] and our home churches that will be hot
[21:43] on fire for jesus christ that we will
[21:45] continue to be the mouthpiece of jesus
[21:47] christ on this earth speaking what the
[21:49] spirit says
[21:51] inviting others to come and drink of the
[21:53] waters of life freely and as brother
[21:55] brahm said in the church age book the
[21:56] spirit the prophet and the bride will
[21:58] all be saying the same thing and what
[22:00] they're saying has already been said in
[22:02] the bible
[22:04] so we thank the lord jesus christ for
[22:05] the bible the absolute of the holy
[22:07] scriptures and the absolute of his holy
[22:09] ghost
[22:10] inspiring us through the holy scriptures
[22:14] if you have any questions concerns or
[22:16] testimonies about this video please
[22:18] contact me
[22:20] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[22:22] the desire of your heart
