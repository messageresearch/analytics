[0:06] proof number three of the serpent seed
[0:08] is the tree of life was Jesus Christ not
[0:12] a natural tree because there is only one
[0:14] way to eternal
[0:17] life the Tree of Life could not have
[0:20] been a normal fruit bearing tree such as
[0:22] a pear or olive tree for if it was then
[0:25] there would have been a second
[0:27] works-based way to inherit eternal life
[0:30] but we know there is only one way to
[0:32] eternal life and that is through Jesus
[0:34] Christ who said he was the way and the
[0:37] life the only way to eternal life
[0:40] according to Jesus Christ himself he is
[0:42] the life the bread of life with the
[0:45] words of eternal life there is only one
[0:48] way to eternal life through Christ the
[0:51] person of Life there cannot be numerous
[0:54] ways to receiving eternal life if the
[0:56] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was
[0:58] just a literal tree with literal apples
[1:00] and so was the tree of life just a
[1:02] literal tree with literal fruit then
[1:04] that means one could have received
[1:05] eternal life by eating literal fruit we
[1:08] do not believe one could receive eternal
[1:09] life by eating a literal fruit because
[1:12] God never saved anyone by using that
[1:14] physical method but we believe one could
[1:17] receive eternal life by the same way God
[1:19] has always offered it spiritually
[1:21] receiving it by grace through faith in
[1:24] God's Plan of Salvation most people then
[1:27] believe that there are two ways to
[1:28] receive eternal life in the the Bible
[1:30] Way number one is by faith through Grace
[1:33] in the finished work of God's salvation
[1:35] plan or spiritually speaking we must be
[1:38] partakers of Jesus Christ who is our
[1:42] life way number two a literal Tree of
[1:45] Life In the Garden of Eden with literal
[1:47] fruit without a doubt way number one is
[1:50] the first and only way men have ever
[1:53] been able to receive eternal life way
[1:55] number two involves a physical
[1:57] works-based path to Salvation
[2:00] but way number one is a spiritual path
[2:03] since God is unchanging we believe the
[2:05] tree of life was a spiritual tree and
[2:07] not a literal tree that had literal
[2:09] fruit Jesus was and is the Tree of Life
[2:13] as Jesus said he is the way the only way
[2:16] to eternal life and that has not changed
[2:18] he is the same yesterday today and
[2:21] forever and if Christ was and is the
[2:23] tree of life then Satan or Lucifer was
[2:26] and is the tree of the knowledge of Good
[2:28] and Evil eternal life is in the sun it
[2:31] is found nowhere else so it could not
[2:33] have been in a literal
[2:37] tree proof number four of the serpent
[2:39] seed is the serpent seed explains the
[2:42] purpose of the Virgin birth of Jesus
[2:46] Christ have you ever wondered why Jesus
[2:48] Christ had to be born of a virgin the
[2:50] doctrine of the serpent seed which God
[2:53] himself originated in Genesis 3:15
[2:55] reveals the mystery of the Virgin birth
[2:57] of Jesus Christ since the fall of
[2:59] mankind came by sex the Redemption of
[3:03] mankind could only come without
[3:08] sex the purpose of the Virgin birth of
[3:10] Jesus Christ was for God to start a new
[3:13] race of humans the Born Again Holy Ghost
[3:16] filled Christians because the original
[3:18] race had been corrupted or perverted
[3:20] through the seed of the serpent because
[3:22] the sex act of adultery was the first
[3:24] fruit of sin in the Bible all men born
[3:27] of women were full of trouble or sin
[3:29] because the sin nature would be passed
[3:31] down to them from their sinful mothers
[3:33] and fathers through a sex act God's lamb
[3:37] his son Jesus Christ had to come to
[3:39] Earth and be born through Virgin birth
[3:41] to bypass the way sin came into the
[3:44] world this is why Jesus could live a
[3:46] sinless life because the sinful nature
[3:49] of man was not passed to him instead the
[3:52] word nature of God passed through to him
[3:55] because he was conceived of the Holy
[3:56] Ghost remember that the Bible said the
[3:59] word was was made
[4:02] flesh can you now see the purpose of the
[4:04] Virgin birth since the fall of mankind
[4:06] came by sex the Redemption of mankind
[4:09] could only come without sex through the
[4:12] Virgin birth of Jesus Christ God was
[4:14] going to begin a new creation or a new
[4:16] race of humans starting with Jesus
[4:18] himself for Jesus said he was the
[4:21] beginning of the creation of God
[4:23] according to Revelation 3:14 St Paul
[4:26] wrote that Jesus was the firstborn among
[4:28] many brethren according to Romans 8:29
[4:31] meaning that Jesus would first
[4:33] experience the filling of the Holy Ghost
[4:35] which he received when the dove
[4:37] descended and remained upon him after
[4:39] his baptism at the River Jordan and then
[4:42] Jesus's many Brethren or Believers would
[4:45] experience the same New Birth that Jesus
[4:47] preached and pointed his followers to
[4:49] receive St Paul would teach that real
[4:51] Christians were new creatures their old
[4:54] habits and sinful lives were passed away
[4:56] because of the new birth the Holy Ghost
[4:59] baptism would give all believers power
[5:01] over Satan's kingdom of darkness Holy
[5:03] Ghost filled Christians would still
[5:05] battle the sin nature inside of them but
[5:07] would not become slaves to sinful habits
[5:10] and continue in a sinful lifestyle
[5:12] because they would have a greater person
[5:13] living inside of them the Holy Ghost
[5:16] true Christians will have holy ghost
[5:18] power to mature in Holiness and perfect
[5:21] Holiness in the fear of God which is the
[5:23] image of his son that we were
[5:25] predestined to be conformed
[5:28] into the power and importance of the
[5:31] Virgin birth is magnified in Revelation
[5:34] 5: 1 to10 as the only one who could open
[5:37] the book of redemption was the only one
[5:39] who came through a womb and was not born
[5:41] of a sexual act the Lord Jesus Christ no
[5:45] man or woman was worthy to loose the
[5:46] Seven Seals because they were all born
[5:48] in sin and shaped in iniquity Moses Noah
[5:52] Elijah Enoch Joseph Jacob and Mary the
[5:56] mother of Jesus were not worthy to
[5:57] redeem mankind only Jesus Christ was
[6:00] worthy the Virgin born son of the Living
[6:04] God Jesus was prophesied to be the
[6:07] woman's seed of Genesis 3:15 that God
[6:10] said would bruise the head of the
[6:11] serpent on Calvary and by doing this the
[6:14] sinless Spotless lamb won the victory
[6:17] over sin For All Mankind past present
[6:20] and
[6:21] future thankfully in the end times the
[6:24] Holy Spirit promised to finish the
[6:25] mystery of God according to Revelation
[6:28] 10:7 and this was to be done through the
[6:30] seventh angel who we believe was brother
[6:32] William brandham part of the mystery of
[6:34] God included the doctrine of the serpent
[6:36] seed the doctrine of the serpent seed
[6:38] does not save anyone for the doctrine of
[6:41] repentance and salvation is what saves
[6:43] people but the serpent Seed doctrine
[6:45] shines more light or Revelation on what
[6:48] we are all trying to see the absolute
[6:50] truth of the Bible and God's glorious
[6:52] Plan of
[6:54] Redemption now that this glorious
[6:56] revelation of the mystery of the Virgin
[6:58] Birth has has been revealed to you and I
[7:01] we can rejoice in the wisdom of God as
[7:03] St Paul did in Romans
[7:05] 11:33 oh the depth of the riches of both
[7:08] the wisdom and knowledge of God how
[7:10] unsearchable are his judgments and his
[7:12] ways past finding
[7:14] out proof number five of the serpent
[7:17] seed is after eating the fruit of sexual
[7:19] relations Adam and Eve covered their
[7:21] loins or private parts did you notice
[7:25] that after eating of the forbidden fruit
[7:27] which we believe was sexual relations
[7:29] Adam and Eve covered their loins or
[7:31] private parts with aprons in shame and
[7:35] the eyes of them both were opened and
[7:37] they knew that they were naked and they
[7:38] sewed fig leaves together and made
[7:40] themselves aprons in the Hebrew
[7:43] concordance the word aprons means loin
[7:45] coverings the loins are the area of the
[7:48] human reproductive parts Eve first ate
[7:51] of the fruit adultery with the serpent
[7:53] and then shared that fruit with Adam
[7:55] meaning she had sexual relations with
[7:57] him after Adam and Eve part took of this
[7:59] fruit both realized they were physically
[8:02] naked because the Bible teaches that
[8:04] whoredoms or disobedient sex acts would
[8:07] lead to the feeling of nakedness in
[8:09] Ezekiel
[8:10] 16:35 to 41 Adam and Eve were so ashamed
[8:14] of their sin that they hid themselves
[8:16] from God in Genesis 3:8 because being
[8:18] naked involves feelings of Shame
[8:21] according to the infallible Bible in
[8:23] Jeremiah 13:26 and 27 and nahm
[8:28] 3:5 We Believe Adam and Eve covered
[8:31] their loins or private parts in shame
[8:33] because those were the body parts they
[8:35] used in the partaking of the fruit Adam
[8:38] and Eve did not cover their mouths or
[8:40] sew hoods to cover their heads for they
[8:43] did not eat a literal Apple but instead
[8:45] they covered their private parts if
[8:47] eating literal apples caused Adam and
[8:49] Eve shame to know they were naked why
[8:52] can't we pass out apples today so that
[8:54] many worldly women will know they are
[8:55] dressed half naked furthermore how can
[8:59] an Apple open your mind to understanding
[9:01] and give you the awareness of the
[9:03] knowledge of Good and Evil and make you
[9:05] feel ashamed and naked eating apples
[9:08] today doesn't do that to people and it
[9:10] did not do that in the days of Adam and
[9:11] Eve but according to the Bible sex acts
[9:14] done in Disobedience and outside of the
[9:16] timing of God's perfect will do bring an
[9:18] awareness of evil and the feelings of
[9:20] Shame and
[9:28] nakedness
