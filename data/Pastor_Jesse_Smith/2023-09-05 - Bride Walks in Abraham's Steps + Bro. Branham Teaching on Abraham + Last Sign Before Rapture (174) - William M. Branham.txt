TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] bride of Christ travels the same Journey that Abraham did greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show how the Bride of Jesus Christ walks in the steps of Abraham our spiritual father of the faith according to the scripture as the Bible says we are the spiritual seed or children of Abraham by faith in Christ Jesus as Galatians 3 talks about we are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus and then Galatians 3 29 says if ye be Christ then you're Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so this video is meant to be an encouragement I'm going to show a lot of scriptures and a lot of quotes from God's Prophet brother Bynum that will help us understand our walk with the Lord because it was all foreshadowed by Abraham's walk with the Lord this video is going to be a summary of a few sermons I preached about Abraham and how we walk in the steps of Our Father Abraham I'll put a link to one of the sermons I preached I was a guest preacher out in Iowa a little over a month ago and I preached this sermon out in Iowa called Walking the steps of Abraham and the Saints were truly blessed and so I thought I'd share some of the highlights to be an encouragement to all the saints by God's grace so let's begin by listening to the quote from Brother Branham from does God change his mind 1965 brother random said Abraham met God in many different forms and then he says the Royal Seed of Abraham travels the same Journey the bride of Christ travels the same Journey that Abraham did includes the last sign that Abraham seen before the promised son came and as we'll see friends Abraham met God in numerous forms beginning with visions and hearing the voice of the Lord later he met God in the body Melchizedek then God met him in a vision God met him as a burning lamp which reminds us of the pillar of fire and then God met Abraham just in a body of a man in Genesis 18 then of course Abraham heard God's voice when he was about to offer up Isaac and God stopped him from that offering as it was just a test of his faith so let's listen to the quote from Brother Bynum now in Abraham's Journey he met God all along in different forms and so forth which you could take it and show it just we are Abraham's seed if we're in Christ and Isaac was really his his lesser son he was his son sexually but spiritually Christ was Abraham's seed his royalty his faith now we find that his royalty is travels the same Journey that's bride of Christ travels the same Journey that Abraham did and the last sign that Abraham seen before the promised son came was when God was manifested in a human body the two angels came down next I want to read Joshua 24 2 at the end of the verse the Bible says even Tara the father of Abraham and the father of nakor and they served other gods so imagine Abraham was an idolater serving other gods before he heard the voice of God which was likely recorded in Genesis chapter 12. so here's a simple chart of Abraham's life in Genesis it goes from Genesis 12 to Genesis 25. and the first thing that I want to point out is that Abraham was called by God likely around the year 1920 BC and this is according to the historian Usher and I get this number from my Scofield bible if you look in the middle reference column in the Scofield bible there's dates and those dates come from the historian Usher so I just want to point out Abraham was called around 1920 BC he wasn't given the circumcision until about 1911 BC so I just think it's a wonderful thing to see that the Bible says in Romans 4 1-10 that Abraham was righteous in the eyes of God before he even had the circumcision the Covenant of circumcision and so it was about nine years from the time Abraham was called by God until he got the Covenant of circumcision and of course the circumcision was like a seal as Abraham was sealed into the promise of God into the Covenant of god so let's first emphasize that God said Abraham was already righteous before he had the token or seal of the circumcision this is encouraging to us because in the New Testament we know the same is true we're already declared righteous we're saved and forgiven even before we received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and of course this is getting into the idea of the three works of Grace and now looking at the chart again you'll see in Genesis 12 is the blue color that represents Abraham's justification or when he was saved or called by God out of idolatry of course that's in type how work called out of our sinful lives of idolatry and other sins into justification by faith and so then the chapters with the greenish color chapter 13 14 15 16 those are the years or the chapters that cover Abraham's sanctification in type of course and it would seem Abraham got the baptism of the Holy Ghost in Genesis 17. but of course that's in type because of the Covenant of circumcision and then the rest of his life he had that token or that seal of the circumcision and I want to play a quote from Brother Branham that backs this interpretation up is from Revelation chapter 4 part 3 January 8th 1961. brother Brenham talks about how Abraham was justified by faith and then he had sanctification and then he says but God to accept his belief speaking of Abraham give him the Seal of circumcision and sealed him and that was a type of Ephesians 4 30. let's listen to the quote notice how beautiful this is here we saw George the other day watch yours here therefore be justified justified by faith all right second place thanks for being Morris sanctified and then build with the Holy Ghost justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost you see it how's his message justification by hearing sanctification is what you do in regards to what you did in appreciation that God sealed you by the Holy Ghost now you my Baptist brother won't ask you something he said what more could Abraham do but believe God and God imputed the end for righteousness that's all he could do right here he believed God but God to accept his belief give him the Seal of circumcision and sealed him showing that God had accepted his faith amen and if you profess faith and God has never been sealed by the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4 30. if you want to put it down Ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed amen and you're not sealed until you ever see the Holy Ghost amen how long does it last till the next Revival on to our Redemption Romans 4 16 says that Abraham is the father of us all in other words we look to Abraham and we see what kind of man he was he was a man of Faith he's the father of faith and so we all pattern Our Lives as New Testament Believers off the faith that we see in Abraham and it truly blessed me looking at Abraham's life with this chart in mind and the quotes from Brother Branham I was so blessed to see how this chart is a lot like my life and probably a lot like your life as well we all have a time where we came into the faith we left our sinful lives we were Justified and then there was a stage of sanctification and then after we're born again the rest of our lives are being born again and we still battle sin we still overcome the wicked one and now I want to point out those red dots those red dots are obvious mistakes Abraham made in his walk with God and yet remember the Bible said he was already righteous before he had the token or seal of circumcision he already had God's favor he was already forgiven he was already a child of God but yet God let him make mistakes learn from his mistakes and grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord such a great encouragement to us let's go chapter by chapter now by the grace of God so in Genesis 12 Abraham is called out of UR to Canaan and then he went to Heron according to acts 7 verses 2 through 4 which was a journey of 600 miles and now we have this thought of Abraham on a journey and we look at our lives we're on a journey serving the lord Jesus Christ whether we travel physical miles or we just go through the battles the spiritual journey of the weeks months and years and decades serving the lord Jesus Christ now notice he took lot and then went to she Jim that was another 400 mile journey and then he went to Bethel for 20 miles and he went down to Egypt for 225 miles and that's where he lied to Pharaoh so his two mistakes in this chapter were that he took lot he was not supposed to take lot because God had told him just to separate himself and then he lied to Pharaoh about Sarah being his wife and notice here's a quote from Brother Branham God told him separate yourself but did Abraham do it no sir brother Graham said God never did bless him until he he did fully obey what God Said do brother Ram said the church will now never go no further until you fully obey what God Said do and this is true we can all think of times when we were saved such a wonderful feeling but do we obey everything of course not we had to grow we had to be taught by the Holy Spirit we had to learn from Jesus let's listen to the quote now he said separate yourself but did Abraham do it no sir and God never did blessing until he did fully obey what God Said do now I'm going to say this to the church the church will never go no further until you fully obey what God Said do you just can't do it God makes a promise Abraham wandered about and so forth and God never did fully blessing until we get over in the 13th chapter of Acts of Genesis and we find out then if that rose up a little fuss between the herdsmen and so forth and God seen that coming on so Abraham being a Christian like he said to his nephew lot he said let there have been old quarries between us because we are brothers he said now you take your choice if you go east I'll go west and if you go west I'll go east just take that's a real Christian gentleman see uh you go one way and I'll go the other let's not fuss with one another let not our husband fuss and notice there's another quote where brother Brandon even calls Abraham a coward and of course that's because he didn't tell the truth about Sarah my brother Ram said this proves the Bible's a Divine book because Abraham if he wrote the Bible would not have included his failures but God included the failures of the father of the faith and now we can see why it's an encouragement we all struggle we all fall short of the glory of God and it's an encouragement for us to overcome our trials and to not quit not give up keep Journey on keep following God keep walking in the steps of faithful Abraham which we know is also following the steps of our Lord Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote from Christ is revealed his own word August 22nd 65. Abraham for instance he's called the father the faithful notice how that that of his own characterness how do you think you would rule that he lied to the king that morning and said that was his sister when it was his wife with right of his cowardly Deeds that he done sort of never done that next we go to Genesis 13 Abraham Returns the Canaan 225 more miles and then separates from lot brother Brown said he was a Christian gentleman because he preferred lot he gave lot the First Choice rather than taking the First Choice brother said remember God didn't visit Abraham again until after he obeyed and separated himself from lot so now in Genesis 14 we're going to see how God visits Abraham again Abraham delivers lot after traveling 160 miles and then he meets Melchizedek on the return from Kanan again seeing God in a new form he never seen this form before and that's how we experience God as well as the years pass we see God minister in new forms God Appears to us in new forms new testimonies new experiences new dreams New Visions new words from the Lord new relationships so we thank God for his continual revelation of himself to us in Genesis 15 God confirms his Covenant with Abraham and this is a great encouragement that God will visit you again after you obey despite your failures again we here we see God's unconditional Covenant and friends this is the beautiful part God's covenant is unconditional because he's the one that will keep the Covenant as you can see in Abraham's life and other people's lives like Moses and David all the Believers fail the Covenant from time to time they all fall short of God's glory but God is the one who gives the unconditional Covenant because God chose his servants you and I and all these Old Testament Saints before the foundation of the world God is going to bring his promises and his plan to pass because it's for his own good pleasure and also Abraham chewing away the birds brother Graham said was a type of Abraham casting out Devils it's a type of the New Testament Church where Jesus said these signs shall follow them to believe in Mark 16 they shall cast out devils and notice he was doing this before he got the token of circumcision and this proves you can have a gift of God a spiritual gift to do signs wonders of Miracles and operate in that gift before you're even born again so one day God was talking to Abraham and he said Abraham I'm going to confirm this I'm going to I'm going to give you a sign God always gives time these signs shall follow them that believe they shall Shake into the pastor and put their name on the book that might be an almanac but not in the Bible see that's right yeah these times shall follow them at least in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they should take up a serpent and drink a daily thing we're not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover sign shall follow believers that hands laid on that believer that believer says amen I'm Abraham's seed I believe it and it works all right comes to pass now these signs that Abraham said to God how will I know this he said Abraham go get me a she goat and a heifer and a ram make a sacrifice and Abraham cut him apart killed him put him apart took a turtle dove and a young pigeon and throwed it in and made him and made a sacrifice unto the Lord and what he did he waited there and kept the birds off the food until the sun was going down we go to Genesis 16 and chapter Abraham takes Hagar that's a red dot that's a mistake and then ishmael's born now notice God never left him God never forsook him God never quit on him there was so much more that was going to happen in Abraham's life he just had to keep trusting God repenting obeying God seeking God and God would bring his perfect will to pass in Abraham's life as Abraham learned to submit and obey the voice of God in chapter 17 we see a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but first Abraham gets the revelation of El Shaddai and then he gets the circumcision Covenant which is a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost some people forget in this chapter that Abraham himself laughed at God when God said he would have seed through Sarah and friends what observation this is a prophet of God could have such unbelief that he would laugh at a thus saith the Lord he would laugh at the word of God because he didn't think it was possible but again this shows God's mercy to Abraham it shows God's mercy to us when we doubt things when we doubt whether God could do something Supernatural God never forsook Abraham God never rejected Abraham but what God did do is prove his word to Abraham God is always proving his word just like God will prove his word to us over and over again then we go to Genesis 18 we see the Lord appears to Abraham here in another form not Melchizedek but just God in a flesh body and the Lord appeared to Sarah of course with the two Messengers the two angelic Messengers and this is the last sign Abraham and surrogate before the arrival of Isaac the promised son of course this is the type of the ministry of brother Branham it was Jesus Christ in brother Branham now friends this is not a perfect type in Genesis 18 it was God in a human body and that human body was never born never died brother Randolph said God just borrowed the potash calcium and all the elements that make up the human body and then after God left God put those elements back to the Earth that's not the same as brother Branham brother bran was born a sinner he said LeBron said he was a sinner saved by grace he was not fit to live and he wasn't saying that to be humble so this is not a perfect type God and flesh in Genesis 18 was not a perfect type in brother random's life because brother bran was a sinner Say by grace in any sensible person could accept that only people that worship brother Branham would reject that and then in Genesis 18 we see Sarah lies to God and brother tells us God couldn't destroy Sarah for lying to his face calling out a liar because she was a part of Abraham and again this shows the grace and mercy of God think of all the times we've disobeyed the Holy Spirit we made a mistake we've disobeyed the word of God and yet God doesn't destroy us because we're part of the promise we're part of Christ as brother Brandon said we're Spirit of Christ's spirit then we see Abraham interceding for lot this is of course the prayer life of Abraham which we should have we should have a prayer life where we intercede for the foolish Virgin of course for the bride and of course for all men the Bible said Paul said pray for all men and before moving on remember brother Brown said six times thus saith the Holy Spirit his discernment Ministry was the last sign to the Gentiles before the Rapture and there would be no greater gift given to the Gentiles to see before the Rapture than this gift of discernment God gave to brother Branham that has stood the test of time that's undeniable let's listen to the quote and remember Abraham and his group never receive one more sign from God until the promised Sun arrives how many knows that's true that sign of discernment and the Royal Seed of Abraham let me hear you let me tell you thus saith the Lord you're receiving your last sign that's according to the scriptures and the revelation of God that's in my heart that speaks that this is the truth and I trust that you will believe it to be the truth now I'm just going to quickly go through Genesis 19 through 25 Sodom is destroyed in Genesis 19 and Genesis 20 Abraham and abimelech meet at Greer that's a 40-mile journey for Abraham and of course this is when Abraham lied to abimelech and yet God still favored Abraham because he was the more righteous man he was the father of faith and abimelech had to have Abraham pray for him that he could be blessed again but we still see a shortcoming of Abraham now if you're counting the red dots that's six shortcomings and then in Genesis 21 Isaac is born which is a type of the Rapture Hagar's cast out and then he goes back to Beersheba then in Genesis 22 Abraham travels 55 miles to offer Isaac and of course God spares Isaac like God spared Abraham's seed us and a ram died in our place the Lord Jesus Christ died in our place all glory to God in Genesis 23 Sarah dies in Genesis 24 Elise or gets Rebecca another type of the Rapture so there's another example of brother Branham in the life of Abraham so we see brother Ram's Ministry in Genesis 18 the Lord Discerning the thoughts and Tents of the heart to Abraham and Sarah then we see Brothers ministry as Eliezer to go get Rebecca brother and of course taught this he was at a difficult time in his ministry and he said Lord there must be some place in the Bible where my Ministry is he said I'm just going to open your Bible and point and let it be a verse that speaks to me and of course it was Genesis 24 brother random saw himself as the faithful servant to get a bride for Christ let's listen to the quote from Brother Bradham [Applause] this that some character in there that you dealt with would be on the same basis that would be my question if somebody done something and you gonna ask him about it then let me turn to that place survival and if somebody whatever they've done it'll leaned my way where I've done wrong or something you want me to do or haven't done let me see some character in the Bible I cannot close my eyes you said the Bible I'll fall off and put my finger on a scripture the chance to 24 7. Ella easer Abraham's faithful servant the model server of the Bible being sent to hunt the bride for Isaac chills run over me sure that's my that's right with the rest of my message pulling out the body said swear that you will not take a bride out of these but go to my own people he said what if the woman won't come with me said then you're free at this old he said and the god well of heaven will send his Angel before you to Direction he went right straight out began praying and he met the beautiful Rebecca that become the Bride of Isaac it's the perfect message back to the word go get that brat that's a duty that's what I'm here for that's what I'm trying to do is call out a bride then in Genesis 25 Abraham Weds Katura and he dies in Hebron which was a 30-mile journey so again there's many things we can see from Abraham's life think of all the miles he traveled think of all the journeys he went on he kept believing God he kept trusting and thus saith the Lord despite his failures he kept repenting and serving the lord exactly what we should do we should walk in the steps of faithful Abraham I want to start bringing this down to a close and add some quotes from Brother Branham this has always been a blessing to me and works as Faith expressed in 1965 brother random said every time he got feeling a little blue he turned to Romans chapter four and he'd read how Abraham was not weak in faith any staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in faith giving God glory so friends think of this every time brother Branham has a prophet felt discouraged he went to the life of Abraham to encourage himself so next time you're battling depression the next time you're battling self-pity you're feeling blue feeling sad listen to see if the Holy Spirit might direct you to go read Romans chapter four like the Holy Spirit directed brother Branham to go read he said every time I go to feeling a little blue let's listen to the quote listen to this now who against hope against hope all hopes is gone oh every time I go feel a little blue here's the chapter I turn to Romans 4. I think who against hope lead and hope that he might become the father of Nations according to that which is spoken so shall thy seed be now listen 19th verse and be not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered out the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving glory to God and then also I love this quote perfect strength by Perfect weakness November 1961. brother said Romans 4 is the Divine commentary of the life of Abraham we know Abraham many times got kind of frustrated like we do but when his commentary was written there wasn't any of his frustrations mentioned never mention them at all Abraham staggered not at the promise of God the ram said I hope mine will be rode up there there's no mistakes in brother Brown's commentary from God about his life he said may it be just what I tried to do the intention of my heart to do for God's people and friends this is absolutely biblical if Abraham's mistakes and failures are not recorded in heaven neither will ours because we're under the blood of Jesus Christ which speaks better things than the blood of bulls and goats of the Old Testament and of course we have many scriptures to back it up just read the entire chapter of Romans 8. there's no condemnation to us because we're in Christ Jesus no one can lay anything to our charge if God is for us who can be against us nothing shall separate us from the love of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote I was reading over in the book of of Romans the fourth chapter where Paul uh wrote the the Divine commentary of the life of Abraham now we know that Abraham many times got kind of frustrated like we do but when the his commentary was written there wasn't any of his frustrations mentioned anything I never mentioned him at all said Abraham staggered not the promise of God through unbelief but with strong given praise to God see and that's why I hope mine be wrote up there is not my mistakes and everything but just the what I tried to do the intention of my heart to do for God's people I remember friends Colossians 1 22 also says Christ has made us unreprovable blameless without spa and blemish we could not be any more clean any more forgiven any more pure any more sinless in the eyes of God than what we already are because of the blood of Jesus Christ and our simple faith in the blood of Christ as Romans 3 25 says whom God is set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood Hallelujah that's what our faith is in the blood of Jesus Christ our faith is not in our works we're not saved by our works for no man shall boast of their Works according to Ephesians 2 verses 8-10 what is the blood of Jesus Christ that makes us holy and our faith is in the blood of Jesus Christ also another scripture is First John 3 9 this shows the power of the seed of the Holy Ghost the Bible said whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God so every spiritual Seed of Abraham with the baptism of the Holy Ghost has the seed of God in him it's a spiritual seed now which makes us the Seed of Abraham because our faith is in Christ and that seed that Holy Ghost in US cannot sin and never can sin so there's a part of us that has not sinned and never has sinned but yet there's a part of us that sins every day that's our flesh and our mind but the soul that is Born Again of the Holy Ghost has never sinned and will never sin because it's a part of God's Own eternal life we also see this is true in First Peter 1 verse 23 we're born again of The Incorruptible seed the word of God so when a person is born again the Holy Ghost comes into their soul that Holy Ghost and their soul is like a seed the Bible says and that seed cannot sin because that seed is a part of God and this is the power of Abraham's seed which is Christ in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing it was a blessing studying this preaching this the quotes that brother Branham did so much to understand the life of Abraham so again we thank the Lord for sending us faithful servant the Lord's true Prophet brother William Branham hope this video was a blessing hope it was an encouragement if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart foreign
