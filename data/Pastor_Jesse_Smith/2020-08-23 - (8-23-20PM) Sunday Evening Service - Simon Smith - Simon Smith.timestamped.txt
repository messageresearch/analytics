[39:52] just karen good seeing you
[39:56] little one younger one don't say like
[39:58] that growing up
[40:00] we are back to the teaching mode again
[40:04] here by god's grace hopefully
[40:05] everybody's okay with that i know
[40:07] we're hope i didn't wear anyone out this
[40:10] morning sometimes i get
[40:12] you know we have the little uh the joke
[40:15] there at our home church where
[40:17] living waters tabernacle actually stands
[40:19] for lwt which is long waters tabernacles
[40:22] so
[40:23] we sometimes really can't his averages
[40:25] hour and a half i mean every service
[40:27] hour and a half and
[40:27] some sometimes you know the flash is
[40:30] weary
[40:33] so anyhow i don't want to hold you long
[40:35] i'm probably not going to sing a song
[40:36] special today
[40:38] uh just because we got really good
[40:40] voices here
[40:42] soldiers for uh amen by the malachi but
[40:45] justin
[40:46] i'm sure there's many others that can do
[40:47] a song special here as well
[40:49] and um and hopefully this morning was
[40:52] edifying we wanted to see it last thing
[40:55] i want
[40:56] the whole point you know and i'll say it
[40:58] in whatever the
[40:59] little tiny gift lord give me is to be
[41:01] edified and to
[41:02] to raise your faith on the word of god
[41:05] amen
[41:05] but this thing's supernatural this bible
[41:08] uh is controlled it's
[41:10] it's an open book but it's controlled on
[41:12] how much opens at a certain time and
[41:13] what can open what can be taught
[41:15] and it's all timing everything's timing
[41:17] and waiting on god and
[41:20] thinking and searching and just looking
[41:22] at things on your heart
[41:23] you know so and and god will open it in
[41:26] his due season
[41:27] and the things we're going to need at
[41:29] the end is
[41:31] is just hanging right there i think it's
[41:33] in the hangars waiting for the bride
[41:36] waiting for the season waiting for the
[41:37] exact time for things to be broken and
[41:40] revealed to us
[41:41] because we're going to need these last
[41:42] little bit for the revelation
[41:44] uh for revelation of for rapturing faith
[41:48] so we want we want to be always open to
[41:49] those things and
[41:51] man it works always first time here at
[41:53] this at this uh
[41:55] powerpoint schedule maybe sister acacia
[41:58] is doing a wonderful job there so let's
[42:00] go to revelations 3
[42:02] verse 14. i got a little bit of reading
[42:04] here and this is
[42:06] uh maybe maybe maybe nothing uh new
[42:09] tonight but i want to rehash some things
[42:12] because this is going to be important i
[42:14] believe
[42:17] maybe refreshing uh going over
[42:21] some things and if i had maybe if i
[42:24] spent a little more time i could
[42:25] actually really dial in a major
[42:27] study on this and show historically
[42:29] documentary
[42:30] documents and those sort of things how
[42:33] solid
[42:34] what we believe is okay we have a real
[42:37] what god's brought us to is we're very
[42:39] uh very powerful and
[42:42] i've noticed things as you as you deal
[42:44] with other christians other
[42:46] people other faiths i'll say like that
[42:49] um
[42:50] then when it comes to revelation you
[42:51] really can't do anything for them
[42:53] because revelation comes by the spirit
[42:56] all you can do is just is is tell them
[43:00] the truth
[43:01] try to explain it the best ability show
[43:04] them the scriptures and then then
[43:07] it's up to god open his eyes so anyhow
[43:11] revelations 3 verse 14
[43:14] revelations 3 and 14 not of the leo
[43:16] scene church age
[43:18] and i want to and we got a little bit of
[43:19] reading directly after these two sets of
[43:21] scriptures we're going to read
[43:22] because i want to show you how important
[43:24] this is and just what the prophet of god
[43:26] brought in for this you know and for the
[43:28] revelation of jesus christ so
[43:30] this is out of the book of revelation
[43:32] the revelation of jesus christ
[43:34] and verse verse 14 and unto the angel of
[43:38] the church of the laodiceans write
[43:40] these things saith the amen the faithful
[43:44] and the true
[43:48] the faithful and the true witness
[43:51] the beginning of the creation of god
[43:54] and if we could could we turn to first
[43:57] timothy 3
[43:59] and i want to teach on a certain subject
[44:02] and i'm really going to start trying
[44:04] myself to to dive back into this
[44:07] because and i'm going to be sending some
[44:11] things
[44:11] just some basic things but there my
[44:14] pastor started preaching on an angle of
[44:16] this and i've never
[44:19] understood the importance and we know
[44:22] it's important but it's
[44:23] very very important
[44:27] and uh you'll see some scriptures on how
[44:29] important
[44:30] this is in uh
[44:34] first timothy 3
[44:37] uh verse 14
[44:41] he says these things right i unto thee
[44:43] hoping to come unto thee shortly
[44:45] and saint paul wants to visit these
[44:48] these saints here
[44:50] he says but if i carry long that thou
[44:52] mayest know how to
[44:53] let behave out is to behave thyself in
[44:56] the house of god
[44:57] which is the church of the living god
[45:00] the pillar and the ground
[45:02] of the truth and without controversy
[45:06] great is the mystery of godliness
[45:08] god was manifested in the flesh
[45:12] justified in the spirit scene of angels
[45:13] preached unto the gentiles
[45:15] believed on in the world received up
[45:18] into glory okay so let's say a word of
[45:22] prayer
[45:24] [Music]
[45:26] dearly father lord jesus lord we love
[45:28] you lord and lord thank you lord and
[45:30] bless all the warriors lord saints that
[45:32] push the way out once again lord for us
[45:34] a second service on
[45:35] sunday lord and lord especially to
[45:38] listen to
[45:39] a different maybe a little awkward kind
[45:40] of a teacher
[45:42] maybe not the most revelation not the
[45:43] most dynamic lord of speech or even
[45:46] articulate or
[45:49] maybe using voice inflection or however
[45:51] you want to say it lord
[45:52] you you build me this way lord this is
[45:54] how i am you know i just pray lord
[45:56] that you would just be able you would i
[45:58] would able to get beside myself
[46:00] lord and just let you speak on and be a
[46:02] blessing to your children once again to
[46:03] your bride to your wife lord i'm not
[46:05] speaking to just
[46:06] a woman here out in the world lord lord
[46:08] this is the elected
[46:10] eternal bride of christ uh
[46:13] standing here before me lord these are
[46:15] the ones you
[46:16] have chosen to be ordained in this hour
[46:18] on this day in this age lord to
[46:21] manifest your lord and lord they come to
[46:23] hear you speak oh we ask that you would
[46:25] speak god
[46:26] in the name of jesus christ amen you may
[46:28] have your seats
[46:31] and that's probably made the way that
[46:33] every minister should view the
[46:35] congregation not as
[46:36] something to where i want to or you
[46:39] would maybe a minister want to elevate
[46:40] themselves as far as
[46:42] be more revelated or understanding or
[46:44] whatever but
[46:45] to really reverence his wife
[46:49] you are the bride of christ and for some
[46:52] reason it falls a lot here to
[46:54] me to speak to the church especially
[46:59] and to the wife of the living god
[47:03] so what we have here is we're
[47:07] obviously dealing with uh the mystery
[47:10] uh of godliness and if i had a topic
[47:12] would be the capstone revelation all
[47:15] right
[47:15] uh there's many things uh angles you
[47:18] could teach on but i want to show you
[47:20] uh you know brother cam has been dealt
[47:22] with a certain scripture and just blew
[47:24] my mind and i want to touch on it today
[47:25] because it was
[47:26] just such a blessing
[47:29] and shows what has taken place in this
[47:33] day
[47:34] i mean you think how how even science
[47:36] has been parallel with the gospel you
[47:38] know
[47:39] uh einstein i believe was oh
[47:43] 1904 or five or six like that has
[47:45] released the document on light and how
[47:47] powerful it is and how
[47:48] you can harness light and how light
[47:50] works and all those things and
[47:52] just years after that how how god would
[47:54] bring forth the godhead you know before
[47:56] bring forth the pillar of fire the
[47:57] revelation of that now it almost goes
[48:00] everything's parallel it's just a race
[48:02] between the carnal and the true
[48:04] between uh the flesh and the
[48:06] supernatural
[48:07] and so we want to get into this just a
[48:10] little bit
[48:10] and this may be rehashed but i want to
[48:12] be i want to just hopefully show you
[48:14] and i do have some pictures in here to
[48:16] help keep you awake and
[48:18] keep you keep your eyes just pretend
[48:20] it's like
[48:21] well this is like a tv screen okay so
[48:24] you have teaching
[48:25] and tv you can't beat it i mean it's
[48:27] just tough to
[48:29] match that in this hour i mean so
[48:32] and and the deodorant has been working
[48:34] it's definitely strong enough for man
[48:35] okay so
[48:36] i've not been sweating uh at all in
[48:39] these areas and regions so
[48:41] very i'm thankful my god's great so um
[48:44] i don't know if you know sister i karen
[48:46] i i forgot to put the odor on this
[48:48] morning and
[48:49] i realized that midway through turnpike
[48:51] drive and i was like
[48:52] that's like well we can stop and hit so
[48:54] i picked up some that all that i had
[48:55] we're selling was secret that's a
[48:57] woman's deodorant
[48:59] and i i know the saying
[49:02] so anyhow it is
[49:06] yeah so it's okay i smell good
[49:09] like the bride i smell like the bride of
[49:11] christ
[49:13] so i want to go back to this uh and
[49:16] maybe touch here um
[49:20] and this was brought back to my
[49:22] attention uh with the church ages we've
[49:24] been going through church ages here
[49:26] at the men's we do men's church age
[49:29] meetings every saturday night
[49:31] we go through as brothers sit there
[49:34] and and and the last maybe the
[49:37] couple times back we we finally got to
[49:39] the portion where
[49:41] uh you know he brought the prophet
[49:43] brought forth the letter to the bride
[49:45] and i called my pastor said hey brother
[49:47] what about if we read this
[49:48] one one sentence or one paragraph at a
[49:51] time then just sit all the brothers sit
[49:53] back
[49:54] and just wait for things to drop and if
[49:56] they're if god would drop anything at
[49:58] that time
[49:59] so we would read a paragraph sit there
[50:02] some brothers would reflect and this and
[50:04] this and me
[50:05] i really was really longing for this
[50:07] part as far as the
[50:09] the letter to the bride and to me it was
[50:12] a blessing
[50:13] there's things in there we don't
[50:14] understand there's things on there
[50:17] we can't interpret yet there's things in
[50:19] there we're waiting to make
[50:21] we're waiting for god to be manifest and
[50:23] but we see the the timeline he's using
[50:26] or
[50:26] the the the pattern he's using you know
[50:28] he's going back to moses he's going back
[50:30] to elijah he's going back to
[50:31] christ the the the three showdowns and
[50:34] and those sort of things and that's
[50:36] and that was to me a blessing you know
[50:38] but as we went into more of the church
[50:40] ages we got to you know a certain thing
[50:42] here
[50:42] and and i want to hit this here and this
[50:44] is a little we're going to go we're
[50:45] going to read a little bit here okay
[50:46] hope so but stay with me let's
[50:48] i know i i know i maybe i should just
[50:50] move my arms more
[50:51] or my legs just to keep motion keep
[50:53] motion
[50:54] and anyhow so you're revelations 3 and
[50:58] 14. notice the prophet of god now
[50:59] brother branham
[51:00] it was it was kind of leasing and
[51:02] trusting brotherly veil to
[51:04] to help write these things and they work
[51:06] together and he
[51:07] from what i've heard he proofread it
[51:08] three times or seven times i'm sorry
[51:10] uh um so we're just kind of we're just
[51:12] throwing this in here
[51:13] um uh because it's in the church age
[51:16] book
[51:17] he says uh my isn't that the most
[51:20] wonderful description of the attributes
[51:22] of our
[51:22] lovely lord jesus our lovely lord and
[51:25] savior jesus christ
[51:26] these words just make me want to shout
[51:28] he's dealing with revelations three here
[51:30] he's dealing with uh these things say
[51:31] the amen the faithful the true witness
[51:32] the beginning of the creation of god
[51:33] right
[51:34] he says they bring such a spirit of
[51:36] reality into my heart just reading him
[51:37] without
[51:38] even waiting for a thorough revelation
[51:40] of the spirit upon them thrills me so
[51:42] even just keep reading the words that
[51:43] did something to him okay
[51:45] and now he says jesus is giving us this
[51:47] description of himself
[51:49] in relation to the last age now this is
[51:51] laodicea
[51:52] he brings this out i am uh those things
[51:55] the amen the faithful the true witness
[51:58] and the days of grace are winding up he
[51:59] has looked from the first century right
[52:01] through to the 20th
[52:03] told us all the things concerning these
[52:05] ages before he reveals the
[52:07] characteristics of the last age
[52:09] to us he gives us one final look at his
[52:14] own glorious and supreme deity
[52:17] and if we could think of that in now
[52:19] we're dealing with god
[52:21] god almighty
[52:26] the creator the one who is eternal has
[52:29] all power all knowledge yes
[52:32] and he brings these things out i just
[52:34] love the way he placed that because
[52:35] of his own gracious supreme
[52:39] deity to be in that presence this is the
[52:43] capstone revelation
[52:44] of himself so he's pushing something
[52:48] supreme here and this is something
[52:50] important he calls it the capstone
[52:52] revelation of himself
[52:53] uh thus saith the amen jesus is the amen
[52:57] of god okay jesus
[53:00] is the so let it be of god amen stands
[53:03] for not for
[53:04] finality it stands for approval
[53:08] it stands for prevailing promise it
[53:10] stands for unchanging
[53:12] promise amen so if god says it it's
[53:14] going to happen
[53:15] if god reiterates it if he pulls it from
[53:17] the old and places new
[53:18] you can bank on it you can guarantee it
[53:21] because he has uttered it twice
[53:23] how much in the new testament is
[53:24] actually pulled from the old that shows
[53:26] it's just
[53:26] as pure and as he's going to be just as
[53:29] faithful as pervert
[53:30] uh uh preserving his word as he's ever
[53:32] been amen amen
[53:33] every word is yay and amen in christ
[53:35] sure it stands for the unchanging
[53:37] promise it stands for the seal
[53:39] of god in other words when he says it
[53:41] it's done nothing can break that seal
[53:44] when he speaks the word
[53:45] that word is now sealed into it moves
[53:47] from eternity
[53:48] and then when he speaks the word it
[53:49] moves into time that's right
[53:51] but it's a sealed word because him and
[53:53] the word are one amen god and the word
[53:56] are one absolute
[53:57] i want you to watch this carefully i
[53:58] would see something really sweet and
[53:59] beautiful
[54:01] i said this is his end time revelation
[54:03] of himself
[54:04] when the day of grace closes then the
[54:07] millennium comes very shortly thereafter
[54:09] doesn't it amen
[54:10] he says well let me read with you and he
[54:12] reads isaiah 56
[54:14] i'm 65 i'm sorry 16-19
[54:17] that he who blesses himself in the earth
[54:19] shall bless himself in the god
[54:21] of truth okay this is isaiah 16.
[54:24] uh i'm sorry 65 verse 16 right
[54:27] so he pulls this and he says he says and
[54:30] he that sweareth
[54:31] in the earth shall swear by the god of
[54:33] truth because the former troubles are
[54:34] forgotten
[54:35] because they are hid from mine eyes
[54:38] right now
[54:38] he pulls this he says let's read this
[54:40] together he reads all three of these or
[54:41] sorry four of these scriptures
[54:42] but he's focusing on the god of truth
[54:45] the god of truth right
[54:46] he says this is about jerusalem this is
[54:48] the millennium but as we go into the
[54:50] millennium we hear what he says about a
[54:51] certain kind
[54:52] of god verse 16.
[54:55] he that he who blesses himself in the
[54:58] earth shall be blessed of
[54:59] himself in the god of truth yes that is
[55:01] true but the real translation is not
[55:04] god of truth it is the god of the amen
[55:08] so why would the prophet allow uh
[55:10] brotherly veil and they and the
[55:12] the quran collaborated on this to put
[55:14] this in here
[55:15] he says it is the god of amen so we read
[55:17] it uh so we read it
[55:19] shall bless himself in the god of amen
[55:21] and he that sweareth in the earth shall
[55:23] swear by the god of the amen because the
[55:25] former troubles are forgotten because
[55:27] they are hid from my eyes behold i
[55:29] create a new heavens and the earth and
[55:30] the former shall not remember
[55:31] nor come into mind right so what is it
[55:34] he's saying he's what he's trying to say
[55:36] is that revelations where he says where
[55:37] christ himself god the son is revealing
[55:40] that he is the amen
[55:42] he's pulling all the way back here in
[55:43] isaiah and saying look he says
[55:45] this is the god of truth or the god of
[55:47] amen as well they're one and the same
[55:49] right
[55:50] now what now the beautiful thing is what
[55:52] he puts here he says
[55:53] the new testament does not reveal
[55:55] another god
[55:59] i was in denomination i know they teach
[56:02] you different
[56:03] and from what i've heard from uh a
[56:06] brother
[56:06] two weeks ago he said there there's a
[56:08] doctrine of two two gods now coming out
[56:10] in the message
[56:13] father and son and the holy ghost is god
[56:15] himself so the same god father and son
[56:17] so those are already dealing with false
[56:19] doctrines again coming making coming
[56:21] alive and this and that
[56:22] the new testament does not reveal
[56:23] another god it is the further revelation
[56:25] of the one and the same god christ did
[56:27] not come down to make himself
[56:29] known why why why is that
[56:34] why didn't he want to reveal himself he
[56:37] did not come to reveal the son he came
[56:39] to reveal and to make known the father
[56:45] and now in this last age we come back
[56:48] we have come back to the capstone
[56:50] revelation
[56:52] he says the most important
[56:55] revelation of godhead in the whole bible
[56:57] that
[56:58] is jesus is god
[57:02] the most important thing if there's
[57:05] outside i'll say this i was like
[57:06] the the token is the is the culmination
[57:10] of the message
[57:10] we must be born again receive the
[57:12] baptist be converted
[57:14] receive his life in us and now we're
[57:15] just as eternal as he is amen right
[57:17] because he is now in us we have become
[57:19] a new creation a new creature right amen
[57:23] but as far as revelation he says the
[57:25] godhead is the most
[57:26] important thing to know
[57:29] the most important revelation of godhead
[57:32] in the whole bible that
[57:33] is jesus is god he and the father are
[57:36] one
[57:37] this is one god and his name is the lord
[57:39] jesus christ
[57:43] and we know we see
[57:46] the power like we said earlier this
[57:47] morning the power of the bee are moving
[57:50] so the now the bible talks about the
[57:52] wiles of the devil
[57:55] and that word wiles means the tricks so
[57:58] there's coming now remember
[57:59] jesus always he said in matthew 16 he
[58:01] says beware of the leaven of the
[58:02] pharisees and scribes and pharisees
[58:03] right
[58:04] so that if he's warning back then about
[58:06] false doctrine
[58:08] and we know this 11 if there's a false
[58:10] doctrine coming there must be
[58:11] uh back then there must be another now
[58:14] remember the revelation
[58:15] has already come who jesus christ was
[58:18] but there must be something so close
[58:21] to who he is coming it'll be a worldwide
[58:25] revelation
[58:26] as they would say jesus is god and he
[58:29] the father of one there is one god in
[58:31] his name is the lord jesus christ okay
[58:34] now
[58:37] and if it's a revelation i guess we
[58:40] maybe
[58:41] think about how powerful a revelation is
[58:45] and i don't know how brother jesse
[58:46] teaches it here but the prophet said he
[58:48] says
[58:48] faith and revelation are like twins
[58:50] right or really close
[58:52] side to my side and i always talk like
[58:54] this and but jesse may have a different
[58:55] way
[58:55] and you can come and correct me if you
[58:56] want or whatever but i always talk like
[58:59] this
[59:00] is that i i teach the the now he never
[59:04] said they were one
[59:05] in some spots he says they're one of the
[59:06] same the son of their twins and however
[59:08] but i teach that a revelation actually
[59:09] comes a split second first
[59:11] and then faith because a revelation is a
[59:14] i know or thus say the lord or i just
[59:17] know it a revelation
[59:18] comes boom uh um i'm going to make the
[59:21] rapture let's say i have a revelation
[59:22] i'm going to make the rapture boom i
[59:23] know it
[59:24] now it's been revealed i saw a vision of
[59:26] me and the white horse is following
[59:27] christ back and this that means i'm
[59:28] right that means i'm making rapture
[59:30] boom that's it now i can have total
[59:32] faith towards it
[59:34] but it takes an opening first once
[59:36] because right here
[59:37] if i cannot see it spiritually it's hope
[59:40] right right but once i see it
[59:44] once god opens it up to me and reveals
[59:47] something to me now i can have
[59:48] all faith towards it amen amen amen
[59:51] that's how i teach it the revelation is
[59:53] just a split second before faith kicks
[59:55] in
[59:57] i i'm trying to think of as a certain
[59:59] thing uh um
[1:00:04] i'll say it like this when i was in
[1:00:06] denomination i've told the story right
[1:00:07] here before
[1:00:10] when i was in the nomination i was under
[1:00:12] a certain teacher i was just right i was
[1:00:13] a year in the year
[1:00:14] and i was at i was at their team i was
[1:00:16] at this the bible study okay and they're
[1:00:17] doing a bible study on trinity
[1:00:19] and i'm sitting there and my wife's
[1:00:20] heard this about three thousand times
[1:00:22] mom my wife i'm sitting there and the
[1:00:24] man's teaching his name is
[1:00:26] so-and-so and uh he's teaching and he
[1:00:28] gets done with the whole study and he's
[1:00:30] dealing with father someone goes faster
[1:00:31] goes dealing with three persons and he
[1:00:33] says yeah now the father is this and
[1:00:35] he's got
[1:00:35] he knows all things the son does not
[1:00:36] know everything because he was limited
[1:00:38] in this man
[1:00:39] then the holy ghost is we're not sure
[1:00:41] he's like he's like a substance of what
[1:00:43] god was and
[1:00:44] breaking it all down however and then at
[1:00:46] the whole column at the whole end of the
[1:00:48] whole study he's like
[1:00:49] he kind of singles me out he's like
[1:00:50] first time he goes or just called me
[1:00:52] simon he said simon
[1:00:53] he said when you get to heaven do you
[1:00:55] ever think it's going to be like this
[1:00:56] and he said
[1:00:57] he said there'll be the father on the
[1:00:58] throne you know white and white beard
[1:01:00] and just
[1:01:01] old looking and and he will be the
[1:01:03] father and then over here on the
[1:01:05] by the crystal sea jesus would be
[1:01:07] sitting on the on a dock with his
[1:01:08] feet just dripping in the crystal sea
[1:01:10] and and he'll just be sitting there
[1:01:12] and then he said and then he said he's
[1:01:14] now the holy ghost he'll become flying
[1:01:15] and he'll be
[1:01:16] just flying around just doing whatever
[1:01:18] it was and he goes did you ever
[1:01:20] think of it when we look at the heaven
[1:01:21] that it's going to look like that
[1:01:24] and me you're saved and this is honest
[1:01:27] you know the lord knows it's true i said
[1:01:29] well i
[1:01:30] i said brother i i just thought it was
[1:01:32] jesus on the throne
[1:01:34] [Laughter]
[1:01:36] amen and that i don't know i didn't
[1:01:39] understand the importance of why
[1:01:42] he would visualize and try to imagine
[1:01:45] this
[1:01:46] and me i'm just like i i i just thought
[1:01:48] it was jesus on the throne
[1:01:52] because it's revelation
[1:01:55] he's teaching me something and i still
[1:01:57] can't see it
[1:01:58] and i'm like i just thought it was
[1:02:02] and he kind of looked at me and i looked
[1:02:03] at him like
[1:02:06] i'm sure he was like wow he's a oneness
[1:02:08] anointings on him or whatever
[1:02:11] but that's a basic revelation well not
[1:02:14] race that's a great revelation
[1:02:15] now but notice here in revelation of
[1:02:17] romans romans 1 and 15
[1:02:19] so revelation is everything to us
[1:02:22] yes the prophet said to what pray for
[1:02:24] revelation more than
[1:02:26] anything else and this and tonight
[1:02:29] i'm sure i'm sure most of you know what
[1:02:30] i'm going to be as far as
[1:02:32] i'll be heading this way on godhead but
[1:02:34] this might be a refresher if if
[1:02:36] if you don't understand these things
[1:02:37] come talk to me come talk about jesse
[1:02:39] and i'm sure
[1:02:39] most you have the revelation but i want
[1:02:41] to teach it the way god shows it to me
[1:02:43] okay
[1:02:43] amen and it's just be like a rehash here
[1:02:46] he says now so so as much as in me
[1:02:50] is i am ready to preach the gospel to
[1:02:52] you that are at rome also
[1:02:53] and and the reason i'm hitting this
[1:02:55] tonight is because there was a brother
[1:02:56] brother a wonderful wonderful brother
[1:02:59] brother john skaggs
[1:03:01] and i'm gonna tell you you mind if i
[1:03:02] tell you a little testimony the reason
[1:03:03] i'm i'm hitting on this is because
[1:03:04] there's something coming
[1:03:05] according to his this is a secondhand
[1:03:07] testimony but i want you to be ready i
[1:03:09] want you to be alert and beware i want
[1:03:10] you to be asking god
[1:03:13] for more revelation of this now here's
[1:03:15] his story
[1:03:16] is that he was at his house one day and
[1:03:18] he said the holy spirit said
[1:03:19] drive to such town he gets in the car
[1:03:22] and he drives
[1:03:23] this and this he gets to town he said
[1:03:24] all right lord it said the lord said go
[1:03:26] two more blocks move
[1:03:27] he goes two more blocks take a left take
[1:03:28] his left and he says take it right here
[1:03:30] go down the street
[1:03:31] and he said go in there and there was a
[1:03:33] trailer there a house trailer
[1:03:35] and he said lord you only go in there he
[1:03:36] goes yes just go in there
[1:03:38] and he said he went in there he opened
[1:03:40] the door went in
[1:03:42] knocked and whatever and they were
[1:03:43] having a church service
[1:03:45] and at the church service the man was
[1:03:47] preaching he says there's coming a new
[1:03:49] trinity doctrine
[1:03:51] there's coming a new doctrine there's
[1:03:53] something coming something new being
[1:03:55] taught
[1:03:55] and he wondered why god had brought him
[1:03:57] there and now here he's the lord is
[1:03:59] revealing to him there's there's
[1:04:00] something coming
[1:04:02] remember if this is the age of the
[1:04:03] greatest deception if this is the age
[1:04:05] where
[1:04:06] the devil is going to be uh so close to
[1:04:08] being anointed that he is almost
[1:04:10] at flesh we're gonna see we won't see
[1:04:12] the antichrist in flesh
[1:04:13] but we are going to see we're right at
[1:04:16] the time of when he and when satan is
[1:04:18] kicked out of heaven
[1:04:18] and he takes over we're right at that
[1:04:20] time the age of deception this is the
[1:04:22] greatest the darkest hour
[1:04:24] this is where anything i mean look at
[1:04:25] look at america so confused everyone's
[1:04:27] confused
[1:04:27] no clue what's going on well some say
[1:04:29] this someday that there's conspiracy
[1:04:30] there sometimes i mean we have no idea
[1:04:32] what's really
[1:04:32] all we know we're the coming of the lord
[1:04:34] jesus christ so we must now
[1:04:37] get this out of our ears get this out of
[1:04:39] yours and what the bible says keep your
[1:04:41] right eye
[1:04:41] single and the whole body will be light
[1:04:43] so we must focus what on
[1:04:45] light the whole body is going to be
[1:04:46] light and we have to be looking at the
[1:04:48] light
[1:04:50] amen so and we know the light is the
[1:04:52] logos the holy ghost
[1:04:53] god almighty right amen but now
[1:04:55] revelation is so important here
[1:04:57] now look at this this is this might seem
[1:04:58] simple but look look at what it really
[1:05:00] is
[1:05:01] so as much as he is and me i'm ready to
[1:05:03] preach the gospel to you that are at
[1:05:04] rome
[1:05:05] also for i am not ashamed of the gospel
[1:05:07] of christ
[1:05:09] for it is the power of god unto
[1:05:11] salvation right
[1:05:13] to everyone that believeth to the jew
[1:05:15] first and also to the greek
[1:05:17] for therein is the righteousness of god
[1:05:20] revealed so basic
[1:05:25] salvation is a revelation amen
[1:05:28] amen sometimes i think us in the message
[1:05:30] we're so we're so deep
[1:05:32] and that's okay there's nothing wrong
[1:05:34] with being deeply or so uh
[1:05:36] want to know this great mystery this
[1:05:37] great mystery and those things are
[1:05:38] wonderful or isn't that but we forget
[1:05:40] how basic and how powerful salvation
[1:05:43] itself is
[1:05:44] just wanting to be saved is a revelation
[1:05:46] just saying hey jesus christ is god and
[1:05:48] i want to
[1:05:49] i'm a sinner just acknowledging your own
[1:05:51] sin repenting be baptized is a
[1:05:52] revelation
[1:05:56] for there it is the righteousness of god
[1:05:58] revealed from faith to faith
[1:06:00] as it is written the just shall live by
[1:06:03] faith and if you look up where that
[1:06:04] scripture is the just shall live by
[1:06:06] faith
[1:06:06] he's dealing with pastors that are
[1:06:08] traveling all over and will not stay at
[1:06:10] home nicolette
[1:06:12] and where'd that come out of the
[1:06:14] nicolaitan age which is where luther
[1:06:16] come out and says we don't have to talk
[1:06:17] to a priest we don't have to talk about
[1:06:18] this the pope or this night he's the
[1:06:20] what we have to talk to one meter mean
[1:06:21] one meter only and that's the lord jesus
[1:06:23] christ amen
[1:06:24] sure yeah so now dealing with this
[1:06:28] godhead issue dealing with these things
[1:06:30] uh
[1:06:31] we're 22 minutes in so let's continue on
[1:06:33] here we're gonna we're gonna go
[1:06:35] this is in in in matthew 11 verse 25
[1:06:39] and at that time jesus answered and said
[1:06:42] i thank the o father
[1:06:43] lord of heaven and earth because thou
[1:06:45] has hid these things from the wise and
[1:06:47] prudent and has revealed them
[1:06:48] unto obey revealed them right
[1:06:52] even so father for seem good in thy
[1:06:54] sight all things are delivered
[1:06:56] unto me of my father and no man knoweth
[1:06:58] the son but the father neither knoweth
[1:07:00] he
[1:07:00] any man north knoweth any man the father
[1:07:03] save the son
[1:07:04] and he to whom the son will reveal him
[1:07:07] yes so the only way you're gonna know
[1:07:09] who god is
[1:07:10] is through the revelation of jesus
[1:07:12] christ amen
[1:07:14] amen and i i really believe
[1:07:17] one of the last couple of revelations
[1:07:19] because
[1:07:20] i was talking to a certain man at the
[1:07:22] job site a catholic man
[1:07:24] and he's talking about judas and this
[1:07:25] and this and i said have you ever
[1:07:26] noticed
[1:07:27] that after john 13 when judas leaves the
[1:07:30] scene is when jesus christ reveals who
[1:07:32] he is
[1:07:33] he says i am the father he's i am the
[1:07:35] holy ghost i will come to you
[1:07:37] and what jesus is revealing he's all of
[1:07:39] that all that right
[1:07:40] and even step back going
[1:07:44] gave me a look and thought about it he
[1:07:45] was chewing on it and
[1:07:48] i just left it right there search out
[1:07:51] the scriptures for and you find them
[1:07:52] eternal life
[1:07:53] jesus said that that's what john 5 39
[1:07:56] 539 now
[1:08:00] to know him is life the person
[1:08:03] christ himself not compare he's
[1:08:06] it's a revelation that god built his
[1:08:08] church upon and if we don't build upon
[1:08:10] that same
[1:08:11] church the bible said abel by faith and
[1:08:14] faith is a divine revelation
[1:08:16] see faith is a divine revelation all
[1:08:18] right the whole thing is just built upon
[1:08:19] revelation and unless
[1:08:20] that this is revealed to you jesus said
[1:08:23] i thank the father
[1:08:24] that thou has hid these from the wise
[1:08:26] and from the wise of this world and
[1:08:28] revealed to babe such as we learned see
[1:08:30] now the whole thing is built there
[1:08:32] you've got to know the person
[1:08:34] amen not even i was like this even the
[1:08:37] study is nothing
[1:08:38] you have to know the living person
[1:08:42] in my prayer when i go to praying and i
[1:08:44] have a certain need i say i say
[1:08:46] lord make it so plain i can't miss it
[1:08:50] and that's how he makes it because he
[1:08:52] knows i
[1:08:53] am not the sharpest pipe cutting tool
[1:08:56] okay i say lord make it so plain lord i
[1:09:00] cannot
[1:09:00] miss it and that is a special person to
[1:09:03] me to him request
[1:09:05] yes because i want to know if he says
[1:09:07] something if he does something i know
[1:09:09] it's
[1:09:09] him and i can bank on it absolutely sure
[1:09:13] he says you've got to know the person
[1:09:14] amen now
[1:09:18] who is the son
[1:09:22] let me jump to a scripture here i'm
[1:09:24] gonna read this here let me jump to it
[1:09:27] look at this here look at this
[1:09:32] in matthew 16 verse 13. when jesus came
[1:09:34] into the century of philippi he asked
[1:09:36] his
[1:09:37] disciples saying whom do ye who do men
[1:09:39] say that i the son of man
[1:09:40] am and they said some say thou john the
[1:09:42] baptist some elias some jeremiah one of
[1:09:44] the prophets and he said to them
[1:09:45] whom say ye that i am right and he said
[1:09:48] thou art the christ the son
[1:09:51] thou art the christ the anointed one the
[1:09:53] messiah that word christ is another word
[1:09:55] for messiah in the greek okay
[1:09:56] yes thou art the messiah the son
[1:10:01] of the living god right notice he said
[1:10:03] son of the living god
[1:10:06] so what is the son who is the image of
[1:10:09] the invisible
[1:10:10] god who is jesus christ in the flesh he
[1:10:13] is the
[1:10:13] image of the invisible god
[1:10:17] and when i teach this uh to to do bible
[1:10:19] studies or whatever
[1:10:20] what i do is i i probably should have
[1:10:21] drew it out for you but i i take on a
[1:10:23] white board or whatever i take my little
[1:10:25] uh eraser marker and i go like this and
[1:10:28] i
[1:10:29] and i and i form a big g okay and that
[1:10:31] stands for god and i'll do a big g with
[1:10:33] dots
[1:10:33] because he's the invisible god i do big
[1:10:36] d boom boom
[1:10:37] boom boom boom boom and then i say
[1:10:39] that's before
[1:10:40] genesis 1 1 and then i put like a little
[1:10:43] speaking
[1:10:44] words or like little lines saying like
[1:10:46] that that invisible god is speaking
[1:10:48] and then i'll draw the pillar of fire in
[1:10:50] yellow or red okay
[1:10:52] yeah and i watched how people get to
[1:10:55] illuminate when they see it visually so
[1:10:58] i take then i take that big g
[1:11:00] the invisible god and then i put it
[1:11:02] inside the pillar of fire so now there's
[1:11:04] a pillar of fire or something visible
[1:11:06] something light
[1:11:07] a light a amber burning fire and now it
[1:11:10] has the big g with dots the invisible
[1:11:11] god in it and i say there
[1:11:13] you go now that's as simple as it gets
[1:11:15] and the one time i told the man said
[1:11:17] don't touch it don't erase that just
[1:11:19] leave it right there and for the next
[1:11:20] three weeks i come back and that same
[1:11:22] was that thing was just sitting right
[1:11:23] there on his white board
[1:11:25] and he just stared at it and he said now
[1:11:27] i understand
[1:11:29] amen but let me give you let me give you
[1:11:33] another testimony this
[1:11:34] and this is how it works i taught two
[1:11:37] brothers
[1:11:38] not related two brothers for three
[1:11:40] months
[1:11:43] on baptism it took almost two months to
[1:11:44] get through baptism because they could
[1:11:46] not see it oh brother so plain
[1:11:48] not in this age it is tough it is a
[1:11:51] baptism is a revelation of god but then
[1:11:54] when i started
[1:11:55] dealing with bat or godhead i drew that
[1:11:57] big g
[1:11:58] with the dots the invisible god and the
[1:12:00] pillar fire and i placed that big g in
[1:12:01] there right
[1:12:02] and all of a sudden they're like i
[1:12:03] believe in oneness we're oneness but
[1:12:05] guess what happened
[1:12:07] they went back to the denominational
[1:12:08] pastor and they did an interview with
[1:12:11] him
[1:12:12] multi-millionaire big shooter i mean you
[1:12:14] should see his house
[1:12:15] in mall me toledo news pluto area
[1:12:19] big you see his church it's a campus
[1:12:22] and they did an interview and the two of
[1:12:24] them sit right here and said oh pastor
[1:12:26] so-so now can you bring down trinity in
[1:12:28] between
[1:12:28] baptism or oneness and trinity and he's
[1:12:30] like he starts rattling off right
[1:12:32] and i met him in a parking lot as we
[1:12:33] always meet when i was in
[1:12:35] that time of my life we always met in
[1:12:37] the parking lot and me and him this
[1:12:38] brother here were sitting in a car
[1:12:40] and he said simon and this is after he's
[1:12:42] like whoa
[1:12:43] i see it i see it he's like simon i just
[1:12:46] had a
[1:12:46] talk with my pastor and i think i'm just
[1:12:48] going to hold off on what you're saying
[1:12:50] but i'm just going to stay with trinity
[1:12:51] for right now until i understand more
[1:12:52] things
[1:12:53] and yet i drew it i showed him and he
[1:12:55] was going when he when i drew he's like
[1:12:58] he saw it he saw the revelation
[1:13:01] but satan was able to come and take this
[1:13:04] out now let me show you the difference
[1:13:05] between teaching
[1:13:06] and the spirit revelation as a as he's
[1:13:09] he's telling me simon
[1:13:11] i just had a meeting with the pastor i'm
[1:13:12] going to give you i said
[1:13:15] did you record it he said yeah i
[1:13:16] recorded it look
[1:13:18] can you play it on your phone and he
[1:13:19] gave me his iphone and he started
[1:13:20] playing it because they recorded it
[1:13:21] and i'm listening to this pastor break
[1:13:23] this down i said

[1:13:40] that this guy is go i just taught him so
[1:13:42] simply godhead

[1:13:56] phone i said well that's fine you can do
[1:13:58] whatever you want

[1:14:05] oh you did and now i'm like well here's
[1:14:08] i said i mean everything's ordained you
[1:14:11] know
[1:14:11] i just said tell me your dream
[1:14:14] guess what his dream was about he said
[1:14:16] simon in my dream he was i was in a car
[1:14:18] and i was in a parking lot and i said oh
[1:14:20] this is for me
[1:14:21] because we were in a car in a parking
[1:14:22] lot right there
[1:14:24] i said okay tell me more he goes we were
[1:14:27] i was in a car in a parking lot he said
[1:14:28] i got in the car
[1:14:30] and across the parking lot was jesus he
[1:14:32] said
[1:14:33] and his body was normal he said but his
[1:14:35] head was all disfigured it was all
[1:14:37] deformed
[1:14:38] his teeth were shooting out this way and
[1:14:39] his eyes were all messed up his face was
[1:14:41] deformed the snack
[1:14:42] he said it was jesus but he didn't look
[1:14:45] right
[1:14:46] and he said i started walking towards
[1:14:47] jesus
[1:14:49] and as he approached christ christ then
[1:14:51] drew himself near to him
[1:14:53] and he said all of a sudden before he
[1:14:55] knew it he was like right here and he
[1:14:56] says jesus was right here he says
[1:14:58] and he has the world would say he was he
[1:15:00] was boss
[1:15:02] he was the main man he said and guess
[1:15:04] what cyan what he goes
[1:15:05] and his face was back to normal
[1:15:10] i said i know the interpretation he goes
[1:15:11] what i said i'll tell you what exactly
[1:15:13] what that means because what's that i
[1:15:14] said
[1:15:15] if you would just draw closer to jesus
[1:15:16] christ the godhead would be made plain i
[1:15:19] said what was deformed he said the god
[1:15:21] the head of god i said the godhead would
[1:15:23] be plain if you just draw close to
[1:15:25] christ
[1:15:26] and and and i and i was i wasn't even
[1:15:28] looking anyone said that i said if you
[1:15:30] would just draw close to him and he
[1:15:31] swore
[1:15:33] he was a cuss word i said watch your
[1:15:35] mouth i was i'm a little bit older quite
[1:15:36] a bit
[1:15:37] i said watch your mouth boy i turned and
[1:15:39] he's like this
[1:15:42] the holy ghost came down and took over
[1:15:45] his body for five minutes
[1:15:49] and in the midst of it he's going like
[1:15:50] this he couldn't move
[1:15:52] all he could move was his eyes and his
[1:15:54] hands start going
[1:15:56] and he was looking at me scared to death
[1:16:01] and i just thinking lord get him get him
[1:16:04] get him
[1:16:05] get him and as the anointing leaves
[1:16:09] and he started to decide what was it i
[1:16:11] said you would not
[1:16:12] listen to god's servant i've taught and
[1:16:15] i've taught
[1:16:16] and i've taught and i've shown you but
[1:16:18] now god had to come
[1:16:20] down and discern and break down your
[1:16:22] dream and
[1:16:23] vindicate it to you that there is only
[1:16:26] one person in the godhead
[1:16:29] and he quit going to that church at that
[1:16:31] time and i haven't seen him much since
[1:16:33] then
[1:16:34] but he said there's one god i said
[1:16:36] absolutely
[1:16:37] but that's the difference between a
[1:16:38] teaching and the holy ghost coming down
[1:16:40] and making it manifest
[1:16:42] vindicating a dream yes the
[1:16:44] interpretation
[1:16:45] was right he is the individual invis the
[1:16:48] image of the invisible god the firstborn
[1:16:50] of every creature right
[1:16:52] what was it in the beginning he was a
[1:16:53] light he was a light body but then in
[1:16:55] the first coming he was now
[1:16:56] flesh amen the logos the word of god was
[1:16:59] made flesh and then
[1:17:00] all of god came and dwelt within him
[1:17:01] correct now
[1:17:03] let's move here and then ii corinthians
[1:17:05] 4 verse 3 but if our gospel be hidden it
[1:17:07] is hidden in them that are
[1:17:09] lost and whom the god of this world has
[1:17:11] blinded the minds of them which believe
[1:17:12] not lest the light of the glory's gospel
[1:17:14] christ
[1:17:14] who is the image of god should shine
[1:17:17] unto them notice it calls him
[1:17:19] the image of god jesus christ let this
[1:17:22] by
[1:17:22] mind be in you which was also in christ
[1:17:24] jesus who being in the form
[1:17:27] of god amen
[1:17:30] if god had to choose the light body it
[1:17:32] was the logos
[1:17:33] if god had to choose a flesh body it was
[1:17:35] jesus christ that was his own
[1:17:37] personal body right who thought it not
[1:17:39] to be robbery to be equal with god
[1:17:40] but made himself no reputation and took
[1:17:42] upon him the form of a servant or more
[1:17:44] faith he changed himself right
[1:17:45] put on another mask as the prophet of
[1:17:47] god would express now here
[1:17:50] god who is sunday try some dry times in
[1:17:52] a diverse manner spake and time passed
[1:17:54] unto the fathers by the prophets
[1:17:56] hath in these last days spoken to us by
[1:17:58] his
[1:17:59] son who made appointed heir of all
[1:18:02] things by whom also he made the worlds
[1:18:04] who being the brightness of his glory
[1:18:05] the expressed image of his
[1:18:07] person singular amen it does not say in
[1:18:10] the express person of his person
[1:18:13] it says an image an image is something
[1:18:15] you can see amen something
[1:18:16] something that can be made manifest but
[1:18:18] not a separate person but just an
[1:18:20] image amen sure and upholding all things
[1:18:24] by the word of his power when he had by
[1:18:25] himself purged our sins sat down the
[1:18:27] right hand of the majesty on high amen
[1:18:30] now let's continue here
[1:18:33] this is a powerful scripture but i can't
[1:18:35] find this years and years and years
[1:18:38] ago one of the first scriptures you
[1:18:39] found when you come in the message
[1:18:40] proving the godhead
[1:18:42] is there does the bible declare three
[1:18:44] persons plural is there ever an s
[1:18:46] on the after person or person no no sir
[1:18:49] but notice here
[1:18:50] job who knew god who was perfect before
[1:18:52] god that god knew job and god job knew
[1:18:54] god
[1:18:54] all that they would gather all together
[1:18:57] would altogether hold your peace and it
[1:18:59] should be your wisdom this is job
[1:19:00] speaking
[1:19:01] here now my reasoning hearken to the
[1:19:03] pleading of my lips
[1:19:04] will ye speak wickedly for god and talk
[1:19:07] deceitfully for him
[1:19:08] will you accept his person
[1:19:11] job is a prophet here is god almighty
[1:19:14] right
[1:19:15] he says will you accept this person will
[1:19:17] you contend for god
[1:19:18] it is good that you should uh us it is
[1:19:21] good that he
[1:19:22] should search you out or as one man mock
[1:19:24] another so
[1:19:25] uh do you so knock him he will
[1:19:28] surely reprove you if you do secretly
[1:19:31] accept
[1:19:32] persons that could be other people or it
[1:19:37] could mean
[1:19:38] a prophecy of a trinity hmm
[1:19:42] because i'll say like this i went to
[1:19:44] many people who go to trinitarian
[1:19:46] churches and i break down what they
[1:19:47] believe and they said well i don't
[1:19:48] believe that
[1:19:49] listen you're not a trinitarian and they
[1:19:51] look at me
[1:19:53] and then you can see they're counting
[1:19:54] the cost yeah i said hey
[1:19:57] i'll do bible studies i'll show you from
[1:19:58] genesis revelations this is one person
[1:20:00] and they're just stairs you're like
[1:20:01] counting man i'm gonna
[1:20:04] what about what's my girlfriend say or
[1:20:05] what's my boyfriend gonna say what's uh
[1:20:06] my mom and dad
[1:20:07] uh they're not saying it but you can see
[1:20:10] what they're thinking
[1:20:11] i just witnessed baptism about four
[1:20:13] maybe six months ago to
[1:20:15] a group of brothers and they're not in
[1:20:17] the message
[1:20:18] and the one guy as i'm breaking down
[1:20:20] baptism alone
[1:20:22] he is like oh he's like he's like simon
[1:20:24] they're gonna kill you for this
[1:20:25] do you know what you're doing you know
[1:20:26] what you're teaching they're not gonna
[1:20:28] accept this and i'm thinking
[1:20:29] wow he knows exactly he's counting the
[1:20:32] cost
[1:20:33] he he said he said they're going to kill
[1:20:34] me for this
[1:20:36] bad just bat not godhead just baptism
[1:20:39] my wife was there he was blowing up on
[1:20:41] me he's like shot dude
[1:20:42] man we got this is kind of dangerous
[1:20:44] dude i said do you see it he's like man
[1:20:46] it's right there it's like
[1:20:47] what you were scared for were you gonna
[1:20:48] make a move are you ready to baptize
[1:20:50] well man that's
[1:20:51] and he made me talk to his mom
[1:20:54] he won't even deal with me he said you
[1:20:55] talk to my mom and i said i
[1:20:58] miss or mrs and say why what you talking
[1:21:02] about my boys and this and this i well
[1:21:04] would you like a bible study they always
[1:21:07] back off because i
[1:21:08] i i always make myself available
[1:21:12] god knows i would be there yeah i think
[1:21:14] i've missed one bible say my entire life
[1:21:16] and god forgive me it was not alignment
[1:21:18] i just i had a dentist appointment i
[1:21:20] shouldn't i should just cancel that
[1:21:21] appointment and just went there and just
[1:21:22] but i don't know what happened that
[1:21:23] person said god forgive me
[1:21:26] am i so now so what is so important with
[1:21:29] this here
[1:21:31] in matthew 16 verse 13 and these things
[1:21:34] now notice jesus said who do you say
[1:21:35] that i the son of man
[1:21:36] am some say baptist john baptist or
[1:21:38] jeremiah prophet and he said to him but
[1:21:40] who say ye that i am
[1:21:42] right why is it so important he says and
[1:21:44] simon peter said thou
[1:21:46] art the christ the son of the living god
[1:21:50] this is a powerful this is dealing with
[1:21:53] godhead this is one of the capstone
[1:21:54] revelations okay
[1:21:56] amen he says and i say to thee thou art
[1:21:58] peter and upon this rock i will build my
[1:22:00] church and the gates of hell shall not
[1:22:01] prevail against it right
[1:22:03] he gives the keys to the kingdom
[1:22:04] whatever's who bind will buy and they'll
[1:22:05] loose loose
[1:22:06] then he charged uh that they would tell
[1:22:08] no man that he was jesus the christ
[1:22:10] right
[1:22:10] yes now what is this
[1:22:14] not say my church now my church has
[1:22:16] nothing to do with it's an
[1:22:17] individual one person all hells against
[1:22:20] this
[1:22:21] teaching amen what are you saying
[1:22:23] someone that has
[1:22:24] that jesus christ is the son of the
[1:22:26] living god this is
[1:22:27] a individual revelation
[1:22:30] this is an individual thought these are
[1:22:33] individual
[1:22:34] scriptures that we need to pull from
[1:22:36] this is this is a
[1:22:38] it's not to everybody this is to only
[1:22:41] the bride this is
[1:22:42] only to the elect jesus said now peter
[1:22:45] you and john and all the rest of people
[1:22:47] you've got the revelation now the whole
[1:22:49] church is saved
[1:22:50] no see that's what makes you so precious
[1:22:54] we've all came out of other things to
[1:22:57] know these things
[1:22:59] and now realistically we could say
[1:23:02] we have the revelation of jesus christ
[1:23:05] sure it was to him personally i say unto
[1:23:08] thee thee
[1:23:08] not to them to thee thou art peter upon
[1:23:11] this rock i'll build my church and the
[1:23:12] word peter means stone
[1:23:14] stone means confessed one or separated
[1:23:16] one so the true revelation of jesus
[1:23:18] christ is will come to
[1:23:20] people who will separate themselves to
[1:23:22] truth the spirit of truth amen
[1:23:25] amen now let's continue on here
[1:23:28] upon a certain stone upon a certain
[1:23:29] thing a called out church
[1:23:31] upon this stone upon this revelation
[1:23:33] flesh and blood never revealed it unto
[1:23:34] you but upon this revelation
[1:23:36] this called out group i'll build my
[1:23:38] church in them and all the gates of hell
[1:23:41] will never be able to withstand it
[1:23:47] so what is he saying that all all that
[1:23:50] is all
[1:23:50] the backing of hell will be against this
[1:23:52] revelation
[1:23:53] right he doesn't say that again about
[1:23:57] any other revelation in the scripture
[1:24:00] that hell is against who jesus christ is
[1:24:06] because by foreknowledge he wrote the
[1:24:08] bible a certain way
[1:24:10] and made it look like it could be
[1:24:11] trinity but then he wrote it and
[1:24:13] revealed that it was one person in the
[1:24:15] godhead
[1:24:16] god allowed those words to be written a
[1:24:17] certain way to deceive some and
[1:24:20] and reveal to others yes
[1:24:24] that's only to the left but the
[1:24:26] revelation come through the blood see
[1:24:28] through jesus christ who is the blood of
[1:24:29] god
[1:24:30] created blood in the womb of mary and
[1:24:31] paul knew him by revelations
[1:24:33] that's how we know him today is only the
[1:24:35] only way we could know him is by what
[1:24:37] the revelation of jesus christ now
[1:24:40] science pretty simple absolutely now
[1:24:44] when jesus said who do i who do you
[1:24:47] would you say that i am
[1:24:48] peter said thou art the christ son of
[1:24:50] god now notice here the
[1:24:52] the the same thing is coming here
[1:24:56] he's at the judgment seat here jesus
[1:24:58] christ in front of the
[1:24:59] scribes and pharisees actually in front
[1:25:00] of the high priest and notice they
[1:25:03] do not recognize who he is they don't
[1:25:04] even know who he is they want to know
[1:25:06] who he is
[1:25:07] how did peter know who he is and these
[1:25:09] did not
[1:25:10] see this is almost undescribable this is
[1:25:13] you can almost not even explain this
[1:25:16] because it's so supernatural
[1:25:20] it is a spiritual thing that's it that's
[1:25:23] the only thing we say is it's by the
[1:25:24] holy ghost is by god himself
[1:25:28] look at verse 62 and then and the high
[1:25:30] priest arose and said to him answers
[1:25:31] thou nothing
[1:25:32] what is it is it which these witnesses
[1:25:35] against thee
[1:25:36] but jesus held his peace and notice and
[1:25:39] the high priest
[1:25:40] answered and said to him i journey by
[1:25:42] the living
[1:25:43] god now he went
[1:25:46] the right approach
[1:25:50] because he knew the high priest knew
[1:25:51] there was only one living god
[1:25:54] so he says i jury by the living god the
[1:25:56] thou tell us whether thou be the christ
[1:25:58] the son of god but notice in this
[1:26:01] section
[1:26:01] this portion this gospel in matthew he's
[1:26:04] jesus said to him
[1:26:05] thou hast said nevertheless i say unto
[1:26:09] you hereafter he shall see the son of
[1:26:10] man coming on the right hand of power
[1:26:12] and coming in the clouds and then the
[1:26:13] pride priest ran as close as he has
[1:26:15] spoken blasphemy but what did he really
[1:26:16] say and i like how it says here
[1:26:18] in mark in verse chapter 14 and he held
[1:26:21] his peace and said nothing again the
[1:26:22] high priest asked him and said
[1:26:24] art thou the christ the son of the
[1:26:26] blessed and jesus said
[1:26:27] i am yes
[1:26:31] he revealed to them they had to pull the
[1:26:35] revelation out of god god revealed to
[1:26:37] him and they still
[1:26:38] did not receive it that's just like cain
[1:26:42] but paul but god actually had the jesus
[1:26:44] had to pull the revelation out of peter
[1:26:46] and peter gave them the answer
[1:26:51] amen jesus revealed to him that he is
[1:26:56] he says now now they could be right but
[1:26:58] to me both of them's wrong as a bond it
[1:27:00] was upon the spiritual revelation of who
[1:27:02] he was flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:27:03] this peter
[1:27:04] unto you peter but my father which is in
[1:27:06] heaven hath revealed it and upon this
[1:27:07] rock the revelation of who he is upon
[1:27:09] the revelation
[1:27:10] he is the word the whole upon this rock
[1:27:13] i'll build my church the gates of hell
[1:27:15] it showed the gates of hell would be
[1:27:17] against it
[1:27:18] right yes i was talking to a gentleman
[1:27:22] that long ago a christian scholar and a
[1:27:23] gentleman
[1:27:24] and he said brother branham we refuse
[1:27:26] all revelations god have mercy we want
[1:27:28] to be open to all
[1:27:29] revelations that come from the spirit of
[1:27:32] god
[1:27:33] everything we have right now has come as
[1:27:35] all over comic con comic con what
[1:27:36] because we're waiting for more amen
[1:27:39] lord all that we need give it to us amen
[1:27:42] and it'll come to you forgot the holy
[1:27:45] ghost
[1:27:46] i said then you have to refuse jesus
[1:27:48] christ for he is the revelation of god
[1:27:50] god revealed in human flesh unless you
[1:27:52] see it you're
[1:27:53] lost unless you see it you're lost
[1:27:58] see how dangerous that trinity is
[1:28:01] because everyone i meet on the job site
[1:28:03] that's christian
[1:28:05] oh jesus christ is the son of god he's
[1:28:06] the son of god a catholic just told me
[1:28:08] that
[1:28:09] but if you do not have the revelation of
[1:28:11] what you're saying they'll be lost
[1:28:15] sure now let me show you how powerful
[1:28:18] this is
[1:28:21] then martha as soon as he heard that
[1:28:23] jesus was coming went met him
[1:28:25] but mary was sat still in the house then
[1:28:28] said martha jesus
[1:28:29] lord if thou had been here my brother
[1:28:31] would not notice the faith of her
[1:28:33] if you have been here lord he was sick
[1:28:35] for so long but you would have healed
[1:28:37] him
[1:28:37] amen and jesus just like just trying to
[1:28:40] contain himself
[1:28:42] oh this girl got faith lord of god yeah
[1:28:45] that's what i'm talking about
[1:28:47] that's why i came in this hour i'd find
[1:28:48] martha
[1:28:50] yeah sure i mean man
[1:28:54] his best buddy just died when his
[1:28:56] buddies just died one of the one of his
[1:28:57] disciples one of us
[1:28:58] the one that he just like johnny loved
[1:29:01] him
[1:29:02] he came saw faith right there
[1:29:06] and notice she says but i now but now i
[1:29:09] know but now
[1:29:10] but i know that even now whatsoever thou
[1:29:13] will ask of god
[1:29:15] god will give it thee look at the faith
[1:29:17] behind this
[1:29:19] and jesus said unto her my brother shall
[1:29:22] rise so
[1:29:22] so she already had faith that even right
[1:29:24] now whatever you know she was not
[1:29:26] expecting
[1:29:27] what was gonna happen but maybe
[1:29:29] something else he would
[1:29:31] say and mark said to him i know that he
[1:29:34] shall rise again in the
[1:29:35] resurrection at the last day and he said
[1:29:38] to her i am the resurrection
[1:29:39] and the life and he that believeth to me
[1:29:41] though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:29:42] and whosoever liveth
[1:29:43] and believeth in me shall never die
[1:29:45] believeth thou this and she said
[1:29:47] yea lord i believe thou art the christ
[1:29:50] the son of the living god
[1:29:53] she had the same revelation the same
[1:29:55] revelation was revealed
[1:29:57] to her from the father as he's as he's
[1:30:00] talking to the father
[1:30:01] through the body through jesus christ
[1:30:03] the flesh and it came to her and she
[1:30:05] spoke it
[1:30:09] she forward frightened she forfeited all
[1:30:11] that she had
[1:30:12] all rights to her to recognize the word
[1:30:15] of god manifested right before
[1:30:16] he said i am the resurrection the life
[1:30:18] he that believeth me though we're dead
[1:30:19] shall he yet shall he live
[1:30:20] whosoever believe me in me shall never
[1:30:23] die believe us all this
[1:30:24] and there was one little more clause
[1:30:26] that she hadn't come in line
[1:30:28] with see he just wanted to hear her say
[1:30:32] thou art the christ in other words the
[1:30:35] revelation of who your god
[1:30:37] in flesh
[1:30:42] yeah lord i believe thou art the christ
[1:30:45] the son of living god oh brother
[1:30:46] everything was ready to
[1:30:48] spark off right then see you already had
[1:30:51] faith trying faith
[1:30:52] but now you have faith but who am i who
[1:30:54] am i thou art the christ the son of
[1:30:56] living god
[1:30:57] that word all of god trapped into what
[1:30:59] his chosen
[1:31:00] vessel is chosen body amen chosen what
[1:31:03] i'm hiding right here in the lamb of god
[1:31:06] amen
[1:31:06] sure lord now notice
[1:31:10] here in first john 4 1 believe it
[1:31:13] beloved
[1:31:13] believe not every spirit but try the
[1:31:15] spirits whether it be of god whether it
[1:31:16] be
[1:31:17] because many false prophets are going
[1:31:19] out into the world hereby you know the
[1:31:20] spirit of god
[1:31:21] every spirit that confesses that christ
[1:31:23] is coming the flesh is of god oh yeah
[1:31:27] how many ministers in this message that
[1:31:29] taught oneness understood godhead could
[1:31:31] teach at the back of hand
[1:31:32] had anointed services and now they're
[1:31:34] going on the world
[1:31:35] i know one particularly master teacher
[1:31:38] master preacher
[1:31:40] back to trinity and yet for years he
[1:31:43] preached that god is one
[1:31:44] one person and the logos came down and
[1:31:47] god dwelled in the logos the pillar of
[1:31:48] fire and how they were one and this and
[1:31:50] this and this and whatever however and
[1:31:51] he's back to trinity right now did he
[1:31:53] really have a revelation
[1:31:56] no he never really had a revelation he
[1:31:58] had carnal knowledge intellectual
[1:32:00] conception
[1:32:05] believe in eternal hell believe in who
[1:32:08] knows what
[1:32:10] how many ministers have have said
[1:32:12] they've taught this
[1:32:14] well he's got the spirit of god just
[1:32:16] let's just wait and try the spirits
[1:32:19] yes amen the bible says mark the end of
[1:32:21] a man
[1:32:22] yes you know thou believers that there
[1:32:23] is one god that will do as well the
[1:32:24] devils believe
[1:32:25] also and tremble the scripture says amen
[1:32:28] now so where do they get most of their
[1:32:31] trinitarian doctrines from right here
[1:32:34] then come with jesus from galilee to
[1:32:35] jordan unto john to be baptized him now
[1:32:37] remember i got some pictures coming here
[1:32:39] but john verbatim saying i need to be
[1:32:41] baptized of thee and cometh down to me
[1:32:42] and jesus
[1:32:43] answering some suffering not to be so
[1:32:44] for for thus it uh becometh us to
[1:32:47] fulfill all righteous then he suffered
[1:32:49] him and jesus when he was baptized went
[1:32:50] straightway out of the water
[1:32:51] so here's the sun the body going down
[1:32:54] getting baptized
[1:32:55] so we see the image right here what they
[1:32:57] would call the man who we know is the
[1:32:58] man
[1:33:00] and though the heavens were open to him
[1:33:01] and he saw the spirit of god descending
[1:33:03] like a dove
[1:33:04] and now that they've seen three they're
[1:33:05] two he says and a lightning upon him
[1:33:08] and lo a voice from heaven saying this
[1:33:10] is my beloved son in whom i'm well
[1:33:12] pleased and that's how that's the
[1:33:13] majority of what they get in revelation
[1:33:15] is three look we see three
[1:33:16] right here okay
[1:33:20] that's when i brought the science then
[1:33:23] discover magazine
[1:33:24] june 2005 issue about 80 years ago
[1:33:28] scientists
[1:33:29] proved that it is possible to be in two
[1:33:31] locations
[1:33:32] or more at the same time
[1:33:36] at least for the atomic or subatomic
[1:33:38] particles says the electron
[1:33:40] for such tiny objects the world is
[1:33:42] governed by a madhouse of physical laws
[1:33:44] known as quantum mechanics
[1:33:46] and if quantum particles quantum
[1:33:50] material can travel and be in one
[1:33:53] location and more than
[1:33:54] one more than one location at one time
[1:33:55] how much is more can the god almighty
[1:34:00] and jesus christ can dwell in me and you
[1:34:03] and you and you
[1:34:04] and you do you all at the same time
[1:34:08] and yet he's one person what do you do
[1:34:09] with the big day of pentecost he divided
[1:34:11] himself the father says put over here a
[1:34:13] little bit there there
[1:34:13] all around he's what the same god
[1:34:20] jesus christ is one person and he can
[1:34:22] dwell up more than one he can't be
[1:34:24] everywhere
[1:34:25] but he can be at more than one place at
[1:34:26] one time
[1:34:28] hey man sure i witness to a guy like
[1:34:31] this right in the funeral he called me
[1:34:32] he wanted a debate right in a funeral
[1:34:33] home
[1:34:34] he come up to me like this a little bit
[1:34:36] told me he put his face just like this
[1:34:38] and i waited for him to say something
[1:34:39] and i unleash every patriot missile i
[1:34:41] had
[1:34:41] and he walked away i was like thank you
[1:34:45] let's get into it augustine on the
[1:34:47] trinity if you deny the trinity you will
[1:34:49] lose your soul
[1:34:53] if you try and explain it you'll lose
[1:34:55] your mind that's exactly right
[1:34:58] i believe that second part first part i
[1:35:01] don't believe
[1:35:02] but you can take that last one to your
[1:35:04] back
[1:35:06] that's right now brother jesse and for
[1:35:10] those who've went to the
[1:35:11] uh libraries and such things we have all
[1:35:13] the we have histories
[1:35:14] that say this exact same thing many
[1:35:16] honest trinitarians will admit
[1:35:19] uh uh however the what uh note that uh
[1:35:22] the encyclopedia can't britannica states
[1:35:24] neither the word trinity
[1:35:25] nor the explicit doctrine appears in new
[1:35:28] testament
[1:35:29] the doctrine developed gradually over
[1:35:31] several centuries and through many
[1:35:32] controversies and we're going to show
[1:35:34] those to you amen amen and i like this
[1:35:37] in acts 17
[1:35:38] 21 this is amazing how this
[1:35:42] and paul stood in the midst and we're
[1:35:43] getting to some stuff here okay
[1:35:45] i hope this is going to be blessing this
[1:35:46] is this to me this was a revelation when
[1:35:48] i taught this to my little brother he
[1:35:49] was like
[1:35:50] absolutely so i want to be i want to
[1:35:52] show you what's hidden behind the words
[1:35:53] okay
[1:35:54] the real meanings then paul stood in the
[1:35:57] midst of mars hill and said
[1:35:58] he men of athens i perceive that and
[1:36:00] then all things you are too suspicious
[1:36:03] for i passed by and beheld your
[1:36:04] devotions and i found an altar which is
[1:36:06] scripted
[1:36:07] to the unknown god you know who that was
[1:36:09] really too
[1:36:10] that was to jesus christ but they did
[1:36:12] not know him they was not revealed
[1:36:14] to them so god sent one of his
[1:36:16] messengers and started revealing who it
[1:36:18] was amen
[1:36:20] he says whom therefore you ignorantly
[1:36:23] worship
[1:36:24] him declare i unto you god that made the
[1:36:27] world and the things therein
[1:36:28] seeing that he is the lord of heaven and
[1:36:30] earth dwelt not in temples made with
[1:36:32] hands now the prophet of god paul had to
[1:36:34] discern
[1:36:34] that this altar to the unknown god was
[1:36:37] to
[1:36:38] his god amen by the holy ghost it was
[1:36:40] revealed to him that what this
[1:36:42] they're worshiping him but they don't
[1:36:43] know who he is they're worshiping other
[1:36:45] gods but they have one specific set
[1:36:47] aside for him
[1:36:48] and not only is he an unknown god but he
[1:36:50] has a name amen
[1:36:52] it's the lord jesus christ
[1:36:55] he says neither is he's neither
[1:36:56] worshiped with men's hands as though he
[1:36:58] needed anything
[1:36:59] seeth he giveth uh to all life breath
[1:37:01] and things
[1:37:02] and he hath made one blood all nations
[1:37:04] one blood all nations of men
[1:37:06] for to dwell on all the face of the
[1:37:08] earth and determine the times before
[1:37:10] they appointed
[1:37:11] uh and the bounds of their inhabitation
[1:37:14] that they should seek the lord if
[1:37:16] happily they might feel after him and
[1:37:18] find him
[1:37:20] though he be not far from every one of
[1:37:22] us now
[1:37:24] look what it said next for in him we
[1:37:28] live
[1:37:29] and we move and have our being amen
[1:37:33] as certain also of your own poets have
[1:37:35] said before we are
[1:37:36] also his offspring
[1:37:41] now he's dealing with you as being the
[1:37:43] offspring of god
[1:37:46] and if god is three that would make you
[1:37:47] three i debate with the theologian
[1:37:49] theologian one time and he had
[1:37:51] he was uh greek and his uh hebrew all
[1:37:53] over me i couldn't even i can't fight
[1:37:55] that i can't i'm not a theologian i
[1:37:56] can't fight that
[1:37:57] so at the end of the thing i said well
[1:37:58] let me let me place you in a box i'm
[1:38:00] thinking myself i said i'm just going to
[1:38:02] ask you a couple questions
[1:38:03] okay i said are you three persons if
[1:38:05] you've got three persons and where made
[1:38:06] an image are you three persons he said
[1:38:07] yes i said
[1:38:08] i looked at the brother i said there we
[1:38:10] go so you're three people he's like yes
[1:38:11] sir
[1:38:12] okay and i went on with other questions
[1:38:14] this night and i just wanted to state so
[1:38:16] i could show this brother that they
[1:38:17] believe they are literally three people
[1:38:19] okay
[1:38:22] that's all like that's how you fight him
[1:38:23] i mean yep you're three okay
[1:38:26] you said you are three then all right
[1:38:28] guess what i'm one person
[1:38:31] now for as much then as we are the
[1:38:33] offspring of god
[1:38:36] if we are the offspring of god
[1:38:39] if we were there in genesis 1 and 26 and
[1:38:42] 27
[1:38:43] 28 if we were there before the
[1:38:44] foundation of the world in his mind if
[1:38:46] we really express the eternal thoughts
[1:38:47] of god
[1:38:48] if we are the offspring of god we ought
[1:38:51] not to think that godhead is like unto
[1:38:53] gold or silver deity
[1:38:57] redemption or stone
[1:39:00] graven by art and man's
[1:39:04] device right yes and the times of his
[1:39:07] ignorance god in the in
[1:39:08] in the times of this ignorance god
[1:39:10] winked at but now commands
[1:39:12] all men everywhere to repent right yeah
[1:39:15] now we've had to go through that same
[1:39:16] process again
[1:39:16] coming out of the catholic church
[1:39:18] reformation but notice how i
[1:39:20] highlighted graven by art and man's
[1:39:24] device
[1:39:26] that word graven means charmand
[1:39:29] charagma means a scratchy or an
[1:39:33] etching that a stamp
[1:39:36] sculptured figure graven a mark a mark
[1:39:41] that word right here graven by
[1:39:44] art it means a mark which is also the
[1:39:48] same word used for the mark of the beast
[1:39:52] so why would he list three things gold
[1:39:54] silver and stone
[1:39:56] three separate things right
[1:40:00] we all know what this is that is your
[1:40:03] graven image that is the trinity symbol
[1:40:07] here it is on uh well i can actually
[1:40:10] whoa
[1:40:13] i actually have this track at home i
[1:40:15] gave one actually to a brother in
[1:40:16] thailand he saw it and he was like whoa
[1:40:18] can i have that
[1:40:19] take it now i have brother camps because
[1:40:21] he wasn't using it so
[1:40:24] this is your trinity doctrine right here
[1:40:26] okay now
[1:40:29] father son holy spirit right this is
[1:40:32] more of the triquetra now
[1:40:33] and now they break it down to what they
[1:40:34] actually mean
[1:40:36] well this is pretty mysterious oh what
[1:40:38] are you really saying here this is what
[1:40:40] they're saying right here
[1:40:42] now there's truth in here and there's
[1:40:44] lies in here right right
[1:40:46] father father son holy ghost right
[1:40:50] i don't have that on there i guess i
[1:40:51] could here we go there it is right there
[1:40:54] float up all right
[1:40:58] and i was teaching this in thailand i
[1:40:59] said now father
[1:41:01] son and holy spirit notice how it says
[1:41:03] father is god we all believe that
[1:41:05] the son is god i believe that the holy
[1:41:07] spirit is god absolutely we have no
[1:41:09] problems there no calls close nothing
[1:41:11] but notice they say the father is
[1:41:14] not the holy spirit what was the one
[1:41:17] word in the beginning that was used for
[1:41:19] a lie
[1:41:19] thou shalt not surely die what did cain
[1:41:22] say i know
[1:41:23] not where my brother is and they use not
[1:41:26] as well
[1:41:27] father is not the holy spirit the holy
[1:41:30] spirit is not the father
[1:41:31] the father is not the son the son is not
[1:41:33] the father the son is not the holy
[1:41:34] spirit the holy spirit is not the father
[1:41:38] now what's all we gotta do is erase not
[1:41:41] and now we have truth now we have truth
[1:41:44] you take that not out it's an absolute
[1:41:46] true statement right
[1:41:48] because the son is the father the father
[1:41:50] is the son the holy ghost is the son the
[1:41:51] son is the
[1:41:53] father all in one sure now that's it
[1:41:56] now what's the danger about this and
[1:41:59] there's what they really
[1:42:00] literally believe three people in the
[1:42:03] godhead
[1:42:03] three entities right
[1:42:07] three three people literally three gods
[1:42:11] three gods that's what trinitarians
[1:42:13] believe
[1:42:14] when you are witnessing to your brothers
[1:42:15] and sisters who are in denomination
[1:42:17] try to explain this to them what do you
[1:42:21] really believe who is god
[1:42:24] does it make sense no makes no sense
[1:42:28] now why is it so dangerous as i'm sure
[1:42:30] brother jesse's taught this
[1:42:31] there's your triquetra follows the holy
[1:42:34] ghost
[1:42:35] and we see the 666 made right out of
[1:42:38] that symbol
[1:42:39] right the devil is a mastermind we also
[1:42:41] see it on the catholic church the pope's
[1:42:42] head there
[1:42:43] uh you know the trinity and all sorts
[1:42:46] all those sort of things and now uh
[1:42:49] let's move on here now we go back to the
[1:42:51] scripture so
[1:42:52] that's graven by art we're we're not
[1:42:54] supposed to make an image on the christ
[1:42:56] right
[1:42:56] under god but notice it says and
[1:42:59] man's device what does that mean
[1:43:03] man's device now we're at about
[1:43:06] an hour right now and i'm almost done
[1:43:10] that word man's device it means to
[1:43:13] deliberation a deliberation a thought a
[1:43:16] device a thought
[1:43:17] to be in spirited that is to ponder to
[1:43:20] think about
[1:43:23] man's device so what that scripture say
[1:43:27] for we then as as we are the offspring
[1:43:30] of god we ought not to think that the
[1:43:31] godhead is like into three separate
[1:43:32] things
[1:43:34] graven by art and man's thinking
[1:43:38] thinking craven by r to make a
[1:43:42] trinity symbol or man's device
[1:43:45] now why would it mean that the word
[1:43:47] device means thought or thinking
[1:43:49] to ponder
[1:43:53] because it took 462 years to get the
[1:43:56] trinity doctrine
[1:43:58] out of seven councils their top seven
[1:44:00] councils
[1:44:02] number one nia council that's where uh
[1:44:04] the church in rome fell
[1:44:06] and what was their thing at that time
[1:44:08] the trinity doctrine was adopted as
[1:44:11] truth but then they had a question is
[1:44:14] the sun
[1:44:14] eternal and they had to think on that
[1:44:16] for 50 more years till the next council
[1:44:20] and they had to form a doctrine they
[1:44:22] just could not understand god through
[1:44:24] the scriptures
[1:44:26] constantly one is their question was is
[1:44:29] the holy spirit the third
[1:44:32] person
[1:44:36] the next one ephesus the council of
[1:44:37] ephesus was mary
[1:44:39] mary the bearer of christ divine nature
[1:44:44] we're dealing with godhead remember
[1:44:46] she's co-mediatrix coreydentics
[1:44:48] lady she is the uh
[1:44:52] immaculate recep conception the
[1:44:54] immaculate conception is not jesus
[1:44:56] christ according to catholic church it
[1:44:57] is mary was born virgin too
[1:45:04] ephesus was mary the bearer of christ
[1:45:06] bearer of christ divine nature as well
[1:45:10] could she have something to do with
[1:45:11] salvation
[1:45:13] next over 100 years or more chancellor
[1:45:16] dawn or whatever how you say that
[1:45:18] did christ bless you did christ have two
[1:45:21] one or two natures
[1:45:22] and how now that was revealed in our day
[1:45:25] but said he's what christ had it looked
[1:45:27] like he had dual personalities
[1:45:30] because the mystery is that jesus christ
[1:45:33] was both
[1:45:34] fully god and fully man
[1:45:37] the god was inside of him but that flesh
[1:45:40] had a man's spirit
[1:45:41] and a man flesh and all that
[1:45:45] and that's why he would say one thing
[1:45:47] one way and then say thing
[1:45:49] another way because sometimes god
[1:45:51] himself would speak through it
[1:45:53] and that would be the god on the inside
[1:45:55] the middle god and then sometimes the
[1:45:56] flesh would
[1:45:58] say things as well yes we talked about
[1:46:01] uh
[1:46:02] lazarus and the bible says jesus swept
[1:46:03] was that god weeping or is that the
[1:46:06] flesh man
[1:46:06] that was the flesh man that's right and
[1:46:09] they're reading these scriptures way
[1:46:11] back then and they could not put it
[1:46:12] together
[1:46:15] did christ have one or two natures and
[1:46:18] how
[1:46:18] they don't even say god because he think
[1:46:21] that's the second person trinity the
[1:46:23] second person trinity have two natures
[1:46:24] or one
[1:46:27] then he got four constantinople two how
[1:46:30] did we
[1:46:30] and how do we can we interpret dual
[1:46:32] natures without dividing christ
[1:46:34] in two
[1:46:38] constantinople three did christ have one
[1:46:40] have one or two wills
[1:46:42] sorry i forgot to eat one or two wills
[1:46:46] because he didn't want to die but yet he
[1:46:48] wanted to die because it was the
[1:46:49] father's will so did he have two wills
[1:46:50] or one
[1:46:54] constantinople through uh niacia 2
[1:46:57] can icons of christ be worshipped and
[1:47:00] how
[1:47:01] and this through these 462 years of
[1:47:05] counsel these are just the top ones
[1:47:07] look what they're talking about
[1:47:13] think not the godhead is like in a
[1:47:15] silver gold or stone
[1:47:17] graven by art and man's device
[1:47:21] in one split second peter said thou art
[1:47:23] the christ the son of the living god
[1:47:25] and jesus said that's exactly right
[1:47:28] absolutely no studying no counsel
[1:47:31] [Laughter]
[1:47:34] no 462 years one second
[1:47:37] [Laughter]
[1:47:39] and that's just how fast god can change
[1:47:41] us amen amen
[1:47:45] hey man if god i'll say this if remember
[1:47:47] what was that great question
[1:47:48] in the church book when when the bride
[1:47:51] understands who she is and that she can
[1:47:53] do the great works
[1:47:54] did you know the revelation of jesus
[1:47:56] christ came in one second
[1:47:58] when is the revelation of who we are
[1:47:59] gonna come it could come in one second
[1:48:01] just like that yeah
[1:48:03] oh help this game i don't think i was
[1:48:06] thinking about that there we go
[1:48:08] now why is it so important why am i even
[1:48:10] touching this
[1:48:13] because there is a need for it yes and
[1:48:16] if this be the greatest
[1:48:17] capstone revelation
[1:48:21] and he gave some apostles and some
[1:48:24] prophets
[1:48:25] some evangelists and some pastors and
[1:48:29] teachers for the perfecting of the
[1:48:32] saints
[1:48:33] for who's it for who's brother jesse
[1:48:35] four who am i for who are these
[1:48:36] ministers that get behind her for
[1:48:37] you for the bride for the laity we
[1:48:41] are your servants yes the bible calls
[1:48:45] them gifts
[1:48:46] for you so we all what for the
[1:48:49] perfecting of the saints for the work of
[1:48:51] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:48:52] body of christ
[1:48:53] till we all notice what come to the
[1:48:56] unity of the faith
[1:48:58] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:49:03] so the purpose of the five fold is to
[1:49:05] reveal to you
[1:49:06] who jesus christ really is amen
[1:49:10] is he a second person is he a third
[1:49:12] person does he have two dual natures
[1:49:16] or you just have dual personalities the
[1:49:17] prophet said because he was both god and
[1:49:19] man at one time
[1:49:20] was it god in the flesh was who was he
[1:49:24] this the true fivefold ministry should
[1:49:26] be able to teach
[1:49:27] by the grace of god and make it simple
[1:49:29] who jesus christ was
[1:49:32] amen and notice he talks about
[1:49:36] unity of faith and knowledge of son of
[1:49:38] god unto a perfect man unto the measure
[1:49:40] of the stature of the fullness of christ
[1:49:42] that we henceforth need to be no more
[1:49:43] children toast to and fro carried about
[1:49:45] with every wind of doctrine notice where
[1:49:46] the winds of doctrine is going to come
[1:49:48] where's the gates of hell going to try
[1:49:49] and stop the unity of the faith and the
[1:49:51] knowledge of the son of god
[1:49:54] and cunning craftiness whereby they lay
[1:49:56] white they lie and wait
[1:49:58] to deceive wiles of the devil amen
[1:50:02] yes praise god he says in some time the
[1:50:05] capstone will return the head of it all
[1:50:07] and receive the bride unto himself
[1:50:09] which the woman took him from is from a
[1:50:11] man apart
[1:50:13] took from the man a part of the man
[1:50:15] every genes of man in the
[1:50:17] man is in the woman that makes the woman
[1:50:19] and that's why the word of god is
[1:50:20] in the church that's what makes the
[1:50:22] church the bride
[1:50:24] non-denominational that's the devil
[1:50:26] every one of my i ain't calling the
[1:50:27] people in there that
[1:50:28] they are poor deceived people like jesus
[1:50:30] said blind leading
[1:50:31] the blind right he says so it's christ
[1:50:35] expressing himself in the individual
[1:50:37] whether he's intellectual or not
[1:50:39] whether he known as abc's half the
[1:50:40] apostles didn't know it that's right but
[1:50:42] they know
[1:50:43] christ they never had to be taken heed
[1:50:45] to peter john knowing they had been
[1:50:47] out of some seminary they take heed and
[1:50:49] notice that they had been
[1:50:50] with christ a man let's stand by the
[1:50:53] grace of god
[1:50:54] that's a hour and seven minutes
[1:50:59] but i just wanted to make i want to get
[1:51:01] you minds ready
[1:51:03] because a deception is coming and if the
[1:51:06] gates of hell
[1:51:07] are coming against the godhead and they
[1:51:08] have been for a thousand two thousand
[1:51:11] years with a gentile bride
[1:51:13] then we must prep for the final test is
[1:51:15] there a final test coming on that i
[1:51:17] don't know but
[1:51:17] let's be ready amen study lord reveal
[1:51:20] more of yourself to us
[1:51:22] give us revelation of who you are show
[1:51:25] us your real give us
[1:51:26] everything we need hallelujah because
[1:51:28] we're going to need it
[1:51:31] the new birth is christ the new birth is
[1:51:34] christ
[1:51:35] is a revelation
[1:51:38] because if you've had that new birth
[1:51:40] jesus christ will give you that
[1:51:41] revelation
[1:51:42] thoroughly god had
[1:51:45] has revealed it to you this great
[1:51:48] mystery and that's a new birth
[1:51:50] now what are you going to do when they
[1:51:51] get all that group together where the
[1:51:52] revelation is in perfect harmony and god
[1:51:54] expressing it through his word by the
[1:51:56] same
[1:51:56] actions the same things that he did
[1:51:59] making the word manifest oh if the
[1:52:00] church
[1:52:01] only knew its position it will one day
[1:52:03] and it will probably take in one second
[1:52:05] the revelation of who she is will come
[1:52:07] at one time
[1:52:09] it'll be a worldwide move in each local
[1:52:13] church
[1:52:14] and then the rapture will go when it
[1:52:15] knows what it is
[1:52:19] why do you hug a church why do you
[1:52:20] thirst is the father trying to reveal
[1:52:23] the secret
[1:52:24] hidden secret to you and what's that
[1:52:26] sermon christ is the mystery of god
[1:52:28] revealed
[1:52:30] he's trying to give a full now brother i
[1:52:33] thought that is the best is my
[1:52:34] understanding
[1:52:35] is there greater absolutely it's
[1:52:36] probably greater way greater probably
[1:52:38] revelation of it
[1:52:39] and it's coming but look it's a father
[1:52:42] trying to reveal this hidden secret to
[1:52:43] you
[1:52:44] but you let so many things get it out of
[1:52:46] you like your job you let your wife
[1:52:47] you let your husband let your children
[1:52:49] let your cares of the world let
[1:52:51] you let some past you let someone else
[1:52:53] get that out of you
[1:52:54] and when you know that way down deep in
[1:52:56] your heart you're thirsting hungry
[1:52:58] it's god trying to reveal to you see the
[1:53:00] revelation the last day is
[1:53:02] here notice now
[1:53:06] there's coming to the point remember
[1:53:07] when he draws knives when we see him we
[1:53:09] shall be
[1:53:09] like him we shall be as he is amen
[1:53:14] we're coming to a an actual real
[1:53:17] bride awakening amen
[1:53:20] all hearts minds clear yeah are we doing
[1:53:22] okay
[1:53:23] yeah did it help a little bit a little
[1:53:25] bit greater revelation why would
[1:53:27] why would peter warren in acts 17 29
[1:53:31] beware of these things he said these
[1:53:32] these images these markings
[1:53:34] their devices these thoughts these
[1:53:36] reasonings the revelation of god should
[1:53:38] come so easily amen
[1:53:41] absolutely and if he will manifest
[1:53:44] himself here and that he is here then
[1:53:46] this very holy spirit that can you res
[1:53:48] that you can re uh that you receive
[1:53:51] proves it is him
[1:53:52] pentecost is the only thing going to
[1:53:54] prove christianity you can't prove it by
[1:53:56] science you can't prove it by nothing
[1:53:57] but by pentecostal experiences
[1:53:59] you baptist know that and your methods
[1:54:01] present whatever you are
[1:54:02] you know it takes pentecostal experience
[1:54:04] to prove
[1:54:06] god saints of god
[1:54:09] i knew this was truth and this message
[1:54:12] was truth in many many different ways
[1:54:13] but when a year and a half after i'd
[1:54:15] been baptized i received the baptism of
[1:54:16] the ghost i
[1:54:17] knew this it was i knew that god
[1:54:22] was god and he had accepted
[1:54:26] uh i think it's my belief i'll say like
[1:54:28] that
[1:54:29] and i had accepted his sacrifice fully
[1:54:32] and did our best to die out
[1:54:35] he says and it's to each individual it
[1:54:37] doesn't prove the organization it proves
[1:54:39] the individual that's why in many
[1:54:40] churches as many
[1:54:41] as a uh big meetings people receive the
[1:54:44] baptism of the holy ghost that does not
[1:54:45] prove
[1:54:46] that the minister's right that the whole
[1:54:47] assembly is right it proves that that
[1:54:49] person met god right there
[1:54:51] amen amen
[1:54:54] at those kind of meetings every person
[1:54:56] should receive a baptism of the holy
[1:54:58] ghost
[1:54:59] well that's easy to say it is easy to
[1:55:00] say because there's many times i have
[1:55:02] not received it again or refilling
[1:55:04] but in the grand scheme of things when
[1:55:06] we see these big meetings or even
[1:55:08] meetings here anointed means where god
[1:55:10] is moving the holy spirit is moving and
[1:55:12] someone received the holy ghost that
[1:55:13] proves that
[1:55:14] individual right there yeah and that is
[1:55:17] to that individual into the church
[1:55:20] uni uh in a whole as well proves that
[1:55:22] person's been filled with the holy ghost
[1:55:24] and they can have confidence that god's
[1:55:25] gonna finish the work
[1:55:26] amen amen now here's a beautiful thing i
[1:55:29] saw
[1:55:30] in the book of revelation of jesus
[1:55:32] christ
[1:55:35] in the what they would say the red
[1:55:36] letters jesus
[1:55:38] never reveals himself
[1:55:42] who is this the alpha the omega he does
[1:55:46] not reveal himself until after the door
[1:55:49] closes
[1:55:50] and he says to me seal not the sayings
[1:55:52] of the prophecy of this book for the
[1:55:53] time of the hand
[1:55:54] he that is unjust let him be unjust
[1:55:56] still and he is filthy let me see if
[1:55:58] he'll be still he is righteous let me
[1:55:59] register and he is holy holy still
[1:56:01] and behold i come quickly and my reward
[1:56:02] is with me to give every man according
[1:56:04] to his work shall be i am alpha
[1:56:05] and omega he said that revelations 1.
[1:56:08] this is the beginning and revelation 1
[1:56:10] the first and last revelations one
[1:56:11] blessed are they do his commandments for
[1:56:12] they have the right to the tree of life
[1:56:14] and may enter in through the gates into
[1:56:15] the city
[1:56:16] for without our dogs horses whoremongers
[1:56:19] and murderers adulterers and whoever
[1:56:21] loveth and maketh a lie
[1:56:22] i jesus
[1:56:25] now this he declares
[1:56:29] who did this now i wonder this too
[1:56:33] at the closing of the door he's going to
[1:56:36] reveal himself
[1:56:39] and have sent my angel
[1:56:44] remember the prophet said that angel in
[1:56:45] revelations 1 1 was the same angel
[1:56:47] all the way through he said it was an
[1:56:49] eagle
[1:56:51] he broke forth the godhead he broke
[1:56:52] forth the revelation 17-18 he broke
[1:56:55] forth
[1:56:55] he was there speaking with john and
[1:56:57] showing those things so much that when
[1:56:58] he spoke
[1:56:59] john thought it was god he said get up
[1:57:02] i'm one of the prophets i jesus have
[1:57:05] sent my angel to testify unto these
[1:57:07] things in the churches i am the root the
[1:57:09] beginning
[1:57:10] and where all that was that come out of
[1:57:12] david
[1:57:13] ingesting all them i am the root and
[1:57:15] offspring of david and the bright and
[1:57:17] morning star
[1:57:18] the revelation of jesus christ comes
[1:57:20] right at the end
[1:57:22] amen amen amen
[1:57:27] and such as do wickedly against the
[1:57:28] covenant shall he crop by flatteries
[1:57:31] but the people that do know their god
[1:57:33] shall be
[1:57:34] strong and do exploits but first you
[1:57:37] must know
[1:57:38] your god and that comes through the
[1:57:40] revelation
[1:57:41] of the living god jesus christ let's bow
[1:57:44] our heads
[1:57:45] dearly father lord jesus we just love
[1:57:46] you and lord jesus lord we
[1:57:49] are thankful lord for faithful soldiers
[1:57:52] lord come to hear a little
[1:57:54] study god lord on what you said was you
[1:57:57] anointed your prophet and
[1:57:58] man of god there to write and say that
[1:58:00] this was the capstone revelation
[1:58:03] of the entire bible of all revelations
[1:58:05] this is the great one
[1:58:07] who you are even the devils lord in your
[1:58:10] day
[1:58:11] recognizes that thou art the christ the
[1:58:12] son living
[1:58:14] lost demons and yet they had enough
[1:58:17] common sense enough revelation to know
[1:58:21] lord i wonder if sometimes that one of
[1:58:22] them demons knew that you were
[1:58:25] god gets in some people and then people
[1:58:28] will say the exact same thing that
[1:58:30] demon's saying they'll look like they're
[1:58:31] christians
[1:58:32] it's just the devil's revelation and
[1:58:35] lord jesus lord we don't want them
[1:58:38] lord if all the people are eyes closed
[1:58:41] lord
[1:58:42] lord if they raise their hands glorious
[1:58:44] ask lord he would just bless the lord
[1:58:46] and give them
[1:58:46] revelation of the living god jesus
[1:58:49] christ
[1:58:51] lord jesus we want that revelation with
[1:58:53] that true understanding lord
[1:58:54] and lord you said that your lord give us
[1:58:57] the sermon this last
[1:58:58] day to lord to discern lord both of the
[1:59:01] spirits
[1:59:02] in the church the antichrist spirit and
[1:59:04] the spirit of the living god
[1:59:06] and lord lord i just pray a blessing
