[0:03] I I like a man of vision I like people
[0:07] it's got something they're fighting for
[0:09] I think every Christian ought to be that
[0:12] way find your purpose and go do it
[0:15] oh feet up and at it
[0:20] Green's friends in the matchless name of
[0:23] the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:25] this video is to provide some Holy Ghost
[0:28] inspiration and motivation for you to
[0:32] have a purpose in life
[0:33] find your purpose in life and go do it
[0:36] I'm going to use two simple quotes from
[0:38] Brother Branham the first is doors in a
[0:40] door 1965 and the second is taking sides
[0:43] of Jesus 1962.
[0:47] I love these quotes they meant so much
[0:49] to me over the years
[0:51] otherwise speaking of Abraham Lincoln he
[0:54] said he was deprived of an education yet
[0:56] he had something in his heart some
[0:58] purpose and Friends whatever you're
[1:00] deprived of whatever challenges you
[1:02] might face I want to encourage you God
[1:04] has a purpose God's place his purpose in
[1:07] your heart and of course that purpose
[1:09] will line up with the word of God
[1:11] then brother random says I like a man of
[1:13] vision he likes people that have
[1:15] something they're fighting for and they
[1:17] just don't lay around so friends let's
[1:19] have a vision
[1:21] let's have something we're fighting for
[1:23] let's not lay around he says oh be up
[1:26] and at it brother Brandon said I think
[1:28] every Christian ought to be that way
[1:29] find a purpose and go do it if there's a
[1:32] Revival in town he said the Revival is
[1:34] there for a purpose let's get something
[1:37] out of it let's do something about it
[1:40] and then brother random encourages the
[1:42] preachers and taking sides with Jesus
[1:43] you're men of God with a calling in your
[1:45] life you can be doing something don't
[1:48] just sit around do something if you can
[1:50] only get one Soul saved get that one
[1:52] saved each one of us and Friends these
[1:55] quotes have meant so much to me over the
[1:56] years have been pastoring 17 years I
[1:59] normally preach two three four sometimes
[2:01] five times a week and these quotes have
[2:03] meant a lot to me they've been a great
[2:05] source of inspiration and motivation
[2:07] they keep me encouraged when I get tired
[2:10] or worn out they've encouraged me to
[2:13] finish writing my two books finish
[2:15] editing all the podcasts and videos
[2:18] because I believe that's my purpose in
[2:20] life to teach and strengthen the Bride
[2:22] of Jesus Christ in my humble little way
[2:25] so enjoy these quotes and I hope you'll
[2:27] replay this video over and over again as
[2:29] a source of inspiration and motivation
[2:32] from Brother Branham but of course it's
[2:34] the Holy Ghost through brother Branham
[2:35] God bless you
[2:37] some time ago it was uh read a story of
[2:42] uh the days of our Noble uh one of the
[2:45] greatest presidents I think the nation
[2:47] ever had but was was Lincoln not because
[2:50] he come from Kentucky but because he was
[2:53] a great man he was uh deprived of an
[2:55] education but yet with something in his
[2:58] heart
[3:00] some purpose
[3:02] I I like a man of vision
[3:05] I like people it's got something they're
[3:07] fighting for just not
[3:09] just stay around well
[3:12] what comes along will be all right oh be
[3:15] up and at it and Lincoln never let his
[3:18] education stand in the way he had
[3:20] something to do I think every Christian
[3:23] ought to be that way
[3:24] find your purpose and go do it every
[3:28] member of this chapter just thought well
[3:30] we have a breakfast once a month that
[3:32] isn't it or once every Saturday have a
[3:34] purpose in life something you're going
[3:36] to do let's not just place you here do
[3:38] something about it every member of every
[3:40] Church there's a revolvement town that
[3:42] Revival's there forever
[3:44] let's get something out of it let's do
[3:47] something about it
