Description:
Part 4 shares a few historical facts about the ministry of William Branham. History calls Brother Branham the "pace-setter" and "father" of the world-wide healing revival that began in the 1940s with his very own ministry. The Full Gospel Businessmen and the late T.L. Osborne recognized William Branham as a genuine prophet of God due to the supernatural power of the Holy Ghost that vindicated his ministry. The miraculous healing of the late Congressman William Upshaw was a bonafide, undeniable miracle of God that reached all the way to the White House. Lastly, the Pillar of Fire came down and was photographed as a halo around the head of God's prophet, William Branham. We encourage all viewers to listen to and take heed to God's "last sign" to the Gentiles before the tribulation period - the Son of Man ministry that God gave to William Branham.
