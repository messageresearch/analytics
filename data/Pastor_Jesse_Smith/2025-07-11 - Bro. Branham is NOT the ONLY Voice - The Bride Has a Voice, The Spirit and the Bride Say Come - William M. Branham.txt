TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Without a doubt, Holy Ghostfilled believers believe that William Brham was the voice of God to the Leodysian church age. Just as John the Baptist was a voice crying in the wilderness, according to scripture, God's prophet William Brham was the voice in the days of the seventh angel. William Brham's voice gave us the finished mystery of God. All the Bible-defined mysteries have been revealed to us through the prophet William Marin Brham. But is William Brham the only voice of God? Some would have us to believe that, but that's incorrect. The Bible emphatically teaches that not only are prophets the voice of God, sometimes even sinners can be the voice of God speaking the truth of God like Balum and Caiaphas. But thankfully for us, every believer in Jesus Christ can be used as God's voice. Brother Brandham said, "When you get in contact with God, it isn't your voice anymore. It's not your thought anymore. It becomes God's thought and God's voice. You are just a vine, just a branch. He's the vine." &gt;&gt; I've seen it work. And to think that if you get into that contact with God, it becomes to it isn't your voice anymore. It's not your thought anymore. It becomes God's thought and God's voice. &gt;&gt; You are just the vine or just a branch. He's the vine and it's his spirit that goes in and energizes. &gt;&gt; He also says it's God's voice through human lips. Every believer in him tonight is likewise possessed. So possessed, so completely given over till his words become like the words of Christ. I and my father are one, &gt;&gt; not three. &gt;&gt; We are one. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; God is in him. God speaks to him. He is no more his own. But he is God's voice &gt;&gt; through human. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And every believer in tonight is likewise &gt;&gt; possessed. So possessed. so completely given over to his words become like the words of Christ. &gt;&gt; He speaks &gt;&gt; and the word is made flesh. &gt;&gt; He speaks and the word is manifested. The works that I do shall you do also. These signs shall follow them that believe. &gt;&gt; We find this truth in numerous places in the scripture. 1 Peter 4:11 says, "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God." It didn't say if any man preach. It said if any man speak. So every true believer should desire to speak the oracles of God. Which in the Greek means a divine oracle, an utterance of God. Some might wonder, how do I know if I'm speaking for God? Whenever you speak God's word in a pure, sincere heart, you're speaking for God. We see this throughout the scripture. In John chapter 4, the Samaritan woman at the well spoke for God. She went and testified. The Bible said specifically, she testified. She did not preach. She testified to many in the city and many believed on Jesus Christ because of her words. Because God was using her voice to speak his truth. In Acts 18, Priscilla and Aquilla talked with Apollos. Priscilla could not be a preacher. So she either testified to Apollos about the baptism of the Holy Ghost or she used a word of wisdom or a word of knowledge. She spoke audibly. God used her voice to relay truth to Apollo so he would know that there was another work of grace, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Also in the book of Acts, Philip had four daughters who prophesied. Prophesying is foretelling the future by the spirit of the Lord. The spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy. So, Philip's four daughters became the voice of God to individuals who needed prophecy. Brother Random said, "A woman, a sister, a believer in Jesus Christ can be used in any of the nine gifts." But as far as gifts, the woman has all those can occupy one or any of those nine spiritual gifts according 1 Corinthians uh 12 and is under no bondage that her message should not come forth in its place. You see, each message waits for its time. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was asked if he's the only one that should preach and he said no. He said he's just one pebble on the beach. In other words, he's just one voice among many voices. Now, brother Brandham, is it true that no one should preach but you? No. Every man or that feels a call of God upon his life, get into the ministry, start preaching. We need him. Man of God are anointed all over the world to preach the gospel. See, I'm just one little pebble on the beach among many big stones. something. So, uh there's just many that's more eligible, more worthy, more of anything to preach than me. I'm just one little humble person laying out here. I'm one grain of wheat and a whole garner. See, so it's just a you know what I mean? Any man that's called of God needs to preach the gospel. But this message that I'm preaching uh is the true message of this day and it's the last message. You see what I'm doing, brethren? I'm putting you all the same place I am cuz you're just as much into it as I am. You are messengers of this same message. But of course, Brother Am's voice was extremely important. He was the seventh church age messenger. He fulfilled Revelation 10:7. He had a son of man gift. Luke 17:30. He was one of the seven stars in the hand of Jesus. A verse brother Ram used repeatedly to show how every believer can be the voice of God is Revelation 22:17. And the spirit and the bride say come. And let him that heareth say come. And let him that is a thirst come. and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. Three times in chapter nine of the church age book, Brother Brandham showed how the bride was the voice of God and she has a voice. And brother Brandham separated the prophet from the bride. He said, "The church is no longer the mouthpiece of God. He God will confound her false church system through the prophet and the bride. For the voice of God will be in her. Praise the Lord. The bride is the voice of God. Again he says, "Oh God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride. That voice is in the bride as we have said." Praise God. God gave a voice to the bride. And finally, William Brandham said, "The spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing, and what they say will have already been said in the word." Friends, take courage. You are God's voice to your friends, your family, strangers, co-workers. All you have to do is say what the Bible says, and you will be the voice of God. And looking back to Revelation 22:17, anytime you say come to church, come be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and not father, son, holy ghost, come receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul. You are the voice of God, because you're speaking what the spirit says and what has already been written in the Holy Bible, the word of God. Praise the Lord for the voice of the seventh angel in Revelation 10:7. And praise the Lord that the bride has a voice to say what the spirit is saying. [Music]
