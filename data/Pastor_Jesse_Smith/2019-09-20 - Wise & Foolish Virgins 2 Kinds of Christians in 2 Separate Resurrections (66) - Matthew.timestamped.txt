[0:06] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:11] this video is to share Jesus's teaching
[0:13] about the two kinds of Christians that
[0:16] he calls wise and foolish virgins
[0:19] hopefully each viewer can see which type
[0:21] of spiritual virgin you are and if you
[0:24] are not yet a wise virgin or Holy Ghost
[0:26] filled Christian you will soon become
[0:29] one these two different kinds of
[0:31] Christians wise and foolish virgins will
[0:34] raise in two different resurrections the
[0:36] first and second resurrections as fully
[0:39] taught in Scripture here's a quick
[0:41] summary before I share a detailed
[0:43] teaching the wise virgins are those with
[0:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their
[0:48] souls beginning with the New Testament
[0:50] Saints on the day of Pentecost and
[0:53] continuing to today's living Saints the
[0:56] dead in Christ will raise first in the
[0:58] first resurrection which is the rapture
[1:00] and then the living Saints will have a
[1:01] body change and meet Christ and the dead
[1:04] in Christ in the air the rapture is an
[1:07] imminent future event that will take
[1:09] place at an unknown day or hour although
[1:11] Paul says we will know the times and
[1:13] seasons revelation 20 verses 4 and 5
[1:16] says the first resurrection is the
[1:18] resurrection to live and reign with
[1:21] Christ on the earth for 1,000 years of
[1:24] peace all the rest of the world
[1:27] including the foolish virgin Christians
[1:29] who were never born again of the Holy
[1:31] Ghost in their souls along with all the
[1:34] sinners will miss the rapture or first
[1:36] resurrection and die in the tribulation
[1:39] period they will not live again until
[1:41] after the glorious 1000 year millennial
[1:43] reign being raised at the second
[1:46] resurrection with all the foolish
[1:48] virgins and sinners who died before the
[1:50] rapture over the past 2,000 years when
[1:54] all in the graves will hear Jesus's
[1:55] voice and come forward to the white
[1:57] throne judgment
[1:58] Jesus calls the second resurrection the
[2:01] resurrection of life or of damnation
[2:04] this is fully proven by Scripture let's
[2:06] begin with this wise and foolish
[2:09] Christians Jesus teaches this truth in
[2:12] Matthew 25
[2:13] verses 1 to 13 Jesus's parable says the
[2:17] kingdom of heaven is like 10 virgins
[2:18] that take their lamps and go out to meet
[2:21] the bridegroom the wise took extra oil
[2:23] and vessels in case the bridegroom would
[2:25] tarry which he did so they would not run
[2:27] out but the foolish virgin took no extra
[2:30] oil
[2:31] the foolish only had oil burning in
[2:33] their lamps
[2:34] the Virgin's fall asleep while waiting
[2:36] for him but both are awakened by a
[2:38] midnight cry both virgins trimmed their
[2:41] lamps or removed the charred portion of
[2:43] their wicks to ensure their lamps are
[2:45] brightly burning the foolish realized
[2:47] they are out of oil so they asked the
[2:49] wise for oil but the wise say they
[2:51] cannot share while the Fouch leave to go
[2:54] buy oil the bridegroom comes and only
[2:56] the wise virgins go into the marriage
[2:58] the foolish returned and tried to enter
[3:00] the marriage but the bridegroom says no
[3:03] he does not know them jesus' final words
[3:06] are watch therefore for you know neither
[3:09] the day nor the hour wherein the Son of
[3:11] man cometh
[3:12] the parable symbols are apparent symbols
[3:16] the bridegroom represents Jesus Christ
[3:19] returning for his New Testament church
[3:21] or bride at the rapture 3 scriptures
[3:24] refer to Christ as a bridegroom and
[3:26] husband who will soon be married to the
[3:29] New Testament Holy Ghost filled Church
[3:31] John 329 Ephesians 5:23 232 and
[3:35] revelation 19 verses 7 through 9
[3:39] the bridegroom's delay represents the
[3:42] last 2000 years Jesus has been raining
[3:44] on God's right hand in heaven the
[3:47] marriage event symbolizes the rapture
[3:49] and marriage supper to the lamb as seen
[3:51] in Revelation 19 verse 9 and he saith
[3:54] unto me write blessed are they which are
[3:56] called unto the marriage supper of the
[3:57] lamb and he saith unto me these are the
[4:00] true sayings of God the rapture is an
[4:02] intimate event and could happen any day
[4:05] or hour and is the first resurrection
[4:07] because Paul says the dead in Christ
[4:10] will rise first and we which are alive
[4:12] and remain shall be caught up together
[4:14] with them in the clouds more on the
[4:16] first resurrection a bit later the term
[4:19] virgins represents new testament
[4:22] christians who have no spiritual
[4:23] intercourse with idols since natural
[4:25] virgins
[4:27] no sexual intercourse New Testament
[4:30] virgin Christians do not worship
[4:31] Hollywood professional athletes famous
[4:34] musicians nor do they make money houses
[4:37] or possessions idols Paul says genuine
[4:40] Christians are chaste virgins to Christ
[4:42] in 2nd Corinthians 11 verses 2 & 3 the
[4:46] wise virgins who had oil represent
[4:48] Christians who are born again by the
[4:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost this is the
[4:52] sea of the Holy Ghost in the soul of man
[4:54] as man has three parts to his being
[4:57] according to 1st Thessalonians 5 verse
[4:59] 23 this is the Holy Ghost baptism jesus
[5:02] describes in acts 1 verse 5 saying for
[5:06] John truly baptized with water but ye
[5:08] shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[5:10] not many days hence Jesus also taught
[5:14] that the New Testament Holy Ghost
[5:15] baptism in the soul was unavailable to
[5:18] Old Testament believers and came on the
[5:21] day of Pentecost in John 7 verses 37 to
[5:24] 39 in the last day that great day of the
[5:27] feast Jesus stood and cried saying if
[5:29] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[5:31] drink he that believeth on me as the
[5:34] scripture hath said out of his belly
[5:36] shall flow rivers of living water but
[5:39] this spake he of the Spirit which they
[5:41] that believe on him should receive for
[5:44] the Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[5:46] that Jesus was not yet glorified John 20
[5:50] verse 22 and when he had said this he
[5:53] breathed on them and saith unto them
[5:55] receive ye the Holy Ghost
[5:57] this means Old Testament Saints like
[6:00] Abraham Sarah Isaac Rebecca David and
[6:03] Solomon were not born again in their
[6:05] souls which in the case of David
[6:07] explains why he could slay Goliath and
[6:10] write Scripture by the Holy Ghost being
[6:13] in his human spirit or mind but later
[6:15] commits wicked acts like adultery and
[6:17] murder David did not have the power of
[6:20] the seal of the Holy Ghost in his soul
[6:22] today the Holy Ghost baptized Christian
[6:25] is kept from committing adultery and
[6:27] murdering by the seal or abiding
[6:30] presence of Christ Lord willing a
[6:32] separate future video will be focused on
[6:34] this subject oil symbolizes the Holy
[6:38] Ghost according to Zechariah chapter 4
[6:40] says the golden oil that emptied out of
[6:43] the two olive trees into the seven
[6:45] candlesticks is God's Spirit not by
[6:48] might not by power but by my spirit
[6:50] saith the Lord of Hosts Paul also
[6:54] describes wise Christians as those who
[6:56] redeem the time fully understanding
[6:58] God's will for their lives the foolish
[7:01] virgins believe in Jesus living a life
[7:03] free from idolatry or making love to the
[7:06] world but failed to use their time
[7:09] wisely for the kingdom of God foolish
[7:11] virgins do not understand God's will
[7:13] because they do not seek God to know it
[7:15] God promises to give the Holy Ghost to
[7:17] them that obey Him according to acts
[7:20] 5:32 and those that ask for the Holy
[7:23] Ghost according to Luke 11:13 so the
[7:26] foolish virgin does not devote special
[7:28] time to obeying God's invitation to seek
[7:31] Him they have a partial hunger and
[7:34] thirst but not a full hunger and thirst
[7:36] for righteousness because God would fill
[7:39] them if they did it is crucial to see
[7:42] that Jesus invites all to be born again
[7:45] we already read John 7 verses 37 to 39
[7:49] where Jesus said if any man thirst
[7:52] notice now Revelation chapter 22 verse
[7:55] 17 and the spirit and the bride say come
[7:58] and let him that heareth come and let
[8:01] him that is athirst come and whosoever
[8:04] will let him take the water of life
[8:06] freely there has always been a wise and
[8:10] foolish virgin in every age including
[8:12] during the Old Testament in the first
[8:14] 2,000 years of world history
[8:16] Enoch represented the wise virgin and
[8:19] Noah represented the foolish virgin
[8:21] Enoch the seventh from Adam walked with
[8:24] God until God took him off the earth
[8:27] Enoch the seventh from Adam typed the
[8:29] Holy Ghost filled believers in the
[8:31] seventh church age the Laodicean Church
[8:33] age who will not die being the Saints
[8:37] who are alive and remain and go in a
[8:39] rapture no represents the foolish
[8:41] version of his time being born about
[8:43] seven years after Enochs rapture while
[8:46] noah found grace in the sight of the
[8:48] lord and was a preacher of righteousness
[8:49] his life still did not match Enochs
[8:52] obedience as
[8:54] evidenced by his drunkenness after the
[8:56] floodwaters receded in the days of
[8:59] Abraham Abraham represented the wise
[9:01] virgin and lot represented the foolish
[9:03] virgin Abraham is the wise virgin
[9:06] because he lived completely separate
[9:08] from Sodom and Gomorrah
[9:09] God knew Abraham would command his
[9:11] children and household to keep the way
[9:13] of the Lord doing justice and judgment
[9:16] lot represents the foolish virgin
[9:18] because the riches and prestige of Sodom
[9:21] and Gomorrah attracted him and his
[9:23] family lot was righteous but was also
[9:25] daily vexed by the wickedness he saw and
[9:28] heard in Sodom and he was guilty of
[9:30] putting himself and his family in this
[9:32] position in David's time David
[9:36] represented the wise virgin while saw
[9:38] represented the foolish virgin David was
[9:41] the wise Virgin of his day because God
[9:43] saw him as a man after his own heart
[9:46] scripture records faithful David as only
[9:48] disobeying God in one event his adultery
[9:51] with Bathsheba and murder of Uriah saw
[9:54] as the foolish virgin of his day the
[9:56] prophet Samuel assured us Saul was saved
[9:59] not going to hell but Saul wasted much
[10:02] of his life disobeying God and harboring
[10:04] a murdering spirit against David God
[10:07] took his mercy away from Saul and Samuel
[10:09] said David was better at obeying God
[10:11] because his heart was after God's heart
[10:13] in the days of Jesus Jesus and His
[10:17] disciples were the wise virgins the
[10:19] saved thief on the cross and perhaps
[10:22] gamellia and Nicodemus were the foolish
[10:24] version of their day Jesus disciples
[10:27] left everything they had in order to
[10:29] follow Christ completely redeeming the
[10:32] time the saved thief repented on the
[10:35] cross and Jesus promised him he would be
[10:37] with him in paradise
[10:38] the very same day gamellia and Nicodemus
[10:42] were most likely saved because they were
[10:44] a help and served the people of God in
[10:47] times of trouble at the time of Jesus's
[10:51] resurrection we saw more proof of wise
[10:54] and foolish virgins even in the Old
[10:55] Testament according to Matthew 27 verses
[10:58] 52 and 53 many of the Old Testament
[11:01] Saints raised from the dead after
[11:04] Jesus's resurrection but not all the
[11:07] prove some were rewarded above others
[11:09] because of their love and obedience for
[11:11] the Lord God the wise versions of the
[11:15] Old Testament raised with Jesus at his
[11:17] resurrection
[11:18] while the foolish remain in the grave to
[11:22] finish the ten virgins parable the
[11:24] midnight cry is the shout of first
[11:26] Thessalonians 4:16 the first part of the
[11:29] rapture preceding the voice and the
[11:31] Trump there's only one Christian
[11:33] ministry that awakened an entire
[11:35] generation here at the end time and
[11:37] history validates the ministry of
[11:39] brother William Branham as the awakening
[11:41] ministry that occurred during the 1940s
[11:43] 50s and 60s randoms message of
[11:46] restoration is fully scriptural as
[11:48] taught in acts 3 21
[11:50] Matthew 17 11 Luke 17 30 revelation 10 1
[11:54] 2 7 and Malachi 4 verses 5 & 6 those
[11:59] wise virgins who had the baptism of the
[12:01] Holy Ghost will go into the rapture with
[12:03] Christ for he is the bridegroom when the
[12:06] foolish virgin came to knock on the
[12:07] bridegroom's door Jesus did not let them
[12:10] in the door to the rapture was closed
[12:12] Jesus urges Christians to be ready
[12:15] watching for the rapture the two
[12:19] resurrections scripture proves that
[12:21] there are two future resurrections and
[12:23] every person will be a part of one or
[12:25] the other the first resurrection which
[12:29] is the rapture 1st Thessalonians 4
[12:31] verses 13 to 18 says the dead in Christ
[12:34] will rise first and then we which are
[12:36] alive and remain shall be caught up
[12:38] together with them in the clouds to meet
[12:39] the lord in the air and so shall we ever
[12:42] be with the Lord
[12:43] this means the Saints will be with
[12:45] Christ during the 1,000 year millennial
[12:47] reign
[12:49] revelation 20 verses 4 to 6 is a portion
[12:53] of Scripture that names the rapture as
[12:55] the first resurrection and details the
[12:57] Millennium it is a time when the Saints
[13:00] rule and reign with Christ because they
[13:01] overcame the beast or Rome or Roman
[13:04] Catholic Church verse 5 provides a
[13:07] shocking matru fact that the rest of the
[13:09] Dead lived not again until the 1,000
[13:12] years are finished the Millennium is not
[13:16] for everyone it's only for the Holy
[13:18] Ghost filled Saints or wise virgins John
[13:22] 5:24 and 25 records Jesus declaring that
[13:25] some believers
[13:26] already have eternal life saying half
[13:29] everlasting life
[13:31] when fully believing John 5:24 and 25
[13:35] verily verily I say unto you he that
[13:38] heareth my word and believeth on him
[13:40] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[13:42] shall not come into condemnation but is
[13:45] passed from death unto life verily
[13:48] verily I say unto you the hour is coming
[13:49] and now is when the dead shall hear the
[13:52] voice of the Son of God and they that
[13:54] hear shall live wise virgins already
[13:57] have eternal life the oil or the baptism
[13:59] of the Holy Ghost
[14:01] notice the Holy Ghost field Saints will
[14:03] not come into condemnation Romans 8:33
[14:06] says who shall lay any charge to God's
[14:09] elect Romans 8:1 says there is no
[14:13] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[14:15] Jesus first John 5 verses 13 and 20
[14:20] supports this as well saying true
[14:22] believers already have eternal life
[14:24] these things have I written unto you
[14:26] that believe on the name of the son of
[14:28] God that you may know that you have
[14:30] eternal life and that ye may believe on
[14:33] the name of the Son of God and we know
[14:35] that the Son of God has come and has
[14:37] given us an understanding that we may
[14:39] know him that is true and we are in him
[14:42] that is true even in his son Jesus
[14:44] Christ this is the true God and eternal
[14:47] life but the foolish virgins do not
[14:51] receive eternal life until the white
[14:53] throne judgment as oil represents
[14:54] eternal life or the baptism of the Holy
[14:57] Ghost Matthew 25 verse 46 says the
[15:01] foolish virgins go
[15:03] to eternal life but holy ghost field
[15:05] Saints already have it on this earth and
[15:07] these go away into everlasting
[15:10] punishment but the righteous into life
[15:12] eternal note that God loves the foolish
[15:16] virgin too so much that he calls them
[15:18] blessed of his father although foolish
[15:22] and avoiding the baptism of the Holy
[15:24] Ghost during their lifetimes God still
[15:26] honors them for their pure Christian
[15:27] lives not committing adultery with
[15:29] Hollywood sports love of money and so
[15:32] forth Matthew 25:34 then shall the King
[15:36] say unto them on his right hand come you
[15:38] blessed it on my father inherit the
[15:40] kingdom prepared for you from the
[15:42] foundation of the world the fish CEO of
[15:45] Revelation 6 verses 9 to 11 also proves
[15:48] eternal life is not possessed by
[15:50] everyone on earth as this seal shows
[15:53] faithful Jews who only have the
[15:55] testimony of the Word of God and not the
[15:57] testimony of Jesus for they cry out for
[16:00] revenge white robes or eternal life are
[16:03] given unto them which has to take place
[16:06] at the white throne judgment or second
[16:08] resurrection the second resurrection
[16:12] this is the resurrection of souls to
[16:14] come to the white throne judgment also
[16:16] called the resurrection unto life and
[16:18] the resurrection unto condemnation in
[16:21] John 5 verses 28 to 29 according to
[16:25] Jesus Christ himself Marvel not at this
[16:28] for the hours coming in the which all
[16:30] that are in the graves shall hear his
[16:32] voice and shall come forth they that
[16:34] have done good unto the resurrection of
[16:36] life and they that have done evil unto
[16:39] the resurrection of damnation revelation
[16:42] 20 verses 11 through 15 also details the
[16:45] white throne judgment where the sea
[16:47] gives up their dead and death and hell
[16:49] deliver every one to the white throne to
[16:52] be judged by their works
[16:53] the save go into eternal life but those
[16:56] whose names are missing from the book of
[16:58] life go into the second death or the
[17:01] lake of fire
[17:03] in closing may you y-z redeem your time
[17:07] and seek the baptism of the holy ghost
[17:09] getting prepared with extra oil for the
[17:12] coming bridegroom please contact me if
[17:14] you have any questions or concerns or
[17:16] testimonies regarding this video god
[17:22] bless you and may Jesus Christ be to the
[17:24] zyre of your heart
