TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show you how a prophet of God William brandham planned for his new year so you can plan and prepare for 20 24 by the grace of God hi my name is Pastor Jesse Smith I've been pastoring bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA for 17 years and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his Prophet William brandham in this video I'm going to show four simple quotes from God's Prophet brother brandom hopefully this will give you some insight and guidelines into how you can prepare for the brand new year 2024 starting with the first quote this is from July 24th 1963 God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him in Jeffersonville Indiana and friends as you listen to this quote imagine having 1,000 invitations to preach for one year brother brandom had over a th000 invitations to preach and he had to make a decision about which invitations he would accept and so if you're feeling overwhelmed with todos or jobs or projects or responsibilities for 2024 you're not alone most of us battle press your times to accomplish all the things on our to-do list but think about this a prophet of God had over a thousand invitations so how did he approach this insurmountable list of imitations well he tells us in the quote you'll hear brother brandom say he laid out all the imitations before God then prayed in order to find the will of God he said he would lay his imitations before the Lord and then talk to the Lord and say now you tell me Heavenly Father which ones to accept let's listen to the quote Billy right now is working on old overseas for a complete World Tour beginning right immediately after Christmas and I'm all booked up until around about December and uh well maybe the first week in December Dallas so then um then in January we want to start on a complete World Tour all way around completely and we're working on that now finding just where the Lord will lead and and I I'm so grateful to the even to the people of ministers as much as I say against their denominations and things like that you know on the books Lane right back there now brother Roy borders takes care of the invitations and since Christmas the first of the year there's been over a thousand invitations around the world a thousand invitations has come in back there so the Lord just has to direct me on which one of those to go to and what to do we just depend on him you couldn't take them all you you couldn't take over uh eight or 10 of them in a summer if you had to in a in a complete unless you just go one night here and one night there and that's they're asking for two weeks and 3 weeks and so forth as long as you can stay here some of them says just long as the Lord will lead and and all like that so you don't know just exactly where to start or what to do so we're just laying them out before the Lord and say now you tell us heavenly father and you help me pray with this matter see you help me pray that we can get this over and I thought now building on this quote let's go to the second quote from a super sense 1959 December 27th evening service here we get more details about how brother Brandon would handle all of his imitations now in this quote you'll notice he didn't have a lot of time to make the decisions he had about a week to decide which invitations he would accept for the upcoming year which would have been 1960 and the further details are this he would go for a walk and pray and then he would go for a drive and pray and look for inspiration from the Holy Spirit and then he would also ask the people to pray for him that he could find the will of God let's listen to the quote now this is going to be a great week for me coming tomorrow the Lord willing I've got to make decisions for the coming year well all the invitations I want to go out to to the office and pick up all my invitations and bring them home therefore for the next few days I go to prayer to God and pray for Him to guide me and show me which way to go and what to do we don't live in a time like it was when he was here where God led him from place to place and he was in a town for a few hours and gone to another city but today it's on a different system it's a setup ministerial groups and a lot of things has to be done and the way I do it I bring in all my African invitations and lay them down all the India invitations and all the California the Utah and all different invitations and put them separately in piles I let them lay and then I take to walking and praying maybe get him a car and be gone a day or two come back praying something comes on my heart to go to a certain place then I see if it's just an impression then afterwards then I if it's impressed me so hard I go to this pile where this certain place is then pick me up a letter and read it of invitation to see where it's at then from there here's the reason I do that you think of riding about 72 hours on a plane in the storms and up and down and around if you ever rode overseas don't know sometimes you're up and sometimes it's down and swinging and rocking and pitching through them clouds over that water for three days and nights then you step off onto a land and the first thing meet you is Satan well the ministerial group said this some of them divided on the vote and some for see then you might say this well maybe the Lord didn't want me to come but when you're s of God you're ready to meet the enemy you see I step here in the name of Jesus Christ Christ I come in the name of the Lord Jesus here I stay till his Works accomplished see and you are ready to meet the forces so you love me I know you do so pray for me this week that I'll make the right decisions by the inspiration of God will lead me so now that we heard both those quotes let's make a simple list of how you and I can approach 2024 so first write out or lay out all your desires before the Lord I find it helpful to write them down on a piece of paper or in my notebook here's the notebook I'm using for 20124 I started using it in 2023 I still got pages left in it so I'm going to use up the rest of the pages Lord willing sometime in 2024 and switch to a new notebook so that's step one write out or lay out your desires before the Lord second step is pray so we should pray and ask the heavenly father to show us his will for our desires for 2024 then step three is wait brother Bram said he would go for a walk and pray or go for a drive and pray next step is wait for inspiration to strike so basically you have those four steps and then once the inspiration strikes then you follow that inspiration by the grace of God those are the goals those are the projects that you accept and try to accomplish for the glory of God very simple isn't it it's a prophet of God trying to find the will of God and I love how brother Braham gives us these simple steps these simple god-honoring steps of just praying waiting on God looking for the Holy Spirit to move I want to share a third and fourth quote as well in the third quote brother brandom said times when he didn't feel he had a leading of the Lord he would depend on another brother's leading of the Lord in this case it's brother Argan bright so how this applies to you and I if we're praying and waiting on the will of God or the leading of the Lord and we don't get it right away we can go with someone else's leading if we know they're genuinely led by the Lord that's what brother Ram says in this quote brother Ram said I'll go with brother arganbright because I know God leads him let's listen to the quote now brother Aron just never runs out of things to do for the Lord Jesus and he doesn't do them grudgingly he just freely goes out and doesn't I couldn't have even taken trips overseas if it hadn't been his help and he's got a burden on his heart when he hits a burden for some Nation here he'll come I'll see it his car drive in the yard and I well me you sa my wife say well here we go overseas again don't we so brother argot with a burden on his heart and he's such a Godly little person even I have no leading yet I'll go with him because I know God leads him and so we appreciate him with all of our heart fourth and finally here's a quote from Shalom 1964 January 12th in this quote brother R tells us he has no leading on his schedule so he said I'm just simply going out to try to do whatever I can here's another suggestion if you do all these steps and you're just waiting on the Lord and you still have no leading like brother brandham says you can take some encouragement from brother brandham just to do something continue doing something so in brother Ram's case he would continue having Services continue preaching waiting to get some other leading from the Lord but until he got a special leading he stayed doing what he normally would do preach let's listen to the quote had a our first little group of meetings here I don't know where you have not the schedule here if some of you how leave it laying here Pastor re where we're to be at and if the Lord willing that is the Lord willing I have no leading for I'm just simply going out to try to do whatever I can and if you got any loved ones around in there would like to come to one of the meetings while you write letter tell to one of these in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing I preach these quotes at our home Church they were such a blessing to me the people seem to enjoy it as well I just thought it was so inspiring to get a look into a genuine prophet of God and how he would find the will of God for each year friends most of us probably don't have a thousand things to do in our to-do list if you do well then may God help you but no matter what if you're feeling overwhelmed here we can see from Brother bram's example cast your cares upon the Lord just lay out everything before the Lord you can lay it out on paper lay it out on your computer and then present yourself before the Lord reminds me of Romans 12 present your body as a Living Sacrifice and as you wait on the Lord you renew your strength like the eagle according to Isaiah and then God will transform your mind you'll see the inspiration of the Holy Spirit strike and you'll know which way to go you know which projects to work on or which places to travel so by God's grace I look for some testimonies to come out of this video Lord willing hopefully God will guide and direct you for 2024 and Beyond by the grace of God maybe next year I'll reuse this quote or redo this video and make it a fresh one for 2025 if the Lord terries and before finishing up I want to wish you a wonderful new New Year by the grace of God and here's a quote where brother Brandon wishes a Happy New Year to the Saints and wishes all the blessings that God can pour out upon his people let's listen to the quote now I want to say this before I start I wish to each one of you all the most successful and blessful and healthy New Years that I can wish to you God be with you may you grow both physically spiritually financially and materially everything that God can bring up on you I pray that he'll do it if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
