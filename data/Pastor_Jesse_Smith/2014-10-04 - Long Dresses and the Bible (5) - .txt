This video answers the question "Why do some Christian women only wear modest skirts and dresses rather than wearing pants?" The Bible is clear in Deuteronomy 22:5 and 1 Timothy 2:9 that women and men should wear separate clothing and the clothing should be modest, not drawing attention to the bodily figure. Surprising to many might be the history shown that proves our nation, the United States, honored Deuteronomy 22:5 for its entire existence up until the mid 1960s to early 1970s. May God anoint all His children to return to the truth of men and women wearing separate garments.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Greetings in Jesus Christ's holy name. The purpose of this video is to answer the following question. Why do some Christian women wear long skirts and dresses? This is a fair and honest question that a lot of people probably wonder but might not have the answer to. So it was our desire to humbly share by the Bible and by history why we believe God is asking Christian women today to present themselves in women's clothing which are long dresses and skirts while men are asked to present their bodies in clothing that only pertains to men which are pants. Let's more closely examine what the Bible teaches about crossdressing. According to two main scriptures, the Bible teaches that Christian women should wear long, loose, flowing skirts and dresses because they are modest and aren't designed to be sexually attractive. Deuteronomy 22:5 says, "The woman shall not wear that which pertainth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment, for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God." 1 Timothy 2:9 says, "In like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamef faceness and sobriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly array." Starting with Deuteronomy 22:5, we learn that God considers cross-dressing an abomination. An abomination is a disgusting thing to God. God is well pleased when men and women dress differently, wearing different garments. Due to our Judeo-Christian principles, our nation was founded upon, we believe garments that pertain to men only are pants, and garments that pertain to women only are skirts and dresses. So, we believe any man who wears a dress or skirt is breaking God's command and is committing an abomination. Likewise, we believe any woman who wears a pair of pants is committing an abomination against God. But the sad part is most men and women are not even aware of this Bible teaching. A little later in this video, we will show how nearly all of America once believed and obeyed this Bible command of different clothing for males and females just 50 years ago, including companies like Macy's. Please stay tuned. Concerning Deuteronomy 22:5, most people will quickly try to point out the fact that it is found in the Old Testament, and so they claim that it cannot apply to us today because we are under the New Testament. While it's true we are under the New Testament, keep in mind that many Old Testament commandments, which some have called the moral law of God, are still in effect today in the New Testament. Such as God's commandments against lying, stealing, committing adultery and fornication, murder, and even God's continued desire for children to honor their parents. It is clear that some Old Testament scriptures have been fulfilled and are done away with, which some call the ceremonial law of God. These commands no longer require our actions of obedience like the keeping of holy days, circumcision, sacrificing animals for sins, and the entire ironic priesthood. Yet many Old Testament commandments are still in effect today as displayed [Music] earlier. So the argument that we don't need the Old Testament commandments today because we are not under the law will not work for every Old Testament scripture. And in the case of Deuteronomy 22:5 and crossdressing, it is clear by searching both the Old Testament and the New Testament that God never abolished or fulfilled this command. So, we believe Deuteronomy 22:5 is still in effect today. If God is willing, we will soon produce a video to teach which abominations are still in effect, along with how the majority of the Ten Commandments are still eternal truths we must obey. So, please check back to our website for updates. Moving on to 1 Timothy 2:9, let's notice here that St. Paul commands women specifically to dress modestly. But of course, we know God wants men to do the same according to scripture in Mark 5:15. Modesty means dressing or behaving so as to avoid impropriy or indecency, especially to avoid attracting sexual attention. It also means not revealing or emphasizing the figure. Without a doubt, our sinful, ungodly American, westernized Hollywood culture loves to glorify and reveal both men and women's figures. But it is clear that it thrives on the woman's ability to attract sexual attention as seen by the $14 billion a year pornography industry and the 11 billion a year movie industry. A godly Christian man and woman will strive to not attract the sexual attention of others by choosing to obey God's command and dress modestly. The way to do this is to wear loose- fitting clothing, layers of clothing, and clothing that covers more of the [Music] body. For nearly 200 years of our nation, the United States, we honored and kept many Judeo-Christian Bible standards, including separate garments for men and women, meaning no crossdressing. But because our country has backsliden and fallen away from its biblical foundation, as the Bible predicted in 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 2 Timothy 3:es 1-8, and Matthew 24:22, the standards for a holy appearance have either been greatly diminished or even completely abolished among many church-going groups. Let's view what a few historical references teach us about when and why crossdressing has become acceptable. Despite the Bible command for separate clothing for men and [Music] women, laws against crossdressing existed in England at the end of the 17th century. For instance, a person could be hanged for dressing in clothes of the opposite sex. History says our ancestors were obedient to the word of God throughout the entire 17th century, 18th century, and 19th [Music] century. While legal restrictions were less severe by the 19th century, arrests and imprisonment continued to occur with exceptions being made only during certain festivals and holidays. Religious leaders cited a passage in the Bible, Deuteronomy 22:5, forbidding men and women to wear the clothes of the opposite sex. The general public believed the Bible edict. The legal system as well reflected these Christian beliefs. Just prior to the 1960s, around 1949 to 1959, history says pants and jeans were forbidden to be worn by females in schools. Sadly, everything changed toward the end of the 20th century in the mid 1960s and early 1970s. According to the ebook called fashion, the sexual revolution and women's lib, they borrowed more from men's fashion. The look slowly became widely accepted as an alternative to skirts and dresses. Furthermore, in the 1970s, we find the 1970s can be summed up in one word, pants. It was hard to believe that so recently, the length of a skirt was the most important fashion consideration on the part of the vast majority of American women. It is also hard to believe that in the early 1970s, women were not allowed to enter fine restaurants and clubs wearing pants. As the 1970s opened, many women began to wear pants. Pants sold so well that major designers added pants suits. In 1968, Levis's launched a division for gals. Some businesses began to accept female employees in pants. Macy's would not permit women employees in pants, but the First National Bank of Boston would if they continued to act like women. AT&T would keep an open mind. For the first time in America's fashion history, women began to have a real choice between dresses and pants. Any woman of the 1600s or 1700s never would have dreamed of pulling on a pair of breaches. Why did these changes happen? History says woman has all the desire to conquer worlds. History records that women were trying to conquer the man's world. And so in order to do this, they had to wear his clothes. To summarize this timeline, we can clearly see that the majority of our ancestors from England and through the times of the founding fathers of our nation were obedient to God's command for separate clothing for men and women in Deuteronomy 22:5. But at some point during the mid to late 1960s, the majority of American men and women have been disobedient to this command. The laws of our ancestors reflected their biblical views, punishing cross-dressing with death and imprisonment. Of course, we do not hope for a return to these laws and punishments. But we do pray for return of all God's children to the Bible teaching of Deuteronomy 22:5. Oh children of God, won't you return to obeying the holy words of our [Music] Lord? Hosea 4:6 says, "My people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge." For my own personal testimony, I was never aware of the Bible truths on long dresses and crossdressing. I had a great lack of Bible knowledge on this subject. But thankfully, God saw fit to reveal his truth to me about separate male and female clothing by his grace and his mercy. I find that most people I talk to about men and women's clothing fall in the same category that I was in not long ago. They are totally unaware of what God's word teaches on this subject. This ought to remind us of the days of the judges when there arose another generation that knew not the Lord according to Judges 2:10. Thankfully, today God is trying to remind the people of his testimonies that we read in the Bible. God is making the world aware of his word. As recently, the Today Show even testified about the truth of Deuteronomy 22:5 and God's desire for women to wear long flowing dresses and skirts. Following Proverbs, she learned to sew. This is hard. And made a few wardrobe changes. Deuteronomy 22 says that the Lord detests a woman who wears man's clothing. So to be on the safe side, you probably want to stick with flowing skirts like these. Furthermore, the most simple and obvious public witness of the truth of Deuteronomy 22:5 in our society today is probably the female symbol used on public restroom signs. A woman's symbol is a dress or skirt because at one time this nation honored Deuteronomy 22:5 and believed that a dress or skirt was a garment that only pertained to a woman. These signs are an undeniable, constant, and lasting symbol of the standards for separate clothing our country once held but forfeited nearly 50 years ago. In conclusion, we pray that you will sincerely study out the biblical and historical truths we presented and consider obeying God's commands on men and women's clothing. Jesus said man should live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God in Matthew 4:4 which includes modest clothing and not crossdressing. We do not want to be guilty of not preaching the truths of Deuteronomy 22:5 and 1 Timothy 2:9. For then we would be taken away from the words of the book of this prophecy, the Holy Bible. And that comes with grave consequences according to Revelation 22:19. Won't you prayerfully consider presenting your body humbly and modestly, not trying to draw sexual attention or any other attention to yourself? Men, won't you prayerfully consider wearing men's garments only? Women, won't you prayerfully consider wearing women's garments only, which are dresses and skirts? Please know that nothing abominable will enter the holy city, the new Jerusalem. May God help each one of us to honor his word about separate clothing for men and women that we might enter that holy city. And there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever workketh abomination or maketh a lie, but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life. If you would like more Bible and historical teaching about separate garments for men and women, or if you are in need of garments that would honor God's commands in Deuteronomy 22:5 and 1 Timothy 2:9, please contact our Akran fellowship. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. [Music]
