[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] and now by the help of God I believe
[0:05] that I'm directing the Bride of Jesus
[0:07] [Music]
[0:09] Christ Oh Amazing Grace How Sweet the
[0:13] Sound greetings friends in the matchless
[0:16] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I felt led
[0:19] to make a video on why I'm a message
[0:21] believer my name is Jesse Smith I'm
[0:24] pastor of bride of Christ Fellowship
[0:25] here in akan Ohio USA for the past 17
[0:29] years and I defend the Bible revelations
[0:31] that Jesus Christ revealed to his
[0:33] Prophet The Late William brandham 1909
[0:35] to
[0:36] 1965 so here's a brief history of my
[0:39] life and how I grew up religiously of
[0:41] course I have a full video about my
[0:43] testimony if you'd like to watch that
[0:45] but I was raised in Assembly of God
[0:47] Church a trinitarian church and I was
[0:49] there all 18 years of my life before I
[0:51] came to college here in akan Ohio at 16
[0:53] years old I tried to get saved I got
[0:56] baptized but it wasn't a sincere baptism
[0:59] and so so I kept living worldly but then
[1:01] when I came to college and halfway
[1:03] between my freshman year I was attending
[1:06] a church here in akaran called the
[1:07] chapel they have a lot of Baptist
[1:09] Doctrine I went to an athletes and
[1:11] action conference and got saved I
[1:12] finally repented of my sins and gave my
[1:14] heart to the Lord for nearly the next 2
[1:17] years I Faithfully worshiped at the
[1:19] chapel until my brother Simon shared
[1:21] with me the bible-based message of
[1:23] William brandham that was in late
[1:26] November 2001 ever since then I've been
[1:29] a message believer and so now I'll look
[1:31] at the reasons why I'm a message
[1:34] believer reason number one I believe the
[1:36] message that God gave to William
[1:38] brandham is the most biblical form of
[1:40] Christianity I have ever seen the bible
[1:43] message that God gave to William
[1:45] brandham has made me fall in love with
[1:48] the Holy Bible and I say the same as
[1:50] brother brandom said if there was a more
[1:52] biblical form of Christianity I would
[1:54] certainly follow
[1:55] it well if I thought that there was a
[2:00] denomination or any other group of
[2:02] Believers that had anything better than
[2:06] we have here Brethren I would I want to
[2:10] emerge this little body with it right
[2:12] quick I've waited I have longed I have
[2:16] been under anticipations and believe
[2:19] that some great one was coming someday
[2:22] or maybe the great prophet that a speak
[2:24] will come of the Elijah I've always
[2:27] believed and thought maybe that that
[2:30] maybe I'd live to Sea the day that when
[2:32] I could change when I'd see that person
[2:35] rise on the scene then I could take my
[2:37] little church and say Brethren this is
[2:40] the man we have looked for this man he
[2:43] is the one I've waited for
[2:46] that people who pump and didn't love me
[2:49] at all nobody had any use for me and
[2:53] now by the help of God I believe it I'm
[2:56] directing the Bride of Jesus Christen
[3:01] Oh Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound
[3:04] I've been studying the Bible for the
[3:06] last 24 years and then studying the
[3:08] sermons of William Brandon for the last
[3:10] 22 years and preaching the Bible for the
[3:12] last 20 years and I have fallen in love
[3:15] more and more with the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:16] and His Holy Bible through the ministry
[3:19] that God gave to William brandham reason
[3:22] number two the bible message that God
[3:24] gave to William brandham balances the
[3:26] spirit and Truth as Jesus said in John
[3:28] 4:23 24 God is looking for worshippers
[3:32] to Worship in spirit and in truth so
[3:34] growing up in Assemblies of God
[3:36] denomination they believe in the moving
[3:38] of the spirit there was always tongues
[3:40] and interpretations and my mother had
[3:41] amazing Miracle healed of liver cancer
[3:44] but they lacked a lot of Bible truth
[3:46] they didn't believe in Holiness they
[3:48] said tongues were the evidence of the
[3:50] Holy Ghost and then in college the mega
[3:52] church I attended were kind of the
[3:54] opposite they had more truth of the
[3:56] scripture but they had very little
[3:58] moving of the Holy Spirit when it came
[4:00] to the Bible revelations that God gave
[4:02] to William brandham now I'm in a church
[4:04] where we have the spirit and Truth my
[4:07] testimony video has a list of some of
[4:09] the Miracles God has done that's just a
[4:11] few of them and I've seen all nine gifts
[4:14] of the holy spirit operate in our church
[4:16] over the past 17 years I pastored this
[4:18] church and of course I believe brother
[4:20] Ram taught the truth of the Bible with
[4:23] more depth and accuracy than any other
[4:25] preacher this perfect combination of the
[4:28] spirit and Truth has convince me that
[4:30] Jesus Christ is in this message I know
[4:33] there's a lot of accusers out there who
[4:35] have left the ministry of William
[4:36] brandham and by God's grace I believe
[4:38] God has called me to defend this
[4:40] bible-based ministry of brother brandom
[4:42] but in all my interactions with them
[4:44] they do not accept the truth of the
[4:46] Bible not one of them has tried to read
[4:48] my books and have honestly looked at the
[4:51] research I've done both church history
[4:54] and church doctrine not one of them this
[4:57] shows me they're afraid of the truth
[4:59] I'll research their claims and I find
[5:02] most of them are slanderous most of them
[5:04] are presumptuous but not a single one of
[5:07] them will read my research and try to
[5:09] refute it that's one proof to me that
[5:12] they're afraid of the truth but here in
[5:14] our church we stand on both the Holy
[5:15] Spirit and Truth by the grace of God a
[5:19] third reason I'm a message believer is
[5:21] because of the depth of Truth The Deep
[5:23] Revelations of the Holy Spirit the Bible
[5:25] says the spirit searches the Deep things
[5:27] yay the Deep things of God
[5:30] and brother br's Ministry fulfilled
[5:31] Revelation 10:7 the mysteries of God are
[5:34] finished brother brandom preached the 12
[5:36] New Testament Mysteries I lay that out
[5:39] in my 2021 book brother BR also gave us
[5:42] so many wonderful deep Revelations such
[5:45] as the wise and foolish virgin MDC the
[5:48] Waters of Separation there are so many
[5:50] wonderful
[5:51] Revelations and we don't have to wonder
[5:53] is this true or not we have the Bible
[5:56] Revelation with thus sayith the Lord
[5:57] thus sayith the scripture and God is has
[5:59] revealed them to us by his grace another
[6:02] reason I believe the message is because
[6:03] of the love for church history brother
[6:06] random preached this beautiful series on
[6:08] the seven Church ages and then the Seven
[6:10] Seals brother Brandon pulled so much
[6:12] truth out of church history and showed
[6:15] us that Jesus Christ is the same
[6:16] yesterday today and forever if you want
[6:19] to understand God's true interpretation
[6:21] of church history and listen to the
[6:23] seven Church ages read the church age
[6:25] book listen to The Seven Seals read the
[6:28] seven seal book the Holy Ghost LED
[6:30] brother brandom to see which messenger
[6:33] of the ages stayed most true to Paul's
[6:36] pattern and First Timothy chapter 1 says
[6:39] Paul was the pattern for Ministry and so
[6:41] brother bandam caught that Revelation
[6:44] and gives us so much truth about church
[6:46] history friends I preached over 125
[6:49] sermons just on the Book of Revelation I
[6:51] could have preached more because brother
[6:53] Brandon was so faithful to the holy
[6:54] spirit in bringing out true church
[6:56] history I constantly feel like I can
[6:58] only scratch the Sur surface on these
[7:00] deep wonderful Bible Mysteries Bible
[7:03] truths that the Holy Spirit gave us
[7:05] through his Prophet brother brandham I
[7:07] love how brother brandham showed the
[7:09] faith and Revelation given to Paul
[7:12] irenius Martin Columba Martin Luther
[7:15] John Wesley these were wonderful men of
[7:18] God who received Revelation from the
[7:20] Holy Spirit another example is how
[7:22] brother brandham showed how Constantine
[7:23] was not a real believer I was surprised
[7:26] so many denominations think Constantine
[7:28] was saved there's no way he was saved he
[7:31] was a murderer he was an idolator there
[7:33] were so many things wrong with his life
[7:36] and the Holy Ghost gave brother brand
[7:37] the true understanding about Constantine
[7:39] and so many other topics in church
[7:42] history another reason I love this
[7:44] message is because as the most biblical
[7:46] form of church government acts 14:23 and
[7:49] Titus 15 say that Paul ordained Elders
[7:53] in every city and so message churches
[7:56] that are faithful to the Bible have
[7:58] elders which are normally trustees so
[8:01] the pastor is the head of the Church of
[8:02] course also another Bible word for
[8:04] pastor is Bishop but the pastor is
[8:06] accountable to the trustees just as Paul
[8:09] taught in the Bible our church
[8:11] government has no Creed but Christ every
[8:13] denomination that writes their own Creed
[8:15] eventually changes it falls away from it
[8:17] or allows more sin in the church Creed
[8:21] but not this message this message has
[8:22] only one Creed book and it's the entire
[8:24] Bible by the grace of God we have no
[8:26] popes no Creeds no archbishops no
[8:29] denominations we have local Sovereign
[8:31] churches we have sister churches we
[8:33] fellowship with everyone is accountable
[8:36] to everyone another reason I'm a message
[8:38] believer is because of the five full
[8:40] ministry in Ephesians 4:11 the Bible
[8:42] says without the five full ministry
[8:44] people are tossed by every wind of
[8:46] Doctrine so the five full ministry gives
[8:48] us stability the Bible also says the
[8:50] five full ministry will bring us into
[8:52] the unity of Faith to the full measure
[8:54] of stature of Christ for each of our
[8:56] individual lives and I've seen that so
[8:58] clearly as a pastor I can only do 1th of
[9:02] the ministry in the lives of our church
[9:04] members the Saints and so we need the
[9:07] other four gifts of the Holy Spirit to
[9:09] bring maturity to our lives I love
[9:11] seeing evangelist come in teachers come
[9:12] in we've had a few Apostles not many but
[9:15] when they come in they always strengthen
[9:18] the body of Jesus Christ a lot of
[9:20] deceivers say we only have a one-man
[9:22] Ministry and that's a live course the
[9:24] Bible's pling we need a five full
[9:25] ministry so one man cannot do it all
[9:28] Paul say it up as a fful Ministry the
[9:31] next reason I'm a message believer is
[9:33] because of the spirit-led worship
[9:35] Services no doubt I enjoyed some
[9:37] services at the Assembly of God and of
[9:39] course the chapel but when I came to the
[9:41] message the services were the most
[9:43] biblical the Holy Ghost could move
[9:45] during the song service the Holy Ghost
[9:47] could move before service that happened
[9:50] numerous times the Holy Ghost would move
[9:52] during the preaching the Holy Ghost
[9:53] would move after the preaching as we
[9:55] pray and wait on the Lord most sermons
[9:57] are an hour hour and a half some go to
[9:59] to 2 hours some longer when the Holy
[10:01] Ghost is there those 2hour sermons just
[10:03] feel like a few minutes there's
[10:05] spirit-led worship fiery worship fiery
[10:07] prayers the first love of the Holy Ghost
[10:10] is on display in our lives there's
[10:11] forceful preaching there's confession of
[10:14] sins there's deliverance from bondage
[10:17] and so the greatest Services I've ever
[10:18] experienced have been in message
[10:20] churches and I thank the Lord Jesus
[10:22] Christ for that an eighth reason I'm a
[10:24] message believer is because of the
[10:26] prophetic Ministry of God's prophet
[10:29] William brandham before I came to the
[10:31] message I didn't know anything about
[10:32] prophets but as soon as I started
[10:34] studying the Bible I could easily see
[10:36] brother brandham was a genuine prophet
[10:38] of God I have numerous videos about this
[10:41] also chapter 13 of my 2021 book I fully
[10:44] explain the bible-based ministry of
[10:47] God's Prophet brother William brandham I
[10:49] have 30 thus sayith the Lord's
[10:51] statements in that chapter chapter 13
[10:54] proving without a shadow of a doubt
[10:56] brother Brandon was a genuine prophet of
[10:58] God read recently I put out a video with
[11:00] six undeniable thus sayith the Lord
[11:02] prophecies that have come to pass
[11:04] through God's Prophet brother William
[11:06] brandom I've met two people who knew
[11:08] brother brandham and were discerned by
[11:11] the prophetic gift in brother bram's
[11:13] life the Holy Ghost is the discerner of
[11:15] the thoughts and intents of our hearts
[11:17] and that prophetic gift that gift of
[11:18] discernment was in brother brandom's
[11:20] life and Ministry it is undeniable
[11:23] brother brandom gives us the wonderful
[11:24] balance of a prophet everything a
[11:26] prophet says with thus sayith the Lord
[11:28] is infallible but outside of that a
[11:30] prophet is just as human as anyone else
[11:32] brother Ram tells us God doesn't tell us
[11:34] prophets everything a prophet's not
[11:36] infallible just with his own opinions
[11:39] brother Braham told us to be very
[11:40] careful to separate his human opinions
[11:42] from his prophetic Ministry and he said
[11:45] it's so easy to know the prophetic
[11:47] ministry will always say in the name of
[11:48] the Lord or thus sayith the Lord also
[11:51] have a video about all the future
[11:53] Prophecies of brother
[11:54] brandham and of course brother bram's
[11:56] accusers have a falsely accused them of
[11:59] having false prophecies that is not true
[12:02] I have an entire video about some of the
[12:04] common misunderstood thus sayi the Lord
[12:06] statements of brother Brandon please
[12:08] watch this video called the brown bear
[12:10] Vision there are 10 Bible examples of
[12:13] how prophets and Men of God either
[12:16] disobeyed a vision a thus sayith the
[12:18] Lord from God or a thus sayith the Lord
[12:21] changed like in the case of Isaiah and
[12:23] Hezekiah so all these accusers of
[12:25] brother brandham most of them are not
[12:26] preachers most of them are not called to
[12:28] rightly divide the word so of course
[12:30] they can't understand the word of God
[12:32] they just have an evil spirit anointing
[12:34] them to slander God's true Prophet
[12:36] brother brandham and of course I
[12:38] continue to pray for their full
[12:39] repentance and a final reason I love
[12:42] being a message believer is because this
[12:44] message identifies the Bride of Jesus
[12:46] Christ I mentioned this earlier but the
[12:48] Bible says according to Jesus in Matthew
[12:51] 25 there's wise and foolish Christians
[12:54] the wise Christians do the full will of
[12:56] God they have the baptism of the the
[12:58] Holy Ghost in their souls so as message
[13:01] Believers we believe in all the power of
[13:03] the Holy Ghost all the truth of the Holy
[13:05] Ghost and we preach the same gospel that
[13:08] Paul preached Paul said in Galatians 1
[13:10] you're cursed if you change anything
[13:12] about Paul's gospel well we believe we
[13:14] have the Revelation the full revelation
[13:15] of Paul's gospel restored to us and I
[13:18] believe that with all my heart in my
[13:21] 2021 book in chapter 4 I show how we are
[13:24] the true bride of Jesus Christ there's
[13:26] proof in there that our message churches
[13:28] who have the Holy Ghost are the true
[13:30] bride of Jesus Christ I show 14 Pauling
[13:33] doctrines that most churches reject such
[13:36] as the true Revelation on the godhead
[13:37] the water baptism Holiness modesty men
[13:41] preachers only and so many other truths
[13:45] in Romans 2:16 Paul said we'll be judged
[13:47] by his gospel and I'm so thankful that
[13:50] the gospel of St Paul from the Lord
[13:52] Jesus Christ is cleansing Our Lives now
[13:55] and so there will be no condemnation for
[13:56] us on that day as Romans 8 says all
[14:00] other churches as far as I know break
[14:02] some of Paul's teachings but our message
[14:04] churches are the only ones that keep all
[14:07] of Paul's commands now of course we're
[14:09] not perfect but by the grace of God the
[14:11] Holy Ghost is guiding us into all truth
[14:14] much more could be said but I think I'm
[14:15] going to stop right there by God's grace
[14:18] hope you enjoyed this Summary of why I'm
[14:19] a message believer if you have any
[14:22] questions concerns or testimonies about
[14:23] this video please contact me God bless
[14:27] you and may Jesus Christ be the desire
[14:29] of your
[14:33] heart
