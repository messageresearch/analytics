TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] but shun profane and Fain B for they will increase unto more ungodliness God will make you give an account for Every Idle Word that you speak greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to go through the scriptures from St Paul about knowing when to avoid vain babblings endless questions and fables in order to rightly defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor brde of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ that Christ revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late William brandom 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother am's Godly Christian character here's the outline of the video first I want to look at a balance on question asking and then I want to go through numerous portions of scripture where St Paul talks about avoiding vain babblings fables and so forth then we'll close with accusers of the Brethren so let's begin with balance on question asking friends I'm sure you agree with me that we should answer questions people have about the Gospel of Jesus Christ and of course in the context of our lives and our Generations questions people have about God's true Prophet the late William brandham this is according to 1 Peter 3:15 always have an answer to those who have a question about your faith an answer in meekness and fear then 1 Thessalonians 5 says prove all things I love these scriptures I believe these scriptures and I certainly applied them to my life since I started preaching back in 2004 recently this week though I was reading through St Paul's letters to the Thessalonians and to Timothy and I was just again surprised and refreshed to see how many times Paul told Timothy and the Believers to avoid vain babblings fables endless genealogies and so forth so I feel like the Holy Spirit has given me a fresh understanding of this so that's why I felt inspired to make this video so friends we're told always to have an answer and prove all things yet by the same man by the Holy Spirit through Paul who said prove all things he also told us to avoid certain types of questions this then proves that some questions are sincere and other questions are insincere so we need the Holy Spirit and we need God's grace to help us discern who's really interested in learning about Jesus Christ and on the opposite end who's trying to attack Jesus Christ and the true Servants of Jesus Christ This reminds us of the Lord Jesus who said let the blind lead the blind cast not your Pearls Before Swine and we know the Lord Jesus answered all the questions of the Pharisees and Sadducees until that they didn't want to ask any more questions that was during the Lord's Ministry but then when he was arrested there were times during his trials where he did not say a word he did not defend himself at all he didn't answer questions so we know the Holy Ghost will lead and guide us on what to say and when to say it we thank the Lord for the balance on the word of God how we're to prove all things but then also be careful about going down endless rabbit Trails as we might say or fruitless or frivolous conversation s that don't lead us into godliness as we'll begin to see now through the scriptures so let's look at our first passage it's first Timothy 1:3 Paul says to Timothy thou mightest charge some that they teach no other Doctrine so for us as message Believers our Doctrine is the Bible we have no Creed but Christ no book but the Bible so for us we have to remember we teach no other Doctrine except what's in the scripture that Paul told us like women and men's hair length there's no women preachers the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism the three works of Grace and there's numerous other Pauline doctrines that most churches reject and especially accusers of brother brandham they reject the Bible doctrines that Paul gave us 1 Timothy 1:4 says neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith so do very important scripture right here Paul tells Timothy focus on the doctrine don't spend your time on fa endless genealogies because these Minister questions rather than Godly edifying and edifying means stewardship other places it means building up or equipping so here we can see a tactic of Satan Satan's tactic is to get people believing fables or lies and also investing their time in Endless studies which only create more questions and don't build up people's faith I would say many of brother Ram's accusers are guilty of this they've created many fables false assumptions about brother brandom and then they want to ask endless questions some about genealogies but many questions are about the people around brother brandom as I've said before they're trying to get our attention off the word of God that the Lord Jesus revealed to brother brandom so friends let's remember let's be a source of edification a source of stewardship equipping building people up in the doctrine Paul said no other Doctrine so we have to to spend our time on the doctrine not to create more questions but to give them faith-based answers so do Paul told Timothy then in verse 5 the end of the Commandment is Charity of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of Faith unfeigned so that's what the message of the hour produces it produces a pure heart because we only believe the pure word of God from Paul's gospels of course the New Testament and Old Testament as well but it's denominations and Creeds of men that create fables like the Fable that God is three persons that's a complete Fable Paul never taught it Peter never taught it the Bible never taught it and so people that believe these fables or false doctrines something is off in their life we'll get to more about that later by God's grace and also I made a video about that recently 110 proofs from Bible doctrine that the message of the hour is the true Revelation and understanding of the scripture it's proof we are the Bride of Jesus Christ who follow brother Ram's bible-based message 1 Timothy 1 says from which some have swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling so there's people that claim to be Christians but their hearts are no longer pure they don't have genuine Faith anymore and they've swerved aside and they focus on Vain jangling and vain means useless and jangling means Babble or just random talk so instead of spending time on Doctrine these accusers who have the wrong Spirit spend their time on useless Babble as Paul said Babble about fables they've made up endless genealogies endless questions some of these people that have left the message they're the very personification of vanity all the content they produce on social media or any other public platform is useless it doesn't lead people back to the Scripture it leads them to more and more questions in order to slander and defame in many cases brother Brandon but also the current preachers of the message of the hour the second passage is in the same book 1 Timothy 4 we'll start at verse 6 read 67 and 16 Paul says nourish up the Saints in the words of faith and good Doctrine but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness so profane means Wicked in the Greek so there are some group of Christians they don't focus on faith and good Doctrine they just tell Wicked fables or Wicked madeup stories and here's my humble opinion of some of these profane fables it is a profane Fable of some of the accusers of brother brandham that say brother brandham is responsible for Jim Jones's wickedness that's a profane Fable shortly after brother random and Jim Jones went separate ways Jim Jones started exalting himself as God I have three videos on this so I'll leave links to that in the description and by the end of his life Jim Jones was a complete Wicked heretic not even preaching the Bible so shame on those people who slander brother brandom and create this profane Fable and try to make brother Bram responsible for the wicked sins of Jim Jones another Fable is that brother Brandon was in cahoots with the KKK that's a fable where brother Brandon was in cahoots with Roy Davis that's a fable and there's so many other Wicked fables people have made made up about brother Brenham and they're spending their time on the fables rather than faith and good Doctrine like the doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism like the doctrine of women should have long uncut hair and never cut it and it's a shame if they do it's a shame if men grow their hair long and uncut notice what Paul says about this good Doctrine in verse 16 take heed unto thyself and to the doctrine continue in them for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee so this is doctrine that saves of course Doctrine is instruction so instructing people how to repent have faith in Jesus Christ and the blood of Jesus Christ saved by grace through faith and then as Ephesians 2:10 says do good works that God has created us for we are God's workmanship created unto good works the third passage is 1 Timothy 620 and 21 Paul told Timothy avoid profane and vain babblings then in verse 21 which some profan blessing have aired concerning the faith so Paul said some Christians AED in their faith by giving too much time to babbling again fruitless talk fruitless discussions empty discussions that do not build faith and cause more questions than answers so we can clearly see those people who are attacking brother brandom due to their cognitive dissonance and falsely accusing brother brandom of things he's not guilty of this proves they've aired in their faith and those people the Bible says we should avoid a fourth passage is 2 Timothy 2:1 15-19 Paul tells Timothy to study himself approved says very similar words to the first letter of Timothy verse 16 but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness here's a major point about when we know someone is involved in profane and vain babblings we must observe is their life getting more Godly or ungodly if they're allowing more sin in their life Liv then they're clearly guilty of profane and vain babblings so remember people that ask questions about brother brandom it's okay to ask questions if a person is humbly wanting to know but if they're asking endless questions and then their lives are not being cleaned up they're actually being more degraded in sin then you know you don't have to talk to them anymore you don't have to answer their questions anymore cuz we're told to shun them we're told to avoid them and notice all their wicked and vain babblings it eats like a canker and second Timothy 2:17 and then in verse 19 2 Timothy 2:19 here's how we know let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity so again the true Servants of God will help people depart from iniquity depart from sin I think now might be a good time to go over those 14 Pauline doctrines that most churches reject Paul was against homosexual relationships he was against adulterous relationships he was against fornication he was against murder which of course relates to birth control control today he was against women preachers he was against substance abuse smoking cigarettes drunkenness so forth CU they defile the body the Temple of the Holy Ghost he was against viewing sinful movies and television shows according to 1 Thessalonians 5:22 avoid all appearance of evil Paul was against shameful or repulsive hair lengths 1 Corinthians 111-116 he was against false conversions and taught you get the Holy Ghost sometime after you believe not when you believe he was against immodest clothing he taught women to wear modest clothing of course men as well then he taught the water baptism full immersion in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he taught Believers to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their souls he taught that the godhead is a mystery Colossians 2:2 but he never taught Jesus was a second person he taught Jesus was the express image of the person of God Hebrews 1:3 Paul never said God was three persons so person who has the holy ghost or is moving towards the baptism of the Holy Ghost in justification and sanctification will strive with all their hearts to obey these commands from St Paul and that's just a short list of commands that lead us unto Holiness all because of the love of God Jesus said if you love me keep my commands the fifth and final passage is 2 Timothy 4: 2-5 Paul tells Timothy preach the word exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine and here's where we are today verse three the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust they shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears verse four and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables so a lot of people that leave the message they don't want sound Doctrine anymore they don't want those doctrines I just listed there from St Paul and they're turned unto fables madeup stories Fable in the Greek means fiction myth or tales and that's what they spend their time on fables like fables about Jim Jones fables that question brother ROM's marriage relationship questions about the KKK questions about the Freemasons all these false accusations are simply fables Paul says make full proof of thy Ministry and of course if you make full proof of your ministry it's through the word of God the sound Doctrine we see here in this passage those that spend their time on endless questions endless genealogies profane fables they're really living a life of lust see because their teachers allow them to live in their own lust 2 Timothy 4:3 Paul also said they're lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God and these are the people that deny the sound doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism the three works of Grace the godhead is one person modest clothing for women and men uncut hair on women all these are backed up by perfecting Holiness in the fear of God as Paul said in 2 Corinthians 7:1 perfecting Holiness in the fear of God let us cleanse ourselves let's move on to the final section here accusers of the Brethren friends it's really sad some of these accusers of brother brandham and of course the fful ministry that's still alive today it seems they spend a lot of their free time listening to message preachers and brother brandham just to find fault with brother brandham and the preachers that are Al today think of what sad lives they're living they're fulfilling the scriptures that we just went through from 1 Timothy from second Timothy they're not fulfilling the holy scriptures they're fulfilling the scriptures about vain babblings endless genealogies and their lives are getting increasingly more ungodly this desire to accuse the real Brethren is a critical spirit it's an evil spirit Proverbs 17:20 here's how you know someone has an evil spirit he that hath a frower heart a critical spirit findeth no good so people with critical Spirits find nothing good about the one they're criticizing and then he that hath a perverse tongue Proverbs 7 20 falls into Mischief those people's sins will eventually find them out these people only want to criticize brother brandham and living preachers most of their accusations are false or presumption jumping to false conclusions brother Ram is always Guilty By Association they don't say anything good about brother bram's preaching his teaching his prophecies I have a video with six prophecies that have come to pass from Brother brandham with us sayith the Lord and many of the accusers are either ignorant of it or they just don't know about it the Pharisees and and herodians would only try to catch Jesus in his words to find fault with him Mark 12:13 just like the presidents and princes in Daniel's time in Daniel 6:4 they spent all their time trying to find an occasion or fault against Daniel that's the same thing same Spirit people have today trying to accuse brother brandom remember the Bible said in Revelation Satan is the accuser of the Brethren right so a critical spirit is one of Satan's demons that he deceived and anoints people to criticize the true Servants of God one more verse here 2 Chronicles 36: 12 and then 15 and 16 zedekiah is king of Israel at this time and the Bible said he did evil in the sight of the Lord he humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the Lord so I'm going to apply this of course to our day people today will not humble themselves to the prophet of God brother William brandham who spoke from the mouth of the Lord when brother Bram said thus sayith the Lord it came to pass and they did the same thing to St Paul in one way the same thing to Timothy they didn't humble themselves to the word of God that Paul had taught Timothy 2 Chronicles 36:15 says God sent them the prophets because he had compassion on his people so that's why God sent brother brandom he had compassion on the churches trying to get them to turn and of course all the elect that would be saved fulfilled Revelation 18:4 come out of her my people here's the sad part in verse 16 but they mocked The Messengers of God and despise his words and misuse His prophets until the Wrath of the Lord arose against his people till there was no remedy that's what we have today friends many accusers of brother brandham they won't recognize the over 110 differences between the bride and all of their churches I'll leave a link to that video in the description they won't humble themselves to God's teaching on there's one person the godhead women should not cut their hair the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism and so many more they mock brother brandom they despise brother bram's Bible preaching and they misuse brother ROM's Words which means they cheat or they deceive using Brother braham's words they make brother Braham say something he didn't mean they misuse his words I've seen that many times one simple example is on the Jim Jones video and also the false accusation of racism video there's clear examples on those videos if you want to go watch those these accusers of brother brandham they listen to brother brandham and they can't even understand his words because they have cognitive dissonance evil spirits and so they misuse the prophet's words in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God it was refreshing to go over all these scriptures where Paul is telling Timothy to focus on the doctrine the word of God the Bible teaching Bible instruction that Paul had taught Timothy the same applies to us we focus on the Bible teachings that brother Ram preached to us through Paul's gospel and of course all the New Testament books and Old Testament books hopefully through this video now you have an understanding on when you can stop answering people's questions the Holy Ghost will show show you when to do that you don't have to answer every question there's endless conversations there's endless questioning people can take you through endless babblings endless unfruitful conversations endless unfruitful debates so the Holy Ghost will help us to know when to shun when to avoid and when to answer questions by the grace of God let's pray for brother Rams accusers Lord God I just pray for those who have left the message and are accusing brother random falsley or preachers that are alive today Lord I pray they'll repent of their false accusations their reviling their false conclusions these profane Vain jangling and babblings Lord Jesus father I just pray your spirit would help them Lord God I know you will Lord to all who will be saved the elect cannot be deceived may all those that want to be saved and want to have the truth may they be saved for the glory of God you told us to ask abundantly that we might receive Lord God told us to pray without in so Lord I know you hear my prayer today Lord God so we thank you for the truth Lord may it set more people free we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
