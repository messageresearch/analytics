[0:12] the spirit of
[0:15] homosexuality the Bible teaches about
[0:17] the characteristics of the spirit of
[0:19] homosexuality through the word of God we
[0:21] can understand why God considers this
[0:24] sin an Abomination or disgusting thing
[0:27] and why he judged Sodom and Gomorrah
[0:29] with fire and Bre Brimstone for being so
[0:31] consumed with this
[0:33] lifestyle first this Spirit publicly
[0:36] declares its sin and is proud of it yet
[0:40] God detests this public Declaration of
[0:43] sin Isaiah 3:9 the show of their
[0:46] countenance doth witness against them
[0:48] and they declare their sin as Sodom they
[0:50] hide it not woe unto their soul for they
[0:53] have rewarded evil unto
[0:56] themselves second this Spirit was known
[0:58] to get aggressive and violent toward
[1:01] anyone who called their sin Wicked This
[1:04] was seen in lot's life from Genesis 19
[1:08] lot called their lifestyle wickedness so
[1:10] they targeted their lust toward him and
[1:12] threatened him with
[1:14] violence Genesis 19 verse 9 now we will
[1:17] deal worse with thee than with them and
[1:20] they pressed sore upon the man even lot
[1:22] and came near to break the door third
[1:25] this Spirit of homosexuality rejects the
[1:28] perfect compliment mentary holy
[1:31] reproductive design of God the male and
[1:34] female design as the Bible says
[1:36] homosexuality is
[1:38] unnatural the Bible says homosexuality
[1:41] is a physical abuse upon the bodies of
[1:44] those who partake in it due to these
[1:47] three defiant ungodly characteristics
[1:50] the Bible said God gives unrepentant
[1:52] homosexuals over to a reprobate mind in
[1:55] Romans
[1:56] 1:28 a mindset that God totally Rejects
[2:00] and condemns for these did not want to
[2:02] retain the knowledge of God in their
[2:04] minds according to Romans
[2:06] 1:28 and instead Fill Their Minds with
[2:09] hatred toward the Bible and pleasure in
[2:12] Vile
[2:13] lusts the spreading and acceptance of
[2:16] homosexuality has allowed Satan to
[2:18] accomplish the construction of his own
[2:21] Eden here on Earth Satan's Eden which is
[2:24] the completely opposite State than God's
[2:26] original Garden of Eden in God's Garden
[2:29] of Eden his son and daughter Adam and
[2:31] Eve were to obey his word and fully
[2:33] trust in him and cling to one another
[2:36] man to woman through the perversion of
[2:39] vile lust Satan has formed the exact
[2:41] opposite atmosphere in the lives of
[2:43] Millions on this Earth a state where
[2:45] couples reject God's word and cling man
[2:49] to man or woman to woman rather than
[2:51] male to female proving it is Satan's
[2:54] [Music]
[2:55] Eden Jesus's Prophecy of the increase of
[2:59] homosexual
[3:01] uality most people are totally unaware
[3:04] that nearly 2,000 years ago Jesus Christ
[3:06] himself predicted the rise in the
[3:08] acceptance of homosexuality that we are
[3:11] seeing today in Luke 17:
[3:15] 24-36 Jesus gave a description of the
[3:18] conditions of the world at the time of
[3:20] the end when he the son of man would be
[3:22] revealed at his second
[3:24] coming Jesus said there would be dual
[3:26] conditions for a second coming days like
[3:29] the days of Noah the first condition and
[3:32] lot the second condition remember this
[3:35] prophecy was spoken by our Lord nearly
[3:36] 2,000 years
[3:38] ago and as it was in the days of Noah so
[3:41] shall it also be in the days of the son
[3:43] of man they did eat they drank they
[3:46] married wives they were given in
[3:47] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[3:49] into the ark and the flood came and
[3:51] destroyed them all likewise also as it
[3:54] was in the days of lot they did eat they
[3:57] drank they bought they sold they planted
[3:59] they build it
[4:00] but the same day that lot went out of
[4:02] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[4:03] heaven and destroyed them all even thus
[4:07] shall it be in the day when the son of
[4:08] man is revealed to begin with the days
[4:11] of Noah were described as having the
[4:12] following conditions which are easily
[4:14] seen taking place in today's world
[4:17] people unconcerned about God's Wrath
[4:19] expressing their continuation to eat
[4:21] drink and marry right up until the day
[4:23] the flood came sons of God or Believers
[4:26] that are men would marry unbelieving
[4:28] women the daughters of men men simply
[4:30] because they were fair or attractive and
[4:32] not because of the humble Godly
[4:34] character great wickedness was in the
[4:36] heart of nearly every person because all
[4:39] their thoughts were only evil
[4:40] continually the Earth was filled with
[4:44] violence next the days of lot were
[4:46] described as having the following
[4:48] conditions which are easily seen taking
[4:50] place in today's world people
[4:53] unconcerned about God's Wrath Express in
[4:55] their continuation to eat drink Buy sell
[4:58] plant and build right up until the day
[5:00] fire and brimstone destroy them due to
[5:02] the anger and wrath of
[5:05] God economic and agricultural prosperity
[5:09] in Sodom blinded them of their spiritual
[5:11] nakedness and moral
[5:13] bankruptcy the men were exceedingly
[5:15] Wicked before the Lord because of their
[5:17] Grievous sins with not even 10 righteous
[5:20] people in the entire city of Sodom a
[5:22] people that would not repent from their
[5:25] sin young and old people were given over
[5:27] to homosexuality which lot wickedness
[5:30] and God called abominable or
[5:33] disgusting the people of Sodom had gay
[5:35] pride they declared their sin publicly
[5:38] and did not hide it as seen through the
[5:40] frequent gay pride parades all over the
[5:42] world
[5:43] [Music]
[5:45] today homosexuality is wrong in the eyes
[5:48] of God and always has been although it
[5:51] may be accepted in the eyes of the
[5:52] United States Supreme Court based upon
[5:54] their decision to legalize gay marriage
[5:56] on Friday June 26 2015
[6:00] since God is unchanging and judge Sodom
[6:02] and Gomorrah for their sexual sins God
[6:04] will judge the United States as well for
[6:06] their acceptance of these sexual sins if
[6:09] God does not judge the United States for
[6:11] the sin of homosexuality then he would
[6:13] have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah and
[6:15] apologize to them for destroying them
[6:17] and not destroying the United States it
[6:20] seems the prophecy Jesus gave in Luke
[6:22] 17:24 to 36 is fulfilled the sins of
[6:26] Noah's day and lot's day are running
[6:28] rampant upon this Earth
[6:30] the Earth is right for judgment but
[6:32] before that Jesus Will Rapture his holy
[6:34] ghost filled bride off the Earth in
[6:38] closing although homosexuality is an
[6:41] abominable sin it is not the
[6:43] unforgivable sin that is blasphemy of
[6:45] the Holy Ghost or those who purposely
[6:47] call The Works of God the works of the
[6:49] devil but those who are trapped in the
[6:52] Sin of homosexuality still have hope
[6:54] through the blood of Jesus Christ if
[6:56] they genuinely repent of their lust and
[6:59] seek the washing regenerative powers of
[7:01] the Holy Spirit freedom from this lust
[7:04] has been accomplished before and is also
[7:06] being accomplished today through the
[7:08] power of God in the days of St Paul
[7:11] Christians in the Church of Corinth had
[7:14] once been addicted to the sin of
[7:16] homosexuality but through repentance and
[7:18] sanctification they were able to
[7:20] experience the complete cleansing of the
[7:22] Holy
[7:23] Ghost know ye not that the unrighteous
[7:25] shall not inherit the kingdom of God be
[7:27] not deceived neither fornicate Hatters
[7:29] nor doubters nor adulterers nor feminite
[7:33] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[7:36] which are
[7:37] homosexuals nor thieves nor Covetous nor
[7:40] drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners
[7:43] shall inherit the kingdom of God and
[7:45] such were some of you but ye are washed
[7:48] but ye are Sanctified but ye are
[7:50] justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[7:52] and by the spirit of our
[7:54] God we know that all of God's children
[7:57] who battle this sin will experience the
[7:59] same cleansing through the washing power
[8:02] of the Holy Ghost in the days of Sodom
[8:05] and Gomorrah there were only three
[8:06] groups of person could belong in the
[8:09] largest group was the multitudes in
[8:11] Sodom and Gomorrah that accepted the sin
[8:13] of homosexuality and did not speak
[8:15] against it this group suffered the wrath
[8:17] of God the second group was lot and his
[8:21] daughters who narrowly escaped the fire
[8:23] and brimstone of God's Wrath against the
[8:25] sin of
[8:26] homosexuality lot and his group had
[8:28] enough Bible sense to call homosexuality
[8:31] wickedness but still chose to closely
[8:33] associate and Surround themselves with
[8:36] people of this lifestyle in order to
[8:38] benefit
[8:39] financially the third and final group
[8:41] was Abraham and his family and servants
[8:44] this group never lived in Sodom but were
[8:46] totally separated from Sodom and all of
[8:48] its Financial benefits choosing instead
[8:51] to live according to all the word of God
[8:54] Abraham prayed for lot that he would be
[8:56] spared from the wrath of God so which
[8:59] group will will you be in today will you
[9:01] just go with the flow with the majority
[9:03] of society and happily accept the
[9:05] abomination of
[9:07] homosexuality or will you be in the
[9:09] group that has enough conviction to call
[9:11] homosexuality a sin and wickedness but
[9:13] still try to associate with the majority
[9:16] in order for financial
[9:18] benefits or will you separate yourself
[9:20] from all associations with the sin of
[9:23] homosexuality living a separated life
[9:25] from all traits of sin fully obeying the
[9:28] Bible and spend your time praying and
[9:31] interceding for God to save those who
[9:33] are entangled in the associations of
[9:36] homosexual groups we pray that you will
[9:38] choose to be Abraham's seed for we are
[9:40] Abraham's seed through faith in Christ
[9:42] Jesus and the receiving of the promise
[9:44] of the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[9:47] according to Galatians 3:14
[9:50] 26-29 that The Blessing of Abraham might
[9:53] come on the Gentiles through Jesus
[9:55] Christ that we might receive the promise
[9:57] of the spirit through faith
[10:00] if you would like more Bible teaching
[10:01] about homosexuality and also prayer for
[10:04] deliverance from this temptation please
[10:06] contact
[10:07] us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[10:10] the desire of your heart
