[0:00] [Music]
[0:04] On July 5th, 1964,
[0:07] God's prophet William Brandham preached
[0:09] the sermon called the masterpiece.
[0:13] Sermon was over 2 hours and 17 minutes
[0:15] long. After talking and doing
[0:18] introductions for the first 13 minutes,
[0:20] Brother Random took his text in Isaiah
[0:23] 53 and read the entire chapter. The
[0:27] foundation of brother Ram's sermon
[0:28] called the masterpiece is Jesus Christ.
[0:32] His life, death, burial, and
[0:34] resurrection. Jesus Christ is the
[0:37] masterpiece of God. William Brandham
[0:39] preached on his inspiration on where he
[0:42] got this thought. He showed he got it
[0:45] from Michelangelo's sculpture of Moses
[0:49] finished around 1513 or 1515.
[0:54] Brother Ram said, "What made this a
[0:56] masterpiece was when the vision in
[0:58] Michelangelo's mind became a reality and
[1:00] then he smoked his masterpiece and
[1:03] commanded it to speak."
[1:06] For over an hour and 10 minutes, Brother
[1:07] Random preached on how Michelangelo's
[1:10] masterpiece was like God's masterpiece.
[1:14] When he sent his only begotten son, the
[1:16] Lord Jesus Christ, God Almighty told the
[1:19] son to speak on Mount Transfiguration.
[1:22] Then he was smitten on Calvary.
[1:25] In Michelangelo's story, he finished the
[1:28] sculpture, told it to speak, and then
[1:31] smote it.
[1:33] So, Brother Ram drew this parallel for
[1:35] over an hour and 10 minutes. And then
[1:37] about the hour and 22 mark, Brother Ram
[1:40] makes this statement and says, "I'm
[1:41] going to share with you, brethren, and
[1:43] especially the Pentecostals, my
[1:45] masterpiece."
[1:47] Now, Pentecostal brethren throughout the
[1:50] nations, I want you to listen, my
[1:52] brother, if this is the last message
[1:53] I'll ever preach.
[1:56] This is my masterpiece.
[1:59] When I heard this, I was pleasantly
[2:01] surprised. I've listened to the sermon
[2:04] before, but I never caught this thought
[2:06] about brother Brandham's own
[2:08] masterpiece. I was listening
[2:10] attentively. What was Brother Brandham's
[2:13] masterpiece?
[2:15] For around the next 30 minutes, Brother
[2:16] Ram showed how the wheat plant, its
[2:19] cycle of life, death, burial, and
[2:22] resurrection was his masterpiece. And it
[2:25] included at least five major Bible
[2:28] revelations.
[2:30] The first revelation he talked about,
[2:33] and these are in no particular order,
[2:35] are the anointed ones at the end time
[2:37] from Matthew 24:4.
[2:39] Brother Brham made the observation that
[2:42] the chaff was very similar and very
[2:45] close to the original seed, but it
[2:47] wasn't. So, brother Ram noted how this
[2:49] was like the Pentecostal movement. It
[2:51] was so close when the Holy Ghost fell to
[2:53] Isuza Street, but they eventually got
[2:54] off the word and denominated. They had
[2:56] the right anointing at first, but then
[2:58] they brought in false doctrines.
[3:01] What's nature?
[3:03] Nature exactly is God. God working in
[3:07] nature is all he can. But from the
[3:09] Pentecostal revival as they think was
[3:12] the seed, it wasn't. Now watch. But
[3:15] something come forth just like the seed.
[3:18] And watch what Jesus said in St. Matthew
[3:21] 24:24.
[3:23] That the two spirits at the last days
[3:26] would be so close together it would
[3:28] deceive the elected if possible.
[3:32] Now that stalk don't look nothing like a
[3:34] seed. Neither does a toss look like a
[3:36] seed. But notice now not in Luther's day
[3:40] but in the last day.
[3:42] So the anointed ones at the end times
[3:44] which he preached the next year in 1965
[3:47] was a major revelation of his
[3:49] masterpiece.
[3:51] The next two elements were both the
[3:52] church ages and the three works of
[3:54] grace. As brother Random said all nature
[3:58] everything works right with with the
[3:59] word of God. And here it is exactly
[4:02] perfectly in these church ages. That's
[4:04] the reason the Holy Ghost came down and
[4:06] drawed those things and made them out
[4:07] for us the way he has. It's exactly
[4:10] notice the life that was in the husk in
[4:14] the stalk and in the tossel in the husk
[4:17] all gathers in the seed and the life
[4:20] that was in the stalk went one went to
[4:24] make the other.
[4:27] Justification made a way for
[4:29] sanctification.
[4:30] Sanctification made a way for the
[4:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost. The baptism
[4:36] of the Holy Ghost made a way for the
[4:38] Holy Ghost itself to come right down in
[4:40] perfection back to the word again to
[4:42] manifest itself.
[4:45] So, as these visuals show, Brother Ram
[4:47] used the wheat plant to show the
[4:48] progress of how the wheat goes through
[4:51] three stages. stalk which represents the
[4:54] Lutheran church, the head which
[4:57] represents the Methodist movement, and
[4:59] then back to the seed which is the bride
[5:01] of Jesus Christ, those who believe
[5:03] Brother Brandham's Bible-based message
[5:05] and who are filled with the baptism of
[5:07] the Holy Ghost. To make it as simple as
[5:10] possible, the wheat plant is almost like
[5:12] a timeline. Martin Luther started his
[5:14] ministry around 1517, representing the
[5:17] stalk. John Wesley had a deeper
[5:20] religious experience that stirred him up
[5:23] around 1738. The Holy Ghost fell on
[5:26] Isuza Street in 1906 and the bride of
[5:29] Jesus Christ began to receive the major
[5:33] teachings of the third pole in 1963
[5:36] when brother Random preached the
[5:37] revelation of the seven seals which he
[5:39] called his new commission, the opening
[5:41] of the word, the third pole.
[5:45] And then it come to me, not a voice,
[5:47] just come to me. Oh,
[5:50] that is the angels of the Lord coming to
[5:55] give me a new commission.
[5:58] See the first pull healing. Second pull
[6:03] prophesy. Third pull the opening of the
[6:06] word.
[6:07] The mysteries revealed.
[6:11] No more. There's no more higher
[6:14] order to reveal the word than prophets.
[6:19] But the only way the prophet can be a
[6:21] vindicated is by the word.
[6:23] And remember the third pool was the
[6:25] opening of them seven seals to reveal
[6:27] the hidden truth that's been sealed in
[6:29] the word.
[6:31] Jesus Christ also taught this
[6:33] masterpiece in Mark 4:28. He said the
[6:36] kingdom of God was like a wheat plant.
[6:39] First the blade which represents the
[6:41] stalk, the Lutheran church. Then the ear
[6:44] which is also called the head which
[6:45] represents the Methodist movement. After
[6:48] that the full corn in the ear which
[6:50] represents brother Ram's ministry
[6:52] bringing us back to the original word.
[6:55] The fourth revelation is that
[6:56] denominations are dead because they've
[6:59] added to the word or taken away from the
[7:01] word as brother Brandham said when he
[7:03] quoted Revelation 22:18 and 19.
[7:07] Amen.
[7:08] Don't you see why he never used an
[7:10] organization? He can't get back in it
[7:13] again. It's dead.
[7:15] But the life passes on from one to the
[7:17] other.
[7:20] Hallelujah.
[7:22] See the creeds and inject. Whosoever
[7:24] shall add one word or take one word out.
[7:26] See, he's blocked off from it. It must
[7:30] be the life seed traveling on.
[7:33] Notice what they have done. All these
[7:36] have done is proved by history just
[7:39] exactly the way the church has come.
[7:41] Never to be useful to him again.
[7:46] Organization is laid on the shelf. There
[7:48] never has been in all the history a
[7:51] church after it organized. But what it
[7:53] died
[7:56] and the organization died and never did
[8:00] raise again.
[8:02] Can't you see men who are blind? Open
[8:05] your eyes. Nature and the word
[8:09] coordinating together and proving it
[8:11] right here that this is the truth.
[8:16] That it is the truth that life leaves a
[8:19] stalk to make the tossle. From the
[8:21] tossel it makes the husk and from the
[8:23] husk it goes into the original.
[8:26] Never
[8:27] again.
[8:28] notice never again to be useful to him.
[8:33] And the fifth and final revelation in
[8:36] brother Ram's masterpiece is the end
[8:38] time restoration of the original church.
[8:41] The same power and brother Ram says the
[8:43] same doctrine as the book of Acts
[8:45] church.
[8:46] He's the same doctrine that come forth
[8:48] from the beginning.
[8:50] Brother Ram told us Malachi 45 and 6
[8:53] taught this revelation. Luke 17:30,
[8:56] Revelation 1 11, Revelation 10:7, and
[9:01] Joel 2:23-26.
[9:04] And of course, there's many other verses
[9:05] that back all these five revelations up.
[9:09] Brother Ram said he could have spent
[9:10] hours on this section of the sermon, but
[9:13] it was only about 30 minutes.
[9:17] Alpha and Omega, it's become the first
[9:19] and the last. Oh my brother. Uh we can
[9:23] stay hours on that.
[9:26] How is this bride going to do this? How
[9:28] is this uh wheat going to do this?
[9:30] Malachi 4 said in the last days it would
[9:34] be restored back.
[9:36] What? Restored back like the beginning.
[9:40] Amen.
[9:41] Take it back. I will restore saith the
[9:44] Lord. All the years the palmer worm and
[9:46] canker worm and all these other things
[9:48] eaten. I will restore again. Malachi 4
[9:51] said he will restore the hearts of the
[9:54] people and the faith of the people back
[9:56] to their original fathers again.
[10:00] We see this right before us, church.
[10:03] Where are we at?
[10:05] [Music]
[10:08] He started on the day of Pentecost
[10:12] to build another masterpiece. The
[10:14] original seed word
[10:18] started in the first church. What was
[10:20] it? The seed word, the word manifested,
[10:24] the promise that had been given. Joel
[10:27] said, "It shall come to pass in the last
[10:29] days, sayith God, I'll pour out my
[10:30] spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and
[10:32] daughters shall prophesy. Your old man
[10:34] shall dream dreams. Your young man shall
[10:36] see visions." What he would do in the
[10:38] last days, too, last 2,000 years. Notice
[10:41] amen.
[10:42] [Music]
[10:45] The word has become flesh.
[10:48] Exactly like he promised in Luke 17,
[10:50] Malachi 4 and all. That's right.
[10:54] Revelations.
[10:58] And then around the 1 hour and 52 minute
[11:01] mark, brother Ram tells for the first
[11:03] time the preview of the bride vision. He
[11:06] spends about eight minutes on this
[11:08] vision
[11:10] and I think it can be summarized with
[11:12] this simple illustration. Brother Ram
[11:14] has seen a vision of the preview of the
[11:16] bride. The first bride he sees is the
[11:19] book of Acts church which would be true
[11:21] Holy Ghostfilled believers that have the
[11:24] true seed of God, the baptism of the
[11:25] Holy Ghost. Next, Brother Ram gets
[11:27] discouraged and sad when he sees
[11:29] churches of the United States, churches
[11:31] of Asia, churches from all around the
[11:34] world led by a witch, which Brother Ram
[11:36] said was the World Council of Churches.
[11:39] But when the women were coming, the
[11:42] leader of them was a witch.
[11:45] And this witch,
[11:48] to my notion, it's nothing else in the
[11:50] world, but she's a she's that world
[11:53] council of church is leading him right
[11:55] straight down the road where she was
[11:56] going,
[11:59] dancing to rock and roll, smoking
[12:00] cigarettes, wearing makeup, short hair.
[12:03] But then, Brother Ram hears the voice
[12:04] say, "The bride's going to come again."
[12:06] And it's a bride from all nations who
[12:09] looks and acts just like the original
[12:12] bride of Jesus Christ in the beginning.
[12:15] So here's where we get the revelation of
[12:18] the life of the wheat plant. A wheat
[12:20] plant starts with seed, but it must go
[12:22] through all the stages in order to
[12:23] produce the seed again by the grace of
[12:25] God. Brother Ram used Revelation 1 to
[12:28] teach this truth. Jesus is the first and
[12:31] the last. So the full word of God was in
[12:34] the first church, the Ephesians church
[12:36] age, the book of Acts church, and the
[12:38] fullness of the word and power and
[12:39] doctrine will be in the last church age,
[12:42] the bride of Jesus Christ. Brother Ram
[12:45] said Christ in the church would be the
[12:46] first and the last, the alpha and omega.
[12:50] The alpha has become omega.
[12:54] Amen.
[12:57] The first
[12:59] become the last and the last is the
[13:02] first.
[13:03] The seed that went in has come through a
[13:06] process and become the seed again.
[13:11] The alpha and omega is the same. Now he
[13:15] said I am alpha and omega. You never say
[13:17] anything in between.
[13:20] I'm alpha and omega. The first and the
[13:23] last. That's sir. The first ministry and
[13:27] the last ministry is the same.
[13:28] Amen.
[13:29] The first message and the second last
[13:31] message is the same name.
[13:33] I'm I was an alpha. I'm an omega.
[13:36] But the bride came back cuz she is alpha
[13:39] and omega. God the great sculpture has
[13:43] made him a masterpiece.
[13:46] This is such a beautiful revelation.
[13:48] Brother Ram said this revelation made
[13:50] him the happiest person.
[13:52] Hallelujah.
[13:54] Oh mom, happiest person in the world.
[13:59] God has let me see this.
[14:03] Watch how perfect the word and these
[14:05] nature works together.
[14:08] And then from the 2hour mark to the end
[14:11] of the sermon about 17 minutes, Brother
[14:12] Bram closes with prayer, singing, and
[14:16] worship to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[14:19] Today we thank God for God's
[14:21] masterpiece, the Lord Jesus Christ, and
[14:24] also the masterpiece God gave to his
[14:26] prophet William Brandham, the
[14:28] masterpiece of the wheat plant.
