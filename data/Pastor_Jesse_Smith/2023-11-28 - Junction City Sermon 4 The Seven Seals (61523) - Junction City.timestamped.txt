[0:13] Lord willing we'll be reading here for
[0:15] the next hour so I'll try to preach
[0:17] about an hour here so let me set a
[0:22] timer Revelation chapter 6 verses 1 and
[0:27] two maybe we can all read both verses
[0:30] verses 1 and two maybe we can all read
[0:31] it together in unison let's begin on
[0:32] three 1 2 3 and I saw when the lamb
[0:36] opened one of the seals and I heard as
[0:40] it were the noise of Thunder one of the
[0:43] four beasts saying come and see and I
[0:47] saw and behold a white horse and he that
[0:52] sat on him had a bow and a crown was
[0:56] given unto him and he went forth
[0:59] conquering and to conquer may God add
[1:02] His blessings to the re's word may be
[1:03] seated and I'm going to pass these out
[1:06] here um I got my copy highlighted a
[1:09] little bit so I'm going to keep that
[1:10] copy
[1:11] myself
[1:13] and I'll give these to the adults the
[1:15] children want one do you want one buddy
[1:17] do that okay maybe all right you like
[1:25] one we'll start on the side that says
[1:27] seven Church ages at the top and I just
[1:30] made this in about an hour before I left
[1:31] so I didn't have a whole lot of time to
[1:32] work on it I had a busy Daye today uh
[1:35] and yesterday but um we'll start on this
[1:38] side which says the Seven
[1:40] Seals sorry the seven Church ages rather
[1:43] there's
[1:46] two or willing we'll just try to cover
[1:48] this briefly uh uh I got the grace of
[1:51] God and also I can share with brother
[1:54] Irvin and any I guess really anybody
[1:56] who's interested but I like I like the
[1:57] Elder you know I like to share
[1:59] everything with the Elder cuz he's been
[2:00] around and serving God the longest and
[2:02] has uh likely the mo no doubt likely the
[2:05] most wisdom and experience with the word
[2:07] of God uh because I I I want to make
[2:10] sure I I I say everything as possibly as
[2:13] as true as possible you I'm a human I'm
[2:15] I'm prone to mistakes but I want to say
[2:16] exactly what's right uh by the grace of
[2:19] God I want to represent the ministry or
[2:21] the message that God gave to brother
[2:22] brandom correctly and then I want you to
[2:25] uh I want uh brother Iran as the Elder
[2:27] to be able to uh ask questions and if
[2:29] anyone has any questions you're welcome
[2:30] but I want him uh to be able to review
[2:32] it if he'd like to because uh he's he's
[2:34] the Elder by God's
[2:36] grace um I have a little note here with
[2:39] a few reminders I want to remind myself
[2:42] here um before we start that just a few
[2:46] uh quotes brother Bram said about uh the
[2:48] Seven
[2:49] Seals just so you know uh brother
[2:51] Brandon preached the Seven Seals in
[2:53] March of
[2:55] 1963 uh so I think that's 54 years ago
[2:58] if I'm not mistaken maybe 55
[3:01] um and he preached each seal one night
[3:04] uh during a whole week well before he
[3:06] preached him he would read other books
[3:08] other preachers preach for example
[3:10] Clarence Lin Uriah Smith and Charles Tas
[3:14] Russell those are leaders of other
[3:17] groups like for example Lin was a
[3:19] Baptist uh Charles T Russell if I'm not
[3:22] mistaken uh was uh Jehovah's Witness if
[3:26] I'm not mistaken or Seventh Day
[3:27] Adventist sometimes I get those mixed up
[3:30] um so anyways brother R read different
[3:32] writers men who had died and wrote about
[3:34] the Seven Seals but then as you can hear
[3:37] on tape each morning before he'd preach
[3:39] like the first seal the Holy Spirit
[3:41] would visit him and actually show the
[3:43] true interpretation of the seal so
[3:45] brother R was doing his part to study
[3:47] preachers and to try to find the will of
[3:50] God but then the Holy Spirit would come
[3:51] through show him the vision he'd write
[3:53] it down and then he' go preach it that
[3:55] night and then he'd say that's thus
[3:56] sayeth the Lord I've never heard every
[3:58] preacher say that before right and that
[4:01] would make sense because he was a
[4:02] prophet of God he was a man of God which
[4:05] one brother you need anything oh was
[4:08] TR oh how to record it you can sit up
[4:10] here you want record yeah that's fine
[4:12] bro you have to set right up here have
[4:14] to grab my Bible out of the oh yeah
[4:15] that's go ahead you fine I think I can
[4:18] get it that's nice place for your Bible
[4:21] there yep that's fine praise God Amen so
[4:26] brother bam uh tells us that he read all
[4:29] these books other words brother R was a
[4:30] studied man he tried to study as much as
[4:32] he could and understand what other men
[4:33] had said but uh when those men were
[4:36] wrong the Holy Spirit would come and
[4:37] show him the truth of the revelation of
[4:39] it Hallelujah and he said that uh
[4:42] numerous
[4:43] times and even before he preached the
[4:46] first seal he said this he said I would
[4:49] have
[4:50] absolutely had a horrible mistake on
[4:52] that first seal if it hadn't been about
[4:54] 12:00 when the Holy Spirit came in the
[4:56] room and corrected me on something that
[4:58] I was writing down to say say okay and
[5:01] then he goes on to say the Holy Spirit
[5:03] just swept right down to the room and
[5:05] the whole thing just opened up he says
[5:07] and this first seal is opened I'm just
[5:10] I'm as positive and as I'm standing here
[5:12] tonight this is the gospel truth that
[5:15] I'm going to say here I just know it is
[5:18] so brother man read the books and was
[5:19] kind of confused on what to say but then
[5:21] the Holy Spirit would come in show him
[5:23] the vision and then he could stand there
[5:25] and say I'm not guessing if this is
[5:27] right this is thus sayeth the Lord so
[5:29] that's how we know of course and and
[5:31] everything he taught lines up with the
[5:33] rest of the Bible that's that's I just
[5:35] want to share that and then when brother
[5:37] Ram got to the end of preaching this
[5:38] whole week long on the Seven
[5:41] Seals he says of all the services I've
[5:44] ever had in my life I believe this week
[5:46] has been the most glorious time of all
[5:49] of my life in
[5:51] Services no matter what I have I've seen
[5:53] great Miracles performed of course
[5:55] before and healing services but this is
[5:58] beyond that it's been one of the great
[6:00] times highlights of my life is to be
[6:02] here now think about that brother Braham
[6:03] saw cripples get out of Cs brother
[6:06] Braham saw uh blind people received
[6:08] their sight brother R saw the dead
[6:09] raised but he said preaching these Seven
[6:12] Seals was the greatest services in all
[6:14] my life because the Holy Spirit visited
[6:16] him every day and showed him the
[6:18] revelation of the Seven Seals amen
[6:21] hallelujah in other words the healings
[6:22] were great but when when this Services
[6:25] came he knew exactly what the Holy
[6:27] Spirit wanted him to know about this
[6:29] Seven Seals in other words he wasn't
[6:30] guessing he wasn't hoping this was right
[6:33] it was thus sayith the Lord right amen
[6:35] so I just want you to show you what
[6:37] value brother randam pray placed on the
[6:39] seven seal sermons this was the greatest
[6:42] Services now there's other uh quotes
[6:45] from Brother Bram like a year after he
[6:46] preached these and he said if I ever
[6:48] preach anything that was inspired it was
[6:50] those Seven Seals because the Holy
[6:52] Spirit would visit him every day and
[6:54] show him the revelation of these seals
[6:57] so I don't have the book with me but you
[7:00] probably seen that black book where it's
[7:01] the revelation of the Seven Seals it's
[7:02] brother Ram sermons I read through that
[7:05] entire book and I listened to all the
[7:06] sermons over the course of my Ministry I
[7:09] would encourage you to do the same also
[7:12] read the seven Church ages the seven
[7:14] Church age book and listen to the seven
[7:16] Church age sermons from December of
[7:18] 1960 if you make those your your main
[7:21] listening and reading you will be
[7:23] established in this truth God's God's
[7:26] Bible Revelation because that's what
[7:27] I've seen in my life because I dedicated
[7:30] so much time to the church ages and the
[7:31] Seven Seals I feel like no man can
[7:34] deceive me I know that's quite a
[7:36] statement but that's what I believe by
[7:37] God's grace because I stayed with what
[7:39] the Holy Spirit showed brother brandham
[7:41] in the word of God so I would encourage
[7:43] you and I brother uh irin I preach over
[7:45] 125 sermons just on the Book of
[7:48] Revelation I went back and counted one
[7:50] time because they were all on YouTube
[7:52] and I could go back and count I was
[7:53] looking at my notes just on the Book of
[7:56] Revelation not not on any other books
[7:59] just the Book of Revelation because I
[8:01] want I wanted to be I want the people to
[8:03] be established right and the Bible says
[8:05] you're blessed just to read the book of
[8:07] Revelation amen then to hear it and then
[8:09] keep it you're beyond blessed Hallelujah
[8:12] and that's what I can see in my life my
[8:14] wife and I just passed 20 years of
[8:15] marriage so I I could say truly we're
[8:17] Beyond blessed amen by the grace of God
[8:19] hallelujah with spiritual blessings
[8:21] natural blessings but of course the most
[8:23] important are spiritual blessings
[8:25] knowing you're saved knowing you're
[8:27] filled with the Holy Ghost knowing
[8:28] you're going to heaven praise God
[8:29] knowing that you're walking the truth
[8:31] that God wants you to walk in it's the
[8:33] greatest thing you can have it's the
[8:34] peace of God that passes all
[8:36] understanding amen so I want to just
[8:38] read that just so you knew brother M
[8:39] consider these were the greatest sermons
[8:42] he ever preached was the Seven
[8:45] Seals okay now I like if if you would
[8:48] let's see here what else other notes I
[8:49] have on here
[8:55] um yeah start I thought i' start with
[8:57] those quotes just so you knew what
[8:58] brother Bram said about the Seven Seals
[9:00] uh now uh I think oh yeah I just want to
[9:04] briefly before we read from Revelation
[9:06] chap 6 in Revelation chap 5 you probably
[9:09] remember St John was given a vision of
[9:12] heaven and he's in heaven and he starts
[9:14] weeping because there's a book yeah in
[9:16] heaven and no man is worthy to go and
[9:19] take the book right the Bible said he
[9:21] was weeping and
[9:22] crying but then all of a sudden a voice
[9:25] calls out and says don't weep because
[9:27] the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[9:29] prevailed to open the book amen
[9:31] hallelujah and the Bible said then John
[9:34] looked to see the lion and it turned out
[9:35] to be a lamb Hallelujah like a lamb that
[9:38] he was slain like Jesus amen hallelujah
[9:41] and he had seven eyes and seven horns so
[9:43] what amazing things are going on in
[9:45] heaven praise God what amazing uh
[9:46] creatures God God makes himself and and
[9:49] other creatures Angels he has in heaven
[9:51] praise God Amen well then the lamb goes
[9:53] and takes the book right and then the
[9:56] Bible said John shouted so loud that all
[9:59] everyone in Heaven everyone in Earth
[10:01] everyone everything that was in the
[10:02] ocean heard John shout and rejoice
[10:05] because Jesus had taken God's book and
[10:07] was going to open it amen in other words
[10:10] the book and the book was sealed with
[10:12] Seven Seals now a seal represents
[10:14] privacy right anybody ever had a diary
[10:16] before and you had a little seal on the
[10:17] front like a leather strap or something
[10:20] or a lock like at our school they sell
[10:22] diaries that have locks on them and you
[10:23] got to have a key to get into that diary
[10:25] right that's kind of what the Seven
[10:27] Seals represented seven SEALS or seven
[10:30] uh kind of like locks on it or seals in
[10:32] those days they had seals where you have
[10:33] to break the seal to open the the scroll
[10:36] and that's what brother man tells us
[10:37] there were seven Scrolls or seven uh
[10:39] straps on it and now John is rejoicing
[10:43] because Jesus is now going to break
[10:45] these seals and tell us the Contex of
[10:48] what's in these Scrolls it's a Heavenly
[10:50] book praise God and then the Bible tells
[10:53] us it was a Plan of Redemption so the
[10:56] the Seven Seals show God's plan
[10:59] to redeem the church okay or rescue the
[11:03] church from Satan and actually it shows
[11:06] all all all the time from the beginning
[11:08] of the church ages so after Jesus went
[11:09] to heaven and sent the Holy Ghost it
[11:11] shows all the time from the church ages
[11:13] until the future home in other words the
[11:16] end of the Bible in other words the End
[11:18] of Time amen so it shows all the time
[11:20] from the the beginning of the church
[11:22] until there's a new uh New Jerusalem
[11:25] it's that pyramid City that comes down
[11:27] out of heaven and brother man preaching
[11:29] a sermon about that called the future
[11:31] home of the Heavenly bride and the
[11:33] Earthly bridegroom it's like a
[11:35] three-hour sermon it's a beautiful
[11:37] sermon if you haven't listened to that
[11:38] from 1964 raise your hands anybody
[11:40] listened to that one yet okay that's a
[11:42] good one you want to listen to In other
[11:43] words it's just it's like the the entire
[11:46] chapter of Revelation 21 if you ever
[11:48] wonder about that City that comes down
[11:49] from heaven that's the New Jerusalem
[11:51] praise God what did you call that the
[11:54] the Ser the sermon is called the future
[11:56] home of the Heavenly bride and an
[11:59] Earthly bridegroom it's from
[12:01] 1964 you can just look up the future
[12:03] home it'll come up from 1964 it's a
[12:06] beautiful message brother Ram uses uh
[12:08] numerous thoughts from Clarence Larin
[12:10] but then he also gets a revelation from
[12:11] the Holy Spirit uh that's about the
[12:14] three works of Grace and how the the
[12:16] Earth has to go through three processes
[12:19] to cleanse it water which was Noah's
[12:22] flood blood Jesus shed his blood and
[12:25] then fire the Bible said Peter said the
[12:28] Earth will melt with fervent heat fire
[12:30] so water Blood Fire right and that's
[12:33] justification sanctification baptism of
[12:35] the Holy Ghost it's three Works God
[12:37] always uses three works of Grace to
[12:38] redeem us amen so it's a beautiful it's
[12:40] a beautiful message I mean it's it's
[12:42] phenomenal it's from the Holy Spirit
[12:44] praise God but that's another topic for
[12:46] another time maybe maybe next week by
[12:48] God's grace we go over that we'll see or
[12:51] I'm sorry two weeks by God's grace
[12:54] um but anyways in re in Revelation chap
[12:57] 5 Jesus Takes the book and now in
[12:59] chapter 6 he's opening the
[13:01] book he's opening the book and then John
[13:04] is going to see what happens the book is
[13:06] open each seal is open and then John
[13:08] sees the symbols it's kind of like it's
[13:11] kind of like the books the Scrolls open
[13:13] and then John sees the symbols that are
[13:14] on the
[13:16] scroll okay and so that's what we're
[13:18] going to see by God's grace now before
[13:21] we read that as well now you got your
[13:22] sheet here uh on the front which has the
[13:25] seven Church
[13:27] ages if you have hav been taught this
[13:29] this is another lesson maybe I'll teach
[13:31] but it says seven Church ages Revelation
[13:34] chapters 2 and 3 so if you're familiar
[13:38] with that there's seven
[13:40] letters that Jesus or seven messages
[13:43] that Jesus sent to seven different
[13:45] churches and they were actually real
[13:47] churches around 90 or 100 AD and Jesus
[13:51] sent them special messages from John and
[13:55] John was supposed to send them the
[13:56] letters now what's amazing is that those
[13:58] leral churches had conditions that were
[14:01] prophetic of what was going to happen in
[14:03] history for the next 2,000 years it's
[14:07] amazing so whatever whatever problems
[14:09] and whatever situations those seven
[14:10] churches were going through that's that
[14:12] was prophetic of what was actually going
[14:14] to happen over the next 2,000 years it's
[14:17] amazing it's beautiful how God works out
[14:20] like that so the there's a letter to
[14:22] Ephesus but actually that letter was
[14:24] prophetic of what was going to happen
[14:26] from the years 53 to 70 AD and this this
[14:31] age lasted 117 years now hopefully I
[14:33] haven't lost anybody yet because this
[14:35] get gets kind of deep but and then Paul
[14:38] was the messenger to this age in other
[14:40] words um Paul was the angel because the
[14:43] word angel means a messenger Paul was
[14:45] the messenger Jesus sent to preach to
[14:48] them and whatever Paul preached that was
[14:50] going to be shared with everybody else
[14:52] okay now then Paul of course Paul died
[14:55] around uh I think it was if I'm not
[14:57] mistaken I think it was 60 7 ad if I'm
[14:59] not
[15:00] mistaken anyways he he was he came he
[15:03] preached and he went home to be with the
[15:04] Lord but this this age lasted from uh to
[15:08] 170 now then a second Church age started
[15:11] was the called The samerian Church age
[15:13] that lasted from about 170 to 312 and
[15:17] this lasted about you know 30 years
[15:18] longer about 1422 years and irius was
[15:21] the messenger to this age and I I in my
[15:24] book I have I have whole writings on
[15:26] this that back up what brother brandom
[15:28] wrote brother random wrote and preached
[15:30] about
[15:31] it so just so you know I have a whole
[15:34] chapter on the seven Church ages and the
[15:35] Seven Seals in there and it it basically
[15:38] just kind of summarizes what brother
[15:39] Brandon preached about it okay and then
[15:42] the Third Church age was pergamos from
[15:43] about 312 to 606 this was almost a 300E
[15:47] Church age uh St Martin was a messenger
[15:50] to this age and these all these men had
[15:52] tremendous Miracles tremendous
[15:55] Supernatural signs like you brother man
[15:57] talks about them you brother man talks
[15:59] about I mean I can't even begin to
[16:00] explain that's why I wrote about it
[16:01] because you can't even begin to scratch
[16:02] the surface of how these were Mighty Men
[16:04] of God now the next Church age was the
[16:07] longest it was the thoran church age
[16:09] this almost this lasted over 900 years
[16:12] from 606 to
[16:14] 1502 and Columba was the church age
[16:17] Messenger to
[16:19] thyra now the Sardis Church age was a
[16:22] time period from 1502 to 1750 this
[16:25] lasted 230 years Martin Luther was the
[16:28] church messenger he was the preacher of
[16:30] the Reformation right he preached that
[16:32] just shall live by faith he brought the
[16:34] church he brought Believers out of the
[16:37] Roman Catholic
[16:38] system now the Philadelphian Church age
[16:40] was uh the open door age where there was
[16:43] the greatest missionary work ever done
[16:44] in the history of the world that was
[16:46] from 1750 to 1906 it lasted 156 years
[16:50] and and John Wesley was the messenger he
[16:53] lived to be 88 years old and sometimes
[16:56] he would preach seven or eight sermons a
[16:57] day brother
[16:59] so who are we compared to these guys the
[17:01] these are giants of the faith we're not
[17:03] trying to worship man we never worship
[17:05] man but just let's give them some credit
[17:07] these were giants of the faith men of
[17:09] God that labored and he only had
[17:11] horseback to
[17:12] ride uh he would preach out in fields to
[17:15] thousands of people in fields uh just
[17:18] Mighty Men of
[17:19] God and of course now we are in the
[17:22] leoan church age it's that last age up
[17:24] at the top in the right hand corner it
[17:26] started around 1906 that's the Year
[17:28] brother Brandon was born and it it's not
[17:31] over yet it will go into the
[17:33] Rapture and this is already at 117 years
[17:37] so we're seeing already you know if we
[17:38] have one more year uh Leo deia will not
[17:42] be the the shortest Church age Ephesus
[17:44] will be the shortest Church age because
[17:45] that only lasted 117
[17:47] years and of course Brandon brother
[17:49] brandom was the messenger of this age
[17:51] because he point us back to the Bible he
[17:53] had Supernatural visitations he had
[17:55] signs wonders and miracles he spoke with
[17:57] thus say the Lord amen now if you notice
[18:02] now underneath that now I have the Seven
[18:04] Seals now notice the sizes of the seals
[18:07] the boxes are are different right the
[18:09] first seal second seal the third seal is
[18:11] the biggest and then the fourth seal is
[18:13] the smallest that's because brother R
[18:15] gave us clues about how long the seals
[18:18] lasted so let's start uh let's go now
[18:21] back to our Bible now and then we'll
[18:23] preach on the first seal
[18:25] briefly just want to give you a good
[18:27] understanding a good overview of it okay
[18:29] so Revelation 6 verse 1 and 2 now this
[18:31] is Jesus uh opening breaking the seal
[18:35] and then John sees what's what's in that
[18:37] scroll what's in that first seal
[18:41] scroll and I saw when the lamb opened
[18:44] one of the seals I heard as it were the
[18:45] noise of Thunder one of the four Beast
[18:47] saying come and see and I saw and behold
[18:50] a white horse and he that sat on him had
[18:52] a bow and a crown was given unto him and
[18:54] he went forth conquering and the
[18:56] conquer now
[18:59] this first seal is basically church
[19:01] history or the anointings the two the
[19:04] two anointings that battled from about
[19:07] 30 ad to 385 ad so the first seal is the
[19:13] anointing of the Beast which in this
[19:15] case is a lion the first Beast was The
[19:18] Lion Okay so this first group this first
[19:22] time period from 30 to 385 ad it was the
[19:25] White Horse which was the Antichrist
[19:27] spirit
[19:29] the White Horse went writing Satan went
[19:31] writing to try to combat the
[19:34] Believers okay but he was battling the
[19:37] Christians who had the anointing of a
[19:39] lion okay and brother B said the lion
[19:41] was the powerful bold anointing upon the
[19:44] early church because the Bible says in
[19:47] Proverbs the righteous are as bold as a
[19:49] lion amen hallelujah and the Bible said
[19:53] a lion's like an un a prophet right in
[19:55] Amos 3: 7 and 8
[19:58] okay now let's go through some of these
[20:00] symbols so the Beast of the first seal
[20:03] was the lion and we get the order in
[20:06] Revelation chap 4 if I'm not
[20:10] mistaken yeah I'm going to go back there
[20:12] briefly uh if if you ever B go to
[20:14] Revelation 4:7 this tells you the order
[20:17] of the Beast and there's a special order
[20:19] for the Beast brother Ram says these
[20:21] beasts are thus sayi the Lord in other
[20:22] words these beasts are anointings that
[20:24] are on the church Hallelujah
[20:28] so Revelation 4:7 and the first Beast
[20:31] was like a lion and the second beast
[20:34] like a calf or like a ox and the third
[20:38] Beast had a face as a man and the fourth
[20:41] Beast was like a flying eagle okay so
[20:44] now you can turn back to Revelation
[20:45] chapter 6 so now you know the four
[20:47] beasts brother Adam said these beasts
[20:49] are the anointings of the Holy
[20:52] Spirit okay so when when the when the
[20:55] Believers were living during this time
[20:57] period in the first first seal which was
[20:59] kind of like the Ephesus and samna and
[21:01] part the beginning of the pergamos
[21:02] church Age The Believers had the
[21:04] anointing of the Holy Ghost like a lion
[21:06] they were bold they had power like we
[21:10] know like brother mam said he's heard
[21:11] brother Maham heard a lion roar in the
[21:13] forest and then all the other animals
[21:14] shut
[21:15] up because they're all scared because
[21:17] he's the king of the jungle right
[21:19] Hallelujah and so the anointing of the
[21:21] Holy Ghost was so powerful on the
[21:23] apostles they just spoke the word of God
[21:25] and everything else shut up right there
[21:27] was such power where Peter said if if
[21:29] the Bible said they lied to Peter and
[21:31] the Bible said that ananas and safire
[21:33] that lied to Peter they died it was such
[21:35] a powerful ministry right they right
[21:37] they died and they had to carry their
[21:38] bodies out the Bible said Peter could
[21:41] walk through and his shadow think about
[21:43] that his shadow would heal people just
[21:46] his shadow it was the anointing of the
[21:48] Holy Spirit praise God W and church you
[21:51] know just so you know even uh Perry
[21:53] green he gave the testimony where he he
[21:56] spent time with brother brandom and then
[21:57] after brother died perig green would go
[21:59] and then he would walk by people and and
[22:02] he's testified that his shadow people
[22:04] got in his shadow and they were healed
[22:06] as well because the people had such
[22:08] Faith they had faith in brother bram's
[22:10] gift and now they had faith in uh Perry
[22:12] Green's gift so we see church that that
[22:15] what God does is he raises people's
[22:17] Faith praise God and when the word of
[22:19] God is preached and people know it's
[22:21] true and the Holy Spirit shows his
[22:22] trueth it raises the faith of the people
[22:25] and the people then can believe for
[22:26] miracles amen they can believe for
[22:28] Supernatural they can re they can
[22:30] believe for anything whatever God's
[22:31] leading them to believe they can receive
[22:33] it praise God like last Sunday we had
[22:36] such anointed service right and a
[22:38] brother I didn't even know but I said
[22:39] brother are you having a migraine I just
[22:41] was wondering he'd have migraines
[22:43] sometimes I didn't know if he was having
[22:43] one I said brother are you having a
[22:44] migraine and he said yes I'm having a
[22:46] migraine right now I said well at the
[22:48] end of the service you come up for
[22:50] prayer because he's battled migraines
[22:52] off and on and I could just feel people
[22:54] were rejoicing and there was such a you
[22:56] could I could just feel Faith in the
[22:57] room praise God hallelujah and so we
[23:00] come up for prayer we prayed and we
[23:01] rebuked the Satan and he said during
[23:03] that prayer the migraine just vanished
[23:05] away amen praise God and so after church
[23:08] I let the church know that we just
[23:10] rejoiced amen that God that God we when
[23:13] when when people believe when people are
[23:15] in tune with God then God will come back
[23:17] and back up the word of God hallelujah
[23:19] amen oh I just I was so blessed to see
[23:22] that praise God God delivered him right
[23:24] in the midst of his
[23:25] trial now back to the
[23:28] uh chapter 6 verse2 and I saw Behold a
[23:30] white horse now brother said that white
[23:32] means innocent deception of the false
[23:35] teachers so other words Satan was going
[23:37] around real innocently like oh we're
[23:40] Christians but then we know we know the
[23:42] changes he made John and brother iring
[23:44] he brought in infant baptism that was
[23:46] one of his lies he brought in prayers uh
[23:50] prayers to the Saints he brought that in
[23:52] in the first in the first few Church
[23:53] ages right the Roman Catholic church so
[23:55] this white horse rider is Satan in the
[23:57] ran Roman Catholic
[23:59] Church spreading
[24:01] lies they changed the baptism the father
[24:04] son Holy Ghost baptism in that first age
[24:07] they got they already Satan had already
[24:08] tricked them into taking away the true
[24:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ baptism
[24:13] now not the real Believers a real
[24:14] believer can't be deceived praise God
[24:17] hallelujah but Satan was he was already
[24:19] starting to pervert with his false
[24:21] teaching it was an antichrist spirit
[24:23] that white horse rider brother man tells
[24:25] us is the same spirit it's the
[24:26] Antichrist spirit
[24:29] okay so the White Horse Ride Now look
[24:31] brother Adam says notice he said he had
[24:32] a bow but brother Adam said look no
[24:35] arrows so brother said that means he's a
[24:38] bluffer Satan's like a roaring lion but
[24:40] he really can't devour
[24:42] you brother say he's like a roaring lion
[24:44] who has no teeth that's what brother
[24:46] said in the sermon so listen to the
[24:47] first
[24:48] seal said he's a bluffer and isn't that
[24:50] true s San will Bluff us all the time
[24:53] just to make us fearful fearful and
[24:54] we'll worry about something and later
[24:56] find out we had nothing to worry about
[24:58] amen he's just bluffing in other words
[25:00] Satan has no power unless God gives it
[25:02] to him and even if God gives it to him
[25:04] God has the most power praise God Amen
[25:08] Hallelujah now other scriptures you can
[25:10] show too how the Bible said Satan shoots
[25:12] his bows like lies I have entire videos
[25:15] I have entire I have a whole chapter on
[25:17] this so I can't get to all the
[25:18] scriptures and I didn't have time to
[25:19] write them all down but it's say if
[25:21] Satan went out he shot all his lies but
[25:22] then he's got nothing left he's a liar
[25:24] he's a bluffer in other words don't
[25:27] believe Satan believe Jesus he's the way
[25:29] the truth and the life amen Satan comes
[25:32] to steal kill and destroy but Jesus came
[25:34] that you might have life and have it
[25:35] more abundantly praise God all
[25:40] right now and then the Bible said a
[25:43] crown was given un him brother R says
[25:45] this was the uh this was the early
[25:48] leader the of the Church of Rome at some
[25:50] point because he was a false teacher
[25:53] they gave him a crown and brother bam
[25:55] also says at some point the Catholic
[25:56] Church organized and they gave the pope
[25:58] a crown which he does wear a crown sure
[26:01] there's times he wears a crown when he
[26:03] travels he doesn't he's got that white
[26:04] cap on right but he does at times can he
[26:07] does wear a crown at
[26:10] times a crown was given unto him and he
[26:14] went forth conquering and to conquer so
[26:16] see brother Bram says it's Satan trying
[26:19] to conquer the True Believers but it's a
[26:21] battle praise God it depends which which
[26:23] side are you on are you on the side of
[26:25] the White Horse or are you the side of
[26:26] the lion we're on the side of the
[26:28] Believers praise God Amen Hallelujah
[26:30] there's no white horse that can defeat
[26:32] God's anointing praise God but Satan did
[26:35] accomplish he went he conquered a lot of
[26:37] people he deceived a lot of people but
[26:39] the True Believers could never be
[26:40] deceived oh thank God that Jesus said
[26:42] that amen Allelujah Jesus said you
[26:45] cannot deceive he said false prophets
[26:46] arise and he said they'll deceive the
[26:49] very elect if it were possible but then
[26:51] brother tells us as the Bible says it's
[26:53] not possible to deceive God's elect
[26:55] Hallelujah church we have nothing to Fe
[26:58] we have nothing to worry about God won't
[26:59] let you be tricked amen God won't let
[27:02] Satan trick you because you're a real
[27:04] believer praise God hallelujah
[27:07] amen okay so there's your first seal
[27:09] last in now the reason it ends about 385
[27:12] is that's when the that's the first time
[27:15] and that's in the book 385 was the first
[27:17] time there were Martyrs killed by the
[27:19] Roman Catholic Church just so you know
[27:22] and that represented a change in the
[27:24] seals because it's a change of the horse
[27:27] rider now brother said brother said that
[27:29] Rider rode the White Horse but then he
[27:30] jumped off his White Horse and then he
[27:32] hopped on a bloody red
[27:35] one okay so now let's read the second
[27:37] seal so the Antichrist Spirit was
[27:39] writing he's a white innocent teacher
[27:41] but then about 385 he jumped off and he
[27:43] jumps on a red bloody horse brother Bram
[27:46] says and that was the year of the first
[27:49] martyring done the first killing of
[27:53] Christians done by the Roman Catholic
[27:54] Church 385 and that's in the book I got
[27:56] all the history I Ed the same history
[27:58] books brother Bram
[27:59] did okay so all right so the second seal
[28:02] uh verse three and when he opened the
[28:04] second seal I heard the second beast say
[28:06] come and see now the second beast of
[28:08] course was the calf or oxen right baby
[28:12] Ox young Ox verse four and there went
[28:16] out another horse that was red now
[28:18] brother says red as i r there was the
[28:20] blood bloody red blood shed by the
[28:22] United Roman church and state so it's
[28:26] right around this time that the the the
[28:28] Roman Empire United with the Roman
[28:30] Catholic Church do you know the Emperor
[28:32] who United them what was his name do you
[28:34] remember Constantine guys hallelujah
[28:37] amen now most denominations love the guy
[28:40] but we know he was an evil man did you
[28:42] know he murdered his mother and his son
[28:46] at the end of his life and they they
[28:48] they all say oh he was a Godly Christian
[28:50] no Christians don't murder wow he was a
[28:53] he had a false conversion is what the
[28:55] Bible says he was a worker of
[28:58] iniquity but Constantine marri the
[29:00] church and state together there's all
[29:02] the history I got it right in there
[29:03] brother Ram gives us all the history too
[29:04] I me read the church age book listen to
[29:06] The Seven Seals brother R puts it all in
[29:08] there you can hear all of it Hallelujah
[29:11] my uh and power was given unto him that
[29:14] sat there on to take peace from the
[29:15] earth so see it's the Roman Catholic
[29:17] Church that took peace off the Earth
[29:20] because now they had power to
[29:22] kill brother R tells us that came
[29:25] through the writing of St Augustine of
[29:26] Hippo
[29:28] now most church people today oh say
[29:30] Augustine was a godly man but we know he
[29:32] actually led the Catholic Church to
[29:34] start killing people if they wouldn't
[29:36] come into the Catholic faith so see
[29:38] brother randam was given the right
[29:40] history by the Holy Spirit In other
[29:41] words the Holy Spirit directed brother
[29:43] Ram to the right history books amen
[29:45] hallelujah thank
[29:49] God and that they should kill one
[29:51] another and there was given on him a
[29:53] great
[29:54] sword okay so the red means now the
[29:57] Roman Catholic Church is Anointed to
[29:59] kill anyone who disagrees with them but
[30:02] what are the Believers Anointed with
[30:05] most of them are anointed with this ax
[30:07] anointing which brother R says it's the
[30:09] anointing to be a sacrifice to give
[30:11] yourself as a martyr because isn't that
[30:13] what animals do don't they give them
[30:14] don't they just labor all the time
[30:16] that's just that's all they don't
[30:17] complain they just go work you know and
[30:19] then they you know they die right we
[30:21] kill them we eat their meat you know we
[30:23] eat their eggs or whatever you know
[30:25] right the chicken eggs I mean there're
[30:26] just beast of
[30:28] burden and so the anointing of the Holy
[30:30] Spirit during this time is from 385 to
[30:33] 1095 I put on the sheet there because
[30:36] 1095 is agreed it's about the time when
[30:38] the Dark Age just
[30:40] started okay and that's the next seal
[30:42] the third seals the Dark
[30:44] Ages all right so can everybody see that
[30:47] Satan first was deceiving on a white
[30:49] horse but then he got power of church
[30:51] and state and now Satan this Antichrist
[30:53] Spirit jumps on a red horse and now he
[30:55] can kill anybody who disagrees with them
[30:57] because he's got power now to do it he's
[30:59] not just a he's not just a a false
[31:01] church now he's church and state
[31:03] together all right sure and he wrode
[31:06] notice if you look up there to the top
[31:08] he wrode during the pergan church age
[31:10] and part of the thyo church age if you
[31:12] kind of look and see how overlaps
[31:14] there's an overlap
[31:16] there all right now the third seal this
[31:19] is an awesome seal so hope hope you like
[31:21] this one by God's grace I mean they're
[31:22] all awesome but this one especially is
[31:25] wonderful first verse 5 Revelation 6:5
[31:30] and when he opened the third seal I
[31:31] heard the third Beast say come and see
[31:33] now that's the anointing of a man it's a
[31:36] face of a man so we went lion then we
[31:39] went ox or calf and then went
[31:42] man and I beheld in low a black horse
[31:44] and he that sat on him had a pair of
[31:46] balances in his hand now brother BR says
[31:48] the black represent the Dark Ages so now
[31:51] this is the Roman Catholic Church during
[31:52] the Dark Ages Church did you know during
[31:55] the Dark Ages the Roman Catholic Church
[31:58] destroyed every language of the Bible
[32:00] except
[32:02] Latin before before that time there was
[32:05] 500 languages you could read the Bible
[32:07] in but during the Dark Ages the
[32:10] Catholics destroyed all the Bible so
[32:11] they're the only ones who had the truth
[32:13] except there was a small group uh
[32:15] Columba Columba and his group had their
[32:17] own Bible versions amen and because of
[32:20] them because of Columba and all his
[32:21] followers we have a Bible today praise
[32:24] God wow God used Columba and he had he
[32:27] he had an island of Scholars he had an
[32:29] island of Holy Ghost filled Believers
[32:31] far away from Rome right in the Roman
[32:33] Empire and that's where God kept his
[32:37] people that's where he kept his word
[32:38] saved God always has a special place
[32:41] where he preserves the Believers
[32:43] amen Satan thought he could destroy all
[32:45] the Bibles but God said no I'm going to
[32:47] hide it out there with Columba and all
[32:49] the saints
[32:50] amen hallelujah praise God but Satan
[32:54] used the Catholic Church to get rid of
[32:56] all the the Bible translations and all
[32:58] the languages except Latin and then
[33:00] people are sitting there hearing the the
[33:02] the their their sermons in Latin and
[33:04] many of them don't even understand it
[33:06] they're German or whatever they are you
[33:08] know uh they speak Greek or whatever AR
[33:12] Aramaic but again and that's what we
[33:14] have today we have people that go to
[33:15] Catholic churches and they want to hear
[33:17] the mass in Latin and they don't even
[33:18] know what they're they don't even can't
[33:20] even understand it no wonder the Bible
[33:22] calls it mystery Babylon right the
[33:25] Abominations of the the Harlot the
[33:27] mother Harlot she's the mother of
[33:30] confusion but see we come to we come to
[33:32] church you come here tonight and you
[33:33] want to know what the Bible says praise
[33:35] God you want to know what the preacher
[33:37] is saying because you know there's life
[33:38] in the word of God and if he's preaching
[33:40] truth you'll receive truth and you'll
[33:42] have God's eternal life hallelujah amen
[33:46] H I feel good I preached last night too
[33:47] so I'm feeling good tonight hallelujah
[33:50] thank God
[33:52] Amen
[33:54] now so now brother Ram said the the man
[33:57] Beast represents the anointing on the
[33:59] reformers and these Scholars like
[34:01] Columba and then it you see it carries
[34:03] over to Martin Luther and John
[34:05] Wesley they had the wisdom of a man to
[34:08] know these lies from the Catholic Church
[34:11] brother gives the example he said
[34:13] brother God gave Martin Luther the
[34:15] anointing of a man to know that bread
[34:17] and
[34:18] wine are not the literal body and blood
[34:21] of Jesus right he had the he had the
[34:24] anointing of the Holy Spirit Martin
[34:26] Luther to know it's just the bread it's
[34:28] just wine right in other words he knew
[34:31] thank you buddy I appreciate it you're
[34:32] really kind you did that last time thank
[34:34] you bu he had the wisdom to know there's
[34:38] no such thing as
[34:40] transubstantiation right he had he had
[34:42] the wisdom to know you can't pray to an
[34:44] idol if you pray to an idol nothing's
[34:46] going to happen I mean it's just an idol
[34:48] yet Catholics will they pay homage to
[34:50] statues to this day oh yeah we just met
[34:52] a man who does that we met a man but now
[34:54] he's coming to church he's starting to
[34:55] see the light so oh his name is K so if
[34:57] you think of it pray for him wow he had
[34:59] a really good time at church on Sunday
[35:00] so hopefully he keeps coming back and
[35:02] God brings him out of Catholicism I
[35:04] preached against I right there I said
[35:06] Jesus said call no man
[35:08] father because they call their their
[35:10] priest Holy Father or father so and so I
[35:13] preach it right there I said Jesus
[35:15] Christ said call no man father so he
[35:17] stayed so that's good hopefully hope
[35:20] hopefully he'll open his heart to more
[35:21] the word of God all right now so now you
[35:24] know what the third seal is it was a
[35:27] time period from about 1095 to about
[35:29] 1906 when the last anointing would come
[35:32] that's the eagle anointing but we're not
[35:34] done with the third seal here's the best
[35:36] best part now look at Revelation 6
[35:38] verse5 at the end of the verse it says
[35:40] he had a pair of balances in his
[35:42] hand so Satan in the form of the
[35:45] Antichrist spirit is riding during the
[35:46] Dark Ages and he's got bounces in his
[35:48] hand what does he say verse six and I
[35:51] Heard a Voice in the midst of the four
[35:53] beasts say a measure I'm sorry a measure
[35:56] of we wheat for a penny and three
[35:58] measures of barley for a penny and I'm
[35:59] going to stop right there now notice
[36:02] this voice actually was the voice of
[36:04] Christ brother Ram says notice it's the
[36:06] voice it's in the midst of the four
[36:09] beasts so where was Jesus Jesus was
[36:11] standing there with the the scroll he's
[36:13] opening the seals and then the anoint
[36:15] the beasts are around him right there
[36:16] the Bible said they worship God they cry
[36:18] holy holy holy Lord God
[36:21] Almighty but a a voice comes out of the
[36:23] Beast and says that these balance
[36:28] represent a measure of wheat for a penny
[36:31] and three measures of barley for a penny
[36:33] brother Ram said Jesus was saying that
[36:36] the Roman Catholic Church would control
[36:38] economics and food during the Dark Ages
[36:41] which they did Brother BR said the third
[36:44] seal was Satan capturing the wealth of
[36:46] the world isn't that what the Catholics
[36:49] did didn't they have Crusades to build
[36:51] up their money right that's why they had
[36:53] Crusades to go ravish places and take
[36:55] all their treasur so they could build
[36:56] their their big buildings that they
[36:59] got and that and so he Satan was writing
[37:01] with balances I'm going to capture the
[37:03] wealth of the world I'm going to control
[37:05] economics and
[37:06] finances it's exactly right Hallelujah
[37:10] and brother did you know that they used
[37:12] to do indulgences in the Dark
[37:14] Ages so an Indulgence is where you have
[37:18] to confess your sin to the priest but
[37:20] but you could pay money to be forgiven
[37:22] of that sin so like let's let's say a
[37:25] man uh let's say a man killed somebody
[37:28] he could go to the priest and confess it
[37:30] and let's say PID $3 and he'd be
[37:33] forgiven well why did the Catholic
[37:35] Church do that to make money indulgences
[37:38] it was it was so much money you could uh
[37:42] you could slap a priest for so much
[37:43] money you could you could uh have
[37:45] adulteries you could rape somebody you
[37:47] could do all these things for all these
[37:49] amounts of money and that's how the
[37:51] Catholic church was capturing the wealth
[37:52] of the world I want you to notice this
[37:55] last statement in the in the third
[37:57] seal look at verse 6 Revelation 6:6 the
[38:01] last sentence says and see thou hurt not
[38:03] the oil and the wine Hallelujah so Jesus
[38:08] calls out in the midst of this Dark Ages
[38:11] Jesus calls out he calls out to the
[38:13] Roman Catholic Church don't hurt the oil
[38:16] and the wine brother says what's the oil
[38:18] the oil is the Holy Ghost amen
[38:21] hallelujah and what's the wine brother
[38:23] ra said it's the Joy or the stimulation
[38:26] that comes on you when God reveals
[38:28] something to you amen hallelujah so in
[38:32] the midst of Dark Ages in the midst of
[38:35] any time when when Satan's getting uh
[38:37] when he's conquering people and he's
[38:39] steal he's taking money in the midst of
[38:41] any dark situation especially the Dark
[38:43] Ages Jesus says I'm protecting the oil
[38:46] and wine you can't touch the Holy Ghost
[38:49] In other words anyone that wants to be
[38:50] born again can be born again anybody
[38:53] that wants to experience the joy of the
[38:54] Lord can have the joy of the Lord
[38:57] cuz Jesus said he can't touch it praise
[38:59] God and church that ought to give you
[39:01] confidence that Satan can never destroy
[39:03] your life Satan can never take your life
[39:05] he can as far as he can never deceive
[39:07] you he can never take you off away from
[39:09] the holy spirit because Jesus said he
[39:11] cannot touch it praise God Amen
[39:14] Hallelujah praise God how many remember
[39:17] do you remember Ephesians 4:30 the Bible
[39:20] says grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby
[39:23] you're sealed until the day of your
[39:25] Redemption
[39:27] in other words God's presence in your
[39:29] life it's going to be a seal it's going
[39:31] to be like a stamp it's going to be like
[39:33] a brand y all brand animals out here no
[39:36] used to Nebraska used to in Nebraska so
[39:38] that that's what the Bible says that
[39:40] seal means a brand I'm glad they don't
[39:42] do in Ohio right glad that's a good
[39:43] thing right they don't do branding is
[39:45] that a good thing I hope so just having
[39:48] pity on the animals but that's that's
[39:50] what the Bible says God seals you with
[39:52] his holy spirit God gives you a brand
[39:55] amen that means God says you're mine
[39:57] brother Irvin and he and he Brands he
[39:59] puts his holy spirit inside of you and
[40:01] nothing can take away that brand of the
[40:03] Holy Spirit that's the same thing Jesus
[40:05] saying Satan cannot touch the oil the
[40:08] Holy Spirit the brand Holy Spirit the
[40:10] Satan cannot touch the Sea of the holy
[40:13] spirit because it's God marking you
[40:15] you're his for all time for all eternity
[40:18] praise God a't that awesome you'll never
[40:20] belong to Satan you always belong to
[40:23] Jesus
[40:24] Christ hallelujah praise God
[40:28] amen so I want you to know that Jesus
[40:31] says no matter how dark it gets no
[40:33] matter how much money of the Catholic
[40:34] Church gets and all the wickedness they
[40:36] do Satan cannot touch the oil and the
[40:39] wine you can still have joy Sister Sarah
[40:42] you can still have the joy the
[40:44] stimulation of the Revelation you can
[40:46] still have the wine of the Holy Spirit
[40:48] you can still have the oil of the Holy
[40:49] Spirit Satan cannot touch it God's power
[40:52] is protected on your
[40:55] life hey
[40:58] amen now the four seal for
[41:04] seal verse 7 Revelation 6 ver7 and when
[41:08] he opened the force seal I heard the
[41:09] voice of the force Beast this is the
[41:11] flying eagle say come in
[41:13] see verse eight and I looked and behold
[41:16] a Pale Horse now brother says pale if
[41:18] you look on your sheet is like that's a
[41:20] disease that's the color of leprosy in
[41:21] the Old Testament is
[41:23] pale right and we all know leprosy is
[41:25] like a death disease right it's a it's a
[41:28] a flesh eating
[41:30] disease so here the riter is now pale
[41:34] he's a par horse rider brother says this
[41:36] is spiritual death so like if you had
[41:39] leprosy without medicine what is it it's
[41:40] automatic death right it's just going to
[41:42] eat you up slowly eat you up and so the
[41:45] last Rider and this is church the last
[41:48] horse there's no horses in the fifth
[41:49] Seal The Sixth Seal the seventh seal
[41:52] this is the last horse rider the last
[41:55] horse rider is is spiritual death in
[41:57] other words brother man said it's
[41:59] spiritual
[42:01] death because he's got a name yeah we
[42:03] got a name right here let's look at
[42:05] let's look at verse eight and I looked
[42:06] and behold a Pale Horse and his name
[42:09] that that sat on him was death and Hell
[42:12] Followed him now stop right there this
[42:14] is the same writer that's been riding
[42:16] for three four horses in a row but we
[42:18] don't know his name until the fourth
[42:21] horse we don't know his name until the
[42:24] Beast says this is
[42:26] this is death and what does that
[42:28] represent that represent the eagle
[42:30] represents a prophet
[42:32] Ministry it takes a prophet Ministry it
[42:35] takes the anointing of a prophet that
[42:36] was on brother brandom to call out and
[42:38] recognize who this writer is now we know
[42:41] who he is he's death he's spiritual
[42:44] death and it takes the anointing of the
[42:45] flying eagle in other words it takes the
[42:47] ministry God gave to brother RAM for us
[42:49] to recognize these Seven Seals and also
[42:52] call out and recognize spiritual death
[42:55] church not many churches can look at the
[42:57] Roman Catholic church today and say
[42:58] there's death there right most churches
[43:00] will say oh we love the pope he's a nice
[43:02] man he's a good man he's so kind he he
[43:05] he kisses the babies and everything but
[43:07] brother Brandon would look and see look
[43:08] what he's teaching look at what the
[43:10] Pope's teaching it's death Hallelujah
[43:14] transubstantiation right worshiping
[43:15] praying to Mary praying to dead Saints
[43:17] brother R look at that say that's not
[43:19] life that's
[43:21] death Hallelujah and thank God you've
[43:23] got eyes that can see the truth and You'
[43:25] got ear that can hear the word of
[43:27] God hallelujah thank God Amen now notice
[43:32] when how when does he ride he rides from
[43:34] 1906 until
[43:37] Armageddon because brother R says verse
[43:42] eight verse eight tells how he makes his
[43:45] final ride and he makes his final ride
[43:47] at the Battle of armagan which is in
[43:49] Revelation chapter 19 but we're not
[43:52] going to read that tonight for time
[43:54] sake I'm already I'm already at 40 45
[43:57] minutes that's hard to believe let's
[43:59] read verse 8 again Revelation 6:8 and I
[44:01] looked and behold a pale horse that's
[44:03] the same rider that's the Antichrist
[44:06] spirit and his name that sat on him was
[44:08] death and Hell Followed him and brother
[44:11] man says hell always follows death right
[44:12] when someone dies and they're a sinner
[44:14] where do they go hell so hell always
[44:16] follows death for the
[44:19] unbeliever right and power was given
[44:22] unto them over the fourth part of the
[44:23] earth to kill with the sword with hunger
[44:26] and with death and with the Beast of the
[44:27] earth now of course this is brother man
[44:29] says this is his last ride so this this
[44:32] spiritual pale death is riding today
[44:35] he's riding today but his last ride
[44:37] he'll get he'll get control to kill a
[44:39] fourth part of the earth he'll kill with
[44:41] Hunger death and the Beast of the earth
[44:45] okay and that's seen at the battle of
[44:47] Armageddon well let's just read that one
[44:48] verse let's go to Revelation 19 let's
[44:50] read that here thank you m I appreciate
[44:53] that little water
[44:54] buddy thank you
[45:00] sir and the Bible says brother Micaiah
[45:04] that anyone who gives a glass of water
[45:05] in the name of a a disciple or in the
[45:08] name of Jesus has a reward so you got a
[45:10] reward buddy Hallelujah Jesus said
[45:14] you'll receive a reward you give a you
[45:16] give a name of a glass you give a glass
[45:17] of water in the name of a disciple name
[45:19] of a servant of God God will give you a
[45:21] reward Hallelujah Revelation
[45:24] 19
[45:29] now go to verse 11 Revelation 1911 and I
[45:33] saw heaven open and behold a white horse
[45:34] and he that sat upon him was called
[45:36] faithful and true and in righteousness
[45:38] he doth judge and make
[45:40] war his eyes were as a flame of fire
[45:42] this is Jesus and on his head were many
[45:44] crowns and he had a name written that no
[45:46] man knew but he himself and he was
[45:48] clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood
[45:49] and his name is called the word of God
[45:52] verse 14 and the armies which were in
[45:54] heaven foued him upon white horses
[45:56] clothed in fine linen white and clean
[45:58] now who is that that's you because when
[46:01] you get when you when you get saved when
[46:02] you get filled with the Holy Ghost the
[46:04] Bible said you have white Robes of
[46:06] righteousness so when Jesus comes back
[46:09] at arm again he's in the front and we're
[46:11] all behind him we're backing him up but
[46:14] church he really don't need no backing
[46:15] up Jesus can take care of himself right
[46:19] but he's just showing the devil look
[46:20] here's all my Army all these ones you
[46:22] kill down Through the Ages here's Paul
[46:24] and Peter and James and John there's
[46:26] brother Brandon there's all these Saints
[46:28] there's Martin Luther these were these
[46:29] were this was my real army these are the
[46:31] real Believers praise God and they're
[46:34] roed in white and they sit on white
[46:35] horses amen and white is the
[46:38] righteousness of saints which is the
[46:39] righteousness of Jesus Christ and
[46:42] because you believe Sister Sarah and
[46:44] sister Ruth because you believe in Jesus
[46:46] Christ he's given you his
[46:49] righteousness that's the tradeoff Jesus
[46:51] paid for your sins and brother irin you
[46:53] get his righteousness Hallelujah you got
[46:56] a white robe praise God and there's a
[46:58] picture of you coming out of heaven with
[47:00] Jesus did you know you're in that verse
[47:03] well now you do now I can Rejoice say
[47:05] one day iide ride a white horse I've
[47:07] never rode a horse but that day I
[47:10] will Hallelujah
[47:13] now I'm not I got to skip over this but
[47:15] he sends a sword out of his mouth and it
[47:17] destroys all these armies now these
[47:19] armies are they're Russia China and
[47:22] that's in Ezekiel and all the armies
[47:24] that are left on the Earth Russia and
[47:27] and Russia and uh China are the main
[47:29] ones because the Bible said the armies
[47:30] from the Far East and then the uh the
[47:33] north the King of the North Russia come
[47:35] down against Israel just so you know
[47:37] that's that's in Ezekiel I preached on
[47:39] that a couple months ago so it's I'm a
[47:41] little I'm not real familiar with the
[47:44] actual chapter but it's in Ezekiel now
[47:46] what I wanted to show you is verse 17
[47:50] and I saw an angel stand in the Sun and
[47:51] he cried with a loud voice saying to all
[47:53] the fowls that fly in the midst of
[47:55] Heaven Come and gather yourselves
[47:56] together unto the great supper of that
[47:58] great God that you may eat the Flesh of
[48:01] Kings and the Flesh of captains and the
[48:03] Flesh of Mighty Men and the Flesh of
[48:05] horses and the of them that sat on them
[48:07] and the Flesh of all men both free and
[48:09] bond both small and great okay so here
[48:13] is The Last Ride of the fourth horse
[48:16] riders so now go back to Revelation
[48:20] 6 remember so that that's we just read
[48:24] what Revelation 6:8 said and with the
[48:26] Beast of the
[48:28] earth okay that's the Beast of the earth
[48:30] that eat up all the unbelievers this
[48:33] these Wicked armies that come against
[48:35] Jesus and the bride and they also come
[48:37] against
[48:41] Israel all right
[48:43] now now before we flip it over I'm about
[48:45] ready to flip it over here but at the
[48:48] bottom did you notice I have three more
[48:49] columns under
[48:51] here because there's there's other ways
[48:55] there there's other ways to understand
[48:57] these four horse riders these four horse
[49:00] riders Are The Same Spirit it's the same
[49:02] person it's the spirit of death brother
[49:04] man calls it the Antichrist Spirit or
[49:06] you can call it Satan whatever you want
[49:07] to call it it's Satan it's it's the
[49:09] Antichrist Spirit notice he works in
[49:12] four stages but did you notice go to
[49:14] that look at that first one lust entice
[49:16] James 1:4 and 15 did you know the Bible
[49:19] said there's four stages to death just
[49:22] like there's four horse
[49:23] riders it's a four-step process for
[49:26] people to to go to hell first the first
[49:29] step is lust lust entic Your Lust gets
[49:31] enticed and you start thinking about
[49:33] that the second step is lust conceived
[49:36] now you're going to make a plan you got
[49:37] the plan to go do it the third step is
[49:39] you actually partake in the Sin and the
[49:42] last step the Bible says is
[49:44] death notice the fourth horse rider was
[49:47] death and the fourth step is death you
[49:49] see that it's a parallel in other words
[49:53] brother Irvin and all brother John we
[49:55] back battle these four horse riders in
[49:56] other words on a daily basis as we
[49:59] battle Satan we're battling this
[50:01] four-step process to death but we're
[50:03] going to overcome
[50:05] God's amen we will overcome praise God
[50:08] it's impossible for God's Church to lose
[50:11] hallelujah amen she's already
[50:13] predestinated to win hallelujah
[50:15] amen so in other words this four-step
[50:18] process during the church ages is the
[50:20] same process that we got to battle on a
[50:22] daily basis each one of us in our lives
[50:23] have to battle this four-step process
[50:26] you don't have to raise your hands but
[50:27] everybody in here was probably enticed
[50:28] by some lust today whether it was food
[50:31] whether it was sexual lust whether it
[50:33] was greed you lusted after the money or
[50:35] something
[50:36] right we all battle lust right lust of
[50:39] the eyes lust of the flesh pride of
[50:42] life and it's a four-step process just
[50:45] like four horse
[50:48] riders so Satan uses four steps to
[50:50] destroy people in death spiritual death
[50:53] now look at the next one God God
[50:55] foretold this four these four horses in
[50:57] Joel chapter
[50:59] 1 God said he he saw Israel getting
[51:02] eaten up by four bugs but it's the same
[51:05] bug in four
[51:08] stages it's the caterpillar right but uh
[51:11] Joel one says it's starts as the Palmer
[51:13] worm then the Locust the canker worm and
[51:17] then the
[51:19] caterpillar
[51:21] Hallelujah so what what bug was eating
[51:24] up Israel in Joel chap one it was the
[51:26] Antichrist Spirit it was death but it
[51:30] works in four
[51:32] stages so just like just like that bug
[51:35] would mature and I I may have that order
[51:38] off though you have to forgive me I
[51:39] maybe I thought the last stage was the
[51:40] Locust stage so yeah maybe I got that
[51:42] wrong you have to forgive me on that one
[51:44] I think I got the order wrong but I hope
[51:46] you understand the process that locust
[51:49] bug goes through four stages just like
[51:51] Satan uses four stages to to kill people
[51:54] spiritually
[51:55] okay now the last one ought to make us
[51:57] all happy because brother R says this is
[51:59] how God's going to restore Israel in
[52:01] four steps he told us in Ezekiel 37
[52:05] remember Ezekiel looked out and he saw a
[52:07] valley of dry bones how many remember
[52:08] that Valley Dry Bones did you notice how
[52:10] many steps does it take to restore that
[52:12] B that Valley four
[52:15] steps
[52:17] Hallelujah it was senu the senu had to
[52:19] come on the bones and then flesh came on
[52:22] the bones and then skin came on the
[52:24] bones and then breath or life the Breath
[52:27] of God which is the Holy Spirit came
[52:28] into them praise God Amen Hallelujah
[52:32] Hallelujah that's how God that's how God
[52:34] restored the Church the lion the first
[52:36] anointing the ox the man and then the
[52:39] eagle and then God is finished with his
[52:41] church he's given them all four
[52:43] anointings and now the church is ready
[52:45] to go home praise God oh Hallelujah
[52:48] godes in four steps four anointings God
[52:50] gives to the church to become the true
[52:53] bride of Christ just like he takes four
[52:55] steps steps to make Israel an army again
[52:58] and the church said does that make sense
[53:01] there's four steps in there now I can
[53:03] flip it
[53:05] over now I didn't have room on the front
[53:08] I just went through the first four seals
[53:09] on the front so now you've heard the
[53:11] first four seals it's basically from 30
[53:14] ad until the battle of Armageddon we're
[53:16] we're I Believe by God's grace we're
[53:19] living under the four seal right now now
[53:21] let me share this for John and irvan
[53:23] preachers might disagree with me
[53:25] and that's okay it's okay that we
[53:27] disagree on this the thing we got to
[53:29] agree on is get saved and baptized in
[53:31] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[53:33] get the Holy Ghost that's what we got to
[53:34] agree on now I have quotes that show my
[53:37] perspective I think I'm right I'm sure
[53:39] they have quotes that they could say the
[53:40] same thing but I believe I have both
[53:42] Bible and quotes to show I'm right
[53:44] that's what that's why I wrote a book on
[53:45] it Hallelujah so that I left my phone
[53:49] number and email if you have any
[53:50] questions on this if you want to know
[53:51] brother Jesse where didd you get that
[53:52] quote why do you think that you can text
[53:54] me your email you can call me I'll make
[53:57] time by God's grace now on the back I
[54:01] put the Seven
[54:03] Seals but I didn't make them I made them
[54:05] all the same size because I I wasn't
[54:07] trying to show how the the first four
[54:09] seals go through church
[54:11] history but let's pick up to the fifth
[54:13] seal
[54:14] now now I wrote in that box in the fifth
[54:17] seal this happened shortly after the
[54:19] Rapture and I'll explain why in just a
[54:21] moment and what is this this is the
[54:23] souls under the altar that are the Saved
[54:26] but blinded Jews these were the Jews
[54:29] that were blinded think of it you're
[54:30] blinded your whole life they can't even
[54:32] see Jesus's Messiah because God blinded
[54:34] them that's in Romans
[54:36] 11:25 God had to Blind them because they
[54:38] rejected him so now he takes the
[54:41] Gentiles but they lived their whole life
[54:43] and they couldn't see Jesus as Messiah
[54:45] but because they kept the Old Testament
[54:47] commands God Saves them because they're
[54:49] blind wouldn't you have pity on a blind
[54:51] man let's say a blind man stepped on
[54:53] your foot and he's he's he blind would
[54:56] you get mad and say why didn't you look
[54:58] at why didn't you see my foot was right
[55:00] there you want to get mad you say oh
[55:02] poor fella right he couldn't see brother
[55:06] brother used that illustration in the
[55:07] fifth seal he say you want to get mad at
[55:09] a blind man so it is with Israel God's
[55:11] not going to get mad at him because he
[55:12] blinded them on purpose amen so he could
[55:15] save the
[55:17] Gentiles praise
[55:21] God now let's read the fifth seal Ro
[55:23] Revelation 6:9
[55:26] this is one of my favorite seals course
[55:27] they're all beautiful
[55:29] but and when he opened the fif seal I
[55:31] saw under the altar The Souls of them
[55:33] that were slain for the word of God now
[55:35] notice what are they slain for the
[55:37] word if you read chapter one of
[55:40] Revelation John had a testimony for the
[55:42] word of God and Jesus Christ so this
[55:46] group has no testimony of Jesus Christ
[55:48] the New Testament they only have a
[55:50] testimony of the Old Testament the word
[55:52] of God and brother teaches this you can
[55:53] listen to this and read this
[55:55] these have to be Jews because they don't
[55:56] have the testimony of Jesus Christ they
[55:58] just have testimony of the word of God
[56:01] and for the testimony which they
[56:03] held verse 10 and they CED with a loud
[56:06] voice saying how long oh Lord holy and
[56:08] true Dost thou not judge and avenge our
[56:10] blood on them that dwell on the earth
[56:12] now two things two things to notice is
[56:15] there any horse in this in this in this
[56:17] seal do anybody see a
[56:18] horse no that means the rapture's
[56:22] already happened that means there no
[56:25] more horse riders there's not it's not
[56:26] the church and Satan battling anymore
[56:28] that's it's done this is after the
[56:30] Rapture there's no more horses and
[56:33] brother BR says that plainly you can
[56:34] hear him say it
[56:36] plainly now the second thing notice
[56:38] they're crying out for Revenge Church
[56:40] think real hard do Christians cry out
[56:42] for Revenge no good sister brother John
[56:44] had it right too what did Jesus cry on
[56:47] the cross he said God Revenge them he
[56:49] said father forgive them they don't know
[56:52] what they do remember when Stephen was
[56:54] Stone what did did Steph say did Stephen
[56:55] say God lay this to their charge that's
[56:58] what David said in the Old Testament
[57:00] right what did Stephen say he said Lord
[57:02] don't lay this to their charge praise
[57:04] Goden so see brother says these men
[57:07] these Souls cannot be Christians because
[57:09] Christians have the spirit of
[57:10] forgiveness brother isn't that
[57:12] beautiful hallelujah oh it makes it it
[57:15] this makes the Bible a brand new Bible
[57:17] praise God cuz we can understand it
[57:20] praise
[57:22] God if you haven't listened to the Seven
[57:24] Seals
[57:25] I would encourage you strongly listen to
[57:27] Seven Seals again remember brother said
[57:29] these are my most inspired sermons I
[57:32] ever preach in my
[57:34] life
[57:38] Hallelujah all right now verse 11 and
[57:41] white robes were given unto every one of
[57:43] them now notice they're getting white
[57:44] robes after they already died but the
[57:46] Bible says we already have white robes
[57:50] in other words we are we're already
[57:51] forgiven our Spirits are already
[57:54] forgiven have the righteousness of
[57:55] Christ during this life but they don't
[57:58] get white robes because they they
[58:00] they're blinded to Christ they don't get
[58:01] white robes until after they
[58:06] die now let's finish verse 11 and it was
[58:09] said unto them that they should rest yet
[58:11] for a little season until their fellow
[58:13] servants also and their Brethren that
[58:15] should be killed as they were should be
[58:16] fulfilled so brother says that means
[58:18] more Jews need to die and that's
[58:21] scriptural because remember the the
[58:23] Beast is going to kill everybody that
[58:24] doesn't take the mark in the right hand
[58:26] or their foreheads remember that so
[58:29] brother say this is true some Jews are
[58:31] going to have to die after the Rapture
[58:33] because they were refused to mark of the
[58:35] beast but remember there's going to be
[58:37] 144,000 they get they get to see Jesus
[58:39] praise God
[58:41] hallelujah all right now everybody got
[58:44] that I know I'm going fast but I got to
[58:45] get this done here tonight by God's
[58:46] grace and I know everybody's going to go
[58:48] to your homework right you're going to
[58:49] go listen to The Seven
[58:50] Seals you should try to if you can uh
[58:54] you can listen to them you know on your
[58:56] phone you can listen to him on the
[58:57] computer for
[59:00] free all right now The Sixth Seal let's
[59:02] go to verse 12 this is the longest one
[59:05] it's 1 2 3 4 five six verses and this is
[59:09] the judgments or the Wrath that Jesus is
[59:12] pouring out on Sinners during the Great
[59:14] Tribulation period now some people
[59:16] believe it's three and a half years some
[59:18] believe it's seven I believe it's seven
[59:19] and I've got quotes and scriptures to
[59:21] prove it I just made a video about it
[59:22] it's on YouTube now a lot of people
[59:23] disagree with me but
[59:25] uh I have quotes from brother Brandon
[59:26] brother BR has quotes on both sides so
[59:27] you got to see which one is right by the
[59:29] word of God so I believe it's the seven
[59:32] years because the the two prophets of
[59:34] Revelation 11 preached the first three
[59:36] and a half years and that gets the the
[59:39] Jews ready to meet Jesus during the
[59:41] second three and a half years that's
[59:42] what I believe now a lot of people
[59:44] disagree with me but that's what I
[59:45] believe but you know what on that it
[59:46] don't even matter what matters is that
[59:48] you go in the Rapture you have the Holy
[59:50] Ghost and you not here during the
[59:52] tribulation that's that's what really
[59:54] matters praise God Amen Hallelujah just
[59:56] be ready for Jesus's coming Hallelujah
[59:59] have your lamps trimmed and clear
[1:00:01] Hallelujah
[1:00:03] now this is the Sixth Seal now look at
[1:00:05] verse 12 and behold I'm sorry and I
[1:00:08] beheld when he had opened the Sixth Seal
[1:00:09] and lo there was a great earthquake now
[1:00:11] that might be the Los Angeles earthquake
[1:00:13] we don't know brother Ram said thus say
[1:00:14] the Lord Los Angeles is going to fall
[1:00:16] into the ocean sometime because of all
[1:00:18] the sins of
[1:00:19] Hollywood that might be I don't know
[1:00:21] it's Los Angeles or not I have a video
[1:00:23] on that too I don't know there's my hour
[1:00:25] so I'll try to finish up here
[1:00:27] uh maybe 15 minutes I'll try to finish
[1:00:30] up
[1:00:32] here okay and the sun became black as a
[1:00:35] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[1:00:38] blood and the stars of Heaven fell unto
[1:00:41] the Earth even as a fig tree castes her
[1:00:43] untimely figs when she's shaken of A
[1:00:46] Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a
[1:00:49] scroll when is rolled together look at
[1:00:51] this and every mountain and Island were
[1:00:53] moved out of their places every island
[1:00:55] so Hawaii the Philippines Japan or any
[1:00:59] islands all the islands are going to be
[1:01:01] moved out of their places they're going
[1:01:02] to get a new
[1:01:04] place and then the Bible later says
[1:01:06] they're all going to sink all the
[1:01:07] islands are going to sink as a judgment
[1:01:10] of God this is the Judgment seal this is
[1:01:14] the during the Great Tribulation when
[1:01:15] God pours out his wrath on all the
[1:01:17] Sinners who did not
[1:01:20] repent all right verse 15 and the kings
[1:01:22] of the earth and the great men and the
[1:01:23] rich men and the the chief captains and
[1:01:25] the Mighty Men And every Bond Man and
[1:01:26] every free man hid themselves in the
[1:01:28] dens and the rocks of the mountains and
[1:01:30] said to the mountains and rocks fall on
[1:01:32] us and hide us from the face of him that
[1:01:33] sth on the throne and from the Wrath of
[1:01:36] the
[1:01:37] lamb for the great day of his wrath has
[1:01:39] come and who shall be able to
[1:01:42] stand okay so the Sixth Seal is wrath
[1:01:45] Jesus pouring out his wrath on Sinners
[1:01:46] who took the mark of the beast that
[1:01:48] failed to repent they worshiped that
[1:01:50] Roman Catholic and denominational system
[1:01:52] thank God he called you out of it praise
[1:01:54] God Amen
[1:01:55] I was a part of it too I was a part of
[1:01:56] the Pentecostal church denomination I
[1:01:58] was part of a a presbyterian
[1:01:59] denomination but God called me out amen
[1:02:02] the Bible said come out of her my people
[1:02:04] that you be not partakers of her sins
[1:02:06] and her plagues hallelujah thank God
[1:02:08] Amen we're called out of that cage of
[1:02:11] unclean and hateful Birds oh thank God
[1:02:14] Hallelujah we're free people tonight
[1:02:16] thank God Church you're not caged up
[1:02:18] you're free you can love God you can
[1:02:19] praise God you have the freedom of the
[1:02:21] word of God you have the freedom of the
[1:02:23] Holy Spirit praise God Amen thank God
[1:02:27] Hallelujah you're free in Christ you're
[1:02:30] not a slave to sin you're not a slave to
[1:02:32] denomination you're not a slave to a a
[1:02:34] mean Pastor right you're not a slave to
[1:02:37] you're not you're not you're not a slave
[1:02:38] to any denomination or any headquarters
[1:02:40] you are a love slave to Jesus Christ
[1:02:42] praise God out of
[1:02:45] love right didn't Paul say didn't Paul
[1:02:49] say I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ isn't
[1:02:51] that what the Bible says see so we are
[1:02:53] slaves out of love MH in other words we
[1:02:55] purposely say Jesus I'm dedicating my
[1:02:57] whole life to you I'm only going to do
[1:02:59] what you call me to
[1:03:01] do I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ oh
[1:03:05] Hallelujah yeah I know Paul was a
[1:03:07] literal prisoner in a prison cell but he
[1:03:09] was also a spiritual prisoner because
[1:03:11] that lines up with what Jesus said he
[1:03:12] said I do nothing except what the father
[1:03:14] shows me
[1:03:16] first and that's why the father loves me
[1:03:18] he said cuz I only do that which the
[1:03:20] father says so how many want to be
[1:03:22] prisoners for Christ I'm almost done
[1:03:24] Hallelujah you will be by God's grace
[1:03:26] just always obey the word of God Amen
[1:03:30] now the Seven Seals not in chapter 6
[1:03:33] it's in chapter 8 so turn your if you
[1:03:36] got your Bible go to Revelation
[1:03:38] 8 verse
[1:03:40] one now this just you know this is the
[1:03:42] most mysterious seal and on these five
[1:03:44] important uh truths I put down at the
[1:03:47] bottom I put on number two look on
[1:03:48] number two the seven seal is often
[1:03:50] debated because brother brother had
[1:03:52] different Visions about it and we don't
[1:03:54] know all the meanings of it brother man
[1:03:56] himself said he didn't know some of the
[1:03:57] meanings but so because it's often
[1:04:00] debated focus on being born again rather
[1:04:03] than debating if you're born again
[1:04:05] you're sealed into the Rapture Ready For
[1:04:07] The Rapture so I don't I don't debate
[1:04:09] with Brothers I tell you I I made the
[1:04:11] videos I said Brothers these are my
[1:04:12] opinions you differ that's fine let's
[1:04:14] make sure we're born again amen because
[1:04:17] God will answer all of our questions
[1:04:19] when we get to heaven Hallelujah but we
[1:04:22] got to get we got to repent be baptized
[1:04:24] filled with the Holy Ghost live for
[1:04:25] Jesus praise God that's what we got to
[1:04:27] do live a holy Godly life now Revelation
[1:04:30] 8 verse1 I'm almost done and when he
[1:04:32] opened the heaven seal there was silence
[1:04:34] in heaven about the space of half an
[1:04:35] hour now brother tells us why is there
[1:04:38] silence because if you read earlier
[1:04:41] those four beasts cease not but cry holy
[1:04:45] holy holy is the Lord God Almighty the
[1:04:46] Bible said day and night can you imagine
[1:04:49] that while you're sleeping the Angels up
[1:04:50] there saying holy holy holy you and I
[1:04:53] are sleeping
[1:04:55] and they're saying holy holy holy
[1:04:57] they're flying around the throne holy
[1:04:59] holy holy holy holy holy we wake up try
[1:05:02] to wake ourselves up get some water get
[1:05:04] some coffee am I awake yet you all the
[1:05:06] angel are still saying holy holy holy
[1:05:09] holy holy holy holy holy holy praise God
[1:05:13] the Bible said Jesus praise is unending
[1:05:15] praise God Amen so we ought to join we
[1:05:18] ought to join Heaven a couple times
[1:05:19] during the day right and say holy holy
[1:05:21] holy is Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's
[1:05:24] what we're doing tonight praise God
[1:05:26] hallelujah we are to join all heaven and
[1:05:29] give him praise
[1:05:30] Hallelujah but now when the seven seal
[1:05:33] is
[1:05:34] Broken Heaven goes quiet brother Braham
[1:05:37] tells us in a couple of places why it
[1:05:39] goes quiet because Jesus left heaven and
[1:05:41] he's coming down to get his
[1:05:45] bride so if if they're not going to cry
[1:05:48] they're not going to worship him if he's
[1:05:49] not
[1:05:50] there the Bible says at the Rapture
[1:05:53] Jesus comes comes to meet us in the
[1:05:56] air so he has to leave heaven and meet
[1:05:59] us in the
[1:06:01] air so the angels can finally get a
[1:06:05] break right that's so brother brother
[1:06:07] said where is that big fella he said he
[1:06:09] went down to meet the Saints in the air
[1:06:12] hallelujah amen so there's a little bit
[1:06:15] of overlap with the the fifth sixth and
[1:06:17] seventh
[1:06:20] seal now the seven seal begins at the
[1:06:23] rasher but it goes all the way to the
[1:06:25] New
[1:06:27] Jerusalem and that's because the seven
[1:06:29] seal is the final mystery in other words
[1:06:32] it goes through all it goes through the
[1:06:34] judgments the Millennium Armageddon goag
[1:06:36] and Magog white Throne judgment it goes
[1:06:39] through everything and then once Satan
[1:06:41] and all the all the evil people are are
[1:06:43] goats cast into fire then the seven seal
[1:06:46] ends and now we enter a new age we enter
[1:06:48] eternity where there's time no
[1:06:50] more so the seven seal tells us is the
[1:06:54] the end of all time it's the end of the
[1:06:56] the vials the end of the trumpets it's
[1:06:58] the end of all human history it's the
[1:06:59] end of any time so last from the Rapture
[1:07:02] the last mystery is from the Rapture all
[1:07:04] the way to the New Jerusalem but once
[1:07:06] the New Jerusalem comes down the Bible
[1:07:07] said there's no more sin the Bible said
[1:07:10] it wipe away all the tears from our eyes
[1:07:12] hallelujah amen there be no more
[1:07:15] time and the Bible says we'll be around
[1:07:18] Jesus we'll walk with him by by Still
[1:07:20] Waters we'll walk with him on streets of
[1:07:23] gold praise God amen he'll have Mansions
[1:07:25] he's the Bible say he's building
[1:07:26] mansions right now for us amen amen he's
[1:07:29] building mansions somehow maybe he's got
[1:07:31] Angels doing it for him I don't know how
[1:07:32] he's doing it but he sits on the throne
[1:07:34] and hears all our prayers too I don't
[1:07:35] know he must have sent angels to build
[1:07:36] the houses I don't know but the Bible
[1:07:38] said that City's full of houses and
[1:07:39] mansions he said I'm going to build you
[1:07:41] Mansions he said hallelujah amen thank
[1:07:45] godes but the seven seal is from the
[1:07:47] Rapture all the way till there's no more
[1:07:49] time it's the final mystery the final
[1:07:52] revelation and then after after all
[1:07:55] death is put away there's no more death
[1:07:57] the Bible say the last enemy destroyed
[1:07:58] is death oh there's that fourth horse
[1:08:00] fourth horse
[1:08:02] rider The Last Enemy is death and once
[1:08:04] death is cast in Lake of Fire there's no
[1:08:07] more time and brother said time Blends
[1:08:10] into
[1:08:11] eternity it Blends and there's no more
[1:08:14] time and we live in the city with with
[1:08:16] Christ forever so last last
[1:08:21] comments five important truths I'm with
[1:08:24] this you've been a great audience been a
[1:08:26] very patient audience I preach a lot
[1:08:28] here I I try to really condense this
[1:08:30] this is the really concentrated y'all
[1:08:32] like concentrated orange juice right
[1:08:34] right you got to all that all that
[1:08:36] Sweetness in that and then you got to
[1:08:37] put add water to it right that's what
[1:08:39] this sermon was it was a concentrated
[1:08:41] sermon now you got to go listen to the
[1:08:43] whole thing all the Seven
[1:08:45] Seals each seal has three forms I get
[1:08:48] this first the seal was a symbol that
[1:08:51] John saw on the aisle of Patmos when he
[1:08:53] had that vision
[1:08:54] each seal was a symbol then it had a
[1:08:57] reality form the dates were actually
[1:08:59] happened in human
[1:09:00] history and then it has a revelation
[1:09:03] symbol that brother random gave us the
[1:09:05] revelation of them that was in March of
[1:09:08] 1963 so each seal has three
[1:09:12] forms that's that will help you
[1:09:14] understand the the
[1:09:17] seals and the second one I already said
[1:09:19] the seven seal has a lot of debate but
[1:09:20] you don't have to worry about it just
[1:09:21] get the Holy Ghost does you got the
[1:09:24] ticket to go in the
[1:09:25] Rapture hallelujah it's supposed to be
[1:09:28] mysterious right it's supposed to be
[1:09:29] mysterious but let me say this about the
[1:09:31] seven seal brother R said the seventh
[1:09:32] seal is the day and hour of Jesus's
[1:09:35] return remember Matthew 24 Jesus said he
[1:09:37] said no man knows the day and the hour
[1:09:39] of my coming he said the Angels don't
[1:09:41] know he said the son himself doesn't
[1:09:43] even know the father is the only one who
[1:09:45] knows do you know that church not even
[1:09:48] Jesus knows when the Rapture is the
[1:09:50] father's going to make it known to him
[1:09:52] how many knew that
[1:09:55] the body of Jesus doesn't know when the
[1:09:57] Rapture is going to be the father the
[1:09:58] spirit inside of him has to reveal it to
[1:10:00] his his his human body this is the time
[1:10:03] of the Rapture that's
[1:10:04] scripture the father keeps that one all
[1:10:07] to himself not even the angels know when
[1:10:09] the Rapture is coming so in other words
[1:10:11] we're all going to be surprised even
[1:10:13] Jesus he's the first one that's going to
[1:10:14] know praise God we're all going to be
[1:10:17] surprised at the Rapture now the third
[1:10:19] truth the seven Church age Messenger to
[1:10:22] leoda is also the seventh angel
[1:10:25] Revelation
[1:10:26] 10:7 it's the same one cuz he's the
[1:10:29] seventh angel the seventh
[1:10:33] messenger okay I know these are deep
[1:10:34] teachings
[1:10:36] here now I want to end with I want to
[1:10:39] read all these but I want let's go to
[1:10:41] the fourth one the revelation of this
[1:10:43] open
[1:10:45] book is that it needs to be eaten all
[1:10:48] these truths need to be eaten or
[1:10:49] believed in order to Prevail against
[1:10:52] hell because Jesus said the Gates of
[1:10:55] Hell cannot Prevail against Revelation
[1:10:59] amen so when you got the revelation of
[1:11:01] the Bible as brother R talked to us and
[1:11:03] you believe this Bible with all your
[1:11:05] heart you might not you can't maybe
[1:11:06] can't explain any of the seals I preach
[1:11:08] tonight but if you know Jesus Christ is
[1:11:10] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:11:11] you believe water baptism and you
[1:11:13] believe the godhead you believe all
[1:11:14] these things then then you have the
[1:11:16] Revelation it's in your heart and the
[1:11:18] Gates of Hell will never Prevail against
[1:11:20] you amen that's what Jesus said
[1:11:22] Hallelujah
[1:11:25] now according to Revelation 10 the whole
[1:11:30] chapter in Revelation 10 an angel comes
[1:11:33] down he looks just like Jesus it is
[1:11:34] Jesus in the form of the Holy Spirit and
[1:11:37] he gives the open book to the seventh
[1:11:39] angel that's brother brandom and then
[1:11:41] we're supposed to eat it and go preach
[1:11:43] it to the whole world that's what's been
[1:11:45] happening since brother Bram
[1:11:47] died preachers have been going around
[1:11:49] the world there's major there's major
[1:11:51] revivals Brothers in Uganda and Japan
[1:11:54] right
[1:11:55] now that're they're hearing the message
[1:11:57] for the first time just like that's
[1:11:58] what's happened to you praise God
[1:12:00] hallelujah praise God Amen thank God
[1:12:02] that's what happened to me 20 some years
[1:12:04] ago 23 years ago praise God I heard the
[1:12:07] message for the first
[1:12:08] time it this this message has to go
[1:12:11] around the world and then Jesus can
[1:12:13] return that's why we need missionaries
[1:12:15] praise God that's why we need
[1:12:16] missionaries to
[1:12:18] Amish we do see the Rapture couldn't
[1:12:21] come until you guys received it you guys
[1:12:23] got to receive the the truth and then
[1:12:25] the Rapture can come anyone else anyone
[1:12:27] else God knows out there who wants to
[1:12:29] believe the truth really wants the truth
[1:12:30] of thus say the Lord God Jesus has to
[1:12:33] wait until they receive it and then he
[1:12:34] can come that's what the Bible says
[1:12:36] that's Matthew
[1:12:38] 24:14 I got it right there right there
[1:12:41] Matthew 24:14 Jesus said the end cannot
[1:12:43] come until the gospels been preached to
[1:12:45] Every
[1:12:49] Nation all
[1:12:51] right so in other words you got to eat
[1:12:53] the revelations that God you got to
[1:12:55] believe the revelations CU that's that's
[1:12:56] what it says John has to eat the book
[1:12:58] this open book no this book no longer
[1:13:00] has Seven Seals it's open now this
[1:13:02] Bible's open now now we can understand
[1:13:04] the Bible like brother Irvin always says
[1:13:06] it now I can understand the Book of
[1:13:07] Revelation he's exactly right that's
[1:13:09] what Jesus did he loosed the Seven Seals
[1:13:11] and he brought down the book for us to
[1:13:12] eat praise God hallelujah how many
[1:13:15] believe that by God's grace heyen we're
[1:13:18] here tonight eating the open
[1:13:21] book we're eating it we're we're
[1:13:23] believing it I know it's true thank God
[1:13:26] for Jesus Christ thank God for the Holy
[1:13:27] Spirit I'm believing this Revelation
[1:13:29] with all my heart
[1:13:31] amen now last but not
[1:13:34] least Church we're living under that
[1:13:37] fourth Beast anointing the Holy Ghost
[1:13:40] flying eagle
[1:13:43] anointing but notice the workers of
[1:13:45] iniquity are allowing that those four
[1:13:47] horse riders to ride through their
[1:13:50] lives swiftly advancing from false
[1:13:53] teachers that white horse to spiritually
[1:13:56] dead reprobates and I give you three
[1:13:58] verses that say people can be dead
[1:14:00] spiritually dead while they're alive
[1:14:04] Hallelujah there's three verses the
[1:14:06] Bible said the woman that lives in
[1:14:07] pleasure is dead while she lives amen
[1:14:11] right uh Jude says these reprobates are
[1:14:14] twice dead plucked up by the roots but
[1:14:17] they're they're on Earth they're they're
[1:14:18] living on Earth in physical
[1:14:20] bodies and the last one Revelation 3:1
[1:14:23] said you have a name you live but you're
[1:14:25] dead that's what Jesus told the the
[1:14:27] church
[1:14:28] age
[1:14:30] Hallelujah so in
[1:14:34] closing brother brandom said when this
[1:14:36] when these Seven Seals were opened the
[1:14:38] Bible became a new Bible why because now
[1:14:40] we see the anointing that we live under
[1:14:43] now we see we've got a now we can
[1:14:44] understand the Book of Revelation that
[1:14:46] helps us understand the entire rest of
[1:14:48] the Bible we can understand water
[1:14:50] baptism uh godhead marriage and divorce
[1:14:53] serpent seed the seven Church ages the
[1:14:55] seven SE we can understand the entire
[1:14:58] Bible now and not be deceived by Satan
[1:15:01] and we just got to keep eating it and as
[1:15:03] we eat the word of God then the Bible
[1:15:05] says that we become like God will grow
[1:15:07] in Revelation and the Bible says we'll
[1:15:09] finish the Great Commission by preaching
[1:15:11] it to Every Nation let's stand by God's
[1:15:13] grace amen Hall let's give God a round
[1:15:15] of applause can we thank you

[1:15:43] seven Church ages and the Seven Seals
[1:15:47] you will be firmly established you will
[1:15:49] stand on like on this concrete you'll
[1:15:50] have a firm foundation in this message
[1:15:54] you study those seals you study those
[1:15:55] Church ages you will have an excellent
[1:15:58] understanding of the word of God the
[1:15:59] Holy Ghost will reveal all these things
[1:16:02] to you and that will help you overcome
[1:16:04] the Gates of Hell Hallelujah and you'll
[1:16:06] be more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus
[1:16:10] Hallelujah now before we close are there
[1:16:13] any questions about any of that and I'll
[1:16:15] point you we'll go right to the
[1:16:16] scriptures anybody have I'm sure there's
[1:16:18] questions but is there any like burning
[1:16:20] question you'd like me to answer while
[1:16:21] I'm here
[1:16:28] remember all questions are good
[1:16:29] questions uh like I like I told you our
[1:16:31] church we always do questions and
[1:16:32] answers on Sunday night I take I take
[1:16:34] questions all the time I I don't always
[1:16:36] have the answers but I'll try to point
[1:16:37] you to the the scriptures that I'm
[1:16:38] talking about take a moment if you want
[1:16:41] to look at that sheet
[1:16:46] again I had something that I but I
[1:16:49] forgot what it was okay no problem
[1:16:51] brother no problem I appreciate like
[1:16:53] three days down the yeah we would all
[1:16:55] think of it I'm the same way brother
[1:16:58] yeah that that's why brother just so you
[1:16:59] know I carry uh I don't have with me but
[1:17:01] I carry a pencil with me and during a
[1:17:03] sermon I write down all these notes
[1:17:05] because I I've learned over the years I
[1:17:07] forget them if I don't write them
[1:17:08] down by God's grace I'm quick to
[1:17:15] forget little bit on yes yes
[1:17:21] um you have
[1:17:24] armd
[1:17:28] armd
[1:17:30] thinks then when you covered that so
[1:17:33] didn't catch that yes sir about what
[1:17:35] what is the battle of Armageddon
[1:17:37] excellent question what is the battle of
[1:17:39] Armageddon so after the Rapture there's
[1:17:41] I believe there's seven years left for
[1:17:43] the Jews to be saved that goes back to
[1:17:46] Daniel 70 weeks and Daniel chapter 9 so
[1:17:49] the Rapture goes jesus takes all the
[1:17:51] Gentile Holy Ghost filled Believers to
[1:17:52] heaven
[1:17:53] the first three and a half years is the
[1:17:55] two prophets probably Moses and Elijah
[1:17:57] preaching to the Jews they die those two
[1:18:00] prophets are
[1:18:01] resurrected now then Jesus reveals
[1:18:03] himself to the 144,000 and I think I'm
[1:18:05] not sure but Jesus might Rapture them I
[1:18:07] don't know that's a good question
[1:18:09] anyways after the 144,000 are saved God
[1:18:12] pours out the trumpets are blown
[1:18:13] trumpets of Wrath and then the seven
[1:18:15] vows are poured out so at the very end
[1:18:18] of the Seven Years brother that's the
[1:18:20] battle of Armageddon when all these
[1:18:23] Armies come to against Jesus in Israel
[1:18:25] they come against Jesus in Israel and
[1:18:27] that's where he comes out of heaven with
[1:18:30] his army of us the Saints and out of his
[1:18:34] sword goes a mouth I'm sorry out of his
[1:18:36] mouth goes a sword and it destroys all
[1:18:37] them and then all the birds come in and
[1:18:39] eat their dead bodies after that after
[1:18:42] the battle arm again then God Burns over
[1:18:44] the whole Earth with fire and then we
[1:18:46] walk out on the ashes of the wicked so
[1:18:48] all these people that died all these
[1:18:49] Sinners their ashes are laying there and
[1:18:51] we walk out into a brand new world and
[1:18:53] new vegetation starts coming up for a
[1:18:55] thousand years we'll build
[1:18:57] houses oh so the Millennium is going to
[1:18:59] be yes the Millum here on the earth yes
[1:19:03] sir great so Armageddon is the last
[1:19:06] battle before the Millennium
[1:19:08] [Music]
[1:19:10] thousand great
[1:19:13] so the the ones that the armies that
[1:19:17] will get conquered on
[1:19:20] Earth is what you refer to as
[1:19:24] armies of Russia Russia and China that's
[1:19:26] at least those are one the two ones we
[1:19:28] know from the Bible yes us is going to
[1:19:30] be off the map probably yeah probably
[1:19:33] because brother saw the vision yeah the
[1:19:35] United States will probably be off the
[1:19:37] map by that time or destroyed or
[1:19:38] conquered we don't know we don't know
[1:19:40] for sure but it's probably it's likely
[1:19:42] going to
[1:19:44] happen yeah great question there let's
[1:19:46] give him a round of applause a good
[1:19:48] question bu I want to encourage
[1:19:50] questions because there's no bad
[1:19:51] question right if you're an honest
[1:19:53] sincere person you it's a good thing to
[1:19:55] ask
[1:19:57] questions and so that's Revelation 19 if
[1:19:59] you want to read about the battle of
[1:20:00] Armageddon I read a little bit on that
[1:20:02] but that's the last battle where Jesus
[1:20:04] come he defends Israel and all the
[1:20:07] armies of men are destroyed before a
[1:20:09] thousand years of Peace the Bible said
[1:20:11] there'll be no sin during that Thousand
[1:20:12] Years CU Satan's bound up he's thrown in
[1:20:14] the bottomless pit for a thousand years
[1:20:16] he falls for a thousand years he just
[1:20:17] falls falls falls for a thousand years
[1:20:20] and there's no and then we brother we
[1:20:22] rule with ODS of iron we're going to
[1:20:24] rule with our wives and our
[1:20:26] children uh and our children are going
[1:20:28] to lead around snakes poisonous snakes
[1:20:30] our children going to lead them out but
[1:20:31] they're not going to have poison them
[1:20:33] Bible said the wolf will lay lay down
[1:20:35] right by the lamb now imagine that
[1:20:37] Wolf's going to cuddle up and they're
[1:20:39] going to cut up together the wolf and
[1:20:40] the lamb time of total peace no sin on
[1:20:43] the earth and is that at the end of the
[1:20:48] the Millennium that Satan's going to be
[1:20:50] released season for he's for a short
[1:20:53] season and then he goes around the
[1:20:54] entire Earth the Bible said the four
[1:20:55] corners of the earth that's just north
[1:20:56] south east east and west west and he
[1:20:59] deceives all the people that are not us
[1:21:02] because God's going to allow people to
[1:21:03] multiply for Thousand Years families
[1:21:06] multiply but we're going to have
[1:21:07] glorified bodies they're going to have
[1:21:08] physical bodies like we have now but
[1:21:11] we're going to have perfect bodies we're
[1:21:12] going to be ruling the Earth the Bible
[1:21:14] says so Satan's going to deceive
[1:21:16] everybody who doesn't
[1:21:18] have uh the white robe and and and the
[1:21:20] rods of iron and then he get gathers all
[1:21:23] of them against Israel we're going to be
[1:21:24] there in Israel with Jesus at the
[1:21:26] headquarters and then right right about
[1:21:28] the time they're ready to attack God
[1:21:30] sends fire down from heaven a wall of
[1:21:32] fire that burns up Satan and all of his
[1:21:35] and then Satan at that moment is tossed
[1:21:36] in Lake of Fire and then after that we
[1:21:40] go to the right Throne judgment and
[1:21:41] that's where anyone that ever lived
[1:21:43] anyone that ever died they're now raised
[1:21:45] up and brought to the judgment and we
[1:21:47] sit with Christ on the judgment and we
[1:21:49] will judge the Sinners we'll judge
[1:21:51] demons at that time too W the Bible said
[1:21:55] we'll judge demons Jesus said I'm going
[1:21:57] to raise up the queen of the South to
[1:21:59] judge the Pharisees of my day because
[1:22:02] they wouldn't come hear me preach
[1:22:04] because the queen of the South traveled
[1:22:06] across the desert to hear Solomon preach
[1:22:08] and he said a greater than Solomon is
[1:22:09] here right
[1:22:11] now so she went to see she went to see
[1:22:14] Solomon a lesser preacher way lesser
[1:22:16] than Jesus right because Jesus was
[1:22:17] perfect so she's going to condemn these
[1:22:19] people who had a greater preacher than
[1:22:21] salmon and wouldn't even go Ross the
[1:22:22] city to hear him preach w a woman is
[1:22:25] going to condemn all those Pharisees a
[1:22:28] Godly woman so sisters you might have to
[1:22:30] you might have to condemn ungodly
[1:22:32] man we don't know God but God's going to
[1:22:35] use your testimony it's going to condemn
[1:22:37] siners who and after that Jesus
[1:22:40] separates we're we're with him on the
[1:22:41] throne but then Jesus separates all
[1:22:42] these that weren't born again he
[1:22:44] separates them as sheep and goats the
[1:22:46] Sheep are taken into heaven or the Sheep
[1:22:48] are taken with him and the goats are all
[1:22:50] cast in Lake of Fire they're burned and
[1:22:52] then the the the future home comes down
[1:22:54] from heaven and then we go take our
[1:22:55] Mansions we go live in our
[1:22:58] Mansions after that who knows what's
[1:22:59] going to happen we got all eternity we
[1:23:01] might move to different planets I don't
[1:23:02] know who knows but we got all eternity
[1:23:05] after that all I know is I want to see
[1:23:06] Jesus praise God Amen where do the souls
[1:23:09] go like today if people die true
[1:23:12] Christians where where are those Souls
[1:23:15] great question they uh I brother man
[1:23:17] says there in the sixth Dimension which
[1:23:19] he says is is uh uh he says the sixth
[1:23:22] Dimension is right below the Throne of
[1:23:25] Jesus so in Revelation 4 and 5 we see
[1:23:27] Jesus on his throne right so brother Ram
[1:23:29] says we're right under their
[1:23:31] waiting okay now there must be another
[1:23:34] dimension lower because we the fisal
[1:23:36] says there Souls under the altar the
[1:23:38] Jews that are crying how
[1:23:40] long Okay so that's what brother random
[1:23:43] says but we know brother we know for
[1:23:45] sure we go to heaven because Paul says I
[1:23:48] go to heaven when my when when this
[1:23:50] Earth Earthly body is dissolved I go to
