TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] A minister came to me the other day said, "Brother Brand, they're getting the office cult down there. Are you ever seen?" Said each one of them every morning they go out and they said they ain't going to work. It's too close to the rapture. If you can't come here at the tabernacle, get some church somewhere. Go to it. But put them kids in Sunday school somewhere. And you go to church. Don't sit at home go fishing, hunting, and things like that on Sunday. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to show how God's prophet, the late William Marryiam Brham, greatly supported church attendance and called people that did not want to attend church and did not want to work an awful cult. So, this video promotes the Bible truth that we should constantly attend church with other believers physically and exposes the sin of laying out of church, not attending a physical church. And a lot of these quotes come from the sermon questions and answers part one August 23rd morning service 1964. It's a beautiful sermon if you haven't listened to it lately. Covers so many important topics like the baptism of the Holy Ghost, giants in the Bible, church attendance, the rapture, so many wonderful topics you'd be blessed to listen to. I listened to it yesterday by the grace of God. This video is going to be a rebuke to the current Brandom Tabernacle. Of course, the people who do not physically attend church and again exposes the fact that they do not do what the tapes say. They actually add to the tapes. But remember friends, our absolute is the holy Bible, the word of God. And brother Bram's tapes are not equal to the Bible. Brother Bram's tapes point us to the Bible. And anyone that would say different is doing what brother Bram said not to do. As that quote from the unveiling of God 1964 said when a man tried to tempt brother Brandham and say he could write his own Bible brother Ram said you can't add one word or take away from the current holy Bible. Brother Ram said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it. It's all revealed in there. And the seven seals opened up the revelation of what that was. It's still in the word. You can't get out of that word. The Holy Ghost won't leave the word. And God's spirit will never leave that word. It'll stay right with the word, blinding some and open the eyes of others. It'll always do that. So any man or preacher or woman or anyone that says the tapes are equal to the Bible is a liar. They have an evil antichrist spirit exalting William Brandham too highly. We just give honor to brother Brandham just like we give honor to John the Baptist and all the Old Testament prophets, New Testament prophets, St. Paul, Agabus. We give honor. The Bible says, "Give double honor to the preachers who labor in the word of God and doctrine, but we never exalt them in a sinful manner like many people do today around the message." Thank God for the truth of the Bible and the Holy Ghost that guides us into all truth to keep us from that spirit of idolatry. Let's start with the Bible foundation about church attendance. Of course, Jesus modeled church, faithful church attendance in Luke 4:16. And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read. So the Bible's plain. Jesus would go to the synagogue every Sabbath. He never missed church. He would never skip the gathering to his father's house because the Bible said he did all those things that please the father. Hebrews 10:24 and 25 tell us to gather more as we see that day approaching. So people that don't gather more are in disobedience to Hebrews 10 24 and 25. In a few moments, we'll look at this quote from Brother Brandham where the people out in Arizona were not working. That breaks 2 Thessalonians 3:10. The Bible says, "If any man would not work, neither should he eat." Now, current Brandham Tabernacle people probably work, but they certainly don't attend church physically. Last summer, I was out in Jeffersonville and took a picture with the new Brandom Tabernacle that was built. And it's incredibly sad that this building sits empty. Year after year, how many millions of dollars were spent to construct this building for all the people that were moving into Jeffersonville that wanted to physically attend church and now they do not attend church. And remember the quotes from God's prophet, Brother Brandham. He says you cannot stay at home and be as good of a Christian. Brother Ram said people say I can stay at home be just as good a Christian as I can at church. You can't. The Bible said not forsake ourselves together and that much more as you see the time coming. If you're a Christian, you long to go to where other Christians are and fellowship with other Christians. So you cannot stay away from church and live the same life. You can't do it because you're not feeding on the word of God. So see friends, we can't change one word from the Bible. The Bible never says stay at home like the current Brandom Tabernacle leadership is falsely declaring. The Bible never says avoid the five-fold ministry, the living preachers. The Bible never says to limit the five-fold ministry. The Bible never says press play and obey. But they always press play and disobey. What the Brandham tabernacle is currently doing is promoting that preachers bury their talents in the earth. like in Matthew 25 26. And friends, any preacher that's a real preacher that buries his talent in the earth and just presses play and won't preach is going to be called wicked and slothful servant according to the Lord Jesus. We also see it in 1 Timothy 4 11-16. Paul told Timothy, "Command and teach these things. Give attendance to exhortation and doctrine. And you can't exhort other people while you're sitting down pressing play. You can't teach doctrine when you're sitting down, pressing play. And verse 14 says, you're neglecting the gift that's in you and give yourself holy to the gift. And of course, preachers that just press play and sit down are wholly neglecting their gift. So they have no profiting in their preaching gift that appears to all. So how are they going to be saved? I don't know. But the Bible said, "Take heed to yourself in verse 16 and to doctrine. Continue in them. For in doing this, thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee. And before getting to these quotes, I do want to say this as well. If Brandham Tabernacle believed every word on tape, they would believe that brother Brandham said he would never be a successful pastor. This is a 1961 questions and answers. Brother Brandham said, "And I wasn't a successful pastor. Never would be." So the current Brandham Tabernacle says brother Brandham is their pastor. If they believed that, if they really believed that and really believed all the quotes, well then they wouldn't have brother Brandham as their pastor because he said he never would be a successful pastor. What kind of church would they be if their pastor was unsuccessful? So this shows they don't believe the tapes. They don't believe Brother Brandham. They're creating their own false religion. They're creating their own false denomination. Now, let's get to this sermon questions and answers part 164. In paragraph 248, they ask brother Brandham, "Are we missing out on something? These people claim to believe every word you say to be true." Brother Ram says, "But they don't. Their own actions prove they don't." So, it's such a parallel. These this group that moved out to Arizona in 1963 or 64, they said they believed every word Brother Random said, but brother Ram said they don't because their actions prove they don't. And the same thing is true with Brandham Tabernacle today. They say they believe every word on tape, but their actions prove they don't because they don't physically attend church more as they see that day approaching. And that's just one of the 24 lies they're propagating. I have a video series about that if you'd like to watch that. A few paragraphs down, Brother Ram said, "These people are his kids and he might give them a little spanking when he goes to see them." And then he says that the group said, "We come to follow the word." And brother Ram says, "I haven't even got a church to send them to there, and they won't go to church anyhow, and I have no church to preach to them. Then I'm morally obligated to take my children out of Arizona." So, Brother Ram said, "This group out in Arizona needed a spanking because they wouldn't go to church." So, Brother Ram makes it clear, a true sign that people believe God is they go to church. Let's listen to the quote. You say, "Let them go. They they did what you told them not to do. that isn't in my heart. I still want to go for them. They're are my kids. I might give them a little spanking when I get them back, but I but I'm I'm sure going after them. And how am I going to do out there? They said we come to follow the word. I haven't even got a church to send them to there. The kind of churches they'll go to there is the same kind you leave at other places, maybe worse. See, and they won't go to church anyhow. And I have no church to preach to them. then I'm morally obligated to take my children out of Arizona where then down in paragraph 258 a minister from Arizona told brother Brandham they're getting the awfulst cult down there you ever seen each one of them in the morning ain't going to work. So I want you to see this minister in Arizona called these tape worshippers an awful cult and then at the end brother Brandham also called them a cult in his closing prayer. You want to hang around to the end to listen to that. That's a beautiful closing prayer that supports the five-fold ministry. So, let's listen to this quote about the awfulest cult. A minister came to me the other day said, "Brother Bram, they're getting the office cult down there you ever seen." Said each one of them every morning they go out and they said they ain't going to work. It's too close to the rapture. They're not going to work. Well, that just shows you don't even understand. That's right. Amen. This thing's going down there. So, yes, sir. You ought to take a lesson from the ant. The Bible says, you know, if they don't work, they don't eat. So that's it's exactly right. Now, earlier in this sermon, questions answers part one in paragraph 208, they asked Brother Random, should we go to other churches even when they disagree with you? Now, what would the current Brandom Tabernacle say? They'd say, "No way. We're not even going to church." Those churches don't have the voice of God is what they would say. Right? But listen to Brother Brandham's answer. Are Brennham Tabernacle people today saying what Brother Brandham said on the tapes? Cuz on the tapes, Brother Ram said, "Yes, you should go to church somewhere. Don't stay at home." Brother Ram said, "Sure. Yep. Jesus did when they disagreed with him." And we saw that in Luke 4. Jesus went to the synagogues even when they disagree with him. So, who's our example? The Lord Jesus Christ. Then, Brother Brham talks about this group down in Arizona. The ministerial group said, "The only thing we have against you, Brother Brandham, is that these people comes out here. We can't get them to go to church anywhere. They won't go to church." Brother Ram says, "Put them kids in Sunday school somewhere and you go to church. Don't set at home." How much more clear could Brother Brandham be? He said, "You dishonor the resurrection of Christ. You go to church somewhere." Let's listen to the quotes. Brother Brandham, should we go to the other churches even when they disagree with you? Sure. Yep. Jesus did when they disagreed with him. Go ahead. Uh, we notice Sharon saids, "Uh, should we go to another church that disagrees with you?" Sure. I don't I'm not the only pebble on the beach. You know, there just other godly man everywhere. I hope I'm one of them. See, but don't never get down here. I was called in on something like this uh the other day. U a group in Arizona called my attention to that. See, a ministerial group said, "The only thing that we have against you, Brother Bram, is one of the things the people that come down here with you, we can't get them to go to church anywhere." Said, "They got children and everything. They won't go to church." And said, "Well, we told them they're welcome to come to our church. I know they put a pressure on you and want you to join, but you don't have to join, but put them kids in Sunday school somewhere. And you go to church. Don't sit at home, go fishing, hunting, and things like that on Sunday." Amen. You say, "Well, I'm not a legalist." Well, you better be in that manner for a while, dishonoring the resurrection of Christ. Next, Brother Bram says he would go to a church if the only thing they believe was that Jesus was the son of God. He said, "I'd go hear them say that." And then, Brother Ram said he'd go listen to an Assemblies of God church because I can eat about three or four slices of bread with them. Let's listen to the quote. If I if I went if I couldn't get if I went to a certain church I know there's only one thing that people ever said that I believe they said they believe Jesus was son of God. They said it. I doubt it but I go hear them say that. Maybe say that's this church. Maybe the next church will be something like the Baptist. They say yeah I believe you have to have an experience. I go with them that then I believe Jesus Christ is the son of God. I believe you have to have an experience. All right. Then maybe there's assemblies of God. Now they believe uh see I now I can eat about three or four slices of bread with them. See, then down in paragraph 213, Brother Ram says he sent 3/4 of a million of his converts to the Assemblies of God because he thought they were the best church in the land to send them to. So he thought they were the church that had the most truth. So he would send his converts to the Assemblies of God. And he wasn't sending them to death. He said, "Would I be a hypocrite to send my own children to death? Far be it from me." So see, we know there are some saved people in denominations. Now, as time has gone on, the denominations have got worse and worse. And there's Bible prophecy that says fewer and fewer people will be saved as time goes on because the deception grows worse. I think it's 2 Timothy 3:13. Paul said that in Matthew 7, Jesus said, "Few there be that find the narrow road that leads to life." But yet, there are still some foolish virgins in denominations that can be saved. Let's listen to the quotes. He said, "Well, Brother Brandham, see, he said he's against you assemblies of God. And if assembly minister happens to pick up this tape, I want you to tell me when is I ever against the Assembly of God man or any other man. Why is it when your own headquarters admit that I have sent to you 3/4 of a million of my children, thou begotten to Christ? How am I against the assemblies of God? Why am I against the oneness? I'm not against no one, assemblies of God, church of God, or no man. I'm against every system that separates man. Look, I have sent to the assemblies by their own count three4ers of a million of my own children. If they're so bad, why' I do that? Why? I think it's the best there is in the land to send them to either the oneness or the some of the Pentecostal belief because they believe in divine healing. They believe in the supernatural. They believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's the best. I can't bring them all right here. They're all over the world. I got friends all over the world, children that I've begotten to Christ. I send them to the best. Do you ever hear me in making an alter call? I send when I get them up there and get them saved, I said, "Now you go to some good full gospel church and get you a church home." How many ever heard me say that? Sure. Sure. Well, why would I send them there then? Would I be a hypocrite to send my own children to death? Or be it for me? No, sir. If you can't go, if you can't come here at the tabernacle, get some church somewhere. Go to it. You don't have to take all they do. What part of bread they're serving? You serve the bread. Well, they got the garlic. Well, you just leave it alone. See, trying. I can't make them. That's exact. Sure. You go to church. Wherever the church door opens, you take off as hard as you can go. If they don't believe what you don't have to partake. Don't join them. Don't join any of them churches, but go to and fellowship with them. How do you know it's not the Lord? He said he make everything work together for the good. And maybe his soul in there ought to be saved, and you can shine the light to them. See, go on down there. Don't go arrogant. Go sweet. The people get say, "That's such a Christian woman, a Christian couple. That's such a Christian boy or girl." I'd like to boy, they really act like they've got something. See, and say, "What is it? Here it is." Then tell them, would you just be salty? They'll get thirsty. Then in paragraph 215, Brother Ram says, "If you can't come here at the tabernacle, get some church somewhere. Go to it. You don't have to take all they do." So, brother Ram says it three or four times, go to church somewhere, don't stay at home. And yet, current Brandham Tabernacle followers will stay at home despite what these quotes say. This shows they have cult mentality. Just like brother Ram said, they're they're one of the awfulst cults. People that don't go to church, people that won't work. And cults often have four characteristics. First, they're close-minded. And that's what the current pastor Brandham Tabernacle says. You don't have time to listen to anybody but brother Brandham because he's so close-minded. He's neglecting the five-fold ministry. Second, they teach blind obedience to authority. And really, their authority is the current pastor of Brandham Tabernacle. It's not brother Brandham because look what these quotes say from brother Brandham. Brother Brham's telling them to go to church. And yet, they don't go to church. So, brother Brandham is not their authority. The only real authority is the Lord Jesus Christ and his holy word that he's given to us. Third, cults do controlled living. Again, the current Brandham Tabernacle pastor tells them, "Don't listen to anything but brother Brandham." Controls their living, tells them to stay at home. He probably tells them other things we're not aware of as well. And fourth, contempt for outsiders. In my video series, the pastor Random Tabernacle says, "Anyone who doesn't press play is a makeeliever." He also calls them names. He also calls them deeis. Anyone who doesn't press play and obey. So that's cult mentality, contempt for outsiders. Finally, let's look at brother Ram's prayer at the end of this sermon. Beautiful prayer. Brother Ram prays for these people out in Arizona that wouldn't go to church and wouldn't work. Again, he humbles himself. He says, he says, "He's just a poor, unworthy, filthy sinner saved by grace." That's how much brother Ram humbled himself. Kind of goes along with that video I put out about Brother Ram calling himself a jellyfish and a son of Kish, not fit to live. Look how brother Ram was so humble. And then, Brother Ram prays for that Arizona group. Help me Lord to gather all them back here somewhere. They want to hear the message with these great teachers as brother Neville. So again, Brother Bram's honoring the five-fold ministry. He's not neglecting the five-fold ministry like the current Brandham tabernacle leadership does. He calls brother Neville a great Bible teacher because he was a living preacher in the five-fold ministry. That's what our prophet said. That's what we believe. Then he names brother Caps. All these brothers here, Juny, Brother Riddle, JT, Brother Collins, Brother Beer, Brother Palmer. God, I pray that you'll just grant this to these. Let them come here where they really hear it. Brother Ram did not pray for them to just play as tapes, just press, play, and obey. He prayed they would come back to the tabernacle to hear living preachers. He said they're trying to do exactly what the scripture told them not to do. And that's exactly what current Brandham tabernacle leadership is doing. They're doing exactly what the scripture says not to do. They're adding to the Bible, adding all their man-made traditions like press, play, and obey. They're taking away the five-fold ministry. They're taking away church attendance. They're doing exactly what the Bible said not to do. Let's listen to the quote. And I pray God that each one of them will be there. Help me Lord to get them all back here something where they can they want to hear the message of these great teachers. Brother Neville and brother Caps and all these other brothers here Junior and brother Ruddle and Hall JT and all them all of them brother Collins and Brother Beer and Brother Palmer and God I pray that you'll just grant this to these let them come here where they really hear it if they want to hear not run off out there in a desert. They're trying to do exactly what the scripture told them not to do. Lo, it's in the desert. Believe it not. Lo, it's in the secret chamber. Believe it not. Lord, I'm trying my best to warn them. But it all indicates that the hour is close now. The evening shadows are falling. And then in the final paragraph for this video, Brother Ram says in his prayer to the Lord have mercy, he said, "Some fanatic to lead some group a cult out into a desert somewhere. Don't let my name have to go down like that, Lord. I fought hard for this. I'm sincere in it as I can be. God, don't let it happen. Now, of course, we know God did let it happen. That group stayed out there. Turned into an awful mess, but they were warned by Brother Brandham. I have a video about that. I have a podcast about that as well. Brother Bram tried to warn them, but they didn't take the warning. But here's where Brother Ram called them a fanatic group and a cult. So, it's cult mentality not to attend church. It's cult mentality not to work. It's a cult mentality to do all these things that the current Brandom Tabernacle is doing. Let's listen to the quote. For mercy, Lord, have mercy on me. Help me. It makes me nervous. Father, I pray that you help me. I I don't want to seal my life, all my work here, but be out you're some fanatic to lead some group of cult out into a desert somewhere. Don't let my name have to go down like that. Lord, I fought hard for this. I'm sincere as I can be. God, don't let it happen. Help me some way. I don't know what to do. I'm just depending on you, but you help me. I'll do anything you tell me to do. I'm your servant. These are your children, Lord. These most of these people, 99 out of every hundred, Lord, is really solid. They believe. They know. They understand. They know it's not me. But I know these things has to follow. Every revival, and this is not immune from it. So, I pray that you'll help us. Now in closing friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Please understand all these things are set in brotherly love and kindness. Just trying to protect God's people, help God's people. We started with the Bible foundation, the Bible requirement for church attendance. If you have the love of Jesus in your heart, you can't wait to see the members in your church because they have eternal life. You have eternal life. You both have the love of God. You love each other. Pray for one another. Support one another. Forgive one another. You're a true spiritual family. You're a part of the royal priesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ. But I hope this video makes you go back and listen to questions and answers part one 1964. Such a beautiful message. And look how brother Ram stays with the word of God and even prays for people to come out of their cult mentality. Let's do that. Father God, I just pray for the Brandham Tabernacle Lord, their leadership and all the people. God, may you call the elect out of that denomination, that cult system that they've got themselves mixed up into. Oh God, help them to repent. God, may they come back to faith in the Bible, in the word of God. Help them to stop adding to the Bible. Help them to stop taking away from the Bible. It's my sincere prayer. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I pray. Amen. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed. [Music]
