TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And we pray, Lord, that you'll receive our thanksgiving first to begin this uh dying year as we're issuing it out tonight in service, issuing it out, giving praise, studying thy word, and knowing what thus sayaeth the Lord means. &gt;&gt; How many things could we put out on a paper to be thankful for? the little narcapes that we've had this year where Satan would have smothered our life out, but you're not through with us yet. So, we're still continuing on. We believe, Lord, that we're only born and raised in this world to honor and glorify thee. Greetings, friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. As we come to the end of 2025, [music] I thought it'd be fun to do a review on all the videos that were released this year by the grace [music] of God. So, we'll look at the top 10 videos of the year and then look at the top 10 videos for the entire 12 years I've been on YouTube with the point of edifying the body of Christ. And hopefully, if you feel led of the Holy Ghost, you can share some videos to edify others, also to witness to others by the grace of almighty God. As I put that video out earlier this year, the four reasons I started this YouTube channel. And one of them was to do outreach since I didn't want to travel overseas because of my large family. I felt I could make YouTube videos and then they could be shared with people overseas or here domestically in the US with the main purpose of getting the message out. As brother Ram said, everyone deserves a chance to hear the message. Thank God we get to hear it every week, multiple times a week, even daily by the grace of God. So by God's grace, here's a few facts about this year. I put out 71 videos. This is the 72nd and October 3rd of this year marked the 12th year that I've been making YouTube videos and putting them out for people to strengthen their faith to defend brother Brandham and to have confidence in the holy word of God, the holy Bible, which is our absolute as God's prophet brother Brandham taught us. And as I reflected upon this year, I began this year by being called a know-it-all, a nad, someone trying to correct Brother Brandham, someone trying to change brother Ram's message. Of course, those are all false accusations. And then the middle of the year, I put out the video that had the most views, which was abandoned. How Brandham Tabernacle has been abandoned, just like the days of King Ahaz. and then ended the year with the 60th anniversary of when God took his prophet home, brother William Brandham. And again, we're so thankful for the ministry of God's prophet, Brother Brandham. We wouldn't be where we are today without the ministry of Malachi 45 and 6, the seven church age messenger, the prophet to finish the mystery of God, as the scripture tells us. So, let's start with the top 10 videos of 2025. Number 10 was reaction to Derek Prince's claims about Brother Ram's death. Ninth was, "Is Donald Trump a forerunner of the Pope Antichrist?" Eighth was reaction on Justin Peters calling William Brham a false prophet in charlatan. Seventh was on interracial marriage. Brother Brandham called it perfect and God's choice in relation to Moses and Zapora. Sixth was when will Los Angeles sink? William Brandham's prophecy about the sinking of Los Angeles. Now, two of these have been from years previous to 2025. So, the Derek Prince video was 2024. The sinking of Los Angeles video was from 2023. So, it's nice to see even a couple years later, they still get lots of views cuz people have those questions. Hopefully, that gives them Bible answers by the grace of God. The fifth top video of the year was no tapes, no token, another lie coming from Brandham Tabernacle. The fourth video of the year was new Pope Leo I 14th predicted 71 years ago by God's prophet brother William Brandham. And again, it's still staggering to know that brother Brandham predicted a pope from the United States in December of 1954 there would be a pope rise out of the United States and then if our records are right, 9 months later, Pope Leo I 14th was born. So, it's likely Brother Anom predicted this the month that the Pope was conceived in his mother's womb and then he was born 9 months later. Amazing. The third video of the year was the serpent seed nine Bible proofs part one of three. And again, that's from 2017. So, it's awesome to see a video made 8 years ago as the third best video of the year. And I just love the serpent seed revelation. That's what first drew me to the message of the hour. Then, of course, God revealed the rest of the mysteries of God. But that topic is so important. Brother Ram said, "It doesn't save, but it shines more light on the truth we're all trying to see, which is the revelation of Jesus Christ." The second video of the year was responding to three criticisms on three of my videos regarding interracial marriage, ministers marriage requirements, and the order of the great tribulation period. And the top video of the year, as I mentioned earlier, was abandoned five parallels with Brennham Tabernacle and King Ahaz shutting the temple doors. And now, just for your reference, if you're new to my channel, let's go over the top 10 videos over the 12 years that we've been on YouTube here by God's grace. And if you haven't viewed them, I'd encourage you to view them. Share them with friends, family members, co-workers, however you feel led to share them with by the grace of God. That's why I made them so people could watch them in the privacy of their own home and the Holy Spirit could deal with them in order to receive the word of God. So number 10 in these 12 years is the serpent seed nine Bible proofs part three. It's neat to see all three serpent seed videos are in the top 10. Number nine is jewelry tattoos in the Bible. Number eight is the serpent seed nine Bible proofs part two. Seventh highest video is three prophecies of William Brham. Now by God's grace as years have gone by I'm up to seven now. Seven prophecies brother Brandham foretold in the name of the Lord that came to pass. But back then in 2014, I just found those three. So here we are 11 years later and I found four more prophecies with us, sayith the Lord, Amazing Grace. The sixth video is the serpent seed, nine Bible proofs, part one. The fifth video is modest clothing, four Bible guidelines, and that video helped me write my 2019 book about restoring Christian modesty. The fourth video is long dresses in the Bible, which shows how crossdressing is an abomination. It always has been to God and always will be. And that's even more obvious today with all the transgender confusion. But thank God for a prophet of God. Thank God that God has dissolved all of our doubts and we know the truth on the issue of crossdressing by the grace of God. The third video is thus sayith the Lord future prophecies of William Brandham. I believe there's 11 future prophecies on there if I'm not mistaken. Second highest video is long hair in the Bible part one of two. And the most watched video of the past 12 years is makeup and the Bible. So again friends, thank you for watching these videos. Thank you for sharing them. It means so much to me. So wonderful to know that the gospel is being spread through this format. This is the format that works best for me. My family's too big for me to travel. I don't have the money to travel. So this is a great way I can do evangelistic work. I can do teaching and preaching and spreading the message of the hour, the Bible-based message, and it doesn't happen without you sharing them. So, thank you and God richly bless you for that. In closing, friends, it's been another wonderful year again by the grace of God, preaching the word of God, sharing the word of God, and let me again say my gratitude to all the listeners who not only listen and watch the videos, but then they leave kind comments or sincere questions. I love those as well. And a big thank you to those who share the videos. It means so much. Seems like a lot of people share the videos through WhatsApp, which is wonderful. Other social media sites like Facebook. So again, thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping spread the end time Bible message, the revelation of Jesus Christ, the final message to the final church age. May God bless you as you go into 2026. Thank God. In Hebrews 13, it says, "God will never leave us nor forsake us. Jesus is still standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. The same Lord Jesus Christ who is with St. Paul, Iranius, Martin, Columba, Luther, Wesley, and brother Random is with the bride of Jesus Christ today. Praise God for that. Thank you saints for another wonderful year. Let's press on toward the mark of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. As we do every year, we wonder and pray, could this be the year of the coming of the Lord? We don't know. But we can do two things. we can watch and pray. So, we'll do that by the grace of God. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. [music] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He is never failed.
