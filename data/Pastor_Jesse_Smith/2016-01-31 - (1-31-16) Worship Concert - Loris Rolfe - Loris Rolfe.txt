Lord Jesus father we just pray you'd bless him anoint him here tonight aresh Lord God after a long day yesterday Lord in a service already this morning and pray you just guide him and strengthen him Lord God may we all enter into just the spirit of worship an atmosphere of adoration and praising you because of your Holiness and because of your love and your mercy we we'll be doing this throughout eternity Lord it never gets old never gets old it is truly our privilege Lord on this Earth so we thank you for these things Lord and just bless this reading of Thy word Lord that you might be glorified in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen let's just take your Bible if you got to little scripture there we're not going to stand I'm not going to real have you because I'm not really going to preach but but uh we want okay let you stand for this first one okay let just I thought about it yeah we better stand 1 Samuel 16:23 this is the course of David for Samuel 16:23 I just got a few I got four more from The Book of Psalms just some scriptures that came to my mind I wrote down before service that just encourage us about the power of song and 1st Samuel 16:23 and it came to pass when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul that David took an harp and played with his hand so Saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him amen amen look at the power of the spirit upon somebody's hands playing music uh let's go to Psalms 33:3 let's just read verse one Psalms 33:1 rejoice in the Lord oh ye righteous for praise is calmly for the upright so if you're living upright you love to praise God it's a beautiful thing it's a pleasant thing to praise God praise the Lord with the harp sing unto him with a Sury and an instrument of 10 strings or 10 fingers uh sing unto him a new song play skillfully with loud noise I've never heard a more skillful player than brother Loris so we're thankful for the skill God's given him and all the time he's invested into his gift he just didn't sit back and say God just you know quickly give it to me he invested in it we're thankful for that and I like the new song there he said he might have some new songs so praise God Psalms 98 verse4 Psalms 98 verse4 we're familiar with this Psalms 98:4 Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord all the Earth make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise sing unto the Lord with a harp with the harp and the voice of a Psalm with trumpets and sound of cornet Make a Joyful Noise before the Lord the king amen glory couple more here uh Psalms 144 verse n 144 verse 9 I will sing a new song unto thee Oh God Upon A Sultry and an instrument of 10 strings will I sing praise unto thee praise God emphasizing the new song There amen and then the last one Psalms 147 verse one we'll read one through three because I think it kind of goes together praise ye the Lord for it is good to sing praises unto our God for it is pleasant and praise is calmly I think when everybody leaves here they're going to see say it was so pleasant to be in the house of the Lord tonight right that's what it is that's what praising the Lord brings a pleasant Spirit to you the Lord does build up Jerusalem see how music Build You Up he gathered together the outcast of Israel Glory he Health the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds you may be seated it just for a moment here and then I just want to say a few more things I'll was just mention this um I think last Sunday yeah when we were leaving after second service and it's talking about how the spirit Lord would come down in the evening and the cool of the evening we're talking about that and uh always why we love second Services you know um but uh I just wanted to you know just testify I did pray seven years for a piano player and the Lord finally gave me one and uh it was right on time and brother Lis as I said has been a a Godly friend a Godly example before me and I've just told my wife many times I just appreciate his example and I just love sitting and listening to brother Loris you know we we haven't had many we used to go out you know between Services all the time but I've been so busy with the baby we haven't had that but I miss that I miss just sitting and listening to him explaining things like wow he's as sharp as a tack you know I hope I'm I'm that sharp when I'm his age you know but he's so sharp I just uh he can really explain things so well I'm like my I just kind of sit back and admire just the the character that he is and uh and then I was reminded last Sunday night when Loris first started coming uh my daughter that the that first service after we had service went home and uh I think it was AAA just sat at the table for an hour just singing the songs we' sung in church and we're just praising God an hour after we had that first service with brother Loris playing and and I was just crying there at the table just rejoicing God you know she couldn't tell I was watching her you know um and then a couple times after that the first couple Services uh my daughter would look over at my wife and say I'm crying I'm and my wife's like why are you sad she's like I'm not sad it's just there's something about it and we figured out later it was just the music and uh I remember you know crying and praising God too just to have a musician like brother Loris and I still cry I wouldn't cry now uh because it's everybody's so important and every every gift is so important but there is a great importance on Psalms that's why as we saw with J with Joshua and Jericho God used one example from Joshua 6 the order of that that March that parade God used that one example to Forever give us the pattern of how the word should go forth that is so beautiful oh my that the songs that go before the word you know and that just one example gives us our Eternal pattern for how the word should go forth and and so we're just grateful for that and uh just knowing you know that God uh here will will bless our brother and be with us tonight praise God so uh just take your time brother Loris don't be in any rush let's just give Round of Applause praise God God bless you
