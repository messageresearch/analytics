amen and uh so appreciate the opportunity to be able to speak about this on these angels of the lord it's been something that uh once the lord opened this up to me a little bit i i'm beginning to see more and more and more and more and more what paul meant about being caught up in heavenly places in christ jesus and it's just more than just a spiritual feeling that you get but there's actually it's a realm you're living in there's a whole thing going on around us all the time angelic help and visitations and blessings of the lord so i i thank god for that we appreciate the lord appreciate my mom being able to be with us and i want to do some singing with mama and then we'll get right into the word you ready i called her mommy this morning that's my mommy amen hey man i don't care how

to be a christian tonight amen amen excuse me daniel chapter 10 pardon me 10 and 7. oh thank you lord hallelujah well i tell you brother the presence of the lord is so wonderful hallelujah certainly love the lord jesus thank you jesus remember that little feeling i was talking about this morning yeah i feel it just moving right on in just slipping right on in it's the angels of the lord showing so appreciate the lord all right daniel chapter 10 and let's pick up now verse 7. and i just want to catch one verse and then skip down a bit just to get kind of a kind of a setting here and i daniel alone saw the vision the men that were with me saw the vision but the great quaking fell upon them so that they fled to hide themselves therefore i was left alone and saw this great vision now got verse 12. they said unto me fear not daniel but from the first day that thou did has set thine heart to understand i want you to listen in words not only did god hear what daniel was saying day one but daniel's prayer created activity in another dimension amen his desires created activity glory in another dimension hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord now watch he said i like this he said i am come for thy words thy words were heard and i am come for thy words yes appreciate the lord now let me read to you out of a message um brother man just takes a little thought here and and i i like how he says this he said uh in the presence of the lord jesus the title the presence of the lord jesus this is 55 if you're interested look at this up sometime he said there's minor angels he said perhaps it's angels with us he said of that that comes to the your humble servant he said and that's probably a minor angel but when gabriel comes brother there's something really on the road something major is going to happen gabriel announced the first coming of the lord jesus and gabriel will announce the second coming of the lord jesus and then brother brown says amen let's pray together with the word lord jesus as we bow our heads to you we are so grateful father for the opportunity to be able to open up the bible lord what a privilege it is to be able to do so with revelation and understanding in our hearts that which we are going to partake of tonight we know has been prepared by the master chef lord all the ingredients are right now and all of the components of the uh of the food lord is just exactly balanced the way it needs to be done lord jesus we depend on you to feed our souls tonight as we come to your table hungry and thirsty and asking not begging but asking to be fed by thy word lord as we ask you to take the service into your hands tonight lord we just pray that this portion of the preaching will be an utterance from almighty god may it not be the voice of man that has heard but may the spirit of the lord speak through us in the name of the lord jesus christ as we commit the word both speaker and listener to your hands in jesus name amen amen amen god bless you may be seated may the lord bless you real real good and i'm going to keep my eye on that clock real close tonight i don't want to get in a gigantic hurry but i realize you got work school and uh and and folks to take care of and so we want to make sure you're ready to be able to do that but we don't want to just cut it off now we want to spend some time in a word but i also realize that you know timing allows to stay here all night and believe me i could stay here a month on this subject right here and all the things the lord has showed me on this over the past several weeks uh it would take me as i was telling brother cam uh last week it would take me a good month just a solid month of preaching just to scratch the surface of some of the things that i found in the message in the bible on these angels of the lord so what i want to bring to you tonight by the help of god is the this is the highlights of the whole study and uh i thought well in evangelism i'll just kindly throw out some of the main points out there and then you got a pastor sitting back there and that's part of his call is to take months and dig into these things and so maybe he can run into it and and bring it in later but um i i want to try to show you uh because i i personally feel that this is an important subject to us especially now we're living in the importance of the angels of god that are with us in this uh last day and i i want to try to show you some of the reasoning as to why that when we point to a cloud up in the sky in arizona so i was looking for the jesse's got the life magazine back on his desk and i've got one myself and many believers you know we get it we open it up like this and we look at it and we see those angels that wigged the face of the lord jesus out there in arizona and as i was speaking to uh brother doug baker the one that invented the four missile out there that they claim and the claim is made that it's just rocket ship smoke but i spoke to brother doug and we were talking and he said my rocket don't do that amen and i asked him his rocket he said yes i i'm i was on the team the lead of engineers that uh done the uh mechanics and the invention to make the rocket that supposedly was the one that made that ring cloud he said my rocket don't do that now we understand what brother venom said about this event in arizona he makes the statement rise in the sun that that's our lord up there we know what he talked about when he talked about the visions of the lord coming and the visitation of these angels of god as they appeared now that's significant to us because whether folks realize it or not and i personally believe and you don't have to believe this but this is what i believe i believe one reason it has been so attacked is because it is the fulfillment of the prophecy that jesus gave in the last day that with the time of the harvest the angels of the lord would come and they would sever some gather others and they would separate and then we see according to matthew chapter 13 if you got your bible you can turn there or look here on the screen they'll flash it as we go and uh pick up three verses 39 41 and 49 and in these three verses it just kind of highlights the whole thing that jesus is talking about when he said that the enemy that sowed the tear of them being the tear the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are but the angels all right now that scripture that's your bible skipping down to verse 41 just a verse or two there he said the son of man shall send forth his angels in it interesting that he said the son of man would send forth his angels notice not son of god not son of david but son of man which is what we believe was restored back here in luke 17 that the hour we are living would be the restoration or the revealing of the son of man and in the hour of the son of man ministry then the angels of god would come forth watch now they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and then in verse 49 so shall it be at the end of the world again the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just so i believe with all my heart you don't have to believe this anybody that gets this recording and picks it up on youtube or facebook or wherever this may go you don't have to agree with what i'm getting ready to say i'm telling you i believe this this is my revelation of what i believe is taking place but one reason that that cloud in arizona has been so attacked is it is the fulfillment of the prophecy that jesus spoke in the last day that god would send forth his angels to gather and to sever all those that are just would be gathered into the barn all those that were unjust would be severed away from the rest of the bride of jesus christ now let me bring a little illumination to you about where we're living today and uh will you give me a little time can i do that tonight all right now i want you to understand that as a bible believing christian number one i don't want to receive anything that i hear unless i can understand it by scriptural authority as a bible-believing christian i don't want to be baptized in a way that's not bible i don't want to live in a way that's not bible i don't want to marry in a way that's not bible i don't want to eat or drink in a way that's not bible i want my plum line or my absolute to be based upon what the scripture has taught us right now so and we realize it's the famous scripture people say well if you seek him in the desert and they'll say now so you don't go running after that in arizona there ain't nothing to that well i'll agree with you that that some people might view the events of the last day as being a bunch of nonsense as i heard a man speaking uh not too long ago and he said that brother branham has a wonderful gifted man and when the anointing was on him he was a prophet of god deserting signs and wonders but he said because he couldn't accept trinity and because he couldn't accept this and that you know he just got off in his teaching but if he's a true prophet of the living god of the last day a prophet is a divine revealer of the scripture somebody say amen amen his ministry his job if he is a prophet of the lord is to be a mouthpiece for almighty god in other words his thoughts become blended with god's thoughts his voice becomes blended with god's voice and god speaks right through the man what god's mind and thoughts and heart is for the hour we're living in but remember we're not looking at this through the filter of an old testament and i'd say a keyhole in a motel we're not looking at it through the keyhole of the old testament because a new testament prophet is not the same thing as an old testament prophet when god was dealing with those in the ages and he was dealing with israel as a nation an old testament prophet would step out of the wilderness we thus saith the lord step back into the wilderness and you better listen to that because he was the only voice that god was going to speak through in that generation amen there was never two prophets major prophets that were running their messages at the same time there was never two major influences pulling this way in that way god always had one mouthpiece speaking out bringing the people together all right let's go a little bit further but then when we come to the new testament then we discover that there are many prophets and that's in the plural down through the new testament but we also realize that jesus spoke to us that there would be those in the ages that would be what he called messengers to each church age and in the apostolic form of the gentile bride it would not just be a prophet speaking but it would be one messenger of god that would be given the message of the lord for that hour that message would speak out once the message went out then all of those ministries prophets included would come right out underneath that ministry and what would they be doing they'd be bringing the people to the truth to the revelation of that hour and they would be speaking only what the revelation of that hour was amen exactly right and remember these stars were in the right hand of almighty god and that's exactly what isaiah prophesied when he asked the question to whom is the arm of the lord revealed well the arm or the revelation of the arm of the lord was revealed in those seven messengers whenever those seven messengers began to reveal what was the body of christ what was the fullness of the godhead what was the unity of the bride in jesus christ who is jesus christ is he a second a third what kind of person is he when the revelation come it showed that god was god and he was all in all and he was one he wasn't two he wasn't three he wasn't nine like many had said many years ago but he was he was absolutely almighty god and his bride together in a body the head and the body consequently that's what showed up in arizona ahead the revelation of the lord showing us now that the revelation of god would be fulfilled in the last day and the angels of the lord would bring a unity of the body of jesus christ friends i'm going to go on record and say something and and i realized that with this being recorded like this that could be spun anyway but i want to be very transparent when i say this and i want to be very blunt when i say this and make the statement that i realize that the reason that some of our message churches are are empty like they are it's not always because we're so spiritual and nobody can handle us i realize there's a lot of nonsense that runs through our churches there's people that aren't born again pastors that aren't born again deacons that aren't born again that have created a lot of trouble i get that and i realize that people leave churches because of their treatment how they've been treated and the lies and the things they see going on they just get fed up with it so i'm leaving i understand that too but at the same time did you ever stop to consider that one reason why our movement as far as we say the message of the hour our movement has you know maybe say a thousand to the million on the other side is because of the ministry of these angels of the lord because remember if they're called to sever and they're called to gather then these angels of the lord as we read this morning from greatest battle ever fought that brother man said a true angel of the lord will only preach the word that's all they can preach and then if an angel paul said or we ourself come from heaven preached anything contrary let him be a curse and brother branham said he preached exactly what paul preached amen that's why i'm not ashamed to pull brother branham to believe brother branham to follow the message of the hour because what brother branham had to say it dovetailed with what paul taught us amen and when the angel of the lord come in the last day and told him about divine gifts and told him about divine ministry amen everything that brother branham accomplished in his ministry was according to the prophecy that was given about his life and realized that in the last day that it was promised that there would be a forerunner to come and gather up all these mysteries of god he would be a church age messenger he would be one of the stars that was the revelation in the hand of the lord that would reveal to the body of jesus christ where they were standing now jesus said when these angels come there would be tares and then there would be wheat all right is that what he said he said he would gather some tares he said he would gather some wheat well how do you know what exactly position you're standing in of whether or not you're a tear or whether or not you're weak unless there is a divine revelation straight from the scripture to show you the position of where you come from who you are and where you're going amen that's why in the last day the spirit of god sent a man to this generation to reveal to the body of christ where we're standing and who we are where we come from and where we're going amen and that's why elijah had to return to this world was to give you and i a look into god's gospel mirror amen to see who you were you remember that little boy he waved and it way back smiled and smiled back and said finally got it you understood that was me in there amen that's what brother branham did and you realize that as i said this morning william branham did not come to bring any new revelation whatsoever remember the book was completed when the book was shut up amen it was sealed with seven seals you cannot add two you cannot take away the revelation is complete in this bible but remember there were secrets that were laying in this book of revelation and hey buddy let me just go on record and tell you something right now not all rabbits uh or roberts not billy graham not jack cole not a allen not one man desired or thirsted or alone to look into the revelation of this bible to understand what those secrets were to ladies find me where oral roberts spend time digging in find me where billy graham desired to look into it finally some man out there that really wanted to know what the truth of the bible was you won't find him you got different men that come along like mr hagin and some of those that that done what they call bible teaching and all of their trinity tommy writing bible teaching to me that's wasted my time amen amen i can read the bible to see that god is one hero israel the lord our god is one god and fear him and the devil knows better than that satan don't even believe his own trinitarian doctrine right he preaches he he knows that he's one he's been up there and split face to face with a man he knows there's not a big old grandfather god with a big long beard hanging there jesus sitting on his right arm on his knee or something and the holy ghost running around like a bad man the devil knows better than that satan knows he's one god the bible said he knows it and he trembles at the very idea that's right so it's not a an idea of okay well now now we're going to do what they call bible teaching well their bible teaching pointed an organization the bible teaching point and put your name on the books getting tongues for evidence uh on and on and on but now we're looking at a man in the last generation that like daniel desired to know what was going to take place in the hour he was living in america as different men have said in different time that brother branham tried to make changes to himself he was listening at a man this morning and he was talking about brother branham and he said brother branham desired to make a change from being a great evangelist to making himself a prophet and i i said how ridiculous if you even knew anything about the ministry of william branham you know how many times he struggled with even the identity of being called a prophet even in those prayer lines when he was standing up there and he would say do you believe me to be his prophet uh his servant i don't mean to say that that stumbles people he says hey man there was a reality inside of brother bradley that he knew that god had called into a higher office he knew that god had called him to be a prophet of the lord he wasn't no dumb bunny as we say in the south he understood exactly what his ministry was supposed to be about to some extent he knew god had caught it even when media got down to pray he tells us about in the church age about lord now i've heard you give scriptures and things like this to encourage us and lead us and said she got down about praying about mary and brother branham and she said she grabbed her bible when she did she jerked it open and said behold i send you a lie to the prophet before they come now brother tells that story while he's preaching the church ages brother madam wasn't silly he understood the message that he was sending to those people but because he did not desire to take the flame and the claim of fame to himself he was always trying to step away from that he'd drop it in step it away drop it in step it away amen but understand just like daniel this was a man that wanted to know what is going on in this hour amen yes sir the bible said daniel set his heart to understand can you imagine he looks across all of israel now he's not not taught israel the nation i mean israel the people right here he is locked in babylon 70 years has been determined that god's going to house his people under judgment they're going to be bound and changed they're going to be stuck in this position when i say chains i don't mean natural bondage now but i mean they're made slaves to the nation they're not permitted to go as they want to go and come as they want to come and so forth like that and no doubt daniel when they erected that great statue out there remember i heard a preacher preach it many years ago one little thing like you'd say the size of this microphone it was about 20 foot tall i think the brothers did so i don't know how tall it was but something on that order yeah and all the israelites started bowing down and worshipping at the image of daniel did you imagine what it must have done to that little prophet of god to look out there and watch the people that he knew obeyed the same law we're supposed to about don't worship graven images and then this group of israelites are falling down on their face and worship with the image under political pressure no doubt right they were quarantined just like everybody else has been quarantined they had their own little political church pressures and things right and here except for three other men shadowed meshach of indigo all these israelites are are compromising their standard what it must have done to the little heart of that prophet of god daniel when he looked across there and saw that church compromising like that something began to turn in him something began to happen in his mind his heart began to smite him maybe and he threw open his windows and he raised his hands up to god and he said oh jehovah i need to know what's going on anybody ever felt like that sometimes you just god i need to understand what's going on there's a hidden mystery in there sometimes you don't understand what the revelation is but like daniel you set your heart to understand god what's the end of it all right how does it all figure into my life what's the result of everything amen and hear daniel as he begins to pray now notice as i quoted to you this morning that at the angels would say on a 10-point scale if an angel was an eight when he fell from heaven become a demon he would always be innate never lost one ounce of power his authority if you want to say authority or power whatever it was was always just the way it was and so as gabriel begins to descend and moves from that spiritual realm now he's beginning to fall down to contact daniel there was a demon that controlled persia brother tells us the message called victory day that the reason that wars are created and fought on the earth and so forth he says because there's demons that control the nations they get jealous of one another and start a war on the earth that's the reason why it happens in churches two demons on two different people get mad and jealous of one another they start as church split yes sir or some other kind of thing like that some other little family altercation it's just demon powers all there is to it yes now when gabriel descends the the demon or this former angel fallen angel that he meets when he comes to persia had more power than him he could not overcome him right for 21 days he fights this demon and he said i would have been completely overcome but he said michael your prince come and help me out oh i like them words your prince now notice it was because daniel now listen close it was because daniel wanted to know what hour he was living in the very burden of his heart created activity in another dimension amen amen things were stirred up in a supernatural way no doubt there was results from the supernatural presence of god that would have never been known had not daniel set his heart to understand yes yes sir i want you to stop a moment and thank you in your mind why do you recognize the holy spirit gets stirred up in churches sometimes because there's some saints of god and they're crying out to god lord we need revelation we need to understand we need you to move amongst our homes our families amen the very moment you set your heart to know it creates an activity in them other realms it creates a buzz a stir it creates a a momentum in that other realm because remember if these angels of the lord are commissioned of god to serve you the very moment you have a need they go into action i wonder sometimes when we look at this whole scene do we really understand why pentecost had the movement at hand you realize that whenever 1906 pentecost had started we're talking over 100 years now yeah you go back and look what was it it was people that really wanted to know what god was all about that's right they desire to know is god just a justification is god just a sanctification what is he and as they begin to look at the whole pictures we would say look at the whole thing oh i like how a friend of mine said it many years ago he said william seymour he said he was a one-eyed black man he said but william seymour could be more with one eye than most people could but hallelujah he began to look into the revelation of the hour he prayed with his head in a box asking god to move amongst the pentecostal people before long god visit them on that azusa street revival and from that revival it's spurred all around the world i've just done a a peer-reviewed study and when i say peer-reviewed i mean from experts and i studied pentecost from every facet every direction i read from many many doctors and scholars and theologians and let me tell you something brother when william seymour and the azusa bunch when they got rolling that thing didn't just start in azusa it went around the world in a matter of a year it touched australia it touched africa it's still burning in africa right now until pentecost is larger in africa than any other cotton in the world outside the united states they still identify themselves with that original move what was it people wanted to know what was the truth they wanted to know if god was in the supernatural god left him he'd be with us where's all of his miracles people began praying to understand and from the pentecostal movement now we're moving into a dispensation of time that god is raising up these healing ministries yes when the angel of the lord meets brother branham in 1947 he tells him about the gifts of god he sends him to the field brother man goes out with a great healing revival and while he's out there on the field in this great healing revival amen he praying for kings and blinded eyes coming over on and on and on and on and on all of a sudden something happened to this little prophet he began to see the dissension amongst his brethren in pentecost oh i hope you're listening to me he began to watch his brethren bow down to the shrine of money and popularity and like daniel he looked at his own people and he recognized something was bad wrong yeah you hear him talking about it as he approaches 19 and 56 america is about ready to make the most crucial decision she's ever going to make listen at him in 1955 when the holy spirit starts meeting him and shows him in 1954 the vision about the great tent and fishing by the lake and the first and the second and the third pool you know the story yes the holy ghost deals with him about how that these gifts of god were only given to catch the attention of the elect of jesus christ and now brother begins to preach in 1955 new ministry he goes right to mark 11 23 and 24 about the spoken word by this time god has already shown in the squirrels and other things have taken place hattie wright's been on the radar all these other things are happening around him he's no longer just an evangelist with a tent ministry right with a healing revival oh glory yes but now something's beginning to stir now you think what you want to but brother baby said when gabriel announced the first coming he would announce the second coming and i submit to you is it possible that there was activity in another world that caused that little prophet of god to begin burdening in the first place maybe gabriel was doing some things in another dimension maybe the holy ghost was working in a certain way notice i said maybe maybe god was beginning to work in a way because remember a man cannot create that desire of himself it must be given to him by god yeah so you hear him talking he's laying up against the tree in october of 62 he's getting ready to preach statue of a perfect man he said i lean up against the tree he comes this way two plus two is four and faster and faster he said until the revelation opens up i sit there before daylight oh they talk about well you know brother brennan and the great things he's done in the healing revival but let me tell you something god called him to do the work of an evangelist and while he was under the ministry of that evangelist there was one angel of the lord that showed up in the platform but now all of a sudden he has a vision and in this vision brother jesse he doesn't see angel he sees angels now i'm here to ask you a question is that not what the bible told us jesus said would be here in the last day in the harvest the harvest wasn't the first stage that wasn't paul's age the harvest went down there with martin luther that was the beginning of a reformation any bible reader knows now is the hardest time now is the hour of the heart and here this little prophet of god's now seeing visions at first he can't make it out he tells us he sees five dubs he thought of it and then uh reproach for the cause of the word in 62 he tells us it was five angels it comes along a little further as the vision is beginning to make himself known listen this was not a perfect man that every time he had a vision he understood it right right he didn't no prophet understood every vision they said all right amen you think that isaiah understood what he was saying when he said a virgin shall conceive i wonder if he went back to his motel room and scratched his head so what i preached tonight they don't always understand everything right that's right human nature is that sometimes god will tell us things we don't always get it we don't always have the interpretation so brother adam as he studied this little trail of things how that god was opening up to him remember there was a prophecy given to him by vision of the lord that when the city drove that stake in front of his gated house turn yourself to the west all right i'd like to ask you where did billy graham have such words yes where did oral roberts have such a revelation right where did he allen or jack cole where did they have their visitations they were still concerned with healing ministry boy brother jack cohen died at 38 years old and and didn't have an opportunity hey allen went off the scene didn't have much of an opportunity but here you got the giants of the pentecostal revival of the ecumenical revival mr graham and mr roberts were those brothers at were they standing on the platform in california in 1977 when billy graham had over ten thousand people or a hundred thousand people rather sat in this auditorium did he wave his hand out before them and say sirs what is the time they had their ministry yes it had nothing to do about the hour we're living in but here this little humble hillbilly from kentucky he sees this vision of the angels of the lord and now something is stirring glory to god i feel the holy ghost something is strong on the inside of him yes he wants to know what hour we living in i'll challenge you to do a little study sometime start before the opening of the seals and watch brother bram say angel angel angel of the lord angel of the lord angel the lord angel the lord and watch him after he has that vision all of a sudden it changes and now every time he talks about it angels of the lord angels of the lord angels of the lord angels of the lord don't you know what it was it was prophecy right before your eyes jesus said the angels would come in the last time not the angel of the lord angels that's what jesus prophesied would be here in the last day that's the reason why this doctrine is so attacked that's the reason why they fuss about whether he was there or what he wasn't there you have different accounts about different men saying well you know brother branham said he wasn't there i think it was brother george smith said he was in texas trying to get a boy pardon what in the devil's that got to do with the price of tea in china he had the vision and after the vision was had when it was produced in life magazine brother brown nabbed it up and showed it to the people and said this is what i've been talking to you about it don't matter why he was there he wasn't there and i don't care if they say well it does matter it doesn't matter the vision of the lord produced itself later what he'd been telling the people on the platform years before that amen amen i said oh i i missile created that all right fine you go on and believe what you want to believe but i believe what i want to believe how about that amen right yes amen people can have their own opinions but the reason i'm not saying that now i'm trying to take jabs at nobody i'm not trying to throw anything out there to take jazz what i'm trying to say to you tonight church and all those that may listen to this i'm trying to say these words to you that it was not a rocket ship it was not a smoke cloud made out there by some kind of mechanical device but it was the prophecy of matthew chapter 13 that the angels of the lord would shut to settle out and gather in all of the saints of god and shove the wicked out to the outskirts they've done it the angels of the lord have power to separate amen amen they sure do i i love this even though they have power to separate us jesus said they would sever i love this in romans chapter 8 verse 38 the one thing they cannot do is he said i persuaded that neither death light nor angels can separate me from the love this in jesus name amen hallelujah praise the lord it lets us know brother sister that the angels of god had been given power of the last day now watch even in matthew chapter 16 verse 27 the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels in the coming of the lord matthew 24 and 31 he'll send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds one then of heaven to the other well last i checked that's exactly the same words paul referred to in first thessalonians chapter 4 when he said that god would descend with a shout a voice and a trumpet and then the dead in christ shall rise those which are unseen those which are seen will be brought together to meet the lord in the air amen exactly the prophecy of the lord right in the last day notice again now in matthew 25 and 31 are you with me say amen yeah amen amen are you having a hard time getting your job out of your lap i i know this is some powerful stuff now i i should have warned you about this gospel dynamite before i dug into it huh amen at least got you a blast shield on or something huh now watch here he said when the son of man shall come forth in his glory and all the holy angels with him i know that's not seven i know that's more than seven i realize all means all i'm not going to debate little points of scripture like that but i want you to see something that these angels of the lord that visited us in sunset mountain that visited brother branham that somehow a voice of god spoke out of this constellation and let brother branham know the time of the opening of the seals has come that was an appearing of the lord in the form of these angels that would just like your hand on the wall and the shadow and you take your hand that shadow and you just keep moving until you put them both together that was one little spot to let us know that god was doing a work until we meet all of it over here to the other side it was an appearing of the lord to get us ready for the coming of the lord amen amen and it was the coming of the lord amen sure it was to me it was the coming of the lord amen whenever jesus met me it was his coming he come and i'm still waiting hello somebody you gotta understand everything god does is spiritual and natural the angels of the lord are called of god to gather in the elect from the four winds why do you all reckon that we had a message like we had what god sent him around the world seven times on my dad yes to do what purpose because this message will gather the elect of god in don't forget that the angels of the lord are commissioned to sever away anything that won't walk with it in the right way amen don't kid yourself brother these angels of god have been commissioned to create circumstances to push you out if you're not going to be honest with god right and you say they don't have that kind of power i wish you would have said as far as you know i'd like to prove something to you if you'll let me do it can i do it yeah all right look here in revelation chapter 7 verse 1. the bible said after these things i saw four angels on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth and that the wind should not blow on the earth nor the sea nor on any tree and i saw another angel descending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea now watch even john is declaring that these angels of the lord have the power to hold back the winds of war right right anybody ever study world war one the great war do you understand the reason that the world world's war stopped at that first world war and i've been there to flanders field where the germans and uh in belgium there we walked down through the trenches where them boys would sit there they could just barely climb to get up over that trench and the germans were shooting right across that river it was right there in the field where the poppies come up where them boys got killed out there in that first war and how we went out there and they showed us that little video you know was they doing them sites like that and they show the trenches and to the stories of how the trenches were filled up with blood plum up to the knees all the angels of the lord what i had to do was allow that war to continue and that had been the end of humankind as we know it but there was an angel of god given a commission by god on the 11th month of the 11th hour on the 11th day step out there and stop every bit of it because there were some sons and daughters of god that had not received the holy ghost yet and god could have not allowed that it could not allow the apocalypse to take place while there was still some names on that spiritual book of god the lamb's book of life so these angels had the power are you with me to hold back the winds of war to stop a world war at a moment's notice and you think that they don't have the power to take somebody that's on the fence in church and kick them off it you think they don't have the power to create circumstances that if you are on the fence to help you walk over that threshold and come over and be a real christian that's right sure there i believe the angels of the lord have enough power that they have created and stirred up circumstances that helped you become a christian same way i believe angels of the lord position things in a manner to help people find the other way the exit amen you found the entrance other people find the exit i believe the angels of the lord create them circumstances surely i'd like to ask you a question what was it at that pool of bethesda that caused him waters to stir up there's an angel of the lord right you know we don't even have a background as to why god even did that we read the scripture we don't even really know by the same what the purpose of all that was but we do know this much that an angel of god would stir those waters and when he did if you get in them waters at that time you'd be healed in your body history records they stabbed each other done all kinds of meanness and things trying to get in that water before somebody else angels of the lord had that kind of power as a servant to be able to deliver unto people divine healing by stirring up a bunch of water and you think they don't know how to take a backslidden mossback church member that's sitting on the fence and creating circumstances to run them out all right right right that's what i'm trying to tell you a lot of the reason why our churches aren't as full as they are now i realize to be completely transparent we have been our own worst enemy in this message we cannot blame the baptist for our problems all right come on preach to me now we can't blame pentecost for our problems our problems been created by us amen that's exactly right now i'm not going to make excuses for these bunch of backslidden hypocrites around the message that have run off with piano players and stole church funds and on and on and on but i will say that part of the reason why not everybody and their brother flocks to this message is the angels of the lord won't let them don't forget it was the angels of god in eden that stood at the gate amen that still happens today good sure does now i agree that there's no guard over the tree of life whosoever will let him come i agree with that but don't stop don't don't don't stop in your mind to consider don't even entertain the idea don't even entertain it that god ain't got guards to keep people away from those things if you're not willing to serve the lord and do the right things and be the right kind of christian god will have a way something will come along your pathway that'll be that'll be your waterloo amen amen god uses these angels to create these circumstances good yes now i realize of course that that many of the critics around the world that that hear us talk about brother branham and people that don't think that brother brown was all that important to us i'm sure when they hear this kind of a sermon they think what is the benefit of what i'm telling you well it's very simple not to continue to point you back to william branham for 60 years he's been gone now since 1965 here we are in 2020 but what i'm trying to tell you is that god did something in this generation by those angels of the lord appearing he was letting us know what hour we were living in this is the gathering time of the saints of god you say why do we need to gather because jesus said where the carcass is right praise the lord amen notice again in revelation chapter 9 verse 14 there was an angel that had a trumpet that was given the commission to loose the four angels bound in the river euphrates we understand what those angels were eichmann mussolini hitler and stalin this angel of god have the power to release those anointings they understand the reason god was doing this is because israel was backslid backslid as a jew was out of their nation they're out of the will of god right any jew out of their home countries backslidden no matter how nice a person or how much they practice sabbath or how much they obey certain commandments the moment they leave israel they're backslidden yes sir yes sir my mom was talking tonight about this fella that says he knows what tribe he's from i said how can he moses and elijah ain't here then then god's little children them little israelites had 144 thousands scattered in every which direction and they don't know what their background is they don't know what their tribe is god allowed four of the cruelest men that's ever stepped forth in history allowed that angel of god to loosen that anointing that would move on those four men and those men drove israel back into their homeland what was it the angels of god given power just as these fallen angels were given the ability to drive israel back in how did it all begin an angel of the lord visited and loose this anointing my think about it when you look at the prophecy that daniel gives here my as he begins to set an established in his heart what's going on lord yes he wanted to know his very desire created activity in heaven amen what do you think happens whenever you desire to know that activity is created amen but don't don't fool yourself be careful if you really want to know what's true sometimes it might cause a separation yes sir i was repeating myself to make that point sometimes it might cause a separation yeah if you really want to know what the truth is it may mean you have to say goodbye to your mother for the rest of your life you may have to separate from your family and your kindred husbands and wives may have to go their separate ways we don't know what the answers are all the time if the angel of the lord has been given commission to gather and to sever the message of the hour once the revelations made known to us it will also cause separation in our lives yes from anything that's unlike the word amen amen my praise the lord now notice again that i i like how i like how paul says this now we talk about a woman in holiness okay and we say that a woman has to have you know uncut hair we say long but long as the terminology we use and what we mean is uncut yeah and whenever we look at why that a man has to have short hair and a woman has to have long hair i was laughing at your brother last week i knew for a haircut and i said i hope to god you don't throw me out of the bullpen can we just kidding i i but i said you know i said i didn't like the rest of fairians when i had the opportunity to go to jamaica and i got down and they had that long dreadlock down the back of their head you know that really looked like a woman that way but there was a reason that god said that a woman shouldn't cut her hair would you like to know what it is yeah read with me here in in first corinthians chapter 11 verse 10. there's a reason that god wanted that woman to keep her hair uncut i've heard sisters of uh of different walks of life they said well one lady told me she said well if i don't cut it it won't grow i said if you cut it you won't grow either spiritually at all right right so you got to figure do you want you want a long flowing hair you want a soul prospered in the presence of god there's a woman that cuts her hair and a man that's got long hair their prayers don't get through the roof unless they're repenting exactly right you say why brother ben well i'm gonna tell you watch for this cause first time ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels good good good so you realize that when isaiah sees the angels in the temple they have wings of their eyes wings over their feet wings on their back there's such a humility and service that when they come before the presence of god not only are they active that's what them wings on their back for that's what i said heaven is a metropolis it's not a bunch of people sitting in a barcelona with their feet kicked up taking the day off heaven is activity it's a busy place especially because you've got needs it keeps the angels busy all the time keeps god busy all the time but when an angel comes into the presence of the lord there is a level of humility it covers its face covers his feet and brother when paul's telling him that the woman's not supposed to cut her hair i'm not bashing sisters i'm just giving you a bible here yeah the reason they're not supposed to cut their hair is because of the angels in other words if you want to be humble have humility and show humility to the lord he said don't touch that hand don't put scissors in it don't trim it off we had girls number of years ago in manchester and i would grab it like this and rip it rip it rip it until they got all the dead ends out of it i said stop treating you glowy like that you have power on your head because of the angels did you notice he said you have power because of it which means that your prayer line to god all right right you can't go out here and cut the phone cord and then still be a quebec call right and some of y'all even know what a phone cord is don't change him and phone born in your life praise the lord but power on her head because of the angels because god amen was giving her a way to show her humility brother venom said it's god's crown of thorns today it's the crown of thorns for jesus when you wear that out there like that and people making fun of you and carrying on it's a crown of thorns for jesus christ in the last day now to show you that there's activity in heaven luke chapter 15 verse 10 likewise i say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god when over one sinner that repented amen so one sinner coming to god and it starts an angelic revival hallelujah they start having a worship session when they hear sinners come to god activity in heaven not a bunch of barca lounges and people sit around twiddling their thumbs no that's the way we behave in church let me tell you something brother sister if that's the way they behave over there and we should mirror image that over here we come to the house of the lord we should have some joy about us don't be afraid to move yes honest to goodness i've seen people in church it's almost like if they moved an inch god was going to kill him he's waiting on you too you should mirror him instead come on amen you should mere image the look of it sure yes amen now watch us now even at the death of the lord jesus christ now do you believe that the angels of the lord was going to keep charge over jesus you believe that yes psalm chapter 91 9 and 11 he said he'd give his angels charge over jesus and david said he would not allow his holy one to see corruption now to show you the power of the angels and the protection of the angels of the lord i want you to think about something here jesus's body is laying in the grave all right his soul is entered into the regions of the lost and he's down there taking satan's keys from his house right if one of them roman soldiers would have had corona and would they say that corona's got tentacles on the outside of it if one of them coronaviruses would have come even near the body of jesus christ the bible tells us in luke 24 23 and also tells us in john 20 and 12 that there were two angels standing by the body of jesus and satan would have tried to defile that holy body of jesus i believe one of them angels of the lord would have unsheathed their sword and cut the tentacles off corona all right his body could not be perverted his body could not be corrupted come on his body could not be molested in any way whatsoever there's no way that we could have been cannibals in ada's body all right the angels of the lord were set at the head in the pigs i'm going to ask you a question if you say well praise the lord it wasn't no cloud in arizona all right hold on when jesus appears on the earth for 40 days he gets ready to go out of here he takes a bunch of them up to the hillside 500 of them to be exact and as jesus is beginning to stand on the hillside his body takes control over gravitation and he tells gravity i'm in charge now and like superman it's where they get these ideas from from the bible that's right he flies up into the heavens could you imagine this being 500 standing there watching jesus enter now what happens the bible says that the angels of the lord swept him out of the cloud he said the way he goes will be the way that he comes back what do we see what are we laying our eyes on what jesus prophesied that the angels of the lord hallelujah would appear again in the last day to do what revealed jesus christ and the coming of the lord the message of the hours to get us ready for the coming of the lord lutheran these guys didn't have this billy graham didn't have this amen well roberts didn't have this yes why is it beneficial for us because the scripture of what jesus prophesied would be here amen amen i like that now notice again oh praise the lord now you say do i have an angel well i'm glad you asked matthew chapter 18 verse 10 take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven so you've got somebody watching over you amen now if they've been given the power to settle and gather what do you all reckon happen sometimes whenever you should have made a left turn and somehow another you made a right turn you may not have it in your brain what's taking place but it might be that an angel of the lord saul there's trouble down that way and he just diverted your pathway down another direction oh you said it's ridiculous angels don't do things like that really ask balaam yeah uh-huh ask moses because you remember an angel of the lord was waiting to kill moses because he didn't circumcise gerson god permitted that little high-tempered wife of his to take a stone and hack him up and throw the foreskin down and said you're a bloody husband but an angel of the lord was waiting there to take moses life sure was remember that's why the donkey got mad or that balaam got mad at the donkey rather remember matter of fact he hit that old donkey yelled at him slapped at him cussed him probably or said a few choice words or some kind of thing he knows not knowing that that little animal was sensitive to the fact that the angel of god was waiting down there you remember the time of david that destruction was taking place on the earth and great wars and loss of life and there was an angel standing there with the threshers blade in his hand at that particular time you remember the holy spirit would come down he said in the form of an of an incorn to seal the servants of god now listen when your faith is acceptable to god he sends the angel of the lord down to seal your soul with the baptism of the holy ghost amen amen they deliver the holy ghost to you amen friends i wonder let me just use this as an example like this is an acorn i wonder how many times the holy ghost has come into our services and got almost ready to do something for somebody and they just had their attitude and they just took it back right i wonder how many times holy ghost went to go touch them with that in corn and seal them with the baptism the holy ghost but because of their attitude because of their faith or lack of the holy spirit just had to withdraw himself that angel of the lord could not usher in the need of that body simply because of that person that individual simply because their attitude was so rotten god couldn't do it you know why people aren't getting sealed by the holy ghost they're grieving the angel of the lord yes like i said when you come to church always be ready to say amen amen always be ready to participate don't be spectators be participators there's a difference because if the angel of the lord is here maybe tonight would be your night of great deliverance maybe god would want to deliver something unto you but when it comes to your pew you're half asleep you understand what i'm saying all right brother you got your mind on the taxes reminded some other kind of thing and instead of keeping your mind on the lord so god could do something for you oh god i wonder how many times have i grieved away the angel of the lord because i let my mind wander just a moment oh you say it can't happen hold on in a prayer line one time brother bottom said i was getting ready to call a man he was on crutches or something of that nature he said about the time i was going to call him you said a demon moved on him and convinced him to go to the bathroom he said that man missed his healing forever why the angel of the lord was in the camp to deliver healing you say do they do that you remember the story of the two women one of them come the prayer line had stomach trouble and the other one lived down the road or down the blonde next block or something from the other lady she had a cancer it said that morning she woke up and she's fellow hungry so she got her cup of coffee and scrambled a few eggs and ate that and drank that and that tasted pretty good turns out well that's all right so she made some bacon fried up some sausage maybe some done some grits or some other kind of thing you know and just had a good old-fashioned jubilee and she'd dawned on her i'm healed i'm healed she got up to run down the road to her friend down the road to tell her what the lord had done for her and she was over there shaking her sheet trying to find that cancer that had fallen off of her brother said what happened was the angel of the lord was passing through that neighborhood and brought healing to both of them amen yes sir i wonder how many times i've come into a church like this and find that your attitude is not that you're with the word you're not even interested in the bible interested in the message not even interested in god i wonder how many times the angel of the lord has taken note of that and created circumstances to drive you away from the house of god rather than drive you to it oh you say god don't do that really you should read the book of proverbs every now and then and just remind yourself of what god said he would do if you reject him too many times he said he would come back and laugh at your calamity we can only reject him so many times before he creates a circumstance to send us out right you say does the lord do it sure look at judas whenever he said a man that is the one that's going to betray me will dip his hand in the soft with me jesus give him an opportunity i'm giving you this the spot if you want a spot here's the cube as they dipped his hand on that sock all them disciples is it me is it me is it you is it me is it you and there's judah sitting right there the bible said suffer being ended and satan entered into the heart of judas and what did jesus say to him whatever you're going to do go do it quickly creating circumstances that's why you and i sitting here tonight if there's even a tinge or a touch of the holy ghost inside of you or me we ought to be the thankful most thankful person hallelujah we ought to be so grateful to god because it could be the exit instead of the entrance amen lord praise the lord notice in luke 16 22 that when the beggar died he was carried by the angels to abraham's bosom but the bible said the rich man also died and was buried where was his angels he didn't have no angels he'd already rejected god remember this night your soul is required of you because he rejected the lord he rejected everything that come with the lord don't fear little bride that hour is going to arrive maybe you'll come to death and the angels of the lord will be there to pack your soul across that river don't you worry don't you worry they'll be there with you they was with you in your birth they'll be with you in your death i always felt sorry in a way for poor little lazarus here the man had been dead four days and entered into a spiritual round you know he was one of the only ones that could have come back and told us what life looked like after death but he had a good revelation of it and here elijah's i always felt sorry for the poor fella because i wonder when he'd come up to that second go around and maybe all of a sudden he realized death was coming and he said oh here we go again i mean a man in that kind of condition he couldn't be afraid of it because he knows what the beyond was holding for yeah but the bible said the angels packed him away wonder if when it come time for him to die the second time around the angel said are you ready to go again amen you know the drill lazarus come on amen oh praise the lord that's right and notice that the spirit of god with the acorn in his hand is there to seal the servants of god brother bannon i'm closing just now but brother bannon was in his room one time praying and he started praying in german remember that he got up and opened up the door and looked down the hallway he thought was somebody else speaking that happened a couple times he realized it was him that night there was a girl that had hammers on the side of the road out there and and she was just cutting up in the back and they run a mic out back there to her you know years ago they'd have them hundreds of hundreds of foot cord and they could run them around and uh i know brother ernest fulcher used to preach with a hundred foot court and go all the way around the tent two or three times come back up so they run her might back there she was just to testify and brother i said now wait a minute so what time of day was that he said the very moment that i was praying in that german language that she was laying out there dying listen in his words he said let's perfect perhaps that her angel come to me asking for help let me tell you something brother if you wake up in the middle of the night and i'm on your heart don't ignore that perhaps my angel come to you asking for some help you say does that happen in the bible in romans chapter 8 the bible said that we will speak with utterance and groanings that we don't even understand ourselves and the spirit of god will intercede for us amen perhaps your angel would call me one night say hey pray for my buddy you need some help don't ever forsake the moves of god because you don't know what's behind it in another realm when daniel sees the angel closing now when he sees this angel gabriel show up it's his desire in his heart created that activity over there i've said this in a joking manner i don't mean to sound like i'm joking in the pulpit but i i i wondered when brother brown was walking up that road and the lord told him to throw up the rock i've often wondered if the story was only partially told that if maybe what the real story was perhaps them seven angels were sitting over there waiting for a cue god told them there's a certain time that you've got to break forth maybe he would say to them watch for that prophet to throw that rock in here that's your cue to take off we don't know why god does things but what i'm trying to tell you is when you set your heart to understand it creates activity in the dimension in another realm yeah notice mine in saint john chapter 1 51 he said unto him very very i say hereafter you shall see heaven open and angels ascending and descending upon the son of man we wonder ourself why would jesus even speak of such a thing that's an old testament doctrine but let me show you how naive we are sometimes i don't think we mean to be but we are here all the saints of god having a prayer meeting in the house when simon peter got locked up and while they're praying for god to release peter from prison the angel of the lord comes into the prison house you ever been to walmart and seen them doors go well there's peter when he's sitting in that prison house the angel lord comes in there he got these guards all around everything and angela just walked over and done that with them doors for peter peter walked right on out of the gate all right now here's the crazy thing he gets all the way up to the house where they're praying for peter and there's peter knocking at the door and they got scared to death thinking a ghost and showed up at their doorstep but remember when they prayed and asked god it created activity in that realm and before they even realized what they were doing the angel of the lord had already released peter right out of that prison cell remember what i told you this morning just because you don't feel the holy spirit when you're praying doesn't mean that there's not a recording angel taking your order amen because remember matthew 4 11 when he said angels minister that means as a person would wait on a table serving food and drink brother jesse one thing i've learned in my life and if i've learned anything i've learned this god is always paying attention to me those moments i think he ain't those moments he's overlooking or maybe he's off on a far journey like elijah told the band of mines he's not he knows the very end from the beginning he understands what me and you are all about that's why these angels of the lord have been commissioned to work with us and deal with us in the way they have so that we understand glory to god that his love and his grace surrounds us every day of our life amen amen amen oh praise the lord and i love this so much it's worthy do you realize the prophet said those angels could have stepped forward and said i am they were worthy yeah they wasn't born by sex desire they wasn't born in sin shaken iniquity they could have stepped forward and said i'm the worthy one you know why they didn't move because the book that was in question did not belong to angels it belonged to sons and daughters of god amen no matter what their worthiness might have been it wasn't their inheritance and whenever we come to that hour that we are a true overcomer clothed in white raiment jesus christ will take us before them holy angels and say these are the ones i was asking for when this book was spoken about the first time amen the lion had prevailed but here's the purchased possession of what i was asking about during the opening of the seals please god stand with me can you say praise the lord amen isn't it wonderful isn't it wonderful isn't it ame isn't it wonderful to be a christian american amen i'm looking for some activity now yes think about it brother baby said they don't go off on missions way out yonder he said that camp right here around the saints of god that means if you're having a bad day the angels of the lord know what's going on and they're carrying messages back to daddy you say do they well let's look at adoption for 10 seconds brother madam said that if your behavior is right somehow they get a message did you know what your son or daughter is doing but the brain said the angels of the lord did it he said do you know what she's doing she's doing oh he's a chip off the old block so just swells right out that's my boy that's my girl these angels of the lord are confessing they're witnessing back to god about your behavior on the earth remember them investigating angels investigated the earth for the purpose of judgment but some of these angels of god that are here and gathered around the elect today they're investigating your behavior to brag on you it makes me feel like i speak in german myself amen and i don't even know i think about how that the holy spirit then if he surrounds us like that and these angels of god are given reports who was it that told god that adam had fallen in the garden of eden the angels of the lord gave the report to him do you understand that the very same thing happens with you and i whenever we have a a problem let's just say it like this somebody just really lays you out you're too upset to pray you can't get the words out of your mouth you the standard stutter standard and stare but don't fear the angels of the lord have already taken the report back to papa they already know the circumstances they already know the situation and before you even had a chance to pray about it before you could compose yourself enough to even ask daddy about it angels of god had already sent the message off started helping my boy jesse yeah start helping my buddy start helping my sis start do something move on their behalf i want to tell you something that happened to me when i was a boy and this may not mean nothing to y'all but it did to me at the time when i was in school i was bullied terribly and i mean i was a pudgy little kid and and i wasn't athletic i'm a musician i'm not an athlete let me tell you something you could throw a football but i didn't play a piano [Laughter] oh i just throw it off but what i'm trying to say is i was never like athletic and these type of guys i mean i i participated in things and did okay when i did but i wasn't an athlete and i was bullied terribly and you know i i was just really really upset tore up in my spirit one day and i was sitting at the desk in school now you're all young and you meant do you know what bazooka candy of gum is bazooka you all know what bazooka is don't you it's got the little comic strips on the inside well i was sitting at one of the chairs like this and i had turned around and i was just sitting there kind of staring off and thinking about all the little bad things that had happened and how the scourge upset i was and i felt my arm brother jesse move like that underneath the desk i didn't move it i just felt it moved and when i arm moved like that i felt my fingers go like that when i did i fingered one of those papers sticking underneath one of the little metal pieces underneath the table somebody slid it in between one of them little spots and i just pulled it out like that and this may not mean nothing to me but when i pick that little bazooka wrapper up i was thinking god are you with me god do you even care god are you even paying attention and when i pick that little wrapper up and said stop worrying i've got angels surrounding you let me tell you something friend that may not mean nothing to you but god does things to let us know he's with us all the time he's with these pretty little girls he's with these little ones right here he's with the oldest amongst us the youngest emotions the middle age female white black red asian whatever your colors whatever your race whatever your background whatever your stream of life he watches every single one of us we are his children amen and he loves us from the bottom of his heart and he wants our good not our hurt he sends these angels of god to protect us what do you think it was that led you to the house of god oh you say daddy took me what do you think led daddy just keep chasing it back what they what do you think it was made a way for it to be an entrance not an exit the spirit of god sent angels of the lord to gather and to sever i guarantee you one thing i've seen it many times in services let somebody in the presence of the lord in the house of the lord let him get a little bit of an attitude i've seen it let them kindly not appreciate the services and appreciate the preacher or what's being said or whatever whatever and it's another i mean it's happens almost like clockwork it don't take no time at all things start happening events start happening in that person's life and we're not careful we have a tendency to judge that and say oh boy that god's getting them you don't know that maybe the angels of the lord were taking notice that they were not going to continue to serve god and by the authority that god invested in them started creating circumstances to give them an exit strategy this is why when we pray and we ask god to restore those what we should pray on top of that restoration is god if they're the ones that chose to go out give them a desire to choose to come back because if they're the ones that created this mess and they put themselves in a position where they didn't want to serve the lord i can't force them back into it we can reach out to him brother jesse we can talk with them we can put scriptures together we can show love we can show grace but at the end of the day if god's given an exit strategy there's nothing we can do to recover such things is that right i've watched it happen again and again in my ministry and and i i mean just my ministry just my preaching i've watched it happen in services i've conducted and been in service watch the holy ghost walk right up to a person's pew and almost grab them by the arm and pull them to the altar nearly look like a little expression come over their face or a little something happen all of a sudden that person in a month and things are happening one after that like lighting fireworks and then popping this thing that thing next thing you know what happened to so-and-so oh you didn't hear they quit but you know what's happening friends the angels of god are taking notes yes they'll gather some severe the rest yes sir god help us amen this is why brother brown said we ain't playing church it's a serious thing amen all right god bless you let's pray together father thank you for the word tonight what a privilege lord it's been to gather in the presence of the lord like this to be able to talk your word and speak on the things of the bible tonight oh we just love you so much father we appreciate everything you're doing for us and i commit the remainder of the service to your hands now give everybody lord every sick body heal every trouble of mine visit every person lord like faith those that are gathered here and i need your help lord jesus [Music] um [Music] once my soul [Music] me [Music] is [Music]
