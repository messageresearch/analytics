[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] when I come to myself I was out there
[0:05] with that little girl dancing
[0:08] but I guess I did it all right it was I
[0:11] sure felt awful good I had a lot of
[0:13] Victory after that
[0:17] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:19] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:22] this video is to teach about dancing
[0:25] from the Bible and show how God's
[0:28] Prophet brother Branham approved of
[0:30] dancing when it was done for the glory
[0:32] of God
[0:33] here's the outline for the video first
[0:36] we'll Define Dance by the Bible
[0:38] second we'll look at bible verses about
[0:41] dancing and also brother branham's two
[0:44] experiences where he talked about
[0:46] dancing in the spirit
[0:48] third we'll look at four reasons to
[0:50] dance
[0:51] and of course there could be more
[0:53] reasons
[0:54] and fourth we'll look at more points
[0:57] about dancing
[0:59] defining dance
[1:02] in the Hebrew the word dance means to
[1:04] twist to twirl it's number
[1:08] 2342 in the Hebrew Strong's Concordance
[1:13] it's the Hebrew word chol I'm not sure
[1:15] if I'm saying that right but I'll spell
[1:17] it c-h-u-l
[1:20] so we see how the word dance means to
[1:22] spin in a circle and of course we know
[1:25] the Holy Ghost would always keep us
[1:26] under control so this would be
[1:27] controlled spinning controlled twirling
[1:31] as a person rejoices in the Lord Jesus
[1:34] Christ
[1:35] and of course dancing is allowed it's
[1:38] permitted and it's commanded in Psalms
[1:41] 149 verses 1 through 5 and Psalms 150
[1:45] verses 1 through 6. Psalm 149 verse 3
[1:50] says let them praise His name in the
[1:52] dance the word let means allow allow
[1:55] them to praise the name of Jehovah in
[1:58] the dance and of course Jehovah the Old
[2:00] Testament is Jesus Christ of the new the
[2:03] word praise means to boast about one's
[2:05] accomplishments we twirl to rejoice in
[2:09] God's accomplishments
[2:10] and the word name means reputation fame
[2:13] or Glory
[2:14] so we dance or twirl to rejoice in God's
[2:18] accomplishments for his Fame for his
[2:21] glory and of course Jesus name means
[2:24] Jehovah is salvation the self-existing
[2:27] one is salvation is our deliverance
[2:31] Psalm 150 verse 4 says praise him with
[2:34] the timbrel the tambourine and dance
[2:38] praise him with the strained instruments
[2:39] and organs
[2:41] so chapter 149 says allow dance and then
[2:45] chapter 150 commands us to dance
[2:48] it says Praise Him in the dance
[2:51] so when we know we're dancing under
[2:53] leadership of the Holy Ghost we're
[2:55] obeying the command of God and God takes
[2:58] pleasure in our dancing that's from
[3:00] Psalm 149 verse 4.
[3:03] dancing is mentioned in verse 3 and then
[3:05] verse 4 says for the Lord there's
[3:08] Jehovah
[3:09] for Jehovah taketh pleasure in his
[3:11] people he will beautify the meek with
[3:14] salvation
[3:15] so we praise His name in the dance
[3:17] because the Lord takes pleasure in his
[3:19] people in other words the Lord is
[3:21] pleased when his people dance and
[3:22] rejoice about God's accomplishments or
[3:26] Jesus's accomplishments
[3:28] in the second section let's look at the
[3:30] Bible and brother Branham on Dancing
[3:34] friends the Bible uses the word Dance 26
[3:37] times 21 times in the Old Testament and
[3:40] five times in the New Testament of
[3:42] course there's Unholy dancing
[3:44] like in Exodus 32 verse 19 when Israel
[3:48] was dancing at the time when they made a
[3:50] malted calf of worship while the prophet
[3:52] was away and there's also the Unholy
[3:55] dancing of herodias's daughter on
[3:57] herod's birthday Matthew 14 verse 6.
[4:00] but of course there's also holy dancing
[4:02] or dance that praises the name of the
[4:04] Lord as brothers said the first record
[4:06] of dancing is Exodus 15 verse 20 when
[4:10] Miriam danced and led the women out to
[4:13] dance after Israel passed through the
[4:14] Red Sea and all their enemies and
[4:16] taskmasters were drowned in the Red Sea
[4:19] regarding brother Branham and dancing
[4:21] brother Branham said dancing is Victory
[4:24] brother random also said dancing takes
[4:27] the spirit of Joy the Holy Spirit of Joy
[4:30] brother random said this in the basis of
[4:31] Fellowship 1961 whether rain was talking
[4:35] about William Cowper and he said quote
[4:37] as soon as the inspiration left him when
[4:39] he was in there he wrote the song and
[4:41] when he was up in such a high key where
[4:43] people don't know nothing about it just
[4:45] to sing and shout and dance that's not
[4:48] in that's in the spirit all right but in
[4:50] the spirit of Joy end quote so let's
[4:52] listen to that quote and notice how
[4:54] brother Brandon said singing shouting
[4:56] and dancing is the spirit of Joy so each
[4:59] of us need to receive the Holy Spirit
[5:01] anointing of joy in order to sing shout
[5:03] and dance let's listen to the quote
[5:06] as soon as the inspiration left him when
[5:09] he was in there he wrote the song and
[5:10] when he was up in such a high key or
[5:13] people don't know nothing about just to
[5:15] sing and shout and dance that's not in
[5:18] that's in the spirit all right but the
[5:19] spirit of Joy see but when you raise up
[5:22] into them spheres that you know nothing
[5:23] ah see you can't explain that you just
[5:26] you have to just know it's there and
[5:28] that's all
[5:29] in 1952 I am the resurrection of Life
[5:32] brother said Miriam got in the spirit
[5:34] grabbed up a tambourine and went down
[5:36] the bank dancing if that ain't an
[5:39] old-fashioned Revival I don't know
[5:40] nothing about it Victory so there he
[5:42] described dancing as a sign of Victory
[5:45] let's listen to the quote
[5:48] Spirit grabbed up a tambourine and went
[5:51] out on the bank dancing
[5:54] kind of shocking isn't it
[5:56] dancing beating a family and the
[5:59] daughters of Israel followed her beating
[6:02] cameras and dancing in the
[6:05] that ain't an old-fashioned Revival I
[6:07] don't know nothing about it victory
[6:12] now let's listen to the two times
[6:13] brother Ram said he danced in the spirit
[6:16] here's the first quote it's from Christ
[6:18] 1955 February 21st and in the quote
[6:22] brother Brandon said he went among Full
[6:24] Gospel people heard them clap their
[6:26] hands and said my that's terrible so
[6:28] when brother Brandon first became a
[6:30] Christian he didn't have the victory he
[6:31] didn't have the understanding of dancing
[6:33] and clapping and shouting but God taught
[6:35] him because God is faithful to guide all
[6:37] of us into all truth remember the ram
[6:40] talked about he was preaching a New
[6:41] Year's Eve service at Branham Tabernacle
[6:44] and during an intermission a group of
[6:46] girls saying there's going to be a
[6:48] meeting in the air brother random first
[6:50] didn't like it and said he was sitting
[6:52] in the seat of the scornful but then he
[6:54] thought my where did Dancing ever come
[6:55] from and he thought of Miriam then
[6:58] brother Ram said well I thought the only
[7:00] thing is the matter with me I just ain't
[7:02] got enough Victory Maybe
[7:04] and then he said he started tapping his
[7:05] foot and before he knew it he was out
[7:07] there dancing on the floor near the girl
[7:10] who was dancing he said I guess I did it
[7:12] all right I sure fell awful good I had a
[7:16] lot of Victory after that let's listen
[7:17] to the quote
[7:19] one night I was having a meeting in my
[7:21] Tabernacle and they was having a
[7:24] a New Year's night
[7:26] watch
[7:28] and the Tabernacle now I was teaching on
[7:32] the second coming of Christ
[7:35] some young ladies wanted to beat some a
[7:38] little tin cans and things and they had
[7:41] a washboard with some symbols on it on
[7:44] their fingers they're playing on this
[7:45] washboard I guess you've seen the hook
[7:47] up and one of us go to play the piano
[7:51] and they started playing that song
[7:53] there's going to be a meeting in the air
[7:55] a sweet sweet by and bye
[7:59] uh I was sitting right there in my
[8:00] Tabernacle Baptist Church
[8:04] [Music]
[8:08] why did it have to do that so I'm I
[8:12] waited looked around to people and they
[8:14] looked up at me and I looked around
[8:17] I thought I'm a fundamentalist you
[8:19] couldn't show me that in the Bible nice
[8:22] this is a whole lot of things a lot of
[8:24] us fundamentalists don't know what's in
[8:26] there that's all so
[8:28] I looked around I thought my where did
[8:31] dance never come from
[8:34] so I just let it go like that so I uh
[8:38] isn't that terrible all right you're my
[8:40] Tabernacle this little lady out there
[8:43] just with her eyes closed just dancing
[8:46] around
[8:47] first thing you know up got another one
[8:49] starting I thought oh
[8:52] so then I began to rehearse in my mind
[8:55] at in the Bible they did dance
[8:58] and I thought when they dance what was
[9:00] it dancing was spoke of when did Pharaoh
[9:04] was pursuing Israel and all the enemy
[9:07] was drowning Marion picked up a
[9:08] tambourine began to beat the tambourine
[9:11] and begin to dance and all the daughters
[9:13] of Israel followed her dancing
[9:16] I thought well that is addiction
[9:19] and I read were David when the ark had
[9:22] been away so long and when he returned
[9:24] back why are you so happy you started
[9:27] dancing he had the victory
[9:30] well I thought the only things that
[9:32] matter the eyes they got enough Victory
[9:33] maybe
[9:34] a few minutes something happened now
[9:37] this might shock it when I come to
[9:39] myself I was out there with that little
[9:41] girl dancing
[9:41] [Music]
[9:47] the thing that I thought I wouldn't do I
[9:49] did
[9:50] and when I was I was never on a dance
[9:53] floor in my life
[9:55] but I guess I did it all right it was
[9:58] I sure felt awful good I had a lot of
[10:01] Victory after that so
[10:03] that would be all right and I
[10:05] and I got the music
[10:07] don't you believe God's in music
[10:09] certainly God is in music and he's in
[10:12] art
[10:15] the second time brother Branham said he
[10:17] danced was when he ran around a tree
[10:19] worshiping Jehovah because he saw
[10:21] Jehovah in everything in the wilderness
[10:23] this quote is from the resurrection of
[10:26] Lazarus 1950 he said I was way up in
[10:29] Colorado I'd go 70 miles back by
[10:31] horseback he said he saw the great eye
[10:34] of Jehovah through the crevice and The
[10:36] Rock he said I see you Jehovah looking
[10:38] through the sunset you heard the gray
[10:41] wolf holler he said the wild I love it
[10:44] he said I had set down my rifle I raised
[10:46] up my hand the tears running down my
[10:48] cheeks
[10:49] I begin to sing praises to God I got
[10:52] real happy and I run around and around
[10:54] the tree brother Branham said
[10:56] if somebody would have been out there
[10:57] they'd have thought I was out of the
[10:59] insane institution I didn't care what
[11:02] people thought God was all around and I
[11:04] was worshiping him like David who danced
[11:06] before the ark so brother Brown said
[11:08] happily running around a tree is equal
[11:11] to dancing in the spirit let's listen to
[11:13] the quote
[11:17] about four years ago I grew up in
[11:20] Colorado I go 70 miles back for
[11:23] horseback a little ranch out there where
[11:25] nobody goes way up on top of the grilled
[11:28] cheese just to be alone
[11:30] and all the I think Colorado rain was
[11:33] going through it was all over there they
[11:35] ever dreamed and the sun was setting
[11:37] down through the crevices of the Rocks
[11:39] over there
[11:47] oh my God
[11:49] 70 miles from the civilization I sit
[11:52] down here
[12:00] where there's nothing in nature that
[12:02] pulls out I love their gods in these
[12:04] nature look at the sunset just save once
[12:07] and watch how different things look when
[12:08] you get saved and look at God in his
[12:10] nature right there that's right oh my
[12:13] how wonderful how would I have to go
[12:16] down here and not run around and around
[12:18] and around the tree and shake my hands
[12:20] with somebody
[12:21] insane institution uh my boys
[12:33] I got real happy
[12:35] and I run around around the trees
[12:39] if somebody would have been out there
[12:43] they thought I was out of the insane
[12:45] institution
[12:57] and I was worshiping him on these Pages
[13:00] like David who danced before the Arkham
[13:07] so friends the Bible and brother Branham
[13:10] give us a license to dance in the spirit
[13:12] when the Holy Spirit of Joy comes upon
[13:15] us and the Bible said it gives God
[13:18] pleasure when we rejoice in his
[13:20] accomplishments
[13:22] let's look at four reasons to dance in
[13:24] the scripture and of course there could
[13:26] be more
[13:28] the first reason to dance is because you
[13:30] have been saved you've gone through
[13:32] justification and you've been baptized
[13:34] fully immersed in water calling on the
[13:37] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:39] of course we get this as an anti-type of
[13:42] when Israel passed through the Red Sea
[13:44] the Bible said they were baptized under
[13:46] Moses that was in First Corinthians
[13:48] chapter 10. of course we know we've been
[13:50] baptized into the Lord Jesus Christ in
[13:53] the New Testament according to Acts 2 38
[13:55] and so Israel going through the Red Sea
[13:58] and then dancing was a type or
[14:01] foreshadowing of what we should do when
[14:03] we get saved we come out of the world
[14:05] we're baptized in the name of the Lord
[14:07] Jesus Christ and Jesus forgives all of
[14:10] our past sins just like Israel's past
[14:13] task Masters and their entire sinful
[14:15] past was buried and done away with the
[14:18] Bible says we're buried with Christ and
[14:20] our sins are thrown in the sea of
[14:22] forgetfulness
[14:24] so whenever a genuine Christian gets
[14:26] saved they have a reason to dance
[14:28] and friends that go along with that the
[14:31] entire Gospel of Jesus Christ is like an
[14:33] unto dancing
[14:35] and that's in Matthew 11 verses 16
[14:37] through 19 Jesus said we have piped unto
[14:40] you and ye have not danced and so Jesus
[14:43] Likens that unto his ministry the gospel
[14:45] is good news it's good because it
[14:48] forgives all of our sins through the
[14:49] blood of Jesus Christ which should make
[14:51] us rejoice in Jesus's accomplishments
[14:54] then Jesus said in verse 17 we have
[14:56] mourn unto you and you have not lamented
[14:58] and he Likens that to John the Baptist
[15:01] ministry in Matthew 11 verse 18.
[15:05] before moving on to reason two brother
[15:07] Branham asked this question he said did
[15:09] you ever get that much Victory and so I
[15:12] want to ask our viewers did you ever get
[15:14] that much Victory to be like Miriam and
[15:17] dance before the Lord the SE is a great
[15:19] question we should all ask ourselves
[15:21] and God will reveal to us in his time
[15:24] and season about the freedom we have to
[15:26] dance and praise the Lord so let's
[15:29] listen to this quote from Believers thou
[15:30] this 1950 brotherhound talks about
[15:32] Israel passing to the Red Sea Miriam had
[15:35] the Victory and he says did you ever get
[15:37] that much so friends I hope you get that
[15:39] much let's listen to the quote
[15:44] he went dancing
[15:47] Hallelujah yes sir she had the victory
[15:50] do you ever get that much all right she
[15:54] was dancing in the spirit Hall with
[15:55] daughters of Israel followed her dancing
[15:57] Moses stood with his hands up and sang
[16:00] in the spirit
[16:02] the second reason to dance is that the
[16:04] word is in its place or position and
[16:07] this comes from second Samuel chapter
[16:09] six of course this is David bringing the
[16:12] ark into its position and the Bible said
[16:15] in second Samuel 6 14 and David danced
[16:18] before the Lord with all his might and
[16:20] David was girded with a linen ephod
[16:23] and then in verse 16 and as the Ark of
[16:25] the Lord came into the city of David
[16:27] McCall Saul's daughter looked through a
[16:29] window and saw King David leaping and
[16:32] dancing before the Lord and she despised
[16:34] him in her heart
[16:36] friends notice that David danced with
[16:38] all of his strength he leaped with all
[16:41] of his strength so that gives us the
[16:43] liberty as Christians to leap and dance
[16:45] and rejoice in God's accomplishments
[16:48] especially when we know the word has
[16:50] come into its place and position
[16:53] now in David's day the word got in its
[16:56] position in the city of God Jerusalem
[16:59] and David was rejoicing in that in fact
[17:02] the word hadn't been in the city of
[17:04] David or Jerusalem in about 890 years
[17:07] the last time the word was in that
[17:10] location was when Melchizedek met
[17:12] Abraham
[17:13] and of course God wasn't in the form of
[17:15] the Ark at that time God was in the form
[17:17] of a priest Melchizedek and then even
[17:20] 450 years before David danced when
[17:24] Joshua took the promised land they could
[17:26] never take Jerusalem if you read the
[17:28] book of Joshua it's in Joshua chapter 15
[17:31] verse 63
[17:33] the Bible says the children of Judah
[17:35] could not drive them out but the
[17:37] jebusites dwell with the children of
[17:39] Judah at Jerusalem unto this day
[17:41] so the presence of God was kept out of
[17:43] the city of God for over 890 years from
[17:46] the time of Abraham meeting Melchizedek
[17:49] all the way up to Joshua and then all
[17:51] the way to David but David became
[17:53] Prophet priest and King just like the
[17:55] Lord Jesus Christ was prophet priest and
[17:57] King and David brought the word into its
[18:00] position
[18:01] the word of God the prince of God in the
[18:04] city of God and it caused him to dance
[18:06] with all of his strength and friends
[18:07] that's what we should feel today
[18:09] the word of God the Holy Ghost the
[18:11] pillar of fire is with the people of God
[18:14] because the mystery of God has been
[18:15] finished according to Revelation 10
[18:17] verse 7. the hearts of the children have
[18:19] been turned back to the hearts of the
[18:21] apostolic fathers according to Malachi 4
[18:23] verses 5 and 6. the mysteries of God all
[18:27] 12 mysteries of God have been finished
[18:28] by Brother Branham and brother Branham
[18:30] has given us so many thus say the Lord's
[18:32] statements about prophecy Doctrine and
[18:35] teaching that we can Rejoice like David
[18:37] today the word has found its position
[18:40] the word has found its place in the
[18:42] Heart of Jesus Christ's bride and this
[18:45] is the bride that's all around the world
[18:48] also one more important thing to note
[18:50] about this reason it's second Samuel 6
[18:52] 22 David was talking to McCall and said
[18:55] I will yet be more vile than thus and
[18:57] will be based in my known sight and of
[18:59] the maid service which thou spoken of of
[19:01] them shall I be had in honor
[19:03] notice David says he would dance again
[19:06] so this proves that we can have planned
[19:09] out dance Services dancing does not have
[19:12] to always be spontaneous we can know
[19:15] we're going to dance for the Lord just
[19:16] like we can know we're going to sing a
[19:18] song Special by the holy spirit's
[19:19] leading or just like a preacher knows I
[19:21] know I'm going to preach the word of the
[19:23] Lord this inspired thought at this
[19:25] particular time
[19:26] and also brother Randolph said while
[19:28] David was dancing before the Lord he
[19:30] said God looked down from heaven
[19:32] and was proud of his son and he said
[19:35] David you're a man after my own heart
[19:37] this goes from preparation November 11
[19:40] 1953. let's listen to the quote
[19:43] or he said you don't want to stand here
[19:45] and watch this and round and round and
[19:46] round
[19:53] yes sir
[19:55] I said watch this
[19:57] [Music]
[20:04] amen
[20:08] [Music]
[20:17] a third reason to dance is that God has
[20:20] rebuilt your life and given you a new
[20:23] season to dance this is found in
[20:26] Ecclesiastes 3 verse 4 a time to weep
[20:29] and a time to laugh a time to mourn and
[20:32] a time to dance so notice friends there
[20:35] are seasons of mourning we lose loved
[20:37] ones we go through sickness we go
[20:39] through fiery Trials of our faith but
[20:41] once we come out of those Seasons then
[20:43] it's time to dance and rejoice and boast
[20:46] on Jesus's accomplishments
[20:48] also Jeremiah 31 verses 1 to 4 is a
[20:52] powerful portion of scripture where God
[20:55] promised he would rebuild Israel and
[20:58] then she would dance
[20:59] so again dance is connected to Victory
[21:02] and joy and strength for the joy of the
[21:05] Lord is our strength
[21:07] notice in Jeremiah 31 3 the Lord hath
[21:09] appeared of old unto me saying yea I
[21:12] love thee with an everlasting love
[21:14] therefore with loving-kindness have I
[21:16] drawn thee and friends God loves the
[21:18] Bride of Jesus Christ as well that is
[21:21] clear according to many scriptures but
[21:22] also Romans 9 25 and 26 the Gentiles are
[21:27] called My People by God and in verse 25
[21:30] we're called beloved
[21:33] the Bride of Jesus Christ is the Beloved
[21:35] bride of Christ and then we're called
[21:37] Children of the Living God in Romans 9
[21:40] 26 so just as God loved Israel God loves
[21:44] the New Testament bride of Jesus Christ
[21:46] then Jeremiah 31 verse 4 says again I
[21:49] will build thee and thou shalt be Bill o
[21:51] Virgin of Israel Thou shalt again be
[21:54] adorned with thy tablets they're
[21:56] tambourines and shalt go forth in the
[21:59] dances of them that make Merry so
[22:01] friends we all have a promise when we
[22:03] feel like our life is being broken down
[22:06] or destroyed God promises to build us
[22:08] back up so we can dance for him to boast
[22:12] on his accomplishments and his seasons
[22:14] in our lives to bring us victory
[22:17] David also wrote about this new season
[22:19] of Dance in Psalm 30 verses 1 and then
[22:23] 10 through 12. David said thou Has
[22:25] Lifted Me Up in verse 1 and then in
[22:28] verse 10 he said God was his helper and
[22:31] then in verse 11 he said thou is turn me
[22:33] for my morning into dancing verse 12 to
[22:37] the end that my glory may sing praise to
[22:40] thee and be not silent
[22:42] so God even gave David scenes of
[22:45] rejoicing seasons of Dancing friends God
[22:48] will turn our season from mourning into
[22:51] dancing
[22:52] the fourth reason to dance is to be like
[22:55] Jesus when he was in the logos form
[22:58] this may be a new thought for some of
[23:00] you but I found this in the scripture in
[23:02] Proverbs chapter 8 verses 22 and 30 the
[23:06] Bible said Jesus in the spirit form of
[23:09] the logos was like the wisdom of God
[23:11] before the foundation of the world and
[23:13] then in verse 30 it says then I was by
[23:16] him as one brought up with him and I was
[23:18] daily his Delight rejoicing always
[23:20] before him friends this word play in the
[23:23] Hebrew means to play music singing
[23:27] dancing so here we see the pillar of
[23:29] Fire or the logos dancing before the
[23:32] invisible spirit before the foundation
[23:34] of the world and of course brother
[23:36] Branham taught this in questions and
[23:38] answers on Genesis 19 53 and other
[23:41] places
[23:43] he quotes Saint John 1 verse 1 in the
[23:45] beginning was the word remember the ram
[23:47] says that word was like a little Halo he
[23:51] said now that's the Son of God the logos
[23:53] now I can see him playing around like a
[23:55] little child before the father's door
[23:57] with all eternity let's listen to the
[23:59] quote
[24:00] now in Saint John 1 he said in the
[24:03] beginning was the word
[24:05] one of the first and the Word was God
[24:10] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[24:13] Among Us
[24:15] God unfolding himself down
[24:19] to a human being Now watch how he did it
[24:23] now back there then when this little
[24:25] Halo comes out we can't see nothing yet
[24:27] but just by eyes of just Supernatural we
[24:31] see a Halo standing out that's the Son
[24:33] of God the Lord gods
[24:35] now
[24:36] I can see playing around like a little
[24:38] child before the father's door with all
[24:41] eternities
[24:43] and I then in his imaginary makeup he
[24:47] began to think of what things would be
[24:49] and I can hear him say
[24:51] let there be light
[24:55] so friends Jesus was the first non-human
[24:58] dancer he was the first Supernatural
[25:00] Divine dancer so just like shouting
[25:03] religion happened at the foundation of
[25:04] the world according to job dancing
[25:06] started before the foundation of the
[25:08] world the logos danced before the
[25:10] invisible father
[25:12] so where do we learn to dance from our
[25:14] husband the Lord Jesus Christ of course
[25:17] if you have time read that entire
[25:18] passage Proverbs 8 23-30
[25:22] and if people need more evidence of that
[25:24] you could read Song of Solomon 2 verse
[25:26] 8. and of course this is the shulamite
[25:29] rejoicing over Solomon and Solomon was
[25:31] the son of David he was a pre-figure of
[25:34] the Lord Jesus Christ and here the Bible
[25:36] says Solomon was skipping and that
[25:38] reminds us of brother random skipping or
[25:40] running around the tree in Colorado
[25:42] worshiping Jehovah
[25:44] Song of Solomon 2 verse 8 says the voice
[25:46] of my beloved behold he cometh leaping
[25:48] upon the mountains skipping upon the
[25:51] Hills
[25:52] so we see skipping is the same as
[25:53] brother random running around a tree
[25:55] it's playing before the Lord It's
[25:57] rejoicing before the Lord as the Bible
[25:59] says
[26:00] so there's two witnesses that Jesus
[26:02] Christ was the first dancer and
[26:04] continues to dance and rejoice
[26:07] and this reminds us of Zephaniah 3 verse
[26:09] 17 the Lord thy God is in the midst of
[26:12] thee is mighty he will save thee he will
[26:15] rejoice over thee with joy so God
[26:18] rejoices over his children with joy he
[26:20] will rest in his love he will Joy over
[26:22] thee with singing so either God is
[26:25] singing or he's having the angel sing
[26:26] over his people and remember he called
[26:28] his bride his beloved
[26:31] now I also have a fifth reason to dance
[26:33] and I'm sorry I only said four at the
[26:34] beginning but it doesn't matter those
[26:36] that are Faithfully listening will get
[26:38] another benefit of having another reason
[26:40] to dance and of course there's more than
[26:41] five when we dance we finally join the
[26:44] rest of Creation in their spinning
[26:46] twirling and dancing
[26:49] this is according to Psalm 148 verse 3 4
[26:52] 5 and also Psalm 65 verse 13.
[26:57] the Bible says praise ye him sun and
[26:59] moon praise him all ye stars of light
[27:02] Praise Him ye heavens of heavens and ye
[27:04] Waters that are above the heavens let
[27:06] them praise the name of the Lord for he
[27:08] commandeth and they were created
[27:10] in Psalm 65 13 the pastors are clothed
[27:13] with flocks The Valleys also are covered
[27:16] over with corn they shout for Joy they
[27:18] also sing
[27:20] so friends the Bible tells us all
[27:22] creation glorifies God all of creation
[27:25] shouts for joy and sing unto the Lord
[27:28] and in particular the moon and the
[27:30] planet spin they spin in their orbits
[27:33] according to the Bible
[27:34] says the planets spin what are they
[27:37] doing they're dancing and glorifying the
[27:39] lord they're declaring the glory of God
[27:42] as the Bible says
[27:43] David said in Psalm 19 verse 1 the
[27:46] heavens declare the glory of God and the
[27:48] firmament showeth his handiwork
[27:52] so when we dance we join the Heavenly
[27:54] hosts the planets in their spiral
[27:56] twirling orbits we shout for Joy just
[27:59] like the mountains The Valleys the
[28:01] flocks the birds the trees we even
[28:04] joined the cherubims in heaven saying
[28:06] holy holy holy
[28:08] fulfilling Jesus prayer let it be done
[28:10] on Earth as it is in heaven
[28:13] and friends this topic could go on and
[28:14] on even in Ezekiel chapter 1 and 2 God
[28:18] looked like he was a wheel as in the
[28:20] middle of a wheel and what does a wheel
[28:21] do it turns and Spins and Twirls and
[28:25] that lines up with how Jesus played and
[28:27] danced before the father in Proverbs
[28:29] chapter 8 and Solomon skipped upon the
[28:32] hills according to Song of Solomon
[28:33] chapter 2 verse 8.
[28:37] for the fourth section we'll talk about
[28:38] more points or truths about dancing
[28:42] first Jesus will always stand up for you
[28:45] when you Worship in the Holy Spirit
[28:48] in Matthew 21 14-16 the children were
[28:51] crying out Hosanna to the son of David
[28:54] and Jesus said out of the mouth of babes
[28:56] and sucklings thou has perfected praise
[28:58] the Bible said the children were crying
[29:00] out so notice Jesus didn't tell the
[29:02] children to be quiet Jesus said they've
[29:04] got to cry out if they don't cry out
[29:05] even the stones will cry out so Jesus
[29:08] stood up for worshipers
[29:10] we also see a parallel passage of that
[29:12] in Luke 19 35-40.
[29:15] then moving on to Mark 14 verses 3
[29:17] through 10 Mary lazarus's sister
[29:20] anointed him and Judas complained and
[29:24] Jesus said let her alone
[29:26] so Jesus told Satan in Judas is scared
[29:29] leave Mary alone Jesus has always and
[29:33] will always protect the oil and the wine
[29:35] and so we should do what we can to
[29:38] Worship the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:40] and of course we have that promise from
[29:42] the third seal Revelation chapter 6 The
[29:46] Voice in the midst of the beast in verse
[29:48] 6 says see thou hurt not the oil and the
[29:51] wine
[29:52] to the Lord Jesus Christ will always
[29:54] protect the oil the baptism of the Holy
[29:56] Ghost and the wine the stimulation or
[29:58] joy of the Holy Ghost
[30:00] and we also know oil wine is the healing
[30:03] prescription as seen in Jesus parable of
[30:07] the Good Samaritan that's found in Luke
[30:09] chapter 10 verse 34 we get the
[30:12] understanding when religion and legalism
[30:14] or lasciviousness leaves worshipers half
[30:17] dead like in the parable the oil wine is
[30:20] the only healing prescription the
[30:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost the joy of
[30:24] stimulation of Revelation and where are
[30:26] you going to find that you're going to
[30:27] find that in the message of the hour the
[30:30] present truth as Peter says
[30:31] you're going to find it as the Bible
[30:33] said in Matthew 17 11 Elias will restore
[30:37] all things brother branham's anointing
[30:39] of the spirit of Elijah upon him will
[30:41] restore all things brother Adam's
[30:43] Ministry restored the Bible the Gospel
[30:45] of Jesus Christ
[30:47] second point is that Jesus specializes
[30:50] in changing seasons or turning the page
[30:53] in our lives
[30:54] there's so many examples Mary Magdalene
[30:57] Zacchaeus Lazarus but the Bible said he
[31:00] would do this in Isaiah 61 verses 1
[31:03] through 3 the Bible said Jesus preached
[31:06] Good Tidings the Brokenhearted would be
[31:08] bound up and healed he would Proclaim
[31:11] Liberty to the captives that's what we
[31:13] have today Liberty in Christ Jesus
[31:16] opening of the prison to them that are
[31:18] bound
[31:19] and going down to verse 3 he gives us
[31:21] Beauty for our ashes
[31:22] oil of joy for our mourning a garma of
[31:25] praise for the spirit of heaviness
[31:28] so we cast down depression we cast down
[31:30] doubt discouragement and we receive the
[31:32] anointing of Joys brother Branham said
[31:35] the Bible calls it the Garment of Praise
[31:37] so he prays we shout we dance we stomp
[31:40] we clap we glorify Jesus Christ we brag
[31:43] on Jesus Christ's accomplishments
[31:46] third point is that clapping and
[31:48] shouting is triumph that's in Psalms 47
[31:51] verses 1 and 2 oh clap your hands all
[31:54] you people shout unto God with the voice
[31:56] of Triumph
[31:58] third point is that God can only use
[32:00] dancing when we have both dancing and
[32:03] agonizing in prayer so again it goes
[32:06] back to that scripture from Ecclesiastes
[32:08] we have to have both seasons in our
[32:09] lives we have to have seasons of
[32:11] mourning and then seasons of dancing and
[32:14] brother Brown clearly teaches this in
[32:15] 1958 the sermon is called the evidence
[32:18] of the Resurrection brother said I
[32:20] believe in every bit of that dancing and
[32:22] shouting but if we have that and don't
[32:24] have that agonizing weeping broke up
[32:26] Spirit God can never use that of course
[32:29] this ties in with Ezekiel 9 verse 4 God
[32:32] only marks or seals with the Holy Ghost
[32:34] them who sigh and cry for the
[32:36] Abominations done in the city let's
[32:38] listen to the quote from 1958.
[32:41] our hearts are too cold
[32:44] cold we become
[32:47] in we become interested if if we can say
[32:50] if we can shout I believe in it
[32:53] if we can speak with tongues I believe
[32:55] in it
[32:56] I believe in every bit of that but if we
[32:59] have that and don't have that agonizing
[33:04] weeping broke up serious God can never
[33:07] use it
[33:09] foreign
[33:11] things are good
[33:14] but we got to have the other to go with
[33:16] it
[33:17] we've left off the main thing I'm gone
[33:20] first secondarily and you can never
[33:23] major on a minor
[33:27] the fourth point is that sin stops the
[33:29] dance if a person's not in the season of
[33:32] mourning
[33:33] this is found in Lamentations chapter 5
[33:35] verses 14 through 16. the Bible said the
[33:38] elders ceased the young men cease from
[33:41] their music The Joy sees the dance was
[33:44] turned into mourning the crown has
[33:46] fallen why we have sinned the Bible says
[33:50] so many people in message churches or
[33:52] any church the reason they don't dance
[33:54] is because they're letting sin reign in
[33:56] their lives and they haven't confessed
[33:58] their sin they're living with complexes
[34:00] and so if we want to see the dance
[34:02] restored in our life
[34:04] and it's God's season for us to dance
[34:05] but we're living in sin all we need to
[34:07] do is go confess our sins and God will
[34:10] restore our joy the spirit of joy to
[34:13] dance for Jesus Christ
[34:16] in closing
[34:18] friends I hope this video has been a
[34:19] blessing you know at the end of 2022 the
[34:22] Lord started dealing with me on the
[34:24] dance topic and it has just
[34:25] revolutionized My Worship
[34:27] now in our church and other churches I
[34:30] preach at will have dance Services we'll
[34:32] dance and praise the Lord and it's been
[34:34] a wonderful time of glorifying the Lord
[34:37] Jesus Christ bragging on Jesus's
[34:39] accomplishments rejoicing in what he has
[34:42] done for us
[34:44] and of course there's so much more to
[34:45] this topic I can't cover it I think I
[34:47] preached over eight or nine sermons on
[34:49] this series
[34:51] but I want to get this video out I hope
[34:52] it'd be a blessing to God's people
[34:55] so if you have any questions concerns or
[34:57] testimonies about this video please
[34:59] email me
[35:01] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[35:03] the desire of your heart
[35:05] foreign
