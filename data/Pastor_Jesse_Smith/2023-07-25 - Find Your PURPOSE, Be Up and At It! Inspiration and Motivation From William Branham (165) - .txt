TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I I like a man of vision I like people it's got something they're fighting for I think every Christian ought to be that way find your purpose and go do it oh feet up and at it Green's friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to provide some Holy Ghost inspiration and motivation for you to have a purpose in life find your purpose in life and go do it I'm going to use two simple quotes from Brother Branham the first is doors in a door 1965 and the second is taking sides of Jesus 1962. I love these quotes they meant so much to me over the years otherwise speaking of Abraham Lincoln he said he was deprived of an education yet he had something in his heart some purpose and Friends whatever you're deprived of whatever challenges you might face I want to encourage you God has a purpose God's place his purpose in your heart and of course that purpose will line up with the word of God then brother random says I like a man of vision he likes people that have something they're fighting for and they just don't lay around so friends let's have a vision let's have something we're fighting for let's not lay around he says oh be up and at it brother Brandon said I think every Christian ought to be that way find a purpose and go do it if there's a Revival in town he said the Revival is there for a purpose let's get something out of it let's do something about it and then brother random encourages the preachers and taking sides with Jesus you're men of God with a calling in your life you can be doing something don't just sit around do something if you can only get one Soul saved get that one saved each one of us and Friends these quotes have meant so much to me over the years have been pastoring 17 years I normally preach two three four sometimes five times a week and these quotes have meant a lot to me they've been a great source of inspiration and motivation they keep me encouraged when I get tired or worn out they've encouraged me to finish writing my two books finish editing all the podcasts and videos because I believe that's my purpose in life to teach and strengthen the Bride of Jesus Christ in my humble little way so enjoy these quotes and I hope you'll replay this video over and over again as a source of inspiration and motivation from Brother Branham but of course it's the Holy Ghost through brother Branham God bless you some time ago it was uh read a story of uh the days of our Noble uh one of the greatest presidents I think the nation ever had but was was Lincoln not because he come from Kentucky but because he was a great man he was uh deprived of an education but yet with something in his heart some purpose I I like a man of vision I like people it's got something they're fighting for just not just stay around well what comes along will be all right oh be up and at it and Lincoln never let his education stand in the way he had something to do I think every Christian ought to be that way find your purpose and go do it every member of this chapter just thought well we have a breakfast once a month that isn't it or once every Saturday have a purpose in life something you're going to do let's not just place you here do something about it every member of every Church there's a revolvement town that Revival's there forever let's get something out of it let's do something about it there's brother what's his name back there tonight the the Evangelist setting back our brother uh JT Parnell brother Beeler latest brother setting here some of many of you are a man of God calling in your life you can be doing something this don't sit around let's do something you don't get for one Soul save get that one saved each one of us
