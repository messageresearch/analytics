Description:
In April 2022, an anti-Message YouTube video series accused William Branham of plagiarizing his teaching on the Seven Seals from Charles Taze Russell and Clarence Larkin. This podcast proves this accusation is false through numerous citations from the books of Russell and Larkin. 

Brother Branham's only Seal teaching that closely matched Russell or Larkin was the Sixth Seal, which matched Larkin. But Brother Branham never claimed his teaching was not from Larkin during the Sixth Seal sermon. Brother Branham was transparent that he was reading many books during the Seven Seals series. Then in July 1964, Brother Branham shared that he had read Larkin work about the Book of Revelation. This proves Brother Branham did not plagiarize Larkin, nor Russell. 

The final conclusion is that Brother Branham did receive daily, divine visitations from the Holy Ghost as he preached the Seven Seals. Brother Branham's accusers are either honest, deceived, and lazy researchers, or they are dishonest deceivers trying to purposely destroy the godly character of God's prophet, William Branham. We will pray for their correction and genuine repentance.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] god bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast i'm your co-host pastor jesse smith our other co-host brother amen lee isn't available for this recording as he has some responsibilities he had to attend to so i'll be hosting solo on this episode i felt an urgency to record and release this podcast as quickly as possible in response to the latest attack against the character of god's prophet brother william branham today's topic is defending the revelation of the seven seals that god gave to his prophet brother william branham and i'll also briefly defend brother william branham's revelation from the lord jesus regarding the seven church ages i'll begin with the recent accusation that has been made against brother william branham a youtube video series was released between april 4th and 18th 2022 and it claimed brother branham stole his teachings about the seven seals from clarence larkin and charles tays russell of course this accusation is false but first here's a short background about both men larkin was a baptist minister who lived from 1850 to 1924 and has some beautifully illustrated bible teaching books available and it seems he had quite a bit of revelation from the lord regarding the book of revelation and numerous other topics such as daniel 70 weeks and some of these thoughts brother branham used like the dates of the seven church ages and the seven-fold glory of jesus christ in revelation chapter one brother branham referenced larkin on numerous occasions most notably in the feast of trumpets 1964. let's listen to the quote i'm just leaving it at that and presuming after a while we'd preach on the seals not knowing what the seals was i had my own idea as every minister does of reading maybe what other man had said and believing as much as i possible with them on the things that they had brought up their conclusion uh i'd read the book of mr smith yuri smith which is the adventist teacher and um i'd read his uh his thoughts on it and i'd read mr larkin i'd read all so many different ones of their commentaries on this but uh somehow or other i thought i had a little view of it myself that might be if a place is different and brother brandon even said he was thankful for larkin's views when he preached the 70th week of daniel and again brother brahm used numerous thoughts from larkin regarding the 70 weeks of daniel let's listen to the quote men trying to explain what these 70 weeks were i've read many of their commentaries on them and uh i'm very grateful to mr smith of the adventist church for his views i'm very grateful to dr larkin of his views i'm grateful to all these great scholars for their views on this and in reading them it enlightens me much that i can find places that looks right but to get the views that i i thought that i would like to explain uh search through the encyclopedia of time to find out what time meant now regarding both larkin and russell i don't know what their eternal destination is only god knows that but it seems with larkin it seems his life was free from scandal which is different from russell and so now get into charles tays russell he lived from 1852 to 1916 he was the founder of what would become the jehovah's witnesses i haven't studied extensively on russell but it appears he was a false prophet having multiple failed prophecies it's notable though that he did have some genuine revelations such as non-eternal hell and the three-person trinity doctrine being a false doctrine back to the accusation against brother branham so far we've not seen a video accusing brother branham on his teachings regarding the seventh seal but i'll be ready to respond shortly after it's released lord willing if it does come out i'm purposely not going to mention the names of brother brahms accusers because this is not a personal attack on them sometimes i've done that during my sermons and if i said anything false then i publicly apologize for the statements that i made but here in this podcast i just want to keep names out of it before getting into the seven seals i just want to put a humble plug in here because some of my other videos that are related to these types of subjects might help you just in case you're not aware of them i'd imagine you're interested in these subjects since you're listening to this podcast as we defend the message and ministry of brother william branham on my youtube channel i've got a hour-long video about larkin comparing larkin's teachings with brother branham's proving brother brahm did not plagiarize larkin brother branham referenced numerous preachers many preachers and the video fully proves that now it does seem brother branham forgot to reference larkin on the future home which he used at least eight of his teachings but again brother branham's main emphasis in that sermon was about the three works of grace how the earth has to go through three works to purify itself just as the believer has to go through three works of grace to bring his life to a completion and of course larkin did not teach the three works of grace according to my studies so please anyone correct me if i'm wrong enlighten me if i'm wrong on any of these facts also i recently published a video about the brown bear vision and in that video also i gave brief responses to other accusations against brother branham such as the tent vision the vision of the three hundred thousand and one meeting the ohio river municipal bridge vision the seven major visions of 1933 and the arizona cloud from february 28 1963 and there's numerous other videos i put out defending brother branham his ministry his teachings and his character such as a video about there's no women angels and there should be no women preachers three prophecies of brother branham that are in the process of coming to pass a video about how brother branham did not pretend to speak in tongues defending brother branham's character showing how brother branham was open to receiving correction and not every word on brother graham's tapes was thus saith the lord because remember again friends we're trying to stay in the middle of the road there's two extremes around the ministry of brother branham one extreme exalts his every word to thus saith the lord this is heresy this is idolatry so we're standing in love against that side and rightly dividing the word of truth showing how they're wrong the other side attacks brother branham tries to discredit him and claim he was a false prophet a charlatan so we're refuting their misunderstandings and lies and attacks as well by the grace of the lord jesus christ our purpose of this podcast is defend jesus's message and messenger and we want to try to answer as many questions as we can by the help of the lord as we seek the lord pray to him and wait on him for his answers and they always come in the right time in season for god makes everything beautiful in his time i'm now going to refute the plagiarism accusation regarding the seven seals i'll go seal by seal starting with the first seal ending with the sixth seal but first i want to acknowledge yes brother adam used some of the exact words from charles taye's russell and clarence larkin but only as it fit the revelation the holy ghost gave to him and brother brahm didn't plagiarize them because he referenced larkin uriah smith and many other bible teachers and pastors and ministers whose books he read and gained insight from as far as i can find brother branham never referenced charles tay's russell so it seems he forgot to actually state his name but that doesn't change the fact that brother branham referenced many authors and told us he was reading many books during the week of the seven seals and of course this podcast will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that brother ram didn't plagiarize russell larkin or any other one it's my opinion that brother branham was a seventh grade educated kentuckian and he didn't understand the importance of referencing or citing his sources but that's okay god was merciful god is merciful in all of our weaknesses and all of our human mistakes and he remains a genuine prophet by the grace of god here's a quote where brother brahm talked about it being a tremendous week as he studied for the seven seals he said he'd pick up the books and oh all the writers and everything and read in read down in their book so brother iran was clearly transparent saying that he was reading lots of books during the seven seals series this has been a tremendous week for me i'm tired my mind is tired because i i was the best that i could do and something strange going on every day i would be amazed to walk in the room and be there for a few minutes and see something's turning completely around and here i go in there i pick up the notes i pick up books of dr smith you're a smith and all the writers and read and read down in their books i say now here's the sixth seal here's the fourth seal now what does this man say he'd say what was this i looked and all of a sudden when i got white here just unfolded like that then i grab a pen right quick go to writing it down like that whatever i was seeing and doing watch it like after got it rolled down then i'd take the rest of the day go down and chase this out and see if it tied all the way down to the scriptures then it proved all things i got this year and i think now there's many people had visions there's many been revelations if it's contrary to the word leave it alone that's right as i go through this subject seal by seal i'll start with comparing charles tay's russell and brother branham because it's the latest accusation against brother branham and plus i've also already done an extensive comparison between larkin and brother branham on my youtube video and please contact me if you need a link to that the timing of the first seal charles russell said the timing of the white horse rider was beyond john's epic or church age this means russell's first seal lasted from 73 a.d to 325 a.d and friends remember i have screenshots of all these quotes from charles day's russell's book the finnish mystery released in 1917 by the watchtower bible and track society russell said quote as it related to the epochs of the church beyond his own epoch that of sumernia end quote brother branham's timing was much different god's prophet said this white horse writer began writing in the first church age around 53 a.d while russell said the start time was 73 a.d a difference of 20 years that is not plagiarism let's listen to brother branham's quote here he is he's the antichrist he started rising the first church age now he rides on down on down through every age russell's end date for the first seal was 325 a.d while brother branham's end date was about 385 a.d a difference of 60 years so regarding the timing of the first seal it's obvious brother ram did not plagiarize russell now regarding larkin and brother branham larkin said the timing of the first seal was in the 70th week of daniel during the great tribulation period which is nearly a 2 000 year difference than brother branham because brother branham said around 53 a.d larkin said tribulation period which is still in the future let's look at the white horse rider russell said the white horse rider was quote the bishop of rome end quote brother brahm said the writer was the antichrist spirit and later became the pope brother brahm never said the bishop of rome in the entire first seal the bishop of roman 3 25 was not even a pope because the first pope was pope boniface iii according to the anti-nicean fathers volume number eight who became the first pope in 606 a.d the big bishop up there over all of it which is far actually called a pope but he was a he was a bishop then and boniface the third was the one who become the first pope so let's notice the difference between the writers god's prophet said the writer began as a spirit while russell said the writer began as a man the bishop of rome now regarding larkin larkin said the writer was the future antichrist the person of the antichrist during the great tribulation period so this proves brother bram did not plagiarize larkin on the first seal and again there's a two thousand year difference between larkin and branham here's an extra thing i want to add in to show brother ram did not plagiarize russell russell said that god forsook the church in the first seal and the bishop of rome defeated infinite justice or the lion beast which was one of the four beasts that surrounded the throne in heaven according to revelation chapter 4 and verse 5. russell said and i quote thus we see the apparent defeat of infinite justice in the first epoch apparently god forsook his church having jeopardizing all its interest by placing the power in the hands of the self-seeking ecclesiastical system but worse things are coming end quote brother branham taught much different brother brandon said the early church had the line anointing and was able to combat and withstand the antichrist spirit here's one quote about that the holy spirit manifests himself which is the word that's the reason early church had healings and miracles and visions and power is because it was the living word in the form of the light of the tribe of judah right now to combat that amen before moving on to the second seal let's look at the four beasts russell said the lion beast was infinite justice brother branham said it was the line anointing of supernatural signs wonders and miracles of the holy ghost and you'll see that on pages 78 79 and 80 of his book russell said the line represented justice the ox represented power the man represented love and the flying eagle represented wisdom brother branham taught completely different brother branham taught these were anointings on the church to help them combat and overcome the four horse riders or the antichrist spirit brother branham said this anointing saved the world so brother ram's revelation was much greater than russell's because russell said god's infinite justice could be defeated but we know the church of the living god by the baptism of the holy ghost and the anointing that they have for their day makes the church invincible whether they live or die because they live to the glory of god and they keep the faith here's a quote where brother brahm said the revelations god gave him regarding the four beasts were thus saith the lord and of course they were because russell and larkin did not agree with brother branham on these subjects and brother branham's revelation was scriptural when the beast went forth in the form of a man to combat that don't forget this class don't forget it see remember all the days of your life these beasts are correct it's thus saith the lord regarding the bow and no arrows of the first seal russell said jeremiah 9 3 was the fulfillment and brother random never said that you can search the first seal brother bram never references that scripture brother branham said it meant satan was a bluff and russell did not say that so again brother brown did not plagiarize the first seal from russell or larkin the rider has no errors for his boat did you notice [Music] so he must be a bluffer maybe he's got a lot of thunder no lightning but you find out christ had both lightning and thunder but out of his mouth goes a sharp two-eighth sword and he smites the nations whether his god case might nothing but he's playing a part of a hypocrite he's going forth riding a little white horse going out to conquer the second seal we'll begin with the timing russell said on page 107 quote this period beginning with the year 325 80 and extending to the year 539 was the period of formation of creeds end quote so his second seal lasted from 325 to 539 and brother branham's second seal lasted from about 385 to 1095 a.d so the timing between russell's second seal and brother ramsey's second seal was not the same brother branham started 60 years later and lasted 556 more years beyond russell's timing for the second seal proving brother ram did not plagiarize charles tay's russell regarding the timing of larkin's teachings on the second seal larkin said the timing was again during the 70th week of daniel in the future tribulation period which is nearly a 1 700 year difference from brother branham let's look at the red symbol of the second seal russell said red represented quote the color of sin imperfection end quote and the red horse rider was the quote period of formation of creeds end quote and russell wrote this on pages 106 and 107 of his book brother branham said different brother brahm said red represented rome or the roman catholic church killing christians by the millions brother branham said the seal took place when the roman catholic church was given power to kill with the sword which began around 385 a.d according to research from edmond broadbent who wrote quote priscillian a holy ghost-filled bishop of spain and six others are said to be the first saints executed by the false church in 385 a.d end quote that's from the pilgrim church 1935 page 37. so again this proves brother bram did not plagiarize the meaning of the red horse rider let's listen to brother m's quote about the red horse rider that's wrong don't do it as a nation it does it as a church every nation under heaven is to roam now i remember he's got a sword he's going forth a sword in his hand riding red horse wading through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him how do you understand it how many understands what the seal is now all right all right this rider and all his kingdom subjects that are slain down through the age that's drawn all this blood on the martyrs of the saints will be slaying by the sword of jesus christ when he comes they that take the sword will be slain by the sword they took the sword of dogma and antichrist and cut down the real true worshipers all down to the ages of the millions and when christ comes with the sword for it's his word that proceeds out of his mouth now regarding the sword brother branham did agree with russell on this because russell said quote they destroy one another as teachers end quote referring to creeds and that's on page 106 and 107 of russell's book and here's the quote again where brother branham said they took the sword of dogma and antichrist and cut down the real true worshipers all down through the ages by the millions but again brother ram's emphasis was the literal sword not the spiritual sword of creeds because this is the sermon where brother brandon brought out the historical fact of 68 million souls were martyred by the roman catholic church and he got that number from samuel s schmucker from his book the glorious reformation regarding the second beast the ox russell said the ox was infinite power brother ram said it was sacrificial saints it was christians gladly willing to be martyrs so this revelation is completely different not plagiarized see that shows that the age as the antichrist got settled down and come into the five higher age the little church could do nothing but just just simply labor and another thing the ox is uh also is a beast of sacrifice they they give their lives just as freely as they can give them regarding the writer of the second seal russell wrote quote the same writer the antichrist end quote and then recall he said in the first seal the writer was the bishop of rome brother branham agreed to a degree saying the writer changed his form starting out as a spirit but then became incarnate in a pope so these are not exactly the same thoughts they're slightly different so again brother brown did not plagiarize the second seal writer from russell here's a quote from the second seal where brethren said the antichrist kept changing his forms from nicolaitan spirit spiritual antichrist to the pope to the false prophet then to the beast then the devil himself incarnate satan's trinity same person coming just incarnate from one to the other that's where them bugs did that worms one to the other exactly nickelodeon spiritual antichrist pope false prophet beast the devil himself incarnate you can't do now you keep that on your mind now when you follow this you're going to see these writers come right straight up to that see i'm laying you a picture here if i had it on a blackboard you could understand it better see i'm watching first now you remember this the first thing he is he's an antichrist spirit amen john said so little children the spirit of antichrist already worked in the children of disobedience see if they have to get a start and then it become kind of a saiyan in the next church age and the next church agent was a doctrine and the next church he was crowned i isn't that just as plain as reading any way the third seal regarding the timing of the third seal russell said the third seal lasted from 539 to 1160 a.d brother random taught that the third seal was the black horse rider which represented the dark ages and the dark ages lasted from around 1095 and this influence continued till about 1906 so there's a huge difference between the timing of the third seal between russell and brother branham brother branham's third seal started 556 years after russell's third seal began and brother branham's third seal ended 746 years after russell's third seal ended russell's ended in 1160 a.d and brother branham's ended around 1906 a.d which is the time when the eagle anointing or the prophetic anointing started arriving for god's saints in order to receive the ministry of god's prophet brother branham larkin said the timing of the third seal was again in the 70th week of daniel which was over a 900-year difference than brother branham's third seal because brother and said the third seal began in 1095 a.d and larkin's third seal hasn't even happened yet because its future in the great tribulation regarding the symbols of the third seal russell said the beast was infinite love or he said the man represented infinite love brother braham said the beast was the wisdom of man not infinite love so this is not plagiarism russell also said the beast meant quote apparently complete triumph of the powers of darkness and the apparent inaction of infinite love permitting it end quote unreal russell said the infinite love of god was inactive during this third seal timing but brother branham said the man anointing was strong in luther and men of that age brother branham said this anointing saved the world so this was not plagiarism brother bram did not play dries larkin let's listen to the quote now notice the peace come to combat it now was man and we all know that this beast of man this power of man and his intellectuals recognize that that kosher that martin luther had in his hand when he was climbing those steps he said this is the blood of jesus christ this is the body of jesus christ and luther thought it down and said it's bread and wine amen it's not the body of christ because it's been exalted and sitting at the right hand of god making intercession amen see wisdom god bless you study the scripture and watch it it was revealed to him that the blood of jesus christ sanctifies the believer and he shouldn't then what he do you come out in another reformation he saved the world in his day like luther did see what was it that man beast power going on i'd like to play another quote from the church age book where brother branham said the man anointing produced the greatest preaching there ever was during the church ages now this quote may shock some people because many message preachers today are saying they're the greatest preachers or brother branham was the greatest preacher ever or today's young people are the greatest young people ever now they're allowed to have their opinion but i just humbly disagree in this quote it says the man age preachers were the greatest preachers of all time let's listen to the quote the preaching of the word was never greater as satan raised up his hordes of free thinkers as the originators of communism rose up as liberal theologians spread their filthy wares god raised up mighty warriors of faith and the greatest works of christian literature and teaching and preaching came from this era never has its preachers and teachers been matched and never will they be the spurgeons parkers mclarens the edwards bunions muellers brainerds barns bishops all came from this era they preached taught and wrote the word they glorified his name now i do believe we have the greatest revelation in the church ages but i'd also want to say our revelation is equal to that of the first church age because that's what we're all going to be judged by romans 2 verse 16 says in that day when god shall judge the secrets of men's hearts according to paul's gospel so the alpha has become the omega we have the same revelation that paul had and john had as brother and went beyond the curtain of time and they all rejoiced in the fact and were resting on the fact that brother brown preached paul's message nothing new it was the same revelation from the first church age but again brother branham said the greatest preaching and teaching came from the age of the man anointing and they will never be matched now regarding the writer of the third seal here's where russell and brother brahm did agree they both believed it was the popes anointed by the antichrist spirit so they agreed on that but remember they greatly differed on the timing of this seal regarding the symbols of oil and wine russell and brother ram seemed to agree on the meanings as russell said the oil was quote the supply of the holy spirit of full submission to the will of god end quote anne russell said the wine was quote a symbol of doctrine true or false and its accompanying joy's end quote but again brother ram never said the false doctrine was wine he said the wine was the new wine that fell on the day of pentecost the stimulation of revelation by the word of god they agreed on the interpretation of oil but differed on wine and larkin said the oil and wine was literally natural oil and wine that believers are going to have to use during the great tribulation period so as we end the third seal we can see brother bram did not plagiarize the timing of the third seal the meaning of wine and he did not teach the wine and oil were natural oil and wine so brother ram was not plagiarizing the third seal the fourth seal the timing of the four seal was very different between russell and brother branham russell said it was quote pre-reformation period end quote likely from 1160 to 1516 a.d brother branham alluded to the fact that the fourth seal was from 1906 to the current time period and also said the pale horse rider's last ride would be at armageddon so again we have a huge difference between these two men brother branham's was almost 400 years later and his end date is still in the future so it's clear brother ram did not plagiarize russell on this notice russell said the four seal was pre-reformation period brother branham said the reformation was under the third seal completely different here's some quotes from brother branham saying the eagle anointing was there now when he was alive and so using logic the eagle anointing had the battle of the pale horse rider so that's why we believe the pale horse rider started writing at the beginning of the laodicean church age because this was the age in which the eagle anointing would fall upon believers of course follow brother branham as a prophet eagle to our age but then also fall upon the believers who would have the same holy spirit as jesus said they would be the eagles gathered around the fresh word the carcass which is the word of god for this day now on this year we find that this fella here is an eagle this man that this living creature that's uh poured for here now but in the eagle age the last age the prophetic age where there is to rise prophetic utterance see to whom the secrets always comes now we find out that eagle asia's promised in revelations 10 7 and america 1 4 that would be in the last days that's right that uh it would be here now we see that the devils changing for um four beasts meant what power they was revealed uh to the what power he revealed to the world and how they ended on his pale death horse now let's look at god's powers of this beast to combat them another detail about the four seal is that russell said the fourth part of the earth which the pale horse rider had power over to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beast of the earth russell said this was over europe but not asia africa or america and brother branham said it was all the nations of the world so we have a huge difference here russell said quote over the fourth part of the earth over europe but not over asia africa or america end quote brother branham said he rode over every nation under heaven let's listen to the quote look what he's riding on this pale looking grizzled colored horse mixed with black red and white coming into the battle regarding clarence larkin larkin said the timing was during the 70th week of daniel or the great tribulation period brother branham's start time was around 1906 so that means brother branham's start time was was about 120 years different from the start time of larkins and of course we know the great tribulation hasn't started yet but it will likely start sometime soon no man knows the dare of the hour but just showing there's a difference of almost 120 years between brother branham's four seal and larkin's four seal so again brother bram did not plagiarize russell nor larkin regarding the four seal rider russell said the writer was the papacy during the pre-reformation period brother braham said this four-seal rider would end up being the full antichrist the pope antichrist during the great tribulation period and take his last ride down to the battle of armageddon so this is a huge difference especially regarding timing but also it's a huge difference with the completion of each seal as russell's seal ended with the reformation by the branhams ends with the ending of daniel's 70th week the ending of the great tribulation period which is the battle of armageddon the fifth seal regarding the timing of the fist seal russell said they were christian martyrs during the reformation period quote disclosing the reformation in the days of luther end quote and russell said the fifth seal ended in april 1876. brother brahm taught the reality form of the fifth seal takes place after the rapture because after the rapture the souls on the altar which are jews will cry out to the lord seeking vengeance but the lord will tell them no there's still a certain number of martyrs jewish martyrs that must be fulfilled before they're given white robes at the white throne judgment so here we have a huge difference between russell and brother bam's timing russell said it started in 1517 when luther nailed the 95 theses on the church door in wittenberg and ended in 1878 brother rams fist seal hasn't happened yet and so there's at least a difference of almost 140 years between russell's end date and the start time of brother branham's fifth seal because we know the great tribulation is yet future now with larkin and branham they agree on the fifth seal saying they are jews but larkin taught that these souls are the ones saved after the rapture brother branham said these jews were the saved jews from the time of jesus crucifixion where they cried out let jesus blood be upon us and our children throughout the entire church age history even from the days of eichmann hitler and stalin during the holocaust when they killed over 6 million jews so it's basically all the jews martyred from the days of jesus throughout the entire church ages and then there's another group that has to die during the great tribulation period as well to fill up the number of martyrs let's listen to brother rams quotes they had in their blindness martyred their messiah now they were reaping for it they realized that they recognized eggs has gone on they seen them when they come before the altar of god but now the grace of god is to them now these souls under the altar uh the this these uh souls understanding now it's under the altar why they were martyred by sinful man like eichmann see they're holding right on millions of them but they remain jews jews and hitler hated them so tonight sort of stalling all the rest of the world but they stayed true to what they believed and they killed them because they were jews and now look what a thing they had to do see there was guilty of murder so they got murdered they cried out his blood beyond us that's right that's right and they were blinded now if they hadn't been blinded god said let alone they're not worthy but then if they was blinded by god his grace reached down to him amen talk about amazing grace and give each one of them because all israel will [Applause] though they had tried to get rid of joseph his grace reached to him though they tried to get rid of jesus he still comes right back around because he's dying and getting each one of white robes he's going to take around home anyhow regarding the fist seal larkin said quote but they were not the martyrs of the christian church for they had been resurrected and taken up with the church these martyrs are those who will be killed for the word of god and their testimony after the church is called out end quote so see larkin said they were jews that would die during the great tribulation period brother braham said they were jews that died from the days of jesus crucifixion that were blinded that were blinded to jesus's identity as messiah all throughout the church ages even through world war ii and the holocaust all the way up to the end of the laodicean church age so it's clear brother brown did not plagiarize russell or larkin in the fifth seal the sixth seal regarding the timing of the sixth seal russell said the sixth seal earthquake literally took place on november 1st 1755 the stars that fell from heaven russell said fell as a meteorite shower on november 13 1833 russell said the moon became his blood on may 19 1750 and of course brother ram said the sixth seal hasn't happened yet it's future he calls it the great tribulation seal so there's a huge difference between russell's timing and brother branham's timing of the sixth seal over 150 years difference so brother bram did not plagiarize russell on the sixth seal regarding clarence larkin and brother branham the sixth seal is the first time that brother branham agreed with larkin about both the timing and the details of the seal so catch that for five seals in a row brother ram did not agree with larkin on the symbols and timings of the first five seals proving brother branham was not a plagiarist and yes brother brown used similar terminology to larkin regarding the sixth seal but it wasn't plagiarism as brother adam referenced both historians and larkin by name for his help on daniel's 70 weeks and the seven seals recall that quote from brother branham from the feast of trumpets in 1964 where he said he read larkin's work regarding the seven seals bless us under brother rams quotes i'm just leaving it at that and pursuing after a while we'd preach on the seals not knowing what the seals was and i'd read mr larkin oh so many different ones of their commentaries on this i'm very grateful to dr larkin of his views i'm grateful to all these great scholars for their views on this and in reading them it enlightens me much that i can find places that looks right larkin said regarding the sixth seal quote these physical convulsions will be earth's travailing pains as she labors to bring forth the new creation of the millennial age end quote the seventh seal regarding the timing of the seventh seal russell said the seventh seal was quote the seal of the living god end quote or holy ghost baptism from revelation 7 verse 2. this is extremely different from brother branham russell went on to say that when the quote full number end quote of saints were sealed quote persecution in a public way and on an unprecedented scale may be expected to begin almost immediately end quote this is completely different from brother branham who said the seventh seal was the literal day and hour of jesus's coming at the time of the gentile rapture and brother ram said the bride misses the persecution russell said the bride is persecuted to an unprecedented scale and notice russell said the seal of the living god was from revelation 7 verse 2 which brother branham said was the 144 000 jews so russell thought he and his followers were the 144 thousand jews brother ram did not think that brother brown knew it was literal jews so again brother brahm did not plagiarize charles russell on the seventh seal regarding clarence larkin in the seventh seal brother ram did use a lot of larkin's terminology and you can see that on my youtube video i'm not going to go into depth on that in this podcast but there was one major difference brother branham said the seventh seal was the day and hour of jesus coming according to matthew 24 36 but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only clarence larkin never taught the seventh seal was the literal day and hour of the rapture sir brother ram used some of his thoughts but the timing of it and the exact identity of it was different brother branham had the revelation from god that it was the day and hour the rapture larkin did not have that revelation let's listen to brother rams say the seventh seal was the day and hour of the rapture seven figures under straight together mike was spelling out something notice at that time john's started right he said don't write it jesus never spoke of it john couldn't write it angels know nothing about it amen what is it it's the thing that jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it see he didn't know it himself amen he said only god would know it amen but he told us when we began to see these signs coming up now you're getting somewhere all right remember he hid the seventh seal from us he wouldn't do it when the angel stood day by day telling it but then he wouldn't do it on that so there's silence in heaven no one knew it was the coming of the lord because the seventh seal there was silence no one knew there was an inner hour that christ would come as he revealed the tooth and that last trumpet like the last seal will be the coming of the lord it shall sound in the dead in christ shall rise first just rest until that time that brings a conclusion to the seven seals and my conclusion is brother ram did have daily visitations from the holy ghost each day he sought god for the true meaning of the seven seals in march 1963. brother branham was not lying to us he was telling us the truth and again friends i have screenshots of all this history from charles russell's book and i can share those on a future youtube video if you'd like it just takes a lot of time to produce those which is fine i'd love to do it but i thought i could quickly get this podcast out to prove and show beyond a shadow of a doubt brother bram did not plagiarize the seven seals from larkin or from russell yes he used some of those thoughts but he did reference larkin and he referenced many books he was reading but the timing and meaning of the symbols and the four beasts almost every single one of them was completely different from those two men so my conclusion about brother graham's accuser saying brother branham plagiarized the seven seals is that the accusers are either being honest but have very weak and lazy research and of course are completely wrong or they're being dishonest deceptive and doing subjective research on purpose in order to defame brother brahms character only god knows which one it is but the research i've done clearly shows brother ram did not plagiarize either russell or larkin and i think it's easy to tell that their research was very weak and subjective because their videos were so short this means they didn't show much evidence for their claims at all and i'm not bragging or anything but look how long this podcast is it has to be so long because there's so much information there was so much research to do on all three men and any honest person would say this podcast has put much more research into the subject of charles russell brother branham and clarence larkin and their teachings on the seven seals and the seven church ages so i will continue to pray for brother graham's accusers that they'll repent and either stop doing research or with the repentant heart delete their old research and put out new research but it's likely they won't repent but i will not stop praying for them what a joy it is to defend jesus christ his message and his messenger differences about the seven church ages i'll briefly show the differences between charles russell brother branham and clarence larkin regarding their timing of the seven church ages and also their choice of messengers for a full teaching on larkin versus brother branham's understanding of the church ages see my youtube video as i referenced earlier the first church age ephesus charles day's russell said the messenger was paul which was the same as brother branham so they agreed on that clarence larkin said there was no messenger so brother braham did not get this idea about messengers from larkin but the timing of the first church age was slightly different russell said it started in 33 a.d and lasted to 73 a.d brother branham had the start date for 53 a.d which was 20 years different than charles russell and his end date was almost 100 years different in 170 a.d so again this is not plagiarism brother rams dates were closer to larkin larkin said the ephesus church age was from 70 to 170 a.d but again not exactly the same and friends before moving on remember that brother brahm did say he got the dates for the church ages from historians so brother ram never claimed those were all revealed by the holy spirit or that he had some new revelation no one else knew regarding the dates let's listen to the quote remember as i said before sometimes on these things we might disagree upon them as far as as the theology is concerned and most of my dates i take from the authentic uh historians which really not interested in any side they just wrote down facts whatever it was what the churches did and of course the divine part of the interpretation i tried to place it up on there myself the best that i know how so it's clear from listening to this quote that brother braham used dates from numerous historians when studying the church ages but then he looked to the lord for the revelation aspect of it the meaning of the symbols symbols and descriptions fit into each church age the second church age was smyrna charles dave's russell said the messenger was saint john the beloved brother braham said the messenger was iranius larkin did not have a messenger so we can see how brother ram did not plagiarize russell on the messenger regarding the dates russell said it lasted from 73 to 325 a.d but the brand's dates were completely different he said 170 80 to 312 a.d so brother adam did not plagiarize russell on the second church age brother rams dates did match larkin's dates which was 170 to 312 a.d but again brother brown didn't plagiarize he thanked the historians for all the dates as you just heard the quotes the third church age was pergamos charles day's russell said the messenger was aries brother bram said the messenger was saint martin larkin had no messenger regarding the dates russell said it was from 325 to 1160 brother rams was completely different he said it was 312 so started earlier from 312 to 606. and again brother rams dates matched larkin but brother branham referenced historians for the date regarding the fourth church age thyatira charles russell said the messenger was peter waldow brother ram said the messenger was columba clarence larkin did not have a messenger so brother abraham didn't plagiarize the messengers from charleston's russell regarding the dates of the third tier in church age russell said one thousand one hundred sixty to thirteen seventy eight brother rams was completely different he said it went from six oh six to fifteen twenty a d and again brother bran's dates matched larkins exactly and brother ram referenced historians for the dates the sixth church age was sardis charles day's russell said the messenger was john wycliffe brother bram said the messenger was martin luther larkin did not have a messenger regarding the dates russell said it was 1378 1378-1517 brother brahms was totally different on his dates he said 1520 to 1750. and again those dates from brother branham matched larkin's dates and brother branham referenced larkin and historians for their help the sixth church age was philadelphia charles russell said the messenger was martin luther brother brown said it was john wesley so brother ram didn't plagiarize that larkin didn't have any messengers regarding the dates russell said it was 1517 to 1874. brother rams was very different he said it was 1750 to 1906 and those dates were close to larkin but not exactly larkin started larkin ended his in 1900 brother branham ended his in 1906 their start dates were the same 1750 but their end dates were different regarding the final church age the laodicean church age russell said he was the messenger for that age but the random said it was elijah which we know was brother branham's ministry larkin did not have a messenger the time period for laodicea according to russell was 1874 to 1918. brother adams was totally different he said it began in 1906 and has not ended yet he says it ends at the rapture of the gentile church larkin state started at 1900 which was six years different from brother branham and he did not have an end date of course either so my conclusion regarding the church ages is that brother bram did not plagiarize them from russell they were very different it seems like he got some type of idea about the format from russell and larkin and of course brother branham's dates matched larkins very closely which was fine brother bran referenced larkin and historians for his dates he never claimed the dates were directly from god we have one listener question we'd like to answer and respond to joshua from india asked isn't it possible for the prophet brother braham to prophesy or speak thus saith the lord without saying thus saith the lord the answer is yes but remember brother ram told us and he cares do you care in 1963 he said the way to know for sure that god is speaking he said it will speak it it's thus saith the lord but no doubt there are times when a prophet can just speak something and it doesn't have to have thus saith the lord following it and it can be a prophecy for example brother rahm told florence humes in 1955 that she be healed from tuberculosis and he must have saw vision because he said go weigh yourself in the next two mondays and you'll know what i've told you is the truth so he had to see a vision and he told her she'd get healed which she did she lived over 50 years beyond that and was completely healed from tuberculosis brother braham did curse satan in the name of the lord jesus christ in that prayer line with sister humes and her healing came to pass so it was thus saith the lord even though brother ram didn't say thus saith the lord you also see that in the scripture paul told the philippian jailer believe on the lord jesus christ and thy in thy house shall be saved the bible doesn't record paul saying thus saith the lord but what paul said came to pass the philippian jailer invited paul into his house and barnabas and the flipping jailer he and his entire house were baptized and saved and they were baptized in the name of the lord that's according to acts chapter 16. that's it for this podcast friends thanks so much for your support thanks for loving the truth loving god's message and rejoicing in god's messenger that he sent to us we're so happy to defend god's message and messenger and we'll do it by the help of the holy spirit and through your prayers and your support by the grace of god and we're so thankful that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever god bless you friends as the holy ghost anoints you to defend the gospel of jesus christ as paul also said in philippians 1 verse 17 he said knowing that i am set for the defense of the gospel god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart [Music] you
