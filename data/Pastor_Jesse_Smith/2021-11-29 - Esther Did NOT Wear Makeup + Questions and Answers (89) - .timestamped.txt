[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:08] of the lord jesus christ
[0:10] esther jewish queen of persian king
[0:13] xerxes the first
[0:15] who lived about 500 years before christ
[0:18] is never recorded as wearing makeup in
[0:20] the holy bible the king james version
[0:23] and so it's wrong to use her as a proof
[0:25] that christian women and men can wear
[0:28] makeup
[0:29] this video will show bible proofs that
[0:31] esther is never recorded as wearing
[0:33] makeup along with a timeline to support
[0:36] why esther probably avoided wearing
[0:38] makeup and lastly some questions and
[0:40] answers
[0:41] regarding makeup usage
[0:45] the inspiration for this video recently
[0:47] came after i noticed my most popular
[0:48] video to date makeup in the bible which
[0:51] has about two hundred ninety seven
[0:53] thousand views published in twenty
[0:55] fourteen
[0:56] did not address the subject of esther
[0:59] and the question about her use of makeup
[1:02] since then i have addressed this subject
[1:04] in my 2019 book called restoring
[1:06] christian modesty so this video will use
[1:09] the teachings from that book
[1:11] and if you can't afford that book please
[1:13] contact me i'll be happy to either email
[1:15] you a pdf copy
[1:17] or mail you a paperback copy
[1:20] bible proof esther did not wear makeup
[1:24] comparing two scriptures about esther
[1:26] from esther 2 verse 9 and chapter 2
[1:29] verse 12
[1:30] with the three scriptures about makeup
[1:32] in the king james version
[1:34] which are second kings 9 30 jeremiah 4
[1:38] 30 and ezekiel 23 40
[1:41] we arrive at the conclusion that the
[1:43] context of these scriptures
[1:45] and the hebrew definitions of the words
[1:47] related to the face and face painting
[1:50] are speaking of different treatments
[1:53] esther chapter 2 verse 9 and chapter 2
[1:55] verse 12
[1:56] declare she was given things for
[1:58] purification which were oils of myrrh
[2:01] and sweet odors
[2:03] the two hebrew words for purification
[2:06] numbers 8562 and
[2:09] 4795 in the hebrew lexicon
[2:12] both mean rubbing or bodily rubbings
[2:16] so the truth is esther was most likely
[2:18] given moisturizing oils for topical skin
[2:21] care
[2:23] esther 2 verse 12 says she was given 6
[2:25] months with oil of myrrh and 6 months
[2:28] with sweet odors and with other things
[2:30] for the purifying of women
[2:33] these two hebrew words for rubbing oils
[2:35] are different from the hebrew word for
[2:37] face paint from jeremiah 4 30.
[2:41] which is number 6320 in the hebrew
[2:44] lexicon which means
[2:46] antimony black paint or i cosmetic
[2:50] the hebrew lexicon says make up use the
[2:52] mineral antimony which is said to be
[2:55] cancer-causing according to wikipedia
[2:58] the true conclusion is that esther was
[3:00] recorded as using only oils and balsam
[3:03] a gum substance
[3:05] from trees and not minerals like metals
[3:08] and charcoal which is what makeup was
[3:10] made from again according to wikipedia
[3:13] i like to read a portion from my 2019
[3:15] book restoring christian modesty from
[3:18] page 80.
[3:19] numerous people have erroneously told me
[3:21] that esther wore makeup but there is
[3:23] absolutely no scriptural support for
[3:25] this belief
[3:26] the bible never says esther painted her
[3:28] face as it says for jezebel and twice
[3:31] for israel in allegories
[3:33] scripturally esther was purified using
[3:36] oils not face painting
[3:38] esther 2 verse 9 and esther 2 verse 12
[3:41] declare she was given things for
[3:42] purification which were oils of myrrh
[3:45] and sweet odors esther was most likely
[3:47] given moisturizing oils for topical skin
[3:50] care
[3:51] perhaps esther's lack of makeup was the
[3:53] distinguishing characteristic that
[3:56] attracted the king to her inner beauty
[3:59] and this thought was shared with me by a
[4:01] sister in the lord named joyce greeley
[4:03] so i want to thank her for sharing that
[4:04] thought with me
[4:06] please do not be deceived by the gross
[4:08] misunderstanding among churches
[4:09] concerning esther as scripture never
[4:12] states that she used makeup to paint her
[4:13] face
[4:14] do not be influenced by those who add to
[4:17] the words of god for they shall be found
[4:19] liars according to proverbs 30 verses 5
[4:22] and 6
[4:23] we must keep god's commands and live
[4:26] according to proverbs 4 verse 4
[4:28] let thine heart retain my words keep my
[4:31] commandments and live
[4:33] let's look at a bible timeline that may
[4:35] help us understand why it's likely
[4:37] esther did not wear makeup
[4:40] recall mordecai was a staunch jew who
[4:42] faithfully kept the word of god refusing
[4:44] to bow to haman
[4:46] as you're probably aware mordecai was
[4:48] esther's older cousin
[4:50] if mordecai was strong enough to defy
[4:52] the political pressure of persia and
[4:54] their mandate to bow down to haman
[4:57] surely he was grounded in moses's law
[5:00] and knew the necessity for israel to not
[5:02] imitate the heathen practices of the
[5:04] canaanites written some thousand years
[5:07] previously according to exodus 34 15
[5:10] deuteronomy 31 verse 16 and verse 20
[5:14] joshua 24 15 and judges 2 verse 12 to
[5:18] name a few
[5:19] so the timeline would be as follows
[5:22] about 930 years before mordecai around
[5:25] 1500 bc god commanded moses and then
[5:28] later joshua to abstain from the ways of
[5:31] the heathen and i've previously cited
[5:33] those scriptures
[5:34] then
[5:35] 365 years or so before mordecai around
[5:38] 884 bc was when jezebel wore makeup and
[5:42] mordecai would certainly have been aware
[5:44] of her wicked ways
[5:46] 112 years before mordecai in jeremiah's
[5:49] time jeremiah wrote about the evils of
[5:51] makeup in jeremiah 4 30 so it's likely
[5:54] mordecai would have known jeremiah's
[5:56] words as well
[5:58] 83 years before mordecai again in
[6:00] jeremiah's time around 602 bc jeremiah
[6:04] wrote in chapter 10 verse 2 about the
[6:06] evils of imitating the heathen and
[6:09] makeup is first recorded as being used
[6:11] by the egyptian heathens as jeremiah
[6:13] said israel must not learn the way of
[6:16] the heathen
[6:17] 74 years before mordecai in ezekiel's
[6:20] time around 593 bc
[6:23] ezekiel wrote about the evils of makeup
[6:25] in ezekiel 23 verse 40 so it's again
[6:27] likely mordecai would have known about
[6:30] ezekiel's words
[6:32] this brings us to esther's time period
[6:34] of becoming the persian queen around 519
[6:37] or 515 bc
[6:40] using this timeline please consider
[6:42] again the probability that perhaps
[6:44] esther's lack of makeup was one
[6:46] distinguishing characteristic
[6:48] that attracted the king to her inner
[6:50] beauty
[6:52] make up questions and answers
[6:55] i thought it'd be helpful to read three
[6:56] questions and answers from my 2019 book
[6:58] about modesty found on pages 113-1-14
[7:03] question 1 god bless your heart for
[7:05] trying to correct the body of christ but
[7:07] the scriptures you cited spoke to the
[7:09] heart of evil jezebel and the rebellion
[7:11] of israel what about esther who took an
[7:14] entire year to prepare for the king
[7:16] written by p.s january 2018
[7:20] my answer was dear friend thank you for
[7:22] the respectful tone of your comment
[7:24] first the three scriptures i quoted on
[7:26] the 2014 makeup youtube video clearly
[7:30] identified face painting as an evil
[7:32] trait as god never asked anyone to face
[7:35] paint and all three women were under the
[7:37] judgment of god for their idolatry
[7:39] second esther never painted her face
[7:42] there seems to be a huge
[7:43] misunderstanding among churches with
[7:44] esther as she never used facial
[7:46] cosmetics she was purified using oils
[7:49] but not face painting esther cannot be
[7:52] used as an example to support makeup
[7:54] wearing as she was never given cosmetics
[7:57] esther 2 verse 9 and 2 verse 12 states
[8:00] she was given things for purification
[8:02] which were oils of myrrh and sweet odors
[8:04] it never says she was given makeup to
[8:06] paint her face
[8:08] now that's the end of the answer but i
[8:10] also had this thought too that i'd like
[8:12] to share with you god was very concerned
[8:14] about the outward appearance for example
[8:17] in leviticus 19 27
[8:19] god taught israel and their men
[8:22] to not trim their beards and round off
[8:24] the corners of their beards because this
[8:27] would make them look like the heathen
[8:28] men that surrounded them if trimming a
[8:31] beard rounding the corners was enough of
[8:34] a change
[8:35] of the physical facial appearance that
[8:37] it might lead a person into heathen
[8:39] idolatry
[8:40] how much more would adding paint to the
[8:42] face lead someone into idolatry
[8:45] so these two examples of face painting
[8:47] and trimming one's beard and rounding
[8:50] the corners of the beard show how god
[8:52] went to extra lengths to help israel not
[8:54] to imitate the worldly sinful people and
[8:57] heathens that surrounded them
[8:59] question number two what about a lady
[9:01] who has defects like acne or scars from
[9:04] an accident or surgery what about a bad
[9:07] burn that can be covered with full cover
[9:09] foundation
[9:10] a little blush come on
[9:12] what about if it's your daughter or your
[9:14] wife with aging spots feeling ugly in
[9:16] front of you
[9:17] this question was from rc
[9:20] november 2017.
[9:23] my answer was thank you for the
[9:24] questions first i'm very happy you
[9:26] refrain from lipstick and other makeup
[9:29] second i would encourage those with
[9:30] scars to seek god about this topic but
[9:33] since we know god never changes
[9:35] it would seem god would give them the
[9:37] same answer makeup is a heathen trait
[9:39] that should be avoided when people see
[9:41] their scars the women could use them for
[9:43] a testimony about the grace of god for
[9:45] keeping them healthy or alive
[9:48] third we teach women and men should
[9:50] never wear any makeup under any
[9:51] condition
[9:52] i know that seems harsh to you but we
[9:54] obey
[9:55] based upon our love for jesus and his
[9:57] holy bible you said a little blush is
[9:59] acceptable but to me i respectfully say
[10:02] that your words remind me of a little
[10:04] leaven leavens the whole lump in first
[10:06] corinthians 5 6.
[10:09] a little bit of sin is still sin and
[10:10] will grow into more sin a little bit of
[10:13] worldliness is still worldly we must not
[10:15] love the world neither the things that
[10:17] are in the world
[10:18] last if my wife and daughters feel ugly
[10:20] due to aging spots i will reassure them
[10:23] that i love them unconditionally and
[10:25] that god's word says they are fearfully
[10:27] and wonderfully made in god's sight and
[10:30] also
[10:30] mine question number three god tells us
[10:34] to obey his commandments so obviously
[10:36] those are sins is wearing makeup and
[10:38] trousers sinful they're obviously out of
[10:41] order as god is an orderly god but are
[10:43] they truly sins or is it semantics just
[10:47] curious
[10:48] this question was from bj
[10:50] november 2017
[10:53] answer thank you for the question
[10:55] crossdressing or men wearing skirts and
[10:58] women wearing men's pants is a sin and
[11:00] even more an abomination
[11:02] according to deuteronomy 22 verse 5
[11:05] makeup is a sin as well as god told
[11:07] israel not to learn the ways of the
[11:09] heathen in jeremiah 10 verse 2.
[11:12] make up wearing is an expression of
[11:14] pride also a proud look
[11:16] is an abomination according to proverbs
[11:19] 6
[11:19] verses 16 through 17
[11:22] what could be more prideful than wearing
[11:24] a false face
[11:25] to impress or seduce others
[11:29] that was the end of my answer but let me
[11:30] again read proverbs 6 verses 16 and 17
[11:34] and emphasize this scripture in light of
[11:36] makeup wearing and also rounding of the
[11:39] beards
[11:40] proverbs 6 verse 16 says these six
[11:43] things doth the lord hate yea seven are
[11:45] an abomination unto him
[11:47] a proud look a lying tongue and hands
[11:51] that shed innocent blood so without a
[11:53] doubt most people wear makeup to make
[11:55] themselves more attractive or make
[11:57] themselves feel more beautiful that's an
[11:59] expression of pride remember psalm says
[12:02] that you're already fearfully and
[12:03] wonderfully made and you do not need
[12:05] anything external added to your person
[12:07] or body than what god already gave you
[12:10] neither men nor women should ever wear
[12:12] makeup a question about one of brother
[12:14] branham's makeup quotes
[12:17] in november of 1961 brother branham said
[12:19] it was all right i imagine for women to
[12:22] add some makeup to give themselves some
[12:24] color
[12:25] this statement could not have been thus
[12:26] saith the lord because both previous to
[12:29] this statement in 1956 and 1961 and
[12:32] after this statement in 1963 and 1964
[12:36] brother branham said the bible teaches
[12:38] all makeup wearing was a sin
[12:41] the no makeup doctrine is biblically
[12:44] accurate according to the verses we've
[12:45] already discussed second kings 9 30
[12:48] jeremiah 4 30 and jeremiah 23 verse 40.
[12:52] makeup was a heathen trait and israel
[12:54] was told to not learn the ways of the
[12:56] heathen in jeremiah 10 verse 2 a
[12:58] prideful look is also an abomination
[13:00] let's listen to this quote from brother
[13:02] branham
[13:03] don't dye your hair something look like
[13:05] something you come out of this
[13:07] some mire somewhere
[13:10] don't if you're
[13:11] colorless and you want to make yourself
[13:13] look like you got some color it's all
[13:15] right i imagine but don't make yourself
[13:17] look like jezebel
[13:20] like a barn somewhere
[13:23] being painted
[13:25] here's two quotes from brother branham
[13:27] before this quote saying all make up
[13:29] wearing is a sin
[13:31] this day you got too much hollywood
[13:33] evangelism some little 65 guy with
[13:35] manicured hair set up there a bunch of
[13:38] women with earrings hanging down like
[13:39] the several steps and all that paint on
[13:41] their face to paint a barn and hair
[13:44] that used to be a sin among you holy
[13:46] people what happened
[13:55] any birth is a mess
[13:57] i don't care where it's at
[13:59] if it's in the big bin in the barnyard
[14:01] or if it's in a pink decorated hospital
[14:04] room it's a mess
[14:05] and the new birth is too
[14:08] it'll make you squall and bald wash all
[14:10] that paint off your face it'll do things
[14:12] for you that you didn't think you would
[14:14] do
[14:14] you'll
[14:16] [Music]
[14:20] and here's two quotes from after that
[14:22] quote in 1961
[14:24] stating that all makeup wearing is a sin
[14:27] and notice in brother brown's vision of
[14:28] the bride she had no makeup on
[14:32] i said how can i teach them algebra when
[14:34] they won't even learn their abcs
[14:38] certainly
[14:40] how can you do it
[14:42] such a conglomeration
[14:45] of sin
[14:46] the mark of it shows anyone knows that
[14:49] paint is a heathen trait
[14:51] i'm a missionary
[14:55] heathens paint the indians painted their
[14:57] faces here in arizona before they know
[14:59] god
[15:01] do you ever know god you don't have to
[15:02] tell them no more about it
[15:05] take it off
[15:07] chosen at war with god
[15:09] when they take it all shows are at peace
[15:11] with god
[15:14] and not knowing until just a few minutes
[15:16] ago look like or just recently
[15:18] see
[15:20] did you notice the bride come in view
[15:22] twice
[15:24] the first seed the six
[15:27] both of them had exactly the same one
[15:30] and the reason they were
[15:31] dressed in different parts
[15:33] she'll come from all nations it'll make
[15:35] up the bride
[15:38] each one had long hair no makeup and
[15:40] real pretty girls and they were watching
[15:42] me that represented the bride coming out
[15:44] of all nations see
[15:46] each one represented the nation as they
[15:48] marched perfectly in line with the word
[15:53] friends it's difficult to say why
[15:55] brother branham said it was all right to
[15:56] wear some makeup but also condemn the
[15:59] wearing of any and all makeup it could
[16:01] have been an honest mistake or a
[16:03] personal sin in a weak moment all
[16:05] prophets outside of jesus christ were
[16:07] human and fall short of the glory of god
[16:10] and of course brother branham taught us
[16:12] to take every doctrine back to the bible
[16:14] and when you go back to the bible you
[16:16] never find a woman being asked by god or
[16:18] a man to paint their faces
[16:20] a word about old testament customs
[16:23] we can certainly use the old testament
[16:25] books of the bible and the law to build
[16:28] doctrine for reproof for correction for
[16:31] instruction in righteousness as second
[16:33] timothy 3 verses 15-17 teach
[16:37] and that is what we're doing here on
[16:38] this video we're using old testament
[16:40] scripture
[16:41] to show how god has always been and
[16:44] always will be against makeup use
[16:46] it's important to know that israelis in
[16:48] the old testament kept customs that were
[16:51] not completely holy such as the custom
[16:53] of taking numerous wives like abraham
[16:56] david and solomon
[16:58] also
[16:59] the custom of accepting and wearing some
[17:01] type of earrings in the case of rebecca
[17:04] and job
[17:05] next the custom of a virgin wearing a
[17:08] veil in the presence of her espoused
[17:09] husband like rebecca and isaac
[17:12] and again the custom of requiring men to
[17:15] wear their beards in a certain way
[17:17] the holy ghost in the new testament
[17:19] through jesus christ saint paul and
[17:21] other bible authors have declared these
[17:23] customs
[17:25] as unholy and sinful or just not needed
[17:28] in some cases
[17:30] such as multiple marriages we know being
[17:32] married more than once with a living
[17:34] spouse is now called adultery in the new
[17:36] testament so the old testament custom of
[17:39] having more than one living spouse is
[17:41] now sinful in the new testament other
[17:43] old testament customs are now considered
[17:45] worldly such as earrings and thereby
[17:48] should be abstained from at all times
[17:51] in closing
[17:53] i hope this video has been a blessing to
[17:54] you learning about esther and how she
[17:57] never wore makeup
[17:58] all of these topics are wonderful topics
[18:01] and exercises and rightly dividing the
[18:04] word of truth here in the new testament
[18:06] under the leadership of the holy ghost
[18:09] and the holy ghost will always point us
[18:10] back to the word of god
[18:12] if you have any questions concerns or
[18:14] testimonies about this video please
[18:16] contact me
[18:19] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[18:21] the desire of your heart
