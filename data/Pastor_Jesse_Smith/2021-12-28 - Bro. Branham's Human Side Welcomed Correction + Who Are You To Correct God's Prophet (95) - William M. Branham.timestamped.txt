[0:00] [Music]
[0:07] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:09] of the lord jesus christ
[0:11] the purpose of this video is to show how
[0:14] william branham's human side as he
[0:16] called it
[0:17] was open to correction
[0:19] but the divine side or the prophetic
[0:22] gift in his life that moved him to speak
[0:24] with thus saith the lord
[0:26] was not to be corrected for it was god's
[0:29] infallible word
[0:31] i'll also show how closely the human
[0:33] side and the divine side were sometimes
[0:37] only one breath away
[0:39] let's begin by addressing the criticism
[0:42] of who are you to correct god's prophet
[0:46] friends this criticism is a shallow
[0:48] statement some around brother branham's
[0:50] message make to criticize ministers like
[0:53] myself and others that take different
[0:56] opinions than brother branham on minor
[0:59] doctrines his predictions his hopes and
[1:02] other human ideas he had
[1:05] this shallow criticism usually sounds
[1:07] something like this
[1:08] who are you to correct god's prophet
[1:12] the real question is who are you to make
[1:14] brother branham equal to jesus christ by
[1:17] making every word human opinion
[1:20] prediction hope and human idea brother
[1:22] branham had as unquestionable
[1:25] another real question is who are you to
[1:28] call yourself a minister and not labor
[1:30] in bible doctrine in order to find the
[1:32] truth regarding one of brother branham's
[1:35] minor doctrines
[1:36] opinions predictions hopes or other
[1:39] human thought
[1:41] another related question is who are you
[1:44] to break the bible commands in first
[1:46] thessalonians 5 21
[1:48] first peter 3 verse 15
[1:50] acts 17 verse 11 and 2 timothy 2 verse
[1:54] 15 that command us to prove all things
[1:58] be ready always to answer questions
[2:00] about the hope we have within us
[2:02] the command to search the scriptures
[2:04] daily to prove all things preached are
[2:06] so and the command to rightly divide the
[2:09] word of truth
[2:11] in this video you'll see how brother
[2:13] branham was always open to correction
[2:15] and received it from numerous people as
[2:18] he knew and shared publicly that his
[2:20] human side made mistakes
[2:22] more importantly the bible says everyone
[2:24] needs correction outside of god and his
[2:27] son jesus christ
[2:29] i honestly believe the preachers who use
[2:31] this criticism of who are you to correct
[2:33] god's prophet
[2:35] are many times using it as their excuse
[2:38] not to study and rightly divide the word
[2:40] of truth
[2:41] it seems they are just lazy and not
[2:43] willing to study something out or they
[2:46] just want to give some statement in
[2:47] their sermon authority that it may not
[2:50] have
[2:51] remember that understanding
[2:53] doctrine is literally called work or
[2:55] labor in the bible and god gives double
[2:58] honor to those who labor in doctrine
[3:01] according to first timothy 5 17
[3:03] let the elders that rule well be counted
[3:05] worthy of double honor especially they
[3:08] who labor in the word and doctrine
[3:12] here's the outline for this video
[3:14] first we'll look at bible teaching that
[3:16] all men including prophets need
[3:18] correction
[3:20] second we'll look at brother branham's
[3:21] quote explaining the human side and the
[3:23] divine side
[3:25] third we'll look at examples of how
[3:27] brother branham and his attitude and
[3:29] openness about being corrected
[3:32] and lastly we'll look at how close
[3:34] brother ram's human side was to his
[3:36] divine side
[3:39] bible teaching that all men need
[3:41] correction
[3:43] beginning with hebrews chapter 12
[3:45] god chastens or corrects all his sons
[3:48] and daughters if he doesn't they are not
[3:51] his children hebrews 12 verse 6 through
[3:53] 8 says for whom the lord loveth he
[3:55] chasteneth and scourges every son whom
[3:58] he receiveth
[3:59] if ye endure chastening
[4:01] god dealt with you as with sons for what
[4:04] son is he whom the father chasteneth not
[4:08] but if ye be without chastisement
[4:10] whereof all are partakers then are ye
[4:13] bastards and not sons
[4:16] friends the greek word chastise means to
[4:19] learn or instruct or to correct it means
[4:23] to train children to be instructed or
[4:25] taught or learned to cause one to learn
[4:29] so the context is clear god has to cause
[4:31] all his children to obey him to be
[4:34] taught of him to learn of him to be
[4:36] corrected by him or else they are not
[4:38] god's children and notice the scripture
[4:41] said every son so every son and daughter
[4:43] must be corrected by god
[4:45] i want to quickly show some bible
[4:47] examples of how
[4:49] men and even prophets needed correction
[4:51] from others
[4:53] peter was a prophet who prophesied of
[4:55] the day of the lord
[4:57] and he needed corrected by another
[4:58] prophet paul in galatians chapter 2
[5:01] regarding peter discriminating against
[5:04] gentiles and not eating with them but he
[5:06] was corrected by paul through the holy
[5:08] spirit
[5:10] elijah told god he was the only one left
[5:12] who'd not bowed the knee to baal but
[5:15] then god corrected him and said there
[5:16] were seven thousand who had not bowed
[5:18] their knee to baal
[5:20] moses was a prophet and he was corrected
[5:23] and had his life saved by his wife
[5:25] zipporah when she circumcised their sons
[5:28] and circumcision was certainly a
[5:30] doctrine that god had given to abraham
[5:33] because the word doctrine means
[5:34] instruction and abraham was instructed
[5:36] to have all the males circumcised
[5:39] so this is a clear example of how god
[5:41] will use others to correct prophets
[5:44] on doctrine sometimes indirectly as in
[5:47] the case with zipporah
[5:48] because we know women and wives are not
[5:50] supposed to rebuke their husbands by the
[5:52] word according to first peter chapter
[5:54] three but the woman's godly example is
[5:57] supposed to convict her husband and
[5:59] that's exactly what happened in zipporah
[6:02] and moses's case
[6:03] and that's found in first peter 3 verse
[6:05] 1 her husband may without the word be
[6:08] won by the conversation of the wives
[6:11] and zipporah circumcising their sons
[6:15] and saving moses's life was in exodus
[6:17] chapter 4
[6:18] verses 25 and 26 and brother random even
[6:22] said that zipporah saved the life of her
[6:24] prophet husband moses
[6:28] god was after
[6:32] saved him moses
[6:34] her
[6:35] sephora got a sharp rock
[6:38] and went and cut the foreskin off of her
[6:40] baby and threw it before moses and said
[6:43] thou art a bloody husband to me
[6:45] is that right
[6:47] and god would have tough moses
[6:51] but perhaps an angel was standing there
[6:53] said zappora
[6:54] catch it quickly
[6:56] see
[6:58] there you are
[6:59] going down to egypt and i'll watch how
[7:01] neglectful a man can go
[7:05] in the end god met him down here in the
[7:07] end and would have slayed him
[7:10] and support went and tucked a sharp rock
[7:14] and circumcised her two children with a
[7:16] sharp rock and filled the foreskin
[7:18] before moses and said you're a bloody
[7:20] husband to me
[7:21] only save moses life
[7:26] john the baptist needed correction when
[7:28] he doubted if jesus was the messiah in
[7:31] matthew chapter 11
[7:32] and we know jesus corrected him of
[7:34] course in love by telling his disciples
[7:37] to see what was happening in their
[7:39] campaigns all the miraculous signs
[7:41] wonders and miracles proving jesus was
[7:43] the messiah
[7:45] many more examples could be given such
[7:47] as jacob the prophet
[7:49] not knowing that his son joseph was
[7:50] actually alive
[7:52] and then finding out later towards the
[7:53] end of his life
[7:55] and brother brahm told us that god's
[7:57] prophets don't know everything and he
[7:58] just tells them what he wants them to
[8:00] know
[8:02] briefly i want to mention something that
[8:04] people have asked about in first samuel
[8:06] 3 verse 19 the bible said in samuel grew
[8:09] and the lord was with him and did let
[8:11] none of his words fall to the ground
[8:14] some people have tried to make this seem
[8:16] like samuel never said anything wrong in
[8:18] his entire life and of course that's not
[8:20] the case
[8:21] if you look at the entire context of the
[8:23] bible every prophet who had the human
[8:26] sin nature which means all prophets
[8:27] outside of jesus christ all sinned and
[8:30] fell short of the glory of god according
[8:32] to numerous scriptures like in job but
[8:34] also in romans chapter 3.
[8:37] so this scripture that says none of
[8:38] samuel's words fell to the ground has to
[8:41] refer to all his statements that were
[8:42] spoken with thus saith the lord because
[8:45] romans 3 again says all are under sin
[8:48] there's none righteous no not one
[8:51] there's none that seeketh after god all
[8:53] are gone out of the way
[8:55] none that doeth good no not one and all
[8:58] their tongues have used deceit
[9:01] so i believe this means samuel was
[9:03] vindicated by god every time he spoke in
[9:05] the lord's name i believe the same is
[9:08] true about brother branham but we have
[9:09] to understand that only brother brahm's
[9:11] statements that were spoken with thus
[9:13] saith the lord were the statements that
[9:15] have never fallen to the ground
[9:17] brother branham's human opinions
[9:19] thoughts and ideas have fallen to the
[9:21] ground
[9:22] even his human predictions such as the
[9:24] 1977 prediction
[9:26] that america would be destroyed before
[9:28] 1977 with only tree stumps left
[9:31] and brother ramsey's hopes and dreams
[9:33] that billy paul would be a full prophet
[9:35] and then later recognizing billy paul
[9:37] wasn't called to preach
[9:39] and then
[9:40] trying to keep myself from sin at that
[9:43] time as much as i knew how i thought
[9:44] maybe god would let my children
[9:47] come into the blessing the full blessing
[9:49] and maybe my little boy would fully fear
[9:52] a prophet sent from god
[9:54] i pray for that
[9:57] billy
[9:58] has been my chum i've raised him his
[10:00] mother died when he was just 18 months
[10:02] old and they've been father mother both
[10:05] to him
[10:06] but it seems like he doesn't have a call
[10:08] to be a preacher
[10:10] he's bashful backwards and so forth
[10:15] some of my other videos deal with these
[10:16] subjects so please contact me if you'd
[10:18] like links to those videos
[10:21] brother branham's quote explaining the
[10:23] human side and the divine side
[10:26] i've used this quote on numerous videos
[10:28] before but from the sermon he cares do
[10:30] you care listen how brother branham
[10:32] explains there is a divine side to him
[10:35] and it always speaks with us saith the
[10:37] lord but there's also a human side to
[10:39] him and brother brahm said he always
[10:41] asks us to be careful what we're
[10:42] listening to and in context he's saying
[10:45] be careful not to make something thus
[10:47] saith the lord that wasn't thus saith
[10:49] the lord that was only his human opinion
[10:52] or idea
[10:54] did you prophesy that there be a million
[10:57] negroes uh killed
[11:00] on the
[11:01] art did you just announce
[11:04] that there would be this happening now
[11:07] see
[11:08] i've always asked you to be careful what
[11:11] you're listening to
[11:14] there's so much of it that it's just the
[11:16] human side but always if there is
[11:20] something that goes forth it will speak
[11:22] it it's thus saith the law
[11:25] even to visions or anything
[11:28] no
[11:29] i just was talking about martin luther
[11:32] king
[11:33] on this great
[11:35] disaster that they're having in the
[11:37] south with the the colored people
[11:40] and that's reason i see that not that
[11:42] there is any uh any prophecy concerning
[11:45] it i have nothing on it from the lord
[11:48] and be sure now if i say anything from
[11:50] the lord like that to tell you it's
[11:52] always i'm speaking now but when he
[11:55] speaks i say it's not me it's thus saith
[11:57] the lord and i can't say it until he
[12:00] tells me i could be altogether wrong in
[12:02] my thought about martin luther king
[12:04] i don't know i can't say that's just my
[12:07] opinion
[12:10] there's a great need in the body of
[12:11] christ to understand how to carefully
[12:13] listen to god's prophet william branham
[12:16] there's two groups on the fringe that
[12:18] are off the narrow road or the correct
[12:20] path
[12:21] one dangerous fringe listens to brother
[12:23] branham and makes every word on the tape
[12:25] thus saith the lord this is a great heir
[12:28] this is a great sin this is a heresy
[12:31] for it rejects the necessity of needing
[12:33] the bible to validate every teaching
[12:36] belief prediction or statement
[12:38] the other dangerous fringe is listening
[12:40] to brother rams tapes but never quoting
[12:42] from them and never giving brother adam
[12:44] credit for the revelations and teachings
[12:46] god gave to him
[12:48] this group is afraid to acknowledge
[12:50] god's prophet messenger for this day
[12:53] they quote the bible which is wonderful
[12:55] and absolutely necessary but fail to
[12:57] mention god's vindicated servant brother
[12:59] branham
[13:00] remember what paul said in second
[13:02] timothy 1 verse 8 he asked timothy and
[13:04] those that were under timothy's
[13:06] leadership to not be ashamed of paul
[13:09] and so that's how we are today we are
[13:11] not ashamed of paul nor are we ashamed
[13:14] of brother branham god's prophet for
[13:16] this day
[13:17] be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[13:19] testimony of our lord nor of me as
[13:22] prisoner but be thou partaker of the
[13:24] afflictions of the gospel according to
[13:26] the power of god
[13:28] so the group who is balanced and right
[13:30] down the middle of the road so to speak
[13:32] is not ashamed to be followers of god's
[13:34] seventh church age messenger brother
[13:36] branham but they're also careful to
[13:38] rightly divide the tapes
[13:40] as brother branham taught us
[13:42] and brother bran plainly said if there's
[13:43] a mistake on the tape or a mix-up on the
[13:45] tape as he called it look in the bible
[13:49] other day i got something mixed up i
[13:50] happen to hear it yes i called it right
[13:52] there and it's on the tape
[13:54] i probably hear from it when i was
[13:55] talking about the seven trumpets
[13:57] it was a great teaching i didn't touch
[13:59] the edge of it but if you happen to
[14:01] catch that on your tape remember look in
[14:03] the bible you see it's seven
[14:05] months after that
[14:07] remember that brother branham taught us
[14:09] in the church age book that john the
[14:11] baptist and brother branham needed no
[14:13] greater honor than what jesus gave them
[14:16] so we certainly honor john the baptist
[14:18] and brother branham for having the
[14:20] spirit of elijah for being prophets and
[14:22] messengers forerunners of jesus christ
[14:26] but we also must remember john's words
[14:28] when he said
[14:30] he jesus must increase but i the prophet
[14:33] must decrease
[14:35] this doesn't mean we'll ever forget
[14:37] about brother branham or we'll stop
[14:39] quoting brother branham but the emphasis
[14:41] has to be on jesus christ who is the
[14:43] word
[14:44] examples of brother branham being
[14:46] corrected and his openness to being
[14:48] corrected
[14:49] brother branham was a humble holy
[14:51] ghost-filled christian and he was open
[14:53] to being corrected at almost any time
[14:56] you'll see now how he says he was
[14:57] corrected by the holy spirit his wife
[15:00] other brothers a woman in the prayer
[15:02] line
[15:03] and was open to being corrected by
[15:05] anyone in this home church as long as it
[15:07] was done in a godly manner
[15:10] he also wanted deacons who would not be
[15:12] puppets and agree with everything he
[15:14] said
[15:15] brother branham appreciated men with
[15:17] differing opinions
[15:19] listen as brother branham says the holy
[15:21] ghost corrected him on the first seal
[15:24] no
[15:26] i would have absolutely
[15:30] today
[15:31] and i hope that people are spiritual
[15:35] i would have had a horrible mistake on
[15:38] that if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock
[15:40] the day when the holy spirit came in the
[15:43] room and corrected me on something that
[15:45] i was writing down to faith
[15:49] listen here how brother branham said his
[15:51] wife was his correction and married men
[15:53] would know what he's talking about
[15:56] now my wife she's my
[15:59] correction you know brethren what
[16:02] i'm talking about
[16:05] listen as brother branham was corrected
[16:06] by other brothers such as brother
[16:08] sherrod
[16:09] one time i thought it was right to
[16:11] receive a prayer someone give you
[16:14] brother
[16:15] man
[16:16] corrected me on that brother
[16:18] i hate to correct you on anything
[16:21] but you're mistaken there
[16:23] that you call those people but not
[16:25] receiving their faith you call them to
[16:28] lose
[16:29] their reward
[16:31] he said it's more blessed to give
[16:36] listen here how brother branham let a
[16:38] brother correct him in front of other
[16:40] brothers in 1961 questions and answers
[16:44] so it isn't the star isn't messiah
[16:48] he's just reflecting the messiah
[16:51] now the star does not reflect its own
[16:54] light
[16:55] the star reflects the light of the sun
[16:58] is that right
[17:00] huh
[17:10] now if uh if the star
[17:14] reflecting its light
[17:16] then its light would have to come from
[17:18] the from god
[17:20] because it is a glacier of some sort
[17:23] isn't it
[17:25] huh a sun of itself all for the sun
[17:30] yeah here brother branham says he was
[17:33] open to being corrected by any other
[17:35] brother in his home church
[17:37] and how he also
[17:38] would make time for anyone to correct
[17:40] him even a baptist minister
[17:43] and then i expect you brethren at any
[17:45] time that you see me
[17:47] to get away from this scripture to come
[17:49] to me privately and tell me or i'm wrong
[17:52] i don't care if you're one of the
[17:54] trustees or you're the janitor whoever
[17:56] you are your duty bound to me as a
[17:59] brother in christ to tell me when i'm
[18:02] wrong scripturally if it's a question
[18:05] let's sit down and solve it out together
[18:09] a baptist minister a few weeks ago come
[18:12] up and to my house and said i like
[18:14] straightening out on the god head
[18:15] sometime when he got the time called me
[18:18] up brother i said i got time right now
[18:20] because i want to be straight
[18:22] and we lay aside everything else to do
[18:24] it
[18:26] listen here our brother branham
[18:27] considered it a loving act to correct
[18:30] someone
[18:31] which is what hebrews 12 and proverbs 9
[18:34] verse 8 say
[18:35] this is when the dean of a lutheran
[18:37] college attempted to correct brother
[18:39] branham but the dean was wrong
[18:41] and brother ram said he appreciated
[18:43] being corrected and wanted to be
[18:44] corrected he wanted to be right
[18:47] proverbs 9 verse 8 says reprove not as
[18:49] corner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise
[18:52] man and he will love thee
[18:54] any holy ghost-filled christian will
[18:56] appreciate being corrected
[18:58] because he has the desire in his soul to
[19:00] be guided into all truth by the holy
[19:02] spirit
[19:04] i said i'll forgive you for that because
[19:06] i believe that you didn't understand and
[19:08] i said i love you because
[19:10] that you're interested enough in our
[19:12] lord jesus to try to correct me thinking
[19:14] i'm wrong
[19:15] i said i appreciate that anybody will
[19:17] try to correct me when i'm wrong i i
[19:19] want to be corrected
[19:22] listen as brother branham was corrected
[19:24] by a woman in a prayer line when he
[19:26] misspoke her last name
[19:29] you believe god can tell me what your
[19:30] name is
[19:31] would it make you believe more
[19:34] would be strong
[19:37] [Applause]
[19:43] listen as brother branham welcomed
[19:44] trustees who were not puppets and would
[19:47] disagree with him by their own
[19:51] some time convictions someone was in a
[19:53] dispute uh on a income tax and they said
[19:57] to me he said why your trustees are
[19:59] nothing but puppets i suppose i said if
[20:01] i had a trustee on the board that had a
[20:04] different idea and wouldn't stand up and
[20:06] i don't care who's speaking about it
[20:08] would express his own views of it i
[20:10] threw him off the board yes sir though
[20:12] it was contrary to my belief i want him
[20:14] to express what he thinks is right
[20:16] that's what i got him there for see what
[20:18] he says about it
[20:22] listen here as brother branham
[20:23] appreciated the people in the
[20:24] congregation listening carefully
[20:27] and then listen how he accepted help and
[20:29] correction from brothers while preaching
[20:32] regarding the seven thousand jews who
[20:34] did not bow their need to baal
[20:37] that question this morning i was trying
[20:39] to answer just as honestly as i know how
[20:41] i just read the first part of the verse
[20:43] and it was a wouldn't have been right
[20:45] but
[20:46] the holy spirit understanding and i my
[20:50] mind see look the last two or three days
[20:52] what's been happening the uh i called
[20:55] 700 7700
[20:58] this morning was trying and it's picked
[21:00] up for the people in that show that
[21:02] she's watching
[21:05] now
[21:06] the believers can see the word
[21:09] is made flesh in their generation
[21:14] god speaking
[21:17] about it then real true believers m7 000
[21:20] what's the 700 in days of elijah 7 000
[21:26] listen to this quote as brother branham
[21:28] admits he made a mistake in the feast of
[21:30] the trumpet sermon he knew he would hear
[21:32] about his mistake and he wasn't upset
[21:34] about it but he gave him this great
[21:36] advice to look in the bible
[21:38] and he was especially concerned that the
[21:40] ministers would look in the bible and
[21:41] find the right application of the
[21:44] teaching on the feast of the trumpets
[21:46] the other day i got something mixed up i
[21:48] have to hear it yes i called it right
[21:50] there and it's on the tape
[21:51] i probably hear from it when i was
[21:53] talking about the seven trumpets
[21:55] it was a great teaching i didn't touch
[21:57] the age of it but if you have to catch
[21:59] that on your tape remember look in the
[22:01] bible you see it's seven
[22:03] months after that
[22:04] some minister might pick that up and
[22:06] then you'd have it you see there all
[22:08] right
[22:10] listen here our brother branham
[22:11] appreciated a man who would disagree
[22:12] with him because he was not a pushover
[22:15] how many pushovers do we have today men
[22:17] that falsely say they believe everything
[22:19] brother branham said
[22:21] when brother branham admits not
[22:22] everything he said was infallible or
[22:24] from the lord brother braham said to
[22:26] believe that that he was infallible was
[22:28] tommy rot and one of the most awful
[22:30] things you could believe
[22:32] and uh a big fine man a scholar
[22:37] was staying
[22:38] after the seven seals he said
[22:41] uh brother branham you're being a typhus
[22:43] typologist rather said
[22:45] how in the world
[22:47] are you going to put that church in the
[22:50] rapture
[22:51] without the tribulation period
[22:53] this man comes from a a great a man a
[22:57] great teacher that's a bosom friend of
[23:00] mine
[23:01] very good man
[23:03] and he's a lovely brother
[23:05] uh i'd be garrison to say one word
[23:08] against the brother i wouldn't anyhow as
[23:10] a as a christian i wouldn't say nothing
[23:12] against him
[23:13] he don't agree with me on that one
[23:15] subject but
[23:17] he's my precious brother we eat together
[23:19] and always just a damn you fella i take
[23:22] his magazine read his articles and he
[23:24] writes some of mine
[23:26] so forth and i've talked many texts out
[23:28] of what i i've already read his article
[23:31] sure he's saying
[23:32] he's a great man
[23:34] but he he just can't agree with me i
[23:36] appreciate that uh his sincerity though
[23:39] you don't just want his pushover just
[23:41] has to grieve everything he's saying
[23:43] he's got his own convictions
[23:45] and he stands for i appreciate that and
[23:48] he's a good man of oh i'm not a teacher
[23:52] a scholar at all but this man's full
[23:54] teacher and scholar but i i can't agree
[23:56] with him because i don't see it
[23:58] but it doesn't pertain to salvation is
[24:02] pertaining to the coming of the lord
[24:05] they're claiming here that some brethren
[24:07] up there that said that i sent them up
[24:09] there and they're preaching that man
[24:11] should leave their wives and hunt for
[24:12] their spiritual mate
[24:14] and that
[24:16] that i am perfectly infallible
[24:18] that there's nothing
[24:20] and over some of the office things
[24:21] you've ever heard and the ministerial
[24:23] association
[24:24] got a hold of it and they're writing me
[24:26] a letter about it
[24:28] and um but i sent them up there and it's
[24:31] causing a lot of confusion and some of
[24:33] them prophesying and saying if one man
[24:35] should leave this wife and go marry that
[24:37] one this church knows that we don't
[24:39] stand for no such tommy rod is that we
[24:42] believe in the bible
[24:45] listen as brother branham hoped men
[24:47] would come after him and make more sense
[24:49] of the message
[24:51] it had been since luther first brought
[24:53] the first reformation
[24:55] i hope that's simple enough that you can
[24:57] understand it
[24:58] these men if they pick up this and goes
[25:00] out with it they can make more sense to
[25:02] it see to bring it to a place you would
[25:04] i just want to lay this seat but i hope
[25:06] they make it come to life
[25:09] and of course we know many men have
[25:11] misused this quote but brother brahms
[25:13] still desired this and knew men would do
[25:15] it who were anointed of the same holy
[25:17] ghost and could rightly divide the word
[25:19] of truth
[25:20] as brother brahm said that was the most
[25:21] important thing for our day is a man
[25:24] anointed the holy ghost who could
[25:25] rightly divide the word of god
[25:28] now
[25:29] to bring up this faith in christ
[25:31] there's ministers
[25:33] that's the most important thing in the
[25:35] day
[25:36] is a good god-sent preacher
[25:39] i admire them and their gift is far
[25:43] beyond
[25:44] anything can be done in anything else as
[25:46] a preacher
[25:47] a man who knows how to rightly divide
[25:48] the word of god
[25:50] the most wonderful gift in the world
[25:53] is to be a minister
[25:56] how close the human side was to the
[25:59] divine side
[26:02] i want to start with this quote from the
[26:03] god of this evil age
[26:05] brother branham says thus saith the lord
[26:08] that a woman that cuts her hair is
[26:10] spiritually dead no matter how much she
[26:12] runs speaks in tongues dances or shouts
[26:16] and that is true according to first
[26:18] corinthians chapter 11
[26:20] because she's disgraced her head her
[26:22] husband and that also disgraces christ
[26:25] and god
[26:26] but notice in the very next breath after
[26:28] he says that's thus saith the lord the
[26:30] word of god brother randall quotes the
[26:32] wrong scripture he quotes first
[26:34] corinthians 14 but actually the
[26:36] scripture about hair is first
[26:38] corinthians 11. let's listen to the
[26:40] quote
[26:41] if she cuts at all i don't care how much
[26:43] she dances sings sit in the choir speaks
[26:47] in tongues runs up and down who has all
[26:49] kind of aids society she's dead
[26:54] that's thus saith the lord
[26:57] the word of god first corinthians 14
[27:03] so friends here you can see how
[27:05] the human side and divine side were
[27:07] sometimes just one breath away so we've
[27:10] got to be very careful
[27:12] even on quotes that say thus saith the
[27:13] lord we must be very careful how we
[27:16] interpret them and understand them
[27:18] there's numerous other quotes from
[27:20] brother branham that we've got to
[27:21] rightly divide it seemed to say he was
[27:24] speaking with the holy spirit's
[27:25] authority but now that time has passed
[27:27] we can see brother branham was just
[27:29] hoping
[27:30] these dreams or opinions were from the
[27:32] holy spirit
[27:33] and we realize now that they weren't
[27:35] they were just brother adam's human
[27:37] opinions
[27:38] first brother branham said the spirit
[27:39] told him to say joseph was a prophet
[27:42] but later there's a quote where brother
[27:43] graham says that's just my prayer anyhow
[27:46] brother branham also said he hoped
[27:48] joseph would have double times double
[27:50] the gifts that he had
[27:51] everything that he had and of course we
[27:53] know joseph has not done one prayer line
[27:56] like his father nor has he traveled 28
[27:58] times around the world nor spoken 28
[28:01] squirrels into existence
[28:03] so we see how this was just brother
[28:04] brahms desire he thought it was the holy
[28:07] spirit but brother brahm never spoke
[28:09] that joseph was a prophet with thus
[28:11] saith the lord
[28:13] when i dedicate him to the lord the
[28:14] morning there's many little babies
[28:16] standing in the head mothers with him
[28:17] along the altar when i picked up joseph
[28:20] in my arms not thinking of what he's
[28:22] saying i said joseph my son thou art a
[28:25] prophet
[28:27] that's my prayer anyhow and i believe
[28:29] it'll be
[28:31] god will take everything that he ever
[28:33] give me and double times devil and put
[28:35] on that boy that will not leave
[28:37] that he'll take my place
[28:39] when i picked him up the spirit caught
[28:41] me and said joseph my son you are a
[28:43] prophet
[28:45] god let my spirit come in a double
[28:46] portion on my son
[28:48] when i come to the end of the road and i
[28:50] can't go no farther i want to hand this
[28:52] bible to joseph and say honey don't you
[28:54] don't shoot compromise on one word stay
[28:57] true to god if it takes everything there
[28:59] is you stay true to god
[29:02] friends christians deal with this often
[29:04] they think something that they feel or
[29:06] desire is from the lord but if there is
[29:09] no silent thus saith the lord then we've
[29:11] got to be humble
[29:12] and admit that perhaps that was just our
[29:14] opinion
[29:15] another example is that in the church
[29:16] age book brother branham said the 1977
[29:19] prediction was issued with divine
[29:21] inspiration
[29:22] so we can clearly see how brother graham
[29:24] thought this was inspired of the lord
[29:25] but now that time has passed
[29:27] 1977 has come and gone and the
[29:30] millennium has not been ushered in so we
[29:32] see again how we have to be very careful
[29:34] to separate the human side from the
[29:36] divine side because america was not in a
[29:39] state where only tree stumps were left
[29:42] due to total annihilation
[29:44] so i repeat
[29:45] i sincerely believe and maintain as a
[29:47] private student of the word
[29:49] along with divine inspiration
[29:52] that 1977 ought to terminate the world
[29:54] systems and usher in the millennium
[29:57] and that i predict now this is not the
[30:00] lord saying this the other about the
[30:02] woman in his is the lord but i predicted
[30:05] in 1936
[30:08] 33 that the world would be total
[30:11] annihilation before 77. so i didn't know
[30:15] that if they had something that could
[30:16] annihilate it like they got now but i
[30:18] seen the nation in total annihilation
[30:21] just stumps and trees and things like
[30:24] that
[30:26] another example is brother branham
[30:28] saying that a sister's dream about him
[30:30] dying by gunshot was from the holy
[30:33] spirit
[30:34] let's listen to that let's remember
[30:36] brother brown did not die by gunshot
[30:38] heading into a church service and
[30:40] remember brother branham seemed to agree
[30:41] with this by saying
[30:49] waiting that uh-huh
[30:50] when it's finished
[30:54] some sister just had a dream
[30:56] she sent it to me and said i seen him at
[30:58] church
[30:59] fixed away
[31:00] he's going to kill me secretly sometimes
[31:02] i'm getting out of my car going in and
[31:04] be fired
[31:05] but so then the spirit said not at this
[31:06] time but it'll come later
[31:09] ever
[31:10] god forbid that i compromise on anything
[31:14] a final thought about this is that jesus
[31:17] disciples thought that john would not
[31:19] die
[31:20] according to john 21 verses 22 and 23
[31:24] this is a good example how jesus's own
[31:26] disciples
[31:27] could misunderstand something he said
[31:29] and the saying went abroad among them
[31:32] that was a misunderstanding that john
[31:34] would live to see the coming of the lord
[31:36] so we thank the lord for that example to
[31:38] again prove to us we have to be very
[31:40] careful what we make divine
[31:42] make sure we separate the human side
[31:43] from the divine side among prophets and
[31:46] really among all christians
[31:48] in closing
[31:50] i hope this video has been a blessing
[31:52] friends and i hope you're able to see
[31:53] how brother braham was always open to
[31:55] correction he knew he had a human side
[31:57] and a divine side friends we have the
[32:00] same if we're born again we have a
[32:02] divine side the baptism of the holy
[32:04] ghost in our souls a portion of god's
[32:07] own eternal life and we have a human
[32:09] side and of course we're not all
[32:11] prophets very few of us actually are but
[32:14] we still get words from the lord rather
[32:15] through dreams
[32:17] visions or other gifts that god gives us
[32:20] so we must be very careful what we make
[32:22] divine as something from the lord
[32:25] we must always be open to correction in
[32:28] humility
[32:29] second peter 3 verse 18 says but grow in
[32:32] grace and in the knowledge of our lord
[32:35] and savior jesus christ knowledge means
[32:38] a mature understanding so we must
[32:40] constantly grow in our understanding of
[32:42] the ways of the lord
[32:44] paul also said in philippians 1 verse 9
[32:47] and this i pray that your love may
[32:49] abound yet more and more in knowledge
[32:52] and in all judgment
[32:54] paul's prayer as a prophet
[32:56] was that christians would abound in love
[32:59] in knowledge which is understanding and
[33:01] in judgment which is discerning
[33:04] because the devil is like a roaring lion
[33:06] seeking whom he may devour we must
[33:09] constantly grow in love for christ and
[33:11] his word in understanding of the word
[33:14] and also in discerning between the true
[33:16] spirit and the false spirit we know if
[33:18] we're born again christ will help us do
[33:20] that for he said he will guide us into
[33:22] all truth if you have any questions
[33:24] concerns or testimonies about this video
[33:27] please contact me
[33:29] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[33:32] the desire of your heart
