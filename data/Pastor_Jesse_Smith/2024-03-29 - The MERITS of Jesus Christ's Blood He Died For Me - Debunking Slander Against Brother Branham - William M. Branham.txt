TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I'm not sinless I got plenty hanging on me but every hour I confess it constantly I going on the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ he died for me greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video on Good Friday 2024 is to show how God's true Prophet brother Bram trusted in the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ and so does every genuine Christian who is saved today on this wonderful day that we remember the amazing work of our Lord Jesus Christ dying for our sins hi friends I'm Pastor Jesse Smith I pastored bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA for about the last 18 years June will be our 18th anniversary by God's grace and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his true Prophet The Late William brandham 1909 to 1965 and I defend brother bram's Godly genuine Christian character today's video is defending brother bram's Godly Christian character as we hear from his own mouth his worship of Jesus Christ his solemn trust in Jesus Christ his true understanding that he could only trust in the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ this video is defending brother brandham against all the obvious slander against brother brandham from the believe the slander group and all those those groups associated with them and I say that humbly but that's what these people are guilty of they're guilty of slandering God's Prophet brother Brenham jumping to obvious false conclusions and hopefully this video will encourage each and every person to trust in the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ so I'll start off with some wonderful quotes and then we'll go in chronological order by God's grace the first quote is from 1963 identification brother brandom said I'm trusting solemnly in Jesus Christ he said I go in on the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ he died for me so notice brother Brandon wasn't trusting in his Merit he was trusting in the Merit of the blood of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote I'm not sinless I got plenty hanging on me but every hour I confess it constantly when I see my wrong then I turn from that and try to do what's right I wouldn't try to go to heaven on my merits I wouldn't get there I'm trusting solemnly in Jesus Jesus Christ he is my trust I I I believe in him I wouldn't try to go in because I'm a Pentecostal brother I wouldn't go going on the merits of Pentecost I go in on the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ he died for me and that's what I want you to trust the merits of him and then how you know you're getting there is when every word is you punctuate with an amen amen because it's a word itself trying to vindicate itself and if we deny that word how can it vindicate itself in the second quote brother random said he's not saved by his feelings he's saved because God gave the promise of Salvation and he met God's conditions and now based upon God's holy word brother random can defeat Satan seven days in a week because it's God's word let's listen to the quote listen Brethren you're never saved by any sign you're never saved by any sensation you're saved when you meet God's condition of his work and nothing else are you saved by right God's word has made way you're not saved because you feel like you're saved I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved because a lot of times I don't feel that way but I'm saved because God gave the promise I met God's conditions enough on God's holy word I can defeat Satan seven days in a week and as many nights because it's God's word he that Hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come to judgment but pass from Death to life that's what the King of Kings said you believe it here's another quote I love the invasion of the United States 1954 brother brandom said if the people are coming to see me they're lost yet he said let us exalt Christ so here again we see brother brandom exalting Jesus Christ humbling himself let's listen to the quote ah sometimes I think of my Ministry and see people coming I get in a hotel room say God who who's the people coming to see me or you see if they're coming to see me they're lost yet but oh God tear me down take me away I want to represent you the one who will stand before someday with trembling hands and trembling feeble body looking at you knowing my soul hangs be your decision let us exalt Christ Now by God's grace we're going to go chronologically we'll start in 1955 brother brandom said he's protected by the blood of Jesus Christ God doesn't see his sins because of the blood of Jesus Christ though his sins be like Scarlet God's looking through the shed blood of Calvary at brother brandom of course this reminds us of Isaiah 1:18 though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be white as snow let's listen to the quote I come to him no matter what you think about me as long as I'm under the blood I'm protected by the blood God don't see my sins he looks through the blood of Jesus Christ and through my sins may be like scared they look white to the almighty God because he's looking through the shed blood of Calvary don't you want it tonight wouldn't you love to be in that state the next quote is from the junction of time 1956 brother Bram said daily I trust in thee knowing that daily I sin I confess my wrongs and accept thee my Lord such a beautiful quote brother random acknowledges he sins every day but he's trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ confessing his sins every day reminding us of 1 John 17-10 the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins to cleanse us from all unrighteousness let's listen to the quote what a day of rejoicing that will be when Jesus our lord returns we realize that we're so thankful to be living in this day and God I Repent of everything annoying that we could not live in ourselves Lord but we're we're Sinners to begin with and daily I trust in thee knowing that daily I sin knowing that daily things happen to me and in my life that you would not be pleased with now I confess my wrong and accept thee my Lord as my own soul lays at the altar this morning morning at this little Tabernacle prostrate here Lord oh God I failed you back down Earth with those Divine gifts as you showed so miraculous 1956 contending for the faith brother Brandon says it's God's grace that saves us he said we confess our wrongs brother Bram said there's none without sin every day you sin Paul said he had to Die daily of course this reminds us of 1 Corinthians 15:31 where Paul said he died daily and also Ephesians 28-10 for by grace are ye saved through faith brother brandom said it's Grace God's grace that saves us let's listen to the quote we're tempted all of us are tempted all of us sin there's none without sin every day you sin Paul said he had to Die daily and if we say we sin and have no sin then the Bible says we make God to lie and we could not do that so we sin daily and it's Grace God's grace that saves us and as we confess our Wongs God's just to forgive them and your your confession as long as it holds Good your salvation is perfect same as it with Divine Healing it's your personal faith in a resurrected Lord Jesus next 1957 the mighty conqueror brother brandom said I'm so glad that my book up in heaven my name is on his register I'm so glad that my sins are under the blood pardoned by his own precious blood the word pardoned in the New Testament is often translated as remitted so brother ramam said I'm so glad my sins are remitted by the precious blood of Jesus Christ Matthew 26:28 Jesus said this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins brother Brandon was trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ his sins were remitted let's listen to the quote the prophets and Saints looked on and recogniz him sure they were waiting for him oh he said children get get ready we're going out of here bless the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord I'm so glad that my book is on my up in heaven my name is on his register I'm so glad that my sins are under the blood been signed pardon by his own precious blood I'm so glad that I know him I'm sure that every Christian can say Amen to that amen I'm so glad that one of these mornings he'll come for us 1959 what does thou hear Brother brandom Saidi so happy that I know him in the Forgiveness of my sins with the assurance that my sins are under the blood as I confess them daily to him again it goes with 1 John 17-10 he confessed his sins Jesus was faithful to forgive him and then the Lord's Prayer Matthew 6 11-12 give us this day our daily bread so daily prayers for provision and also forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors let's listen to the quote I'm so happy that I know him in the Forgiveness of my sins and with the assurance that my sins are under the blood as I confess them daily to him next quote 1960 brother brandham says all our sins we were put on him and he will be our attorney at the Judgment bar he said I'm so glad I've confessed all my sins to him some 30 years ago this reminds us of 1 John 2 1-3 we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous he's the propit tuation for our sins that means wrath Bearer or taker of God's Wrath that should have went to us he was the perpetuation for the sins of the whole world brother brandham recognized this brother brandham had an advocate Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote what will take place at that day if our sins are not under the blood it'll be a terrible day for many and a glorious day for many for it'll be the day of rejoicing for those who have accepted our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ then all of our sins will be put upon him and he will be our attorney at the bar I'm so glad to know tonight as a testimony that I have confessed all my sins to him some 30 years ago and have been on the field trying to represent him to people as a real attorney who can plead the case so perfect until God forgives every sin and sends back the Seal of his recognition to us to be Sons and Daughters of his the Holy Spirit to give us witness 1961 one of the meanest men in town brother brandom said if he would have been The Courier that brought Jesus to Simon the Pharisees house he said the first first thing he would have said to Jesus would have been Lord be merciful to me a sinner of course this reminds us of the Publican in Luke 1813 and 14 he smed his breast and said God be merciful to me a sinner and that man went to his home Justified declared righteous so we see brother randam had the same attitude the same humility as his Publican from jesus' Parable let's listen to the quote I've often thought what if I could have been that Courier but he said my master has uh give you an honor he's having a great feast and he wants you to be his uh special guest at this feast and we would uh like for you to promise us that you would meet us on such and such a day it's may be an annual of fair and and out of all the men he chose you to come you know I believe if I'd have been standing there that close to the Lord Jesus I'd have forgot all about what Simon had told me to say the first thing I would have said been Lord be merciful to me yeah a sinner but that's way many of us get we feel that our daily task and what our work calls for is more more important than anything else I believe if we're ever in the presence of God our Earthly prage our Earthly Associates our message or our work should be last let's get our confession out to him oh I'd love to have fell down at his feet there and said I have a message from my master but first I got a message too be merciful me oh God I'm a sinner now I know that thou art the Son of God and I've long for this opportunity and now I'm kneeling here at your feet be merciful to me next 1962 possessing all things brother brandom ask is your sins under the blood by faith tonight in Christ Jesus and again this goes with Ephesians 2 8-10 we're saved by grace through faith and then brother random quotes John 52 2 4 he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death into life let's listen to the quote is your sins are the blood by faith tonight in Christ Jesus we shall now take the communion not the communion you commune as you eat with one another just commune with God the communion is not the bread not the wine the communion is talking back and forth with God Amen this is a symbol that we take that we believe in his death broken embody his burial and Resurrection we believe in the presence of the Holy Spirit and we believe that he has given us eternal life and we cannot die we have passed from Death un life and someday when we separate from one another here we'll rise again in the resurrection with each other joar together with Christ Jesus as a body amen hallelujah upon these bases in the confession of my sins and my faith in the Son of God I take myself in the church before these articles that God left for us to do to show forth his death until he comes amen next in the seventh seal 1963 brother brandham said you forget anything about me I'm your brother a sinner saved by grace not fit to live it's exactly the truth I ain't saying that to be humble he said be a gem in the crown of Jesus Christ and Something Told brother brandham it's the word that matters and of course this reminds us of Romans 7:2 24:25 St Paul said oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let's listen to the quote May you always bear that in mind to be a gem in the crown of Jesus Christ Paul said to the church you are you are the jewels or gems of his crown we want to be the gems of the crown of Jesus Christ we don't want never put a man in it you forget anything about me I am your brother a sinner saved by grace not fit to live that's exactly the truth and I say that to be humble that's facts there's nothing in me not one sound thing at all but the grace of God has let my poor Deming eyes look beyond the curtain of power and see those things I I come back when I was a little boy I love people I always want somebody to love me and talk to me nobody would do it because of the name of the family nobody talked to me but when I made my surrender to God than our people background being Irish I thought maybe there's all Catholic maybe that would be I went there he is some way and I went out to First Baptist Church and he is another way I said Lord there's got to be some ways true and something said it's a word amen I've helped that word look at every Vision every word the day I laid that Cornerstone on and put that in there I wrote on there what he show me that morning in a vision Here's the final quote from God hiding himself in Simplicity preach in Albuquerque 63 preached on Good Friday brother brandom said what did he do Jesus humbled himself to death on Good Friday afternoon that he might rise on Easter Sunday to send back the Holy Spirit these signs shall follow them that believe and brother Brandon preached on the blood of Jesus Christ acting like a bleach to totally cleanse our sins and he said the blood of Jesus Christ so thoroughly cleanses us and then Jesus promises us a better life the baptism of the Holy Ghost my there's so many wonderful scriptures in here Isaiah 534 and5 he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities with his stripes we are healed Mark 165-18 these signs shall follow them that believe Jude 1:24 he's able to present you faultless before the presence of his glory and then acts 1:5 Jesus said ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence let's listen to the quote smitten and stricken and yet we did Estee him smitten and stricken sure of God but he was wounded for our transgressions the Clorox came he was bruised for our iniquities the chasm of our peace is up on him and with his stripes we were healed what did he do humble himself to death on Good Friday afternoon that he might rise on Easter Sunday Amen to send back the Holy Spirit upon the church with a double potion of it that we might do the same things that he do that he did he promised these signs will follow them at believe and how far we get away from him by our Traditions there you are God hiding himself in humility read revealing himself in power that's the way God does it that's God's program of doing it yesterday he may bring Sons across this Chasm Lord Jesus in the way of humility in the way of humbleness I offer you this congregation that's on their feet I offer them to you because they have stood in response to the call they're seeking deeper things they're seeking more life after hearing that the blood of Jesus so thoroughly cleanses that there's no more nothing that the complete word of God rests within them that the very command of their own voice is creative power because in them is the Holy Ghost and this Holy Ghost is a Creator he makes things comes to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes God in action and Lord I pray that you'll send the Holy Ghost upon every one of them just now and deliver unto them Lord in the power of the resurrection of Christ the things that they are Desiring in their heart a better life the baptism of the spirit Lord may it be so that this audience will be illuminated the hearts of the people will see the vision and be filled with the power of God I command them to you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ in closing friends I hope this video was a bless in here on Good Friday 2024 I've just been studying about Calvary Jesus's death burial and resurrection and these quote stuck out to me and I just thought it was very appropriate to show how brother brandham a true prophet of God was constantly magnifying Jesus Christ he was exalting Jesus Christ trusting in the Merit of Jesus Christ and not his own Merit again all these Slanders of brother brandham they fail to see these quotes they fail to recognize these quotes they strain in a nap and swallow a camel they choose to slander rather than to show mercy of course they're slandering because they're jumping to false conclusions Proverbs 10:18 says he that hideth hatred with lying lips and he that utth a slander is a fool so clearly those who slander brother brandom unjustly are fools according to the Bible and this is why they don't study out the other side Proverbs 18:13 said he that anth a matter before he heareth it it is a Folly and shame unto him him so shame and Folly upon these people who jump to false conclusions against God's Prophet brother Brenham who is pointing everyone including himself to Jesus Christ to look and live to Jesus Christ remember the Bible says the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God in 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 that includes revilers or those who speak evil slander against the true Servants of God but thankfully those who speak slander can be washed can be Sanctified and justified in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God if they repent friends remember the word of God Romans 8: 33-34 who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us so if brother brandham is God's elect Prophet for this hour and he's elect to Salvation who are these slanderers who can bring a charge against brother brand and who are these Slanders to bring a charge against message believers who are trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ of course Paul's questions are basically saying no one can lay any charge to the account of God's elect because of the blood of Jesus Christ no one can condemn a forgiven Christian because there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so let's Rejoice on this holy weekend we'd say of course we know every weekend's holy but this is a special time a year remembering the blood of Jesus Christ and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and then the subsequent sending of the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
