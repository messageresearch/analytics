[37:45] he went into a ship and
[37:47] sacked and the whole multitude stood on
[37:50] the

[37:53] about that they must have stood a long
[37:54] time they must just been standing there

[37:57] time so we got it pretty easy right we
[37:59] get to sit all the service they just sit

[38:21] Parables saying Behold a sword went
[38:24] forth to seow I'm going to skip down to
[38:26] verse 10 down to verse 10 and the
[38:28] disciples came and said to him why
[38:30] speakest thou unto them in
[38:32] Parables and he answered and said unto
[38:34] them because it is given unto you to
[38:35] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[38:36] heaven but to them it is not given
[38:40] praise God let's bow our heads for a
[38:41] word of prayer have a need on your heart

[39:24] in us tonight and speak to us to word in
[39:27] Jesus Christ's name the church said amen
[39:30] God bless you being see that praise the
[39:32] Lord so uh you know I'm going to just
[39:35] review a little bit from Sunday I kind
[39:37] of looked at this I kind of had time on
[39:39] this week you know to kind of look at
[39:41] just some pictures and do a little
[39:42] slides remember Sunday night I did not
[39:43] have a slideshow for you so I tried to
[39:45] work on that this week by the grace of
[39:47] the Lord but uh we saw how the Bible
[39:50] said the mysteries of God were finished
[39:52] amen when that book came down the open
[39:54] book and the and the angel came down the
[39:57] mighty Angel and thundered out seven
[39:59] Thunders the Bible said the mysteries of
[40:01] God were finished praise the Lord so
[40:04] Sunday uh kind of read our text a little
[40:06] bit here Su I just want to review we had
[40:09] 10 or 11 Bible Mysteries the more I
[40:11] think about the more I think it's just
[40:13] 10 but it could be now the reason I
[40:15] think it's 10 is because 10 plus the
[40:16] seven I'm going to preach tonight is 17
[40:18] and you got a lot of good 17s in the
[40:20] Bible okay you got Revelation 107
[40:23] there's 10 and the Seven you have the
[40:25] day of atonement on the 10th day the
[40:26] seventh month yes got some good ons
[40:28] there were 17 Nations on the day of
[40:30] Pentecost that received the water
[40:32] baptism in Jesus Christ's name lot of
[40:34] good 17s in the Bible so that's why I
[40:37] lean more towards that because I can't
[40:39] find many 18s so if I miss that pardon
[40:41] me but I believe you know we have 10 or
[40:43] 11 Bible defined Mysteries and if the
[40:46] Bible said the Mysteries would be
[40:47] finished by the seventh angel then the
[40:49] the the the Mysteries God says are
[40:52] mysteries in the Bible should be
[40:54] finished we should understand them yeah
[40:56] and church we'll see tonight every one
[40:58] of these by God's grace the 10 that we
[41:00] went through on Sunday night and the
[41:02] Seven we'll see tonight all of them we
[41:03] understand by the grace of God so are
[41:05] the Mysteries finished or not you tell
[41:07] me yes the Mysteries are finished praise
[41:10] the Lord so number one is the blindness
[41:14] The Mystery of the blindness of Israel
[41:15] and the Gentile dispensation we went
[41:17] over this on Sunday I'm just GNA kind of
[41:18] fly through these These are in Romans
[41:21] chapter 11 by God's grace most you
[41:23] remember that we read that Romans 11 on
[41:25] Sunday night number two is the mystery
[41:27] of the one body of elect Jews and
[41:30] Gentiles that have received Christ the
[41:32] blood of Jesus Christ breaks down the
[41:34] middle P or partition dividing Jews and
[41:37] Gentiles and we're all one body in Jesus
[41:39] Christ those that believe in Jesus
[41:41] Christ are filled with the Holy Ghost
[41:43] we're one body amen glory there's no
[41:45] more dividing praise the Lord number
[41:47] three The Mystery of the New Testament
[41:49] Church as the bride of Christ now the
[41:51] other one is Ephesians 2 and3 on the one
[41:53] body Jews and Gentiles this is uh
[41:55] Ephesians chapter 5 the New Testament
[41:58] church is called The Bride of Jesus
[41:59] Christ and as you study the Bible the
[42:01] bride has to make herself ready for the
[42:03] marriage supper amen that's what we're
[42:05] looking for that's what's going to take
[42:06] place during the tribulation
[42:08] tribulations here on Earth marriage
[42:09] supper going on in heaven amen Number
[42:12] Four The Mystery of the catching away of
[42:14] the New Testament Church which is called
[42:16] The Rapture in our layman terms but the
[42:18] Bible calls it catching away or caught
[42:21] up amen that's another great mystery
[42:23] that's in 1 Thessalonians 4 and 1 I'm
[42:26] sorry 1 Corinthians 15 praise the Lord
[42:29] number five the mystery of Christ in The
[42:32] Believer Colossians 1:26 and 27 Christ
[42:35] in you the hope of glory amen the
[42:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's a real
[42:39] important mystery praise God most people
[42:41] are deceived they think you shake a hand
[42:42] you're born again that's because they
[42:44] don't know the mystery church but we
[42:46] know the mystery amen glory that gives
[42:49] us a special relationship with the Lord
[42:51] as we said makes us the bride because we
[42:53] are born again number six the Mist of
[42:56] godliness I believe that's a statue of
[42:57] perect man there's one quote where
[42:59] brother R says Christ is the mystery of
[43:00] godliness and I agree with that because
[43:02] Christ had to come and restore godliness
[43:04] that's I believe that and we'll see that
[43:06] quote tonight but godliness is defined
[43:08] by Peter who says add your faith virtue
[43:11] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[43:14] brotherly kindness and charity so I
[43:16] believe true godliness is restored
[43:18] through the statute of pervert man amen
[43:20] I believe that because that's what Peter
[43:21] said add to this add to that add to that
[43:23] then he said an entrance will be made to
[43:25] you and the kingdom of God glory all
[43:29] right number seven The Mystery of the
[43:30] Seven Stars which are the seven Church
[43:32] AG Messengers amen that's Revelation 1
[43:35] verse 20 that was a great mystery for
[43:38] those have been revealed to us through
[43:39] the ministry of our Prophet brother
[43:41] Brandon number eight the mystery of God
[43:44] the father and of Christ that's
[43:46] Colossians chapter 2 verse one and two
[43:48] which is the mystery of the godhead
[43:50] Glory we understand that if you don't
[43:52] understand this you're an idolator most
[43:54] in most cases right right unless you're
[43:56] a good Jew and you believe in bism but
[44:00] if not if you're a trinitarian you might
[44:02] not be really know it or understand it
[44:04] but you're an idolator amen because you
[44:06] worship three persons which really has
[44:09] to be three Gods right right because you
[44:11] can't uh it breaks all the Bible
[44:13] scripture it it breaks plain logic but
[44:16] to say God's one person who manifests
[44:17] himself in three ways makes plenty of
[44:19] sense because I'm one person and I'm a
[44:21] father son and a brother that's right
[44:23] I'm also more than that I'm a pastor
[44:25] teacher husband I'm a lot more than that
[44:27] I'm a friend I'm all these things I'm a
[44:28] lot of things but I'm one person so is
[44:30] God Amen God's not three persons God's
[44:33] one person amen now I say the last two
[44:36] for the uh the sinful ones all the
[44:38] previous eight Mysteries are all good
[44:40] Godly Mysteries but these the mysteries
[44:42] of sinfulness so number nine is the
[44:44] mystery of iniquity and that's in second
[44:46] Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 7 and
[44:49] brother man tells us that's the spirit
[44:50] of the Antichrist that's right remember
[44:52] he tells in the seals there's three
[44:54] there's three phases of that where they
[44:55] work their way you know to the actual
[44:57] man Antichrist uh so we see that by the
[44:59] grace of the Lord I don't remember those
[45:01] right off hand so I'm sorry haven't
[45:02] preached on that lately but I know it it
[45:04] goes from like a saying to a deed to a
[45:07] man or something along that those lines
[45:08] so pardon me but the mystery of iniquity
[45:11] is a mystery of sin okay and number 10
[45:15] our greatest enemy mystery Babylon the
[45:19] Roman Catholic church right remember
[45:21] that brother B said the voice said watch
[45:23] the king of the north but then he come
[45:25] around and said he said but he also said
[45:27] keep your eye on the purple curtain
[45:29] that's right he kept saying keep your
[45:30] eye on the purple curtain purple curtain
[45:32] so we do that by God's grace all right
[45:36] now I spelled a word wrong again so
[45:37] pardon me in my I spelled Mysteries
[45:40] wrong there sorry I just caught my my
[45:42] typ book so remember we close on Sunday
[45:44] night why are the Mysteries so important
[45:45] to us church because if you have the
[45:48] revelation of the Mysteries it helps you
[45:50] keep all the word let's say for Holy
[45:53] Ghost or the SAT of a man God is if you
[45:56] don't have the revelation of those
[45:57] you're not keeping the word for
[45:59] godliness that's right right or for a
[46:01] real Born Again experience you're
[46:02] breaking the word you're just a
[46:04] justification that M born again and
[46:06] you're not right and you don't have the
[46:08] power to to fulfill the word like you
[46:10] ought to if you're really born
[46:12] again oh my glory amen or if you have
[46:16] faith with no virtue you can't live the
[46:17] daily life and all these things like
[46:20] that you can't keep all the word without
[46:22] the revelations being made know why
[46:24] because the Gates of Hell cannot against
[46:26] Revelation amen
[46:29] yes this is scriptural because our
[46:31] sister wedney read this on Sunday night
[46:33] the secret things belong unto the Lord
[46:35] Our God but those things which are
[46:36] revealed belong unto us and to our
[46:38] children why that we might do all the
[46:40] words of this law amen and we apply that
[46:43] that that that principle to the New
[46:46] Testament we know the mystery so Jesus
[46:49] said we can live by every word that
[46:50] proceeds out of the mouth of God glory
[46:53] also the second reason the Mysteries are
[46:55] so important is because the Seed of
[46:57] Abraham are the possessors of Revelation
[47:00] so if you have the revelations it shows
[47:02] you the Seed of Abraham that's what
[47:05] sister Priscilla read for us on Sunday
[47:06] night because God says shall I hide from
[47:09] Abraham that thing which you do I can't
[47:11] hide these things from my
[47:12] friend glory and if he's the father and
[47:15] we're the children of Abraham then we'll
[47:17] do the works of Abraham Jesus said
[47:20] seeing that Abraham shall surely become
[47:21] a great and mighty nation all the
[47:23] nations there shall be blessed in him
[47:25] for I know him that he will command his
[47:28] children and his household after him and
[47:30] they shall keep the way of the Lord to
[47:31] do justice and judgment that the Lord
[47:34] may bring upon abraam that which he has
[47:36] spoken of him Oh Glory that's beautiful
[47:39] church amen so God knew Abraham would
[47:41] keep the word and he commanded the Next
[47:43] Generation now what about the spiritual
[47:45] generation that we are we should keep
[47:47] the word of Abraham and the word of God
[47:48] as well amen the just shall live by his
[47:51] faith he's father of Faith okay let's
[47:54] get to tonight's message praise the the
[47:55] Lord that was an 8 Minute review that's
[47:57] probably my shortest review I ever did
[47:58] in my life right there Glory but it's
[48:01] good to remember church because you know
[48:02] this week don't you forget something
[48:04] sometimes right and you name all the 10
[48:07] Mysteries without me telling you so it's
[48:09] good to know it church it's good to know
[48:10] it's good to review it briefly all right
[48:12] and I'm just you know trying to trying
[48:14] to help everybody remember the more you
[48:15] hear it the more you remember now let's
[48:17] look at these tonight get your Bibles I
[48:19] wonder have some of you read these if
[48:20] you got Bibles handy I want because some
[48:22] of these are just really small portions
[48:24] of scripture the first Parable
[48:28] mystery is the swer who sowed seeds on
[48:32] four grounds or so just calls it the
[48:34] parable the sewer yes I just want to put
[48:36] those four grounds there because it's
[48:38] really important that there's four
[48:39] grounds all right Matthew
[48:43] 13
[48:46] okay now we know
[48:49] uh the stor let's go to 18 let's go to
[48:52] 1318 let's just read that
[48:54] portion
[48:57] all
[48:59] right um and I'll read this one then
[49:01] after that I think they're a little
[49:02] short this one's kind of long so I'll
[49:03] read this one I hate to put a burden
[49:05] like that on somebody Verse 18 now
[49:07] here's uh important part now he tells
[49:09] about the parable the four grounds and
[49:11] the seeds on on on the four grounds now
[49:14] he interprets it for us uh in in verse
[49:18] 18 hear ye the therefore the parable the
[49:21] SE when anyone hear the word of the
[49:23] Kingdom so what are the seeds the seeds
[49:25] are word words of the Kingdom how do the
[49:27] words of the Kingdom get scattered by
[49:29] preachers right yes and understand it
[49:33] not then cometh the wicked one and catch
[49:35] away that which was swn in his heart
[49:38] this is he which receives seed by the
[49:40] wayside I just want to make a statement
[49:42] here I didn't write this down but if you
[49:43] come into a sermon and you walk out not
[49:45] understanding right you better be
[49:47] careful either that was a bad sermon or
[49:51] you need to seek God for understanding
[49:53] because if it's the word of the kingdom
[49:55] and you don't understand it Satan can
[49:57] snatch it out real quick praise the
[50:00] Lord so it's important that you
[50:02] understand what's being preached that's
[50:04] why the Bible said let the women ask
[50:06] their husbands at home right they're
[50:09] supposed to ask they're supposed to
[50:10] understand what's being preached amen
[50:13] glory amen so that's important God likes
[50:17] understanding remember Paul said I'd
[50:19] rather speak five words in a known
[50:20] tongue than 10,000 in an unknown tongue
[50:23] when I'm gathered with the Saints so
[50:25] that you all that all of us understand
[50:28] the word of God
[50:30] Amen okay verse let's finish uh I think
[50:33] we we finish that then cometh the wicked
[50:35] one and catch away that which was swn in
[50:37] his heart this is he which receives seed
[50:39] by the wayside verse 20 but he that
[50:42] receive the seed into Sony places the
[50:44] same as he that heareth the word and and
[50:46] on with joy receiveth it don't we like
[50:50] when people are joyful when they hear
[50:51] the word I like it that's right I like
[50:53] to see people really happy when they
[50:55] preach
[50:56] I like that I like to see him bad I like
[50:58] to see him happy glory and that is what
[51:01] Jesus says here we have another kind of
[51:03] a heart the first heart's a heart that
[51:05] doesn't understand the preaching and so
[51:07] they leave and Satan rips it out of
[51:08] their heart and they don't they don't
[51:10] get blessed by the word the second kind
[51:12] they get excited about the word but look
[51:14] at verse 21
[51:16] yet have he no root in himself so he's
[51:20] not a very deep he has he don't have a
[51:22] real deep experience with God right
[51:24] praise God
[51:26] his roots don't go very deep in
[51:28] Christ but dth for a while for when
[51:32] tribulation or persecutes ariseth
[51:35] because of the word and by and by he's
[51:38] offended the word that he was so happy
[51:41] about now he gets mad at that same word
[51:43] yeah or gets offended what do you mean
[51:45] what do you mean this preacher did this
[51:47] what do you mean the church believes
[51:48] that what do you mean they get offended
[51:50] by the very word they just used to be
[51:52] excited about they used to be oh thank
[51:54] God God a prophet and not what he was no
[51:57] Prophet what do you
[52:00] mean right that right Church Mercy Lord
[52:05] right they used to love that word and
[52:08] joy received it and now they're offended
[52:11] by it don't talk to me about that kind
[52:12] of stuff oh mercy verse 22 he also that
[52:17] receiveth seed among the Thorns this one
[52:19] we got to watch out for those of us who
[52:21] keep coming to church and hanging around
[52:22] the message right yeah this what we got
[52:25] watch out
[52:26] for number 22 he also that receive seed
[52:30] among the Thorns is he that hear the
[52:32] word and the care of this
[52:35] world and the deceitfulness of riches
[52:38] choke the word and he becometh what
[52:43] unfruitful I'm GNA show you that this is
[52:46] the foolish
[52:48] virgin it is I showed you this before
[52:50] I'm going show it to you there brother
[52:52] said there's four classes there's two
[52:54] kinds of believers in four
[52:56] classes I showed you that we're going to
[52:58] show it to you again tonight by the
[53:00] grace of the
[53:01] Lord so look if you don't give the word
[53:04] more importance than riches and cares of
[53:06] the world it will choke the word's
[53:08] influence in your
[53:10] life the word won't be able to breathe
[53:12] it won't won't be able to speak the
[53:14] word hallelujah it won't have life it
[53:17] won't have breath the word can't speak
[53:19] the word it's choked out of it it's
[53:21] strangled to death the word is
[53:23] strangled it can't speak in
[53:26] and people don't see the fruit of the
[53:27] spirit love joy Temperance godliness
[53:30] longsuffering how can we not so
[53:32] longsuffering anymore brother sister the
[53:34] words being choked in my
[53:36] life is that the Bible that's what Jesus
[53:40] taught right
[53:42] exactly um now here's the one we all
[53:45] want to strive for how you g to strive
[53:47] for this one Glory but he that receiveth
[53:50] seed into the good ground is he that
[53:52] Hearth the word amen
[53:55] understands it like I said if you don't
[53:58] understand something preach don't walk
[54:00] away because say and say I don't care I
[54:01] have to understand all that you should
[54:03] do that sat might snatch you out of your
[54:05] heart and you might need that word
[54:07] somewhere along the
[54:09] line I don't care what it's about third
[54:11] seal I'm sorry third po seven seal
[54:14] there's third seal though too that's the
[54:17] only wine Glory T not that Satan amen
[54:21] you understand you see you can't just
[54:24] you should have put the word on such a
[54:25] low esteem we should put the word on the
[54:28] highest esteem amen yes you should email
[54:30] me your questions text me your questions
[54:32] if you don't understand if you're
[54:33] married ask your husband first hopefully
[54:35] he caught it if he can't catch it he can
[54:37] text me Glory but we shouldn't walk out
[54:40] here say well I don't understand it's
[54:42] okay I still love Jesus and things like
[54:44] that no don't get me wrong it's good to
[54:46] love Jesus but we should understand
[54:47] what's being said
[54:50] today now if you understand look at
[54:53] verse 23 says finishing it which also
[54:56] beareth what fruit so one type of
[54:58] Christian cannot bear fruit because they
[55:01] have cares to the world and all these
[55:02] lust and things like that but the real
[55:04] Christian who understands it they can
[55:07] bring forth the fruit of the spirit and
[55:09] they're the one that's born again
[55:12] exactly right that's what brother ra
[55:13] said Remember on Sunday we showed that
[55:15] brother ra said don't judge yourself by
[55:17] how many miracles you can do he said
[55:18] judge yourself by how much fruit you're
[55:21] presently producing that's right because
[55:23] every tree is known by what fruit the
[55:27] fruit of the spirit because if they
[55:29] don't have the Holy Ghost if they don't
[55:30] have the spirit really living in them
[55:32] then they can't produce the right fruit
[55:33] because they don't have the right seed
[55:35] amen right now here's what we need to do
[55:39] beareth fruit and bringeth for some some
[55:42] H hundredfold you imagine a h
[55:44] hundredfold times the seed you
[55:46] SED can you imagine that a hund times
[55:49] what you sewed that's quite a crop I
[55:52] don't I'm not sure which kind of seed
[55:54] produces that but that's that's quite a
[55:55] cop
[55:59] hundredfold some so some Christians will
[56:01] produce hundredfold of what the seeds
[56:04] were swn in their life Glory let's be
[56:06] those kind of Christians amen some
[56:09] 60-fold some 30
[56:12] fold amen how many love the Lord amen
[56:15] now get your it up here if you if you
[56:17] want to I got some notes so this is the
[56:20] foundational Parable mystery like I said
[56:22] I've never preached on these I was
[56:23] really excited to preach this so if you
[56:24] feel my excitement praise the Lord so
[56:26] I'm excited tonight this is the
[56:28] foundational Parable mystery and it's
[56:30] interpreted by our Lord
[56:32] himself which we just read the seed is
[56:35] the word of God because a parallel
[56:37] passage in Luke 8 says the seed is the
[56:39] word and it's also which is the word of
[56:42] the Kingdom same thing so it's preaching
[56:44] of the word now notice now Simon told me
[56:46] this Simon had a good thought he
[56:47] preached this here
[56:49] before Simon noticed kain's ground could
[56:52] not bring forth any fruit in that
[56:54] powerful amen is that powerful the three
[56:58] worst kinds of ground never brought any
[57:00] fruit right the way side the
[57:04] Stony right brother the Stony was Roman
[57:07] Catholics
[57:09] denominationalism so it wasn't way side
[57:11] they got some they got some
[57:14] rejoicing uh but the foolish virgin must
[57:16] be the thorny because they don't bring
[57:19] forth fruit remember Cain was cursed and
[57:21] he said you'll try to plant and sweat
[57:23] but the ground will not bring forth for
[57:25] you and that was the type of his heart
[57:27] his heart will bring forth any fruit
[57:29] unto God any fruit of the spirit praise
[57:32] God why because he he left the Holy
[57:34] Spirit remember the Bible said Cain left
[57:37] the presence of the Lord with an evil
[57:39] countenance remember that so he didn't
[57:42] look like a happy Holy Ghost joyful
[57:44] Christian anymore God help us have the
[57:46] right countenance when we come to church
[57:49] right that's one way you knew Cain was
[57:51] not in one Accord with the Lord his
[57:53] countenance fell towards
[57:55] God you just look at him and say boy he
[57:58] don't really look like he loves the Lord
[57:59] too
[58:00] much oh my that's the Bible Church
[58:03] that's right that's the Bible but Adam's
[58:05] ground did bring forth fruit and that
[58:08] proves that every ground must be
[58:11] prepared and that shows us
[58:14] predestination praise God so the
[58:17] conditions of the ground look the ground
[58:18] was already in the condition when the
[58:20] seed came Glory Church if you're a
[58:22] good-hearted Christian if you're an hon
[58:24] hearted Christian if you're that best BR
[58:27] Christian then God prepared your heart
[58:29] to be in that condition it shows you're
[58:31] predestinated to bring forth 30 60 or
[58:35] 100 let's say praise the Lord amen glory
[58:38] praise the Lord amen because the the
[58:41] ground was already in that condition all
[58:43] four grounds were already in that
[58:45] condition when the SE came so it shows
[58:48] the power of
[58:49] predestination how come your ground can
[58:51] bring forth such things how come their
[58:53] ground canot bring forth such thing it's
[58:55] predestination the ground was ready for
[58:57] it right
[59:00] amen so ground number one is the Wayside
[59:04] the fouls represent the wicked one Jesus
[59:07] said so a bunch of birds always
[59:09] represent evil
[59:11] spirits and his Fallen Angels so this
[59:15] person who's A Wayside hearer does not
[59:18] understand the gospel so evil spirits
[59:21] catch away the word out of his heart and
[59:22] the word can't grow the word can't be
[59:25] watered he'll never be watered because
[59:26] he he didn't understand it and Satan
[59:28] catches way oh just bunch of
[59:30] nonsense that's the that that's the
[59:32] unbeliever right there the total
[59:34] unbeliever okay we just read that the
[59:36] Devil comes and takes away the word out
[59:39] of their hearts lest they should believe
[59:40] and be saved okay the second kind of
[59:42] ground is Stony places this is the
[59:44] longest Parable so that's why it's going
[59:46] kind of slow so pardon me I got I'm
[59:48] gonna get through seven tonight by God's
[59:49] grace all right the Sony places
[59:52] represents the heart that immediately
[59:54] rejoices in the word but has no deepness
[59:56] of Earth or root in
[59:59] himself when tribulation and persecution
[1:00:01] arises represented by the son they're
[1:00:04] offended and wither away you ought to
[1:00:06] Rejoice if you live through tribulation
[1:00:08] amen you ought to Rejoice because you
[1:00:10] know I'm not one of those kind of
[1:00:11] grounds I'm not this Stony ground
[1:00:15] amen this most fall away when
[1:00:18] persecution comes to get past the very
[1:00:20] word they used to love they had Joy at
[1:00:23] one time that's ke our Jo let's not just
[1:00:25] have joy at the beginning of our walk
[1:00:27] with god let's keep our joy and let's
[1:00:29] bring forth fruit of the seed of the
[1:00:31] word of God
[1:00:34] Amen that's what the Bible says right
[1:00:37] there for which a while they believe
[1:00:40] they can believe for a
[1:00:41] [Applause]
[1:00:42] while right but in time of Temptation
[1:00:45] they fall
[1:00:47] away see this proves that one saved
[1:00:50] always saved only applies to God's
[1:00:52] mind praise the Lord God is the only one
[1:00:55] who knows that on who are saved will
[1:00:58] always be saved right because you can
[1:01:00] believe for a while but then be
[1:01:03] lost that's right because that that's
[1:01:05] what the Bible says your name being
[1:01:07] blotted out of the book of life that's
[1:01:09] exactly right why would Jesus tell the
[1:01:11] church age uh be careful or I'll blot
[1:01:13] your name out of The Book of Life why
[1:01:14] would he say that he says that because
[1:01:17] God keeps a record of all the confession
[1:01:19] because you overcome by your
[1:01:21] confession Glory the blood of the Lamb
[1:01:24] the word of your profession amen so God
[1:01:27] puts a list on The Book of Life in
[1:01:30] heaven of anyone that confess to be
[1:01:32] saved but if they deny that if they
[1:01:34] believe for a while and then leave it he
[1:01:36] blocks it out that's exactly what Jesus
[1:01:39] said
[1:01:41] Glory but if you're a real Holy Ghost to
[1:01:43] a Christian you were once saved always
[1:01:46] saved GL but if you're a make believer
[1:01:49] like Judas and Bam and all these Esau
[1:01:51] different ones like that you'll believe
[1:01:53] for a while but then you get offended by
[1:01:55] the word you get upset at the word your
[1:01:56] count is changes toward the word and
[1:01:58] then you deny the word and then your
[1:02:00] name gets denied on The Book of
[1:02:02] Life Oh
[1:02:06] Glory I'm little tired today so bear
[1:02:08] with me here by God's grace I'm excited
[1:02:10] and tired okay ground number three The
[1:02:13] Authority ground The Authority ground
[1:02:16] represents those who love the cares of
[1:02:18] the world and deceitfulness of riches
[1:02:20] choke the word thus the person is
[1:02:22] unfruitful like I said this is the one
[1:02:23] we got to be careful careful for right I
[1:02:25] gota be careful you got to be careful
[1:02:27] for this okay when they heard the word
[1:02:29] now Luke 8 is the parallel passage Luke
[1:02:31] 8:14 when they've heard they go forth
[1:02:33] and they're Chun with cares and riches
[1:02:35] and pleasures of this life remember the
[1:02:38] Bible said they were lovers of Pleasures
[1:02:40] or the lovers of God so what do you love
[1:02:43] more going to a church tonight or the
[1:02:45] pleasures of this world well shows a
[1:02:46] good thing if you came tonight because
[1:02:48] your pleasure is in the house of God
[1:02:51] Amen it's more pleasurable than anything
[1:02:53] else I can do the pleasures of being a
[1:02:55] Christian amen and number four here's
[1:02:58] well let's all strive to be good ground
[1:03:01] let's all strive to have a good ground
[1:03:03] heart the good ground represents those
[1:03:06] who understand the word they hear these
[1:03:08] bear fruit some hundredfold some 60 fold
[1:03:12] and some 30 fold the parallel pass I
[1:03:15] love this parallel passage look what
[1:03:17] Luke says so this is the kind of
[1:03:19] Christian we need to be an honest
[1:03:21] Christian right you know there's a lot
[1:03:23] of Christians honest amen can you say
[1:03:25] Amen to that amen they don't tell you
[1:03:27] the truth all the time
[1:03:29] yeah those are Authority Christians
[1:03:32] right or uh Sony ground Christians or
[1:03:36] so-called
[1:03:37] understand honest and a good heart
[1:03:41] having heard the word I love this they
[1:03:43] keep the word amen you see a real
[1:03:46] Christian keeps and obeys the Bible and
[1:03:49] bring forth fruit with what patience and
[1:03:52] patience is on the Statue of a person
[1:03:54] perfect man that's right Jesus said in
[1:03:56] patience possess your Souls praise the
[1:03:59] Lord he and then he told the church the
[1:04:01] Philadelphia Church CH he said if you
[1:04:02] keep the word of my patience I'll keep
[1:04:04] you from the hour of Temptation that's
[1:04:06] coming upon the entire world oh
[1:04:09] glory and here's what I want to show you
[1:04:11] remember this when I preached on sa
[1:04:13] David you remember that or has it been
[1:04:15] so long that I've overloaded you have I
[1:04:17] overloaded you okay there's two kinds of
[1:04:21] classes there's two Destinies there's a
[1:04:23] saved Destiny and a lost Destiny right
[1:04:28] and we call these Believers and now the
[1:04:30] lws have two kinds they have unbelievers
[1:04:32] that never believe like the the worst
[1:04:34] kind of the the Wayside ground and then
[1:04:36] they have make believers who believe for
[1:04:38] a little
[1:04:39] bit this is church AG book my teaches
[1:04:41] this in the CH Church age book right
[1:04:44] it's all from the
[1:04:45] Bible now underneath the saved the far
[1:04:49] right is the Holy Ghost filled the
[1:04:50] highest quality of Christian and I can
[1:04:52] just I can take a screen this an email
[1:04:54] to you if you want it by God's
[1:04:56] grace so the wise virgin is the highest
[1:05:00] quality of Christian then you have the
[1:05:01] foolish virgin make believer
[1:05:04] unbeliever the Bible says well we know
[1:05:07] Jes there's four crosses brother BR said
[1:05:09] Jesus was the highest quality the saved
[1:05:11] Thief at least he God saved right Judas
[1:05:14] was lost but believed for a while the
[1:05:16] Lost Thief never believed it again with
[1:05:18] right so the Bible in revelation 22 says
[1:05:21] there's holy he that's holy be holy
[1:05:23] still he that's righteous be righteous
[1:05:25] still he that's filthy be filthy still
[1:05:27] he that's unjust be unjust still the
[1:05:30] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[1:05:34] right second Timothy 2:20 says we must
[1:05:36] be meat for the Master's use which means
[1:05:39] there's some vessels of gold right some
[1:05:41] vessels of silver they get saved they're
[1:05:44] redeemed there's some vessels of wood
[1:05:46] some vessels of Earth and here's ours I
[1:05:49] already had this on you I didn't have to
[1:05:50] do nothing because I already preached
[1:05:51] this before it was already part of the
[1:05:53] message right Jesus said there's three
[1:05:56] kinds of ground there's a good ground
[1:05:58] produces fruit that's right the Thor
[1:06:01] ground doesn't produce fruit because it
[1:06:04] doesn't have the Holy Spirit the Stony
[1:06:06] ground doesn't rejoices for a little bit
[1:06:08] then Falls away in times of tribulation
[1:06:10] and the Wayside don't even they don't
[1:06:12] even understand it to begin
[1:06:13] with so you have four kinds of Believers
[1:06:16] in every age you have Abraham lot Mrs
[1:06:18] lot sodomites I still got two two to
[1:06:20] fill in here you have Mah Jehoshaphat
[1:06:23] Ahab jeze
[1:06:25] all right does that make sense you
[1:06:28] understand that church I'm really pay
[1:06:30] attention when I ask you understand I'm
[1:06:32] really pay attention do you
[1:06:34] understand after this sermon tonight if
[1:06:36] you don't understand Satan can snap you
[1:06:39] out of your heart you might not believe
[1:06:42] the right things might believe the wrong
[1:06:44] things okay so hopefully that hopefully
[1:06:46] that makes
[1:06:48] sense now look what brother says here
[1:06:52] doors in the door 1965 so we find that
[1:06:54] our messages today the message that we
[1:06:56] have of come out of Babylon be free be
[1:06:59] filled with the spirit and your lamp
[1:07:00] trimly clear and look up our Redemption
[1:07:02] y near these things are foreign to many
[1:07:04] people who breathe and call our lovely
[1:07:07] lord's name is that true a lot of people
[1:07:09] read the Bible and don't even know that
[1:07:11] God said my people better come out of
[1:07:13] the Roman Catholic
[1:07:14] church now it keeps going yet in the
[1:07:17] midst of all that we don't have nothing
[1:07:19] against those people those
[1:07:21] denominational people do you I hope you
[1:07:23] don't have anything against them right
[1:07:26] you should love them amen you should
[1:07:27] forgive them amen you should be a higher
[1:07:30] quality Christian than them not by
[1:07:32] bragging but by sure ability of the word
[1:07:35] bringing forth in your
[1:07:37] life they're all right they're fine look
[1:07:40] how look how nice they're all right
[1:07:42] they're
[1:07:43] fine they there're are Associates with
[1:07:45] the gospel because Jesus said no man can
[1:07:47] go to me except my father draws him and
[1:07:49] all the father give me will come I'm
[1:07:51] getting to somewhere I'm getting to
[1:07:51] where he talks about this Parable we
[1:07:53] just preached are so we're only
[1:07:56] responsible for sewing
[1:07:58] seeds some fell by the wayside some
[1:08:01] different kinds of ground some fell over
[1:08:03] and brought forth a h hundredfold so we
[1:08:05] are just seed sers God is the one who
[1:08:08] directs it when it's
[1:08:10] falling God knows where to take that
[1:08:12] seed and where it's going to fall God
[1:08:15] knew where you'd be to bring the work to
[1:08:17] you and now we pray that maybe this
[1:08:19] morning there be a little seed drop
[1:08:21] along somewhere that might encourage
[1:08:25] someone all right new
[1:08:27] quote I'm not going to read all this I'm
[1:08:30] sorry it's a little bit smaller too I'm
[1:08:32] going to start right here you know his
[1:08:33] own seed they said he SED some fell by
[1:08:36] the wayside didn't do any good at all
[1:08:37] some fell on Thorns but and on Stony
[1:08:40] ground but some went over in good soil
[1:08:42] that was the son of God I can just seow
[1:08:45] seeds the same way so now says he
[1:08:48] interprets this Parable for us Jesus is
[1:08:50] the sewer but it's Jesus in Preachers
[1:08:53] today
[1:08:54] that preached the word to us he said I
[1:08:56] can sow seeds the same
[1:08:59] way so church if i s ever SE any see
[1:09:02] guess what it wasn't me it was Christ
[1:09:04] amen Lord don't say great job brother
[1:09:06] Jus you're the best and you're I'm not
[1:09:08] if any good seed was sld it'd be Christ
[1:09:11] and him alone amen now here's one I love
[1:09:15] this is a beautiful
[1:09:17] quote this to me
[1:09:19] proves that that H hundredfold Seed that
[1:09:22] fell on good grass
[1:09:24] uh was the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:26] because this is what he says firstever
[1:09:29] 1963 August that's the way many people
[1:09:32] does about coming to Christ they lay the
[1:09:35] foundation of believing on the Lord
[1:09:36] Jesus and accepting him as personal
[1:09:38] Savior and maybe going on to Christian
[1:09:40] baptism but when it comes down to
[1:09:43] following on
[1:09:44] through to the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:47] Spirit somebody explains it away for
[1:09:49] them that's the reason that seed fell on
[1:09:51] by the wayside or it fell on Stony
[1:09:54] ground it tells us right here in order
[1:09:58] for a seed to in order for to have the
[1:10:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost the seed must
[1:10:02] go all the way through and accomplish
[1:10:04] what it's supposed to accomplish
[1:10:06] right all right how you like that hope
[1:10:09] you like that by God's grace a great in
[1:10:11] solon's here he said no man can come to
[1:10:13] me except my father draws him first and
[1:10:15] here's the gracious thing about it all
[1:10:17] the fathers give me will come that's the
[1:10:19] part I like that yes sir all the fathers
[1:10:21] give me will come and I'm happy for that
[1:10:23] so we don't know who is and who's
[1:10:26] not we just scatter forth the seed
[1:10:28] that's all we can do some Falls by the
[1:10:32] wayside some Falls this way and that way
[1:10:34] but some does fall on good ground that's
[1:10:36] right ground that's been prepared by God
[1:10:38] to receive the seed I told you God
[1:10:41] prepared your ground to receive the
[1:10:43] seed God God knew where that seed was
[1:10:46] going God knew gravity and the wind
[1:10:48] would take it this place and that place
[1:10:49] God knew where you were at he knows
[1:10:51] right where you are tonight too church
[1:10:53] God just you heard the word the first
[1:10:54] time he knows where you are right now
[1:10:56] praise God he goes on to say
[1:10:59] this he said some went forth when the
[1:11:01] sea went forth preached the word some
[1:11:03] fell by the wayside just like water on a
[1:11:05] duck's back runs right off some fell on
[1:11:08] Rocky ground Stony and it's just little
[1:11:10] dust that blowed up there and sprung up
[1:11:11] but didn't have no roots no place to put
[1:11:13] its roots I'm going to make
[1:11:15] illustrations here and I hope I don't
[1:11:16] hurt no
[1:11:17] feelings so I hope brother R doesn't
[1:11:20] hurt any feelings
[1:11:21] here he said that was the Catholic
[1:11:24] Church they said they was built on a
[1:11:28] rock Glory so the unbelievers the
[1:11:31] Wayside the Stony ground he says is the
[1:11:33] Catholic church because they're built
[1:11:36] upon a rock but they Peter if that their
[1:11:38] rock is Peter Peter's not the rock that
[1:11:41] the gospel's buil upon because he was a
[1:11:43] man and he'd fall short of the glory of
[1:11:45] God you can't build anything upon a man
[1:11:47] and expect the heaven to come forth and
[1:11:49] follow through you got to build your
[1:11:51] hopes on Jesus Christ and look he says
[1:11:54] I'll agree with them I'll sure agree
[1:11:56] with them that's right no no Earth under
[1:11:59] at all wow no Earth on it to grow from
[1:12:02] why it couldn't produce they couldn't
[1:12:04] produce a Bible vitamin because they
[1:12:06] don't even believe in it right GL I
[1:12:10] thought that was good I never heard that
[1:12:12] before till last night when I was
[1:12:13] studying I like that yes so the
[1:12:16] unbelievers the way side the Sony ground
[1:12:18] is
[1:12:19] Catholicism they don't have any vitamins
[1:12:21] of the spiritual vitamins of the word
[1:12:24] all right and I hope it don't hurt any
[1:12:26] feelings all right Queen Sheba I'm gonna
[1:12:29] go right to the highlighted part and
[1:12:31] then he say someone over and brought
[1:12:32] forth a h hundredfold see you must first
[1:12:35] let the word fall in the right type of
[1:12:37] Faith so now he calls the heart a heart
[1:12:39] of faith and then that Faith produces
[1:12:42] what the word said because the word is a
[1:12:46] seed all right next
[1:12:48] one I'm G read the underline part that's
[1:12:51] where many fall away because we can't
[1:12:52] stand that trial a person come to the
[1:12:55] altar time Revival and you watch just a
[1:12:57] little while and the hot trials begin to
[1:12:59] come so now we're talking about the
[1:13:01] Stony ground again watch somebody that
[1:13:03] comes to the altar but watch how they
[1:13:05] live their life after
[1:13:06] that he said Jesus plainly taught it the
[1:13:09] store went forth sewing seed some fell
[1:13:11] by the wayside some on swinging ground
[1:13:13] and among thorns and thistles and others
[1:13:14] fell over a good ground and he said
[1:13:16] that's the way the word went goes out
[1:13:18] some hears the word go out birds come
[1:13:20] along pick it up see they don't do no
[1:13:22] good at all all come up overnight oh
[1:13:24] they're going to do great
[1:13:27] things but when the trials begin to come
[1:13:30] it chokes them down but some goes all
[1:13:33] the way into the good crd and that
[1:13:35] brings forth aund
[1:13:37] fold so he says let's be hund folds how
[1:13:42] many want to do what brother R said
[1:13:43] there I do on this one I do let's be the
[1:13:47] hundredfold let's go way
[1:13:49] over and sell out everything from the
[1:13:52] world and look to Christ and believe him
[1:13:55] with all our hearts no roots of
[1:13:58] bitterness against anybody that's
[1:14:01] right and everything's cleaned out and
[1:14:03] the Holy Spirit can work through us then
[1:14:05] we become a channel he talks about if
[1:14:07] you stay in the channel of Christ if he
[1:14:09] abides in me my words abide in you ask
[1:14:11] what you will be done unto you you say
[1:14:14] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[1:14:15] in your heart believe what you said will
[1:14:17] come to pass you're gonna have what you
[1:14:18] said praise God
[1:14:22] Amen all right that's the first Parable
[1:14:25] that's going to be the longest one okay
[1:14:27] because I had the most quotes on that
[1:14:28] one all right now number two is the
[1:14:30] parable of the wheat and tears this is
[1:14:32] an interesting text as well so let's go
[1:14:34] to this one let's go to Matthew
[1:14:36] 13:36 to 43 I'll read this one again
[1:14:38] because it's long but after that I'll
[1:14:40] have some brothers maybe some of the
[1:14:41] sisters if you'd like to uh read some
[1:14:43] verses for us let's read just the
[1:14:46] ocation I think is this another Parable
[1:14:49] mystery where Jesus interprets it for us
[1:14:52] so now can can everybody see how the
[1:14:53] four grounds or four types of classes of
[1:14:56] of Believers can everybody see that
[1:14:58] that's a
[1:14:59] mystery didn't Jesus say that's a
[1:15:01] mystery most people don't know that
[1:15:03] mystery but God gave it to brother right
[1:15:05] in time of the writing of the church age
[1:15:07] book right before he went off the
[1:15:09] scene glory amen and we know the mystery
[1:15:13] so we know not to be choked by the cares
[1:15:16] of the world or by riches we know we
[1:15:18] must be fully sold out to Christ if
[1:15:20] we're going to bring forth A3 or sex0
[1:15:24] we know only those who are truly born
[1:15:26] again will bring forth the fruit of the
[1:15:28] spirit
[1:15:31] Glory now let me read this 1336 to 43
[1:15:34] this a big
[1:15:35] read well you know what okay let's read
[1:15:38] it because we got time all right time
[1:15:41] let me okay it's 8 8:14 okay yeah we got
[1:15:43] time because the other parables are
[1:15:45] really short the first two are really
[1:15:47] long okay verse
[1:15:49] 36 then Jesus s the mude away and went
[1:15:53] to the house and the disciples came unto
[1:15:54] him saying declare us the parable the
[1:15:56] tears of the
[1:15:57] field that's how we should be church
[1:16:00] right look they didn't understand the
[1:16:01] parable so they go ask Jesus what what
[1:16:03] did you mean
[1:16:04] Jesus we should do that if we don't
[1:16:07] understand the word we should go to the
[1:16:09] Lord and say Lord can you explain that
[1:16:10] to me can you have somebody else preach
[1:16:13] that sometime soon because I didn't
[1:16:14] catch that or can we have the pastor sit
[1:16:16] down and do a Bible study about that I
[1:16:18] need to understand what you just said
[1:16:20] right
[1:16:22] GL aners into them he that s The Good
[1:16:24] Seed is the son of man the field is the
[1:16:27] world the good seed are the children of
[1:16:28] the Kingdom but the tears of the
[1:16:30] children of the wicked one the enemy
[1:16:31] that sld them is the devil the Harvest
[1:16:33] is the end of the world and the Reapers
[1:16:34] of the angels as therefore the tears are
[1:16:37] gathered together in the fire I'm sorry
[1:16:39] burn the fire so shall be the end of
[1:16:41] this world the son of man shall send
[1:16:43] forth his angels and they Shall Gather
[1:16:45] out the kingdom all things that of fend
[1:16:47] and them which do iniquity and shall be
[1:16:50] cast them I'm sorry and shall cast them
[1:16:52] into a furnace of Fire there should be
[1:16:53] wailing and nashing of teeth then shall
[1:16:55] the righteous shine forth as the son in
[1:16:57] the Kingdom of their father who have
[1:16:59] ears to hear Let Him hear all right
[1:17:03] praise the Lord now there's one
[1:17:05] scripture I want to read here just a
[1:17:08] moment okay now go to verse 25 I'm sorry
[1:17:10] I want to read this because this ties it
[1:17:12] with the interpretation
[1:17:15] 13:25 now brother Simon said he preached
[1:17:18] this when I when I was out in Iowa last
[1:17:20] summer okay so I don't know I don't
[1:17:23] expect you remember that that's a long
[1:17:24] time ago I just was curious who would
[1:17:26] that's why I asked you on Sunday who
[1:17:27] remembers what he said I didn't remember
[1:17:29] I wasn't here that's why and I don't
[1:17:31] actually don't think it got recorded
[1:17:32] either okay Matthew 13:25 now listen but
[1:17:36] wild men did what while they slept slept
[1:17:40] wild men slept so first the son of man
[1:17:42] SWS his good seed but then when those
[1:17:45] men
[1:17:46] sleep his enemy came and so tears among
[1:17:49] the wheat and went his way so first
[1:17:52] there's a bunch of weat when the gospel
[1:17:54] was produced think about Acts chapter
[1:17:57] 2 think about the book of Acts Glory God
[1:18:01] bless sister Wy appreciate your
[1:18:02] sacrifice bu Glory so see you get that
[1:18:07] in the book of Acts chapter 2 the church
[1:18:09] started out M there's a bunch of wheat
[1:18:11] seeds out there but while men
[1:18:14] slept when those Apostles started
[1:18:17] D the enemy came and sold a lot of
[1:18:20] Tears amongst the church age that's what
[1:18:23] brother Bram said I'm G to show it to
[1:18:24] you now this also types serpent SE we're
[1:18:27] going to show that too okay because
[1:18:29] that's the way I've always preached it
[1:18:31] but I talked to Simon Monday night on
[1:18:33] the phone for a while and he said that's
[1:18:34] he found this quote and I opened it up
[1:18:36] to him I said yeah that's exactly right
[1:18:38] that's the word the son of man was
[1:18:40] showing wheat wheat wheat wheat and then
[1:18:41] when men slept after men slept remember
[1:18:44] Paul said after I leave Ephesus remember
[1:18:46] act 20 previous wolves shall enter in
[1:18:49] not spelling the
[1:18:51] flock are you with me he worn them for
[1:18:54] three years and
[1:18:55] tears so once men slept once men moved
[1:18:59] on then the terror swers came in don't
[1:19:02] get me wrong the Antichrist Spirit was
[1:19:04] working before that we know that start
[1:19:05] working on the day after the day of
[1:19:07] Pentecost forever more you understand
[1:19:09] somewhere along in there but really Paul
[1:19:12] knew once I leave once a mighty prophet
[1:19:15] of God leaves that's when Satan can
[1:19:17] really go in there and sew in a bunch of
[1:19:21] Tears
[1:19:23] all right so now here's some notes I
[1:19:25] want to bring out some other things now
[1:19:27] this is a mystery most people don't
[1:19:29] understand this mystery they don't apply
[1:19:31] it the right
[1:19:32] way so this is the second Parable
[1:19:35] mystery and is again interpreted by our
[1:19:37] Lord himself I love that when Jesus
[1:19:39] interprets it himself because we can't
[1:19:40] miss it then that's right as long as we
[1:19:42] got right Hearts before God we won't
[1:19:45] miss it then the son of man is he that
[1:19:47] sow The Good Seed which are the children
[1:19:49] of the Kingdom the field is the world
[1:19:51] and the tears are are the children of
[1:19:53] the wicked one right the enemy that sow
[1:19:56] them is the devil you see the devil
[1:19:58] planted his own
[1:19:59] children praise God in the beginning In
[1:20:02] the Garden of Eden it was a natural
[1:20:04] Child by the serpent seed he influenced
[1:20:08] the serpent and brought forth a hybrid
[1:20:10] person right but now we're all mixed
[1:20:13] into that we all got that nature sin
[1:20:16] dwell in our members amen and even one
[1:20:18] of the most holy ghost filled Mighty Men
[1:20:20] of God St Paul still said that s dwells
[1:20:23] in my members and that what I hate
[1:20:25] that's what I do praise God even when
[1:20:28] Good's right there with me good and
[1:20:29] wrong right there with me even that
[1:20:31] which I hate I do that why because sin
[1:20:33] dwelleth in our
[1:20:37] members
[1:20:39] Glory the Harvest is the end of the
[1:20:41] world the reapers are the
[1:20:44] Angels in the end of the world the terar
[1:20:47] will be gathered by the angels of the
[1:20:48] son of man and the terrce will be burned
[1:20:50] in the Lake of Fire or the furnace
[1:20:53] that's the end of the world now here's
[1:20:56] my notes so this is might be different
[1:20:58] to you in this Parable we see two great
[1:21:01] Mysteries because this a mystery Parable
[1:21:03] amen Jesus said I speak them in Parables
[1:21:06] because there's Mysteries and it's given
[1:21:07] to you to understand the Mysteries amen
[1:21:11] so the first Parable the first meaning
[1:21:13] is there's two different seeds The Godly
[1:21:16] seed and the serpent seed that's
[1:21:18] right meaning that Eve was the field
[1:21:20] that received the two different seeds
[1:21:23] and now we would say something like this
[1:21:26] well I don't know how to say it but the
[1:21:27] Feld would just be the world yeah it was
[1:21:29] even the beginning of if you look at the
[1:21:31] type of two different seeds two
[1:21:32] different children and now uh the second
[1:21:35] interpretation so the first
[1:21:36] interpretation is serpent seed Children
[1:21:39] Of Satan the second one is the church
[1:21:41] ages here's the one brother has a quote
[1:21:43] for the meaning in this church age
[1:21:47] interpretation the meaning is that the
[1:21:49] field was the church age and had both
[1:21:53] weat and tears in each
[1:21:55] age and here's what brother man taught
[1:21:57] in the church age book it's page 367 for
[1:21:59] those who like to read it that paragraph
[1:22:02] number
[1:22:03] two now please let us be careful here
[1:22:05] resume the church ages this message to
[1:22:08] the angel of the church which is at
[1:22:09] Ephesus is not a message to the actual
[1:22:12] local Ephesian
[1:22:14] Church it is a message to the age so
[1:22:18] this message you know where the angel
[1:22:19] comes and speak to the Church of Ephesus
[1:22:21] that was to the entire age not just the
[1:22:24] church in Ephesus I think most of us
[1:22:26] understand
[1:22:27] that and that age had in it the seed of
[1:22:31] truth and the seed of air exactly as set
[1:22:36] forth according to the parable of the
[1:22:38] weat and the tears right is that
[1:22:41] beautiful the church ages is the
[1:22:46] field and in it are we in tears the
[1:22:50] false Church organized humanized the
[1:22:52] government the word and fought the true
[1:22:54] Christian Glory ain't that good church
[1:22:57] let's say praise the Lord ready praise
[1:22:59] the Lord amen I never seen that until
[1:23:01] this week I even read that book and I
[1:23:03] missed
[1:23:04] it so see how did the field start it
[1:23:08] started out with a bunch of wheat how
[1:23:10] the church age start with a bunch of
[1:23:13] truth but by The End by the Harvest
[1:23:16] what's happened you mostly have tears
[1:23:19] among SED and so it is in the churches
[1:23:21] today we most have tears sitting in
[1:23:24] churches
[1:23:25] today are you with me can everybody say
[1:23:28] Amen to that that sound right sound
[1:23:31] sound
[1:23:33] biblical that's exactly biblical so now
[1:23:37] you know the mystery of the uh the wheat
[1:23:39] and the tears is actually a mystery of
[1:23:41] the seven Church ages right
[1:23:44] Glory I don't know if you knew that but
[1:23:46] now you know thaten okay so the first
[1:23:49] mystery is of the four kinds of grounds
[1:23:52] two kind signs and destinies and four
[1:23:54] classes that's the first mystery of the
[1:23:56] kingdom of God the second one is what we
[1:23:59] saw here the mystery of the church ages
[1:24:01] how it starts off with good seed and
[1:24:03] then the tears spread like
[1:24:05] wildfire that's what they got Wildfire
[1:24:07] they don't have a controlled Mighty real
[1:24:09] substance fire glory
[1:24:12] amen a lick of tongue fire we'd say Amen
[1:24:15] they just got Wildfire makes it can't
[1:24:18] control it but a real Christian can
[1:24:20] control the holy spirit in life amen
[1:24:22] well there said you have control of the
[1:24:24] Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit has
[1:24:26] control of you praise God
[1:24:29] glory remember the greatest anointing on
[1:24:31] Jesus was the Holy Spirit in control
[1:24:33] amen not wildfire in control
[1:24:37] yes but if you have nothing but Wildfire
[1:24:40] praise God at least you got some fire
[1:24:43] but we want control fire that's right
[1:24:47] okay mystery number three like I said
[1:24:49] these are a lot shorter now look at this
[1:24:50] is only two verses so maybe some you can
[1:24:52] handle reading two verses morning I I
[1:24:54] just didn't want to have you read too
[1:24:55] much because I know it's a it's a labor
[1:24:56] okay let's go to Matthew 13
[1:24:59] 3132 you got your Bibles
[1:25:09] here okay when like to read that just
[1:25:11] raise your hand when like to read that
[1:25:12] John okay 31-32 this is the mystery of
[1:25:16] the grain of mustard see this might
[1:25:18] knock your socks off here so go ahead
[1:25:20] brother
[1:25:21] John yeah 13 31- 32
[1:25:29] sir oh okay brother it's okay is
[1:25:31] everybody El time to get
[1:25:34] there another Parable put he forth unto
[1:25:37] them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:25:39] like to a grain of mustard seed which a
[1:25:42] man took and Seed in his field which
[1:25:45] indeed is that least of all seeds but
[1:25:48] when it is grown is the greatest among
[1:25:51] herbs and becometh a tree so that the
[1:25:54] birds of the air come and Lodge in the
[1:25:56] branches thereof amen thank you sir now
[1:25:59] let me before I knock your shoes off
[1:26:02] here if you don't know this maybe you
[1:26:04] know it then I won't knock your shoes
[1:26:05] off get your spiritual jackets on then
[1:26:07] brother B said okay ready to be shocked
[1:26:10] by the Holy Spirit here now listen when
[1:26:13] I first read this I think oh Mustard
[1:26:15] Seed oh Mustard Seed
[1:26:18] Faith right Jesus said if your faith is
[1:26:20] the size of a mustard seed
[1:26:22] you can say this mountain move and it'll
[1:26:25] move but as you read it you start seeing
[1:26:29] how birds come along and Lodge in the
[1:26:32] branches thereof and the only pictures I
[1:26:34] can think of birds lodging are the Roman
[1:26:37] Catholic Church how she's a cage of un
[1:26:39] hateful and unclean Birds that's right
[1:26:41] and that Baker that Joseph had a dream
[1:26:44] for all the birds come and bit off you
[1:26:46] know the the cake on the pie on his head
[1:26:48] I can't think of any good things where
[1:26:51] and and and Abraham shoting all the
[1:26:53] fouls off of his sacrifice in Genesis
[1:26:57] 15 Glory said that was Abraham casting
[1:27:00] out Devils
[1:27:03] Glory so see I first thought it was a
[1:27:06] positive one but it's actually a mystery
[1:27:09] of the work of the Antichrist
[1:27:12] church and yes I have quotes back this
[1:27:15] up so the least of all the seeds brought
[1:27:18] forth the biggest herb of full
[1:27:21] tree it's so large birds come in Lodge
[1:27:24] there the little ly tongue Kindles a
[1:27:28] great fire the Bible say it's a world of
[1:27:30] iniquity amen one lying tongue one thing
[1:27:34] that's wrongly said some bitter word can
[1:27:37] become a whole world of
[1:27:41] iniquity are you with me church amen one
[1:27:44] word One root of bitterness can become
[1:27:46] an entire
[1:27:47] world of iniquity
[1:27:51] right Birds plural usually seem to mean
[1:27:54] evil spirits there's Genesis 15 where
[1:27:56] Abraham shooting away all the evil birds
[1:27:58] off the sacrifice that God told him to
[1:28:00] offer uh I Genesis 40 That's the the
[1:28:03] baker that died by command of the king
[1:28:06] with the birds picking up the pie off
[1:28:07] his head whatever more and then
[1:28:10] Revelation 182 is all the cage of
[1:28:12] unclean and hateful birds in the Roman
[1:28:14] Catholic
[1:28:16] Church whereas one bird the dove
[1:28:19] represents the holy spirit in John 13
[1:28:26] all right here's your quote chapter nine
[1:28:27] Church age book The leoan Church age
[1:28:31] here's your quotation I know you've been
[1:28:32] waiting for it appreciate your patience
[1:28:35] now I said a moment ago the false FL
[1:28:38] came into full fruition in this age her
[1:28:41] her fruit would soon mature and ripen
[1:28:43] that's correct this evil spirit of
[1:28:46] church full of iniquity will be revealed
[1:28:49] as the mustard seed that grew into the
[1:28:52] tree where lies the fouls of the
[1:28:56] air and at her head will be the
[1:28:59] Antichrist the mystery of
[1:29:01] iniquity
[1:29:04] amen look how Jesus hid that mystery
[1:29:07] laying in there everybody thinks that's
[1:29:09] oh that's Mustard Seed Faith and all
[1:29:11] these birds are com to Lodge on me
[1:29:13] better be careful what birds come and
[1:29:15] Lodge on you amen sister want one bird
[1:29:19] loding on me and that's the DB of God
[1:29:22] amen the Holy Spirit I don't want a
[1:29:25] bunch of birds L on me I want one bird
[1:29:28] and that's the Holy Ghost
[1:29:30] amen
[1:29:31] glory so brother man talk all this is
[1:29:35] true and this is true then it must also
[1:29:37] be true that the bride church WIll
[1:29:39] mature and her rightness will be in
[1:29:40] identification with her Lord by means of
[1:29:42] the word and her head who will become to
[1:29:45] hers the Myster of godliness which is in
[1:29:46] need Christ there's that quote one time
[1:29:48] brother said Christ is the mystery of
[1:29:50] godliness so he bring brings godliness
[1:29:52] to the people just how does he do that
[1:29:55] through St perect man add to your faith
[1:29:57] remember said it's the faith of Jesus
[1:29:59] Christ it's the virtue of Jesus Christ
[1:30:01] it's the knowledge of Jesus Christ it's
[1:30:04] the temperance of Jesus Christ it's the
[1:30:06] patience of Jesus Christ it's the godess
[1:30:08] of Jesus Christ it's a brother kindness
[1:30:10] of Jesus Christ and it says Jesus Christ
[1:30:12] himself amen the love of God amen
[1:30:17] glory finishing the quote and as the
[1:30:19] false church with all cunning and D iCal
[1:30:22] power made up of political force
[1:30:24] physical force and demons of Darkness
[1:30:26] come against this True Vine the True
[1:30:28] Vine was the fullness of what the spirit
[1:30:31] of God not a bunch of birds one Bird
[1:30:35] right the spirit of God and the word
[1:30:37] would do the very acts of power that
[1:30:40] Jesus did
[1:30:42] amen then as she nears her head so
[1:30:44] becoming like him through the word Jesus
[1:30:46] will come that the bride and groom May
[1:30:48] forever be United as one how many love
[1:30:50] the Lord tonight Lord amen I love that
[1:30:53] one that's probably my favorite one I
[1:30:54] learned I never do that let the Lord
[1:30:56] revealed that to me this week Hallelujah
[1:30:59] so now you know that that's quite a
[1:31:01] mystery quite a mystery it takes a small
[1:31:04] lie a small sin and it grows in the
[1:31:07] biggest problem the biggest tree in your
[1:31:09] life and then a bunch of evil what the
[1:31:11] Bible said one demon will go get seven
[1:31:13] more demons and now you don't have just
[1:31:15] one bird I got a bunch of
[1:31:18] birds
[1:31:20] Glory
[1:31:23] Hallelujah mystery number
[1:31:26] four 11 hidden three measures of
[1:31:30] meal
[1:31:32] Hallelujah 11 hidden three measures of
[1:31:36] meal now who like to read that one for
[1:31:38] me just one verse anybody read that one
[1:31:42] 13:33 okay go ahead brother whenever
[1:31:44] you're ready 1333 I got up here you can
[1:31:47] read off here if you want but I did put
[1:31:49] that one
[1:31:50] there another Parable spoke he unto them
[1:31:54] the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto
[1:31:57] leaven which a woman took and hid three
[1:32:00] measures of meal till the whole was
[1:32:03] leavened amen thank you sir thank you I
[1:32:07] got quiet interpretation for you on this
[1:32:09] one you got your shot Pro best on don't
[1:32:10] take him off yet I have some more
[1:32:12] shocking to do tonight I said that last
[1:32:15] one was a shock to me I'm like my
[1:32:16] mustard SE I thought that was a good
[1:32:18] thing I thought that was Faith turned
[1:32:20] out to be exactly opposite of what
[1:32:21] thought that's usually how the Holy
[1:32:23] Spirit brings it doesn't it that's how
[1:32:24] brother told the Holy Spirit brought on
[1:32:26] the White Horse Rider he thought it was
[1:32:27] the mighty
[1:32:28] conqueror it's exactly
[1:32:31] opposite the mystery of
[1:32:34] iniquity so see brother when the mind of
[1:32:36] the spirit comes in it's always contrary
[1:32:38] to what we think sometimes all right now
[1:32:41] here's some's my notes so this will
[1:32:43] start breaking into you so you
[1:32:45] understand it I looked it up okay not
[1:32:48] the word le is used 37 times in the
[1:32:50] Bible and every time it's mentioned in
[1:32:54] sin except in the time where it's in the
[1:32:57] the wave offering at the Feast of
[1:32:59] Weeks okay it's in the bread there was
[1:33:02] leav in that bread every other time it's
[1:33:04] mentioned in a sinful way right now I
[1:33:07] taught that and I believe I could back
[1:33:08] it up by the scripture two loaves were
[1:33:10] waved and there's Le in those waves now
[1:33:13] before that remember uh was it 50 days
[1:33:16] before that they waved the first fruits
[1:33:18] and that was the type of Christ there's
[1:33:20] no le in Christ yeah so when Christ was
[1:33:23] waved on the resurrection he's waved
[1:33:25] before the people there's no le but 50
[1:33:27] days later on the day of Pentecost the
[1:33:29] church was weighed before the
[1:33:32] people Glory that seed that was in that
[1:33:35] first fruit came into life in this bread
[1:33:38] amen but baked into the bread so part of
[1:33:41] the church was part of it was
[1:33:43] sinful because don't we have sin in our
[1:33:45] members I just said it right right so
[1:33:48] that's what the Feast of Weeks was they
[1:33:49] weighed two loaves and I preach it like
[1:33:51] this I preached one Lo was the alpha
[1:33:53] bride and the other was the Omega I
[1:33:56] don't know his brother said saw the
[1:33:57] vision of the Bride he saw the first
[1:33:58] church M and he said when the next one
[1:34:01] came back it was just like the first one
[1:34:03] yes so that's why I preach I could be
[1:34:05] wrong I don't know one thing for sure it
[1:34:08] was way before the Lord so it was an
[1:34:10] offering unto God so it had to be
[1:34:13] something good the only time any 11 was
[1:34:15] ever good when it was part of the bread
[1:34:18] that was offered on the day of Pentecost
[1:34:20] and way before the
[1:34:22] that's got to be the sin that's left in
[1:34:23] the church inside the members of the
[1:34:25] Bride of Jesus Christ that they overcome
[1:34:28] amen because it's baked into them they
[1:34:30] can't take it out right you take it out
[1:34:32] you get rid of the bread and get rid of
[1:34:34] the believer right praise God you try to
[1:34:36] take the Le out the baked bread sometime
[1:34:38] I challenge you to do that you can't do
[1:34:41] it because Le becomes a whole it comes
[1:34:43] part of it it becomes everything come
[1:34:45] becomes like
[1:34:47] it okay so let me knock your socks off
[1:34:50] or shock you with some shock in here now
[1:34:53] two other Parables before this
[1:34:55] one I'm sorry one's before one's after
[1:34:58] two other Parables that are different
[1:35:00] from this one the wheat and the ter I
[1:35:01] went through that one and the draget the
[1:35:03] draget is the seventh and last Parable
[1:35:06] both speak of evil permeating the entire
[1:35:10] world
[1:35:12] right so this Parable would go along
[1:35:15] with Jesus other interpretations of the
[1:35:18] worldwide perversion around the world
[1:35:23] Le represents sin every time it is used
[1:35:26] in the Bible some 37 40 times I didn't
[1:35:29] put the UN before Le when I did the
[1:35:31] search I just did leev with any ending I
[1:35:33] should have put the asteris in front
[1:35:36] right to get all the UN but I didn't do
[1:35:37] that I thought well I just want to see
[1:35:38] what it says about 11 11 11 11 okay you
[1:35:42] understand now the kingdom gospel now
[1:35:44] look this is the difference the kingdom
[1:35:46] Jesus already said the kingdom gospel
[1:35:48] Goes Forth by sewing seeds not by
[1:35:51] intermingling
[1:35:54] leid are you with me that's how the
[1:35:57] kingdom Goes Forth you hear the word of
[1:35:59] the Kingdom by seeds being SE not by
[1:36:02] baking and injecting Leen into uh the
[1:36:05] flower where those seeds came from
[1:36:08] That's not how God does it praise the
[1:36:10] Lord he SWS the
[1:36:13] seed here's another beautiful type a
[1:36:15] woman types a church in Ephesians 5 a
[1:36:18] woman also types a city in Revelation 7
[1:36:22] 198 Rome and a woman also types A people
[1:36:27] which is Israel in Revelation
[1:36:30] 121 so a woman could be any of those
[1:36:34] three so what woman Church would hide
[1:36:38] sin in three portions of wheat flour
[1:36:42] until the entire meal was completely
[1:36:45] sinful what woman would do
[1:36:48] that I believe it's the Roman Catholic
[1:36:51] Church
[1:36:51] chch and I got a low scripture to back
[1:36:54] that up I don't have any quotes on this
[1:36:57] one so it's have to be all scripture
[1:37:00] notice this is a beautiful thought here
[1:37:02] look at this notice next notice the
[1:37:04] connection between the black horse rider
[1:37:07] which is the Antichrist spirit in the
[1:37:09] church ages under the third seal of the
[1:37:10] Dark Ages and this woman with Le they
[1:37:14] both work with three
[1:37:16] measures a barley and one works with
[1:37:19] meal they both have three measures
[1:37:21] they're working with right both have
[1:37:25] control over the grain or flow that's
[1:37:29] handled and the church
[1:37:33] said I know I jumped off my chair I did
[1:37:36] my search on three
[1:37:38] measures the black horse rider works the
[1:37:41] same way with three evil measures
[1:37:44] amen and that woman that woman who
[1:37:47] injects Le into the gospel injects Le
[1:37:50] into the good flower she's got three
[1:37:52] measures as well and they're both
[1:37:54] Antichrist
[1:37:57] amen so the 11 Parable proves their
[1:38:01] sin is present in three measures that
[1:38:04] they
[1:38:06] control they control said the black
[1:38:08] horse riter controlled the staff of Life
[1:38:11] which was natural which a type of the
[1:38:13] spiritual of the doctrine they were
[1:38:14] giving out to the people because they
[1:38:16] had in the Dark Ages the Roman Catholic
[1:38:18] Church was church and state combined and
[1:38:21] had control over the natural bread and
[1:38:23] the spiritual
[1:38:25] bread exactly
[1:38:28] right let me give you some scripture now
[1:38:31] here's the beautiful scripture I was
[1:38:32] talking
[1:38:33] about and I Heard a Voice in the midst
[1:38:35] of the forb say a measure of wheat for a
[1:38:36] penny and three measures of
[1:38:39] barley for a penny and now brother said
[1:38:42] this was Jesus and see thou HT not the
[1:38:44] oil and the
[1:38:46] wine cuz the boys came out of the midst
[1:38:49] of the Beast and the Beast were worship
[1:38:51] in Jesus praise God and so Jesus say
[1:38:53] don't touch the simulation and
[1:38:56] Revelation and Holy Ghost baptism amen
[1:38:59] don't touch that amen oh glory
[1:39:03] amen and this is what we just read
[1:39:05] here's a woman who hides why would she
[1:39:08] hide sin in her
[1:39:12] bread right she's purposely hiding sin
[1:39:15] in her bread that she's gonna bake and
[1:39:18] feed to the people right because she
[1:39:21] knows what she's doing Church she don't
[1:39:23] operate in that unleavened bread like we
[1:39:26] do Glory First Corinthians 5 says we
[1:39:29] keep the Feast of the Passover with
[1:39:31] sincerity and truth and unleavened bread
[1:39:35] amen glory and the
[1:39:38] church
[1:39:43] Hallelujah so who in the world works
[1:39:47] with three measures a woman and a horse
[1:39:50] rider that's a black who else could that
[1:39:52] be except the Roman Catholic church and
[1:39:54] the Antichrist spirit in the Roman
[1:39:56] Catholic church right who else could
[1:39:58] that be and look church I got two or
[1:40:00] three
[1:40:02] Witnesses yes thank you
[1:40:06] Jesus and all these people this week
[1:40:08] that been trying to still throw me off
[1:40:10] of brother Bram I said show me one thing
[1:40:12] that you're saying that's got two or
[1:40:14] three Witnesses and they don't have any
[1:40:19] Witnesses Church it just it boils down
[1:40:22] to this Simplicity yes if we just simp
[1:40:25] simply follow the word where we just
[1:40:26] have two or three Witnesses and humbly
[1:40:29] keep the word rightly divide the word we
[1:40:31] always come out on top because we're
[1:40:32] just humbly keeping the word of
[1:40:36] God I don't have to impress people with
[1:40:38] big words and fancy words I just have to
[1:40:40] rightly divide the word the way the
[1:40:42] Bible said to divide it glory and he
[1:40:45] always rescues us he always stands up
[1:40:48] for us we always have the answer because
[1:40:50] he's the dissolve of all Satan's doubts
[1:40:52] Amen brother said we got the answer to
[1:40:55] Satan's questions amen and the answer is
[1:40:57] in the word of God
[1:41:00] Amen now listen this next L I hope I
[1:41:03] don't throw you off but
[1:41:07] listen three measures can represent
[1:41:10] either one of these three things or all
[1:41:13] three of these things but I found it
[1:41:15] striking that the Roman Catholic Church
[1:41:17] is connected with these three things
[1:41:19] that both have a three
[1:41:22] did you catch that I'm G show you three
[1:41:24] things that both have three parts so it
[1:41:28] could be one of these three or it could
[1:41:30] be all of these
[1:41:33] three so what did she inject into her
[1:41:36] bread now watch look at this one this
[1:41:39] sin in three measures it might be sin in
[1:41:41] the father son Holy Ghost false doct
[1:41:45] right because brother R said he saw a
[1:41:47] vision of a man beating his what m mom
[1:41:49] down and there's a three cornered Club
[1:41:53] he said which was a false trium baptism
[1:41:56] unto a trinity of gods and Satan just
[1:41:58] inject that false lie into the father
[1:42:01] Son and Holy Ghost brother said Satan
[1:42:05] travels in the names of Father Holy
[1:42:07] Ghost right Church it could be that or
[1:42:11] it could be something
[1:42:13] else it could be the three unclean
[1:42:16] spirits like
[1:42:17] frogs which is under the six file and
[1:42:21] the vials burn the tribulation yes which
[1:42:24] go out from the dragon look three
[1:42:26] unclean spirits go out from the Dragon
[1:42:28] one Satan the Beast the spirit of Rome
[1:42:31] because that's part of Daniel's Vision
[1:42:33] that Beast that man right and then the
[1:42:36] last one the false prophet which is the
[1:42:38] pope Antichrist right and I'm gonna show
[1:42:41] you the scripture after this the
[1:42:43] scripture after this shows it um it
[1:42:46] shows that those three Spirits go out to
[1:42:48] the entire world and defile defile the
[1:42:51] whole world and gather all the Sinners
[1:42:54] for the day of the battle the day of Our
[1:42:56] God the battle of Armageddon
[1:43:00] Glory so this the father and Holy Ghost
[1:43:02] might pervert the whole world no doubt
[1:43:04] it has the Catholic church is in every
[1:43:05] nation almost these three the Bible
[1:43:08] literally says with their lies of
[1:43:10] Wonders of working miracles their lying
[1:43:12] wonders their lying Miracles will
[1:43:14] pervert the whole entire world and
[1:43:16] gather them against the Christ and his
[1:43:18] people for our
[1:43:21] Glory or it might be number three which
[1:43:24] I put on our video on our website for
[1:43:25] mystery
[1:43:27] Babylon I love this I love when brother
[1:43:29] R brings us out the I think it's the
[1:43:31] second seal he said did you ever see how
[1:43:33] they have a threefold blasphemy against
[1:43:35] God it's in Revelation 13:6 the Bible
[1:43:39] said the beast in Revelation 13:6
[1:43:41] blasphemed God's name every brother said
[1:43:45] how do they do that they change the name
[1:43:46] from Jesus Christ to father son Holy
[1:43:48] Ghost right it's blasphemy right change
[1:43:51] his name a Blasphemous Tabernacle and
[1:43:55] how they do that the Tabernacle in
[1:43:56] heaven coming down to earth new city but
[1:43:59] they call Rome the Eternal City and
[1:44:01] that's
[1:44:04] blasphemy that's what brother have said
[1:44:08] and lastly they blasing the Saints said
[1:44:10] how do they blasing the Saints in heaven
[1:44:12] he said they pray to them and makes
[1:44:13] offerings for them and make statues of
[1:44:15] them they blasting the Saints in heaven
[1:44:17] that's right praise the Lord amen so it
[1:44:21] might be one of those three it might be
[1:44:23] all of those
[1:44:24] three and three measures one measure two
[1:44:28] meure I'm gonna hide this sin this Li
[1:44:31] I'm gonna hide this lie in this food I'm
[1:44:33] giving out to the people and I'll bake
[1:44:35] it and they won't even see it and
[1:44:37] they'll partake of it and they'll be
[1:44:38] guilty of partaking of Leaven because
[1:44:40] it's baked in there that's right right
[1:44:43] and everything in their bread their
[1:44:45] false word and false lies is all laved
[1:44:47] up it's all sinful and they can't help
[1:44:50] but for partake 11 because Le makes
[1:44:52] everything like itself it's all lies
[1:44:54] it's all false Doctrine and God said
[1:44:56] come over my people that you be got
[1:44:58] partakers of sins and plagues
[1:45:02] amen we're preaching tonight praise
[1:45:06] God it's a good thing too because I'm
[1:45:08] not a preacher all
[1:45:11] right this is beautiful now I don't have
[1:45:13] this one understand I hope Wendy will
[1:45:15] email me on this when you guys will
[1:45:16] email me this go to Hosea chapter 7 look
[1:45:18] at this this a beautiful scripture here
[1:45:20] I I know how to interpret it but there's
[1:45:22] another connection to leaven in ovens
[1:45:25] and sin in adultery it's beautiful I
[1:45:28] jump about jumped off my seat when I saw
[1:45:29] this to I'm like but I couldn't
[1:45:31] understand this I'm like Lord help me
[1:45:32] help me Jesus help me I couldn't quite
[1:45:34] understand it so I'm sure the revelation
[1:45:35] will come and do season maybe the next
[1:45:38] few minutes here it'll come I don't know
[1:45:40] okay Daniel Hosea okay so Daniel Hosea
[1:45:42] I'm think that song Daniel
[1:45:46] J all

[1:45:58] amen glory all right well I'm having a
[1:46:01] hard time getting there brother
[1:46:04] by I'm having a hard time my fault okay
[1:46:07] now Hosea
[1:46:08] 7 now this is uh where God is rebuking
[1:46:13] uh Israel of course this is 780 BC this
[1:46:16] is right after um Solomon and David okay
[1:46:20] look at vers
[1:46:22] for they are all adulterers was it the
[1:46:24] Roman Catholic Church an adulter that's
[1:46:26] right they're all adulterers all Israel
[1:46:28] as an oven heated by the baker who Seth
[1:46:32] from Raising after it near the D until
[1:46:35] it be
[1:46:36] le so God Likens
[1:46:39] Israel to putting Le in their bread and
[1:46:43] putting in the oven and sitting around
[1:46:45] until it's all 11 that's exactly what
[1:46:47] the Catholic church has done they've
[1:46:49] injected Le it into their Doctrine and
[1:46:52] give it up to the people and they sit
[1:46:54] back and wait till the day of judgment
[1:46:55] well they're going to get judged no
[1:46:57] doubt about that one hour they're going
[1:46:59] to be
[1:47:00] judged sit back and just let the
[1:47:02] adultery see they know it's going to
[1:47:03] work because it's all 11 and anyone who
[1:47:06] partakes of it is an adulter before God
[1:47:10] exactly right that's why I said come out
[1:47:11] of her my people
[1:47:14] amen now it doesn't stop there because
[1:47:17] um go down to verse seven look at this
[1:47:21] they are all hot as an oven see they're
[1:47:24] hot with sin and
[1:47:26] lust and have devoured their judges all
[1:47:29] their kings are Fallen there is none
[1:47:30] among them that calleth unto
[1:47:32] me they're so hot hanging around this
[1:47:35] oven just sitting back and relaxing and
[1:47:37] then feeding all these lies to the
[1:47:40] people exactly right the church said
[1:47:42] amen look this gen other words this Old
[1:47:44] Testament New Testament I don't have I
[1:47:46] don't have a Genesis scripture on this
[1:47:47] but you can see Old Testament to New
[1:47:49] Testament can't you right all right so
[1:47:53] the woman the ministry of the woman 11
[1:47:55] has got to be the Roman Catholic
[1:47:57] church planting Le and then sitting back
[1:48:01] and making sure everybody eats that oh
[1:48:03] it's all going to be Tak care they're
[1:48:05] all going to be adulteries yes they are
[1:48:06] they're all going to eat your adulterous
[1:48:09] work and that's a
[1:48:12] mystery praise the Lord amen how many
[1:48:15] preachers you ever see that recently
[1:48:16] preached the Le of the Catholic Church
[1:48:19] Glory will tear it up and they a bunch
[1:48:20] of Le only only Maniacs like me I
[1:48:23] imagine fix
[1:48:25] that but I'm a maniac for Christ I'm a
[1:48:29] ftic you're G be somebody's fool right
[1:48:30] are you fool for Jesus that's right and
[1:48:33] this is the only interpretation that
[1:48:34] works Through the Bible praise God you
[1:48:38] can't make the real Church injecting sin
[1:48:40] in the three measures where do you get
[1:48:43] the three in the church church AG is all
[1:48:45] seven but see they got three meals of
[1:48:48] Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:48:51] oh they got three me of blasphemies
[1:48:53] maybe it's that one or three unclean
[1:48:55] spirits like FL they got threes all over
[1:48:58] them and Le always represents
[1:49:02] sin now here's the scripture like I told
[1:49:04] you sorry the mouth the three unclean
[1:49:07] spirits they are the spirits of devils
[1:49:09] that work miracles and they're not real
[1:49:12] Miracles because they're Devils right
[1:49:15] they're lying wonders and miracles the
[1:49:16] Bible tells us which go forth under the
[1:49:19] kings of the earth of what the whole
[1:49:21] world see this is Le that goes
[1:49:23] throughout the entire world just like
[1:49:25] the parable said to gather them to the
[1:49:28] Battle of that great day of God Almighty
[1:49:30] that's got to be if this is the B it has
[1:49:31] to be
[1:49:34] Armageddon that's
[1:49:37] right
[1:49:39] okay how many love the Lord amen okay
[1:49:42] it's got I got just two or three more
[1:49:44] here and these are the shorter ones too
[1:49:45] it's almost n o'clock we're doing good
[1:49:47] on time praise the Lord okay number five
[1:49:49] the treasure hid in the field now this
[1:49:52] is the one I had least amount on I I
[1:49:54] search and search I just couldn't find
[1:49:55] brother saying anything about this in
[1:49:57] particular but I do find a lot about the
[1:49:59] Pearl the great price in the message
[1:50:01] amen so this I I I liken this one a lot
[1:50:05] unto the next Parable mystery the
[1:50:08] parable of uh the great Pearl great
[1:50:11] price okay so verse 44 you got any other
[1:50:15] people that haven't read yet that would
[1:50:16] like to read Matthew 13:44 I got up
[1:50:18] there if you don't have a Bible
[1:50:20] anybody like to read
[1:50:22] that oh brother okay okay go ahead
[1:50:25] brother thank you again the Kingdom of
[1:50:28] Heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
[1:50:31] field the which when a man had found he
[1:50:36] hideth and for Joy thereof goeth and sth
[1:50:41] all that he ha and buth that feel amen
[1:50:46] let's say praise the Lord praise the
[1:50:47] Lord amen so by notes Jesus said man
[1:50:50] found a treasure in a field the joy of
[1:50:52] this treasure caused the man to go sell
[1:50:54] everything he had in order to buy the
[1:50:56] field that contained the treasure right
[1:50:59] this Parable seems very similar to the
[1:51:00] sixth parable of a merchant man who
[1:51:03] sells out everything for the one great
[1:51:06] Pearl brother Ram liken humans unto the
[1:51:09] merchants and the one great Pearl as
[1:51:12] Christ so that's where I'm going to be
[1:51:14] done with that
[1:51:15] one
[1:51:18] um because this one is almost exactly
[1:51:20] the same principles of the fifth one but
[1:51:23] for some reason he has to tell it as a
[1:51:25] field and here he tells it as a pearl so
[1:51:28] Christ is both a treasure and a pearl we
[1:51:30] know that amen okay Glory all right six
[1:51:34] the pearl of great price okay Matthew
[1:51:38] 13:45 and 46 I'll read this one again
[1:51:41] the Kingdom of Heaven is like under a
[1:51:43] merchant man seeking goodly pearls who
[1:51:45] when he found one Pearl great price went
[1:51:48] and sold all that he had and bought it
[1:51:51] now here's my notes we are likened unto
[1:51:53] Merchant seeking goodly pearls is that
[1:51:56] how we start off we're seeking a lot of
[1:51:58] good things we want all kinds of good I
[1:52:00] want a good job brother I want a good
[1:52:03] friend I want a good wife I want a good
[1:52:05] husband I'm want a good I'm seeking all
[1:52:07] kinds of good
[1:52:08] things I'm looking for a lot I'm looking
[1:52:10] for health I'm looking for riches I'm
[1:52:11] looking for everything I'm looking for a
[1:52:13] lot of good things but eventually we
[1:52:17] find the one and only Pearl that means
[1:52:20] more than all the
[1:52:23] others there's a lot of good things out
[1:52:25] in the world you say it's a good thing
[1:52:26] to have a good job it is brother just
[1:52:28] it's a good thing to have nice that's a
[1:52:29] good thing too but there's one thing
[1:52:31] that's more precious than all that and
[1:52:33] that's Jesus Christ
[1:52:35] amen amen
[1:52:38] yes because this fits these scriptures
[1:52:41] back up this Parable by the truth yes
[1:52:45] yeah is go and buy the field that had
[1:52:48] the Pearl right he had to buy the true
[1:52:51] field are you with me church he had to
[1:52:53] buy it so he had to pay a price and we
[1:52:56] have to pay the price of some some
[1:52:57] separation brother man says separating
[1:53:00] from people that don't believe yes buy
[1:53:03] the truth and sell it not so why would
[1:53:04] he buy the field and then sell he bought
[1:53:06] the field and kept it Glory he didn't
[1:53:09] buy it and sell it out like people were
[1:53:10] trying to get me to sell it out I'm not
[1:53:12] selling out the truth I bought it it's
[1:53:14] mine I paid the
[1:53:16] price because he paid the
[1:53:18] price
[1:53:20] amen
[1:53:22] amen and also wisdom and instruction and
[1:53:27] understanding the good Hearts understand
[1:53:30] the Mysteries all those 10 mysteries on
[1:53:32] Sunday night now all these seven makes
[1:53:34] 17 Mysteries and we understand all

[1:55:40] his trouble he still had that lust and
[1:55:42] that lust for greed in there that's why
[1:55:43] he sold out Jesus for 30 pieces of
[1:55:45] silver then Peter said Lo we have left

[1:56:47] him a little bit for some fellowship
[1:56:49] right
[1:56:50] amen come into the house and break bread
[1:56:52] with us there's something special about
[1:56:55] you and God was testing their faith
[1:56:57] sometime God test our faith and we must
[1:56:59] s out everything and cling to the pearl
[1:57:02] of great price in our
[1:57:05] lives and it returned back from him and
[1:57:08] took a yoke of ox and slew them I'm
[1:57:10] killing my previous
[1:57:12] life I'm separating all it's going to

[1:57:18] die
[1:57:20] I'm selling out lock sock and Barrel to
[1:57:23] following this message
[1:57:25] Elijah and he boiled their flesh with
[1:57:27] their instruments of ox and gave one of
[1:57:29] the people and then he then he arose and
[1:57:30] went after Elijah and ministered and he
[1:57:32] sold out everything yes and he bought a
[1:57:35] Ministry with Elijah right he had to
[1:57:38] sell out everything in order to buy a
[1:57:41] Ministry with God's Prophet
[1:57:44] yes I love this quote 1958 I know my
[1:57:46] redeemer
[1:57:47] liveth brother man praying for the
[1:57:49] people and he's kind of talking for them
[1:57:51] he says yes I was sitting in a little
[1:57:52] old black Tabernacle one beautiful
[1:57:54] Easter morning this was on
[1:57:56] Easter god raised up the curtain I
[1:57:58] looked to pass the curtain of time I see
[1:58:00] my church didn't mean very much praise
[1:58:04] God I seen there was nothing on Earth
[1:58:06] that meant very much to me anymore there
[1:58:09] I sold out everything I had I bought the
[1:58:12] pearl of great price I accepted Jesus as
[1:58:15] my
[1:58:16] savior and there's numerous quotes like
[1:58:18] this
[1:58:19] Christ is the pearl of great price I
[1:58:22] love this now here brother brings it to
[1:58:24] a deeper level he says the pearl of
[1:58:26] great price was the baptism of the Holy
[1:58:28] Ghost this is in 1963 after the seals I
[1:58:31] love that almost on my birthday Oh Glory
[1:58:34] three days away I'm just
[1:58:36] K that I lost my mind think I lost my
[1:58:40] mind even my good old righteous mother
[1:58:42] that di a few years ago when I first
[1:58:44] received the Holy Ghost there was no one
[1:58:46] in our country know anything about it
[1:58:47] and I was just a local little young B
[1:58:49] preach about 20 years old but when I
[1:58:51] received the Holy Ghost my mother said
[1:58:53] that boy has lost his mind see but no
[1:58:57] matter what mother thought I'd found
[1:59:01] that pearl of great
[1:59:03] [Music]
[1:59:05] price Hallelujah does the Bible say
[1:59:08] Christ is the unsearchable riches of
[1:59:11] Christ the pearl of great price is
[1:59:14] unsearchable
[1:59:16] riches oh it might have seemed like that
[1:59:19] to her but to me it was real see it was
[1:59:23] it was the genuine something that I had
[1:59:26] found in
[1:59:28] God
[1:59:30] hallelujah okay you ready for the last
[1:59:31] one then we'll
[1:59:33] close I thought I could get through all
[1:59:35] them tonight so God help me do
[1:59:38] that so I preached 16 Mysteries to you
[1:59:40] in the last few Services here's number
[1:59:45] 17 I also saw I got to look this up but
[1:59:47] one of the websites said the word
[1:59:49] charity is 17 times in the book of 1
[1:59:51] Corinthians
[1:59:52] 13 look
[1:59:55] that something special with
[1:59:57] 17 107 17 17 Nations on the day of
[2:00:01] Pentecost something special in
[2:00:04] there so the net cast into the sea
[2:00:08] Matthew 13 47-
[2:00:11] 50 now what I thought was interesting
[2:00:13] was this let me just bear give me a
[2:00:16] second uh in the end time Revelation
[2:00:20] 17 the Beast has seven
[2:00:24] heads and 10 what was the other one
[2:00:28] corns horns yeah or maybe it's vice
[2:00:30] versa it's one of those I pray make S so
[2:00:33] you add at 10 and seven you get
[2:00:35] 17 and then we've got 17 Mysteries and
[2:00:38] the gates of hell can't Prevail against
[2:00:39] this Revelation that's right right so it
[2:00:41] seems like God gave us seven that's why
[2:00:43] I said 17 seems like the right number
[2:00:45] right because Satan always impersonates
[2:00:47] what God has done right praise God go
[2:00:50] and then God raised up a standard we
[2:00:51] have the revelation of all these tricks
[2:00:53] you tried to pull Satan we've got all
[2:00:55] the revelation of the word of God we
[2:00:56] need for this hour we've got 17 and our
[2:00:59] 17 always conquer Satan 17 amen amen so
[2:01:03] just a little thought there I didn't
[2:01:04] have enough time to study out 17 I
[2:01:06] studed a little bit on numerology last
[2:01:07] night but have enough time to get to it
[2:01:09] by God's grace 10 by the way 10 looks
[2:01:11] like law and judgment because you have
[2:01:13] Ten Commandments that's the law and then
[2:01:15] 10 plagues which look like judgment so
[2:01:17] 10 looks like law and judgment
[2:01:19] uh but then you got the 10 vergs I'm not
[2:01:21] sure about that who had the law who had
[2:01:23] the Judgment well the Judgment would
[2:01:24] have been the foolish so I I'm just
[2:01:25] trying to understand okay so numerology
[2:01:28] is real a real touchy
[2:01:30] subject uh because you gotta make sure
[2:01:32] all lines
[2:01:34] up but anyways I just thought that was
[2:01:36] interesting okay the cat the net cast in
[2:01:38] the sea again the Kingdom of Heaven is
[2:01:40] like under a net that was cast in the
[2:01:41] sea and gathered of every
[2:01:44] kind which when it was full they drew
[2:01:46] the shore and sat down and gathered the
[2:01:48] good into vessels but Cast Away the
[2:01:54] bad so shall it be at the end of the
[2:01:56] world the angel shall come forth and
[2:01:58] separ the wicked from among the
[2:02:00] just and shall cast them into the
[2:02:02] furnace of fire and there should be
[2:02:04] wailing and nashing of teeth what a
[2:02:06] beautiful way to end this Jesus again
[2:02:09] interprets this Parable as one that
[2:02:11] deals with the end time is that
[2:02:12] beautiful amen look at this all these
[2:02:14] Parables deal with the end time and the
[2:02:16] Bible said the Mysteries couldn't be
[2:02:18] finished till the end
[2:02:20] amen they couldn't be understood until
[2:02:23] the end time why because they're about
[2:02:25] the end
[2:02:26] time that's beautiful right there
[2:02:31] Glory a net Goes Forth at the end time
[2:02:34] and gathers every kind of person good
[2:02:37] and wicked right so everybody's gathered
[2:02:41] together good and wicked Angels sever
[2:02:44] the wicked away from them and cast them
[2:02:46] in the furnace of fire this kind of
[2:02:47] sounds like the white Throne judgment I
[2:02:49] don't know it could be I don't know
[2:02:50] might be or it might be something like
[2:02:53] once they're bound you know in their
[2:02:54] economical Council and later burn the
[2:02:56] white thr judgment I'm not sure but it
[2:02:58] sounds a little bit like that and
[2:03:00] they're cast in a furnace of fire with
[2:03:02] weeping and nashing your teeth could be
[2:03:03] the burning right before the Millennium
[2:03:05] right we we walk out on the ashes of the
[2:03:07] wicked so it could be that too I don't
[2:03:09] know but I'm just saying what Jesus said
[2:03:11] so B says a little bit about this
[2:03:14] there's only one thing that we know to
[2:03:15] do and that's the follow the
[2:03:16] instructions our Lord left us preach to
[2:03:18] God Every Creature amen he knows who's
[2:03:21] saved and who's not we do not know
[2:03:25] that we don't know who's saved and who's
[2:03:28] not right we do not I'm sorry we just
[2:03:32] cast The Net into the sea bring forth of
[2:03:34] all kinds but God knows who's saved and
[2:03:36] who's not and no man can come to except
[2:03:38] the father's drawn him and all the
[2:03:39] father giv will come we know that so we
[2:03:41] can't say this one is a Christian that
[2:03:43] one isn't because he said the Kingdom of
[2:03:45] Heaven is like a man that took a great
[2:03:47] net and went to the SE and cast it in
[2:03:50] and when he taken the net in he had all
[2:03:51] kinds of things in there there would be
[2:03:53] water spiders bugs snakes and fish
[2:03:55] scavenger fish and good fish and but you
[2:03:58] see the water bugs and things finally
[2:04:00] crawl back in the water again but the
[2:04:02] good fish was Kept For The Master now we
[2:04:05] don't know which is we just cast The
[2:04:09] Net but remember that water bug was a
[2:04:12] water bug when the net went over him the
[2:04:15] influence of the meeting was what caught
[2:04:17] him the snake was still snake the gospel
[2:04:19] that just ped him in and the scavenger
[2:04:21] fish was a scavenger fish the turtle was
[2:04:23] a turtle the Crawfish was a crawfish see
[2:04:26] but the real fish was a fish to begin
[2:04:27] with so he knows which is because he had
[2:04:29] their names on his book yes put there
[2:04:32] when the lamb was slain before the
[2:04:34] foundation of the world and we are very
[2:04:37] or we here to try to do our part now
[2:04:40] brother Vic has been over on the counter
[2:04:42] casting the net for many
[2:04:44] years other ministers have been on other
[2:04:46] Corners casting the net I come to weave
[2:04:49] my net with you Brethren so that we can
[2:04:51] just make a great big cast and just keep
[2:04:54] pulling like fishermen on the corners of
[2:04:55] the lake one of these days the last fish
[2:04:58] will be taken from the
[2:04:59] lake fishing will be over then let us
[2:05:03] seek God with all of our hearts pray and
[2:05:05] be sincere as we see this hour
[2:05:07] approaching and stand to our feet why is
[2:05:09] that such a critical Parable because
[2:05:11] people think it anyone comes up to the
[2:05:13] alt thing they're saved is that true
[2:05:17] right they think anyone one that the
[2:05:19] gospel net has pulled in oh they're
[2:05:22] saved oh they're fish and Jesus said
[2:05:24] this is a mystery they're
[2:05:26] noten amen and only his elect angels
[2:05:29] will know which is which amen I say like
[2:05:32] this by their fruits you shall know
[2:05:34] them oh yes by their fruits you shall
[2:05:39] know them so we have 10 Bible
[2:05:41] Mysteries and I Nam them off I preached
[2:05:43] them on Sunday night plus seven Parable
[2:05:46] mysteries of Jesus Christ give us 17
[2:05:49] total New Testament Mysteries like I
[2:05:52] said I'm not sure what 17 means but I do
[2:05:54] know this the Bible said the mystery of
[2:05:57] God should be finished that's right and
[2:06:00] church how many can say by the grace of
[2:06:01] God you understand all 17 Bible
[2:06:04] Mysteries hallelujah amen
[2:06:09] glory is that right
[2:06:11] church we understand all those by the
[2:06:14] help of God Amen all 17 so I feel sad
[2:06:19] for anybody says oh the Mysteries aren't
[2:06:21] finished every mystery I've gone through
[2:06:23] every Bible word when it said mystery
[2:06:25] every time it said mystery those are the
[2:06:27] 17 doctrines and Parables that deal with
[2:06:30] Mysteries and the Bible said they'd be
[2:06:33] finished we are standing on the Rock of
[2:06:36] Ages glory and notice I didn't add my
[2:06:39] own thought I let the scripture
[2:06:42] interpret the
[2:06:44] scripture is that
[2:06:46] right even on the ones we have quotes
[2:06:48] for we just line that one up with the
[2:06:50] other one about the pro great price
[2:06:51] because it's it's the same principles Al
[2:06:54] together just a different thought one's
[2:06:56] for a man with land or uh yeah one for
[2:06:59] the field there treasure and then one's
[2:07:01] for a pearl yes praise the Lord let's
[2:07:05] bow our heads here sister going to come
[2:07:08] to thank you very
[2:07:12] much you know we've s a lot tonight and
[2:07:15] I hope you know if you didn't if you
[2:07:16] miss something you I hope you'll
[2:07:18] understand it that's kind of like the
[2:07:19] them of tonight amen I want you to
[2:07:22] understand what was preached I don't
[2:07:24] expect everybody to remember these
[2:07:26] things and that's not really the reason
[2:07:29] I preach it I preach it because I
[2:07:30] believe the mysteries of God are
[2:07:32] finished and I've never preached on
[2:07:34] these seven Parables ever before and
[2:07:37] this week they just seem to open up to
[2:07:38] me amen and church and then to watch as
[2:07:42] I study to watch the scripture interpret
[2:07:45] the scripture that's that's more that's
[2:07:47] the Pearl great Christ amen that's the
[2:07:50] spirit of Christ in my ministry that's
[2:07:52] right because there's nothing good that
[2:07:54] can come from Jesse Smith or any other
[2:07:58] preacher but when scripture interprets
[2:08:01] scripture when the word interprets
[2:08:03] itself and everything lines up just
[2:08:05] right amen that we can know that the
[2:08:08] Holy Spirit came down to reveal his word
[2:08:10] to us in a lot of these church we know
[2:08:13] our Prophet already told us what they
[2:08:15] meant just a few we had to looked to the
[2:08:17] scripture
[2:08:18] but they don't go against anything that
[2:08:20] was ever taught anything that was ever
[2:08:22] said by our Prophet or anything in the
[2:08:24] word of God they line up just exactly
[2:08:28] right what a privileged people we are to
[2:08:30] know all 17
[2:08:35] [Music]
[2:08:38] Mysteries there's something special
[2:08:40] about this number I'm not quite sure
[2:08:42] Revelation
[2:08:45] 10:7 10th day the seventh month day of
[2:08:47] atonement
[2:08:49] all these things
[2:08:51] church I don't fully understand it but I
[2:08:53] know one
[2:08:54] thing I want to be one of God's children
[2:08:57] I want to be one of the wheat seeds I
[2:09:00] want to be that good CR that hears the
[2:09:02] word and has a good and honest heart I
[2:09:05] don't want a dishonest heart I don't
[2:09:08] want to choke the word my life to where
[2:09:09] the word can't breathe the word's not
[2:09:11] getting life like it ought to the words
[2:09:13] are getting fueled I want the word to be
[2:09:16] fueled in my life how do say brother
[2:09:18] Jess want the word to be fued pray
[2:09:25] foress Heavenly Father we pray tonight
[2:09:28] for understanding yes we pray for that
[2:09:31] heart that brings forth a h
[2:09:34] hundredfold of what was planted or a
[2:09:37] heart of 60 fold or a heart of 30 fold
[2:09:41] one thing we know for sure we're not the
[2:09:42] Wayside we're in
[2:09:45] church we're not the Stony because we
[2:09:47] we've called we've come through trial
[2:09:49] after trial persecution after
[2:09:51] persecution and we're still standing we
[2:09:54] still joy in the word we first heard
[2:09:58] Am Lord where Ratt with the cares of the
[2:10:01] world all of us I do everyone
[2:10:04] does your Prophet said that was the
[2:10:06] struggle of this hour the cares of
[2:10:10] riches no other age really had to battle
[2:10:14] like we do because ours is the lat seen
[2:10:16] age Rich increas good
[2:10:20] Lord forgive us if we've lost our Focus
[2:10:23] off you this week dear Lord may we get
[2:10:26] our Focus back on the pearl of great
[2:10:29] there's a lot of pearls that are shining
[2:10:31] out there but Lord let our eyes be on
[2:10:34] the one Pearl that is the Pearl that's
[2:10:37] more valuable than all the other
[2:10:39] pearls may be more valuable than our
[2:10:41] family and our friends our Associates
[2:10:43] and our jobs and everything like that
[2:10:45] everything we have the pearl of Christ
[2:10:49] and our relationship with Christ may
[2:10:51] that be the
[2:10:53] Pearl that we sell out everything for
[2:10:56] amen this week May we sell out
[2:10:59] everything every day for this world de
[2:11:01] God I pray for your people that they'll
[2:11:04] do
[2:11:05] it thank you that you didn't inject Le
[2:11:08] in your doctr Lord thank you that the
[2:11:11] bride doesn't inject Le into her
[2:11:13] word but the Bible said we keep the
[2:11:16] feast with sincerity with unleavened
[2:11:19] worship dear
[2:11:21] God and sincerity and Truth dear Lord
[2:11:24] there's no leav in this bride your
[2:11:26] Prophet said
[2:11:29] that so we thank you dear God help us to
[2:11:32] live that kind of a life help us to
[2:11:34] overcome by the revelation of these
[2:11:36] Mysteries and the revelation of the
[2:11:38] minors too yes because you said Lord it
[2:11:42] wasn't mean you said the Mysteries will
[2:11:44] be finished and Lord we just standing
[2:11:46] all tonight to see every time the Bible
[2:11:48] calls a mystery you've showed it to us
[2:11:51] by the
[2:11:52] word only you can do that Lord and the
[2:11:55] rest of the church is scratches their
[2:11:56] head or they think they got the right
[2:11:58] answer but it's actually contrary to
[2:11:59] everything in the
[2:12:01] Bible it doesn't puff us up like Le it
[2:12:04] makes us
[2:12:05] humble God look what you showed me now
[2:12:08] it's and then Lord we feel the weight of
[2:12:11] responsibility of wanting to live this
[2:12:14] and share with others your
[2:12:16] abil may we use just something as simple
[2:12:19] as inviting somebody in church maybe
[2:12:20] this week Lord or maybe something simple
[2:12:22] as just giving out a card or giving out
[2:12:24] a Bible or giving out a sermon or just
[2:12:26] something simple just to try to pass on
[2:12:28] that Pearl great price we know most of
[2:12:30] the time it'll be rejected in fact in
[2:12:33] your first Parable only 25% of the seed
[2:12:36] fell good ground one out
[2:12:39] four but I imagine the percentage is
[2:12:41] worse than that now but Lord you were
[2:12:43] just given a parable a very small
[2:12:46] percentage not even the majority of our
[2:12:48] efforts will bring forth
[2:12:50] yes how few of my sermons actually bring
[2:12:52] forth we'd say a New Soul we get Lord I
[2:12:56] know how many sermons are Lord are
[2:12:57] bringing forth changed lives and
[2:12:59] repentance hearts and souls that love
