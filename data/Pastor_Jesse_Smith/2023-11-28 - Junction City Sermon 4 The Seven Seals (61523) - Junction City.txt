TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh by the grace of God we'll TR try to hit the highlights on the Seven Seals and I have a little sheet for you I'll pass out after we uh read the word of God here Revelation 6 yes yes sir Revelation chap 6 verse one we'll just read verses 1 and two because the rest Lord willing we'll be reading here for the next hour so I'll try to preach about an hour here so let me set a timer Revelation chapter 6 verses 1 and two maybe we can all read both verses verses 1 and two maybe we can all read it together in unison let's begin on three 1 2 3 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer may God add His blessings to the re's word may be seated and I'm going to pass these out here um I got my copy highlighted a little bit so I'm going to keep that copy myself and I'll give these to the adults the children want one do you want one buddy do that okay maybe all right you like one we'll start on the side that says seven Church ages at the top and I just made this in about an hour before I left so I didn't have a whole lot of time to work on it I had a busy Daye today uh and yesterday but um we'll start on this side which says the Seven Seals sorry the seven Church ages rather there's two or willing we'll just try to cover this briefly uh uh I got the grace of God and also I can share with brother Irvin and any I guess really anybody who's interested but I like I like the Elder you know I like to share everything with the Elder cuz he's been around and serving God the longest and has uh likely the mo no doubt likely the most wisdom and experience with the word of God uh because I I I want to make sure I I I say everything as possibly as as true as possible you I'm a human I'm I'm prone to mistakes but I want to say exactly what's right uh by the grace of God I want to represent the ministry or the message that God gave to brother brandom correctly and then I want you to uh I want uh brother Iran as the Elder to be able to uh ask questions and if anyone has any questions you're welcome but I want him uh to be able to review it if he'd like to because uh he's he's the Elder by God's grace um I have a little note here with a few reminders I want to remind myself here um before we start that just a few uh quotes brother Bram said about uh the Seven Seals just so you know uh brother Brandon preached the Seven Seals in March of 1963 uh so I think that's 54 years ago if I'm not mistaken maybe 55 um and he preached each seal one night uh during a whole week well before he preached him he would read other books other preachers preach for example Clarence Lin Uriah Smith and Charles Tas Russell those are leaders of other groups like for example Lin was a Baptist uh Charles T Russell if I'm not mistaken uh was uh Jehovah's Witness if I'm not mistaken or Seventh Day Adventist sometimes I get those mixed up um so anyways brother R read different writers men who had died and wrote about the Seven Seals but then as you can hear on tape each morning before he'd preach like the first seal the Holy Spirit would visit him and actually show the true interpretation of the seal so brother R was doing his part to study preachers and to try to find the will of God but then the Holy Spirit would come through show him the vision he'd write it down and then he' go preach it that night and then he'd say that's thus sayeth the Lord I've never heard every preacher say that before right and that would make sense because he was a prophet of God he was a man of God which one brother you need anything oh was TR oh how to record it you can sit up here you want record yeah that's fine bro you have to set right up here have to grab my Bible out of the oh yeah that's go ahead you fine I think I can get it that's nice place for your Bible there yep that's fine praise God Amen so brother bam uh tells us that he read all these books other words brother R was a studied man he tried to study as much as he could and understand what other men had said but uh when those men were wrong the Holy Spirit would come and show him the truth of the revelation of it Hallelujah and he said that uh numerous times and even before he preached the first seal he said this he said I would have absolutely had a horrible mistake on that first seal if it hadn't been about 12:00 when the Holy Spirit came in the room and corrected me on something that I was writing down to say say okay and then he goes on to say the Holy Spirit just swept right down to the room and the whole thing just opened up he says and this first seal is opened I'm just I'm as positive and as I'm standing here tonight this is the gospel truth that I'm going to say here I just know it is so brother man read the books and was kind of confused on what to say but then the Holy Spirit would come in show him the vision and then he could stand there and say I'm not guessing if this is right this is thus sayeth the Lord so that's how we know of course and and everything he taught lines up with the rest of the Bible that's that's I just want to share that and then when brother Ram got to the end of preaching this whole week long on the Seven Seals he says of all the services I've ever had in my life I believe this week has been the most glorious time of all of my life in Services no matter what I have I've seen great Miracles performed of course before and healing services but this is beyond that it's been one of the great times highlights of my life is to be here now think about that brother Braham saw cripples get out of Cs brother Braham saw uh blind people received their sight brother R saw the dead raised but he said preaching these Seven Seals was the greatest services in all my life because the Holy Spirit visited him every day and showed him the revelation of the Seven Seals amen hallelujah in other words the healings were great but when when this Services came he knew exactly what the Holy Spirit wanted him to know about this Seven Seals in other words he wasn't guessing he wasn't hoping this was right it was thus sayith the Lord right amen so I just want you to show you what value brother randam pray placed on the seven seal sermons this was the greatest Services now there's other uh quotes from Brother Bram like a year after he preached these and he said if I ever preach anything that was inspired it was those Seven Seals because the Holy Spirit would visit him every day and show him the revelation of these seals so I don't have the book with me but you probably seen that black book where it's the revelation of the Seven Seals it's brother Ram sermons I read through that entire book and I listened to all the sermons over the course of my Ministry I would encourage you to do the same also read the seven Church ages the seven Church age book and listen to the seven Church age sermons from December of 1960 if you make those your your main listening and reading you will be established in this truth God's God's Bible Revelation because that's what I've seen in my life because I dedicated so much time to the church ages and the Seven Seals I feel like no man can deceive me I know that's quite a statement but that's what I believe by God's grace because I stayed with what the Holy Spirit showed brother brandham in the word of God so I would encourage you and I brother uh irin I preach over 125 sermons just on the Book of Revelation I went back and counted one time because they were all on YouTube and I could go back and count I was looking at my notes just on the Book of Revelation not not on any other books just the Book of Revelation because I want I wanted to be I want the people to be established right and the Bible says you're blessed just to read the book of Revelation amen then to hear it and then keep it you're beyond blessed Hallelujah and that's what I can see in my life my wife and I just passed 20 years of marriage so I I could say truly we're Beyond blessed amen by the grace of God hallelujah with spiritual blessings natural blessings but of course the most important are spiritual blessings knowing you're saved knowing you're filled with the Holy Ghost knowing you're going to heaven praise God knowing that you're walking the truth that God wants you to walk in it's the greatest thing you can have it's the peace of God that passes all understanding amen so I want to just read that just so you knew brother M consider these were the greatest sermons he ever preached was the Seven Seals okay now I like if if you would let's see here what else other notes I have on here um yeah start I thought i' start with those quotes just so you knew what brother Bram said about the Seven Seals uh now uh I think oh yeah I just want to briefly before we read from Revelation chap 6 in Revelation chap 5 you probably remember St John was given a vision of heaven and he's in heaven and he starts weeping because there's a book yeah in heaven and no man is worthy to go and take the book right the Bible said he was weeping and crying but then all of a sudden a voice calls out and says don't weep because the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to open the book amen hallelujah and the Bible said then John looked to see the lion and it turned out to be a lamb Hallelujah like a lamb that he was slain like Jesus amen hallelujah and he had seven eyes and seven horns so what amazing things are going on in heaven praise God what amazing uh creatures God God makes himself and and other creatures Angels he has in heaven praise God Amen well then the lamb goes and takes the book right and then the Bible said John shouted so loud that all everyone in Heaven everyone in Earth everyone everything that was in the ocean heard John shout and rejoice because Jesus had taken God's book and was going to open it amen in other words the book and the book was sealed with Seven Seals now a seal represents privacy right anybody ever had a diary before and you had a little seal on the front like a leather strap or something or a lock like at our school they sell diaries that have locks on them and you got to have a key to get into that diary right that's kind of what the Seven Seals represented seven SEALS or seven uh kind of like locks on it or seals in those days they had seals where you have to break the seal to open the the scroll and that's what brother man tells us there were seven Scrolls or seven uh straps on it and now John is rejoicing because Jesus is now going to break these seals and tell us the Contex of what's in these Scrolls it's a Heavenly book praise God and then the Bible tells us it was a Plan of Redemption so the the Seven Seals show God's plan to redeem the church okay or rescue the church from Satan and actually it shows all all all the time from the beginning of the church ages so after Jesus went to heaven and sent the Holy Ghost it shows all the time from the church ages until the future home in other words the end of the Bible in other words the End of Time amen so it shows all the time from the the beginning of the church until there's a new uh New Jerusalem it's that pyramid City that comes down out of heaven and brother man preaching a sermon about that called the future home of the Heavenly bride and the Earthly bridegroom it's like a three-hour sermon it's a beautiful sermon if you haven't listened to that from 1964 raise your hands anybody listened to that one yet okay that's a good one you want to listen to In other words it's just it's like the the entire chapter of Revelation 21 if you ever wonder about that City that comes down from heaven that's the New Jerusalem praise God what did you call that the the Ser the sermon is called the future home of the Heavenly bride and an Earthly bridegroom it's from 1964 you can just look up the future home it'll come up from 1964 it's a beautiful message brother Ram uses uh numerous thoughts from Clarence Larin but then he also gets a revelation from the Holy Spirit uh that's about the three works of Grace and how the the Earth has to go through three processes to cleanse it water which was Noah's flood blood Jesus shed his blood and then fire the Bible said Peter said the Earth will melt with fervent heat fire so water Blood Fire right and that's justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost it's three Works God always uses three works of Grace to redeem us amen so it's a beautiful it's a beautiful message I mean it's it's phenomenal it's from the Holy Spirit praise God but that's another topic for another time maybe maybe next week by God's grace we go over that we'll see or I'm sorry two weeks by God's grace um but anyways in re in Revelation chap 5 Jesus Takes the book and now in chapter 6 he's opening the book he's opening the book and then John is going to see what happens the book is open each seal is open and then John sees the symbols it's kind of like it's kind of like the books the Scrolls open and then John sees the symbols that are on the scroll okay and so that's what we're going to see by God's grace now before we read that as well now you got your sheet here uh on the front which has the seven Church ages if you have hav been taught this this is another lesson maybe I'll teach but it says seven Church ages Revelation chapters 2 and 3 so if you're familiar with that there's seven letters that Jesus or seven messages that Jesus sent to seven different churches and they were actually real churches around 90 or 100 AD and Jesus sent them special messages from John and John was supposed to send them the letters now what's amazing is that those leral churches had conditions that were prophetic of what was going to happen in history for the next 2,000 years it's amazing so whatever whatever problems and whatever situations those seven churches were going through that's that was prophetic of what was actually going to happen over the next 2,000 years it's amazing it's beautiful how God works out like that so the there's a letter to Ephesus but actually that letter was prophetic of what was going to happen from the years 53 to 70 AD and this this age lasted 117 years now hopefully I haven't lost anybody yet because this get gets kind of deep but and then Paul was the messenger to this age in other words um Paul was the angel because the word angel means a messenger Paul was the messenger Jesus sent to preach to them and whatever Paul preached that was going to be shared with everybody else okay now then Paul of course Paul died around uh I think it was if I'm not mistaken I think it was 60 7 ad if I'm not mistaken anyways he he was he came he preached and he went home to be with the Lord but this this age lasted from uh to 170 now then a second Church age started was the called The samerian Church age that lasted from about 170 to 312 and this lasted about you know 30 years longer about 1422 years and irius was the messenger to this age and I I in my book I have I have whole writings on this that back up what brother brandom wrote brother random wrote and preached about it so just so you know I have a whole chapter on the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals in there and it it basically just kind of summarizes what brother Brandon preached about it okay and then the Third Church age was pergamos from about 312 to 606 this was almost a 300E Church age uh St Martin was a messenger to this age and these all these men had tremendous Miracles tremendous Supernatural signs like you brother man talks about them you brother man talks about I mean I can't even begin to explain that's why I wrote about it because you can't even begin to scratch the surface of how these were Mighty Men of God now the next Church age was the longest it was the thoran church age this almost this lasted over 900 years from 606 to 1502 and Columba was the church age Messenger to thyra now the Sardis Church age was a time period from 1502 to 1750 this lasted 230 years Martin Luther was the church messenger he was the preacher of the Reformation right he preached that just shall live by faith he brought the church he brought Believers out of the Roman Catholic system now the Philadelphian Church age was uh the open door age where there was the greatest missionary work ever done in the history of the world that was from 1750 to 1906 it lasted 156 years and and John Wesley was the messenger he lived to be 88 years old and sometimes he would preach seven or eight sermons a day brother so who are we compared to these guys the these are giants of the faith we're not trying to worship man we never worship man but just let's give them some credit these were giants of the faith men of God that labored and he only had horseback to ride uh he would preach out in fields to thousands of people in fields uh just Mighty Men of God and of course now we are in the leoan church age it's that last age up at the top in the right hand corner it started around 1906 that's the Year brother Brandon was born and it it's not over yet it will go into the Rapture and this is already at 117 years so we're seeing already you know if we have one more year uh Leo deia will not be the the shortest Church age Ephesus will be the shortest Church age because that only lasted 117 years and of course Brandon brother brandom was the messenger of this age because he point us back to the Bible he had Supernatural visitations he had signs wonders and miracles he spoke with thus say the Lord amen now if you notice now underneath that now I have the Seven Seals now notice the sizes of the seals the boxes are are different right the first seal second seal the third seal is the biggest and then the fourth seal is the smallest that's because brother R gave us clues about how long the seals lasted so let's start uh let's go now back to our Bible now and then we'll preach on the first seal briefly just want to give you a good understanding a good overview of it okay so Revelation 6 verse 1 and 2 now this is Jesus uh opening breaking the seal and then John sees what's what's in that scroll what's in that first seal scroll and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and the conquer now this first seal is basically church history or the anointings the two the two anointings that battled from about 30 ad to 385 ad so the first seal is the anointing of the Beast which in this case is a lion the first Beast was The Lion Okay so this first group this first time period from 30 to 385 ad it was the White Horse which was the Antichrist spirit the White Horse went writing Satan went writing to try to combat the Believers okay but he was battling the Christians who had the anointing of a lion okay and brother B said the lion was the powerful bold anointing upon the early church because the Bible says in Proverbs the righteous are as bold as a lion amen hallelujah and the Bible said a lion's like an un a prophet right in Amos 3: 7 and 8 okay now let's go through some of these symbols so the Beast of the first seal was the lion and we get the order in Revelation chap 4 if I'm not mistaken yeah I'm going to go back there briefly uh if if you ever B go to Revelation 4:7 this tells you the order of the Beast and there's a special order for the Beast brother Ram says these beasts are thus sayi the Lord in other words these beasts are anointings that are on the church Hallelujah so Revelation 4:7 and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf or like a ox and the third Beast had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle okay so now you can turn back to Revelation chapter 6 so now you know the four beasts brother Adam said these beasts are the anointings of the Holy Spirit okay so when when the when the Believers were living during this time period in the first first seal which was kind of like the Ephesus and samna and part the beginning of the pergamos church Age The Believers had the anointing of the Holy Ghost like a lion they were bold they had power like we know like brother mam said he's heard brother Maham heard a lion roar in the forest and then all the other animals shut up because they're all scared because he's the king of the jungle right Hallelujah and so the anointing of the Holy Ghost was so powerful on the apostles they just spoke the word of God and everything else shut up right there was such power where Peter said if if the Bible said they lied to Peter and the Bible said that ananas and safire that lied to Peter they died it was such a powerful ministry right they right they died and they had to carry their bodies out the Bible said Peter could walk through and his shadow think about that his shadow would heal people just his shadow it was the anointing of the Holy Spirit praise God W and church you know just so you know even uh Perry green he gave the testimony where he he spent time with brother brandom and then after brother died perig green would go and then he would walk by people and and he's testified that his shadow people got in his shadow and they were healed as well because the people had such Faith they had faith in brother bram's gift and now they had faith in uh Perry Green's gift so we see church that that what God does is he raises people's Faith praise God and when the word of God is preached and people know it's true and the Holy Spirit shows his trueth it raises the faith of the people and the people then can believe for miracles amen they can believe for Supernatural they can re they can believe for anything whatever God's leading them to believe they can receive it praise God like last Sunday we had such anointed service right and a brother I didn't even know but I said brother are you having a migraine I just was wondering he'd have migraines sometimes I didn't know if he was having one I said brother are you having a migraine and he said yes I'm having a migraine right now I said well at the end of the service you come up for prayer because he's battled migraines off and on and I could just feel people were rejoicing and there was such a you could I could just feel Faith in the room praise God hallelujah and so we come up for prayer we prayed and we rebuked the Satan and he said during that prayer the migraine just vanished away amen praise God and so after church I let the church know that we just rejoiced amen that God that God we when when when people believe when people are in tune with God then God will come back and back up the word of God hallelujah amen oh I just I was so blessed to see that praise God God delivered him right in the midst of his trial now back to the uh chapter 6 verse2 and I saw Behold a white horse now brother said that white means innocent deception of the false teachers so other words Satan was going around real innocently like oh we're Christians but then we know we know the changes he made John and brother iring he brought in infant baptism that was one of his lies he brought in prayers uh prayers to the Saints he brought that in in the first in the first few Church ages right the Roman Catholic church so this white horse rider is Satan in the ran Roman Catholic Church spreading lies they changed the baptism the father son Holy Ghost baptism in that first age they got they already Satan had already tricked them into taking away the true name of the Lord Jesus Christ baptism now not the real Believers a real believer can't be deceived praise God hallelujah but Satan was he was already starting to pervert with his false teaching it was an antichrist spirit that white horse rider brother man tells us is the same spirit it's the Antichrist spirit okay so the White Horse Ride Now look brother Adam says notice he said he had a bow but brother Adam said look no arrows so brother said that means he's a bluffer Satan's like a roaring lion but he really can't devour you brother say he's like a roaring lion who has no teeth that's what brother said in the sermon so listen to the first seal said he's a bluffer and isn't that true s San will Bluff us all the time just to make us fearful fearful and we'll worry about something and later find out we had nothing to worry about amen he's just bluffing in other words Satan has no power unless God gives it to him and even if God gives it to him God has the most power praise God Amen Hallelujah now other scriptures you can show too how the Bible said Satan shoots his bows like lies I have entire videos I have entire I have a whole chapter on this so I can't get to all the scriptures and I didn't have time to write them all down but it's say if Satan went out he shot all his lies but then he's got nothing left he's a liar he's a bluffer in other words don't believe Satan believe Jesus he's the way the truth and the life amen Satan comes to steal kill and destroy but Jesus came that you might have life and have it more abundantly praise God all right now and then the Bible said a crown was given un him brother R says this was the uh this was the early leader the of the Church of Rome at some point because he was a false teacher they gave him a crown and brother bam also says at some point the Catholic Church organized and they gave the pope a crown which he does wear a crown sure there's times he wears a crown when he travels he doesn't he's got that white cap on right but he does at times can he does wear a crown at times a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer so see brother Bram says it's Satan trying to conquer the True Believers but it's a battle praise God it depends which which side are you on are you on the side of the White Horse or are you the side of the lion we're on the side of the Believers praise God Amen Hallelujah there's no white horse that can defeat God's anointing praise God but Satan did accomplish he went he conquered a lot of people he deceived a lot of people but the True Believers could never be deceived oh thank God that Jesus said that amen Allelujah Jesus said you cannot deceive he said false prophets arise and he said they'll deceive the very elect if it were possible but then brother tells us as the Bible says it's not possible to deceive God's elect Hallelujah church we have nothing to Fe we have nothing to worry about God won't let you be tricked amen God won't let Satan trick you because you're a real believer praise God hallelujah amen okay so there's your first seal last in now the reason it ends about 385 is that's when the that's the first time and that's in the book 385 was the first time there were Martyrs killed by the Roman Catholic Church just so you know and that represented a change in the seals because it's a change of the horse rider now brother said brother said that Rider rode the White Horse but then he jumped off his White Horse and then he hopped on a bloody red one okay so now let's read the second seal so the Antichrist Spirit was writing he's a white innocent teacher but then about 385 he jumped off and he jumps on a red bloody horse brother Bram says and that was the year of the first martyring done the first killing of Christians done by the Roman Catholic Church 385 and that's in the book I got all the history I Ed the same history books brother Bram did okay so all right so the second seal uh verse three and when he opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see now the second beast of course was the calf or oxen right baby Ox young Ox verse four and there went out another horse that was red now brother says red as i r there was the blood bloody red blood shed by the United Roman church and state so it's right around this time that the the the Roman Empire United with the Roman Catholic Church do you know the Emperor who United them what was his name do you remember Constantine guys hallelujah amen now most denominations love the guy but we know he was an evil man did you know he murdered his mother and his son at the end of his life and they they they all say oh he was a Godly Christian no Christians don't murder wow he was a he had a false conversion is what the Bible says he was a worker of iniquity but Constantine marri the church and state together there's all the history I got it right in there brother Ram gives us all the history too I me read the church age book listen to The Seven Seals brother R puts it all in there you can hear all of it Hallelujah my uh and power was given unto him that sat there on to take peace from the earth so see it's the Roman Catholic Church that took peace off the Earth because now they had power to kill brother R tells us that came through the writing of St Augustine of Hippo now most church people today oh say Augustine was a godly man but we know he actually led the Catholic Church to start killing people if they wouldn't come into the Catholic faith so see brother randam was given the right history by the Holy Spirit In other words the Holy Spirit directed brother Ram to the right history books amen hallelujah thank God and that they should kill one another and there was given on him a great sword okay so the red means now the Roman Catholic Church is Anointed to kill anyone who disagrees with them but what are the Believers Anointed with most of them are anointed with this ax anointing which brother R says it's the anointing to be a sacrifice to give yourself as a martyr because isn't that what animals do don't they give them don't they just labor all the time that's just that's all they don't complain they just go work you know and then they you know they die right we kill them we eat their meat you know we eat their eggs or whatever you know right the chicken eggs I mean there're just beast of burden and so the anointing of the Holy Spirit during this time is from 385 to 1095 I put on the sheet there because 1095 is agreed it's about the time when the Dark Age just started okay and that's the next seal the third seals the Dark Ages all right so can everybody see that Satan first was deceiving on a white horse but then he got power of church and state and now Satan this Antichrist Spirit jumps on a red horse and now he can kill anybody who disagrees with them because he's got power now to do it he's not just a he's not just a a false church now he's church and state together all right sure and he wrode notice if you look up there to the top he wrode during the pergan church age and part of the thyo church age if you kind of look and see how overlaps there's an overlap there all right now the third seal this is an awesome seal so hope hope you like this one by God's grace I mean they're all awesome but this one especially is wonderful first verse 5 Revelation 6:5 and when he opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see now that's the anointing of a man it's a face of a man so we went lion then we went ox or calf and then went man and I beheld in low a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand now brother BR says the black represent the Dark Ages so now this is the Roman Catholic Church during the Dark Ages Church did you know during the Dark Ages the Roman Catholic Church destroyed every language of the Bible except Latin before before that time there was 500 languages you could read the Bible in but during the Dark Ages the Catholics destroyed all the Bible so they're the only ones who had the truth except there was a small group uh Columba Columba and his group had their own Bible versions amen and because of them because of Columba and all his followers we have a Bible today praise God wow God used Columba and he had he he had an island of Scholars he had an island of Holy Ghost filled Believers far away from Rome right in the Roman Empire and that's where God kept his people that's where he kept his word saved God always has a special place where he preserves the Believers amen Satan thought he could destroy all the Bibles but God said no I'm going to hide it out there with Columba and all the saints amen hallelujah praise God but Satan used the Catholic Church to get rid of all the the Bible translations and all the languages except Latin and then people are sitting there hearing the the the their their sermons in Latin and many of them don't even understand it they're German or whatever they are you know uh they speak Greek or whatever AR Aramaic but again and that's what we have today we have people that go to Catholic churches and they want to hear the mass in Latin and they don't even know what they're they don't even can't even understand it no wonder the Bible calls it mystery Babylon right the Abominations of the the Harlot the mother Harlot she's the mother of confusion but see we come to we come to church you come here tonight and you want to know what the Bible says praise God you want to know what the preacher is saying because you know there's life in the word of God and if he's preaching truth you'll receive truth and you'll have God's eternal life hallelujah amen H I feel good I preached last night too so I'm feeling good tonight hallelujah thank God Amen now so now brother Ram said the the man Beast represents the anointing on the reformers and these Scholars like Columba and then it you see it carries over to Martin Luther and John Wesley they had the wisdom of a man to know these lies from the Catholic Church brother gives the example he said brother God gave Martin Luther the anointing of a man to know that bread and wine are not the literal body and blood of Jesus right he had the he had the anointing of the Holy Spirit Martin Luther to know it's just the bread it's just wine right in other words he knew thank you buddy I appreciate it you're really kind you did that last time thank you bu he had the wisdom to know there's no such thing as transubstantiation right he had he had the wisdom to know you can't pray to an idol if you pray to an idol nothing's going to happen I mean it's just an idol yet Catholics will they pay homage to statues to this day oh yeah we just met a man who does that we met a man but now he's coming to church he's starting to see the light so oh his name is K so if you think of it pray for him wow he had a really good time at church on Sunday so hopefully he keeps coming back and God brings him out of Catholicism I preached against I right there I said Jesus said call no man father because they call their their priest Holy Father or father so and so I preach it right there I said Jesus Christ said call no man father so he stayed so that's good hopefully hope hopefully he'll open his heart to more the word of God all right now so now you know what the third seal is it was a time period from about 1095 to about 1906 when the last anointing would come that's the eagle anointing but we're not done with the third seal here's the best best part now look at Revelation 6 verse5 at the end of the verse it says he had a pair of balances in his hand so Satan in the form of the Antichrist spirit is riding during the Dark Ages and he's got bounces in his hand what does he say verse six and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure I'm sorry a measure of we wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and I'm going to stop right there now notice this voice actually was the voice of Christ brother Ram says notice it's the voice it's in the midst of the four beasts so where was Jesus Jesus was standing there with the the scroll he's opening the seals and then the anoint the beasts are around him right there the Bible said they worship God they cry holy holy holy Lord God Almighty but a a voice comes out of the Beast and says that these balance represent a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny brother Ram said Jesus was saying that the Roman Catholic Church would control economics and food during the Dark Ages which they did Brother BR said the third seal was Satan capturing the wealth of the world isn't that what the Catholics did didn't they have Crusades to build up their money right that's why they had Crusades to go ravish places and take all their treasur so they could build their their big buildings that they got and that and so he Satan was writing with balances I'm going to capture the wealth of the world I'm going to control economics and finances it's exactly right Hallelujah and brother did you know that they used to do indulgences in the Dark Ages so an Indulgence is where you have to confess your sin to the priest but but you could pay money to be forgiven of that sin so like let's let's say a man uh let's say a man killed somebody he could go to the priest and confess it and let's say PID $3 and he'd be forgiven well why did the Catholic Church do that to make money indulgences it was it was so much money you could uh you could slap a priest for so much money you could you could uh have adulteries you could rape somebody you could do all these things for all these amounts of money and that's how the Catholic church was capturing the wealth of the world I want you to notice this last statement in the in the third seal look at verse 6 Revelation 6:6 the last sentence says and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine Hallelujah so Jesus calls out in the midst of this Dark Ages Jesus calls out he calls out to the Roman Catholic Church don't hurt the oil and the wine brother says what's the oil the oil is the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah and what's the wine brother ra said it's the Joy or the stimulation that comes on you when God reveals something to you amen hallelujah so in the midst of Dark Ages in the midst of any time when when Satan's getting uh when he's conquering people and he's steal he's taking money in the midst of any dark situation especially the Dark Ages Jesus says I'm protecting the oil and wine you can't touch the Holy Ghost In other words anyone that wants to be born again can be born again anybody that wants to experience the joy of the Lord can have the joy of the Lord cuz Jesus said he can't touch it praise God and church that ought to give you confidence that Satan can never destroy your life Satan can never take your life he can as far as he can never deceive you he can never take you off away from the holy spirit because Jesus said he cannot touch it praise God Amen Hallelujah praise God how many remember do you remember Ephesians 4:30 the Bible says grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption in other words God's presence in your life it's going to be a seal it's going to be like a stamp it's going to be like a brand y all brand animals out here no used to Nebraska used to in Nebraska so that that's what the Bible says that seal means a brand I'm glad they don't do in Ohio right glad that's a good thing right they don't do branding is that a good thing I hope so just having pity on the animals but that's that's what the Bible says God seals you with his holy spirit God gives you a brand amen that means God says you're mine brother Irvin and he and he Brands he puts his holy spirit inside of you and nothing can take away that brand of the Holy Spirit that's the same thing Jesus saying Satan cannot touch the oil the Holy Spirit the brand Holy Spirit the Satan cannot touch the Sea of the holy spirit because it's God marking you you're his for all time for all eternity praise God a't that awesome you'll never belong to Satan you always belong to Jesus Christ hallelujah praise God amen so I want you to know that Jesus says no matter how dark it gets no matter how much money of the Catholic Church gets and all the wickedness they do Satan cannot touch the oil and the wine you can still have joy Sister Sarah you can still have the joy the stimulation of the Revelation you can still have the wine of the Holy Spirit you can still have the oil of the Holy Spirit Satan cannot touch it God's power is protected on your life hey amen now the four seal for seal verse 7 Revelation 6 ver7 and when he opened the force seal I heard the voice of the force Beast this is the flying eagle say come in see verse eight and I looked and behold a Pale Horse now brother says pale if you look on your sheet is like that's a disease that's the color of leprosy in the Old Testament is pale right and we all know leprosy is like a death disease right it's a it's a a flesh eating disease so here the riter is now pale he's a par horse rider brother says this is spiritual death so like if you had leprosy without medicine what is it it's automatic death right it's just going to eat you up slowly eat you up and so the last Rider and this is church the last horse there's no horses in the fifth Seal The Sixth Seal the seventh seal this is the last horse rider the last horse rider is is spiritual death in other words brother man said it's spiritual death because he's got a name yeah we got a name right here let's look at let's look at verse eight and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that that sat on him was death and Hell Followed him now stop right there this is the same writer that's been riding for three four horses in a row but we don't know his name until the fourth horse we don't know his name until the Beast says this is this is death and what does that represent that represent the eagle represents a prophet Ministry it takes a prophet Ministry it takes the anointing of a prophet that was on brother brandom to call out and recognize who this writer is now we know who he is he's death he's spiritual death and it takes the anointing of the flying eagle in other words it takes the ministry God gave to brother RAM for us to recognize these Seven Seals and also call out and recognize spiritual death church not many churches can look at the Roman Catholic church today and say there's death there right most churches will say oh we love the pope he's a nice man he's a good man he's so kind he he he kisses the babies and everything but brother Brandon would look and see look what he's teaching look at what the Pope's teaching it's death Hallelujah transubstantiation right worshiping praying to Mary praying to dead Saints brother R look at that say that's not life that's death Hallelujah and thank God you've got eyes that can see the truth and You' got ear that can hear the word of God hallelujah thank God Amen now notice when how when does he ride he rides from 1906 until Armageddon because brother R says verse eight verse eight tells how he makes his final ride and he makes his final ride at the Battle of armagan which is in Revelation chapter 19 but we're not going to read that tonight for time sake I'm already I'm already at 40 45 minutes that's hard to believe let's read verse 8 again Revelation 6:8 and I looked and behold a pale horse that's the same rider that's the Antichrist spirit and his name that sat on him was death and Hell Followed him and brother man says hell always follows death right when someone dies and they're a sinner where do they go hell so hell always follows death for the unbeliever right and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword with hunger and with death and with the Beast of the earth now of course this is brother man says this is his last ride so this this spiritual pale death is riding today he's riding today but his last ride he'll get he'll get control to kill a fourth part of the earth he'll kill with Hunger death and the Beast of the earth okay and that's seen at the battle of Armageddon well let's just read that one verse let's go to Revelation 19 let's read that here thank you m I appreciate that little water buddy thank you sir and the Bible says brother Micaiah that anyone who gives a glass of water in the name of a a disciple or in the name of Jesus has a reward so you got a reward buddy Hallelujah Jesus said you'll receive a reward you give a you give a name of a glass you give a glass of water in the name of a disciple name of a servant of God God will give you a reward Hallelujah Revelation 19 now go to verse 11 Revelation 1911 and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire this is Jesus and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God verse 14 and the armies which were in heaven foued him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean now who is that that's you because when you get when you when you get saved when you get filled with the Holy Ghost the Bible said you have white Robes of righteousness so when Jesus comes back at arm again he's in the front and we're all behind him we're backing him up but church he really don't need no backing up Jesus can take care of himself right but he's just showing the devil look here's all my Army all these ones you kill down Through the Ages here's Paul and Peter and James and John there's brother Brandon there's all these Saints there's Martin Luther these were these were this was my real army these are the real Believers praise God and they're roed in white and they sit on white horses amen and white is the righteousness of saints which is the righteousness of Jesus Christ and because you believe Sister Sarah and sister Ruth because you believe in Jesus Christ he's given you his righteousness that's the tradeoff Jesus paid for your sins and brother irin you get his righteousness Hallelujah you got a white robe praise God and there's a picture of you coming out of heaven with Jesus did you know you're in that verse well now you do now I can Rejoice say one day iide ride a white horse I've never rode a horse but that day I will Hallelujah now I'm not I got to skip over this but he sends a sword out of his mouth and it destroys all these armies now these armies are they're Russia China and that's in Ezekiel and all the armies that are left on the Earth Russia and and Russia and uh China are the main ones because the Bible said the armies from the Far East and then the uh the north the King of the North Russia come down against Israel just so you know that's that's in Ezekiel I preached on that a couple months ago so it's I'm a little I'm not real familiar with the actual chapter but it's in Ezekiel now what I wanted to show you is verse 17 and I saw an angel stand in the Sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of Heaven Come and gather yourselves together unto the great supper of that great God that you may eat the Flesh of Kings and the Flesh of captains and the Flesh of Mighty Men and the Flesh of horses and the of them that sat on them and the Flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great okay so here is The Last Ride of the fourth horse riders so now go back to Revelation 6 remember so that that's we just read what Revelation 6:8 said and with the Beast of the earth okay that's the Beast of the earth that eat up all the unbelievers this these Wicked armies that come against Jesus and the bride and they also come against Israel all right now now before we flip it over I'm about ready to flip it over here but at the bottom did you notice I have three more columns under here because there's there's other ways there there's other ways to understand these four horse riders these four horse riders Are The Same Spirit it's the same person it's the spirit of death brother man calls it the Antichrist Spirit or you can call it Satan whatever you want to call it it's Satan it's it's the Antichrist Spirit notice he works in four stages but did you notice go to that look at that first one lust entice James 1:4 and 15 did you know the Bible said there's four stages to death just like there's four horse riders it's a four-step process for people to to go to hell first the first step is lust lust entic Your Lust gets enticed and you start thinking about that the second step is lust conceived now you're going to make a plan you got the plan to go do it the third step is you actually partake in the Sin and the last step the Bible says is death notice the fourth horse rider was death and the fourth step is death you see that it's a parallel in other words brother Irvin and all brother John we back battle these four horse riders in other words on a daily basis as we battle Satan we're battling this four-step process to death but we're going to overcome God's amen we will overcome praise God it's impossible for God's Church to lose hallelujah amen she's already predestinated to win hallelujah amen so in other words this four-step process during the church ages is the same process that we got to battle on a daily basis each one of us in our lives have to battle this four-step process you don't have to raise your hands but everybody in here was probably enticed by some lust today whether it was food whether it was sexual lust whether it was greed you lusted after the money or something right we all battle lust right lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life and it's a four-step process just like four horse riders so Satan uses four steps to destroy people in death spiritual death now look at the next one God God foretold this four these four horses in Joel chapter 1 God said he he saw Israel getting eaten up by four bugs but it's the same bug in four stages it's the caterpillar right but uh Joel one says it's starts as the Palmer worm then the Locust the canker worm and then the caterpillar Hallelujah so what what bug was eating up Israel in Joel chap one it was the Antichrist Spirit it was death but it works in four stages so just like just like that bug would mature and I I may have that order off though you have to forgive me I maybe I thought the last stage was the Locust stage so yeah maybe I got that wrong you have to forgive me on that one I think I got the order wrong but I hope you understand the process that locust bug goes through four stages just like Satan uses four stages to to kill people spiritually okay now the last one ought to make us all happy because brother R says this is how God's going to restore Israel in four steps he told us in Ezekiel 37 remember Ezekiel looked out and he saw a valley of dry bones how many remember that Valley Dry Bones did you notice how many steps does it take to restore that B that Valley four steps Hallelujah it was senu the senu had to come on the bones and then flesh came on the bones and then skin came on the bones and then breath or life the Breath of God which is the Holy Spirit came into them praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah that's how God that's how God restored the Church the lion the first anointing the ox the man and then the eagle and then God is finished with his church he's given them all four anointings and now the church is ready to go home praise God oh Hallelujah godes in four steps four anointings God gives to the church to become the true bride of Christ just like he takes four steps steps to make Israel an army again and the church said does that make sense there's four steps in there now I can flip it over now I didn't have room on the front I just went through the first four seals on the front so now you've heard the first four seals it's basically from 30 ad until the battle of Armageddon we're we're I Believe by God's grace we're living under the four seal right now now let me share this for John and irvan preachers might disagree with me and that's okay it's okay that we disagree on this the thing we got to agree on is get saved and baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and get the Holy Ghost that's what we got to agree on now I have quotes that show my perspective I think I'm right I'm sure they have quotes that they could say the same thing but I believe I have both Bible and quotes to show I'm right that's what that's why I wrote a book on it Hallelujah so that I left my phone number and email if you have any questions on this if you want to know brother Jesse where didd you get that quote why do you think that you can text me your email you can call me I'll make time by God's grace now on the back I put the Seven Seals but I didn't make them I made them all the same size because I I wasn't trying to show how the the first four seals go through church history but let's pick up to the fifth seal now now I wrote in that box in the fifth seal this happened shortly after the Rapture and I'll explain why in just a moment and what is this this is the souls under the altar that are the Saved but blinded Jews these were the Jews that were blinded think of it you're blinded your whole life they can't even see Jesus's Messiah because God blinded them that's in Romans 11:25 God had to Blind them because they rejected him so now he takes the Gentiles but they lived their whole life and they couldn't see Jesus as Messiah but because they kept the Old Testament commands God Saves them because they're blind wouldn't you have pity on a blind man let's say a blind man stepped on your foot and he's he's he blind would you get mad and say why didn't you look at why didn't you see my foot was right there you want to get mad you say oh poor fella right he couldn't see brother brother used that illustration in the fifth seal he say you want to get mad at a blind man so it is with Israel God's not going to get mad at him because he blinded them on purpose amen so he could save the Gentiles praise God now let's read the fifth seal Ro Revelation 6:9 this is one of my favorite seals course they're all beautiful but and when he opened the fif seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God now notice what are they slain for the word if you read chapter one of Revelation John had a testimony for the word of God and Jesus Christ so this group has no testimony of Jesus Christ the New Testament they only have a testimony of the Old Testament the word of God and brother teaches this you can listen to this and read this these have to be Jews because they don't have the testimony of Jesus Christ they just have testimony of the word of God and for the testimony which they held verse 10 and they CED with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth now two things two things to notice is there any horse in this in this in this seal do anybody see a horse no that means the rapture's already happened that means there no more horse riders there's not it's not the church and Satan battling anymore that's it's done this is after the Rapture there's no more horses and brother BR says that plainly you can hear him say it plainly now the second thing notice they're crying out for Revenge Church think real hard do Christians cry out for Revenge no good sister brother John had it right too what did Jesus cry on the cross he said God Revenge them he said father forgive them they don't know what they do remember when Stephen was Stone what did did Steph say did Stephen say God lay this to their charge that's what David said in the Old Testament right what did Stephen say he said Lord don't lay this to their charge praise Goden so see brother says these men these Souls cannot be Christians because Christians have the spirit of forgiveness brother isn't that beautiful hallelujah oh it makes it it this makes the Bible a brand new Bible praise God cuz we can understand it praise God if you haven't listened to the Seven Seals I would encourage you strongly listen to Seven Seals again remember brother said these are my most inspired sermons I ever preach in my life Hallelujah all right now verse 11 and white robes were given unto every one of them now notice they're getting white robes after they already died but the Bible says we already have white robes in other words we are we're already forgiven our Spirits are already forgiven have the righteousness of Christ during this life but they don't get white robes because they they they're blinded to Christ they don't get white robes until after they die now let's finish verse 11 and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled so brother says that means more Jews need to die and that's scriptural because remember the the Beast is going to kill everybody that doesn't take the mark in the right hand or their foreheads remember that so brother say this is true some Jews are going to have to die after the Rapture because they were refused to mark of the beast but remember there's going to be 144,000 they get they get to see Jesus praise God hallelujah all right now everybody got that I know I'm going fast but I got to get this done here tonight by God's grace and I know everybody's going to go to your homework right you're going to go listen to The Seven Seals you should try to if you can uh you can listen to them you know on your phone you can listen to him on the computer for free all right now The Sixth Seal let's go to verse 12 this is the longest one it's 1 2 3 4 five six verses and this is the judgments or the Wrath that Jesus is pouring out on Sinners during the Great Tribulation period now some people believe it's three and a half years some believe it's seven I believe it's seven and I've got quotes and scriptures to prove it I just made a video about it it's on YouTube now a lot of people disagree with me but uh I have quotes from brother Brandon brother BR has quotes on both sides so you got to see which one is right by the word of God so I believe it's the seven years because the the two prophets of Revelation 11 preached the first three and a half years and that gets the the Jews ready to meet Jesus during the second three and a half years that's what I believe now a lot of people disagree with me but that's what I believe but you know what on that it don't even matter what matters is that you go in the Rapture you have the Holy Ghost and you not here during the tribulation that's that's what really matters praise God Amen Hallelujah just be ready for Jesus's coming Hallelujah have your lamps trimmed and clear Hallelujah now this is the Sixth Seal now look at verse 12 and behold I'm sorry and I beheld when he had opened the Sixth Seal and lo there was a great earthquake now that might be the Los Angeles earthquake we don't know brother Ram said thus say the Lord Los Angeles is going to fall into the ocean sometime because of all the sins of Hollywood that might be I don't know it's Los Angeles or not I have a video on that too I don't know there's my hour so I'll try to finish up here uh maybe 15 minutes I'll try to finish up here okay and the sun became black as a sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell unto the Earth even as a fig tree castes her untimely figs when she's shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when is rolled together look at this and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places every island so Hawaii the Philippines Japan or any islands all the islands are going to be moved out of their places they're going to get a new place and then the Bible later says they're all going to sink all the islands are going to sink as a judgment of God this is the Judgment seal this is the during the Great Tribulation when God pours out his wrath on all the Sinners who did not repent all right verse 15 and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bond Man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand okay so the Sixth Seal is wrath Jesus pouring out his wrath on Sinners who took the mark of the beast that failed to repent they worshiped that Roman Catholic and denominational system thank God he called you out of it praise God Amen I was a part of it too I was a part of the Pentecostal church denomination I was part of a a presbyterian denomination but God called me out amen the Bible said come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and her plagues hallelujah thank God Amen we're called out of that cage of unclean and hateful Birds oh thank God Hallelujah we're free people tonight thank God Church you're not caged up you're free you can love God you can praise God you have the freedom of the word of God you have the freedom of the Holy Spirit praise God Amen thank God Hallelujah you're free in Christ you're not a slave to sin you're not a slave to denomination you're not a slave to a a mean Pastor right you're not a slave to you're not you're not you're not a slave to any denomination or any headquarters you are a love slave to Jesus Christ praise God out of love right didn't Paul say didn't Paul say I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ isn't that what the Bible says see so we are slaves out of love MH in other words we purposely say Jesus I'm dedicating my whole life to you I'm only going to do what you call me to do I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah yeah I know Paul was a literal prisoner in a prison cell but he was also a spiritual prisoner because that lines up with what Jesus said he said I do nothing except what the father shows me first and that's why the father loves me he said cuz I only do that which the father says so how many want to be prisoners for Christ I'm almost done Hallelujah you will be by God's grace just always obey the word of God Amen now the Seven Seals not in chapter 6 it's in chapter 8 so turn your if you got your Bible go to Revelation 8 verse one now this just you know this is the most mysterious seal and on these five important uh truths I put down at the bottom I put on number two look on number two the seven seal is often debated because brother brother had different Visions about it and we don't know all the meanings of it brother man himself said he didn't know some of the meanings but so because it's often debated focus on being born again rather than debating if you're born again you're sealed into the Rapture Ready For The Rapture so I don't I don't debate with Brothers I tell you I I made the videos I said Brothers these are my opinions you differ that's fine let's make sure we're born again amen because God will answer all of our questions when we get to heaven Hallelujah but we got to get we got to repent be baptized filled with the Holy Ghost live for Jesus praise God that's what we got to do live a holy Godly life now Revelation 8 verse1 I'm almost done and when he opened the heaven seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour now brother tells us why is there silence because if you read earlier those four beasts cease not but cry holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty the Bible said day and night can you imagine that while you're sleeping the Angels up there saying holy holy holy you and I are sleeping and they're saying holy holy holy they're flying around the throne holy holy holy holy holy holy we wake up try to wake ourselves up get some water get some coffee am I awake yet you all the angel are still saying holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy praise God the Bible said Jesus praise is unending praise God Amen so we ought to join we ought to join Heaven a couple times during the day right and say holy holy holy is Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's what we're doing tonight praise God hallelujah we are to join all heaven and give him praise Hallelujah but now when the seven seal is Broken Heaven goes quiet brother Braham tells us in a couple of places why it goes quiet because Jesus left heaven and he's coming down to get his bride so if if they're not going to cry they're not going to worship him if he's not there the Bible says at the Rapture Jesus comes comes to meet us in the air so he has to leave heaven and meet us in the air so the angels can finally get a break right that's so brother brother said where is that big fella he said he went down to meet the Saints in the air hallelujah amen so there's a little bit of overlap with the the fifth sixth and seventh seal now the seven seal begins at the rasher but it goes all the way to the New Jerusalem and that's because the seven seal is the final mystery in other words it goes through all it goes through the judgments the Millennium Armageddon goag and Magog white Throne judgment it goes through everything and then once Satan and all the all the evil people are are goats cast into fire then the seven seal ends and now we enter a new age we enter eternity where there's time no more so the seven seal tells us is the the end of all time it's the end of the the vials the end of the trumpets it's the end of all human history it's the end of any time so last from the Rapture the last mystery is from the Rapture all the way to the New Jerusalem but once the New Jerusalem comes down the Bible said there's no more sin the Bible said it wipe away all the tears from our eyes hallelujah amen there be no more time and the Bible says we'll be around Jesus we'll walk with him by by Still Waters we'll walk with him on streets of gold praise God amen he'll have Mansions he's the Bible say he's building mansions right now for us amen amen he's building mansions somehow maybe he's got Angels doing it for him I don't know how he's doing it but he sits on the throne and hears all our prayers too I don't know he must have sent angels to build the houses I don't know but the Bible said that City's full of houses and mansions he said I'm going to build you Mansions he said hallelujah amen thank godes but the seven seal is from the Rapture all the way till there's no more time it's the final mystery the final revelation and then after after all death is put away there's no more death the Bible say the last enemy destroyed is death oh there's that fourth horse fourth horse rider The Last Enemy is death and once death is cast in Lake of Fire there's no more time and brother said time Blends into eternity it Blends and there's no more time and we live in the city with with Christ forever so last last comments five important truths I'm with this you've been a great audience been a very patient audience I preach a lot here I I try to really condense this this is the really concentrated y'all like concentrated orange juice right right you got to all that all that Sweetness in that and then you got to put add water to it right that's what this sermon was it was a concentrated sermon now you got to go listen to the whole thing all the Seven Seals each seal has three forms I get this first the seal was a symbol that John saw on the aisle of Patmos when he had that vision each seal was a symbol then it had a reality form the dates were actually happened in human history and then it has a revelation symbol that brother random gave us the revelation of them that was in March of 1963 so each seal has three forms that's that will help you understand the the seals and the second one I already said the seven seal has a lot of debate but you don't have to worry about it just get the Holy Ghost does you got the ticket to go in the Rapture hallelujah it's supposed to be mysterious right it's supposed to be mysterious but let me say this about the seven seal brother R said the seventh seal is the day and hour of Jesus's return remember Matthew 24 Jesus said he said no man knows the day and the hour of my coming he said the Angels don't know he said the son himself doesn't even know the father is the only one who knows do you know that church not even Jesus knows when the Rapture is the father's going to make it known to him how many knew that the body of Jesus doesn't know when the Rapture is going to be the father the spirit inside of him has to reveal it to his his his human body this is the time of the Rapture that's scripture the father keeps that one all to himself not even the angels know when the Rapture is coming so in other words we're all going to be surprised even Jesus he's the first one that's going to know praise God we're all going to be surprised at the Rapture now the third truth the seven Church age Messenger to leoda is also the seventh angel Revelation 10:7 it's the same one cuz he's the seventh angel the seventh messenger okay I know these are deep teachings here now I want to end with I want to read all these but I want let's go to the fourth one the revelation of this open book is that it needs to be eaten all these truths need to be eaten or believed in order to Prevail against hell because Jesus said the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against Revelation amen so when you got the revelation of the Bible as brother R talked to us and you believe this Bible with all your heart you might not you can't maybe can't explain any of the seals I preach tonight but if you know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and you believe water baptism and you believe the godhead you believe all these things then then you have the Revelation it's in your heart and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against you amen that's what Jesus said Hallelujah now according to Revelation 10 the whole chapter in Revelation 10 an angel comes down he looks just like Jesus it is Jesus in the form of the Holy Spirit and he gives the open book to the seventh angel that's brother brandom and then we're supposed to eat it and go preach it to the whole world that's what's been happening since brother Bram died preachers have been going around the world there's major there's major revivals Brothers in Uganda and Japan right now that're they're hearing the message for the first time just like that's what's happened to you praise God hallelujah praise God Amen thank God that's what happened to me 20 some years ago 23 years ago praise God I heard the message for the first time it this this message has to go around the world and then Jesus can return that's why we need missionaries praise God that's why we need missionaries to Amish we do see the Rapture couldn't come until you guys received it you guys got to receive the the truth and then the Rapture can come anyone else anyone else God knows out there who wants to believe the truth really wants the truth of thus say the Lord God Jesus has to wait until they receive it and then he can come that's what the Bible says that's Matthew 24:14 I got it right there right there Matthew 24:14 Jesus said the end cannot come until the gospels been preached to Every Nation all right so in other words you got to eat the revelations that God you got to believe the revelations CU that's that's what it says John has to eat the book this open book no this book no longer has Seven Seals it's open now this Bible's open now now we can understand the Bible like brother Irvin always says it now I can understand the Book of Revelation he's exactly right that's what Jesus did he loosed the Seven Seals and he brought down the book for us to eat praise God hallelujah how many believe that by God's grace heyen we're here tonight eating the open book we're eating it we're we're believing it I know it's true thank God for Jesus Christ thank God for the Holy Spirit I'm believing this Revelation with all my heart amen now last but not least Church we're living under that fourth Beast anointing the Holy Ghost flying eagle anointing but notice the workers of iniquity are allowing that those four horse riders to ride through their lives swiftly advancing from false teachers that white horse to spiritually dead reprobates and I give you three verses that say people can be dead spiritually dead while they're alive Hallelujah there's three verses the Bible said the woman that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives amen right uh Jude says these reprobates are twice dead plucked up by the roots but they're they're on Earth they're they're living on Earth in physical bodies and the last one Revelation 3:1 said you have a name you live but you're dead that's what Jesus told the the church age Hallelujah so in closing brother brandom said when this when these Seven Seals were opened the Bible became a new Bible why because now we see the anointing that we live under now we see we've got a now we can understand the Book of Revelation that helps us understand the entire rest of the Bible we can understand water baptism uh godhead marriage and divorce serpent seed the seven Church ages the seven SE we can understand the entire Bible now and not be deceived by Satan and we just got to keep eating it and as we eat the word of God then the Bible says that we become like God will grow in Revelation and the Bible says we'll finish the Great Commission by preaching it to Every Nation let's stand by God's grace amen Hall let's give God a round of applause can we thank you [Applause] Jesus now that was a a lot packed in there that was an hour and 15 minutes I thank you for extra 15 minutes there by God's grace now you got spiritual homework I'll try to be back in two weeks I think by God's grace if you still want me to come you don't have to have me come I just I'm just offer myself if you want to hear the word of God I'll try my best to preach it but I want you to know that if you stay in the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals you will be firmly established you will stand on like on this concrete you'll have a firm foundation in this message you study those seals you study those Church ages you will have an excellent understanding of the word of God the Holy Ghost will reveal all these things to you and that will help you overcome the Gates of Hell Hallelujah and you'll be more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus Hallelujah now before we close are there any questions about any of that and I'll point you we'll go right to the scriptures anybody have I'm sure there's questions but is there any like burning question you'd like me to answer while I'm here remember all questions are good questions uh like I like I told you our church we always do questions and answers on Sunday night I take I take questions all the time I I don't always have the answers but I'll try to point you to the the scriptures that I'm talking about take a moment if you want to look at that sheet again I had something that I but I forgot what it was okay no problem brother no problem I appreciate like three days down the yeah we would all think of it I'm the same way brother yeah that that's why brother just so you know I carry uh I don't have with me but I carry a pencil with me and during a sermon I write down all these notes because I I've learned over the years I forget them if I don't write them down by God's grace I'm quick to forget little bit on yes yes um you have armd armd thinks then when you covered that so didn't catch that yes sir about what what is the battle of Armageddon excellent question what is the battle of Armageddon so after the Rapture there's I believe there's seven years left for the Jews to be saved that goes back to Daniel 70 weeks and Daniel chapter 9 so the Rapture goes jesus takes all the Gentile Holy Ghost filled Believers to heaven the first three and a half years is the two prophets probably Moses and Elijah preaching to the Jews they die those two prophets are resurrected now then Jesus reveals himself to the 144,000 and I think I'm not sure but Jesus might Rapture them I don't know that's a good question anyways after the 144,000 are saved God pours out the trumpets are blown trumpets of Wrath and then the seven vows are poured out so at the very end of the Seven Years brother that's the battle of Armageddon when all these Armies come to against Jesus in Israel they come against Jesus in Israel and that's where he comes out of heaven with his army of us the Saints and out of his sword goes a mouth I'm sorry out of his mouth goes a sword and it destroys all them and then all the birds come in and eat their dead bodies after that after the battle arm again then God Burns over the whole Earth with fire and then we walk out on the ashes of the wicked so all these people that died all these Sinners their ashes are laying there and we walk out into a brand new world and new vegetation starts coming up for a thousand years we'll build houses oh so the Millennium is going to be yes the Millum here on the earth yes sir great so Armageddon is the last battle before the Millennium [Music] thousand great so the the ones that the armies that will get conquered on Earth is what you refer to as armies of Russia Russia and China that's at least those are one the two ones we know from the Bible yes us is going to be off the map probably yeah probably because brother saw the vision yeah the United States will probably be off the map by that time or destroyed or conquered we don't know we don't know for sure but it's probably it's likely going to happen yeah great question there let's give him a round of applause a good question bu I want to encourage questions because there's no bad question right if you're an honest sincere person you it's a good thing to ask questions and so that's Revelation 19 if you want to read about the battle of Armageddon I read a little bit on that but that's the last battle where Jesus come he defends Israel and all the armies of men are destroyed before a thousand years of Peace the Bible said there'll be no sin during that Thousand Years CU Satan's bound up he's thrown in the bottomless pit for a thousand years he falls for a thousand years he just falls falls falls for a thousand years and there's no and then we brother we rule with ODS of iron we're going to rule with our wives and our children uh and our children are going to lead around snakes poisonous snakes our children going to lead them out but they're not going to have poison them Bible said the wolf will lay lay down right by the lamb now imagine that Wolf's going to cuddle up and they're going to cut up together the wolf and the lamb time of total peace no sin on the earth and is that at the end of the the Millennium that Satan's going to be released season for he's for a short season and then he goes around the entire Earth the Bible said the four corners of the earth that's just north south east east and west west and he deceives all the people that are not us because God's going to allow people to multiply for Thousand Years families multiply but we're going to have glorified bodies they're going to have physical bodies like we have now but we're going to have perfect bodies we're going to be ruling the Earth the Bible says so Satan's going to deceive everybody who doesn't have uh the white robe and and and the rods of iron and then he get gathers all of them against Israel we're going to be there in Israel with Jesus at the headquarters and then right right about the time they're ready to attack God sends fire down from heaven a wall of fire that burns up Satan and all of his and then Satan at that moment is tossed in Lake of Fire and then after that we go to the right Throne judgment and that's where anyone that ever lived anyone that ever died they're now raised up and brought to the judgment and we sit with Christ on the judgment and we will judge the Sinners we'll judge demons at that time too W the Bible said we'll judge demons Jesus said I'm going to raise up the queen of the South to judge the Pharisees of my day because they wouldn't come hear me preach because the queen of the South traveled across the desert to hear Solomon preach and he said a greater than Solomon is here right now so she went to see she went to see Solomon a lesser preacher way lesser than Jesus right because Jesus was perfect so she's going to condemn these people who had a greater preacher than salmon and wouldn't even go Ross the city to hear him preach w a woman is going to condemn all those Pharisees a Godly woman so sisters you might have to you might have to condemn ungodly man we don't know God but God's going to use your testimony it's going to condemn siners who and after that Jesus separates we're we're with him on the throne but then Jesus separates all these that weren't born again he separates them as sheep and goats the Sheep are taken into heaven or the Sheep are taken with him and the goats are all cast in Lake of Fire they're burned and then the the the future home comes down from heaven and then we go take our Mansions we go live in our Mansions after that who knows what's going to happen we got all eternity we might move to different planets I don't know who knows but we got all eternity after that all I know is I want to see Jesus praise God Amen where do the souls go like today if people die true Christians where where are those Souls great question they uh I brother man says there in the sixth Dimension which he says is is uh uh he says the sixth Dimension is right below the Throne of Jesus so in Revelation 4 and 5 we see Jesus on his throne right so brother Ram says we're right under their waiting okay now there must be another dimension lower because we the fisal says there Souls under the altar the Jews that are crying how long Okay so that's what brother random says but we know brother we know for sure we go to heaven because Paul says I go to heaven when my when when this Earth Earthly body is dissolved I go to my eternal ET home in the heavens there it is hallelujah great question brother let's give him round B good question I'm I'm questions a great questions praise God oh we're looking forward to that day aren't we to see Jesus Hallelujah do we have that song Oh I want to see him look upon his face do you sing that oh I want to see him look upon do you know that song okay some people know it do all right let's sing it
