[0:02] Dear Lord [music] Jesus, today on the
[0:04] 60th anniversary of you taking your
[0:07] servant home, we want to thank you, Lord
[0:10] Jesus, [music] for sending your prophet,
[0:12] Brother William Brham, as the prophets
[0:14] foretold he would be sent.
[0:17] Thank you that Daniel [music] said your
[0:19] book would be sealed up even to the time
[0:21] of the end when you [music] would break
[0:24] your seven seals and reveal them to your
[0:27] servant, Brother Brandham, fulfilling
[0:29] Revelation 10 [music] 1-7.
[0:32] Thank you, Lord, that Joel said you'd
[0:33] restore your church with a former and
[0:35] latter [music] reign and that brother
[0:37] Brandham's ministry was the former reign
[0:39] or the teaching reign as you promised.
[0:43] Thank [music] you, Lord, that you told
[0:44] Malachi you'd turn our hearts back to
[0:47] the fathers by the spirit of Elijah. And
[0:50] brother Aram [music] had the spirit of
[0:51] Elijah and our hearts are now turned
[0:53] back to the apostolic fathers.
[0:57] And Lord, you included [music] you
[0:59] yourself in your son of man ministry, in
[1:01] your earthly prophetic ministry, and you
[1:04] foretold [music] Elias would come and
[1:06] restore all things.
[1:09] Thank you, Lord, that we can recognize
[1:11] brother Brandham as a true Bible-based
[1:13] [music] prophet, as you describe
[1:15] prophets in Numbers 12. If there be a
[1:18] prophet among you, I, the Lord, will
[1:20] make myself [music] known unto him in a
[1:21] vision, and will speak unto him in a
[1:24] dream.
[1:25] Thank you, Lord, that you made yourself
[1:27] known to brother Brandham in his [music]
[1:29] visions. He saw the seven major visions
[1:32] of 1933.
[1:34] He saw the [music] vision of the preview
[1:36] of the bride. He saw a vision of
[1:38] Congressman Upshaw's healing. He saw
[1:42] thousands of visions nightly [music] in
[1:44] the discernment prayer lines and he saw
[1:47] a vision of a little lamb in Miltown and
[1:50] prayed for that [music] lamb and the
[1:52] lamb was healed.
[1:54] Lord, thank you for giving Brother
[1:56] Brandham dreams as he dreamed in 1962 to
[1:59] [music] stay home and store up food the
[2:01] sermons we listen to today and preach
[2:04] [music] behind pulpits.
[2:07] Thank you for giving him the dream of
[2:10] hope and ma [music] with him when the
[2:12] crowns were being given out in the fifth
[2:14] seal sermon.
[2:18] Thank you [music] Lord that brother
[2:19] Brandham foretold events in your name
[2:22] that came to pass fulfilling James 5:10
[2:25] and Deuteronomy 18:es [music] 19- 22.
[2:31] Thank you that in [music] 1958 he told a
[2:34] mother she'd have a baby with thus
[2:36] sayeth the Lord and it came to pass
[2:37] [music] 10 years later
[2:40] &gt;&gt; and you're suffering with a female
[2:41] trouble and you've got a desire in your
[2:43] heart to have a baby and you can't have
[2:45] the baby and you come from Denver,
[2:47] Colorado. Thus sayeth the Lord.
[2:50] That's right. Go home and receive your
[2:52] child. God will give it to you.
[2:57] Thank you that in 1961 [music]
[2:59] he said thus sayith the Lord there'll
[3:01] never be a greater gift to the Gentiles
[3:03] and there hasn't been
[3:06] &gt;&gt; is right here among you. You'll just
[3:09] remember thus saith the Lord you will
[3:13] never in any oh more gentile church age
[3:17] ever see any sign to succeed this go
[3:22] greater. This is the last sign to the
[3:24] church.
[3:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, that he foretold the
[3:29] continued debauchery of women immorally
[3:32] [music] dressing in 1962
[3:35] and we see it fulfilled.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; 30 years ago,
[3:40] I've got thus sayeth the Lord.
[3:44] 30 years ago when I entered the
[3:45] ministry, he told me that the strain of
[3:48] women would come so immoral and imputed
[3:50] in the last days. It' be the most
[3:51] defiled thing on the earth,
[3:54] RIGHT? SHE STARTED AT THE BEGINNING AND
[3:56] SATAN used her at the end. And look what
[3:58] is happening. Look down through the
[3:59] years. Said she'll continue to strip
[4:01] herself AND SAID THERE'LL JUST BE A
[4:04] LITTLE TINY GROUP OF THE very elected
[4:06] that's predestinated will escape that.
[4:10] Also, thank you [music] for telling him
[4:11] that his new commission would be
[4:13] vindicated by a snow white pyramid in
[4:15] 1962, which came to pass months later in
[4:19] 1963. [music]
[4:21] I could see those angels, those
[4:24] shapedback wings
[4:27] TRAVELING FASTER THAN SOUND could
[4:29] travel. They come from eternity in a
[4:32] SPLIT LIKE A TWINKLING OF AN EYE. NOT
[4:35] ENOUGH TO BAT your eye, just a twinkle.
[4:37] They were there. I didn't have time to
[4:40] count. I DIDN'T HAVE TIME THAN JUST LOOK
[4:43] MIGHTY ONES, GREAT POWERFUL ANGELS, SNOW
[4:47] WHITE,
[4:48] WINGS SETTING HEADS, AND THEY WERE.
[4:53] And when it did, I WAS CAUGHT UP into
[4:56] this pyramid of constellations.
[5:00] And then it come to me, not a voice,
[5:02] just come to me. Oh,
[5:05] that is the angels of the Lord coming to
[5:10] give me my new commission.
[5:12] I'M STANDING IN AN AWFUL PLACE IF YOU
[5:14] BUT KNEW IT.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER, I TELL YOU, IN THE NAME OF THE
[5:19] LORD, I've told you the truth.
[5:24] And something's fixing to happen.
[5:28] Thank [music] you that he spoke with
[5:30] thus sayeth the Lord that the United
[5:32] States church would continue to [music]
[5:34] fall away and be known for their rock
[5:37] and roll and immoral behavior so that we
[5:40] would not be a part of that immoral
[5:42] church
[5:44] &gt;&gt; vision. Notice just closing. I want to
[5:47] say this one thing just before closing.
[5:50] That's what led me to say this.
[5:53] It's thus saith the Lord.
[5:57] Some of the dirtiest looking things I
[5:59] ever seen in my life. And when the
[6:01] American church come up, it was the
[6:05] awsten.
[6:07] The heavenly father is my judge. They
[6:10] had on these tattletail gray skirts like
[6:14] one of these barroom girls with no back
[6:17] on it up here holding up like a gray
[6:19] looking piece of paper and like a hoola
[6:21] dancing paint short bobbed hair smoking
[6:25] cigarettes and twisting as they walk to
[6:28] rock and roll. And I said, "Is that the
[6:31] church of the United States?" And the
[6:33] voice said, "Yes, it is." And when they
[6:37] &gt;&gt; and thank you Lord that [music] he
[6:38] correctly prophesied the going home of a
[6:42] sister just as Elijah [music] did in the
[6:44] Old Testament
[6:46] &gt;&gt; that I had to come to that family with
[6:48] thus sayeth the Lord their daughter is
[6:50] going to die too
[6:53] Florence.
[6:56] I saw her in a vision, saw her go, and I
[7:00] know she's going. And I said, "Pray.
[7:03] Just pray." You know, there's a prophet
[7:05] one time was told to go tell a king to
[7:07] put his house in order. And he prayed
[7:09] and he spared his life 15 years longer.
[7:11] I said, "Pray." anybody.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; And finally, Lord, [music] thank you
[7:15] that he spoke with thus sayith the Lord
[7:17] the prophecy that no denomination would
[7:19] ever break up and come back to the word,
[7:22] proving to us he [music] was a prophet
[7:23] of God and we were to stay out of
[7:25] denominationalism.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; It's predicted that they're going to do
[7:29] it and they're going to do it for THUS
[7:32] SAYETH THE LORD THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT.
[7:34] You think them nominations will ever
[7:37] break up their denomination, come back
[7:38] to the word? It's thus sayeth the Lord
[7:40] they won't. Will they go into the
[7:43] Antichrist? Exactly as thus sayeth the
[7:46] Lord they will.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; We just want to say [music] thank you
[7:49] Lord for everything you did in Brother
[7:50] Ram's ministry. Thank you Lord for
[7:53] giving [music] us the finished mysteries
[7:54] as Revelation 10 1-7 promised. Also
[7:58] [music] confirmed by Amos 3:7.
[8:02] You've given us [music] the secret
[8:04] things of God.
[8:07] Thank you that brother Ram's prophetic
[8:08] [music] ministry has given us courage as
[8:10] 2 Chronicles 15:8 says. And when Asa
[8:14] heard [music] these words in the
[8:15] prophecy of Oed the prophet, he took
[8:18] courage and put away the abominable
[8:20] idols. Brother Brham has given us
[8:22] courage [music] to put away our sins.
[8:25] Thank you that brother Bram's ministry
[8:27] was your compassion toward us according
[8:28] to [music] 2 Chronicles 36:15-16.
[8:33] and the Lord God of their father sent to
[8:34] them [music] by his messengers because
[8:36] he had compassion on his people.
[8:41] Thank you that brother Ram's prophetic
[8:42] ministry [music] has given us spiritual
[8:44] prosperity as 2 Chronicles 20:20 and
[8:48] Ezra 6:14 declare, "Believe in the Lord
[8:51] your God, so shall you [music] be
[8:52] established. Believe as prophets, so
[8:55] shall you prosper."
[8:57] And the elders of the Jews build it and
[8:58] they prospered [music] through the
[8:59] prophesying of Hagi the prophet and
[9:01] Zechariah the son of Ido.
[9:05] This [music] is amazing grace.
[9:08] Thank you for giving us men that will
[9:10] still [music] preach the Bible message.
[9:12] As brother Brandham told us he was
[9:13] getting old. If time would roll on, he
[9:17] was going to walk off the scene and
[9:19] said, [music] "You've got to fill our
[9:21] shoes.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; You're a young man. I'm getting old.
[9:24] Brother Neville's getting old. We're a
[9:26] middle-aged man. If time rolls on, we're
[9:29] going to walk off the scene next to a
[9:30] while. You've got to fill our shoes.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; And so, you see, and then maybe in that
[9:37] day even it'll be growing greater if
[9:39] there is a tomorrow.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you. That brother [music] Graham
[9:44] said, "These men if they pick up this
[9:45] and goes out with it, they can make more
[9:47] sense [music] to it." See, then hope
[9:50] they make it come to life.
[9:52] these men if they pick up this and go
[9:54] out with it, they can make more sense to
[9:56] it. See to bring it to a place you I
[9:58] just want to lay this seed. Hope they
[10:01] make it come to life.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; And thank you that brother Ram said
[10:05] these young men [music] can take this
[10:06] message and sweep it on to the coming of
[10:08] the Lord if he doesn't come in my
[10:10] generation.
[10:12] as I'm beginning get old and know that
[10:14] my days are numbered [music] and know
[10:16] now that these young men can take this
[10:18] message and sweep it on to the coming of
[10:21] the Lord if he doesn't come in and my
[10:23] generation which [music] I'm hoping to
[10:26] see him. I look daily for him and watch
[10:28] keeping myself prepared for that hour.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, we thank [music] you Lord for
[10:34] sending Elijah as you promised. Thank
[10:36] you that he didn't sit at home but
[10:38] gathered more physically with his
[10:40] brothers [music] and sisters in a church
[10:41] building as he saw that day approaching.
[10:45] How we got to come here together and sit
[10:47] together in heavenly places. Don't stay
[10:50] home.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; If God is in your heart, you can't
[10:53] hardly wait for them doors to open out
[10:56] to get in here to fellowship with your
[10:57] brothers. If you don't don't feel that
[11:00] way, then I tell you, it's time you got
[11:02] to praying cuz we're in the last days
[11:05] where the Bible exalted exorted us to to
[11:08] much more as we see that day approaching
[11:10] to love one another with Christian love
[11:12] and divine love to assemble ourselves
[11:15] together in heavenly places and and and
[11:18] Christ Jesus and love one another. This
[11:21] will all men know you're my disciples
[11:22] when you have love one for the other.
[11:25] That's right. Stay right together.
[11:28] Thank you, Lord, [music] that he
[11:29] encouraged the five-fold ministry and
[11:32] never told them to bury their preaching
[11:33] gifts in the ground and told them to
[11:35] keep preaching. And he was right behind
[11:37] them.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Would we still be on fire and preach the
[11:42] gospel? Or is the time over? No, keep
[11:45] preaching. This is hard as you can
[11:46] preach, brother. Stay with it. I'm right
[11:47] behind you.
[11:50] Thank you that brother Ram did not claim
[11:51] his every word was infallible, but was
[11:54] humble and admitted he had mixups
[11:57] [music] and human mistakes on his tapes.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Like the other day, I got something
[12:01] mixed up. I happened to hear it. It's I
[12:03] caught it right there and it's on the
[12:04] tape and I I probably hear from it.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; I just happened to say 700. I didn't
[12:08] mean just 700. I meant you I just didn't
[12:12] read it out of the scripture. It just
[12:13] come to my mind while I was talking and
[12:15] I just said 700 instead of 7,000. I make
[12:18] them mistakes all the time. I'm I'm a
[12:20] sure a dummy. So you forgive me. See, I
[12:23] didn't mean to do that.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you that he did not make [music]
[12:28] himself an idol as so many erroneously
[12:31] make him an idol today.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; If I make mistakes, you pray for me. I'm
[12:36] not infallible. I'm your brother.
[12:40] Thank you that he told us to listen
[12:42] carefully [music] to him to know when
[12:44] his human side was speaking versus when
[12:46] God was speaking through him because God
[12:49] [music] would say, "Thus sayaith the
[12:51] Lord."
[12:54] Did you prophesy that there be a million
[12:57] negroes uh killed
[13:00] on the or did you just announce that
[13:04] there [music] would be this happening?
[13:07] Now
[13:08] see, I've always asked you to be careful
[13:12] what you're listening to. [music]
[13:14] There's so much of it that it's just the
[13:17] human side. But always if there is
[13:20] something that goes forth, it will speak
[13:23] it. It's thus saith the Lord even to
[13:26] visions or anything.
[13:29] And that's the reason I say that not
[13:31] that there is any uh any prophecy
[13:34] concerning it. I have nothing on it from
[13:36] the Lord. [music] And be sure now if I
[13:38] say anything from the Lord like that to
[13:40] tell you it's always I'm speaking now.
[13:44] But when he speaks, I say it's not me.
[13:45] It's thus sayaeth the Lord. And I can't
[13:48] say it until he tells me. I could be
[13:50] alltogether wrong in my thought about
[13:52] Martin Luther King. I don't know. I
[13:54] can't say it. That's just my opinion.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; So today again, we thank you [music] for
[14:00] sending your prophet, brother William
[14:02] Brandham. and we will remember that he
[14:04] spoke in your holy name.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; But it's moving into that cycle.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; See, it's coming up close.
[14:13] So the thing for you to do is to
[14:16] remember that I speak to you in the name
[14:18] of the Lord.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Be prepared or you don't know what time
[14:26] something can happen.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; There's the second seal. You love me.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; That's thus sayaeth the Lord. Praise
[14:52] be God.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; IF ALL THESE OTHER REVELATIONS and
[14:57] visions and everything has hit just
[14:59] exactly on the on the point. And how
[15:01] many knows that? Raise your hand.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; Everybody here with your hands up.
[15:05] That's right. So shall this be. Amen.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Remember
[15:11] &gt;&gt; it's so wonderful.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Oh friend,
[15:17] &gt;&gt; come to the fountain that's filled with
[15:20] blood
[15:22] &gt;&gt; drawn from Emanuel's veins where sinners
[15:25] plunge beneath the blood lose all their
[15:27] guilty stains.
