TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Oh, I disagreed with the man in his politics and in his religion, but yet he doesn't deserve to die like that. No, &gt;&gt; a mass is hoping it so. A communion is knowing it's so and thanking for it. See, and that is the only thing that they cannot get together. They'll do it. &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to give my reaction to the assassination of Charlie Kirk. I was asked about this in an email and so I thought I'd make a video on it by the grace of God. My initial reaction was great sadness, grieving for Charlie's wife and two children, his friends, family, employees. And then one of my first thoughts was Charlie didn't deserve this because I'd heard brother Brandham say that about the assassination of JFK. So, by God's grace, let's look at the assassination of JFK and what God's prophet, Brother Brandham, said about it. And you'll see how Brother Brandham was extremely gracious to JFK and his wife Jacqueline. And we can learn that this is the type of reaction we should have as Holy Ghost fililled Christians when tragedy strikes. We should grieve. We should mourn. We should be sad. But also remember that God allowed this. And the Bible says, "Blessed are they who mourn for they shall be comforted." So, we'll start with these quotes from God's prophet, Brother Brandham, on JFK, and then I'll give some reactions to Charlie Kirk's assassination as well. So, by God's grace, Brother Random reacted to the assassination of JFK on November 24th, 1963 when he preached, "What shall I do with Jesus called Christ?" And brother Random said, quote, "When I heard of the murder of President Kennedy, this message fell on my heart. I thought, what will that man do? no way out of it now. He might have woken up by this time and realized what lays ahead. End quote. So, it is very touching to see how God's prophet was sensitive to the Holy Spirit to feel what God put on his heart. And he preached a sermon in reaction to the assassination of President Kennedy. Now, that quote was taken towards the end of the service in paragraph 157. So, we'll go back to the beginning of the sermon. Right after he greets the people in the second paragraph all the way through the 14th paragraph, Brother Ram talks about this before he takes his text and preaches the sermon. So, we'll take it a couple paragraphs at a time here, Lord willing. In paragraph number two, Brother Ram said, "I'm sure we're all aware of the great sadness that's happened, the loss of our president, though I disagreed with the man in his politics and his religion, but yet he doesn't deserve to die like that." And that's the one of the first thoughts that came to my mind as I was driving home on September 10th, 2025. I thought this man didn't deserve to die like this. He said, "And leave those little children behind and no daddy and a mother." Mrs. Kennedy, though I certainly wouldn't agree with her and her ways and things, but maybe. Remember, she's a mother. She's just lost her babies and she lost her husband and he fell right into her lap. So, brother Bram's first reaction is great sadness and he feels for the loss of the family. Despite his differences in politics and religion, brother Bram felt a great sadness for the Kennedy family. In paragraph number three, Brother Ram talked about Mrs. Kennedy. He said, "But did you know Mrs. Kennedy never did hear one of these messages I preach about that if she might hear one of them, she might do different?" So, Brother Brandham has compassion upon Mrs. Kennedy. her fashions led the nation. But yet, brother Brandham thought, "What if she would just hear one of these message? Maybe it would change your heart." That's the hope of the believer. The hope that sinners or those who don't know the full gospel of Jesus Christ could hear the full gospel of Jesus Christ to know that modesty is commanded in the New Testament in 1 Timothy chapter 2. And of course, makeup is condemned all throughout the Old Testament. But it's the loving hope in a believer's heart. As the scripture says, God is not willing that any should perish. 2 Peter 3:9, "Not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance." So, we see Brother Ram has the same heart as God because the Holy Ghost, God's spirit was in brother Ram's heart. He desired to see Mrs. Kennedy change her ways. Brother Ram said, "Mrs. Kennedy was raised Catholic. That's all she knows. That's a system. Nothing against the people, but it's the Catholic system like any other system, Presbyterian, Methodist, Pentecostal. It's the system, not the people." Then he goes back to President Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy, I think done a good job of being president. My heart goes out for his wife. I feel real sad about it that even our nation, the hoodlams, would do a thing like that. So here we can see brother Random could recognize Kennedy as a president who did some good. Just like today, we can see how President Trump does some good, but we're not saying he's saved. It seems like from his own words, he's not even certain that he's saved. So, he's likely not saved, but let's hope for the best. Let's hope that he can repent of his sins. Just like Brother Ram hoped Mrs. Kennedy would repent of her sins and live a better godly life. In paragraph 5, Brother Random said there's no reason to kill another man if you disagree with the person because now those children have no daddy. Daddy's gone. Then, Brother Ram says he can relate to this to some degree. He said, "I've always thought that would be my state someday." So, Brother Ram thought he would be assassinated. He also talked about that in Souls in Prison 1963. A sister had a dream and the Holy Spirit said, "Brother Brandon would be fired upon getting out of a vehicle." And Brother Brham said, "Uh-huh." So, Brother Bram thought that would happen. Brother Ram said, "It's almost happened several times, as you know, of being shot in foreign nations when they've had to hold their bodies over me. Keep me from being shot at a distance." In paragraph 6, brother Ram talked about the glory that goes along with being a president and the average between presidents and those that have been assassinated. Brother Ram said, "It's a shame that a person in America would do such a thing as that." In paragraph 7, I disagree with his politics, but you see, he's another man. I didn't agree with his system of religion, but he was raised that way. He said maybe if he'd heard something different, it might have been different. So I love how brother Brandham desired for President Kennedy to hear the message of the hour, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the truth of God's word to bring him out of that Catholic system, the mother harlot system. In paragraph 8, brother Random said, "We have a thing we do here whenever our people dies." And he's going to get to praying for the Kennedy family. So he made that a tradition in his church. They would pray for the families that had loved ones pass away. Then brother Ram says also in paragraph 8 he said I didn't vote for Kennedy I voted for Mr. Nixon. So some people say brother Ram never voted. Well he says right here I voted for Mr. Nixon because he knew him personally. There's a picture of that brother Ram sitting at a breakfast and I think it was Vice President Nixon at the time was talking but there's a picture of Brother Random with Vice President Nixon if I'm not mistaken. Brother Ram said he voted for him because he liked him. Speaking of Nixon then he talked about though how Kennedy was elected and the way they did it. Well, that's up between them and God, but that's not much. So, Brother Ram was even questioning the election integrity of when Kennedy was elected. But he said, even if there was election issues, that's between them and God. In paragraph 9, Brother Brandham says, for the sake of the mother, couldn't we just stand a moment in prayer for her? And then in paragraph 10, he prays to the Lord Jesus. We have a feeling for one another. We're sorry that the president was shot down. We're sorry that our nation has come to this spot. Then in verse 11, we pray for Mrs. Kennedy, that wife of his. Then he says in paragraph 12, though we might disagree with the woman being in the wrong as far as her fashions, he says, may there be a time in this deep bereiement, that shall find what is truth, Jesus Christ. Grant, Lord, the one who only can give peace and comfort in the hour of trouble. So brother B prays for peace and comfort from the Lord Jesus for Mrs. Kennedy. And then brother Brandham finishes the prayer in paragraph 13. Now he prays for the congregation. Help us Lord with all of our hearts to be a shining light. We don't know what time or what influence we might have upon somebody else. Let us shine forth the light of Christ until he comes. Then the great shepherd who knows all justice will bring every sin into recompense. So when someone's assassinated, we just have to trust in God that justice will be done and God will know just how to do it. Until then, we commit ourselves into your hands for your love and mercy upon us in Jesus' name. Amen. And then before he takes his text, he has one more paragraph in paragraph 14. Yes, I don't think no man deserves to die like that. Lincoln didn't deserve that. Mr. McKinley didn't deserve that. None of them fellows murderers. That's bad. Our boys didn't fight overseas for something like that. He says that's sin. And then a few times in the sermon, he again mentions uh President Kennedy. I don't have this paragraph number, but he says, "The president, not the man. As far as I know, he's a good man. He's never done anything evil as I know of." So again, brother's very gracious towards President Kennedy. Now, it's come out in all these years since Kennedy's death that Kennedy seemed to have a lot of adulteries, which is extremely wicked and sad. We hope he repented of them before he was assassinated, but we don't know. So, we can just commit it into the hands of God. But look how gracious brother Ram was to President Kennedy not knowing what he was doing behind the scenes perhaps. Then in paragraph 153, Brother Ram talks about the blood of President Kennedy being on Oswald's hands. And then of course, Brother Ram brings that down to us. What are we going to do with the blood of Jesus Christ on our hands? And brother Ram says, "The only thing you can do is put it on your heart. Repent of your sins. Tell Jesus you're sorry for all your sins. And if you do that, if you confess Jesus Christ with your mouth, repent of your sins, he will pardon all your transgressions, he's faithful and just to forgive us of all unrighteousness. Jesus Christ died with our sins upon him. He became sin that we might become his righteousness. And then if we receive the grace of God, shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid. The grace of God will lead us into sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So now my reaction to Charlie Kirk's passing. I feel a lot of the same feelings that Brother Ram felt. I cried numerous times just on my knees at night in prayer praying for Charlie Kirk's family. I watched a little bit of Charlie Kirk and I was always blessed by his wisdom, his ability to debate. I appreciated his conservative political values of pro-life, closed borders, and I liked how he presented the gospel in many of his debates on college campuses. I admire him because he went inside the college campuses and changed many hearts. Charlie did not claim to be a preacher, but he did what Jesus told his disciples in Matthew 10. I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves. Luke 10:3, "Go your ways. Behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves." Charlie always used kindness with those that opposed him, even when they called him names or mocked him, as far as what I've seen. So I greatly respect that type of courage to go right into we'd say the lion's den and try to convert the unconverted. It seems like he had some success. So we rejoice in that by the grace of God trusting some people were saved. I know even when I was on the University of Akran campus from 1999 to 2004. I always greatly respected the preachers who stood up there and preached on campus trying to convict hearts. I admired their courage. I admired their faith. As far as I knew, their hearts were sincere. Only God knows the hearts of all men, but that takes a certain type of gift, a certain type of courage, a holy boldness. So, I certainly admired that and appreciated that about Charlie Kirk. Now, we know the Bible revelation that God gave to William Brandham. He showed us there's two types of believers that are saved. There's two types that are lost. This is in the church age book. It's an undeniable biblical truth. I have a figure on this in my 2021 book. Two kinds of believers, two kinds of lost groups. In Matthew 25 1-13, Jesus calls them wise virgins, foolish virgins. They're both virgins, so they're both saved. But one will make the rapture and one won't because one lacked the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the oil, the full word of God, the full revelation of the Bible. And Matthew 13:18-23 shows the four kinds of hearts. good, thorny, stony wayside. The good would be the wise virgins. The thorny would be the foolish virgins. Stony would be like the Judas, a scary group that leave the truth. Wayside are those who never believed in Christ to begin with. We see this in a foreshadow in the Old Testament. Abraham, wise virgin, Lot, foolish virgin. Mrs. Lot, the stony ground. Sodommites were like the wayside. But the ram said there wasn't three crosses, there was four crosses or four deaths when Jesus was crucified. Jesus represents the wise virgin, the saved thief, the foolish. Judas was the stony ground. And then the wayside was like the lost thief who never believed in Christ. 2 Timothy 2:20 shows the four types of vessels. Gold would be the wise virgin. Silver the foolish virgin. Wood would be the stony ground. Judas the scar group. And earth would be the wayside. And Revelation 22:11 shows the four classes as well. Holy would be the Holy Ghost fil or the wise virgin. Righteous would be the foolish virgin. Filthy, the Judas or Mrs. Lot group. And the unjust would be the wayside or the lost group. Remember friends, Job 1 22 says, "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." Brother Ram used Romans 8:28. Whenever unexpected deaths happen, tragedies happen. We know all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. The Bible says our days are numbered. So Charlie Kirk's days were numbered just like JFK's days were numbered. Brother Ram's days were numbered this week. Vodie Bacham also passed away, which I disagree with him on a lot of his doctrine, but I appreciate his love for Jesus Christ. He died at 56, just like brother Ram passed away at 56. But God has each one of our days numbered according to Job 14:5. Seeing his days are determined. The number of his months are with thee. Thou hast appointed the bounds that he cannot pass. Friends, my days are numbered. Your days are numbered. All of our days are numbered by Almighty God. So let's redeem the time because the days are evil. None of us know when the Lord will call us home. So we want to be ready. We want to be daily worshiping the Lord, growing in the grace and knowledge of the Lord, confessing our sins, rejoicing in the Lord Jesus. As the Bible said, let us continually say, "The Lord be magnified." Psalm 139:16, "Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect, and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuence were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them." So God wrote down the details of our lives, including the number of our days. Well, before we were born, before the foundation of the world, our names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life or the Book of Life. Now, I want to be gracious for Charlie Kirk. I admired so much about him. So Isaiah 57 says, "The righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart and merciful men are taken away. None considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come." So that could just be one reason Charlie Kirk was taken to heaven. We would believe if he's saved by the grace of God. God sometimes takes them away to keep them from the evil to come. Now we don't know what evil would have came. The only worse evil that could have come perhaps would have been being a part of the ecumenical movement. And that's what a lot of people are concerned about is the ecumenical gathering of so many different faiths of Christians such as Catholics and Protestants uniting in the wake of Charlie's death. It is something to be concerned about. Of course, the Bible and brother Ram told us about the temptation that will come at the end time. He said it will come as follows. The economical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle becomes so strong politically that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join her with either directly or through adherence to principles enacted into law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of this council. Now this statement is not thus sayith the Lord but I think it's very scriptural. I think it's very accurate to Revelation 13. Notice the ecumenical move becomes so strong politically. So this unity of Catholics and Protestants will become so strong that'll put pressure on the government to change laws. Now we don't know if we'll see this in our day or the next generation or the following generation, but we always want to watch and pray. We always want to be ready by the grace of God. So definitely the evil to come is the uniting of the Catholics and Protestants. And I'll share a screenshot. There is an upcoming event in Washington DC with Catholics and Protestants all having communion together. It's called Communion America in Washington DC from October 9th to October 12th, 2025. A lot of false prophets are going to be a part of this. A lot of Catholics are going to be a part of this. So, this could be a sign that we're nearing the end. Of course, every day goes by, we're one day closer to the rapture of the church by the Lord Jesus Christ, the meeting in the air. So, we just want to be aware of that by the grace of God. Also remember Matthew 25:33 and34 at the great white throne judgment where the bride is sitting with Christ in judgment. The foolish virgin and all others are out in front of the white throne and they're being separated as sheep and goats. I just want to show what Jesus says to the foolish virgin. Verse 34, then the king shall say to them on his right hand, "Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." So it is such a blessing to be a foolish virgin. The Bible said, "Come ye blessed of my father." And notice God gives them an inheritance in the kingdom of God, which is eternal life. It is such a eternal blessing to be a Christian, to be saved, whether you're a wise virgin or foolish virgin. And you are blessed of the father just to be saved. That is how much love god has for the foolish virgin and the wise virgin. So friends, as I close this video here, let's unite with thus sayaith the Lord. Brother Ram said that's what the bride is doing. Uniting with thus sayith the Lord. We're not uniting with the ecumenical move. That is the great temptation of these last days. We will overcome it by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony. So continue to pray for Charlie's family. Pray that they will mourn and that they'll be comforted as brother prayed for Mrs. Kennedy. May there be a time in their deep bereiement that they'll find the full truth of the Bible, the message of the hour, Jesus Christ, because Jesus Christ is the only one who can give peace and comfort in the hour of trouble. We've prayed numerous times. We'll continue to pray for the Kirk family. I'll end this video by playing all these quotes. I thought it'd be easier that way. I'll just play all the quotes from what shall we do with this Jesus that's called Christ? And then I'll play a quote from the statue of perfect man where brother Ram talks about how the Catholics and Protestants were only divided on communion. But here we see now with this communion America event that they're coming together on the communion. So again a very prophetic profound statement from God's prophet brother Brandham. He said and there's the only thing they cannot get together on. They'll do it. Again another proof how brother Brandham had prophetic insight that the Catholics and Protestants had to come together on communion. And here they are in 2025, 62 years after brother Ram said it, coming together on communion. So friends, let's watch and pray. Let's seek God with all of our hearts. Let's be faithful. Let's get extra oil prepared now by the grace of God. Let's be the wise virgin. We will not unite with the ecumenical move of the Catholic and Protestants. We're uniting with thus sayith the Lord. God gave brother Brandham over 30 thus sayith the Lords. I've recently preached on that as well in a series called we have thus sayith the Lord. Let's unite with thus sayith the Lord because the Lord Jesus Christ has a bride and she's making herself ready. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm sure this morning that we're all uh aware of the great sadness that's happened to this nation of the loss of our president, Mr. Kennedy. Though I disagreed with the man in his politics and in his religion, but yet he doesn't deserve to die like that. &gt;&gt; No. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh leave those little children behind and old daddy and a mother. That's Mrs. Kennedy. Though I certainly wouldn't agree with her and her ways and things maybe, but remember she's a mother. She just lost her babies and she lost her husband and he fell right in her lap and her own husband's blood poured out over her lap. That's awful. And did you ever think sometimes we think she sets a pace for the nation and styles and things that may be so too but did you know Miss Kennedy never did hear one of these messages I preach about that if she might hear one of them message she might do different than some of our sisters that hear it and still won't cope with she's raised a Catholic that's all she knows nothing against that see she that's a system nothing against the people Catholic uh people that's a system. The Catholic system just like Presbyterian, Methodist, or any of the rest of them or Pentecostal, any of it. It's a system, not the people. Mr. Kennedy, I think, done a a good job at being president. My heart goes out for his wife. And I feel real sad about it that even our own nation would, the hoodlams and so forth and our nation would do a thing like that. If you can't disagree with a person uh right and take your own stand and there's no reason to kill another man just because of things like that and little children know said one little fell said now I don't have nobody to play with me no more daddy's gone see so &gt;&gt; I've always thought that would be my state someday it's almost happened several times as you know been shot in foreign nations when they've had to hold our bodies or me keep been shot at a distance so if a dies like that. But that's the price that's paid that goes with the glory of different things. See, I think we average about every fourth president, one out of four is assassinated. And um I feel uh very bad about it. Shame that we'd have such a person in America would do a thing like that. And now yet, as I said, I I disagreed with his politics. I'm I don't didn't agree with his ideas of what he was trying to do. But you see, he's another man. And I didn't agree with his system of religion. I I certainly didn't agree with that. But yet, he he is raised that way. That's that's what it was. I said maybe he'd heard something different. It might have been different. We have a a thing here we do that whenever one of our people dies or something even though out I think as a as a American church as a body of Americans the American people voted Mr. Kennedy in for president and uh that was that's the reason we're democracy I didn't vote for Mr. Kennedy I voted for Mr. Nixon because I know Mr. Nixon personally and uh I I liked him and I and I voted for him personally because I liked him. But the peoples of this country uh Americans, my fellow citizens of this nation elected Mr. Kennedy and the way they did it, well that's up between them and God, but that's that much. But I think for the sake of this mother, a human being, a mother of children, Mrs. Kennedy. Couldn't we just stand a moment for a prayer for her? Lord Jesus, we human beings, we have a feeling for one another. And we are sorry, Lord, that our president was shot down the way he was in cold blood murder. And we're so sorry that our nation has come to this spot that such people like that are are in our nation that would kill a human being and coldblooded murder like they shot that colored brother not long ago and just shot him right down in the cold blood of race prejudice. We're so sorry that such people exist among us. Lord, we our weakness has brought this about and we pray for Mrs. Kennedy, that uh wife of M the president and no them little babies looking upon their their father that left them a few days before that happy man and scuffled and played with them on the floor. Now they have no father. And for that woman that his wife, her own husband fell right in her lap and his blood run out on her dress, just bearing her baby. And yet, Lord, we might believe the woman being in the wrong of the the the way that she has set a pace in the nation of her dressing and so forth, but that that could be to the American people in whole. They that's what they want. So we we pray for her this morning that you'll help her and may there be a time in this deep bereiement that she'll find what is truth Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Grant it Lord the one who only can give peace and comfort in the hour of trouble. and help us Lord to continue to be with all of our hearts a shining light that we don't know what time or what influence we might be having upon somebody else. Let us shine forth the light of Christ until he comes. Then the great shepherd of the flock who knows all justice will bring every sin into recompense and he'll knows just how to do it. Until then, we commit ourselves into your hands for your love and mercy upon us in Jesus' name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't think no man deserves to die like that. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Now, Mr. Lincoln didn't deserve to die like that. &gt;&gt; No. Mr. McKinley didn't deserve to die like that. Huie Long didn't deserve to die like that. &gt;&gt; None of them fellas. I don't believe in that. Murders. That's bad. Our boys didn't fight overseas for something like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our flag wasn't raised for something like that. &gt;&gt; We're not American citizens for something like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; No. Although our nation is warped and twisted with sin, that's what what does these things. That's sin. Just as I have spoke of the president that was just assassinated, not the man, far as I know, is a good man. He never done anything evil as I know. But it's a system. It isn't the people. It's a system. But I ask you something. Can you imagine their guilt on Oswald's hands this morning? the one that murdered the president. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what his judgment will be if he's proven to be the one that did it? &gt;&gt; Can you could you imagine any mercy be left on him? The blood of the president of the United States is on his hands. Do you think the federal court, no matter how much he pleaded, I didn't mean to do it. That won't excuse him a bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll perish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why got the president's blood on his hands? &gt;&gt; Could you imagine his feelings? &gt;&gt; Would you want that on your hands? &gt;&gt; Oh, sir. &gt;&gt; When I heard the murder of President Kennedy, this message fell on my heart. I thought, "What will that man do?" No way out of it. Now you might have woke up by this time and realize what lays ahead. &gt;&gt; There's only one difference if they can just get over that. That's taking the communion. That's the only thing in the dascese that that that stops Catholicism and Protestantism from uniting is the order of communion. The Catholic church says it is the body and the Protestant church says it represents the body. The Catholic makes a mass out of it. a mass is that they take the communion hoping they are forgiven. The Protestant takes it by faith thanking God in communion that they are forgiven. &gt;&gt; The Protestant says we are forgiven. The Catholic says we're hoping we forgiven. Mass and communion. They call it a mass. We call it a communion. A mass is hoping it's so. A communion is knowing it's so and thanking for it. See, and there's the only thing that they cannot get together on. They'll do it. Oh, it looks very pretty. It'll unite around. It'll it'll run all the Well, the Bible said, "And these beasts gave their power unto the whore." See, &gt;&gt; united themselves together. &gt;&gt; See, just exactly what the Bible said they do, they're doing it now. It's right in possession of this very weak. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How does that have anything against Catholic people no more than Protestant people? You Methodists and Baptists and a lot of you Pentecostal, one of your churches has gone right into this Federation of Churches when they got the big marg built there in New York of that Federation of Churches. This the same as the United Nations and things. They're trying to unite all Protestantism together. Now, &gt;&gt; if you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He has never failed. [Music]
