[0:08] greetings friends and the matchless name
[0:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:13] this video is to emphasize the
[0:15] importance for Christians to have a
[0:18] morning routine in order to fulfill
[0:20] Jesus's command in Matthew 6:33 but seek
[0:24] ye first the kingdom of God and His
[0:26] righteousness and all these things shall
[0:29] be added unto you
[0:30] there's a lot of morning routine videos
[0:32] on YouTube some of which I've enjoyed to
[0:35] an extent but most don't mention God's
[0:38] Word about this subject
[0:40] I felt led to approach this subject
[0:42] through a biblical perspective during
[0:45] this video I want to make seven points
[0:47] about a morning routine including my
[0:49] personal tips for maintaining your
[0:51] morning routine point number one a
[0:54] morning routine includes prayer singing
[0:57] Bible reading and discussion in order to
[1:01] obey Jesus's command to seek ye first
[1:03] the kingdom of God you learn from
[1:05] Jesus's own example to seek God first
[1:08] right away in the morning mark 1 verses
[1:11] 34 and 35 shows how Jesus rose up a
[1:14] great while before day in order to get
[1:17] in a private place to pray even after
[1:19] doing many miracles the day before this
[1:22] proves no matter how miraculous a
[1:24] ministry is the gifted servant of God
[1:27] must immediately humble himself in
[1:29] private prayer to crucify the lusts of
[1:32] the flesh pride of life and the lust of
[1:35] the eyes in order to overcome
[1:36] temptations Moses's Tabernacle in the
[1:41] wilderness had morning and evening
[1:42] sacrifices which included burning
[1:45] incense exodus 30 verse 7 and Aaron
[1:49] shall burn thereon sweet incense every
[1:51] morning when he dresses the lamps he
[1:53] shall burn incense upon it david says
[1:57] incense represents prayer in Psalms 141
[2:01] verse 2 psalms 141 verse 2 let my prayer
[2:06] be set forth before thee as incense and
[2:08] the lifting up of my hands as the
[2:10] evening sacrifice the Shema Israel's
[2:14] traditional morning and evening prayer
[2:16] includes the commands to discuss God's
[2:18] commands at night in the morning and
[2:21] throughout the day Deuteronomy 6 7 and
[2:24] thou shalt teach them diligently unto
[2:26] thy children and shalt talk of them when
[2:28] thou sittest in thine house and when
[2:30] thou walkest by the way and when thou
[2:32] liest down and when thou rises up David
[2:37] a man after God's own heart wrote songs
[2:39] about his love to seek God early in the
[2:41] morning through prayer and singing
[2:43] Psalms 5 verse 3 my voice shalt thou
[2:47] hear in the morning O Lord in the
[2:49] morning will I direct my prayer unto
[2:50] thee and will look up Psalms 5517
[2:54] evening and morning and at noon will I
[2:57] pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my
[2:59] voice Psalm 63 1 a psalm of David when
[3:04] he was in the would earn Asada oh God
[3:06] thou art my god early will I seek thee
[3:09] my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh
[3:12] longeth for thee and a dry and thirsty
[3:13] land where no water is Psalm 63 7 my
[3:19] heart is fixed
[3:20] o God my heart is fixed I will sing and
[3:23] give praise a wake up my glory awake
[3:26] psaltery and harp I myself will awake
[3:29] early I will praise thee O Lord among
[3:32] the people I will sing unto thee among
[3:34] the nations
[3:37] point number two a morning routine
[3:40] begins by winning the battle of the mind
[3:44] becoming a Christian enlists you in
[3:46] God's army and you're instantly engaged
[3:48] in spiritual warfare and the battlefield
[3:50] is your mind in second Corinthians
[3:53] chapter 10 Paul says we are in a
[3:55] spiritual war but God has given us
[3:57] mighty weapons to cast down imaginations
[3:59] and every thought that goes against
[4:01] God's Word your mind is one of your
[4:05] three parts as man is a three-part being
[4:08] body human spirit or mind and soul your
[4:13] human spirit or mind is your
[4:14] consciousness we're thinking takes place
[4:16] and where all decisions are made your
[4:19] mind gets messages from both the soul
[4:21] and body the soul sends the message to
[4:24] commune with God meeting the spiritual
[4:26] needs the body sends messages to meet
[4:29] the physical needs so your mind is like
[4:32] a battlefield where Satan attacks you
[4:34] shooting arrows of Lies trying to
[4:37] influence you to meet only the physical
[4:38] needs the way to win the battle of the
[4:41] mind is to gird up the loins of your
[4:43] mind with truth as Peter and Paul say in
[4:46] 1st Peter 1:13 and Ephesians 6:14 1st
[4:51] Peter 1:13 wherefore gird up the loins
[4:54] of your mind be sober and hope to the
[4:57] end for the grace that is to be brought
[4:58] unto you at the revelation of Jesus
[5:01] Christ
[5:02] Ephesians 6:14 stand therefore having
[5:05] your loins gird about with truth and
[5:08] having on the breastplate of
[5:09] righteousness notice the loins gird
[5:12] about with truth are the first part of
[5:14] the Christians armor that Paul mentions
[5:16] every morning you must first win the
[5:19] battle of the mind each morning you must
[5:22] choose truth Jesus says the truth makes
[5:25] you free in John 8:32 the truth is you
[5:29] are in a spiritual battle and you're
[5:31] either getting stronger for Christ or
[5:32] weaker when you choose to believe and
[5:35] act upon truth you will begin to prepare
[5:37] for the spiritual battles for the day
[5:39] and carry out christ's orders for each
[5:41] day you will first meet the spiritual
[5:44] needs of your soul and then God promises
[5:47] to meet your natural needs
[5:50] point number three a morning routine
[5:52] helps keep your soul aimed at Christ in
[5:55] his kingdom to prove this point let's
[5:58] look at Matthew 6:33 in context Jesus is
[6:02] describing out most people seek food
[6:04] drink and clothes obtaining these
[6:07] necessities consumes their thinking but
[6:09] Jesus says seek first his kingdom I'll
[6:12] define his words the Greek word for seek
[6:15] is zto which means to seek for a met
[6:19] strive after ie require demand to crave
[6:24] demands something from someone Jesus is
[6:27] saying aim first strive first crave
[6:31] first for my kingdom where does the
[6:34] desire to seek Jesus come from again man
[6:38] has three parts body spirit and soul
[6:41] according to 1st Thessalonians 5:23 so
[6:44] it has to come from one of these parts
[6:47] friend your desires come from your soul
[6:50] your body has natural desires which
[6:52] Jesus mentioned food drink and clothing
[6:55] your spear or mine thinks plans reasons
[6:58] remembers and more but your desires come
[7:01] from your soul which is your nature
[7:04] Isaiah says the desire of our soul is to
[7:07] thy name with my soul have I desire thee
[7:11] in the night if you're seeking God first
[7:14] everyday your soul has peace with Christ
[7:17] the reason you may not be seeking God
[7:19] first is because your soul is not right
[7:22] with God so quickly repent say you're
[7:25] sorry to God and ask him to create in
[7:27] you a clean heart with a pure desire
[7:31] next the Greek definition of Kingdom is
[7:33] Dominion or rule Jesus says aim first
[7:37] for my Dominion or rule in your life
[7:40] Jesus is saying do not be dominated by
[7:44] seeking the gain of natural food drink
[7:46] and clothes aim to be dominated by
[7:49] searching and gaining spiritual food
[7:52] drink and clothing which is Christ's
[7:54] righteousness in your soul feed the
[7:57] inward desire to gain the Holy Ghost
[7:59] rule over your life next jeez
[8:03] says seek his righteousness in the Greek
[8:07] righteousness means integrity virtue
[8:09] purity of life rightness correctness of
[8:12] thinking feeling and acting Jesus says
[8:16] first seek aim and strive to be inwardly
[8:20] ruled by my integrity virtue purity or
[8:23] correct acting have Jesus meet your
[8:26] spiritual needs first and then he
[8:28] promises to meet your natural needs this
[8:33] reminds us of Peters words in 2nd Peter
[8:35] 1 verses 5 to 8 in which the Apostle
[8:38] tells us to give all diligence to add
[8:41] Christ character qualities to our being
[8:43] such as faith virtue knowledge
[8:46] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[8:49] kindness and charity you are seeking
[8:52] Christ's righteousness when you are
[8:54] asking God to add these qualities to
[8:56] your character notice in the next verse
[8:59] after the C key first command Matthew
[9:01] 6:34 Christ says don't worry about
[9:04] tomorrow just focus on today's spiritual
[9:07] needs take therefore no thought for the
[9:10] morrow for the morrow shall take thought
[9:12] for the things of itself sufficient unto
[9:15] the day is the evil thereof seeking
[9:19] Jesus's kingdom first is also called
[9:21] giving him preeminence or first place in
[9:24] your life Jesus wants 1st place in all
[9:27] things according to Colossians 1:18
[9:29] Jesus deserves 1st place in your life in
[9:33] mine Colossians 1:18 and he is the head
[9:36] of the body the church who is the
[9:38] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[9:40] that in all things he might have the
[9:43] preeminence the Holy Ghost wants the
[9:45] daily rule your mind and attitude
[9:47] finances health relationships family
[9:51] work life or school life and every other
[9:55] area for his glory
[9:58] in summary you learn Matthew 6 3 means
[10:02] this see key first aim first for the
[10:06] kingdom of God the rule or dominance of
[10:08] the Holy Ghost baptism and his
[10:11] righteousness his integrity virtue
[10:13] purity or correct acting and all these
[10:16] things
[10:17] food drink and clothes shall be added
[10:20] unto you
[10:22] point number four a morning routine is
[10:25] your opportunity to seek wisdom the
[10:27] principle thing as one of my recent
[10:30] video show Jesus says you will be one of
[10:33] two kinds of Christians wise are foolish
[10:35] according to Matthew 25 verses 1 to 13
[10:39] for wise virgins a synonymous phrase for
[10:43] wisdom might be the perfect will of God
[10:46] the Holy Spirit through Solomon in
[10:49] proverbs 4 7 urged believers to seek or
[10:52] get wisdom above all else which agrees
[10:55] with Jesus's Sikhi first teaching
[10:57] therefore wisdom tells you to seek God
[11:00] first
[11:01] which obviously points to making our
[11:03] search for wisdom the first thing to do
[11:05] each and every day God's Word shows us
[11:09] we need to have a Christ centered and
[11:11] Kingdom seeking morning routine
[11:13] scripture has much to say on wisdom the
[11:17] Hebrew word for wisdom means skillful
[11:19] shrewdness so you learn wisdom is
[11:21] skillful decision making or intelligent
[11:24] judgment our God highly values wisdom
[11:27] proverbs 4 7 says wisdom is the
[11:30] principal thing therefore get wisdom and
[11:32] with all thy getting get understanding
[11:36] wisdom is the principle or chief thing
[11:38] or the beginning thing or the first
[11:41] thing a Christian needs to get this
[11:44] might remind you of another scripture
[11:46] psalms 111 verse 10 the fear of the Lord
[11:49] is the beginning of wisdom the fear of
[11:52] the Lord is a healthy respect and
[11:54] reverence for God that causes you to
[11:56] constantly humble yourself recognize
[11:59] your littleness and remember Christ's
[12:01] awesome terrifying power you will become
[12:04] wise as you constantly remember how
[12:06] awesome God is and how weak and little
[12:09] you are but know this is a character
[12:11] trait you need to get according to
[12:13] proverbs 4 7 the way to get wisdom is to
[12:16] see God for it
[12:19] point number five a morning routine
[12:22] helps you redeem your time knowing it is
[12:25] Jesus's command and not a suggestion in
[12:28] Matthew 6:33 to seek God's kingdom and
[12:31] righteousness first you begin to see the
[12:33] importance of your time we all know
[12:36] there are a few things as precious as
[12:37] time Paul teaches the wise redeemed
[12:41] their time in Ephesians 5 14 through 17
[12:44] and Colossians 4 verses 5 & 6 wherefore
[12:49] he saith awake thou that sleepest and
[12:51] arise from the dead and Christ shall
[12:53] give the light see then that ye walk
[12:55] circumspectly not as fool's but as wise
[12:59] redeeming the time because the days are
[13:01] evil wherefore be not unwise but
[13:04] understanding what the will the Lord is
[13:08] walk and wisdom toward them that are
[13:10] without redeeming the time let your
[13:13] speech be alway with grace seasoned with
[13:15] salt that you may know how ye ought to
[13:18] answer every man redeeming in the Greek
[13:22] means to buy up to buy up for oneself
[13:25] for one's use to make wise and sacred
[13:28] use of every opportunity for doing good
[13:30] so that zeal and well doing are as it
[13:34] were the purchase money by which we make
[13:36] the time our own all the time in your
[13:40] life is precious Paul says we must be
[13:42] wise with how we use our time it's our
[13:45] responsibility to use time for God's
[13:47] glory according to the Bible you can
[13:50] either be wise or foolish with your time
[13:52] wise Christians will daily seek first
[13:55] God's kingdom the inward ruling of the
[13:59] Holy Ghost wise Christians start their
[14:01] day seeking first Christ's integrity
[14:04] virtue purity and correct acting foolish
[14:08] Christians won't make the best use of
[14:10] their time they will seek natural needs
[14:12] first before seeking spiritual needs of
[14:15] Jesus's kingdom point number six a lack
[14:20] of a morning routine may reveal a
[14:22] lukewarm spiritual condition it's
[14:25] crucial to note that one of the greatest
[14:27] rebukes in the Bible is Jesus's
[14:29] chastisement of the rich Laodicean
[14:31] Church in
[14:32] revelation three verses 16 and 17 so
[14:36] then because thou art lukewarm and
[14:37] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[14:39] out of my mouth because thou sayest I am
[14:42] rich and increased with Goods and have
[14:44] need of nothing and knowest not that
[14:47] thou art wretched and miserable and poor
[14:49] and blind and naked in verse 16 Christ
[14:53] tells this church he is spewing them out
[14:55] of his mouth meaning they can no longer
[14:58] be his mouthpiece and speak for him
[15:00] because they are lukewarm it's true many
[15:03] churches today do not speak for Jesus
[15:06] Christ
[15:07] because they are lukewarm and feel no
[15:09] more need for Jesus's wisdom Jesus says
[15:13] this church cares more about physical
[15:15] needs than spiritual needs and are
[15:17] become wretched miserable poor blind and
[15:19] naked they need nothing from Jesus they
[15:23] prefer riches natural gold or money more
[15:27] than trial tested Gold of faith like
[15:29] Peter speaks of in 1st Peter 1:17 they
[15:33] lust after fancy clothes yet are
[15:35] spiritually naked lacking the white
[15:37] raiment of Christ righteous character a
[15:39] corner revelation 19 verse 8 thir
[15:42] they're spiritually blind rejecting the
[15:45] anointing of the Holy Spirit I self and
[15:47] cannot see or understand the kingdom of
[15:49] God because they are not born again like
[15:53] John 3 verse 3 says jesus answered and
[15:56] said unto Him verily verily I say unto
[15:58] thee except a man be born again he
[16:00] cannot see or understand the kingdom of
[16:03] God which group of Christians are you
[16:06] associated with those interested in the
[16:08] physical needs gold or money fancy
[16:11] clothes and lust of the eyes or
[16:13] spiritual needs time-tested faith
[16:16] Christ's righteous people
[16:19] I cite
[16:22] point number seven here's four helpful
[16:25] tips for a christ-centered morning
[16:27] routine number one take care of your
[16:30] body meaning go to bed earlier so you
[16:32] can wake earlier each morning I begin
[16:34] with drinking lots of water to hydrate
[16:36] my body some mornings I'll do a little
[16:38] exercise like push-ups or squats to wake
[16:41] up my body it's also important to eat
[16:43] healthy and limit sugar intake for
[16:46] example I quit drinking pop about 20
[16:48] years ago ii begin with prayer and the
[16:52] bible meaning get alone with god in your
[16:55] closet and pray to God just as Jesus
[16:58] commanded make a prayer list if needed
[17:00] play a worship song as you pray and sing
[17:03] along to glorify Christ then read a
[17:06] chapter in your Bible to feed your soul
[17:08] even daily journaling what you've
[17:10] learned and your questions number three
[17:14] avoid phone addiction meaning make
[17:17] something else your alarm clock rather
[17:18] than your smartphone or tablet I use my
[17:21] watch as my alarm keeping my phone
[17:23] turned off all night this helps me start
[17:26] the day without wasting time on social
[17:28] media or other apps and number four
[17:32] write out your goals meaning invest in a
[17:35] cheap journal and write out your goals
[17:37] each night and morning to increase your
[17:39] focus I've learned this through Michael
[17:41] Hyatt and John Maxwell

[17:47] blessing to you so you could see the
[17:49] scriptural basis for a morning routine
