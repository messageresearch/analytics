yes there were two men in one city the one rich and the other four the rich man had seen many flocks and herbs but the poor man had nothing saved one little new lamb which he had brought bought in your stuff and he grew up together with him and with his children he would eat of his own needs and drink he drank his own cup and lay in his wisdom and was unto him there came a traveler to the rich man and he spared to take his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the way for a man that was come unto him but took the poor man's land and addressed it adjusted for the man that was come to him [Music] romans all of us in our hearts we keep our desires our hopes our prayers um through the will of god we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god and to them who are called [Music] called and who he called them he also justified him and he would be justified amen amen is hallelujah um um is the next election last one did a major thing um um um that's right [Laughter] want to bring that out there that protect strong enough even yeah i have no shame in the squeeze i'll be happy to find any kind of joke or whatever we find you know whatever god would preserve and give us we would be grateful toothpaste a toothpaste maybe a bristle maybe just something to clean our teeth i'll be happy in that time amen amen and i want to say that because a lot of times and this keeps us humble this a lot of us some of us have made tremendously good choices and have not suffered so much in their lives right right and then others of us have made wrong choices or choices that were maybe not in god's perfect will and wanted and i'll say it like this everything is predestinated every decision you've made right perfect will permissive will was ordained by god everything well brothers what about you know this portion of my life was a really dark portion it was over that's right and brother this this so-so person was annoying to the devil to do this and to do that it was ordained that's right by then uh you'll be able to see clearly you know i'm just a teacher but in a maybe a slow one uh but i want to be a clear one if i could do anything and i want to make if i can't understand it myself and i'll never be able to bring it to you so even though this might be a simple thought i want to be able to bring this to you and show that how god can use even i'd say just not even just say even but god is going to use you and all your faults and all your failures and all your battles and all your and every single thing that you would count and examine your as the bible says to examine oneself right as you examine yourself run through your past and man i if i wouldn't have done this maybe this would happen if i would have done this maybe that wouldn't happen examine yourself and by the end of this you should be able to see that everything is going to work lord because remember you have nothing to do no i mean literally because remember oh well this this brother's strong and this sister strong god gave them that way history to never have been down more than half an hour his entire life god built him that way brother i get depressed for months and six months or a year at a time you were built that way amen amen i don't understand it because why it's in the mind of god right right we are all children divine children of god we ordain us to be this way and he said us no and here we are well into your life be grateful that you are here amen lord i might know some people who earned this message believe all these doctrines of belief jesus christ and all those things are saved and yet they're having the roughest time of life is jesus christ enough yes yes hallelujah he is enough hey sometimes we might not ancient sometimes watch some of these christian videos for the children where they go back and examine some of these old-time warriors that lost their wives their husbands and war and this and that and served god to their very last day and it was never encountered that they got down they pressed and pressed and pressed and they were known as them as a woman of god or a man of god yes yes amen suffer tremendously yes but all things work together for good right and that's not just but that is for those who love him do we love jesus christ is he our absolute is he our is our love for jesus christ far exceeds anything else or anyone hallelujah yes you know what my wife i married sister beth here and there's a lot of times i just i go to thailand i call this island he doesn't question i ask her to permission to go or hey should i go then i just go because god told me to go and if we have a bible study i see let's feel like a home we pack up i take a shower sometimes i don't take a shower we go into a bible study go ask your permission no because the door is open glory and she's under that uh understanding i'm under the understanding that the word is first yeah this is not i'm not building a king i have i can't even i can't do anything without jesus christ so what we're doing we're just trying to sow seeds for our lord notice how in john 5 and verse 19 and then answer jesus and the sentence and then bear the grace the son can't do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things so ever he do it these also do with the son likewise so jesus christ was the he was the he he was a copy or the imitator of god he wanted to be he he was god but he did what the father told him to do what what god the father showed him to do and then he says for the father loveth the son right i taught this a little bit maybe a year ago or whatever but what jesus god almighty the invisible god the person who is god the invisible the almighty one he loveth the son he loves that image he loves the lord he loves everything about it because what it is it is another portion of him amen because in the beginning was the word with god in that word that logos was god right yes the logos that was dancing before god in the beginning of dancing a body i said when that light body received the life it just was with total joy amen that's how we should be as well amen yes sure for the father to love his son and shoot him all things that himself doeth and he that he will shoe them greater works than thee that he may marvel the father loveth the son right amen amen then and i want to show you how much he loveth the sunlight because there was a scriptural tie to this in hebrews i don't know if they may remember this one but in hebrews 1 and verse 7 he says and of the angels this is saint paul now uh the prophet of god the apostle of god now as maybe as the prophet said was the 12th disciple he is now diving into the old testament he says and of the angels he says he make us his angels spirits and his ministers opinion of fire but unto the son he saith now here's god almighty speaking to the son right he's speaking to the logos this was recorded all the way back in in psalms he says thy throne o god so here the almighty father now cause the son god right i'm god and your god what and together they are one right sure he says i throw god is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness in the chapter of thy kingdom thou has loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even thy god has anointed thee with the old with the oil of gladness above thy pillow so here he says he says you're god he says and i'm god absolutely wow but that it's a mystery to most yeah we understand it right and not just an understanding but a revelation [Music] the sun lord or the body lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and of the heavens are the works of thine hands jesus they shall perish but thou reminisce and they all shall wax old as that the garment as a vessel thou shalt hold them up and they shall be changed jesus but thou art the same what the word cannot change amen jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever cannot be changed that's one of the things i love brother about brother jesse's testimony my dad would sit in there and teach him about jose canseco brother jasmine jose consignor was drafted by the that was the oakland hayes i believe and he received that number 23 right and just like no no no that was number 30. i tried to see him right there the same and thy years shall not fail amen and that is what he's talking about jesus the son sure yeah but now it fears to go back here to now he pulled here in hebrews 1 8 he says the sun he's saying thy throne that that portion of scripture now is shooting all the way back to psalms 45 and verse 1. and this is the beautiful part about this paul saint paul was able by the holy ghost because remember all scripture was given by the inspiration holyos led him in the first chapter he was to tithe and to pull this but he leaves out verse one but if we want to examine where he pulled it from what was before like i said into the chief musician upon uh this man there uh for the sons of mora and michelle the song a song of love the father love it amen the song of love he says now what is the spirit saying through here he says my heart is indicting that's what he's saying he says a good master he says i speak of the things which i have made touching the king of jesus my tongue is the pen of already right right man and who's writing it was god almighty yes but the thing i love is that my heart isn't dying the very heart of god was indicting and that word and dieting means boiling or bubbles up he says it means probably to boil up or over as a fountain and the idea here is that his heart is boiled over the motion of love it was full and overflowing it found expression in the words of his songs and the hebrew word does not occur occurred elsewhere in the bible amen but that kind of i'll say this divine love that the father has for the son is found nowhere else in the bible except right here it is pulled all the way back amen amen yes that's how much god loves the son and as he then went further thou art fairer than the children of man he's talking uh of god almighty grace is poured into thy lips and therefore god has blessed you forever bring up thy sword of fortnite upon thy thigh almost bitey with thy glory with that majesty and it goes on and goes on and then here we catch up in hebrews right here in verse six which is hebrews i believe or whatever the three years he says my throne oh god is forever and ever the scepter of thy kingdom is the righteous scepter thou lovest righteousness and hate his iniquity therefore god thy god has anointed you with the word of glass you know it's exactly going through but notice in verse 8 all thy garments smell of myrrh right yes and that is time obviously ty burr was employed in the embalming of dead bodies this is jesus christ amen he is the god of all those things he and the father loveth the son amen now i wanted to start with the father love of the son look how much god loved that image look how much god loves his son jesus christ right yes and what would that make you because if he would send that image or that body down and make a transaction it would have to be an equal transaction if he was the son to purchase his bride it would have to have the same value amount and that's how much god loves you amen had a amen how much that father would love the bride yes yes amen glory absolutely sure absolutely we are joined heirs with jesus christ yes it's promised that we would do the greater and worse than even what we came in the first coming right we are moving into something powerful and by the grace of this grace of god we'll show you how much greater because the because it's a it's a pattern if the pattern hits the same if jesus christ was saying yesterday forever the pattern will hit the same every time right yes uh back to this he says for we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god right now as we're going through life we have many we call maybe sidetracks i didn't get your name you're harry's son isaiah isaiah is coming up to manliness super tall getting super strong probably as smart as dead and you're gonna have to make choices here pretty soon you've got many things up the road here yes you've got big choices to make and you must make the right ones amen and thank god you were brought up in what you brought up i'm praying to god you've seen wisdom in the household you've seen wisdom behind the pulpit you've saw god you've done all the things and for the young here this is where they're at they have to make good decisions me growing up very little leadership or guidance in the home i'll say it like that right wow but god ordained it right and yet we find ourselves here in the word of god and here we are blessed beyond amen amen i was just this man here at just his old age years ago and now i'm worried i'll give you i'm gonna give you a testimony how age works anybody play basketball here my brother jesse was actually was a witness this and so is my wife and actually all my nephews nieces and bears probably probably so my niece paige had a graduation party we went to it and i one of my nephews is six foot three my father i thought we always called him mr bub sam jr six foot three hundred eighty pounds sixteen years old big boy i wanna as an uncle i i'm not scared of him i wanna play him in basketball she started playing basketball and um i made it three rounds and i had i had to so the last drive i had i was driving and i was going to uh stop and then kind of i don't know you play basketball you're driving to the basket but i was not going to go to the layout because you're six foot three so i'm gonna actually stop and kick back and do one of those things like style or whatever and i was driving i was driving 43 years old and i could not stop i just continue just ran out of bounds i just ran just kept running i could not stop and shoot i just wait my legs could not stop when i was your age i could do those things but now i'm finding wow these are looking rough we're getting we're getting older our generation we're getting older yeah now we've really got to get the best of the best and we've been doing it for years but we've got to get more and more in tune with the spirit amen and as we see our flesh we're losing less of this less strength less control of this we're now depending more on the holy ghost to control our actions control our thoughts control our words and those sort of things so we want to remember all things are going to work out just because i cannot drive the hoop stop and make a basket does not mean my days are over it just shows me i need to start studying more and praying more because that's what i'm going to be depending on because my flesh will be nothing i'll be able to do in the flesh right right not by might not my power but by my spirit amen we must have the holy ghost move through now if we know that all things work together for those that love god right how many have made a mistake in their lives i could hold up my toes and fingers and my feet and all that i would i would then add some more and have thousands and thousands and thousands of mistakes yes sir in my life but god loves us right and what's he going to do he says and here in hebrews 12 5 and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despised thou not the chastities of the lord how many have gotten spanked by god absolutely two years ago i was i hit probably two and a half years ago hit 40 and i was getting that and uh i started lifting weights and exercising and i'll say like this you know if you are a seed of god and god has got you a certain way there are some things if you are are built a certain way i'll say this i'm not just saying me but anyone's built a seed of god and they have the holy ghost you're not going to be able to get away with what others do that's right there are many you'll see you may see many people in this message get away with things and you try it and you get spanked right away that's right yes sir absolutely and that is his divine love towards you and when i did that i had because it puts brother against brother right and then emotions get involved then heart and feelings and those sort of things and god will spend you every time that's right i'm witness right that's one of my mistakes one my son despise not of chastening of the lord when when nor faint when thou rebuked him for whomsoever the lord loveth he chastened right yes we better thank god for our spiritual spankings whether they come in the spirit realm or natural realm he says if you can take it and say yes lord thank you so much for spanking me thank you so much for getting me back on the straight arrow for correcting me and keeping me exactly where you want me right yes i've been very careful on things like that yes first corinthians 11 31 if we would judge ourselves we should not be joined right there's a decision i'm making next week i have to do this and that is the correct decision uh the the leading of the lord on this certain situation is the circumstance coming up in my life is this though is this well the thing i want to do is that the correct will we have to we have to now we have to pray through and find out these as these fleeting moments as god has as this time the scenes of time or the same time are now winding down we're about to make our last final decisions here yes we must make sure these are correct because when do we make our worst decisions under pressure or when we're tired right that's when we make our worst decisions right and what does the prophet say he says there's a temptation coming there is a pressure coming yes there is a decision coming to all the world rich and poor small and big and free and bond and all those things everyone is coming now to a great decision yes we must and we believe we have already made that decision yeah but we have to mention again because there's something coming yes and this thing is going to look so good as the prophet said there's going to be an invitation it's going to look like that that at this point of moment what we're going to about to see it's going to look like that's going to break into a golden age like no other all right well brother i know what the prophet said but look what look what they're doing out here in the world look what they're doing in politics everything's being fixed and orchestrated just i mean what if they come out with the highways that the the bubble cars can drive through and we don't have to drive what if we have what if they promise all the technology and free energy and all those things what if it becomes a man this looks like perfect when we sell out knowing that just moments after peace and safety is uttered destruction all right amen he says but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world amen amen lord thank us all amen and of course in our days as many as i love as he loves christ i rebuke and chase and be zealous therefore and repent amen how do you become his love because remember if god loved the son and the spirit of the sun was in you god will love you lord amen let's continue on here and i want to kind of work with this just for a season here and we're 30 minutes in i hope you're doing okay i know i'm not captain uh or anything like that i'm just just meeting this little teacher here just trying to convey a thought by the grace of god and i think this is going to be a good nugget here we're going to break open just to show you about a beautiful your life amen despite all all mistakes god is going to think amen every one of you is going to be a masterpiece in the hand of god if you will just submit and let him use it yes for his glory you're gonna you'll see how beautiful this is hallelujah and some of you may have heard this or maybe even thought of it or whatever but to me this was a nugget i've never heard before just a beautiful thing inside the samuel 12 9 now we're dealing with david and beshebi here and just kind of a rough situation in verse 9 wherefore has to despise the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight right so god hears out bringing judgment upon the king he says thou hast killed your eyes a hittite with the sword has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of am not among right now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house one mistake and he reaped it the rest of his life that's right sometimes that's it that's why if you mess up one time it is going to affect the rest of your life right yes sir big decisions which are always what usually aimed at going against the word of god that's right if we do to make the correct decision of going in the word of god we will be in the clear amen there will be no story against your house there will be no judgment this illusion if we stay in the word of god right now jesus because thou has despised me and has taken the wife to be uh to be thy why now notice he said how be it because by this deed thou has given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme see our little mistakes make god look those little mistakes that we make that the world sees make us look like a joke yes sir and it brings reproach against us and our lord and savior our little mistakes oral big mistakes right sure yes shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee which framed mischief by our law in other words he said he said if they see something you've done wrong and they take the word of god which is the law of god and they they they bring in such a way that you look guilty they still don't want them to do it right and yet they'll take the word of god and pin you to the wall and say you messed up here you messed up there you messed up there right they gather themselves together against the souls of the righteous and condemn the innocent blood why are they innocent because they have the baptism of the holy spirit all right despite all your faults and failures god sees you as spotless as pure amen as innocent otherwise he would not have a bride of this day otherwise he would not come and get you but because you have the baptism of the holy ghost that makes you wide as the white is still amen amen [Applause] i'm not that good i can't even think like i'm a good christian i just have to be myself and be yourselves you live according to how the holy ghost gives you strength the bible says uh every man is given a measure of faith that's right however you live and don't compare yourself well i'm not scared of corona well they might be that's right well i can't judge that man because he's scared even though he's in the message of the holy ghost because what he was only given that measure of faith everyone was given a different amount yes yes more strengths different weaknesses yes sir amen we must have everything covered by the blood amen amen yes now now notice here the jews were over charging their brother uh as they would be sold and lose their lands lose their properties and all those things and tough times and hard times and the richer brother would buy them out and and but notice they were actually charging them look at verse 6 nehemiah he says i was very angry when i heard their cry in these words then i consulted with myself and i rebuked the nobles and the rulers and sentenced them the exact ushering or interest every one of his brother and i set a great assembly against him he says what are you doing to your brothers charging interest giving them loans and now you're trying to make money off your own flesh and blood sell them out they keeping them poorer than they should be and what that was a commandment of the lord not to do those sort of things and god comes and uses the man of god and condemns him for it yes he says not only have you broken the word but look what it says in verse nine he says also i said it is not good that you do it oh you're not to walk in the fear of our god because of the reproach of the heathen are enemies it makes us look bad when we do each other wrong that's right what does john 13 say a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another yes as i have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have one if you have loved one to another amen the bible says what he says they'll know us by our love [Applause] that's right amen well the lord never told me to give he doesn't if you see a name take care of it amen it's the body it's a body work if i have something here or wrong on my arm if i just oh i don't need that arm or this this but i try to take care of that arm because i'm going to need that arm absolutely that arm is part of me sure yes and we're afraid of the body of christ we should help one another love one another do what we can for one another where a certain group had gathered at a restaurant and each one made their order for food and this and this and this this one ordered that one this sister this brother that they ordered and one sister forgot her money you know what no one stepped up and said i'll pay for that not one she sat there much no one would even buy this sister that was not in the cafeteria nothing struck anyone's heart and said wow maybe i could spare ten dollars right ten dollars fifteen dollars yes what's fifteen don't know us by our love amen yes hallelujah you know if you if you let god bless you he will bless you he will give you that abundantly more amen amen jesus christ is a giver yes he is a giver he gives not just natural not just he gives yeah yes what a gift of god lord is eternal life and not an eternal life in a body the ages he gives you a new body and eternal body amen amen and in that eternal life what a deal proverbs 17 15 he that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the just even they both are an abomination to the lord he's up there every day i was just witnessing that to a a a catholic man about a week ago actually the two apprentices and the man here and i was talking about the apprentice who was listening and they i they said you know i said you know where devil's at they don't know he's in heaven they go look at each other yeah the bible i haven't pulled the scripture up to him the bible says he's up there day and night accusing the brother what us for our little mistakes that's right our little attitudes our little anger a little this little that satan's up there accusing us to god all right slay them take them down they've broken your word again they don't believe you they don't love you and you've gone the lamb is all [Applause] hey sure but notice here no weapon that's formed against these shells prosper never said they wouldn't prosper a little bit but it shall prosper in the end it ain't gonna happen again and every tongue that shall rise against the judgment thou shalt condemn amen well you mean well because i made this mistake i made a certain mistake here listen and someone may rise up with the great judgment throne and have the same mistake and say god why would you let them get away with it not me and i would have to say i repented of my sins amen and i pleaded the blood of jesus christ and i got baptized in the name of jesus christ amen and he was i received the baptism of the holy ghost and the bible says if that seed remains in you you are sinless amen and that's all we can say is that what by his praise but what he did we are clean and free absolutely but it's going to come to play here very shortly we're going to need all that testimony the blood of jesus christ we're going to need it all and that fiery baptism the holy ghost we're going to need it all amen because people that me and you and i know that we have this we have to say it because we're we don't want to sugarcoat anything there will be people we know that we're not going to make it i'm not talking rapture i'm talking heaven in general they know our worst they might know our best and they will rise up and condemn us well he never taught me a bible study and he never listened to this and i'll say it is the grace of god why do you think after this every tongue that survives in the judgment thou shall condemn why do you think the bible has the bible says he's gonna have to wipe our tears away again yes you know he might turn tears away twice in this relationship yes by the leadership he says for the lord god will help me therefore shall i not be compounded therefore i've set my face like a flint and i know that i shall not be ashamed he is he is near that justifies me if you have the holy ghost in you and god is now dwelling with you and with you even though someone might point out your faultlessness i could say well i am still justified because he's with me right who will contend with me let us stand together who is my adversary let us come here to me what because we have the presence of god almighty amen dwelling in the shadows by the grace of god hallelujah and what will that listen let's say i do make a mistake what will i say say sir i made a mistake i'm very very sorry if you apologize yes yes he's a witness that i have made everything right now with something him now everything will he forgive me all right believe me okay with me will he treat me the exact same before i made it as he did before i made that mistake that's right now it's up to him now it's his fault but we have done the procedure that god gave us to make things right yes amen you go yes amen he says behold the lord god will help me who is he that would shall condemn me and lo they shall all wax all of the garments eat them up and this scripture right here is all in all we love him because he first love us yes hallelujah because he chose you to [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] oh i said lord i said lord you know once i get that body i'll never do anything to live in again presence of god because once you get there you say there's nothing like it nothing can compare with the love of god yes hallelujah let's put all that little foundation here for this okay we're at 43 so give about 15 more minutes all right okay i hope this new proportion will be a blessing because this to me when i seen this it just this proves that every mistake we've made well i'm have big mistakes well even though those little mistakes that it still haunts you because some people have lived pretty good lives they made little mistakes and you know what what they talk about those little mistakes that little things that their little fox will spoil that vine if like big things i've missed cool sure i didn't go up in the message or know the truth or anything but you know what god ordained him right god ordained it that was god's plan for us yes even your current position in life right now is god's plan it was in the mind of god well brother i should have been here if i made this it was in the mind of god yes he knew and the lord said nathanael unto david and he came unto him and said to him there were two men in one city one rich and the other four the rich man had exceeded the many flocks and herds and the poor men had nothing saved one little you lamb and he had brought it up and nursed it and grew together with him and with his children and then they eat of his own media directly with the cup and lay in his wisdom as until his daughter and there came a traveler this is parable form remember every parable that god would bring has an interpretation yes mistake number one david sugar went to war from the time when kings went to war amen amen and now he's relaxing at home taking a little fiesta a break and now he's just living his life and those sort of things and one night he goes up there to the old balcony of the seal the roof of his house because it was flat back in those days he could walk on it enjoy the scenery and these things and he sees a woman and you know the story but according to the parable says and there came a traveler right that's interesting unto the rich man and he's fair to take of his own flock and it was on her to dress for the wayfaring man who is this man who's the man job looking for someone to wake he's looking for someone you can take down all right right the same in joke two he says and the lord said what's coming from uh from going to and fro walking up and down it right we know in matthew 12 43 when the unclean spirit goes out of a man he walketh through privacy that's right brother good hope for yourselves and therefore under the hand of god the mighty hand of god may exalt you into time passing while you're carrying upon him before he cares for you be sober rebellious vigilance he says because your adversary the devil as the lord right lion walk is about seeking who he may devour yeah very good why was that parable like that from nathan to david because here's what took place you know these things the beautiful thing is my pastor has been working with demonology and in the book of job god had to give divine permission that's right to come down and mess with job that's right satan has to ask permission that's right amen not only he has to ask for god right so indirectly it was sent from god a test or a trial dave is on his throne sees this woman and satan himself shows up by permission of god by permission of god the man who had a heart like god's own heart pretty nice guy solid rock solid do you mind if i go and talk to him a little bit satan knowing he's out of the will of god god knowing he's not the will of god god knowing what satan's thinking says finds david in the moonlight looking hey what do you think about that they was like such a good idea a really good idea and it was ordained by god that move was ordained oh my god all right what we saw there was the total hand of god i think about spiritual let me say this my pastor brought this out if satan hasn't asked permission to deal with you did you know the devils have to ask permission look at this remember jesus goes over side of the sea there and he finds the man in the tombs and gathering right they cried a lot of voices what have i to do with thee jesus the son of the most high god i journey by god thou torment me not for he said to him come out of the man that unclean spirit and he asked and he asked them what is thy name and the answer and said my name is legion for we are many and if he saw him how much he would not send them away out of the country look every move a demon makes for satan makes has to be permission ah good an edict in heaven says he is allowed to go this afar this away not this way that way but it must be certain this way and it has to be only with this so many things it has to be in a certain way good good that is and now there was there was night unto the mountain the great herd of swine feeding and all the devils but salt and saying send us into the swine that we may enter unto them demons have to ask permission to enter i mean they just don't have free reign down here and do whatever they want everything is permission job one day uh uh satan comes up to job and god's like remember how he's the prophet dramatizes picking a fight and look at me the perfect man yo blowing my son he's i hate perfection you know that whole thing was ordained of god that's right let's bring it back satan comes up to god one day and god's like have you seen my son and daughter my children look at look at the guy i went down and playing in a garden isn't that beautiful satan for the first couple days is watching learning things looking just looking at the serpent looking at the animals look at how things work and reproduction those sort of things he popped up to god he's like hey do you mind if i uh go talk to your daughter down there say you know what he's thinking god doing the same thing sure go ahead and talk to her can or anything i just need to get i want to be able to speak to her can i hear the serpent say you know what he's thinking god don't think yes everything is planned there's not one thing out of caterpillar in your life in my life everything is for you i can't overexpress it after you realize that satan has permission this whole corona thing and the people who are working this thing these people are demons and even possessed even control so those demons had to get permission to do this world war one world war two was all permission from god believe it or not four minutes now now if we can go back to bathsheba and david and think with their spiritual thinking clamps because there was a there was a there was something going on here there was something going on as we see bathsheba on the roof here and it came to pass in the evening time then david arose from off his bed and walked up upon the walk upon the roof of the king's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself now carnal you think yeah sure but now think spiritual if david was a type of christ he saw this woman washing herself and he found it extremely attractive and the bible says in ephesians 5 verse 25 husbands love your wives jesus christ also of the church and gave them so forth that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word so david was attracted to a woman cleaning herself and keeping herself clean how much more will god almighty be attracted or be i think this be yeah be moved towards you as you wash yourself with the water of the lord listening keeping yourself keeping yourself clean amen through what the power of the holy ghost keeping yourself clean he says awake awake put on thy strength of zion put on thy beautiful garments so jerusalem uh the holy city foreign so no more come unto thee the uncircumcised and the unclean what she will be clean shake off the dust hebrews 10 22 he says let us draw near with having a high priest over the house of god notice the high priest is there let us draw near with a with a true heart and full assurance of faith having our bodies i'm sorry our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure lot if david thought that was attractive then god will find it attractive as well spiritually someone that's bathing yourself in the word of god constantly sure why is that because in revelations 19 and 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready she is not unclean but now remember when when is the time the at midnight there's a crying come on to them right the lord is coming what is this all the white and foolish or trim their lamps they cleaned up right sure yes now why is that david and bathsheba so powerful if you look at joseph's line here in matthew 1 and verse 1 the book of the generations of jesus christ this is his pure seedling these were sons of god hallelujah yes but notice the corruption what would look what would look like corruption in the scene line there's tamar lead the hardest yes there's a rahab who was a harmony right there was ruth who was a gentile right and no inheritance had nothing going for outside of what she believed what these all came into subjection to the word of god hallelujah and then we have this salmon began great temple greyhound and go on to get over that of ruth don't let me get jessie and just be at king david david the king and david begat solomon of her that had been wife of your eyes this was the seed lion of jesus christ right i'm sorry i knew that you too now he says but uh but you know i'm glad that even just a little insignificant thing in the bible means so much i believe that it was jesus that said this and that you pass over and do the way in your management law but rather pass over the little things and sometimes the little things that hold the big things together right but in all in all the great cause is turning just exactly the way god ordained them to call turn here there'll never be one visit place god hath ordained all things that must hit just exactly through that place amen amen you mean rosa you me kmart was ordained of god that's that act was ordained of god yes absolutely this rahab the harlot the scarlet threat hanging our window that was ordained of god absolutely yeah look how god used it why god was not looking at the flesh he was looking that she believed that this was god almighty amen believe in the god of the jews absolutely she would live in jehovah hallelujah sure ruth also believed and said he said uh uh uh naomi diana your god will be my god right sold out to the word of god amen god remember how jesus just met you just marveled at the faith of the gentile woman right yeah the gentiles sure but now look at this and this was joseph's law scene line matthew 1 jacob again joseph the husband of mary who was of whom was born jesus is called christ right so now that's joseph's line matthew 1 yes here the gene algae let me tell you now this is mary's genealogy and jesus himself began to be about 30 years of age being as supposed to the son of joseph or mary joseph uh joseph mary's wife who's the son of a lion goes on and on and then now look at luke 3 and which was the son of mela which was the son of mainan which is sort of the son of nathan which was the son of david yes right yes and what's so significant about these two genealogies and we see solomon come out right yes both seedlings both genealogies stem from david beyond it's david and they all traced back to david yes but both nathan and solomon were bathsheba's sons that's right both mary and joseph came from who else could solomon came from it had to come from those two yes sir yes sir god god allowed satan to come down to david at the right time exact time is when they were taking baths absolutely ordained now remember in the old testament many of the names god allowed jacob to be called jacob a deceiver a subplanter because he had to have that sort of life until he had a name right abram had to have began named abram until the time when god would change his name to abraham right those names the name of the well the name of every look at look at the first ten names in genesis adam seth those those ten names tell a story of what christ is all christ right you ever see that it means something so when i saw this and i see notice how out of bathsheba came the two sea lions that came joseph and mary yeah one woman and solomon i'm sorry and david what was so powerful about that you know what the name of bathsheba means for one hour bathsheba means the daughter of an oath right a daughter of an oath that's broke up in the two parts man that word bath means to be the apple of the eye or the branch now you're not gonna believe this the end part of bathsheba means to be complete or to seven oneself the daughter of an oath a sevenfold oath that is swear by repeating a declaration seven times and then seeing how it began with the church of ephesus and the second church age the third treasure for church age fifth church fifteen years of darkness to the the lutheran age the philadelphians down to later seeing the last age he says seeing the old testament how they briefly typed the beginning in solomon whether the first church age of the first age of the old testament church they start with solomon which was a direct descendant of extreme amen she was the daughter of a sevenfold oath and i'm gonna bring israel through seven churches and it had to start with david and besheba now remember if it started with an evil act at the end of the church ages i would have to look like anyone yes the holy ghost beat david to his wife i'm sorry joseph to his wife and it looked like a fornication to take place but it wasn't and it had to look bad because it had started man but it was all ordained that's right that's right why do you think at the end of the seven church ages of the old testament the bible says that they would come and take it by force to make him a king because they knew he was out of that line he was out of the line of judah the temple was destroyed in 70 a.d which means all these genealogies were lost so these disciples luke and matthew had to go to that church go to the house of god and dig up the genealogies to prove that christ was directly seen right yeah and they had to bring it and prove and show that it was after bathsheba too and all the way through all these that they recorded it all because it would be lost in 70 a.d and that's why when jesus come on the scene he says behold a greater than solomon is here all that temple the right of the church is what the holy ghost came down and no one could even minister that's right now remember look at the progression it started out a powerful book of acts move now into the greater works and now the very one that came down in solomon's day i think in that temple which was the emphasis of the old temple now he came down and fleshed his time and did the greater works yes sir yes sir sorry so what about our day if jesus's day was so much greater than solomon's psalm had wisdom he could found the wise can follow if the pharisees says he were there and someone's day he would he would pour them up too he would discern him exactly remember the story about solomon where bathsheba came up from i'm sorry not she but she was the the daughter of the you know she queen or whatever she come up there and i heard that there was a testimony in history where she actually tested the king and had men dressed as women to go before him and someone called right away said those are the men but now think of this jesus had to come in in laodicea of the old testament and notice the name of his mother mary it means bitterness or rebellion every one of these names means something he had to come through the most bitter and rebellious church but he was not of that but he came exponential got greater from solomon to christ what about the end of our age from the greatest words when the army that has never been in john 2 they'll never be an army like it or after before anything would be the greatest army of gentile warriors or christian wars on the face of the earth they'll do things exploits what do you think it's a change from colombia to christ was so much different we're about from christ to what we see now respect the unexpectable who would have ever imagined that a man would alter water right remember it was hard for them to understand remember the man that was born blind was there ever time from search from the beginning of the world does every man be given sight to see from the world and never management but here jesus made apostles amen walking on water walking through thin air appearing from thin air right through the wall that was this was coming what about the superior ring because remember it's a cycle from natural spiritual there's spiritual great enough this is this is gonna be so much like god he's thinking about this this is what you have to look forward to and what and god made all that possible the prophecy the entire prophecy the old testament church ages came through and god used it to start the church in fact it had to be her because her name meant that school please keep your hand on as well maybe your gentle hand lord keep us all the way into the rapture lord jesus trust [Music] lord [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you had to allow that to happen [Music] hallelujah but
