continues today it does never cease to obey the lord when you walk upon the earth in a natural body when you spoke the wind recognized that voice it humbled itself and it stopped and seized peace be still and it was stupid god i pray that you'd speak to our hearts today lord that your word would come to a heart sin that which is not at peace will be at peace lord every trial every challenge of the devil is laid before us god i pray that as we just get shut in here just for a few moments today but you'll speak lord have your way may we have no contention no difference but one focus one purpose that's on your word lord have your way do as you will in jesus christ's name amen praise the lord god bless you brother praise the lord it's good to be with you today and uh i always enjoy this kind of uh thought you know as we're together today we want to just like when you pull up to the table with family you just sort of pull up to the table and kind of get comfortable and it's time to eat i feel like that's what church services should be like that we should just be comfortable kind of let everything shake everything off we want to invite the lord to come and have his way amen let's turn if you would to um first corinthians the fifth chapter trying to get my things organized here there's corinthians the fifth chapter so when we want to read just a couple verses here verses six to eight first corinthians chapter five verses number six to eight your glorying is not good know you not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump purge out there for the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth may the lord bless the word you may have your seeds praise the lord this is uh we're gonna start here in first corinthians and just take maybe a little a little bible study if you will and and just see where the lord leads us today um this is something that's that's really being on my heart this kind of the thought has been on my heart as we go through the message we find that brother branham talks about this often about how all the little differences kind of get in among us and we could say it could be in could be in marriage it could be in the fellowship uh it could be in any could be between fellowships but what brother branham was talking about many times is how those things hinder the word of god hinder the moving of of god so we're going to take for a little subject this morning without leaven without leaven we're going to start here as we just did in first corinthians the fifth chapter and as we see the scriptures saying this is paul of course speaking to the corinthians um your glory is not good no you're not that a little leaven loving it the whole lump so a lot of times you know we as christians we we feel like you know i'm a pretty good christian right i come to church on sunday i do the right things i try to i try to do good but you know a friend in everything that we do when we compare ourselves to what god has done when what jesus christ walking up on this earth being a perfect example of what we should be when we compare ourselves to that perfect example the stature of truly a perfect man you know there is no way in ourselves if we look at ourselves without the blood of jesus christ there's no way that we can compare ourselves to god himself and say yeah we stack up pretty good and it's funny how we as a person as a human being sometimes we look in the mirror and we say you know you're pretty good but the funny thing is the only way to do that is by comparing ourselves one to another and then we compare you know i'm not what i used to be so praise the lord you know i've arrived but what god is trying to express to us is until the work is done and when the work is done means we're no longer here in this earth right god's doing a work we come to the end of that road and god translates the body the trumpet sounds and we leave until that time until that moment god is doing a work god is doing a work in us he's doing the work between us and he's pulling the body together as brother ben has said the gathering place is in jesus christ it's not in the four walls of a building it's not a particular assembly it's not a particular part of the world it's in jesus christ it's in truth it's in a genuine spirit that as we come together we begin to fellowship what is gathering us together what's pulling us together is it politics is it is it we get together and say you know we got this scripture we got the scripture you know brother what do you think about this what do you think about this that's not what does it see that's what man has done to try to put together the ideas and understand what what did god mean by this and what did god mean by that but as we pursue god and we fall in love with jesus christ from the depths of our heart genuinely not because we show up you know on sunday and everything looks right we act right that's not it friends i've seen people uh you know it's heartbreaking but i've seen people come to church faithfully for 20 years or 30 years and die in sin well brother doesn't that you know is that such a wonderful testimony it is and you know what that 30 years if they served the lord for 30 years that was the that was the power of the lord jesus christ that was doing something good in them but the bible says it's not he that runs the race it's he that endures to the end now what is the end of that person how are they judged i don't know god god tells us don't do that but what we can do is we can hold up the word and we can say that life or my life does not line up with this this is my standard it's not my neighbor it's not my brother it's not my sister it's not my husband it's not my wife it's not my sons it's not my daughters it's not my parents that's not the standard the standard is this this is the standard and as we measure ourselves to this we find that over oh you know the years go by and we've got all the things that are going on in the world and you know we get troubled by this and we get troubled by that but you know if we're so lost in in the lord jesus nothing is a surprise this is not a surprise what's going on in the world nothing is and if we have confidence that god knew from the beginning what the end was going to be that we know that god is not surprised god didn't wake up one morning and say oh i'm shocked that the world has gone into sin god knew before everything began how things would play out this time in 2020 how everything in the world the the politics are going crazy the the pandemics in the world they got politicized and all this kind of nonsense who cares who cares about what the world wants we want only one thing that's jesus christ and friend that message for us hasn't changed right as we look at god's word we look at everything that's going on and we compare it wow this is this is going on but didn't there wasn't there a voice that told us things are going to get worse isn't there a voice that told us you know what it's going to get so bad it's going to drive the bride together you know it's not a surprise nothing's a surprise so here we are today looking for god god what's next what's the next thing for me lord i'm growing i praise you lord for the victory that's been in my life but what now lord how can i grow from the place that i'm at now i want to be closer to you tomorrow than i was today lord what do i do well just just trust the lord and do nothing but you know the interesting thing is we do trust the lord we wait on god but when god came to abraham and told abraham abraham you're going to have a son oh praise the lord amen and then god came to abraham he said go off of your son god your son isaac what did abraham do you know did abraham just sit there and say well you know praise the lord hallelujah praise the lord i'm a christian god loves me god's given me a promise and i'm just going to sit here at home no abraham had a job to do you know what i said the bible says that abraham got things ready he had the wood cut he had everything he needed he had help he had everything he needed he got up early in the morning because god had told him to do something he got up early in the morning and he was in his place and he left this place why did he leave because god told him to do something he moved because god had placed something in his heart and abraham had faith that something good was going to come out of this that god's work was going to be done god's will was going to be done no matter what it looked like and by that faith abraham was justified paul said so he said abraham was justified by the faith that he had in offering isaac because that which he thought well if i do this this is gonna this is gonna harm the promise god gave me the promise and then he gave him the sun and this seems like it's a contradiction i don't know how this is gonna work out for the good abraham didn't question it he got up in the morning he said i gotta go packs everything up and he goes you know when he he gets close to where he's gonna offer his son can you imagine he's gonna offer his son isaac and he gets to this place and he tells all the men that were with him he said stay here stay here i need to go offer a sacrifice and the lad and i shall return how did abraham know they were going to return god hadn't explained all the details to him but abraham began to move based on faith because god told him and he just did it he didn't understand it all he didn't know the end of it he just began to move and as it began to move by the promise he began to move by the instruction god worked out the rest but god's grace that's where we want to be at we want god to be so much in control and that we trust god so much that when we come up to the edge of death there's no question amen you know right right now as of this morning i was about seven o'clock this morning there is a sister in our assembly that's her and her husband had faithfully been coming to church for many years she's been suffering with parkinson's it's been in a lot of discomfort pain she's first it started with with um she lost her balance and she was very shaky and she couldn't stand anymore she can barely walk she can't take care of herself and then just a couple days ago she started bleeding they believe it was an ulcer she was bleeding out of her mouth she was bleeding out they took her to toledo this was just a couple days ago i believe on wednesday thursday night they said there's nothing we can do and there's nothing we could do for for this woman uh we suggest that you just pull the plug take the iv out and just let her go quickly so i there was nothing nothing to do she's been suffering horribly so uh they made that decision we're not going to do anything if god chooses to intervene that's god what god would choose to do but we're not going to medically try to extend this out because she's miserable she's suffering on thursday night they unplugged everything she's bleeding they expect at any time she might choke to death she might anything could happen it seems and she's been suffering for a long time so she goes through the night she's bleeding from her mouth her face is swollen this is a thursday this week she's bleeding her face is swollen and her husband is so so bothered by what by being there and being with her and watching his wife suffer he steps out in the hallway begins to pray he said something to the effect of lord he was just struggling with the the difficulty of the situation he said lord you're still able you're still dog you can do anything that you choose and by that that day progressed she had continued to bleed then the bleeding stopped they'd unplugged all ivs and everything they're not doing anything to help her there's no maybe morphine i'm not sure but nothing to help her situation to get better she's bleeding out in toledo uh she lives they live in a norwalk area and they had gone to toledo to the hospital there the doctor they come in on i believe it was on would have been yesterday they come in and they said uh well she was bleeding but she's not bleeding anymore her situation is now stabilized and her husband was there with her and uh realized that she didn't have an iv and he put some water on her lips and she licked her lips she they thought she was incoherent she was gone past the point of return put some water on her lips she licked her lips and she said you want water and i asked her she said water she's she's incoherent they're not doing anything for her she says water so they give her water this is in the last two days so they give her water and then finally she continues to get stronger so they said well actually we weren't going to do surgery there is a surgery that can be done but uh you know it wasn't we couldn't do it at the time she would probably die on the operating table and now uh she's actually strong enough now we're going to send her to the cleveland clinic here in cleveland and we we think we can do the surgery so they sent her the life flighted her to cleveland this is as of this morning about 7 am and she's there now in cleveland and they said when she got there as far as i know that the bleeding has stopped completely they don't need to do surgery amen god whatever happens tomorrow what if god chooses to take her home tomorrow does that change what happened no it doesn't even the doctor came in they said you know i'm a doctor but there's a doctor greater than i and you know i i i'm going to assume we're all aware at this point it takes quite a lot for a doctor anymore to say such a thing a lot of doctors that don't have enough humility to acknowledge that they're not the greatest authority in the medical field that there's one that's set this body in order and that same god is the one the only one that can truly heal so we're praying for that trusting in the lord and everything but i want to i share that testimony and talk about abraham for this reason when we're in a situation where we don't know what the outcome is we want god to just lay it out we know every detail but faith is confidence is knowing the unseen when we don't know what's going to happen next and we have faith we have confidence in god and that confidence is telling us what's going to happen next though we have no evidence of it the only evidence that's been provided is god's word itself and you know a lot of times we're praying for some big thing well god i'm praying about this i need a vindication but paul explains to us paul explains that when we can see it when we can see evidence it's not faith faith is in the unseen and if we have confidence in god's word when we see nothing that's faith abraham began to move by faith he had no thing in front of him telling him abraham this is going to be easy he didn't have anything telling him that he believed that god's promise was going to see his son through was going to see him through and he moved on he didn't understand every detail that's faith many times we pray for things and and first of all a lot of times we we feel in the heart well lord i've prayed and i've prayed and i've prayed and nothing's happened and you know i've experienced this myself a lot of times we go back and carefully consider the things that we believe we've prayed about we prayed about you know what we we didn't ask a lot of times friends we didn't even ask god for anything all we did was whine and complain about it is that true or not true a lot of times we go to prayer we're praying oh god i got this and oh i got this sake and i got this and i got this bible says you have not because you asked them you have not because you ask them this well lord i really need a million dollars son or daughter you don't need a million dollars what you need is faith in god's word god could create money just like that if that's what he chose god can do anything he so chooses but what he's looking for in his children is confidence it's faith that no matter what my eyes tell me no matter what my ears tell me no matter what the sequence of events that i'm looking at is telling me god is able that's the baseline that's the foundation that everything is built upon and all of god's children the born into the family of god by what by birth not by signing the book not by joining the church not by attending a certain assembly jesus said unless you be born again you will in no wise see the kingdom of god it won't happen there's no alternative there's no way around it but having confidence in god's word stepping out in god's word and as we see you know all the things are going on with the election all this you know and you know the democrats really hate the christians and this and you know looks like maybe he's going to be present maybe it's not who knows what's going to happen day to day who knows exactly right and who cares the outcome is already set for them and for god's children by god's grace paul said it this way saint paul said it this way don't be shaken in your mind don't be swayed by any wind of doctrine now a lot of times we don't think about satan as having a doctrine but satan has a doctrine satan wants you to believe his doctrine as he presents it to you he wants you to believe you see this force you see this political force it's so powerful there's nothing you could do there's no way you can escape the power of everything that's going on in the world sure you can sure you can not only not only can we have confidence in god's word he said never leave us nor forsake us but the bible tells us that the time will come where god will pluck out his children in the midst of all of the chaos god will pluck out his children amen and the devil wants you to tell wants to tell you oh there's just no way there is just no way that you could ever overcome all the things that are going on in the world oh it's so big america what are you doing america for god 60 years ago 70 years ago or whatever it was what we're seeing is the outcome i heard a man say this i believe it was wisdom he said a person without god can and will believe anything unless god gets a hold of a person's mind well brother we're talking about faith isn't faith you know it's faith in the soul that's what makes a difference that's exactly right it does make the difference and you know the bible also says though you shall be transformed by the renewing of your mind that god will change your thoughts the very things you think the things you see you can look at the same situation completely different though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil praise the lord amen without leaven well brother what what what does this have to do without leaving because god wants us to be so in tune with him that there's nothing between us paul said i'm not flailing at the air he said i strive daily but there'd be nothing between god and me and me and and other men other other people there's nothing there's no leaven there's nothing to separate us what does leaven do leaven adds air it adds fluff we don't need fluff all we need is confidence we need a rock solid foundation to stand upon let's go to if we would proverbs 22 praise the lord appreciate that water up there brother praise the lord you know friends i don't know what all's coming next but i'm sure excited to see it if god will have us to be here wonderful things are in store it's a good time to be a christian amen here we are in proverbs 22. let's read verse 22. verse number 10. 22 and verse number 10 cast out the scorner and the contention shall go out yay strife and reproach shall cease let's also turn if you would to proverbs 13. we'll try to slow down here just a little bit and focus on these scriptures here if we can by god's grace proverbs 13 also proverbs 13 and 10. only by pride cometh contention but what the well advised is wisdom only by pride cometh contention so what is the only way that contention can come the only way says right here only by pride cometh contention you know a lot of times in i would i grew up in in church in a message church and i've seen so much bickering and fighting and someone could say well brother why would you say that about your assembly you think it's unique to one assembly it's not if you understand the working by god's grace understand the workings of this world anytime a human is involved anytime that that natural part of us is involved what do we get contention get a little bit lifted up you know one of the biggest things that christians will get prideful about is the size of their trials trials oh brother let me tell you about my trials oh i got this trial then oh i got this trial and speak for an hour about trials oh god is good praise the lord that's my testimony the testimony that's an hour talking about problems lifting up how how the tragedy of someone's life and then say well to god be the glory what did god do that's the testimony well i got this problem i got this problem and woe is me i got this friends i have a lot of empathy if you will a lot of empathy i i really i feel very strongly for people that are going through difficult situations but if that that person is a child of god how can we have sympathy how can we sympathize on a child of god knowing that the end that will come out the thing that will come out is god's perfection we feel bad we feel for this we feel for that and friends many times our feelings feeling bad for one another we think is god moving us and it clouds our judgment we'll get to that in a moment but i want to highlight how does this contention set in how is it that contention begins to build and before you know it you can't speak to a brother you can't speak to a sister and as brother bano says so many times you should be able to shake hands with one or disagree shake hands and feel no differently friends if we're not in that kind of state if we're not in the place where we have patience a reverence toward what god is doing in each other's lives friends we don't need to agree on everything it's not in this life friend there is we are not going to agree on every little detail brother i don't like the color of your shirt brother i believe you got to wear a white shirt behind the pulpit you know what friends i would never want to stumble anybody but if somebody has a conviction about that praise the lord then live that conviction but we get convicted about something i don't mean to call out one thing if you know somebody that feels that way i'm not trying to set a mark against a person or anything like that i want to use an example that's visible it's open i got a blue shirt on today and someone might look on that and i say well brother i believe you should only wear a white shirt i don't have anything against that if someone has a conviction about what praise the lord wear white shirt you know if i have more white shirts i wear more white shirts white shirts are very hard to keep clean i don't know if it's a lot of work trying to keep a white shirt clean but my point there friend is that we take something that to that is not from directly from god's word we make a law and if someone else doesn't obey our law then we unchristianize them that makes sense and brother brahm said don't unchristianize your brother don't unchristianize your sister pray for them strive for them encourage them you can disagree brother sister you know i don't i don't agree with this i don't i don't love you any less but but i disagree and if we can't have that kind of conversation and this is a challenge to everyone myself included but if someone disagrees we immediately we start to rise up and in that where does that come from contention we start to do this right we start to butt heads a little bit why only by pride cometh contention only only only only well brother there's times when things need to be said absolutely right and we'll get to that in just a moment see sometimes we feel like we go the other extreme well brother you know i don't want to cause contention and i disagree but i don't want to say anything i don't want to you know i don't want to offend someone so i'm just going to say nothing what does the bible say to do you see the bible we believe many times we believe the bible's good enough until it's really uncomfortable and then we don't really want to follow every word that proceeds from the mouth of god the bible says speak the truth in love but what does that mean well brother it just really needs to be said i really needed to tell that person did you know what was the outcome well you know we kind of argued about it a little bit oh contention really friends i have seen this so many times contention after contention after contention you know what it takes by god's grace to resolve it taking all of your pride put it in a ball and throw it in the corner god can have you fall on your face he can have you be humiliated whatever it takes and i've heard i've heard this said before and forgive me i don't mean to disagree with anybody case in point no me to disagree with anybody but friend i pray with my whole heart lord lord whatever it takes and i've heard people say this is what i was alluding to i've heard better people say well be careful what you pray for you know that's a hard thing why should i be careful i trust him i trust god entirely with everything i am it's the only safe place i can eat it's the only safe place where my children can be where my home can be unless are in the hands of god they're not in a safe place i will mess it up in myself if i'm not continuously saying lord help me give me more humility give me more temperance lord i need to submit myself i'm i'm getting a little bit snippy about this i'm getting a little snippy about this what is it contention comes from what pride and by god's grace the lord can weed those things out and friends the process might be painful it might be so hard that you feel like you're going to lose your mind and let me tell your friends as your your brother in christ jesus as you get down the road and you submit yourself to the lord there's going to be times where it's hard but if you submit yourself to the lord god knows exactly what he's doing he knows how to weed out of us the things that are holding on the things that are preventing us from growing god knows exactly the recipe that we need oh brother i just don't know i don't know if i can do that then let's go back to abraham what did abraham do god asked him what to what any human being would say would be a ridiculous thing go offer your son you realize that in doing so he was being a type of god himself he offered his son he did what no man thought was thinkable and here was a natural man a natural man who was not filled with the holy ghost under the blood of boozy goats here's abraham offering his sacrifice jesus christ had not come died for his sins had removed all sin there was still a gulf between god and man and here's abraham walking in with the creator my what a man to this day the three major religions in the world can all be traced back to abraham and what did abraham do he offered his son the thing that was most precious to him he offered it he said lord it's yours do with it as you will my son came by your promise you'll preserve the promise and i trust you for it for me friend this this theme of trusting god has been very personal to us i say us myself my wife my family as the lord has challenged us in many ways maybe there's a testimony for another time but when i stand here and say this friends this is not i don't say this because it sounds good i say it because it is to me the only way to survive this life and friend when i say survive i don't mean just survive as in we're just barely making it through what i mean is that if you come that way god will give you victory and it's the only way to victory and god will shelter you he will care for you even though you feel like everything is not going the way you want it to god will take care of it and we'll have it come out for the good here we are only by pride cometh contention so many times friends this is this is got in the way of for all of us everyone without exception for everyone this gets in the way of us growing with the lord growing up into the stature of a perfect man we're talking about faith but we have to add to our faith virtue add to our virtue knowledge continue to grow and this is uh brother brandon explain it like this virtue is strength you have faith and then you grow in your faith you're adding strength and then we come to knowledge sometimes people say well then it means that you have to learn a lot about the scripture you have to learn a lot about the message you got to memorize a whole bunch of scriptures no that's not that's not it that's not what the knowledge is about the knowledge faith is the unseen like we were talking about earlier faith is the unseen but when it is seen it's now knowledge i know it it's no longer faith i know it that's knowledge add to your faith virtue and add to your virtue knowledge i am now a witness let me tell you what god has done it's not because we're filled up with knowledge filled up with reasoning and trying to figure out oh brother branham said this and if i put this piece together and put this piece together oh friends i'm not downplaying how wonderful it is when god begins to quicken the word and the pieces begin to come together and it's so beautiful by divine intervention god begins to get our attention and bring the things of the message together and what do we see christ jesus the book of revelation what is many times uh many times you read in most bibles it will say the revelation of john let me just bring this to your attention you haven't noticed this before you don't have to turn there i'll just read the it's an easy way to remember this what is the book of revelation about revelation 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him who john gave it to john what's the book of right what are all these mysteries about and and you know i believe in i believe i'm being honest friends i mean truly i mean the things that we get embarrassed about the things that i bring that up a lot because a lot of times we come up to this line oh i get embarrassed i can't no i can't talk about that but when god is glorified who cares about what i feel like who cares about what everybody else feels like we want god to be glorified now we're not trying to shame one another and forgive me i don't want it to sound that way but i wanted to bring up this little testimony of this this is still going on but this man recently is going through a very difficult situation he said to another brother he said now there's no one that knows as much as i do about the message well we just diagnose what the problem is right there's only one that has that sort of character now that brother might be in all other ways perfect i don't know but there's only one that would glorify themselves only one only one nature is not god it's not god even jesus said i come to glorify the father him being the very expression of the father hear him setting an example for us i come to glorify the father not myself and any time if someone begins to glorify themselves i had a i'm sure i shared the testimony here before but when my my son benjamin was three and a half months old he was in the hospital and we had almost lost him a couple times and we come out of the hospital and this man came to me and he said he said it to like said it to me like this you know i prayed he said it like he kind of dropped something you know important i prayed what he was alluding to was that because he prayed my son was saved what character is that that's not god the bible says in all thy ways acknowledge him who jesus christ and any time someone is pulling a promotion to themselves that's not god it's very easy to see it's very easy to hear oh friends and sometimes we get so uncomfortable with it maybe someone's is he's speaking and every sentence is i i i i i i i i it's all about i and at the end of it praise the lord god is good that wasn't a testimony that was revelation of some person that was a lifting up of some person let's move along without living i'm going to read a little bit here let's go to ephesians 4 first praise the lord god is so good friends ephesians 4. we read this well not read this but mention this earlier we're just going to read verses 15 and 16 but we want to bring some balance of this we want to make sure it doesn't you know friend i don't want anyone walking away from here today saying you know brother nathaniel just said you know you should never uh you should never say anything that would offend anybody that's not what i'm saying brother nathaniel said you should always just speak the speak what you believe is truth now hold on now everything in balance as paul said let all things be done decently and in order so let's read what the purpose here is ephesians 5 15 and 16 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ let's let's pause for a moment and break that down a little bit but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things what is the purpose for speaking in love what is the purpose what is god getting what says it right here we don't have to guess jesus lost my place there for a moment but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body is fitly joined and compacted by that which every joint supply to the effectual workings in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love what is the purpose that the body will minister to the body how can the eye say to the hand i have no need of thee how can this part of the body say to the other part of the body yeah i don't need you i can do whatever i want when paul also said of the the saints from the old testament he said they they couldn't receive the promise because it wasn't time yet but they without us are not complete the body is only complete by the whole body not because one person feels they're so spiritual i can do everything i am everything there is only one that was everything only one and that one who is everything we were in him we were in him when he died on the cross if we identify with the death then we identify with the resurrection we being in christ jesus he is lifted up you know the thing is friends when we submit ourselves to the lord a lot of times people feel like oh that's weak i need to fight i need to rise up i need to fight i need to charge against the wrong oh this person's in false doctrine i need to straighten them out we can't change another person not none of us can change another person there is only one god himself but you know what he does he says now my son my daughter consecrate yourself submit yourself to my word and when i anoint your lips you will speak and things will change who gets the glory only one jesus christ well brother it came from my lips but it wasn't you i'll prove it to you a story i believe most of us would be familiar with brother branham in the woods speaks of squirrels into existence i'm sure everyone remembers this story very well known you may have noticed or maybe not but i'll point bring it to your attention when brother bannon was up on the mountain he uh he got lost the storm came in and he got lost there was a voice that came and spoke to him he said the voice that spoke to brother branham said this it is i who created the squirrels in your presence it is i who created the squirrels in your presence well brother branham was so what was this or was that but who gets the glory one who is the book of revelation about one who is the entire bible about one that's jesus christ no one else can get the glory for anything and any time contention comes in it's because pride is working and it's beginning to bring in leaven it's bringing in fluff it's bringing in air it's bringing in something that shouldn't be there and as we we can see very simply by the scripture well there's contention you know maybe it's because of this maybe it's because of that very simple why is it no because there's pride and what i've seen so many times friend i could be a witness of this that as we as we submit ourselves to the lord trust him with everything that we have we begin to humble ourselves to his will as we do that god will put you through a trial oh lord it's hard this is very hard right you're learning patience you're learning that tribulation work with patience but let it have its good work submit yourself lord i just don't know how i'm going to come through this just trust the lord and as you come through it because you will the end of solomon said the end of a thing is better than the beginning of the thing across everything the end is better than beginning why because god is doing something god is bringing out what his will is and as we submit ourselves to that we humble ourselves god takes us to trial after trial and brings a pandemic why is there pandemic because there's things that need to happen why is all this stuff going on in politics because things need to happen the world needs to descend the world needs to be destroyed in its current condition and the only way that it is going to be so is if the people are calling for destruction the people are calling oh i hate this person i hate this person i want to destroy them i want to destroy them and the world hates everything oh except for that one very important individual right me this is what everyone says everyone is wrong except for me i don't i'm not saying that today i hope it doesn't sound that way this is what people say in the world it's all about that person you hurt my feelings you did this you did this oh oh woe is me and god says when we're in the middle of a trial son daughter gird yourself and stand up that's what he said to job he said come here we need to have a conversation he had a very fatherly conversation with joel but let me point out something else job was such a special character that even the devil had to testify about job the devil had to say well you have a hedge around job he's testifying that god was doing something in the life of job that he was not able to touch in the midst of everything here is lucifer wanting to get at job and god says come on go get him and lucifer says i can i can't because you placed a hedge around him isn't that wonderful the devil can only go as far as god permits and no further in in uh in revelation it's talking about in the the opening of the series is talking about goals so far but touch not the oil and the wine in the midst of the throne a voice comes out in the midst of the four beasts what is it the throne of god says you can go this far but their mind don't go past this and the devil wants to go all the way he wants to destroy the root he wants to destroy all that god has done and god says no you can go this far and the devil will whine and complain and he'll come and talk to people and he'll say yeah but i can do what i want i can do what i want i can do what i want and there comes a voice from the throne you can only go this far and he says [Music] well i gotta do what he says i don't like it but i have to do what he says my friends it seems like a simple thing oh brother you know we need to have less pride and you know maybe we need a bicker a little bit less oh it's so much more than that friend so much more than that give me give me just a moment here brother we don't have another another adapter for this do we that's the only one we have okay that's no problem no problem we'll just leave it online i'll just read it to you i got a couple quotes here that let's sort of tie things together praise the lord everyone doing all right praise the lord you know i love any moment when we get to go after the devil you know it feels like maybe for a season it feels like you're running from the devil and trying to just trying to make it and trying to get through this or get through that but you know when it comes down to it friend the children of god do not have to be concerned about anything the devil has the only thing we need to do is focus on god's word focus on what god what god would have for us to do take one step at a time and trust god for the rest oh it seems so simple oh how could it oh brother we need something grander we need something grander but there isn't any to trust god's word entirely in the from the bottom of our feet to the top of our head from the depths of our soul to every part of our being trust god trust god trust god and what happens we get smaller he increases we get smaller he increases and as we submit himself to the lord suddenly there comes a moment where someone's dying someone's sick you go over and you speak something you you give them a hug you do something small thing then that person says what just happened something happened in me i was sick but i'm not sick anymore well i didn't do anything you didn't except submit yourself to the lord and god begins to use the vessel we use sickness because it's simple but friend sickness is not everything we get caught up in sickness and and uh and uh financial things because they they affect us in very visual open ways but god is concerned about the eternal destination of that soul and if it takes a sickness if it takes a financial destruction god will do whatever it takes to humble a person oh but brother you know lord i just don't know just trust him amen whatever it takes it's worth it because he is the righteous god i'm gonna read uh it's a little bit lengthy here it's a little easier when it's up on the screen but we'll just we'll just uh read through it here this is from all of the uh this whole excerpt here is from god's only provided place of worship in 1965. brother iran was kind of laying out the time that we're living in but also what god's purpose is what god what god is wanting to bring us to by god's grace you'll see how this fits together the lutherans under justification defeat raised it like that wesley under sanctification the pentecostals under the arms and the works and deeds and so forth had to be calvinist or had to be armenian had to be legalists but now we come to the head the capstone grace grace the capstone crime the headstone crying what grace grace pass from death and creed into a living word of the living god god's only provided plan for his age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's off of something to make it alive and seated now in heavenly places in present tense already alive and subject to every promise in the word then what does he do you being part of god's gene a part of the word other men a part of god's word seeding seated together manifest the entire body of christ because there's no leaven among you no leaven among you just the word seated in heavenly places in the door where he puts his name christ jesus no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you hold on just a minute you mean to tell me that when there's no leaven in the body that brings the fullness of the godhead bottle how significant is that to us well brother it's just a little difference it's just you know it's a little thing it's just a little tiff it's just a little bickering no leaven none no leaven nothing between one and another it doesn't mean we don't disagree well brother how can we how can we disagree but have nothing between us because what what god is speaking about what brother branham is speaking about here is a spiritual thing there is a spiritual thing where one will rise up against another and as soon as that happens it's not unity it's leaven it is this nature getting injected into the body and when there is no leaven there is nothing extra it's only god's word god steps right into that praise the lord no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you couldn't do it in luther's age couldn't do it in wesley zane couldn't do it in the pentecostal age but in the day when the son of man will be manifested revealed brought back the church together with the entire deity of god amongst his people showing the same visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on earth in the form of a prophet god o glory promised by malachi 4 promised by the rest of the scriptures where do you worship at the house of god seated in present tense heavenly places in christ jesus not future tense present now god calling us to be sitting in heavenly places the world is falling apart yes it is satan's eden yes it is but we don't have to be subject to that no leaven one with another speaking the truth in love if sin comes in speaking the truth in love but not to rise up one against another not to get puffed up in oneself and say you know i'm really gonna show this person or i'm going to get one over on someone you know brothers a lot of times we as men especially will get caught up in this in the conflict of you know i do this a little bit better we do that a little bit better brothers this is something that has to die to us has to die in us no challenge one to another speaking the truth standing on the truth but not trying to lift up one over another god is no respecter of persons it clearly says this in the scripture god has no respect for persons talk about someone who comes in dressed nicely and then there's a poor person that comes in maybe a beggar from the street uh they come in and we would treat the person that has a wealth or they're dressed nicely better than the person that has nothing and paul said don't do that how do you know what this soul is see we're judging with our eyes we're lifting up one or the other with our eyes we're we're making some judgment and in that friends there's nothing good to come from you know i pray friends that even a little time that we've had today to spend together i pray that's been encouraging to you because this little thing if you will consistently weighs upon my heart that we have no leaven i don't want leaven between myself and my wife and it requires being humble i have to go to my wife and say honey i was wrong i did this wrong i've been doing things wrong for years we we do this and we do that and i i've done things and you know i may have even shared this before but it was a kind of an awareness in my life we were driving one time and i've shared this many times but it it i really it brings me a lot of a chuckle at it now and i laugh at it now but it was really a waking moment in my life i'm driving down the road talking and when i talk i get carried away if you haven't noticed i i just i talk and i really get tired of hearing now i get tired of hearing myself talk but when i was younger i would just talk talk so i'm we're driving the road my wife and i have been married that long and i'm talking as usual you know our conversations are basically one long monologue of me talking to my wife i'm learning though i'm learning so i'm talking and my wife is very good with directions he has a very good memory so we're driving and uh i i frequently will miss a turn because i'm talking i get distracted so i'm about to miss a turn and uh sister charity said you know um this is your turn right here and to this day it pricks my heart but i snapped at her and i said i know little thing right what caused that was that because i was right not at all even if i was it still wasn't a good attitude but that moment stopped me and in that moment god just allowed me to see was like looking from a third person i heard myself say this i looked at the situation and i said how ridiculous god gave me and help me to help me where i am weak and here i am rebuking her for doing her part oh it seems simple but when we see ourselves in that light we see ourselves in the way it's just the simple things of everyday life friend a lot of times we apply the message to all these big things god wants to be in the little details the little ways that we conduct ourselves because when it's genuine from the bottom of your heart it'll be in the details it'll be in every minute every day that lesson continued i share it now because it was such a pivotal thing to me god just brought it to my attention how silly am i oh i know no i didn't know i didn't know i missed it and my wife's trying to help me and here i am snapping at her like that you know so many times we do things such as that and it's those things that god wants to get our attention he says see you've done this your entire life but it's time to grow up amen paul said when i was a child i acted as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things and sometimes we do things you know it's just kind of i pray that the lord makes it simple for you something you can apply to your life because this is so important if we and i feel like i just keep repeating myself a little bit here and forgive me if i seem to be doing that but i want to just press that point just a little bit it's in the details it's in the simplicity of every day where does contention come from pride where there is no pride there is no contention amen let's all stand in moments like these i lift up my hands [Music] in moments like i lift up my hands i lift up my hands to the lower god [Music] i love [Music] keep me true lord jesus keep me true keep me true lord jesus keep me down there's a race that i must run there are victories
