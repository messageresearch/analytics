TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 4 hair length includes footnotes 227 through 236 but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering first corinthians 11 verse 15 just like men and women having separate garments the bible teaches that men and women should also have separate distinct hair lengths scripture teaches that god requires women to keep their hair uncut and as long as genetically possible for their entire lives god asks men to keep their hair cut short when women obey the word of god and keep their hair uncut it is an honor to their husbands and to christ if men rebel against god and grow their hair out like a woman they are considered shameful in the eyes of god new testament teaching five new testament texts support men and women having separate distinct hair lengths first corinthians 11 verses 1 to 16 john 11 verses 1 and 2 john 12 verses 1 and 8 luke 7 verses 36 to 50 and revelation 9 verse 8. furthermore you cannot find a text in scripture where god asks any godly woman whether in the old or new testaments to cut or trim her hair in any way a question arises whether a woman can trim her split ends the bible-based answer is no women must not even trim their split ends contrary to the false idea that trimming split ends makes hair healthier healthy hair comes from a healthy diet and daily care scissors must not come upon any part of the hair of a faithful obedient christian woman the main text on hair length the main new testament text for teaching on hair length is first corinthians 11 verses 1 1-16 the truth about hair length has been lying in the scripture for nearly 2 000 years churches may label this text as cultural which implies that they do not have to obey its commands but they are wrong for four reasons first paul never said this text was for the corinthians only in fact verse 16 says this custom was for all the churches of god not just one second the apostle never labeled hair length as an area of liberty as he did for observing holy days eating meat and drinking wine third hair length is directly associated with god's design for male headship as verse 3 details paul says headship is a universal principle that pertains to every man not just corinthian men fourth the unchanging pattern for hair length that god has laid out through the entire canon of scripture is vindication that all christians should honor paul's teaching in verses 1 and 2 paul urged the corinthians to continue to follow his ordinances because he was taught the gospel by christ himself as validated in galatians 1 verses 11 and 12 but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ verse 3 describes the god-ordained headship for the entire universe man is head over the woman christ is head over man and god the eternal invisible spirit is head over christ this headship or order of leadership is important because it is reflected in hair length according to verses 4 through 6. hair length is a god-ordained symbol of authority or leadership verse 4 teaches that a man dishonors christ if he covers his head by letting his hair grow long as verse 14 says it is a shame for a man to have long hair then in verse 5 paul teaches that a woman dishonors her husband if she prays or prophesies with an uncovered head an uncovered head is a head that has cut or trimmed hair upon it since verse 15 says a woman's long uncut hair is given her for a covering because it is a shame for a woman to be shorn short hair or shaven all hair cut off let her be covered as verse 6 details please know that the covering of a woman is not a cap or veil as seen worn by women from amish mennonite and other sex a woman's true covering is not a man-made covering but a covering made and designed by god her uncut hair there is no scripture that says a cap or veil is given her for a covering but there is scripture that says her hair is given her for a covering verses 7 through 12 explain why women should have long hair they came out of man in the beginning and were created for the man man was created first and is the god-ordained leader of the family and church long hair on a woman is the sign of her husband's authority over her as this authority is taught throughout the bible in verses 13-16 paul asked the corinthians to judge themselves is it calmly or fit for a woman to pray to god uncovered is it fit for a woman to pray with short hair or a shaved head of course the answer is no it is not fit for a woman to pray to god with cut hair for cut hair is a sign of rebellion against the authority of her husband next paul states that nature itself teaches that long hair on a man is a shame modern science says 40 percent of all men experience baldness so we can again see the infallible truth of the bible that god allows nature to teach us that long uncut hair on a man is a shame nearly half of the men in the world go bald this should let everyone know that god does not want long hair on men verse 15 contains the plain concise truth about the head covering for a woman paul states if a woman has long hair it is a glory to her because her hair was given to her for a covering her long uncut hair is her covering not a cap or veil or any other man-made covering paul ends this portion of scripture in verse 16 by answering the question he asked in verse 13. is it fit for a woman to pray to god uncovered with short hair or a shaved head the apostle says despite some being contentious about this topic of hair length we have no such custom in other words christians paul associated with had no practice of women praying to god with short hair neither did any other of the churches of god the churches of god in the days of paul did not allow women to prophesy or pray to god with short trimmed hair nor men to pray to god with long uncut hair undoubtedly paul taught this doctrine of women having long uncut hair in every church he visited saying for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ as i teach everywhere in every church what long hair represents to god based upon the bible word covering a beautiful scripture from the old testament gives us further understanding of what long hair on a woman represents isaiah 30 verse 1 says woe to the rebellious children saith the lord that take counsel but not of me and that cover with the covering but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sin god wants us to know that a natural woman's covering or hair represents the covering of the spiritual woman or church of the lord jesus christ this means that the godly wife and the godly church both have coverings that they must maintain with their consecrated lives figure four explains this in depth figure four natural bride she has a covering which is her uncut hair first corinthians 11 verse 15 her uncut hair is a symbol that she is under the authority or leadership of her head or her husband the application for the spiritual bride is the church is covering is the spirit of god according to isaiah chapter 30 verse 1 which wrote the word of god according to second peter 1 verse 21 the presence of the covering which is the anointing of the holy ghost proves she is under the authority of her ruler christ jesus her husband the natural bride she has untrimmed uncut hair according to first corinthians 11 verses 5 and 6. she does not cut off or take away any part of her covering which is her hair the faithful bride submits to every word of her husband according to ephesians 5 verse 24. application for the spiritual bride is the church submits to and lives by every word the holy spirit wrote taking nothing away from the word according to matthew 4 verse 4 and revelation 22 verses 18 and 19. this church will not trim off parts of the bible or neglect preaching any truth of god whether society agrees with it or not for the natural bride to cut her hair is to deny god glory in her life and deny her husband honor she does not reject or cut even one hair on her head according to first corinthians 11 verses 5 and 15. the application for the spiritual bride is to reject one word of the bible is to deny christ glory in her life the true church progresses in their walk with god from glory to more glory according to second corinthians 3 verse 18 the hair of mary sister of lazarus the second and third texts describe lazarus sister mary who anointed jesus with ointment in the gospel of john now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick then took mary a pound of ointment of spike nerd very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment the greek lexicon says this pound of ointment was 12 ounces of fragrant oil mary used her hair to wipe the precious feet of jesus christ to prepare him for his burial this undeniable witness helps prove that godly women in the days of jesus did not cut their hair because it would be impossible for a woman with short hair to wash the feet of christ short bobbed hair could not wrap around the feet of jesus and act as a towel to clean and anoint those precious holy feet the forgiven woman at simon's house a fourth text is luke 7 verses 36-50 is very similar to that of john 12 3 as luke speaks of a woman which was a sinner who went into the house of simon the pharisee she must have seen how simon and his servants did not kiss jesus or wash his feet upon his entrance or anoint his head with oil being moved by her love for christ as savior the woman ceased not to kiss his feet anoint them with oil wash them with her tears of repentance and wipe them with the hairs of her head this act of love caused jesus to tell her plainly that her sins were forgiven observe again that this forgiven woman could not have wiped jesus feet with short bobbed hair she had to have long uncut hair with years of growth in order to wipe the precious feet of the lord jesus christ locust with the hair of women the fifth text is revelation 9 verse 8 and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lions this scripture helps prove that god has specific different hair lengths for men and women revelation 9 verse 8 is part of a striking portion of scripture about the tribulation period detailed in revelation 9 verses 3 through 10. under the fifth trumpet during the tribulation god will allow locusts to torment unbelievers and those who have rejected jesus christ as lord and ruler of their lives one of the physical attributes of these locusts is that they have hair as the hair of women we must ask ourselves what is the hair of women what style of hair do these locusts have society cannot define what the hair of women means as many women have short hair and look like men god's word must define what hair of women means based upon paul's teaching from first corinthians 11 verses 1 to 16 women's hair is long and uncut the tormenting locus had to have long uncut hair it seems their job is to torment the christ-rejecting people who willingly took the mark of the beast but why it seems that god may be allowing these locusts to haunt the sinners because they have refused to honor many of god's commands obviously they did not accept god's salvation the baptism of the holy ghost and even hair length these rebellious religious apostates allowed their women to bob their hair and dishonor their husbands and god's word they never taught against men growing their hair out long to look like women these false teachers and their followers took away the glory of god which was the long uncut hair from the women allowing women to cut their hair shame their husbands and ultimately christ the only description worthy of their rebellion would be ichabod for the glory of the woman and of the man god's symbol of submission and headship was taken away from the people the preachers took away truth from the people and failed to preach the entire holy bible as a result both the speakers and hearers were worthy of the wrath of god how long does god want women's hair one question that i've been asked repeatedly on my youtube channel is how long does god want my hair to be the answer is as long as your hair can grow there is no set length that god is asking women to achieve such as 12 or 24 inches god wants a woman to leave her hair uncut for the remainder of her life god designed that a woman's genetics determines exactly how long her hair will be and he is pleased if her hair is 3 inches at its full length or 6 inches or 12 inches or longer god is not asking for a specific length of hair he is only asking for uncut hair as a symbol of her full obedience to her husband old testament teaching on hair length in the old testament just as in the new you will find again the indisputable truth that god never asked a godly woman to cut her hair i conclude that paul's teaching from the new testament is in complete harmony with god's desire for hair length in the old testament god's desire for separate hair lengths for women and men remain unchanged from genesis 1 1 to revelation 22 21 some bible readers may be familiar with the nazirite vow from numbers 6 verses 1 to 21. part of this vow is for the dedicated individual a man in this case not to cut his hair for a period of time at the end of the vow he would cut his hair in this case uncut hair was a sign of total consecration or dedication to god i cannot find an example of a woman under a nazarite vow nor have i found a woman under a nazrite vow ever cutting her hair so it would seem that only men were to cut their hair at the conclusion of their nazerite vow it seems women in terms of their hair were under a lifelong nazarite vow meaning they were never to cut their hair this lifelong dedication would be in complete harmony with god's command for women's hair length in the new testament according to scripture alone god has always asked all godly women whether jewish or christian to do the same leave their hair uncut as a sign of total consecration or dedication to the plan of god for their lives all christian women are under a similar total consecration to god not to cut their hair in order to display the symbol of headship furthermore as you read deeper in the old testament there are two specific cases in which god did command the cutting of hair but it was never command given to godly jewish women such as sarah rebecca abigail esther and the like therefore these two examples do not pertain to consecrated christian women today the first example is deuteronomy 21 verses 10 through 13. moses commanded that israelite men were to have their new wives taken from captivity after war with an enemy nation shaved their own heads as part of their transition into the jewish religion and culture observe that the faithful experienced jewish women were never commanded to cut their hair in any manner the second example is jeremiah 7 verses 28-30 god was speaking to jerusalem the capital of the nation of israel and upbraided them for their disobedience rebellion and abominable acts god said cut off thine hair o jerusalem and cast it away and take up a lamentation on high places for the lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath it is difficult to tell if god was speaking literally to every man and woman or just men or just women in this case it is likely that this is simply figurative language in which god was speaking to the entire people rather than individuals one thing is for sure god told them to cut off their hair because he was rejecting and forsaking their generation due to their wickedness and abominable acts so cutting hair in this case was a sign of being rejected by god similarly a woman cutting her hair today is a shameful act and a sign that she is not submitting to her husband conclusion all the infallible bible evidence concerning hair length proves that christian men should frequently cut their hair so as not to bring shame upon themselves and their head the lord jesus christian women should let their hair grow long and uncut for the rest of their consecrated walks with the lord jesus obedience will bring honor and glory to their husbands and their spiritual husband jesus christ god never asked an obedient faithful godly jewish or christian woman to cut her hair for the sake of fashion convenience style or beauty as some women believe they can today all christian women are to have long uncut hair as a sign that they are under the headship of their husbands christ and god living by these truths will keep the covering of the anointing of the holy ghost upon us that the glory of god not depart from our homes and churches
