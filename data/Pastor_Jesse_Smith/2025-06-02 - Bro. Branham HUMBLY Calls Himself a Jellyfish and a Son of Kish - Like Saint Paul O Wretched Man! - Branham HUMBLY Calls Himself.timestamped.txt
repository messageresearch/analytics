[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] Sometimes I look at myself and think
[0:06] I've been such a jellyfish in my life. I
[0:09] have waited and missed many thousands of
[0:12] souls into the kingdom. But by God's
[0:16] grace, I ain't to keep my eye on the
[0:18] promise.
[0:21] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:23] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:25] this video is to show two quotes from
[0:27] God's prophet, brother William Mariam
[0:29] Brham, where he humbles himself and
[0:32] shares with everyone how he's a human.
[0:34] He's a sinner saved by grace. He was
[0:36] prone to make mistakes and yet he was a
[0:39] genuine prophet of God. I came across
[0:42] these two quotes recently and I thought
[0:43] I'd share them as an encouragement that
[0:46] despite our mistakes as Holy Ghost fil
[0:48] Christians. We should repent of our
[0:50] mistakes, learn from our mistakes, and
[0:52] then press on toward the mark of the
[0:53] high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[0:56] We'll start with a Bible foundation. I
[0:59] think Romans 7 is a great place to
[1:00] start. Here we have the prophet, the
[1:02] first church age messenger, St. Paul,
[1:05] and he's speaking about the war between
[1:07] his flesh and his mind. I love verse 17
[1:11] in Romans 7. Now then it is no more I
[1:14] that do it but sin that dwelleth within
[1:16] me. So Paul was able to separate the
[1:18] real person that he was which is the
[1:20] soul and the human spirit on the inside.
[1:23] The soul and spirit was the real Paul.
[1:25] The sin nature and his flesh was not the
[1:27] real Paul. He was able to separate the
[1:29] two. But of course he still had to
[1:30] repent of all the sins that his flesh
[1:32] committed. That's why Jesus said daily
[1:34] take up your cross and follow me. That's
[1:36] why Paul also said I die daily. in 1
[1:39] Corinthians chapter
[1:40] 15. Then Paul said in verse 18, I know
[1:43] that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth
[1:45] no good thing. So if that was true for
[1:47] St. Paul, that's true for brother
[1:48] Brandham. That's true for all of us by
[1:50] the grace of God. And then in verse 20,
[1:52] he said, "Now if I do that, I would
[1:56] not." In other words, if I sin, it is no
[1:58] more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth
[2:00] in
[2:01] me. And then in verse 23, he calls this
[2:04] a war against the law of his mind. In
[2:06] his mind, he wanted to always obey the
[2:09] word of God, but he would lose the
[2:10] battle. Brother Bram calls this the
[2:11] battlefield of the mind. So the law of
[2:14] the mind would war against the law of
[2:16] his members, the sin nature in his
[2:18] flesh. And when he would sin, he said,
[2:20] "I was brought into captivity," again in
[2:22] verse 23, Romans 7:23, bringing me into
[2:25] captivity to the law of sin which is in
[2:27] my members. There's times we feel
[2:30] trapped in our flesh. We feel enslaved
[2:32] to the sin in our flesh. I love verse
[2:34] 24, though. Oh wretched man that I am,
[2:36] who shall deliver me from the body of
[2:38] this death? So here Paul, a Holy
[2:40] Ghostfilled Christian who's seen Jesus,
[2:43] says he's a wretched man. And what a
[2:45] parallel to brother Brandham who had
[2:46] seen Jesus twice by vision. And as we'll
[2:49] see here, Brother Brham calls himself a
[2:51] son of Kish. Brother Brandham puts
[2:53] himself on the level of Saul, not David.
[2:57] In this quote from the rejected king,
[2:59] May 15th, 1960. But before that, Romans
[3:03] 7:25 says, "I thank God through Jesus
[3:05] Christ our Lord." So then with the mind,
[3:07] I myself serve the law of God, but with
[3:10] the flesh, the law of sin. So here we
[3:12] see every Holy Ghost-filled Christian
[3:14] has a war between the law of the mind
[3:17] and the law of the members, the sin
[3:19] nature. And we overcome through Jesus
[3:22] Christ our Lord, through repentance. And
[3:24] then when we truly repent, the anointing
[3:26] comes back upon our minds. We can bring
[3:29] our sinful bodies into subjection to the
[3:32] Holy Ghost. We yield our members to the
[3:34] Holy Ghost as Romans 7 also says. So now
[3:38] let's look at this quote from a rejected
[3:40] king 1960. This is a striking quote to
[3:43] me for a couple reasons. First, because
[3:45] this is the ninth time and the final
[3:48] time in this sermon that brother Ram
[3:49] speaks of a son of Kish. So nine times
[3:52] he talks about a son of Kish or King
[3:56] Saul who in many ways failed God. Many
[3:58] times God had to take the kingdom from
[4:00] him because of his disobedience and his
[4:02] rebellion against the Holy Ghost. But
[4:04] here this ninth time he mentions it. He
[4:06] compares it to himself. He says brother
[4:10] Ram says he can't forgive the people. He
[4:12] can't give them pardoning grace because
[4:14] he's not the Lord. He said your spirit
[4:16] will do that work Lord. There's no way
[4:18] for me to do it. I'm just a man. He
[4:21] said, "Another son of Kish." And I
[4:23] remember listening to this recently and
[4:24] I'm like, "Oh my goodness." I had to go
[4:26] back and listen. Did Brother Random just
[4:27] call himself a son of Kish? He did. And
[4:30] then he said, "But we need you, the Holy
[4:33] Spirit. God, let me be as Samuel, one
[4:35] who tells the truth of the word." So I
[4:38] don't believe Brother Random mixed his
[4:40] words here. I believe that Brother Ram
[4:41] recognized in his flesh, he was no
[4:44] better than anybody else. Just as the
[4:45] Bible said, we've all fallen short of
[4:47] the glory of God. according to Romans
[4:49] chapter
[4:50] 3. But previously in this sermon,
[4:52] brother Ram had talked about how Saul
[4:54] was a son of Kish. And then he compared
[4:56] it to even Billy Graham being a son of
[4:58] Kish, failing to take on the challenge
[5:01] from the Muslim people about miracles.
[5:04] And I trust you'll go back and search
[5:06] out those quotes. You can do that in
[5:07] your time. It'd be a great study for
[5:09] you. He also compared sons of Kish to
[5:12] seminary preachers that don't believe in
[5:14] the supernatural, the power of God. But
[5:16] here at the end, Brother Ram says,"I am
[5:18] just a son of Kish as well." Let's
[5:20] listen to the quote. And we pray today,
[5:22] Father, that these who are now asking
[5:25] for pardoning grace, that your spirit
[5:29] will do that work, Lord, there's no way
[5:33] for me to do it. I'm just a man, another
[5:36] son of
[5:39] Kish. But we need
[5:42] you, the Holy Spirit.
[5:47] God, let me be a Samuel, one who tells
[5:50] the truth of the
[5:54] word and you have vindicated it so
[5:58] far and I believe that you will continue
[6:00] as long as I stay true to you. Before
[6:03] getting to the next quote, I think it'd
[6:04] be important to see how brother Brandham
[6:06] here was humbling himself and then God
[6:08] did exalt him. Of course, brother
[6:09] Brandham said this in 1960. And then 7
[6:12] months later, Brother Brandham would
[6:13] preach the revelation of the seven
[6:15] church ages. It's a mystery that was
[6:17] revealed according to Revelation 1 20.
[6:20] The mystery of the seven golden
[6:21] candlesticks and the seven stars. So
[6:24] despite a prophet's human fail failures,
[6:27] despite being a wretched man, like Paul
[6:29] said, Brother Ram was the same, a
[6:30] wretched man, a sinner saved by grace,
[6:32] God would use him to reveal the mystery
[6:35] of the seven church ages. And then of
[6:37] course in 1963, God used brother Ram to
[6:39] reveal the seven seals. The mystery of
[6:42] the seven seals. And then of course
[6:44] there's 10 other mysteries. I believe
[6:46] that's what I wrote my 2021 book about
[6:48] that Godhead. Brother Brandham reveal
[6:51] six of them with thus sayith the Lord.
[6:53] Important ones such as the Godhead. God
[6:55] is one person not three. With thus
[6:57] sayith the Lord and then the revelation
[6:59] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost with
[7:01] thus sayith the Lord. Brother Ram told
[7:02] us in the church age book. But in
[7:05] Matthew
[7:06] 23:10-12, Jesus said, "Neither be ye
[7:08] called masters, for one is your master,
[7:10] even Christ." I see brother Brandham in
[7:12] this verse. Brother Ram never exalted
[7:13] himself as a master above anybody. But
[7:16] then he that is greatest among you shall
[7:18] be your servant. Brother Ram always
[7:20] served the people by traveling to
[7:21] minister to people by spending extra
[7:23] time in prayer lines, even recognizing
[7:26] children in the Brham tabernacle, giving
[7:28] them gifts at Christmas time,
[7:30] recognizing them, shaking their hands.
[7:32] Brother tried to make himself the
[7:34] servant of all. And then in verse 12,
[7:36] Jesus said, "Whosoever shall exalt
[7:38] himself shall be abased. And he that
[7:41] shall humble himself shall be exalted."
[7:43] So here is a good example of brother
[7:45] Random fulfilling this scripture.
[7:47] Brother Ram humbles himself and says,
[7:48] "I'm a son of Kish." Brother Ram did not
[7:51] exalted himself and say, "I'm the
[7:52] greatest preacher of all time." Like
[7:54] some message preachers have a bad habit
[7:56] of doing today. Or I'm amongst the
[7:58] greatest preachers of all time. Brother
[8:00] Brandham never said that. Brother Ram
[8:02] was humbling himself saying, "I'm a son
[8:04] of Kish." In other words, I'm a man that
[8:07] can make mistakes as well. So, let's go
[8:09] to the second quote. This is from four
[8:12] years earlier in November 25th, 1956, a
[8:16] secondhanded robe. And the context is
[8:18] Brother Ram preaching on Elijah. Brother
[8:20] Bram said, "Elijah gave Elisha a
[8:23] condition to receive his mantle." He
[8:25] said, "If you see me when I go, it'll
[8:27] come on you. There is a promise. If thou
[8:30] canst believe, all things are possible
[8:32] to them that believe. And then look what
[8:34] brother Ram says. Sometimes I look at
[8:36] myself and think I've been such a
[8:38] jellyfish in my life. So I just thought
[8:40] it was interesting and also how brother
[8:42] Ram is humbling himself and then how God
[8:44] would exalt him. God would exalt him
[8:46] throughout the rest of his ministry. And
[8:49] the reason he called himself a
[8:50] jellyfish, he said because he's waited
[8:52] and missed many thousands of souls into
[8:54] the kingdom because he waited and said,
[8:56] "God, depending too much on a spiritual
[8:59] gift and said, Lord, if you'll just show
[9:01] me and if you'll give me a vision, what
[9:02] to do?" And God, give me the vision,
[9:05] then I'll turn around, let somebody talk
[9:07] me into something else. And oh, I have
[9:09] never come to that spot yet until like I
[9:13] have at this time that I feel it's a
[9:14] faith that we must step out there
[9:16] because it's a promise and the things
[9:18] that he has done and the healings that
[9:20] he has performed and the miracles even
[9:21] so much as come down and have his
[9:23] picture taken by the side of us and so
[9:25] forth which has never been known since
[9:27] the world began and then stand around
[9:29] like a jellyfish again. So twice he
[9:32] calls himself a jellyfish. It even makes
[9:34] me discouraged with myself. It's time to
[9:37] keep your eye on the promise. And that's
[9:38] what by God's grace I aim to do. And I
[9:42] realize that every devil of hell will
[9:43] shoot at me. But by God's grace, I aim
[9:45] to keep my eye on the promise." End
[9:48] quote. So again, another example of
[9:50] brother Brandham humbling himself. He
[9:51] wasn't exalting himself. He was humbling
[9:53] himself. Now I've speculated. I just
[9:55] thought maybe he's talking about the
[9:56] 1951 trip to South Africa where he took
[10:00] the denominational itinerary rather than
[10:03] the itinerary of the angel of the Lord.
[10:06] Maybe he's talking about that experience
[10:07] as losing many thousands of souls. I
[10:09] don't know. I'm just guessing. But yeah,
[10:12] brother Brandham said it anyway. So
[10:14] again, friends, let's enjoy this quote
[10:16] as brother Bram humbles himself as a
[10:17] true man of God. If we humble ourselves,
[10:19] we'll be exalted. Let's listen to the
[10:21] quote. Elijah, give him a condition. If
[10:24] you see me when I go, it'll come on you.
[10:28] There's the promise. If thou canst
[10:31] believe, all things are possible to them
[10:35] that believe.
[10:37] Sometimes I look at myself and think,
[10:40] I've been such a jellyfish in my life. I
[10:43] have waited and missed many thousands of
[10:46] souls into the kingdom because I've
[10:49] waited and said God depended too much on
[10:52] a spiritual gift and said Lord if you'll
[10:55] just show me if you'll give me a vision
[10:58] what to do and God gives a vision then
[11:01] I'll turn around and let somebody talk
[11:03] me into something else and oh I have
[11:07] never come to the spot yet until I like
[11:11] I have at this time that I feel it's a
[11:15] faith that we must step out there
[11:18] because it's a promise and the things
[11:21] that he has done and the healings that
[11:23] he has performed and the miracles in so
[11:26] much has come down and have his picture
[11:28] taken by the title and so forth which
[11:30] has never been known that the world
[11:32] began and then stand around like a
[11:36] jellyfish. It even makes me discouraged
[11:38] with myself. It's time to keep your eye
[11:42] on the promise. Amen. That's what by
[11:44] God's grace I aim to do. And I realize
[11:47] that every devil of hell will shoot at
[11:49] it. But by God's grace, I aim to keep my
[11:52] eye on the promise.
[11:55] I think I'll share one more quote here
[11:56] by God's grace. But this is a quote that
[11:58] constantly pops up in my mind uh from
[12:00] the seventh seal 1963. Brother Brandham
[12:03] said at the conclusion of preaching
[12:05] these revelations from the Lord Jesus
[12:08] Christ, he says, "We want to be gems in
[12:11] the crown of Jesus Christ. We don't want
[12:13] never put a man in it. You forget
[12:16] anything about me. I'm your brother, a
[12:18] sinner saved by grace, not fit to live."
[12:20] And that's the phrase that I often get
[12:22] my mind. Brother Ram says, "I'm not fit
[12:24] to live." That's exactly the truth. I
[12:26] ain't saying that to be humble. That's
[12:28] the facts. There's nothing in me, not
[12:30] one sound thing at all. but by the grace
[12:33] of God has let my poor dimming eyes look
[12:35] beyond the curtain of time and see those
[12:37] things back
[12:38] yonder. So here after getting all the
[12:41] revelations of the seven seals getting
[12:43] visited every day by the angel of the
[12:44] Lord the Holy Spirit brother Ram says
[12:47] it's I'm not fit to live. Don't put a
[12:50] human in it. Has nothing to do with a
[12:51] human. It's God fulfilling his word. And
[12:54] this reminds me now going getting back
[12:56] to the rejected king. That was the first
[12:58] sermon where brother Random shared his
[13:00] experience of going beyond the curtain
[13:01] of time. And how many people have had
[13:03] that experience? Very very few. Right?
[13:06] We know St. Paul had that experience. He
[13:07] told us about that in 2 Corinthians
[13:08] chapter 12 getting up to the third
[13:10] heaven which he couldn't even utter. He
[13:12] wasn't allowed to utter it. But here
[13:14] brother Brandham gets to go beyond the
[13:15] curtain of time. We'd say the sixth
[13:17] dimension perhaps. And even after
[13:20] telling how he was privileged to go
[13:21] beyond the curtain of time, brother Ram
[13:23] still comes back and says I am a son of
[13:26] Kish. In other words, I'm not worthy.
[13:27] This is God's doing. I'm just a brother,
[13:30] a sinner saved by grace. So let's listen
[13:32] to this quote from the seventh seal. May
[13:35] you always bear that in mind to be a gem
[13:38] in the crown of Jesus Christ. Paul said
[13:41] to the church, you are you are the
[13:43] jewels or gems of his crown. We want to
[13:46] be the gems of the crown of Jesus
[13:48] Christ. We don't want never put a man in
[13:51] it. You forget anything about me. I am
[13:54] your brother, a sinner saved by grace.
[13:58] Not fit to live. That's exactly the
[14:01] truth. I stand to be humble. That's
[14:03] facts. There's nothing in me, not one
[14:06] sound thing at all. But the grace of God
[14:10] has let my poor dimming eyes look beyond
[14:14] the curtain of power and see those
[14:16] things on earth. And I come back. In
[14:19] closing, friends, hope this video was a
[14:21] blessing by the grace of God. It was
[14:23] just fresh and encouraging to me to come
[14:26] across these two quotes about being a
[14:28] son of Kish and then acting like a
[14:30] jellyfish, not having the backbone
[14:32] needed. And I think that's very helpful
[14:35] to see that sometimes even as
[14:36] Christians, God can tell us exactly what
[14:38] to do, but then we'll still disobey it.
[14:40] Like brother Ram said in the quote about
[14:42] the jellyfish from a secondhanded robe
[14:45] 1957. Notice that brother Ram asked for
[14:48] a vision. God gave him the vision, told
[14:50] him what to do, and then still he
[14:52] disobeyed. This again highlights the
[14:54] grace of God. Like Paul said in Romans
[14:57] 7, good and evil will be present with
[14:59] me, but then I'll choose the evil. He
[15:01] says, "Oh, wretched man that I am." So,
[15:03] I hope this encourages you today to
[15:05] confess any sins and have real godly
[15:08] sorrow, not worldly sorrow, but godly
[15:10] sorrow that leads to obedience and
[15:12] taking revenge upon the enemy according
[15:15] to the book of 2 Corinthians. And just
[15:17] remember, if God's grace extended to St.
[15:19] Paul, then it no doubt extended to
[15:21] brother Brandham, and then no doubt
[15:22] it'll extend to you as well. We're all
[15:25] saved by grace through faith. And God is
[15:28] rich in mercy. His mercies are new this
[15:31] morning. If you have any questions or
[15:33] concerns about this video, please
[15:34] contact
[15:36] me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ
[15:39] be the desire of your
[15:41] heart. Very happy to be here this
[15:43] afternoon and again in defense of the
[15:45] gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good
[15:48] tidings, the good news that Jesus raised
[15:51] from the dead, living among man today,
[15:53] his church. The same Jesus that was
[15:56] yesterday will be today and
[15:59] forever. He never failed.
