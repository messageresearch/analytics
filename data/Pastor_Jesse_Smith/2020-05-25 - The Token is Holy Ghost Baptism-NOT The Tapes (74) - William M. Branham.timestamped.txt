[0:06] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:11] this video is to show that William
[0:13] Branham taught the token was the Holy
[0:16] Ghost and not his tapes I humbly have to
[0:21] disagree with the tape church movement
[0:23] that says the token is two things it is
[0:27] not they falsely claimed brother
[0:30] branham's tapes are the token and the
[0:32] state of being a tape Church is the
[0:34] token here's the outline for this video
[0:39] first gratitude to God for the token and
[0:42] reminder that I've reached out in love
[0:44] to leadership in jeffersonville second
[0:47] will define the token which is the sea
[0:50] of the Holy Ghost by the Bible and a few
[0:53] brother random quotes third we'll look
[0:57] at three of the tape churches false
[0:59] teachings and misinterpretations about
[1:02] the token fourth we'll look at more
[1:06] brother random quotes on the token being
[1:08] the holy ghost and not his tapes
[1:12] gratitude as I did in the absolute video
[1:16] I also want to express my gratitude to
[1:19] the Lord Jesus Christ for the token the
[1:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23] I was not raised in brother branham's
[1:26] message but as soon as I heard it I
[1:28] rejoiced believed it and saw Jesus
[1:31] Christ transform my life by his literal
[1:35] life I'm grateful for brother branham's
[1:38] role as a genuine prophet to preach on
[1:40] the token and point us to the token as
[1:43] he said truly as we listen to his tapes
[1:46] we can see brother branham's life
[1:48] displayed God's token the baptism of the
[1:51] Holy Ghost but the tapes are not the
[1:54] token nor are the tapes the absolute the
[1:57] Holy Ghost baptism is the token and
[1:59] Jesus Christ is the absolute so again
[2:03] just like the two previous videos have
[2:06] proven the tape church movement is
[2:08] saying numerous false teachings that
[2:10] brother Branham never said brother
[2:12] Branham never said his every word was
[2:15] the
[2:15] saith the Lord brother random never said
[2:18] that tapes were the absolute and brother
[2:21] branham never said the tapes were the
[2:23] token again I believe brother Branham
[2:27] was a genuine prophet of God whose
[2:28] ministry fulfilled revelation 10 7
[2:31] Malachi 4 5 & 6 Luke 17 30 Matthew 17 11
[2:37] acts 3 21 and revelation 3:14 this video
[2:42] is the fourth in a series aimed at
[2:44] rightly dividing the word of truth
[2:46] regarding 7 false teachings coming from
[2:49] the Jeffersonville Indiana Tape church
[2:52] movement you can view the other videos
[2:55] on my youtube channel
[2:56] they're called overview video the 7
[2:59] false teachings of Jeffersonville tape
[3:01] church movement the 2nd one is called
[3:05] not every word William Branham said was
[3:07] thus saith the Lord and the third one is
[3:10] called William branham's absolute was
[3:12] Jesus Christ not his tapes again I've
[3:18] reached out to Jeffersonville in love
[3:20] and humility sending them letters emails
[3:23] free copies of my book and even made a
[3:26] private youtube video just for them I
[3:29] received two letters back and recently I
[3:31] received another email but it seems
[3:34] they're not willing to receive my Bible
[3:36] base correction nor the correction from
[3:38] brother branham's own tapes so I will
[3:41] pray for them and hope for a speedy
[3:42] repentance in which they will publicly
[3:45] acknowledge their false teachings and
[3:47] teach only the truth of God's Holy Word
[3:52] let's define the token by the Bible and
[3:56] God's prophet brother Branham here the
[3:59] scriptures brother Adam cites for the
[4:01] token and please notice he never says my
[4:04] tapes are the token the scriptures are
[4:08] acts 1 verse 5 and acts 2:38 Ephesians
[4:13] 4:30
[4:13] 1st Corinthians 12 verse 13 mark 16 17
[4:19] and 18 and first John 3:9 acts 1 verse 5
[4:24] for John truly baptized with water but
[4:27] ye shall be baptized with
[4:29] the Holy Ghost not many days hence acts
[4:32] 2:38 then Peter said unto them repent
[4:34] and be baptized every one of you in the
[4:37] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[4:39] of sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[4:42] the Holy Ghost listen as these quotes
[4:45] prove brother Adam taught these
[4:47] scriptures spoke of the token the
[4:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[4:58] [Music]
[5:07] that was a theme of ever apostle that
[5:10] was I have you receive the Holy Father
[5:16] in this your sins and you shall receive
[5:18] this gift of the Holy Ghost more as a
[5:20] token
[5:22] next brother branham uses Ephesians 4:32
[5:26] say the token is the sea of the Holy
[5:28] Ghost and grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[5:31] God whereby ye are sealed unto the day
[5:34] of redemption we accept his sacrificed
[5:39] blood that he gave his life the token
[5:42] seal of the Holy Ghost
[5:43] is our promise Ephesians 4:30 Siegfried
[5:47] not the Holy Spirit of God or by your
[5:49] seal until the day of your Redemption
[5:52] brother branham uses first Corinthians
[5:55] 12:13
[5:56] to say the token is the baptism of the
[5:58] one Holy Spirit for by one spirit are we
[6:02] all baptized into one body whether we be
[6:04] Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or
[6:07] free and have been all made to drink
[6:10] into one spirit one spirit all baptized
[6:20] into one body and made for takers of his
[6:23] glory or are left home march down to the
[6:27] promised land
[6:30] brother branham uses mark 16 verses 17
[6:33] and 18 to call the token the seal and
[6:36] then it manifests its life through
[6:38] supernatural works in the life of the
[6:41] worshiper and these signs shall follow
[6:44] them that believe in my name shall they
[6:46] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[6:48] new tongues they shall take up serpents
[6:51] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[6:53] shall not hurt them they shall lay hands
[6:56] on the sick and they shall recover
[7:04] [Music]
[7:13] [Music]
[7:19] preach the gospel to every creature he
[7:22] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[7:24] even believeth not shall be damned and
[7:33] that God has accepted the worshiper or
[7:37] the spirit of life that was in Christ
[7:39] comes upon the worshiper
[7:43] lastly brother random quotes first John
[7:46] 3:9 to say the token is the spiritual
[7:49] seed of God whosoever's born of God does
[7:53] not commit sin for his seed remaineth
[7:56] in him and he cannot sin because he is
[7:59] born of God
[8:02] Selah promise Ephesians 4:30 says greed
[8:05] not the Holy Ghost of God for by your
[8:08] sealed until the day of your redemption
[8:11] not to the next revival until the day of
[8:15] your redemption being baptized into the
[8:18] court in first Corinthians 12 and in him
[8:21] is the fullest and no sin is recognized
[8:24] in him is born of God doesn't commit
[8:27] sins see the God remains in it he cannot
[8:29] sin how can he one of their tokens their
[8:31] their token is a sign he's been accepted
[8:36] where is the token as part of the
[8:39] definition of the token we must know
[8:42] where the token is what's the location
[8:44] of the token friends is the token in
[8:48] jeffersonville is it inside my phone as
[8:52] my mp3 files is it on my bookshelf or my
[8:57] desk in the form of brother randoms
[9:00] sermon books no all these are false
[9:02] teachings the token is located in the
[9:05] soul of the Holy Ghost filled Christian
[9:08] as brother Branham taught friends the
[9:11] token is inside a true believer not
[9:14] outside a believer listen to brother
[9:17] Branham explain it through these quotes
[9:39] Peters to the word brings God that were
[9:43] eternal in you and that is the token
[9:47] when the word is in you it's Christ in
[9:49] you that is it cannot perish sadly a lot
[9:54] of plays over it's a token days or
[9:58] that's not a body these or that soul
[10:00] that person there's a token or they're
[10:03] the Holy Spirit that is longs to God
[10:08] three misinterpretations or false
[10:11] doctrines of the Jeffersonville tape
[10:14] church movement here are three exact
[10:17] quotes from the leadership at Branham
[10:20] Tabernacle making these false claims
[10:22] which I have audio copies of and I quote
[10:27] they referring to preachers got to catch
[10:30] the vision you got to play the tapes
[10:32] you've got to Amen they're the token
[10:37] friends with all due respect this
[10:40] statement is wrong on multiple levels
[10:43] based upon brother Graham's quotes
[10:45] you've already heard the tapes cannot be
[10:48] the token because first the token is
[10:50] inside you and the tapes are outside you
[10:54] second the token is a spirit the Holy
[10:58] Spirit
[10:58] so the token is spiritual while the
[11:01] tapes are natural and third brother
[11:05] Branham said you can believe all of his
[11:07] words on tape and still not have the
[11:10] token according to these quotes the very
[11:35] life that was in Christ
[11:44] friends brother Branham says you can
[11:46] listen to his tapes and not have the
[11:48] token doesn't have the quickening power
[11:57] in you the sun is shining off you set
[12:01] this Tabernacle you listen to tape and
[12:04] yet the spirit is never quitting you so
[12:06] you can follow the Word of God thank you
[12:09] winning humans could obey every word
[12:11] that he's written
[12:15] the fourth point is very important
[12:17] brother branham's vision for the future
[12:19] was not playing tapes to replace
[12:22] preachers as the tape church movement
[12:24] teaches the jeffersonville movement is
[12:28] wrong about their vision because it does
[12:31] not match brother branham's vision
[12:33] you'll soon hear brother branham's own
[12:35] words about his vision for preachers to
[12:38] preach and teach new converts from his
[12:42] sermon taking sides with Jesus in June
[12:44] of 1962 friend's brother random told us
[12:49] his vision but jeffersonville is working
[12:52] against brother branham's vision by
[12:54] shutting down or limiting preachers
[12:56] telling them to preach less or not at
[12:59] all
[12:59] but brother Branham said we need more
[13:01] preachers listen as brother Branham
[13:04] tells us his true vision for the future
[13:07] was to continue the Apostolic pattern or
[13:10] early church pattern of preachers
[13:13] gaining new converts and then sending in
[13:16] pastors and teachers to teach the new
[13:18] converts just as Paul gave the same
[13:21] example in the book of Acts now we're
[13:27] going to start off with the early church
[13:29] and just bring it for about five minutes
[13:32] now down to what they did and then I can
[13:34] show you the vision that I have for the
[13:36] future the churches of those days like
[13:42] in Asia Minor all throughout Europe they
[13:47] didn't believe that message and when he
[13:50] had preached the message and many was
[13:54] converted to it then there was no one if
[13:59] the less of people in that condition did
[14:01] wonder right back out into their pagan
[14:03] gods and into Judaism and whatever more
[14:05] because that people had no one to teach
[14:08] them the converse they had no place to
[14:12] go so Paul established churches in
[14:16] different parts of the country each one
[14:19] of these churches he left someone who
[14:22] was an order or man that was trustworthy
[14:27] a man was known as a pastor Shepard are
[14:33] then actory this church then become
[14:38] other little churches come out of it
[14:41] young man and old man raised up and
[14:43] become churches out of that the man that
[14:46] was over the first church was called the
[14:50] bishop and then his that went out from
[14:54] him his children was called Shepherds
[14:58] our pastors and then this group of
[15:01] little churches all would come back to
[15:04] this Bishop like in the time of Arminius
[15:07] he carried on the same thing Martin
[15:10] Carroll on the same thing Polycarp
[15:13] Carolyn the same thing right on down to
[15:15] the age they had that and then the
[15:19] apostle of the church the Apostle that
[15:22] was the Paul and when Paul death John
[15:27] took over the church and when John left
[15:32] Polycarp take it over when Pollock heart
[15:35] left Irene has taken over
[15:38] and long down on Martin and so forth
[15:43] notice brother branham's vision is a
[15:45] scriptural vision because it lines up
[15:47] with acts 14:23 Titus 1:5 and 2nd
[15:52] Timothy 2:2 and when they had ordained
[15:55] them elders in every Church and had
[15:57] prayed with fasting they commended them
[15:59] to the Lord on whom they believed for
[16:02] this cause left IV and Crete that thou
[16:05] should have set in order the things that
[16:06] are wanting and ordain elders in every
[16:09] city as I had appointed thee and the
[16:12] things that thou has heard of me among
[16:15] many witnesses the same commit thou to
[16:17] faithful men who shall be able to teach
[16:20] others also
[16:22] then brother branham explains the same
[16:25] early church pattern for his own
[16:28] ministry with this message these people
[16:35] maybe you have thousands of them stay
[16:38] there for a week or two and they see the
[16:40] ministry they love it they believe it's
[16:41] a truth that come out of heathenism what
[16:45] if I had a group of name young man
[16:47] trained in the message this say now wait
[16:52] a minute before I leave here we're going
[16:57] to set an order these churches had
[17:00] already telegram and they got the money
[17:02] they're on the road here right now to
[17:05] take over this our good name is two or
[17:09] three young men living we will be his
[17:11] helpers and assistants and a church of
[17:14] this faith can be sit there which will
[17:16] be a post in India a post in Germany
[17:20] outpost in Switzerland well right now we
[17:24] should had an all around the nations
[17:26] where I've been and I'm this event from
[17:29] there comes another from another comes
[17:31] another so according to these quotes
[17:35] from taking sides with Jesus you can
[17:37] clearly see God's system according to
[17:40] brother Branham was established by Paul
[17:43] starting churches and ordaining
[17:45] preachers over those churches brother
[17:49] Branham said that's God's system it was
[17:51] God's Way back there and it's God's Way
[17:54] now
[17:56] you got to get it a system god system
[18:00] like Jethro said to Moses why you can't
[18:04] beat out all of them or and God put
[18:07] elders out there
[18:10] that's the way that was God's way back
[18:13] there that was God's Way in the in the
[18:16] early church eh and I believe it's God's
[18:18] Way back
[18:21] brother branham said to train the young
[18:23] ministers in the deeper teachings of God
[18:25] so they will be prepared to preach and
[18:28] teach others later and then in their get
[18:33] training in your own groups other
[18:35] ministers man that you see that has a
[18:38] calling in their life for the ministry
[18:40] dream them young man bring him in here
[18:43] to the elder all that is set together in
[18:45] a ministerial meeting and their teach
[18:48] the deeper things for God don't go on
[18:50] the bat in if you get the preacher
[18:54] straight to him going right look what
[18:55] he's going to do he's going to influenza
[18:57] it would take care of the hundreds of
[19:00] these things that's it we're just
[19:01] beating that you see you got to get it a
[19:04] system God's system
[19:07] so the tape church movement has the
[19:10] wrong vision it does not match brother
[19:13] branham's vision and then brother
[19:16] Branham says to carry on his vision
[19:18] which is continuing Paul's apostolic
[19:21] pattern of preachers overseeing churches
[19:25] and preachers training younger preachers
[19:28] until Jesus comes he never said to stop
[19:32] preaching and play the tapes so the tape
[19:35] church movement is trying to change
[19:37] brother branham's vision or ignore it
[19:44] that's carry this on just as we have
[19:48] that's just the way it is I'm grateful
[19:51] for these young ministers see I see at
[19:54] the day of judgment or this entire
[19:57] valleys to your there'll be no excuse
[19:59] because we've got little churches
[20:01] setting out everywhere outpost listening
[20:06] post waiting and I think that's the
[20:11] thing to do keep on carrying on until
[20:14] Jesus comes and that's what I wanted to
[20:17] say in that matter
[20:20] nine months later after he preached
[20:23] taking sides with Jesus in March of 1963
[20:27] brother Branham said to continue
[20:29] preaching and evangelizing in the same
[20:32] apostolic pattern brother Branham never
[20:35] taught them to play the tapes and stop
[20:38] or limit preaching notice now the next
[20:42] question should evangelist continue on
[20:46] the field in this hour of course what to
[20:50] mean certainly by all means don't change
[20:54] the thing if Jesus is coming in the
[20:57] morning preach today like of his Bobby
[20:59] tenure someday but live life's go be a
[21:01] design don't don't get screwed up now
[21:05] that's what I'm trying to warn you about
[21:06] see just don't be odd for cure don't
[21:10] change daily but if you're doing
[21:11] something wrong or doing evil repent
[21:14] come back to God and continue on your
[21:17] evangelistic service just as you always
[21:19] did
[21:21] then again in August of 1964 brother
[21:25] branham support of this same apostolic
[21:27] pattern in questions and answers part
[21:30] three brother Branham is it true that no
[21:35] one should preach but you we have seen
[21:41] your we have seen you our Dane man we do
[21:47] don't believe you would do that if there
[21:50] were not that they were not to preach
[21:54] mercy brother sister who told you - no
[21:58] boys preached for the hot sure via four
[22:00] subjects Agathon's
[22:01] with all that no every man feels the
[22:05] call of God upon his life get into the
[22:08] ministry start preaching we need them
[22:11] man of God are anointed all over the
[22:13] world to preach the gospel I'm just one
[22:16] little pebble on the beach
[22:18] among many big stones so there's this
[22:22] many this more eligible more worthy more
[22:26] of anything to preach than me
[22:28] I'm just one little humble person laying
[22:32] here on one grain of wheat in a hole
[22:34] garner see so it's just you know what I
[22:37] mean any man it's cold or God needs to
[22:40] preach the gospel
[22:44] friends listen how highly brother
[22:46] branham esteemed preachers who could
[22:48] rightly divide the word of truth
[22:50] it's so sad many in the tape church
[22:53] movement disagree with brother Branham
[22:55] on this point anything the preachers a
[23:16] man who knew rightly divide the word of
[23:19] God the most wonderful gift in the world
[23:22] is to be a minister which is a which was
[23:25] the New Testament modern-day prophet a
[23:27] preacher
[23:31] and notice Paul says the same thing
[23:34] about giving preachers double honor
[23:36] especially those who labor in the word
[23:39] and in doctrine first Timothy 5 7 says
[23:43] let the elders that rule well be counted
[23:46] worthy of double honor especially they
[23:48] who labor in the word and doctrine a
[23:53] second false teaching from the
[23:55] leadership at Branham tabernacle is and
[23:58] I quote she speaking of Rahab had to
[24:02] show her token she said I'm a tape
[24:05] church that's the token I'd say it's
[24:08] real important to say that were taped
[24:10] church again this cannot be the token
[24:14] because the token is inside one
[24:17] individual believer in their soul the
[24:21] token is not a building where people
[24:23] gather or a home where people gather
[24:27] friend just because a person says I'm
[24:30] part of a tape church doesn't mean they
[24:32] are born-again remember brother Branham
[24:34] said you can believe every word on his
[24:36] tapes and still not be born again just
[24:40] through these first two
[24:41] misinterpretations from the tape church
[24:43] movement you can see that they have
[24:46] essentially committed the same mistake
[24:48] as Pentecostals who make speaking in
[24:50] tongues the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[24:52] baptism which is a carnal evidence that
[24:55] can be easily impersonated catch this
[24:58] friends instead of tongues as the
[25:01] evidence now tapes are the evidence
[25:03] according to this false teaching from
[25:06] the tape church movement owning brother
[25:09] randoms tapes as a collection of mp3
[25:11] files and playing brother Rams tapes in
[25:14] your sunday church gathering is not the
[25:16] evidence of being born again these are
[25:19] two fleshly carnal evidences for being
[25:21] born-again that can be easily
[25:23] impersonated proving they're not the
[25:26] token thirdly leadership at
[25:31] jeffersonville uses the following quote
[25:33] to say the tapes are the token because
[25:36] brother Branham says the token is the
[25:38] message of the hour
[25:53] but again they failed to catch brother
[25:56] branham statement a few paragraphs
[25:58] beforehand when he says the token is the
[26:01] Covenant of the Holy Spirit
[26:19] so again the tape church movement is
[26:22] misinterpreting the quotes of brother
[26:24] Branham so according to this quote the
[26:27] message of the hour is not every word he
[26:29] said on the tapes but it's receiving the
[26:32] Covenant of the baptism of the holy
[26:34] ghost friends this is what
[26:37] Jeffersonville is failing to do they do
[26:40] not rightly divide the quotes of brother
[26:43] Branham nor God's Word it's true we
[26:47] won't know everything in this life but
[26:49] on simple questions like what is the
[26:51] token or what is the absolute surely God
[26:54] wants us to know the truth about it and
[26:56] he has clearly showed it to us and it is
[26:59] not what Jeffersonville says it is God
[27:03] has let us know the true meaning behind
[27:05] the token we just have to press play and
[27:08] when you do you find the tapes are not
[27:10] the absolute because Jesus is nor our
[27:14] tapes the token because the Holy Ghost
[27:16] is and when you press play you find
[27:19] brother Branham saying we need more
[27:21] preachers like all their false doctrines
[27:24] around the message they always start
[27:27] with groups who major too much on one or
[27:30] two quotes as they fail to rightly
[27:32] divide the quotes with other quotes and
[27:35] with the Word of God more brother random
[27:40] quotes on the token the baptism of the
[27:43] Holy Ghost please listen to the
[27:46] following statements and you'll see what
[27:48] brother Branham meant by the token it is
[27:50] the Holy Ghost
[28:11] we are living in the shadows and the
[28:15] wrath is ready to strike God's requiring
[28:18] a token that you yourself have received
[28:24] his token the Holy Ghost it's the only
[28:30] way and the only sign that God never
[28:33] passed a call it is the literal life of
[28:36] Jesus Christ returned back into the
[28:38] believer that's the way it has to be
[28:42] with every believer today feel with the
[28:45] Holy Ghost a token that the shed blood
[28:49] of the Lamb that life that was in the
[28:52] lamb has returned back and is publicly
[28:55] sealed in there but everybody passing by
[28:58] talking to you has any associates when
[29:01] you see that the blood has been applied
[29:04] and a token of the life that was in that
[29:06] blood is upon you
[29:09] and the substitute a life of Jesus
[29:13] Christ has to come into you which is the
[29:15] Holy Ghost God's token that you have
[29:18] accepted the blood of His Son Jesus
[29:20] Christ
[29:23] that come from the body of our Lord
[29:25] Jesus Christ water blood and light and
[29:29] the whole church the bride together has
[29:31] been made up to justification
[29:32] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[29:37] Ghost which is the token is Hebrews 11
[29:40] says
[29:41] there's going to be there all because
[29:44] they're going to be there each one of
[29:46] them one with the other the water veins
[29:49] the blood age and now the token age of
[29:52] the Holy Ghost now the very spirited
[29:57] self as a token the Holy Spirit itself
[30:01] is the token not the blood
[30:04] the tokens got to be displayed when I
[30:08] see the Blood I will pass over you
[30:12] nothing else would work it must be the
[30:16] blood now the Holy Ghost is our token
[30:19] from God

[30:25] tomorrow
[30:26] Jericho Egypt they won't see me no more
[30:30] yet you shall see me for ah ah the
[30:35] personal pronouns always referred to be
[30:38] with you
[30:39] I am the Tolkien my resurrection is the
[30:42] token I works that I do will identify
[30:46] you well identify me in you without
[30:52] being in that we become part of the word
[30:54] and I take the token the spirit over the
[30:57] promise
[31:00] and they they be filled with the holy
[31:05] spirit and display the token of the life
[31:08] of Jesus Christ in his resurrection as

[31:33] token all it's inside of it must be
[31:36] covered by the token and the house of
[31:39] God is the body of Jesus Christ and not
[31:42] one spirit we're all baptized and you'll
[31:45] just token and become part of it that
[31:47] God said when I see this token displayed
[31:50] I'll pass over we cannot feel safe until
[31:57] this token is this plain dying
[32:00] you must come under this token God's
[32:02] holy spirit and it displays to you Jesus
[32:07] Christ because it comes and lives in you
[32:10] God lets everlasting eternal token it's
[32:15] eternal life by the eternal God and
[32:19] anything that had a beginning has an end
[32:21] and everything had a beginning besides
[32:24] God and God is the only form of eternal
[32:27] life there is and when God places his
[32:29] Holy Spirit in you which is God and when
[32:32] God places his self within you
[32:34] yours eternally as God is that cause
[32:36] you're part of him because you become a
[32:38] son or a daughter of God and you're
[32:40] displaying his word oh I feel religious
[32:45] that's true God in a positive self
[32:49] you've got eternal life that's God in
[32:52] you and this word is gone and that word
[32:55] lives and produces itself just exactly

[33:03] Spirit been displayed yes sir

[33:25] you can now see that the token is the
[33:27] inward baptism of the Holy Ghost in a
[33:30] real Christian soul the token is not a
[33:34] physical set of books or tapes or
[33:37] electronic mp3 files the token is what
[33:41] the Bible and brother Branham said it
[33:43] was the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[33:46] friends this video is produced in love
[33:49] and I can truly say that I love our
[33:51] friends in Jeffersonville and around the
[33:54] world who are part of the tape church
[33:56] movement if you carefully listen to this
[33:59] entire video you're aware I never spoke
[34:01] evil against the people in the tape
[34:03] church movement I never named called
[34:06] them or predicted where their souls
[34:07] would end up I'm praying for their
[34:10] salvation and correction I've made this
[34:13] video series following the leadership of
[34:16] the Holy Ghost to bring correction to
[34:18] the false teachings coming out of the
[34:20] tape church movement not speaking evil
[34:23] but speaking the truth I haven't called
[34:26] names but I could have I don't feel led
[34:30] to do that but please know brother
[34:32] Branham did in fact call names on tape
[34:34] to bring correction he did it with
[34:38] kindness to the brothers such as Billy
[34:40] Graham brother Brock brother Gilmour and
[34:43] brother David du Plessis the tape church
[34:48] movement is vast influencing millions
[34:51] since I believe their movement is
[34:53] teaching false doctrine I feel led of
[34:56] the Holy Ghost of brain correction and
[34:57] speak the truth in love as a witness
[35:00] against it as 1st Peter 3:15 and
[35:03] Ephesians 4:15 command me along with
[35:07] proving all things trying every spirit
[35:10] to see whether they are of God and I'm
[35:13] commissioned by God to rightly divide
[35:15] the word of truth according to 2nd
[35:17] Timothy 2:15
