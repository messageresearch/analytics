[0:13] her colors Revelation 17 ver4 said she
[0:17] was arrayed in scarlet and
[0:20] purple it is common to see priests and
[0:23] archbishops and even the pope frequently
[0:26] dressed in these colors based upon
[0:28] annual festivals holy days and other
[0:32] occasions her wealth Revelation 17:4
[0:36] also said she was AR raay with gold
[0:38] precious stones and pearls and had a
[0:40] Gold Cup in her hand the Bible portrays
[0:43] this woman or church as a wealthy Church
[0:45] the Vatican receives Free Will donations
[0:48] from more than 1 billion Catholics
[0:50] worldwide the Vatican also earns
[0:52] interest on its Investments and has
[0:54] flocks of tourists and visitors for its
[0:57] museums Galleries and libraries which
[1:00] hold their Priceless collections the
[1:02] mass Services of the Roman Catholic
[1:04] Church showcase golden cups instruments
[1:07] with precious stones just as the Bible
[1:10] foretold drunken with the blood of the
[1:13] Saints Revelation 17:6 said she was
[1:17] drunken with the blood of the Saints and
[1:19] with the blood of the martyrs of
[1:21] Jesus can it be possible that the Roman
[1:23] Catholic Church is responsible for the
[1:26] deaths of millions of true Christian
[1:28] Believers We Believe yes history proves
[1:31] that there was much corruption in the
[1:33] Roman Catholic church and poy during the
[1:36] Roman Empire and middle or dark
[1:39] ages Protestant historians record
[1:41] medieval Roman Catholic Church practices
[1:44] in the most negative terms and recall
[1:47] the massive Corruption of Catholic
[1:48] church leaders including adulteries
[1:51] bribes extravagant papal art and
[1:54] architecture projects and most
[1:56] destructive Wars of Conquest
[2:00] Samuel s Schmucker authored the Glorious
[2:02] reformation and detailed the horrifying
[2:05] tyranny and persecution of the Roman
[2:07] Catholic Church during the Dark Ages
[2:10] estimating that the Roman Catholic
[2:11] Church was responsible for the deaths of
[2:13] nearly 68 million Christians who
[2:16] descended from the teachings of the
[2:18] Roman Catholic Church the beginning of
[2:20] this violent Spirit towards non-roman
[2:22] Catholics can be found in the writings
[2:24] of St Augustine of Hippo according to
[2:27] how did it happen by r hasseltine
[2:31] when St hippo wrote that it was much
[2:32] better that some should perish by their
[2:34] own fires than that the whole body
[2:36] should burn in the Everlasting flames of
[2:39] gehenna through the desert of their
[2:41] impious dissensions popes had no fear
[2:44] killing people who dissented with them
[2:46] the attitude of the Roman Catholic
[2:48] Church was recorded as first invite then
[2:51] compel if they will not come into the
[2:54] first Roman Church By Invitation then
[2:56] compel them to come in by any means even
[2:59] though it be by by torture or by death
[3:02] the Catholic Inquisition and Crusades
[3:04] are undeniable historical examples of
[3:06] the Roman Catholic Church being drunken
[3:08] with the blood of the Saints just as the
[3:10] Bible
[3:13] foretold a great City Revelation 17:18
[3:17] said the woman or Harlot church is that
[3:20] great City that Reigns over the kings of
[3:22] the earth what other church can claim to
[3:24] be a great City and have influence
[3:26] politically and spiritually over the
[3:28] Earth's leaders of other than the
[3:30] Vatican City which includes the Roman
[3:32] Catholic church and her Pope the Vatican
[3:35] City state is the epitome of church and
[3:37] state the Vatican City is the
[3:40] ecclesiastical state seat of the Roman
[3:42] Catholic Church situated on the West
[3:45] Bank of the Tyber River Vatican City is
[3:48] the world's smallest fully independent
[3:50] nation
[3:51] state this city state is taxfree and has
[3:54] its own telephone system postal office
[3:57] Gardens astronomical Observatory radio
[4:01] station banking system and Pharmacy as
[4:04] well as a contingent of Swiss guards
[4:06] responsible for the personal safety of
[4:08] the Pope since
[4:11] 1506 rides the
[4:13] Beast Revelation 17:3 said that this
[4:17] woman or church rides the
[4:19] [Music]
[4:20] Beast first we Define the Beast as the
[4:23] spirit of Rome or the evil spirit behind
[4:25] the kingdom of Rome based upon Daniel
[4:28] 231 1-45 and
[4:31] 7:23 the fourth Beast shall be the
[4:34] fourth Kingdom upon the
[4:37] Earth Daniel 2 described an image or
[4:40] statue that had four sections and the
[4:43] Bible described the top two sections as
[4:45] the kingdom of Babylon Daniel 238 head
[4:49] of gold and the kingdom of the mes and
[4:52] Persians Daniel 528 breast of silver
[4:56] history tells us that the thighs of
[4:58] brass was the Grecian Empire led by
[5:00] Alexander the Great lastly the legs of
[5:03] iron were the Roman Empire and feet of
[5:05] iron and Clay were Roman Catholics and
[5:08] Protestants notice that the feed of iron
[5:10] and Clay lasted until the end time when
[5:13] the stone cut out of the mountain which
[5:15] is the Lord Jesus returns to destroy the
[5:18] Gentile kingdoms that Daniel foresaw and
[5:21] recorded for
[5:22] us this church the Roman Catholic Church
[5:26] rides the power of the original evil
[5:28] spirit of the pagan Roman government
[5:30] that divided and conquered and still
[5:33] seeks to conquer and Lord over anyone
[5:35] and everyone All Nations peoples
[5:38] multitudes and
[5:40] tongues God's true prophet of this day
[5:43] William brandham spoke with thus sayith
[5:46] the Lord that Rome would rule in the end
[5:48] times and conquer the world before the
[5:51] return of Jesus Christ to the
[5:53] Earth God's word Can't Fail romanism is
[5:57] going to conquer the world Amen
[6:00] let's take Daniel's Vision that's the
[6:02] word of
[6:03] God King Nebuchadnezzar is a head of
[6:05] gold B another kingdom of sued D which
[6:09] is silver see which is me of Persia
[6:12] another was gree Alexander the Great
[6:14] next come in Rome and there was nothing
[6:16] said about a
[6:17] communism Rome conquered the world the
[6:21] confederation of churches organizing
[6:23] themselves together it isn't Russia it's
[6:26] Rome that's the Lord
[6:31] the mark of the
[6:33] beast Revelation 13: 16-18 teaches that
[6:37] the mark of the beast or the mark of the
[6:39] Roman spirit will be in their right hand
[6:42] or in their foreheads the Bible teaches
[6:45] that no man can buy or sell without the
[6:47] Mark or the name of the Beast or the
[6:50] number of his name the mark in the right
[6:52] hand means that all people including
[6:55] church members will have to do the will
[6:57] of the One World Church system
[7:00] or others can take a mark in their
[7:02] foreheads which means they will take the
[7:04] doctrine of the World Church system
[7:07] which includes trinitarianism
[7:09] universalism and other doctrines not
[7:11] found in
[7:13] scripture the image of the
[7:15] Beast since the Beast or Spirit of Rome
[7:18] is invisible the Bible predicts the
[7:20] Beast will make an image for itself the
[7:23] image of the Beast will be a worldwide
[7:25] ecumenical council wherein all the
[7:28] organized churches will get together in
[7:29] a union with the Roman Catholic Church
[7:33] it seems likely that the World Council
[7:34] of churches will be a part of this image
[7:37] unto the Beast as this organization
[7:39] represents nearly 500 million Christians
[7:42] and literally seeks visible Unity or an
[7:45] image for Christians yet without a unity
[7:47] in true Doctrine so it cannot be true
[7:50] Unity since Jesus taught that the
[7:52] heavenly father seeks true worshippers
[7:55] who Worship in spirit and in truth so
[7:58] then these churches who reject the truth
[8:00] of the Bible for the sake of a false
[8:02] Unity manifest that they are true
[8:05] Daughters of the mother Harlot the Roman
[8:07] Catholic
[8:08] Church the false
[8:12] prophet Revelation 19: 20 and chap 20:10
[8:16] mention a false prophet that is closely
[8:19] connected to the Beast or Spirit of Rome
[8:22] the false prophet is called a man since
[8:24] a prophet is one who speaks for God we
[8:26] conclude that the one man who claims to
[8:28] speak for God God and is false in his
[8:31] Doctrine and is closely connected to the
[8:33] spirit of Rome is the pope of the Roman
[8:36] Catholic
[8:37] Church the CCC teaches that the pope has
[8:41] the authority of Christ and has an
[8:43] infallibility in virtue of his office
[8:46] when he teaches the word of God yet as
[8:48] we have already showed the pope and his
[8:50] church are filled with false Doctrine
[8:53] thus making his office the false prophet
[8:55] connected to the Beast or Roman
[8:58] spirit as we mentioned earlier one
[9:01] specific sinful Act is that of giving
[9:03] the Pope the title of Holy Father the
[9:06] title Holy Father is used only one time
[9:08] in the Bible St John
[9:10] 17:1 Jesus called God himself Holy
[9:13] Father so for the recent popes to take
[9:16] that title so easily and without
[9:18] reservation shows their blind spiritual
[9:21] condition it is plain to see that the
[9:23] pope is exalted above God for he robs
[9:26] god of the very title that the son of
[9:28] God gave to his eternal
[9:31] father we believe the false prophet is
[9:34] the same office as what is generally
[9:36] called the Antichrist or the person who
[9:38] will rule deceive and influence the
[9:41] entire world at the end of the
[9:43] world 2 Thessalonians 2: 3-13 teaches on
[9:48] the Antichrist calling him the man of
[9:51] sin the son of predition and that Wicked
[9:54] This false prophet will oppose God and
[9:57] exalt himself above all that is called
[9:59] God
[9:59] which would be the word of God he will
[10:02] sit in the very temple of God making
[10:04] himself receive worship as God the Bible
[10:07] goes on to say he will have Satan's
[10:08] power and signs and lying wonders just
[10:12] as the false prophet was said to work
[10:14] miracles in Revelation
[10:16] 19:20 this Antichrist will deceive with
[10:19] unrighteousness and lies and he will
[10:22] allow his followers to live in the
[10:24] pleasures of sin according to 2
[10:26] Thessalonians 210 111 and 12 but those
[10:29] who overcome him will be Believers and
[10:32] lovers of
