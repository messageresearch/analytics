[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] I'm not sinless I got plenty hanging on
[0:06] me but every hour I confess it
[0:09] constantly I going on the merits of the
[0:11] blood of Jesus Christ he died for
[0:14] me greetings friends in the matchless
[0:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:19] purpose of this video is to react to a
[0:21] recent video I saw about Derek Prince
[0:24] and his comments on God's Prophet
[0:26] brother William brandham hi friends I'm
[0:28] Jesse Smith pastor Christ Fellowship
[0:30] here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the
[0:34] original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:35] that he revealed to St Paul and then
[0:37] restored through Martin Luther John
[0:40] Wesley and the late Prophet brother
[0:41] William brandham 1909 to 1965 and also
[0:45] defend brother bram's Godly Christian
[0:46] character and that's what this video is
[0:48] about by the grace of God I'm going to
[0:50] begin this video by sharing a clip from
[0:53] a video I saw of Dereck Prince Derek
[0:55] Prince was a Pentecostal Bible teacher
[0:57] lived from 1915 to 2003
[1:00] I've viewed some of his sermons uh they
[1:02] were blessing the ones on fasting and
[1:04] praying and the teaching on blessings
[1:06] and curses was a real blessing to me he
[1:09] used a lot of Bible scripture that was
[1:11] helpful to me one major difference I
[1:13] have with Derek Prince was the fact that
[1:15] tongues were the culmination or he
[1:18] called him the Seal of the baptism of
[1:20] the Holy Spirit his personal website
[1:23] shares his belief on tongues as the
[1:25] evidence or culmination of the baptism
[1:29] here's a screenshot shot he said quote
[1:31] the distinctive seal of the baptism in
[1:33] the Holy Spirit is speaking in tongues
[1:35] some call it the evidence actually I
[1:37] prefer myself to call the culmination of
[1:39] the
[1:40] baptism I have a video about the five or
[1:43] six reasons why tongues are not the
[1:45] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[1:46] Ghost as both the Bible and God's
[1:49] Prophet brother brandham plainly teach
[1:51] so let's get to this video now I saw
[1:53] recently of Dereck Prince I personally
[1:55] believe Dereck Prince erroneously says
[1:57] brother brandom was led by two different
[2:00] Spirits I've listened to Brother
[2:01] brandham since 2001 late 2001 so almost
[2:04] 22 years and I've never heard a more
[2:07] Bible centered preacher I've never heard
[2:09] a more humble Preacher Brother BR was a
[2:12] true Holy Ghost filled Saint a humble
[2:14] man of God a genuine prophet of God as
[2:17] all my videos and sermons show by the
[2:19] grace of God but after watching this
[2:21] video it made me think of two questions
[2:22] so I like some input from the Saints
[2:24] again this is sort of a different video
[2:25] a reaction video first is Derek Prince
[2:28] referring to Gordon Lindsay
[2:30] and then number two if so what were the
[2:33] specific reasons Lindsay separated from
[2:35] brother brandham in Lindsay's own words
[2:39] so here's the clip I found it on the
[2:41] torn curtain by Joshua Simone YouTube
[2:44] channel I don't follow this man and he's
[2:46] against brother brandham so I don't
[2:48] support him at all but his video came up
[2:50] and it mentioned brother brandham so I
[2:51] watched it here's the video and I'm
[2:53] going to say something which in a way is
[2:55] painful but I I've prayed much about
[2:57] this I think God wants me to say it
[2:59] Pentecost hostals of whom I am one have
[3:01] a kind of awe of William Branham how
[3:04] many of you have heard of William
[3:05] Branham that's most of you well William
[3:07] Branham was a man of God with a most
[3:09] remarkable and dramatic gift from God
[3:13] but I happen to have been friends with a
[3:14] Bible teacher whose name I will not give
[3:17] who worked very closely with William
[3:19] Branham for several years and he gave us
[3:21] once a personal sharing and he said I
[3:25] had to come to the conclusion that there
[3:27] were two Spirits in William Brandon one
[3:29] was the spirit of God and one was not
[3:32] and you see the sad thing is and I say
[3:35] this with real sadness in spite of His
[3:38] Marvelous gifts and the way God used him
[3:41] his end was either pathetic or tragic
[3:44] according to how you view it he was
[3:46] killed as a result of a motor accident
[3:48] in which his car was struck by a drunk
[3:50] driver and he left behind a little group
[3:53] of Fanatics who were worshippers of
[3:56] William brandham and who are some of the
[3:59] saddest people you'll ever meet in a
[4:01] Christian Association why did that
[4:04] happen because if you mix two spirits
[4:07] and don't eliminate the wrong one
[4:10] ultimately it will corrupt the work of
[4:13] the good one okay so the first thing I
[4:15] want to say is I'm thankful that Derek
[4:16] Prince recognized powerful gift of God
[4:19] that brother brandham had of course
[4:21] commissioned by an Angel in 1946 we're
[4:23] thankful for that so I appreciate Derek
[4:25] Prince recognizing that second notice
[4:29] Derrick Prince did not not have this
[4:30] knowledge firsthand he took someone
[4:32] else's word about brother brandham so to
[4:34] me that's a big mistake drik Prince made
[4:37] and of course maybe he wasn't even
[4:38] around to get to meet brother brandom I
[4:40] don't know it seems like most likely
[4:42] they never crossed paths but that leads
[4:44] me into the question can someone please
[4:45] tell me if indeed Derek Prince is
[4:47] referring to Gordon Lindsay and then
[4:50] perhaps give me some proof of that I
[4:51] don't know maybe there's videos out
[4:53] there of Derrik Prince talking about his
[4:55] relationship with Gordon Lindsay if so
[4:57] please share them with me maybe I'll
[4:58] make a part two to follow up on this
[5:00] video the next point is that Derek
[5:03] Prince seems to believe this friend who
[5:05] said brother bandam had two Spirits in
[5:07] him based upon the fact that brother Ram
[5:09] died by a car accident to me that's a
[5:11] very weak argument friends all of us
[5:14] know some people some really Godly
[5:16] Saints who died in accidents whether
[5:18] plane accidents car accidents I think
[5:20] it's really immature to judge someone by
[5:22] the way that they die even Elisha died
[5:26] from a disease in 2 Kings
[5:28] 13:14 Elisha had twice as many miracles
[5:31] as Elijah but God let him die on a sick
[5:34] bed with a disease that doesn't make
[5:36] Elisha less of a man of God just like
[5:38] all the people we know that have died
[5:40] tragically in car accidents and plane
[5:42] accidents maybe motorcycle accidents
[5:44] that's not always a sign of God's
[5:46] judgment or displeasure with a person I
[5:49] think the right approach is to look at
[5:50] how they live their life for example
[5:53] David the man after God's Own Heart
[5:55] seems like he died in peace but look
[5:57] what he did during his life he committed
[5:59] adultery murdered numbered the people
[6:02] there was numerous mistakes David made
[6:04] that were awful mistakes but he died in
[6:06] peace now contrast that with brother
[6:08] Brenham brother Brenham was a prophet of
[6:10] God finished the mysteries of God
[6:12] prophesied correctly over six times in
[6:14] the name of the Lord he died tragically
[6:17] we'd say but he never committed adultery
[6:19] he never murdered so what would you
[6:21] rather have if you had the choice
[6:22] between those two lives one life you die
[6:26] peacefully but you commit awful sins
[6:28] another life you live righteously then
[6:30] you have a tragic death so I believe
[6:32] it's wise to focus on how a person lived
[6:34] and not so much how a person died the
[6:37] next point is that Derek Prince says
[6:39] brother brandom left behind a very small
[6:40] group of people that worshiped him I
[6:43] think this is a misleading statement
[6:45] there were many many people that
[6:47] followed brother brandham and his
[6:49] bible-based teachings that were left
[6:50] behind after brother bram's death it's
[6:53] true there was a small group that
[6:54] worshiped him they still worship him
[6:56] today at brandham Tabernacle that's not
[6:58] the majority of people people and even
[7:00] though some preachers that were around
[7:01] brother brandham went into awful sins
[7:04] that's because the Bible says few there
[7:06] be that find the narrow road that leads
[7:07] to life remember Jesus had 70 men who
[7:10] left him 70 preachers left Jesus so the
[7:13] majority of the preachers Around Jesus
[7:14] left him and the minority stayed true to
[7:17] him same thing is true in every age Paul
[7:20] said all in Asia have forsaken me so
[7:23] that means very few stayed with St Paul
[7:25] same thing we see with brother brandham
[7:26] very few stayed with brother bram's
[7:27] Bible teachings this helps us to to see
[7:29] again that Jesus Christ is the same
[7:31] yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8
[7:34] and again brother Bram did not mix two
[7:36] Spirits that's a ridiculous statement
[7:38] for Derek Prince to make that would put
[7:40] brother brandom on the level of balum
[7:42] and that's not true brother Bram was a
[7:43] genuine prophet of God brother BR
[7:45] constantly preached the word of God he
[7:47] was constantly repenting of his sins he
[7:49] said I confess my sins every day every
[7:51] hour he was constantly pleading for the
[7:54] grace of God to be on his life again the
[7:56] most faithful Bible preacher I've ever
[7:59] heard the most humble Bible preacher
[8:01] I've ever heard as even my own Ministry
[8:03] has has been most impacted by the
[8:05] ministry of God's Prophet brother
[8:07] William brandham the last thing I want
[8:08] to show is what seems to be some
[8:10] evidences of why Gordon Lindsay left
[8:13] brother brandham there's a website
[8:15] called prophetic Revelation and I don't
[8:17] agree with many things this man says but
[8:19] he does seem to have real letters from
[8:21] Gordon Lindsay and his wife Freda
[8:23] Lindsay so I want to show those now so
[8:25] in this first letter this is from Freda
[8:28] Lindsay Gordon Lindsay's wife and it
[8:30] seems she disagreed with Brother brandom
[8:33] on the Lord Jesus Christ water
[8:39] baptism so this is not Gordon Lindsay's
[8:42] statement it's his wife's statement so I
[8:44] don't know if there's a disagreement
[8:45] between Gordon Lindsay and his wife on
[8:47] the correct water baptism but it seems
[8:49] from this letter that Mrs Lindsay
[8:50] disagreed with the Lord Jesus Christ
[8:52] baptism that would mean she was a
[8:54] trinitarian and of course trinitarianism
[8:56] is of the devil it adds to the Bible
[8:58] thus sayith the Lord God's Prophet
[9:00] brother Braham told us that now here's a
[9:02] letter that seems to be from Gordon
[9:03] Lindsay and there's three statements
[9:05] Lindsay makes about his disagreements
[9:07] with brother brandham first he disagreed
[9:09] brother brandham was anointed with the
[9:11] spirit of Elijah now I have videos that
[9:13] plainly teach that brother brandham was
[9:15] anointed with the spirit of Elijah
[9:17] undoubtedly he has the five or six
[9:19] characteristics of the spirit of Elijah
[9:22] second it seems Gordon Lindsay didn't
[9:24] believe brother Ram was a messenger of
[9:26] the Covenant as a forerunner but of
[9:28] course I believe in many many people
[9:29] believe he was according to Malachi 4:5
[9:32] and6 and Revelation 10
[9:34] 1-7 Christ The Mighty angel came down
[9:36] with a rainbow that represents a
[9:38] covenant John the Baptist was a
[9:39] messenger a forerunner of the Covenant
[9:41] to the first coming of Christ and we
[9:43] believe that's what brother Ram did he
[9:45] was a messenger restoring the Covenant
[9:47] finishing the mystery of God restoring
[9:49] the hearts of the people back to the
[9:50] Covenant of the original Apostolic
[9:52] fathers the Pentecostal fathers Paul
[9:55] James Peter and all the Bible authors
[9:59] then thirdly seems Gordon Lindsay said
[10:01] brother Ram had other doctrines and
[10:03] others around him greatly hindered him
[10:06] so of course I disagree with that I
[10:07] don't think anybody hindered brother
[10:09] brandham I think brother Bram was like
[10:10] any other man his own mistakes may have
[10:12] hindered him a little but truly God got
[10:14] the glory and brother Ram's Ministry he
[10:16] finished the mysteries of God he turned
[10:19] our hearts back to the apostolic fathers
[10:21] preached the seven Church ages revealed
[10:23] the Seven Seals with thus say the Lord
[10:25] with 38 differences from Clarence Larin
[10:27] and Charles T Russell gave us thus say
[10:30] the Lord on marriage divorce through the
[10:31] revelation of the Holy Spirit made the
[10:33] Bible a brand new Bible in
[10:36] closing friends I look forward to
[10:38] getting your comments or you can email
[10:40] me with any other Insight you have on
[10:42] why Gordon Lindsay might have separated
[10:44] himself from brother brandham it's
[10:46] always interesting to see people who
[10:48] lived around the time of brother
[10:49] brandham what they thought of him so
[10:51] here we see Derek Prince and no doubt
[10:52] even Gordon Lindsay he wrote a man sent
[10:54] from God he wrote that book they
[10:56] recognized a mighty gift of the Holy
[10:58] Ghost in brother bram's life but it
[11:00] seems they disagreed on Doctrine and
[11:02] were turned away by those who had heirs
[11:05] around the ministry of brother brandham
[11:07] like those that worship brother brandham
[11:09] brother Bram tried to rebuke those
[11:10] people of course we know that in 1961 he
[11:12] dealt with that even left the ministry
[11:14] for a little while until those people
[11:16] repented but of course that Spirit
[11:18] didn't die it anointed other people and
[11:20] it's still alive today but brother R's
[11:22] Focus was truly on the Lord Jesus Christ
[11:24] undoubtedly brother BR never glorified
[11:26] himself never magnified himself he
[11:28] humbly served the Lord Jesus Christ
[11:29] until the day God took him home so
[11:32] perhaps we'll have a second part on this
[11:33] we'll see by God's grace I remain so
[11:36] thankful to God for sending his Prophet
[11:38] brother William brandham his ministry
[11:40] from the Bible has transformed my life
[11:41] transformed the Bible to me I've met two
[11:44] people that new brother brandham Tom
[11:46] Brown and sister Florence Humes both
[11:48] have passed away they spoke very highly
[11:51] of brother brandham and to them God
[11:53] showed to them that undoubtedly brother
[11:55] Brown was a genuine prophet of God no
[11:57] doubt about it so we're thankful for
[11:58] God's prophet we're thankful for God's
[12:00] mercy to us we Rejoice that God has
[12:02] finished the mystery of God in this day
[12:04] and we're eating the book by the grace
[12:06] of God if you have any questions
[12:08] concerns or testimonies about this video
[12:10] please contact me God bless you and may
[12:13] Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
