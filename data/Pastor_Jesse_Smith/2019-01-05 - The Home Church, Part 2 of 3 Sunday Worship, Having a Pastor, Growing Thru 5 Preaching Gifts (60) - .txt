TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] worship on Sunday and other days the book of Acts details how Paul and Jesus's disciples gathered on the first day of the week Sunday most likely because Christ rose from the dead on the first day of the week Paul and other Christians gathered on Sundays to listen to preaching take communion and give financial gifts to God's ministries acts 20 verse 7 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread Paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight 1st Corinthians 16 verses 1 and 2 now concerning the collection for the Saints as I have given order to the churches of Galatia even so do ye upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as God hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when I come along with Sunday worship Christians are to gather on the other days of the week because Hebrews 10:25 says we should assemble more as we see Christ's return approaching our church feels that of the Holy Spirit to have weekly services on Wednesday evening and to Sunday services on special occasions we've also held services on Thursday Friday and Saturday you and I must gather more with Christians as the spirit leads us having a pastor every Christian should have a pastor at his or her home Church the office of a pastor is ordained by Jesus Christ himself as Ephesians chapter 4 teaches us that after Jesus ascended to the right hand of the Father in heaven he sent five preaching gifts one of which is the pastor gift Ephesians 4:8 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men Ephesians 4:11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers the word pastor means Shepherd in both Greek and Hebrew which enlightens our understanding to Jesus as does nine for his people Jesus the chief shepherd in heaven sees his followers as sheep who need fed and protected by an earthly Shepherd a pastor your home church is the spiritual flock that you as God's sheep must remain in Matthew nine verses 35 to 38 beautifully illustrates jesus's compassion upon his sheep or believers as it says but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest jesus's remedy for scattered sheep was prayer prayer the labors would go out and labor in the harvest to gather his sheep and feed them jesus wants you to have a pasture dear friend feeding God's sheep God's pure word is the pastor's main duty for Jesus charge Peter to feed his lambs and sheep in order to prove his love for Christ in John 21 verses 15 through 17 when Paul left Ephesus he charged the elders to feed the Church of God after warning them for three years in tears that wolves would enter into their churches according to acts 20 verses 28 to 31 in Paul's final letter before his martyrdom he charged Timothy to preach the word in 2nd Timothy 4 verses 1 and 2 Christian friend if you want to be a healthy and obedient sheep belonging to Jesus let him lead you to a home church and a pasture to feed your soul God's holy word be assured also that your pastor or Shepherd will give an account for your soul to go along with the account that you give for your own soul Romans 14:12 so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God Hebrews 13:17 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for the wolf for you may you follow God's leading to submit to and obey all of Christ's words that your pastor both preaches and lives before you and your family growing from the five preaching gifts through regular church attendance Jesus designed that his sheep would grow and stay spiritually healthy through five preaching gifts after Jesus ascended to heaven he sent these five gifts for a five-fold blessing to his sheep apostles our missionaries the highest calling in the Bible traveling to lands around the world to make new converts and churches to Christ's prophets both major/minor foretell the future by the Spirit of God and speak with the authority of thus saith the Lord evangelist traveled to various established churches and reignite believers faith pastors stay in one local church to feed and protect believers teachers are reveal the deeper truths of God's Word in their home church and can also travel to other churches Jesus designed that pastors would allow these four other preaching gifts to operate in their local assemblies in brotherly love and cooperation and Paul says there are five benefits to hearing all five preaching gifts which include the perfection of the saints which means the equipping of the Saints the work of the ministry which means undertaking the work of the ministry the edifying of the body of Christ which means promoting the growth of Christians the unity of the faith which means the agreement of faith or beliefs the unity of the knowledge of the Son of God which means unity of knowledge or precise truth these five benefits all work to create a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ meaning they will bring each Christian to a portion of maturity in Jesus Christ as mature Christians we then speak the truth in love not hate envy or jealousy and find where God has fitly joined us in our position in the body of Christ Paul says the fivefold preaching ministry will cause us to no longer be the following immature meaning unskilled and foolish tossed meaning agitated like waves carried which means driven by doubts hesitations and opinions and deceived which means to roam or be led astray [Music] if you have any questions about having a home church please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
