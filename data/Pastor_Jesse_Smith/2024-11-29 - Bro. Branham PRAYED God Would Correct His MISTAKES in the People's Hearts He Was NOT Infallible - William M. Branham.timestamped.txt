[0:02] I pray tonight Lord let the Holy Spirit
[0:05] take my mistakes Lord and correct them
[0:07] in the hearts of the
[0:09] people greetings friends in the
[0:11] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:14] the purpose of this video is to show how
[0:16] God's true Prophet The Late William
[0:17] brandham prayed that the Holy Ghost
[0:20] would correct any mistakes he made
[0:21] during a sermon in the hearts of the
[0:24] people the listeners the Believers who
[0:27] heard the preaching of the word from the
[0:29] prophet of God
[0:30] hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride
[0:32] of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio
[0:34] USA and I defend the original Gospel of
[0:36] the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed
[0:38] through St Paul and then had to restore
[0:40] through Martin Luther John Wesley and
[0:42] the late Prophet William Marian brandham
[0:44] who lived from 1909 to 1965 and also
[0:47] defend brother Ram's Godly Christian
[0:48] character in this video we'll play two
[0:50] quotes from God's Prophet where he
[0:52] prayed that the Holy Spirit would
[0:54] correct the mistakes he made during the
[0:56] sermon in the hearts of the people and
[0:58] to me this is how a real prophet of God
[1:00] would pray a real prophet of God would
[1:02] know he's not perfect he's not
[1:03] infallible he's only infallible when he
[1:05] speaks thus sayith the Lord or in the
[1:07] name of the Lord when prompted by the
[1:09] Holy Ghost but other than those times he
[1:12] was human and therefore he'd make human
[1:15] mistakes but in his Godly humility he
[1:17] asked the Lord that the Lord would
[1:19] correct any mistakes he made in the
[1:21] hearts of the people so this video
[1:23] defends God's Prophet brother brandham
[1:25] against those who worship brother
[1:27] brandham those who idolize brother
[1:28] brandham or worship brother Ram's tapes
[1:31] by falsely saying every word on brother
[1:33] Rams tapes are thus sayith the Lord
[1:35] that's a lie that's heresy this video
[1:38] rebukes that Spirit of idolatry that
[1:40] surrounds the deceived people that claim
[1:43] to follow brother Ram's Ministry but
[1:45] they really don't because they're in air
[1:48] the only reason someone would be upset
[1:49] with this type of video is because they
[1:51] have an evil spirit of idolatry or a
[1:53] lying Spirit but to those of us who are
[1:55] true Holy Ghost filled Believers this
[1:56] video rejoices our hearts cuz we see the
[1:58] humility of a real prophet of God
[2:01] friends it's Satan that wants Believers
[2:02] to turn off their gifts of discernment
[2:05] when listening to brother brandom
[2:06] because even brother brandham said I've
[2:08] always asked you to be careful of what
[2:09] you're listening to to separate the
[2:12] human side of brother brandom from the
[2:13] prophetic gift side of course that's
[2:15] from he cares do you care 1963
[2:19] now see I always asked you to be careful
[2:24] what you're listening to see there's so
[2:27] much of it that it's just the human side
[2:30] but always if there is something that
[2:33] goes forth it will speak it it's thus
[2:36] sayeth the Lord even to Visions or
[2:40] anything so the quote I'll begin with is
[2:42] from works as Faith expressed November
[2:44] 26th 1965 brother is praying right
[2:47] before he gets to his text and he says I
[2:49] pray tonight Lord let the Holy Spirit
[2:52] take my mistakes Lord and correct them
[2:54] in the hearts of the people make it real
[2:56] and make it a real night that he can bed
[2:59] himself into Into the Heart of each
[3:00] believer so this quote is at the end of
[3:02] brother Ram's Ministry of course it's
[3:04] after the seals have been revealed let's
[3:06] listen to the quote I pray tonight Lord
[3:08] that somehow you'll build faith in these
[3:11] people's hearts that every one of them
[3:13] will be delivered all these sick and
[3:15] Afflicted people may it be so simple
[3:18] Lord just let us as we try to teach the
[3:21] word let the Holy Spirit take my
[3:23] mistakes Lord and correct them in the
[3:24] hearts of the people and make it a real
[3:27] real night that the that he can bed
[3:30] himself into the heart of each believer
[3:32] here next is a quote from the countdown
[3:35] November 25th evening service 1962
[3:38] brother B is praying and he asks where
[3:40] we have made a mistake so he's speaking
[3:42] of preachers in the five-fold ministry
[3:44] the great holy spirit will take the
[3:45] words and wind them around and fix them
[3:47] in the hearts in the correct way that
[3:50] they might understand that that's
[3:51] preparation time now before the going
[3:53] away of the church again such a humble
[3:55] prayer from a true man of God he knew
[3:58] that he was a fallible person he made
[4:00] mistakes in his own human thinking and
[4:02] he prayed for himself and other
[4:03] preachers that would make mistakes that
[4:05] the Holy Spirit would bring correction
[4:06] to it the only way the Holy Spirit can
[4:08] do that is by pointing the Believers to
[4:10] the word of God because the word of God
[4:11] is infallible and brother R said the
[4:13] Holy Ghost will only point you to the
[4:15] word of God the Holy Ghost will only
[4:17] direct you to the word of God not
[4:19] outside the word of God the holy spirit
[4:22] is a
[4:23] compass the North Star is the word and
[4:27] the compass will only point to the North
[4:29] Star
[4:30] and the Holy Ghost will only point you
[4:32] to the word not some ecumenical move not
[4:35] some denomination but to the word of God
[4:38] Amen you remember all the other stars
[4:41] shift with the world but the North Star
[4:43] stays exactly because it's in the center
[4:46] and every other man's word will fail but
[4:48] God's word Can't Fail it's a NSTAR
[4:51] centered it won't shift with the world
[4:53] no matter where the world is it Remains
[4:55] the same yesterday today and forever and
[4:58] he is the word let's listen to the quote
[5:01] Lord
[5:02] Jesus uh forgive us of our our ways that
[5:07] maybe we fail somewhere maybe to get the
[5:10] message just the way it should be but
[5:13] father I pray that where we have made a
[5:15] mistake that the great holy spirit will
[5:18] take the words and wind them around and
[5:20] fix them into the hearts in the correct
[5:22] way that they might understand that's
[5:26] preparation time now before they're
[5:28] going away of the church so friends
[5:31] after hearing these two quotes I thought
[5:33] about the ridiculous comment some people
[5:35] say is how dare you correct God's
[5:37] Prophet but we would say how dare you
[5:39] deny ignore discredit or take away
[5:42] brother brenham's scriptural prayers
[5:44] that we just played and that you were
[5:46] able to listen to why would you
[5:48] discredit those prayers how dare someone
[5:51] ignore what brother Brandon prayed to
[5:52] the Lord Jesus Christ that even though
[5:54] he made mistakes he asked the Holy
[5:56] Spirit to correct them in the hearts of
[5:58] the people and again how dare you
[6:01] worship and idolize a man that is not
[6:03] Jesus Christ how dare you make every
[6:05] word of any sinner Say by Grace
[6:08] infallible and as the brandom Tabernacle
[6:11] believes how dare brandom Tabernacle
[6:13] make every word on the tape thus sayi
[6:15] the Lord their Pastor Joseph Brenham has
[6:16] said that numerous times that's what
[6:18] people should dare not do is idolize a
[6:21] man or deify the tapes or deify brother
[6:24] brandham now briefly let's review the
[6:26] Bible truth behind this it's from Romans
[6:28] 3:4 God forbid let God be true but every
[6:32] man a liar every man has told a lie
[6:34] outside of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[6:35] he's a new creation he was the beginning
[6:37] of the new creation of God he was a God
[6:40] man all of us are just men with God
[6:43] inside of us if we're born again by the
[6:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost but Jesus was
[6:47] the word made flesh he was and is the
[6:50] image of the invisible God Romans 3
[6:52] continues to say this in verse 10-4
[6:55] there's none righteous know not one
[6:58] verse 12 says they are all gone out of
[7:00] the way they are together become
[7:02] unprofitable there's none that doeth
[7:04] good know not one their throat is an
[7:06] open supplier with their tongues they've
[7:09] used deceit the poison of ASP is in
[7:11] under their lips whose mouth is full of
[7:13] cursing and
[7:14] bitterness so we see at some point in
[7:16] every person's life other than the Lord
[7:18] Jesus Christ they're not righteous they
[7:20] don't seek after God they're not
[7:21] profitable and their tongue speaks
[7:24] things that are wrong they say things
[7:26] that do not honor God then remember you
[7:28] know Abraham Li lied twice about Sarah
[7:30] being his wife he was the first man
[7:32] called a prophet in the King James
[7:34] version Bible in the Book of Genesis we
[7:36] know Moses called Israel Rebels and then
[7:39] miss the promised land because that
[7:40] wasn't the will of the Lord not every
[7:42] word Abraham or Moses said was thus sayi
[7:45] the Lord and then Elijah even told God
[7:47] in the cave that he was the only
[7:49] believer left but God had to correct him
[7:50] and say there was 7,000 still remaining
[7:53] that had not bowed the knee to Baal so
[7:55] again this proves that not every word a
[7:57] prophet says is thus sayi the Lord but a
[7:59] prophet is infallible when he speaks in
[8:02] the name of the Lord with thus sayith
[8:04] the Lord and so we know brother random
[8:06] meets this requirement along with these
[8:08] other prophets of course Abraham Moses
[8:10] Elijah and many others by the grace of
[8:12] God now let's look at five not
[8:15] infallible quotes if you type in not
[8:17] infallible the phrase there's eight hits
[8:19] five of them are times brother Ram says
[8:21] prophets are not infallible the first in
[8:23] 1955 the True Vine and a false Vine
[8:25] brother bandam said prophets they're not
[8:27] infallible people and he gives Elijah as
[8:30] an
[8:32] example the next quote from 1957 brother
[8:35] random said proves God just reveals To
[8:38] His prophets that what he wants them to
[8:40] know nothing else prophets are not
[8:42] infallible people he was speaking of how
[8:44] Isaac blessed Jacob instead of Esau and
[8:47] then Jacob held on a Joseph's coat for
[8:49] 40 years bloody thinking an animal
[8:50] killed it and an animal didn't kill
[8:53] Joseph and yet he was a
[8:55] prophet thirdly 1959 possessing the
[8:58] enemy's Gates brother Ram said men are
[8:59] are not infallible but God is he said
[9:02] man you get your mind on a man he'll
[9:04] make a mistake maybe not willfully but
[9:05] he'll do it God permits him to do it so
[9:07] that he can shake your faith away from
[9:09] man so look how merciful god is God lets
[9:12] prophets or any other person make a
[9:14] mistake so the people watching the
[9:16] prophet or the person do not trust in
[9:18] the man that their faith is only in the
[9:20] Lord Jesus Christ I like this one from
[9:23] 1961 questions and answers brother Ram
[9:26] says at the beginning of this recording
[9:28] he said these answers are not infallible
[9:31] because the scriptures is infallible he
[9:33] says I know the scriptures are
[9:35] infallible but my answers are not
[9:37] infallible so I'm sure everyone
[9:39] understands that and these answers are
[9:43] not infallible see because the
[9:46] scriptures is
[9:47] infallible and as far as I know they're
[9:51] line with the scriptures I hope that
[9:54] makes it plain and the tape is to be uh
[9:58] kept now and anyone would want it
[10:01] well could have it but now I know the
[10:05] scriptures are infallible but my answers
[10:08] are not infallible so I'm sure everyone
[10:11] understands that and if it's not the if
[10:14] it's not infallable then you have a
[10:16] right maybe to ask me so we thank God
[10:20] for having brother Ram say this and yes
[10:22] brother random every holy ghost filled
[10:24] person understands that that you are not
[10:27] infallible but Jesus Christ and his his
[10:29] Bible are infallible it's sad though now
[10:32] most tape church people and tape
[10:34] worshippers don't understand what
[10:36] brother Adam is trying to explain to
[10:37] them I wish they would play this tape in
[10:39] Brenham Tabernacle and around the world
[10:41] to people that worship the tapes and
[10:44] Fifth and finally from calling Jesus on
[10:46] the scene
[10:47] 1963 brother Ram said if I make mistakes
[10:49] you pray for me I'm not infallible I'm
[10:52] your
[10:53] brother here in this final section I
[10:55] want to recall some videos that are
[10:57] related the first one was not every word
[10:59] brother random said was thus sayith the
[11:00] Lord this is a 27 minute long video this
[11:04] will help you a lot if you listen to it
[11:07] if you wonder about how a prophet can be
[11:09] fallible in his human side or in his
[11:12] [Music]
[11:13] Humanity next I have a three-part series
[11:15] called 60 plus proofs the tapes of
[11:17] brother brandham have mistakes yet he's
[11:19] a true Prophet there's over an hour and
[11:21] a half of teaching there showing
[11:24] specific examples starting at the
[11:26] beginning of Bam's recordings going all
[11:28] the way through the Church age book
[11:30] which would be the end of
[11:33] 1965 the next video was brother Ram's
[11:35] hum side welcomed correction plus who
[11:38] are you to correct God's Prophet this is
[11:40] over 30 minutes again of teaching from
[11:42] Brother Ram's quotes and the Bible on
[11:44] this important subject remember brother
[11:47] Ram said he could be corrected by his
[11:49] wife brother Neville other brothers in
[11:51] the congregation fact he's corrected
[11:54] live on a tape recording brother R was
[11:57] corrected by brother sheritt and
[11:58] appreciated it brother R made time for
[12:00] Baptist to try to correct him
[12:02] Pentecostals to try to correct him and
[12:04] I'll play this quote cuz this is a new
[12:06] quote that I don't think I put on the
[12:08] previous video on brother R's hum side
[12:10] welcome correction on January 19th 1965
[12:14] brother random preached the god who's
[12:15] rich in Mercy and he said it's a
[12:17] privilege to have the other preachers on
[12:19] the platform he said I feel kind of
[12:21] small to stand here and speak with such
[12:23] theologians behind me and maybe they
[12:25] will correct me if I'm wrong I hope so
[12:27] so brother Ram's either lying the truth
[12:30] or being sarcastic I believe he's being
[12:32] honest so again this quote would agree
[12:34] with all the other quotes from that
[12:35] video showing how brother Brandon
[12:37] welcomed correction because he realized
[12:39] he wasn't infallible of his own human
[12:41] thinking his human side was not
[12:43] infallible let's listen to the quote the
[12:46] friends that I've know for so many years
[12:49] it's certainly a privilege to see them
[12:50] here tonight I feel kind of small to
[12:53] stand here and speak with such
[12:54] theologians behind me and uh maybe
[12:58] they'll correct me when I'm
[13:01] wrong I hope
[13:04] so lastly there's a series of 24 plus
[13:08] brandom Tabernacle lies and there's a
[13:10] playlist with all these videos on my
[13:13] YouTube channel if you'd like to study
[13:15] this out deeper this is one of the most
[13:17] important studies I think I've ever done
[13:19] by the grace of God because it shows the
[13:22] insanity of the tape worship movement
[13:24] the Press Play and Obey false movement
[13:27] all 24 their lives Li are refuted by the
[13:31] scriptures and by other quotes from
[13:32] God's Prophet brother brandham the
[13:34] brandham Tabernacle has so many lies and
[13:37] attacks on the five-fold ministry and
[13:38] they repeatedly contradict quotes from
[13:41] The Prophet they claim to believe so
[13:43] again we rejoice in the truth of God's
[13:45] word and the holy life that God's
[13:48] Prophet brother random Liv the honest
[13:49] life the sincere life the Christian Life
[13:52] brother Rand
[13:53] lived in
[13:56] closing friends I hope this video was a
[13:58] blessing by the great of God again it's
[14:00] awesome to see how a true prophet of God
[14:01] prays he prays for God to correct his
[14:05] mistakes he's humble enough to realize
[14:07] he's human he makes mistakes he's not
[14:09] perfect The Human Side is never perfect
[14:11] but he loves the people so much and he
[14:13] loves the Lord so much he prays and asks
[14:15] the dear Lord to fix any mistakes he
[14:17] might have made and that's what God is
[14:18] constantly doing as we listen to brother
[14:21] Brandon we catch so many great truths
[14:22] but there's also times brother R makes
[14:24] mistakes most recently I saw this when I
[14:26] preached through the sermon the Rapture
[14:28] from December 4th 1965 there's two
[14:31] obvious mistakes in the sermon brother
[14:33] Ram said Enoch was the seventh from Noah
[14:36] and of course he made a mistake there
[14:38] not on purpose but because he was rushed
[14:40] the woman was trying to get them out of
[14:42] the hotel room now we find here that
[14:46] Enoch was the seventh from Noah which
[14:49] was a type of the church
[14:52] ages the Bible said Enoch was a seventh
[14:55] from Adam but brother Ram said Enoch was
[14:57] a seventh from Noah so again here's the
[15:00] scripture Jude 1:14 and Enoch also the
[15:03] 7eventh from Adam prophesied of
[15:06] these so anyone who knows the Bible
[15:08] timeline knows that Noah wasn't even
[15:10] born till around 60 or 70 years after
[15:13] Enoch was raptured so Enoch could not
[15:15] have been the seventh from Noah Enoch
[15:18] could not have been a descendant of Noah
[15:20] and anyone who would say Enoch was the
[15:22] seventh from Noah was thus sayi the Lord
[15:24] is insane they have an idolatrous Spirit
[15:26] they have a lying Spirit anointing them
[15:29] second brother Ram said the Rapture
[15:30] takes place in 2 Thessalonians he said
[15:33] we which are alive and remain will not
[15:35] prevent or hinder them that are asleep
[15:37] for the trumpet of God shall sound and
[15:39] the dead in Christ shall rise up the
[15:41] next Rapture takes place is second
[15:43] Thessalonians for the church the bride
[15:46] to be resurrected to be raptured into
[15:49] Glory we which are alive and remain
[15:52] that's the bodies left on Earth will not
[15:53] prevent or hinder them which are asleep
[15:56] for the trumpet of God shall sound first
[15:58] and the dead in Christ shall rise see
[16:01] and we which alive and remain shall
[16:03] caught up together with them of course
[16:05] brother ROM means first
[16:07] Thessalonians but he says this numerous
[16:09] times I think two or three times he
[16:11] calls it 2 Thessalonians 4 when it's
[16:13] actually first Thessalonians 4 so again
[16:16] to me this is God answering brother
[16:18] Ram's prayers from back then in real
[16:20] time as preachers preach the word of God
[16:23] and they they hear the Teaching Ministry
[16:25] the teaching Reign Ministry the more
[16:27] Reign from Joel 2
[16:30] 23-26 as we're receiving the teaching
[16:32] Reign from God's Prophet brother brandom
[16:34] and awaiting the latter rain rapturing
[16:36] faith God is answering the prayer of
[16:38] brother Bram that the Holy Ghost
[16:40] corrects these things in our hearts so
[16:43] again God is so faithful to be still
[16:45] answering his prophet's prayers right
[16:47] here in
[16:48] 2024 again this reminds me of 2
[16:51] Chronicles 36 veres 15-1 17 God sent
[16:56] them by his Messengers because he had
[16:58] had compassion on his people and yet
[17:01] people will still mock The Messengers of
[17:03] God and despise his words and misuse His
[17:06] prophets so these two quotes from God's
[17:08] Prophet brother Brandon prove God was
[17:10] having compassion on his people brother
[17:12] Brandon prayed compassionately that any
[17:14] human mistakes he made would be fixed by
[17:16] the holy ghost in the hearts of the Holy
[17:18] Ghost filled Believers which we know is
[17:20] happening right now praise the Lord for
[17:22] his grace and
[17:23] mercy if you have any questions concerns
[17:26] or testimonies about this video please
[17:27] contact me
[17:29] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[17:31] the desire of your heart
