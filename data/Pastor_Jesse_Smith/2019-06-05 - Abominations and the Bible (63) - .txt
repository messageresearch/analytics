Description:
Abominations are disgusting things in God's sight, mentioned 166 times in the King James Version. God has moral laws against abominations and most of them apply to New Testament Christians because God's immutable character always has and always will detest abominable acts. No abomination will enter the Holy City, the New Jerusalem. This motivates Christians to shun abominations and serve God reverently and humbly in the fear of the Lord. 

This video shows 3 abominations that no longer pertain to Christians because of Christ's work on Calvary.  There are 16 abominations covered on this video that still pertain to Christians.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the match's name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer the question do Old Testament abominations apply to Christians the answer is yes in most cases but there are a few exceptions which I will teach in this video the reason these abominations still applies because the Holy Ghost gives New Testament bible scriptures that keep these moral laws against abominations in effect for Christians with two or three witnesses definition and scope an abomination is one specific type of moral law that means a disgusting thing in the sight of God according to the Hebrew lexicon Deuteronomy 12 verse 31 states that God hates abominations God's holy Eternal City the New Jerusalem will not have any abominable work within its domain since there are 166 scriptures that mention abominations it behooves us to know which acts are abominations in the sight of God today because we want to live in the New Jerusalem with Christ for all eternity three fulfilled abominations for Christians after eating all 166 abomination scriptures I have found three Old Testament abominations that are no longer abominable in the sight of God for the New Testament believer eating a peace offering on the third day offering a blemished animal sacrifice and eating unclean foods eating a peace offering on the third day is no longer an abomination because New Testament believers are no longer required to offer animal sacrifices as Jesus Christ was the once-for-all sacrifice that God has provided for believers Jesus is both our offering and peace as we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ offering a blemish animal sacrifice is no longer an abomination in the New Testament because we have already established that God gave us the offering of the body of Jesus Christ to replace the blood of bulls and goats but it is important to note that our worship in the New Testament must be according to the spirit and truth or else the worship is offered in vain there's a spiritual application of this Old Testament abomination that we can apply to our worship today as we must offer our bodies as a living sacrifice unto God unclean foods from the Israeli diet are no longer abominations for the New Testament believer as evidenced through Peters heavenly vision in acts 10 verses 9 to 18 the fact that God did away with these dietary abominations was so surprising that Peter told the Lord not so three times after the Lord instructed him to rise kill and eat all manner of four-footed beasts wild beasts creeping things and fowls of the air Paul's teaching supports God's visions to Peter saying for every creature of God is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with Thanksgiving for it is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer the dietary restrictions for Christians are not eating blood strangled animals or foods dedicated unto idols abominations still in effect for Christians here is a partial list of the abominations that still remain detestable to God and the New Testament believer and are categorized as moral laws still in effect for Jews and Christians note that each abomination has at least two or three witnesses according to the rule for establishing an Old Testament moral law as a binding command for the New Testament believer justifying sin proverbs 17:15 2nd Thessalonians 2 10 to 12 Jude 1 verse 4 homosexuality 1st Corinthians 6:9 Romans 1 verses 26 to 32 first Timothy 1:10 idolatry and graven images Galatians 5 verses 20 to 21 Revelation chapter 13 verses 14 and 15 chapter 21 verse 8 chapter 22 verses 14 and 15 murder deuteronomy 1231 Revelation 21 verse 8 witchcraft Deuteronomy 18 verses 11 and 12 Galatians chapter 5 verses 20 and 21 worshiping with a wicked heart proverbs 15:8 Matthew 7 verses 21 to 23 diverse weights and measures or extortion Deuteronomy chapter 25 verses 13 through 16 1st Corinthians 6 verse 10 froward perverse or wicked thoughts hearts or ways proverbs 3 verse 32 15 verse 9 and 15 verse 26 acts 20 verses 29 to 37 abominations of proverbs chapter 6 verses 16 through 19 pride lying murder wicked thoughts pursuing mischief a false witness and sowing discord according to 1st John 2:16 revelation 21 verse 8 Romans 1 29 to 32 Acts 1310 romans 13:9 and romans 16 verses 17 and 18 crossdressing deuteronomy 22:5 Malachi 3:6 Hebrews 4:15 and Hebrews 13:8 to better understand the abomination of crossdressing please see my video called long dresses in the Bible another video that will help you understand this abomination is my video called the four guidelines for modest clothing guideline number three is gender specific clothing God wants men to wear men's clothing and women to wear women's clothing cross-dressing is called an abomination or disgusting thing and no New Testament scripture permits it the reason cross-dressing remains detestable in the New Testament is because God said he is unchanging according to Malachi 3:6 his holy nature of hoard all evil abominable acts yesterday and abhors them today and will abhor them forever for Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever notice that Jesus never crossed dressed like a woman Hebrews 4:15 teaches that Jesus never broke one Old Testament commandment since cross-dressing was strictly forbidden the law of Moses Jesus never wore clothes that pertain to a woman furthermore Jesus instituted the New Testament and the kingdom of God upon this earth while wearing men's garments Jesus modeled and lived this standard during his earthly life if Jesus is the same forever then he will remain dressed like a man forever throughout time and then into eternity in closing I hope this video was a blessing and enlighten your eyes about the revelations in the Bible concerning abominations God's immutable character allows us to rightly divide the word of God about the actions that either gain his approval or disapproval blessing or curse as Satan increases his attacks against the true church faithful Bible teachers need to continue giving more of their time focus attention and energy into denouncing abominations and feeding the people of God the truth true doctrine will say both the preacher and those that believe him if you have any questions about abominations or any other Bible questions please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
