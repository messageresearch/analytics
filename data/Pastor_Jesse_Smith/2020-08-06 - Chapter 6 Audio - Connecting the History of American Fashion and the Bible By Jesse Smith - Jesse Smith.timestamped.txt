[0:03] american fashion
[0:04] and the bible includes footnotes numbers
[0:09] 316-394
[0:11] that thou keep this commandment without
[0:13] spot unrebukable
[0:15] until the appearing of our lord jesus
[0:17] christ first timothy 6
[0:19] 14 connecting the history of american
[0:23] fashion to the bible
[0:24] requires an in-depth study this chapter
[0:27] is devoted to this essential endeavor
[0:30] you'll learn when and why americans
[0:32] forsook modesty
[0:34] but first i will share a bit about my
[0:35] personal testimony
[0:37] and research into modesty joyful
[0:40] research
[0:42] researching for this chapter was an
[0:44] absolute labor of love for me
[0:46] and occurred over the course of the past
[0:47] two decades
[0:49] when i first heard about the bible
[0:50] standards for a holy outward appearance
[0:52] in 2001
[0:54] i was excited to be able to prove to my
[0:56] friends and family
[0:57] that all these new teachings were
[0:58] biblical and historically accurate
[1:02] i wanted everyone to be enlightened by
[1:04] these new bible truths as i had been
[1:06] my enlightenment immediately transformed
[1:08] my own outward appearance
[1:10] as my new love for jesus was most easily
[1:13] expressed in how i could change my
[1:15] appearance
[1:16] to glorify him i was going to hold
[1:18] nothing back
[1:19] i was willing to cut my long hair start
[1:22] covering my thighs by wearing only long
[1:24] pants
[1:25] and abstain from taking off my shirt and
[1:28] showing off my chest
[1:30] as i now reflect upon these changes i
[1:32] can see that they were
[1:33] the natural outworking of the inward
[1:35] change
[1:36] that had already taken place in my heart
[1:39] through the cross
[1:39] of christ for the first time in my life
[1:44] as a new christian
[1:45] and a college student i found trips to
[1:47] the library
[1:48] exhilarating my fiancee now wife
[1:52] and i spent hours digging through
[1:54] university libraries
[1:55] to search its books encyclopedias and
[1:58] almanacs
[1:59] in order to prove all things about a
[2:01] modest outward appearance
[2:03] now i have a three-ring binder filled
[2:05] with the findings as a witness
[2:07] that this nation once honored god's word
[2:09] about modest clothing
[2:11] but is drastically backslidden
[2:14] my joy to research the truths of the
[2:16] bible and connect them to american
[2:18] history
[2:18] came from a long desire i had to serve
[2:21] god
[2:23] as a child i knew god was real in 1988
[2:26] as a second grade student
[2:28] god supernaturally healed my mother of
[2:30] cancer without any radiation treatments
[2:33] and she is alive today by the mercy of
[2:35] our savior jesus christ
[2:38] after her healing my mother took all six
[2:40] of her children to different churches in
[2:42] the toledo area
[2:43] testifying of god's healing power at
[2:46] each church i heard again and again
[2:48] about the power of jesus christ
[2:50] i always believed in god's power but
[2:52] never experienced repentance for myself
[2:54] during that time
[2:57] in the next decade after my mother was
[2:59] healed i grew into an adolescent
[3:02] passionate about sports
[3:03] rather than christ i selected friends
[3:06] that had the same
[3:07] selfish sinful interests as i and i ran
[3:10] from god's call for my life
[3:12] during this time my mother would
[3:14] faithfully take all six of her children
[3:16] to church
[3:17] every sunday and wednesday many times i
[3:20] wanted to surrender to jesus's call all
[3:22] my life
[3:23] but i could not let go of the world's
[3:24] attractions
[3:26] my change from a sinner to saint did not
[3:28] occur until i moved away from everyone i
[3:30] knew
[3:31] and attended the university of akron i
[3:34] repented of my sins at an athletes in
[3:36] action winter conference
[3:38] in december of 1999 about two years
[3:41] later in the fall of 2001
[3:43] i heard the truce about a modest outward
[3:45] appearance
[3:46] i learned in amazement the guidelines
[3:48] for modest clothing
[3:50] and how tattoos make up high heels and
[3:53] other accessories
[3:54] were condemned by the bible i thought
[3:56] that if everyone could hear the truth i
[3:58] heard
[3:58] they would quickly repent surely all my
[4:01] female friends and family members
[4:03] would no longer cut their hair wear
[4:05] makeup nor wear pants right
[4:08] all my male friends would never get
[4:10] tattoos nor wear in modest shorts right
[4:13] boy was i wrong next came a separation
[4:17] time between my closest friends and i
[4:19] as my bible beliefs produced a new
[4:21] course of conduct in my life
[4:23] it was painful but essential my best
[4:26] friend at the time wrote to me in an
[4:28] email
[4:28] that the devil was showing me the new
[4:30] doctrines i was believing
[4:32] i felt heartbroken but i could not deny
[4:34] the literal words of the bible
[4:36] about each teaching this separation led
[4:40] to a hunger to understand why the world
[4:42] was in its rebellious condition why
[4:44] wouldn't my friends
[4:45] family and country believe the plain
[4:47] concise words in the holy bible
[4:50] when and why did the masses turn from
[4:52] the holy ways of the lord
[4:54] the search for these answers became the
[4:56] driving motivation behind my library
[4:58] research
[4:59] it seemed god led me to the right
[5:01] library books and even brought them
[5:03] into my education courses i was taking
[5:06] at the university
[5:07] i felt as if god himself was proving to
[5:09] me that his bible standards were the
[5:11] absolute truth
[5:13] and all witnesses pointed to this fact
[5:18] the history of separate garments
[5:20] separate garments for men and women is
[5:22] usually the first noticeable
[5:24] difference between christians and the
[5:25] world my family has lots of first-hand
[5:28] experience with looking different
[5:30] as we have seven females all in skirts
[5:33] and two males both in pants the first
[5:36] record of god requiring separate
[5:38] garments for men and women
[5:39] is found in the book of the law given to
[5:41] moses around 1400 bc
[5:44] god told moses that crossdressing was an
[5:46] abomination
[5:48] a disgusting thing in his sight clothing
[5:50] provided order for gender
[5:52] government and culture without a
[5:55] separation of clothing
[5:56] god knew that seeds of confusion would
[5:58] be planted into the fabric of society
[6:01] these seeds of discrepancy would quickly
[6:03] grow into corruptible fruits
[6:05] which is what we are seeing today
[6:07] through the transgender
[6:08] and lgbt movements these groups have
[6:12] launched a complete assault
[6:14] on god's creative design and order for
[6:16] male and females
[6:18] established from the beginning of
[6:19] creation sadly
[6:21] these modern sodomites will only be
[6:23] stopped by the fire and brimstone
[6:25] of god's righteous wrath just like the
[6:28] fate of sodom and gomorrah
[6:31] believers must keep reaching out to them
[6:33] in hopes to save all
[6:35] who are ordained to eternal life
[6:38] faithful orthodox jews have honored
[6:40] separate male and female garments
[6:42] from the days of moses until today
[6:45] nearly 3400 years
[6:48] this standard has stood the test of time
[6:50] and even jesus christ himself
[6:52] who never broke one command of god never
[6:55] wore women's garments
[6:57] christians have also honored the
[6:58] separation of male and female garments
[7:01] for nearly 2 000 years from the days of
[7:04] the apostles until the present day
[7:06] just as god took cross-dressing
[7:08] seriously calling it an abomination
[7:11] faithful christians did the same greg
[7:14] and smith
[7:15] 2003 noted that in 17th century england
[7:19] a person of either sex could be hanged
[7:22] for dressing in the garments of the
[7:23] opposite sex
[7:25] as christianity spread to north america
[7:28] the laws of the land
[7:29] upheld this command enforcing
[7:31] punishments like
[7:32] prison time and fines for those who
[7:35] cross-dressed
[7:36] unfortunately cross-dressing became
[7:38] socially acceptable
[7:40] around the 1960s and 1970s
[7:43] but faithful christians have never
[7:44] stopped honoring deuteronomy 22
[7:47] verse 5.
[7:51] ancient hebrew clothing since
[7:53] deuteronomy 22 verse 5
[7:55] forbids cross-dressing what were the
[7:57] differences between the male and female
[7:59] garments
[8:01] they were similar in one way but
[8:02] different in a number of ways
[8:05] their outer garments were similar in
[8:06] that they were both robes
[8:08] that is where the similarities end
[8:10] though as the female robes were much
[8:12] longer
[8:13] with enough border and fringe to cover
[8:16] their feet
[8:18] the front of a woman's robe was long
[8:19] enough for her to tuck it
[8:21] up over her girdle to serve as an apron
[8:25] male and female outer garments were also
[8:27] different in style
[8:29] and could be easily differentiated at
[8:31] first glance
[8:33] as men's garments resembled a coat-like
[8:35] cloak
[8:37] although both sexes wore girdles men's
[8:39] girdles were more prominent
[8:41] and important because they carried money
[8:43] and other necessities
[8:45] men's girdles also served to fasten
[8:47] their swords to their bodies
[8:50] based upon these differences an
[8:52] individual's gender was
[8:54] instantly detectable at first glance to
[8:56] the onlooker
[8:58] female robes were much longer and and
[9:00] male and female styles
[9:02] were noticeably different by god's holy
[9:04] design
[9:05] our lord wants to keep reverential order
[9:08] among his people
[9:09] with no gender confusion
[9:14] united states fashion history by century
[9:17] and decade
[9:19] i will now summarize and provide
[9:20] specific details about the fashion
[9:23] changes in the united states
[9:25] during the 19th and 20th centuries due
[9:28] to fewer societal changes
[9:30] the 19th century is its own section
[9:33] separate
[9:34] from the 20th century in the 20th
[9:36] century
[9:37] each decade is described separately
[9:39] while highlighting
[9:40] the rapid increase of scriptures that
[9:42] were being broken
[9:45] the 19th century the majority of
[9:48] americans kept the bible commands
[9:50] for an outward appearance during the
[9:52] 19th century
[9:53] but prostitutes and other small groups
[9:55] of women were guilty of breaking these
[9:57] commands
[9:58] prostitutes broke at least three of the
[10:00] four guidelines for modest clothing
[10:03] as they exposed their body parts that
[10:05] god considered nakedness
[10:06] wore skin tight clothes and cross
[10:09] dressed in men's clothing
[10:11] these immoral ones were also part of the
[10:14] minority who wore makeup
[10:16] from mid to late century small groups of
[10:19] women began wearing the pants
[10:20] skirt bloomer costume which broke the
[10:23] command of deuteronomy 22 verse 5.
[10:26] the invention of the bicycle and the
[10:28] freedoms it offered caused some women
[10:30] to cross-dress with the excuses of
[10:32] comfort and function
[10:34] but the move stalled out by the end of
[10:36] the century
[10:37] specific details cross-dressing was
[10:40] against the law and was punishable
[10:42] by arrest and imprisonment women wearing
[10:46] pants
[10:46] in public was a deviant behavior
[10:49] in the united states the idea of women
[10:51] wearing pants of any kind
[10:53] caused an immediate and prolonged uproar
[10:57] it was very bad taste for a female to
[10:59] wear men's clothes or look masculine in
[11:02] any way
[11:04] prostitutes were known for wearing tight
[11:06] form-fitting pants
[11:07] and showed their bloomers or underwear
[11:09] to attract men
[11:11] society associated women in pants with
[11:13] prostitution
[11:15] prostitutes who worked in theaters
[11:17] revealed their flesh
[11:18] especially their legs amelia bloomer
[11:21] helped explode a public controversy
[11:23] about dress reform
[11:25] when she suggested women wear men's
[11:27] trousers
[11:28] under a short skirt in the summer of
[11:30] 1851
[11:32] the majority of people rejected this
[11:34] idea because of the bible command of
[11:36] deuteronomy 22 verse 5
[11:38] which was preached by the clergy
[11:41] bloomers did gain some converts in the
[11:43] 1850s
[11:44] but the backlash was so strong that
[11:47] amelia bloomer and her colleagues gave
[11:49] up the fight
[11:50] bloomers were associated with communal
[11:52] groups that believed in free love
[11:55] i.e adultery and fornication and kept
[11:58] bloomers from being widely adopted
[12:03] amelia bloomer began to wear dresses
[12:05] made like other fashionable dresses
[12:07] but with one shocking difference the
[12:10] skirts were knee length
[12:11] a proper woman did not reveal her legs
[12:14] however
[12:15] even when swimming women and girls
[12:17] covered up with long wool trousers
[12:19] beneath bathing dresses
[12:21] the bicycle craze had a more lasting
[12:24] impact on women's clothing
[12:25] than just the use of bloomers
[12:28] in the late 19th century the bicycle
[12:31] impacted fashion
[12:32] causing women to abandon frilly skirts
[12:34] and corsets
[12:36] in favor of sensible bloomers
[12:39] the women's education move of the 1870s
[12:42] permitted female students to cross-dress
[12:45] during performances
[12:46] but most did not allow men to attend
[12:48] those shows
[12:51] with makeup frowned upon women drank
[12:53] vinegar and ate chalk
[12:54] to achieve a pale complexion
[12:58] in the 19th century women continued to
[13:00] wear their hair long and pull back from
[13:02] the face
[13:03] usually piled atop the head
[13:08] the 20th century during the first half
[13:10] of the 20th century
[13:12] the majority of americans honored god's
[13:14] standards for modest clothing and a holy
[13:16] outward appearance
[13:17] the roaring 20s was the exception as
[13:20] millions of women for the first time
[13:22] cut their hair wore makeup and exposed
[13:25] parts of their bodies that their parents
[13:26] and grandparents
[13:27] would not have dreamed of exposing these
[13:30] rebellious ones
[13:31] called flappers joined sinful men and
[13:34] smoked
[13:35] drank danced and arrogantly defied the
[13:37] following scriptures
[13:39] second kings 9 30 jeremiah 4 30
[13:43] ezekiel 23 40 first corinthians 3 17
[13:47] first corinthians 11 1-16 galatians 5
[13:51] 21 first thessalonians 5 7
[13:54] 1st timothy 2 9 and 1 john 2 15.
[13:58] the great depression caused a financial
[14:00] crisis that sent
[14:01] most americans back to a humble way of
[14:04] life
[14:04] including fashion choices throughout the
[14:06] 1940s and 1950s
[14:10] the second half of the 20th century saw
[14:11] the majority of americans
[14:13] completely reject a biblical modest
[14:16] outward appearance
[14:17] the sexual revolution emphasized free
[14:19] love unisex
[14:21] dressing and hairstyles and led to the
[14:23] full acceptance of cross-dressing
[14:25] in the 1970s the backsliding trend was
[14:28] unstoppable through the 1980s and 1990s
[14:32] as nearly every body part came into full
[14:34] view
[14:35] on america's streets and beaches
[14:38] americans abandoned even more scripture
[14:41] including deuteronomy 22 5 proverbs 7
[14:44] 10 romans 1 26 and 27
[14:47] first thessalonians 4 3 and revelation 3
[14:50] verse 17.
[14:56] the 1910s during world war 1 many women
[15:00] wore
[15:00] pants while working in factories and
[15:02] experienced financial independence
[15:05] while the men were away fighting in the
[15:06] war after the war
[15:08] most women went back to wearing dresses
[15:10] and their previous lifestyles
[15:12] but seeds of change had been planted
[15:15] skirt lengths
[15:16] shortened specific details
[15:20] women would not be caught dead wearing
[15:21] pants in public at the time of the first
[15:24] world war by 1915
[15:27] skirts had shortened to the ankle the
[15:30] united states entered world war 1
[15:33] 1914 to 1918 in june
[15:36] 1917. for the first time women joined
[15:39] the american armed services
[15:41] civilian women performed a wide variety
[15:44] of wartime jobs
[15:45] most worked in ankle length dresses some
[15:49] especially in factories and on farms
[15:51] opted to wear trousers
[15:53] fashion for women again appeared in
[15:55] turmoil should women
[15:57] abandon pants and return to pre-war
[15:59] styles
[16:00] wearing the pants in the family meant
[16:02] being in charge
[16:04] with husbands and fathers back home
[16:07] women and pants
[16:07] returned to dresses but change was in
[16:10] the air
[16:14] the 1920s the roaring 20s was the first
[16:17] time in american history
[16:18] in which millions of women publicly
[16:20] transgressed
[16:22] god's commands for a modest outward
[16:24] appearance
[16:25] for the first time women cut their hair
[16:27] wore makeup and adopted seductive
[16:29] and luxurious fashions the only force
[16:32] that could
[16:33] and did slow down this immoral trend was
[16:35] the great depression
[16:37] which god seemingly allowed to humble
[16:39] the nation
[16:42] specific details women bobbed their hair
[16:45] and the hemlines of their skirts
[16:47] raised to the knee some women wore
[16:49] trousers in public
[16:50] blurring the gender lines in order to
[16:53] both express
[16:54] lesbian desires and their equality with
[16:56] men
[16:58] in august 1920 after decades of lost
[17:01] battles
[17:02] american women won the right to vote
[17:04] through the 19th amendment to the u.s
[17:06] constitution women's new freedom at the
[17:09] ballot box
[17:10] soon mirrored a new freedom in clothes
[17:14] short hair and simple hats brought
[17:16] freedom from the anxiety
[17:18] of keeping a huge or elaborate hat
[17:20] pinned
[17:21] to an equally elaborate hairstyle women
[17:24] cut their hair and everyone said
[17:26] how practical the woman instinctively
[17:29] realized
[17:30] that here was a passport to freedom in
[17:32] daily life
[17:33] which he was not going to let go the
[17:36] convenience of short hair
[17:37] has been appreciated by many women ever
[17:40] since the bob
[17:41] the shingle and eaton crop of the 1920s
[17:47] rouse noted that changes were not all
[17:49] liberating
[17:50] but some actually became a form of
[17:52] slavery such as wearing makeup
[17:54] she wrote it was now in 1929
[17:58] commonplace for women to wear makeup in
[18:01] the victorian period it had been
[18:02] considered immoral to paint
[18:04] one's face and many older people still
[18:07] subscribe to this view
[18:09] but now women could be seen everywhere
[18:11] pouting at their compact mirror
[18:14] in an attempt to achieve the desired
[18:16] cupid's bow
[18:17] with the aid of lipstick and dabbing at
[18:19] their noses with a powder puff
[18:22] the advent of hollywood and its stars
[18:24] had made the open use of cosmetics
[18:27] acceptable but it also brought a new
[18:29] bondage for women
[18:30] that of trying to look like someone else
[18:35] the new decade of the roaring twenties
[18:38] transformed young women's fashion as
[18:40] never before
[18:41] for the first time women grabbed their
[18:43] long hair which had always been so
[18:45] time consuming to style and snipped it
[18:47] off
[18:48] bobbed hair was all the rage the boyish
[18:51] bob
[18:52] was chin length or even shorter a sleek
[18:55] cut that swung close to the face
[18:57] the bob called for a hat that also
[18:59] hugged the head
[19:01] the flapper painted on lipstick and
[19:03] rouge produced by
[19:05] companies run by women such as helen
[19:07] rubinstein and elizabeth arden
[19:10] although women hid their curves in the
[19:12] tubular silhouette
[19:13] dresses with no waistline they revealed
[19:16] more skin
[19:17] all through the decades skirts inched
[19:19] higher and higher
[19:20] some states considered fines for dresses
[19:23] shorter than three inches above the
[19:24] ankle
[19:25] but the trend was irreversible by 1926
[19:29] women's dresses rose for the first time
[19:32] above the knee
[19:33] bathing costumes shrank to sleeveless
[19:36] tank suits
[19:37] by the 1920s skirts for women were short
[19:42] not only were women's clothes changing
[19:44] many women now had short hair and wore
[19:46] makeup after world war one ended
[19:50] big changes were afoot not only had
[19:52] women won the right to vote
[19:54] but dancer irene castle had bobbed her
[19:57] hair
[19:58] as the 1920s roared in more and more
[20:00] women headed for beauty shops to have
[20:02] their hair bobbed
[20:03] at the time few women were eager to have
[20:05] their bobs done in a barber shop
[20:07] with a row of men watching and
[20:09] snickering in many cases this would be
[20:12] the biggest decision
[20:13] the woman would ever make to cut off a
[20:16] lifetime growth of hair
[20:17] knowing her husband father or boyfriend
[20:20] was dead set against it
[20:22] in our town this new style shingle cut
[20:26] seemed to usher in the flapper age next
[20:29] came short skirts
[20:30] rolled down hoes discarded corsets and
[20:33] cigarette smoking
[20:35] it was like a revolution
[20:39] in 1922 a washington dc beach
[20:43] had officials check the bather swimsuits
[20:46] to be sure they were no more than six
[20:48] inches above the knee
[20:52] chicago police arrested women wearing
[20:54] revealing bathing suits
[20:56] for indecent exposure in 1922
[21:02] the 1930s in the 1930s the great
[21:05] depression affected most americans
[21:07] causing some to return to their humble
[21:09] lifestyles and modest expressions of
[21:12] fashion
[21:13] while god was drawing his little flock
[21:15] back to himself
[21:16] satan used his economic downturn to lure
[21:19] millions
[21:20] into inexpensive movie theaters
[21:22] hollywood's evil influence multiplied
[21:24] during this era
[21:26] especially in the area of makeup women
[21:28] came into the new bondage of imitating
[21:30] the facial cosmetics
[21:32] of female movie stars women followed
[21:35] hollywood rather than god's word
[21:37] breaking the command to imitate god be
[21:40] therefore
[21:41] followers or imitators of god as dear
[21:44] children
[21:47] there were a few famous women renegades
[21:49] who dared to defy the bible commands for
[21:51] modest clothing
[21:52] but their impact had little effect on
[21:54] the majority of americans
[21:56] most women continued to wear long skirts
[21:59] and dresses
[22:00] specific details katherine hepburn and
[22:04] marlene dietrich
[22:05] were some of the first women to wear
[22:07] men's pants publicly
[22:09] in the 1930s and 1940s
[22:12] marlene dietrich made international
[22:14] headlines in 1933
[22:16] when she appeared off screen in men's
[22:18] clothing the paris chief of police
[22:21] threatened to make her leave town
[22:22] if she continued to wear pants so
[22:25] dietrich changed into a skirt
[22:27] but still wore a man's collar tie and
[22:30] hat
[22:33] to ease the sting of economic burdens
[22:36] americans looked to hollywood
[22:37] more than 85 million people a week
[22:40] escaped their troubles in darkened movie
[22:42] theaters
[22:43] many fans imitated the polished makeup
[22:46] of film stars
[22:47] plucked eyebrows dark lipstick gleaming
[22:52] fingernails
[22:54] as much as possible women also emulated
[22:57] the clothing of the movie queens men
[23:00] also copied their idols
[23:02] clark gable took off his shirt in one
[23:04] movie and revealed that he had no
[23:05] undershirt beneath since not wearing an
[23:08] undershirt
[23:09] was a fashion anyone could immediately
[23:11] afford
[23:12] undershirt sales plummeted
[23:15] hollywood popularized an image of
[23:18] fitness
[23:19] it became fashionable to show off a
[23:21] well-toned body
[23:22] for swimming men abandoned tank suits
[23:25] that covered their chests
[23:26] and for the first time appeared at
[23:28] beaches bare-chested
[23:30] some women tossed out their long tennis
[23:32] dresses and copied
[23:33] tennis champ alice marble who in 1933
[23:37] dared to wear shorts in wimbledon
[23:42] hollywood also promoted the tan for
[23:44] centuries women had
[23:46] prized a pale complexion as a symbol of
[23:48] leisure
[23:49] people who got tan worked outdoors doing
[23:52] manual labor
[23:58] the 1940s and 1950s
[24:01] by the 1940s and 1950s most americans
[24:05] were still dressing modestly but skirt
[24:07] lengths for women
[24:08] kept rising inch by inch famous female
[24:11] actresses continued to cross-dress in
[24:13] men's pants
[24:15] other rebels were wearing two-piece
[24:16] bathing suits but those outlandish
[24:19] fashions were not the norm yet
[24:23] specific details shocking the most
[24:27] shocking new style of all was the
[24:28] two-piece bathing suit
[24:30] which used far less fabric than the most
[24:32] modest one-piece suit
[24:34] popular before the war high school style
[24:39] 1949-1959
[24:41] although uniforms were not required at
[24:43] american schools
[24:44] teen girls developed their own the skirt
[24:47] either full or pencil shaped
[24:49] finishing just below the knee and
[24:51] sweater or fitted top
[24:53] pants and jeans were forbidden the
[24:56] styles of the 1950s provided a physical
[24:58] barrier between the sexes
[25:00] which was the same approach as the
[25:02] victorian era
[25:04] the styles made it seem the clothes were
[25:06] not easily removed
[25:08] audrey hepburn wore capri pants in the
[25:10] 1950s
[25:13] the 1960s the sexual revolution of the
[25:17] 1960s
[25:18] literally changed everything in fashion
[25:20] for the majority of americans
[25:22] in this decade the godly standards for
[25:24] outward appearance began to fall
[25:25] drastically
[25:26] mini skirts rose far above the knee for
[25:29] the first time
[25:30] exposing more flesh than ever little
[25:33] clothing was being worn and the material
[25:35] was light
[25:36] fashions focused on sexual availability
[25:40] by the end of the decade two major
[25:41] trends defied god's law about
[25:43] cross-dressing
[25:45] first unisex fashions created a sense of
[25:47] confusion
[25:48] amongst the youth second levi's created
[25:52] its division for women's pants
[25:54] in 1968 making pants readily available
[25:57] for women
[25:58] for the first time ever it is noteworthy
[26:01] that in the early 1960s
[26:03] the supreme court removed prayer and
[26:05] bible reading from public schools
[26:07] the results of removing jesus christ and
[26:10] his standards
[26:11] for modest clothing from schools has
[26:13] been decreased
[26:14] academic achievement increased crime
[26:17] drug use
[26:18] and sexual immorality
[26:21] specific details clothing style
[26:24] suggested
[26:25] accessibility and sexual availability
[26:28] prominent zips and fastenings made it
[26:30] seem clothing was easily removed
[26:33] lighter clothing and much less clothing
[26:35] became popular
[26:37] pant suits became increasingly popular
[26:39] during the 1960s and 1970s
[26:42] skirt length was the most important
[26:44] fashion consideration
[26:46] for the majority of americans unisex
[26:49] dressing was a new trend
[26:51] in part due to the hippie movement women
[26:54] wore men's jeans and shirts in the 1960s
[26:58] some men grew their hair out like women
[27:00] and were suspended from school
[27:01] or lost their jobs in real life the
[27:05] biggest trend in women's fashion was the
[27:06] miniskirt
[27:08] introduced in london boutiques by
[27:10] designer mary quant
[27:11] and others the mini had a hemline eight
[27:15] or nine
[27:15] inches above the knee exposing more skin
[27:18] than any previous skirt
[27:20] the young recognized no boundaries and
[27:22] feel no commitments
[27:23] proclaimed a new york times magazine
[27:26] article
[27:27] short skirts some say are a sign
[27:30] but how are women supposed to sit or
[27:32] bend without exposing more than they
[27:33] wished
[27:35] patterned tights and the first pantyhose
[27:37] resolved that problem
[27:38] but not another
[27:43] the hippies dress reflected their break
[27:45] with society
[27:46] carefree lifestyles including drug use
[27:49] sexual promiscuity
[27:51] both sexes wore jeans sandals and
[27:53] flowing
[27:54] captains young males grew their hair to
[27:57] shoulder length
[27:58] older folks complained that they
[28:00] couldn't tell the boys from the girls
[28:02] men's clothes have become an
[28:03] approximation of women's
[28:05] and women's clothes copy men's one
[28:08] psychologist noted
[28:10] when clothes express such confused roles
[28:12] society is in big trouble
[28:16] british designer mary quant was the
[28:18] first to introduce dresses above the
[28:20] knee
[28:20] in 1960 women goop their eyes with black
[28:25] eyeliner and colored eye
[28:26] shadow the short skirts and low waists
[28:30] of the 1920s were again
[28:31] fashionable in the 1960s london's mod
[28:35] look
[28:36] from carnaby street of the 1960s led to
[28:39] an erratic era of fluctuating hemlines
[28:42] and unisex fashions
[28:45] but if the woman's hair was getting
[28:46] shorter some men were wearing their hair
[28:48] longer hairstyles for some young people
[28:51] became
[28:52] almost identical stemming from the
[28:55] unisex fashions by futuristic designers
[28:58] such as pierre cardin and andre kurigi's
[29:03] fashionable women began wearing pants in
[29:05] the 1960s and 70s
[29:08] the sexual revolution of women's lib
[29:10] meant that women were taking greater
[29:12] strides
[29:13] to enter the workforce and as a result
[29:15] they borrowed more from men's fashion
[29:18] french designer yves saint laurent
[29:21] ysl first created his sleek but
[29:24] controversial
[29:26] lay smoking tuxedo suit for women in
[29:29] 1966
[29:30] and continued to create androgynous
[29:33] styles each season
[29:34] the look slowly became more widely
[29:36] accepted as an alternative to skirts and
[29:39] dresses
[29:41] the 1970s the main fashion theme of the
[29:44] 1970s
[29:46] was women wearing pants during the early
[29:48] part of the decade
[29:49] companies and fine restaurants would not
[29:51] allow women to wear pants in their
[29:53] establishments
[29:54] but their standards eventually weakened
[29:57] and cross-dressing
[29:58] became a part of everyday life public
[30:01] teachers unions
[30:02] played a big role in allowing women
[30:04] teachers to begin wearing pants to
[30:06] school
[30:07] women and pants hit prime time
[30:08] television as well
[30:10] as mary tyler moore was the first woman
[30:12] to wear pants on a television sitcom
[30:16] specific details one word can sum up
[30:19] women's fashion in the 70s
[30:21] pants women wearing pants was their
[30:24] solution to the problem
[30:25] of previous decades about how long
[30:28] dresses and skirts should be
[30:30] most fine restaurants in the early 1970s
[30:33] would not allow women to enter
[30:35] if they were dressed in pants
[30:39] public school teacher unions helped
[30:40] women gain the right to wear pants to
[30:42] school
[30:43] in the early 1970s as long as the
[30:46] material and color match the top
[30:49] trouser outfits were finally acceptable
[30:51] as everyday wear
[30:52] but not in the majority women and pants
[30:55] saw the hemline controversy
[30:58] unisex clothes were advertised in london
[31:00] and discussion arose about the
[31:02] psychological
[31:03] implications that would result
[31:06] in the early 1970s it was common to see
[31:09] men and women dressed identically
[31:11] in unisex fashion with the same
[31:13] hairstyles
[31:14] it was more common to see women
[31:16] borrowing from male fashion
[31:18] especially among feminists
[31:21] as the 1970s opened many women burned
[31:24] out on skirts by the mini
[31:26] began to wear pants pants sold so well
[31:29] that
[31:29] major designers added pant suits
[31:33] including some for elegant evening wear
[31:35] to their collections
[31:37] in 1968 levi's launched a division for
[31:40] gals
[31:41] some businesses began to accept female
[31:43] employees in pants one survey reported
[31:46] that macy's department store
[31:49] would not permit women employees in
[31:51] pants but the first
[31:52] national bank of boston would if they
[31:55] continue to act like women
[31:57] at t would keep an open mind for the
[32:00] first time in america's fashion history
[32:03] women began to have a real choice
[32:04] between dresses and pants
[32:06] mistress fuller or any woman of the
[32:09] 1600s or 1700s
[32:11] never would have dreamed of pulling on a
[32:13] pair of breeches
[32:16] mary tyler moore was the first woman to
[32:18] wear pants on a television sitcom in the
[32:20] 1970s
[32:22] the writers of her show limited her to
[32:25] one scene per show in which she could
[32:26] wear
[32:27] pants
[32:30] the no bra look became popular in the
[32:32] early 70s
[32:36] the 1980s and 1990s
[32:39] the 1980s and 1990s produced even more
[32:42] disobedience to god's standards for
[32:44] modest clothing
[32:45] major fashion statements were spread
[32:47] through the punk
[32:48] hip-hop grunge and goth movements
[32:52] the trends of cross-dressing and
[32:53] exposing more flesh were irreversible
[32:56] the most shocking of all fashion
[32:58] statements was in swimwear
[33:00] string bikinis and thongs revealed
[33:02] nearly every part of the human body
[33:04] satan had propagated and achieved a
[33:07] condition of complete nakedness
[33:09] and undress specific details
[33:13] the length of the skirts and dresses of
[33:16] women was no longer a major issue
[33:18] by the late 1980s
[33:22] fashion trends were made popular through
[33:24] the punk hip-hop grunge and goth
[33:26] movements
[33:28] on the beaches of america even more
[33:30] radical expressions like
[33:31] thongs reveal breasts and buttocks
[33:36] reaping the whirlwind the united states
[33:39] of america is in the same position that
[33:41] israel found itself in
[33:43] during the days of the prophet hosea
[33:46] awaiting the judgment
[33:47] and wrath of almighty god hosea warned
[33:50] northern israel of the pending judgments
[33:53] upon them for their breaking of god's
[33:55] covenant
[33:55] and their transgression of his laws
[33:58] around 750 bc
[34:01] the united states has done the same
[34:03] through the legalization of sin
[34:04] and the breaking of nearly every law of
[34:07] god including god's standards for a
[34:09] modest and holy outward appearance
[34:12] hosea stated the following words about
[34:14] israel's rebellion against god
[34:16] israel had sown the wind and would reap
[34:19] the whirlwind
[34:21] the phrase sowing the wind is a proverb
[34:23] from the agricultural practice of sowing
[34:26] and reaping
[34:26] or planting and harvesting sowing and
[34:29] reaping is a law of god
[34:31] whatever we plant in our lives we will
[34:33] harvest the consequences
[34:35] whether good or evil as galatians 6
[34:38] verses 6 and 7 teaches
[34:40] be not deceived god is not mocked for
[34:43] whatsoever a man soweth
[34:45] that shall he also reap for he that
[34:47] soweth to his flesh
[34:49] shall of the flesh reap corruption but
[34:51] he that soweth to the spirit
[34:53] shall of the spirit reap life
[34:55] everlasting
[34:58] israel had planted seeds of rebellion
[35:00] and disobedience against the commands of
[35:03] god
[35:03] and they were sure to multiply into an
[35:05] awful deadly harvest of the judgments of
[35:08] god
[35:09] the whirlwind came in 722 bc
[35:12] when the assyrian armies invaded the
[35:14] capital city of syria
[35:16] and carried the people of israel away
[35:18] into captivity
[35:21] the united states has also sown the wind
[35:23] remember that
[35:24] america upheld god's modesty standards
[35:27] for the outward appearance
[35:28] for a few hundred years but america has
[35:31] fallen
[35:32] from its love for god the historical
[35:34] facts from this chapter show
[35:36] that evil seeds of disobedience had been
[35:39] planted
[35:40] through the roaring twenties the sexual
[35:42] revolution of the 60s
[35:44] the cross-dressing move of the 70s and
[35:46] the state of
[35:47] undress of the 80s and 90s
[35:51] america is beginning to see a whirlwind
[35:53] develop in cities
[35:54] families governments businesses and
[35:57] communities
[35:58] all over this country it is the
[36:00] whirlwind of sexual abuse
[36:02] homosexuality and the transgender
[36:05] lifestyle
[36:06] the small seeds of undressing women
[36:08] cross-dressing
[36:10] and unisex fashions of the 1960s and
[36:12] 1970s
[36:14] that were planted into millions of mines
[36:16] have now matured into corruptable fruit
[36:19] a cultural majority that hates the truth
[36:21] of god's word
[36:23] and is worthy of the judgments of god
[36:26] the united states along with many other
[36:28] countries
[36:29] is reviving the evil conditions of sodom
[36:31] and gomorrah
[36:32] fulfilling jesus's prophecy
[36:36] the whirlwind of sexual abuse is howling
[36:38] in both hollywood
[36:39] and in the churches the metoo movement
[36:42] of 2018
[36:43] has exposed hollywood's wicked
[36:45] glorification of sexuality
[36:48] unveiling its rotten toxic filthy
[36:51] and god-hating scores of female
[36:54] celebrities have come forward to accuse
[36:57] and bring conviction upon rich and
[36:59] powerful
[37:00] sexual predators like harvey weinstein
[37:02] and bill cosby
[37:04] churches have experienced this violent
[37:06] wind as in august 2018
[37:08] pennsylvania grand jury report found
[37:11] that catholic priests
[37:12] had sexually abused over 1 000 victims
[37:15] in the past 70 years
[37:18] these allegations join a growing list of
[37:20] sex abuse cases
[37:22] spanning the globe from louisiana to
[37:24] ireland
[37:25] and from the netherlands to australia
[37:28] the cross-dressing and unisex fashions
[37:31] of the 1960s and 1970s
[37:33] were the seeds of confusion that led to
[37:36] the current rise
[37:37] and widespread adoption of homosexuality
[37:40] and
[37:40] transgenderism god is not the author of
[37:43] confusion
[37:44] if you plant or allow confusion or any
[37:47] seed of sin
[37:48] the harvest will be only death
[37:51] in the sight of god those who accept
[37:53] homosexuality
[37:54] and the transgender movement are insane
[37:57] paul said that homosexuals have received
[37:59] a reprobate mind
[38:00] and are without natural affection in the
[38:03] greek lexicon the reprobate mind is a
[38:05] worthless
[38:06] rejected castaway mindset that god gives
[38:10] to those who will not retain
[38:12] and accept the knowledge of god a person
[38:14] with a reprobate mind cannot be
[38:17] in his or her right mind making them
[38:19] insane in the sight of god
[38:21] furthermore the person is without the
[38:23] natural affection that god intended
[38:25] men and women to have the natural
[38:28] feelings of human beings
[38:29] to be attracted to the opposite sex have
[38:32] eroded
[38:33] the natural feeling to remain the gender
[38:35] of your birth has also been abandoned by
[38:37] millions
[38:38] in this backslidden country
[38:41] paul taught that a reprobate mind
[38:43] actually hates the word of god
[38:45] this god-hating condition is the result
[38:47] of people refusing to worship god
[38:50] and be thankful for his revealed truth
[38:52] the apostle
[38:53] also wrote that the wrath of god or
[38:56] whirlwind
[38:56] would come upon the entire world for
[38:58] this evil we know this judgment includes
[39:01] the united states
[39:02] because the majority of its citizens
[39:04] have chosen sin
[39:05] over righteousness and all nations have
[39:08] been deceived by the antichrist spirit
[39:11] retain the knowledge of god in your mind
[39:14] worship the creator
[39:15] and not the creation love the truth of
[39:18] god's word
[39:19] sow to the holy spirit and reap eternal
[39:22] life
[39:23] receive the truths god is currently
[39:25] restoring to his children
[39:29] conclusion the history of fashion in the
[39:32] united states reveals the immoral
[39:34] sinful downfall through a public
[39:36] undressing of its men and women
[39:38] lucifer like a serpent has slowly
[39:41] slithered
[39:42] through the decades destroying god's
[39:44] holiness standards
[39:45] and establishing his own cultural garden
[39:48] satan's eden
[39:49] america like israel was once a
[39:52] god-honoring nation
[39:53] but has transgressed the commands of the
[39:55] bible and will soon
[39:56] reap the full whirlwind of the judgments
[39:59] of god
[40:00] through my research i realize that most
[40:02] people do not have
[40:03] any idea about the standards of holiness
[40:06] that our nation
[40:07] used to keep the same thing happened to
[40:09] israel after joshua's generation passed
[40:12] away
[40:12] a generation rose up that did not know
[40:15] the lord
[40:16] and also all that generation were
[40:19] gathered unto their fathers
[40:21] and there arose another generation after
[40:23] them which knew not the lord
[40:25] nor yet the works which he had done for
[40:27] israel
[40:29] hardly anyone knows that most women
[40:30] never wore makeup or cut their hair
[40:33] until the 1920s because of their fear of
[40:35] almighty god
[40:37] few americans know that it was a public
[40:39] disgrace for most females to wear pants
[40:41] to school and work
[40:43] until the 1960s and 1970s
[40:46] because the masses heard preaching about
[40:49] deuteronomy 22 verse 5.
[40:52] recognize the purpose that god's spirit
[40:54] has been revealing these truths to you
[40:57] as first corinthians 2 verse 12 says
[41:00] now we have received not the spirit of
[41:02] the world
[41:03] but the spirit which is of god that we
[41:06] might know the things that are freely
[41:08] given to us
[41:08] of god before the wrath of god falls
[41:11] upon america
[41:13] it is your job and my job to spread the
[41:16] truth of god's word to everyone that
[41:18] will listen
[41:19] share truths about god's modest clothing
[41:21] with a lost
[41:22] and dying generation share god's truths
[41:25] with your words in conversation with
[41:28] your modest clothes
[41:29] with your social media account with your
[41:32] daily life
