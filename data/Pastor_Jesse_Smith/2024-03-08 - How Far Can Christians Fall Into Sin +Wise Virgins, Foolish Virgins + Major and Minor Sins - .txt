TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] is it possible for a holy ghost filled person to be influenced or do my minor things that he doesn't want to do oh yes yes sir yeah a holy ghost filled person you're right in the place then to be to be drove for these things greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question how far can Christians fall into sin this is an excellent question one I've had myself over the years one brother brandham dealt with also numerous people in our church have asked me about it as well so I thought I'd make a video on this so by the grace of God my short simple summary is that there's four classes of Believers as brother bandam taught us through the scripture and each class can commit a different degree of sin of course the High Calling of God is being a holy ghost filled Saint or the highest class of believer is a wise virgin according to Jesus's Parable Matthew 25 1-13 so the wise virgin will be able to overcome all major sins by the grace of God and that's a terminology brother random uses major sins and minor sins the next class is the foolish virgin they're saved and have some level of sanctification but their souls are not filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and each foolish virgin has a different level of sanctification and so they'll fall into worse sins than the wise Virgin by the grace of God and of course I'll show all this through the scriptures the Holy Bible the King James version the next class is the make believer group this is the Judas escar group recently I put out a video about the 13 metaphors the Bible gives for the Judas escar group so of course a genuinely saved Christian either wise virgin or foolish virgin will never fall away like the degree of sin that Judas a scarit committed he basically failed the grace of God the Bible says he transgressed and he forsook Jesus Christ he sold out Jesus Christ in other words he blasphemed the Holy Ghost and he lost his salvation a real Christian will never stoop to that level of sin they'll never fall into that level of sin then of course you have the unbeliever group like Pharaoh during the days of Moses and of course there are so many other Bible examples these people never believed to begin with they never were Justified to begin with their names were never on The Book of Life as brother R teaches in the church age book so I want to start with the viewer's question he wrote quote the thing is I have battled so many things in my life since then many victories but yet I made so many mistakes sometimes I question how can I have the spirit of God in Me and make so many mistakes can a Believer have God's spirit and still fall into sin surely this is not possible end quote so this is a wonderful honest sincere question I can certainly relate to this and I know any believer can I know brother brandom could because remember I shared this quote on my channel not long ago there's a quote where brother Ram says many times I don't even feel saved but yet by faith he was saved so brother Ram would get into the flesh as we all do and there would be times he said many times he didn't feel saved let's listen to that quote right God's word has made way you're not saved because you feel like you're saved I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved because a lot of times I don't feel that way but I'm saved because God gave the promise I met God's conditions enough own God's holy word I can defeat Satan seven days in a week and as many nights because it's God's word Now by God's grace We Believe brother brandham was a holy ghost filled Saint a wise virgin just like we believe St Paul and St Peter were filled with the Holy Ghost I'll be using these three men as my main examples for this video No Doubt brother Brandon was filled with the Holy Ghost but he said he made thousands of mistakes in a year but yet he always always confessed his sins brother Bram said he sinned every day he said Believers sin every day and so real Believers will confess their sins every day as Jesus gave us the model prayer The Lord's Prayer forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us so by God's grace let's get into these classes of Believers and of course we'll use the Bible to answer this question because the Bible is our absolute as brother brandom said the Bible was his absolute the tapes are not our absolute the tapes point us to the absolute the absolute is the Bible it's Jesus Christ it's the Holy Ghost and the Bible says prove all things and brother R repeated that prove all things test me by the word and every Bible Doctrine must run from Genesis to Revelation as brother R taught us and as St Paul told us in Galatians chapter 1 we can't add to the gospel nor take away we don't want to be cursed We Believe the full Bible Revelation by the grace of God so let's start with wise virgins These Are Holy Ghost filled Saints their souls are sealed with the Holy Ghost unto the day of redemption according to Ephesians 4:30 Ephesians 1:13 according to Matthew 11:29 Jesus said I came to give you rest to your souls so this proves the baptism of the Holy Ghost is in the soul of the believer of course we can feel the Holy Ghost on our body and in our minds but the New Testament is all about the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul the soul is the nature of the person the deepest most innermost part of their being and that's what Jesus came to do he came to give us the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul the rest in the soul the Jews already had the rest on the Sabbath and Jesus said I come to give you rest to your souls so I'm going to take my Bible here and begin with 1 Corinthians 6 and then go to Galatians 5 I want to show the difference between major sins and minor sins actually I'll just start here in Galatians 5 since my Bible's already open to it so Paul describes the works of the Flesh in Galatians 5 19 through 26 he said they are adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulation wrath Strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness reings and such like of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in time past they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God so here's a list of major sins people that commit these sins cannot inherit the kingdom of God unless they repent and of course the kingdom of God is mysterious as the Bible calls it it's the mystery which was hid from ages but now revealed unto you Christ in you the hope of glory according to Colossians 1 27-29 and then Jesus also says the kingdom of God is within you in Luke 17 so that's a great mystery and that's what we understand here in Paul's writings they will not inherit the kingdom of God these people will not receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost because of the works of the flesh so I believe these are the major sins that Holy Ghost filled people will not commit now of course Holy Ghost filled Saints will will battle minor forms of these for example tempted by sexual thoughts immoral thoughts tempted to have anger and hatred toward people tempted to commit sedition or Strife against another brother but in each time the Holy Ghost will deliver the individual as brother brandom said he said if I went overseas and I made a mistake with a woman he said I know my wife would forgive me he said but of course my comforter would keep me from doing that so the Holy Ghost keeps us from doing these major sins let's listen to that quote but looking at my wife sitting here if I would go out here today and throw my arms around some other woman and and make love to her and I'd uh know then after I did that that I was wrong so wrong of course my comforter would keep me from doing that see see but I mean if I if I did that and I it happened that I did it or anything similar to it and then back in Galatians 5:22 we see the fruit of the spirit here's what the Holy Ghost filled Christian manifests love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance and then notice they crucify the flesh with the affections and lusts because they walk in the spirit according to Galatians 5 23-26 and then if you turn to 1 Corinthians 6 we see a similar list from St Paul in chapter 6: 9-1 no not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God and of course this kingdom of God means the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus said the kingdom of God is within you be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor feminite nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God so here's a list of major sins that Holy Ghost filled Saints will not commit because they already have the kingdom of God in their souls I love verse 11 though this shows that Holy Ghost filled Saints used to commit these but they don't because now they're born again and such were some of you but you are washed but you're Sanctified so see there's the first two steps of Grace justification and sanctification and that's what cleans out your life from these major sins you're Justified and then you get Sanctified but you are washed you are Sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of God so I believe those two portions of scriptures show the major sins Holy Ghost filled Saints will not commit and Friends remember brother Ram talks about terminology of major sins versus minor sins among Christians he talks about this in 1961 they asked him can a holy ghost pH person be influenced to do minor things and of course he says yes and he makes the point where Holy Ghost filed Christians will not commit major sins let's listen to the quote is it possible for a holy ghost filled person to be driven by the driven by the to do minor things influenced or do my minor things that he doesn't want to do oh yes yes sir yeah a holy ghost filled person you're ring a place then to be to be drove by these things you just put yourself up a Target when you're down there serving the devil he just lets you slash around any you want to but you want take a stand for Christ you've got on the other side then he trains every gun right around on you every Temptation everything that can be thrown to you then you got it but what have you got greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world see now you wasn't in no battle here you just slopping along see but now you you cleaned up you've dressed up You' shaved you combed your hair you put on a uniform you got a gun in your hand let's go see you're in battle not to show off but to fight fight sure when The Temptations rise with the spirit The Shield of Faith Buck it off and move on see that's right or put on the whole armor of God why you put on Armor if you're not going to fight all soldiers are dressed to fight not to show off walk and say I'm so and so now I'm a Christian you see who I am I belong to so and so Hallelujah I got the Holy Ghost the other night sure nothing bothers me anymore uhuh brother I believe you better go back and try again see well I'm telling you when as soon as you say you got the Holy Ghost Satan's got every gun right on you shooting then you got the whole armor on then take the shield of Faith the sword of the spirit of the word and take the Buckle along the Sha yourself with the gospel and take the old a middle piece the breastplate and pull up the Cinch on it and tighten yourself up a little bit and get ready boy cuz it's a coming don't you worry yes sir you're going to have plenty of trouble but remember greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world now I want to continue looking at the wise virgin and I just have numerous thoughts in here and I'll try to share them from the scripture let's begin with Romans 7 Paul says he could do things that he hated and yet we know he was a holy ghost filled Saint we know the book of Acts that he got the Holy Ghost shortly after he was baptized in water now Paul doesn't give us the specifics of what sins he committed but he did say that he did things he hated but then I love he makes the differentiation he said it's not I that sin it's not my soul that sins because his soul had the Holy Ghost the soul was filled with the Holy Ghost he said it's the sin that dwelleth within me but the sin was still committed inside of his body so he had to confess his sins now there's numerous quotes from Brother brandom on the subject of complexes but that's what I believe will be the main sin the main minor sin that a holy ghost filled believer commits will be sins of complexes or mental mind battles that they have a difficulty overcoming that's found in 2 Corinthians 10: 4 and 5 the Bible says for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds so that stronghold means a castle brother Ram talked about how we would build complexes in our minds another words we give the enemy a place in our minds as Ephesians 4 says the Bible says neither give place place to the devil but of course in our minds sometimes we give heed to evil thoughts and if we don't confess it right away and overcome it and pray about it it becomes a complex so we have this mental state where the enem is battling us in our minds and every time a certain subject comes up we have a negative response to it we feel bad about it or maybe we have hurt feelings towards someone but Paul says the word of God is mighty to pull down these strongholds to help us overcome our complexes by the grace of God now we see some of these complexes battling believer in the New Testament like Paul saying I did things that I hated in Romans 7 another great example is in the book of Acts where Paul and Barnabas had a dispute between them about Mark and so they separated ways of course later Mark turned out to be a good helper and Paul accepted Mark's help later on in life but at that moment there in the book of Acts there was such a dispute between Paul and Barnabas that they couldn't Minister together they separated ways so we see Holy Ghost filled people can have disputes and it will cause them to separate yet they're still born again one of the best examples is in Galatians 21-14 Paul came and told Peter he was to be blamed to his face there in galatia and the Bible said it was fear that Peter allowed to cause him and Barnabas to separate themselves from the Gentiles so here we see the sin of Pride the sin of fear coming on Peter and barnabus where they wouldn't even associate with Gentiles so here we see an example for us in the modern day of segregation racial segregation and this fear caused the Holy Ghost filled Saints to separate themselves from other Saints and they actually influenced others the Bible said the Bible said in so much that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation so Peter's sin caused Barnabas to sin and others all because of the fear of the Jews so this proves Holy Ghost filled Saints can get a complex of fear and they will be blamed for the effects or influence of their sin but thank God God is rich in Mercy thank God 1 John 1 says if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to cleanse us from all unrighteousness now in that same chapter Galatians Chapter 2 Paul says if I build again the things which I destroyed I make myself a transgressor that was in Galatians 21:18 so Paul again separates the wise virgin from the foolish virgin wise virgins will not build again what they've already destroyed the sins they've already overcome they will not go back into them to the same degree CU Paul said if you did that in verse 21 Galatians 2:21 you'd frustrate the grace of God and wise virgins will not frustrate the grace of God they will not fail the grace of God they will not do despite unto the spirit of God now I want to look at some examples from Brother brandom's life we know he was born again of the Holy Ghost in the soul in the days of brother brandham no one lived closer to God than brother brandham not Billy Graham not or Roberts he was the wise virgin for his day no one labored for Christ like brother brandom labored but he still battled the sin nature inside of him you'll know also you remember if you've listen to brother brandham he lied to the IRS so we see a holy ghost filled Christian out of busyness or being exhausted or worn out he said he was so busy he felt like his head was spinning he lied to his wife to lie to the IRS but then he quickly repented by the grace of God so we see how the Lord is faithful and bringing his children to repentance for their sins there's a quote from 1947 brother random said he walked in balam's shoes because at the beginning of his ministry his National Ministry of healing and discernment he challenged people to bring the hardest cases the miracle cases first in the prayer line and he said he did that for a number of months until the angel Lord corrected him so this proves a holy ghost filled Saint can be out of the will of God for a few months at least by God's grace until the Lord brings correction and then another simple example is again seeing brother Brandon battled the critical spirit so I I believe this is the pride of life he battled it all throughout his ministry recently I put out the video about brother Ram said he was haunted by the critical spirit so I'll leave a link to that video in the description and then we see it it resurfaced later in standing in the Gap 1963 brother Rand said he lost the feeling for the people and he had these plans he was going to move up into the Colorado mountains with his wife and just live up there and not be amongst the churches anymore because they wouldn't hear his message every time he went and preached to the women there was more women that cut the their hair more women that wore makeup and he was getting discouraged he said I'll just move up there but the angel of the Lord corrected brother brandom he said if you do that your wife will leave you and brother Ram said well I thought I was a prophet and Prophets live out by themselves and only stomp down with thus sayi the Lord then go back out into isolation and the angel Lord corrected him and said you're an Apostolic Prophet with many gifts and of course if you look in the Bible St Paul never isolated himself away from anyone other than his one trip to the desert to get the Revelation but after that he was was constantly amongst the churches three major missionary Journeys and then he would visit the churches that they started and confirm them and make sure they were established in the faith just like brother brandham did Brother Bram never isolated himself away from the True Churches or the fivefold ministry he supported the five-fold ministry brother brandom always went to church brother brandom always dealt honestly and sincerely and humbly with the pastors if you've listened to brother brandom even when he would have special meetings he would schedule them on Sunday between the morning and evening service so he wouldn't take away people from their post of Duty or their home church that's how much brother brandham respected the five full ministry Now by God's grace let's get into the foolish virgin examples here now in Galatians 3:1 Paul plainly tells the Galatians they're foolish because they've allowed legalism back in to the faith so anytime Christians bring legalism in it proves they're not born again and then he said in Galatians 4:19 he said my Little Children of whom I travail and birth again until Christ be formed in you so he's saying that he believes they're probably not born again he says I have to travail in birth again I've got to labor with you I've got to preach with you I've got to pray you through again to make sure you're born again and that proves a born again Christian will not bring in heresies or seditions or Strife as we already read in Galatians 5 and 1 Corinthians 6 another example is the Corinthian Church in 1 Corinthians 5 there's a man sleeping with his stepmother and Paul said the church wasn't even mourning so this proves a lot of the people in the church were probably not born again and in 1 Corinthians 5:11 Paul called this man a brother but Paul told them deliver him to Satan that his soul might be saved now we never see any Holy Ghost filled Saint being delivered to Satan that his soul might be saved it's only These Foolish virgins who are committing these major sins like in this case fornication and this also brings a thought about how much sexual sin can a Christian commit so a holy ghost filled Christian will not commit any sexual sin he or she might have mind battles like brother Ram said he had to put up a cross in his car he said I've had the Holy Ghost for years but he said when a holy ghost filled man any healthy man sees an immorally dressed woman something passes over him so he had to put a cross in his car to keep his eyes focused on the word of God but some people try to say because David committed adultery Christians can commit adultery and still have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul but they failed to recognize that was under the old Covenant where they didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul that's according to John 737 through 39 the Holy Ghost could not be given until Jesus was glorified so in the Old Testament David couldn't have the power of the Holy Ghost in his soul he only had it in his mind so this brother who's committing fornication in 1 Corinthians 5 he was called a brother so that means he was probably baptized and he was probably just Justified and he hadn't gone through the sanctification stage yet so he's definitely a still a foolish virgin now one thing about the Corinthian Church if you read the book of second Corinthians they help this brother repent and Paul said he was glad they repented and then he says they were Chase virgins to Christ and that's in 2 Corinthians 11:2 for I've espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ so when someone gets saved they're clean they're forgiven they're a Chase virgin to Christ when they get saved they're a foolish virgin right they're virgin to the word of God but they've got to go on and get Sanctified and then filled with the Holy Ghost when they're filled with the Holy Ghost they won't commit these sins like this brother did committing fornication with his stepmother now I want to make a few important points here before I finish the video by the grace of God the first point is that sometimes we can't know whether a person is born again or not so we can't know sometimes if they're wise virgin or foolish virgin there's one quote where brother ramam says I can know within a few minutes when talking to a man if he's born born again or not but then there's another quote that says you'll never be able to know so I couldn't find the quote where he said I can know just in a few minutes but I did find the quote where he says you can't know and that that's a 1954 questions and answers part one brother Bram said there's not a way in the world for you to know it there's not a way in the world for you to know it God is the judge we are not to judge let's listen to the quote brother gr I want to know the place where I can tie down and say this man has the Holy Ghost because did this or this woman has the Holy Ghost because she did that there's not a way in the world for you to know it right there's not a way in the world you know God is the judge we are not the judge let's preach the gospel so because of that a second point is you and I must make our calling and election sure Peter said make your calling and election sure and think about that Peter the man who had denied Christ the man who had told Jesus he didn't have to go to the cross the man who had allowed fear to cause him to segregate himself away from the Gentiles that man said make your calling election sure in other words confess all your mistakes and keep pressing toward the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus Paul also said in 1 Corinthians 9 that he had to beat his body and bring it under subjection so he himself would not be a Castaway he would not be a Judas and so we get that understanding that as Believers we need to make our calling and election sure we need to bring our bodies into subjection we must not continue in sin that Grace would abound as Paul said we've got to take up our cross daily and follow Jesus Christ so we don't fall into sin and brother Bram supports this as well brother Bram said there's no way for us to prove our names are on the Lamb's Book of Life he said God could use us as a tool for anything he said but by faith we believe that let's listen to the quote now we don't know you say brother random can you prove that you're there no sir I cannot prove it God could use me for a tool of something else he use you the same way but I believe and by faith I am saved not by knowledge I'm saved by faith that's way you're saved that's way we're all saved another point is I want to share just a story one of the Believers told me and this believer is from another church that they had a holy ghost filled Saint a Man Who Loved God for his entire life but then at the end of his life he had Alzheimer's or something disease where he lost his memory and he was in a nursing home and he started cussing and swearing and the brother asked me what I thought and I said well I don't know I just know that if his Spirit was breaking up or if he lost his mind then of course he wouldn't be able to control his mind anymore he was losing his mind so I believed God would not hold that person accountable for that if they had a disease like Alzheimer's and they lost their mind the Bible said a man who can't control his mind is like a a city Without Walls and of course in this in this case the disease has caused the man to not be able to control his mind so I believe that person could have been filled with the Holy Ghost no doubt in their soul but then this disease caused them to lose their mind lose control of their mind now that's just my thought I'm open to correction on that by God's grace I've never seen that myself but I was just told about that particular story so I thought I'd share that next I believe within the three areas of sin pride of life lust of the eyes and lust of the flesh Believers can have a battle in one of those areas and the battle will be harder than the other areas so what I mean by that as brother Bram said some men and women can be high passion so they'll battle sexual Temptations more than others and then some people will battle the pride of life more than others I've seen that there's a certain group of message preachers that call themselves the greatest of all time sometimes they say there's no great ones among us then they'll go back to saying today's young people are the greatest young people ever or I'm among some of the greatest most powerful men on the the entire face of the Earth and so they go back and forth from being humble and then being prideful this shows just as brother brandom battled the critical spirit that's the pride of life some of these preachers also battle the pride of life exalting themselves as the greatest of all time one thing to notti as well Jesus's own disciples argued who was the greatest of all time but that was before they were born again that was before Acts 2 and the day of Pentecost that's why I say some of these preachers if they're calling themselves the greatest of all time perhaps they're not born again only time will tell by God's grace a tree is known by its fruit another point I want to make is that brother brandom again said the Holy Ghost would keep him from sexual sin actually committing the literal Act of sexual sin I referenced the quote earlier where brother brandom said my comforter would keep me from cheating on my wife if that would ever happen and thank God of course it never happened to brother brandom but I want to make this point again because one time I was in a ministers meeting with some ministers and a man who was not a minister confessed that he had committed adultery and I told him I said brother I don't think you're born again because of this quote from Brother brandham my comforter would keep me from that there were some other ministers there and they said well I think you can be born again just got to confess your sins now we just agreed to disagree in the meeting it was very kind meeting but then years later this man fell away from the message he doesn't even go to church anymore his wife cuts her hair wears pants yoga pants I'm told I've never seen it makeup all these things that his children have grown up and they don't serve God the girls cut their hair wear makeup and so forth so I believe time has proved that by God's grace I was right on that topic just like brother Brandon was trying to say if I have the Holy Ghost it will keep me from committing literal acts of sexual sin that's what the comforter is there for the comforter is there for power Jesus said you'll have power to be a witness when the Holy Ghost comes upon you and the last point I want to make is sometimes there are some uncertain situations things we don't quite know about for example in the book of Acts they had to pray and anoint deacons because there was a problem amongst the people they were neglecting the widows and so here we see the sin of neglect this would probably be the pride of life I would imagine because food was not being given to a certain group of people based upon their nationality so the question is can Holy Ghost filled Saints neglect others I don't know were they born again those that were neglecting I don't know Acts chapter 2 said the souls were added to the kingdom of God so we don't know if that means just Justified or some were filled with the Holy Ghost we don't know for sure but we know Acts 2:4 says they were filled with the Holy Ghost so the 120 were filled with the Holy Ghost but we don't know about the 3,000 and the last thing I'll say is something that helped some brothers recently when I preached down in Junction City brother brandom said no matter where you are with God you got to put a stake down when God does something in your life or you have a great testimony or God gives you some type of victory in your life you got to put a stake down because Satan will try to come to that point of your life and say that never happened or you're not what you claim to be you're not a holy ghost filled Saint you're not saved so you got to be able to put a stake down down and say no I know God did something there I know God led me to repentance I know God gave me power there I know God gave me the Holy Ghost there so you got to have experiences in your life where you know God did something God changed you you had a book of act experience you had your own day of Pentecost Holy Ghost experience you've got to put a stake down and stand upon the promise of God at some point friends we can't live in guilt we can't live in defeat we have to remember if we confess our sins we are instantly forgiven it's tossed in the sea of God's forgetfulness we have to confess our sins move on get our first love back our first Zeal back to serve the Lord Jesus Christ we must do the first works as Jesus said in Revelation chap 2 and I love what brother random said I'm not where I want to be I'm not what I ought to be but thank God I'm not what I used to be we see what God has done in our lives we thank God for the progress or the land we've possessed in our spiritual Promised Land but we must possess more by the grace of God brother brandom said I'll keep this what I have now until something greater comes and that's great advice for all of us thank God for what Christ has done in my life to this point and I'm going to keep this until greater things come by the grace of God in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing by the grace of God of course much more could be said maybe I'll do a part two on this depending on the comments and the questions and the feedback I'm always open to correction by the grace of God but friends let's daily confess our sins let's press on toward the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let's cast down all strongholds all complexes let's live clean before the Lord Jesus Christ empowered by the Holy Spirit to crucify the lust and the affections thereof and let's remember greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
