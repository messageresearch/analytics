[0:04] On February [music] 18th, 1961,
[0:07] God's prophet, Brother William Marin
[0:09] Brham, [music] preached a sermon called
[0:11] Balman Gilead in Long Beach, California,
[0:15] as the [music] 13th out of 14 sermons
[0:18] preached in a two-week campaign.
[0:21] For further context on this [music]
[0:22] sermon, 7 days before this, on February
[0:25] 11th, 1961,
[0:27] Danny Henry gave his notable tongues
[0:30] [music] prophecy about brother Brandham
[0:33] and how he had chosen the narrow path
[0:35] and it was a glorious decision in the
[0:38] sight of the Lord Jesus. [music]
[0:40] And it would bring to pass the
[0:41] tremendous victory in the love divine.
[0:45] Two [music] months prior to this,
[0:46] Brother Brham had preached the
[0:47] revelation of the seven church ages in
[0:50] Jeffersonville, Indiana. And the pillar
[0:52] of fire [music] was visibly seen at the
[0:55] end of the series on the church ages on
[0:58] January 8th, [music] 1961.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; Now look this way, y'all. Now that's
[1:03] just like it is when it comes on glory
[1:04] here. See,
[1:06] it's a light where you're you're moving
[1:08] here. You see now look, it's just it's
[1:10] just a reflection. Just a reflection.
[1:13] That is See, it's not the light. Here's
[1:14] the light hanging right here. See, I
[1:16] hear this woman. I just happened to
[1:18] catch it and I thought it was over
[1:19] somebody
[1:30] now. You're seeing one. I'm seeing two.
[1:33] One of them is the natural, the other is
[1:35] the supernatural. There's a man sitting
[1:37] on the outside here of this line looking
[1:40] over towards that light struck him. He's
[1:42] from Seymour, Indiana. and he's got had
[1:45] a stroke. If you'll believe, sir, God
[1:47] will heal you of that stroke. Amen.
[1:51] Believe now. You believe with all your
[1:53] heart.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; At the conclusion then of the balm and
[1:58] Gilead sermon in Long Beach, Brother
[2:01] Brandham called the preachers up to the
[2:03] front of the [music] church to form a
[2:04] double line, as he called it, which was
[2:06] what we would call a prayer tunnel
[2:08] today. when those [music] desiring
[2:11] prayer walk through a prayer line with
[2:12] preachers on both sides of them so the
[2:15] preachers [music] can lay hands on them
[2:16] as they walk through the prayer line.
[2:19] Brother Random said he [music] called
[2:20] the pastors up, evangelists,
[2:22] missionaries because he didn't want the
[2:24] people's faith to be only in his
[2:27] ministry. He wanted their [music] faith
[2:29] to be in the ministries of their local
[2:31] pastors, evangelists, and missionaries.
[2:33] [music]
[2:34] &gt;&gt; I want to show you something. Pastors,
[2:37] evangelists, missionaries. How many of
[2:39] you all are believers?
[2:43] &gt;&gt; See, now I'm going to ask as many as you
[2:45] all the chance to come right down here
[2:47] with me. See, I I not let the evangelist
[2:51] have everything to do. The people, I
[2:54] don't want you to have your faith built
[2:55] into an evangelist. I want you to have
[2:57] your faith built in your own pastor.
[2:59] He's the man who's going to lead you
[3:01] from here out. See, and these men, come
[3:03] down, some of you brethren, come down
[3:05] here. Let's form a double life.
[3:08] Yeah. A double line.
[3:10] These men are men of God that believe.
[3:12] I'm going to stand right in the middle
[3:14] of them and we're going to pray. How
[3:16] many out there's going to be praying for
[3:17] him, too? Out there.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon then asked the people if
[3:21] they were proud of their pastors. And
[3:23] the congregation [music] said, "Praise
[3:25] the Lord."
[3:26] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm going to tell you? It
[3:29] makes me proud in my heart and grateful
[3:32] to find servants of God that'll stand
[3:35] before the people and say, "I'm a
[3:37] witness of this gospel, too."
[3:39] &gt;&gt; Aren't you proud of your pastors? Say,
[3:42] "Praise the Lord if you're proud of
[3:43] these pastors." We're proud of our
[3:46] brother. Amen. We're proud of them.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham even said the
[3:51] pastors [music]
[3:51] had just as much of the anointing to lay
[3:54] hands on the sick as he did. They are
[3:57] your pastors. A pastor means a shepherd.
[4:01] These each of these men has just as much
[4:03] of anointing to lay hands on the sick as
[4:06] I do.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Notice Brother Bram never exalted
[4:09] himself above the local pastors,
[4:11] evangelists, teachers, apostles, or
[4:13] missionaries. Brother Bram never told
[4:16] them to sit down and let Brother Bram do
[4:18] all the praying. He never said they
[4:20] should sit down and let Brother Ram do
[4:22] all the [music] preaching. Brother M
[4:24] never said when I leave just press play
[4:26] and obey. So we [music] see the true
[4:28] godly Christian character of brother
[4:30] Brham. The fruits of his life and
[4:32] ministry are the genuine [music] fruits
[4:34] of the Holy Ghost which is unlike the
[4:37] current leadership and Bible denying
[4:40] character we see at [music] the Brandom
[4:41] Tabernacle. But we continue to pray that
[4:44] their awful, sad, deceived spiritual
[4:48] [music] state will be cast down and they
[4:50] could have a genuine Holy Ghost [music]
[4:53] revival of repentance coming back to the
[4:56] word of God, which includes [music]
[4:58] living preachers standing behind the
[5:00] pulpits preaching the living word of
[5:02] God. Next, Brother [music] Random made
[5:04] such a shocking statement to me that I
[5:07] had to stop the tape and go back and
[5:09] listen to it to make sure I heard it
[5:10] correctly. Brother Brandham said those
[5:13] Long Beach pastors had a higher office
[5:16] [music] than Brother Brandham.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not a preacher. They're a
[5:21] preacher. They've got a higher office
[5:23] than I have. They've got a higher office
[5:27] than I have.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; After hearing that, I thought, what
[5:29] would the current Brandom Tabernacle
[5:31] think if they heard those words from
[5:33] their prophet?
[5:35] This video's thumbnail is my guess as to
[5:37] what a tape [music] worshiping
[5:38] congregation might look like as they
[5:40] listen to that tape. And brother
[5:42] Brandham saying, "The Long Beach pastors
[5:44] had a higher office [music] than Brother
[5:46] Brandham, the man that they erroneously
[5:49] exalt to infallibility." And this
[5:51] [music] thumbnail is my imagination as
[5:54] to the surprise that would probably be
[5:56] on their faces if they were actually
[5:58] listening with honest hearts. I wondered
[6:00] if Brandham Tabernacle would ever
[6:02] [music] play this tape at their
[6:03] regularly scheduled one time a week
[6:05] worldwide tape playing [music] routine,
[6:08] which is far less than the three sermons
[6:11] Brandham Tabernacle held weekly while
[6:13] brother was alive. So notice current
[6:16] Brandham Tabernacle people are only
[6:17] listening to one sermon each week rather
[6:20] than the three live preaching sermons
[6:23] that brother Brandham ordained while he
[6:25] was alive. [music] So Brennham
[6:26] Tabernacle currently has changed from
[6:29] the the live preaching [music] schedule
[6:31] that their prophet ordained while he was
[6:34] alive on this earth. And I wondered if
[6:37] Brandham Tabernacle believed every word
[6:39] on tape was thus [music] say the Lord as
[6:41] they erroneously claim. Then what is the
[6:44] order of the offices now that they've
[6:46] heard brother Brandham's order [music]
[6:47] of the offices? Brandom Tabernacles blog
[6:50] post twice says brother Brandham is the
[6:53] greatest prophet of all time. So, if
[6:55] that is true, which I disagree with
[6:57] because I believe [music] Jesus Christ
[6:59] is the greatest prophet of all time,
[7:01] where does that place these Long Beach,
[7:03] California pastors, evangelists, and
[7:05] teachers, and missionaries [music] in
[7:07] the order of highest offices?
[7:10] In the September 13th, 2023 Brandham
[7:13] Tabernacle blog [music] post, they said,
[7:15] "Brother Random was called to a much
[7:17] higher office than all of them,"
[7:19] referring to Abraham, Moses, Elijah, and
[7:22] Elisha. [music]
[7:23] So according to this quote from brother
[7:24] Brandham in Balgilead, these Long Beach
[7:27] pastors, [music] teachers, evangelists,
[7:29] and missionaries must have been some
[7:30] very special pastors if their office was
[7:33] higher than brother Brandham [music] who
[7:35] is Brandham Tabernacle's goat. And these
[7:38] Long Beach pastors [music] would
[7:39] therefore have a higher office than
[7:41] Abraham, Moses, Elijah, and Elisha.
[7:45] Before giving my thoughts on this
[7:46] question, [music] let's finish listening
[7:48] to the rest of this quote and hear
[7:50] brother Random explain why he felt these
[7:52] Long Beach pastors, [music] evangelists,
[7:53] and missionaries had a higher office
[7:55] than he did.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not a preacher. They're
[7:59] preachers. They've got a higher office
[8:02] than I have. Mine's a prophetic office,
[8:06] and it's a prophet sign. Now, they're
[8:08] not they wasn't built for that. They
[8:10] wasn't ordained for that. But what does
[8:13] the Bible say? God has set in the church
[8:16] apostles. That's missionaries, [music]
[8:19] prophets, pastors, teachers,
[8:22] evangelists. Is that right?
[8:24] &gt;&gt; The gifts ordained of God and anointed.
[8:28] Now, I have no education. That's the
[8:30] reason I say I'm not a preacher. These
[8:32] men could take this word and they
[8:34] wouldn't have to use one of these gifts.
[8:36] They could just lay that word out there
[8:37] so they taste such a he couldn't get out
[8:40] of it. See? But I can't do that. That's
[8:43] not my calling. They are called for that
[8:46] now. But they're they're a man of God.
[8:48] Every man that's called of God is
[8:51] commissioned to lay hands on the sick
[8:53] and they shall recover. How many believe
[8:55] that?
[8:56] &gt;&gt; Then how you going to fail from getting
[8:58] well passed into a ark like this?
[9:02] &gt;&gt; So brother Random [music] says these
[9:03] Long Beach pastors had a higher office
[9:06] because their pastoral gifts were
[9:08] different [music] than Brother Random's
[9:10] prophetic gift. Brother Random said
[9:12] their pastoral gifts could tie Satan in
[9:15] such a knot that he couldn't get out
[9:16] [music] of it. And brother Random said,
[9:18] quote, "But I can't do that. That's not
[9:20] my calling." End quote.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; These men could take this word and they
[9:24] wouldn't have to use one of these gifts.
[9:26] They could just lay that word out there
[9:28] so that Satan is such a he couldn't get
[9:30] out of it. See, I can't do that. That's
[9:33] not my calling. They are called for
[9:35] that.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[9:36] &gt;&gt; So, brother Ram said, "These pastors
[9:38] could do something brother Brandham
[9:39] could not do because of the gift [music]
[9:41] of God in their life." So, what is the
[9:43] truth on this quote? Is this quote
[9:46] biblical from God's prophet brother
[9:47] Brandham? I believe it is when you
[9:49] consider the highest [music] offices in
[9:51] at least three different contexts. These
[9:54] three contexts are first the local
[9:56] church, [music]
[9:57] second the five-fold ministry, and third
[10:00] who the word [music] of God is revealed
[10:02] to. Let's first begin with the local
[10:04] church. In 1957, brother Brandham said
[10:08] he believed [music] the supreme
[10:09] authority of the local assembly is the
[10:11] local elder. [music] He said, "Show me
[10:14] by the Bible what's greater in the Bible
[10:15] than a local elder to a local church."
[10:18] And he went [music] on to say, "But the
[10:20] full and complete authority of the
[10:21] church is the pastor. Read that in the
[10:23] Bible. [music] See if that's not Bible
[10:25] order." That's exactly right. There's no
[10:27] one above the elder. I have nothing to
[10:28] do with what Brother Neville does here.
[10:31] That's up [music] to you and brother
[10:32] Neville. End quote. But I believe in the
[10:36] supreme authority of the local assembly.
[10:41] Show me with the Bible what's greater in
[10:43] the Bible than a local elder to a local
[10:46] church. [music]
[10:47] That's right.
[10:48] Yes. The sovereignty of the local
[10:51] church, each church in itself,
[10:54] but the full and complete authority of
[10:58] the church is the [music] pastor.
[11:00] Read that in the Bible. See if that's
[11:02] not Bible order. That's exactly right.
[11:04] There's no one above the elder. I have
[11:06] nothing to do with what brother Neville
[11:08] does here. That's up to you and brother
[11:10] Neville. If brother Neville wanted to
[11:11] preach Jehovah Witness doctrine, that's
[11:13] up to him and you. See, if he wanted to
[11:16] preach anything he [clears throat]
[11:18] wanted to, that's between you and him.
[11:21] That's all. If the congregation votes
[11:22] for him in there to preach that, that's
[11:24] all right. That's up to him. The only
[11:26] thing that I do just is owning the
[11:28] property. And if something another comes
[11:30] by that it's a like moving the pastor
[11:32] and they want to take a vote on that,
[11:33] you couldn't ask the deacon to do that.
[11:35] You'd come ask me. I'd come down and
[11:37] say, "If you want to move the pastor,
[11:38] tell me why. Has he done anything?"
[11:40] &gt;&gt; So now it's easy to understand why
[11:42] Brother Ran would say these Long Beach
[11:44] pastors, evangelists, and missionaries
[11:46] [music] had a higher office than him. He
[11:47] was referring to the local assembly. In
[11:50] the local assembly, no one has more
[11:52] authority [music] than the pastor. The
[11:54] second context is the five-fold
[11:56] ministry. Ephesians 4:11 [music] gives
[11:58] us the order of offices and it places
[12:02] the apostle first, prophet second,
[12:04] evangelist third, [music] pastors
[12:06] fourth, and teachers fifth. Of course,
[12:09] brother Brandham agreed with this Bible
[12:10] revelation. In remembering [music] the
[12:12] Lord 1962, brother Brandham said Judas
[12:15] sold his Lord after he had the
[12:17] opportunity to [music] even to be a
[12:20] disciple to be an apostle, the highest
[12:22] calling in the Bible, higher than a
[12:24] prophet.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; [music]
[12:25] &gt;&gt; He isn't fit for heaven. WHY? HE SOLD
[12:29] HIS LORD AFTER HE HAD the opportunity to
[12:33] even to be a a disciple
[12:38] TO BE AN APOSTLE. THE HIGHEST CALLING in
[12:40] the Bible.
[12:43] Higher than a prophet. To be an apostle.
[12:46] The highest calling in the Bible. Higher
[12:49] than a prophet.
[12:51] So in the first two contexts we have two
[12:54] different offices that are higher than
[12:56] one another. [music] In the local church
[12:58] the pastor is higher than the prophet
[12:59] and the apostle as [music] far as
[13:01] authority over the local assembly. But
[13:03] in the five-fold ministry the apostle is
[13:05] above the prophet evangelist pastor and
[13:08] teacher. The third context [music] is to
[13:11] whom the word of the lord is revealed
[13:13] to. And the bible tells us the word of
[13:14] the lord came [music] to the prophet. So
[13:17] the third context is revelation. the
[13:20] office of receiving revelation. [music]
[13:23] Brother Ram told us in the anointed ones
[13:24] of the end time that there is no more
[13:27] higher order to [music] reveal the word
[13:29] than prophets. But the only way the
[13:31] prophet can be vindicated is by the
[13:33] word.
[13:34] &gt;&gt; No more. There's no more higher
[13:37] order to reveal the word than prophets.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; But the ONLY WAY THE PROPHET CAN BE A
[13:43] VINDICATED IS BY THE WORD. AMEN.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; SO THE highest office for revelation of
[13:48] the word of God [music] is the prophet.
[13:50] After that, it's my guess that it would
[13:52] be the five-fold ministry. [music] And
[13:54] then after that, it would likely be all
[13:56] the rest of the believers. This is based
[13:58] on a quote brother Random said [music]
[13:59] in the fifth seal. He said, "We don't
[14:01] want to never think that because some
[14:03] little wash woman [music] or or little
[14:05] plow boy out there couldn't get a
[14:06] revelation from God because you see it's
[14:08] God, he actually reveals himself in
[14:10] simplicity." Now, we don't want to never
[14:13] think it because some little wash woman
[14:16] or or a little plow boy out there
[14:18] couldn't get a re revelation from God
[14:21] because you see it God uh he uh actually
[14:28] reveals himself in simplicity. That's we
[14:33] had that Sunday to start this off on how
[14:35] he reveals himself in his simplicity.
[14:39] uh that's what makes him great.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; So based upon these [music] quotes from
[14:44] God's prophet brother Brandham and the
[14:46] Bible scriptures, we learned brother
[14:48] Brandham was showing the [music] supreme
[14:49] authority of the local church giving
[14:51] double honor to the pastors who labored
[14:53] in the word and doctrine according to
[14:55] St. Paul. As true Holy Ghostfilled
[14:57] message [music] believers, we do not add
[14:59] to the Bible nor take away one word from
[15:01] the holy scripture. We don't say press
[15:04] play and obey. We don't say [music] tape
[15:06] boys are the true five-fold ministry. We
[15:09] don't say the tapes are the token. We
[15:11] don't say preachers [music] should sit
[15:12] down and just press play because that's
[15:14] not in the Bible. We rejoice [music] in
[15:17] this quote from 1961 Bal and Gilead
[15:19] because it shows brother Ram's respect
[15:21] for [music] the five-fold ministry that
[15:23] St. Paul ordained in Ephesians chapter 4
[15:26] by the leadership of the Lord Jesus
[15:28] [music] Christ who inspired Paul to
[15:30] write these truths. We strive, as
[15:32] brother Random did, to stay with every
[15:34] single word of the Holy Bible because we
[15:37] want to be blessed and not cursed. As
[15:39] Paul said in Galatians chapter 1, we
[15:42] hang our souls on any phrase of the
[15:44] Bible because we are fundamental
[15:45] believers in the Bible. Just like the
[15:47] [music] seventh church age messenger,
[15:49] William Miriam Brandom. And I believe
[15:52] that Paul said, "If an angel from heaven
[15:55] would come and teach any other thing
[15:57] than what you had already been taught in
[15:59] this scripture, let him be unto you a
[16:01] curse." Galatians 1:8. So I am a
[16:05] fundamental believer in the Bible.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; What the Bible says, I believe it. And I
[16:11] believe it's the truth and ready to hang
[16:13] my soul on any phase of the Bible or any
[16:16] any sentence comma whatever it might be
[16:18] [music] that God's word is everlasting
[16:21] true. It's inspired and written and we
[16:23] stay [music] with it.
