========================================
foreign [Music] God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your co-host Pastor Jesse Smith today in episode 27 I'll be again recording solo as brother amen was unavailable for this recording he and I hope to record Another podcast together in a few weeks by the grace of God in today's podcast we're going to complete part two on the topic of are you the message yesterday on March 28th I put out part one and so today I'll finish this subject with a part two in part one we covered a message definition is essential then we covered defining the message and ended with Bible uses of the word message here in part two we'll cover six foundational quotes from Brother Branham that help us Define the message and lastly we'll look at the written Epistles question so let's begin with six foundational quotes that help Define the message the first foundational quote is what I call the think it through quote from Brother Branham this quote comes from questions and answers part 3 1964. brother Branham is asked if he is more than a man since he can create and Jesus can look just like brother Branham I love brother Brandon's answer he says you're so close to being the truth yet you're so far from the truth and he tells the people they're close to making an antichrist statement but brother random explains he's just Anointed with his spirit and doesn't have the fullness of the anointing like Jesus had because the Bible said in Colossians chapter 1 and Colossians chapter 2 that the fullness of the godhead dwelt in Christ bodily so Jesus had the fullness of the Holy Ghost anointing but we have the Holy Ghost anointing in a small measure and I only play a portion of this quote because this is a long quote and I'll play the parts that help us understand this topic by God's grace let's listen to the quote just like brother bran now let me the person said this whoever it might be I don't know and I am your brother see Jesus is your savior I cannot be your savior for he has already saved you now you're so close to being the truth there and yet so far from the truth the person that told this person this not sister now brother Brandon uh could Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or something like that one says the word that's exactly the truth another sense the word is an antichrist that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist amen amen for that person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of the Majesty owner and will come again in great power and Glory but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him exactly the truth and you become Christ remember my message on Messiahs see you are the word Messiah means on the anointed one now you are if you have the Holy Spirit you become the anointed one see then there's all kinds of anointed ones now watch if it's a Bible anointed one I remember we are not the word but we are the word now you got it Jesus was not God but he was God he was a man yet he was God now you understand we are not we are Messiahs but not that Jesus he is our father we're just Anointed with his spirit and that's reason his life and that because people see if you don't sit and thinking through it gives people to believe well this guy would be the Messiah sure he is this one over here it could be they both are how can it be two of them there's thousands of them see so now that we've heard that quote remember friends we have to think it through when we're making a declaration perhaps it would be a new declaration in this case we must think it through and people say you are the message that's so close to the truth but yet it's so far from the truth for example what if somebody told you you know brother or you know Sister you really need to go study the message more what does that mean does that mean you need to study my life more because I am the message of course not what we mean is listen to brother Ram's tapes read your Bible because the message is the scriptures the Holy Ghost is fulfilling right now I remember friends brother random said one sense of a word can be truth but then another sense of the same word could be an antichrist so that's what Satan's trying to do Satan's trying to make message people exalt themselves so they get Glory but the Bible said God will not share his glory with anyone else so friends when we hear preachers preach if we're hearing something new we got to make sure we set and think it through like brother random says so we don't go overboard on a thought and start believing in Antichrist thought now closely related to this first foundational quote is this statement by Brother Branham when he says prophets are the word of God so I'm going to play a quote from the way of a true Prophet from May 13 1962 brother Branham says the prophet is the word of God because he's carrying the word of God but then the month before brother Branham said prophets wasn't the word but the word came to them now this is such an important topic because Jeffersonville and the voice of God company say brother Branham is the word of God because he's a prophet and then they make every word of brother Branham thus saith the Lord because brother random said a prophet is the word of God so this is the quote voice of God in Jeffersonville has not sat and thought through as brother Ram told them Jeffersonville has taken an antichrist Spirit by calling every word brother Branham said thus saith the Lord they've made brother Branham infallible by saying every word he said was thus saith the Lord so let's begin by listening to the first quote from the way of a true prophet of God he only goes in the name of the Lord for one thing he's got him a mission and he said of the Lord and He is the word of God because he's carrying the word of the Lord that is a true prophet of the Lord my text is the way of a true prophet of God so in one sense of the word yes the prophet is carrying the word of God but he is not fully the word of God a human Prophet is not a hundred percent God again if he's born again in the soul he has a measure of God's spirit as the Bible says but he is not 100 percent divine nature now let's listen to the quote from the restoration the bride tree one month previous when brother Branham said prophets wasn't the word but the word came to them and then he says Jesus was the word because Jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodily let's listen to the quote Jesus wouldn't have had to do that for he was the word and we are not the word the word of the Lord came to the prophets they wasn't the word but the word come to them and Jesus wiser he didn't have to pray he was God himself so I like this quote from restoration the bride tree where brother Brown says the prophet is not the word but the word comes to him this is the best way to say it regarding brother Branham or Saint Paul or any other Prophet or else you get unbalanced like voice of God Recordings and the Branham Tabernacle today and then you make every word of brother Branham thus saith the Lord but that's Antichrist there's numerous times brother Branham said this is not the Lord this is just me brother Ram said there's Mix-Ups on the tapes so I hope these examples with this first foundational quote and these quotes about prophets being the word have helped clarify more on this subject for you now we see the importance and necessity of understanding quotes friends most people in the message don't seek understanding they don't study enough nor do they pray for Revelation they just want an easy believism they don't want to understand because it takes too much time and friends I think many people are just consumed with the cares of this world and they only spend time with God at church and that's really sad but God commands us to grow in wisdom judgment and understanding as we showed in part one and that's what will separate the wise virgin from the foolish virgin wise versions understand the will of God and do not exalt themselves in Pride that's according to Ephesians 1 7 and 8 where the Bible said God has abounded toward us in all wisdom Colossians 1 verses 9 10 and 11 where Paul prays that we might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding and we would be increasing in the knowledge of God we see the same thought in Philippians 1 verses 9 and 10 Paul prayed our love would abound and we'd have more knowledge and all judgment so we could approve things that are excellent so this is why we approve of truth that has been rightly divided but we disapprove of Lies coming out of Jeffersonville and other churches that call themselves The Greatest Christians of all time and so forth second Peter 3 Verse 18 says we're to grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we can't get stagnant as message Believers we've got to rightly divide the word of Truth we've got to prove all things study ourselves approved unto God the second foundational quote is that brother Branham said the message was not his message so if every word is thus say the Lord friends then brother Ram's message was not his own if the message was not his own how could he be one with the message so you can see again that thinking falls apart brother Ram could not be the message and then not have the message and we'll also look at another quote where brother Brown says the message was his message so we learned from this that in one sense the word or message that brother random preached wasn't his message because it did not originate from his own mind the message originated from the mind of God but then in another sense it was his message to preach as the seventh Church age Messenger as the fourth Elijah anointed Prophet to the Gentiles so let's listen to the quotes to be the truth that was from birth pains 1965. now the next quote is from a shame 1965. brother random says he's like Ellie easer Abraham's faithful servant and he says that's right with his message pulling out the bride 24 7. and my ease are Abraham's faithful servant the model server of the Bible being sent to help the bride for Isaac kills run over me cheers so let's do his brother Brandon said let's think it through brother random said the message wasn't his will that make sense in one sense because it did not originate from Brother Branham it came from God but in other sense it was his message to preach that was his calling from God it was his duty from God to preach the bible promises for his day now the third foundational quote is brother random separated himself from being the message this quote is from Look Away to Jesus 1963 brother random said I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world he said the message will go on let's listen to the quote I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world all right John the Baptist was sent the forerun the first coming so is the message before on the second coming and John said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world so it's parallel it in every way and I know it will a message Will Go On friends now let's think this quote through like brother random said this quote shows brother random was not the message because he said I may not do it and I remember in the previous quote brother random said it was not his message so we got to balance all these quotes and rightly divide the word of Truth so this quote again proves brother Branham was not the message he was a carrier of the message but he was not the message brother and makes it clear the message would go on but he would not go on in other words he would die and friends that's exactly what happened brother Brandon passed away in 1965 but the message has gone on and you and I have received it by the grace of God here's the fourth foundational quote but the branch says take the message into your heart this is from the token sermon September 1st 1963. let's listen to the quote [Applause] that's good but that's just that's just being able to read take the message take your heart must have the token the very light that was in Christ being you asked for you now friends think this quote through brother Brown said take the message take it into your heart how can I take myself into my own heart I can't because I'm not the message I'm a carrier of the message so based upon this quote here's four things we have to gain from the quote the message is Christ or the Holy Spirit since the Corporal body of Jesus is in heaven but the Rams had come into Christ we can't come into Jesus's Corporal body up in heaven but we can come into the body of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost second Christ's message can be on paper or the word of God in written form remember brother Branham said that's just being able to read this shows the absolute can be in two forms spirit and letter the Holy Ghost is the absolute in spirit form but the Bible the word of God is the absolute in letter form so that's where some people stumble today they don't realize the absolute has another form it has the Holy Spirit form and also has the written form as brother Ram said the word of God was his absolute brother Bram never said my tapes are the absolute third you have to obey the messenger who's who is pointing you to receive Christ if I am the message why do I need to obey anything I already am the message so that makes no sense friends we got to sit down and think it through and fourth and finally the message is on paper and is Spirit we take the spirit into our heart or Soul not the paper form of the message so based upon this quote you cannot be the message because you are not the token which is the message and you cannot receive yourself and you are not Christ Christ is the sender of the message the fifth foundational quote is where brother Brown says the message will be right with us this quote's from questions and answers part 2 1964. brother Ram's talking about the future home and he says you won't have to drive over from Birmingham to hear the message the message will be right with us then won't it so friends think it through how can the message be right with us if we are the message that doesn't make sense but first let's listen to the quote it'll be a wonderful wonderful time we're looking for that day God hasten it to come that great City sitting there I think it will not you think 1500 miles high that's what the Bible said now based upon this quote friends you cannot be the message because first you are not the message in the future home second the message will be heard from the lips of Jesus Christ in the future home making Jesus the sender of the message and his word the message and third the message was being preached by Brother Branham in different cities around the U.S so the message was the word of God shared from God through brother Branham to us and if the people were the message why were they driving from City to city or state to state to hear themselves that makes no sense the people who are driving from City to City because they wanted to hear the message more Revelation from the Holy Ghost about the scriptures God was fulfilling in their day the sixth and final foundational quote is from the Rapture sermon 1965 where in brotherbraham defined the message I love this quote brother Branham says the message is God's promise of the hour it's the bible promises God was scripturally vindicating in brother Ram's life let's listen to the quote many of you strangers perhaps hear these men get up and they make these remarks about a message at this hour and so forth what they are getting at is God's promise of this hour that he promised what he would do and we seem scripturally vindicating just exactly what he said he would do in the same manner we're told it's just exactly perfectly each time because it's God saying it now based upon this quote you cannot be the message because first the message is the Bible verses God was vindicating in brother Ram's time just like the verses God was vindicating in the prophet Paul's Ministry in Acts 17 verse 11. the hearers of the message in Paul's day were the bereans and they could search the Scriptures Daily to make sure Paul's message lined up with the Old Testament message and it did because it was the Fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy the same is true today we heard brother random's message then we searched the Scriptures Daily to confirm brother random's message was the right message second the Bible verses of brother Ram's message were foretold up to two thousand years ago well before any of us were born so we cannot be the message because we weren't even here 2000 years ago and third the message is what God Said which all of God's word has to be thus saith the Lord but very little of what we say is thus saith the Lord so we cannot be the message foreign ly let's look at the written Epistles question friends after I wrote a podcast about these statements where preachers were calling themselves the message a dear brother a precious Pastor asked me a question about second Corinthians 3 1-3 it was a great question he said do these verses prove we are the message so let me read them first second Corinthians 3 1-3 Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known in red of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart so this is a great scripture and a great question I highly respected this question because the Bible says we are declared to be the Epistle of Christ the letter of Christ now my reply was no these verses do not prove we are the message first if we are the message then we would have to deny the previous six quotes on this podcast for example the sixth quote from the Rapture 1965 said the message was God's thus saith the Lord foretold promises if we think it through friends we are not Gods thus saith the Lord foretold promises and if we were then we would have to believe everything every one of us said who believe this message and say everything we said was thus saith the Lord but we all know we're fallible creatures I am not infallible no one is infallible outside of Jesus Christ and like the previous quote brother Branham said where they had to drive from Birmingham to other cities to hear the message they weren't driving to see themselves they weren't driving to hear themselves they were driving to hear more of the message more of God's promised truce for their day so getting back to Second Corinthians 3 1-3 in the context this means Paul was saying preachers carried letters of recommendation with them when they were traveling and meeting new believers in different home churches or gatherings and Paul said the lives of the believing Corinthians were his letters of recommendation so Paul didn't need to carry letters of recommendation because the Believers he preached to were his living written Epistles now friends this scripture does prove our lives are like letters of recommendation for those that preach to us the word of life or the message of the hour so again this scripture shows we are carriers of the message but we cannot be the message because we are fallible we do not always represent Christ and Obey him plus we have six other quotes we read earlier that prove we are not the message so friends C sometimes scriptures are so close but yet so far away as brother Branham said let me go back to this previous example I'll close with this if I say I am the message and then I say yet you need to go study the message this is a deceptive comment because it doesn't make sense if I say I'm the message and you need to study the message then essentially you're saying you need to study my life you need to hang around me and study me so in that sentence I am the message yet you need to study the message the word message has lost its definition and that's the same deception as someone saying God is three persons yet one God the word person has lost its meaning so friends we cannot say we are the message we need to tell people you need to receive the message the message is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and all the other scriptures God is fulfilling in this day so I want to thank God for his strength to rightly divide the word of truth I want to thank God for his Simplicity and ask God to help us continually show humility foreign friends now these two latest podcasts have paved the way for the next topic which is 26 Bible verses brother random used to define the message by God's grace I've been teaching our children in our church these truths in our Sunday School classes which are basically our 3 P.M Sunday Services because we don't have any Sunday school teachers other than myself friends there could be more than 26 Bible verses I'm sure there's more than 26 but as of right now that's how many I've found and brother random uses all these verses to Define what the message is so Lord willing maybe next week or in a little while I'll be able to make the podcast or videos on this topic God bless you friends as the Holy Ghost anoints you to defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ as Paul also said in Philippians 1 verse 17 he said knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel [Music] news that Jesus [Music] rethane Jesus forever Hammer never fail [Music] foreign
