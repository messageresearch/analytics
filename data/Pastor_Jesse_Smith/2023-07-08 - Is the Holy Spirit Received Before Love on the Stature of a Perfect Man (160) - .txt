TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question do I believe that a person receives the holy spirit before love on the stature of a perfect man this is an excellent question on the statute of a perfect man I wrote extensively on this subject using many Bible verses in chapter 5 of my 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed if you do an online image search about the Statue of a perfect man you'll find most images that look like this that add holy spirit before love also here's an image of a magnet I received from voice of God Recordings many years ago I love the magnet but it has the holy spirit before love So my answer to the question is no I do not believe the Holy Spirit baptism in the soul is received before love on the stature of a perfect man here's an image I use to teach the stature perfect man from the Bible it dovetails with brother Graham's teaching on the three works of Grace faith is justification virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness are sanctification the third step is the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the love of God or the holy spirit that seals a person's soul unto the day of redemption I believe each of the seven attributes of the stature of perfect man are a portion or measure of the Holy Ghost until love caps off the soul or seals the soul of the individual and love is the Holy Ghost according to the Bible and brother Branham so I believe brother Branham grew in his Revelation on this subject which proves he was Guided by the Holy Ghost into all truth as with numerous other subjects so I want to make two points first I want to point to the Bible we'll look at three verses second Peter 1 verses 5 through 7. and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to barely kindness charity notice according to the infallible word of God there is no holy spirit before charity in the Holy Bible random teaches us that the Holy Ghost will only point to the word of God and the word of God is always right also First Corinthians chapter 13 the entire chapter I'm not going to read the entire chapter but this chapter confirms charity is the last portion of the Holy Ghost to receive which agrees with second Peter 1 verse 7 and then thirdly first John 4 verse 8 proves God is charity for charity is love and first John 4 8 says for God is love before moving on to the second Point recall this church age Book quote from page 83 brother Brandon said when the prophet to the laodicean church age is come you will know him for he will be quote in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iota end quote I'm sure you'll never forget the other scriptures like proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 that says add thou not unto God's words lest God call you a liar and revelation 22 verses 18 and 19 that says if any man adds to the word of God plagues will be added to him or if any man takes away from the word of God his name will be taken out of the book of life so we know brother Branham pointed us to the true revelation of the word of God and so according to the word of God there is no holy spirit before love because love is the Holy Spirit second let's look at quotes from Brother Branham remember brother random preached stature perfect man on October 14 1962. one month later brother Ram did not mention holy spirit before charity or love in the sermon all things November 24 1962. brother Brandon said quote the faith that you've got in him add to that virtue and to that broadly kindness second Peter 1 verse 7 until you're built in the full stature of Christ then the last thing is love which God the Holy Spirit seals you to your destination end quote other important quotes include demonology 1953 quote and the Holy Spirit is God and God is love end quote everlasting life and how to receive it in 1954 brother random said quote an everlasting life is God and God is the holy spirit is that right if God in the Holy Spirit isn't the same person Jesus had two fathers end quote so the quotes from Brother Branham are playing that God is love God is the holy spirit so the Holy Spirit and love are the self-same spirit I'll close by reminding our viewers that up until the seals were open brother Branham taught the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost were two separate things there's numerous quotes on this uh the one I'll read is from countdown 1962 but the RAM said quote and the new birth as people talks that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a new birth now that's wrong the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from the New Birth the new birth is when you're born again but the Holy Ghost is when power comes into that birth for service end quote now friends after the opening of The Seven Seals we know God began finishing all the Mysteries and so when brother Brandon preached the token in November of 63 brother random used baptism of the Holy Ghost and New Birth interchangeably so a little over a year after that 62 countdown quote brother random had received the Revelation from God that the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the new birth were one in the same brother Ram's quote says quote it belongs to you when this token is upon you and God has sealed you now we want to check ourselves just for a moment when God has given you the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you now that's true and every Theologian will have to admit that to be yes sir it's the new birth you're born to new of the Holy Ghost end quote and then the most clear quote on this is from the Sumerian Church age chapter four in the church age book page 154. brother Brown says quote what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it is a spirit of God coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience toward God end quote in closing I hope this answer was a blessing and may the Holy Ghost continue to guide you into all truth as Jesus Promised in John 16 verse 13 also friends I'm open to correction so I'll appreciate any feedback if I'm wrong but this is the best of my understanding up to this point by the grace of God and I always want to grow in Grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ as Peter commands Us in the scripture as always if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
