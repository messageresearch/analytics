[0:12] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:14] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:17] this video is to answer the question why
[0:19] do some Christian women keep their hair
[0:21] very long and
[0:25] uncut this is a fair and honest question
[0:28] that a lot of people probably wonder but
[0:30] might not have the answers to so is our
[0:33] desire to humbly share by the Bible and
[0:35] by history why we believe God is still
[0:38] asking Christian women today to keep
[0:40] their hair long and uncut their entire
[0:43] lives God In His Holy Bible states that
[0:47] there must be a difference between the
[0:48] hair length of men and women the Bible
[0:51] says that in the New Testament it is a
[0:53] shame for a man to have long uncut hair
[0:57] according to 1 Corinthians 11:14
[1:02] and it is a shame for a woman to have
[1:04] hair cut or shorn even to have a shaved
[1:07] head according to 1 Corinthians
[1:15] 11:6 the hair length of men and women
[1:17] should be opposite short hair for men
[1:20] and long uncut hair for women we will
[1:24] now examine five New Testament texts
[1:26] that support this sound
[1:28] Doctrine new Testament teaching on hair
[1:33] length the only reason we believe God is
[1:35] asking women to have long uncut hair is
[1:39] because the Bible commands women to have
[1:41] long uncut hair in the New Testament and
[1:44] we cannot find a place where God asked
[1:46] any godly woman whether in the New
[1:48] Testament or the Old Testament to cut or
[1:51] trim her hair in any way in the New
[1:54] Testament God never asked a woman to cut
[1:56] her hair in any way ever
[2:00] the main New Testament text for teaching
[2:02] on hair length is 1 Corinthians 11:
[2:07] 1-16 let's go through this text and
[2:09] explain the truth that has been laying
[2:11] in the scripture for nearly 2,000
[2:14] years verses 1 and two speak of St Paul
[2:18] urging the Corinthians to continue to
[2:20] follow his ordinances because he was
[2:22] taught the gospel by Christ himself
[2:25] Galatians 1: 11- 12 validate this
[2:30] verse three lists the god ordained
[2:32] headship Paul preached man is head over
[2:35] the woman Christ is head over the man
[2:37] and God the Eternal invisible spirit is
[2:40] head over Christ this headship or order
[2:44] of leadership is important because in
[2:46] Verses 4 5 and 6 Paul Begins the
[2:49] instruction on hair so hair length is a
[2:52] god- ordained symbol of Authority or
[2:55] leadership here on Earth amongst humans
[2:58] a man dishonors Christ if he covers his
[3:01] head which means he lets his hair grow
[3:04] long as verse 14 says it is a shame for
[3:07] a man to have long
[3:08] hair a woman dishonors her husband if
[3:12] she prays or prophesies with an
[3:14] uncovered head verse 15 teaches that a
[3:17] woman's long uncut hair is given her for
[3:20] a covering since it is a shame for a
[3:23] woman to be shorn which means to have
[3:25] short hair or shaven which means all
[3:28] hair cut off let her be covered or let
[3:31] her have long uncut hair please know
[3:34] that the covering of a woman is not a
[3:37] cap as can be seen by certain Amish
[3:39] menonite and other religious
[3:42] sects the Bible itself described what
[3:45] the covering of a woman must be it is
[3:47] long uncut hair according to 1
[3:49] Corinthians
[3:53] 11:15 there is no scripture that says a
[3:56] cap is given her for a covering verse
[4:00] 7-2 explain why women should have long
[4:03] hair because they came out of man in the
[4:05] beginning and were created for the man
[4:08] long hair on a woman is the sign of her
[4:11] husband's authority over her as the
[4:13] husband's authority over the wife is
[4:16] taught all throughout the Bible
[4:17] according to Genesis 3:16 and Ephesians
[4:20] 5: 22-
[4:23] 24 in verses
[4:26] 13-6 Paul asked the Corinthians to judge
[4:28] themselves is it calmly or fit for woman
[4:32] to pray to God uncovered with Shore or
[4:35] shaved head Paul states that nature
[4:38] itself teaches that long hair on a man
[4:41] is a shame modern science says 40% of
[4:44] all men experience baldness so we can
[4:47] again see the infallible truth of the
[4:49] Bible that God allows nature to teach us
[4:52] that long hair on a man is a shame St
[4:56] Paul goes on to teach that if a woman
[4:58] has long hair it is a glory to her
[5:01] because it was given to her for a
[5:04] covering based upon that Bible word
[5:06] covering we want to share a beautiful
[5:08] scripture from the Old Testament that
[5:10] gives us further understanding of what
[5:12] hair as a natural woman's covering
[5:15] represents to God for the spiritual
[5:17] woman or the church or bride or wife of
[5:20] the Lord Jesus
[5:22] Christ Isaiah 30:1 woe to the rebellious
[5:26] children sayeth the Lord that take
[5:28] counsel but not of me and that cover
[5:31] with a covering but not of my spirit
[5:34] that they may add sin to
[5:36] sin the natural human bride has a
[5:39] covering and it is her hair according to
[5:41] 1 Corinthians
[5:42] 11:15 this is a symbol that she is honor
[5:45] the authority of her ruler her
[5:48] husband the spiritual bride or the
[5:50] Church of the Living God has a covering
[5:53] and it is the holy spirit of God
[5:55] according to Isaiah
[5:57] 30:1 the presence of the covering of the
[5:59] anointing of the Holy Ghost proves she
[6:02] is under the authority of her ruler
[6:04] Christ Jesus her husband secondly the
[6:08] natural bride has untrimmed uncut hair
[6:11] according to 1 Corinthians 11: 5 and 6
[6:14] the spiritual bride the Bride of Jesus
[6:16] Christ she lives by every word that the
[6:19] Holy Spirit wrote taking nothing away
[6:22] from the word of God based upon Matthew
[6:24] 4:4 and Revelation 22: 18 and 19 this
[6:29] church will not trim off parts of the
[6:31] Bible or neglect to preach any truth of
[6:34] God whether Society agrees with it or
[6:37] not thirdly for the natural bride to cut
[6:41] her hair means to deny her husband glory
[6:44] and herself Glory according to 1
[6:46] Corinthians 11:5 and also verse 15 but
[6:50] if a woman have long hair it is a glory
[6:52] to
[6:53] her for the spiritual bride to reject
[6:57] one word of the Bible is to deny Christ
[7:00] glory in her life but the true church
[7:03] progresses in their walk with God from
[7:05] glory to more Glory according to 2
[7:08] Corinthians
[7:10] 3:18 as we return to 1 Corinthians chap
[7:12] 11 St Paul ends this portion of the
[7:15] scripture by answering the question he
[7:17] asked in verse 13 is it fit for a woman
[7:20] to pray to God uncovered with short hair
[7:23] or a shaved head the Apostle says
[7:27] despite some being contentious about the
[7:29] this topic of hair length we have no
[7:32] such custom or no practice of women
[7:35] praying to God with short hair neither
[7:38] do the Churches of God the Churches of
[7:40] God in the days of St Paul did not allow
[7:43] women to prophesy or pray to God with
[7:45] short hair nor men to pray to God with
[7:48] long hair we believe that St Paul taught
[7:52] this doctrine of women wearing long
[7:54] uncut hair and men with short hair in
[7:57] every church he visited because of 1
[8:00] Corinthians 4:1 17 for this cause have I
[8:04] sent unto you timotheus who is my
[8:06] beloved Son and faithful in the Lord who
[8:09] shall bring you into remembrance of my
[8:11] ways which be in Christ as I teach
[8:14] everywhere in every
[8:16] Church there are four more New Testament
[8:19] texts that go along with 1 Corinthians
[8:22] 11 for a total of five to help us see
[8:25] the truth of God's desire for specific
[8:27] hair lengths for men and women
[8:30] John 11: 1 and 2 and John 12:
[8:35] 1-8 these two texts describe Mary the
[8:38] sister of Lazarus who anointed Jesus
[8:40] with ointment now a certain man was sick
[8:43] named Lazareth of Bethany the town of
[8:45] Mary and her sister Martha it was that
[8:48] Mary which anointed the Lord with
[8:50] ointment and wiped his feet with her
[8:52] hair whose brother Lazareth was sick
[8:55] John 12:3 then took Mary a pound of
[8:58] ointment of nerd very costly and
[9:01] anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his
[9:03] feet with her hair and the house was
[9:05] filled with the odor of the
[9:07] ointment this undeniable Bible witness
[9:10] helps prove that women in the days of
[9:12] Jesus did not cut their hair because it
[9:15] would be impossible for a woman with
[9:17] short hair to wash the feet of Jesus
[9:19] Christ short bobbed hair could not wrap
[9:22] around the feet of Jesus and act as a
[9:25] towel to clean and anoint those precious
[9:28] holy feet
[9:30] Mary the sister of Lazarus is a New
[9:32] Testament Bible witness that women must
[9:35] have long uncut hair in order to do the
[9:38] perfect will of the Lord if Mary had
[9:41] short bobbed hair she could not have
[9:43] honored the Lord Jesus Christ in this
[9:45] way before his death Luke 7:
[9:51] 36-50 this text in Luke 7 is very
[9:54] similar to that of John 12:3 as Luke
[9:58] speaks of a woman which was a sinner who
[10:00] went to the house of Simon the
[10:02] Pharisee she must have seen how the
[10:04] Servants of Simon and perhaps Simon
[10:06] himself did not kiss Jesus or wash his
[10:09] feet upon his entrance or anoint his
[10:12] head with oil and being moved by her
[10:15] love for Christ as Savior cease not to
[10:18] kiss his feet and anoint them with oil
[10:20] wash them with their tears of repentance
[10:23] and wipe them with the hairs of her head
[10:26] this act of Love caused Jesus to tell
[10:28] her plainly L that her sins were
[10:30] forgiven in verse 48 observe again that
[10:34] this forgiven woman could not have wiped
[10:36] Jesus feet with short bobbed hair she
[10:39] had to have long uncut hair with years
[10:42] of growth in order to wipe those
[10:44] precious feet of the Lord Jesus
[10:47] Christ Revelation
[10:50] 9:8 this text in Revelation 9 is another
[10:54] true witness from the Bible that
[10:56] emphasizes different hair lengths for
[10:58] men and women
[10:59] and they had hair as the hair of women
[11:02] and their teeth were as a teeth of
[11:04] lions Revelation 98 is part of a
[11:07] striking portion of scripture about the
[11:09] tribulation period detailed in chapter
[11:11] 9:
[11:13] 3-10 under the fifth trumpet during the
[11:16] tribulation God will allow locusts to
[11:18] torment unbelievers and those who have
[11:21] rejected Jesus Christ as Lord and ruler
[11:23] of their lives one of the physical
[11:26] attributes of these locusts is that they
[11:28] have hair as the hair of women we must
[11:31] ask ourselves what is hair that is the
[11:34] hair of women what style of hair do
[11:37] these locusts have if we look at
[11:39] American society today there's hardly
[11:42] any difference between the hair length
[11:43] of men and women most women cut and Bob
[11:46] their hair and it is rare to find a
[11:48] woman who lets her hair grow long and
[11:50] uncut as the Bible teaches women to do
[11:54] so we must not look to society to Define
[11:56] hair length but instead the Bible and
[11:59] God himself must Define hair length if
[12:02] we are going to be sincere
[12:04] Christians if we take an honest look at
[12:07] the Bible and let the Bible provide
[12:09] definitions for itself we will easily
[12:12] understand that hair as the hair of
[12:14] women means long uncut hair for the
[12:17] Bible describes God's requirements for
[12:19] different hair lengths for men and women
[12:22] which is straight from the word of God
[12:23] as we mentioned in 1 Corinthians 11
[12:27] 1-16 so then these Loc have long uncut
[12:30] hair as a torment to the Christ
[12:33] rejecting people who willingly took the
[12:35] mark of the
[12:36] beast we understand that God may be
[12:39] allowing these locusts to torment or
[12:41] haunt the Sinners and bible rejectors
[12:44] who must endure the tribulation because
[12:47] all of them have refused to honor God's
[12:49] commands about salvation the baptism of
[12:52] the Holy Ghost and even hair length they
[12:55] allowed their women to Bob their hair
[12:57] and dishonor their husband and God's
[13:00] word and never taught against men
[13:02] growing their hair out long to look like
[13:04] women they took away truth from the
[13:06] Bible and failed to preach the entire
[13:09] Holy
[13:10] Bible we conclude this section by saying
[13:13] that no New Testament scripture supports
[13:15] Christian women cutting their hair and
[13:17] if you find any Scripture that does
[13:19] please let us know for it will help us
[13:21] to teach God's word in all truth as we
[13:23] are striving to do daily
[13:26] [Music]

[13:37] Bible please contact us God bless you
[13:41] and may Jesus Christ be the desire of
[13:43] your heart
