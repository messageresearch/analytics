[0:06] greetings friends in the match's name of
[0:09] the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:11] this video is to answer the question do
[0:14] Old Testament abominations apply to
[0:16] Christians the answer is yes in most
[0:19] cases but there are a few exceptions
[0:21] which I will teach in this video the
[0:23] reason these abominations still applies
[0:25] because the Holy Ghost gives New
[0:27] Testament bible scriptures that keep
[0:30] these moral laws against abominations in
[0:33] effect for Christians with two or three
[0:35] witnesses definition and scope an
[0:39] abomination is one specific type of
[0:42] moral law that means a disgusting thing
[0:44] in the sight of God according to the
[0:46] Hebrew lexicon Deuteronomy 12 verse 31
[0:49] states that God hates abominations God's
[0:52] holy Eternal City the New Jerusalem will
[0:55] not have any abominable work within its
[0:57] domain
[1:00] since there are 166 scriptures that
[1:03] mention abominations it behooves us to
[1:05] know which acts are abominations in the
[1:08] sight of God today because we want to
[1:10] live in the New Jerusalem with Christ
[1:12] for all eternity three fulfilled
[1:16] abominations for Christians after eating
[1:19] all 166 abomination scriptures I have
[1:22] found three Old Testament abominations
[1:25] that are no longer abominable in the
[1:27] sight of God for the New Testament
[1:29] believer eating a peace offering on the
[1:32] third day offering a blemished animal
[1:34] sacrifice and eating unclean foods
[1:39] eating a peace offering on the third day
[1:41] is no longer an abomination because New
[1:43] Testament believers are no longer
[1:45] required to offer animal sacrifices as
[1:47] Jesus Christ was the once-for-all
[1:50] sacrifice that God has provided for
[1:53] believers Jesus is both our offering and
[1:56] peace as we have peace with God through
[1:58] our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:00] offering a blemish animal sacrifice is
[2:03] no longer an abomination in the New
[2:05] Testament because we have already
[2:07] established that God gave us the
[2:08] offering of the body of Jesus Christ to
[2:11] replace the blood of bulls and goats but
[2:14] it is important to note that our worship
[2:15] in the New Testament must be according
[2:17] to the spirit and truth or else the
[2:20] worship is offered in vain there's a
[2:22] spiritual application of this Old
[2:24] Testament abomination that we can apply
[2:26] to our worship today as we must offer
[2:28] our bodies as a living sacrifice unto
[2:31] God unclean foods from the Israeli diet
[2:35] are no longer abominations for the New
[2:37] Testament believer as evidenced through
[2:39] Peters heavenly vision in acts 10 verses
[2:42] 9 to 18 the fact that God did away with
[2:45] these dietary abominations was so
[2:47] surprising that Peter told the Lord not
[2:49] so three times after the Lord instructed
[2:52] him to rise kill and eat all manner of
[2:55] four-footed beasts wild beasts creeping
[2:58] things and fowls of the air Paul's
[3:01] teaching supports God's visions to Peter
[3:03] saying for every creature of God is good
[3:06] and nothing to be refused if it be
[3:08] received with Thanksgiving for it is
[3:10] sanctified by the Word of God and prayer
[3:12] the
[3:13] dietary restrictions for Christians are
[3:15] not eating blood strangled animals or
[3:18] foods dedicated unto idols abominations
[3:23] still in effect for Christians here is a
[3:26] partial list of the abominations that
[3:28] still remain detestable to God and the
[3:31] New Testament believer and are
[3:32] categorized as moral laws still in
[3:35] effect for Jews and Christians
[3:37] note that each abomination has at least
[3:39] two or three witnesses according to the
[3:42] rule for establishing an Old Testament
[3:43] moral law as a binding command for the
[3:46] New Testament believer justifying sin

[5:49] Malachi 3:6 Hebrews 4:15 and Hebrews
[5:53] 13:8 to better understand the
[5:55] abomination of crossdressing please see
[5:58] my video called long dresses in the
[5:59] Bible another video that will help you
[6:03] understand this abomination is my video
[6:06] called the four guidelines for modest
[6:08] clothing
[6:10] guideline number three is gender
[6:12] specific clothing God wants men to wear
[6:15] men's clothing and women to wear women's
[6:18] clothing cross-dressing is called an
[6:21] abomination or disgusting thing and no
[6:24] New Testament scripture permits it
[6:25] the reason cross-dressing remains
[6:28] detestable in the New Testament is
[6:29] because God said he is unchanging
[6:32] according to Malachi 3:6 his holy nature
[6:34] of hoard all evil abominable acts
[6:37] yesterday and abhors them today and will
[6:40] abhor them forever for Jesus Christ is
[6:43] the same yesterday today and forever
[6:45] notice that Jesus never crossed dressed
[6:47] like a woman Hebrews 4:15 teaches that
[6:50] Jesus never broke one Old Testament
[6:52] commandment since cross-dressing was
[6:55] strictly forbidden the law of Moses
[6:56] Jesus never wore clothes that pertain to
[6:59] a woman furthermore Jesus instituted the
[7:02] New Testament and the kingdom of God
[7:04] upon this earth while wearing men's
[7:06] garments Jesus modeled and lived this
[7:08] standard during his earthly life if
[7:10] Jesus is the same forever then he will
[7:13] remain dressed like a man forever
[7:15] throughout time and then into eternity
[7:18] in closing I hope this video was a
[7:22] blessing and enlighten your eyes about
[7:24] the revelations in the Bible concerning
[7:26] abominations God's immutable character
[7:30] allows us to rightly divide the word of
[7:31] God about the actions that either gain
[7:34] his approval or disapproval blessing or
[7:36] curse as Satan increases his attacks
[7:39] against the true church faithful Bible
[7:42] teachers need to continue giving more of
[7:43] their time focus attention and energy
[7:46] into denouncing abominations and feeding
[7:49] the people of God the truth true
[7:52] doctrine will say both the preacher and
[7:53] those that believe him
[7:57] if you have any questions about
[7:59] abominations or any other Bible
[8:02] questions please contact us god bless
[8:08] you and may Jesus Christ be the desire
[8:10] of your heart
