TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Now look this way you y'all. Now that's just like it is when it comes on the glory here. See it come. It's a light where you're you're moving here. You see? Now look. It's just it's just a reflection. Just a reflection. That is See, it's not the light. Here's the light hanging right here. See? Right here. This woman. I just happened to catch it. I thought it was over somebody. [Music] Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to show the quote from God's prophet, brother Brandham, when the pillar of fire became visible in Brandham Tabernacle at the conclusion of his series on the seven church ages. This recording is from January the 8th, 1961. The sermon is called Revelation 4, part 3. I always love listening to this quote. It's so supernatural. It's so emotional. But before we hear the quote, I'd like to first give a Bible foundation for the seven church ages. I wrote an entire chapter about this topic, the seven church ages, in my 2021 book, The 12 New Testament Mysteries Revealed. The foundation for the seven church ages in the Bible is Revelation 1 20. The Bible calls the church ages the mystery of the seven stars and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the seven angels or church age messengers in the hand of Christ. And of course, the seven golden candlesticks are the seven church ages. The word ages is used in the King James version. Paul talked about previous ages before his age. That's in Colossians 1 26. So there was past ages. Ephesians 3:5 also says there was past ages. And then Ephesians 3:21 says there's future ages. Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. So it's undeniable that the Bible teaches there was past ages and future ages. It's thus sayaith the Lord. It's thus sayith the scripture. So anyone that denies church ages is probably just ignorant of the Bible or maybe they have an antichrist spirit. Either way, we can pray for them by the grace of God. And also I'd like to play this quote from God's prophet brother Brandham from the seventh seal March 1963 where he says the revelations of the seven seals lined up with the revelations from the seven church ages with thus say the lord. So that means we know the revelations contained in the sermon series on the seven church ages and the sermon series on the seven seals are thus sayith the lord from the lord. Not every word though on those sermons are thus sayith the lord. Only the revelations from Jesus given to brother Brandham are thus sayith the Lord. Let's listen to the quote. Now the vision plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together. So I could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of God and the vision and the revelation, the interpretation thereof is thus saith the Lord. Also one more verse. Revelation 10:1-7, the mighty angel comes down, Christ. He brings down an open book. The book that was previously sealed in heaven, now has been opened. Jesus has broken the seven seals. He's revealed them, of course, to John in the symbol form in around 90 or 180 sometime in there. And then Christ coming down here in Revelation 10:1-7 is the Holy Ghost coming down to visit brother Brandham and reveal the secrets of the seven seals. and seven church ages to brother Brandham. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared unto his servants, the prophets, the mystery of God is finished through the ministry of the seventh angel or the seventh church age messenger. And we know that is William Brandham by the grace of God. Now, let's listen to this quote from January 8th, 1961. There's a blank spot on the tape, but we'll pick it up around paragraph 381. Brother Ram tells the people to look this way. It's the light over here. Brother Ram said, "You're seeing one light, but he was seeing two." The people were seeing the supernatural light of the pillar of fire. But brother Ram was able to see the supernatural light of the pillar of fire move over the people during this discernment time. Brother Ram saw over a woman. He said, "Right here at this woman." And then it goes to a man. And there's a man sitting on the outside here. He's from Seymour, Indiana. God heals him of a stroke. So, I want you to hear the emotion, the worship. Such an emotional time here. What a wonderful visitation of the Holy Ghost visiting Brother Brandham and the saints there. Let's listen to the quote. Now, look this way, y'all. Now, that's just like it is when he comes on the glory here. See? Come. It's a light where you're you're moving here. You see? Now, look. It's just it's just a reflection. just a reflection. That is, see, it's not the light. Here's the light hanging right here. See, right here, this woman, I just happened to catch it. I thought it was over somebody. [Music] Now, you're seeing one, I'm seeing two. One of them is the natural, the other is the supernatural. There's a man sitting on the outside here on this line looking over towards that light struck him. He's from Seymour, Indiana, and he's got had a stroke. If you'll believe, sir, God will heal you of that stroke. [Music] Amen. Believe. Now, you believe with all your heart. Now, I want to show two pictures here. The first picture is an illustration someone made. I saw it on social media a number of years ago and I took a screenshot of it and it shows from the pulpit where brother was speaking the pillar of fire shaded the church ages in the back left corner. So from his perspective, it was in the back left. And then in 2018, I visited the Brandham Tabernacle and had a tour and they told me the current place where it is is the place right above the windows of the cry room or the mother's nursery. So you can see a picture of that. Here's these four black windows. And they told me it was right above there in that space between the windows and the ceiling where the Holy Ghost fell and shaded out the church. ages as brother Brandham said. Next I want to play a quote from 9 days later. Brother Brandham was preaching in Shreveport, Louisiana, January 17th, 1961. And brother Ram told about this experience and he said the angel of the Lord, the light of the Holy Ghost, the pillar of fire came and stood right amongst the people and it caused a revival in his church. No doubt what a supernatural time in the Lord Jesus Christ that would have been. And brother Ram quotes the book of Zechariah that it would be light in the evening time in this dark sinful world. God said he would send his promised light, the Holy Ghost. And he says, "We're privileged people tonight." And what did it bring to us? The revelation of the seven church ages and later brought us the revelation of the seven seals. Let's listen to the quote. Be seated. [Music] It does seem like coming home to come back. We hearing back there from your pastor the wonderful things that the Lord has been doing here at the home church since I was here. Said you've almost had a constant revival of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost. Oh, isn't it wonderful to hit God's time just right high does something to us? Well, we've had one at the tabernacle. uh had a series of subjects I was telling you on the seven last church ages and oh my when I finished up last Sunday with the fourth chapter of Revelations my congregation was about little about 400 people or 350 something like that and I while I was speaking and I called the prayer line and speaking on the reflection from the shakina glory to the stars to the char stars to the sea of glass were the sacrifices was washed, you know, which represents sinners, the waters of separation. And while I was speaking on that and turned then to pray for the sick, the angel of the Lord came right down before them all, went right over and stood in the corner there and 300 or more people stood, looked at it for 15 minutes, screaming, crying, and praising God. All of them looked the first time ever come like that before. Our church just come right in and moved right over there and stood there. I said, "Can you see it?" Everybody again screaming and falling and there it was the big amber light of the pillar of fire just perfectly round standing there. Then it began to shade itself and shaded every one of those church ages just exactly the way I'd taught him in that pillar of fire. God knows that's the truth here before his Bible. He We're living in the end time. Surely that's right. Oh, I'm so glad that the prophet promised it would be light in the evening. In this hour that when it's so dark in the world and to know that we are living and walking in the light, the light that he promised that he would do it, promised he would. And here we are, the privileged people tonight to enjoy those things at the end time. Now remember the church will not be it will not be a great great big something. It's always through every age just in the minority just a little and during the dark age it almost went completely out and then it goes almost out again in this age here at the lady of sin church age. Brother Jack invited me down to preach those seven church ages sometime. I hope I get a chance to do it. Oh, we sure enjoyed at home how the holy spirit blessed us. Next, I just want to show that there were two witnesses at least that testified about seeing this supernatural light there on January 8th, 1961. And I'm getting these from this book called Generation, written, of course, and compiled by Brother Am's granddaughter, Angela Smith. These two people are named Carl Wheeler and Betty Collins. Sister Betty wrote this. I was there when the light appeared on the back wall of the tabernacle at the preaching of the church ages. I was sitting about five rows from the back and on the same side where it appeared. Two girls that I knew were sitting nearby and they had been telling some jokes that were not very good. They told me later that when that light appeared over their heads, they thought they were going to fall over dead. As the light changed shapes, marking the different stages of the church ages, you could feel the presence of the Lord in the building. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus Christ. No doubt the Lord Jesus Christ bringing conviction to those individual girls and bringing vindication to sister Betty for believing the message and of course all the believers there and God's prophet, brother William Brandham. Brother Carl Wheeler wrote this. I was present in the tabernacle when brother Brandham preached the church ages and God himself came down and vindicated that prophet before my eyes. That light that appeared was such a supernatural thing to me. So again, we're thankful for the eyewitnesses who witness the visible appearing of the pillar of fire, the angel of the Lord. These are tremendous testimonies. We rejoice in them. And we rejoice that we've been given a vindicated prophet of God. We have a vindicated prophet, Brother William Brennham, with a vindicated message. It's the Bible revealed, the Bible restored. As Amos 3:7 says, "Surely the Lord God would do nothing, but he revealed his secret unto his servants, the prophets." Friends, Jesus Christ is our satisfaction. We just had a guest preacher preach two services this weekend. The titles were satisfaction and focus. So, I thought I would share that. I'll put links to those sermons in the description here. Let's be satisfied with the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's the only satisfaction in life. Let's keep our focus on the Lord Jesus Christ. Our precious brother Dennis McBride preached some wonderful messages, discerning messages by the gift of the Holy Ghost in his life. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He is never failed. [Music]
