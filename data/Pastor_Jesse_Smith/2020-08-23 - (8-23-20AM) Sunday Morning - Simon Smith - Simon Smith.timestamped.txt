[38:16] abraham
[38:30] pictures

[38:55] there were two men in one city the one
[38:57] rich and the other four
[38:59] the rich man had seen many flocks and
[39:02] herbs but the poor man had nothing
[39:06] saved one little new lamb which he had
[39:09] brought
[39:10] bought in your stuff and he grew up
[39:12] together with him and with his children
[39:14] he would eat of his own needs and drink
[39:16] he drank his own cup and lay in his
[39:18] wisdom and was unto him
[39:25] there came a traveler to the rich man
[39:26] and he spared
[39:28] to take his own flock and of his own
[39:31] herd to dress for the way for a man that
[39:33] was come unto him
[39:35] but took the poor man's land and
[39:36] addressed it adjusted for the man that
[39:38] was come
[39:39] to him
[39:48] [Music]
[39:54] romans
[40:02] all of us in our hearts we keep our
[40:04] desires our hopes our prayers
[40:22] um
[40:35] through the will of god we know
[40:39] that all things work together for the
[40:41] good to them that love
[40:43] god and to them
[40:46] who are called
[40:55] [Music]
[41:04] called and who he called them he also
[41:07] justified him
[41:08] and he would be justified amen amen
[41:33] is
[42:00] hallelujah
[42:14] um
[42:42] um
[42:56] is
[43:09] the next election last one did a major
[43:12] thing
[43:24] um
[43:38] um
[43:52] um
[44:06] that's right
[44:31] [Laughter]
[44:35] want to bring that out there that
[44:37] protect
[44:38] strong enough even
[44:44] yeah i have no shame
[44:48] in the squeeze i'll be happy to find any
[44:49] kind of joke or whatever we find you
[44:50] know whatever
[44:51] god would preserve and give us we would
[44:53] be grateful toothpaste a toothpaste
[44:55] maybe a bristle
[44:56] maybe just something to clean our teeth
[44:58] i'll be happy
[44:59] in that time
[45:13] amen amen
[45:16] and i want to say that
[45:19] because a lot of times
[45:25] and this keeps us humble this
[45:28] a lot of us some of us have made
[45:31] tremendously good choices
[45:33] and have not suffered so much in their
[45:35] lives right
[45:37] right and then others of us have made
[45:40] wrong choices
[45:41] or choices that were maybe not in god's
[45:43] perfect will
[45:44] and wanted
[45:50] and i'll say it like this everything is
[45:52] predestinated
[45:55] every decision you've made
[46:01] right perfect will permissive will
[46:05] was ordained by god
[46:09] everything well brothers what about you
[46:12] know
[46:12] this portion of my life was a really
[46:14] dark portion it was over
[46:17] that's right and brother this this so-so
[46:20] person
[46:20] was annoying to the devil to do this and
[46:22] to do that it was ordained
[46:25] that's right by then
[46:28] uh you'll be able to see clearly you
[46:30] know i'm just a teacher but in a maybe a
[46:33] slow one uh but i want to be a clear one
[46:36] if i could do anything
[46:37] and i want to make if i can't understand
[46:39] it myself and i'll never be able to
[46:41] bring it to you so
[46:42] even though this might be a simple
[46:44] thought i want to be able to bring this
[46:46] to you and show that how god can use
[46:49] even
[46:50] i'd say just not even just say even but
[46:52] god is
[46:53] going to use you and all your
[46:56] faults and all your failures and all
[46:58] your
[46:59] battles and all your and every single
[47:02] thing that you would count and examine
[47:03] your as the bible says to examine
[47:05] oneself right
[47:06] as you examine yourself run through your
[47:08] past and man i if i wouldn't have done
[47:10] this maybe this would happen if i would
[47:11] have done this maybe that wouldn't
[47:12] happen
[47:13] examine yourself and by the end of this
[47:16] you should be able to see that
[47:17] everything is going to work
[47:22] lord because remember you have nothing
[47:25] to do
[47:27] no i mean literally
[47:30] because remember oh well this this
[47:32] brother's strong and this sister strong
[47:34] god gave them that way
[47:42] history to never have been down more
[47:43] than half an hour his entire
[47:45] life god built him
[47:48] that way brother i get depressed for
[47:51] months
[47:52] and six months or a year at a time you
[47:54] were built
[47:55] that way amen amen
[48:02] i don't understand it because why it's
[48:03] in the mind of god
[48:05] right right we are all children divine
[48:08] children of god
[48:10] we ordain us to be this way and he said
[48:13] us no
[48:14] and here we are well into your life
[48:17] be grateful that you are here
[48:21] amen lord
[48:25] i might know some people who earned this
[48:27] message believe
[48:29] all these doctrines of belief jesus
[48:31] christ and all those things are saved
[48:33] and yet they're having the roughest time
[48:34] of life is jesus christ enough
[48:37] yes yes hallelujah
[48:41] he is enough hey
[48:45] sometimes we might not ancient sometimes
[48:47] watch some of these christian videos
[48:49] for the children where they go back and
[48:51] examine some of these old-time
[48:53] warriors that lost their wives their
[48:55] husbands and war and this and that
[48:56] and served god to their very last day
[48:59] and it was never encountered that they
[49:00] got down they pressed and pressed and
[49:02] pressed and they were known as them as a
[49:04] woman of god or a man of god yes
[49:06] yes amen suffer tremendously
[49:09] yes but all things work together
[49:13] for good right
[49:16] and that's not just but that is for
[49:18] those who love him do we love jesus
[49:19] christ
[49:22] is he our absolute is he our is our love
[49:26] for jesus christ
[49:27] far exceeds anything else or anyone
[49:30] hallelujah
[49:31] yes you know what my wife i
[49:34] married sister beth here and there's a
[49:37] lot of times i just
[49:39] i go to thailand i call this island he
[49:41] doesn't question i
[49:42] ask her to permission to go or hey
[49:44] should i go then i just go because god
[49:46] told me to go
[49:47] and if we have a bible study i see let's
[49:49] feel like a home we pack up i take a
[49:51] shower sometimes i don't take a shower
[49:53] we go into a bible study go ask your
[49:55] permission no because
[49:56] the door is open glory and she's under
[49:58] that uh understanding i'm under the
[50:00] understanding that the word is first
[50:02] yeah this is not i'm not building a king
[50:04] i have i can't even
[50:05] i can't do anything without jesus christ
[50:07] so what we're doing we're just trying to
[50:09] sow seeds for
[50:10] our lord
[50:23] notice how in john 5 and verse 19 and
[50:25] then
[50:26] answer jesus and the sentence and then
[50:28] bear the grace
[50:29] the son can't do nothing of himself but
[50:31] what he seeth the father do
[50:33] for what things so ever he do it these
[50:35] also do with the son
[50:37] likewise so jesus christ was the he was
[50:40] the he
[50:40] he was a copy or the imitator of god he
[50:43] wanted to be
[50:44] he he was god but he did what the father
[50:47] told him to do what
[50:48] what god the father showed him to do and
[50:50] then he says for the father
[50:51] loveth the son right i taught this a
[50:54] little bit maybe
[50:55] a year ago or whatever but what jesus
[50:58] god almighty the invisible god the
[51:00] person who is god the invisible the
[51:02] almighty one
[51:03] he loveth the son he loves that image he
[51:05] loves the lord he loves
[51:06] everything about it because what it is
[51:08] it is another portion of
[51:10] him amen because in the beginning was
[51:11] the word with god in that word that
[51:13] logos
[51:14] was god right yes the logos that was
[51:18] dancing
[51:18] before god in the beginning of dancing
[51:35] a body i said when that light body
[51:37] received the life it just was with
[51:39] total joy amen that's how we should be
[51:41] as well amen
[51:42] yes sure for the father to love his son
[51:45] and shoot him all things that himself
[51:47] doeth
[51:47] and he that he will shoe them greater
[51:50] works than thee that he
[51:51] may marvel the father loveth the son
[51:55] right amen amen then
[51:58] and i want to show you how much he
[52:00] loveth the sunlight because there was a
[52:01] scriptural tie to this
[52:03] in hebrews i don't know if they may
[52:04] remember this one but in hebrews 1 and
[52:06] verse 7 he says and
[52:07] of the angels this is saint paul now uh
[52:10] the prophet of god the apostle of god
[52:12] now as maybe as the prophet said was the
[52:14] 12th disciple
[52:15] he is now diving into the old testament
[52:17] he says and of the angels he says he
[52:19] make us his angels spirits and his
[52:21] ministers opinion of fire
[52:22] but unto the son he saith now here's god
[52:25] almighty speaking to the son right
[52:27] he's speaking to the logos this was
[52:30] recorded all the way back in in
[52:32] psalms he says thy throne o god so here
[52:35] the almighty father now cause the son
[52:37] god right
[52:39] i'm god and your god what and together
[52:41] they are one
[52:43] right sure he says i throw god is
[52:46] forever and ever a scepter of
[52:47] righteousness
[52:48] in the chapter of thy kingdom thou has
[52:51] loved
[52:51] righteousness and hated iniquity
[52:53] therefore god even thy god has anointed
[52:56] thee
[52:57] with the old with the oil of gladness
[53:00] above thy pillow so here he says he says
[53:02] you're god he says and i'm god
[53:05] absolutely wow but that it's a mystery
[53:07] to most
[53:08] yeah we understand it right and not just
[53:11] an understanding but a revelation
[53:14] [Music]
[53:21] the sun lord or the body lord in the
[53:23] beginning has
[53:24] laid the foundation of the earth and of
[53:26] the heavens are the works of thine hands
[53:28] jesus
[53:29] they shall perish but thou reminisce and
[53:31] they all shall wax old as that the
[53:33] garment
[53:34] as a vessel thou shalt hold them up and
[53:36] they shall be changed jesus but thou
[53:38] art the same what the word cannot change
[53:41] amen jesus christ is the same yesterday
[53:43] today and forever
[53:44] cannot be changed that's one of the
[53:46] things i love brother about brother
[53:47] jesse's testimony
[53:48] my dad would sit in there and teach him
[53:50] about jose canseco
[53:52] brother jasmine jose consignor was
[53:54] drafted by the that was the
[53:56] oakland hayes i believe and he received
[53:57] that number 23 right and
[54:00] just like no no no that was number 30.
[54:05] i tried to see him right there
[54:11] the same and thy years shall not fail
[54:14] amen and that is what
[54:15] he's talking about jesus the son sure
[54:17] yeah but now it fears to go
[54:19] back here to now he pulled here in
[54:20] hebrews 1 8
[54:22] he says the sun he's saying thy throne
[54:24] that that portion of scripture
[54:26] now is shooting all the way back to
[54:28] psalms 45 and verse 1.
[54:30] and this is the beautiful part about
[54:32] this paul saint paul was able by the
[54:35] holy ghost because remember all
[54:36] scripture was given by the inspiration
[54:39] holyos
[54:40] led him in the first chapter he was to
[54:42] tithe
[54:43] and to pull this but he leaves out verse
[54:46] one
[54:48] but if we want to examine where he
[54:49] pulled it from what was before
[54:51] like i said into the chief musician upon
[54:53] uh this man there
[54:55] uh for the sons of mora and michelle
[54:59] the song a song of love
[55:03] the father love it amen
[55:09] the song of love he says now what is the
[55:12] spirit saying through here
[55:14] he says my heart is indicting
[55:17] that's what he's saying he says a good
[55:20] master he says i speak of the things
[55:23] which i have made touching
[55:25] the king of jesus
[55:29] my tongue is the pen of already right
[55:32] right man and who's writing
[55:41] it was god almighty yes but the thing i
[55:44] love
[55:44] is that my heart isn't dying the very
[55:47] heart of god
[55:48] was indicting and that word and dieting
[55:50] means
[55:51] boiling or bubbles up he says it means
[55:54] probably to boil up or over as a
[55:56] fountain and the idea here is that his
[55:59] heart is boiled over the motion of love
[56:01] it was full and overflowing it found
[56:03] expression in the words of his songs and
[56:06] the hebrew word does not
[56:07] occur occurred elsewhere in the bible
[56:11] amen but that kind of i'll say this
[56:13] divine love that the father has for the
[56:15] son
[56:15] is found nowhere else in the bible
[56:17] except right here it is pulled all the
[56:18] way back
[56:20] amen amen
[56:23] yes that's how much god loves the son
[56:27] and as he then went further thou art
[56:29] fairer than the children of man he's
[56:30] talking
[56:31] uh of god almighty grace is poured into
[56:34] thy lips and therefore god has blessed
[56:36] you forever
[56:36] bring up thy sword of fortnite upon thy
[56:39] thigh almost
[56:40] bitey with thy glory with that majesty
[56:43] and it goes on and goes on
[56:44] and then here we catch up in hebrews
[56:45] right here in verse six which is hebrews
[56:47] i believe
[56:48] or whatever the three years he says my
[56:50] throne oh god is forever and ever
[56:52] the scepter of thy kingdom is the
[56:54] righteous scepter thou
[56:56] lovest righteousness and hate his
[56:57] iniquity therefore god thy god has
[56:59] anointed you with the word of glass you
[57:00] know it's exactly going through but
[57:02] notice in verse 8
[57:03] all thy garments smell of myrrh
[57:06] right yes and that is time obviously ty
[57:09] burr was
[57:10] employed in the embalming of dead bodies
[57:12] this is jesus christ
[57:13] amen he is the god of all those things
[57:16] he and the father
[57:17] loveth the son amen now
[57:20] i wanted to start with the father love
[57:23] of the son look how much
[57:24] god loved that image look how much god
[57:26] loves his son jesus christ right yes
[57:30] and what would that make you because if
[57:32] he would send that image or that body
[57:35] down
[57:35] and make a transaction it would have to
[57:38] be
[57:38] an equal transaction if he was the son
[57:41] to purchase his bride it would have to
[57:43] have the same
[57:44] value amount and that's how much god
[57:46] loves
[57:47] you amen
[57:53] had a amen how much that father would
[57:54] love the bride
[57:57] yes yes amen glory absolutely
[58:00] sure absolutely we are joined heirs with
[58:04] jesus christ
[58:05] yes it's promised that we would do the
[58:08] greater and worse
[58:10] than even what we came in the first
[58:11] coming right we are moving into
[58:14] something
[58:14] powerful and by the grace of this grace
[58:16] of god we'll show you
[58:18] how much greater because the because
[58:21] it's a it's a pattern
[58:23] if the pattern hits the same if jesus
[58:25] christ was saying yesterday
[58:26] forever the pattern will hit the same
[58:28] every time right
[58:29] yes uh back to this
[58:32] he says for we know that all things work
[58:35] together for the good
[58:36] to them that love god right
[58:40] now as we're going through life we have
[58:43] many
[58:44] we call maybe sidetracks
[58:50] i didn't get your name you're harry's
[58:51] son isaiah
[58:53] isaiah is coming up to manliness super
[58:56] tall
[58:57] getting super strong probably as smart
[58:59] as dead
[59:00] and you're gonna have to make choices
[59:01] here pretty soon you've got many things
[59:03] up the road here
[59:04] yes you've got big choices to make and
[59:07] you must make the right ones
[59:08] amen and thank god you were brought up
[59:12] in what you brought up i'm praying to
[59:14] god you've seen
[59:15] wisdom in the household you've seen
[59:17] wisdom behind the pulpit
[59:19] you've saw god you've done all the
[59:21] things and for the young here
[59:23] this is where they're at they have to
[59:25] make good decisions
[59:27] me growing up very little leadership or
[59:32] guidance in the home i'll say it like
[59:33] that right
[59:36] wow but god ordained it right and yet we
[59:39] find ourselves here in the word
[59:41] of god
[59:58] and here we are blessed beyond amen
[1:00:07] amen i was just this man here
[1:00:10] at just his old age years ago
[1:00:14] and now i'm worried i'll give you i'm
[1:00:15] gonna give you a testimony how age
[1:00:17] works anybody play basketball here
[1:00:21] my brother jesse was actually was a
[1:00:22] witness this and so is my wife and
[1:00:24] actually all my nephews nieces and bears
[1:00:25] probably
[1:00:26] probably so my niece paige had
[1:00:30] a graduation party we went to it and i
[1:00:34] one of my nephews is six foot three my
[1:00:37] father i thought we always called him mr
[1:00:38] bub
[1:00:39] sam jr six foot three hundred eighty
[1:00:41] pounds
[1:00:43] sixteen years old big boy i wanna as an
[1:00:47] uncle i
[1:00:48] i'm not scared of him i wanna play him
[1:00:50] in basketball she started playing
[1:00:51] basketball
[1:00:52] and um i made it three rounds and i had
[1:00:54] i had to
[1:00:58] so the last drive i had i was driving
[1:01:02] and
[1:01:02] i was going to uh stop
[1:01:06] and then kind of i don't know you play
[1:01:08] basketball you're driving to the basket
[1:01:09] but i was not going to go to the layout
[1:01:10] because you're six foot three so i'm
[1:01:12] gonna actually stop and kick back and
[1:01:13] do one of those things like style or
[1:01:16] whatever
[1:01:17] and i was driving i was driving
[1:01:21] 43 years old and i could not stop i just
[1:01:24] continue just ran out of bounds i just
[1:01:26] ran
[1:01:27] just kept running i could not stop and
[1:01:30] shoot i just
[1:01:31] wait my legs could not stop
[1:01:35] when i was your age i could do those
[1:01:37] things but now i'm finding
[1:01:39] wow these are looking rough
[1:01:43] we're getting we're getting older our
[1:01:45] generation we're getting older
[1:01:47] yeah now we've really got to get the
[1:01:49] best of the best
[1:01:50] and we've been doing it for years but
[1:01:52] we've got to get more and more in tune
[1:01:54] with
[1:01:54] the spirit amen and as we see our flesh
[1:01:57] we're losing less of this less strength
[1:02:00] less control of this
[1:02:01] we're now depending more on the holy
[1:02:04] ghost to control our actions control our
[1:02:06] thoughts control our words
[1:02:07] and those sort of things so we want to
[1:02:09] remember all things are going to work
[1:02:11] out
[1:02:12] just because i cannot drive the hoop
[1:02:15] stop and make a basket does not mean
[1:02:18] my days are over it just shows me i need
[1:02:21] to start
[1:02:22] studying more and praying more
[1:02:26] because that's what i'm going to be
[1:02:27] depending on because my flesh will be
[1:02:29] nothing i'll be able to do in the flesh
[1:02:31] right right not by might not my power
[1:02:33] but by my spirit
[1:02:39] amen we must have the holy ghost move
[1:02:41] through now
[1:02:43] if we know that all things work together
[1:02:46] for those that love
[1:02:47] god right how many have made a mistake
[1:02:49] in their lives
[1:02:53] i could hold up my toes and fingers and
[1:02:56] my feet and all that i would i would
[1:02:58] then add some more and
[1:03:00] have thousands and thousands and
[1:03:02] thousands of mistakes
[1:03:03] yes sir in my life but god loves us
[1:03:07] right
[1:03:08] and what's he going to do he says and
[1:03:10] here in hebrews 12 5
[1:03:11] and you have forgotten the exhortation
[1:03:13] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[1:03:16] my son despised thou
[1:03:17] not the chastities of the lord how many
[1:03:19] have gotten spanked
[1:03:21] by god absolutely two years ago
[1:03:25] i was i hit probably two and a half
[1:03:27] years ago hit 40 and i was getting that
[1:03:32] and uh i started lifting weights and
[1:03:34] exercising
[1:03:35] and i'll say like this you know if you
[1:03:37] are a seed of god
[1:03:39] and god has got you a certain way there
[1:03:41] are some things
[1:03:43] if you are are built a certain way i'll
[1:03:46] say this
[1:03:47] i'm not just saying me but anyone's
[1:03:49] built a seed of god and they have the
[1:03:51] holy ghost you're not going to be able
[1:03:53] to get away with what others do
[1:03:55] that's right there are many you'll see
[1:03:56] you may see many people in this message
[1:03:58] get away with things
[1:03:59] and you try it and you get spanked right
[1:04:01] away that's right
[1:04:03] yes sir absolutely
[1:04:07] and that is his divine love towards you
[1:04:23] and when i did that i had
[1:04:38] because it puts brother against brother
[1:04:40] right and then
[1:04:41] emotions get involved then heart and
[1:04:43] feelings and those sort of things
[1:04:45] and god will spend you every time that's
[1:04:47] right
[1:04:48] i'm witness right that's one of my
[1:04:51] mistakes
[1:04:51] one my son despise not of chastening of
[1:04:54] the lord when
[1:04:55] when nor faint when thou rebuked him for
[1:04:57] whomsoever the lord loveth he
[1:04:58] chastened right yes we better thank god
[1:05:01] for our spiritual spankings whether they
[1:05:03] come in the spirit realm or natural
[1:05:05] realm
[1:05:06] he says if you can take it and say
[1:05:09] yes lord thank you so much for spanking
[1:05:11] me thank you so much for getting me
[1:05:13] back on the straight arrow for
[1:05:14] correcting me and keeping me exactly
[1:05:17] where you want me
[1:05:31] right yes i've been very careful
[1:05:35] on things like that
[1:05:38] yes first corinthians 11 31 if we would
[1:05:41] judge ourselves we should not be
[1:05:44] joined right there's a decision i'm
[1:05:47] making next week i have to do this and
[1:05:48] that
[1:05:49] is the correct decision uh the the
[1:05:51] leading of the lord on this certain
[1:05:52] situation is
[1:05:53] the circumstance coming up in my life is
[1:05:55] this though is this
[1:05:56] well the thing i want to do is that the
[1:05:58] correct will
[1:06:00] we have to we have to now we have to
[1:06:01] pray through and find out these as these
[1:06:03] fleeting moments
[1:06:04] as god has as this time the scenes of
[1:06:07] time or the same
[1:06:08] time are now winding down we're about to
[1:06:11] make our last
[1:06:12] final decisions here yes we must make
[1:06:15] sure these are correct because
[1:06:17] when do we make our worst decisions
[1:06:18] under pressure
[1:06:20] or when we're tired right that's when we
[1:06:23] make our worst decisions
[1:06:25] right and what does the prophet say he
[1:06:26] says there's a temptation coming
[1:06:28] there is a pressure coming yes there
[1:06:32] is a decision coming to all
[1:06:35] the world rich and poor small and big
[1:06:37] and
[1:06:39] free and bond and all those things
[1:06:40] everyone is coming now to a great
[1:06:42] decision
[1:06:43] yes we must and we believe we have
[1:06:45] already made that decision
[1:06:47] yeah but we have to mention again
[1:06:50] because there's something
[1:06:52] coming yes and this thing is going to
[1:06:54] look so
[1:06:55] good as the prophet said there's going
[1:06:56] to be an invitation it's going to look
[1:06:58] like
[1:06:59] that that at this point of moment what
[1:07:00] we're going to about to see it's going
[1:07:02] to look like that's going to break into
[1:07:04] a golden age
[1:07:06] like no other all right
[1:07:10] well brother i know what the prophet
[1:07:11] said but look what look what they're
[1:07:13] doing out here in the world
[1:07:14] look what they're doing in politics
[1:07:16] everything's being fixed and
[1:07:17] orchestrated just
[1:07:19] i mean what if they come out with the
[1:07:21] highways that the the bubble cars can
[1:07:23] drive through and we don't have to drive
[1:07:25] what if we have what if they promise all
[1:07:26] the technology and free energy and all
[1:07:29] those things
[1:07:29] what if it becomes a man this looks like
[1:07:32] perfect
[1:07:34] when we sell out knowing that just
[1:07:37] moments after peace and safety is
[1:07:38] uttered
[1:07:39] destruction all right
[1:07:43] amen he says but when we are judged we
[1:07:46] are
[1:07:46] chastened of the lord that we should not
[1:07:48] be condemned with the world amen
[1:07:50] amen lord thank us all amen
[1:07:54] and of course in our days as many as i
[1:07:56] love as he loves
[1:07:58] christ i rebuke and chase and be zealous
[1:08:01] therefore
[1:08:01] and repent amen
[1:08:05] how do you become his love because
[1:08:06] remember if god loved the son
[1:08:08] and the spirit of the sun was in you god
[1:08:11] will love
[1:08:12] you
[1:08:15] lord amen let's continue on here
[1:08:19] and i want to kind of work with this
[1:08:21] just for a season here and
[1:08:23] we're 30 minutes in i hope you're doing
[1:08:25] okay
[1:08:27] i know i'm not captain uh
[1:08:31] or anything like that i'm just just
[1:08:33] meeting this little teacher here just
[1:08:34] trying to
[1:08:35] convey a thought by the grace of god and
[1:08:36] i think this is going to be a good
[1:08:38] nugget here we're going to break open
[1:08:39] just to show you about a beautiful your
[1:08:42] life
[1:08:43] amen despite all
[1:08:47] all mistakes god is going to think
[1:08:52] amen every one of you is going to be a
[1:08:56] masterpiece in the hand of god if you
[1:08:58] will just submit
[1:09:00] and let him use it yes
[1:09:03] for his glory
[1:09:07] you're gonna you'll see how beautiful
[1:09:08] this is hallelujah and some of you may
[1:09:10] have
[1:09:11] heard this or maybe even thought of it
[1:09:12] or whatever but to me this was a
[1:09:14] nugget i've never heard before just a
[1:09:16] beautiful thing
[1:09:17] inside the samuel 12 9 now we're dealing
[1:09:20] with
[1:09:21] david and beshebi here and just kind of
[1:09:25] a rough situation in verse 9 wherefore
[1:09:28] has to
[1:09:29] despise the commandment of the lord to
[1:09:31] do evil in his sight right so god hears
[1:09:33] out bringing
[1:09:34] judgment upon the king he says thou hast
[1:09:36] killed your eyes a hittite with the
[1:09:38] sword has taken his wife to be thy wife
[1:09:40] and has slain him with the sword of the
[1:09:41] children of am not among right
[1:09:44] now therefore the sword shall never
[1:09:46] depart from thine house
[1:09:49] one mistake and he reaped it the rest of
[1:09:51] his life that's right
[1:09:53] sometimes that's it that's why if you
[1:09:55] mess up
[1:09:56] one time it is going to affect the rest
[1:09:59] of your
[1:10:00] life right yes sir
[1:10:04] big decisions which are always what
[1:10:07] usually aimed at going against the word
[1:10:08] of god
[1:10:09] that's right if we do to make the
[1:10:11] correct decision of going in the word of
[1:10:13] god
[1:10:13] we will be in the clear amen there will
[1:10:16] be no story against your house there
[1:10:17] will be no judgment this illusion
[1:10:19] if we stay in the word of god right
[1:10:22] now jesus because thou has despised me
[1:10:26] and has taken the wife to be uh to be
[1:10:29] thy
[1:10:29] why now notice he said how be it because
[1:10:33] by this deed thou has given great
[1:10:35] occasion
[1:10:36] to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme
[1:10:40] see our little mistakes make god look
[1:10:46] those little mistakes that we make that
[1:10:48] the world sees make us look like a joke
[1:10:50] yes sir and it brings reproach against
[1:10:53] us
[1:10:54] and our lord and savior our little
[1:10:56] mistakes oral
[1:10:58] big mistakes right
[1:11:02] sure yes
[1:11:06] shall the throne of iniquity have
[1:11:07] fellowship with thee which framed
[1:11:09] mischief by our law in other words
[1:11:12] he said he said if they see something
[1:11:15] you've done
[1:11:16] wrong and they take the word of god
[1:11:18] which is the law of god
[1:11:20] and they they they bring in such a way
[1:11:22] that you look guilty
[1:11:29] they still don't want them to do it
[1:11:32] right and yet they'll take the word of
[1:11:33] god
[1:11:34] and pin you to the wall and say you
[1:11:35] messed up here you messed up there you
[1:11:37] messed up there
[1:11:38] right they gather themselves together
[1:11:40] against the souls of the righteous
[1:11:42] and condemn the innocent blood why are
[1:11:46] they innocent because they have the
[1:11:47] baptism
[1:11:48] of the holy spirit all right
[1:11:51] despite all your faults and failures god
[1:11:53] sees you
[1:11:54] as spotless as pure amen as innocent
[1:11:57] otherwise he would not have a bride of
[1:11:59] this day otherwise he would not
[1:12:01] come and get you but because you have
[1:12:02] the baptism of the holy ghost that makes
[1:12:04] you
[1:12:04] wide as the white is still amen amen
[1:12:11] [Applause]
[1:12:18] i'm not that good i can't even think
[1:12:21] like i'm a good christian i just have to
[1:12:22] be
[1:12:23] myself and be yourselves
[1:12:26] you live according to how the holy ghost
[1:12:29] gives you strength the bible says
[1:12:31] uh every man is given a measure of faith
[1:12:33] that's right
[1:12:34] however you live and don't compare
[1:12:36] yourself well i'm not scared of corona
[1:12:38] well they might be
[1:12:39] that's right well i can't judge that man
[1:12:41] because he's scared even though he's in
[1:12:43] the message
[1:12:43] of the holy ghost because what he was
[1:12:45] only given that measure of faith
[1:12:48] everyone was given a different amount
[1:12:50] yes yes more strengths different
[1:12:52] weaknesses
[1:12:52] yes sir amen we must have everything
[1:12:54] covered by the blood
[1:12:55] amen amen yes
[1:12:59] now now notice here the jews were over
[1:13:02] charging their brother uh as they would
[1:13:05] be
[1:13:06] sold and lose their lands lose their
[1:13:09] properties and all those things and
[1:13:10] tough times and hard times and the
[1:13:12] richer brother would buy them out and
[1:13:14] and but notice they were actually
[1:13:16] charging them look at verse
[1:13:18] 6 nehemiah he says i was very angry when
[1:13:21] i heard their cry in these words
[1:13:23] then i consulted with myself and i
[1:13:25] rebuked the nobles and the rulers and
[1:13:28] sentenced them
[1:13:28] the exact ushering or interest every one
[1:13:32] of his brother
[1:13:33] and i set a great assembly against him
[1:13:36] he says what are you doing to your
[1:13:38] brothers charging
[1:13:40] interest giving them loans and now
[1:13:41] you're trying to make money off your own
[1:13:43] flesh and blood
[1:13:45] sell them out they keeping them poorer
[1:13:48] than they should be
[1:13:49] and what that was a commandment of the
[1:13:51] lord not to do those sort of things and
[1:13:52] god comes and uses the man of god
[1:13:54] and condemns him for it yes he says not
[1:13:57] only have you broken the word but look
[1:13:59] what it says in verse nine he says
[1:14:00] also i said it is not good that you do
[1:14:03] it oh you're not to walk in the fear of
[1:14:05] our god because of the reproach of the
[1:14:07] heathen are
[1:14:07] enemies it makes us
[1:14:11] look bad when we do each other wrong
[1:14:13] that's right
[1:14:18] what does john 13 say a new commandment
[1:14:21] i give unto you that you love
[1:14:23] one another yes as i have loved you that
[1:14:27] ye
[1:14:27] also love one another by this shall all
[1:14:31] men know that you are my disciples
[1:14:33] if you have one if you have loved one to
[1:14:36] another
[1:14:36] amen the bible says what he says they'll
[1:14:39] know us by our
[1:14:40] love
[1:14:46] [Applause]
[1:14:54] that's right amen well the lord never
[1:14:56] told me to give
[1:14:57] he doesn't if you see a name take care
[1:15:00] of it amen
[1:15:01] it's the body it's a body work if i have
[1:15:04] something here or wrong on my

[1:15:07] or this this but i try to take care of
[1:15:09] that arm because i'm going to need that
[1:15:11] arm absolutely
[1:15:11] that arm is part of me sure yes and
[1:15:15] we're afraid of the body of christ we
[1:15:16] should help one another love one another
[1:15:18] do what we can for one another

[1:15:31] restaurant

[1:18:46] formed against these shells prosper
[1:18:49] never said they wouldn't prosper a
[1:18:50] little bit but it shall prosper in the
[1:18:51] end it ain't gonna happen again
[1:18:53] and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:18:55] the judgment thou
[1:18:56] shalt condemn amen
[1:19:00] well you mean well because i made this
[1:19:02] mistake i made a certain mistake here
[1:19:03] listen
[1:19:04] and someone may rise up with the great
[1:19:05] judgment throne and have the same
[1:19:07] mistake and say god why would you
[1:19:08] let them get away with it not me and i
[1:19:10] would have to say
[1:19:12] i repented of my sins
[1:19:16] amen and i pleaded the blood of jesus
[1:19:18] christ
[1:19:19] and i got baptized in the name of jesus
[1:19:21] christ amen and he was
[1:19:23] i received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:19:24] and the bible says if that seed remains
[1:19:27] in you you are sinless amen
[1:19:29] and that's all we can say is that what
[1:19:30] by his praise but what he did
[1:19:32] we are clean and free absolutely but
[1:19:36] it's going to come to play here very
[1:19:38] shortly
[1:19:39] we're going to need all that testimony
[1:19:41] the blood of jesus christ
[1:19:43] we're going to need it all and that
[1:19:44] fiery baptism the holy ghost we're going
[1:19:46] to need it all
[1:19:47] amen because people that me and you and
[1:19:50] i know
[1:19:51] that we have this we have to say it
[1:19:52] because we're we don't want to sugarcoat
[1:19:54] anything there will be people we know
[1:19:56] that we're not going to make it
[1:19:59] i'm not talking rapture i'm talking
[1:20:01] heaven in general
[1:20:04] they know our worst they might know our
[1:20:07] best
[1:20:07] and they will rise up and condemn us
[1:20:11] well he never taught me a bible study
[1:20:13] and he never listened to this
[1:20:14] and i'll say it is the grace of god
[1:20:19] why do you think after this every tongue
[1:20:21] that survives
[1:20:22] in the judgment thou shall condemn why
[1:20:24] do you think the bible has
[1:20:25] the bible says he's gonna have to wipe
[1:20:26] our tears away again yes you know he
[1:20:28] might turn tears away twice in this
[1:20:30] relationship
[1:20:40] yes by the leadership
[1:20:46] he says for the lord god will help me
[1:20:47] therefore shall i not be compounded
[1:20:50] therefore i've set my face like a flint
[1:20:52] and i know that i shall not be ashamed
[1:20:54] he is he is near that justifies
[1:20:58] me if you have the holy ghost in you and
[1:21:01] god is now dwelling with you and with
[1:21:04] you
[1:21:04] even though someone might point out your
[1:21:06] faultlessness i could say well i am
[1:21:07] still
[1:21:08] justified because he's with me right
[1:21:11] who will contend with me let us stand
[1:21:13] together who is my adversary let us come
[1:21:15] here to me what because we have the
[1:21:16] presence of god almighty
[1:21:18] amen dwelling in the shadows by the
[1:21:22] grace of god hallelujah
[1:21:24] and what will that listen let's say i do
[1:21:26] make a mistake what will i say
[1:21:28] say sir i made a mistake i'm very
[1:21:31] very sorry if you apologize yes
[1:21:34] yes he's a witness that i have made
[1:21:37] everything right now with something him
[1:21:39] now
[1:21:39] everything will he forgive me all right
[1:21:42] believe me okay with me will he treat me
[1:21:44] the exact same before i made it as he
[1:21:45] did before i made that mistake that's
[1:21:47] right
[1:21:47] now it's up to him now it's his fault
[1:21:49] but we have done the procedure
[1:21:51] that god gave us to make things right
[1:21:53] yes amen
[1:21:54] you go
[1:21:59] yes amen he says behold the lord god
[1:22:02] will help me
[1:22:03] who is he that would shall condemn me
[1:22:05] and lo they shall all wax all of the
[1:22:07] garments eat them up
[1:22:11] and this scripture right here is all in
[1:22:14] all
[1:22:16] we love him because he first
[1:22:19] love us yes hallelujah
[1:22:34] because he chose you to
[1:22:40] [Applause]
[1:22:50] oh
[1:22:53] [Music]
[1:23:02] [Applause]
[1:23:04] oh
[1:23:09] i said lord i said lord you know once i
[1:23:12] get that body i'll never do anything
[1:23:19] to live in again presence of god because
[1:23:20] once you get there you say there's
[1:23:22] nothing
[1:23:22] like it nothing can compare with the
[1:23:25] love of god
[1:23:26] yes hallelujah let's put all that little
[1:23:29] foundation here for this okay
[1:23:32] we're at 43 so give about 15 more
[1:23:34] minutes all right
[1:23:35] okay i hope this new proportion will be
[1:23:37] a blessing
[1:23:39] because this to me when i seen this it
[1:23:41] just
[1:23:42] this proves that every mistake
[1:23:45] we've made well i'm have big mistakes
[1:23:48] well even though those little mistakes
[1:23:50] that it still haunts you because some
[1:23:52] people have lived pretty good lives
[1:23:53] they made little mistakes and you know
[1:23:55] what what they talk about those little
[1:23:56] mistakes
[1:23:58] that little things that their little fox
[1:23:59] will spoil that vine if
[1:24:13] like big things i've missed cool
[1:24:17] sure i didn't
[1:24:20] go up in the message or know the truth
[1:24:22] or anything but you know what god
[1:24:23] ordained him
[1:24:24] right god ordained it
[1:24:29] that was god's plan for us yes
[1:24:32] even your current position in life right
[1:24:34] now is god's plan
[1:24:36] it was in the mind of god well brother i
[1:24:38] should have been here if i made this
[1:24:39] it was in the mind of god yes he knew
[1:24:56] and the lord said nathanael unto david
[1:24:58] and he came unto him
[1:24:59] and said to him there were two men in
[1:25:01] one city one rich and the other
[1:25:03] four the rich man had exceeded the many
[1:25:05] flocks and herds
[1:25:06] and the poor men had nothing saved one
[1:25:08] little you lamb and he had brought it up
[1:25:10] and nursed it and grew together with him
[1:25:12] and with his children and then they eat
[1:25:13] of his own media directly with the cup
[1:25:15] and lay in his wisdom as until his
[1:25:16] daughter
[1:25:17] and there came a traveler
[1:25:21] this is parable form remember every
[1:25:23] parable that god would bring has an
[1:25:24] interpretation
[1:25:27] yes
[1:25:30] mistake number one david sugar went to
[1:25:32] war
[1:25:34] from the time when kings went to war
[1:25:36] amen amen
[1:25:40] and now he's relaxing at home taking a
[1:25:42] little
[1:25:43] fiesta a break and now he's
[1:25:47] just living his life and those sort of
[1:25:49] things and one night he goes up there to
[1:25:51] the old balcony of the seal
[1:25:53] the roof of his house because it was
[1:25:54] flat back in those days he could walk on
[1:25:55] it
[1:25:56] enjoy the scenery and these things and
[1:25:58] he sees a woman
[1:26:00] and you know the story but according to
[1:26:03] the parable says and there came a
[1:26:05] traveler right that's interesting
[1:26:08] unto the rich man and he's fair to take
[1:26:10] of his own flock
[1:26:12] and it was on her to dress for the
[1:26:14] wayfaring man who is this man
[1:26:18] who's the man job
[1:26:49] looking for someone to wake he's looking
[1:26:50] for someone you can take down all right
[1:26:52] right the same in joke two he says
[1:26:56] and the lord said what's coming from uh
[1:26:59] from going to and fro
[1:27:00] walking up and down it right we know in
[1:27:03] matthew 12
[1:27:04] 43 when the unclean spirit goes out of a
[1:27:07] man he walketh through privacy
[1:27:22] that's right brother good
[1:27:25] hope for yourselves and therefore under
[1:27:27] the hand of
[1:27:28] god the mighty hand of god may exalt you
[1:27:31] into time
[1:27:32] passing while you're carrying upon him
[1:27:33] before he cares for you be sober
[1:27:35] rebellious vigilance he says because
[1:27:37] your adversary the devil as the lord
[1:27:39] right lion walk is about seeking who he
[1:27:42] may devour yeah
[1:27:43] very good why was that parable like that
[1:27:47] from nathan
[1:27:48] to david because here's what took place
[1:27:52] you know these things
[1:27:56] the beautiful thing is my pastor has
[1:27:57] been working with demonology
[1:28:01] and in the book of job god had to give
[1:28:05] divine
[1:28:06] permission that's right
[1:28:10] to come down and mess with job
[1:28:13] that's right satan has to ask permission
[1:28:18] that's right amen
[1:28:21] not only he has to ask for god right
[1:28:29] so indirectly it was sent from god a
[1:28:32] test
[1:28:32] or a trial dave is on his throne
[1:28:37] sees this woman and satan himself shows
[1:28:41] up
[1:28:43] by permission of god
[1:28:47] by permission of god
[1:28:51] the man who had a heart like god's own
[1:28:54] heart
[1:29:08] pretty nice guy solid rock solid
[1:29:12] do you mind if i go and talk to him a
[1:29:14] little bit
[1:29:16] satan knowing he's out of the will of
[1:29:18] god god knowing he's not the will of god
[1:29:20] god knowing what satan's thinking says
[1:29:31] finds david in the moonlight looking
[1:29:36] hey
[1:29:38] what do you think about that they was
[1:29:40] like
[1:29:42] such a good idea a really good idea
[1:29:47] and it was ordained by god
[1:29:52] that move was ordained
[1:29:55] oh my god all right
[1:30:00] what we saw there was the total hand
[1:30:03] of god
[1:30:06] i think about spiritual let me say this
[1:30:09] my pastor brought this out
[1:30:11] if satan hasn't asked permission to deal
[1:30:13] with you
[1:30:15] did you know the devils have to ask
[1:30:16] permission look at this
[1:30:18] remember jesus goes over side of the sea
[1:30:20] there and he finds the man in the tombs
[1:30:22] and gathering right
[1:30:26] they cried a lot of voices what have i
[1:30:28] to do with thee jesus the son of the
[1:30:30] most high god i
[1:30:31] journey by god thou torment me not for
[1:30:34] he said to him come out of the man that
[1:30:35] unclean spirit and he asked
[1:30:37] and he asked them what is thy name and
[1:30:39] the answer and said my name is legion
[1:30:40] for we
[1:30:41] are many and if he saw him how much he
[1:30:44] would not send them away out of the
[1:30:45] country
[1:30:47] look every move a demon makes for satan
[1:30:50] makes has to be permission
[1:30:52] ah good an edict in heaven says
[1:30:57] he is allowed to go this afar this away
[1:31:00] not this way that way but it must be
[1:31:02] certain this way and it has to be only
[1:31:04] with this so many things
[1:31:06] it has to be in a certain way good good
[1:31:10] that is
[1:31:16] and now there was there was night unto
[1:31:18] the mountain the great herd
[1:31:19] of swine feeding and all the devils but
[1:31:22] salt and saying send us
[1:31:23] into the swine that we may enter unto
[1:31:25] them demons have to ask permission to
[1:31:28] enter
[1:31:33] i mean they just don't have free reign
[1:31:35] down here and do whatever they want
[1:31:39] everything is permission
[1:31:42] job one day uh uh satan comes up to job
[1:31:45] and god's like
[1:31:46] remember how he's the prophet dramatizes
[1:31:48] picking a fight and look at me the
[1:31:50] perfect man

[1:31:57] i hate perfection you know
[1:32:01] that whole thing was ordained of god
[1:32:03] that's right let's bring it back
[1:32:05] satan comes up to god one day and god's
[1:32:08] like
[1:32:09] have you seen my son and daughter
[1:32:25] my children look at look at the guy i
[1:32:27] went down and playing in a garden
[1:32:28] isn't that beautiful satan for the first
[1:32:31] couple days is watching
[1:32:32] learning things looking just looking at
[1:32:34] the serpent looking at the animals look
[1:32:35] at how things work and reproduction
[1:32:36] those sort of things

[1:33:16] be able to speak to her can i hear the
[1:33:17] serpent
[1:33:18] say you know what he's thinking god

[1:33:34] yes everything is planned
[1:33:37] there's not one thing out of caterpillar
[1:33:40] in your life in my life everything
[1:33:44] is for you i can't overexpress it
[1:33:48] after you realize that satan has
[1:33:50] permission this whole corona thing
[1:33:52] and the people who are working this
[1:33:54] thing
[1:33:56] these people are demons and even
[1:33:57] possessed even control
[1:33:59] so those demons had to get permission to
[1:34:00] do this
[1:34:03] world war one world war two was all
[1:34:05] permission
[1:34:06] from god
[1:34:09] believe it or not
[1:34:13] four minutes now now if we can go back
[1:34:16] to bathsheba and david
[1:34:18] and think with their spiritual thinking
[1:34:20] clamps
[1:34:22] because there was a there was a there
[1:34:24] was something going on here
[1:34:26] there was something going on as we see
[1:34:29] bathsheba on the roof here and it came
[1:34:30] to pass in the evening time
[1:34:32] then david arose from off his bed and
[1:34:35] walked up
[1:34:35] upon the walk upon the roof of the
[1:34:37] king's house and from the roof he saw a
[1:34:39] woman
[1:34:39] washing herself now carnal you think
[1:34:43] yeah sure
[1:34:44] but now think spiritual
[1:34:48] if david was a type of christ
[1:34:51] he saw this woman washing herself and he
[1:34:54] found it
[1:34:54] extremely attractive
[1:34:58] and the bible says in ephesians 5 verse
[1:35:00] 25 husbands love your wives jesus christ
[1:35:02] also of the church and gave them so
[1:35:04] forth
[1:35:04] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:35:07] with the washing of the water by the
[1:35:08] word
[1:35:10] so david was attracted to a woman
[1:35:12] cleaning herself
[1:35:14] and keeping herself clean how much more
[1:35:16] will god almighty
[1:35:17] be attracted or be i think this be yeah
[1:35:20] be
[1:35:21] moved towards you as you wash yourself
[1:35:24] with the water of the lord
[1:35:27] listening keeping yourself keeping
[1:35:29] yourself clean
[1:35:30] amen through what the power of the holy
[1:35:33] ghost
[1:35:35] keeping yourself clean
[1:35:38] he says awake awake put on thy strength
[1:35:40] of zion put on thy beautiful garments so
[1:35:42] jerusalem
[1:35:43] uh the holy city foreign so no more come
[1:35:46] unto thee the uncircumcised and the
[1:35:48] unclean
[1:35:48] what she will be clean
[1:35:53] shake off the dust hebrews 10 22 he says
[1:35:56] let us draw near with
[1:35:58] having a high priest over the house of
[1:35:59] god notice the high priest is there
[1:36:01] let us draw near with a with a true
[1:36:03] heart and full assurance of faith having
[1:36:05] our bodies
[1:36:06] i'm sorry our hearts sprinkled from an
[1:36:08] evil conscience
[1:36:09] and our bodies washed with pure lot
[1:36:14] if david thought that was attractive
[1:36:17] then god will find it attractive as well
[1:36:19] spiritually
[1:36:20] someone that's bathing yourself in the
[1:36:22] word of god constantly
[1:36:24] sure why is that because in revelations
[1:36:26] 19 and 7
[1:36:28] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:36:29] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:36:30] lamb has come and his
[1:36:32] wife has made herself ready she is
[1:36:35] not unclean but now remember when when
[1:36:38] is the time the
[1:36:39] at midnight there's a crying come on to
[1:36:41] them right the lord is coming
[1:36:43] what is this all the white and foolish
[1:36:45] or trim their lamps they cleaned up
[1:36:47] right sure yes
[1:36:51] now why is that david and bathsheba so
[1:36:54] powerful
[1:36:56] if you look at joseph's line here in
[1:36:58] matthew 1 and verse 1
[1:37:00] the book of the generations of jesus
[1:37:02] christ
[1:37:03] this is his pure seedling
[1:37:06] these were sons of god hallelujah
[1:37:09] yes but notice the corruption what would
[1:37:12] look what would look like corruption
[1:37:14] in the scene line there's tamar
[1:37:18] lead the hardest yes there's
[1:37:21] a rahab who was a harmony right
[1:37:24] there was ruth who was a gentile
[1:37:27] right and no inheritance had nothing
[1:37:29] going for
[1:37:30] outside of what she believed what these
[1:37:33] all came into subjection to the word of
[1:37:34] god hallelujah
[1:37:36] and then we have this
[1:37:39] salmon began great temple
[1:37:43] greyhound and go on to get over that of
[1:37:45] ruth don't let me get jessie and just be
[1:37:47] at
[1:37:47] king david david the king
[1:37:51] and david begat solomon of her
[1:37:54] that had been wife of your eyes
[1:38:00] this was the seed lion of jesus christ
[1:38:02] right
[1:38:04] i'm sorry i knew that you too now
[1:38:09] he says but uh but you know i'm glad
[1:38:12] that even just a little insignificant
[1:38:13] thing in the bible means so much
[1:38:15] i believe that it was jesus that said
[1:38:17] this and that you pass over and do the
[1:38:19] way in your management law but rather
[1:38:20] pass over the little things
[1:38:22] and sometimes the little things that
[1:38:24] hold the big things together
[1:38:25] right but in all in all the great cause
[1:38:28] is turning just exactly the way
[1:38:30] god ordained them to call turn here
[1:38:33] there'll never be one visit
[1:38:34] place god hath ordained all things that
[1:38:37] must hit just
[1:38:38] exactly through that place amen amen
[1:38:41] you mean rosa you me
[1:38:45] kmart was ordained of god that's that
[1:38:48] act was ordained of god
[1:38:49] yes absolutely this
[1:38:53] rahab the harlot the scarlet threat
[1:38:56] hanging our window that was ordained of
[1:38:58] god absolutely
[1:38:59] yeah look how god used it why god was
[1:39:02] not looking at the flesh he was looking
[1:39:03] that she believed that this was god
[1:39:05] almighty
[1:39:06] amen believe in the god of the jews
[1:39:09] absolutely
[1:39:09] she would live in jehovah hallelujah
[1:39:12] sure ruth also believed and said he said
[1:39:16] uh uh
[1:39:16] uh naomi diana your god will be
[1:39:20] my god right sold out to the word of god
[1:39:23] amen
[1:39:24] god remember how jesus just met you just
[1:39:26] marveled at the faith of the gentile
[1:39:28] woman right
[1:39:29] yeah the gentiles sure but now look at
[1:39:32] this
[1:39:34] and this was joseph's law scene line
[1:39:37] matthew 1
[1:39:38] jacob again joseph the husband of mary
[1:39:40] who was of whom was born jesus
[1:39:42] is called christ right so now that's
[1:39:44] joseph's line matthew 1
[1:39:46] yes here the gene algae
[1:39:49] let me tell you now this is mary's
[1:39:50] genealogy
[1:39:52] and jesus himself began to be about 30
[1:39:55] years of age being as supposed to the
[1:39:57] son of joseph or
[1:39:59] mary joseph uh joseph mary's wife
[1:40:02] who's the son of a lion goes on and on
[1:40:04] and then now look at luke
[1:40:06] 3 and which was the son of mela
[1:40:09] which was the son of mainan which is
[1:40:10] sort of
[1:40:13] the son of nathan which was the son of
[1:40:14] david yes
[1:40:16] right yes and what's so significant
[1:40:18] about these two genealogies
[1:40:20] and we see solomon come out right yes
[1:40:24] both seedlings both
[1:40:28] genealogies stem from david beyond
[1:40:31] it's david
[1:40:34] and they all traced back to david yes
[1:40:38] but both nathan and solomon were
[1:40:41] bathsheba's
[1:40:42] sons that's right
[1:40:46] both mary and joseph came from
[1:40:56] who else could solomon came from
[1:41:01] it had to come from those two yes sir
[1:41:03] yes sir
[1:41:04] god god allowed satan to come down to
[1:41:06] david at the right time
[1:41:07] exact time is when they were taking
[1:41:09] baths absolutely
[1:41:11] ordained now remember in the old
[1:41:14] testament
[1:41:15] many of the names
[1:41:20] god allowed jacob to be called jacob a
[1:41:22] deceiver a subplanter
[1:41:25] because he had to have that sort of life
[1:41:27] until he had a name
[1:41:28] right abram had to have began named
[1:41:31] abram
[1:41:32] until the time when god would change his
[1:41:33] name to abraham
[1:41:35] right those names the name of the well
[1:41:38] the name of every
[1:41:39] look at look at the first ten names in
[1:41:41] genesis
[1:41:43] adam seth those those ten names tell a
[1:41:45] story of what christ is all christ
[1:41:47] right you ever see that
[1:41:50] it means something so when i saw this
[1:41:53] and i see notice how
[1:41:55] out of bathsheba came the two sea lions
[1:41:57] that came joseph and mary
[1:41:58] yeah one woman and solomon i'm sorry and
[1:42:01] david
[1:42:04] what was so powerful about that
[1:42:08] you know what the name of bathsheba
[1:42:09] means
[1:42:11] for one hour
[1:42:15] bathsheba means the daughter
[1:42:19] of an oath right
[1:42:22] a daughter of an oath that's broke up in
[1:42:24] the two parts man
[1:42:27] that word bath means to be the apple of
[1:42:31] the eye or the branch
[1:42:37] now you're not gonna believe this
[1:42:49] the end part of bathsheba means to be
[1:42:52] complete
[1:42:53] or to seven oneself the daughter of an
[1:42:56] oath
[1:42:56] a sevenfold oath that is swear by
[1:43:01] repeating a declaration seven times
[1:43:07] and then seeing how it began with the
[1:43:09] church of ephesus and the second church
[1:43:11] age the third treasure for church age
[1:43:12] fifth church fifteen years of darkness
[1:43:14] to the the lutheran age the
[1:43:16] philadelphians down to later seeing the
[1:43:17] last age
[1:43:18] he says seeing the old testament how
[1:43:20] they briefly typed the beginning
[1:43:22] in solomon
[1:43:25] whether the first church age of the
[1:43:27] first age of the old testament church
[1:43:29] they start with
[1:43:30] solomon which was a direct descendant of
[1:43:33] extreme
[1:43:36] amen
[1:43:38] she was the daughter of a sevenfold oath
[1:43:41] and i'm gonna bring israel through seven
[1:43:43] churches
[1:43:45] and it had to start with david
[1:43:48] and besheba now remember if it started
[1:43:50] with an evil act at the end of the
[1:43:52] church ages i would have to look like
[1:43:54] anyone
[1:43:56] yes the holy ghost beat david to his
[1:43:59] wife
[1:43:59] i'm sorry joseph to his wife and it
[1:44:01] looked like a fornication to take place
[1:44:03] but it wasn't
[1:44:04] and it had to look bad because it had
[1:44:06] started man
[1:44:11] but it was all ordained
[1:44:14] that's right that's right
[1:44:19] why do you think at the end of the seven
[1:44:20] church ages
[1:44:23] of the old testament the bible says that
[1:44:26] they would come and take it by force to
[1:44:27] make him a king because they knew he was
[1:44:29] out of that line
[1:44:31] he was out of the line of judah
[1:44:38] the temple was destroyed in 70 a.d which
[1:44:40] means all these genealogies were lost
[1:44:42] so these disciples luke and matthew had
[1:44:44] to go to that church
[1:44:46] go to the house of god and dig up the
[1:44:47] genealogies to prove that christ was
[1:44:49] directly seen right
[1:44:50] yeah and they had to bring it and prove
[1:44:52] and show that it was after bathsheba too
[1:44:54] and all the way through all these that
[1:44:55] they recorded it all
[1:44:58] because it would be lost in 70 a.d
[1:45:03] and that's why when jesus come on the
[1:45:05] scene he says behold a greater than
[1:45:07] solomon
[1:45:08] is here all
[1:45:15] that temple the right of the church is
[1:45:16] what the holy ghost came down and no one
[1:45:18] could even minister
[1:45:20] that's right now remember look at the
[1:45:21] progression it started out a powerful
[1:45:23] book of acts move
[1:45:26] now into the greater works and now the
[1:45:28] very one that came down
[1:45:31] in solomon's day i think in that temple
[1:45:33] which was the emphasis of the old temple
[1:45:35] now he came down and fleshed his time
[1:45:38] and did the greater works
[1:45:40] yes sir yes sir sorry so what about our
[1:45:44] day
[1:45:45] if jesus's day was so much greater than
[1:45:48] solomon's
[1:45:50] psalm had wisdom he could found the wise
[1:45:52] can follow if the pharisees says he were
[1:45:53] there and someone's day he would
[1:45:54] he would pour them up too he would
[1:45:56] discern him exactly
[1:45:58] remember the story about solomon where
[1:45:59] bathsheba came up from i'm sorry not
[1:46:01] she but she was the the daughter of the
[1:46:03] you know she queen
[1:46:04] or whatever she come up there and i
[1:46:06] heard that there was a testimony in
[1:46:07] history
[1:46:08] where she actually tested the king and
[1:46:10] had men dressed as women to go before
[1:46:12] him and someone called right away said
[1:46:14] those are the men
[1:46:27] but now think of this jesus had to come
[1:46:30] in
[1:46:31] in laodicea of the old testament and
[1:46:34] notice the name of his mother mary
[1:46:36] it means bitterness or rebellion
[1:46:41] every one of these names means something
[1:46:42] he had to come through
[1:46:44] the most bitter and rebellious church
[1:46:47] but he was not of that but he came
[1:47:07] exponential got greater from solomon to
[1:47:10] christ
[1:47:12] what about the end of our age from the
[1:47:15] greatest words
[1:47:15] when the army that has never been in
[1:47:17] john 2 they'll never be an army like it
[1:47:19] or after before anything would be the
[1:47:21] greatest army of gentile warriors
[1:47:24] or christian wars on the face of the
[1:47:25] earth they'll do things
[1:47:27] exploits
[1:47:30] what do you think it's a change from
[1:47:32] colombia to christ was so much different
[1:47:35] we're about from christ to what we see
[1:47:36] now
[1:47:38] respect the unexpectable
[1:47:41] who would have ever imagined that a man
[1:47:42] would alter water
[1:47:45] right remember it was hard for them to
[1:47:47] understand remember the man that was
[1:47:48] born blind was there ever time
[1:47:51] from search from the beginning of the
[1:47:52] world does every man be given sight to
[1:47:54] see from the
[1:47:55] world and never management but here
[1:47:57] jesus made apostles
[1:47:59] amen walking on water walking through
[1:48:02] thin air appearing from thin air right
[1:48:04] through the wall
[1:48:06] that was this was coming what about the
[1:48:08] superior
[1:48:09] ring because remember
[1:48:13] it's a cycle from natural spiritual
[1:48:17] there's spiritual great enough this is
[1:48:19] this is gonna be so much like god he's
[1:48:20] thinking about this
[1:48:24] this is what you have to look forward to
[1:48:26] and what and god made all that possible
[1:48:31] the prophecy the entire prophecy the old
[1:48:33] testament church ages
[1:48:35] came through and god
[1:48:38] used it to start the church
[1:48:49] in fact it had to be her because her
[1:48:51] name meant that
[1:49:12] school please keep your hand on as well
