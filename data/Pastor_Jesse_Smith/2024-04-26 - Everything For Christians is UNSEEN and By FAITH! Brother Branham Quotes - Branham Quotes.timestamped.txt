[0:00] the whole armor of God's by faith we
[0:03] haven't got one natural thing of this
[0:04] world everything of the Christian church
[0:08] is a faith act look at the armor of God
[0:10] love joy peace longsuffering goodness
[0:13] meekness gentl
[0:15] patience is that right everything's
[0:17] Supernatural nothing natural so we don't
[0:20] look at the things natural because we're
[0:22] operating
[0:23] Supernatural and the only way we can
[0:25] base it is Faith is on what God Said was
[0:27] the truth and we look at the Unseen and
[0:30] we call those things which are not as
[0:32] though they were like Abraham did when
[0:35] God
[0:38] Amen Abraham called those things which
[0:41] was not like God did as though they were
[0:44] being a 100 years old staggered not at
[0:45] the promise of God through
[0:47] unbelief I can just imagine that
[0:49] couldn't
[0:50] you see Sarah get up in the morning God
[0:53] said Abraham Abraham you go to have the
[0:55] [Music]
[0:56] baby Sarah God said how you feeling
[0:58] Sarah this is multitude but
[1:01] listen no different well glory to God
[1:03] we're going to have
[1:05] it go get the bird eye and the pins and
[1:07] everything get ready all right another
[1:10] month passed Sarah how you feeling no
[1:13] different year passed Sarah what about
[1:15] it no different 10 years pass no
[1:18] different 25 years pass no
[1:21] different Abraham instead of getting
[1:23] weak he got stronger and stronger he
[1:25] know it's going to be more of a miracle
[1:26] all the time cuz he believed God and he
[1:30] staggered out at the promise of God
[1:32] through
[1:33] unbelief he said we're going to have it
[1:36] one morning the womb of Sarah began to
[1:37] swell and little Isaac was born because
[1:40] Abraham believed God and he looked at
[1:43] the things that kind of those things
[1:44] that was not as though as they were not
[1:47] by feelings not by sight you don't walk
[1:49] by feelings or sight it's by faith and
[1:52] when God has pronounced anything said
[1:54] whatever things you ask when you pray
[1:55] believe you receive it and hold on to it
[1:58] God said so it's got to be so
[2:00] amen demons faith in the father faith in
[2:06] the son faith in the Holy Ghost three in
[2:09] the one demons will tremble and sinners
[2:14] awake faith in Jehovah will anything
[2:17] Shake that's right oh my certain it is
[2:22] have faith in God look to him don't you
[2:27] move stay right there God said so
[2:32] how can we explain things that we don't
[2:35] know that's the reason there's no way at
[2:38] all of ever being saved until you're
[2:42] ready to accept what you cannot
[2:46] explain you've got to believe he that
[2:49] cometh to God must believe that he
[2:52] is I there's no way of scientifically
[2:55] proving that but you must believe it
[2:58] anyhow and if you could prove Pro it
[3:00] then it would no more be an Act of Faith
[3:03] and faith God Is So hid
[3:07] himself until you have to believe that
[3:10] he is without seeing him know that he's
[3:14] there anyhow whether you see it or not
[3:17] you believe it surely you believe it
[3:21] anyhow now I think that's marvelous and
[3:24] that gives uh illiterate people like me
[3:27] a chance everybody to to believe it
[3:31] because we hear it and Faith cometh by
[3:34] hearing and hearing of the word of God
[3:37] then we accept that and believe that and
[3:40] upon the basis of our faith in that we
[3:43] are saved healed and whatever more we
[3:46] draw from God comes from The Unseen
[3:51] resource Christians the whole armor of
[3:55] Christianity is
[3:58] faith everything thing that we have is
[4:03] unseen the only things that's real is
[4:07] unseen
[4:09] unexplained the things that can be
[4:11] explained are not real they're
[4:13] superficial and die but the things that
[4:17] cannot be explained are
[4:20] Immortal the whole realm look at the
[4:23] armor of Christianity
[4:26] love what part of you is
[4:28] love love
[4:30] Joy Faith longsuffering weekness
[4:34] patience see none of those things you
[4:37] can't see them they're unseen but yet we
[4:41] believe them Love Never
[4:44] Dies faith is a is a victory we believe
[4:50] things that we don't see now in Jesus
[4:53] was God God was in Christ reconciling
[4:58] the world to himself and and these
[5:00] people believed his
[5:02] testimony and them that did truly
[5:05] believe it could draw God's blessings
[5:07] from him and when they did so he said
[5:11] virtue went from him virtue is strength
[5:15] he in other words if we'd said today he
[5:18] got weak when the people drawed off of
[5:23] him well if it work that way in that
[5:25] human body it'll work in another human
[5:28] body and we create our our atmosphere
[5:32] around us each one of us you've been
[5:34] with people that were nice people but
[5:36] you just couldn't hardly be around them
[5:38] then you've been with other people that
[5:40] just love to be around them you create
[5:42] that atmosphere and oh wouldn't you love
[5:45] to Been Around Jesus just a wonderful
[5:49] see what that atmosphere he created
[5:51] would have been I imagine it was just
[5:53] one great big bundle of love and
[5:58] respects and Godly
[6:00] fear now I have often heard people say
[6:04] many of you I guess has already played
[6:06] the tape of that last Vision up there
[6:08] why I'm right here in Arizona now and I
[6:11] was oh my if you get it it's what time
[6:14] is it sir if you get a ever bought a
[6:17] tape from us get that one now they're
[6:21] not mine they belong to another company
[6:23] that's with us uh uh with the tapes and
[6:26] um they're not mine so but I know the
[6:29] boy has them and uh I never had anything
[6:32] like that to happen some of them say
[6:34] when you're in the presence of God why
[6:36] don't you ask them this or that it's
[6:39] it's different than what you see what
[6:41] many people calls the power of God is
[6:43] only the blessings of God the power of
[6:45] God's altogether different from the
[6:47] blessings of God the power of God in his
[6:49] presence you just don't know what to do
[6:52] you just you're you're so you're so
[6:54] scared to your numb all over there's two
[6:57] days even in my back in the back of my
[7:00] head and up and down my body I couldn't
[7:02] feel at all and so it just perfectly
[7:05] numbed with such a fear when that
[7:07] constellation of Angels standing right
[7:09] here not just stand looking at him like
[7:11] I am now and you think that would be all
[7:14] well no if you're actually there and see
[7:17] it it's different
