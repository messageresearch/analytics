[0:02] even the Satan our great adversary is
[0:06] such a smart one until he even put
[0:09] sometimes the church before God Satan
[0:13] knows how to make it attractive he's a
[0:16] he's a genius at his job
[0:20] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:22] of
[0:24] the purpose of this video is to answer
[0:26] the question is the phrase dumb devil
[0:29] and acceptable phrase for Christians to
[0:32] use or is it a prideful sinful statement
[0:36] I believe the answer is it's a sinful
[0:38] prideful statement to make which is why
[0:41] I have not used that statement nor do I
[0:43] encourage anyone else to use that
[0:44] statement
[0:46] now friends I would admit anyone in
[0:48] comparison to God is not intelligent is
[0:51] not smart anyone compared to God really
[0:54] knows nothing
[0:55] so we all know Satan is nothing compared
[0:58] to God the Lord Jesus Christ Lord Jesus
[1:01] Christ is infinite so that means he's
[1:03] infinitely greater than the devil but we
[1:06] don't see this prideful attitude in the
[1:08] scripture of Paul Peter James and John
[1:10] calling Satan a dumb devil and again
[1:12] remember friends some of these preachers
[1:14] that are saying dumb devil are the same
[1:17] ones that have called themselves the
[1:18] greatest preachers of all time or among
[1:21] the greatest preachers of all time
[1:23] and that is just complete utter nonsense
[1:25] message preachers today especially the
[1:28] ones that are very wealthy do not suffer
[1:30] in any capacity like the Saints from the
[1:33] Bible days it's not even close they
[1:35] don't sacrifice as much as the Saints
[1:38] from the Bible days and it's not even
[1:40] close
[1:41] so again we should pray for these
[1:42] ministers to repent of their pride of
[1:44] calling themselves the greatest of all
[1:45] time and they need to repent because
[1:47] it's basically the manifestation of the
[1:50] spirit of Pride again in their lives I
[1:53] want to begin by saying we are not to be
[1:55] afraid of Satan and we're not to be
[1:57] worried about Satan because the Bible
[1:59] says greater is Christ that's within us
[2:02] than he that's in the world and Saint
[2:04] Paul said I can do all things through
[2:06] Christ who strengthens me but the
[2:08] reality of it is as Holy Ghost filled
[2:10] Christians or Christians who are in the
[2:12] process of being Sanctified we do not
[2:14] always obey the Holy Spirit we do not
[2:17] always walk in the anointing of the Holy
[2:18] Spirit and so in those moments the enemy
[2:21] can tempt us and make us fall and make a
[2:24] spring reproach upon the holy name of
[2:26] the Lord Jesus Christ and we don't want
[2:27] that to happen
[2:29] and as first Peter 5 8 and 9 say we're
[2:31] to be alert and sober minded because the
[2:34] enemy is like a roaring lion seeking
[2:36] whom he may devour notice the scripture
[2:39] says to be alert to be cautious to be
[2:41] aware of the enemy and the Bible tells
[2:43] us to resist him standing firm in the
[2:46] faith
[2:47] and friends we know that the word of God
[2:49] will defeat Satan any time any place
[2:51] anywhere as God's Prophet brother
[2:52] Branham said
[2:55] here it is
[2:57] I want you to see it and get it now the
[3:00] word of God written word of God will
[3:03] defeat Satan anywhere any place any time
[3:08] it's written
[3:11] there it is
[3:13] everybody wouldn't have gifts
[3:16] Jesus brought it down to a place where
[3:18] those who do not have gifts and do not
[3:21] have very much Faith did you say it is
[3:23] written
[3:24] there it is and stand right on that
[3:28] but I have noticed a trend over the last
[3:30] few years of certain message preachers
[3:32] popular famous message preachers using
[3:35] this phrase dumb devil and I do not
[3:37] believe it is an appropriate phrase to
[3:40] use I believe it's a prideful sinful
[3:42] statement to use and one evidence of
[3:44] that is that I've seen three of these
[3:46] preachers go through awful situations
[3:49] and I just wonder if these awful
[3:52] situations are the result of this
[3:54] prideful statement calling the devil
[3:56] dumb
[3:58] two of the situations are cancer related
[4:00] and one situation was a divorce
[4:02] situation
[4:03] so I believe the wisdom of God along
[4:05] with the quotes of God's Prophet brother
[4:07] Branham teach us that we have to respect
[4:10] our enemy
[4:11] of course we do not have to obey our
[4:13] enemy we do not have to fall to our
[4:15] enemy although brother Andrew said we'll
[4:17] sin daily we don't have to be a slave to
[4:19] our enemy but it's clear obviously we
[4:22] should not exalt ourselves in a prideful
[4:25] sinful way and call the devil dumb when
[4:29] there are no quotes in the Bible that
[4:30] say that and there's no quotes from
[4:32] Brother Branham that say that
[4:34] so again it's sad the preachers who say
[4:36] they most closely follow brother Bradham
[4:38] they most closely obey the Bible are
[4:41] saying things and doing things that the
[4:43] Bible does not say nor does brother
[4:45] Branham say
[4:46] I'll share a few more scriptures about
[4:48] what the Bible teaches regarding the
[4:50] enemy the Bible says Satan would hinder
[4:53] some of Paul's travels that's in first
[4:55] Thessalonians 2 Verse 18 wherefore we
[4:58] would have come unto you even I Paul
[5:00] once again but Satan hindered us so
[5:03] notice Paul doesn't call the devil dumb
[5:05] or the devil doesn't know what he's
[5:07] doing he admits that the enemy hindered
[5:09] him from coming God allowed the enemy to
[5:12] hinder Paul's travels and God knew Satan
[5:15] would do that but yet he allowed it
[5:17] another verse is Jude 1 verse 9 Yet
[5:20] Michael the Archangel and contending
[5:22] with the devil he disputed about the
[5:23] body of Moses thirst not bring against
[5:25] him a railing accusation but said the
[5:27] Lord rebuked thee
[5:28] so notice even Michael the Archangel
[5:31] showed some level of respect
[5:34] for Satan Satan was wondering where the
[5:36] body of Moses was of course we know what
[5:38] happened God resurrected Moses body took
[5:41] it up to heaven and then we know about
[5:42] 1500 years later he did make it to the
[5:44] promised land as brother Branham said
[5:46] and he talked with Jesus and of course
[5:49] Elijah was there as well on Mount
[5:50] Transfiguration but even Michael the
[5:52] Archangel would not give a railing
[5:55] accusation against the devil he just
[5:57] said the Lord rebuked thee that's why I
[6:00] feel like some of these message
[6:00] preachers have done when they call Satan
[6:03] dumb devil it's like a railing
[6:05] accusation against Satan and not even a
[6:08] holy Heavenly Archangel would bring a
[6:11] railing accusation against the enemy
[6:14] here's seven quotes from Brother Branham
[6:15] I'm going to play and in these seven
[6:18] quotes brother Branham literally says
[6:20] the opposite of what message preachers
[6:22] are saying today brother Brown never
[6:24] said dumb devil brother Brandon said
[6:26] Satan is smart and a genius
[6:28] to hear some of the phrases brother
[6:30] Branham used good adversary great
[6:33] adversary smart one satanu the Bible as
[6:37] good as Jesus did he's good at the job
[6:39] more than a match for a human being
[6:42] you're not a match for him he's a genius
[6:45] at his job
[6:46] so let's go through these quotes in
[6:48] chronological order in 1959 be certain
[6:50] of God by the ram said Satan our great
[6:53] adversaries such a smart one let's
[6:55] listen to the quote
[6:56] even the Satan our great adversary is
[7:00] such a smart one until he even put
[7:03] sometimes the church before God
[7:08] you might have a great church
[7:11] it may be a great building
[7:13] art may be a great denomination
[7:17] and again it made me a great
[7:19] congregation but let nothing come before
[7:23] God in your heart
[7:26] anything and before God is an idol
[7:31] next quote is from 1961 in uncertain
[7:33] sound brother random said Satan knows
[7:36] how to make it attractive he's a genius
[7:38] at his job let's listen to the quote
[7:41] but sin is attractive
[7:44] any way you take it see it as attractive
[7:47] to the human being because he's a
[7:49] subject of of the Fallen race that we
[7:53] are
[7:54] and it's attractive
[7:56] Satan knows how to make it attractive
[7:59] he's a he's a genius at his job
[8:03] and he if he can't get it out there in
[8:05] the world Affair he brings it right into
[8:08] the church
[8:09] he comes right over on our own ground
[8:13] that's the reason Brethren sisters we
[8:16] should recognize him
[8:18] it's time that the church was spiritual
[8:21] to recognize no God not by Creed not by
[8:26] denomination but by experience amen
[8:30] being filled with the Holy Ghost
[8:34] in the greatest battle ever fought in
[8:36] 1962 brother Branham said he's praying
[8:39] and he mentioned Satan he said I know
[8:40] that you're more than a match for a
[8:41] human being but you're not a match for
[8:44] my Lord let's listen to the quote
[8:55] [Music]
[9:05] of the devil foreign
[9:10] [Music]
[9:19] next in
[9:21] 1962 wisdom versus faith brother instead
[9:23] of Satan knew the Bible as good as Jesus
[9:26] did but it wouldn't work for Satan let's
[9:28] listen to the quote
[9:31] two great forces come together knowledge
[9:34] and faith
[9:36] Jesus knew who he was Satan knew the
[9:39] Bible as good as Jesus did
[9:42] but it wouldn't work for Satan
[9:44] no matter how much knowledge you have it
[9:46] will work now take that back to Sunday's
[9:48] big organization
[9:51] thank heaven
[9:53] they say well we got the word let me see
[9:55] it work you Catholics you say you're the
[9:57] original let's see it
[10:02] show me your Works without you or show
[10:04] me your words back or without your faith
[10:06] not straight Mindy
[10:08] see what the word said
[10:11] next in putting on the whole armor of
[10:13] God in 1962 brother random said
[10:15] he's good at the job he's a good
[10:17] adversary let's listen to the quote
[10:19] now in order to do this he has to make
[10:22] it very appealing reasons
[10:25] and that's why Satan does he's good at
[10:27] the job
[10:28] and he's a good adversary sir and he
[10:32] makes it appealing he had to make it
[10:33] appealing to you he said now look a deer
[10:37] uh you know you don't know what's right
[10:39] and wrong
[10:40] and uh you you must remember that if
[10:44] this fruit is Pleasant to the eye it
[10:47] it'll make one wise and all oh if that
[10:50] isn't a good bait
[10:52] and then again I'm putting on the whole
[10:54] armor of God
[10:55] LeBron said you can't do it in yourself
[10:57] now you're not a match for him but if
[10:58] you'll just just outdo it get the word
[11:00] in you then it'll all be taken care of
[11:02] let's listen to the quote
[11:04] talking speaking I'm working
[11:09] oh my that's it I'll do the do I'll do
[11:13] the work just let them humble himself
[11:14] let us empty up amen
[11:20] that's it you can't do it in yourself
[11:22] now you're not a natural but if you miss
[11:24] that God do it get the word in you then
[11:26] it'll be taken care of
[11:29] in closing friends hope this video has
[11:32] been a help I've been a blessing as I've
[11:34] shown over the past few years I've seen
[11:36] such a spirit of Pride on lots of
[11:38] message preachers and this is just one
[11:39] more manifestation of that and I could
[11:42] be wrong but it seems to be some
[11:43] connection with the preachers that use
[11:46] this dumb devil statement it seems like
[11:49] the devil is then allowed to attack them
[11:51] in some very serious ways but again I'm
[11:53] not completely certain about that I
[11:55] certainly don't want any of the viewers
[11:56] or myself or anyone to take any chances
[11:59] in taking a prideful attitude and
[12:02] exalting ourselves so highly that we
[12:04] underestimate our adversary when brother
[12:07] Ram said he's a worthy adversary and
[12:09] he's a genius at his job again we've got
[12:11] to remember first Peter 5 6-8 humble
[12:13] yourselves under the mighty hand of God
[12:15] that he may exalt you in due time notice
[12:17] God is always saying humble ourselves
[12:19] not pridefully exalt ourselves casting
[12:22] all of our care upon him for he careth
[12:24] for us we must be sober be villigent
[12:27] because your adversary that devil as a
[12:30] roaring lion walketh about seeking whom
[12:32] he may devour whom resists steadfast in
[12:35] the faith knowing that the same
[12:36] afflictions are accomplished in your
[12:37] brethren that are in the world
[12:40] see friends we got to be sober we got to
[12:42] be diligent sober means to be calm and
[12:44] collected in spirit temperate Vigilant
[12:47] means to give strict attention to to
[12:50] watch to be cautious to be active to
[12:53] take heed less through remission and
[12:55] indolence some destructive Calamity
[12:57] suddenly overtakes one
[12:59] so we don't want to get a Carefree
[13:01] attitude and mock Satan and exalt
[13:03] ourselves so highly like we're the ones
[13:06] who actually defeat Satan we're not it's
[13:08] the word of God that defeats Satan
[13:09] through our lips we've got to believe it
[13:11] yes but it's not by our own human
[13:13] strength it's by the word of God the
[13:16] anointing of the Holy Ghost
[13:18] friends we must steadfastly resist the
[13:21] enemy
[13:22] so it's the enemy who anoints preachers
[13:25] with a prideful spirit and then these
[13:27] preachers exalt themselves against the
[13:29] enemy with an evil spirit they exalt
[13:32] themselves against an evil spirit it's
[13:35] just like brother man told us that's how
[13:36] countries have wars the demon powers
[13:39] anointing one country will have jealousy
[13:41] or some type of bitterness or some type
[13:44] of Feud with another country that's
[13:47] Anointed with other demons and they'll
[13:48] go to war we know God is not the author
[13:51] of these wars God allows them of course
[13:54] it's in the sermon Victory Day 1963
[13:57] brother Ram said those Spirits get
[13:58] jealous of one another and what do they
[14:00] do they cause War that's right because
[14:03] every nation is controlled by Satan
[14:05] let's listen to the quote
[14:07] and then those Spirits get jealous of
[14:09] another spirit and what do they do they
[14:12] call us War
[14:13] that's right now you see every nation is
[14:17] controlled by Satan the Bible said so
[14:19] he's a god of the Nations
[14:22] Satan took Jesus up top the mountain and
[14:24] said showed him all the kingdoms is in
[14:26] the world all the kingdoms and out of
[14:28] time and said these are mine I do with
[14:30] them anything I want you he said I'll
[14:31] give them over to you if you worship me
[14:33] Jesus said get behind me Satan
[14:37] Francis of a humble holy ghost-filled
[14:39] Christian Life and God will exalt Us in
[14:42] due time let's not exalt ourselves now
[14:44] like many message preachers are doing
[14:46] let's humble ourselves now and then God
[14:48] will exalt Us in his due time
