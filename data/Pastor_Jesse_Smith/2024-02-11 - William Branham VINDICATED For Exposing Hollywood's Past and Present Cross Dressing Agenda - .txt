TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] amen you don't even know where you're a man or woman it's a it's an Abomination for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man the great unchanging God doesn't change greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show how God's Prophet brother William brandham continues to be Vindicated for exposing the sin and wickedness of the Hollywood agenda to promote homosexuality I'm Jesse Smith pastor of bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA for the past 17 years and by God's grace I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his true Prophet The Late William brandham 1909 to 1965 and I also defend The Godly Christian character of William brandham here's the outline for the video first will show the Bible warning of the homosexual agenda second we'll show quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham third I'll overview a video I saw from the good fight Ministries and share some resources that might help you and lastly we'll look at warnings for believers and then of course warnings of corrupt fruits beginning with Bible warning in Luke 17: 28-30 really verses 2 8- 37 Jesus Christ prophesied that as it was in the days of Noah and Sodom Jesus said even thus shall be in the day when the son of man is revealed so Jesus was speaking so Jesus was speaking of the end of the times of the Gentiles of course when he would reveal himself as son of man and a son of man is a prophet in human flesh and of course this is referring to Jesus Christ anointing William brandom to be a prophet of God here in this last and final Church age the seventh Church age the latan church age and for the sake of this video I'm just going to emphasize Jesus saying as it was in the days of lot so the days of lot were days of the most heinous corrupt sins it's described in Genesis 19 you see it specifically in Genesis 19: 4-1 you see gangs of men doing the most heinous and wicked acts and I've got to be careful what I say of course just a disclaimer some of the content on this video will be inappropriate for children so please use discretion on who hears this video so in Genesis 19 we see the very height of the wickedness of Sodom before God destroyed it it was gangs of men surrounding houses in order to do their most wicked desires it was the homosexual agenda so Jesus Christ prophesied the conditions of the world would have to get to this state when he would return as a son of man and so the homosexual agenda was just beginning to take off in the lifetime of brother brandham of course now it's been legalized I think in 2015 by the Supreme Court of the United States friends really we're only 59 years since brother Brandon passed that's very little time from God's perspective because God is outside of time a few other verses that go along with this warning is of course Deuteronomy 225 it's an Abomination for a man to wear that which pertaineth to a woman and also a woman to wear that which pertaineth to to a man and sadly those people without understanding think that's only an Old Testament verse but they don't understand that most of the Abominations from the Old Testament were moral laws of God and they carry over to the New Testament I have an entire video on that if you like to watch it I'll put the link in the description then of course 1 Timothy 2:9 commands modest clothing for Christians and usually it's the sexually immoral whether homosexual or hor mongers that dress immodestly so immodest clothing is one of the first steps into this sinful slippery slope leading down the path to the lowest form of debauchery and wickedness which is that Genesis 19: 4-1 description the homosexual agenda next let's look at some quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham and just to give you an idea about how many times brother brandham mentioned Deuteronomy 225 it's close to 100 times 64 times brother om sets Abomination for a man to wear that which pertaineth to a woman and vice versa 20 times he cited Deuteronomy 225 with the words Abomination and clothing then about 10 times he cited Deuteronomy 225 with the words Abomination and crossdressing or dressing here's just one quote from doors and door February 6th 1965 notice brother random connects crossdressing with also the hairstyles of course this is all connected these sins are all connected once a person starts cutting their hair the wrong way so for a woman if she cuts her hair that's a total disgrace if a man grows his hair out long that's an awful disgrace brother random courageously stands up for Deuteronomy 225 in the Bible encouraging telling us to act like Sons and Daughters of god let's listen to the quote Oh I thought what a thing for Christianity women stop that wearing them clothes like that men stop that tell them muddy jokes and all that stuff we're Sons and Daughters of the king dressed like a queen dress like a a lady act like a gentleman don't let your hair grow down like this the Bible said it's wrong nature teaches it for a man to have long hair and it's a disgrace and a common thing for even a woman to pray with her haircut and how about these it's a it's an Abomination for a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man the great un changing God doesn't change but yet today it's just as Loose as the rest of our nation is a shame let's act like Sons and Daughters of god let's live like it we are we are sons of a king we we're right M this bunch of mess and dirt and filth around here people call themselves Christians and still acting like that here's another quote from Satan's Eden brother brandom rebukes these men for wearing bangs like girls putting curlers in their hair brother Bram calls them big sissies but brother Ram cites the scripture judgment begins at the house of God of course what brother Brandon was seeing this crossdressing agenda was just in its seed form now we see the mature form of it it's such a disgrace that some people rebuke brother brandham for calling these people out but time has shown brother Brenham was led by the Holy Ghost to give These Warnings and rebuke these people for getting under the spirit of perversion trying to change their genders these teenage boys trying to act like girls but for us as Believers it's such a Vindication that brother brand was truly led by the Holy Ghost let's listen to the quote now he now wears her bangs also he Combs them down puts a curler in them some of the most sickly sights I've ever seen in my life is some of those kids out here today with their bangs combed down like this and colored bleached hair with some kind of a peroxide something and bleach their hair and and curlers making Banks you big am that's a horrible thing to say from a p pit but judgment begins at the house of God you don't even know where you're a man or woman amen and I understand that our United States Army is coming out next in shars oh my Lord that's right see what the perversion is it's a woman's clothes where's her Banks the other day I was over and so friends I could play many more quotes but I'm trying to keep this video shorter let's move to the third section the good fight video I'll leave a link in the description to this video and again be careful who you let watch this video it has more mature content not fit for children this video was put out on January 12th of this year 2024 and as I was scrolling on my YouTube app I saw this title and I was shocked by the title because it said it was exposing Hollywood's crossdressing agenda and of course my mind instantly went to how brother Randon rebuked crossdressing now just to summarize this video they talk about numerous Hollywood Elite people some of them I'm not very familiar with and I shouldn't be because I'm a holy ghost filed Christian of course I don't watch any of their content now but as a sinner I I lived as a sinner for nearly 19 years so some of these names I am familiar with but the main idea of the video is to show how a comedian named Cat Williams was showing how Hollywood Executives were trying to get men to wear dresses I guess Martin Lawrence wore dresses in the Big Mama's House videos or movies one of them was in 2006 I remember the movie Mrs Doubtfire I never watched it but it from 1993 Robin Williams dressed as a woman friends look what happened to his life he committed suicide then there was a movie called To Wong Fu from 1995 I never saw that the bird cage 1996 I never saw that all these movies contained crossdressing drag queens Abominations in the sight of God and then the video showed how TD Jake associated with Ty Perry Tyler Perry is apparently a comedian he's a crossdresser in his movies about a woman called Meda and this has helped promote the trans agenda and the authors of this video think that the enemy has used Tyler Perry and TD Jake to help the black community accept drag queens through comedy one thing I liked about this video is it showed a black preacher condemning Tyler Perry's trans agenda so it was really wonderful to see that preacher stand up for the truth in this subject of crossdressing and Deuteronomy 225 the video showed Dave Chappelle was pressured by Hollywood Executives three times to wear dresses and then a man named Brandon T Jackson believes he's cursed because he wore a dress on a movie before moving on from this good fight video I was talking to my wife and she noted that good fight is rightly Disturbed that Hollywood is trying to feminized men but what good fight did not recognize is that the same shock and outrage was expressed about a hundred years ago when women started wearing pants so it's our prayer that good fight will eventually recognize the masculinization of women that took place a 100 years ago and begin teaching for women to wear dresses and skirts and for men only to wear pants and friends here are some resources I want to share of course the First Resource is brother BR sermons again there's at least 100 probably more quotes from his sermons that condemn crossdressing according to Deuteronomy 22:5 remember God is unchanging he said I am the Lord thy God I change not if crossdressing was abominable to God in the days of Moses and Jesus fulfilled all the Moses's commands then Jesus would have been against crossdressing and then he's the same yesterday today and forever another resource is my 2009 18 book restoring Christian modesty God's perfect will for your outward appearance this book covers all the basics of A Modest Christian appearance in chapter 3 it covers the four guidelines for modest clothing and one of them is dressing according to your gender and that's of course according to the word of God chapter four is on hair length chapter five is on jewelry makeup tattoos and high heels chapter six to me is very powerful in relation to this video it's connecting American fashion history with the Bible and it shows a Time timeline from the 1800s to the current on how Satan has slowly weakened the standards for Holiness in the late 1800s the enemy anointed Amelia Bloomer to introduce Bloomers women in pants then of course in universities female universities mainly they got the women to crossdress in their plays and then around the time of World War I women were forced to work in factories and they were forced to wear pants in the Roaring 20s the women started cutting their hair bobbing their hair like men wearing makeup wearing more seductive skirts and then World War II in the 1940s allowed more women to go to the factories and wear pants and crossdressing just became a common thing the 1960s was the rise of the sexual Revolution the miniskirt was popularized and then Hollywood started promoting the sexual Revolution and one resource I found said the 1970s can be summed up in one word pants of course this was women wearing pants I have entire chapter laying out all these resources all these historical facts a couple in particular are this book called women in pants 2003 if you want to know the extreme uproar that happened in the United States when women started wearing pants please read this book I share this with one of brother am's accusers in my 2020 debate I doubt he ever read it but I encourage him to read it so he would understand the truth that brother Brandon preached showing how crossdressing was was an Abomination also addressed for the occasion a book written in 1999 of course none of these books were written by Christians while I was sitting in a college course I'm a school teacher I was in an education class and my professor just showed this book and I instantly knew that's the reason I was in this class was to get this book and of course this book shows how the United States fashion changed from its Inception 1700s to the current day and then a lot of these historical facts iuse used in my book let's look at warnings finally friends as Holy Ghost filled Christians let's remember to always stay away from Hollywood Disney and just movies in general there are very few movies that Christians should watch at all remember first Thessalonians 5:22 abstain from all appearance of evil let's remember how Satan often attacks people he gets them to laugh at sin he gets them to let their guard down friends we must not laugh at sin we must sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the city as Ezekiel 9 says we must not compromise on crossdressing that's why I humbly say to the parents of Believers please don't let your daughters wear pajama pants to bed I have a video about that it's just so sad you know often we see people make one little compromise and then when families learn to compromise in one area then it'll multiply just like how the leaven impacts the entire lump of dough as Jesus said our sisters should not even trim their hair our brothers should not let their hair grow out so it looks like it's women's hair let's take warning from these things of course we Rejoice that God's Prophet is currently being Vindicated for exposing all these wicked things well let's take warning as well and also friends remember I've shared this on a few podcasts some of brother Ram's accusers that have left the message are making so many sinful com compromises and I'm not going to call names but I will put their podcast on the video here in one podcast a man says he wants to dress up like Dracula now of course Dracula is a fictitious fornicating blood sucker and murderer but yet this man wants to dress up like him and have his children dress up like him you can listen to it on this podcast and the same man on another podcast more recently interviewed someone who left the message and they're crying and just happy that one of their sisters is now non-binary and this accuser brother brandom doesn't try to correct the woman for this non-binary stand in fact he just cries apparently tears of happiness for this family to be free from the message of course I don't know if this is a good message church or a bad Church it sounds like a bad church and if this family did leave a sinful Message Church well then that's good but what I'm pointing out is that when people leave the TRU true Bible teachings of brother brandham they open themselves up to evil spirits and here a man accusing brother brandham falsely of course is now idolizing fictitious evil characters he also admits to watching a lot of dirty Evil movies and now he seemingly accepts the non-binary attitude and I didn't even know what non-binary was so I had to look it up from one health.com website it says an adjective describing a person who does not identify exclusive exclusively as a man or a woman so just simply the non-binary attitude defies God's commands and God's truth of Genesis chapter 1 he made them male and female but an evil spirit a perverse Spirit an antichrist spirit will anoint someone to believe well maybe I'm not male all the time maybe I'm not female all the time so let's take warning from all these cases friends and let's stand with the truth in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God I thought it was so fitting that here we see other churches and of course they're not message churches recognizing this evil crossdressing agenda but we can be so thankful in the message of the hour that we've heard God's Prophet brother brandham warn us of this agenda from the moment we heard brother brandham preaching and the Holy Spirit has kept us safe and clean given us These Warnings and we live our lives in accordance and obedience to the revelation of Jesus Christ so friends let's earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints let us not turn Grace into lusciousness as Jude 13 and four says according to Titus Chapter 2 Grace teaches us to deny ungodliness deny crossdressing deny non-binary attitudes deny sinful movies it teaches us to live in Holiness and do Godly holy works for the glory of Jesus Christ as Titus 2 11-4 says the grace of God teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly lust but to live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of Good Works let's be zealous through the works of Jesus Christ today and hold up the standard of Holy Ghost filled Christianity if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
