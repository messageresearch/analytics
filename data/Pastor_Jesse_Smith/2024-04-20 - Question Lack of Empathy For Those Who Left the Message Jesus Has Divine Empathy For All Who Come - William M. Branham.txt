TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] many has seared the conscience of people and has caused disappointments and everything but father I pray that you'll brast back every scar tonight heal every broken heart and may the power of God once more burn in a living faith through every heart granted Lord that Your Great Name might be glorified for we ask that in Jesus Christ's name [Music] amen greetings friends in the m ous name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a question I got from an email the question asked did I have a lack of empathy for people who have left the message and by God's grace I'm going to try to answer this as humbly and as kindly with as much brotherly kindness as it possibly can by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor of bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his genuine Prophet The Late William Ram 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother bram's true genuine Godly Christian character So my answer to this question is no I think I have a lot of empathy for people who have been hurt around message circles or message churches I feel that if it appears I don't have empathy it's because I'm focusing on doctrinal differences between people who have left the message and not really the real deep pain or abuse that some people have experienced in sinful message churches I thought it'd be good to start with the definition of empathy from Webster's Dictionary the action of understanding being aware of being sensitive to and vicariously experiencing the feelings thoughts and experience of another so to all of our viewers I want to let you know I am aware of and I understand the pain of your feelings and thoughts and experiences you've had if you've been hurt I'm so sorry are you been hurt in any way by any message church and again if a message church has sin in it and the message church is doing awful evil abusive wicked things then they should not be called a message church and they are not born again they do not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm very sorry you experienced those pains those abuses or any other hurtful experience the reason I can understand what you're going through is because I've had numerous people who are close to me friends others who've experienced abuse and have been through heartwrenching experiences and my heart has broken for them I've wept with them I've cried with them I've prayed with them so I assure all the viewers and all the people that have left the message that I have empathy on your pain and again in most of my videos I'm dealing with doctrinal issues Revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to brother brandham I'm defending brother brandom's bible-based Doctrine on his major doctrines and so so that's been the focus of my videos in the past that will probably be the focus of my videos to come in the future by God's grace cuz that's what God's called me to do I feel in my heart in humility I say that of course and I want to let the viewers know in all the message churches I've been in contact with I've only been treated with brotherly love and kindness and so all my experiences with message churches has been positive as far as I know by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and I'm sorry yours have not been as positive I'm sorry if they been awful hurtful abusive neglectful I'm very sorry about that and I'm sure all of our viewers feel the same way by the grace of God in a few of my videos I've encouraged wives who've been abused to contact authorities I've encouraged those who've been abused to use all the power of the law to bring the Predators to conviction as a Christian I never want to see people hurt or abused or neglected in any way but sometimes of course it happens God allows it but then we know God is there to offer his empathy his Divine empathy his Divine compassion the scripture says in Hebrews 4:15 Jesus can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities he was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Jesus is the great high priest who brings healing Jesus's wonderful words in Matthew 11 Comfort us show us his empathy come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you learn of me for I meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest un unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light so if you've been hurt friends please come to Jesus today by God's grace he will give you rest you can place your burdens on Christ you can cast your cares on him for he cares for you of course I know by experience with others that healing takes time remember Proverbs 18:14 a wounded Spirit who can bear with these deep pains in life they're extremely hard to bear that's why we got to constantly go to Jesus cast our cares on him for he cares for us the Bible says Jesus is so gentle Matthew 1220 a bruised Reed he shall not break a smoking flax he shall not quench so friends if you've been hurt Jesus will not hurt you more Jesus will heal you he'll be gentle with you he'll be merciful to you he won't put out your fire or your love for him he'll make that fire be restored he'll restore the joy of your salvation Hallelujah there's at least five verses that say Jesus was moved with compassion Matthew 9:36 he was moved with compassion on the multitudes because they fainted they were as sheep without having a Shepherd the Bible said in Matthew 14:14 he was moved with compassion to heal the sick in Jesus's parable about forgiveness Jesus said the lord of the servant was moved with compassion loosed him and forgave the debt this shows Jesus's compassion to forgive our sins then there's Mark 1:41 and Mark 6:34 for he was moved with compassion to heal then he was moved with compassion again on the multitudes and began to teach them many things so if you're hurting if you've been through awful situations Jesus will teach you he will heal you he will heal your broken Spirit the Bible even says God is very nigh to you if you've been hurt or broken Psalm 34:1 15-19 God's ears are open to your cry the face of the Lord is against all them that do evil the righteous cry and the Lord heareth and the Lord will deliver them out of all their troubles the Lord is nine to them that are of a broken heart and save as such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth him out of them all praise the Lord Jesus Christ friends if you're hurting God is nigh unto you I think it's important to note as well that there's a time to weep there's a time to mourn and there's a time to be healed and a time to Rejoice we see this in Ecclesiastes 3:4 a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance Romans 12:14 and 15 says bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep so I'm taking this moment this video to mourn with those who've been hurt to weep with those who've wept and I mean that in all sincerity you know yesterday I just wept and rejoiced in the same day I had a 38-year-old friend who died from muscular distrophy and I wept with his father on the phone it was extremely heartbreaking I'm 43 and this young man is younger than me he's 38 and so I know what it's like to weep with those who weep but then the same day there's a couple that's never had children they've been the message many years they've been trying to have children for many years and on that same day I got a text from the husband saying they had their first child after all these years of pain and miscarriages and so I Rejoice with those who rejoice and I weep with those who weep so by God's grace I want to have a prayer for those who've been hurt in so-called message churches and I'm sorry you were hurt and I'm sorry those message churches did not represent Christ it seems like those false message churches they blasphemed Christ so I'm very sorry that they did not represent Jesus Christ the way they ought to have that's heartbreaking I'm very sorry for you also I want to have empathy for others you know in my 2021 book I did all this research on the Catholic church and I saw all the data about the thousands and thousands of people who've been hurt by Catholic priests and nuns and I even have a family member who as a child in the Catholic school was physically thrown up against the lockers slapped around pushed around thrown around by Catholic nuns so friends this is a subject that's dear to my heart I've just never dealt with this subject before but I want to make this video today by God's grace as I feel the leading of the Holy Ghost by the grace of God one more thing about empathy I want to share a testimony from a brother in the message his name is Mike MOSI his example of forgiving someone who sinned against him is one of the most powerful examples of forgiveness I've ever seen I'll put a link to Mike's testimony in the description precious brother Mike was shot by a cop and is paralyzed because of that he's still believing God for Divine Healing this man has great faith great confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ and on the testimony video if you'll watch it he goes into the courtroom and raises his King James Bible and says he wants to give the cop the forgiveness that he deserves so this is amazing forgiveness friends this is amazing empathy that the Lord Jesus Christ anointed brother Mike with and I've talked to brother Mike about this personally Mike said it it wasn't my ability to heal it was the ability and the Forgiveness of Jesus Christ expressed through him I've always shared this you know I believe brother Mike has way more faith than I have because of the difficult situations he's gone through and yet he still has trust and faith in Jesus Christ he's a follower of this message but he loves all people he prays for all people whether they're in the message or not a true example of a genuine Christian expressing God's Divine empathy so I hope this testimonial video can be a help to some people if you haven't seen it it's a true example of the empathy of the Lord Jesus Christ so let's pray for those who've been hurt in message churches and also those that have been hurt anywhere else whether in the home or whether in school or churches let's pray for them by God's grace father God you call yourself the great physician Lord and surely you are you're God of compassion God of Mercy I pray for those who've been hurt in false message churches pray your holy spirit will heal them Lord guide them into all truth Lord God may you renew their strength like the eagle Lord as the scripture says and I know you are nigh unto them may they recognize your presence God and may the great high priest heal their infirmities Lord because you can understand Lord Jesus you were abused more than any person could have ever been abused your Visage was marred Lord the scripture says in Isaiah 52 so I know you can have compassion I know you can relate to their their pain and suffering dear God so I ask in the name of Jesus Christ you'd help these people that were hurt and have left mess to churches may they find peace may they find forgiveness may they find a real Holy Ghost filled Church Lord by the grace of God may they find your PE peace may you be able to heal their Wounded Spirits to some degree Lord I know we always have scars Lord we always have scars of bad memories Lord God but you are the great physician Lord God and the scripture says you make All Things New in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 so Lord Jesus may they find healing through the Holy Spirit I ask it Lord Jesus father be with those again that have been hurt Lord in schools or homes Lord God any victim of abuse I just pray God your Holy Spirit would be with them be nigh to them heal them I ask it Lord Jesus Lord just as I prayed yesterday for the family of my 38-year-old friend I just pray in Christ's name your spirit will be with them as They Mourn God we just ask for your mercy Lord God blessed are those who mourn for they should be comforted and Lord bless that family Lord that had their first child yesterday after many years of trying many years of Heartache many years of miscarriages Lord thank you for giving them a child so father be near to all those that need you today Lord God all the hurting all The Afflicted all the broken Lord God I believe you'll do it Lord as they reach out to you as they draw near to you may you draw near to them in Jesus Christ's name amen one other thing I thought I'd share also by God's grace is that I hope people that have left the message can also have empathy for brother brandom and I understand people that have been hurt in message churches will have hurt feelings toward brother brandom I totally understand that but I just pray for these people that have left the message in the right season because God works in Seasons we saw that in Ecclesiastes 3 in the right season After experiencing Jesus's healing they'll have empathy for brother brandom who is abused as a child he was raised in a racist family and Community but he overcame it by the the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ brother Ram was no doubt physically abused it seems like even by his parents he setting questions and answers part 464 that he thought he had the biggest temper out of anybody he said oh I had a mouth mashed all the time I taken a lot of my meals out of a straw brother Ram was speaking about his mother and said my mouth was mashed they just pick me up and knock me down and they knocked me down again till I just got too unable to get up anymore more that's always and then when I got able to get up I got up again they knocked me down again so that's just the way I had it let's listen to the quote sweeten your temper with prayer then make up your mind there I don't guess there there too many people in this building ever had any more temper than I did to begin with oh I I had a mouth mashed all the time and I I I taken a lot of my meals out of a straw my mother as you know was a half Indian and my father was an Irishman a Kentucky Irish at that and every one of both of them had enough temper to fight a buz saw and all the time my mouth was mashed I was little to begin with they just pick me up and knocked me down and I get up again then knocked me down again till I just got too able unable to get up anymore that's always and now when I got able to get up I got up again they knocked me down again so that's just way I had it and I thought I could never be a Christian but when the Holy Spirit came into my life that's done it so that's my prayer friends that those that have left the message can have empathy towards brother brandom and understand how he was raised and how he suffered abuse as well friends we all need the healing powers of the Lord Jesus Christ now and until the Lord comes by God's grace then the scripture says even after we're in heaven Jesus will still wipe away the tears from our eyes Revelation 21:4 says and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away we have so much hope in the Gospel of Jesus Christ so please friends know that I'm praying for you I'll pray for everyone Again by God's grace if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
