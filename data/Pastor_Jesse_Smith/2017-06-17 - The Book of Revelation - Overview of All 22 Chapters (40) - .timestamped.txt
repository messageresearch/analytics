[0:00] Oh
[0:00] [Music]
[0:07] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:13] this video is to teach an overview on
[0:15] the book of Revelation God promised to
[0:18] bless those who read or hear this book
[0:20] and also keep the things that are
[0:23] written in this prophetic book of
[0:24] tremendous importance the word
[0:27] revelation means to lay bare or make
[0:30] visible so the book of Revelation is the
[0:32] unveiling of Jesus Christ Himself who he
[0:36] is who his true servants are who his
[0:38] enemies are what his plans are for
[0:41] Humanity and the destinies of all men
[0:43] and also angels to begin with the
[0:47] foundation of our understanding of the
[0:49] book of Revelation comes not from a
[0:52] theological seminary but from thus saith
[0:54] the Lord through God's endtime prophet
[0:57] William Branham Amos chapter 3 verses 7
[1:01] and 8 state that God will do nothing
[1:04] except he first reveal his secrets to
[1:06] his servants the prophets and that was
[1:09] what God did in 1960 and 1963 God
[1:13] supernaturally revealed the secrets
[1:16] behind the Bible symbols of three
[1:18] complete chapters in the book of
[1:19] Revelation chapters 2 3 and 6 and then
[1:24] God had his prophet brother Branham
[1:26] speak God's own stamp of approval by
[1:29] proclaiming that the teachings were thus
[1:31] saith the Lord
[1:32] now the vision plus the word plus the
[1:36] history plus the church ages and all
[1:38] blend together so I could truly say that
[1:43] to the best of my understanding and
[1:45] according to the Word of God and the
[1:48] vision and the revelation the
[1:50] interpretation thereof is thus saith
[1:53] along a summary of the book of
[1:57] Revelation would be as follows in
[1:59] Chapter 1 st. John received the
[2:02] revelation of Jesus Christ and saw
[2:04] Christ in his supreme deity proving that
[2:07] Christ is not a second person but the
[2:10] image of the one person of God for in
[2:13] Christ dwells all the fullness of the
[2:15] Godhead bodily Jesus Christ is God
[2:18] Christ's physical appearance
[2:20] his Sevenfold glory as supreme judge of
[2:23] the universe as he held the seven stars
[2:25] in his hand and stood in the midst of
[2:28] the seven golden candlesticks in
[2:31] chapters 2 and 3 Christ gave his
[2:34] messages to the seven stars or angels to
[2:37] the seven Gentile churches these angels
[2:39] were seven human preachers that God
[2:42] would anoint with his spirit to preach
[2:43] during the times of the Gentiles which
[2:46] lasted from 53 ad up to the current time
[2:49] Christ's words would give overcoming
[2:52] power to the true believers the New
[2:54] Testament church as they fought against
[2:56] all the forms of Satan's Antichrist
[2:59] religion over the past 2,000 years at
[3:01] the conclusion of this glorious book in
[3:04] chapters 21 and 22 we see these New
[3:07] Testament believers receiving the exact
[3:10] rewards Christ promised them such as the
[3:12] right to the Tree of Life in chapters 4
[3:16] and 5
[3:17] John was taken to the heavenly throne
[3:19] and saw Jesus Christ as the only worthy
[3:22] one who could lose the seven sealed book
[3:24] of redemption in heaven because of his
[3:27] all sufficient sacrifice on the cross of
[3:29] Calvary this proves that the blood of
[3:32] Jesus Christ shed on Calvary is still
[3:34] our only foundation for any spiritual
[3:37] blessing including salvation forgiveness
[3:39] divine healing Bible revelation and any
[3:43] other spiritual blessing in Chapter 6
[3:47] Christ the Lamb opened the first six
[3:50] seals of the book the first four seals
[3:52] revealed Satan's four evil horse riders
[3:54] that would battle the New Testament
[3:56] Bride of Christ trying to defile her and
[3:59] make her lukewarm but we learned that
[4:01] God would use the four living creatures
[4:03] lion ox man and flying eagle to
[4:07] symbolize the holy ghost anointings by
[4:10] which the true Christians would defeat
[4:12] and overcome Satan's devices the fifth
[4:15] seal revealed the spiritual condition
[4:16] and location of the faithful Jews and
[4:19] the sixth seal revealed portions of the
[4:22] destruction during the tribulation
[4:23] period in Chapter 7 John saw the first
[4:27] view of the 144,000 Jews receiving the
[4:31] gospel of Jesus Christ and the
[4:33] you love God or baptism of the Holy
[4:35] Ghost during the Tribulation Period the
[4:38] chapter ends by showing the New
[4:40] Testament church or Bride of Christ
[4:41] already raptured up to heaven and in the
[4:44] midst of worshipping and serving their
[4:47] Lord the Lamb of God Jesus Christ in
[4:51] Chapter eight John saw the seventh and
[4:53] final seal opened which we believe to be
[4:56] the day and hour of the rapture of the
[4:58] New Testament Bride of Christ
[5:00] immediately after the opening of the
[5:02] seventh seal four of the seven trumpets
[5:04] of the Tribulation Period will sound
[5:06] bringing great judgments upon the earth
[5:08] and its inhabitants that miss the
[5:10] rapture in Chapter 9 John saw the
[5:14] sounding of the fifth and sixth trumpets
[5:16] and the passing of the first row which
[5:18] will take place after the rapture and
[5:20] during the Tribulation Period in chapter
[5:24] 10 John saw Christ as a mighty angel
[5:26] come down to earth with the open book of
[5:28] the seven seals mentioned in Revelation
[5:31] chapters four five six and eight and we
[5:34] are shown how God planned to finish all
[5:36] the mysteries of the Bible Christ would
[5:39] come to earth and give the revelation of
[5:40] the Bible to his seventh angel who would
[5:43] be a prophet and then at the end of the
[5:45] chapter John himself was a symbol of the
[5:48] New Testament church who would eat the
[5:50] book or believe and live the true
[5:52] revelation of the Bible and then spread
[5:54] those mystery truths to many peoples and
[5:57] nations and tongues and kings to finish
[6:00] Jesus's Great Commission in order to
[6:02] prepare the bride of Jesus Christ for
[6:05] the rapture in Chapter 11 John saw the
[6:09] Ministry of two witnesses or prophets
[6:11] who had prophesied to the faithful
[6:13] Jewish remnant during the Tribulation
[6:15] Period the passing of the second woe and
[6:18] the seventh trumpet sounding is also
[6:20] seen in the eleventh chapter it is
[6:23] crucial to notice that the New Testament
[6:24] church or Bride of Christ is scarcely
[6:27] mentioned in the chapters that deal with
[6:30] the destructive Tribulation Period which
[6:32] include chapters 8 9 11 12 13 14 15 16
[6:39] 17 and 18 and this is because Jesus
[6:43] Christ will rapture his bride off the
[6:45] earth
[6:45] for the Tribulation Period begins in
[6:49] Chapter 12 John saw a vision of Israel
[6:52] as she was the woman clothed with the
[6:53] Sun who brought forth a man child Jesus
[6:56] Christ whom the great dragon Satan tried
[6:59] to devour but failed this chapter shows
[7:03] how Satan has continually hated God's
[7:05] covenant people Israel attempting to
[7:07] persecute Christ at his birth and also
[7:10] attempting to destroy Israel during the
[7:12] Tribulation Period in chapter 13 john
[7:16] saw the beast out of the sea which was
[7:18] the ancient roman empire get new life in
[7:21] the holy roman empire and then become
[7:23] the beast out of the earth which is the
[7:26] roman catholic church working in the
[7:27] united states of america
[7:29] notice Rome rules the world until the
[7:31] second coming of Jesus Christ
[7:33] just as daniel chapters 2 7 and 8 teach
[7:37] us the order of Gentile kingdoms until
[7:39] the return of Christ which was Babylon
[7:42] Medes and Persians the number of the
[7:46] beast is a number of a man the title
[7:48] once ascribed to the Pope of Rome
[7:50] vicarious filet de which equals 666 in
[7:55] Roman numerals in chapters 14 15 and 16
[8:00] John saw more scenes from the
[8:02] Tribulation Period which included
[8:04] another scene of the Lamb with his
[8:07] 144,000 Jewish saints on Mount Zion the
[8:10] announcements of the three angels and
[8:12] the Battle of Armageddon the last seven
[8:16] plagues the victors over the beast and
[8:18] the pouring out of the seven vials of
[8:21] the wrath of God in Revelation chapters
[8:25] 17 and 18 john saw a beautiful woman
[8:28] that made him wonder with great
[8:30] admiration because she was called the
[8:32] mother of harlots and abominations of
[8:34] the earth these two chapters reveal the
[8:37] identity of this woman who is the real
[8:39] enemy of the true Christian Church the
[8:41] Roman Catholic Church John learned of
[8:44] her evils such as being drunk with the
[8:46] blood of the saints as the Inquisition
[8:49] of the Roman Catholic Church caused many
[8:51] innocent believers to lose their lives
[8:53] then John also foresaw her destruction
[8:56] that comes in one hour of one day
[8:59] the Tribulation Period in chapter 19 we
[9:03] finally see a return to John being shown
[9:06] the new testament church the Bride of
[9:08] Christ after not seeing her during the
[9:11] tribulation chapters of the book of
[9:13] Revelation which included chapters 8 9
[9:15] 11 through 18 heaven literally announced
[9:19] a blessing upon those who are called to
[9:21] the marriage supper of the Lamb this
[9:23] marriage supper of Christ and his New
[9:25] Testament church will take place in
[9:27] heaven while the earth is being judged
[9:29] during the Great Tribulation Period
[9:31] chapter 19 closes by showing Christ's
[9:34] return to the earth after the marriage
[9:36] supper he will come riding a white horse
[9:38] with his army of resurrected Saints to
[9:41] destroy all remaining sinners who took
[9:43] the mark of the beast at what is known
[9:45] as the Battle of Armageddon we must
[9:48] notice that these false Christians
[9:49] suffer the same awful destiny as the
[9:52] false Jews a heaven Jezebel did being
[9:55] eaten by animals because these false
[9:58] Christians had the same evil spirit the
[10:00] spirit of Jezebel that hated the true
[10:03] holy spirit in chapter 20 John finally
[10:07] got to see what would happen after the
[10:09] Tribulation Period and he saw the 1,000
[10:12] year earthly reign of Christ his New
[10:14] Testament church and the faithful Jews
[10:16] this 1000 year millennium of peace is
[10:19] the day of rest that Christ enjoys with
[10:22] his people since Satan had used his
[10:24] sinful tactics to interrupt the seventh
[10:27] day of God's creation in the Garden of
[10:29] Eden at the end of the 1,000 years Satan
[10:32] is loosed and gathers all the nations
[10:34] against Christ and his people but fire
[10:36] from heaven comes down in devour Satan
[10:39] and his earthly followers this chapter
[10:41] ends with a great white throne judgment
[10:44] where the New Testament church sits with
[10:46] Christ upon the judgment throne and all
[10:49] people from all generations including
[10:51] the fallen angels will be judged and
[10:54] given either eternal life or cast into
[10:57] the lake of fire which is the second and
[10:59] final death or separation from God's
[11:02] presence in chapters 21 and 22 John gave
[11:07] us a glimpse of the new heaven and the
[11:09] new earth which includes the City of God
[11:11] the
[11:12] to Jerusalem which will have no sin in
[11:15] its domain as we see the transition from
[11:17] time into eternity john saw a glorious
[11:21] description of the return and full
[11:22] restoration of the holy sinless
[11:25] conditions that were first present in
[11:27] the Garden of Eden one man Christ with
[11:30] his one wife the New Testament church
[11:33] Christians savor Jesus's final commands
[11:36] for faithfulness and his unfailing
[11:38] promises of love to his children such as
[11:41] surely I come quickly this completes our
