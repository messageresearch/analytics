[0:11] greetings friends in the name of Jesus
[0:13] Christ the purpose of this video is to
[0:16] share three prophecies that God gave to
[0:18] his Prophet William brandham one
[0:21] prophecy about the spiritual condition
[0:23] of the United States churches is
[0:25] completely fulfilled and has come to
[0:27] pass the other two Prophecies of about
[0:30] no greater Ministry to the Gentiles and
[0:32] no return of the Christian denominations
[0:35] to the apostolic Ministry have stood
[0:37] true for 53 years and 49 years
[0:46] respectively before we examine these
[0:49] three prophecies we want to share with
[0:51] you that God told us there would be
[0:53] prophets come after Jesus left the Earth
[0:56] some people believe Jesus was the last
[0:58] prophet to the New Testament Church but
[1:00] we believe that's a
[1:01] misunderstanding agabus St John and St
[1:04] Paul are clear examples of prophets who
[1:07] foretold the future after Jesus ascended
[1:10] to Heaven St Paul wrote in Ephesians
[1:13] 48-13 that Jesus sent five preaching
[1:16] gifts to the Earth to help unite and
[1:18] mature the church one of those gifts was
[1:21] the prophet we conclude then that
[1:23] prophets can still be sent today just as
[1:26] pastors and the remaining preaching
[1:28] gifts are still sent by Jesus for the
[1:31] Perfection of the Saints we see agabus
[1:34] prophesying years after Jesus physically
[1:37] left the Earth St John was used to
[1:39] foretell the future by receiving the
[1:41] entire Book of Revelation from Jesus
[1:44] himself nearly 60 years after Jesus
[1:47] ascended St Paul repeatedly prophesied
[1:50] of the end times and warned Believers of
[1:52] the future through his
[1:55] Epistles St Paul also ordained prophecy
[1:58] as a spiritual gift and told Believers
[2:01] to not despise prophecies so the
[2:03] believer today will understand prophecy
[2:06] as a gift God wants to use through
[2:08] Chosen and obedient
[2:11] [Music]
[2:15] men based upon these truths We Believe
[2:18] William brandham was a true Prophet sent
[2:20] by God to forun the second coming of
[2:23] Jesus Christ to the Earth in order for
[2:25] William brandham or anyone else to be
[2:28] considered a genuine prophet numerous
[2:30] conditions must be met the person
[2:32] claiming to be a prophet must live a
[2:34] Godly life of Holiness teach the word of
[2:37] God in its Purity have converts to
[2:40] Christ as a fruit to his ministry reveal
[2:43] secrets from the Bible that were
[2:45] previously hidden or not understood and
[2:48] lastly have the anointing of the Holy
[2:51] Ghost for Supernatural signs and
[2:54] prophecies We Believe William Branda met
[2:56] all of these conditions and this video
[2:58] will focus on three of the prophets phes
[3:00] that William brandham was anointed to
[3:02] speak in the name of the Lord
[3:04] Deuteronomy 18:
[3:06] 20-22 tells us that a true prophet's
[3:09] prophecies spoken in the name of the
[3:11] Lord will come to pass proving God sent
[3:14] him a false prophet's prophecies will
[3:16] not come to pass proving God did not
[3:18] send
[3:20] him now let's look at the three
[3:22] prophecies God gave to William brandom
[3:24] that have either been fulfilled
[3:25] completely or are in the process of
[3:27] being fulfilled prop prophecy number one
[3:31] the immoral condition of the United
[3:32] States
[3:35] churches 49 years ago in 1965 William
[3:39] Brandon prophesied that the Church of
[3:40] the United States would be known for
[3:42] their love of rock and roll and
[3:45] immorality at that time history says
[3:47] that rock and roll itself and musicians
[3:49] like Elvis Presley were denounced by
[3:51] most clergy members but William brandham
[3:53] was given a vision that predicted the
[3:55] churches would soon Embrace rock and
[3:57] roll and other worldly practices let
[3:59] listen to the
[4:01] prophecy and when I seen Miss USA come
[4:06] up I almost
[4:08] fainted now this is thus sayith the
[4:13] Lord and like hoola dancing paint short
[4:17] bobbed hair smoking cigarettes and
[4:20] twisting as it walked to rock and roll
[4:22] and I said is that the Church of the
[4:25] United States and the voice said yes it
[4:28] is
[4:30] almost 50 years ago William brandham saw
[4:32] the immoral condition today's United
[4:34] States churches would be in and
[4:36] correctly prophesied of what God showed
[4:38] him in many churches today their worship
[4:40] Services closely resemble a rock and
[4:42] roll concert due to the popularity and
[4:45] influence of the lucrative business of
[4:46] Christian contemporary music along with
[4:49] that many church members enjoy listening
[4:51] to rock and roll music and do not see it
[4:53] as a sinful act anymore although it used
[4:55] to be considered sinful many church
[4:57] members see no problem singing along in
[4:59] dancing to worldly rock and roll in
[5:01] their homes cars at weddings restaurants
[5:04] and other social
[5:07] Gatherings the second part of the
[5:09] prophecy said that churches in the
[5:11] United States would adopt and accept
[5:12] unbiblical practices that they once
[5:15] recognized as being against the
[5:16] scriptures we will share four of these
[5:18] practices that were prophesied sadly
[5:21] most people are totally unaware that the
[5:23] Bible is against such practices and so
[5:25] our prayer is that the churches and
[5:27] their ministers will return to preaching
[5:29] the Full Gospel El of Jesus Christ we
[5:31] humbly pray Believers will see obedience
[5:33] to these Commandments of God as an act
[5:35] of Love rather than an act of legalism
[5:38] for Jesus said our obedience should be
[5:40] based upon our love for him if you love
[5:42] me keep my
[5:45] Commandments the first practice
[5:47] prophesied of to be widely accepted in
[5:49] churches was smoking cigarettes which
[5:52] defiles the body the Temple of the Holy
[5:54] Ghost breaking the scripture of 1
[5:56] Corinthians 3:17 the Bible also says in
[5:58] 1 Corinthians 6 612 that we should not
[6:01] be brought under the power of any and
[6:03] addictions are clearly a power that bind
[6:04] many people to lust of the flesh the
[6:07] second practice prophesied of was
[6:09] immodest and seductive clothing breaking
[6:12] the Commandment for modesty in 1 Timothy
[6:14] 2:9 the third practice prophesied of was
[6:17] wearing makeup which is against the word
[6:19] of God in 2 Kings 9:30 and Jeremiah 4:30
[6:23] the fourth practice was women cutting or
[6:24] bobbing their hair short which is also
[6:27] contrary to the word of God in 1
[6:28] Corinthians 11
[6:30] 1-6 according to history we have read
[6:32] the presence and love for Rock and Roll
[6:34] Along with immoral practices of smoking
[6:36] cigarettes wearing a modest clothing
[6:39] makeup and bobbed hair were generally
[6:40] unheard of in Bible teaching churches 50
[6:43] years ago based upon this evidence we
[6:45] conclude this prophecy about the
[6:47] condition of the churches in the United
[6:48] States to be
[6:51] fulfilled prophecy number two no greater
[6:54] Ministry to the Gentiles meaning William
[6:57] bram's Ministry from Jesus Christ would
[6:59] be the last sign to the gentile people
[7:02] before the second coming of Jesus
[7:04] [Music]
[7:05] Christ over 50 years ago William
[7:08] brandham repeatedly prophesied that no
[7:10] Ministry would arise to the Gentiles
[7:12] which are non-jews that would be greater
[7:15] than the ministry that Jesus Christ gave
[7:16] to him William brandom said that God
[7:18] told him his ministry was the last sign
[7:21] and the greatest sign to the Gentiles
[7:23] before the second coming of Jesus Christ
[7:25] he also told us that the next great
[7:27] ministry on the earth after his would be
[7:30] that of the two Jewish prophets of
[7:31] Revelation
[7:34] 11 the Bible plainly shows that we're in
[7:37] the last day and the last sign amen I'm
[7:41] fairly young yet I'm 53 years old watch
[7:44] this in the name of the Lord you'll
[7:46] never see nothing
[7:47] greater remember let me tell you thus
[7:52] saith the spirit of God that's on me
[7:55] this is the last sign to the Gentiles
[7:59] Church before the
[8:01] Rapture you're receiving your greatest
[8:04] time in your lifetime before the
[8:06] appearing of
[8:09] CH what made William brandom's Ministry
[8:11] so unique why would the spirit of God
[8:13] make such a bold claim William brandham
[8:16] had a prophetic gift of discernment that
[8:17] could tell people the very thoughts and
[8:19] secrets of their hearts William bram's
[8:21] prophetic gift was the Fulfillment of
[8:23] Luke 17:30 the revealing of the son of
[8:26] man to the Gentiles this prophetic gift
[8:28] was simply the Return of the same gift
[8:31] that the Lord Jesus himself exercised in
[8:33] St John chapter 1 with Peter and
[8:35] Nathaniel and in St John chapter 4 with
[8:38] the Samaritan woman at the well
[8:40] immediately after the Samaritan woman's
[8:41] sinful secret of having six men in her
[8:44] life was revealed by jesus' prophetic
[8:46] gift she knew the gift of a prophet was
[8:48] present with her for she said sir I
[8:51] perceive that thou art a prophet in St
[8:53] John 4:19 later in verse 29 she said
[8:56] come and see a man which told me all the
[8:58] things I ever did is not this the Christ
[9:02] now let's watch as God lets William
[9:03] Brandon manifest the same prophetic gift
[9:06] of discernment that Jesus did this son
[9:08] of man gift in his life will reveal 15
[9:10] secrets to a patient in this particular
[9:13] prayer line from
[9:16] 1954 of course you're
[9:19] safe and you're suffering with the a
[9:23] condition it's a it's a dark Spirit
[9:25] around it's death and it's in a form of
[9:30] cancer and the cancer is located on the
[9:34] breast and you're seeing you're examined
[9:37] by someone strong and it's a you got a a
[9:41] ruptured condition and the rupture is in
[9:44] the
[9:45] bow and you have a stomach trouble also
[9:49] a severe heart trouble that cause you
[9:51] painting of here a few days ago you're
[9:54] setting sideways on the side of a bed
[9:57] and nearly pass out looking towards your
[9:58] window
[10:04] are those things the truth that all true
[10:08] or whatever it was of course it's gone
[10:10] from me but what do you think that was
[10:13] that knows your lifee was it Jesus
[10:16] Christ you accepted to be that yes thank
[10:20] you you're willing you know that
[10:22] something Supernatural is here and if
[10:25] you believe it to be the Lord Jesus as I
[10:27] have preached it out of the word
[10:30] and you believe it to be the Lord Jesus
[10:32] yes I I know there's a dark Spirit if
[10:34] see hanging at you yet it's something
[10:36] very
[10:37] serious say I see
[10:40] you your name is uh Eva yes and your
[10:47] last name is York and you live in this
[10:50] city yes and your house number is 613 6
[10:54] Street is that right you're going home
[10:57] to be well in name of Jesus
[11:01] [Music]
[11:10] CHR the reason we believe this last sign
[11:13] prophecy is in the process of being
[11:15] fulfilled over 50 years later is because
[11:18] no preacher has ever manifested the
[11:19] power of Jesus Christ on or near the
[11:22] same level as the ministry that God gave
[11:24] to William brandham churches today have
[11:26] grown in attendance and finances and
[11:28] preachers have written more books and
[11:29] had worldwide television Ministries but
[11:32] no gift has ever risen that compares to
[11:34] the prophetic son of man gift that God
[11:36] gave to William brandham where is a
[11:38] Gifted Man that can tell strangers their
[11:40] name their address their sickness and
[11:42] many other details of their lives by
[11:44] receiving Visions from Jesus Christ we
[11:46] have not seen a man do this infallibly
[11:49] since William Brandon ministered to
[11:50] God's people the proof of the
[11:52] supernatural power of God in William
[11:55] brandman's Ministry is undeniable as
[11:57] testimonies abound to the supernat
[11:59] natural presence of Jesus Christ doing
[12:01] the same signs wonders and miracles as
[12:04] were recorded in the Bible in its
[12:06] February 1961 issue the Full Gospel
[12:09] men's voice now called the Full Gospel
[12:12] business men's voice wrote The Following
[12:14] in Bible days there were men of God who
[12:16] were prophets and seers but in all
[12:18] sacred records none of these had a
[12:20] greater Ministry than that of William
[12:22] brandham brandom has been used by God In
[12:24] The Name of Jesus to raise the dead so
[12:28] therefore we conclude and firmly believe
[12:30] that the prophecy God spoke 51 years ago
[12:32] is in the process of being
[12:36] fulfilled prophecy number three there
[12:38] will be no return of Christian
[12:40] denominations to the apostolic
[12:44] Ministry in 1965 William Brandon
[12:47] prophesied that denominational churches
[12:49] would never break up their denominations
[12:51] and come back to preaching and living
[12:52] the true word of God their worship would
[12:55] not resemble the book of Acts Church
[12:57] which had Supernatural power gifts of
[12:59] the Spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:01] and Christian
[13:03] Holiness it's predicted that they're
[13:05] going to do it and they're going to do
[13:07] it or it's thus sayith the lord they're
[13:10] going to do it you think them
[13:13] nominations will ever break up their
[13:14] denomination come back to the word it's
[13:16] thus sayith the Lord they
[13:19] won't the reason we know this prophecy
[13:22] is in the process of coming to pass is
[13:24] because in the past 49 years all
[13:26] denominations whether Catholic or
[13:28] Protestant have failed to break up their
[13:29] denominations and denounce their
[13:31] man-made bylaws and traditions of men
[13:34] most denominations have little to no
[13:35] religion that resembles the true church
[13:37] in the book of Acts and the signs that
[13:39] Jesus said would follow True Believers
[13:41] in Mark chapter 16 such as speaking in
[13:44] tongues Healing The Sick and casting out
[13:46] Devils all of these are missing from
[13:47] many
[13:49] congregations in conclusion we believe
[13:52] we have presented enough proof in this
[13:54] short video to make you aware of God's
[13:56] true end time Prophet brother William
[13:59] brandham as the Bible commanded in
[14:01] Deuteronomy 18:
[14:03] 20-22 we have recognized William
[14:05] brandham as a genuine prophet and are
[14:08] now fearing or listening to his
[14:10] bible-based message from God it is not
[14:13] enough to just recognize a prophet of
[14:14] God God wants us to listen to his
[14:17] Prophet for that will help us understand
[14:20] God's words through the help of the Holy
[14:22] Spirit it will help us live what the
[14:24] Bible teaches and love God with all of
[14:27] our heart soul mind and
[14:30] strength will you take some time and
[14:32] listen to the sermons of William
[14:33] brandham we believe that if you do you
[14:36] will hear many inspired truths from
[14:38] God's word that will help you recognize
[14:40] that we are living in the last days and
[14:42] also live a transformed life like God
[14:45] has helped all of us to live we pray you
[14:48] two will recognize God's prophet and
[14:50] then love God with your entire being as
[14:52] we are taught in 2 Chronicles

[14:58] shall shall you be established believe
[15:00] as prophets so shall you
[15:04] prosper if you would like more Bible
