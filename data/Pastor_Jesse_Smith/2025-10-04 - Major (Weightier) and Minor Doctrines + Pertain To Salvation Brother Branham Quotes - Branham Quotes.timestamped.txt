[0:03] Friends, divine healing is just a minor.
[0:07] You can never major on a minor. As I
[0:09] said, salvation of the soul is much
[0:11] greater than divine healing.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the matchless
[0:16] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[0:18] purpose of this video is to look at
[0:20] major and minor doctrines as taught by
[0:23] God's prophet, brother William Marin
[0:25] Brennham. There was two sets of quotes
[0:27] that I studied recently. The first set
[0:30] is quotes that say pertain to salvation.
[0:33] There's only five hits on that. And then
[0:35] I looked at the other set of quotes
[0:37] about brother Ram saying never major on
[0:39] a minor. There's over 20 hits on that by
[0:43] God's grace. This is a very important
[0:45] topic because it involves majors such as
[0:48] salvation and I would say the baptism of
[0:50] the Holy Ghost. It's also important
[0:53] because there's so much tape worship
[0:55] today or brother Brandham worship today
[0:58] around message churches. And so you have
[1:01] one extreme where they only listen to
[1:02] the tapes. The press play and disobey
[1:04] group I call them. Their headquarters is
[1:07] Brandham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville,
[1:09] Indiana. To them everything's a major
[1:12] because they say every word on tape is
[1:14] thus sayith the Lord. That's absolute
[1:16] heresy. But there's also a subtle tape
[1:19] worship by message preachers when they
[1:22] say just believe everything on the tape.
[1:24] I believe all the message.
[1:26] Just say amen to all the message. All
[1:29] these vague blanket statements that
[1:32] basically promote tape worship. So this
[1:34] is a great topic to study here by the
[1:36] grace of God and it's also found in the
[1:38] scripture. So let's start with the
[1:40] biblical foundation here. By the grace
[1:41] of God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the one
[1:44] who taught that there's majors and
[1:46] minors. We find this in Matthew 23:23.
[1:49] I'll be looking down here at my Bible.
[1:51] So says, "Woe unto you scribes and
[1:53] Pharisees, hypocrites, for you pay tithe
[1:55] of mint and annis and cumin and have
[1:59] omitted the weightier matters of the
[2:01] law." So I saw this verse this week and
[2:03] I was just so thankful. So the words
[2:05] major and minor aren't in the Bible
[2:07] regarding salvation, but the word
[2:09] weightier is. So weightier is an
[2:11] equivalent to major. So our Lord Jesus
[2:14] Christ, God in flesh, says there's
[2:16] majors or weightier matters. And Jesus
[2:19] defines them as judgment, mercy, and
[2:22] faith. These ought ye to have done and
[2:25] not to have the other undone. So in this
[2:28] scripture, Jesus is saying tithes are a
[2:31] minor, but you should do the minors as
[2:33] well. But he rebuked the Pharisees for
[2:35] majoring on minors tithes rather than
[2:38] majoring on majors, which were judgment,
[2:41] mercy, and faith. We also see this
[2:43] principle in Matthew 22 the chapter
[2:46] before verses 36-4 about the greatest
[2:49] commandment. Jesus was asked which is
[2:51] the great commandment or greatest
[2:53] commandment. And the Lord Jesus quotes
[2:55] Deuteronomy 6:5. Love the Lord thy God
[2:58] with all thy heart with all thy soul
[3:01] with all thy mind. This is the first and
[3:04] great commandment. And the second is
[3:06] thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
[3:09] So this is the Bible foundation for
[3:10] majors or weightier matters. I think
[3:13] this also applies here in Galatians 5:6.
[3:17] The Bible said faith works by love. So
[3:20] if loving God is the greatest
[3:21] commandment, then we know anyone with
[3:23] faith will do the works of God because
[3:25] of the love of God shed abroad in their
[3:27] hearts as the book of Acts says. So
[3:30] first you receive the love of God in
[3:32] your heart. When you get a heart of
[3:34] flesh and you get saved and God takes
[3:36] away your heart of stone, you get the
[3:39] love of God first. That love motivates
[3:42] your faith and then your faith goes to
[3:44] work by the grace of God. We're not
[3:46] saved by works. We're saved by grace
[3:49] through faith. It is a gift of God lest
[3:52] any man should boast. Next, I'm going to
[3:54] look at Matthew 5:1 19. Jesus said,
[3:57] "Whosoever therefore shall break one of
[4:00] these least commandments and shall teach
[4:02] men, so he shall be called the least in
[4:04] the kingdom of heaven." But notice he's
[4:06] still in the kingdom of heaven. So this
[4:08] is referring to foolish virgins, no
[4:09] doubt. But whosoever shall do and teach
[4:12] them, the same shall be called great in
[4:14] the kingdom of heaven. The scripture
[4:17] opens up the truth about foolish
[4:18] virgins. Brother Ram says in the church
[4:20] age book that they live all that they
[4:22] know or they're God-fearing Christians,
[4:25] but they don't receive more revelation
[4:27] of God. They do not go into the depths
[4:30] of the Holy Spirit. The spirit of God
[4:32] searches the deep things. Yay, the deep
[4:34] things of God. So, this helps us
[4:35] understand why brother Brandon would say
[4:37] Catholics, Baptist, Methodists, Lutheran
[4:39] can all be saved if they're trusting in
[4:40] the blood of Jesus Christ. They can
[4:42] still be saved, but they break some of
[4:45] the least commandments or some of the
[4:47] minor commandments such as tithe paying
[4:49] is a good example. And then if we go to
[4:51] 1 Corinthians 3, I believe it's 14 and
[4:54] 15. You could also actually start up in
[4:56] verse 11 in 1 Corinthians chapter 3 and
[4:58] show how any man who builds upon the
[5:01] foundation of Christ must build the
[5:02] right way. If not, his works can be
[5:04] burned and lost. And the Bible says in
[5:07] verse 14 that his works can be burned
[5:09] but he himself shall be saved. And
[5:12] therefore the man the preacher would not
[5:14] get a reward other than eternal life. So
[5:16] again I'll repeat that preachers or any
[5:18] believer can be saved but miss out on
[5:22] rewards due to them not honoring both
[5:25] the majors and the minor doctrines of
[5:28] the Bible. One of the clearest examples
[5:30] is King Saul in 1st Samuel 13:13. He
[5:33] repeatedly rebelled against obeying the
[5:35] word of God. And the prophet Samuel said
[5:37] that the Lord would have established thy
[5:39] kingdom upon Israel forever if he had
[5:41] just obeyed. So here's a clear example
[5:44] of a believer missing out on rewards.
[5:47] His works were burned and he suffered
[5:49] loss, but he himself was saved. Another
[5:52] good example is Lot. Lot himself was
[5:54] saved, but his wife was lost, right? She
[5:56] turned around and looked back at Sodom
[5:58] and he had other family members that
[5:59] burned in the fires of Sodom cuz God
[6:02] will not destroy the righteous with the
[6:03] wicked. So he had wicked family members
[6:05] and they wouldn't believe his testimony.
[6:07] They wouldn't believe his warning about
[6:08] getting out of the city. So Lot's works
[6:10] were burned, but he himself was saved.
[6:13] King Saul and Lot then missed the major
[6:15] things God was doing in their day. King
[6:17] Saul did not have the judgment of God,
[6:19] the mercy of God, or the faith of God.
[6:22] Nor did Saul have the judgment, mercy,
[6:24] and faith of God. the weightier matters.
[6:27] So they were disobedient on the majors.
[6:30] So they did not keep all the word of
[6:32] God. We can see this also in Galatians 1
[6:35] 6-9. Paul said a man is accursed if he
[6:38] changes one word of the gospel. Now
[6:41] friends, all of us know denominational
[6:43] churches do not keep all the gospel.
[6:45] They change part of it. And yet brother
[6:47] Ram says some of these people can be
[6:48] saved. So this curse could be for the
[6:51] foolish virgins a temporary curse. But
[6:54] for the makeel believers, the Judas of
[6:56] Scare group, it would be a permanent
[6:58] curse or eternal judgment. Not eternal
[7:01] punishment, but eternal judgment. In
[7:04] other words, the sentence upon them as
[7:07] unbelievers would last eternally. They'd
[7:09] eventually be annihilated, as the Bible
[7:11] says. But we get this thought also from
[7:15] King Saul and Lot. And then a third
[7:17] witness is 1 Corinthians 11:30. Paul
[7:20] says there's temporary curses for taking
[7:22] the communion unworthily. He says many
[7:25] are weak and sickly among you because
[7:27] they did not examine themselves nor do
[7:29] they treat the body of Christ the right
[7:31] way. And brother Ram says that word
[7:33] curse. Brother Ram says this is a
[7:35] temporary curse. So here we see that
[7:38] temporary curses would fall on the
[7:40] foolish virgin who break the least of
[7:42] the commands and sometimes some of the
[7:44] major commands as well such as judgment,
[7:47] mercy and faith. Another verse is
[7:49] Philippians 1:15-18.
[7:52] Paul's writing from prison to the
[7:53] Philippians, but he says he rejoiced
[7:56] that Christ was being preached whether
[7:57] in pretense or not. So to me, I take
[8:00] this as a verse that relates to the
[8:03] foolish virgin. Brother Ram would say
[8:05] God can use Abraham in a dollar way, but
[8:07] Lot in a penny way. So we have these
[8:09] believers, these foolish virgins sitting
[8:11] out in denominational churches, but
[8:13] brother Ram says, "At least they're not
[8:14] in the bar. At least they're not at the
[8:16] prostitute house." And God can use a
[8:18] penny in a penny way. So I rejoice that
[8:21] Christ is preached in the Catholic
[8:23] church. Although I know very few will
[8:25] find salvation there. I rejoice that
[8:27] he's preached in the Lutheran,
[8:29] Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal,
[8:31] Presbyterian churches, but I know very
[8:33] few will be saved there. As Jesus said
[8:36] in Matthew chapter 7, few there be that
[8:38] find the narrow road that leads to life.
[8:40] Then the Bible says in 1st Peter 4:17-19
[8:43] that some people the righteous will be
[8:45] scarcely saved and righteous is the
[8:48] foolish virgin. We find that Revelation
[8:50] 22:11 we have the unjust that never
[8:52] believed the filthy Judas the scar group
[8:55] that sold out the gospel. You have the
[8:57] righteous which are the foolish virgin.
[8:59] And fourthly you have the holy group the
[9:01] wise virgin those who are baptized with
[9:03] the Holy Ghost. So, back to 1st Peter
[9:05] 4:17-19. Judgment begins at the house of
[9:08] God. And there'll be some that are
[9:10] scarcely saved. Just like King Saul,
[9:13] just like Lot, they're just barely
[9:15] saved. No real reward. They're just
[9:18] given the inheritance of eternal life.
[9:20] Also want to teach that heresies are
[9:23] major sins. 1 Corinthians 11:19 says,
[9:26] "Heres happen to make manifest those who
[9:29] are approved of God and no doubt those
[9:31] who are off the word of God." So, I've
[9:34] said it many times. The tape, church
[9:35] movement, press play and disobey, they
[9:37] are off the word of God. They're in
[9:39] heresy because they're exalting every
[9:41] word on Brother Ram's tapes to being
[9:43] equal to the Bible. They're essentially
[9:45] adding to the Bible. They're making
[9:47] Brother Random equal to God, which is
[9:50] wicked, sinful. It's an abomination.
[9:53] It's heresy. Brother Brandham said, "To
[9:55] make him infallible is Tommy Rot." I
[9:58] played that quote many times. If you
[10:00] need the quote, just let me know. In
[10:02] Galatians 5:20 and 21, the Bible lists
[10:06] heresies as one of the sins that do not
[10:08] inherit the kingdom of God. They're in
[10:10] the same group as murderers, adulterers,
[10:12] fornicators. So being a heretic in the
[10:15] sight of God is the same as being an
[10:17] adulterer or murderer.
[10:20] And that's why, friends, brother Ram
[10:21] would say so many times, we never want
[10:23] to major on a minor. These people go too
[10:26] far on extremes of exalting the tapes or
[10:29] exalting sensations, as we'll see here
[10:31] in a little bit. exalting experiences
[10:33] far above the word of God. It's very
[10:36] important that we emphasize the majors.
[10:38] Yes, we must keep the minors, but we
[10:40] must emphasize the majors. Titus 3:9-11
[10:44] says, "A heretic is condemned of
[10:46] himself." So, it's that heretic's own
[10:49] sin that condemns him. Now, maybe not
[10:52] eternally if they can repent, but
[10:54] they're teaching the heresy in their own
[10:56] unbelief, their own sin. They've allowed
[10:59] themselves to get caught in the snare of
[11:00] the devil. And lastly, second Peter 2:es
[11:03] 1 and 2, Peter said, "False prophets
[11:06] bring in damnable heresies, even denying
[11:09] the Lord or the word that bought them,
[11:12] and many shall follow their pernitious
[11:14] or destructive ways." Brother Ram uses
[11:17] this scripture in chapter nine of the
[11:18] church age book to say, "In every case,
[11:21] you'll notice a false prophet is one who
[11:23] is outside the word."
[11:25] So that's why the tape church tape
[11:28] worship movement pressed plain obey
[11:29] movement is so dangerous. It's outside
[11:31] the word of God. They're literally
[11:33] adding all the sermons from 47-65
[11:37] to the word of God. They're making that
[11:39] equal to the word of God. That's outside
[11:41] the word. The Bible says in Revelation
[11:44] 22:18 and 19, you cannot add one word or
[11:47] take one word away. It's as simple as
[11:49] looking at the 1977 prediction brother
[11:52] Brandon made. That's not in the Bible.
[11:54] So it's not thus sayeth the Lord.
[11:55] Brother Ram said numerous times it was
[11:57] not the Lord that told him that it was
[11:59] his own prediction. But if you say you
[12:01] believe every word on tape from 47 to 65
[12:04] with thus sayith the Lord, you've just
[12:06] made that equal to the Bible. That's
[12:09] damnable heresy. Brother Ram said they
[12:11] are false prophets. For a true prophet
[12:13] will always lead one to the word and
[12:16] bind the people to Jesus Christ. And he
[12:18] won't tell the people to fear him or
[12:20] what he says, but fear what the word
[12:22] says. You won't find all these 24 lies
[12:25] from Brandham Tabernacle in the word of
[12:27] God as I have a series on that. The 24
[12:29] plus lies coming out of Brandham
[12:31] Tabernacle. And brother Brandham said
[12:33] that repeatedly. He could not add one
[12:35] word nor take one word away from the
[12:37] word of God. Now let's get into some of
[12:39] these quotes here. By God's grace, I
[12:41] just made a little list here. Now I
[12:43] basically got three quotes that talk
[12:44] about majors that are identified major
[12:47] doctrines or major topics. The first one
[12:50] is 1956. Hear ye him. Brother Ram says,
[12:53] "Salvation and born again are majors."
[12:57] Now, I believe at this point, Brother
[12:58] Ram thinks they're one and the same, but
[12:59] later on after 1963, after the seals are
[13:02] open, he realizes they're different
[13:04] things. Salvation is justification, the
[13:06] first step of grace. Being born again is
[13:08] the third work of grace. So, Brother Bam
[13:11] said, "Salvation of the soul is much
[13:12] greater than divine healing." Then he
[13:14] says in the next paragraph, when you're
[13:16] born again, you get an immortal spirit
[13:18] that cannot die. So again, we see the
[13:20] difference between divine healing. You
[13:22] get healed in the body, but your body
[13:23] will eventually die. If you get healed
[13:25] in the soul, your soul will never die.
[13:27] Let's listen to the quote.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; Friends, divine healing is just a minor.
[13:33] You can never major on a minor. As I
[13:35] said, salvation of the soul is much
[13:37] greater than divine healing. Divine
[13:40] healing was included in the new new
[13:42] atonement because the old atonement had
[13:44] healing in it and the new ones are much
[13:46] better see than the old. If the old one
[13:48] refers healing, what about the new one?
[13:51] But divine healing is not on the same
[13:52] basis as salvation. When you're born
[13:55] again, you get an immortal spirit that
[13:58] cannot die. But when you're healed by
[14:01] divine healing, you will get sick and
[14:03] die again. Lazarus did and all the rest
[14:05] of them even raised from the dead. But
[14:07] it's the attributes of his resurrection.
[14:10] And it's the earnest of our resurrection
[14:12] that we will see. God said so. Now it's
[14:16] in the Bible.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Second, the church age book. Right at
[14:20] the beginning in the introduction,
[14:22] brother Ram said, "This volume will
[14:24] concern itself with various major
[14:25] doctrines such as the Godhead, water
[14:28] baptism, etc." Though this volume will
[14:31] concern itself with various major
[14:33] doctrines such as the Godhead, water
[14:36] baptism, etc. found in Revelation
[14:38] chapters 1 through3, its main theme is
[14:41] the setting forth of a detailed study of
[14:43] the seven church ages. So now we see the
[14:46] godhead is included as a major doctrine
[14:49] and water baptism. Now we also have to
[14:52] remember that brother Random said
[14:54] trinitarians can be saved right after he
[14:56] said thus sayith the Lord.
[14:57] Trinitarianism is of the devil. And then
[14:59] he says all the way up to the end of his
[15:00] life that he believed people could be
[15:03] saved in denominational churches. He
[15:06] said trinitarians can be saved as long
[15:08] as they're trusting in the word. He said
[15:10] they don't have to believe everything
[15:12] that he taught. He said if they reject
[15:14] what he taught about the baptism of the
[15:15] Holy Ghost then they'll surely go in the
[15:18] tribulation period but they can still be
[15:19] saved because the word has already been
[15:21] judged. Brother Ram said that in
[15:23] questions Answers 1964 part one. Let's
[15:25] listen to the quote.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; What about the people that believe in
[15:29] the Lord now and don't and not the way
[15:33] you preach? They don't have to believe
[15:35] this. They don't have to believe the way
[15:37] I preach it. See, don't have to believe
[15:39] that. For the last day message will they
[15:42] be saved? Yes, if they believe the Lord.
[15:46] See, and if they they disagree and say,
[15:48] "I don't believe he's the word. I don't
[15:49] believe it this is right. I don't
[15:50] believe in the baptism of the Holy
[15:51] Ghost." That shows where they're headed
[15:53] for the tribulation period. But those
[15:55] who can accept the word in its fullness,
[15:57] not me preaching it because it's a Bible
[16:00] says so.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; Those who accept that is free because it
[16:03] the word's already been judged. The
[16:05] third and final quote where we can
[16:07] identify major doctrines is again the
[16:10] identified Christ of all ages. 1964
[16:12] brother Ram said the main thing is
[16:14] divine healing of the soul. And brother
[16:17] Ram told us how divine healing of the
[16:19] body became a major. He said there's
[16:23] been so much self glory in it that it's
[16:26] given a bad taste before the public. He
[16:29] said it's been bless the Lord brother so
[16:30] and so laid hands on me and praise the
[16:32] Lord I got healed. Now if I could just
[16:35] omit that. So brother Ram said people
[16:36] started exalting the preachers who
[16:39] prayed for them rather than the Lord
[16:40] Jesus. He said if somebody could say the
[16:43] Lord Jesus made me well how much better
[16:45] that would be. You see brother Ram said
[16:47] we don't heal the people they're already
[16:49] healed. How many believes that? Let's
[16:51] listen to the quote.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; So the Bible is perfectly true and
[16:54] that's what we stand on the Bible. It
[16:57] must be thus sayaeth the Lord. Uh we do
[17:00] believe that God can do things that's
[17:02] not written in this word because he's
[17:04] God. He does whatever he wishes. But yet
[17:08] I like to see anything when it comes in
[17:10] the line of a doctrine come out of the
[17:11] Bible. Amen.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Because I believe that the Bible is the
[17:15] full revelation of Jesus Christ. The
[17:17] Bible said that's what it is. It is the
[17:19] revelation of Jesus Christ. Nothing is
[17:22] to be added to it or anything taken from
[17:24] it. So I like to stay right into what it
[17:27] says and what it promises. If he just do
[17:29] what he promised, that's all I care to
[17:31] see anyhow. And I know I'll see him
[17:34] &gt;&gt; now. That's right.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; In this, we do not try to say we major
[17:39] in divine healing because divine healing
[17:41] is a minor. And you can never major on a
[17:44] minor. But about 86% I think it's
[17:48] estimated of Jesus ministry was on
[17:50] divine healing. He, as Dr. Bossworth
[17:53] used to say my one of my associates that
[17:55] just went to glory last few years about
[17:58] being about 84 years old. He said divine
[18:00] healing is a bait that's on a fish hook
[18:03] and you never show the fish the hook.
[18:05] You show him the bait. So he takes the
[18:07] bait and gets the hook. So that's that's
[18:09] what it is. We want to catch the fish
[18:11] for the Lord's glory. Catch them out of
[18:13] the world and bring them into the
[18:15] kingdom of God. And so divine healing,
[18:19] the main thing is divine healing of the
[18:21] soul. the body of Christ. It needs
[18:24] healing worse than anything that I know
[18:25] of is the body of Christ. It's been so
[18:28] broken up by man's theology and
[18:31] denominational differences until it's a
[18:33] sick body. And I and I tell you it it's
[18:37] needs healing, great healing. So I I
[18:40] trust that the Lord will do a great
[18:42] thing towards the healing of his part of
[18:43] the body that's in here. We believe that
[18:46] there is one one church
[18:49] &gt;&gt; and we never join it.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; Next Monday I'll be 55 years old and the
[18:55] Brandon family never did ask me to join
[18:56] their family. I was born to that's how I
[19:00] am. That's how we're Christians. We were
[19:03] born a Christian and you don't join it.
[19:06] You're born into it.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Then you take the character of Christ.
[19:11] There's been so much in this last day of
[19:13] people who preaching divine healing has
[19:15] put so much self glory in it
[19:18] &gt;&gt; that it's given a bad taste before the
[19:20] public.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; It's been bless the Lord brother so and
[19:25] so laid hands on me and praise the Lord
[19:27] I got healed. Now if I could just omit
[19:29] that if somebody could say the Lord
[19:31] Jesus made me well. How much better that
[19:33] would be. You see? So with the little
[19:36] ministry that the Lord has given me is
[19:38] trying to bring him into your presence
[19:41] that you would lay your hands on him,
[19:44] your sacrifice, and be healed. It isn't
[19:46] so much of laying hands, which we do. We
[19:49] all we pray and lay hands on the sick.
[19:51] We don't heal the people. They're
[19:53] already healed. Every person is already
[19:56] healed. How many believe that? Now,
[19:58] let's see how our congregation's been
[20:00] taught. It's twothirds of them believes
[20:01] it. him now um that he was wounded for
[20:05] our transgressions.
[20:07] With his stripes we were healed. Every
[20:12] attribute that he died for at Calvary is
[20:16] ours from that time on.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; Everything that he died for, he was
[20:21] wounded for our transgressions, bruised
[20:23] for our iniquity, chastised our peace
[20:25] upon him. With his stripes we were
[20:26] healed. We were healed. Past tense.
[20:29] Every sinner is saved. From the day that
[20:33] Jesus died on the cross, he forgave
[20:35] every sin of man.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at the minor section.
[20:39] There's a lot more topics that are
[20:41] called minors by brother Brandham. The
[20:43] first one is divine healing 54. Brother
[20:45] Bram said, "Shouting, speaking in
[20:46] tongues do not pertain to salvation. You
[20:49] can have that and live a bad life."
[20:51] Let's listen to the quote.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Peter said, "Repent and be baptized
[20:54] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[20:55] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[20:57] the Holy Ghost." And here we have people
[20:59] up the altar tearing for this and
[21:00] tearing for that. When that make God's
[21:02] word a non effect.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:07] &gt;&gt; God's got to take care of his word.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; And the minute you meet his requirement,
[21:12] God will answer his word that quick.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's there to wait for it.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. But you see people saying, "Oh,
[21:20] unless we shout or unless we speak with
[21:21] tongues, unless we dance in the spirit."
[21:23] All those things are all right. They're
[21:25] all right. But they have nothing to do
[21:26] pertaining to salvation. No,
[21:28] &gt;&gt; they're not a thing.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Cuz as soon as you repent of your sins,
[21:31] if truly God's convicted you and you've
[21:33] repented and been baptized in Jesus
[21:35] Christ name, God's under obligation to
[21:37] give you the Holy Spirit right then.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Right. Because his word said so.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; And he can't. There's nothing on God's
[21:44] part. It's your part.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Because people's been mistaugh.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; Each time we come along, get a little
[21:49] something started. We say, "This is it.
[21:51] This is it." Oh my. It isn't these
[21:54] fleshed demonstrations. They're
[21:55] attributes of the Holy Spirit, but
[21:57] receive the Holy Spirit is to receive a
[21:58] person, Christ.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; Then these other things take place in
[22:02] the life.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; We've seen people shout and live all
[22:05] kinds of life. We've seen people speak
[22:07] in tongues, do the same. We've seen
[22:08] people go out and pray for the sick to
[22:10] be healed and do live any kind of a
[22:11] life. Jesus said, "Many will come to me
[22:13] and say, Lord, have not I prophesied in
[22:14] your name?" Preach. Have not I cast out
[22:17] devils in your name? Yes. Have not I
[22:19] done these mighty works? Yes. He say,
[22:21] "Well, then depart from me, you workers
[22:24] of iniquity. I didn't even know you."
[22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Next, in 1958, the evidence of the
[22:30] resurrection, Brother Ram said,
[22:31] "Emotion, dancing, shouting, tongues,
[22:34] divine healing are all minors." Yet
[22:37] today, there are some message churches
[22:38] that will major on this. They'll major
[22:40] on experiences. Yet, I believe in
[22:43] experiences. Brother Brandon believed in
[22:44] experiences. But we got to be so careful
[22:47] not to major on a minor. And in the
[22:49] quote, brother Ram says, "We need divine
[22:51] healing of the soul, a breaking up.
[22:53] Souls on fire for God on fire down at
[22:56] the altar, tears running down their
[22:58] cheeks, but out trying to win the lost
[23:00] back to Christ again, a burden on their
[23:02] heart." Let's listen to the quote.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; But today, you can preach repentance and
[23:07] hell firing brimstone and people are
[23:10] laugh at it.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; What's the matter? Our hearts are cold.
[23:17] Yeah,
[23:17] &gt;&gt; we're indifferent. We got too much.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; We need less of the world and more of
[23:25] God.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; Our hearts are too cold.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; We become interested in some emotion. We
[23:35] become interested if if we can dance, if
[23:38] we can shout, I believe in it.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; If we can speak with tongues, I believe
[23:42] in it.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; I believe in every bit of that. But if
[23:46] we have that and don't have that
[23:49] agonizing,
[23:51] &gt;&gt; weeping, broke up spirit, God can never
[23:55] use it.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; Now things are good.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; But we got to have the other to go with
[24:03] it.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; We've left off the main thing and gone
[24:08] for a secondary.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; And you can never major on a minor.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; We know that.
[24:15] Even in our own meetings, our own
[24:18] meetings has got too much to the place
[24:21] that's too much on divine healing
[24:24] instead of healing of the soul.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Brother, what we need today is a
[24:28] revival,
[24:30] &gt;&gt; a breaking up.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Souls
[24:35] on fire for God.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; What I mean on fire is down at the altar
[24:40] with tears running down their cheeks.
[24:42] Not for five minutes and get up and
[24:43] forget it.
[24:45] without trying to win the lost back to
[24:47] Christ again.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; A burden on their heart.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; God take all the pleasures of the world
[24:54] and all of its fringes,
[24:57] all of its products, and put a burden on
[25:00] my heart for the lost to be my prayer.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Next, this may surprise some, but
[25:06] brother Random called communion a minor.
[25:09] Brother Ram said, "Comunion does not
[25:10] pertain to salvation. It does not give
[25:12] you salvation. It's a commemoration. So,
[25:15] we know communion is important. It's a
[25:17] minor and if you don't do it right,
[25:20] there's a temporary curse that comes
[25:22] along with it as we said in 1
[25:23] Corinthians 11:30. But, Brother Ram
[25:25] says, "Comunion does not save you."
[25:27] Let's listen to the quote.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; Now, the communion
[25:32] is not a is not given for the purpose
[25:36] that many people think it is.
[25:40] It's t taught by a certain denomination
[25:42] of church that communion is called the
[25:46] last right
[25:48] that it pertains to salvation.
[25:52] Communion does not pertain to salvation.
[25:57] Communion does not give you salvation.
[26:00] Whether you take it in your death or or
[26:02] what it does not have nothing to do with
[26:05] your salvation.
[26:08] It is a commemoration.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus said and the gospel he said this
[26:15] do in remembrance of me.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Not it leading or pointing to salvation
[26:24] but it's in commemoration of a finished
[26:28] work.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; That's been done in you
[26:33] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a commemoration.
[26:38] Now, there's many that take the
[26:40] communion is not saved.
[26:44] Many eat the Pascal lamb and perish in
[26:48] the wilderness.
[26:51] And many take the communion today
[26:54] that will never see God.
[26:57] But you cannot be a partaker of his
[27:00] salvation and not see him
[27:04] &gt;&gt; because salvation is the gift of God.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; And communion is commemoration of the
[27:12] great also sacrifice that was made for
[27:16] that salvation.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:20] It's to let people see that we believe
[27:23] in the death, burial, and resurrection
[27:27] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; God,
[27:30] &gt;&gt; it represents the finished work.
[27:34] Salvation once was not completed and the
[27:38] offering of the goats, the sheep, the
[27:42] heers in the Old Testament because the
[27:45] Old Testament blood could not atone for
[27:48] sin. It could only cover sin. It was
[27:52] appointing to a time when it would be
[27:55] completed. Tomorrow night we're to get
[27:58] right in on that.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; But it was only a type. But when Jesus
[28:04] came and his blood was shed at Calvary,
[28:08] it was a complete divorcing of sin.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; It taken sin away. It's the only means
[28:17] of salvation.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; There is no church joining, no letters
[28:23] of fellowship.
[28:25] There is no ritual baptism. There's no
[28:29] communion art, nothing in the ritual or
[28:33] any article that's been left of God as
[28:36] articles pertain to salvation. It's all
[28:39] in commemoration of a finished work.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; Next, Brother Random says in life 1957,
[28:47] oil in the hands, seeing rainbows, other
[28:50] sensations do not pertain to salvation.
[28:53] Let's listen to the quote. Everywhere
[28:55] the Pentecostal has turned me down
[28:57] because I won't accept the evidence of
[28:59] the Holy Ghost as blood run out of your
[29:01] hands and oral run out of your hands and
[29:02] things like that and seeing uh rainbows
[29:06] and all those things. Sensations does
[29:08] not pertain to salvation. Not at all. We
[29:11] come solemnly by faith. We believe God
[29:14] and that's it. See, and so they wrote
[29:17] letters ahead into Canada and the
[29:19] Pentecostal just simply stepped aside
[29:21] like that. But uh would not have no
[29:23] cooperation or nothing to do in the
[29:24] meeting because I wouldn't accept that.
[29:26] And so I still no matter who accepts it
[29:30] or what does it, I stay with the blessed
[29:32] old Bible. Amen. This is God's word. We
[29:35] have to stand alone. We'll stand alone.
[29:37] Build a church.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Now before we approach his uh his uh
[29:43] word, let's just
[29:46] &gt;&gt; now look at a few other different quotes
[29:47] here that are helpful. This quote is
[29:50] from how can I overcome 63. Brother
[29:51] Brham's talking about he disagreed with
[29:53] another minister about the coming of the
[29:55] Lord. The minister disagreed with
[29:57] brother Brandham who believed that the
[30:00] church is raptured before the
[30:02] tribulation.
[30:03] Brother Brham said I can't agree with
[30:04] him because I don't see it but it
[30:06] doesn't pertain to salvation. It's
[30:08] pertaining to the coming of the Lord. So
[30:10] it seems to brother Brandham that the
[30:12] coming of the Lord did not pertain to
[30:14] salvation. So whether you believe the
[30:15] rapture is pre-tribulation, in the
[30:17] tribulation, or post-tribulation,
[30:19] brother Ram said that doesn't make you
[30:21] saved or lost. Let's listen to the
[30:23] quote.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; But I I can't agree with him because I
[30:27] don't see it. But the it doesn't pertain
[30:30] to salvation. It's pertaining to the
[30:32] coming of the Lord. He sees that the
[30:35] church has to go through the tribulation
[30:37] period for purification.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; I say the blood of Jesus Christ purifies
[30:42] the church. Amen.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; It needs No, I believe that the church
[30:47] goes through the tribulation period.
[30:49] Church organization.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; But the bride does not.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; Would you choose a woman you had to
[30:55] purify before you married her?
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Christ's bride is chosen
[31:03] &gt;&gt; and she is elected.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; And she's God's bride,
[31:09] a bride of Jesus Christ. This next quote
[31:12] is very helpful. God keeps his word part
[31:14] two 1957. Brother Ram said salvation is
[31:17] based on the Bible not upon the amount
[31:20] of prayer nor on your sincerity. Cuz
[31:23] brother Ram brings up other religions.
[31:24] How Muslims pray more than Christians
[31:27] and how Buddhists can have experiences
[31:29] and be so sincere. But brother Ram said
[31:32] salvation does not pertain or is not
[31:34] based upon any other thing but the word
[31:37] of God. God's got to say so. Brother Ram
[31:41] said he wants our soul experience based
[31:44] on God's word so that it will stand.
[31:47] Let's listen to the quote.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Now, we cannot base salvation upon
[31:52] prayer.
[31:54] As good as it may be, we cannot base
[31:58] salvation on prayer.
[32:01] For if that be so, the Mohamads are
[32:04] saved,
[32:06] &gt;&gt; the Buddhas are saved, the heathens are
[32:09] saved.
[32:11] So it cannot be based on prayer
[32:17] and neither can it be based upon
[32:19] experience.
[32:22] Salvation is not based on experience
[32:26] because people can have any kind of an
[32:29] experience.
[32:31] The Mohamads have experiences,
[32:34] the Buddhist has an experience,
[32:37] and every different religion has
[32:40] experiences.
[32:43] And neither can salvation be based upon
[32:49] fasting,
[32:50] prayer,
[32:52] experiences,
[32:54] sensations,
[32:56] or sincerity.
[32:59] Many people say, "Well, it doesn't make
[33:01] any difference just what I believe as
[33:05] long as I am sincere in what I believe."
[33:10] Well, if that be so, the Mohamad is
[33:13] saved, the Buddha is saved,
[33:17] and all the rest of them, the heathens
[33:20] are saved.
[33:22] Or I say that they can outshine us any
[33:26] day.
[33:28] when it comes to prayer, fasting,
[33:30] sensations or so forth, they can
[33:33] outshine us.
[33:35] And salvation does not pertain or it is
[33:38] not based upon
[33:41] any other thing but the word of God.
[33:44] God's got to say so.
[33:48] Salvation cannot be based upon
[33:51] um
[33:52] any church
[33:55] or any creed.
[33:58] Nothing but the word of God.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; For it's God's word.
[34:05] God's word is so perfect
[34:08] that not one iot of it will ever fail.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; All the heavens will fail. the earth
[34:16] will fail. John said in the on the eye
[34:20] of Patmas, I saw a new heaven and a new
[34:24] earth, for the first heaven and the
[34:27] first earth had passed away. God's word
[34:30] went right on just the same. All the
[34:34] word of God has to be fulfilled.
[34:38] Every word.
[34:40] So that's the reason I like to get
[34:42] people that I know I'm going to have to
[34:46] answer before in the day of judgment
[34:50] based not upon some of my own thoughts
[34:55] or based upon my own doctrine.
[34:59] I want their soul experience and all
[35:02] based on God's word
[35:07] so that it will stand
[35:10] because I know that in that great day
[35:13] we're going to have to answer for
[35:15] everything.
[35:17] In closing, friends, hope this video was
[35:20] a blessing by the grace of God. Over the
[35:22] years, I made numerous videos on many
[35:25] topics, and sometimes people get really
[35:27] upset with me. But I've always
[35:29] appreciated the brethren who could
[35:31] recognize the difference between majors
[35:33] and minors. Brother Ram said, "It's okay
[35:34] if we disagree on the minors, but we
[35:36] definitely want to agree on the majors."
[35:38] Heresies, of course, are majors. So, we
[35:41] have to warn people about heresies. And
[35:43] the main thing we want to do is get
[35:45] people saved by the grace of God. Get
[35:47] them baptized with the Holy Ghost in
[35:49] their soul. Help them see the revelation
[35:51] of the Godhead, the true water baptism
[35:53] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[35:55] want their souls to have divine healing
[35:58] by the grace of God. We want their souls
[35:59] quickened. We want their souls sealed
[36:01] unto the day of redemption. And I think
[36:03] I'll end with this quote from questions
[36:05] and answers on the seal 63. I've shared
[36:07] this a couple times recently. Brother
[36:09] Bram's answering questions during this
[36:12] week of the seven seals. And he said,
[36:14] "If you have a different interpretation
[36:15] and believe your idea of it's right,
[36:17] just go ahead. Just go right ahead. that
[36:20] won't hurt because there's not only but
[36:22] about one or two of them that pertains
[36:24] to anything to salvation. He said most
[36:27] of the questions are asked on the other
[36:28] side of the rapture of the church. Now
[36:31] friends, I find this such a striking
[36:33] statement because brother was so kind
[36:34] and gracious to anyone who disagreed
[36:36] with him. And he says it won't hurt if
[36:38] you disagree with something he taught on
[36:40] the other side of the rapture. So many
[36:43] message believers are not that gracious
[36:45] today. And that's very sad. But
[36:47] hopefully this video is helpful in
[36:48] identifying majors and minors by the
[36:51] grace of God. Let's listen to the quote
[36:53] from God's prophet.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; And so now these questions are really
[36:58] nice. I appreciate and the wisdom and
[37:01] things that people use. Now for the
[37:03] first one, now I'll try to answer them
[37:05] and then if if I don't get it right,
[37:06] will you you forgive me then? And if you
[37:09] have a different interpretation and
[37:10] believe it your idea of it's right, just
[37:13] go right ahead. that won't hurt because
[37:15] there's not only about one or two of
[37:17] them that pertains anything to
[37:18] salvation. It's only most of the
[37:20] questions is asked on this other side of
[37:22] the trip uh on the rapture of the
[37:25] church. So see it's questions over here
[37:27] which is to come and will come to pass
[37:29] over in the other parts because we're
[37:31] now beyond the church age in our
[37:33] teachings in the book. We're beyond over
[37:36] in a time of the calling of the 144,000.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; So friends, let's do what Jesus said.
[37:41] Let's do the weightier matters of the
[37:43] scripture, judgment, mercy, and faith.
[37:46] And let's do the other as well. Let's
[37:49] not leave the other minors undone. As
[37:52] Jesus said in John 16:13, "The Holy
[37:54] Ghost will guide us into all truth. The
[37:56] truth of the majors, truth of the
[37:58] minors."
[38:00] If you have any questions, concerns, or
[38:02] testimonies about this video, please
[38:03] contact me.
[38:05] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[38:08] the desire of your heart.
[38:11] I'm very happy to be here this afternoon
[38:13] and again in defense of the gospel of
[38:15] Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings,
[38:18] the good news that Jesus raised from the
[38:20] dead, living among man today, his
[38:22] church. The same Jesus that was
[38:25] yesterday will be today and forever
[38:29] is never failed.
