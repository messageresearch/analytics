[0:03] So, I just listen to what they say and
[0:04] say, "Amen." Go on. Because they're
[0:07] they're a man of God. I follow them. I
[0:08] find they're in the Bible and tell the
[0:10] truth.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the matchless
[0:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[0:16] purpose of this video is to show a quote
[0:18] from God's prophet, Brother William
[0:20] Brham, [music] from 1959, where he
[0:22] supports the five-fold ministry. This
[0:25] quote is closely related to the previous
[0:27] video I made [music] which is called
[0:30] pastors have a higher office than
[0:32] brother Brandham. And of course those
[0:34] are brother Brandham's own words not my
[0:36] words. And so in that video, by the
[0:38] grace of God, we rightly divided the
[0:40] word of truth to show that the pastor
[0:42] has the highest office in the local
[0:44] church only. But the highest office of
[0:47] the five-fold ministry is the apostle
[0:50] and the highest office for revelation of
[0:52] the word of God is the prophet.
[0:55] So let's look at this quote from 1959.
[0:57] It's November 29th. Let us see God, San
[1:00] Jose, California. Brother Random is
[1:02] ending the service with a prayer line
[1:05] and discernment. He said, "Now I cannot
[1:07] heal. Healing is already purchased by
[1:08] the Holy Spirit." How many knows that
[1:10] Christ did it on Calvary? The only thing
[1:13] that maybe these men here, their
[1:15] ministers, they could take the word of
[1:18] God. And I wouldn't I'd be darent to
[1:21] stand before them with the word of God
[1:23] and anything contrary.
[1:25] &gt;&gt; Now, I cannot heal. Healing is already
[1:30] purchased by the Holy Spirit. How many
[1:32] knows that Christ did it on Calvary? The
[1:35] only thing that maybe these men here,
[1:39] they're ministers. They could take the
[1:41] word of God. I wouldn't I'd be darcing
[1:43] to stand before him with the word of God
[1:44] and anything contrary because they're
[1:47] called, that's their office.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; So, this is the first statement I want
[1:50] to look at. I hope everybody caught
[1:52] that. Brother Random said, I'd be daring
[1:55] to stand before them with the word of
[1:57] God. I'd be daring to stand before him
[2:00] with the word of God and anything
[2:01] contrary.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; So look how humble brother Brandham is
[2:03] to the local five-fold ministry and
[2:05] especially pastors, evangelists, and
[2:07] teachers because brother Bram will say
[2:09] later, he has a prophetic gift. Brother
[2:11] Bram said, in other words, I dare not
[2:14] stand before these ministers. Now that's
[2:16] totally opposite of tape worshippers.
[2:19] Tape worshippers will say, how dare you
[2:21] try to correct Brother Brandham? How
[2:23] dare you try to rightly divide the word
[2:25] of truth? So again, the tape boys are
[2:28] completely opposite of brother Brandham.
[2:30] Brother Brham said, "I would dare not
[2:32] stand before the local pastors,
[2:34] evangelists, and teachers because they
[2:37] have separate gifts. They have different
[2:39] gifts than my prophetic gift." So that's
[2:41] the first point, and it's a powerful
[2:43] point. I wonder what the tape boys would
[2:45] say about that. Brother Brandham would
[2:47] dare not stand before the local
[2:49] five-fold ministry preachers. Moving on
[2:52] the quote, he said, "Because they're
[2:54] called, that's their office. They preach
[2:57] &gt;&gt; because they're called, that's their
[2:59] office.
[3:01] They preach."
[3:03] &gt;&gt; So again, Brother Bram's emphasizing,
[3:04] these are local pastors, local
[3:07] evangelists and teachers, and they have
[3:09] the office to do the preaching and
[3:10] teaching to the local assemblies. And
[3:13] brother Ram says, he goes on to say,
[3:15] they know what they're talking about.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; They know what they're talking about.
[3:20] Now, second, let's look at what brother
[3:21] Random says next. This is powerful. So,
[3:24] I just listen to what they say and say
[3:27] amen and go on because they're they're
[3:31] men of God.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; So, I just listen to what they say and
[3:34] say, "Amen." Go on. Cuz they're they're
[3:37] men of God.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; So, that's the second point. Brother
[3:40] Random says, "I just listen and say
[3:43] amen."
[3:44] Brother Ram did not say, "I just demand
[3:46] to take my pulpits back and I demand to
[3:49] put the prophet back in the pulpit and
[3:51] let all the preachers say amen to me."
[3:54] That's what Brandham Tabernacle says
[3:55] today. Brandham Tabernacle is lying
[3:58] today. They're not saying what Brother
[4:00] Brandham said. Brother Brandham said, "I
[4:02] just let them preach. They know what
[4:04] they're talking about. I just say amen
[4:07] because they're men of God."
[4:10] So Brandham Tabernacle says only say
[4:12] amen to brother Brandham not living
[4:13] preachers but brother Brandham says I
[4:15] say amen to the living preachers. So who
[4:18] are we going to follow? Brother Brandham
[4:20] or the current Brandom Tabernacle. We're
[4:22] going to follow God's prophet brother
[4:23] Brandham. We believe the quotes by God's
[4:26] grace. And third he says I follow them.
[4:30] I find they're in the Bible and tell the
[4:32] truth.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; They're a man of God. I follow them. I
[4:35] find they're in the Bible and tell the
[4:36] truth. So thirdly, brother Brandham said
[4:39] he followed the five-fold ministry. But
[4:41] yet Brandham Tabernacle says, "Brother
[4:43] Brandham's a leader of the five-fold
[4:45] ministry. Everyone should say amen to
[4:47] him and all the preachers should be
[4:48] quiet, stop preaching, neglect their
[4:50] gifts, sit down, and just press play and
[4:53] follow Brother Brandham." Yet look how
[4:55] humble brother Brandham was in the local
[4:57] ministry setting. He said, "I follow
[4:59] them. I just sit down, say, "Amen, and
[5:03] listen to what they say. I follow them."
[5:06] That's a true prophet of God who would
[5:08] not undermine the authority of the local
[5:11] churches. And then brother Ram goes on
[5:13] to say, "Well, now I'm not much to
[5:15] preach, but my gift is the gift of
[5:17] seeing." So again, he's differentiating
[5:18] between prophets and then pastors,
[5:21] evangelists, and teachers. He said,
[5:23] "Jesus was a preacher. He was also a
[5:25] seer. And now my part being that I have
[5:27] not education enough to preach, but I
[5:29] have a gift to foresee things, tells
[5:31] forth and foretells."
[5:34] Well, now I'm not much to preach. But my
[5:37] gift is a gift of seeing.
[5:42] That's a Jesus was a preacher. He also
[5:45] was a seer.
[5:47] And on my part, being I have not
[5:49] education enough to preach. But I have a
[5:52] gift to foresee things tells forth and
[5:56] foretell.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; So again, a super powerful quote from
[6:00] God's prophet supporting the five-fold
[6:03] ministry. not degrading it, not
[6:04] neglecting it, not claiming that he was
[6:06] the only important one to hear in the
[6:08] five-fold ministry. So again, the
[6:10] thumbnail of this video is just my
[6:12] imagination. What would an honest tape
[6:14] boy look like if he was sitting in his
[6:17] church just pressing play and he heard
[6:19] this? I think he'd be shocked if he had
[6:21] a conscience and it was not numbed. If
[6:24] he had a clean Holy Ghost conscience, he
[6:26] would be shocked to hear brother Ram say
[6:28] he did not dare stand before the local
[6:31] preachers, teachers, and evangelists.
[6:33] And he just said amen to them and
[6:36] followed them. Of course, this goes
[6:38] along with brother Ram's quote from 64
[6:40] questions and answers. He says, "I'm
[6:42] just one pebble on the beach."
[6:44] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham, is it true that
[6:47] no one should preach but you?
[6:51] We have seen
[6:54] your
[6:55] We have seen you ordained man. We do
[7:00] don't believe you would do that if there
[7:03] were not if they were not to preach.
[7:07] Mercy, brother, sister, ever who told
[7:10] you nobody's preached for me, I'd sure
[7:12] subjects of God with all that. No. Every
[7:16] man or that feels a call of God upon his
[7:19] life, get into the ministry, start
[7:21] preaching. We need them. Man of God are
[7:25] anointed all over the world to preach
[7:26] the gospel. See, I'm just one little
[7:29] pebble on the beach among many big
[7:32] stones. See, so uh there just many more
[7:36] eligible, more worthy, more of anything
[7:39] to preach than me. I'm just one little
[7:42] humble person laying out ear. I'm one
[7:45] grain of wheat and a whole garner. See,
[7:48] so it's just, you know what I mean? Any
[7:51] man that's called of God needs to preach
[7:53] the gospel. How can a Christian get
[7:55] deeper in the love of God? Read the word
[7:58] and pray. Read the word of God and pray.
[8:02] And friends, if anyone is honest who
[8:04] listens to brother Random regularly,
[8:06] they will find Brother Random supporting
[8:07] the five-fold ministry many times. I'm
[8:10] just going to give four quick examples.
[8:12] First, in May of 1960, Brother Ram said
[8:15] he loved Orman Neville's sermons. He
[8:18] never said, "I love when Brother Neville
[8:20] sits down and just presses play and obey
[8:22] and gives me back the pulpit."
[8:25] &gt;&gt; I tell you the reason I'd love to hear
[8:27] Brother Neville speak. I tell you the
[8:30] reason I love to hear brother Neville
[8:32] speak.
[8:34] Not mainly because he's a good preacher,
[8:38] but because I know that he lives what he
[8:41] preaches.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; And I would rather you would live me a
[8:45] sermon than preach me one.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; It'll be more effective.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Our our precious brother is is one
[8:54] unselfish
[8:55] man is is brother Neville. And if any of
[8:59] you here last Sunday and heard that
[9:01] marvelous message that he brought on the
[9:03] cruel,
[9:05] it was out one of the most outstanding
[9:08] message I ever heard.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; Was what brother Neville brought by the
[9:12] Holy Spirit last Sunday to this little
[9:15] herd of sheep that God has gathered
[9:17] together. Second, in 1963 July, Brother
[9:21] Ram said he got 20 sermons from
[9:23] listening to Lee Vale preach at Brennham
[9:26] Tabernacle and said, "I couldn't say
[9:28] nothing to make it any better." Look how
[9:30] humble that is. And I think Levale got
[9:33] off the word of God greatly as he got
[9:36] older. But that's just my humble
[9:37] opinion. But while Levale was alive,
[9:39] Brother Ram said he couldn't say nothing
[9:41] to make it any better. Yet the tape boys
[9:44] will say there's no greater preacher
[9:45] than Brother Brandham. Nobody could
[9:47] preach a sermon as good as brother
[9:48] Brandham. Yep. Brother Brandham said
[9:49] leave sermon was so good he could not
[9:51] make it any better.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; So much was said
[9:55] I couldn't say nothing to make it any
[9:58] better.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; And I truly believe that it was the Lord
[10:02] that worked this out for brother Veil to
[10:05] bring this man.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; After this morning.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. So do
[10:08] &gt;&gt; you see it has to work that way. We we
[10:11] accept that from God.
[10:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:13] &gt;&gt; There's so many things he was saying. I
[10:15] I I'd have 20 sermons. Go down your what
[10:18] he said.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; So, who's telling the truth? Who's
[10:21] lying? Of course, the Brandham
[10:23] Tabernacle is lying. We want to tell the
[10:25] truth. We want to be honest and say what
[10:26] the tapes actually say, not twist them
[10:29] to promote 24 false doctrines coming out
[10:32] of Brandham Tabernacle.
[10:34] Third, in July 1965, Brother Ram said he
[10:37] felt led of the Holy Spirit to listen to
[10:39] Brother Neville in the morning service
[10:41] of his last Sunday preaching at Brennham
[10:44] Tabernacle. See how the Holy Ghost led
[10:46] the prophet to submit to the pastor in
[10:48] the local assembly. And brother Ram was
[10:50] so grateful he did that cuz he felt the
[10:53] sermon was important to hear from
[10:54] brother Neville. Brother Ram never said,
[10:56] "Just sit down, brother Neville. It's my
[10:59] pulpit. Put me back in the pulpit." No.
[11:02] Brother Brandon was a holy ghostfilled
[11:03] gentleman.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; I thank you this morning. I wanted to
[11:07] hear brother Neville myself and I heard
[11:09] him many times and never heard him
[11:11] anytime. But what I appreciate but this
[11:13] morning that timely message. I know I
[11:15] had the leading of the Lord to listen to
[11:17] that this morning. I know I had the
[11:19] leading of the Lord to listen to that
[11:21] this morning. Very fine. And I see why
[11:24] you people like to come and listen to
[11:26] him. Also listen to that mighty message
[11:29] this morning on uh brother Neville
[11:31] brought us about I thought it was so
[11:34] wonderful how he said there a doctor
[11:36] will diagnose a case but the man that
[11:38] comes with a handful of needles he gives
[11:40] the injection.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; And last but not least in November 1965
[11:45] brother Ram said he didn't want to take
[11:47] Pastor Perry Green's time in what house
[11:50] will you build me in Tucson Arizona? I
[11:53] don't want to take brother Green's time
[11:55] here because I heard brother Green
[11:57] several times speak and I certainly was
[12:00] influenced I don't want to take brother
[12:02] Green's time here because I heard
[12:05] brother Green several times speak and I
[12:07] certainly was influenced.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; This is so important to see how Brother
[12:11] Rem didn't want to take the pastor's
[12:13] time. So he kept his comments short
[12:16] before he prayed and ordained brother
[12:18] Perry Green as the pastor of Tucson
[12:20] Tabernacle. And even in this quote,
[12:22] Brother Ram said, "This is my church."
[12:24] So, Brother Ram's home church at the end
[12:26] of his life was the Tucson Tabernacle.
[12:28] That's what the tapes say. I'm just
[12:30] saying what the tapes say. Now, this
[12:32] they need Sunday school teachers.
[12:34] They're going to need a stand.
[12:37] And I want to say this so that you'll
[12:40] thoroughly understand.
[12:43] This is my church.
[12:47] I've been here 3 years.
[12:50] This is my church.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; And brother Ram pleaded with them,
[12:54] attend every service. Brother Ram never
[12:56] said, sit at home and press play. He
[12:59] said, attend every service. And now that
[13:01] brother Green, God has sent him in here
[13:03] and opened us up a church of like
[13:06] precious faith that we believe. We are
[13:08] to be very grateful to God. We can't
[13:11] ever service take every place that we
[13:14] can. We can't ever service take every
[13:18] place that we can.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; And yet Brandham tabernacle leaders, I
[13:22] have the recordings. They've listened to
[13:24] this and what they get out of this
[13:26] sermon of what house will you build me
[13:28] and say, "Why don't we put Brother
[13:30] Brandham back in the pulpit so they can
[13:32] listen to a sermon and get a different
[13:34] interpretation?" because they're not
[13:36] gifted to rightly divide the word of
[13:38] truth. And they've got an evil spirit
[13:40] that causes them to hear what the evil
[13:42] spirit says, not what the Holy Ghost
[13:44] says. But brother Ram said, "I don't
[13:46] want to take your time, Pastor Perry
[13:48] Green. I want the pastor to be anointed
[13:51] by the Holy Ghost to give the message to
[13:53] the local church." I don't want to take
[13:55] brother Green's time here because I
[13:58] heard brother Green several times speak
[13:59] and I certainly was influenced
[14:03] and can every service take every place
[14:06] that we can and if we're asked to call
[14:10] on to pray to seek to do let's be
[14:14] soldiers not at the just anxious to do
[14:16] it.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; If you have any questions, concerns or
[14:19] testimonies about this video please
[14:20] contact me.
[14:23] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[14:25] the [music] desire of your heart.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[14:30] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[14:32] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[14:36] good news that Jesus raised from the
[14:37] dead, living among man today, his
[14:40] church. [music] The same Jesus that was
[14:42] yesterday will be today and forever
[14:46] is never failed.
