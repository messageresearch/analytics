[0:03] there he is with them angels of message
[0:05] which was the seven breaking of them
[0:07] Seven Seals that reveal serpent seed and
[0:09] all these things here the breaking of
[0:11] them Seven Seals that reveal serpent
[0:13] seed the breaking of them Seven Seals
[0:15] that reveal serpent
[0:17] seed greetings friends in the matchless
[0:19] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:22] purpose of this video is to share a
[0:23] revelation the Lord Jesus I believe
[0:26] revealed to me personally on this topic
[0:28] of the serpent seed and the Seven Seals
[0:32] so for years I've wondered why brother
[0:33] brandom said the breaking of them Seven
[0:36] Seals that revealed the serpent seed and
[0:39] all these things
[0:41] here and just a few weeks ago I felt the
[0:44] Lord Jesus gave me the
[0:46] Revelation but first friends I'm Jesse
[0:48] Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship
[0:50] here in akan Ohio USA and we're
[0:53] celebrating our 18th anniversary this
[0:56] weekend actually by God's grace and also
[0:58] by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00] CHR I defend the true Gospel of the Lord
[1:02] Jesus Christ that the Lord Jesus
[1:04] revealed to St Paul and then had to
[1:06] restore through the prophet William
[1:08] Marian brandham 1909 to
[1:11] 1965 also defend brother Ram's Godly
[1:13] Christian character so here's a brief
[1:15] outline for the video first we'll begin
[1:17] with the origin of this video which
[1:20] includes a quote from brother brandham
[1:23] from ashamed
[1:25] 1965 then secondly we'll look at how
[1:27] serpent seed is a part of the Seven
[1:30] Seals actually found in Revelation 5
[1:33] then third and finally we'll look at
[1:34] other doctrines and revelations in the
[1:37] Seven Seals that help tie the entire
[1:39] Bible together by the grace of the Lord
[1:42] so first let's look at the origin here
[1:45] years ago perhaps maybe 10 years or more
[1:47] I was listening to ashamed it's July 11
[1:50] 1965 sermon from Brother Brenham and he
[1:53] said this he said the message which was
[1:56] the seven breaking of them Seven Seals
[1:59] that revealed serpent seed and all these
[2:01] things
[2:02] here so that always puzzled me for all
[2:05] these years and I kind of set this quote
[2:06] up on the Shelf because I always thought
[2:08] why did Brother ROM say serpent seed was
[2:11] revealed in the Seven Seals and in my
[2:13] heart mind I'd studied the Seven Seals
[2:16] basically Revelation chap 6 and then the
[2:18] beginning of Revelation 8 and I never
[2:20] saw anything about the serpent seed in
[2:22] there so let's listen to the quote by
[2:24] God's grace there he is with them angels
[2:27] of message which was the seven breaking
[2:29] of them Seven Seals that reveals serpent
[2:31] seed and all these things here and it
[2:33] shows that it is his very covering his
[2:36] it's his supreme authority am he is
[2:39] supreme and he's wigged or or covered
[2:42] the Bible said that he changed his
[2:44] countenance or he changed himself
[2:47] immor so this statement was on the Shelf
[2:50] in my mind for many years how the
[2:52] serpent SE was revealed in the Seven
[2:55] Seals and then I've been doing this
[2:56] preaching series recently on this
[2:58] message song I Just Want to Thank You
[3:00] Lord for letting me hear your word and
[3:02] as some of you know the first verse says
[3:04] then I heard recognizing your day
[3:06] serpent seed perfect Faith the breach
[3:08] and the message of Grace Lord I Thank
[3:10] thee so I finished preaching through
[3:12] recognizing your day serpent seed
[3:14] perfect faith and I was listening to the
[3:15] breach and it was through listening that
[3:17] sermon that the Revelation came by God's
[3:20] grace so now let's go to the second part
[3:22] let's look at serpent seed in the Seven
[3:25] Seals and here is what I believe is the
[3:27] revelation of how the serpent seed is is
[3:30] in the Seven Seals I believe serpent
[3:33] seed is clearly understood if you read
[3:35] between the lines of Revelation 5 as
[3:37] brother Bram said sometimes as
[3:39] Christians we have to read between the
[3:40] lines for Revelation and so I'd always
[3:43] thought brother Brandon meant the
[3:44] serpent seed was in Revelation 6 or the
[3:47] first two verses of Revelation chap 8
[3:50] and of course Revelation chap 6 lists
[3:52] the first six seals but then while
[3:55] listening to the breach between the
[3:56] seven Church ages and the Seven Seals I
[3:59] heard brother say that anyone that
[4:02] couldn't see it was adultery there is
[4:06] totally blind because every man that was
[4:08] born was born of a woman and of course
[4:11] brother BR was referring to Revelation
[4:13] 5: 4 and 5 no man was found worthy to
[4:17] open and read the book neither look
[4:19] thereon and one of the elders saith unto
[4:21] me weep not behold the ly of the tribe
[4:23] of Judah the root of David has prevailed
[4:24] to open the book and to loose the Seven
[4:26] Seals thereof so here was the revelation
[4:30] why was Jesus worthy to look at the book
[4:32] and then loose the seals of the book
[4:34] because he never sinned and he was the
[4:36] only virgin born man so this is what we
[4:39] mean by read between the lines if you
[4:40] read Revelation 54 and 5 no man is
[4:44] worthy that's because all men were
[4:45] either born in sin shape in iniquity
[4:48] come to the world speaking lies as Psalm
[4:51] and job says or Adam and Eve weren't
[4:54] born of women but they were the original
[4:56] ones who sinned and broke the word of
[4:57] God so Adam and Eve could not be worthy
[5:00] to take the book either it had to be the
[5:02] Virgin born son of God none other than
[5:04] our Lord Jesus Christ so let's just in
[5:07] this brief quote there's about three
[5:08] paragraphs here from the breach let's
[5:10] listen to the quote now how could we be
[5:16] when every man that's born has to and
[5:18] anybody couldn't see it was a sex act
[5:20] there he's totally
[5:23] blind cuz every man that was born was
[5:26] born of a
[5:28] woman and God required a kinsman
[5:32] redeemer and he must be a
[5:36] human oh my what he going to do now law
[5:41] required a kinsman
[5:43] redeemer I couldn't take an angel you
[5:46] had to have a man CU we're not kin to
[5:49] the angel we're kin to one
[5:52] another the angel never fail he's a
[5:55] different kind of being got a different
[5:57] body he never sinned or nothing he's a
[6:00] different but the law required a kinsman
[6:03] redeemer and every man on Earth was born
[6:07] of a
[6:09] sex I don't you see that's where it come
[6:12] from that's where sin
[6:14] started amen so you see where it's at
[6:17] now there comes your seat of the serpent
[6:21] in so as soon as I heard this quote I
[6:23] was meditating on this and then the
[6:25] Revelation came that's where serpent
[6:27] seed is in the Seven Seals it's in the
[6:29] chapter before the Seven Seals
[6:31] Revelation CH 5 and it just made me so
[6:34] joyful I just rejoiced and I thought my
[6:37] all these years I've waited to
[6:39] understand this and I finally understand
[6:40] that this took place about two weeks ago
[6:42] on the drive to church on a Sunday
[6:44] morning with my eight children in the
[6:45] back of the van and I'm holding my
[6:47] wife's hand as we're driving along and
[6:48] there the Revelation strikes
[6:51] me and of course this ties in with the
[6:54] rest of the Bible the Bible says in
[6:56] Proverbs 30:20 an adulterous woman edth
[6:59] wipeth her mouth and saith I've done no
[7:01] wickedness so here we see the symbolism
[7:04] of an adulterous woman eating and wiping
[7:06] her mouth and that's of course what the
[7:09] Book of Genesis tells us the symbolism
[7:11] of Eve eating a fruit but it was
[7:13] actually adultery because all the
[7:15] consequences were in her
[7:17] reproduction so because she received the
[7:19] wrong seed the seed of the serpent God
[7:21] had to give her consequences when she
[7:23] brought forth seed as a reminder of what
[7:26] Eve did at the beginning and also second
[7:29] second Peter 1:4 the Bible said having
[7:31] escaped the corruption that is in the
[7:32] world through lust so we can see
[7:35] corruption start in the Gard of Eden
[7:38] came by lust but Redemption came by
[7:41] virginity Mary was of course a virgin
[7:44] conceived Jesus of the Holy Ghost of
[7:47] course so Redemption came by the seed of
[7:49] the woman corruption came by the seed of
[7:51] the serpent notice friends it took a
[7:54] virgin born man to break the Seven Seals
[7:57] so this means Redemption could only come
[7:59] by a virgin birth and of course this
[8:02] proves corruption came by adultery so
[8:05] here we see this proof of the serpent
[8:08] seed being the Seven Seals is also the
[8:09] fourth out of the nine evidences of the
[8:11] serpent seed at least those are the nine
[8:14] that I've compiled there could be more
[8:15] of course but here's a screenshot of
[8:17] them the evidence number four is the
[8:19] serpent seed explains the purpose of the
[8:20] Virgin birth of Jesus so this is why
[8:23] Jesus had to be born virgin birth
[8:26] because sin entered the world through
[8:28] lust or adultery between the serpent and
[8:31] Eve not Satan and Eve The Serpent and
[8:34] Eve so you can pause the video if you
[8:36] want to read through the rest of those
[8:38] nine evidences of the serpent seed of
[8:40] course I have videos about that and I
[8:41] wrote a chapter about that as well my 12
[8:44] New Testament Mysteries book revealed
[8:45] from
[8:48] 2021 now in the third section I want to
[8:50] show seven other doctrines or
[8:51] Revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[8:53] because brother Ram said the Seven Seals
[8:55] tied the loose ends together and what
[8:57] brother R meant was all the mysterious
[8:59] ious doctrines of the Bible that have
[9:01] been mysterious for over 2,000 years God
[9:03] used brother Ram to finish the mystery
[9:04] of God Revelation 10:7 and tie all those
[9:08] Mysteries together now everything makes
[9:10] sense in the Bible for the Holy Ghost
[9:12] filled wise virgin the Bride of Jesus
[9:14] Christ let's listen to the quote six
[9:17] months before it happened we told you by
[9:19] the Holy Spirit I would be going there
[9:21] to pick up the news because the pyramid
[9:24] riding on the outside as a brother had
[9:26] the dream I interpret it to you that's
[9:28] the entire interpretation
[9:30] now all the mysteries of justification
[9:32] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost is
[9:34] done explained now picking up the Loose
[9:36] Ends of that which is concealed in the
[9:38] Seven Seals not the seven churches the
[9:41] Seven Seals reveal the Mysteries and
[9:43] then he opened this thing up the top and
[9:46] found a rock in there white but it never
[9:49] been rode
[9:50] on now let's go through these seven
[9:52] other doctrines of Revelations in the
[9:54] order of appearance so the first one
[9:56] actually in Revelation 5 is the godhead
[9:59] in Revelation 5: 5-7 we see the lamb
[10:03] who's also called a lion comes forth and
[10:05] takes the book and notice he's called
[10:08] the line of the tribe of Judah the root
[10:10] of David and so if he's the root of
[10:12] David and he's still alive of course
[10:13] that has to be God it can't be a natural
[10:15] man so we see the godhead is represented
[10:18] here and God became flesh and dwelt
[10:20] Among Us and of course Jesus Christ was
[10:22] born of the lineage of David we know
[10:25] that but it was God manifesting himself
[10:27] in the flesh as 1 Timothy 3:16 Says so
[10:32] notice in Revelation 5 5-7 this can only
[10:35] be the one true God it cannot be a
[10:37] second person of the Trinity because
[10:39] there's no such thing as the second
[10:40] person of the Trinity the father is the
[10:42] invisible spirit so God is only one
[10:45] person the Bible never says God is two
[10:47] persons three persons or more persons
[10:50] it's one person who manifests himself in
[10:52] many ways but in relation to Salvation
[10:55] he's manifest in three ways father son
[10:57] Holy Ghost remember friends God can have
[10:59] an infinite number of manifestations by
[11:02] his word like on the day of Pentecost he
[11:04] broke up into 120 pillars of fire or
[11:07] licks of fire so God can do whatever he
[11:10] wants he'll never break his word he'll
[11:12] never change his character and just like
[11:14] at Jesus baptism you have the voice from
[11:16] Heaven the spirit like a dove and Jesus
[11:18] the human body in the water that's not
[11:20] three persons that's three
[11:23] manifestations and you can of course
[11:24] prove this I love to prove this by the
[11:26] book of Isaiah Isaiah 4311 says I even
[11:29] and I am the Lord and beside me there's
[11:30] no savior so as trinitarians who is this
[11:33] speaking of which savior if this is
[11:35] Jesus well then God the father is not a
[11:37] savior neither is the Holy Ghost a
[11:39] savior but of course God the father is a
[11:41] savior of course the holy spirit is a
[11:43] savior because it's the one and
[11:45] self-same person Isaiah
[11:48] 44:6 God said I am the first and the
[11:50] last and remember of course Revelation
[11:52] 1:1 Jesus says I'm Alpha and Omega the
[11:54] first and the last Revelation 1:17 fear
[11:57] not I'm first and the last
[11:59] Revelation 28 these things sayith the
[12:02] first and the last Revelation 2213 I am
[12:05] Alpha and Omega the beginning the end
[12:06] the first and the last so the same Lord
[12:09] God speaking through Isaiah is God
[12:12] Almighty and he manifested himself in a
[12:14] body called Jesus Christ of Nazareth one
[12:17] person the same person changing his form
[12:20] God in Morp changing his mask one God
[12:24] manifest In the Flesh Isaiah 448 says is
[12:28] there a god beside me yay there is no
[12:30] God I know not any so God doesn't say
[12:32] well there's another person beside me or
[12:34] there's a third person or second person
[12:36] beside me God never says that Isaiah 45
[12:39] 5-7 says I am the lord and there is none
[12:42] else there's no God beside me there is
[12:45] none beside me in verse 6 I am the lord
[12:47] and there is none else I the Lord do all
[12:50] these things I form the light create
[12:51] darkness of course the Bible says in
[12:53] Ephesians God created All Things by
[12:55] Jesus Christ that represents the
[12:57] invisible Spirit created All Things by
[12:59] by the spoken word or the logos or the
[13:01] visible form of the Holy Ghost not three
[13:04] persons but another
[13:07] manifestation Isaiah 45:21 and22 the
[13:10] Bible said there is no God else beside
[13:13] me a just God and a savior there is none
[13:15] beside me so there's only one savior
[13:19] verse 22 says for I am God and there is
[13:21] none else and I love Isaiah 44:24 as
[13:25] well I am the Lord that maketh all
[13:27] things that stretches forth the heaven
[13:29] alone so which person stretched forth
[13:31] the heavens was it the first person
[13:33] second person or third person there's
[13:36] only one person it was God Almighty and
[13:39] he stretched forth the heavens when he
[13:41] stretched it by his word he was creating
[13:42] or stretching the heavens by Jesus
[13:44] Christ because Jesus Christ is the word
[13:46] of God John 1:1 so the first of these
[13:50] seven other Revelations is godhead of
[13:53] course this includes the water baptism
[13:54] water baptism should only be performed
[13:56] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:59] according to five examples in the book
[14:00] of Acts no one is ever baptized in the
[14:02] titles Father Son and Holy Ghost the
[14:05] second Revelation is the four Beast we
[14:07] see that in the first four seals in
[14:09] Revelation chap 6 they're also seen of
[14:11] course in Revelation 4 but brother Ram
[14:13] said thus sayith the Lord these four
[14:15] beasts are the anointings on the church
[14:16] for the seven Church ages and so because
[14:19] we have that revelation of the Beast we
[14:21] also have the revelation of the seven
[14:22] Church Ages which is called a a mystery
[14:24] in Revelation chap 1 and then brother
[14:27] Ram gave us the revelation of the church
[14:28] ages he said with thus sayeth the Lord
[14:30] he said the history plus the church ages
[14:32] plus the seals plus the Visions he said
[14:35] to the best of my understanding it's
[14:36] thus sayith the Lord let's listen to
[14:37] that quote from the sth seal
[14:40] 1963 Now The Vision Plus the word plus
[14:44] the history plus the church ages and all
[14:46] blend together so I could truly say that
[14:51] to the best of my understanding and
[14:53] according to the word of God and the
[14:55] vision and the Revelation the
[14:58] interpretation thereof is thus sayith
[15:00] the
[15:02] Lord the third Revelation is the mystery
[15:04] of iniquity we see this in the first
[15:06] seal Revelation 6: 1 and 2 The Mystery
[15:09] of iniquity is the white horse rider who
[15:12] is the Antichrist spirit and of course
[15:14] the for seal reveals the name of this
[15:16] white horse rider it's death and of
[15:19] course 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 speaks
[15:21] of the mystery of iniquity it's the
[15:23] Antichrist spirit so the Seven Seals and
[15:26] the Revelation Jesus gave to brother
[15:28] Bram gives us that third Revelation
[15:30] there the fourth Revelation is powerful
[15:32] it's in the third seal of Revelation
[15:35] chapter 6 and it speaks of the oil and
[15:37] the wine of course this is the baptism
[15:38] of the Holy Ghost oil it's the holy
[15:41] ghost in the soul and wine is
[15:42] stimulation of
[15:44] Revelation now we see oil is the Holy
[15:46] Ghost in Zechariah 4: 6 and:
[15:50] 12-4 the oil is called the anointing and
[15:53] it's also called my spirit not by might
[15:56] not by power but by my spirit sayith the
[15:58] Lord and then if you tie John 7: 37-39
[16:02] in with this you'll see how the Holy
[16:04] Ghost could not be given till Jesus was
[16:06] glorified and that must mean in the soul
[16:08] because in the Old Testament the Saints
[16:10] could have the Holy Ghost on their flesh
[16:12] bodies and also their minds to see
[16:14] visions and of course prophesy like all
[16:16] the Old Testament prophets did but it
[16:18] can never get down to the soul that was
[16:20] saved for the New Testament and also
[16:23] there's another Revelation in there
[16:26] where there's a voice in the midst of
[16:28] the four beasts of course that's the
[16:29] godhead brother Ram tells us that's the
[16:31] voice of God that says touch not the oil
[16:34] and the wine hurt not the oil and the
[16:35] wine so notice there's only one voice
[16:37] not three voices there's only one voice
[16:39] in the midst of the four beasts because
[16:41] there's only one Throne there's only one
[16:44] God there's only one person in the
[16:45] godhead the fifth Revelation is Israel's
[16:48] blindness seen in the fifth seal
[16:49] Revelation 6: 9-11 this is a beautiful
[16:53] Revelation brother Ram tells us blinded
[16:55] Israelites can still be saved as long as
[16:57] they're trusting in the word of God or
[16:58] the old Old Testament or they're obeying
[17:00] the law as close as they possibly can we
[17:02] see this is true also in the entire
[17:04] chapter of Romans 11 and the entire
[17:06] chapters of Ephesians chapters 2 and 3
[17:09] and I have entire chapter of course on
[17:11] this in my 2021 book the sixth
[17:13] Revelation is Daniel 70 weeks we see
[17:16] this in the six seal of Revelation 6: 12
[17:20] to the end of the chapter this is
[17:22] because the six seal is called the
[17:23] Judgment seal and of course the Judgment
[17:25] seal or the Judgment time is the
[17:27] seven-year Great Tribulation period I
[17:29] have a video about Daniel 70 weeks I'll
[17:31] leave a link in the description for that
[17:34] so during this six seal or tribulation
[17:36] seal we see the two Jewish Prophets The
[17:38] Rise and Fall the Antichrist and then
[17:41] this also ties in the mother harlot's
[17:43] temporary rule with the 10 Kings and
[17:46] then the 10 Kings turn on the mother
[17:47] Harlot and then the total Destruction of
[17:50] the mother harlot in Revelation 18 and
[17:53] also because of Daniel 70 weeks we see
[17:55] the Everlasting righteousness brought in
[17:57] and of course that speaks of the
[17:59] Millennium so the six seal brings us
[18:01] Daniel 70 weeks the mother Harlot
[18:03] Revelation and also the Millennium and
[18:06] the seventh and final Revelation is
[18:08] actually the seventh seal from
[18:09] revelation 8: 1-2 of course brother Ram
[18:12] tells us this is the rapture this is the
[18:14] second coming of Jesus Christ the secret
[18:16] sudden coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[18:18] to snatch away his Gentile bride away
[18:21] before the Great Tribulation period we
[18:23] know this is an unknown day and hour
[18:26] according to Matthew 24:36
[18:28] it's called a mystery in 1 Corinthians
[18:31] 15: 51- 54 and it's also described as a
[18:34] meeting in the air in 1 Thessalonians 4:
[18:38] 16-1 17 of course I have numerous videos
[18:40] about the Rapture I'll leave a link to
[18:42] those in the description I also wrote an
[18:43] entire chapter about it as well in my
[18:45] 2021
[18:48] book in closing friends hope this video
[18:51] was a blessing again I was so stirred up
[18:53] by the
[18:54] Revelation that serpent seed was in the
[18:56] Seven Seals it was in Revelation 5
[18:59] I'll leave a link to that sermon in the
[19:01] description as well I just thought I'd
[19:03] share with the Saints this is one thing
[19:05] I love about being a message believer
[19:06] the Bible keeps opening up more and more
[19:08] as time goes on you know God has given
[19:10] my brother Simon a few wonderful
[19:13] revelations in these last few months and
[19:15] so I felt like this was a personal
[19:16] revelation to me given of course by the
[19:19] holy spirit because it lines up with the
[19:20] word of God God sent it through a
[19:22] prophet brother brandham and so I
[19:24] rejoice in the continual Revelation you
[19:27] know we must be in the spirit on the
[19:28] Lord Lord's day as Revelation 1 says and
[19:30] we must be in the spirit of Revelation
[19:32] as St Paul says we're so grateful that
[19:34] the Loose Ends have been tied together
[19:38] the Bible is a brand new Bible to us the
[19:41] Bible gives us a clear understanding of
[19:43] who we are where we're going where we
[19:45] came from the end times we are just so
[19:49] thankful for all that the Lord has
[19:50] revealed to us it reminds me of the Book
[19:52] of John the Gospel of John where Jesus
[19:54] said you used to be servants but now
[19:56] you're my friends and I tell my friends
[19:58] all the things that I'm doing God has
[20:00] told us so much through the ministry of
[20:02] brother brandham we're so grateful for
[20:04] that also reminds me of Genesis 18 where
[20:07] God said I won't hide the thing that I'm
[20:09] doing from Abraham I'll let him know
[20:12] because he's kept the way of the Lord
[20:13] he's trained his household and by God's
[20:15] grace we're Abraham's seed because we
[20:17] have faith in Jesus Christ let's keep
[20:19] drawing nigh to God and God will
[20:21] continue to draw nigh to us and reveal
[20:23] more of his Revelation to us if you have
[20:26] any questions or concerns or testimonies
[20:28] about this video please contact
[20:30] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[20:33] the desire of your heart
