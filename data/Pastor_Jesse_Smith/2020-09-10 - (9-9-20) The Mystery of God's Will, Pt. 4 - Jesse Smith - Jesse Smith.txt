christ glad we have uh righteousness imputed to us praise god i'm sure your life and my life has seen victories this week but i'm sure we've all fallen short of the glory of god so that makes the righteousness of christ that much sweeter praise god so let's uh have a few uh prayer requests here i'm sorry it's so hot uh we were asked to move out some of the things in the furnace room as you probably saw they're supposed to work on the furnace and air conditioning unit tomorrow and friday so hopefully we're back to like regular american weather regular american uh temperatures on sunday hopefully i'm not promising um but you know this is i saw the temperature i think it was 80 degrees in here so it's a little bit warmer but not bad compared to places i've preached i'm sure our friends from ghana have had a lot hotter weather than that um but anyways we're thankful for god's grace we're thankful we don't have to pay for that you know but we're thankful for very good landlords um also just a few more announcements uh you probably saw we'll do a few testimonies on sunday and i would like to do the lord's supper on sunday so um i'll try to shorten the sermon i'll try to preach about 45 minutes it's been going good by god's space one thing i want to share with amen had a question for me um if you can't make the 4pm service and you like to do communion after the first service i can do that we've done that before when people have you know responsibilities or something um and it would just look like i just dismissed service everybody would leave except the people that i would minister communion to so we're happy to do that we've done that before it's been a number of years but just so you know i just you know when i was worshiping sunday uh sunday night after service i just was kneeling down here and i just looked over and i just in my mind i thought well where's the bread and the wine that we should have some communion i thought my it's been too long it's time to have the lord's communion so let's have fellowship sunday lord willing with communion also just a testimony my sister uh sent my or sent me a text and said my dad is almost back to normal let's thank the lord for that praise god praise god and so there's been lots of prayers for my dad i thank you very much for the prayers um and let's pray for his salvation praise god i'm sure if you know any of you have any grandparents or parents that aren't saved how you long for them and pray for them to be saved let's continue to pray for the healing of the soul um okay so now let's get into a few prayer requests quite a few but the amen said his work atmosphere needs prayer let's pray for that praise god also i'm still supposed to debate that gentleman uh on saturday but i don't have his questions yet he's had mine for a month i haven't had his i also debate him i don't care but just pray for me that the holy spirit will help me and i'll yield to the holy spirit also brother jose's son-in-law and daughter did test positive for coronavirus so let's pray for them jose said he was tested but he's a negative so i still asked him to quarantine you know to stay stayed home for a little while at least until he can quarantine let's pray for their healing also let's pray for austin's mother uh she just she and i were texting this week let's pray for her brother brooks's mother-in-law is still battling the cancer she's losing a lot of weight still alive um but it's hard on you know her and her and brother brooks's wife because she's there kind of just being by her her bedside there in lima so it's just hard on them so let's pray for them and lastly my brother sam his nephew fell today at school on his head and has a brain bleed uh really serious situation he's in the hospital tonight in toledo so let's pray for healing by god's grace does anybody else have a need on their heart they'd like to be remembered okay praise god can you play the great physician and let's pray before the lord the bible says the fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much so we can only make our requests made known to god and it's in god's hand but our duty our responsibility is to live holy have a pure heart and pray fervently praise god so let's pray heavenly father god we love you we'll worship you forever we'll love you forever because you are so good that's your hallelujah tonight jesus i bless you i thank you god you've been so good i thank you for the testimony hallelujah [Music] with all the fervency in my heart [Music] [Music] god [Music] are unaffected [Music] [Music] wisdom [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] patience [Music] is bless us [Music] blessing us god [Music] uh let's go to our scripture we want to look at tonight pardon me i don't even know if i picked out a text so let's just go to the first one here i think we'll go to uh we'll just go the first one let's go to james15 james15 and then we'll read our memory verse hallelujah i'll worship him forever and i love him forever because he's so good james 1 5 let's read this here together we like to look at the mystery of god's will i believe it's part 4 tonight this chapter ends with just practical ways to know you're in the perfect will of god and that's what we desire paul said you can have it if you have a transformed mind and you present your body a living sacrifice lady can you check who honked out there can you see maokai can you check real quick both of you just in case i don't know just nice to know if anybody coming around we got little kids walking the hallway so let's read our scripture james 1 5. let's read that together on three one two three if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him isn't that a beautiful promise god his wisdom flows out liberally that means like it just flows freely so when you ask god for understanding and how to arrange your life it's like he just pours it out from heaven praise god that's a it's a comforting thought to know right you don't have to you know we don't have to struggle all the time for wisdom or we uh we have to walk in foolishness god doesn't act like that if people want to know the decisions god makes it known praise god what a blessing now go to uh matthew 6 let's do our memory verse here tonight i guess we're just kind of taking over the august mary verse right into september i didn't realize that so just now so praise the lord it's worth it i wonder who'd be next though after stephen i think he would be the most recent saint in our church matthew 6 30. what a promise praise god let's read 30 down to 34. let's read that on three one two three wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith all shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof may god add his blessings the ring of his word may be seated praise god [Applause] okay so let's set a timer here we'll try to do about 40 minutes by god's grace all right so uh let's look for god's will i'm gonna believe god's will is a is a pretty simple thing to find i do i believe that by god's grace if god is going to be a fair judge he's got to give everybody an equal chance right to know his will find it and then obey it has to be so simple that god would uh for those who accept it god would honor them and give them rewards but for those who would reject it they would have to burn and be tormented for many many many uh years we don't know how long but it has to be such a simple thing and i'm glad god reveals it to us praise god what a uh what encouragement to know now let's look right here we finished uh when or sunday night with how to know god's perfect will present your body so consecrate your body uh consecrate your body set aside your body so it's in a holy condition right and then renew your mind just feed all think on the word of god anything that's pure good holy fill the mind with the word of god and then you'll be able to prove the perfect will of god amen now let's go through how you can know god's perfect will for your relationships uh your job and where you live ministries and then the gifts of the holy spirit i don't imagine we'll get to the gifts of the holy spirit tonight um but i'd like to get to those maybe sunday by god's grace okay now if you consecrate your body and renew your mind you can know god's perfect will what a blessing you don't have to guess is this the right job for me uh who do i marry where's my home church you church we don't have to guess we can know what god wants for our lives that's quite that's quite a wonderful blessing uh and that's why so many people the bible calls them how many know the bible calls them wondering stars sinners are called wandering stars and they are reprobates too they wander from here to there they can't find a place of rest praise god amen it's a good sign that your soul is at rest when your physical location is at rest as well praise god amen it's a true blessing to be able to know that remember you can do you must do all the known will first as you're waiting for god to show you about relationships do everything that you know in the will of god first in the scripture and then wait for the season now waiting is the hard part but we know if we wait upon the lord we'll only get stronger praise god we'll renew our strength hallelujah that's what the scripture says how many are witness to that you've waited on god it might have been hard might have been difficult but your strength was renewed once the prayer was answered praise god hallelujah now let's look at relationships if you've got your bible go to first corinthians 7 i'm going to uh ask lydia to switch over i just want to show a little quote it's a confusing quote i'm sorry to some not to the real saint of god who waits on the lord but uh i'll read this in just a moment not yet but let me look at the scripture first corinthians 7 about relationships in fact most of this chapter covers about every single person on earth you're either single married uh yeah you're either singled or married or separated uh so or divorced so it covers about everyone and i love how the previous chapter showed if you were guilty of let's say adultery or something or fornication even homosexuality you can be washed by the blood of jesus christ amen it's such a powerful powerful chapter now uh paul in this chapter um first corinthians seven sorry i'm in romans seven my fault first corinthians seven i want to bring out a few things here that may be uh strange maybe to some uh maybe you don't do it but i'm in constant uh i'm constantly looking at you know the people who worship brother branham you know their websites and i'm looking at the people that despise brother branham that left brother man's message i'm constantly looking at those because it sharpens me i'm able to see where they getting off where are they getting wrong remember the bible said mark those who cause division so i'm doing my duty it may not be your duty and that's fine uh i'm not i'm not saying that at all what i'm saying is i know it's my duty to rightly divide the word so i get a lot of i get a lot of strength actually by looking at the wrong because it points me back to the truth praise god or it confirms what i what god has already showed me in his word as the truth so i constantly look at that and of course listening to brother branham and listening to message preachers i just try to give it equal time how many other how many know you're constantly trying to find balance in your life right you'll get feel like you're caught up on prayer but then your sermon listening goes down and then your bible reading is maybe really good but then your prayer needs to back up right we are constantly looking for a balance in our lives right but the main thing seek ye first the kingdom of god if you can just get the first thing right amen you can get that first thing right ultimately uh it'll go back to nice a nice equilibrium praise god or a nice area of balance if you can just seek the the kingdom of god first i think you understand what i'm saying praise god now paul addresses the single at the beginning uh if a man is burning with passion he should be married okay uh the bible calls it uh burning yes it's verse nine yes therefore if they cannot contain let them marry for it's better to marry than to burn okay now actually verses three through uh seven deal with married couples how they should constantly stay in uh fellowship through the married bed i'll just say it like that generally speaking they should not defraud one another right unless they're gonna fast for a season and paul speaks this by permission and then he says by i'm sorry he said by permission he says i wish men were like me that had the gift of being single and so with your relationship first uh find where you are praise god paul addresses those who are virgins or unmarried and the married and even the those that are separated he addresses it in this entire chapter so we have single people in our church right we have young people that are growing up and uh we'll be single adults uh if the lord tarries uh first they need to if you're single they need to pray and find out if they have the gift to be single right because if god reveals they have the gift to be single then they don't have they can deal with that issue right and they can pray through and have victory in that issue right because that's what paul says in verse seven it's a proper gift the bible says to be single now you don't find a whole lot of people like that right but the bible does say it is a proper gift because marriage is the second uh most important decision you'll ever make in your life praise god so you do it uh the bible says uh you do it in the fear of the lord praise god now the scripture uh says as we read james 1 5 if you need god's wisdom ask him for it amen amen just like you would your father your mother when when you have a need you just ask and believe and the bible said god gives it out generously praise god i'm sure we've all been in that situation we asked for information we get more than what we asked for right we look probably a little embarrassed when we do when that happens to us but god is like that god is so kind and generous uh that god if we ask him he'll pour it out abundantly praise god he'll just keep pouring it out all the wisdom maybe it's a whole lot it's an hour long sermon maybe it's a two-hour long sermon maybe it's a brother random three-hour sermon and the wisdom of god is poured out from heaven praise god in that sermon it comes liberally praise god and so when we ask we we must expect to receive praise god now it's first important to know before we get in this chapter a little bit that vows are a very serious thing and most of us weren't raised that way unless you were raising the message i never learned that till i came to the message when someone makes a vow or an engagement it's a very serious thing now personally i don't believe god holds it against someone if they make of engagement and they break it if they didn't know about it okay let's say if they were in the world uh because i know people like that they were in the world had engagement broke off uh but then came in the message i believe god forgives that because i believe god is rich in mercy now some people would call me a heretic for that but we have to understand it's a different age praise god it's not most people today aren't raised with that kind of understanding and you'd be surprised you know some people do believe that that even if they didn't know better they can't marry again i think that's a wrong thing now it's different if they're married if they're officially married they go through the marriage act and and they live married and then divorce that's different because they uh they had they they made the vows publicly to me that's different they lived in the marriage relationship and they actually live with the individual i believe that's different i believe then at that point they are uh bound to that person as long as they shall live praise god now remember the vow is important because matthew 1 18-20 god or the angel recognized joseph's vow to mary and said fear not to take mary thy wife and they weren't even married yet so we know god takes it seriously the power of the vow is taught in numbers 30. now just for your sake by the amen and sister who if you haven't heard this before numbers 30 gives all kinds of details about vows and uh just generally speaking a lot of message people go go back to that book on how to deal with vows i think that's a wise thing to do but i don't believe it's as strict as numbers 30 says it is number 30 is pretty strict i mean there's a lot of wisdom in there and i would have to take a whole another sermon just to preach on that chapter but i believe it is a good thing to recognize that every woman is under the headship of her dad right until she's married i do believe that's an obvious scriptural teaching i think people can see that because the bible talks about a married woman if she cuts her hair she dishonors her head and her head is her husband and if it dishonors her husband then it dishonors christ then it dishonors almighty god the invisible spirit all right so that's just a brief thing about engagements now first of all or next if you are single but you're living with somebody and committing sexual sin you know you're clearly out of god's will because the bible says it's god's will to avoid fornication it's totally god's will so uh we've seen this in the message brother and sister people that were fornicating right not married they come into the message and they automatically think they should get married they shouldn't do that without prayer because i i've seen it myself i i know i've seen it myself when we first came in there was people that were living in fornication they thought well we better get married and they didn't even pray about it and later on the man would abuse the wife and it destroyed homes and divorces and now it's led to adultery what they should have done is repented of their sins stop fornicating now see they just got married so they could continue having relations without knowing if it was god's will or not does everybody understand now it's different now there's a there's a difference there too if they if they knew the message and they after they knew the message they made the vows that's different and that just shows they never really prayed about it if the marriage goes astray but the bible says what god has joined together amen amen that's the thing we got to let god join husbands and wives together praise god amen amen so i just want to say that you know for those in our congregation and uh maybe those learning that don't have a home church listening if if someone's in fornication and they hear the message that doesn't mean they should automatically marry unless god has revealed to them that that's the person there to marry okay so i hope that's understandable please if there's any questions about these subjects please let me know because they're they are of the utmost importance praise god marriage and divorce and where you uh work where you go to church these things are very important all right um now if you if they come to the message while mary the bible says stay in the marriage now there's a lot of evil doctrines out there one's called two souls where they let people that were married before the message they come in they let them divorce their previous wife because that their soul wasn't converted yet and now they have a new soul that's a bunch of trash that's a bunch of nonsense right that's tommy rot we'd say because they're already married they're already living they got a family they made a vow in front of everybody probably in a church but see men do that in the message because they're not born again and they never love their wife to begin with and that shows they never had divine love because god's love is love for your wife praise god that's going to make you love your wife until death praise god it's going to make you make you love your husband to death as well praise god the love of god and so see it's a sad sad thing now let's go to the scripture look at verse 10 first corinthians 7 10 leave that up there i don't know why my phone keeps sleeping so fast uh verse 10 and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband but and if she departs so see there's times women may leave their husbands because of child abuse or themselves being abused or other situations right sisters do not have to stay in situations and be abused they don't have to they can flee right just like the christians in jerusalem they fled persecution in rome like it's the same idea uh god doesn't want people many times to be abused on purpose okay so just uh let that be known because uh the when problems come in the message in any church any church that tries to establish man over woman which that's bible right and it happens in our denominations i've seen it too where men abuse their wives because why there's to submit to everything and they say see you got to submit to my abuse because you must submit to everything that's from the devil that's a lie from hell that's a lie god doesn't want that to happen that's the that's a demonic spirit not the holy spirit the holy spirit loves and forgives and is patient it's got temperance praise god amen well before it has the holy ghost it's got temperance to control the body amen and control the temper and to clean you out of your temper praise god that's what it's to do now look at verse 11 but if but and if she depart let her remain unmarried see or be reconciled to your husband so see whenever there's a physical separation like my parents they got divorced but they never remarried so they could potentially get back together that's what i'm praying for that's what we're praying for tonight we'll pray for that at the end i want to pray for all the parents at the end of the service here all of our parents or grandparents or unsaved loved ones see that's that's the only option if they divorce they can not remarry except the one cause and that was unconfessed fornication before a couple was married because the vow was a false vow it wasn't made in sincerity and so god doesn't jesus doesn't hold that one against a man if his wife lied to him and wasn't pure and lied about it then the vow wasn't real right it wasn't genuine and so jesus will allow a man to put that woman away and marry another but only in the lord now that's so rare church that's so rare so in most cases the person that's married has to remain married till death praise god in most cases even adultery even adultery doesn't allow a man or woman to divorce and remarry not even adultery only fornication because jesus said saving for the cause of fornication the fornication is before marriage not earn okay okay now let's finish verse 11 and let not the husband put away his wife but to the rest speak i not the lord okay so now this is paul if any brother hath the wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away and the woman which hath and husband that believeth not and if he be pleased or dwell with her let her not leave him for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy praise god amen look at that paul said try not to separate he said this is my opinion a holy ghost-filled saint even if their spouse uh isn't in the message or isn't a real holy ghost-filled believer their life will influence their spouse's life amen you can't help it right why because light is shining against darkness praise god and it has to have an effect hallelujah light has to have an effect on darkness amen and they said see that makes your children holy too in other words sanctified or set apart because of one holy person the home it keeps the children from a sinful a more sinful life doesn't mean they're saved it means well i guess they would be saved until the the age of accountability whenever that is the mormons say it's 12 or i think what is it nine now they keep changing it one time i talked to them they said it was twelve and the next time it was nine well which one is it how can it change how can god change only god knows that praise god and so see paul is saying remain because your life will have an influence on someone else praise god now verse 15 is well misunderstood by many people but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases but god hath called us to peace now some people a lot of churches not in the message but a lot of denominationals say see you're not under bondage if you depart which means you don't have to remain married and you can remarry that's not what it means because that would contradict verse 11 which says either be me unmarried or reconciled see that you can't have verse 15 contradict 11. they all have to make sense and that has to line up with matthew 5 where jesus said only one cause for remarriage and matthew 19 where jesus said take it back to the beginning praise god go back to adam and eve with relationships praise god see there is no contradiction in the word of god look at verse 17 but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called everyone so let him walk and so ordain i in all the churches there's testimonies all around the message even up north uh the churches we used to attend where one person was saving the message and the other one wasn't but they kept praying for years and years and years and finally the other one came in praise god amen see god because the bible said god called them praise god god called him in that condition see god's trying to get a testimony god's trying to build a character god's trying to make you like christ amen amen a soul winner amen an influencer a living tabernacle of the living god amen he's trying to make you that he's trying to make all of us that recently brother there's a good testimony sister um there's a brother named herb up at a sheffield okay he he and his wife came in the message but their children were old enough they walked away from it brother amen he sat in that pew i remember him he died this year actually a corona virus i think he died or maybe it was a combination of something i remember but he passed away in uh march well two years ago brother before he died his daughter came down with cancer the cancer and she's in her 60s now the cancer drove her to the message she repented she let her hair grow god healed her of cancer and the last time i preached here last time went up there i got the fellowship with her and she told me the whole testimony and it was like what 50 years she was on the message while the parents they just sat there amen service after service they just said amen amen amen and they applied the token and god drove those those children god drove them to his presence god saved them god rewards faithfulness amen amen i wish you could tell her testimony that was so refreshing that was so encouraging to hear wow god will use anything god hears those humble simple prayers he was just a hunter out in the woods i mean that's what he would do he just go hunting that's how he was old and retired and he just go hunting but he kept praying so faithful to god's house so faithful and two years before he dies god lets him see the glory of healing cancer amen and even the greater glory of his daughter being saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost praise god no greater healing than that praise god amen so see god has called you to a certain testimony right and we must be faithful in the testimony that's called us now here's a quote a lot of people stumble at but this is i notice 1956 about marriage and divorce let me tell you something a lot of you women tonight would have an awful time doing that talking about you know how the sinner washed jesus feet with her hair you'd have to stand on your head to do it shame on you the bible said the hair is given to the woman for her glory that's such a perfect line she'd have to stand on her head well then she'd be a modest right and the bible now look this is where people stumble the bible writes gives a man a right to leave and divorce and leave his wife that'll cut her hair that's the bible that's thus saith the lord too bad you got away from the old fashioned trainings isn't it now this quote stumbles a lot of people but not me because the bible says if they depart let them depart now the bible says if a woman cuts her hair it's a shame to her husband how many know that can a man put away his wife for cutting your hair yes but my question is what kind of a man would do that and this is what i wrote somebody emailed me about that this last week and i said sir i said have you ever brought shame upon your wife by disrespecting her out in the church parking lot how many brothers do that think about that she cut her hair which is a shame it is an awful shame right to get there but how many times what if that man has shamed his wife in front of the kids you ever think about that so my question is what kind of a man would want to do that now people in the message now i've i've never met any well i'm sorry i did i'm sorry i didn't meet them but i knew they're from the state of maine there were some message people that used this uh and the pastor was so corrupt he urged his wife to cut her hair in order to divorce her so he can marry another woman in the church that was hap that happened in this country uh probably 15 20 years ago i can't remember the exact uh last time i went up to maine we heard that story and church is split because of this because see they don't understand the word of god but when you but see church when you really get married because you love someone you're willing to endure with them despite their struggles because you know you have struggles and if jesus forgave you you can forgive them praise god so the thing to do is if a woman cuts her hair for man shames his wife uh forgive brother random said i believe if i made a mistake and uh hugged and kissed on a woman while on the mission field i believe my wife would forgive me he said but god gave me the holy ghost so i wouldn't do that praise god amen amen and how many couples did brother unite that were divorced and he brought him back together he never said okay divorce her and go remarry again he never did that he always sought for reconciliation just like the bible says amen be reconciled amen if they sinned against others go confess the sin to the ones they sin against confess it to yourselves and let the love of jesus heal and show the world how the healing power of christ is alive and well in a world that loves to divorce and makes it easy financially to divorce in a world that loves a divorce the church of god if we've got problems and people weren't born again thought they were born again then let's be honest and sincere and let's show the world what real love is praise god but can a man put away his wife yeah the bible says really for any reason right because he's the head he's the head he can do that but i'd question a man that would do that i would question if he's born again or not praise god now that may be hard for some people to do but what do you do with this quote it's thus saith the lord right it's thus saith the lord a man as that authority he can do that he has the authority to do that but if he's really loves that woman i don't think he'll do that do you i don't think so so see a lot of people stumble at that but they fail to understand the rest of the scripture and the the brothers especially will use this in order to go remarry somebody else and that's nothing but uh evil lust all right so now kind of heavy on relationships tonight praise god see how you can prove if you're in the perfect will of god if god called you in marriage stay married if you're single find god's will you get should you be single you got the gift to be single or are you waiting on a marriage partner you're separated remain uh unmarried and see if god will reconcile the couple hallelujah now if you know in this chapter marriage is about serving how many know that marriage is about service go to verse 33 first uh corinthians 7 33 remember paul was a zealous man but if everybody would have found his advice and not get married there'd have not been many children right then there'd not been many uh fathers and mothers to to train them up in the way they should go right they would have physically limited uh the number of arrows right they would have limited the number of arrows remember the bible said god's children are god's heritage that means possession amen children are god's possession they're from god amen they belong to god and god wants to send them so that he can shoot them out and battle the enemy at the gates praise god amen like i'm doing tonight god wanted me to be an arrow to go shoot and fight the enemies here in akron praise god and here we are we're rebuking demons in jesus christ's name amen trying to pray for the sake see that they'll recover rebuke sickness amen and have and fight the enemies right at the gates and the gates of hell will not prevail against this revelation amen here i am flying through the sky but amen one of these days i'm going to hit that mark and god's going to take me take me home one of these days i'm going to hit that mark by god's grace now that's just one way to look at it you might say i already hit the mark that might be true maybe he'll use me again i don't know but uh you see the point we've got a we're in a battle church we are instruments of war your prayers are powerful amen we saw that with naomi and her mom features praying for my wife night after the prayer perfect next night there's the baby god's grace god's grace the fervent prayers of the righteous prevail much praise god amen now this is all about pleasing your wife and husband verse 33 but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world that he may please his wife okay so paul says you know you're you're not going to be able to fully focus uh on your particular ministry if uh you're married but at the same time the reality is and that's true the reality is your ministry changes not to you it changes to sharpening that arrow praise god that's what that's what it changes to instead of just me me me iron sharpening iron now you will get sharpened while you're training children though that's for sure but you get you your eyes are off you how many no pair your parenting is losing selfishness how we know that's really the definition of parenting losing your selfishness right and then now it's off of you and you sharpen the next generation you get the next set of weapons ready to go to combat satan one of these days uh uh amen knows one of these days i want to bring out all of jonathan edwards descendants did you read that yet in the book so that's okay they traced his descendants brother and out of this preacher jonathan edwards from the 1800s came like a vice president 20 judges like a hundred preachers of one man amen one man and you look at his life he was one arrow but he was sharpening all kinds of errors he was training them up senators and representatives he was training them up and out of his lineage come forth a royal seed amen a holy seed amen that shape they shaped the the direction of this nation that's what i was telling my kids a few months ago i was like i want somebody to raise up and meet judges so when these left people that you know the people on the political left that try to change the laws and bring in all these wicked laws maybe my children stand there and say that's wrong it's against the constitution and bang their gavel i don't know i don't know how long we'll tarry but church you know my heart right i just want to see righteousness in every place we can get it praise god whether it's school of politics your home the job you know work we want righteousness to reign amen someone do my part praise god that's what i'm doing tonight if my children are listening if they'll listen they'll be sharpened tonight praise god because every every time i come to church i get sharpened i don't know about you do you ever get dolled by the holy spirit no you just sharpened praise god amen if you'll let god sharpen you right you either become dull lukewarm or become sharper by the holy spirit how much time do i get okay wow less than two minutes ah i thought i might even get to the other things well the lord knows how many times i preach i didn't think and then people were being blessed yeah so we just trust the holy spirit so god's if you're a parent god's will is to diligently love teach and discipline and provide for your children i have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven scriptures in here that say that our job as parents is to sharpen the character so the children will defeat the future enemies praise god i appreciate that i appreciate i think about this i was trained enough i was sharp enough even in denominational church where there was times the enemy was coming after me but i've been sharpened enough i could overcome that temptation there was a couple times praise god and because i was at least given a little bit of sharpening i was able to overcome praise god you can sharpen the stone a little bit it'll cut you don't have to cut like real deep but you sharpen enough it'll cut how many of that now if you for all your family non-family members the bible said live at peace with all men as much as possible so i've gone through your family right your marriage relationships are single children and now outside of that relatives try to live peaceably with all men that's the will of god have answers ready for those who ask about your faith and season them with grace jesus says bless and love your enemies rather than cursing them overcoming evil with good i know about you church but that sounds like a pretty easy plan to me is the will of god so mysterious not really if we sit and read our bibles and believe what it says and tie this one with that one and put it all together it's a pretty simple walk praise god and the best part is one one power fulfills it all love keeps all the commands praise god that's why being born again is so important if you just get born again and live from the soul and obey the nature god places in your soul you'll fulfill everything praise god amen hallelujah i know it's hot too me too i don't sweat this much in a while here all right this is a shorter one so for your job well close to this one okay so give me give me five think about five minutes maybe make it 10. god's will for your job is urgent question for us but remember this parenting is more important than a job right than money for male or female right for a man if a man gets a job and he can't train his and help his wife and children what what kind of job is that right would i want to just spend all my day working and then never see my wife and kids no that'd be like a waste of life right so man or woman i know we have sisters at work you know that's fine if god calls him that praise god but our our work should not interfere with the ways of god praise god we're training the next generation the bible says and i preached this when i remember when i preached the proverbs series remember that some people didn't like that that's okay they're gone i know god liked it praise god i know that that's true proverbs 29 15 says the rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame so see you can have you you and i have to work but we have to be able to spend time with our children in order to direct them so they feel like they've got somebody they've got a they've got a a leader they've got a friend my friend calls it a buddy when they become teenagers they've got to feel like they got somebody on their side praise god and they have to have somebody they can talk to and ask questions about the word of god see don't leave them to themselves that's why that's why child trafficking is so big in the u.s right because all the parents put their kids on the computer all day just go on the ipad and they leave them to themselves they don't spend time with them they don't talk to them they don't ask them how their day was they don't teach them nothing about god that's sinners right mostly i you know and i started supporting a uh a rescue operation ministry i just a little bit each month you know what they found they found most parents willingly sell their children away to child trafficking the majority of them because they're so filled with drugs they want drug money if they'll get ten thousand say ten thousand might be a number that's awful church that is just so isn't that so heartbreaking but that's where we live in where there the bible said they would lose natural affection right because of the love of sin because of the the great iniquity the love of many shall wax cold they spent so much time on movies and games and drugs that they lost the natural love for a child what a blessing children are praise god they're god's possession amen they're god's arrows hallelujah see they leave them alone to their ipad leave them alone tv the choice between more money or staying home more the choice is obvious spend more time with your kids i know there's homes that they can't make it without two incomes i know about that i know about that i wasn't making much money at all when i first got married i thank the lord for it i thank god for his mercy my mom is to me one of the great best examples that even after my parents divorced in junior high my mom would just stay at home do the you know lunches and everything like that and then at night she would go off and clean libraries so we were all home and she'd get home like at 10 p.m then we'd all do our prayer time and um we just made it off of government food for a while and church donations but look at the results now praise god look at the results now three preachers you know everybody now goes to church as far as i know everybody now goes to church she chose the harder way but it was well worth the investment you can work the rest of your life after the children grow up but you'll never get that time back to train them love and invest in our children's souls while their hope while there's hope proverbs 19 18 says chasten thy son while there is hope and let not thy soul spare for his cry now we know god can save anybody at any age praise god we know that but remember wisdom is all about likely possibilities right it's likely if we likely don't train them when they're young they'll likely not return because of our partly because of our negligence when you pray church for a job you let god lead you if you love god he'll let all the choices work for your good he said because all things work together for good we've got to be open to god moving us to different places different jobs paul was a tet maker luke was a doctor matthew was a tax collector peter was a fisherman lydia was a seller of purple the fine clothings you got peter over here he's getting all dirty you know fishing and then lydia's over here selling fine dignified purple and gold goggles yet both holy ghost-filled saints amen praise god now peter wasn't filled with holy ghost you know until after pentecost but he was on his way see god has different callings in life now paul was paul made tense by the work of his hands built sewed tents together made tense if god provided for them how many know he'll provide for us no matter the vocation god said work diligently ecclesiastes 9 10 says whatever your hand finds to do do it with your might for there's no work or device or knowledge nor wisdom in the grave where thou goes she said make the most of it work with all your heart and paul later says be not slothful in business i should be a very motivated teacher which i am if i was a lazy teacher it shows i wasn't born again because a christian is not lazy in their work a christian is up and at it praise god the man said that's one person that will work is a christian ephesians 6 6 paul tells servants serve from your heart not with eye service not as men pleasers see obey your boss as servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart so do your job like you were doing it for jesus praise god i know some of this is a review but i know i gotta preach it and wait for the inspiration of the holy spirit and a lot of people church i'm a i know what it's like sometimes you lose your heart like sometimes you lose a heart for your job how many can say you have to say too loud sometimes you lose motivation so you ask god lord created me a desire to work for this job like i would work for you right in other words restore the joy right restore my love uh show me my purpose now it helps me too when people say you know we prayed and asked god for you to be our teacher and you're an answer to our prayers that helps too say god show me that you place me here for a purpose for such a time as this like esther praise god always remember god doesn't give you the job to become rich unless you're one of those few saints that get to be rich so you can support the ministry of god with greater offerings but remember first timothy 6 6 but godliness with contentment is great gain money is only a means to an end right the end is loving god and your fellow man and god loves a cheerful giver how many can say amen today let's stand praise god that's about 45 minutes and maybe 50 by god's grace that's just a little review how many enjoyed that tonight we need our relationships and vocations we need to know this is god's will for my life i know where i'm at is god's will for my life i know that with all my heart i wait even my my marriage and where i live we waited upon all that we didn't jumping in fact we thought we were going to lose that especially where we live we thought we're going to lose that but the financing came through on the fourth time praise god for is deliverance musicians you can come amen each thing church each area each question our lives we wait upon the lord we the bible said present your body living sacrifice renew your mind ask god for wisdom wait upon the lord and he'll guide us praise god lord willing sunday unless the lord would change my thought we'll look at your location where you live and then ministries outside of preaching and then we'll look at gifts of the holy ghost ministries and i think that's towards the end of the chapter there let's see oh yeah then i give my testimony for each area how i found my the will of god for my relationships vocation location ministries and gifts of the holy spirit praise god let's bow our heads here for a moment let's have a word of prayer thanks for your patience thanks for sweating it out right and the presence
