[0:04] works of
[0:05] Grace uh you know like I told you

[0:08] on maybe just to uh just because I love
[0:10] you so much and uh I want you to know as
[0:13] much of the message as you can by God's
[0:14] grace as fast as you
[0:16] can but I know God doesn't work like
[0:18] that you know God works in times and
[0:20] Seasons you know but I just I just have
[0:22] a burden I love you so much I want you
[0:23] to know as much of the word of God as
[0:25] you possibly can in as a short amount of
[0:27] time as
[0:28] possible so we love you in the Lord uh
[0:31] let's go to uh Ezekiel 36 uh 26 and 27
[0:35] and then we'll read Mark
[0:38] 4:28 now I know I preached here before
[0:40] on the baptism of the Holy Ghost this
[0:42] message is closely connected to that and
[0:46] uh uh I think you'll be blessed tonight
[0:49] you know I do want to apologize I left
[0:51] my Bible at home I was in a rush to get
[0:52] out does anybody got a extra Bible uh by

[1:03] okay used to be I think they're just
[1:06] song books that's okay you I can use my
[1:08] uh that's okay I can use my phone I
[1:09] forgot about that I apologize you know

[1:17] Sarah all
[1:19] right well thank you sister I appreciate
[1:22] that
[1:24] hallelujah oh yes beautiful Bible here
[1:27] oh yes praise the
[1:28] Lord amen
[1:31] Ezekiel
[1:38] 36:26 this will be I believe a helpful
[1:41] message um there's many ways it applies
[1:43] to us as
[1:47] Believers and it's especially important
[1:49] oh and our sister even has this
[1:51] highlighted in her Bible praise the lord
[1:53] well that work look it's all in blue
[1:54] right there that's
[1:56] a that's a good sign right there we got
[1:58] two witnesses amen Witness here and
[2:00] witness here that I felt led the Lord I
[2:02] was praying in my closet this morning I
[2:04] thought Lord what could I teach this
[2:06] people how could I help your people I
[2:08] just kind of felt this thought about the
[2:10] three works of Grace so I just uh I'm
[2:13] just trying to go with the leading of
[2:14] the Lord here tonight I sure appreciate
[2:17] that uh verse
[2:19] 26 and let's read it together let's read
[2:21] 26 together and 27 I like to hear your
[2:23] voice so we can read maybe two verses
[2:25] there together out loud let's begin on
[2:28] three 1 2 3 he a new heart also will I
[2:32] give you and a new spirit will I put
[2:35] within you and I will take away the
[2:38] Stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[2:41] give you an heart of Flesh verse 27 and
[2:45] I will put my spirit within you and
[2:49] cause you to walk in my statutes and ye
[2:52] shall keep my judgments and do them amen
[2:56] of course this is Ezekiel uh if I'm not
[2:58] mistaken this is about
[3:00] uh 500 or so years before Christ and
[3:04] he's prophesying about how how is he
[3:06] going to help Israel how is God going to
[3:07] help Israel he's got to give them a new
[3:09] heart a new spirit and then he's got to
[3:12] put his Spirit within them in order for
[3:14] them to do the word of God hallelujah so
[3:18] we know we can do the word of God once
[3:20] we have God's spirit inside of us
[3:23] because that's the power inside of the
[3:25] believer how many know that by God's
[3:27] grace amen let's have one more word of
[3:29] prayer if you would let just bow our
[3:30] hearts here father God we're thankful to

[4:43] Hallelujah we always want to appreciate
[4:45] everybody who has a burden you know to
[4:47] uh play a part and you all do it by
[4:50] coming of course but you know I just
[4:51] like to recognize people that you know
[4:54] do these things and we're grateful by
[4:56] the grace of God for them so it looks
[4:58] like that's going to work okay praise
[5:00] the Lord uh I see I got three more times
[5:02] including tonight to preach to you for
[5:04] the summer by God's grace I got two more
[5:06] if you got any topics let me know
[5:08] afterwards or pray about it and text me
[5:10] you know after tonight we got two more
[5:12] topics if there's one you know certain
[5:14] topic You' like me to address or just do
[5:16] an overview on numerous topics I can do
[5:18] that like I'd love to show you marriage
[5:19] and divorce brother mam gave it to us
[5:21] thus sayith the Lord I'd love to show
[5:23] you the New Jerusalem you know the
[5:24] future home uh there's so many topics
[5:27] I'd like to preach to you by God's grace
[5:28] so that you're heard it from the word of
[5:30] God and God's Prophet you know I like to
[5:32] I like to just uh do that by God's grace
[5:36] so you know tonight I felt this was
[5:37] important so I trust the Lord will guide
[5:39] us here uh by the holy
[5:42] spirit so the the three works of Grace
[5:45] uh raise your hand if this is kind of a
[5:47] new subject to you okay okay a lot of
[5:49] hands up okay great well then this will
[5:51] be good by God's grace um in other words
[5:54] there's three works or three steps God
[5:56] has to take you to to fill you with the
[5:58] Holy Ghost and it's it's all throughout
[6:01] the New Testament praise God and I'm
[6:02] going to show you there's five examples
[6:04] in the New Testament I mean anyone that
[6:06] denies this would have to deny the Bible
[6:09] they would have to deny the written word
[6:11] of God in order to deny this but let me
[6:13] tell you most churches do deny
[6:16] this so that proves uh most churches are
[6:19] deceived Jesus said few there be that
[6:21] find the narrow road that leads to
[6:23] eternal life how many remember that
[6:25] Matthew
[6:27] 7:14 very few people will find that Road
[6:30] and I'm going to I I'll close with that
[6:32] thought by God's grace now you read this
[6:35] from Ezekiel ezekiel's prophesying I
[6:37] love the next chapter the next chapter
[6:39] is the valley of dry bones amen that's
[6:41] the 144,000 Hallelujah God's going to
[6:44] bring these dead bones he's going to
[6:46] bring them back to life Hallelujah and
[6:48] Israel finally recognized their Messiah
[6:50] that's Ezekiel chapter 37 Hallelujah but
[6:54] 36 is speaking of the three works of
[6:58] Grace all right that God was sending to
[7:00] Israel now most of Israel would turn it
[7:02] down so God would blind Israel but there
[7:05] were some Jews that did receive this
[7:06] like Paul Peter James and John
[7:09] Bartholomew all those Mary the mother of
[7:12] Jesus all those saints that were in the
[7:14] upper room they receive this scripture
[7:17] and I'll tell you tonight you can
[7:18] receive it as well Hallelujah that's why
[7:20] you're here tonight Hallelujah because
[7:21] you want to receive this if you haven't
[7:23] already some of you probably have I've
[7:25] heard your testimony some of you have
[7:27] some of you believe that you have the
[7:28] Holy Ghost in your your soul Hallelujah
[7:30] and that's wonderful but this is Brother
[7:32] Ram's thought you know there's a new
[7:35] heart brother ram calls that
[7:37] justification right and justification
[7:39] means God has declared you righteous
[7:42] that's the first step you're saved right
[7:44] you're justified by faith the Bible says
[7:47] Romans chapter 5 and uh numerous verses
[7:50] in Romans and then of course Ephesians 2
[7:53] 8-10 we are saved by grace through faith
[7:56] not of Works lest any man should boast
[7:59] hallelujah we're saved by grace when we
[8:01] repent of our sins and we trust in Jesus
[8:04] Christ's righteousness we are saved we
[8:06] are Justified
[8:08] Hallelujah and then that's the first
[8:10] step that's a new heart God gives you a
[8:12] new heart the Bible said here plainly
[8:14] before you were a Christian you had a
[8:15] Stony heart you know nobody could tell
[8:17] you anything about the word of God right
[8:19] you were living in sin uh we are living
[8:22] in sin we didn't want to hear about the
[8:23] word of God I'd I'd sit in church like
[8:25] this like come on preacher when are you
[8:26] going to like my head would be down the
[8:28] whole time when and now I'm the one
[8:29] shouting and screaming and praising God
[8:31] all over the place the first one to get
[8:32] there to church the last one to leave
[8:34] amen hallelujah so I Had a Heart of
[8:36] Stone before I don't want anybody to
[8:38] tell me nothing I don't want you to tell
[8:39] me nothing I don't care I don't care but
[8:41] now my heart's open when I got saved now
[8:43] I had a new heart now I had a hunger now
[8:45] I want to know God's word hallelujah my
[8:47] heart is tender to the word of God now
[8:50] Glory but then the second step is a new
[8:52] spirit which means your mind you're
[8:54] thinking brother R said you got to
[8:56] develop new habits right you got to
[8:58] think uh differently about things and
[9:01] that's called sanctification s
[9:03] sanctification means a clean a cleansing
[9:05] a
[9:06] purification so you get saved you get a
[9:08] new heart but then God's got to give you
[9:10] a new way to think develop good habits
[9:13] but said it's got to clean you out
[9:15] brother said sanctification is cleaning
[9:17] you out and setting you aside for
[9:19] service you're not in service yet but
[9:21] you're getting cleaned out so you can be
[9:23] in service
[9:24] Hallelujah right and I'm sure you heard
[9:26] the story brother said the three works
[9:28] of Grace is just like a he said like a
[9:30] farmer going out to the chicken yard now
[9:32] this I got 17 chickens now yeah I think
[9:35] I yeah I got 17 chickens used to have
[9:37] 20 we had to get rid of two roosters and
[9:40] then one of them died during that heat
[9:41] that heat wave a couple weeks ago that
[9:43] was really sad for my daughters you know
[9:45] it's our first batch of chickens so
[9:46] they're really attached to the
[9:48] chickens but it's just brother is like a
[9:50] farmer walking out the chicken yard and
[9:52] I do this all the time brother John and
[9:53] my kids leave out the bowls and the cups
[9:55] out there well I tell you I pick those
[9:57] up the next day they're filthy I would
[9:59] not drink out of those bowls I would not
[10:02] drink out of that cup and brother Adam
[10:03] said that's God that's God pulling you
[10:05] out of the world you were filthy but
[10:07] when God picks you up now you're his
[10:09] hallelujah amen as dirty and filthy as
[10:12] you are God's got a purpose for you
[10:14] God's going to fill you eventually
[10:16] Hallelujah right so what do I do when my
[10:18] kids leave the dishes out sister Wilma I
[10:20] got to bring them in and wash them amen
[10:23] or put them in the
[10:24] dishwasher right and that's the that's
[10:27] the sanctification washing it SC
[10:29] scrubbing it or put in the dishwasher
[10:30] whatever you all got you know uh you got
[10:33] to wash it then you got to let it dry
[10:35] right and then finally when it's dry now
[10:37] I'll consider drinking out of that I
[10:40] wouldn't do it while I got it out there
[10:41] when I first picked it up I wouldn't put
[10:43] my ice cream in there I wouldn't put my
[10:45] you know I wouldn't put my lasagna in
[10:47] there I wouldn't eat that I wouldn't
[10:48] feel that but now that it's clean now
[10:50] that it's set aside it's washed out now
[10:53] I'll put something in there I'll fill
[10:55] that vessel amen and now I can use it
[10:57] for service Hallelujah to give me some
[11:00] ice cream
[11:01] hallelujah or whatever service you would
[11:04] you would use a vessel for and that's
[11:05] what the Bible said your vessels of
[11:07] Honor unto God hallelujah so that's what
[11:10] God does God picks you up Justified he
[11:12] cleans you out he sanctifies you and
[11:15] then he pours his holy spirit in you now
[11:17] he can use you for
[11:18] service does that make sense by God's
[11:21] grace brother R tells that story it's a
[11:23] beautiful story Hallelujah it explains
[11:25] it so very well so now you see the three
[11:28] steps right there new heart new spirit
[11:32] my spirit Jesus gives it another way for
[11:34] our farmer friends in here by God's
[11:36] grace go to Mark 4 verse 28 if you got
[11:40] your
[11:42] Bible I'm so glad Jesus could teach it
[11:44] and so such a calm and simple
[11:47] way that even a simple person like me
[11:49] could understand
[11:51] it it's actually in actually Mark 4:26
[11:55] sorry sister Rachel do you want to read
[11:57] that for us do you want to read uh 20 26
[12:00] 27 28 29 would that be okay sister
[12:02] Rachel
[12:04] okay and he said so is theom of God as
[12:09] cast seed into ground and SLE andise
[12:13] night and day and the seed and grow up
[12:16] he knowe not for the Earth bring fruit
[12:20] of first the blade then the
[12:25] after when the fruit is immedately
[12:30] because the Harvest is and the church
[12:33] said amen there's three steps to the
[12:36] wheat grain in here everybody see that
[12:38] in verse 28 for first is the blade you
[12:42] see the blade pop out of the ground
[12:44] right thank God it's going to thank God
[12:46] we're on our way hallelujah we're on our
[12:48] way to the the full maturity of the seed
[12:51] amen we can see it now it's manifested
[12:53] right that's
[12:55] justification right it's bringing forth
[12:57] something there's some life but there's
[12:59] bringing forth life right the Second
[13:01] Step then you get the ear right Second
[13:04] Step sanctification and third is the
[13:06] full corn so the wheat grain now and as
[13:10] far as know with wheat when I've seen
[13:12] the field then it bows when it's heavy
[13:13] right before Harvest Right it boughs a
[13:15] little bit so Jesus says this is what
[13:17] the kingdom of God is liken unto and I
[13:20] love this brother I love how the Jesus
[13:21] says the farmer goes to bed he wakes up
[13:23] he's like I don't even know how this
[13:24] happened God did this and that's how it
[13:27] is in your life sometimes you don't even
[13:28] realize how God is cleaning you out
[13:31] Hallelujah you even realize how God is
[13:33] so like how many demons did I have in me
[13:35] before I got saved I had to have many
[13:37] demons in me I don't even remember when
[13:39] they left me necessarily I remember when
[13:40] bitterness left me I remember that I had
[13:42] bitterness toward my dad and I wrote him
[13:44] a letter and I just got saved you know I
[13:46] didn't know the message or nothing I
[13:47] said dad I'm going to and then the Holy
[13:49] Spirit came I I didn't like my dad I
[13:50] hated my dad had all this bitterness
[13:52] because he divorced my mom and I was
[13:54] writing that letter to him he was in
[13:55] Tennessee I was in Ohio as I was writing
[13:57] the letter I remember the Holy Spirit
[13:59] brought back the words if you don't
[14:00] forgive others then God won't forgive
[14:03] you and I remember I started crying and
[14:05] then I C dad I forgive you for leaving
[14:07] us you you left six of your children but
[14:09] I forgive you I love you we're going to
[14:11] come and we're going to bring you home
[14:14] and I felt I felt that bitterness lead
[14:15] me so that was one time the demon left
[14:17] me amen but how many other demons I
[14:20] don't know but this is just like the
[14:21] farmer amen when God plants a seed in
[14:24] there he doesn't know how uh The Roots
[14:26] spring out he can't he can't plan that
[14:28] right did you ever watch that no it's
[14:30] it's hidden amen it's something
[14:32] Supernatural going on the inside but if
[14:34] God planted a seed and God Waters the
[14:36] seed and God gives sunlight to the seed
[14:38] that seed is going to bring forth
[14:40] hallelujah amen whether you understand
[14:42] it or not God is going to bring you into
[14:45] maturity of the Holy Spirit through
[14:47] justification sanctification and then
[14:49] you'll know you'll know when the the
[14:50] matur come you'll have a real experience
[14:53] Peter said we saw and heard the Holy
[14:55] Ghost fall amen when the Holy Ghost
[14:57] comes on you something will happen
[14:59] happen to you amen hallelujah praise God
[15:01] just like a baby when it's born amen
[15:04] everybody know that's seen it know you
[15:05] know when the baby's born there's no
[15:07] question the baby's born am because
[15:09] something has
[15:11] emerged something something has become
[15:13] visible amen you can see the baby you
[15:16] can hear the baby Hallelujah that's how
[15:17] it is in the spiritual when God gives
[15:19] birth when God births somebody people
[15:21] around something happened a birth a
[15:24] birth happened something emerged a new
[15:26] life has appeared hallelujah amen amen
[15:29] something happens Hallelujah you don't
[15:31] understand how it all happened like when
[15:32] did you lose this or when did you g gain
[15:34] that and how did all this you don't
[15:36] really understand how just like the
[15:37] farmer but you just know God's laws
[15:39] operate and God brings his word to pass
[15:43] hallelujah amen none of us can figure it
[15:45] out none of us Jesus said it's like the
[15:47] wind blowing none of us know when the
[15:48] wind's going to blow right none of us
[15:51] know when we're going a nice breeze we
[15:52] can try to predict when we're going to
[15:53] get some rain and you know when the
[15:55] clouds might come in and they got the
[15:56] radar and all these things they tried
[15:58] their best to predicted but how many
[15:59] know the weatherman's only right 50% of
[16:01] the time oh yeah I'm sure the farmers
[16:03] know that all their years out there on
[16:06] the fields he he he can try but he's not
[16:09] going to get it right all the time and
[16:11] that's Jesus said that's how the Holy
[16:12] Ghost is see a man goes to bed he wakes
[16:15] up uh and there's three stages here and
[16:18] this is the kingdom and remember Jesus
[16:20] said in Luke 17 the kingdom of God is
[16:22] within
[16:23] you let's read that Luke 17 I know you
[16:27] love the Bible here I think it's verse
[16:29] 21 around there but I don't got that one
[16:32] memorized here I want to get it
[16:37] memorized oh yeah there it is amen Luke
[16:40] 17:21 uh brother irin you want to read
[16:42] that for us
[16:45] brother neither shall they say l here or
[16:49] L there for behold the kingdom of God is
[16:53] within
[16:54] you yes Hallelujah sorry I want to check
[16:57] my timer been preaching 17 minutes
[16:59] already okay all right it's hard to
[17:04] believe thank you sir I appreciate your
[17:07] love for the word of God that's how we
[17:09] should all feel sometimes I put pressure
[17:11] on myself but that's right now look the
[17:13] kingdom of God where's the kingdom of
[17:14] God someone's like I want to join the
[17:15] kingdom of God when you repent the
[17:17] kingdom of God is in you and it's just
[17:19] going to grow like the seed eternal life
[17:23] comes in you right and it grows and
[17:25] grows and grows Hallelujah and it grows
[17:29] and then finally it goes through three

[18:14] she was you know half
[18:16] Indian and but in her she was a person
[18:19] that didn't dream she only had four or
[18:21] five dreams all of her life but every
[18:23] time she dreamed it was true she had a
[18:25] dream it was true I remember one time I
[18:27] was preaching many years ago she was
[18:29] living up the road right above here I
[18:31] was preaching right here at this church
[18:32] she dreamed a dream that I was standing
[18:34] by the side of three steps everybody see
[18:36] this uh like you sisters got some steps
[18:39] coming down right brother R standing by
[18:41] uh in a his mom had a dream brother
[18:43] standing by three steps so one step two
[18:44] step three step that's the three works
[18:46] of Grace but look at the dream that his
[18:49] mother had and I was standing preaching
[18:51] to everybody that they must walk up
[18:53] these three steps before they hit the
[18:55] highway now the highway is the Highway
[18:57] of Holiness right in Isaiah 35 we'll
[19:00] read that next so why don't you turn
[19:01] there if you got it uh if you got your
[19:03] Bibles go and turn to Isaiah 35 I don't
[19:06] have the verse memorized but I know I
[19:07] got the chapter memorized I hope so if
[19:09] not you have to forgive me brother Ram
[19:13] says and then on that highway is a
[19:16] little pearly like white line that runs
[19:19] right into the doors of Heaven to the
[19:20] Pearly gate and that Pearl had been
[19:22] stretched out over the top of these
[19:23] steps now look what says if that ain't
[19:26] my message exactly to day what three
[19:31] steps and then an ivory Highway brother
[19:33] said that's my message Glory my message
[19:37] is you got to walk up three steps and
[19:39] once you get to that third step then you
[19:40] walk the Highway of Holiness all the way
[19:43] to heaven to see Jesus amen he said
[19:46] that's my message he said exactly
[19:49] justification sanctification and the
[19:51] baptism of the Holy

[20:16] way and it shall be called The Highway
[20:18] of the way of Holiness
[20:21] and the unclean shall not pass over it
[20:25] but it shall be for those waying
[20:29] though fools shall not there amen I love
[20:34] this brother R picks up a scripture I'm
[20:36] sorry the uh Isaiah prophesied this this
[20:39] was 900 years before Christ he said
[20:42] there's going to be a way of Holiness
[20:43] the unclean cannot passed on this way
[20:45] think about that what are those steps
[20:47] it's cleansing you're clean by
[20:49] justification sanctification the baptism
[20:52] of the Holy Ghost now you're clean now
[20:53] you can walk Hallelujah now God can use
[20:56] you now God can put you into service
[20:58] Hall Hallelujah and it's right there in
[21:00] the Bible Hallelujah Isaiah
[21:03] 35:8 this is the way of
[21:05] Holiness and brother said see ain't that
[21:07] my message exactly the three works of
[21:09] Grace the justification sanctification
[21:11] baptism the Holy Ghost and I was saying
[21:13] that a person has to come up by these
[21:15] three steps to be able to walk that
[21:17] highway now listen here's here's a
[21:18] important part of the story and there

[21:43] shoes in the message right it's sad that
[21:46] some preachers allow but that's sin the
[21:49] high heeled shoes what does it do it
[21:50] props up a woman right props her up so
[21:52] her body sticking out more because men
[21:54] like to lust after her and it actually
[21:56] ruins their feet too why would they want
[21:57] to do that you know

[22:02] remember high heels are are preached in
[22:04] Isaiah 3 did you know that did you know
[22:05] the mincing the mencing in Isaiah 3
[22:07] remember that everybody remember raise
[22:09] your hand if you know that high heels

[28:36] God let me just read this here three
[28:38] works of Grace now uh go to Titus
[28:41] Chapter 2 I believe it's verse
[28:44] 9 Titus 2:9 I appreciate that Bible
[28:47] thank you sister Sarah appreciate that
[28:48] Titus 2 I believe it's nine I could be
[28:51] wrong
[29:03] there it is G all right Titus
[29:09] 2:9 actually it's verse 11 I'm sorry I'm
[29:11] a little bit uh too early on that one
[29:13] Titus 21 now I want you to
[29:16] see what Grace
[29:20] does okay now you know this most
[29:24] churches will say well uh you can live
[29:26] however you want cuz God gave us Grace
[29:28] you can smoke cigarettes you can get
[29:30] drunk uh you can divorce or remarry
[29:34] that's okay there's Grace for you no
[29:36] there's not if if you spurn Grace if you
[29:39] know better and still do it there's no
[29:42] Grace for that that's called willingly
[29:43] Disobedience I'm talking about Sinners
[29:45] I'm talking about churches that are
[29:47] really deep in sin I'm not talking about
[29:48] our daily small sins I'm talking about
[29:50] the major Abominations right and you
[29:53] know better right right like Herod right
[29:57] Herod divorced div his wife and then
[29:59] married his brother's wife
[30:01] herodias right I mean he needs to repent
[30:04] of that John said you got to repent of
[30:06] that that's why she killed
[30:07] him see he I mean but if he would have
[30:11] been humble he would have gave her back
[30:12] or at that point she's defiled he would
[30:14] have sent her away just live by herself
[30:17] if he really would would would have
[30:18] repented but he never repented see
[30:20] that's what I'm talking about I'm not
[30:21] talking about our daily sins or you know
[30:23] we we have doubts fears we get angry you
[30:25] know we might uh Pride lust or greed or
[30:29] some things we battle dayto day those
[30:32] spirits that come to us in different
[30:33] seasons I'm not talking about that I'm
[30:34] talking about these major sins that
[30:36] people they just allow the churches they
[30:38] they they get so big because they allow
[30:40] and they let the people live in such a
[30:42] way everybody understand by guys I'm
[30:44] talking about Methodist Baptist
[30:45] Presbyterian that's what I'm talking
[30:46] about you know Pentecostal that's what
[30:48] I'm talking about I'm not talking about
[30:49] people that are just like us living
[30:51] Sanctified uh set aside living holy
[30:54] lives and we we just battle sin on a
[30:55] daily basis that's not what I'm talking
[30:56] about I'm talking about church is that
[30:58] they legalize sin that's what I want to
[31:00] say they turn the grace of God into
[31:02] lasciviousness that's what I'm telling
[31:03] you
[31:05] am it's in that's Jude 1:3 if you want
[31:07] to read that they turn Grace into
[31:09] lawlessness you can live however you
[31:11] want in other words uh the Bible says a
[31:13] preacher has to be married to one wife
[31:15] well it's okay if the preacher married
[31:16] his third time around it's okay that's
[31:20] lasciviousness everybody understand but
[31:22] a church like us will stand on the word
[31:24] of God live or die amen we want God's
[31:27] word Hallelujah amise Lord now look at
[31:30] this Titus
[31:31] 2:1 look what Grace teaches how many
[31:35] receive God's grace anyone ever have a
[31:37] favor from God for salvation but Daniel
[31:40] you want to read that brother uh 2 verse
[31:43] 11 brother read uh I'm sorry 11 and 12
[31:46] brother for the grace of God that BR
[31:49] salvation appeared to all men teaching
[31:52] us that denying ungodliness and world of
[31:55] L we should live
[31:58] righteously and godly
[32:00] and amen what does grace teach now the
[32:04] church doesn't tell you Grace teaches oh
[32:06] you're saved no matter what you do you
[32:08] can divorce and remarry and have
[32:10] adultery you're saved we can do whatever
[32:12] you do that's not what Grace teaches and
[32:14] the church said what's the Bible say it
[32:16] teaches that's right Ryan amen buddy
[32:18] that's he's raising his hand saying
[32:20] amen the grace teaches to deny
[32:23] ungodliness Grace will teach you deny
[32:26] that don't don't accept that sin
[32:29] Grace will teach you to deny worldly
[32:31] lust don't give into the lust of the
[32:33] eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride
[32:34] of life Grace says don't give into that
[32:38] amen Grace says live soberly righteously
[32:41] Godly in this present world looking for
[32:44] what verse 13 looking for that blessed
[32:45] hope the Glorious appearing of our great
[32:48] God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave
[32:51] himself for us that he might redeem us
[32:52] from all iniquity and purify unto
[32:55] himself a peculiar people jealous of
[32:58] Good
[33:00] Works he died that he could wash us
[33:03] sanctify us fill us with the Holy Ghost
[33:05] that we be zealous to do the works of
[33:08] God isn't that beautiful verse right
[33:11] there see people and now go to 1
[33:14] Corinthians 15:10 sister Lydia if you
[33:16] can get that 1 Corinthians 15:10 here's
[33:19] another verse about how Grace makes you
[33:23] labor so if how many ever felt that
[33:26] burden like I'm a Christian I need to do
[33:27] more for God anybody ever felt that
[33:28] before that's Grace that's not legalism
[33:31] that's Grace that's Grace saying let's
[33:33] labor let's do something with our lives
[33:35] let's not waste our time
[33:37] amen and when you feel that voice saying
[33:40] oh don't give any this lust and and
[33:42] that's not legalism that's Grace
[33:44] Hallelujah Lord now we heard the
[33:45] legalism where they say you can't eat
[33:47] shrimp remember we talked about that
[33:48] that's legalism because Acts chapter 10
[33:51] proves that we talked about it God gave
[33:52] you the right verses brother that
[33:54] gentleman tried to bring in legalism
[33:56] that's sin that is legalism
[33:58] right he's bringing in legalism because
[34:00] the Bible says all the creatures of God
[34:02] Amen I God gave you that verse brother
[34:04] all the creatures of God are good to be
[34:06] received with Thanksgiving Hallelujah so
[34:09] you guys re by God's grace you recognize
[34:11] that evil spirit believe that's right
[34:14] you got to be a believer amen thank God
[34:17] for the liberty of the Holy Ghost amen
[34:19] but the but still the Holy Ghost will
[34:22] say labor more for me give me more of
[34:24] your
[34:26] life uh deny lust that's the Holy
[34:29] Ghost that's Grace that's God's gift to
[34:32] you amen that's God's gift to you that
[34:34] God's spirit lives inside of you and
[34:36] saying don't give into the lust obey and
[34:39] let's and uh put yourself in a position
[34:41] you can do more works for God like take
[34:44] less land brother so you have more time
[34:45] for the word of God that's your
[34:47] testimony amen that's a beautiful
[34:49] testimony of God's
[34:51] grace now Sister Lydia uh 1 Corinthians
[34:55] 15:10 I want you to see Paul says he
[34:57] labored more than any other apostle that
[34:59] means Paul worked harder than Peter you
[35:01] know that Paul worked harder than James
[35:04] John Bartholomew uh Thomas Thomas he
[35:07] even though he doubted don't feel bad
[35:09] about Thomas Thomas took the gospel
[35:11] further than anybody else don't don't
[35:13] don't let anybody say anything bad about
[35:14] Thomas because you would have doubted
[35:16] too Peter doubted John doubt they all
[35:19] doubted right that's not bad MTH Thomas
[35:24] like we're somebody special like we we
[35:25] believed everything every time no matter
[35:27] what
[35:28] nonsense we did it we needed God's grace
[35:32] amen but look at this verse what caused
[35:35] Paul to work harder than everybody else
[35:37] for Jesus go and read it s but by thece
[35:40] of God I am what I am and
[35:46] his
[35:50] abant with me and the church
[35:54] said what caused Paul to work harder he
[35:56] went on three Miss missionary trips he
[35:58] was beaten numerous times whipped uh
[36:01] three times Shipwrecked five times what
[36:04] caused him to keep laboring it was God's
[36:06] grace in other words the Holy Spirit
[36:07] saying keep going Paul keep pressing
[36:09] through there's more for you to do don't
[36:11] get distracted don't don't feel bad keep
[36:14] laboring it's my grace that's with you
[36:17] Hallelujah see that see grace will teach
[36:20] you to deny sin and then Grace will
[36:22] cause you to labor more for
[36:24] Jesus Hallelujah and remember Church
[36:28] there is no condemnation to you because
[36:30] you're in Christ
[36:33] Jesus when you if God forbid we should
[36:35] pass away before the rapure or something
[36:37] you will not receive condemnation you
[36:39] will receive Mercy because you're a
[36:42] child of God because you're in Christ
[36:44] Jesus there is no condemnation Jesus
[36:47] says if you believe you've already
[36:49] passed from Death unto life Hallelujah
[36:53] you've already passed from Death un life
[36:55] Hallelujah because you believe in Jesus
[36:57] Jesus Christ amen how many believe that
[37:02] Hallelujah this is God's grace and
[37:04] remember brother said my message is step
[37:07] up these three steps I wish I had three
[37:08] chairs like this i' go I'd go one two
[37:11] three one two three and I'm going to
[37:14] walk the gospel highway I'm going to
[37:16] walk a holy life because I've walked
[37:18] these I've already raised these three
[37:19] steps and I can walk this way because
[37:21] I'm walking the King's Highway
[37:24] Hallelujah and I don't have high heels
[37:25] on either Hallelujah
[37:29] now Church there's so many Bible
[37:30] Witnesses I have a whole chapter on this
[37:33] in my book The 2021 mystery
[37:37] book see every process there's many
[37:40] processes that have three works right
[37:42] first work second word third word so
[37:44] when a baby's born I've seen it eight
[37:46] times my wife's had eight babies I was
[37:48] there for all eight I didn't pass out I
[37:49] got close to passing out because I like
[37:51] seeing blood but I was I saw all eight
[37:54] by God's grace what happens first the
[37:56] water breaks and we're like oh my the
[37:57] baby's on the way better get ready and
[38:01] then there's a bloody show or blood
[38:03] right I forget what my wife says you
[38:05] need to correct that I think I corrected
[38:06] it there's some blood she's always good
[38:08] at correcting me amen did you know
[38:10] brother said that my wife is my
[38:12] correction you know brother said
[38:14] that he said sister ma is my she's my
[38:18] correction he said you know you Brothers
[38:19] know what I'm talking
[38:21] about I said Amen brother R if I was
[38:24] ever Hallelujah brother R see my wife
[38:27] she always corrects me I love it that's
[38:29] why I need her she's the other part of
[38:31] me Hallelujah I'm only part of me right
[38:33] she's the other half of me I need to be
[38:36] corrected so not only did God give me
[38:38] the Holy Ghost he gave me the Holy Ghost
[38:39] and my wife to correct me I love it amen
[38:43] and then and then the last thing is the
[38:45] baby takes the breath of life you know
[38:47] once it's born the Breath of Life comes
[38:50] in that first breath so there's three
[38:52] stages to a natural birth friends
[38:54] brother R said there's three stages to
[38:56] the spiritual birth amen
[38:58] justification sanctification baptism of
[39:00] the Holy
[39:01] Ghost when Israel left they had to leave
[39:04] Egypt through the water that's
[39:08] baptism then the Wilderness then they
[39:11] got to the promised land amen then the
[39:13] Cross Jordan into the promised land
[39:15] three Works Hallelujah three stages of
[39:18] the
[39:19] journey and the Tabernacle Moses and
[39:22] also Solomon and also David had a
[39:24] tabernacle too it was cleansed by three
[39:26] things had to be cleansed the blood had
[39:28] to be in the outer Court then the blood
[39:30] had to be in the Holy Holy place then
[39:32] the blood had to be in the Hol of holies
[39:34] amen three
[39:35] steps three places to cleanse it and the
[39:38] church
[39:39] said let me show you that uh this might
[39:41] help you here let me
[39:44] uh I I just was looking here I thought
[39:47] well maybe this will help the
[39:49] Saints now this this has a couple
[39:52] different a couple different tracks here
[39:53] here's uh Israel leaving ramsy you know
[39:56] or Egypt this is the traditional way
[39:58] this blue way some people think that's
[39:59] the blue
[40:01] way uh the alternate way is they come
[40:04] this way the dotted line and then they
[40:06] went up here either way it doesn't
[40:08] matter there's three steps the first
[40:09] step was leaving and crossing the uh the
[40:12] Red Sea here right first step Second
[40:15] Step they either went all the way to KES
[40:17] Baria then they rejected it then they
[40:19] keep going around around and then Joshua
[40:21] finally let him over there's Jericho
[40:23] over the Jordan River okay but there's
[40:25] still three steps right one getting out
[40:28] of Egypt
[40:30] two three getting in the promised land
[40:33] and the church said am does that helpful
[40:35] there's only three steps you got to get
[40:36] out of Egypt you got to get out of sin
[40:38] you got to get out of your your
[40:39] worldliness you got to get Sanctified in
[40:41] the wilderness amen and and and Moses
[40:44] said God told Moses I'm going to prove
[40:46] you in the
[40:47] wilderness see that's what
[40:49] sanctification is it's Proving Grounds
[40:51] do you want to be filled with the Holy
[40:52] Ghost are you willing to be cleaned out
[40:55] are you willing to go all the way and if
[40:56] you're willing to go all the way God
[40:58] will bring you into the promised land
[41:00] God will bring you into the promise of
[41:01] the baptism of the Holy
[41:03] Ghost glory
[41:06] amen everybody see that you got three
[41:09] steps leaving Egypt Wilderness crossing
[41:12] over into
[41:13] Jordan into the promised land okay
[41:17] everybody's really do a good doing a
[41:18] good job paying attention here today now
[41:21] the Earth is brother said the Earth this
[41:22] is in the future home brother said the
[41:24] Earth is cleansed with three things
[41:26] Noah's flood water second Jesus blood on
[41:30] Calvary and third the fervent heat right
[41:33] that burns up the outside of the Earth
[41:35] by it doesn't destroy the Earth it just
[41:36] burns up the outside so then Jesus can
[41:38] step on it because now it's clean and
[41:41] now he can he can he can live on the
[41:43] earth because now all the sin is burned
[41:45] off of
[41:46] it so even the Earth is cleansed in
[41:48] three steps just like you're cleansed in
[41:50] three steps amen now we read ezekiel's
[41:54] prophecy new heart new spirit my spirit
[41:56] or God God spe ever see that this is a
[42:00] Bible Revelation and this proves again
[42:02] brother irin that we've got the
[42:03] revelation we have thus sayith the Lord
[42:05] out of the Bible all these other
[42:06] churches outside the message they don't
[42:08] have it they might have some ideas like
[42:09] some of them will be believe like oh
[42:11] this is
[42:12] tongues if you speak in tongues and
[42:14] you're filled with the Holy Ghost no
[42:15] I've met a lot of people that spoke in
[42:17] tongues that aren't born again like I
[42:19] told you Cam and Simon when we first got
[42:20] saved we went to a church our church uh
[42:23] it's Assemblies of God Pentecostal
[42:24] Church there was this one kid in the
[42:26] youth group was probably 22 21 he spoke
[42:29] in tongues all the time he said he had
[42:30] the Holy Ghost he would go in the church
[42:33] uh kitchen he would steal the the metal
[42:37] forks out of there and then he would
[42:39] bend them and make them like in these
[42:40] strange shapes and then he would go sell
[42:42] them and make money now you tell me
[42:45] that's just like Judas steal
[42:47] money see tongues can't be the evidence
[42:50] and then I love Hebrew or 1 Corinthians
[42:52] 12 said do all speak with tongues of
[42:54] course not do all work miracles are all
[42:56] apostles are all missionaries are all
[42:58] pastors are all teachers no but God has
[43:01] given to us the gifts as it please him
[43:03] not as it pleases us as it pleases him
[43:07] Hallelujah so we must find how God wants
[43:10] us to please him not what pleases us but
[43:13] what pleases God hallelujah I've asked
[43:16] God to speak in tongues I've never
[43:17] spoken tongues but I've but I have cast
[43:19] out Devils I have prayed for the sick
[43:22] and they've recovered Hallelujah I have
[43:24] had dreams and they came to pass so is
[43:27] my wife but is is somebody better cuz
[43:30] they spoke in tongues than somebody who
[43:32] had a dream or someone who prayed for
[43:33] the sick no we're all part of the same
[43:35] body Hallelujah we all I thank God for
[43:39] it I'd like to know what it likes to
[43:41] speak in tongues but the Bible said it
[43:43] just makes you feel better it just
[43:44] edifies you if you speak in Tong right
[43:47] well I who doesn't want to feel
[43:49] good I like to feel
[43:51] good but if if God don't want me to do
[43:54] it then I I don't want to do it praise
[43:56] God you know when I was younger I'll
[43:58] tell you the story when we were younger
[44:00] in our assembly God church I was
[44:01] probably eight or nine or 10 right and
[44:03] they they'd have week long revivals like
[44:05] service Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[44:06] Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday one
[44:08] night they invited all my brothers like
[44:10] cam cam Simon me we all come up and they
[44:12] all laid hands on us and brother they
[44:14] were shaking us like this fill them with
[44:15] the Holy Ghost fill them with the Holy
[44:17] Ghost and the guy's like Jesse just
[44:19] whisper I love you Jesus just keep
[44:21] saying I love you Jesus I love you Jesus
[44:22] and that's what I did I said I love you
[44:24] I started crying because all the people
[44:25] are shouting and the music's pumping and
[44:27] I'm like I feel I feel the anointing I
[44:30] feel something here and I started
[44:32] talking so fast like Jesus Jesus that I
[44:34] I I muttered a few words that didn't
[44:36] make sense and they're like oh he's
[44:37] smoking tongues he's fill with the Holy
[44:39] Ghost after the prayer I I I got out my
[44:42] sucker that I had in my pants and I was
[44:45] crying but I ran back out and played
[44:46] baseball with the kids I didn't even
[44:48] stay in to you know to worship God how
[44:52] could that be the Holy Ghost how could
[44:53] that be filling with the Holy Ghost it's
[44:55] not praise God it was a motion but I
[44:58] thought back to that thought wow see
[45:00] they just want to work you up to a
[45:01] tongue they just said they're seeking
[45:03] the gift instead of The
[45:05] Giver we have to seek The Giver of the
[45:08] gifts amen and then he gives the gifts
[45:10] as it Mak as it pleases him as he sees
[45:12] fit praise God was that okay that I
[45:14] shook you Budd you got I saw those
[45:16] strong shoulders brother I knew he could
[45:18] hand a little
[45:22] Shake oh God Shake us up tonight amen
[45:25] hallelujah stirs up by the Holy Spirit
[45:27] praise
[45:28] God Amen brother amen so see then Jesus
[45:33] gives us three ways the kingdom of God
[45:36] grows blade ear full corn justification
[45:40] sanctification baptis and I love this
[45:42] Jesus said I am the way the truth and
[45:46] the life I love it oh he he's basically
[45:49] saying I'm I'm the I'm the highway I'm
[45:52] the way of Holiness amen he's basically
[45:55] saying I am Isaiah 5:8 I'm the way the
[45:59] truth the life no man comes into the
[46:01] father except by me
[46:04] hallelujah oh I love
[46:06] it remember Jesus said in John 17:17
[46:10] sanctify them through thy truth Thy word
[46:12] is
[46:13] trueu see when when people get
[46:15] Sanctified they need more of the word
[46:17] teach them the word know the word they
[46:19] can get rid of their bad habits get rid
[46:20] of their sins and then once that cup is
[46:22] all clean then God can pour in his holy

[47:13] you and the life of the blood of the
[47:15] Holy Spirit fills
[47:16] you you're also in a covenant with God
[47:19] through the blood of Jesus Christ now
[47:22] what's a covenant it's a promise it's a
[47:24] oath I promise to live to Pure my wife I
[47:27] made a oath when I got married I didn't
[47:29] do this you know we got to do that in
[47:30] the courtroom you know but I promise
[47:33] Hallelujah and God promised that to you
[47:36] brother irin and sister wi Jesus said
[47:38] I'm going to give my blood I'm going to

[47:48] word oh the god of Heaven made a promise
[47:52] to you Hallelujah and you know God
[47:54] doesn't break his promise Hallelujah
[47:57] there's so much Power in the Blood of
[47:59] Jesus Christ it brings us into the
[48:01] Covenant as I preached last time the
[48:03] Waters of Separation when God when you
[48:05] repent of your sins God sprinkles that
[48:07] anointing on you and that that's what
[48:09] brought Moses in into the Covenant with
[48:11] the people remember he sprinkled the
[48:13] blood on them at Mount Si remember that
[48:16] he said you're joined he said I don't
[48:18] mean to do this in your face he said but
[48:20] he said you're joined under the Covenant
[48:22] he would actually sprinkle them and they
[48:23] they would get hit with blood and that
[48:26] blood when got hit okay now now the
[48:28] covenant's on me now I'm joined now I'm
[48:30] a part of the Covenant and see s Saints
[48:33] when you confess your sins and you
[48:34] repented and I baptized most of you in
[48:36] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you
[48:37] were brought into Covenant with God
[48:40] Almighty and God will keep his promise
[48:43] to you God will bring you to the Rapture
[48:45] God will bring you up the three steps
[48:47] he'll help you walk that Highway of
[48:48] Holiness and then the Gates of Heaven
[48:50] will open for you and I
[48:52] Hallelujah CU God's covenant cannot fail
[48:55] Hallelujah
[48:57] in order for the Covenant to fail the
[48:59] blood would have to be wrong blood and
[49:01] it wasn't wrong blood it was Holy Blood
[49:03] amen it was the blood of God's own son
[49:06] hallelujah amen church we are more
[49:09] secure than we even imagine our
[49:12] Salvation is more secure than we can
[49:14] possibly imagine Jesus said no man
[49:17] brother Daniel can pluck you out of the
[49:18] hand of
[49:20] God Amen I got to preach a whole sermon
[49:23] on that maybe next week I or maybe in
[49:24] two weeks
[49:26] go to Second Peter chapter uh 1 second
[49:29] Peter chapter 1 now I gave you just the
[49:32] general way of the three works of Grace
[49:35] Peter gives you a more detailed look at
[49:38] it second Peter chapter 1 I need some
[49:41] readers here if you got your
[49:43] Bible I'm already at 50 minutes so I
[49:46] don't I don't know we'll see brother
[49:47] irin gave me said just go ahead and
[49:49] preach it so I might just do that preach
[49:51] a little bit longer here tonight by
[49:52] God's grace Hallelujah
[49:57] look at verse three according to his
[49:59] divine power has given unto us all
[50:01] things everybody say all things ready
[50:03] all God's already given you all things
[50:05] that pertain unto life on this Earth and
[50:09] godliness whatever you need to be more
[50:11] Godly God's already given it to you but
[50:12] it's by promise and you got to accept
[50:15] the
[50:16] promise see through the knowledge of him
[50:18] that called you that called us to glory
[50:21] and virtue look at verse four whereby
[50:22] are given unto us exceeding great and
[50:24] precious promises
[50:26] that by these you might be partakers of
[50:28] the divine nature having escaped the
[50:31] corruption that is in the world through
[50:32] lust there's a serpent seed verse right
[50:35] sin is in the world through
[50:37] lust Eve didn't lust after an apple like
[50:40] oh I want to love that Apple it
[50:42] wasn't no it was it was sexual lust
[50:47] right with with the serpent that's why
[50:49] God said eve you're desires now to your
[50:51] husband not to the serpent remember that
[50:55] and now I'm going to punish you now
[50:56] you're going to bring for seed and and
[50:58] and pain because you received the wrong
[51:00] seed now you're going to bring forth the
[51:01] seed with pain
[51:04] Hallelujah that's right church that's
[51:07] right but see that you're giving great
[51:10] precious
[51:11] promises and when you receive the
[51:13] promise you become a partaker of the
[51:15] Holy Ghost a partaker of God's divine
[51:18] nature okay now here's a picture for you
[51:21] up
[51:22] here in 1962 brother Ram taught this
[51:25] sermon he called this the stature of a
[51:27] perfect man if you haven't listened to
[51:28] it you need to listen to it it's a
[51:29] beautiful
[51:31] message and this is what Peter teaches
[51:33] now let's look at verse uh
[51:37] five verse
[51:39] five it says and beside this giving all
[51:42] diligence see grace will make you be
[51:45] diligent add to your faith what church
[51:47] what do you let's say together add to
[51:48] your faith
[51:50] what now Faith is a substance of things
[51:52] hoped for it's an Evidence of Things Not
[51:54] Seen that's what you need to get saved
[51:56] where saved by grace through what
[51:58] through that's the first that's the
[52:00] first anointing you get when you confess
[52:02] your sins and you're Justified but then
[52:04] you get virtue now virtue just means
[52:06] strength and in the Bible Ruth was known
[52:09] for virtue why because she was out with
[52:11] the men and yet she stayed true she
[52:13] didn't go running after the guys and oh
[52:14] I can marry another
[52:16] guy she lived it publicly and so that's
[52:19] what virtue is when you can live Glory
[52:21] when you can live the gospel in front in
[52:23] front of your former church
[52:25] friends when you can just publicly stand
[52:27] up and say I don't believe that anymore
[52:28] I believe the word of God now you've got
[52:30] virtue because that's what Ruth had Ruth
[52:33] said I'm not running around with you
[52:34] young boys I'm going to wait for God's
[52:36] man for me that was Boaz Hallelujah she
[52:40] could have run run around and chase
[52:41] those young guys no she had virtue and
[52:44] the whole city knew she had virtue amen
[52:46] your whole family will know youve got
[52:48] the virtue of God when you stand on
[52:50] God's word
[52:52] hallelujah that's right then the Bible
[52:55] said add to your virtue what
[52:57] knowledge means a deep Christian
[52:59] understanding you understand the word of
[53:01] God now see that's an anointing a lot of
[53:04] people don't understand why do why
[53:05] shouldn't women cut their hair why
[53:07] shouldn't men smoke cigarettes why
[53:09] shouldn't men cuss why can't we go see
[53:11] movies they don't understand it takes an
[53:14] anointing of the Holy Ghost to give them
[53:16] that but you got it how many got it
[53:18] tonight by God Amen I understand God's
[53:21] ways I understand his three steps I
[53:23] understand the Highway of Holiness amen
[53:25] I understand jusic sanctification
[53:27] baptism the Holy Ghost I have an
[53:29] understanding I understand God's
[53:32] ways I know something like I'm crazy but
[53:34] I'm not I'm just crazy for Jesus
[53:36] okay and after you get knowledge then
[53:38] what comes next Temperance that means
[53:41] control over sensual bodily passions so
[53:44] it could be food or it could be sexual
[53:46] Temptation okay anything your flesh or
[53:49] body wants like well I really want that
[53:51] McDonald's like I told you last I don't
[53:53] know if I told you I got to drive by
[53:54] McDonald's and say I rebuke you
[53:55] McDonald's in the name of Jesus Jesus
[53:57] right I used to be addicted to Dr Pepper
[53:59] but now I walk by Dr Pepper I said I
[54:01] rebuke you Dr Pepper in the name of
[54:02] Jesus cuz it's going to give me diabetes
[54:05] if I keep drinking it I don't want
[54:06] diabetes but said the diabetes is a
[54:09] chemical problem it's not some Demon
[54:11] it's you you ate too much sugar and the
[54:14] church
[54:15] said I can give you the quote if you
[54:17] want it my my wife found that one again
[54:20] my wife helping me out praise
[54:22] God I love my wife amen you see that's
[54:26] why people fall in sexual sin sometime
[54:28] because they don't have that anointing
[54:29] of temperance all these preachers this
[54:31] year that have fallen in sexual sin it
[54:33] proves they don't have that anointing
[54:35] that's why they fall see because they're
[54:37] not look they're not Sanctified they
[54:39] might be saved like like David right
[54:43] David he he he David could never get
[54:45] this in the Old Testament so the highest
[54:46] he could get was up
[54:48] here but when he lost that anointing
[54:50] here he fell right here you can gain
[54:53] these anointings and lose these
[54:54] anointings in your mind
[54:57] you okay I'll proove it to you I approve
[55:01] it to you
[55:03] uh getting a good lesson here tonight by
[55:05] God's
[55:12] grace yep if you got your Bible go to
[55:15] Luke
[55:17] 22 uh 31 Luke 2231 I'm going prove it to
[55:24] you Luke 22
[55:27] 31 see this is where people fall in
[55:30] sexual sin or they overeat like
[55:33] Eli right and Eli's Sons remember Eli
[55:35] was
[55:36] overweight this is where he
[55:39] struggled and his sons remember they
[55:41] were sleeping with women they were
[55:42] married but they had adulterous Affairs
[55:44] this is where they failed they never got
[55:46] this
[55:47] anointing Church Peter wrote this by the
[55:49] Holy Ghost how many believe that amen
[55:52] the Holy Ghost says start with faith and
[55:53] then add to it God give me more
[55:55] anointing how many say that tonight God
[55:57] anoint me more with more power more love
[55:59] amen Lord I I need a fresh anointing of
[56:03] patience I need a fresh anointing of
[56:06] temperance I need a fresh anointing of
[56:08] godliness or brotherly kindness I'm
[56:10] talking about in your mind now the first
[56:12] time you go through this is the first
[56:14] time you get the baptism of the Holy
[56:15] Ghost in your soul but then your mind
[56:17] needs continually Sanctified how many
[56:19] know that how many know your mind needs
[56:21] continually
[56:22] Sanctified you don't always think the
[56:24] right things I don't always think the
[56:26] right
[56:28] things but this is but the first time
[56:30] you go through this you get those
[56:31] anointings you get sealed with the Holy
[56:33] Ghost in your soul but then you got to
[56:36] keep Sanctified that's why Jesus said I
[56:38] sanctify myself for their sakes the
[56:40] night he was arrested how many remember
[56:42] that the night he was arrested he said
[56:45] he said oh Father I sanctify myself for
[56:47] their sakes because the preachers were
[56:49] going to abandon him in just a few
[56:52] hours see even Jesus had to make sure
[56:54] his mind was sanctified
[56:57] it was set aside it was focused on the
[56:59] word of God that's what Jesus said now
[57:02] Jesus never sinned right but he he had a
[57:04] record he still had a human will
[57:06] remember he prayed God take this cup
[57:07] from me what he had a human mind he had
[57:11] he had a human desires Lord take this
[57:13] cup from me but if it if it be possible
[57:15] but if not let thy will be done the man
[57:19] said he didn't want to die he want to
[57:21] stay he he wanted to stay there with his
[57:22] disciples he didn't want to die but he
[57:25] had to overcome that you overcome that
[57:26] by the word of God by prayer that's how
[57:29] you'll overcome Church in your hardest
[57:31] battles God might drive you to the
[57:33] prayer closet so you can overcome your
[57:36] trials
[57:39] Hallelujah all right now stay there in
[57:42] Luke 22 but okay next is
[57:44] patience right after you get control
[57:46] over your flesh and over your desires
[57:48] then God has to give you patience
[57:51] Hallelujah and brother Ram said the
[57:52] first thing is patience with God do you
[57:54] know brother R said that stat your
[57:57] perfect man brother says what's the
[57:58] first thing you need to be patient with
[57:59] God like God where's all my answers to
[58:01] all my prayers where's all my blessings
[58:03] the church
[58:04] said God I want this where is it God I
[58:06] want that I prayed about that last year
[58:08] where is it and God said he's got to
[58:10] teach you patience with
[58:12] God because remember church God is not
[58:14] your Aaron boy okay I'll go do this
[58:17] brother Jesse okay what else you need
[58:18] brother Jesse I'll go do this he's not
[58:20] your Aaron boy he does what he wants he
[58:23] said prayer is to change your mind not
[58:25] God's mind
[58:27] mind right we want everything that we
[58:29] want at one time and God said no God
[58:32] said I'll do what's best for you I'll do
[58:34] my will not your
[58:36] will but ra said prayer changes your
[58:40] mind
[58:41] Hallelujah and then godliness is being
[58:43] like God reverence and brother says
[58:46] that's loving that's loving the
[58:48] unlovable loving your enemies how many
[58:51] know it takes a special anointing to
[58:52] love your enemies amen that's godliness
[58:55] like like uh Jesus said God sends his
[58:58] Reign on the just the good people and
[59:01] the
[59:01] unjust that's being like God he said
[59:04] then if if you're good to those that are
[59:05] mean to you now you're the children of
[59:07] God now you're the children because
[59:10] you're like God hallelujah praise God
[59:14] and then brotherly kindness is the last
[59:15] anointing see before God gives his
[59:17] people the Holy Ghost brother Urban he's
[59:19] got to make sure they got the anointing
[59:21] to treat other people in the church the
[59:23] right way God's not going to give you
[59:25] the Holy Ghost you're going to mistreat
[59:26] the church the church
[59:29] say he's got to give you the anointing
[59:32] of Brotherly kindness I'm kind to my
[59:33] brother oh I'm so sorry but I didn't
[59:35] mean to rub your shoulders too hard
[59:37] forgive
[59:38] me all
[59:40] right Y in other words when you you do
[59:43] something wrong with somebody in the
[59:44] church you go oh I'm so sorry that's my
[59:47] fault I didn't mean to do that how many
[59:48] times have I to do that as a pastor I
[59:50] got to say Church you I'm sorry I
[59:52] preached the wrong thing you know
[59:54] forgive me or I'm sorry sorry I forgot
[59:56] to tell you about this I forgot to
[59:58] announce that you know forgive me I was
[1:00:00] a little harsh here forgive me I didn't
[1:00:02] mean to do
[1:00:03] that how many times I got to apologize
[1:00:05] to my wife that's like a hundred times
[1:00:07] you know all the
[1:00:09] time I'm just not perfect I don't think
[1:00:11] like a woman amen I think like a man
[1:00:14] because of that I'm insensitive and I
[1:00:16] sin sometimes and I need God's help to
[1:00:18] overcome that praise God that's right
[1:00:22] and then brother said after that God
[1:00:23] will cap you off God will seal you
[1:00:27] another word he says is vulcanize you or
[1:00:29] weld you he'll weld his holy ghost he'll
[1:00:31] put the holy ghost in your soul and then
[1:00:33] you're seal to the day of your
[1:00:35] Redemption praise God so see this is the
[1:00:38] three works of Grace with more detail
[1:00:40] Peter gives us more detail Peter can't
[1:00:42] change what Ezekiel said Peter's not
[1:00:45] going to change that Peter's not going
[1:00:47] to change uh what Jesus said the three
[1:00:50] steps of the wheat no this just gives
[1:00:52] you more
[1:00:54] detail see brother UR you got the Holy
[1:00:56] Ghost brother this is what God did you
[1:00:57] didn't even know just like the farmer
[1:00:59] Glory the farmer just went to bed he
[1:01:00] didn't know what was happening you just
[1:01:02] drew you just kept drawing night to God
[1:01:04] and God kept giving you more anointing
[1:01:06] all the time and then that one day then
[1:01:08] you got the Holy Ghost amen amen that
[1:01:12] one day then the wheat grain was finally
[1:01:14] mature now can be harvested now can be
[1:01:17] used for the glory of God hallelujah I
[1:01:20] didn't know I was going to preach this
[1:01:20] hard tonight I'm enjoying this more than
[1:01:22] I thought I would praise God like
[1:01:24] brother I finally feel like preaching
[1:01:25] preaching I'm starting to feel religious
[1:01:28] now
[1:01:29] Hallelujah all right everybody got that
[1:01:32] now now you can go so in depth with this
[1:01:35] this is what I did in my
[1:01:36] book faith is a substance needed to
[1:01:39] choose the right way uh virtue is the
[1:01:41] strength needed to daily walk in the way
[1:01:44] publicly knowledge is the understanding
[1:01:46] needed to know why you must Walk This
[1:01:47] Way Temperance is the self-control
[1:01:49] needed to remain on this way patience is
[1:01:53] the steadfastness needed to be content
[1:01:55] on this way
[1:01:57] godliness is reverence need to be just
[1:01:59] like God on this way talk about the
[1:02:01] three steps of Grace brother kindness is
[1:02:04] selflessness needed to live for others
[1:02:07] on this way and the presence of God is
[1:02:10] needed to completely manifest the living
[1:02:12] Christ on this way amen
[1:02:18] hallelujah now and church now now now
[1:02:22] now imagine the pyramid flipped upside
[1:02:23] down the first thing you get is faith
[1:02:26] but what do you have to reject first to
[1:02:28] over to get Faith you got to reject
[1:02:30] unbelief you have to overcome the
[1:02:32] opposite sin in order to get the right
[1:02:34] anointing so if you want virtue you got
[1:02:36] to you got to overcome
[1:02:38] hypocrisy if you want knowledge you got
[1:02:40] to overcome human reasoning like Eve in
[1:02:42] the garden oh yeah surely if I eat it I
[1:02:45] won't die I'll be just like God that's
[1:02:47] human
[1:02:48] reasoning if you want Temperance you got
[1:02:50] to overcome
[1:02:52] sensuality giving your flesh and body
[1:02:54] whatever it wants you got to overcome
[1:02:56] that by the Holy Spirit if you want
[1:02:58] patience you got to understand haste do
[1:03:00] everything quickly I need it now I got I
[1:03:02] got to have it now God God's like no you
[1:03:04] need to overcome haste you need to be
[1:03:06] patient if you want godliness you got to
[1:03:09] overcome being irreverent not
[1:03:10] recognizing God God's all around us you
[1:03:13] got to live a respectful
[1:03:15] life if you want brotherly kindness you
[1:03:17] got to overcome selfishness if you want
[1:03:19] the Holy Ghost you got to overcome
[1:03:20] resisting brother said people don't get
[1:03:21] the Holy Ghost because they they don't
[1:03:23] open themselves up and just let God fill
[1:03:25] them and then praise
[1:03:27] God all right okay now you got Luke 21
[1:03:31] or I'm sorry Luke
[1:03:33] 22:31 uh sister Ruth you got that could
[1:03:35] you read uh why don't you read 31 and 32
[1:03:38] sister

[1:04:00] is the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:02] Ghost you don't he's saying you're not
[1:04:04] converted yet your Soul's not born again
[1:04:06] yet but what did he pray he said I pray
[1:04:08] that what doesn't fail your faith that
[1:04:12] night later that night he was going to
[1:04:14] deny Jesus three times so look and and
[1:04:17] church he had he had all this he had all
[1:04:19] this virtue right he's like Jesus I
[1:04:20] won't deny you I won't deny you but he
[1:04:24] lost that virtue because of
[1:04:27] fear but Jesus said don't worry Peter I
[1:04:30] prayed for you that you don't lose your
[1:04:32] faith amen hallelujah so Peter lost all
[1:04:36] this anointing right he Lo he had
[1:04:38] different levels of this anointing
[1:04:39] throughout his ministry before he got
[1:04:41] the Holy Ghost but that night on Jesus
[1:04:43] rest he lost his virtue he couldn't
[1:04:44] stand up for Jesus but Jesus said don't
[1:04:46] worry I pray for you in my prayer I know
[1:04:49] God will hear my prayer
[1:04:52] Hallelujah brother ra says that Peter
[1:04:54] wasn't brother said Peter didn't even
[1:04:56] put on the full armor of God until the
[1:04:58] day of Pentecost remember Ephesians 6
[1:05:00] the armor of God man said he didn't even
[1:05:03] have on the armor till he got to
[1:05:04] Pentecost then he had the sword then he
[1:05:07] had the shield then he had the helmet
[1:05:09] then he had the breastplate then he had
[1:05:10] the feet shot and then he had the belt
[1:05:12] of truth hallelujah he got that when he
[1:05:15] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost other
[1:05:16] words you and I are not mature soldiers
[1:05:18] until we're born again and we can walk
[1:05:20] on that Highway Hallelujah I know I'm
[1:05:23] laying a lot in here how many enjoying
[1:05:24] this tonight by God's grace I feel like
[1:05:26] I'm tying the whole Bible together
[1:05:27] tonight you
[1:05:28] know I know I'm not but I feel like it
[1:05:31] Glory it's a beautiful Revelation no see
[1:05:34] brother I was raised in church my whole
[1:05:35] life I never heard nothing like this
[1:05:37] that's how I know this is the message it
[1:05:39] ties the Bible together it finishes the
[1:05:41] mystery of God it takes out all the
[1:05:43] questions as brother said the Holy Ghost
[1:05:45] dissolves all of our doubts amen that
[1:05:47] way we know we're in the truth for this
[1:05:49] hour
[1:05:51] Hallelujah I'm sorry sisters I'm
[1:05:52] spitting all over your floor you know
[1:05:56] forgive me if you want me to wipe it up
[1:05:57] give me a towel after service I don't
[1:06:00] mean to spit on your floor I just can't
[1:06:01] help it I just get so excited
[1:06:05] sometime Hallelujah all right now
[1:06:08] there's five
[1:06:10] examples Peter's one of them now I'm
[1:06:13] just for time sake Saints I just got to
[1:06:15] go through these quickly okay it's
[1:06:17] already hour and
[1:06:19] six I have a video about this if you
[1:06:22] want a link you know some somebody text
[1:06:23] me I'll send I got a whole video on this
[1:06:25] teaching the whole thing there's at
[1:06:27] least five examples Peter's the first
[1:06:28] one Peter was saved before he got the
[1:06:30] Holy Ghost
[1:06:32] right and Jesus said you got the keys of
[1:06:35] the kingdom and he wasn't even born
[1:06:36] again
[1:06:37] yet see he's already saved and the Bible
[1:06:40] said Jesus didn't baptize anybody when
[1:06:42] he was on Earth the disciples baptized
[1:06:43] him well what does baptism mean you got
[1:06:46] saved so Peter had to First be baptized
[1:06:48] then he could baptize all the other ones
[1:06:50] so he was already saved but he didn't
[1:06:52] have the Holy Ghost so Acts 2 ver4
[1:06:55] you see that church look at this he
[1:06:57] walked on water and he didn't have the
[1:06:59] Holy Ghost in his
[1:07:00] soul Hallelujah he could walk on
[1:07:05] water
[1:07:09] go see that that proves you know people
[1:07:11] can do Miracles and not be born again
[1:07:13] remember Paul said you can understand
[1:07:15] all the Mysteries you can give your bod
[1:07:16] as a sacrifice to be burned you can give
[1:07:18] away all your goods but if you don't
[1:07:19] have charity you don't have nothing you
[1:07:21] need the love of God you can speak every
[1:07:24] M you can speak Every Mountain out of
[1:07:26] existence you know you could you can do
[1:07:27] all these things but if you don't have
[1:07:29] God's love it doesn't profit you
[1:07:33] anything Mary remember in Luke chapter 1
[1:07:36] uh Mary got the word uh about I'm sorry
[1:07:39] Mary uh met her her sister-in-law
[1:07:42] Elizabeth and remember she sang that
[1:07:44] song remember the The Babe leaped in uh
[1:07:47] her womb uh Elizabeth's womb when it
[1:07:49] talk about Jesus and Mary said I rejoice
[1:07:52] in God my savior how many remember that
[1:07:54] verse she's already saved she's a 16y
[1:07:57] old virgin with a baby now around 16 and
[1:08:00] she said I'm already
[1:08:02] saved and look at that church she was in
[1:08:04] justification and sanctification for
[1:08:06] over 30 some years till Jesus was born
[1:08:09] raised lived died resurrected and then
[1:08:11] the day of Pentecost think of that
[1:08:13] brother John she was in sanctification
[1:08:15] for over 30 years so Church don't be
[1:08:17] discouraged if you're waiting to get the
[1:08:18] Holy Ghost you're going to get
[1:08:21] it I was hoping for a little more amens
[1:08:23] than that you're going to get the Holy
[1:08:25] Ghost
[1:08:26] Hallelujah better amen glory she had to
[1:08:29] wait 30 years
[1:08:31] amen just keep trusting in God God has a
[1:08:34] time and season for everything
[1:08:38] Hallelujah now of course she couldn't
[1:08:39] get it because Jesus had it wasn't
[1:08:41] glorified yet that's what John 7: 37-39
[1:08:44] says remember uh the Holy Ghost couldn't
[1:08:47] yet be given until Jesus was glorified
[1:08:49] remember that
[1:08:50] verse okay that meant in the soul they
[1:08:53] couldn't have the Holy Ghost in the soul
[1:08:54] till Jesus was B was dead raised and now
[1:08:56] he's in a glorified body now the day of
[1:08:58] Pentecost can
[1:09:01] happen all right now these already went
[1:09:03] over the last I've already gone two
[1:09:05] there's five examples I've done two of
[1:09:07] them Peter
[1:09:08] Mary the third one is the Samaritans and
[1:09:11] I preached this a while ago but remember
[1:09:12] the Samaritan story Philip goes down
[1:09:14] there preaches Christ to them they get
[1:09:16] baptized but they said we're not filled
[1:09:18] with the Holy Ghost they were only
[1:09:19] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:21] let's go call Peter and John to pray for
[1:09:23] them remember that then Peter and John
[1:09:26] come to Samaria and they pray and then
[1:09:28] the Bible said they're filled with the
[1:09:30] Holy
[1:09:30] Ghost so there's a third example you're
[1:09:33] saved first Sanctified and then filled
[1:09:36] with the Holy Ghost everybody see that
[1:09:38] church this Bible is Rock
[1:09:40] Solomon this Bible has one
[1:09:43] Revelation amen this Bible only has one
[1:09:46] interpretation and that's the
[1:09:47] interpretation of the Holy
[1:09:49] Ghost amen and the Holy Ghost gave that
[1:09:52] to brother Bram amen
[1:09:55] like I tell people I've been on YouTube
[1:09:57] 11 years and not one person can disprove
[1:09:59] the three works of Grace the serpent
[1:10:01] seed the godhead the water baptism not
[1:10:03] one of them can do it and it's not
[1:10:05] because of me it's because God gave us
[1:10:07] the revelation of the word of God the
[1:10:09] Gates of Hell won't Prevail against this
[1:10:11] Revelation
[1:10:13] hallelujah hallelujah glory amen I feel
[1:10:17] religious amen I already said that amen
[1:10:19] I feel double religious
[1:10:21] amen acts 10 is Cornelius Cornelius was
[1:10:25] fasting praying giving
[1:10:27] alms and he hadn't been baptized yet but
[1:10:29] he knew about Jesus and then he had the
[1:10:31] dream go call Peter Peter comes Peter
[1:10:33] preaches a 5 minute sermon and the Holy
[1:10:35] Ghost Falls and the Bible said they were
[1:10:37] filled with the Holy Ghost even before
[1:10:39] they were baptized in water my sweet
[1:10:41] daughter asked me a few nights ago she
[1:10:43] said
[1:10:44] daddy she said Daddy we have I have to
[1:10:46] be baptized before I get the Holy Ghost
[1:10:48] right and I said no yeah I hate I hate
[1:10:51] to cck my children you know I said no
[1:10:53] hun I said cornelus they got the the
[1:10:55] Holy Ghost in their soul before they
[1:10:56] were baptized in water because the Jews
[1:10:58] weren't allowed to preach to them the
[1:10:59] Jews weren't allowed they they didn't
[1:11:01] know until God showed Peter the vision
[1:11:05] Hallelujah is that right they had nobody
[1:11:08] to baptize him they had no preachers to
[1:11:10] baptize him but then when God sent Peter
[1:11:12] there oh go Peter says I see God's not a
[1:11:15] respector of anybody amen hallelujah God
[1:11:17] gave me the vision amen don't call
[1:11:19] unclean what God has cleansed amen and
[1:11:22] while Peter preached the word the Holy
[1:11:24] Ghost fell and then they got the holy
[1:11:26] ghost appear said now who can forbid
[1:11:28] that these men should be baptized in
[1:11:30] water and the Bible said that hour they
[1:11:32] bury them in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:34] Christ amen hallelujah that's
[1:11:38] right so see people can get the Holy
[1:11:40] Ghost without even being baptized in the
[1:11:42] name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[1:11:43] Bible the truth or not
[1:11:45] Church
[1:11:48] absolutely it's entirely true there's no
[1:11:50] erors in the word of God the King James
[1:11:53] version is the best version It's the
[1:11:54] only version that I use just so you know
[1:11:56] that's a whole another sermon you
[1:11:59] know cuz all the other versions they
[1:12:02] start taking out verses and they start
[1:12:05] uh they start attacking message
[1:12:08] Doctrine yeah so I recommend only use a
[1:12:11] King James brother brand used a King
[1:12:13] James that's the only thing he used was
[1:12:15] a scoffield scoffield King James you
[1:12:18] don't have to have a scoffield but use
[1:12:19] the King James I've seen too much I have
[1:12:22] to show I have to show that I went I
[1:12:24] went through with my church I showed
[1:12:25] like 30 verses all these other versions
[1:12:27] take out they take out prayer and
[1:12:30] fasting they take out forgiveness they
[1:12:32] take out the water baptism they take out
[1:12:33] serpent seed they take all these things
[1:12:35] out of the of the Bible the devil knows
[1:12:37] what he's doing but also God knows what
[1:12:39] he's doing too amen all right let me try
[1:12:42] to close here uh the fifth and final one
[1:12:46] is Acts 19 so let's go to Acts 19 this
[1:12:50] is the one brother Ram says in the
[1:12:51] church age book this is thus sayith the
[1:12:53] Lord on the Holy Ghost and the three
[1:12:54] works of Grace
[1:12:55] Acts 19 verse I believe it's it's 1
[1:12:58] through 7 but we're not going to read
[1:12:59] all
[1:13:03] them verse two uh Acts 19 verse2 sister
[1:13:07] maram do you want to read that is that
[1:13:08] okay sister whenever you're
[1:13:20] ready Amen brother R uses this verse and
[1:13:23] the next verse is he says well then what
[1:13:24] were you baptized right oh John the
[1:13:26] Baptist he said that was for repentance
[1:13:29] but you got to be baptized to receive
[1:13:30] the Holy Ghost In The Name Of The Lord
[1:13:33] Jesus right this proves Apollos was
[1:13:36] already preaching remember read CH read
[1:13:38] chapter 18 when you have time Apollos
[1:13:39] was already proven Jesus was the Christ
[1:13:41] they were already Christians they they'
[1:13:43] already been baptized under John under
[1:13:44] the repentance they were saved
[1:13:46] Sanctified but they weren't filled with
[1:13:48] the Holy Ghost so they got the right
[1:13:49] baptism
[1:13:51] Hallelujah so church I just showed you
[1:13:53] five examples
[1:13:55] people have to go through the three
[1:13:57] works of Grace justification
[1:13:58] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:14:00] Holy Ghost brother said that's my
[1:14:04] message Hallelujah that's my message and
[1:14:07] my mom had a dream about it amen God
[1:14:10] showed her the
[1:14:11] dream all right I just got this last
[1:14:13] verse and then I'll take any questions
[1:14:15] and see if anyone has need of prayer
[1:14:17] okay let's go to Hebrews 6 1 Hebrews
[1:14:20] 61 Mah when you can you read it a little
[1:14:23] bit buddy would that be okay Hebrews

[1:14:39] sure you can do it buddy
[1:14:56] the
[1:15:00] ofm
[1:15:06] [Music]
[1:15:08] layre excellent buddy great reading all
[1:15:12] right everybody see this I'm trying to
[1:15:13] close I'm trying to close here by God's
[1:15:15] grace my wife knows that means about 15
[1:15:17] more minutes okay that's what she tells
[1:15:20] me sometimes
[1:15:23] 30 I'm like I'm sorry honey I got caught
[1:15:25] up in the Heavenly places she's like I
[1:15:27] know you always
[1:15:30] do but but Paul Paul says he says uh you
[1:15:34] have to leave the principles that means
[1:15:35] the elementary teachings and I know all
[1:15:37] about elementary I've taught 20 years in
[1:15:40] elementary Paul says you have to leave
[1:15:42] the early doctrines and move on to
[1:15:44] Perfection and you can only do this if
[1:15:46] God permits Perfection means maturity
[1:15:49] you can only go on let me go back
[1:15:51] there Paul says you have to leave you
[1:15:54] have to move on for from elementary
[1:15:55] things and go into
[1:15:57] maturity and you can only do that if God
[1:16:00] permits now do you see some of these
[1:16:03] look at some of these doctrines in here
[1:16:04] Paul lays
[1:16:05] out uh repentance from dead works now
[1:16:10] that ought that ought to make somebody
[1:16:12] say Amen most churches don't make you
[1:16:14] repent of
[1:16:15] sins that's what I was talking about
[1:16:17] earlier they let you commit adultery
[1:16:19] they let you smoke cuss drink watch
[1:16:21] filthy movies they let you go to uh
[1:16:24] parties they let you do drugs they don't
[1:16:26] care as long as you come to church and
[1:16:27] say you're sorry and keep paying ties
[1:16:30] and
[1:16:32] offerings see they don't they don't they
[1:16:35] can't move on because they never repent
[1:16:37] from dead Works they never in other
[1:16:39] words they don't get what they don't get
[1:16:41] Sanctified right they can't move on
[1:16:44] think of the church you guys used to be
[1:16:45] in they couldn't move on from the dead
[1:16:48] works right they kept bitterness right
[1:16:51] they kept lying remember lying brother
[1:16:52] you told me about that lying the
[1:16:54] gentleman were lying to you he where's
[1:16:57] his virtue where's his where's his
[1:16:58] knowledge though you don't
[1:17:00] lie you don't put people in
[1:17:03] bondage where's the understanding of the
[1:17:05] word of God they didn't move on to
[1:17:08] maturity they didn't move on to
[1:17:09] Perfection and they can only do it if
[1:17:11] God
[1:17:12] permits and the God will only permit you
[1:17:15] if you repent that's the only way God
[1:17:17] let you move on is if you repent of your
[1:17:19] sins amen and repent of your dead works
[1:17:22] that's why they can't move on brother
[1:17:26] sister they won't repent they won't even
[1:17:28] do the elementary things they won't even
[1:17:30] do the kindergarten things how are they
[1:17:33] going to know algebra if they don't know
[1:17:34] their
[1:17:38] ABCs that's what I teach ABCs at church
[1:17:41] at school at church I kind of try to go
[1:17:43] up to algebra brother said algebra is
[1:17:45] the gifts of the
[1:17:46] Spirit that's what brother says when you
[1:17:48] can start teaching about visions and
[1:17:50] dreams and how to know things like what
[1:17:52] is algebra it's like 2X = six well what
[1:17:55] is x equal 3 you got to find out the
[1:17:58] unknown what's the unknown well there's
[1:18:00] a dream I I don't know what it means now
[1:18:03] you're going to into algebra you might
[1:18:05] have to pray and fast until God gives
[1:18:06] you the meaning everybody understand
[1:18:09] that is this prophecy of God someone had
[1:18:12] a dream there a prophecy about me is
[1:18:13] this from God or not you don't know you
[1:18:15] better find out you better start some
[1:18:17] algebra
[1:18:20] class that's right right Hallelujah I
[1:18:24] just did algebra this week do you know
[1:18:26] um the people that left the message they
[1:18:27] did a video called Kenneth Hagen
[1:18:30] supposedly prophesied of brother Ram's
[1:18:31] death it was a
[1:18:34] prophecy I listen to you yeah okay you
[1:18:36] did all right good hey you got a you got
[1:18:38] a good foundation thank you Brothers it
[1:18:42] was amaz it was amazing I I I didn't
[1:18:44] really plan to study the Holy Ghost
[1:18:45] brought to me so it's a prophecy it's an
[1:18:48] unknown and the first thing the Lord
[1:18:49] showed me is that the prophecy wasn't
[1:18:52] written until after the fact
[1:18:55] no one shared this Prophecy Before
[1:18:56] brother R died that's why I believe it
[1:18:59] was a false
[1:19:00] prophecy and then the other thing in the
[1:19:03] prophecy it said brother Rand made a
[1:19:05] misstep so God gave him over to Satan to
[1:19:08] kill him I said there's not one example
[1:19:10] in the Bible of
[1:19:12] that a genuine Prophet making one
[1:19:15] mistake and then God gives him over to
[1:19:17] Satan there's only one example of
[1:19:19] someone being given over to Satan what
[1:19:20] was that that was that man who was
[1:19:22] sleeping with his stepmother in 1
[1:19:23] Corinthians chapter 5 right Paul said
[1:19:26] I'm going to let give him over to Satan
[1:19:28] for the destruction of the flesh that
[1:19:29] his soul might be saved brother random
[1:19:31] lived true to his wife brother lived a
[1:19:34] real Christian Life Hallelujah he's the
[1:19:36] most humble preacher I've ever heard in
[1:19:38] my
[1:19:42] life right and so what is it was unknown
[1:19:44] so what the Holy Spirit gave me the
[1:19:45] wisdom and people say people made
[1:19:47] comments on there this helped me this
[1:19:48] Set Me Free I don't now now I see the
[1:19:51] wisdom of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah
[1:19:54] there other reasons
[1:19:56] too but just the Simplicity of this was
[1:19:59] after the fact this wasn't told
[1:20:01] beforehand and even the wordss don't
[1:20:03] make sense it's off the word of God
[1:20:06] that's what the Holy Ghost does H when
[1:20:08] you start getting a spiritual algebra
[1:20:10] you brother man said you give it the
[1:20:11] word test you take everything back to
[1:20:13] the Bible does that line up with the
[1:20:14] Bible is that what the Bible said and
[1:20:16] then we find out what the Bible said is
[1:20:18] always going to be right Hallelujah get
[1:20:20] that for our guy there
[1:20:26] so see that the Holy Ghost will make you
[1:20:30] know the unknowns that's
[1:20:32] algebra
[1:20:34] Hallelujah all right now I'm trying to
[1:20:36] close
[1:20:37] here I think I'll stop right there I'm
[1:20:39] already at uh let's see hour 21 that's
[1:20:42] plenty of time there so how many enjoyed
[1:20:44] it tonight any questions on the three
[1:20:47] works of Grace I and I'm going to try to
[1:20:49] find the scripture for you anybody have
[1:20:51] any questions on the three works of
[1:20:53] Grace you got to be saved you got to be
[1:20:56] Sanctified and you got to be filled with
[1:20:58] the Holy Ghost and after that you just
[1:21:00] got to keep your mind Sanctified because
[1:21:02] remember the seat of God inside of you
[1:21:04] the Holy Ghost the seat of God cannot
[1:21:07] sin that's why brother said part of you
[1:21:09] never sin in the first
[1:21:11] place the spirit of God in you never
[1:21:14] sinned it's a part of God 1 John
[1:21:18] 3:9 the seed of God cannot
[1:21:21] sin Hallelujah and then Paul said in
[1:21:24] Romans 7 it's not me that sin it's sin
[1:21:26] that dwell Within
[1:21:28] Me glory amen thank God for Amazing
[1:21:32] Grace let's stand RP any questions let's
[1:21:35] stand like I said I got numerous videos
[1:21:37] on this I got a video about the five
[1:21:39] people that were say but not born again
[1:21:41] but then they got born again proving
[1:21:43] three works of Grace oh yeah my last
[1:21:45] point was the churches hate this
[1:21:47] teaching I'm talk about the false
[1:21:48] churches the false churches hate this
[1:21:50] teaching because then we're telling them
[1:21:52] they don't have the Holy Ghost but they
[1:21:54] don't have the Holy Ghost if you can
[1:21:56] live like a devil you don't have the
[1:21:58] Holy
[1:22:01] Ghost that's why they hate brother R's
[1:22:05] message because they hate the truth but
[1:22:07] we don't hate the truth we love the
[1:22:09] truth that's all we want is the truth
[1:22:13] hallelujah amen
[1:22:15] brother that's why these people that
[1:22:17] left the message they don't like the
[1:22:18] three works of Grace they just say oh no
[1:22:20] there's one work can you imagine a holy
[1:22:22] ghost filled person uh cussing divorcing
[1:22:25] remarrying three or four times going to
[1:22:27] see prostitutes all these things oh yeah
[1:22:29] you're filled with the Holy Ghost you
[1:22:30] you're filled with the Devil is what
[1:22:31] you're filled
[1:22:33] with the Holy Ghost teaches you to deny
[1:22:36] ungodliness we I read it we read it
[1:22:40] tonight the Holy Ghost will purify A
[1:22:43] peculiar people unto himself that are
[1:22:45] zealous of good works not zealous of
[1:22:46] lustful Works let's bow our hearts
