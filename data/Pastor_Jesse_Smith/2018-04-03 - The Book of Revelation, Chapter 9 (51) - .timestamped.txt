[0:03] Revelation chapter 9
[0:07] the themes of this chapter are the
[0:09] sounding of the fifth and sixth trumpets
[0:12] and the passing of the first woe
[0:16] the fifth trumpet brings torment only
[0:18] not death on the earth for five months
[0:22] upon any person who does not have the
[0:24] seal of God or the baptism of the Holy
[0:26] Ghost in their foreheads which means
[0:29] everyone that is not one of the 144,000
[0:32] Israelite believers will be tormented
[0:35] the torment comes from locusts that are
[0:38] like horses prepared for battle having
[0:41] faces of men hair like women and Tails
[0:44] like scorpions these locusts had a king
[0:47] over them which we believe will be Satan
[0:50] according to Revelation chapter 20
[0:52] verses 1 to 3 revelation 9 verse 12
[0:57] states that this fifth trumpet is also
[1:00] the first woe the sixth trumpet brings
[1:04] plagues and death as an army of 200
[1:06] million horsemen with heads of lions
[1:08] kill one-third of the men on the earth
[1:10] who failed to repent of their wickedness
[1:13] based upon the descriptions of these
[1:15] horsemen no doubt they are not literal
[1:18] men but demons the timing of events is
[1:22] as follows although we could be wrong
[1:24] it seems the fifth trumpet follows the
[1:27] first four trumpets notice also that
[1:30] this fifth trumpet sounds after the
[1:33] 144,000 Jews are sealed with the baptism
[1:36] of the Holy Ghost according to
[1:38] Revelation chapter 9 verse 4 and then
[1:43] the sixth trumpet follows the fifth all
[1:46] of this takes place either during or
[1:49] after the three-and-a-half year
[1:51] Tribulation Period as we are not
[1:53] completely sure
[1:56] recall that each trumpet is initiated or
[2:00] pronounced by the two witnesses of
[2:02] Revelation chapter 11 the symbols and
[2:07] key revelations include God's protection
[2:10] of the 144,000 under the fifth trumpet
[2:13] and the hair of the horse shaped locusts
[2:17] that torment everyone for five months
[2:21] concerning God's protection of the
[2:23] 144,000 verse four states that the
[2:27] locusts will not torment those who are
[2:29] sealed with a seal of God in their
[2:30] foreheads which means the 144,000 Jews
[2:33] who were seal with the Holy Ghost in
[2:35] Revelation 7 verses 1 through 8 we again
[2:39] see the truth that the merciful God
[2:42] oftentimes protects true believers from
[2:44] torment as we know God spared Noah and
[2:47] his family from the flood and he spared
[2:50] Daniel from the Lions and the three
[2:52] Hebrew children from the fiery furnace
[2:54] he also spared the faithful Jews who
[2:57] sighed and cried for the Bauman's done
[2:59] in Jerusalem in Ezekiel chapter 9
[3:02] concerning the hair of the horse shaped
[3:04] locusts in verse 8 we see the truth that
[3:07] God designed women to have long uncut
[3:10] hair as these tormenting locusts had
[3:13] hair as women st. Paul taught that all
[3:16] Christian women should have uncut hair
[3:18] which is their glory and also their
[3:21] covering according to 1st Corinthians 11
[3:23] verses 1 to 16 it seems that during the
[3:26] 5th trumpet God is going to allow the
[3:28] tormenting locusts to have long uncut
[3:31] hair as a rebuke upon the unbelieving
[3:35] men and women who did not honor God's
[3:37] biblical requirements for hair length if
[3:41] you'd like more bible scriptures
[3:43] quotations or if you have any questions

[3:51] Christ be the desire of your heart
