TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matches name of the lord jesus christ recently i was asked the following question by a viewer who has left the message god gave to brother william branham he's in the group i call accusers of brother branham he asked a question about a brother branham quote i used in a recent video saying thus saith the lord a woman who cuts her hair is dead where is the scripture in the bible as i replied and showed him the scriptures that prove this statement from brother branham is true i realize this might be a helpful video to make for all of our viewers the thus saith the lord quote from brother branham let's begin by listening to the quote in question from brother must branham it to an age into a purpose therefore he had long hair the woman that's a child of god lets her hair grow to show us she's consecrated to every word of god if she cuts it off i don't care how much she dances sings sit in the choir speaks in tongues runs up and down who has all kind of aids society she's dead that's thus saith the lord the word of god first corinthians 14 let's look at the context of brother branham's quote i'll begin by saying this was a great question before reading my answer to the man i want to first preface my answer to explain the context of brother branham's thus saith the lord statement from god of this evil age 1965. in the five preceding paragraphs before this thus saith the lord's statement brother branham was preaching in context about the false vine the reprobate church or the serpent seed group of people who claim to be believers but are deceivers and are ultimately lost he's preaching against the reprobates the tares who look like wheat believers but are liars and deceivers beginning in paragraph number 142 about five paragraphs before the thus say the lord quote you find brother branham's exact words mentioning this terror group for example he calls them children of disobedience then he says they're the balaam group he says they're the modern religious ecumenical group and then he mentions denominations like church of christ baptist presbyterian pentecostals who are in the ecumenical group that say we are all one brother branham continues and says this is the group who takes the mark of the beast and calls it the reprobate church then brother branham mentions women cutting their hair he said if a woman cuts her hair she loses her consecration to god even though she gets the anointing for some religious acts in the holy spirit like dancing and speaking in tongues she's spiritually dead as i'll mention at the end of this video jesus described this group in matthew chapter 7 verses 21 through 23 and he calls them workers of iniquity and this is the same false anointed ones jesus spoke of in matthew 24 verse 24. brother branham is speaking about women who sell out god's truth about hair length to the god of this evil modern age these women love hollywood fashion they're daughters of the modern jezebel and they worship hollywood and love her connection to the ecumenical movement of churches finally after rebuking the reprobates brother branham mentions a woman that's a child of god who cuts her hair is dead with thus saith the lord so there are two types of child of god believers who brother branham could be talking about here the first kind would be a woman that was at one time a child of god who was once saved by grace but forfeits her salvation losing her salvation failing the grace of god as hebrews 12 verse 15 teaches selling out the truth of god's word for the false church system and accepting the mark of the beast this type of woman is like judas iscariot who did the same judas fell by transgression according to acts 1 verse 25 and jesus christ himself said he would blot out the names of those who did not overcome the world by rejecting the white raiment of eternal life in revelation 3 verse 5 so jesus christ also says people can lose their salvation revelation 3 verse 5 says he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i'll confess his name before my father and before his angels hebrews 10 29 is another scripture that proves people can lose their salvation if they're not born again or baptized with the holy ghost of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trod and underfoot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite under the spirit of grace so in context this scripture says a person can be justified and sanctified but still reject the effects of the holy spirit or reject the spirit of grace the bible says this is just like judas is scared he was saved and even baptized other believers according to the book of saint john and no doubt he was sanctified because he was clean enough to do miracles like all the other eleven apostles but at the passover judas left jesus and satan entered into him and that was the moment he transgressed the lord satan filled his heart and he became a reprobate that's where he made his final choice to become the son of perdition the son of destruction and that was the moment he forfeited his salvation if you'd like to learn more about this subject you can see my 2021 book the 12 new testament mysteries revealed and this topic is addressed on pages 384 through 388. you can also find more about it on pages 252 to page 261 there's so much bible evidence for people who can lose their salvation because they fail to move on with the holy spirit and the type is many of the israelites who left egypt in the exodus were destroyed in the wilderness because their hearts turned away from god and turned back to egypt if you can't afford a copy of my 2021 book i'll be happy to email you a free ebook or pdf copy the second type of child of god believer brother branham could be talking about is a foolish virgin meaning a christian woman who was saved but not baptized with the holy ghost jesus teaches there are two kinds of christians in matthew 25 verses 1-13 he calls them wise and foolish the wise have extra oil symbolizing they have the baptism of the holy ghost in their souls the foolish virgin did not prepare enough oil meaning they foolishly wasted their time and did not pray enough and did not obey god enough in order to receive the oil or baptism of the holy ghost in their souls since humans have three parts to their beings body human spirit or mind and soul according to first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 23 a foolish virgin woman could have the anointing upon her body to dance in the spirit and also upon her human spirit or mind to be saved experiencing the anointing of the holy ghost to speak in tongues prophesy or manifest any of the nine gifts of the holy spirit yet her soul would not be quickened or made alive by the holy ghost so as the man asked where is the scripture in the bible for a woman that cuts her hair being dead here's my answer to the man's question on youtube i'll read it verbatim and then offer more bible proof afterwards quote yes sir that is exactly scriptural three scriptures help us see the truth that if a woman cuts her hair she is spiritually dead the first is first timothy 5 6 in context it's about widow women who choose to live in pleasure rather than holiness but this scripture proves a woman without the baptism of the holy ghost is spiritually dead in her soul meaning her soul is not quickened we can clearly see how first timothy 5 verse 6 says a woman who lives in worldly pleasure is spiritually dead while she's alive that's what i believe brother branham was teaching in this quote he was preaching about women that live according to the pleasures of hollywood rather than living consecrated to christ and if hollywood was the god of the woman then she would be spiritually dead while she's naturally alive second to prove the soul needs quickened we use ephesians 2 verses 1-5 these scriptures show a born-again saint has a quickened or made alive soul the opposite must be true that a person without the quickening power of the holy ghost has a dead or dormant soul third in first corinthians 11 verses 1 through 16 the scriptures prove a woman who cuts her hair shames her head or husband which means she also shames christ and god for that is the order of headship a shameful woman who cuts her hair could not be born again as there is no scripture in the bible wherein god asks a godly woman to cut her hair i have two videos about hair length plus i wrote a book about modesty in 2019 if you want a free copy you can also listen to the book for free on my youtube channel with all due respect no one who has left the message has given an effort to read my two books that prove the message is the revelation of the bible so i doubt you will read it i write this in sincerity and not in malice i write with brotherly kindness and not in anger and i have heard your testimonies on the believe the sign podcast i respect you and love you with christian love but i greatly disagree with you lastly your statement that brother bill's video about the 1963 cloud was a lot of nonsense sadden me you gave no new proof for your claim despite brother bill clearly proving the cloud could not have been formed by man this cloud was formed by god as a sign to this generation i hope you will humbly and sincerely reconsider your positions god bless you and i hope this helps you love in christ brother jesse more bible proofs here are five more scriptures that help prove a woman who cuts her hair is not born again in her soul by the baptism of the holy ghost first two greek words in first corinthians 11 verses 1 through 16 show the dishonor a woman shows toward her husband and christ and ultimately god the father the word dishonor in first corinthians 11 verse 5 means to shame down disgrace put to the blush confound dishonor shame so a woman who dishonors her husband christ and the invisible god is likely not born again the second greek word for shame from first corinthians 11 verse 14 means infamy indignity disgrace dishonor reproach shame or vile so in context it's referring to a man that does not cut his hair so the opposite must be true as well a woman who cuts her hair would also be reproachful and vile a vile man or woman would likely not be born again by the holy ghost baptism that's because acts 5 32 says god gives the holy ghost to them that obey him and a man who never cuts his hair is disobedient to the word and a woman who cuts her hair is disobedient to the word of god second first john 2 verses 15 15-17 proves a woman who loves the fashions of the world like cutting hair does not have the love of god in her soul the love of god is also called god's spirit for god is love a woman without god's spirit is not born again in her soul this proves her soul is dead or not quickened by the spirit of god love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him a third scripture is first peter 1 verse 23 which proves a person is born again by the seed of god the word of god a woman who denies the word of god that commands her to let her hair grow cannot be born again and so she does not have the seed or life of god in her soul her soul is lacking the seed or life of god's holy spirit being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever a woman's soul without the seed of god does not live as the scripture says therefore it is dead or dormant fourth revelation 9 verse 8 proves women who are lost and cut their hair have dead souls that are not born again for the fifth trumpet has a punishment upon those who take the mark of the beast they are tormented by devils with hair like women's hair which would be long and uncut according to first corinthians 11 verses 1-16 it seems part of their torment will be for dishonoring god and his word and christ and their husbands for cutting their hair fifth there's a set of three more scriptures that teach the revelation brother branham called the anointed ones at the end times brother branham used jesus's words from matthew 5 verse 45 matthew 7 verses 21 through 23 and matthew 24 verse 24 to show how many will be lost who did miracles and signs in jesus name yet later lived lies of iniquity and thereby were lost for hell this fits with brother branham's thus saith the lord quote about a woman cutting her hair being spiritually dead because brother branham said the woman could have the anointing of the spirit to do the works of god but later deny god in his truth selling her soul to the devil and being lost matthew 5 verse 45 says for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust this shows god sends the holy spirit on the just and the unjust so a person who is lost can obey parts of god's instruction and receive the anointing for a temporary purpose but then later they can reject that anointing and continue to live a life of iniquity matthew 7 verse 22 says many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name have done many wonderful works and then i will profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity notice jesus never denied that they did supernatural works by the power of the holy ghost but he pointed out that after those supernatural works they turned down jesus's anointing for a holy life and lived a life of iniquity or lawlessness matthew 24 verse 24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect for a life-changing teaching on this subject please read or listen to brother branham's sermon from july 25 1965 titled the anointed ones at the end time in closing i hope this video has been a blessing to you again this was a great question and i was grateful for the question and hope this answer is now fully backed up by scripture this question required a lot of understanding into one of the mysteries of god called christ in you the hope of glory or in other words the mystery of the baptism of the holy ghost this mystery could only be finished at the end time according to revelation 10 verse 7 and was finished through the holy ghost teaching it to our prophet brother william branham we rejoice that the holy ghost can give us more scriptures to answer these more challenging questions but that's what the bible says the holy spirit searches the deep things yea the deep things of god that's according to first corinthians 2 verse 10 but god hath revealed them unto us by spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god as you probably know the bible also says if there's a deep call there has to be a deep to respond so friends with all these questions there's deep calls in people's hearts and souls to understand these things so there has to be a deep to respond and that's the holy spirit that will take us deeper in the word of god if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me [Music] god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
