[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:10] of the lord jesus christ
[0:12] can a person be saved but not yet born
[0:14] again the answer is yes which means in
[0:18] other words not all saved christians are
[0:21] born again
[0:22] here's the outline for this video
[0:24] first we'll look at visuals that will
[0:26] help us understand this bible truth
[0:29] second we'll look at bible proof
[0:31] believers can be saved but not yet born
[0:33] again
[0:35] third we'll listen to a quote from god's
[0:37] prophet william branham explaining this
[0:39] revelation
[0:40] and lastly we'll look at the
[0:41] misunderstanding some people have of
[0:44] john chapter 3 verse 3.
[0:47] this is a wonderful deep bible subject
[0:50] that the holy ghost leads believers into
[0:53] understanding as jesus and paul told us
[0:56] christ of the holy ghost will lead us
[0:57] into all truth in john 16 13 how be it
[1:01] when he the spirit of truth is come he
[1:04] will guide you into all truth
[1:06] paul said the holy ghost searches the
[1:08] deep things in first corinthians 2 verse
[1:10] 10 but god hath revealed them unto us by
[1:13] his spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[1:16] things yea the deep things of god
[1:19] this subject is also closely related to
[1:21] the bible mystery called by numerous
[1:24] different names such as christ in you
[1:26] and the filling of the holy ghost and
[1:28] the new birth but i'll call the baptism
[1:30] of the holy ghost because jesus called
[1:33] it this in numerous places but most
[1:35] notably in acts chapter 1 verse 5 when
[1:38] he said for john truly baptized with
[1:40] water but ye shall be baptized with the
[1:42] holy ghost not many days hence
[1:46] visuals to help understanding
[1:49] before showing the five bible proofs
[1:51] people can be saved and not born again i
[1:54] want to show visuals that will help
[1:56] viewers understand this clear bible
[1:58] truth that the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:01] or new birth takes place sometime after
[2:04] a person is saved
[2:06] and by saved i mean when he first
[2:08] believes in jesus christ and repents of
[2:10] his sins and is baptized
[2:13] paul explicitly stated this
[2:15] in two places
[2:17] acts 19 verse 2 said he said unto them
[2:19] have ye received the holy ghost since ye
[2:22] believed
[2:23] and they said unto him we have not so
[2:24] much as heard whether there be any holy
[2:27] ghost
[2:28] of course paul was talking to the
[2:30] ephesians which believed in jesus christ
[2:32] but yet we're not born again as we'll
[2:33] show later
[2:35] and the second verse is ephesians 1
[2:37] verse 13
[2:38] in whom he also trusted after that ye
[2:41] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[2:43] your salvation in whom also
[2:45] after that ye believed you were sealed
[2:48] with that holy spirit of promise
[2:51] on page 301 of my 2021 book i listed
[2:55] eight representations of god's plan to
[2:58] use three steps three stages or three
[3:01] works of grace in order to bring a
[3:03] person to complete spiritual maturity
[3:07] the bible calls these three works
[3:09] justification sanctification and the
[3:12] baptism of the holy ghost
[3:14] believers are saved at justification
[3:17] but must continue believing and thereby
[3:19] be sanctified in the second stage or
[3:21] work of grace
[3:22] meaning sanctified from sinful habits
[3:25] and then they're eternally sealed into
[3:27] the kingdom of god in the third stage
[3:30] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:33] so here's the chart from my book
[3:35] you'll see how god always has three
[3:37] works of grace for man's natural birth
[3:40] you have the water breaking the blood
[3:42] and then the breath of life
[3:44] for man's spiritual birth which is what
[3:46] we're talking about now
[3:48] the believer is justified or goes
[3:50] through justification when they believe
[3:52] in the first step
[3:54] that's when they're saved
[3:55] then they're sanctified in the second
[3:57] step and then thirdly they are baptized
[3:59] with the holy ghost
[4:01] this was foreshadowed by israel's exodus
[4:03] in the old testament
[4:05] the first step was leaving egypt which
[4:07] represents being saved out of a life of
[4:09] sin or being saved out of worldliness
[4:12] the second stage was going through the
[4:14] wilderness which represents
[4:15] sanctification
[4:17] and the third step was crossing over
[4:19] into canaan or possessing the promised
[4:21] land that joshua led israel to fulfill
[4:26] you also see these three steps in the
[4:28] tabernacles cleansing
[4:30] which is moses tabernacle because you
[4:32] have the outer court holy place holy of
[4:35] holies
[4:36] the earth's cleansing
[4:38] which is past and future has three steps
[4:40] as well noah's flood of water represents
[4:43] the baptism or a person being saved as
[4:46] first peter 3 teaches as well
[4:48] sanctification is represented when jesus
[4:50] blood was spilled upon the earth
[4:52] and earth's cleansing is completed in
[4:55] the third step of the fervent heat peter
[4:57] wrote about in second peter chapter
[4:59] three this fervent heat represents the
[5:01] baptism of the holy ghost or the third
[5:03] work of grace
[5:04] a believer experiences when he's born
[5:06] again
[5:08] ezekiel prophesied of these three steps
[5:10] in ezekiel 36 verses 26 and 27
[5:14] being saved is having a new heart the
[5:17] second stage is being sanctified called
[5:19] the new spirit or new mind
[5:21] or renewed human spirit
[5:23] the third step is the baptism of the
[5:25] holy ghost which is my spirit god says
[5:27] or god's spirit dwelling in the
[5:29] believer's soul
[5:32] jesus also likened these three stages to
[5:34] the three stages in a wheat plant's
[5:36] growth
[5:37] in mark 4 verse 28 jesus said the wheat
[5:40] starts as a blade that's being saved
[5:43] the next stage is the ear that's being
[5:45] sanctified
[5:46] and the full corn stage is the third
[5:48] stage the baptism of the holy ghost
[5:51] and jesus also called these three stages
[5:53] the way the truth and the life in john
[5:56] 14 verses 3 through 6
[5:58] and also john 17 verse 17
[6:01] the way was justification or being saved
[6:05] sanctification comes by the word or the
[6:07] truth because jesus said thy word is
[6:09] truth sanctify them through thy word thy
[6:12] word is truth in john 17 verse 17
[6:15] and then the life was the third step
[6:18] the life is the holy ghost living in the
[6:20] believer's soul
[6:23] here's a second visual showing the three
[6:25] parts to man's being
[6:27] body human spirit or mind and soul
[6:30] according to first thessalonians 5 verse
[6:32] 23.
[6:35] in the old testament the saints were
[6:36] saved as the holy ghost could come upon
[6:38] their bodies
[6:39] like samson and david's flesh was
[6:42] mightily anointed to do great works for
[6:43] god
[6:45] and the holy ghost would come upon their
[6:46] human spirits where holy men of old were
[6:49] moved by the holy ghost to write
[6:51] infallible scripture and they would
[6:53] prophesy and write the scripture
[6:55] but the holy ghost could never baptize
[6:57] their souls in the old testament because
[6:59] the blood of animals could never abolish
[7:01] sin as hebrews chapters 9 and 10 labor
[7:04] upon
[7:05] so please read those chapters
[7:08] but now in the new testament thanks to
[7:09] the blood of jesus christ the holy ghost
[7:11] can now fill baptize and seal the soul
[7:14] of the believer unto the day of his
[7:16] redemption according to ephesians 4 30
[7:19] matthew 11 29 and hebrews 4 verses 9
[7:22] through 12.
[7:25] bible proof believers can be saved but
[7:27] not yet born again
[7:30] in the new testament you find at least
[7:32] five examples of persons being saved
[7:35] without being born again
[7:37] it's absolutely necessary to understand
[7:39] jesus christ said no one could be born
[7:41] again until after he was resurrected in
[7:44] his glorified body in john 7 verses 37
[7:47] through 39
[7:49] this means all old testament saints were
[7:51] saved but not born again due to the
[7:53] weakness of the blood of bulls and goats
[7:55] as hebrews 9 verses 13 and 14 and
[7:58] hebrews 10 verse 4 tell us
[8:01] jesus's blood took away sins and now the
[8:04] souls of men could be born again by the
[8:06] baptism of the holy ghost
[8:08] both john the baptist and jesus christ
[8:10] use the terminology of the baptism of
[8:12] the holy ghost or the born-again
[8:14] experience in matthew 3 verse 11 and
[8:17] acts 1 verse 5.
[8:19] note also the five examples of persons
[8:22] being saved without having the holy
[8:24] ghost baptism are peter
[8:26] mary
[8:28] the samaritans in acts 8 including simon
[8:31] the sorcerer cornelius in acts chapter
[8:34] 10 and the 12 ephesian saints in acts
[8:36] chapter 19.
[8:39] beginning with peter he had the
[8:41] revelation that jesus was the christ in
[8:43] matthew 16 verse 16.
[8:46] before this peter was already baptizing
[8:49] souls according to john chapter 4 verses
[8:51] 1 and 2.
[8:52] so peter himself would have already
[8:54] repented and been baptized unto john's
[8:56] baptism
[8:58] baptism signifies a soul is saved
[9:00] because it has confessed and repented
[9:02] from sins according to first peter 3
[9:04] verse 21
[9:06] and mark 16 16 and matthew 3 verses 1
[9:09] through 6.
[9:10] peter didn't receive the holy ghost
[9:12] baptism until acts chapter 2 verse 4 and
[9:16] testified it about being the holy ghost
[9:18] baptism in acts 11 verses 15 and 16.
[9:22] also note jesus prayed for peter's faith
[9:24] not to fail in luke 22 32 meaning peter
[9:29] would not lose his faith or salvation
[9:32] faith is the first step in salvation
[9:35] when a person receives the gift of faith
[9:37] or the anointing of faith it is the
[9:39] moment the person is saved and perhaps
[9:41] we'll make a video in the future about
[9:43] the stature of a perfect man that
[9:45] details this in second peter chapter 1
[9:47] verse 5.
[9:50] the second example is mary the mother of
[9:52] jesus
[9:53] mary claims she was already saved in
[9:55] luke 1 verse 47
[9:58] before jesus was even born
[10:00] luke 1 47 says and my spirit hath
[10:03] rejoiced in god my savior
[10:06] so mary was clearly saved but she was
[10:08] not born again
[10:11] we know this because acts 1 verse 14
[10:14] says that mary the mother of jesus
[10:16] his brethren and the women all continued
[10:18] with one accord in prayer and
[10:20] supplication in the upper room until
[10:22] acts 2 verse 4 when the holy ghost fell
[10:25] and they were all filled with the holy
[10:26] ghost and began to speak with other
[10:28] tongues as the spirit gave them
[10:30] utterance
[10:32] the third proof is the samaritans and
[10:35] simon the sorcerer in acts chapter 8.
[10:39] in verses 12 and 13 many samaritans
[10:41] heard philip preaching and they were
[10:43] baptized both men and women but in
[10:46] verses 14 through 16 peter and john came
[10:49] down to pray for the samaritans that
[10:51] they'd be filled with the holy ghost or
[10:53] baptized with the holy ghost
[10:55] verse 16 plainly states it for as yet he
[10:58] was fallen upon none of them only they
[11:00] were baptized in the name of the lord
[11:02] jesus it is undeniable that they were
[11:04] believers
[11:05] because verse 12 says they believe
[11:08] philip preaching the things concerning
[11:10] the kingdom of god
[11:11] verse 13 says simon the sorcerer
[11:13] believed himself also
[11:15] then in verse 17 they laid their hands
[11:17] on them and they received the holy ghost
[11:20] so it's undeniable the samaritans were
[11:23] saved but not yet filled with the holy
[11:24] ghost
[11:26] and this story matches all the other
[11:27] previous bible teachings that a person
[11:30] gets saved first and then sometime after
[11:32] that in the third work of grace they get
[11:34] the baptism of the holy ghost
[11:37] now verses 18 through 23 simon the
[11:40] sorcerer tries to buy this ability to
[11:42] pray for people and get the holy ghost
[11:44] and notice what peter says to him
[11:46] peter says thy money perish with thee
[11:49] peter said his heart was not right in
[11:51] the sight of god peter said he need to
[11:53] repented of this wickedness peter said
[11:56] he was in the gall of bitterness in the
[11:58] bond of iniquity
[11:59] so this language proves simon the
[12:02] sorcerer was a believer but he was not
[12:03] yet born again the holy ghost had not
[12:06] filled him yet because the holy ghost
[12:08] filled believer would have the love of
[12:09] god in his heart and not think he could
[12:12] buy the gifts of god
[12:15] our fourth example is acts chapter 10
[12:18] cornelius
[12:19] had to have been saved and sanctified
[12:21] before he received the baptism of the
[12:23] holy ghost through peter's preaching in
[12:25] acts chapter 10 verse 44.
[12:27] proof of this is in peter's own words
[12:30] for he said cornelius knew the preaching
[12:32] of peace by jesus christ according to
[12:34] acts 10 verse 36 and 37. peter said that
[12:38] word i say ye no
[12:41] corneas knew about jesus christ and
[12:43] thereby was serving christ through
[12:45] prayer fasting and almsgiving as you
[12:48] read in acts chapter 10.
[12:50] heaven had even recorded his memorials
[12:53] the prayers fasting in alms etc so no
[12:56] doubt he was already saved and had the
[12:57] fear of the lord but he wasn't born
[12:59] again
[13:00] for some reason cornelius had not been
[13:02] baptized in water we don't know why he
[13:04] hadn't been baptized but after his soul
[13:06] was baptized with the holy ghost peter
[13:08] commanded him to be baptized in water
[13:11] and he happily agreed this proves water
[13:13] baptism is just an outward symbol of the
[13:15] inward work of salvation that is already
[13:18] done in the hearts of believers
[13:21] the fifth and final example is the
[13:23] twelve ephesian saints who received the
[13:25] baptism of the holy ghost in acts 19
[13:28] verses six and seven
[13:30] notice they were already saved because
[13:32] they had been baptized unto john's
[13:34] baptism which was a baptism unto
[13:36] repentance and remission of sins
[13:39] they had been sitting under the mighty
[13:40] ministry of apollos who only knew john's
[13:42] baptism according to acts 18 verses
[13:45] 24-28
[13:47] these saints had to have been justified
[13:49] and sanctified
[13:50] justification and sanctification are
[13:52] mighty works of god no doubt for there
[13:54] is rejoicing in the presence of the
[13:56] angels over one sinner who repents
[13:59] paul asked this group if they had
[14:00] received the holy ghost since they
[14:02] believed which no doubt he meant the
[14:04] holy ghost baptism that jesus urged his
[14:07] own disciples to receive after he
[14:09] resurrected in john 20 verse 22 and acts
[14:13] 1 verses 4 and 5.
[14:15] the ephesians told paul they had not
[14:16] heard of this holy ghost baptism paul
[14:19] then baptized them in the name of the
[14:21] lord jesus laid his hands on them and
[14:23] they received the holy ghost baptism
[14:27] it's important to recognize people can
[14:28] lose their salvation
[14:30] if they're in the first or second stages
[14:32] of god's grace
[14:34] lord willing in the future will make a
[14:36] video about how people can lose their
[14:38] salvation
[14:40] but born again people those whose souls
[14:42] have been baptized with the holy ghost
[14:44] can never lose their salvation because
[14:46] they have the permanent seal of the holy
[14:48] ghost baptism
[14:50] as the bible says they are sealed unto
[14:52] the day of redemption according to
[14:53] ephesians 4 verse 30.
[14:56] jesus christ himself said overcomers
[14:59] names will not be blotted out of the
[15:00] book of life in revelation 3 verse 5 so
[15:04] this means names of the disobedient can
[15:06] be blotted out out of the book of life
[15:08] mentioned in revelation 22 19 just as
[15:12] names were blotted out in the old
[15:13] testament according to exodus 32 33
[15:18] friends salvation by grace is a gift but
[15:21] the gift can be forfeited by
[15:22] transgression
[15:24] judas is scary believed in jesus for a
[15:26] while as he and the other 11 apostles
[15:28] baptized new believers but judas fell by
[15:31] transgression and went to hell according
[15:33] to acts 1 verse 25
[15:36] judas iscariot then is an example of
[15:38] someone who believed in jesus for a
[15:40] while but then forfeited his salvation
[15:44] jesus said this was possible in luke
[15:46] chapter 8 verse 13 when he preached on
[15:49] the four kinds of grounds or hearts and
[15:52] said the stony ground heart
[15:54] believed on him for a while but then
[15:57] fell away or lost its salvation
[16:00] luke 8 13 says they on the rock are they
[16:03] which when they hear receive the word
[16:06] with joy and these have no root which
[16:08] for a while believe
[16:10] and in time of temptation fall away
[16:14] so people like judas iscariot can
[16:16] believe for a while their names can be
[16:18] on the book of life in heaven for a
[16:20] while but then they can fall away and
[16:22] jesus will blot their names out of the
[16:24] book of life
[16:27] in the presence of the 12 and 70
[16:29] preachers jesus told them not to rejoice
[16:31] in their power to do miracles but in the
[16:34] fact that their names were written in
[16:35] heaven in luke 10 verses 17-24
[16:39] a deep understanding of grace shows
[16:41] people can receive grace but they can
[16:44] also fail the grace of god meaning the
[16:46] grace that once saved and sanctified a
[16:48] person can be trodden underfoot leading
[16:51] to sore punishment according to hebrews
[16:53] 10 verses 25 through 39 and hebrews 12
[16:56] verses 15 through 17.
[17:00] others can receive the grace of god in
[17:02] vain according to second corinthians 6
[17:04] verse 1 and grace can be turned into
[17:06] lawlessness or laschiviousness according
[17:09] to jude 1 verse 4.
[17:12] paul also said grace can be frustrated
[17:13] through legalism in galatians 2 verse
[17:16] 20.
[17:18] to say every christian or believer is
[17:21] already born again is to take away these
[17:23] five bible examples out from the pulpit
[17:26] which carries grave consequences
[17:28] according to proverbs 30 verse 5 and 6
[17:30] and revelation 22 verses 18-19
[17:34] proverbs 30 5-6 says every word of god
[17:36] is pure
[17:37] he's a shield unto them that put their
[17:39] trust in him add thou not unto his words
[17:42] lest he reprove thee and thou be found a
[17:44] liar
[17:46] revelation 22 18-19 says for i testify
[17:49] on every man that heareth the words of
[17:52] the prophecy of this book if any man
[17:54] shall add unto these things god shall
[17:56] add unto him the plagues that are
[17:57] written in this book
[17:59] and if any man shall take away from the
[18:00] words of the book of this prophecy god
[18:03] shall take away his part out of the book
[18:04] of life and out of the holy city and
[18:07] from the things which are written in
[18:08] this book
[18:10] please friends do not ignore these five
[18:13] plain bible examples
[18:15] bible readers must not write off ignore
[18:18] or explain away or discredit these five
[18:21] bible proofs
[18:22] these are explicit teachings that
[18:25] believers can be saved but not yet
[18:27] filled or born again by the holy ghost
[18:30] these five biblical texts are not
[18:32] implications
[18:33] i am not implying anything into these
[18:35] five biblical texts
[18:37] these are explicit teachings that not
[18:40] every believer is born again
[18:42] by god's grace i receive the bible
[18:44] knowledge of this subject through god's
[18:46] prophet brother william branham
[18:49] there are many quotes detailing this
[18:50] revelation but here is one that is very
[18:53] clear and contains bible examples let's
[18:55] listen to the quote
[18:58] now i believe that you are are are saved
[19:02] by accepting jesus christ
[19:06] and water baptism is an outward
[19:08] expression to show that something
[19:10] inwardly has happened because water has
[19:13] no virtue
[19:14] it's just a symbol
[19:17] and i believe that you're saved when you
[19:20] now there's many people let me straight
[19:22] this for brother there's many people
[19:24] that are say they're saved many are
[19:27] baptized in jesus name many speak in
[19:29] tongues and have all kinds of signs of
[19:31] the holy ghost and still not even saved
[19:36] that's right
[19:37] mandy will come to me in that and said
[19:39] lord have not i prophesied in your name
[19:42] preacher
[19:44] have not i in your name cast out devils
[19:46] have done many mighty works he said
[19:47] depart from me you that work iniquity
[19:50] i never even knew you
[19:52] see so all those things
[19:55] yet it's it's god
[19:58] it's in his hands
[20:00] but when i see that you say well then
[20:02] why do you recall the people to be
[20:05] re-baptized is because i'm following the
[20:09] pattern of the beginning
[20:11] we can't lose that blueprint
[20:15] now we take apostle paul
[20:17] when he found certain disciples that
[20:20] were wonderful people i believe they
[20:22] were saved
[20:23] and yet they had not been baptized in
[20:26] the name of jesus christ though they had
[20:28] been baptized
[20:30] acts 19
[20:32] passed through the upper coast of the
[20:33] emphasis he finds certain disciples and
[20:35] he said unto them have you received the
[20:37] holy ghost since ye believed
[20:40] and they said unto him we don't know
[20:42] about the holy ghost where there be any
[20:43] holy ghost he said then unto what were
[20:46] you
[20:46] baptized they said we've been baptized
[20:49] john baptized is the same man that
[20:51] baptized jesus that's a pretty good
[20:53] baptism
[20:55] what's this stern apostle
[20:58] he said but john only baptized unto
[21:01] repentance
[21:02] not far remission of sins
[21:05] because the sacrifice had not been
[21:07] killed
[21:08] baptized unto and when they heard this
[21:11] they were re-baptized
[21:13] in the name of jesus christ and the holy
[21:16] ghost came upon them
[21:18] now what did this do
[21:20] showed that these people who were
[21:22] protesting
[21:23] onto life as soon as they saw the
[21:26] scriptural truth they walked in the
[21:30] truth and receive the reward of a
[21:32] believer the holy ghost came upon them
[21:36] and they spoke in tongues prophesied
[21:38] magnified god
[21:40] you get it now see
[21:42] they did that after they've already had
[21:44] great joy shouting and praising god in
[21:47] the bible they had a baptist preacher up
[21:49] there he was baptized too
[21:51] but he was and he was proved by the by
[21:53] the bible that jesus was a christ and
[21:56] the people had great joy and they were
[21:58] just so happy over and still they didn't
[22:00] have the holy ghost
[22:04] they had to be re-baptized again and
[22:06] paul said in galatians 1 8 if an angel
[22:09] from heaven comes and preaches any other
[22:11] gospel this i preached unto you let him
[22:13] be accursed
[22:14] don't care what it would be
[22:19] now i realize that it is going to be
[22:21] confusing for a moment here as most
[22:23] people know that i was ordained a
[22:25] baptist preacher and i have steadfastly
[22:27] declared that the baptists have missed
[22:29] it for saying you receive the holy ghost
[22:31] when you believe for that is not so
[22:34] you receive him since you believed acts
[22:37] 19 2-6
[22:39] he said unto them have you received the
[22:41] holy ghost since he believed
[22:44] and they said unto him
[22:46] we have not so much as heard whether
[22:48] there be any holy ghost
[22:50] and he said unto them
[22:51] unto what then were ye baptized and they
[22:54] said unto john's baptism
[22:57] then said paul
[22:58] john verily baptized with the baptism of
[23:00] repentance saying unto the people that
[23:03] they should believe on him which had
[23:04] come after him that is on christ jesus
[23:08] when they heard this they were baptized
[23:10] in the name of the lord jesus
[23:12] and when paul had laid his hands upon
[23:14] them the holy ghost came upon them
[23:17] and they spake with tongues and
[23:18] prophesied
[23:20] there it is
[23:21] paul asked
[23:23] have you received since not when you
[23:25] believed
[23:26] and there is a great difference there
[23:28] for it is after we believe that we
[23:30] receive
[23:31] ephesians 1 13 is an exact word repeat
[23:34] of what happened in ephesus according to
[23:36] acts 19
[23:38] in whom ye also trusted
[23:40] after that ye heard the word of truth
[23:43] the gospel of your salvation
[23:45] in whom also after that you believed not
[23:48] when ye believed ye were sealed with
[23:51] that holy spirit of promise
[23:53] now here is my point
[23:55] too many of our modernists and even our
[23:57] fundamentalists so called
[24:00] believe unto salvation at a certain
[24:02] specific time which in many cases is
[24:04] called making a decision
[24:06] and that has been called receiving
[24:08] christ or being born again
[24:10] now to receive christ is to receive his
[24:12] spirit
[24:13] to receive his spirit is to be born
[24:15] again
[24:16] to receive his spirit is to be baptized
[24:18] with the holy ghost
[24:20] amen these folks believe
[24:23] that is wonderful
[24:24] but they stop there
[24:27] you receive the holy ghost after you
[24:29] believe
[24:30] it has always been that way and always
[24:32] will be
[24:33] the very first word of direction to the
[24:35] people was by peter at pentecost and he
[24:37] said
[24:38] repent and be baptized every one of you
[24:40] in the name of jesus christ for the
[24:43] remission of sins and you shall receive
[24:45] the gift of the holy ghost
[24:47] for the promise is unto you and to your
[24:49] children and to all that are afar off
[24:52] even as many as the lord our god shall
[24:54] call
[24:57] the misunderstanding of john chapter 3
[25:00] verse 3.
[25:02] friends a viewer asked me about john
[25:04] chapter 3 verse 3 and tried to say this
[25:06] verse proves all believers are born
[25:09] again
[25:10] let's read john 3 verse 3.
[25:12] jesus answered and said to him verily
[25:14] verily i say unto thee except the man be
[25:16] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[25:18] god
[25:20] i agree jesus said you must be born
[25:22] again but he said you must be born again
[25:24] in order to see or understand the
[25:26] kingdom of god
[25:27] in other words you must be born again to
[25:29] understand god's current holy ghost
[25:32] dispensation because jesus said the
[25:34] kingdom of god is within you so the
[25:36] kingdom of god is the baptism of the
[25:38] holy ghost living in a believer's soul
[25:40] that's according to luke 17 verse 21
[25:43] which says neither shall they say lo
[25:46] here or
[25:47] or lo there for behold the kingdom of
[25:49] god is within you
[25:51] so the viewer misunderstood john 3 verse
[25:54] 3. jesus was saying you must receive the
[25:56] baptism of the holy ghost in order to
[25:58] understand the kingdom of god while
[26:00] living on this earth
[26:02] but we also know jesus taught there was
[26:03] two kinds of christians in matthew 25
[26:06] verses 1 through 13 there's wise and
[26:08] foolish only the wise had the oil or the
[26:11] baptism of the holy ghost
[26:13] only the wise then would understand the
[26:15] kingdom of god but that doesn't mean the
[26:17] foolish virgin did not exist they did
[26:19] exist they just didn't understand the
[26:21] kingdom of god
[26:23] and that's exactly what we have today we
[26:25] have wise virgins who are born again of
[26:27] the baptism of the holy ghost with the
[26:28] oil of the holy ghost and we have
[26:30] foolish virgins alive today who are
[26:32] saved their virgins the word they are
[26:35] pure to the word of god having no
[26:37] spiritual intercourse with the world or
[26:39] idolatry
[26:40] but they are not born again
[26:42] paul tells us born-again christians are
[26:45] currently translated into the spiritual
[26:47] kingdom of god in colossians 1 verses 13
[26:50] and 14. it says who hath delivered us
[26:53] from the power of darkness and hath
[26:55] translated us into the kingdom of his
[26:56] dear son in whom we have redemption
[26:59] through his blood even the forgiveness
[27:01] of sins
[27:02] because we have the kingdom of god now
[27:04] in our souls the baptism of the holy
[27:06] ghost we will rule in this life over sin
[27:09] death the devil and the flesh
[27:12] and as a reward for ruling in the
[27:14] kingdom of god now we'll rule and reign
[27:16] in the future kingdom of god later as
[27:19] revelation 20 verses 4 5 and 6 plainly
[27:22] say
[27:23] i'm just going to read a portion of
[27:24] these scriptures it's about the souls of
[27:27] them that did not worship the beast or
[27:29] the antichrist spirit which is in the
[27:31] roman catholic church and her daughter
[27:33] protestant churches and the bible said
[27:35] they lived and reigned with christ a
[27:37] thousand years
[27:39] in verse six it calls them blessed
[27:41] and then said they shall be priests of
[27:43] god and of christ and shall reign with
[27:45] him a thousand years
[27:47] notice verse 5 says the rest of the dead
[27:49] live not again until the thousand years
[27:51] were finished this is the first
[27:53] resurrection
[27:54] so only the wise virgin or the holy
[27:56] ghost filled saints will live during the
[27:59] millennium a thousand years of peace
[28:01] the rest of the dead that did not have
[28:03] the oil like the foolish virgins that
[28:06] were not ready for the rapture will miss
[28:08] both the rapture and the millennium
[28:10] it's likely their souls will be in
[28:12] heaven somewhere under the altar just as
[28:15] the blinded jews are under the altar as
[28:17] well still save for the word of god and
[28:19] the testimony that they held
[28:22] so holy ghost-filled believers have the
[28:23] kingdom of god living in them now and
[28:26] because of that we'll rule and reign in
[28:27] the millennial kingdom with christ for a
[28:30] thousand years
[28:31] but i want to show a scripture as well
[28:32] that shows the foolish virgin have a
[28:35] place in the future home outside the new
[28:37] jerusalem city so the foolish virgin
[28:40] have a part of the future kingdom to
[28:42] come as the bible says they're likely
[28:45] kings of the earth that bring glory into
[28:48] the bridegroom city the city of the
[28:51] bridegroom jesus christ and his bride
[28:54] the holy ghost filled church
[28:56] in matthew 25 verses 34 through 37 jesus
[29:00] speaks of a righteous group these are
[29:02] the foolish virgins and in verse 34 he
[29:04] says then shall the king say unto them
[29:07] on his right hand come ye blessed of my
[29:09] father inherit the kingdom prepared for
[29:11] you from the foundation of the world
[29:14] of course this is the white throne
[29:15] judgment which is after the rapture in
[29:17] the millennium and jesus gives these
[29:19] foolish virgins a place in the kingdom
[29:22] but it would not be the same place as
[29:23] jesus's bride
[29:25] or wise virgins who had the holy ghost
[29:27] the kingdom of god during their
[29:28] lifetimes
[29:30] according to the authoritative words of
[29:32] jesus in luke 17 verse 21 and matthew 25
[29:37] verses 8 and 9 wise virgins have the
[29:41] kingdom or rule of the holy ghost now
[29:44] inside their souls but foolish virgins
[29:46] do not yet have the kingdom in their
[29:48] souls because they are not yet born
[29:50] again they do not have the oil
[29:54] but they will have a position in the
[29:55] future kingdom in the new jerusalem
[29:58] described in revelation chapters 21-22
[30:03] the bride of jesus christ is ever with
[30:05] the lord beginning at the rapture
[30:08] according to first thessalonians 4 verse
[30:09] 17
[30:11] then we which are alive and remain shall
[30:13] be caught up together with them in the
[30:14] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[30:16] so shall we ever be with the lord
[30:19] just like in jesus parable the ten
[30:20] virgins the wise virgins went out to
[30:22] meet jesus the bridegroom at the rapture
[30:25] the foolish virgin miss the rapture
[30:28] so they shall not ever be with the lord
[30:30] they've got to go through the
[30:30] tribulation
[30:32] and then during the millennium they're
[30:33] not on the earth they're up in heaven
[30:35] somewhere likely under the altar like
[30:37] the saved jews who are blinded to the
[30:39] gospel but the holy ghost-filled bride
[30:41] of jesus christ will always be with the
[30:43] lord beginning at the rapture
[30:45] the battle of armageddon the millennium
[30:48] the bride will sit with jesus on his
[30:49] throne at the great white throne
[30:51] judgment and then the bride of jesus
[30:53] christ will live with jesus christ in
[30:54] the city itself
[30:56] the future home the new jerusalem
[30:59] for those who love details though there
[31:02] seems to be a very short time when the
[31:04] bride is not with the lord jesus
[31:06] after the rapture which would be during
[31:08] the marriage supper of the lamb when
[31:10] jesus descends to earth to reveal
[31:12] himself to his brethren the 144 thousand
[31:15] jews as revelation chapter 14 records
[31:21] i believe revelation 21 verse 24 shows
[31:24] how the foolish virgin will have a place
[31:26] in the future home kingdom for the bible
[31:28] says and the nations of them which are
[31:30] saved shall walk in the light of it and
[31:32] the kings of the earth do bring their
[31:34] glory and honor into it so i believe the
[31:37] foolish virgins are these kings of the
[31:39] earth
[31:40] that do not live in the city itself with
[31:42] christ and his holy ghost-filled bride
[31:44] but they bring their glory and honor
[31:46] into the city
[31:47] but foolish virgins should be encouraged
[31:49] because jesus said they're blessed of
[31:51] his father and they will inherit the
[31:53] kingdom prepared for them from the
[31:55] foundation of the world in other words
[31:57] jesus foreknows all that are saved
[31:59] whether they go all the way to the
[32:01] baptism of the holy ghost or just stop
[32:03] at justification or sanctification
[32:05] our god is rich in mercy and loves all
[32:08] those who are saved sanctified or filled
[32:10] with the holy ghost
[32:13] in closing
[32:14] i hope this video was a blessing and was
[32:17] helpful using bible proofs to show that
[32:19] believers can be saved but not yet born
[32:21] again let me encourage you if you're
[32:24] saved i rejoice in that praise the lord
[32:26] hallelujah but make sure your experience
[32:28] matches the book of acts
[32:30] if you're saved does your life match
[32:32] that of cornelius are you praying
[32:34] fasting and giving alms on your way to
[32:36] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[32:38] i would encourage you to follow the
[32:40] example of cornelius if you're not sure
[32:42] if you're born again or not
[32:44] set your affections on things above pray
[32:47] fast give alms in secret
[32:49] do all those things in secret where the
[32:50] heavenly father sees you and then he'll
[32:52] reward you openly by receiving the
[32:54] baptism of the holy ghost acts 5 32 said
[32:58] god gives the holy ghost to all them
[33:00] that obey him
[33:02] remember paul's wonderful question have
[33:04] ye received the holy ghost since you
[33:06] believed
[33:07] i pray you will believe until you are
[33:09] filled with the holy ghost baptized with
[33:11] the holy ghost in your soul
[33:14] if you have any questions concerns or
[33:16] testimonies about this video please
[33:18] contact me
[33:21] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[33:23] the desire of your heart
