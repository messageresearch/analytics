Description:
The themes of this chapter include: The Beast Out of the Sea, The Beast Out of the Earth, The Mark of the Beast, and The Number of the Beast - 666. 

The Mark of the Beast will be a unionized religious system. The mark in the hand will be obedience to the will of the Roman Kingdom. The mark in the forehead will be believing the false doctrine of Rome. 

The Number of the Beast, 666, can be calculated using Roman Numerals in the Pope's title, "Vicarius Filii Dei". The Pope of Rome will be the person of the Antichrist. Revelation 13:3 proves this, for the "woman," or Roman Catholic Church, rides the "beast," or fourth and final kingdom. Since the Pope rules the R.C.C., the Pope will be head of the world-wide antichrist system.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Revelation chapter 13 the themes of this chapter include the beast out of the sea and the beast out of the earth and the number of the beast which is 666 due to this chapter being highly symbolic we will cover the symbols key revelations and timing altogether chronologically in verses 1 & 2 the beast out of the sea was the kingdom of Imperial Rome which was identified by Daniel as the fourth and final Gentile kingdom that would rule the world before the second coming of Jesus Christ to the earth see Daniel 2 verses 31 to 45 Babylon was the head of gold the Medes and Persians were the arms and chest of silver the Grecians were the belly of thighs and brass and Rome was the legs and feet of iron in clay the timing of the rule of Imperial Rome or the Empire of Rome was around 27 BC which was not long after the fall of the Grecian Empire in 323 BC the Roman Empire was said to fall during the fifth century AD this Roman Empire rose out of the sea which represents people's multitudes nations and tongues according to revelation 17 verse 15 the seven heads represent the seven mountains or Hills that ancient Rome sat upon revelation 17 verse 9 the ten horns are ten future kings of the earth according to revelation 17 verse 12 that will give their power to the Holy Roman Empire during the Tribulation Period the Beast will be seen again in Revelation chapter 17 but we'll be carrying a woman or church which is the Roman Catholic Church this beast or roman empire was liken unto a leopard with the feet of a bear and the mouth of a lion these animals were first mentioned in Daniel chapter 7 verses 1 to 8 as four kingdoms and were the same kingdoms from Daniel chapter 2 and the dream of King Nebuchadnezzar the fact that all these three different kingdoms are now combined into the fourth and final Kingdom means that the demon powers of the first three kingdoms Babylon Medes and Persians Grecians were now empowering the fourth and last Roman Empire this is because men died but demons do not die they just move on to dwellin and possess other men the dragon is again mentioned which is Satan as we saw in Revelation 12 verse 9 Satan is ultimately the one who gave the Roman Empire its power seat and great Authority for Satan is called the god of this world in 2nd Corinthians 4 verse 4 and has the greatest influence over every human government on the face of the earth according to Jesus in Luke chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 in verses 3 and 4 the beast or Roman Empire fell from a deadly wound as history said the Imperial Roman Empire fell in the fifth century AD but the demonic spirit of Rome got a new lease on life as it channelled its power into the Holy Roman Empire the rise of the Holy Roman Empire has been so great that no one has been able to make war against the Vatican just as the scripture said in verses 5 through 10 this Holy Roman Empire scene making war and dominating the entire world during the tribulation period which will last 42 months or three and a half years the Vatican will eventually make war against Israel who were called Saints in Revelation 13 verse 7 the Vatican also commits a three-fold blasphemy according to verse 6 for the Roman Catholic Church has blaspheme God's name by changing it to Father Son Holy Ghost instead of the Lord Jesus Christ second the Vatican blaspheme the heavenly tabernacle by calling Rome the Eternal City lastly the Roman Catholic Church blasting them in heaven which means the dead Saints by offering prayers to them which is a form of spiritualism and is never commanded by Scripture in verses 11 through 18 the beast out of the earth is the same demonic spirit of Rome disguised behind the Holy Roman Empire but now it's operating through the United States of America notice the Beast rose out of the land and not the sea as sea represents multitudes of people showing that the North American continent had a very small human population when the United States was in its infancy this beasts had two horns like a lamb but was not a lamb so the two horns represent those of a baby bison or Buffalo in May 2016 former President Barack Obama and the US government made the buffalo the official mammal of our country helping to further declare that the United States is the beast out of the earth the United States clearly speaks as a dragon or as Satan for the United States of America is the policeman of the world due to its economic and military strength the US has the power the first Beast the Beast out of the sea for the United States is a modern-day Rome exercising financial and military control and influence over much of the world a key revelation about the United States is that this beast is able to make fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men which represents the two atomic bombs that the United States dropped over the Japanese cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in August of 1945 we believe that one day in the near future the United States will be leaders in setting up an image of the Beast according to verse 15 this image will be a world council of false Christian churches that will be granted great political power to cause anyone to be killed who will not worship and obey their unionised religious group this unionized false Christian religion will force everyone to take a mark either in their hand or forehead or they cannot buy or sell it seems the mark in the right hand represents doing the will of the Religious Council and the mark in the forehead represents believing the false doctrine of the false religious system next let's look at what the mark of the beast will be God's prophets said that the mark of the beast will be some form of unionized religion and Christian denominations will take the mark of the beast now remember your young people remember how brother branham saying and may my words be great with a iron pian of a amount of Steel thus saith the Lord that same thing will happen in religion you belong to a denomination of some sort or you cannot buy ourselves I know it's unpopular speaking it's organization I don't say that forth to be angry I say that because it's true brothers the daily work on one TV show raised up maybe a ball but you know that that was done saying throw without the sphere of God which is the baptism of Holy Ghost Confederation apostasy is the mark of the beast that's just their philosophy do you think them nominations will ever break up their denomination come back to work it's just say if the Lord they won't will they going to the Antichrist exactly it's tough faith or they will in verse 18 we are told that the number of the beast is a number of a man 666 there been many guesses as to the meaning of this number but there is only one man to be revealed in the near future who is closely associated with Rome and has a connection to the number 666 and that is the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church we come to this conclusion because the Pope has been given the title the Charis fili day or Vicar of gods as seen in this google screenshot the Roman numerals for Vaqueros filly day add up to the exact number of 666 furthermore the second proof that the office of the Pope will be the office of the person of the Antichrist comes from revelation 17 which states that the woman who sits on seven mountains or Hills the Roman Catholic Church sits upon or rides the beast or demonic spirit of Rome if the Roman Catholic Church is the one controlling the fourth and final kingdom of Rome then the Pope who is the head of their false church is the only person who could rule the entire world as the person of the Antichrist if you would like more bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the book of Revelation please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
