[0:02] but to me the Bible is the infallible
[0:07] word of
[0:08] Goden and I believe that God has watched
[0:11] over his word that there's not one
[0:14] punctuation out of
[0:17] place greetings friends in the matchless
[0:19] name of the Lord Jesus Christ welcome to
[0:22] part one of our podcast series on Bible
[0:26] translations specifically looking at how
[0:28] the King James version is the only
[0:30] infallible accurate translation of the
[0:33] Holy Bible this will be a short video
[0:35] introduction and then a longer audio
[0:38] podcast will follow so the purpose of
[0:40] this series is to humbly show why I am a
[0:43] King James version only preacher and as
[0:46] you'll see so is my brother Cameron
[0:47] Smith he's a pastor in Napoleon Ohio and
[0:50] as some of you may know in my 2020
[0:52] debate with Rod Bergen I stated the
[0:54] seven reasons I am a King James version
[0:57] only pastor and as this podcast series
[0:59] will show brother cam has done a lot of
[1:01] research in this area a lot of study so
[1:03] I'm very thankful for that he knows a
[1:05] lot more about this topic than I do so
[1:07] please contact me if you want to reach
[1:08] out and get in touch with brother cam
[1:10] with questions about Bible versions so
[1:13] this is the first part of a few
[1:14] recordings on this topic of King James
[1:17] version only and we hope to have a few
[1:20] more by the grace of God maybe in a week
[1:21] or a couple weeks we'll see how the Lord
[1:23] leads recall Revelation 2218 and 19 If
[1:27] any man adds to the Bible plagues will
[1:30] be added unto him and verse 19 is
[1:32] especially important for this topic If
[1:34] any man takes away from the words of the
[1:36] book of this prophecy God shall take
[1:38] away his part out of the book of life
[1:40] and out of the holy city and from the
[1:42] things which are written in this book I
[1:44] just want to make a quick Point there's
[1:46] over 31,000 verses in the King James
[1:48] version Bible and every other
[1:50] translation takes lots of words away
[1:53] from the King James version Bible so
[1:55] they're in danger of having their part
[1:58] taken out of the book of life is a very
[1:59] very serious thing here's a book brother
[2:01] cam gave me it's called look what's
[2:03] missing and the author of this book
[2:05] David Daniels he only sampled 257 verses
[2:10] remember there's over 31,000 in the King
[2:12] James version he sampled 257 only and I
[2:16] want to show you this I'll do a
[2:17] screenshot of this out of those
[2:19] 257 95% of those
[2:22] 257 are negatively affected in the NIV
[2:26] 91% of them are negatively affected in
[2:28] the ESV
[2:30] and then 78% of them are affected in the
[2:33] Amplified version and those are just a
[2:35] few of the Bible versions remember it's
[2:37] a curse to change just one word or take
[2:40] one word away from God's word and
[2:42] finally I just want to make a few
[2:43] statements about brother brandham our
[2:45] precious Prophet was not explicitly a
[2:48] King James version only preacher as
[2:50] we'll show in future podcasts numerous
[2:53] quotes show this but he has other quotes
[2:55] about not adding or taking away one word
[2:59] of God or not taking away one word of
[3:01] the Bible and so brother Ram's quotes
[3:03] lead me and brother Cam and numerous
[3:06] other preachers to be King James version
[3:09] only because of those quotes I'll put a
[3:11] few of these quotes at the end of the
[3:13] podcast after brother Cam and I get done
[3:15] with our first recording here's a few
[3:17] samples brother brand said a genuine
[3:19] Faith Of God will never add nothing to
[3:21] it and of course that also includes
[3:23] takeaway because he's quoting Revelation
[3:25] 2218 and 19 brother Ram said in 1960 I
[3:29] want to be found innocent of ever trying
[3:31] to add one thing to the word or take
[3:33] away I want to believe it just exactly
[3:36] the way it is teach the people to tow
[3:37] right up to it when brother an went
[3:40] beyond the curtain of time he said in
[3:41] Jezebel religion 1961 I preached every
[3:44] word just exactly the way Paul did don't
[3:46] want to add one thing to it to take one
[3:49] thing away from it just what the Bible
[3:52] said and then spoken word Original Seed
[3:54] brother Bram said there's not one
[3:55] punctuation out of place in God's
[3:58] infallible Bible the word word of God so
[4:01] I'll put some of these quotes at the end
[4:02] hope you enjoy this podcast here it's
[4:04] part one of Bible translations why we're
[4:06] King James version
[4:15] [Music]
[4:24] only God bless you and welcome to the
[4:27] defending the message podcast I'm your
[4:29] host pastor Pastor Jesse Smith in
[4:30] today's podcast we're going to start the
[4:32] next topic of looking at bible versions
[4:35] and we're going to prove by the grace of
[4:37] God that the only trustworthy Bible
[4:39] translation is the King James version
[4:42] the authorized version our listeners
[4:44] will know that I've talked about this
[4:45] off and on for the past few months and
[4:47] we finally got a chance my brother and I
[4:49] to sit down and record the first part to
[4:51] this series hopefully by God's grace so
[4:54] I know this topic will be a blessing to
[4:55] you and again I want to State and most
[4:57] of my listeners will know that I'm not
[4:59] trying trying to create a man-made
[5:01] Doctrine here I'm not trying to cause
[5:04] division here we're just trying to show
[5:06] the truth of God's word and promote the
[5:08] purity of the King James version this is
[5:11] going to all be spoken in brotherly
[5:12] kindness and love it seems most people
[5:15] are just unaware of the facts on this
[5:18] subject and we hope this will be a
[5:19] blessing to all those who are hungering
[5:21] and thirsting for righteousness so with
[5:23] that I want to let my brother cam
[5:25] introduce himself and then we'll get
[5:26] into the topic here by the grace of God
[5:28] all right God bless you you brother it's
[5:30] a blessing to to be speaking with you
[5:32] today about these things um yeah my name
[5:35] is Cameron Smith uh I'm a pastor in
[5:37] thepo Ohio at a church Living Waters and
[5:42] we've been pastoring for about uh almost
[5:44] 16 years and by God's help we have kind
[5:48] of followed that same line you have uh
[5:51] we we desire truth from the inward parts
[5:54] and uh it's our desire brother uh that
[5:57] we might be able to uh Converse on the
[5:59] these things and and to be able to bring
[6:02] some clarification about Bible versions
[6:04] uh it's a very important topic uh I
[6:06] would say even in the message of the
[6:07] hour even right now uh it is more
[6:11] important than it has ever been before
[6:15] and hopefully very soon here we'll be
[6:17] able to get to some of the points to
[6:19] prove that so yeah brother that's uh we
[6:22] appreciate your labor we appreciate your
[6:24] love for the people uh and and your
[6:26] desire to forward them in Christ and I I
[6:29] believe that's desires will yeah I'm
[6:30] very thankful for this topic and uh as
[6:32] I've said before I wouldn't have my
[6:34] current understanding without you
[6:35] brother cam as far as God leading you
[6:37] into these studies and that I've been
[6:39] able to listen to your sermons online
[6:41] it's been a tremendous eyeopener to me
[6:43] so I'm thankful that the Lord LED you
[6:45] into this I mean I've kind of known
[6:46] about this topic over the years in my
[6:49] 2020 debate with Rod Bergen I mentioned
[6:52] the seven reasons I'm King James version
[6:54] only and I've never changed that stance
[6:56] but I appreciate how the Lord LED you
[6:58] into this cuz that's what it's all about
[7:00] like you said it must be for this time
[7:02] in season um that God's put this on your
[7:04] heart the last few years uh because the
[7:07] word of God is being attacked like never
[7:09] before and of course we're nearing the
[7:10] coming of the Lord so I just want to
[7:11] thank you for that brother and uh may
[7:14] the Lord Jesus Christ bless this here
[7:16] Amen brother and I'm and I'm so glad
[7:17] that you've stuck with that King James
[7:20] uh only approach it is the true approach
[7:23] and even now there's more evidence than
[7:26] ever before within the last 10 years
[7:28] that that is 100%
[7:31] factual and if I could start this out
[7:34] brother maybe my testimony just a little
[7:37] bit um we were raised in a Christian
[7:39] home but yet at the uh age of about 1920
[7:43] uh the late 90s there we had come into a
[7:46] spot where we were actually we gave our
[7:49] lives to the Lord Jesus Christ and we
[7:51] were in the Assemblies of God church and
[7:54] you know the first thing I asked I said
[7:55] well what type of Bible should I get I
[7:58] mean I I want to read the right uh the
[7:59] right version and I I want to be able to
[8:02] understand it and you know what they
[8:04] told me was they told me to actually use
[8:06] an NIV Bible uh so I bought that and uh
[8:10] you know an early Christian you're on
[8:11] fire you're loving the Lord you're
[8:14] you're you're rejoicing at all the
[8:15] things that he's uh now drawn you to
[8:17] because the spirit of God is moving on
[8:19] you that direction so you you instantly
[8:21] get that Zeal and that thrill and uh so
[8:25] we got that Bible and boy did weere it
[8:27] we we read and read and read and I got a
[8:28] big big J one the one that's got all the
[8:31] the notes in it everything like that and
[8:32] one night I was reading and and this is
[8:35] the the opening of my experience with
[8:37] Bible versions um I actually got to uh a
[8:42] place in Matthew 18 where I was reading
[8:45] and I actually before this podcast I got
[8:48] on uh NIV online and and I actually went
[8:52] to the same portion and to my surprise
[8:54] uh it is the same today online as what
[8:58] it was before before so uh let me read
[9:01] it directly from uh the NIV online here
[9:04] uh in Matthew
[9:06] 1810 it says here it says see that you
[9:09] do not despise one of these little ones
[9:12] for I tell you that their angels in
[9:14] heaven always see the face of my Father
[9:17] in Heaven that's verse 10 then directly
[9:20] the next verse uh is verse 12 and it
[9:24] says what do you think uh if a man owns
[9:26] a hundred sheep and one of them wanders
[9:29] away will he not leave the 99 on the
[9:31] hills and go to look for the one that
[9:34] wandered off and uh as I read that as a
[9:36] young believer I seen why in the world
[9:41] does it go straight from verse 10 to 12
[9:45] where's verse 11 and uh I honestly the
[9:49] first thought that come to my mind was
[9:51] there must be a misprint in this Bible I
[9:55] bought a bad Bible somehow the factory
[9:57] messed it up so so I got another Bible
[10:00] and I I took a look at it and I'm like
[10:02] well what is supposed to be there and
[10:06] and I grabbed a King James Bible and uh
[10:09] so I read the 11th verse uh and it said
[10:13] for the son of man is come to save that
[10:17] which was
[10:18] lost and so I went back to the NIV and
[10:23] you know what in 10 or 12 that part is
[10:27] not even in either one
[10:29] so it's not that they threw it in a
[10:31] different verse and just got rid of 11
[10:33] uh they actually got rid of the phrase
[10:36] for the son of man is come to save that
[10:39] which was lost uh I don't know about you
[10:40] brother Jesse but that's uh uh well I
[10:43] think I know about you as far as this
[10:45] but that is a very important verse and
[10:48] one we shouldn't cut out uh so
[10:51] immediately I I began to study it out
[10:52] the internet was you know fairly new at
[10:54] that point in time as far as uh for me
[10:57] but uh I got online and I and I found
[10:59] out that they didn't put that in there
[11:01] because they said it was not part of the
[11:03] earliest and most reliable
[11:06] manuscripts so that was one of my wakeup
[11:09] points very early on as a Christian uh
[11:12] to show me that there's something going
[11:15] on here a little bit deeper in me so
[11:16] it's not that it was a misprint uh it
[11:19] was actually something that was done
[11:21] intentionally so there was uh you know
[11:24] and and I love it the scripture says
[11:25] that you know the the Lord will guide
[11:27] you to all truth and right off the
[11:30] beginning of my experience in Christ I
[11:32] found out that you know there it is
[11:35] there is a discrepancy between this
[11:38] Bible and other Bibles amen that's an
[11:40] excellent point about God's hand of
[11:43] Mercy God's sovereignty over your life
[11:45] of course all of our lives but you see
[11:46] it in your life God wanted to guide you
[11:48] into all truth and showed you right away
[11:51] how this Bible version was intentionally
[11:54] and I like that word CU it's the evil
[11:55] spirit right it's the Antichrist Spirit
[11:57] behind this Bible version
[11:59] that's intentionally trying to take away
[12:02] words of God uh and we know there's all
[12:05] kinds of warnings against taking away
[12:07] the word of God Proverbs
[12:08] 35-6 uh Revelation 22:18-19 Galatians 1
[12:12] 6-12 there's so many warnings that we
[12:15] must preserve the word of God and we
[12:18] must receive every word of God so
[12:20] excellent story I love that story I
[12:21] never had heard that before till you
[12:23] preached it on a recent sermon and I was
[12:24] so so uh surprised but then so thankful
[12:27] God guided you into all Tre truth Amen
[12:30] brother um and if I could if I could
[12:32] just bring a point up just very quickly
[12:35] here because the twisting and resting of
[12:38] scripture that Paul talked about it is
[12:41] actually written about in the Old
[12:44] Testament uh so even showing that even
[12:46] in the Hebrew text they were already
[12:50] dealing with uh scribes and so forth
[12:55] that were doing things with the word of
[12:58] God that they shouldn't have done
[12:59] and for that you you go Jeremiah 8 it's
[13:02] be 5-9 but I'll just read 89 says how do
[13:07] ye say we are wise and the law of the
[13:12] Lord is with us Lo certainly in vain
[13:16] made he it the pen of the scribes is in
[13:21] vain the wise men are asham they are
[13:23] dismayed and taken uh Lo they have
[13:26] rejected the word of the Lord and what
[13:27] wiom is in them so so if you look at
[13:30] that portion of scripture said the pen
[13:34] of the scribes was in
[13:38] vain so they were actually altering
[13:41] writing things that should not have been
[13:44] now uh very interestingly you can you
[13:46] can see that at this point in time with
[13:48] Jeremiah they're getting ready to go to
[13:49] Babylon you know from there they they
[13:51] actually wrote the the uh Babylonian
[13:54] talet so and and of course there are
[13:56] other writings that came forth there you
[13:58] know some Reed that uh uh part of the
[14:01] book of uh Enoch actually came forth at
[14:03] that point in time so but there was
[14:05] already little sex rising up and and
[14:07] writing things to fit their own
[14:09] perspective about what they thought
[14:11] about God or what they felt that
[14:13] supposedly God was revealing to them wow
[14:16] it's amazing verse brother i' never seen
[14:17] that before that was Jeremiah 8 ver8
[14:19] right yes praise God so now you can see
[14:22] again how this is a problem the
[14:24] Believers have had down Through the Ages
[14:26] right it stting the Garden of Eden with
[14:28] the serpent
[14:29] and now I never saw that but I never saw
[14:31] that it was in Jeremiah as well yeah so
[14:34] what we're what's impressed upon us is
[14:38] literally Satan from the very get-go has
[14:42] trying to make the church disbelieve
[14:46] their weapon uh brother brandham worked
[14:48] with that you know I believe it was the
[14:51] was it in the greatest battle ever
[14:52] fought uh but he he basically brought
[14:55] out that Satan's great weapon is to get
[14:58] you to disbelieve your weapon which is
[15:01] the word of God see his attack watch
[15:05] listen close this closing his attack is
[15:07] what disbelieve God's word that's his
[15:11] attack now can you see the greatest
[15:12] battle he ever fought there's only two
[15:15] forces Satan and
[15:17] God and what's Satan's
[15:20] weapon against you is to try to get you
[15:22] to dis believe your weapon he disarms
[15:25] you let's let's listen real quiet now
[15:27] listen if he can get you to disbelieve
[15:31] your weapon
[15:33] is equivalent if he gets you to believe
[15:37] that your weapon is not strong enough
[15:40] he's disarmed
[15:42] you oh brother Neville I hope we
[15:46] never look he's disarmed you when he
[15:49] gets you to disbel that weapon when you
[15:52] lay that down it finishes your fight
[15:54] you're done hold that weapon don't you
[15:57] lay it down we sees unb so uh if you
[16:02] have a perfect word you can have perfect
[16:05] Faith so you know that's our aim and
[16:08] intention because we also know that that
[16:09] is required for rapturing faith
[16:12] rapturing faith requires perfect
[16:15] word uh so the next thing that comes to
[16:18] our mind as far as uh there I was I was
[16:21] coming out of uh ably of God and and
[16:23] honestly um I just kept reading the NIV
[16:27] Bible I asked others about it and they
[16:29] said well they're basically the same but
[16:32] but you know it's it's very easy for uh
[16:35] sheep especially young sheep just to
[16:38] follow the older sheep uh because you
[16:41] know there's a confidence in you when
[16:43] you see a Christian life and you think
[16:46] that what they're doing is right so
[16:48] almost right off the beginning of my
[16:51] testimony uh I found out that I was
[16:53] beginning to follow the majority I was
[16:55] following those who I felt I could trust
[16:58] uh especially regarding uh Bible
[17:01] versions so until literally until I came
[17:06] to the spot where God revealed this
[17:08] message to me uh in
[17:10] 2002 um I was following the NIV Bible
[17:14] but you know I was taking a a basic uh
[17:17] nominal Christian approach and and it
[17:20] actually took the crying out for truth
[17:23] um and then when God brought the message
[17:25] to me um that was the opening the door
[17:29] where all of a sudden this really became
[17:31] a critical thing I I come to the message
[17:35] and I found there that the King James
[17:38] Bible um it was the Bible everyone was
[17:41] using um actually at that point in time
[17:43] I never heard of any other message
[17:45] believer using any other Bible but then
[17:48] uh perhaps right around 2008
[17:51] 2010 uh I began to hear that preachers
[17:55] in the message or individuals in the
[17:57] message were actually using other Bibles
[18:00] and uh that to me was a little bit
[18:02] alarming and and it kind of reversed in
[18:05] my mind wait a minute when I first come
[18:08] into this I was actually brought right
[18:11] to that spot that they were taking
[18:13] things out of the Bible and now I'm
[18:15] seeing that people in the message are
[18:17] beginning to do the same thing so uh it
[18:21] was something that it really altered my
[18:23] my thinking about what was right and
[18:26] what was wrong and what was going on um
[18:29] so basically what's happened over the
[18:32] last 10 12 14 years is as I began to
[18:35] devote myself to start understanding uh
[18:38] the actual argument and uh you'll
[18:41] actually find within that argument that
[18:44] there are actually two
[18:46] families of
[18:49] manuscripts that are followed and that
[18:53] is where and why we have all these
[18:55] different
[18:56] versions so the King James the
[19:00] authorized King James because many have
[19:02] actually tried to modernize it and they
[19:03] they try to do it with the modern text
[19:06] but uh actually you'll find that it was
[19:09] in
[19:10] 1881 that Westcott and Hort were
[19:13] actually involved with wanting to get
[19:17] away from what they would term the
[19:20] villainous King James version and what
[19:24] their desire was was to come up with an
[19:26] entirely different Bible that would be
[19:29] written from a different Source um so
[19:32] from there they actually had what they
[19:35] would call the alexandrian family uh
[19:38] which is different from the ACT bisan
[19:40] tee family which the King James version
[19:43] was written from uh so just very quickly
[19:46] for this idea so literally the King
[19:49] James Bible is the only Bible that is
[19:53] exclusively written from the bantine
[19:56] manuscripts which is actually 90% of the
[19:59] textual
[20:00] evidence the alexandrian family and this
[20:04] will be a surprise for those who are
[20:07] uneducated on on the topic which is okay
[20:09] because most people don't even look into
[20:11] this uh and that's okay I didn't either
[20:13] until it was forced upon me by the Holy
[20:15] Spirit but uh anyway all the new
[20:19] versions every single one of them
[20:21] including the new King James um they are
[20:24] either altered or written exclusively
[20:28] from the Codex
[20:30] vaticanus or uh the Bible that the
[20:34] Vatican had uh and of course that's they
[20:38] say 93% written that way or 90% the the
[20:42] new versions are written from the
[20:43] exclusively from the Codex of adanus so
[20:46] and and what they make up the rest of is
[20:47] they say 7% of it is actually from codex
[20:51] cicus and then the other 3% is from the
[20:53] alexandrian Scrolls so that is very
[20:57] important now
[20:59] uh So what had happened then is so all
[21:03] these new versions are actually written
[21:06] from the Codex
[21:08] vaticanus which is the Vatican so uh we
[21:12] can go into this later but uh uh for you
[21:15] and I that are Protestants uh that
[21:17] should have an alarm just a a bell
[21:20] that's ringing uh incessantly in uh
[21:23] increasingly in our minds that wait a
[21:25] minute wait a minute wait a minute these
[21:27] uh this Catholic Church church and you
[21:29] know we we respect and love people in
[21:31] there but this system is actually killed
[21:34] according to their own martyrology uh 68
[21:37] million Protestants so so that that
[21:39] brings an alarm up okay what's going on
[21:41] here and why are the new Bibles written
[21:43] from uh a church that once did nothing
[21:47] but tried to burn
[21:49] Bibles so uh that brings it to our mind
[21:52] uh that this is actually an important
[21:53] subject so anyway uh continuing with
[21:57] this thought of the message I began to
[22:00] hear that preachers were using different
[22:02] Bibles and uh recently I I I was alarmed
[22:06] I I was looking at a track from a a
[22:08] different uh message church and it just
[22:12] actually stopped me writing my tracks as
[22:14] I was reading I was just shocked in
[22:16] their track that they witnessed to
[22:18] others uh they had a one- sentence
[22:21] statement at towards the end of the
[22:23] track and it said the King James Bible
[22:26] is the most accurate Bible
[22:30] translation when I read that I was
[22:34] shocked blown away because they were
[22:38] actually saying that the King James
[22:40] Bible was the most accurate they didn't
[22:43] say it was the only accurate they didn't
[22:45] say it was the infallable Bible
[22:48] translation uh but they actually stated
[22:50] that it was the most
[22:52] accurate that is alarming because if you
[22:54] don't have a perfect Bible you can't
[22:56] trust it
[22:59] so uh brother Jesse you and I uh I I
[23:02] believe we were in complete Unity over
[23:04] this thought but uh the King James Bible
[23:07] is actually the only infallable
[23:11] translation so you know with that you
[23:14] know what I found out was that people in
[23:16] the message or or brothers and sisters
[23:18] in this message uh were now beginning to
[23:24] disbelieve the Bible that God gave us
[23:28] and uh that must needs that someone
[23:30] would take a stand so we appreciate what
[23:32] you're doing brother um and it is our
[23:35] desire too we recently we' preached four
[23:38] sermons U working with this and you
[23:40] could just Trail on forever the the
[23:42] information on the King James Bible on
[23:44] the Bible version debate is very
[23:46] interesting it's it's phenomenal uh you
[23:49] can actually get addicted to it as we
[23:51] see some people will so um that that's a
[23:53] good start brother for where we're going
[23:55] there excellent information brother yeah
[23:57] like you said there is so much
[23:58] information available on this um that's
[24:01] a great introduction to this topic my
[24:04] brother one point I think you brought
[24:06] out that truly helped me it's it's as if
[24:09] I'd heard it before but it wasn't until
[24:11] after I heard you teach and preach on it
[24:13] till it really became s in my mind was
[24:15] this major point that all Bibles come
[24:18] from either one of two sources and so
[24:22] the King James version is the only Bible
[24:25] that comes out of the bantine source of
[24:28] Scrolls is that correct brother yeah
[24:31] that that is absolutely
[24:33] correct and you know if we would look
[24:36] into the purpose of why we were actually
[24:40] doing this that would be the whole of it
[24:43] because there must be some type of
[24:46] mentality that someone had a long time
[24:49] ago to undermine people's confidence in
[24:54] the word of God the fact is as I was
[24:58] told that all the bibles are prettyy
[25:00] much the same they are actually uh very
[25:04] much different so literally here's a
[25:09] quotation so we would look at what was
[25:11] called the bantine family uh that the
[25:15] King James was written from and then you
[25:16] would have the Westcott Hort text and
[25:20] here's a quotation it said I said the
[25:22] New Testament was published in England
[25:25] on May 17th
[25:27] 1881 and 3 days later in the United
[25:30] States after 11 years of Labor this is
[25:32] working with the westcot wh text that
[25:34] they had come up with it says over
[25:38] 30,000 changes were made of which more
[25:43] than
[25:44] 5,000 represent differences in the Greek
[25:49] text from that used as the basis of the
[25:52] King James
[25:54] version so right there if you make thir
[25:58] 30,000 changes in the Bible how can you
[26:03] not come up with different Doctrine how
[26:05] can you not come up with obvious errors
[26:08] or mistakes uh you know as I told you as
[26:11] as I was coming into
[26:13] Christianity taking that portion of
[26:15] scripture out Matthew 1811 is very huge
[26:19] in the point of what Jesus Christ was
[26:21] trying to accomplish so that right there
[26:24] is one of those 5,000 ch changes in the
[26:29] Greek text so you know not only do you
[26:32] have different individuals interpreting
[26:34] the Greek but you also have a different
[26:38] Greek text in itself which is very
[26:42] frightening because uh the Bible tells
[26:45] us in Psalms let me get to this
[26:47] scripture here the Bible tells us in
[26:50] Psalms I believe it's 12 verse 6 it says
[26:54] the words of the Lord are pure words as
[26:57] silver tried in in a furnace of fire
[27:00] purified seven times so you and I when
[27:02] we look at a Bible wow this word is it's
[27:07] like silver that was tried in a furnace
[27:08] it's purified it's got to be right 100%
[27:12] verse 127 it says Thou shalt keep them
[27:15] oh Lord Thou shalt preserve them from
[27:18] this generation
[27:21] forever so the psalmist tells us right
[27:24] there that God from even the point of
[27:27] him writing PSAL
[27:29] because a Psalm is a song that he was
[27:31] literally going to preserve every
[27:33] inspired word from that generation
[27:38] forever so uh it's a beautiful thought
[27:41] brother that's an amazing verse brother
[27:43] and uh and then combining that verse
[27:46] with the history we've just shared is
[27:49] life-changing you know especially for
[27:50] someone who wants to read the only true
[27:52] Bible think of that our brother cam
[27:54] stated it 5,000 changes those are 5,000
[27:59] little bits of truth that Satan took
[28:02] away from people uh that's not just one
[28:05] like it was one word in the Garden of
[28:07] Eden right Thou shalt not surely die
[28:10] well now here in 1881 through Westcon
[28:12] Hort Satan has taken over 5,000 little
[28:16] bits of Truth away from the word of God
[28:19] so going back to that point brother cam
[28:21] brought it was so fresh to me so true
[28:23] you know this topic is easily settled by
[28:28] just taking each Bible version and say
[28:31] which source did it come from right so
[28:34] it's so easy that this is the simplest
[28:36] way I think to kind of uh filter it down
[28:39] any other Bible version outside of those
[28:43] using the source Scrolls of the King
[28:45] James version which would have been the
[28:47] bisontine Scrolls will be a false
[28:50] version because they have false Scrolls
[28:52] and then they constantly take away words
[28:56] from the Scrolls that are in the King
[28:57] James version and Scrolls yes sir so let
[29:00] let me add something brother Jesse so
[29:03] what you'll find is they would say well
[29:06] the King James language is archaic so
[29:09] you can't understand it so what would
[29:11] they come up with they would actually
[29:13] come up with a new King James version
[29:17] and what that was supposedly to do was
[29:20] to update the
[29:23] language of the King James version uh so
[29:26] that's part of the issue here because
[29:28] what they tell you is um they're
[29:30] modernizing the language so people can
[29:33] understand it they're they're
[29:35] modernizing it so okay now we can apply
[29:37] this it makes sense because uh the King
[29:40] James is archaic it's it's using words
[29:43] that we don't understand anymore and and
[29:45] so forth but when you actually start
[29:47] looking into the new King James version
[29:51] uh you will find that the changes that
[29:54] they made were actually based on the
[29:56] Westcott Hort t T they did not try to
[30:00] update the language they actually began
[30:02] to change and start hybriding the King
[30:05] James version with ideas from a Westcott
[30:09] hord text um so that's another thing
[30:13] that is very problematic because uh a
[30:15] lot of the preachers in the message you
[30:17] know were told that uh the Amplified
[30:21] Bible was just actually a modernization
[30:24] of the King James Bible uh it was meant
[30:27] to give clarification and understanding
[30:31] uh to the Greek that the Greek these
[30:33] Greek Scholars can help us is what they
[30:36] were told so it'll help us understand
[30:39] what what the real content of the Bible
[30:42] is uh so unfortunately uh these these
[30:46] message preachers and hopefully maybe
[30:47] they'll hear this maybe maybe they'll
[30:49] take a deeper look into it and uh see
[30:52] what the actual agenda is we have uh of
[30:55] course uh we'll have another video uh
[30:58] working with the actual changes because
[31:01] uh what's always said the proof is in
[31:03] the pudding so if I line up a King James
[31:05] Bible and an amplified Bible um if it's
[31:08] just a a language um upgrade or or or
[31:12] some sort of understanding that supposed
[31:14] to help us it should line up very
[31:16] closely with the King James version like
[31:17] almost exact but we'll find that that's
[31:20] not true at all and actually the
[31:23] interpreters of this Amplified Bible uh
[31:25] they began to start putting their own
[31:26] doctrines in there they they started
[31:28] putting their their own thoughts into
[31:30] there and you can't even teach message
[31:33] Doctrine fully through it the scriptures
[31:36] that they change will actually
[31:38] contradict other scriptures that prove
[31:40] that serpent seed's right uh that that
[31:43] prove that the godhead is right and and
[31:45] so on so we are actually sheep and the
[31:50] wall is getting pulled over our eyes
[31:52] even in this message that all these
[31:55] bibles are the same and
[31:58] there it is the Amplified Bible for
[32:00] example is written completely from the
[32:03] westcot Hort text it's not written from
[32:06] the King James at all um if you actually
[32:08] look into the history of it it was it
[32:10] was actually a presbyterian pastor's
[32:12] wife that took the Westcott hord took
[32:16] the Hebrew and she interpreted her own
[32:19] Bible for the people uh she didn't
[32:21] finish it but uh a committee took it on
[32:24] and they finished her work and therefore
[32:26] we have the Amplified Bible which has
[32:28] been updated uh at least twice the most
[32:31] recent time in 2015 so there's a lot
[32:34] there and you know as you can see
[32:36] there's so much information here but
[32:38] really what we would need to do at some
[32:40] point in time is is to actually look at
[32:42] the evidence especially from a message
[32:45] perspective which is what we're looking
[32:46] at and see if this affects what a
[32:51] godsent seventh angel William brandham
[32:54] gave us yeah excellent points there and
[32:56] I didn't know about the Amplified Bible
[32:59] uh coming from the westcot and Hort text
[33:02] so that would be an excellent point to
[33:04] use like let's say you're listening to
[33:05] this as a uh a viewer you know on
[33:08] YouTube or something or a podcast
[33:09] listener and you're concerned about it
[33:12] you know out of the love of God in your
[33:13] heart for the love of the truth right
[33:15] the love of the true word of God the
[33:17] King James version that might be a good
[33:20] point to take to a pastor something like
[33:22] that of course always go in love uh
[33:24] approach with just a a desire for truth
[33:27] and brother know did you know this and
[33:29] you just want to bring that point like
[33:31] even the Amplified Bible is taken from
[33:33] the wrong Source Scrolls yes so that
[33:37] would bring us to the idea that okay
[33:41] well what is the purpose of all of this
[33:47] this is my personal
[33:49] opinion there is some cover up behind it
[33:52] but we do see interaction but I would
[33:54] say that the very purpose of the writing
[33:59] of a new text written from the Greek
[34:03] which even the writers and even some on
[34:05] the committee were Catholics or
[34:08] Jesuits um it was actually a move of The
[34:11] Counter
[34:13] Reformation and the reason it was done
[34:16] was because if you could pull people to
[34:19] a confusion in the word then you could
[34:24] make their experience with Christ lack
[34:28] you could make it dumb down uh so that
[34:31] one they no longer had a full source of
[34:35] Truth and because they didn't have that
[34:38] full ability to have Truth uh you would
[34:41] be able to make them lukewarm which is
[34:44] the characteristic of the seventh Church
[34:46] age it's a lukewarm Church age now it is
[34:50] very obvious from
[34:52] 1881 that when the Protestants took this
[34:55] hookline and sinker and began to move
[34:58] away from the King James Bible that we
[35:01] are living in one of the most perverted
[35:04] uh lukewarm ages of all time right now
[35:08] and now we're seeing it creeping into
[35:10] the message uh at a very rapid pace and
[35:13] uh what is the purpose well according to
[35:16] our Bible
[35:18] Rome was that fourth beast in the Book
[35:21] of Daniel uh Rome of course everything
[35:26] shows that she was to be the last Beast
[35:29] for 2,000 years she's been ruling to
[35:31] some extent and it will end up with her
[35:35] leading a new world order so that's why
[35:38] a lot of these changes are made in the
[35:40] Bible because you actually have to
[35:42] change the content or or lessen uh the
[35:46] detail of the content in order for it
[35:50] not just to make Christianity more lack
[35:53] in its understanding but but it'll
[35:55] actually join it with other religion
[35:58] so that's why you'll find that uh the
[36:01] deity of Jesus Christ many are alarmed
[36:02] even trinitarians are very alarmed
[36:04] because um they'll take Jesus out and
[36:06] say he they'll take the godhead and
[36:09] they'll begin to to loosen it out so so
[36:12] now all of a sudden uh the deity is not
[36:14] so clear so if you just leave a couple
[36:17] scriptures you you'll alter the entire
[36:20] context or the understanding of the
[36:22] Bible which is why you hear a lot of
[36:24] people that are even from a standpoint
[36:27] uh looking at Christianity based with
[36:29] other religions including Islam Judaism
[36:33] and and they will be saying well we're
[36:35] pretty much all the
[36:38] same no we're not uh there's some
[36:42] tremendous differences but but the
[36:44] overall perspective they're trying to
[36:46] Proclaim is to join protestantism back
[36:49] with Catholicism and then join it into
[36:52] an all new world religion and uh they
[36:55] are closer to that than ever ever before
[36:59] yeah I'm just going to say this humbly
[37:00] this is a very fascinating approach uh
[37:02] brother cam God has brought you through
[37:05] and the approach of seeing how this is
[37:07] all working into the one world religion
[37:10] uh I recently made a video about that
[37:11] even at the Republican National
[37:13] Convention they had a an elected
[37:15] official from California open up the
[37:17] convention with a prayer to the Hindu
[37:19] god and in the background on the screens
[37:22] they had the cross of Jesus they had the
[37:24] Star of David and it was basically
[37:27] calling one of these Hindu gods the one
[37:29] true God but trying to unite it with you
[37:32] know Judaism
[37:34] Christianity U the Muslim faith and so
[37:36] forth so that's that's an excellent
[37:38] point you're making and the devil's in
[37:40] this for the long game right he started
[37:41] this in 1881 of course before that but
[37:43] that's when the Westcott Hort text came
[37:45] out and just decade after decade he
[37:47] slowly introduces these false
[37:49] translations into churches and it makes
[37:52] them lukewarm because they don't have a
[37:55] Zeal for the word of God and I love that
[37:56] point you brought out about
[37:58] 1881 uh that was right at the end of the
[38:00] man anointing right there's four
[38:03] anointings there's a lion ox man Eagle
[38:07] so right at the end of the Philadelphian
[38:08] Church age when the man age anointing is
[38:11] going to switch over to the eagle
[38:12] anointing you know Satan brings in this
[38:14] false group of Scrolls through Westcott
[38:17] and Hort and then here at the beginning
[38:18] of the leoan church age it's a lukewarm
[38:21] Age and what better way to make people
[38:23] lukewarm than to start changing the word
[38:25] of God and uh taking away words adding
[38:28] words adding like they Amplified it adds
[38:30] the Trinity into the Bible the word
[38:33] Trinity into the Bible that brother Bram
[38:35] always pointed out the word Trinity is
[38:37] not even in the Bible but now message
[38:39] people are reading a Amplified Bible
[38:42] with the word Trinity now in the Bible
[38:44] That's How Satan has slowly deceived
[38:47] people so it's very important to see
[38:49] that uh in the timing of it I love how
[38:52] you brought in the timing of it even it
[38:53] goes back to Daniel's Vision you know
[38:54] with I'm sorry with Daniel's
[38:56] interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar 's
[38:57] dream you know the iron and the clay the
[39:01] Catholic and Protestant in the feet of
[39:02] the image and this is their way to do it
[39:05] it's one way to do it to get them into
[39:07] one world religion say all all the
[39:09] bibles are basically the same all
[39:11] religions are basically the same and
[39:14] it's the way to make people lukewarm
[39:15] they're not on fire for the true word of
[39:17] God they've got their own false Bible
[39:22] translations that no longer take a stand
[39:24] on certain important major doctrines and
[39:27] remember even taking one word away from
[39:29] his word would be a sin but now they've
[39:31] changed over 5,000 things about the
[39:33] Greek text and of course many many more
[39:35] Bible verses yeah let me add a little
[39:37] bit more support to this so it was
[39:40] always catholicism's desire to take the
[39:44] word of God out of the people's hands
[39:47] that's why in 400 a right right around
[39:49] 400 ad they actually uh paid Jerome to
[39:54] actually write a Latin Vulgate and uh
[39:57] they put it in Latin which was a dead
[39:59] language that no one uh could understand
[40:02] and that was just for the Catholic
[40:03] hierarchy the intelligent people that
[40:06] they could read it alone and no one else
[40:09] could understand it so the common people
[40:12] they removed the word of God from the
[40:15] common people and think about it that
[40:16] was not even changed until you get to
[40:19] the 1400s and the 1500s when uh early
[40:23] Protestants began interpreting it and it
[40:25] was actually the Catholic priests that
[40:28] actually uh you know think about Martin
[40:30] Luther coming out of Catholicism nailing
[40:33] 95 thesises and coming against that uh
[40:36] so we have that perspective but here's
[40:39] another
[40:40] idea the actual history of Catholicism
[40:44] you know we know this from brother
[40:45] brandham and as far as teaching us that
[40:47] in Revelations 13 where it talked about
[40:50] how one of the heads of that Beast out
[40:53] of the uh sea which was Catholicism
[40:56] would killed to death uh so you have a
[41:00] pagan Rome and then in 325 when
[41:03] Constantine rolled on they had a pole
[41:06] Rome so historically you'll find this in
[41:10] history because there are not many
[41:12] manuscripts at all from the early
[41:15] centuries and I mentioned this a little
[41:17] bit ago and I'll mention it again
[41:18] because this is a great point but uh you
[41:21] will find that Pagan Rome did nothing
[41:24] but try to destroy and St St
[41:27] Christianity historically we find even
[41:30] with Diocesan Diocesan according to the
[41:33] church ages he had 10 years where he
[41:36] absolutely tried to kill every Christian
[41:38] he could possibly kill not only that but
[41:41] historically um he burnt every Bible he
[41:45] could find whether right or wrong as far
[41:48] as maybe it could have been a twisted
[41:49] one uh he burned it uh destroyed it
[41:52] destroyed all the evidence well you
[41:54] would think that would change after
[41:58] Constantine because okay now they're
[42:00] Christian well you'll find what they did
[42:03] of course they put it in Latin but then
[42:06] they also burnt every scroll we can find
[42:09] historically um I actually preached a
[42:11] sermon on it it goes all the way up to
[42:14] uh their own councils where they say
[42:16] that their people are forbidden to have
[42:17] a Bible they're forbidden to read the
[42:19] Bible and if they get caught reading one
[42:22] they will have to recant if they don't
[42:23] want to recant they'll die with their
[42:25] Bible they'll get burnt so quotations
[42:27] are still in their Vatican councils that
[42:30] they had Council of of of Trent and so
[42:33] forth um but Americans and Christians
[42:37] don't even realize how soon that these
[42:39] things happened uh if I remember
[42:41] correctly we'll try to get this resource
[42:43] brother but it was right around the mid
[42:45] middle
[42:46] 1800s uh that the Catholics were still
[42:49] uh having Bible burnings in
[42:52] America I believe it was in
[42:54] Massachusetts is where they had it uh I
[42:56] think if I remember WR is 1847 but they
[42:58] were still burning Bibles publicly not
[43:03] not secretly publicly showing their
[43:07] distaste for the word of God well no
[43:10] wonder Catholicism has so many Creeds
[43:13] and dogmas that don't line up with the
[43:15] Bible they're completely against the
[43:17] Bible but claiming that they are the
[43:19] true representative of
[43:22] Christianity so more clearly than ever
[43:25] before uh this is a a tremendously
[43:28] important topic and it is to keep a
[43:31] Protestant a
[43:32] Protestant so we can't go into the image
[43:35] of the Beast we can't go into this
[43:37] system of the joining with Catholicism
[43:39] and that is why all of a sudden they
[43:41] went from burning the Bible to saying
[43:44] okay we have a new text for everyone to
[43:47] have so it it is very beautiful what the
[43:51] spirit of God has revealed to his
[43:53] children in this age Amen brother amen
[43:56] that's powerful I didn't even know they
[43:58] were burning Bibles brother in the 1800s
[44:00] that's unbelievable yeah and frankly why
[44:04] don't they have to burn them anymore
[44:06] because they change the
[44:09] text they get the same
[44:12] results by changing the versions on most
[44:17] Bible committees uh this is what I've
[44:20] what I've I've listened to other
[44:21] speakers say um there is generally a
[44:24] Jesuit on each Council some of these
[44:27] Bible societies have been bought by
[44:29] Catholicism by the Catholic Church
[44:31] they've actually bought it so they are
[44:33] controlling the spreading of the new
[44:37] versions so uh very alarming excellent
[44:40] point there brother if Satan realized he
[44:43] couldn't get Bibles out of people's
[44:45] hands you know Satan realized after all
[44:47] these years well they'll always want a
[44:49] Bible he knew the next best thing is to
[44:51] change their Bible or pervert their
[44:53] Bible yes yeah now Manley Hall Paul uh
[44:57] I'd love to read this quotation he he
[44:59] wrote about the New World Order and uh
[45:02] and this is 1944 he's a 33rd degree
[45:04] Mason but uh he writes this quotation
[45:08] this this is phenomenal he said to make
[45:11] things right we will have to undo much
[45:15] of the cherished error the problem of
[45:18] revising the Bible shows how difficult
[45:21] it is to do this for the last hundred
[45:26] years
[45:27] from
[45:28] 1944 uh we've been trying to get out an
[45:32] addition of the Bible that is reasonably
[45:35] correct but nobody wants it what's
[45:39] wanted is the good old King James
[45:41] version every jot and TI of it because
[45:45] most people are convinced that God
[45:46] dictated the Bible to King James in
[45:51] English so Manley Hall admits of his
[45:56] knowledge
[45:57] that from
[45:59] 1844 they were deliberately trying to
[46:03] destroy the influence of the King James
[46:07] Bible so sometimes they hide the
[46:09] evidence right out in the open but since
[46:13] most people are you know they might
[46:14] might not be wanting to read they might
[46:16] be illiterate you know they can just say
[46:18] these things openly and and no one
[46:20] checks them no no one's looking and uh
[46:23] here it is they've been telling us their
[46:25] whole plan the whole time and there's
[46:27] many like statements brother that they
[46:29] they say this so part of the move from
[46:32] lyola um you know they were they were
[46:35] saying that they had to destroy the
[46:37] serpent called the Bible so there's a
[46:39] quotation from uh the Jesuits in history
[46:42] from
[46:43] 1997 and it states it says uh and this
[46:46] is from I believe this is from Yola Lo
[46:49] Yola excuse me uh and it says then the
[46:53] Bible that serpent which with head erect
[46:57] and eyes flashing threatens us with its
[47:01] venom while it trails along the ground
[47:05] shall be changed into a rod as soon as
[47:09] we are able to seize it for three
[47:12] centuries past this cruel ASP has left
[47:16] us no Repose you well know with what
[47:19] folds it entwines us and with what fangs
[47:22] it gnaws us so even Catholicism some of
[47:26] their head guys admittingly were telling
[47:30] of the damage that the Bible did to its
[47:35] control over the world so you can see
[47:38] that a Counter Reformation they said
[47:41] they wanted to seize it they said they
[47:44] wanted to change it from from a snake to
[47:47] A rod which we understand that the Bible
[47:50] is no snake the Bible is the in
[47:51] infallible word of God but to a mindset
[47:54] is that that shows right now that they
[47:57] are absolutely
[47:59] Antichrist as their regards to the
[48:01] written infallable word of God yeah
[48:04] brother cim that's a powerful point the
[48:06] Catholic Church recognized the power of
[48:09] the King James version and one of my
[48:12] points that I use to say why I'm a King
[48:15] James version only preacher is that
[48:18] Mighty Men of God use the King James
[48:20] version such as Charles Spurgeon
[48:23] Jonathan Edwards George Whitfield and of
[48:26] course William brandom a prophet of God
[48:28] and other men that were yielded to the
[48:30] Holy Spirit and able to bring forth the
[48:32] pure word of God from the King James
[48:34] version and no wonder these Catholic
[48:36] leaders were so afraid of the King James
[48:39] version because it would produce a
[48:41] genuine Christian experience it produced
[48:43] the baptism of the Holy
[48:45] Ghost right so
[48:48] historically every modern Revival came
[48:53] from the King James version
[48:57] uh Jonathan Edwards had a powerful
[49:01] Revival John Wesley Church age messenger
[49:05] had a incredibly powerful Revival George
[49:10] Whitfield uh powerful Revival um move on
[49:15] you have William
[49:17] Seymour you have Eric Roberts of the
[49:19] Welsh Revival you have early on Oral
[49:23] Roberts um from what I've seen uh Billy
[49:26] Graham
[49:27] uh and and brother brandom all these
[49:29] individuals uh you know the people they
[49:32] clung to that King James version and uh
[49:35] we see that it literally has caused
[49:37] every single major
[49:40] Revival I would say this our Prophet
[49:43] told us that we'll have a bride's
[49:46] Revival how are we going to get a
[49:48] Revival if we move away from the King
[49:51] James Bible when it and it alone is the
[49:55] only and follow
[49:57] source to produce the manifestation of
[50:00] the power of God on the children of God
[50:04] Amen and brother that brings to mind the
[50:05] quotes from Brother brandham you know
[50:07] how are we going to have a Revival if
[50:08] you change even one word just like the
[50:10] serpent changed one word and I'll take
[50:12] it even further even if you change one
[50:14] or two doctrines how can you have the
[50:16] true bride Revival and so that's an
[50:19] amazing point you brought out about all
[50:20] these men even William Seymour brother
[50:22] Bram said the zza Street Revival was the
[50:24] greatest Revival since the day of
[50:26] Pentecost brother R said that that's
[50:28] just the same kind of a thing that
[50:30] happened to our Pentecostal followers
[50:33] over 40 years
[50:35] ago God called
[50:38] out a man in
[50:41] California one crossed eye give him the
[50:45] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[50:48] Ghost from there form to zeusa Street
[50:51] the old isusa Street Mission from there
[50:55] scattered to have swept the whole nation
[50:58] from Nation went to Nation after Nation
[51:01] until Pentecostal Revival was burning
[51:04] everywhere
[51:05] hallelujah what a
[51:07] [Music]
[51:09] blessing God had provided by
[51:12] Grace I don't care when it was there's
[51:16] never been a Revival like the
[51:18] Pentecostal
[51:19] Revival
[51:21] Right Wesley never had it none of them
[51:24] had it spurge and Calvin Knox great
[51:28] reformers but they never had the Revival
[51:30] like the Pentecostal Revival the
[51:33] greatest thing that struck the Earth
[51:34] since the Holy Ghost fell on the day of
[51:37] Pentecost so that's an amazing point
[51:40] that you made there by the grace of God
[51:41] that we got to have the pure word of God
[51:43] the pure word of God will produce the
[51:45] Revival yeah uh God's word cannot fail
[51:49] it absolutely cannot will not never will
[51:53] let us down you know the Bible said
[51:57] he'll never leave us nor forsake us uh
[51:59] and and that is
[52:00] factual and this message which was what
[52:04] it was the Gathering of all the
[52:08] revelations that were true brother Bram
[52:09] didn't come up everything new but he he
[52:12] he picked up all the Loose Ends um you
[52:15] know you know John Wesley had some
[52:16] things William Seymour had some things
[52:18] he put all these things together um and
[52:22] brought
[52:23] forth exactly from the King King James
[52:27] Bible the truth that we were to receive
[52:29] in this hour such a beautiful point
[52:31] there yeah brother Brandon was called to
[52:32] finish the mystery of God Revelation
[52:34] 10:7 restore all things uh Matthew 17:11
[52:38] turn the hearts of the children back to
[52:41] the Pentecostal fathers Revelation
[52:43] Malachi 45 and6 and so this was part of
[52:46] it yeah brother Braham brought some new
[52:49] things as we've said but not a whole lot
[52:51] uh we know the revelation of the Seven
[52:53] Seals was new uh there's other new
[52:55] things he brought out but a lot of it
[52:57] was restoration restoring what had
[52:59] already been given by God the beginning
[53:02] of the church ages through St Paul and
[53:05] St John and St Peter St James all the
[53:07] writers of the New Testament and brother
[53:09] Ram's uh main Ministry was to restore
[53:11] all things restore our hearts back to
[53:14] the apostolic fathers and of course for
[53:16] that to happen we need the pure word of
[53:18] God the King James version to do that
[53:20] yeah so so literally what what you see
[53:23] is um you know God would raise a prophet
[53:25] up to bring the word but you know who is
[53:28] the great compiler of that Jesus Christ
[53:31] when Jesus Christ came out he brought
[53:34] the Revelation that put it all together
[53:38] he showed the fulfilling he showed uh
[53:41] what the doctrine was that's why you can
[53:42] see Jesus talks about serpent seat uh
[53:45] Jesus talks about all these things and
[53:48] and then you watch that as time so God's
[53:51] move is always he allows Satan to of
[53:55] course get in there with organizational
[53:57] Spirits uh it's it's what it's always
[53:59] been unfortunately it's happened in the
[54:01] message even nowadays but organizational
[54:04] spirits come in and they dull the people
[54:06] from the truth and makes them go to
[54:08] other heirs well what God was doing you
[54:11] know therefore you know just like Jesus
[54:12] they were twisting the word in laws and
[54:15] and uh uh Traditions that weren't even
[54:17] in in the Bible God's inspired word
[54:20] never said it uh but yet Jesus Christ
[54:23] could come out and then the apostles
[54:25] following and and and Paul concluding as
[54:28] a first church age messenger and bring
[54:30] out the totality of what is truth then
[54:33] of course over seven Church ages it
[54:35] would be lost again but then brought in
[54:37] our day right now you know brother
[54:39] brandham he would actually compile once
[54:42] again what was right amongst all the
[54:45] erors that were sewed in by the devil
[54:48] through organizational principles and
[54:50] and the human mind so he would bring us
[54:52] to that and we would have to say okay
[54:56] what is it uh you know that's why that's
[54:58] why when you look at the message there's
[54:59] so many different doctrines now well
[55:01] what's right so most people will run
[55:04] from a quote but they never take it into
[55:06] the word of God if you take it back to
[55:09] the word of God you will find that it is
[55:12] a simple moving source that shows what
[55:18] the prophet told us that was right
[55:19] brother Brandon was like a man he was
[55:21] just like me and you we don't need to
[55:23] canonize the the 1200 sermons of the
[55:25] message he was a
[55:27] man just like we can't canonize our own
[55:29] sermons uh no one can canonize their own
[55:32] words because there's only one that
[55:34] spoke in Perfection his name was the
[55:36] Lord Jesus Christ he's our savior Our
[55:39] God and uh there will be no other
[55:41] Foundation but that's what the prophet
[55:43] did uh is he established with the King
[55:46] James Bible what was right yeah you made
[55:50] some excellent points there brother one
[55:52] point I want to emphasize is that
[55:54] brother brandom said every generation
[55:56] has a chance of the word of God and we
[55:58] and we saw that in the Book of Judges
[56:00] right where another generation rose up
[56:02] that didn't know the Lord and so in each
[56:04] generation they have to earnestly
[56:06] contend for the faith that was once
[56:08] delivered to the Saints and uh you
[56:10] brought out a great point you know God
[56:12] will allow Satan to inject these false
[56:14] Bibles into society because God has to
[56:16] give people what they want right uh
[56:19] Romans 1:28 God gave them over to a
[56:21] reprobate mind uh because they did not
[56:24] want to retain God in in their minds so
[56:27] people that don't want to retain the
[56:29] pure Doctrine or the true word of God
[56:32] the pure refined words of God God sees
[56:35] that in their hearts just like balum and
[56:37] so because balum didn't want to do the
[56:38] perfect will of God God gives him the
[56:41] permissive will of God so we're seeing
[56:42] that's why God has allowed all this time
[56:45] to go forth because he's got to give
[56:47] them what they want and every seed will
[56:49] bring forth of its own kind thank God we
[56:51] have the seed of God in our souls the
[56:53] Bible said we're born again of The
[56:55] Incorruptible word uh The Incorruptible
[56:58] seed the word of God so that's what we
[57:00] want since we're born again of God's
[57:02] seed that's what we want just God's word
[57:05] and that word is only found in the King
[57:07] James version Bible amen very well said
[57:15] brother and a genuine Faith Of God will
[57:18] believe in God and God is the word it'll
[57:21] never add nothing to it the Bible tells
[57:24] us if we add one word or take one word
[57:26] away our part will be taken from The
[57:28] Book of Life Revelations 22:18 the last
[57:32] closing chapter I stand before him I
[57:34] want to be found innocent I've ever
[57:36] trying to add one thing to that word or
[57:39] take
[57:39] one just exactly the way it is teaching
[57:43] people toore right up to it the Bible
[57:46] says this I can't help what anyone else
[57:48] says I got to stay right with that and
[57:51] here was those people standing around
[57:52] like that when I said will Paul have to
[57:55] be judged for the gospel he preached
[57:57] said yes I said I preached every word
[58:00] just exactly the way he did and the
[58:03] millions screamed out we are resting on
[58:06] that that's where I want it to be on the
[58:08] cross there I want to be that way just
[58:11] like that just what Paul said I don't
[58:13] want to add one thing to it take one
[58:15] thing away from it just what the Bible
[58:16] said that's just way I want to keep it
[58:18] going see and of course you keep it like
[58:21] that you've got to have somewhere that
[58:24] faith can take its resting
[58:28] place and to me I don't know how you
[58:31] feel about it but to me the Bible is the
[58:36] infallible word of
[58:39] God and I believe that God has watched
[58:41] over his
[58:43] word that there's not one punctuation
[58:46] out of
[58:52] place and so we want to thank our
[58:54] listeners thank you for your download
[58:56] thank you for uh sharing these podcasts
[58:58] and videos so we look forward to our
