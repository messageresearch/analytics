[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:13] this video is to overview my upcoming
[0:15] video series that will discern by the
[0:18] Bible seven false teachings of the tape
[0:22] church movement whose headquarters is in
[0:24] Jeffersonville Indiana USA I'll start
[0:28] with some important background
[0:29] information as a pastor I've been deeply
[0:32] concerned about the Jeffersonville false
[0:35] doctrine for over 15 years
[0:37] but in the past four or five years it's
[0:40] really increased I have reached out to
[0:42] multiple people in Jeffersonville to
[0:45] have kind brother Lee conversation about
[0:47] these subjects sharing quotes and
[0:50] scriptures through email and also
[0:52] sharing an 18-minute private YouTube
[0:55] video with brother branham's two sons
[0:58] but up to this time it seems no one
[1:01] wants to discuss my concerns about the
[1:04] Jeffersonville teachings I hope to soon
[1:07] hear back from my friends in
[1:09] Jeffersonville so we can have these
[1:11] important discussions in brotherly love
[1:15] please know these videos are made with
[1:18] brotherly kindness and respect in hopes
[1:21] that they will help those in
[1:22] Jeffersonville and anyone influenced by
[1:25] them to return from error to the truth
[1:28] and will also help those unsure about
[1:31] the teachings of the tape church
[1:33] movement to rest only on the Word of God
[1:36] no doubt there are many sweet sincere
[1:40] people in the tape church movement I
[1:42] want everyone to feel my brolly kindness
[1:45] in this video series also I believe
[1:49] William Branham was a genuine prophet of
[1:51] God whose ministry God used to fulfill
[1:54] revelation 10 7 Malachi 4 5 and 6 and
[1:58] Luke 17 30 I believe he is the final and
[2:02] seventh angel or church age messenger of
[2:05] revelation 3:14 I give brother Branham
[2:08] respect and honor as scripture commands
[2:11] that we should give to all prophets and
[2:13] even all Christians according to first
[2:16] Timothy 5:17
[2:19] and first Peter 2:17
[2:22] but I do not exalt or worship brother
[2:25] branham this video series then seeks to
[2:29] magnify Jesus Christ above brother
[2:32] Branham and every other man or woman
[2:34] only Christ deserves our praise and
[2:37] highest honor summary of jeffersonville
[2:42] teachings here are seven false doctrines
[2:45] of the tape church movement the Bible
[2:47] proves these teachings from its
[2:49] leadership are sincerely wrong be
[2:52] assured that I've saved audio recordings
[2:54] of all these false teachings number one
[2:58] it's wrong to say every word the late
[3:00] William Branham said was thus saith the
[3:03] Lord Jeffersonville leadership teaches
[3:07] quote I believe everything brother
[3:10] Branham says is thus saith the Lord I
[3:12] believe everything the Prophet says that
[3:15] it is the truth of God to me and you
[3:17] whether we want to accept it or not end
[3:20] quote
[3:22] the tape church movement believes every
[3:25] word brother Branham said was thus saith
[3:27] the Lord which is a form of idolatry
[3:29] because it makes brother Branham
[3:31] infallible no prophet including Moses
[3:35] Isaiah and Ezekiel spoke every word with
[3:38] thus saith the Lord it's true though
[3:42] that a genuine prophet is infallible
[3:44] when he says thus saith the LORD which
[3:47] is one of the qualifications for a
[3:50] genuine prophet he must foretell
[3:52] something and it must come to pass
[3:54] brother Branham meets this requirement
[3:56] please see this video called three
[3:59] prophecies of William Branham
[4:03] second it's wrong to say william branham
[4:06] and his tape recordings are the absolute
[4:10] Jeffersonville leadership teaches quote
[4:13] I believe everything brother branham
[4:16] says is thus saith the Lord this message
[4:19] has to be my absolute I believe
[4:22] everything the Prophet says that it is
[4:24] the truth of God to me and you whether
[4:27] we want to accept it or not end quote
[4:31] this is a form of idolatry as well
[4:34] because God's absolute is his word the
[4:37] Bible because heaven and earth shall
[4:39] pass away but Jesus's words shall never
[4:42] pass away
[4:45] third it's wrong to teach others to have
[4:48] blind faith in and unquestionably
[4:51] believe every word William Branham said
[4:54] Jeffersonville leadership teaches quote
[4:56] we don't care what says on them tapes we
[5:01] believe it I don't have to explain it I
[5:04] don't have to understand it I just have
[5:07] to believe it you don't know what the
[5:09] truth is unless you listen to the tapes
[5:11] end quote
[5:15] again this is a form of idolatry because
[5:18] the Bible commands us to prove all
[5:20] things try every spirit and search the
[5:23] Scriptures daily to decide the truth
[5:25] about what is being preached forth it's
[5:30] wrong to say the token or baptism of the
[5:33] Holy Ghost is two things it is not it is
[5:36] not the audio recordings of William
[5:38] Branham and second it's not the state of
[5:42] being a tape Church Jeffersonville
[5:45] leadership teaches quote they preachers
[5:49] got to catch the vision you got to play
[5:53] the tapes you've got to amen
[5:56] they're the token and quote she Rahab
[6:02] had to show her token she said I am a
[6:05] tape Church that's the token I'd say
[6:08] it's real important to say that we are a
[6:10] tape Church end quote
[6:14] this is limiting God by making a
[6:16] tradition of men or man-made Creed the
[6:21] evidence of being born again is not
[6:22] owning a collection of audio mp3 files
[6:25] nor is it a habit of playing those audio
[6:28] files at your physical church gathering
[6:31] location Jesus says the evidence of the
[6:34] Holy Ghost baptism is being taught and
[6:37] guided into all truth by the Holy Ghost
[6:39] according to John 14:26
[6:44] in John 16:13
[6:49] fifth it's wrong to declare William
[6:52] branham's youngest son as a prophet even
[6:55] if his father hoped he would be a
[6:57] prophet without any proof of him
[7:00] fulfilling the Bible's requirements for
[7:03] a genuine prophet this is the sin of
[7:07] pride exalting a man brother randoms
[7:10] youngest son to a position to which
[7:12] there is no proof of his being qualified
[7:14] for the Bible says proof of being a
[7:17] prophet is accurately foretelling the
[7:20] future according Deuteronomy 18 22 and
[7:23] revealing God's secrets according to
[7:26] Amos 3:7
[7:28] I've asked two close friends of brother
[7:32] branham's youngest son for any evidence
[7:34] of the son being a prophet and the only
[7:37] proof I was given was that he discerned
[7:39] a person's sinful actions discernment is
[7:44] indeed one of the nine gifts of the
[7:46] spirit but not the Bible proof of being
[7:48] a prophet from Deuteronomy 18:20 2 and
[7:51] Amos 3:7 perhaps if brother branham's
[7:55] youngest son foretells a future event
[7:57] and speaks it with us saith the Lord and
[8:00] he will begin to be considered as being
[8:02] a genuine prophet but until then he
[8:05] cannot be emphatically declared as a
[8:07] prophet
[8:10] sixth it's wrong to make a tape Church
[8:13] mandate meaning every Church should play
[8:16] the audio recordings of William Branham
[8:18] instead of having their pastor or
[8:21] evangelist or teachers preach because it
[8:25] deletes three folds of the fivefold
[8:27] ministry and we are not to take away one
[8:30] word of God
[8:32] Jeffersonville leadership teaches quote
[8:35] every Church in this message if you
[8:37] claim to believe this message one two or
[8:41] not your a tape Church if you believe
[8:44] this message
[8:45] you're a tape Church it's just the way
[8:47] it is there's men of God that have true
[8:50] callings of God on their lives they
[8:53] preach this message with all their heart
[8:55] but they got to catch the vision you got
[8:58] to play the tapes you've got to Amen
[9:02] they're the token and quote this is
[9:07] again the sin of pride as it exalts
[9:10] man's thinking above God's Word the
[9:12] Bible mandate for churches is for living
[9:15] men to preach God's Living Word
[9:17] commissioned by Jesus Christ himself in
[9:20] Matthew 28:19 and twenty mark 16:15
[9:24] and Ephesians four verses 7 to 16
[9:29] seventh it's wrong to redefine the
[9:32] fivefold ministry because it adds to and
[9:35] takes away from the Word of God
[9:38] Jeffersonville leadership teaches quote
[9:41] the correct way for the fivefold his or
[9:45] Joshua's messengers Tait boys were what
[9:49] the fivefold ministry that fivefold
[9:52] ministry went in they're being told what
[9:55] to do so that's the fivefold ministry
[9:57] what did the true fivefold ministry
[10:00] preach then they played her Rahab a tape
[10:05] that's what the fivefold ministry's
[10:07] supposed to do end quote
[10:12] the tape church movement adds tape boys
[10:15] men who try to start new churches by
[10:17] playing audio sermons of William Branham
[10:19] but they themselves do not preach into
[10:23] the fivefold ministry which replaces or
[10:26] deletes or even redefines pastors
[10:29] evangelists teachers and apostles who
[10:33] preach the gospel of Jesus Christ in
[10:36] closing I hope you'll view this video
[10:40] series in its entirety so that you can
[10:42] know the truth and hopefully help
[10:45] someone else to believe the truth about
[10:47] the Ministry of God's profit brother
[10:50] Branham again brother Branham is a
[10:53] definite genuine prophet of God and I
[10:57] believe that with all my heart if you
[10:59] have any questions or concerns or
[11:01] testimonies about this video please
[11:04] contact me god bless you and make Jesus
[11:09] Christ be the desire of your heart
