TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Brother Brandon, we have no preacher where we live. Brother Brandham, we have no preacher where we live, but we have tape service on Sunday night only. If you don't have a church to go to, should you just listen to the tapes? Yes, that's I' that'd be fine. Now to bring up this faith in Christ, there's ministers. That's the most important thing of the day is a good God-scent preacher. I admire them. And their gift is far beyond anything could be done in anything else is a preacher. A man who knows how to rightly divide the word of God. that he said IN REVELATIONS THE 22ND CHAPTER, WHOSOEVER SHALL TAKE ONE WORD OUT OF THIS book or ADD ONE WORD TO IT, his his part will be taken out of the book of life. We are not to TAKE AWAY FROM THE Bible or add to it. Just say what it says. Greetings, friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a few viewers questions about my convictions on the tapes. Should tapes be played in actual church services? But we'll start with the first question regarding a video I put out called no tapes no token. It was an excellent question. So we'll start with that one. By the grace of God. But first friends, I want to thank the Lord Jesus Christ for his grace and mercy for saving my soul. I'm sure you feel the same way. The greatest miracle is a soul that is saved. A sinner becoming a saint. a sinner's filthy garments being washed white by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, going from a heart of stone to heart of flesh. We praise the Lord God for sending the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, giving us the good news of salvation and the beautiful revelation that not only does he save us, he sanctifies us, which is the second work of grace. Salvation is the first work of grace. Justification is another term for that. He saves us, sanctifies us. And the third work of grace is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Christ in you, the hope of glory as Paul said in Colossians 1. So we first thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ and the filling of the Holy Ghost in the believer's soul. So the first question was about what I thought about paragraph 299 in the token message from September 1st, 1963 on that one video called No Tapes, No Token. I said I agreed with the quote. And so this wonderful person asked a question. Let's look at the quote. It said, "But there must have been some tape boys slipped in somewhere for the predestinated seed. They slipped over to her house and played some tapes. She made her her own house a church to receive the message." End quote. Now friends, as I said, I agree with that quote if it's taken in the context. To understand the context, I would suggest watching the video that I made called tape boys are not the true five-fold ministry. Here's the thumbnail to that so you can get a visual of that. I'll leave a link to that in the description. Friends, Brandon Tabernacle says, "The true five-fold ministry just presses play and do not preach." That is an awful false doctrine. So, what they're implying is that the true five-fold ministry plays tapes. That would mean the false five ministry preaches. That's what they're implying. And they said only the royal seat of Abraham will play tapes, press play and obey and believe every word on tape. That's idolatry. That's heresy. So that's what they say. They say tape boys are the true five-fold ministry or the correct way for the five-fold ministry to operate. That's a false doctrine. You'll never find that in the Bible. That's a man-made creed or dogma as Jesus said in Matthew 15:9. And that's vain worship according to the Lord Jesus Christ. So in that video called tape boys are not the true five-fold ministry I start by showing the biblical foundation for preachers. Ephesians 4 7-16 Romans 10:14 and 15 Mark 16:15 Matthew 28 19 and 20 Jesus only ordained living men who were still in their corporal physical body to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Ephesians 4 gives five purposes for the five-fold ministry. For the perfecting of the saints, that's the equipping, the work of the ministry, which is the undertaking of the ministry. The edifying of the body of Christ, that's promoting growth, the unity of the faith, which is the agreement of faith and beliefs, and the unity on the knowledge of the son of God, the unity of knowledge or precise truth that only comes through living preachers according to the Bible. And remember, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. A lot of these tape boys miss the keystone of the Bible. Brother Brandham said that God is unchanging and so are his ways. So God's not going to change the five-fold ministry. God's not going to change his word. So we know God's program will always be to have living preachers. Now here's the beautiful quotes from that video. Brother Random says tapes are a secondarily way or they're a secondary ministry. Brother Ram talks about people who take his tapes and people are getting saved and healed, which is wonderful. He said, "Maybe they're not preachers, but they're trying to get the message to the people. God can use these things in a secondarily way like this." End quote. So, tape playing is not a primary way to preach the gospel. It's a secondary way, preaching the gospel. It's the highest form of getting the word of God to the people according to brother Brandham. And of course the Bible because the Bible had it first and brother Brandham got the revelation of it and then shared it with us. He said this in what is a vision 1956 quote that's the highest form. Preaching the gospel is the highest form. Then if you notice the Bible places it that way and he quotes Ephesians 4:11. So why don't the tape boys address these quotes? Why don't they use these quotes? Because it doesn't fit their man-made creed and dogma there. It doesn't fit their denominational creed. Remember friends, they got a deity spirit that doesn't want to obey the word of God. It's in rebellion against the plain written word of God. So that's why we pray for them. Pray for their repentance and so forth. Brother Random also says, quote, "We got a tape business around the world." End quote. In 1963, so the tape ministry was a secondary ministry. It was a business. He calls it a society. Quote, "We send them tapes free on a society, the church." End quote. So, the tapes were never to take the place of the five-fold ministry. And Brother Bram loved preachers. Brother Bam loved listening to preachers. He said, quote, in 1957, "I tell you the reason I love to hear Brother Neville speak. Not mainly because he's a good preacher, but because I know that he lives what he preaches." End quote. Friends, Brother Brandham never told Brother Neville to sit down and just press play. When brother Brandon was here, he believed in living preachers because that's what the Bible teaches. I found a quote recently that I'll make a separate video about from 1959 where brother Brandham actually says he follows the other preachers. And if that's thus sayith the Lord, what will the tape boy say about that? Brother Brandham said, "So I just listen to what they say and say amen and go on because they're men of God. I follow them. I find there in the Bible and tell the truth. Why didn't brother Ram tell all these ministers to sit down and press play? Why would Brother Ram say amen to living preachers if everybody's supposed to just press play? So, we can see it in every act of Brother Ram's life. He supported the five-fold ministry. He would sit down and say amen to Brother Neville, these other preachers out in San Jose, California, because that's the Bible foundation. That's the apostolic form. That's the apostolic pattern. And remember Abraham said, "Thus sayeth the Lord, the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride." On the day of Pentecost, friends, was there any form of the apostles, the Holy Ghost fil saints pressing, play, and obey? I know there was not the technology to press, play, and play tapes and so forth. But was there any equivalent? Did the preacher just sit down and someone read straight from the Old Testament? No. They were filled with the Holy Ghost. And while yet Peter spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on them that believed. So I'm combining Acts 2, Acts 8, Acts 10. The Holy Ghost came through living preachers, not by silencing or limiting preachers. So that's quite a foundation to get to this first question. I didn't really plan to do all that, but the first question is, how do you agree with paragraph 299? I agree with it because if you look at the story of Rahab, brother Brandon makes it seem like the two spies were like tape boys in a secondary way to go in and get the elect. But where was the ark of God? Where was the word of God? Where was the prophet of God? It was Joshua. And he was with the priests and with the ark, the presence of God. So in the type, Rahab is the last few believers that get saved before destruction. But the five-fold ministry we'd say or the ministry of that day was with Joshua the prophet and the priesthood, the Levites who had the presence of God. So the primary ministry of that day was Joshua the prophet and the Levitical priesthood who had the presence of God, the ark of God, thus sayeth the Lord. And then there was a secondary ministry that went down into Jericho to minister and save the final few souls before destruction hit. So that's why I agree with that quote. And then remember friends, the second time brother Brandon preached it in February of 64, he said he said somebody went in there or something. So it wasn't so he left it open. It could have been tape boys, could have been preachers and they played a tape or something another which means they could have played a tape. They could not have played a tape but the Ram was just using it as a hypothetical situation a type somehow there was a secondary ministry outside of the primary ministry that saved some souls. So that's why I agree with paragraph 299 by God's grace from the token message. I hope that's helpful. And again, remember Tabernacle is majoring on a minor. They're taking one paragraph, which is three sentence long, and they're completely changing the Bible. They're completely denying all these other quotes from Brother Brandom where he supports the five-fold ministry. They're in an awful spiritual condition. And if they don't repent, there's got to be some severe repercussions for taking away all those Bible scriptures about the five-fold ministry. They're taking away from the word of God. All right. Now, let's get to the second question here. by God's grace. I want to say first that I could appreciate the sincerity and the kindness of this question here online. The person's username on YouTube has David in it. So perhaps it's a brother. It says, "Dear brother Smith, it's my impression that Brother Joseph wants to make it clear that it is important for believers to hear the message from God through Brother Random for themselves, listening to exactly what Brother Ram says, not just listening to preachers who rephrase what he has already said on the tapes. I don't remember ever reading or hearing Brother Joseph say it wasn't okay for any church to have both live preaching and tape playing." Okay, so there's a lot in here, but let's try to break it down here. So, the first kind of criticism here is that preachers rephrase what's already been said on tapes. But you have to remember down through the 2,000 years of church history, preachers have always done that. They've tried their best to quote the word of God first and then other gifts of God. But remember, the word of God is the absolute. Not one word can be added or taken away from the word of God. And friends, any true Holy Ghost fil man of God is not trying to rephrase what's on tape or rephrase what's in the Bible. They're just trying to say what the Bible says. So here it looks like this commenter, of course, is probably upset with preachers who have given false doctrine, which I'm upset with that, too. I hate that, too. I pray for those people to repent, those preachers who preach false doctrine. But remember, for 2,000 years, the Holy Ghost has guided the church into all truth. The Holy Ghost has revealed his word to the seven church age messengers, and then all those that hear the voice of the messenger echo the same message. It's the word of God. So real preachers are not trying to rephrase something. They're just trying to preach the same thing. And then secondly, this person doesn't remember brother Joseph saying it wasn't okay to have both living or live preachers or tape playing. Well, I got numerous videos on this. Our precious brother Joseph said preachers got to catch the vision. They've got to play the tapes. That's a mandate. That's a denominational mandate where they've got to do it. Or else he calls them deeis or makeelbelievers. Well, how can it be okay to be a deemist or make believer? So that's what I said in my previous video. The pastor brom tabernacle is taking both sides. You can't take both sides. It's okay to preach, but no, they got to catch the vision. They got to play the tapes or else you're a deus and a makebeliever. That's what the pastor said. That's not what I said. So this person probably hasn't heard the exact quotes of Joseph Brandom. So I'll leave links to those in the description. There's over 24 plus lies coming out of Brandom Tabernacle and they failed to address any of them. So that shows something's wrong with them if they won't address their false doctrines and their false statements. Okay. Second paragraph. Do you think it's fine to have live preaching by a pastor or assistant pastor and also have the tapes played in the church as well? That seems like the best and overall most sensible and sane way to go about it. Many churches do that. that they have both regular preaching by the current local pastor and some services are tape services. The Brandom Tabernacle often did that. When Brother Collins was pastor, they often played a tape on Wednesday evenings. Sometimes brother Collins preached the message on Sunday morning. Sometimes a tape often a longer tape would be played on Sunday. Wednesday nights were frequently saved for shorter out of town tapes such as some from other cities away from Jeff with healing lines and lots of discernment. Okay, so the question was, do I think it's fine to have living preachers and play tapes? That's up to the local pastor. Now, for me, I don't believe that's the right way to do it, cuz that's not how Brother Brandham did it. And that's not how the Holy Ghost fil saints have done it throughout the 2,000 years of church history of preachers filled with the Holy Ghost. But let's focus on Brother Brandham's day. Brother Brandham never had Brother Neville press, play, and obey. So that's why I do not think it's fine to do that. Now if a pastor wants to take some time and play a tape in separate services, then that would be fine. But the model that brother left us was for living preachers to always preach the living word. It was to never sit down the preachers and just press play. I'll just say this, friends. Anyone I know that has the baptism of the Holy Ghost loves to listen to Brother Brandham in their free time when they're away from church is what I'm talking about. If people need to go to church and listen to brother Brandham, they're not born again. Brother Brandham said, "If you've got the Holy Ghost, it can only feed on the word of God." So that means you read your Bible, you pray, you listen to Brother Brandham, you read the church age book, or you read the seven seal book, you are staying in the word of God. If you've got it, go to church to hear brother Brandham, you're probably not born again. Now, the next point on this was Brother Collins. Well, Brother Collins didn't do the same thing brother Neville did. So I think that's where a lot of the problems started with Brandham Tabernacle once brother Neville left and you started getting this hybrid type of ministry of sometimes playing tapes, sometimes preaching. That's not what brother Brandham did. That's not what St. Paul did. That's not what any true Holy Ghost fililled preacher down through the years did. It's only been an issue or hybrid form of worship since Brother Collins took over. And God rest his soul, I don't know his salvation. I don't know anything about him really. But if he changed what brother Neville did who was obeying what brother Brandham said, then there's a problem with that. The next paragraph says, "A variety of both the current pastor and tape services seems the way to go." Brother Brandham said, "The best way is the middle of the road. Not going off on a tangent to the far right or to the left. That seems like the very best way to do it." Okay, so this is misapplying a quote, friends. This person, bless their heart, they're applying the middle of the road quote to tape playing in a church service, which Brother Brandham never did. When Brother Brandham talked about the middle of the road, I just put out a video about it recently, the middle of the road. He was talking about being in the middle road between emotion and intellectualism. He wasn't talking about in the middle of the road between playing tapes and live preachers. In the Bible days and when brother Brandham was here with brother Neville, there was no middle of the road of well, we'll play tapes on Wednesday, we'll preach on Sunday. That it was all preaching. It was all living men preaching the living word because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. I just can't wrap my mind around these people that are trying to bring a hybrid gospel. Change Acts chapter 2. Change the book of Acts into somehow preaching sometime, tape playing another time. Friends, you're changing the gospel of Jesus Christ. You cannot do that. You cannot add one word. You cannot take one word away. Again, there's no Bible verse that says living preachers will sit down, the five-fold will sit down and press play at the end time, part-time or full-time. It's full-time preaching by men who are baptized with the Holy Ghost. That's the gospel pattern. And Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. The next paragraph says, "Brother Joseph seems to me anyway to be stressing that it is wrong for any pastor of a church to absolutely prohibit tapes from being played in the church. If a pastor prohibits tapes from being played the church, whether people want to admit it or not, is certainly comes across that the pastor, whether truly intentional or not, is trying to keep the people from listening directly to the prophet's words. Sort of like the idea of a spiritual leader in the times past to say to his congregation, "Do not read what Moses or Isaiah wrote. I will rephrase it and explain it to you what Moses really meant. So, I don't agree with this, brother. From everything I've heard from brother Joseph, I don't believe that's what he's saying. Remember, he said they've got to catch the vision. They've got to play the tapes. So, that was a denominational mandate from our dear brother Joseph. So, I think tapes would be good if there's no preacher available. For example, there's been a few times I was sick over the 19 years I've been pastor and there was no preachers. So, I asked the brethren to play a tape. So, I believe tape playing is for when there are no living preachers available. And that's what brother Brandham said twice in questions and answers 1964. There's only two times brother Ram said it was okay to play tapes and it was when there was no living preacher. And think about all the message preachers. I don't know if they're all faithful, but just to make the point, there are so many message preachers, living men of God, preaching the living word of God in the Jeffersonville area, and yet these people will sit at home, they'll disobey Hebrews 10 24 and 25 and not go to church, which Brother Bram never supported. Brother Ram said, "You can't be as good of a Christian if you sit home and don't physically go to church." He said, "The awfulst cults don't go to church and won't work." Then how can you SAY YOU CAN STAY HOME AND BE JUST AS GOOD a Christian as you would be a church? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't do it. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Read the word. The Holy Spirit feeds on the word. &gt;&gt; The Bible is God's spiritual diet &gt;&gt; for his church. And the Holy Spirit is the one who brings it to you &gt;&gt; and places it in the heart. and with thanksgiving you water. &gt;&gt; So, it's cult mentality to not go to church. It's cult mentality to not have living preachers. As a pastor, I tell the people, listen to the tapes at home. If not, you're going to get spiritually weak. You're going to get distracted. You're going to get your eyes on the things of the world. True Holy Ghost fil people will be in the word all the way. Like brother Ram said in the church age book, they will search the scriptures daily. As Acts 17:11 says, whether these things, brother Ram said, were so because that's what they did to St. Paul in the book of Acts. And we are getting the book of Acts restored. It's thus sayith the Lord. The fullness of the book of Acts will be in the bride. The next paragraph about the quote referring to Rahab, the harlot, and the tapes. I think I can skip that paragraph because there's no questions there. I agree there were no tapes in the days of Rahab. I explained that earlier. The next paragraph says, "Brother Brandham stressed so many times that he was carrying a message from the Lord. His message were thoughts of God concerning this end time and what needed to be understood by the elect that were being transmitted to the people through brother Brandham and they were being recorded for reason." So believers then in the times to come would recognize the voice and go back and listen for themselves to what God was trying to get across to those who were predestinated for eternal life. I agree with everything in there, but brother Ram said, "Go listen to them in the hotel or in the private the quietness of your home." Brother Ram never said, "Brother Neville, sit down and just press play." Remember the last time Brother Ram preached in Brandham Tabernacle, he felt led the Lord to have Brother Neville preach in the morning. He honored the five-fold ministry. Brother Ram sat down and said, "Amen." And Brother Neville preached a wonderful message. And then Brother Ram preached, I believe it was Satan's Eden in the evening if I'm not mistaken. So go look that up. Why don't the tape boys go look that up and see if that's right or not? It's right. The word of God is right. There's quotes where brother Ram says, "Pastors are higher offices than his office." There's quotes where brother Ram says, "He can't interpret the word of God. No man can interpret the word of God." So, tape boys ignore all these quotes. They're just trying to push their one agenda, their own false doctrine, their own pet doctrine that breaks the word of God because they're led by the wrong spirit. The spirit that denies the word. They're not preaching Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Brother Brandham never told people to sit down and press play and obey and silence living preachers because they'd be neglecting their gifts. And the last paragraph said, "Anyway, I think it is perfectly reasonable and good to hear the tapes for yourself in both churches and homes and listen to other preachers too if you desire." Now, pause right there. Yes, I believe it's okay to listen to other preachers who are filled with the Holy Ghost and listen to tapes in both your homes and church if there's no living preacher or if the living pastor wants to let the people hear a specific sermon. That's fine. But it should not be the regular pattern of the church because that's not the pattern of the book of Acts. It's living men filled with the living word of God. Look at Acts chapter 2. What did they do? They continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship. That means the apostles were preaching, teaching the word of God. Living men preaching the truth by the Holy Ghost to the new believers to feed their souls. tape boys are breaking the pattern of Acts chapter 2 and the entire book of Acts by just saying press play and obey. It's sin. It's heresy. It's a lie. It's false doctrine. It's idolatry. So true men of God who are filled with the Holy Ghost will believe Hebrews 13:8 in regards to the five-fold ministry and how brother Brandham modeled that throughout his ministry. He never told the preachers to sit down and just press play. Finishing the paragraph. Brother Jesse, are you yourself against the idea of permitting message believing churches to play Brother Ram's tapes in actual church services? I'm not sure if I understand. Thank you and God bless you. Yes, God bless you as well to this precious brother whoever wrote this. So yes, I am against message churches playing Brother Random's tapes in actual church services if they have living preachers because that's the pattern of the book of Acts. That's the pattern brother Brandham set forth through his entire ministry. I wish these tape boys would go listen to what house will you build me in 1965 November. Brother Ram says Perry Green church. He said this is my church. And he said I don't want to take up all the pastor's time speaking of Perry Green. He's a gifted brother. He can really preach the word of God. So brother Bam hurried with his dedication and ordained Perry Green. And then Brother Bam sat down and listened to a living man of God. Why don't the T boys ever talk about that? Why don't they look at that pattern? A month before brother Brandham passed away, he tries to hurry so he can sit down and hear a living man preach the living word of God, not press, play, and obey. And I just wish these tape boys would remember the quotes from Brother Brandham from 1964. Brother Ram said, "He's not the only one that should preach." So tape boys are going against that quote by having only brother Random preach. Brother Random said, "We need them." speaking of the preachers with a call of God to preach questions answers 64 part three and he said don't change a thing about the evangelical ministry questions answers on the seal 64 the Brandham tabernacle has no evangelists they only have tape boys who give out agapo tablets and say press play obey completely changed the evangelical ministry why don't they address that question why don't they address that topic because they have a false doctrine because they have a deity spirit that worships brother Brandham and the tapes So in closing, I just want to thank this precious brother for this humble question and of course the sister who asked the first question. Hope this is clear. I hope people know that brother Ram's goal was to give us a true relationship with Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. And the gospel of Jesus Christ cannot change. Brother Random did not change it. He came to restore it. Brother Ram's ministry was a restoration ministry of the book of Acts. And you don't have any equivalent to just sitting down preachers and just saying press play and obey. You don't have any equivalent of this false ministry of the current tape ministry in the book of Acts. True Holy Ghost-filled men of God will not change the five-fold ministry that started on the day of Pentecost 2,000 years ago. They can't because they have the Holy Ghost in them. They have the seal of the Holy Ghost and they won't add to the word or take away from the word. Tape boys have to delete so many Bible scriptures and delete so many quotes from brother Brandham in order to get to their radicalized unbiblical heretical teaching of just press play and obey. Friends, just keep praying for some of these people to repent and leave the idolatry of the tape church movement, the press play and obey movement. May God have mercy on them and we pray they'll come back to the word of God which is forever settled in heaven. And Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ [music] be the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. [music] The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He never failed.
