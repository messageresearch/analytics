made us accepted in the beloved praise the lord i'd like to look uh in first corinthians let's go to that's why we read uh 12-7 christmas twelve seven try to be mindful the time tonight looking forward to bang's testimony first corinthians 12 7. this morning we finished with uh little ministries we actually say little but they're important but we would say they're they're underneath the leadership of the church the apostle prophet and all the fivefold ministry then we look at the ministries under that providing relief and those types of ministries prayers and all these wonderful ministries thank god for them uh first corinthians 12 7 we'll read from there let's look at the gifts of the spirit it'll be a little bit of review today but hopefully you'll catch something by god's grace verse seven let's read that together uh on three one two three but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all praise god let's have a word of prayer we have a need on your heart let's make it known unto god as we approach this communion and fellowship here tonight heavenly father lord we've gathered before your throne lord god and as i looked over lord at the bread and the wine and remembering lord god what you did this is uh the ordinance you asked us to do lord and we're so glad that we can partake of it lord growing up those 18 years of denomination i had no idea what i was doing drinking grape juice and little bits of crackers lord i didn't i didn't know and lord you were patient with me now i know lord god i'm to remember your death in order to remember the holy spirit's life and the bread of the word the unleavened life and the life of the holy spirit now lord god i'm to partake of it daily until you come lord help me lord take up my cross tonight help each one of us to do the same lord god as we get into your word anoint me to preach in your people to receive lord and brother bang to give his testimony and especially pray for the young people lord that they can hear these these words lord god and lord it will guide them but it will be training to them to trust you all the days of their life so anoint us god in my divine presence in jesus christ's name the saint said amen god bless you being seated praise god um or lydia could you put up a just i got one just quote i want to share um i was listening brother tim pruitt preach and i started listening to him a lot more you know since donnie reagan got sick i listened to tim heard a lot how's danny reagan doing does anybody know anybody happen to know i haven't heard anything okay i knew brother daryl ward got better i don't know how brother donnie's doing i know they were praying really hard for him so i've been listening to tim fruit a lot lately he's been preaching some fantastic message i think i shared one with amen just some really good messages i really appreciate his gift um so here's one where he just brings out a simple quote about all the gifts are in the promised land now remember the story remember the spies brought fruit out of the land right uh to show to show beforehand before they entered in so that would be what we would refer to uh people that are not born again that still have access to the gifts right they can go into the land and bring out the gifts but they don't live in the land because their life proves they don't they don't have a possession they don't have uh the character of the land right they don't live there but we're supposed to have a permanent dwelling in the things of god amen day in day out week and week out of living in god's land praise god amen i'm possessing the land god has called me to possess right and so that's a beautiful thought brother man brings it out i'm going to skip down to verse where he talks about let's get down to here with joshua he started with a new generation a leadership with joshua who believed the word amen and he took them to the promised land oh god may this young generation of pentecostals get the vision and this is after the seals i don't think he's talking about denominational pentecostals he's talking about us holy ghost-filled saints praise god anyone who's got the holy ghost he's talking about and he says get the vision see they went on to the promised land we ought to be aware we have all kinds of the gifts of god we did speak with tongues that's that's fine that's that's right nothing against that uh moses crossed the red sea the enemy was killed behind him we we appreciate that that's still not all of it praise god so the point he's making we want to do we don't just want to partake of that little by little uh we want to live there praise god we want to be blessed with the gifts daily praise god and you'll see i try to make it i think each time we study it it gets more clear don't you think and i've searched sister wendy for years i've searched the internet can somebody give me the definitions of the fruits of the gifts of the spirit i've never found a good one that lines up with brother brown's message that's why i'm writing a book because there's no there's no place to go there's no place to go to get something where you have a good summary of everything brother brahms said about it and it's all lined up with the word you don't have any place to go there's nowhere to go so we want to do that we want to be a blessing and we want to uh do our part praise god now uh just let's start with that verse they're given to everyone to profit with all so gifts uh help others increase right a profit is an increase in the greek so when a gift operates someone's spiritual condition is increased praise god and remember you have the choice to let it uh to believe it or not to accept that increase or not right because the bible said because of unbelief jesus could not do many miracles there the gifts wanted to operate jesus wanted to bless them and increase their uh their love for god and and help them and heal them but unbelief kept it out so we got to have a heart of belief praise god let's have a heart of belief tonight by god's grace let me set a timer here so i'm cautious of everything uh so let's have open hearts praise god now i want to uh remind you that again gifts and callings of god are without repentance uh before you even repent your gifts are in you before birth um right after i started preaching i got an email from i think i told my wife this but an ex-girlfriend in high school before i started dating my wife uh she didn't live in our town she lived in another town and she just even emailed me out of the blue her name was janine and uh she's like what are you doing i'm like i'm preaching the gospel she's like i always knew you would be a preacher and i'm like how did you know i was going to be a preacher i wasn't a christian and she just said the way you carried yourself and i look back now and i want to bring that newspaper article one time it says jesse's gang rides again right you'll ride this trail again uh and you know even when we won the state championship they they were seniors up there but i was a junior they asked me to speak and i never felt like i was a good speaker and i wonder if that's part of it but i just thought wow that's interesting and then when the first time we went to sheffield sister kim browning brother samuel's wife she said she looked at me and said he's going to be a preacher someday and i had long hair and i just i wasn't i wasn't fit in the part really good you know i had my gym shoes on and you know i just i never didn't look the part but she knew uh and so that that that uh validates jeremiah 1 5 that god knew and placed the gifts in us before our birth and each of us have a purpose that we must fulfill praise god and i'll just say like this who would have thought that i would have been the first message preacher to stand up and debate believe the sign of all the message preachers and the brothers told me they asked many many preachers now i'm not i'm not saying i'm any i'm not nothing i'm just saying like i wouldn't think i would be the one there's so many there's brothers that knew brother branham that i would thought but nobody wanted to do a part of it and if they said they did then whatever it never worked out uh you know i would i would have never looked at my life you're in high school like oh i'm gonna i'm gonna try to defend the christian faith someday i'm gonna you know i just never would me no way but uh we know it's god will bring out whatever's in there if we allow it to come out we don't want to remember you can bury your gift in the ground we don't want to bury it and hide from it we want to use it for god's grace amen and that's what i want to be i want to be a you yield a vessel that god can operate his extraordinary because remember a gift is an extraordinary power in our lives to help his people praise god and that's what it is to help other people so in other words somebody needs your service somebody needs you because that's what a gift is for it's not for you right and so god help us to have that attitude lord show me who needs me today that i can help whether like it's through helps or whether it's through prayer for the sick uh whatever i can do lord show me how i can help because i am here because someone needs me right and the bible says you'll never have to force yourself into it proverbs 18 16 a man's gift makes room for him and bringeth him before great men think about brother graham standing next to richard nixon at that prayer breakfast my a seventh grade educated man right next to richard nixon my i just thank god my god is his word is so true praise god he can raise up the most humble the most little uh those that seem like they have no chance at all god specializes in raising them up praise god through a gift through a gift it's not even their power right uh but it's god's power and if we're faithful to god's power it will raise us up praise god so your gift has a god-ordained place to fit into your gifts will edify that word edify means build up let's can you pull out first corinthians 14 5 just to see the greatest gifts are ones that help the most people so i hope my preaching gifts as much as i try to study and pray and humble myself i hope all of you are being built up every time we gather i i just hope and pray i i do not want to build i would not want to tear you down i want to build you up by god's grace i know i've got we've all you know the holy spirit we know is a sword it cuts us right but it's to build us up in the end right so we can be healed and the balm applied to the cut and and be healed if we if we need some uh correction now first corinthians 14 5 i would that y'all speak with tongues but rather that you prophesied for greater is he that prophesy than he that speaketh with tongues except the interpret that the church may receive edifying now again greater that doesn't mean like he's greater like he's a greater christian he can just be used in a greater way right uh and it's all about god's wisdom you know uh none of us should ever complain well i wish my gift was greater i wish i'd you know god's the one who determined your gift praise god whether it's five two or one talent right god's the one who determines so just be happy with what we got yeah long for more i love that song but even about longing for more take that's that's beautiful god if we're faithful with it god will increase it praise god we know that and if others fail god may put that burden on us right or god may give us that burden and give us ability praise god there's one story brother ram told uh there was a husband and wife and they heard brother evan's message she was a woman preacher i forget the name of the couple karen might remember i don't know it's a story but i'm told and when she heard the message she sat down and brother man said the gift went on her husband now of course he was already ordained to be a preacher but that extra anointing came on him uh and so there's uh numerous examples we could say where if someone's not faithful with it like with judas he wasn't faithful so god raised up matthias and i know he got it by lot but he did a lot for the kingdom of god he took the kingdom a very long way so did thomas right remember we've been through that a little bit thomas did a lot for god he only dotted for just a little bit but after that he was a soldier servant and so uh we want to be we want to do all we can do to build people up okay and so this is maturity you know if you're in the promised land and you're really living in the promised land and you're harvesting fruits of the holy spirit praise god you've got lots of fruits of the holy spirit and then you've got gifts of the holy spirit uh it's maturity on how you use them you gotta so this this is what i'm talking about is that one of the highest levels of maturity if you're baptized with the holy ghost and now you know your gifts and then investing in those gifts now we're talking adoption praise god right and even even if you can just look at one of those nine and say i know god's used me for that and you can look at that and pray for that say god just increase it and and then use me for any of the other eight whenever if you if you want to use me here i am praise god that's i think that's i think that's maturity don't you where because brother branson a lot of people don't get gifts operating because they're not yielded to god they're they're not consecrated and so that's why i like going through the testimonies and hearing all these testimonies of god doing great things that oh thank god we're uni that we can be unto the holy spirit praise god but we want to do more so i love it i love hearing those testimonies thank god now it they also keep the church clean peter had a gift of discernment and he discerned ananias and sapphiris lie and the bible said great fear came upon all the church so see what when gifts operate brother said he said if you are really a child of god and you see a gift operate he said it thrills your heart that's why i get through when you guys give your testimonies and people getting healed and dreams and uh god doing miracles in your lives it thrills my heart praise god because i'm a believer praise god i am and i want to hear what is god doing in your life wendy and karen i love to hear what god is doing because it's uh it's you uh investing in your gifts and being faithful and god using them to help other people praise god accomplishing your purpose on the earth amen amen hallelujah see it's growing up into maturity we want to help as many people as possible so i'm just happy i got that number million in my head we've helped over a million people [Laughter] i was at least a couple thousand of those just watching my videos make sure they you know they play the right way what did i say on that video sometimes i gotta go back and reference what what's the revelation on that one you can't remember everything but think about like that's a blessing to me and church your ties paid for my computer and the cameras to do those things your ties you gotta part in that that's what i use it for i mean i break most of the ties go to this it's reading right here which i love to do it but it's your ties that pay for the computer and uh the camera and everything and we it's all we're all in this together praise god i know that's a saying the world likes to use but we are all in this together praise god it's a it's a a body work praise god but see when gifts operate great fear see that reverence that's what we want church we want to come to church and that's why it's nice to see gifts operate here because it just creates a more of a reverent atmosphere because you know we all get loose i'm guilty you know we all get human but it doesn't have to operate here but it's just nice when it does praise god because it just creates a fear and reverence among the people that's what we want we want and we know god loves us because this was the book of acts church when peter was discerning that and people falling dead and uh people great signs and wonders and miracles there was super reverence people were ready to pray right they were ready to hear the word they're ready to sing everybody felt god's presence amen and that's what gifts are for praise god they're to build uh they're to edify they're to keep clean praise god and but remember we must as you know uh it's all about seeking the giver first right give yourself to the lord first and then he'll give you to somebody to help now pull up first corinthians 14 1 honey uh if you do that and brother bam's recommendation was never seek uh the gifts first he said always seek the giver okay but i just showed you those scriptures this morning desire the gifts right but follow charity so in other words we follow the holy spirit and at the same time we desire wisdom we desire knowledge we desire prophecy oh i want to know the future don't you amen just like the man said don't you want to look past the curtain of time praise god who wouldn't want to look past the curtain of time to know what's going to happen amen no matter what comes and goes no matter what storms come god has showed us the future we we have quite a few though yeah we have quite a few with uh uh the this prophecies brotherhood gave us follow after cherry so we are always following love anything i'm always going after love how can i love this person and as you're loving how can i love the church as i'm following that at the same time i'm desiring the nine gifts of the spirit to operate but this is what i need to grow in i need to pray for more prophecy right we need to pray for more of that because that's what the bible says it edifies the saints more i don't think if we had brother bang have we had a prophecy we had the discernment was by stephen and i confirmed that with three people that was 2006 or maybe quite a long time ago i don't know if you ever had a prophecy i can't think of any i don't think so now we've had dreams that were prophetic amen and who had one like that prophetic um my wife and i have dreams that was just before we were church though uh so see that's why the bible says it's important to pray for prophecy to so you're prepared right so you so you're anticipating god in the future so that's something that we can pray for so follow after them and desire so see there's got to be a desire this is where a lot of churches backslide they stop desiring these gifts of the holy spirit oh you don't need them they're up on the shelf well there's quotes brother bam says we just read the quote if you're in the promised land you got all kinds of gifts he didn't say they're on the shelf in the promised land he said you got all of them praise god so you got to balance out the quotes and and remember if church if we're not desiring spiritual things then what are we desiring natural things right right if you're not desiring the move of god then you're desiring to i don't know go home and do something i don't know go to the store and buy something i don't know i got to battle that too you know we all battle that but see that's why it's so important that your desires are in the outworking of the holy spirit and praying oh god work through our brother work through our sister today and minister to them and may we see something supernatural god and we have to desire that amen so that's so important to desire that we are not to be ignorant of the gifts yeah what scripture was that um be not ignorant was that the one no this scripture just kind of came to me here let me look real quick be not ignorant maybe that's yeah chapter 14. can you look up lydia i thought there was a scripture about don't be ignorant of the gifts just give me a moment here please ignore it maybe i got a word mixed up or something oh no it's twelve one yeah yeah sorry first one is twelve one i knew it was there somewhere and that's that and that's what uh i was sharing you know you know uh i'll go websites for years i've gone and just give me a website that lists everything so i can know i want to know what gifts i got y'all going to know what is how to understand the bible i just haven't found any that's really good so i'm like well if nobody's got one i'm going to make one you know but the bible said now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant now how many master churches do you think could name all nine gifts of the spirit and then know which ones they got operate in their lives remember that sheet we printed off last week or last year karen and we wrote examples of our gifts in them and i it was such a small sheet and karen's like how am i going to fit all these testimonies on this little sheet i thought that was a great testimony sister character because i didn't know you know i didn't i just uh and so how many people are ignorant they they don't want to know about gifts they don't care about gifts but paul says you you desire as you follow jesus christ love of god you desire spiritual things right and you're not ignorant of them right now for us it might look like this like if you know someone has a gift of discernment or something like you might go to them prayerfully and say can you kind of judge the situation here i know we know some people that we go to for those things words of wisdom who do you know that real good with advice that's a word of wisdom who do you know that knows a lot about the word knowledge they give you a word open up open up the whole doctrine for you just give you that right scripture oh that's knowledge knowledge so think about that you know there's we shouldn't be ignorant of them but how many would i say a lot of people are ignorant of them a lot of people are and it's not for us we're supposed to be i hate to say it's like this but you know the the people that left the message they say the message people brag and say they're the cream of the crop or worthy elite now we we don't say that now but but do i believe we should live on a higher spiritual plane yes absolutely absolutely so you know just like jesus disciples they were going to be head and shoulders above the pharisees right i mean spiritually it's not something brother johnny we pat ourselves on the back do we don't pat ourselves on the back well i'm god's elite you know what it's it's it brings humility but we should be amen praise god we should be we should have more understanding i know we got more discernment praise god right we judge we can judge those spirits pretty easily right most of the time that's the worldly spirit that's the holy spirit right so we in other words we should be a spiritually mature and elite group of people amen praise god and i hope that's under i hope you understand that we're not exalting ourselves or anything but when you have more revelation it gives more understanding now we need to realistically access i'm sorry assess the portion of faith that we have because every man is given a portion of faith so let's go to romans 12 6. you have a portion romans 12 6. brother man is famous for making that quote i love it he said uh i may not have the faith uh to go in the rapture and walk like enoch he said in a rapture he said but i'm never gonna get in anybody's way who could and i love that oh i think that's so powerful in other words i i got a gift but if i don't have as much gift as that person i'm not going to get in their way i'm going to support them praise god amen and that's what we have to understand church even with healing we may not have the faith to cure cancer but if somebody does praise god go ahead amen you may have prayer for we say something smaller like a headache no headache's very serious though when you got one right how many can save into that when you got a headache it's really serious uh toothache anything uh but the bible said it's a proportion or portion a a measured out amount having then gifts differing according to the grace that's given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith i think the most famous prophecy was 2013 when brother brooks told us in january he said the holy spirit told me many message many prominent message ministers are going to die this year that's when lee vale joseph coleman and numerous and i thought wow that was pretty because it was times it was time stamped and i think there was five if i'm not mistaken those were the two that were most prominent but it was time stamped i thought that was a genuine prophet uh prophecy from god it has to happen this year and so here we see uh you have a portion a portion just like with the towns right a portion of five a portion of two a portion of one and they operate uh according to the amount so you might not be able to move a mountain but you might move a hill right you you have a portion god and so whatever we have you know we have to understand god gave me that much and he wants me to be faithful that with that much and he may give me more because remember the parable was he didn't he wasn't faithful with this one give it to the other right okay so that's just a quick introduction quick review on gifs i think that was all i had let me just check real quick okay all right i got 20 minutes here that will be 40 minutes i've preached and then uh i'll stop all right let's quickly go well i shouldn't say quickly let's go through these just kind of thoroughly so in the book i list all nine and i give at least five examples or four examples of each one so that everybody uh can know uh some clear examples even from my life most of them are from our my life or our ministry that i give examples of okay so let me just see how much i got all right now and if you can if you can think about the testimonies we've heard from everybody and you can start kind of picking out well this brother this sister and if you're not sure come talk to me afterwards and remind me your testimonies maybe you and i can figure it out together but the whole point on that is just so you can start praying about that like lord i've seen you work in healing in my life help pray for others lord help me to be a vessel that you can use when someone gets sick right not ignoring that right but following charity and desiring god to move through your life praise god so wisdom is first it's the chief gift because it manages all others it's called the principle thing in proverbs 4 7. the principle thing the head of all things is wisdom solomon was honored by god because he asked for wisdom and then he proceeded to write proverbs which is a treasure trove of wisdom he had a gift of wisdom but as his life aged he failed to apply it all but jesus christ is the fullness and essence he's the person of wisdom praise god amen now wisdom is like sound advice so think about whenever someone's told told you to do something at a certain time in a certain way that's wisdom all right uh and it manifests its skill as its discretion or its judgment in the timely decision making and jesus said wisdom is validated by its results so you know something was wisdom when you look back and say wow had i not made this decision some bad things could have happened because jesus said wisdom is justified of her children so her children the results justify and tell what wisdom is right just like your children mothers you want your children their reflection of what you put into them praise god in many cases right so wisdom is justified over children and then the bible said wisdom builds the house amen and a wise man builds his house upon the rock so like a project manager building a house wisdom tells you what to do and when to do it so here's some examples jesus doing the taxes about taxes with caesar and giving money to god that was wisdom they knew what to do and when to do it right don't avoid one do both right and do it when they want it that was matthew 22 15-22 the wise virgins took time to repair extra oil in light i'm sorry for light in case the bridegroom tarried so that they're called wise virgins why because they made a decision i've got to have this ready uh just in case i run out later wisdom amen so making preparations praise god right now we're making preparations for the going away amen whether through the grave or through the sky amen we're making preparations praise god to make sure we got plenty of oil when the bridegroom comes that's wisdom third one i said paul's perception uh when he was surrounded by angry jewish counsel he had a perception that some of them believed in the resurrection so he shared his belief in the resurrection in acts 23 verses 6 through 11 and it saved his life he's going to die he's going to get beaten up by the mob but he had enough wisdom to know oh here there's a group they they believe in the resurrection they don't if i bring this up then this this group will come and save my life and he didn't agree with either group right he didn't agree with the any of the jews at that time they were all both out to kill him the pharisees sadducees but he had wisdom to be able to discern okay this is the right time let me bring it up now it'll save my life so it's what it's the right the sound doctrine there's a sound decision at the right time now here's two examples um a pastor was being uh from my ministry he was being wrongly accused a preacher came in and told him he was failing as a father he was a bad father to his children and it was about his children doing extracurricular activities and i said i said no brother brown did extra extra curricular activities and all you have to do is make sure it doesn't interfere with god i basically said it like that and the brother was crying he's like brother that is a thank you for that word of wisdom because he was being condemned by another preacher saying you're not a good dad can you imagine that that's that's in the message see we got and where's where's satan in attack writing the message see where his targets right you don't have to fight at the catholic church so much he's going to fight us right here so we can expect that god help me to be on my toes help me to have my armor on praise god be ready to discern and so he literally told me on the phone crying it was a word of wisdom another brother told me i gave him a word of wisdom he was i didn't know it but he was thinking about uh quitting preaching and i told him all those talent things i preached i just it was out of service i just preached the talents and i was talking about compound interest if you just i said you can't stop investing you've got to keep investing and if you invest faithfully that little little little is going to turn into massive and i was i was preaching and i looked back now amen i was preaching right in his face and i didn't even know like i was like you invest in the gift you know you gotta don't quit just keep praying and the next week he's calling me up but he's like he said brother jess i was ready to quit and you gave me a word of wisdom not to quit and i thank the lord for that because it was it was that time he was going to quit at that time so i thank the lord now anybody here i'll let you share it right now from your chair anybody here can think of a good word of wisdom maybe in your life or it's okay if you can't i couldn't think of many either you know i think so many things happen it's if you don't write them down and make a a john graham log because he's so good that guy and i love you john you probably not listen that man was he's a it's like loris loris is like i went to lawrence's house one time i said hey brother you've been running lately he got out a spreadsheet of every time he's ran like the last and how the distance and the time i'm like you got different gifts than me buddy and that's i appreciate i mean god's got a great variety you know god has a variety of character okay that's how john john graham made a list a few years ago of all the supernatural in our church just to encourage us i don't know what happened to it just all the testimonies over the years you know just to keep us encouraged but anybody think of like sound wisdom you got and you knew it was the lord at a certain time i know i'm kind of putting on putting you on the spot anybody got one that's okay no problem i just thought i would give you a chance to share what if you got one see i know they happen i just like it's hard to like think back and remember it but those are the two that were fresh on my mind now word of knowledge if wisdom tells you how to build knowledge is your building materials you need both to build a house so you'll find knowledge and wisdom are associated 30 times in the bible there's 30 scriptures that say wisdom and knowledge together they always go together like oil and wine and knowledge is information from god usually a scripture jesus calls knowledge a key of knowledge helps you enter into the door of god's will knowledge is understanding god's word uh needed to possess promises and escape satan's devices peter says we escape the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ amen i didn't realize that right there you you escaped pollutions through the knowledge oh i i don't have to live like this praise god i don't have the devil doesn't have to stay in my house the devil has to leave in jesus name praise god you escape pollution through the knowledge the understanding of jesus christ amen peter and philip both gave knowledge peter cited joel 2 on the day of pentecost and philip quoted isaiah 53 and peter opened the door to 3 000 souls being saved and philip opened the door to the philippian eunuch to be saved they entered the door of salvation through water baptism praise god amen they're saying peter what is this it's joel 2 praise god it's john 2 28 it's the knowledge of god amen and the the ethiopian what who's this talking about who is isaiah 53 he said it's jesus christ amen and he pointed them this is the knowledge of who this is and it opened the door of understanding that they could walk through acts 19 is probably the most beautiful one these they're all apollo's church is all fired up all they got is john's baptism though but paul comes in he said have you received the holy ghost since you believed and they said we didn't even know we didn't even have the knowledge of the baptism of the holy ghost he said you be baptized and he said he lays his hands on 12 of them and 12 of them get the holy ghost because they had no knowledge of the new birth but once they got their knowledge they were born again amen praise god in church i'll tell you like this talking with rod bergen yesterday nice guy he'd have any scriptures to back up what i had to say simon's like simon's like just whoa and i i think i left here saying oh i was talking to cam cam called me right after i said kim i said one thing i know brother we've got the word amen they've got intellectualism but we've got thus saith the lord amen they couldn't say nothing i was like you know i said well tell me can bruce jenner is it okay for bruce jenner to wear women's clothes because if he says yes he has to say yes because his wife can wear pants and if a woman can cross-dress it's okay for me and he said uh it's not for me to judge he said sinners are gonna sin and i'm like so when i got my turn i said it's wrong it's wrong because he was saying jesse you need to read this book read this book i said let me give you a book to read rod i said read women and pants it's a book sinners wrote and they show they show the the fall of women independence from the 1800s to the 1900s i got the book if you want if you want to borrow it but please give it back because it's a great book it was worth the read if you want to read it it was worth the read but there they there's no scripture they could say or they tried to corner me on the oh they tried to quote me on uh acts 15. they said uh brother jesse paul or paul had um a council member of the jerusalem council and the uh and they said the the they told the gentiles you only have four commands to obey and so he says see we're not under the law we're not under deuteronomy 22 5. see because the gentiles only have to obey four things oh is that right i said well sir i said well you forgot that was just the beginning to give them the foundation because paul went out in the deserts of arabia met jesus christ and jesus christ said you're a teacher to the gentiles give them the full counsel of god and then paul quotes all ten testaments from the from the oh from the ten commandments he quotes all ten commandments and brings them back to our day we are under the righteousness of the law we're we're not under the curse of the law the curse of the law is if you fail one you've missed them all we're not under that curse we can fail numerous times a day but when we confess them under the blood of jesus christ we're not guilty of all of them we're forgiven of all of them amen so see with if with their understanding then you don't even need paul's epistles because you just got four things you got to obey well they're a little too late for that see how they i said well the very one you're saying paul he was there with the four he went and said keep all these commandments without partiality he told he told that to timothy right and he said keep him without spot or blemish until the coming of the lord jesus christ amen oh i love that brother i'd love to see the lord in battle praise god let's just put the word there was numerous times i didn't know what i was going to say brother and just came out i was like oh glory praise god i didn't know what to say it just came to me because jesus promised he said when you've got the holy ghost it'll bring all things to your remembrance praise god amen now there's a few things i messed up on let me tell you one of them the last question the last question was brother rod saying he got um mistreated by message people and i felt like i messed up a little bit so if you listen to it you probably know what i'm talking about um and i just said oh brother that's heartbreaking i'm sorry to hear that but then i said i hope and i believe there are some people with divine love in those churches so what i felt like i messed up and i should have just disagreed and said rod i'm sure not everybody in the message doesn't have love so my answer kind of started out wrong but then i corrected it later on so just so you know i believe the churches they left have people that have divine love in them now i don't know how many right like you can go to churches and you can feel where they got love or not so it sounds like it but if you keep listening the next few sentences i say brother i hope and i believe some people in those churches have divine love so i was going to bed last night and that enemy was kind of condemning me i'm like jesus you know my heart i believe people have divine love in those churches so if you hear something wrong please let me know i'd like to i'd like to correct it i thank the lord okay five minutes let me finish up here we'll finish up with knowledge and maybe faith so uh i don't know who shared it with me but whoever shared first corinthians 6 12 with me uh it delivered it literally delivered me from chewing tobacco that scripture literally delivered me it was the knowledge i didn't even know but amen i didn't even know i could be free from that i didn't even know but once i knew i hung it up on my wall and i kept coping it and pretty soon it was gone praise god the knowledge of it opened it up to me praise god it's just like with the long hair thing as soon as i knew as soon as craig showed me men have to have short hair i went and cut it that day that day i didn't wait for a week that day he's like oh i don't want there to be any question if i'm uh masculine hair feminine hair i want to have masculine hair i think god's not falling out yet too my dad and grandpa my dad's got you don't have any hair so i'm thankful huh keep it as long as i got it they say it's what keeps you warmer but see that's just that knowledge i didn't even know but once we knew church right once we know once i knew that water baptism let me go down to the water praise god because it's knowledge it's a key to open up that area of victory that we can get and this is the one from brother it was brian hawkins uh my wife gave me a word of knowledge for him he was doubting somebody in this church i don't know who was attacking him oh you can't be a deacon and a preacher and i was talking to him on the phone and i said i'll pray for you i hung up and my wife said jesse phillip was both a deacon the preacher we looked in the scripture i called him up told him about it he started crying rejoicing and god gave him the victory now i don't know if brian would call that a gift of knowledge but i would call that a gift of knowledge i mean i read that in the scripture bang but i forgot about it but look at that my wife right there she could be a universal you know i thought praise the lord that that opened up a door where he's not under condemnation anymore he's in the room of the forgiven praise god right he's in the room of the victorious amen instead of living in condemnation you can live in that room if you want but god is jesus is the door out praise god amen he's the door out and you can lif you can move out so that's the beauty of just someone with a gift of knowledge to be able to give you that word and that word can just set you free it's a door it opens i'm sorry it's a key rather sorry it's a key to open the door and christ is the door so let's end with faith uh this is faith is a gift of a it's a gift of assurance not insurance assurance and it's an inner substance of god's desire and power to move obstacles problems sicknesses adversaries and they're figuratively described by mountains right as mountains uh and it's speaking god's word whether it's through prayer or whether it's speaking directly to the problem jesus teaches faith or a revelation of god's will about a specific work makes anything possible praise god jesus said that matthew 17 20 with faith god all things are possible praise god so examples the roman centurion jesus even said you've got great faith requesting that jesus speak the word only for a servant's healing which happened that same hour amen paul and a crippled man at lystra both had faith for healing uh paul loudly command the man to walk for the first time in acts 14 7-10 praise god hallelujah jose pronounced that barren couple would have a baby and one year later he was born on my birthday one morning i spoke to that mountain of my co-workers baroness and less than a year later they embraced their baby girl and i saw her at the smoothie shop last year and she just had twins so she had a baby girl and twins and and i i forgot to ask her about this but she had another dream about me and more children before the twins were born and i forgot to ask her about that so i actually prayed for her to have more children and she had more children but i don't have the details on that part her name she's a nice woman there very we had bible studies in her home that was a really good testimony um just spoke to that mountain of barrenness um and i and i i said it was faith when i commanded the critical spirit to leave our church and eleven days later it did i've shared that many times i was again through brother brian that's where brother brown was used by god uh to speak to that couple and tell them do what you want to do which one to do and they wanted to leave so god let him leave um brother cam's testimony he was talking to a brother who's gonna go hunting the next day i think i told you this uh and the anointing came on brother cam it was after church on a sunday night they were just talking he's like i'm i was on a friday night prayer meeting uh brother jonah and they're just talking about the buck and cam kim got the faith on him he said he said speak it right now whenever you speak now you'll have it tomorrow and jonah said i'm going to get a six point buck tomorrow and he went and hunted about i think 10 o'clock cam said he got a call and joan he said he said how's your six-point buck he said it's great i got it a few minutes ago so just a good example speaking the word praise god right speaking the word by faith so see search that's a gift i've seen it at least twice in my life you know speaking the word of god oh then with your dad too sisterhood uh brother bang brother bang you may have a gift of healing too buddy because you had faith to take that prayer cloth you had faith to do that so i don't know if you ever prayed for your children i know johnny's gave some great testimonies about that i know numerous mothers have prayed for their children right and god's healed them give to faith or maybe it's divine healing we'll get to that next time sometimes with divine healing and faith it's kind of hard because faith can lead to divine healing right divine healing is just going to be healing in time so things to watch and so this is something church i need to be devoted more to prayer god help me to be yielded so i can speak your word right for other people and i don't take it lightly church right i don't speak to every mountain you know sister wendy stubs or toe i don't speak to the mountain of stubborn or you know that stubbed toes gotta leave you know i would you know and she wouldn't do that for me right you know we got we got to be led by the holy spirit right but we're always always cautious of that now let me share this as we stand let's stand here for a moment i don't know if you remember amen on wednesday night we were fasting for my parents and their parents and bang's parents and i and i told the church i'm sorry can you can you stop the live streams remote um i forgot to let the church know that we were going to fast on when's
