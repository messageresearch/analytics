[0:02] and my absolute is the word the Bible
[0:06] and as a pastor here of the church my
[0:10] absolute is the word you let the Holy
[0:13] Spirit he's the prophet of the day let
[0:16] him come into your heart right now and
[0:17] examine with the word of God and the
[0:19] doubts about the message will be all
[0:21] dissolved he dissolves all the doubts
[0:24] you find out it's exactly on the word
[0:26] for this
[0:28] day greetings friends in the matchless
[0:30] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:33] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:34] viewer's question related to my video
[0:36] about the 1977 prediction of William
[0:39] brandham it's video number 108 and the
[0:41] viewer's question was as following can
[0:44] you give one example of a prophet in the
[0:47] Bible making a prediction that did not
[0:49] come to pass
[0:51] please so of course that'll be very easy
[0:53] to do by God's grace according to the
[0:55] holy scriptures but first friends I'm
[0:57] Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ
[0:59] Fellowship here in akaran Ohio USA I've
[1:02] been pastoring here for 18 years by
[1:04] God's grace and I defend the Gospel of
[1:06] Jesus Christ the original gospel he
[1:08] revealed to St Paul and then restored
[1:11] through the late Prophet William
[1:12] brandham 1909 to
[1:14] 1965 and also defend brother bram's
[1:16] Godly Christian character so this video
[1:19] is of course defending brother bram's
[1:20] Godly Christian character I could be
[1:22] wrong friends but it seems from this
[1:24] question that this individual is a
[1:27] rather well-known person who is against
[1:30] the message of brother brandham James
[1:33] Manuel 3671 I could be wrong on that I
[1:36] think I've interacted with him before
[1:37] but anyways this is a good question of
[1:40] course it's in connection to brother
[1:41] bram's 1977 prediction if you haven't
[1:43] watched that video please do that by
[1:45] God's grace there was mainly two reasons
[1:47] brother Bram predicted 1977 at least
[1:49] that's told on tape the first is that
[1:52] brother randam calculated the number of
[1:54] jubilees since the first Jubilee He said
[1:55] he worked out those dates and I believe
[1:58] it was the 70th or 50 th Jubilee since
[2:01] the first Jubilee would have happened in
[2:04] 1977 and of course that didn't come to
[2:06] pass but it's okay brother Ram didn't
[2:07] speak it in the name of the Lord it was
[2:09] just his human
[2:11] prediction and then second brother Bram
[2:13] said that the amount of years God gave
[2:15] to the Jews in the Old Testament was
[2:17] going to be the same as the Gentiles got
[2:20] from the time of the Gentile Church ages
[2:21] so about 2,000 years ago and from the
[2:24] time the Gentiles got the gospel they
[2:26] would have got the same amount of time
[2:27] as the Jews and their time would have
[2:29] ended in 1977 those were of course two
[2:32] mathematical calculations and brother BR
[2:34] was just doing his best to give people
[2:36] an awareness of The Nearness of the
[2:38] coming of the Lord Jesus
[2:39] Christ okay so moving on to the question
[2:42] now can you give one example of a
[2:43] prophet in the Bible making a prediction
[2:45] that did not come to pass please by
[2:47] God's grace I can give you three and
[2:49] then there's a possible fourth but let's
[2:50] look at the three here that are clearly
[2:52] seen in the scripture the first example
[2:54] is the prophet David in Acts 2: 29 and
[2:59] 30 the patriarch David is a prophet
[3:02] therefore being a prophet anyone just
[3:05] has to read Psalm 22 to realize that
[3:07] David was a prophet he prophesied of the
[3:08] Lord Jesus Christ his crucifixion also
[3:11] his resurrection in psalm 16 so that's
[3:13] undeniable that David was a prophet of
[3:15] God now let's look at the prediction he
[3:17] made that did not come to pass 1st
[3:20] Samuel 27:1 and David said in his heart
[3:23] I shall not perish One Day by the hand
[3:24] of Saul there's nothing better for me
[3:27] than that I should speedily Escape into
[3:29] the land of the Philistines and Saul
[3:30] shall despair of me to seek me anymore
[3:33] in any coast of Israel so shall I escape
[3:36] out of his hand and David arose and he
[3:38] passed over with the 600 men that were
[3:41] with him unto AES the son of mayo king
[3:44] of gath and so of course this was a
[3:47] prediction of David in his heart but
[3:48] then his actions manifested the
[3:51] prediction that was in his heart and of
[3:53] course David did not perish by the hand
[3:55] of Saul David lived his full life and
[3:57] just died of old age so there's one
[4:00] prediction that's recorded in the
[4:01] scripture by a prophet that did not come
[4:03] to pass of course some people might
[4:06] object to this example of David but I
[4:08] humbly disagree with them we're not sure
[4:10] if David said this prediction out loud
[4:12] it's likely that he did because all of
[4:14] his actions agreed with that thought and
[4:17] think of that friends he went to the
[4:19] camp of the enemy the Philistines and
[4:21] joined the camp of the enemy out of the
[4:23] fear of Saul so it's likely he said this
[4:26] prediction out loud but either way the
[4:28] Bible records this prediction for us
[4:31] from a prophet to show us that prophets
[4:33] made human predictions so again David is
[4:36] not disqualified for being a prophet for
[4:38] this prediction that the Bible records
[4:40] nor is brother random disqualified from
[4:42] being a prophet for predicting
[4:46] 1977 the second is Jonah 3:4 Jonah is
[4:50] the second prophet Jonah began to enter
[4:51] into the city a Day's Journey and he
[4:54] cried and said yet 40 days and Nineveh
[4:56] shall be overthrown so there's an
[4:58] obvious prediction there from a prophet
[5:00] of God and the nites accepted that as
[5:03] thus sayith the Lord and of course they
[5:04] repented in dust and Ashes and so forth
[5:07] and God spared them but that's a
[5:08] prediction that did not come to pass
[5:11] notice what the wording is Nineveh shall
[5:13] be
[5:14] overthrown and the third prediction is
[5:17] actually spoken in the name of the Lord
[5:19] from the prophet Isaiah in 2 Kings 20:1
[5:22] in those days was hezeki sick unto death
[5:25] and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amos
[5:27] came to him and said unto him thus say
[5:29] sayth the Lord set thine house in order
[5:32] for Thou shalt die and not live so it's
[5:36] thus sayith the Lord he will not live of
[5:38] course then Hezekiah threw his face to
[5:40] the wall prayed and Isaiah came back in
[5:42] with another word of the Lord and God
[5:44] gives him 15 more years to live so this
[5:47] thus sayith the Lord did not come to
[5:49] pass because another thus sayith the
[5:50] Lord came but it's still a prediction
[5:52] and this prediction is in the name of
[5:54] the Lord we know later this is called
[5:56] the permissive will of God because
[5:58] Hezekiah did not render the honor unto
[6:01] God that he should have for being given
[6:03] 15 more years he made some mistakes of
[6:05] course with the Babylonian princes
[6:07] coming in during this 15 years of Grace
[6:10] and so we know it was the permissive
[6:11] will of God the perfect will of God
[6:13] would have been for him to set his house
[6:14] in order right there with the first thus
[6:16] sayith the Lord the first prediction in
[6:18] the name of the Lord but God gave him
[6:20] the desire of his heart so those are
[6:22] three plain predictions prophets made in
[6:24] the Bible that did not come to pass
[6:27] David's prediction that he'd die by the
[6:29] hands of s
[6:30] Jonah's prediction that Nineveh would be
[6:32] destroyed and then Isaiah's thus sayith
[6:34] the Lord that Hezekiah would die but
[6:37] then God gave him 15 more years instead
[6:40] and the fourth one that's a possibility
[6:42] that prophets spoke this prediction and
[6:45] it didn't come to pass was in The Book
[6:46] of John the Gospel of John this is found
[6:49] in John
[6:50] 21:
[6:51] 21-23 Peter says Lord what shall this
[6:54] man do speaking of St John and Jesus
[6:57] said if if I will that he T till I come
[6:59] what is that to thee follow thou me then
[7:01] went this saying abroad among the
[7:02] Brethren that this disciples should not
[7:04] die so the Bible just says the Brethren
[7:08] had this saying that John's not going to
[7:09] die before Jesus returns so there's a
[7:12] possibility some of these Brethren would
[7:14] have been prophets like Peter maybe even
[7:16] John himself and it's possible there
[7:18] could have been other prophets among the
[7:19] Christian Brethren the church fathers
[7:22] there the Brethren that were gather
[7:23] there with the resurrected Christ in
[7:25] John CH 21 yet Jesus said unto him he
[7:28] should not die but if I will that he T
[7:31] till I come what is that to thee in
[7:35] closing friends hope this short video
[7:37] was a blessing by God's grace as message
[7:39] believers who truly love the Lord Jesus
[7:42] Christ and the holy scriptures we love
[7:43] getting questions we love that the Bible
[7:45] has Answers by the grace of God the
[7:47] Bible's our absolute as brother Bram
[7:49] taught us it's got to come to one final
[7:53] absolute and my absolute is the word the
[7:57] Bible and as a Pastor here of the church
[8:01] my absolute is the word brother Ram said
[8:05] the holy spirit is a dissolver of doubts
[8:07] just like it was in the days of Daniel
[8:10] the Holy Ghost dissolved all the doubts
[8:12] so we're thankful that the same Holy
[8:13] Ghost Daniel had is the Holy Ghost we
[8:15] have today Daniel was among them that he
[8:18] was a dissolver of
[8:21] doubts you let the Holy Spirit he's the
[8:23] prophet of the day let him come into
[8:26] your heart right now and examine with
[8:27] the word of God and the doubts about the
[8:29] message will be all dissolved he
[8:32] dissolves all the doubts you find out
[8:34] it's exactly on the word for this day
[8:37] and so this subject of the 1977
[8:39] prediction also goes along with the
[8:41] brown bear Vision video I made so if you
[8:43] haven't watched that I encourage you to
[8:44] watch it as well I believe truly
[8:46] vindicates brother brandom as a genuine
[8:48] prophet of God of course I have numerous
[8:50] videos on that as well but we are so
[8:52] thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ
[8:54] fulfilled the scriptures to finish the
[8:56] mystery of God in our day to send us a
[8:58] genuine prophet the late William
[9:00] brandham and our Prophet spoke with thus
[9:02] sayith the Lord and pointed us back to
[9:03] the Bible so we're so thankful for that
[9:05] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[9:07] and forever Hebrews 138 if you have any
[9:10] questions concerns or testimonies about
[9:12] this video please contact
[9:14] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[9:17] the desire of your heart
