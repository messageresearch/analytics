[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:08] of the lord jesus christ
[0:10] does genesis 4 verse 1
[0:13] disprove the serpent seed doctrine
[0:16] it reads and adam knew eve his wife and
[0:19] she conceived and bear cain and said i
[0:22] have gotten a man from the lord
[0:25] the answer is no genesis 4 verse 1 does
[0:28] not disprove the serpent seed
[0:31] and here's the reason why
[0:33] genesis 4 verse 1 is the literal
[0:36] interpretation
[0:37] of the symbolism in genesis 3 verse 6.
[0:41] by god's grace i briefly addressed this
[0:44] question in my 2021 book
[0:47] the 12 new testament mysteries revealed
[0:50] on pages 625 and 626
[0:54] if you're new to the serpent seed
[0:56] doctrine and have questions about it
[0:58] please see the description section below
[1:00] for links to my three-part video series
[1:03] about this important subject
[1:06] before we get into genesis 4 verse 1
[1:08] please know there are at least nine
[1:10] proofs of the serpent seed doctrine
[1:12] which are also in my 2021 book on pages
[1:16] 616 through 625
[1:20] they are
[1:21] proof or evidence number one the bible
[1:24] supports the serpent seed doctrine from
[1:26] genesis to revelation
[1:28] evidence number two
[1:29] the two trees in the midst of the garden
[1:31] were not literal trees because the tree
[1:34] of knowledge of good and evil was not
[1:36] good for food
[1:38] evidence three the tree of life was
[1:40] jesus's spirit because there is only one
[1:43] way to eternal life
[1:46] evidence for the serpent seed doctrine
[1:48] explains the purpose of the virgin birth
[1:51] of
[1:52] jesus evidence number five adam and eve
[1:56] covered their loins after eating the
[1:58] forbidden fruit
[2:00] evidence six god's punishments for eve's
[2:03] sin centered on her sexual reproduction
[2:06] and longing for adam
[2:09] evidence number seven the serpent was
[2:11] human-like before the fall
[2:15] evidence number eight cain was the
[2:16] serpent's son and not adams
[2:20] and evidence number nine the seed of the
[2:22] woman was a literal man jesus
[2:25] and so was the seed of the serpent a
[2:27] literal man cain
[2:30] now back to genesis 4 verse 1.
[2:32] yes friends genesis 4 verse 1 is the
[2:35] literal interpretation of the symbolism
[2:38] in genesis 3 verse 6.
[2:41] in genesis 4 verse 1 everyone
[2:43] understands the word new means sexual
[2:46] relations but this verse is only a
[2:48] repeat of genesis 3 verse 6
[2:51] wherein eve shares the fruit with adam
[2:55] the previous nine evidences support this
[2:58] because the fruit of adultery
[3:00] and eve's sexual relations with adam
[3:03] produce two seeds
[3:05] and remember god is the one who
[3:07] originated the two seeds or serpent seed
[3:10] doctrine in genesis 3 verse 15.
[3:14] god said he would put enmity between thy
[3:16] seed the serpent's seed or offspring
[3:19] and her seed the woman's seed or her
[3:22] offspring
[3:24] so again the serpent seed doctrine did
[3:25] not originate from brother branham or
[3:27] any other man
[3:29] god is the one who gave us the
[3:30] understanding that there were two seeds
[3:32] in the garden of eden
[3:34] genesis 4 verse 1 repeats genesis 3
[3:37] verse 6 with a literal interpretation
[3:40] along with further information about the
[3:43] act including cain's name and gender
[3:47] simply put genesis 3 verse 6 is symbolic
[3:50] and genesis 4 verse 1 is literal
[3:53] the bible often switches from symbolic
[3:56] to literal interpretation
[3:58] as easily seen in a couple examples
[4:02] think of revelation chapters 17 and 18
[4:04] as the first example
[4:06] in chapter 17 verses 3 and 4
[4:09] you see a seven-headed beast and an evil
[4:12] woman symbolically described but their
[4:15] literal interpretations are found in
[4:18] chapter 17 verse 9 and chapter 18 verse
[4:22] 10
[4:23] because the seven heads
[4:24] mean seven mountains
[4:26] and the woman represents that great city
[4:29] or rome
[4:31] a second example
[4:32] is again in genesis
[4:34] genesis has multiple events repeated
[4:37] in succeeding chapters
[4:39] with additional information provided
[4:42] such as chapters 1 and 2.
[4:44] genesis 1 verses 26 through 31 records
[4:48] mankind's creation on day 6. but genesis
[4:51] chapter 2 verse 7 and verses 21 and 22
[4:55] gives more information about the same
[4:57] event by detailing how god created adam
[5:00] and eve's bodies from the dust of the
[5:02] earth and breathe life into them
[5:05] so here are three examples wherein the
[5:07] bible switches from symbolic to literal
[5:10] interpretation
[5:11] and this is undeniable friends
[5:14] as the bible says in the mouth of two or
[5:16] three witnesses let every word be
[5:18] established
[5:19] the serpent see does not pertain to
[5:21] salvation
[5:23] before finishing this video friends
[5:25] believers do not need to accept the
[5:27] serpent seed doctrine to be saved since
[5:30] it does not pertain to salvation
[5:32] justification by faith is the doctrine
[5:35] needed for salvation
[5:37] but the serpent see doctrine shines more
[5:39] light upon the gospel story and it takes
[5:42] away the confusion about the original
[5:44] sin
[5:45] knowing the forbidden fruit was adultery
[5:47] and not an apple helps you understand
[5:49] why god sent jesus christ via the virgin
[5:52] birth
[5:53] sin came into the world through sex
[5:56] so our deliverer messiah jesus christ
[5:59] who delivered us from sin's curse had to
[6:02] be virgin born and free from the sin
[6:04] nature in order to take all our
[6:06] iniquities upon him and pay our sin debt
[6:10] yes friends the serpents see doctrine
[6:12] answers the question why did jesus
[6:14] christ have to be virgin born
[6:16] he had to be virgin born because he had
[6:19] to bypass the way sin came into the
[6:20] world sin came in the world through lust
[6:23] or adultery between even the serpent so
[6:26] jesus christ had to come to the world in
[6:28] a sinless way in a way that would not
[6:31] give him the sin nature he had to come
[6:33] by virgin birth he was conceived of the
[6:36] holy ghost
[6:37] let's listen to brother branham's quote
[6:39] that says serpenty does not pertain to
[6:41] salvation
[6:43] and the seed of the serpent
[6:46] that's the killer
[6:48] many people don't believe that but if
[6:50] you'll just read in genesis the bible
[6:52] said that the serpent had a seed
[6:55] and i'll put enmity between the serpent
[6:57] seed and the woman's seed
[6:59] so the serpent had a seed
[7:03] and the serpent's seed was spiritual
[7:04] then jesus was not a man so the woman's
[7:08] seed was spiritual
[7:09] they both had seeds and the enmity is
[7:11] still there
[7:12] a serpent had a seed and if you just
[7:15] take your bible and get out and be real
[7:17] reverend before god
[7:19] i believe god will reveal if you and if
[7:21] you do not understand it i'm i'm
[7:23] available any time to do my very best to
[7:26] help you by a letter or by
[7:29] or by a personal interview or anything
[7:31] that i could do to help you of course we
[7:33] realize that that doesn't save a man
[7:36] neither does it condemn a man but it
[7:38] only brings life upon the subject that
[7:41] we're all trying so hard to get the
[7:42] people to see everybody it only brings
[7:44] life
[7:47] in closing
[7:49] if you have any questions about genesis
[7:50] 4 verse 1 please reach out and contact

[7:54] questions
[7:56] again we're thankful for the revelation

[8:02] seed doctrine
