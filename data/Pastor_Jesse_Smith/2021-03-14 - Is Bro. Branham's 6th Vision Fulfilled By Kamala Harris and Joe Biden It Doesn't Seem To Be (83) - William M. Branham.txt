TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ is brother branham's sixth vision fulfilled maybe but it's my personal opinion that it's not fulfilled two months ago after the united states presidential inauguration i was asked if i thought kamal harris was the fulfillment of brother branham's sixth vision my reply has always been it's possible but i personally don't think so based upon numerous quotes from brother branham numerous preachers have said the prophecy is fulfilled but those are all opinions as far as i can tell before getting into the specific reasons why i want to thank everyone for their supportive comments their likes their comments and shares the lord willing next year in 2022 i hope to leave youtube for a different platform such as vimeo or rumble i've already left facebook instagram twitter and amazon if you'd like to stay in contact with my ministry please visit my website pastorjessesmith.com and at the bottom of the home page you'll sign up for my newsletter slash blog you'll get updates on new videos new books and more lord willing in june of this year my second book will be released it's about the mysteries of god that brother branham was used by god to finish now back to this video's topic a few christian brothers shared perry stone's video with me on the same subject of brother branham six vision and i agree with mr stone that it's possible the sixth vision is fulfilled but like him i'm not able to say so for sure also i don't watch stone sermons nor do i follow his ministry but i have noticed over the years that he often references brother adam's seven major visions let's review brother and seven major visions from 1933 and then i'll explain why i don't believe the sixth vision is fulfilled yet this summary comes from brother branham's book and exposition of the seven church ages and of course i believe brother branham was a genuine prophet of god he was the seventh church age messenger of revelation 3 verses 7 through 22. he fulfilled revelation 10 verse 7. he was a son of man revealing the son of man according to luke 17 30. he was also the elijah prophet jesus spoke of in matthew 17 11. the elijah prophet of malachi 4 5 and 6 and the ministry of restitution spoken of in acts 3 verses 20 and 21. the first vision was mussolini's invasion of ethiopia and the horrible end of his life and note that he died on april 28 1945. the second vision was hitler's rise during world war ii the siegfried line and also hitler's mysterious end of life and he died two days after mussolini on april 30th 1945. the third vision was the rise of fascism nazism and communism with the first two swallowed up by the third also an admonishment to watch russia the king of the north fourth a plastic bubble topped car running by remote control with a steering wheel running down beautiful highways and people inside playing a game to amuse themselves the fifth vision was the moral plight of the world centered on women who cut their hair and wore men's clothing eventually going into a state of undress the last picture brother ram saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron the sixth vision was the rising of a beautiful but cruel woman in the united states who held the people in her complete power brother branham said it was either the roman catholic church or a woman voted in by mainly the woman's vote the seventh vision was a terrible explosion and nothing left but debris craters and smoke all over america notice some details brother and gives on his tape sermons about the seven major visions change over the course of the final years of his life the reason for this in my opinion is that it seems brother branham did not have the original wording of his seven major visions since he did not have tape recorders when the original prophecy was spoken in 1933 nor were there educated scribes sitting in his church ready to write down every inspired word on that blessed sunday morning in 1933 so it seems over the course of decades following brother branham was trying his best to remember all the details of the seven major visions prophecies brother branham lived a much more rugged life compared to how his skeptics live today some of whom probably live pampered lives in comparison to the missionary and evangelistic life of brother branham brother ram did have vacations of course but otherwise was constantly traveling preaching praying for the sick pouring out every ounce of his physical strength for the sick and needy and in and out of visions on a daily basis which also drained his strength today brother branham's critics attack him for what seems like changes in the prophecies but i believe they're wrong it's obvious brother branham was trying his best to recall the details of the visions and as usual brother ranu's critics are jumping to false conclusions to their own folly here's three reasons why i don't think kamala harris and joe biden are the fulfillment of the sixth vision reason number one a couple details about the sixth vision do not seem to have come to pass i do recognize mrs harris wore purple for the inauguration as one quote and said i says a great woman stand up beautiful looking dressed in real highly royal black purple and i got little princess down here she was a great ruler in the united states perhaps the catholic church a woman is some woman i don't know it'll be the catholic church i don't know i can't say the only thing i've seen i've seen the woman that was all but there were more details brother and gave about that vision first he said the woman was beautiful and many don't think mrs harris is beautiful second the woman would be cruel and hold the nation in her complete power mrs harris certainly seems to be cruel as she strongly supports planned parenthood and abortions but she doesn't have complete power and the nation has not yet bowed to her as other quotes from brother branham say well over 100 million americans do not even consider her a legitimate vice president and certainly have not agreed to worship and bow to her nor obey her here are brother m's quotes about these subjects 13 stars everything's the 13. everything is a woman and remember thus saith the lord there'll be a woman rule before the end time she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the catholic church as a woman i'll see our great woman a nation bowed to her it'll be one before the end time thus saith the lord write it down and find out your young people see if it happens if it isn't i'm a false prophet then in the sixth vision there arose up in america a most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power i believe that this was the rise of the roman catholic church though i knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in america due to a popular vote by women friends notice brother branham says the exact words shall either be or these words show the interpretation was not certain so we must be careful not to interpret the visions ourselves in the church age book brother branham used the words i believed not god told me that this was the rise of the roman catholic church though i knew it could possibly be not god told me it was his interpretation was vague because he did not have thus saith the lord on the exact interpretation but some people today think they have the exact interpretation additionally to me it seems more likely the beautiful woman is the roman catholic church as revelation chapter 17 verses 1 through 7 describes her as a beautiful church some say the sixth vision is fulfilled by all three of the following because of the quote from that time in 1960 biden is the president harris is the vice president and the roman catholic church again this is possible but i think that's an opinion recall brother branham's own interpretations of the fourth fifth and sixth visions were vague on purpose which is so different than the first three visions because brother branham didn't have the divine interpretation of the fourth fifth and sixth visions as he used the words or could be or might or i don't know reason number two some of brother branham's own words make it sound like the fourth vision is not yet fulfilled as it's in the process of coming to pass if the fourth vision isn't completed then it's likely the fifth and sixth vision aren't fulfilled either looking at some of brother graham's descriptions of the driverless cars capabilities we understand they have not yet been realized such as the elimination of car accidents due to remote control brother branham said when the vision was fulfilled he said the cars couldn't hit another car because of remote control and also said that cars would keep getting more like an egg until the last day shape of an aide i said it will come to pass that those cars will not be run by a steering wheel it will be something other run it's that cars you're bringing out right now remote control for safety correct you won't be able to enter into a city any 20 mile zone you just go 20 miles you can't hit another car because it's remote control see it's going like that right now but at other times brother branham made it sound like five out of the seven visions were fulfilled so we have brother brahms two different opinions on these subjects this is why i humbly believe the fourth vision isn't completely fulfilled yet it's still in the process of coming to pass here are the quotes i said such progress will take place i said see automobiles looking like an egg going down the street as cars down highways with some kind of a control they don't have to guide it i see an american family playing checker in the back of a car they've got the car right now they just had the highways to put it on the little volkswagen's a perfect game just exactly and it's uh all the other cars could you imagine 19 and 33 what the cars look like to now now let me say this can anyone prove any of those visions wrong were they not all fulfilled yes each one has been fulfilled or is in the process right now mussolini invaded ethiopia successfully then fell and lost it all hitler started a war he could not finish and died mysteriously communism took over both the other two isms the plastic bottle car has been built and is awaiting only a better network of roads women are all but naked and are even now wearing topless bathing suits and just the other day i saw in a magazine the very dress that i saw in my vision if you can call it a dress it was a plastic transparent type of cloth with three darkened spots that covered both breasts in a small area and then there was a dark place like a small apron below the catholic church is on the rise we've had one catholic president and will no doubt have another from my understanding of brother branham's quote it seems we're still waiting on both the driverless cars and the beautiful highways or road systems notice in this quote the driverless car was coming on the scene but was not yet on the scene and it is still not on the scene today in 2021 as far as we've witnessed now that brings us into the election of president kennedy and this car coming on the on the scene bringing five things out of the seven that has happened exactly reason number three regarding the fifth vision it seems the fifth vision is in the process of coming to pass as well brother branham saw the little fig leaf dress in a magazine that he'd seen in his vision moving him to say the vision was fulfilled but to me it seems this vision is still in the process of coming to pass as well because women on a national scale have not yet entered the state of undress as he called it the fifth vision had to do with the moral problem of our age centering mostly around women god showed me that women began to be out of their place with the granting of the vote then they cut off their hair which signified that they were no longer under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights or in most cases more than equal rights she adopted men's clothing and went into a state of undress until the last picture i saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron with this vision i saw the terrible perversion and moral plight of the whole world certainly the popularity of leggings shows the state of dress is moving in the direction of undress but it doesn't seem the women have reached the level of immodesty or undress brother branham saw in the vision i believe god's fulfillment of each vision will be so incredibly obvious that it will be undeniable just as the first three the whole world had to recognize mussolini's death and hitler's death and the rise of communism during and following world war ii as for the fifth vision believers i've talked to have never seen a woman dress in a little fig leaf dress style which we are thankful for in one way but according to prophecy it's coming to pass in the future so it seems the fifth vision is in the process of coming to pass as well being careful discerning between the human side versus the prophetic side in the second half of this video i want to remind my friends that brother branham taught us to be very careful when deciding if his words were his human thoughts or if they were god's thoughts you hear him say this and he cares to you care 1963 when asked if his previous prediction about martin luther king jr leading millions into a death trap was a prophecy or not note brother branham had publicly stated on three occasions oh lord just once more the third exodus and the indictment that millions of african-americans would die by martin luther king jr leading them into a death trap when asked whether his prediction that millions would die was from the lord he plainly said no that's just my opinion here's brother adam's did you prophesy that there be a million negroes uh killed on the or did you just announce that there would be this happening now see i've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to i think there's so much of it that it's just the human side but always if there is something that goes forth it will speak it it's thus saith the lord even to visions or anything no i just was talking about martin luther king on this great disaster that they're having in the south with the the colored people i said if those people were slaves i'd take my church and go south to help them people out of slavery i sure would because man makes slaves not god it's inspired of the wrong thing you see see they them people and that's reason i see that not that there is any uh any prophecy concerning it i have nothing on it from the lord and being sure now if i say anything from the lord like that to tell you it's always i'm speaking now but when he speaks i say it's not me it's thus saith the lord and i can't say it until he tells me i could be altogether wrong in my thought about martin luther king i don't know i can't say that's just my opinion based upon this quote friends notice that the fulfillment of the fourth fifth sixth and seventh visions were never pronounced by brother branham as being fulfilled with thus saith the lord brother branham only said they were genuine prophecies that would come to pass with us saith the lord additionally it's easy to see from the numerous quotes we've already showed that brother branham recognized we were still waiting on certain conditions in order for the visions to be fulfilled let me share a clear example of how important it is to discern between the human side and the prophetic side of brother branham as it can be literally one breath away in 1965 brother branham said with thus saith the lord that a woman is spiritually dead if she cuts off her hair yet dances sings in the choir speaks in tongues runs and joins aid societies this is true as both jesus and paul taught false christs or religious people who only get temporarily anointed by the holy spirit later live a life of iniquity and are not born again they are dead in their souls having never received the quickening life of the baptism of the holy ghost now listen to brother branham pronounce this truth in the authority of thus saith the lord but in the next breath he references the wrong scripture saying first corinthians 14 but the chapter on hair length is first corinthians 11. if she cuts it off i don't care how much she dances sings in the choir speaks in tongues runs up and down or has all kind of aids society she's dead that's thus saith the lord the word of god first corinthians 14. amen she denied her nazarite bow and sold out to the god of this modern age she doesn't i'll shame on you lady or woman if you listen to this quote in context from the god of this evil age brother branham is talking about a woman's hair as a nazarite vow his overall topic was not speaking in tongues which first corinthians 14 fully covers the scriptural authority for a woman cutting her hair and being spiritually dead is in first corinthians 11 verses 5 and 6 and verses 13 through 15. those scriptures say it's a dishonor and a shame or a disgrace vile reproach according to the greek lexicon for a woman to cut her hair for she dishonors her husband and eventually christ and eventually god so again our conclusion is exactly what brother branham said be careful what you're listening to because there's so much of it it's just the human side we should be careful before saying the fourth fifth and sixth visions are already fulfilled i believe this is why brother branham said a preacher who can rightly divide the word of truth is the most important thing today along with brother branham's martin luther king jr opinion i want to show a few other topics he gave his opinion on and time has showed us his statements were simply his human opinions second 1977 brother brandon's prediction about the earth's total annihilation before 1977 has proven to be his own human opinion and not a thus saith the lord but between 9 77 i predict that either a great destruction or total annihilation of the entire earth between now and 77 i predicted it in 1933 and it'll a great woman will rise up and be president or something like that in the nation and then there will come a total annihilation the entire nation will be wiped out and that i predict now this is not the lord saying this the other about the woman in his is the lord but i predicted in 19 and 30 33 that the world would be total annihilation before 77. so i didn't know that they had something that could annihilate it like they got now but i seen the nation in total annihilation just stumps and trees and things like that that so it's on its road and at 1906 the lady was seeing church aid set in and i don't know where to land but i predict it will be done by 1977. i predict not the lord told me but i predicted according to a vision that would show me some uh years ago that five of those things says oh the seven has already taken place about according to history there has never been a democracy at any time last over 200 years that was 1776 july the 4th and we're just 11 years left will it make it no camp 11 years if it does it'll break all history because jesus did not say no man could know the year month or week in which his coming was to be completed so i repeat i sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and usher in the millennium third brother branham said there would be no generation after his generation in 1958 and 1965. brother branham twice said we can't have another generation and we can't go another generation obviously these statements were just his opinions if they were based upon his understanding that a generation is 40 years but these statements were never spoken with thus saith the lord so they were his opinions and brother branham is still a genuine prophet of abstain from god whole thing you don't have to make yourself moderate you make alcoholics when you do that oh we'll let her do this and let him do this and so forth like what can you expect we can't go another generation we can't do it we're at the end look at this teenage insane well we had a i told you the other day they've taken analysis there of the schools in arizona where i live and 80 percent of the children in school is mentally what will their children be we can't have another generation we're at the end jesus said these things would come but the word said that they'd be there 70 years that generation faded away 40 years as a generation this is almost two generations you're gonna be out hunter fourth brother branham said matthew 24 would be fulfilled and his generation would see the coming of the lord in the church age book this quote is closely related to the third opinion but here in the church age book brother branham said matthew 24 would be fulfilled in his generation since the pope visited jerusalem for the first time again if a generation is 40 years as brother branham repeatedly taught then a generation has come and gone and yet there is more to be fulfilled in matthew 24 such as the rapture in verses 40 and 41. matthew 24 mentions signs in the heavens concerning this last day just before jesus comes i wonder if you noticed such a sign recently christ was now outside the church here is the sign in the sky the last eclipse of the moon was a total eclipse it waned to a total darkness in seven stages in the seventh stage the total darkness came as the pope of rome paul vi went to palestine to make a holy tour of jerusalem he was the first pope to ever go to jerusalem the pope is named paul vi paul was the first messenger and this man goes by that name notice it is the sixth or the number of men this is more than a coincidence and when he went to jerusalem the moon or the church went into total darkness this is it this is the end this generation shall not pass away until all be fulfilled even so lord jesus come quickly in closing i trust you can understand how we must be very careful how we interpret brother branham's visions and also all the visions in the word of god and friends i'm open to correction if i'm wrong on anything please contact me if i miss something regarding brother branham's seven major visions i'll end the video with brother branham's quote from questions and answers on the seals in which he urges his followers to be real humble and just be real real solid now that's what message believers should be solid not flighty and not quickly jumping to conclusions and adding their own interpretations to things don't try to put any interpretation but just believe me as your brother we're living in a great hour we're living in a time where the well where you just be real humble be a christian try to live for god and live honest with your fellow man and love those who don't love you don't try to make any deceit you do you only make it a mysterious something and mess the real program of god up you're not supposed to know these things so don't but no interpretation to anything see you just go ahead and just remember what you're told live a christian life go to your church be a real life wherever you are and just burn for christ and tell the people that how you love him and just let your testimony be with love all the time with the people see well if you don't you twist yourself out into something there and then you're off the beaten track see every time you've tried to do it you've done that see so just don't don't we're going to try to make your interpretation and especially tonight when that seal becomes up in front of you just don't try to interpret it you just go ahead and just be humble and go right on with the same plain message i just don't interpret nothing if god wants you anything he'll send it to you so just be real real solid now hold still something has happened and now just be real you understand what i mean don't you and just be don't try to make yourself odd to be a christian because you take yourself away from god please contact me if you have any questions or concerns or testimonies about this video god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
