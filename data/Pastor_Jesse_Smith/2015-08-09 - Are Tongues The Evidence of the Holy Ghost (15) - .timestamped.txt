[0:11] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose
[0:16] this video is to answer the question our
[0:18] tongues the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[0:20] will start right away by saying that we
[0:23] do not believe tongues are the evidence
[0:25] of the Holy Ghost we want to give seven
[0:28] clear Bible based reasons to prove this
[0:31] and we know it'll be a blessing to your
[0:33] heart reason number one Jesus told
[0:36] everyone what the real evidence of the
[0:38] Holy Ghost would be and it wasn't
[0:40] tongues Jesus said the evidence of being
[0:44] born again was being led by the Holy
[0:46] Spirit into all truth according to st.
[0:49] John 16 verse 13 true children of God
[0:52] can be taught of God according to st.
[0:54] John 6:45 being anointed of the Spirit
[0:57] to do miracles or demonstrate gifts does
[1:00] not prove someone is saved it simply
[1:03] proves the Spirit of God was present to
[1:05] perform a miracle or manifestation but
[1:08] doing the will of God and living a life
[1:10] without iniquity proof someone is saved
[1:13] according to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15] himself in Matthew chapter 7 verses 21
[1:18] to 23 reason number two no Bible
[1:24] scripture used the literal word evidence
[1:26] to declare the initial evidence doctrine
[1:30] the word evidence is only used one time
[1:33] in the King James Version Hebrews 11
[1:36] verse 1
[1:40] this scripture has nothing to do with
[1:42] unknown tongues but it does have to do
[1:45] with our faith our faith is seen by men
[1:48] through our works according to James 2
[1:50] verses 23 to 26 is the evidence that we
[1:54] have the Holy Ghost born-again
[1:56] experience Jesus compared the Holy Ghost
[1:58] to the wind in John chapter 3 verse 8
[2:01] proving the Spirit is also unseen yet
[2:04] inside of us so this second reason goes
[2:07] along with the first reason the godly
[2:10] life you live by faith is the evidence
[2:12] you are born again
[2:15] reason number three tongs are not a sign
[2:19] for believers tongs are not assigned for
[2:23] believers according to first Corinthians
[2:25] chapter 14 verse 22 so they cannot be
[2:29] assigned to believers who are seeking
[2:31] the Holy Ghost baptism the Bible clearly
[2:34] teaches that one can be a believer and
[2:36] be baptized in water and yet not born
[2:39] again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:41] as seen through the Ministry of Philip
[2:43] the Evangelist in Acts chapter 8 verses
[2:46] 12 through 17 this means then that
[2:49] anyone who's seeking the Holy Ghost with
[2:51] tongues as the evidence is doing wrong
[2:54] because they are already believers they
[2:57] should not be seeking an unknown tongue
[2:59] because they are signed for unbelievers
[3:02] reason number 4 st. Paul taught that not
[3:06] all Christians speak in tongues
[3:10] not all believers speak in tongues
[3:12] according to st. Paul in 1st Corinthians
[3:15] chapter 12 verse 30
[3:20] it is a false teaching to try to
[3:23] convince every believer that they must
[3:25] speak in tongues it is important to note
[3:27] though that Paul wished all believers
[3:30] would speak in tongues in 1st
[3:32] Corinthians 14 verse 5 because of the
[3:34] powerful edification that the gift
[3:37] brings to the individual according to
[3:39] 1st Corinthians 14 verse 4 and the
[3:42] potential edification it can bring to an
[3:44] entire congregation
[3:46] if the unknown tongue would be
[3:48] interpreted so that everyone understood
[3:50] what the tongue meant with
[3:52] understandable words according to 1st
[3:54] Corinthians 14 verse 5 reason number 5
[3:58] the Bible does not record tongues being
[4:01] manifested every time believers were
[4:03] born again by the Holy Ghost
[4:07] most the Bible teaches there were
[4:10] tongues three out of the five times in
[4:12] the book of Acts when the Holy Ghost
[4:14] fell and filled or baptized believers
[4:17] this proves tongues are not present
[4:20] every time the Holy Ghost comes God must
[4:23] have a need to manifest the power of
[4:25] tongues or he will not send that
[4:27] manifestation there were tongues present
[4:30] in Acts chapter 2 verses one through
[4:32] five Acts chapter 10 verses 44 to 46
[4:36] Acts chapter 19 verses five and six but
[4:40] there were no tongues in Acts chapter 4
[4:42] verse 31 and acts chapter 8 verse 17 so
[4:46] God must not have needed tongues in Acts
[4:49] chapter 4 verse 31 because all the
[4:52] believers there were Jews like Peter
[4:54] John and the company and spoke the same
[4:56] language God did not need to use tongues
[4:59] in Acts chapter 8 verse 17 because all
[5:02] the believers there were Samaritans and
[5:04] no doubt spoke and understood the same
[5:07] language reason number 6 all tongues in
[5:11] the book of Acts were understood but
[5:14] today they are mostly unknown
[5:19] genuine tongues from the Holy Ghost in
[5:21] the book of Acts were always understood
[5:24] when sent by God which means they were
[5:26] not unknown tongues all believers always
[5:30] understood what was said in Acts chapter
[5:32] 2 Acts chapter 10 and Acts chapter 19
[5:35] when the Holy Ghost fell and tongues
[5:38] were manifested the proof of this is
[5:41] found in Acts chapter 11 verse 15 when
[5:44] Peter said the Holy Ghost fell at the
[5:46] house of Cornelius the same way it did
[5:48] on the day of Pentecost
[5:53] all the tongues that manifested on the
[5:55] day of Pentecost were understood than
[5:57] any other tongue given when the Holy
[5:59] Ghost fell in the book of Acts had to be
[6:02] understood as well based upon the
[6:04] testimony of st. Peter
[6:06] but the sincere Bible believer has to
[6:09] admit that all tongues in the book of
[6:11] Acts were understood by the ears based
[6:14] upon acts 11:15 acts 2:4 through 12:10
[6:18] 44 to 46 and 19 1 through 6
[6:22] everyone always understood the languages
[6:24] when the Holy Ghost fell in the Bible
[6:29] today there is a false teaching that
[6:31] says only unknown tongues come at the
[6:34] receiving of the Holy Ghost but that is
[6:36] actually opposite of what happened in
[6:38] Acts chapter 2 verses 4 through 12 in
[6:41] acts 2 the Galleon tongue spoken by the
[6:45] 120 Holy Ghost Vil believers were
[6:48] understood by the 17 people groups or
[6:51] languages that were present in Jerusalem
[6:53] on the day of Pentecost Peter then
[6:56] preached in the Galilean language to
[6:58] those 17 groups and they all understood
[7:01] his preaching were convicted and 3,000
[7:04] souls were baptized that day so the
[7:06] miracle was in the hearing of the
[7:08] listeners not in the expression of
[7:10] unknown tongues like many people think
[7:13] today in modern services today there are
[7:16] usually unknown tongues and no one
[7:18] understands what's being spoken which is
[7:20] completely opposite of what took place
[7:22] in Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 10 and
[7:26] Acts chapter 19 reason number seven no
[7:30] one knows the actual source of an
[7:32] unknown tongue without an interpretation
[7:35] or judge
[7:39] God desires tongues of men and angels to
[7:41] be manifested in his people as Saint
[7:43] Paul taught that the gifted tongues
[7:45] should be in the New Testament church
[7:47] according to 1st Corinthians chapter 12
[7:49] verse 10 but it must be used properly
[7:52] and kept in order according to the
[7:54] entire chapter of 1st Corinthians
[7:56] chapter 14 the problem with unknown
[7:59] tongues as the absolute evidence that a
[8:02] person is born again is that no one
[8:04] knows the source of the tongue unless it
[8:06] is interpreted or judged according to
[8:09] 1st Corinthians 14 verse 29 speaking in
[8:13] tongues can be easily impersonated by
[8:15] the devil and his servants as reports
[8:18] from real missionaries and even
[8:20] religious encyclopedias describe one of
[8:23] the evidences of demon possession as
[8:25] speaking in an unknown tongue which is
[8:28] called glossier we cannot believe that
[8:30] witches and other workers of witchcraft
[8:32] are born again by the Spirit of God just
[8:35] because they spoke in an unknown tongue
[8:37] so unknown tongues cannot be the
[8:40] evidence of the Holy Ghost baptism
[8:41] because if it is then you would have to
[8:44] accept every kind of unknown tongue from
[8:46] any person as being evidence of being
[8:49] born again
[8:55] Saint Paul taught that he would rather
[8:57] speak five words with understanding than
[9:00] 10,000 words in an unknown tongue
[9:02] according to first Corinthians 14 verse
[9:05] 19 the Apostle taught that unknown
[9:08] tongues do not profit the ears unless
[9:10] they know the meaning of the tongues
[9:12] according to first Corinthians 14 verses
[9:15] 6 and 11 in fact Paul said a person that
[9:19] spoken unknown tongues would seem like a
[9:21] barbarian to a listener who could not
[9:24] understand his unknown tongues in 1st
[9:27] Corinthians 14 verse 11 an honest Bible
[9:31] reader should be able to see the
[9:33] importance st. Paul placed upon
[9:35] understanding the meaning of tongues
[9:38] this proves that unknown tongues without
[9:40] understanding the meaning of them were
[9:42] not the tongues that God gave on the day
[9:44] of Pentecost because the tongues the
[9:46] three thousand souls heard were
[9:49] understood and they knew the source the
[9:52] tongues were from God and were declaring
[9:54] the wonderful works of God and also
[9:56] declared that Jesus whom the Jews had
[9:59] crucified was Lord in Christ and was
[10:01] risen from the dead the three thousand
[10:04] souls that were saved did not think the
[10:06] Christians were barbarians and only
[10:09] speaking in unknown tongues the three
[10:11] thousand heard the Christians declaring
[10:13] the wonderful works of God and the fact
[10:15] that Jesus was both Lord and Christ
[10:17] according to Acts chapter 2 verse 11
[10:19] verses 36 and 37 the Holy Ghost has not
[10:24] come with one mandated observation as
[10:27] Jesus taught in Luke chapter 17 verse 20
[10:30] the Holy Ghost does come with a powerful
[10:33] dynamic experience that others can see
[10:36] in here according to Acts chapter 2
[10:38] verse 33 but it cannot be limited to
[10:40] tongues because gifts are not evidence
[10:43] of being saved and gifts can be easily
[10:45] impersonated the pure godly and holy
[10:49] life a person lives after having a
[10:51] dynamic spiritual experience will prove
[10:54] they have received the genuine Holy
[10:56] Ghost experience the life of Christ is
[10:59] the evidence not an unknown tongue for
[11:02] I've witnessed examples of people who
[11:04] spoke in tongues thinking they were
[11:06] getting the evidence then later they
[11:08] turned away from God through sins like
[11:10] adultery
[11:11] and other evils a doctor's who do not
[11:13] repent will not inherit the kingdom of
[11:16] God so their life proves they were never
[11:18] born again they may have been anointed
[11:20] by the spirit to manifest the gift of
[11:22] tongues but that is not the same as
[11:24] being born again we must seek the giver
[11:27] before we seek his gifts our prayer is
[11:31] that you will seek the giver of the
[11:33] gifts and not the gifts only for if you
[11:36] receive the giver first the Holy Ghost
[11:38] then he will add all things unto you
[11:40] including any gifts when it is his time
[11:44] for them to be used in your life god
[11:47] bless you and may Jesus Christ be the
[11:49] desire of your heart if you have any
[11:53] questions about how times are not the
[11:55] evidence of the Holy Ghost or if you
[11:57] like more information about the true
[11:59] evidence of the Holy Ghost being the
[12:01] Holy Ghost himself and the life that
[12:03] follows please contact us
