[0:02] I enjoy brother Neville's preaching and
[0:04] everything and I certainly enjoy that
[0:06] fine oldfashioned singing it and it was
[0:09] a marvelous Masterpiece that I ever
[0:12] heard one and I was so happy to know
[0:15] that uh the one who the Lord was using
[0:18] to bring the message I was associated
[0:20] with in the work of the
[0:23] Lord greetings friends in the matchless
[0:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:27] purpose of this video is to see how
[0:29] God's prophet brother William brandham
[0:31] supported and was benefited very much by
[0:34] Brother Orman Neville's radio Ministry
[0:37] at least from 1954 to the end of brother
[0:39] Ram's life
[0:41] 1965 based upon these quotes from God's
[0:43] Prophet brother brandham it shows he
[0:45] lovingly happily and enthusiastically
[0:48] supported the five full ministry he
[0:51] supported the Outreach Ministries of the
[0:53] fivefold ministry and it proves William
[0:55] Brandon was not a press play and Obey
[0:58] legalist or Bible n like the current
[1:01] brandom Tabernacle has become the
[1:03] current brandom Tabernacle is in a sad
[1:05] very sad spiritual condition they don't
[1:07] even physically attend church brother
[1:09] brandom always physically attended
[1:11] church and brother Bram said you cannot
[1:13] be as good of a Christian if you don't
[1:15] physically come to
[1:16] church now the fell said I be a
[1:19] Christian and stay home just as well no
[1:21] you can now you've got to meet together
[1:24] with the rest of the body he has blessed
[1:27] us together in heavenly
[1:30] in Christ
[1:32] Jesus and to you old man or woman when
[1:35] you separate yourself from Believers
[1:36] people say I can stay at home be just as
[1:38] good a Christian as I can at church you
[1:40] can't the Bible said not forsake our
[1:43] stim ourselves together and that much
[1:44] more as we see the time coming if you're
[1:46] a Christian you long to go where other
[1:48] Christians are in fellowship with other
[1:50] Christians so you cannot stay away from
[1:52] church and live the same life it can't
[1:54] do it because it's like I I I I'm hungry
[1:57] but I'll never go to a table I just I'll
[2:00] never eat I just I ain't going to do it
[2:01] see you've got to go and feed on the
[2:03] word of God and fellowship one with
[2:04] another we need one another more now
[2:07] than we ever did need each other is now
[2:10] as we go through these quotes from God's
[2:12] Prophet you'll see how brother BR
[2:14] believed in Outreach radio Outreach so
[2:16] of course today he would support YouTube
[2:17] Outreach podcast Outreach any means to
[2:20] get the Gospel of Jesus Christ out to
[2:22] the people and remember brother
[2:24] Neville's radio sermons were going out
[2:26] to the public anyone at all his sermons
[2:29] were going out to people who are not his
[2:31] sheep or not part of his home Church you
[2:34] know today some people are so critical
[2:36] of YouTube Ministries or Rumble
[2:38] Ministries or any social media
[2:41] Ministries it just shows they don't have
[2:43] understanding and brother Bram said when
[2:45] people are like that critical like that
[2:47] he said it's just their human mind wants
[2:49] something to pick on and up in that same
[2:51] place there was one looked like an eagle
[2:53] and one look like an Haw
[2:56] on where's them horses that come got
[2:59] Elijah
[3:01] I just goes to show you see the human
[3:04] mind just wants something to pick on
[3:08] that's right now I notic by God's grace
[3:10] I'll leave a link to the YouTube
[3:12] playlist of the videos I made on the
[3:14] over 24 lies coming out of brandom
[3:17] Tabernacle brother brandom said some of
[3:19] the most awfulest things you've ever
[3:20] heard such as brother brandom is
[3:22] perfectly infallible which is in essence
[3:24] what brandom Tabernacle is currently
[3:26] saying because its pastor says every
[3:28] word on tape is thus sayith the Lord
[3:31] that's heresy that's idolatry so shame
[3:34] on Bram Tabernacle the current bam
[3:36] Tabernacle and its leadership for
[3:37] promoting such idolatry such lies but
[3:40] hopefully this video will help somebody
[3:42] overcome those evil spirits by the grace
[3:44] of God so we'll start here in 1954 the
[3:47] first quote is acts of the Holy Spirit
[3:50] brother BR said I enjoy brother
[3:51] Neville's preaching and everything on
[3:53] the radio program he said his wife and
[3:56] kitties everybody watches for that
[3:58] program from what I've read it was
[4:00] either at 9:30 or 9:00 a.m. on every
[4:03] single Saturday morning he said we look
[4:05] forward to it and we're glad of it let's
[4:07] listen to the quote I enjoy brother
[4:10] Neville's preaching and everything and I
[4:12] certainly enjoy that fine oldfashioned
[4:14] singing that he and the sisters does to
[4:16] on the the radio program if you all have
[4:18] never heard them yet many of you or turn
[4:20] in every Saturday morning and listen to
[4:23] them and you'll certainly be blessed
[4:26] while my wife and kitties and
[4:28] everybody's watching to that program
[4:30] just like it was if I was going to be
[4:33] down there myself and I down there one
[4:35] of the loved one in the family we look
[4:37] forward to that that program on Saturday
[4:41] morning and we're so glad of
[4:44] it next in 1955 brother random said it's
[4:48] a fine radio broadcast the singing's
[4:51] really good let's listen to the quote
[4:54] and brother Neville will announce the
[4:55] full program on his broadcast next
[4:58] Saturday morning how many hear the
[5:00] broadcast don't you think it's fine I
[5:02] tell you that singing is really good I
[5:04] heard brother Temple I believe on it the
[5:06] other day and um I appreciate that song
[5:10] you dedicated to us we just all
[5:12] listening in and in 1956 brother random
[5:16] publicly apologized to brother Neville
[5:17] it seems like brother brandom was
[5:18] supposed to preach on the radio
[5:20] broadcast but he went to the wrong
[5:22] location so he said I want to publicly
[5:24] apologize to brother Neville but brother
[5:26] Rand was in Jeffersonville and he was
[5:28] supposed to be a New Albany for the
[5:29] radio broadcast let's listen to the
[5:32] quote and just before we have prayer and
[5:35] the reading of the word I want to
[5:38] apologize publicly to brother
[5:40] Neville yesterday I stayed home from
[5:43] down in Kentucky yesterday purposely to
[5:46] preach for him on the broadcast next
[5:48] Saturday God willing and brother Neville
[5:51] willing I want to speak on the morning
[5:53] broadcast next Saturday for brother
[5:55] nville and uh so he U was so gracious to
[5:59] to forgive me he's is he said I guess I
[6:02] took advantage of him and he's one of
[6:04] those guys that can I can pass the
[6:06] compliment back and U expecting somebody
[6:10] and what got me upset was early that
[6:12] morning when they called me to brother
[6:14] ly and them in new Aly and I it was just
[6:17] about 10 minutes to 9:00 and I said oh I
[6:20] supposed to be on that broadcast in 10
[6:22] minutes and here me and Jeffersonville
[6:24] him down there waiting for me so I
[6:27] brother Woods called him yesterday and I
[6:28] thought i' let brother Woods apologize
[6:30] for me first you know so he just
[6:33] penalized it to make me speak this
[6:34] morning come on down so here we was and
[6:38] so we were then next in September of
[6:42] 1956 brother BR asked if brother Neville
[6:44] and his sister would sing a song special
[6:46] he said because we all enjoy to hear
[6:48] them on the radio let's listen to the
[6:50] quote I would just like to ask brother
[6:53] Neville if he and his sister would sing
[6:55] a special for us just before would you
[6:56] like that we'd all enjoy we hear him on
[6:59] the radio
[7:00] all right tonight or not next in 1957
[7:03] brother Bram gave some of the most
[7:05] inspiring quotes about the radio
[7:07] Ministry brother Rand said he heard
[7:09] brother Neville preach one of the most
[7:11] appropriate sermons for the day that
[7:13] we're living in he said it was a great
[7:16] treasure dearly in my heart so this
[7:20] shows brother Brandon was a prophet of
[7:21] God who loved the fivefold ministry the
[7:23] fivefold ministry would strengthen him
[7:25] and give him great Treasures that lines
[7:27] up with 2 Corinthians I believe chapter
[7:28] 3 the Bible said we have treasure in
[7:31] Earth and vessels God using a pastor
[7:33] Ministry or man Neville to give a
[7:35] treasure to the prophet Ministry by the
[7:38] grace of God and also you find other
[7:40] little nuggets in here brother Ram said
[7:42] while they were listening to the radio
[7:44] program he was helping his wife by
[7:45] washing dishes then brother Ram says it
[7:48] was a marvelous Masterpiece the radio
[7:50] sermon by Brother Orman Neville if I
[7:53] ever heard one and then he was so happy
[7:56] to know that the one the Lord was using
[7:58] to bring the message through the radio
[8:00] Outreach he was associated with in the
[8:02] work of the Lord so it made him thankful
[8:05] wow I'm associated with this preacher on
[8:07] the radio that's putting out these
[8:10] marvelous masterpieces and then he prays
[8:12] that God would continue to be with Orman
[8:14] Neville for the great powerful messages
[8:17] the sermons not pressing play and Obey
[8:19] he was grateful for both the powerful
[8:21] messages in the song and in the word so
[8:25] brother Neville's Ministry was singing
[8:27] and preaching let's listen to this quote
[8:30] thank you
[8:33] brother it is understood that the
[8:36] Neville Trio is one of the best trios in
[8:39] the
[8:43] nation that's right that's
[8:47] right and um how many heard the
[8:50] broadcast
[8:52] yesterday I am an old veteran preacher
[8:55] over 20 years old and I Heard lots of
[8:59] sermons but I believe I heard one of the
[9:03] most uh appropriate sermons for the day
[9:08] that we're living I heard it yesterday
[9:10] by our pastor brother nille you who
[9:13] missed that missed the great
[9:16] treasure that was dearly in my heart and
[9:20] when my wife was washing
[9:23] dishes Juni I was helping her so that
[9:26] won't hurt Lord makes you woring too so
[9:30] while I was helping her wash the dishes
[9:32] we both had to stop uh to just to remark
[9:36] to each other how that the Lord was
[9:39] using our brother and yesterday's
[9:42] message on the radio and it was a
[9:45] marvelous Masterpiece that I ever heard
[9:48] one and I was so happy to know that uh
[9:52] the one who the Lord was using to bring
[9:54] the message I was associated with in the
[9:57] work of the Lord and so and the quart
[10:00] head or the trio yesterday was just
[10:02] marvelous and they are all the time and
[10:04] so is our pastor and we appreciate this
[10:06] with all of our hearts and pray that God
[10:09] will continue to be with our brother and
[10:13] Grant these great powerful messages both
[10:15] in song and in the word as the time goes
[10:19] on and then in the evening service that
[10:22] same day God keeps his word brother Ram
[10:24] said I wish every listener would listen
[10:26] to that program brother Neville's radio
[10:28] program he said I was never so blessed
[10:30] in listening to the program last
[10:32] Saturday he said how many heard that
[10:34] message that was a masterpiece so
[10:35] brother brah the same day later that
[10:36] same day is still feeding on the
[10:39] Revelation and the Masterpiece the Holy
[10:40] Ghost gave to brother Orman Neville on
[10:42] the radio sermon one of the brothers
[10:44] said who is that preacher and brother
[10:45] Ram said that's brother Neville that's
[10:47] his time on the radio notice the brother
[10:49] didn't say who's that tape boy pressing
[10:51] play the brother didn't say that the
[10:53] brother said who's that preacher then
[10:55] brother Bram said I love to hear Brother
[10:56] Neville speak not because he's a good
[10:58] preacher because he lives what he
[10:59] preaches let's listen to the quote and I
[11:02] wish that every listener would listen to
[11:04] that program now he doesn't tell me to
[11:06] say this but I never was so blessed in
[11:11] listening to a program as I was this
[11:14] last Saturday how many heard that
[11:17] message that was a masterpiece
[11:23] wlrp 9:00 until 9:30 each Saturday
[11:27] morning the Neville Trio
[11:30] and I was speaking to the brother who
[11:34] takes the recordings brother Leo which
[11:36] is in the
[11:37] room and he was so carried away with it
[11:41] that he didn't he said say who's this
[11:44] preacher he was has the radio on and
[11:47] brother Jean or some of them said it's
[11:49] brother naille this is his time and it
[11:53] really was wonderful not only that but
[11:56] everyone I tell you the reason I i' love
[12:00] to hear Brother Neville
[12:02] speak not mainly because he's a good
[12:05] preacher but because I know that he
[12:09] lives what he preaches and I would
[12:12] rather you would live me a sermon than
[12:14] preach me one it'll be more effective
[12:18] then in September 57 brother Bram said
[12:20] he really gets joy out of listening to
[12:22] the preaching and singing of brother
[12:24] Neville and then the singing of the
[12:25] Neville quartet let's listen to the
[12:27] quote and we're yall listen to his radio
[12:30] now and and and invite all your
[12:34] neighbors to listen I really get joy out
[12:37] of listening to their preaching and
[12:38] singing the Neville quartet I don't say
[12:41] that because he's sitting here if I said
[12:43] that didn't mean if my heart would be a
[12:45] hypocrite right I'd have to repent but I
[12:48] mean it now I'd rather give him a little
[12:50] Rose butt now than a whole Reef after
[12:52] he's
[12:53] gone then brother Bram says in October
[12:55] 57 regarding the Neville quartet I'm
[12:58] sure they do you good good turn and
[13:00] listen to them on the radio Ministry
[13:02] let's listen to the quote don't forget
[13:04] the services brother Neville's broadcast
[13:06] now that's on wlrp Saturday morning at
[13:10] 9:00 the Neville quartet and I'm sure
[13:12] they do you good turn in listen to them
[13:14] and if I can if I get back in time or
[13:16] see I'm going to get back I'll call wife
[13:18] if the Lord permits me go see dear old
[13:20] brother Bosworth uh uh you all and I'll
[13:23] be back Sunday
[13:24] night next in 1959 brother random and
[13:27] who is this said he and his wife and
[13:30] kitties will get around the little radio
[13:32] and hover around it to listen to brother
[13:34] Neville and his broadcast his wonderful
[13:36] words how he exalts the God that he
[13:38] loves and believes and brother Ram says
[13:41] he loves brother Neville because he was
[13:42] a theologian now most quotes make it
[13:44] seem like theologians are bad but here
[13:46] brother BR says a man in the fivefold
[13:48] ministry brother Bram said Orman Neville
[13:50] was filled with the Holy Ghost can be a
[13:52] theologian because it just means to
[13:53] study the ways of God study about God
[13:56] there's nothing wrong with studying
[13:57] about God in fact everybody in the
[13:59] message does that if they're honest and
[14:00] really loves God so it's not a bad thing
[14:02] to be a theologian as long as you're
[14:04] humble with it and you're baptized with
[14:05] the Holy Ghost of course we wouldn't go
[14:07] to theological schools that' likely be a
[14:09] sin because of their false Doctrine but
[14:11] in our humble way we're theologians we
[14:13] study the ways of God we study God's
[14:15] word and then there's a little nugget at
[14:17] the end of this quote brother R says
[14:18] when you see a minister and his wife
[14:20] getting along like that the love between
[14:22] Orman Neville and his wife in sweetness
[14:24] and humbleness just makes the church go
[14:26] that much better so a loving husband and
[14:29] wife relationship between the pastor and
[14:31] his wife impacts the rest of the church
[14:33] the rest of the church sees the love
[14:35] between the pastor and his wife and they
[14:37] follow that so the pastor and his wife
[14:40] influence the people their love for each
[14:43] other influences the people to be loving
[14:44] in their marriages as well let's listen
[14:46] to the quote don't forget brother
[14:49] Neville's broadcast on Sunday or on
[14:51] Saturday at 9:00 over
[14:54] wlrp I just love to hear them don't you
[14:57] the quartet or the Trio sounds so pretty
[15:01] wife and I and the kitties we all get
[15:02] the little radio out and and hover
[15:04] around it to listen to brother Neville
[15:06] and his broadcast and his wonderful
[15:09] words of how he exalts the God that he
[15:12] loves and believes don't say this to you
[15:15] strangers here if you're having a church
[15:16] home come jar with us I tell you not
[15:19] saying this in him sitting here no sir
[15:21] I've said this many times I love brother
[15:24] Neville this first he's a theologian
[15:26] first thing he's a child of God that
[15:29] next thing he's the same every day I've
[15:32] known him for years he's never changed
[15:34] one bit he's still arm and nville a
[15:36] servant of the Lord Jesus and I think
[15:39] he's got the other night I called up to
[15:42] asked him if he didn't in his program
[15:44] could make room for us to come down pray
[15:46] for the sick this some coming in was
[15:48] this morning you know and the little
[15:50] wife answered the phone and I was
[15:52] talking to my wife back there about it
[15:54] and how we thank God for his lovely
[15:56] little wife and his family that's that's
[15:59] very fine when you see a minister and
[16:00] his wife getting along like that and
[16:02] sweetness and humbleness that just makes
[16:04] the church go that much better that's
[16:06] just sweeter as the days goes by then in
[16:09] August of 1959 brother bandam again
[16:11] talks about our dear beloved Pastor
[16:13] brother Neville he made a remark that
[16:15] went over and over in brother bram's
[16:17] mind and he just can't forget it he was
[16:18] quoting it to his other friends to see
[16:21] how one sermon from the fivefold
[16:22] ministry can cause you to reach out and
[16:23] share with other people and brother
[16:25] Neville's comment was that when God
[16:27] takes away the Holy Spirit off the Earth
[16:29] the formal Church religion will not even
[16:31] know the difference CU they currently
[16:32] don't have the spirit of God working
[16:34] with them he says wasn't that
[16:37] astounding then brother R looks at his
[16:39] own Heart Lord i' like to live in this
[16:41] life until even the least bit of his
[16:43] grieving I'll know it in my heart
[16:45] brother Ram says I want to be gone in
[16:47] the Rapture when the Lord takes his
[16:49] Spirit off the Earth let's listen to the
[16:51] quote I heard our dear beloved Pastor
[16:55] brother Neville make a remark on his
[16:58] television
[17:00] uh Radio cast the other morning that
[17:04] just went over and over in my mind I
[17:08] just can't forget
[17:10] it I quoted it to a friend of mine last
[17:15] night and that was
[17:18] this that there will after the taking
[17:23] away of the Holy Spirit out of the
[17:26] earth that far Church religion will go
[17:31] right on not knowing the
[17:34] difference did you ever did you how many
[17:36] heard
[17:38] that wasn't that
[17:41] astounding they don't know the holy
[17:43] spirit so they won't know when it's gone
[17:45] and they'll just be going right on just
[17:48] the same when the last one is sealed
[17:51] into the body of Christ they'll still be
[17:53] going on trying to bring converts to it
[17:56] because they don't know what it is
[18:00] and their formal religions will continue
[18:02] on just like they were now it may not
[18:06] sink into you like it did to me but that
[18:10] was really an astounding
[18:14] statement that they'll be so far away
[18:16] just in religious rituals until they
[18:19] will not miss the holy spirit because
[18:22] they don't know what it is to begin
[18:25] with God have mercy on us brother I'd
[18:30] like to live in this life in my desire
[18:33] till if even the least bit of his
[18:35] grieving I'll know it in my heart if I
[18:38] should do something that would grieve
[18:40] him I'd be able to feel it just in a
[18:42] moment he let alone his absence I don't
[18:45] want to be here when he's not here I
[18:48] want to be gone man yes sir for there
[18:52] will be no blood on the mercy seat it'll
[18:54] be dark and Smoky and black the
[18:57] sanctuary will have no lawyer there to
[18:59] plead our case at that time you know the
[19:02] scripture says that yes the sanctuary
[19:05] was smoking there was no blood on The
[19:08] Mercy Seat then it's judgment so we see
[19:11] brother Ram loved astounding preaching
[19:13] through brother Orman Neville then we
[19:16] fast forward to 1965 in April around
[19:19] Easter time brother brandom says brother
[19:21] Neville was still preaching on the radio
[19:23] Ministry on the resurrection this is
[19:26] from it is it is the rising of the Sun
[19:28] let's listen to the quote you know you
[19:31] perhaps have been hearing the
[19:33] radio and the different ministers
[19:36] speaking our Noble brother Neville this
[19:40] morning speaking his Easter
[19:43] subject uh on the
[19:47] resurrection
[19:49] and I thought maybe I would take it a a
[19:52] little different path not to be
[19:56] different but just to add a little more
[19:59] maybe in another
[20:02] angle that completes all the quotes that
[20:04] I have on brother Neville's radio
[20:06] Ministry but I want you to notice too in
[20:09] August of 1965 the very last sermon
[20:11] brother Brandon preached at the brandham
[20:12] Tabernacle was called Satan's Eden he
[20:15] preaches the evening service on that
[20:16] Sunday but brother Ram told us that he
[20:19] felt led of the Lord not to preach in
[20:20] the morning so he could listen to
[20:21] brother Neville so notice it's the
[20:23] prophet yielding to the pastor in the
[20:26] local church by God's leading and
[20:28] brother brandom said he got a timely
[20:30] message from the Lord so we see how a
[20:32] prophet of God could be led of the Holy
[20:33] Spirit to let the pastor preach and then
[20:36] the prophet gets a timely message that
[20:38] he knew was from the Lord that he needed
[20:39] to hear brother brandham didn't say it's
[20:42] good for brother Neville to sit down and
[20:44] just press play so this is very
[20:46] encouraging I think it's fitting brother
[20:48] bram's last sermon at Brenham Tabernacle
[20:51] was when he yielded to the Holy Spirit
[20:53] and let the pastor preach in the morning
[20:55] and the prophet preached in the evening
[20:57] you see the unity of the five full
[20:58] ministry let's listen to the quote I
[21:01] will try to be briefly tonight because I
[21:04] know many has come from different uh
[21:06] sections of the country to for the
[21:08] service or stayed over some of you and
[21:10] have to go back or maybe a way to get
[21:14] back I thank you this morning I wanted
[21:17] to hear Brother Neville myself and I
[21:19] heard him many times and never heard him
[21:21] anytime but what I appreciate him but
[21:23] this morning that timely message I know
[21:25] I had the leading of the Lord to listen
[21:27] to that this morning very fine and I see
[21:30] why you people like to come and listen
[21:32] to him also and he'll always do you good
[21:36] I'm sure to listen to him and finally I
[21:38] want to play a quote from questions and
[21:39] answers on the seals 1963 they asked
[21:41] should evangelist continue on the field
[21:43] and brother Ram said of course don't
[21:45] change a thing don't get scrupled up now
[21:49] this is referring to evangelists in the
[21:50] fivefold ministry but I want you to see
[21:52] that brother random was always telling
[21:54] the five-fold ministry don't change a
[21:55] thing and so brother Neville kept his
[21:57] radio Ministry the whole time that the
[21:59] tapes were recorded at least from 54 to
[22:01] 65 he didn't change a thing he never
[22:04] told Brother Neville just sit down and
[22:05] press play and obey the sad part is
[22:07] today the brandom Tabernacle has changed
[22:09] it brother Ram said if you change
[22:11] anything he said you'll get scrupled up
[22:13] and that's what is happened to the
[22:15] current Brenham Tabernacle they're
[22:16] scrupled up they don't even attend
[22:18] church physically how could someone not
[22:20] feel led to attend church physically
[22:22] when the Bible says we must gather more
[22:23] physically as we see that day
[22:25] approaching Hebrews chap 10: 24 and 25
[22:29] let's listen to the quote should
[22:31] evangelists continue on the
[22:34] field in this hour of course what they
[22:37] mean certainly by all means don't change
[22:40] the
[22:41] thing if Jesus is coming in the morning
[22:44] Preach Today like if it going to be 10
[22:45] years from today but live like it's
[22:47] going to be at this
[22:48] hour don't don't get scrupled up now
[22:51] that's why I'm trying to warn you about
[22:53] see just don't be odd peculiar don't
[22:56] change nothing but if you're doing
[22:58] something wrong
[22:58] are doing evil
[23:00] repent come back to God continue on your
[23:03] Evangelistic service just as you always
[23:06] did in
[23:07] closing friends hope this video was a
[23:09] blessing by the grace of God again
[23:11] emphasizing the power of the fivefold
[23:13] ministry the unity of the fivefold
[23:15] ministry how a pastor's Ministry can
[23:18] edify a prophet of God so we thank God
[23:21] for the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is
[23:22] here guiding us into all truth helping
[23:24] us not to change a thing regarding the
[23:26] fivefold ministry and everything else in
[23:28] the apostolic doctrine that the Lord
[23:31] Jesus Christ revealed to St Paul let's
[23:33] continue to pray for the fivefold
[23:34] ministry that they'll receive astounding
[23:36] Revelations from the holy ghost that
[23:38] they can preach that they'll be able to
[23:39] preach marvelous masterpieces by the
[23:42] leadership of the Holy Ghost that will
[23:43] strengthen our hearts that we want to
[23:45] share with others that will just go
[23:47] around and around in our minds helping
[23:49] us to meditate on the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:51] all the day long as the good old hymn
[23:53] says this is my story this is my song
[23:55] praising My Savior all the day long if
