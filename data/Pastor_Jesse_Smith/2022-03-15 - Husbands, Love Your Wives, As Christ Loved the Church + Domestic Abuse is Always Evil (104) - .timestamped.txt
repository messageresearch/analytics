[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:10] of the lord jesus christ
[0:12] the purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:15] viewer's question recently i was asked
[0:17] if i could teach on how husbands should
[0:20] love their wives
[0:22] i believe this was a noble and godly
[0:24] request and i wanted to make a video
[0:25] about this for the glory of god i'll be
[0:28] using scriptures quotes from brother
[0:30] branham and findings from a book called
[0:33] his needs her needs by willard harley jr
[0:36] some may criticize me for using this
[0:39] book by willard harley but i feel that's
[0:41] a great misunderstanding anyone that
[0:43] would criticize me for using a book from
[0:46] someone who doesn't believe the message
[0:48] would also have to criticize brother
[0:49] branham freezing books from people that
[0:51] didn't have his same revelation such as
[0:54] clarence larkin which brother adam used
[0:56] lots of clarence larkin's information
[0:58] and teachings when he preached the seven
[1:00] church ages and the seven seals and also
[1:03] the book how did it happen by rachel
[1:05] hazeltine which was a book brother
[1:07] branham used when he preached the seven
[1:08] church ages in 1960 and got a lot of
[1:11] helpful historical church information
[1:13] from mrs hasseltine's book
[1:17] i was reading here and a woman that
[1:19] wrote a hazelton mrs hazel and others of
[1:22] the nicene council said that she went to
[1:24] their card at the oxford to get the card
[1:27] for the um the
[1:29] life of saint uh martin and this fellow
[1:32] said but he wasn't canonized
[1:35] by the roman church certainly not he
[1:38] protested the thing
[1:40] started st patrick
[1:43] another thing
[1:45] that i'd like to read you it's found in
[1:47] the book um
[1:49] how did it happen
[1:52] and this is by the historians
[1:54] and um
[1:56] how did it happen by rc hazelton the
[1:58] history of the early churches
[2:01] and here on page 180
[2:04] the spiritual gifts
[2:06] in irena's town
[2:10] so we understand from brother branham's
[2:11] example of using books from people that
[2:13] didn't completely understand the message
[2:16] that a holy ghost filled preacher can
[2:18] read other sources outside the message
[2:20] and then rightly divide the word of
[2:21] truth or find the true information
[2:24] within outside sources and then use the
[2:27] true information not the false
[2:29] information from those sources take that
[2:32] true information and find the scriptures
[2:33] that teach that and then share it with
[2:35] god's people that was brother branham's
[2:37] example and that's how ministers should
[2:39] rightly divide the word of truth today
[2:41] so my outline is going to be very basic
[2:43] i'm going to start with scriptures and
[2:44] quotes and then at the end i'll look at
[2:46] how domestic abuse is always wicked and
[2:49] wrong
[2:50] and domestic abuse is a sign that a man
[2:53] or woman is demon-possessed
[2:56] and friends this subject is close to my
[2:58] heart over the course of my ministry
[3:00] three pastors have had me preach
[3:02] marriage banquets at their churches and
[3:04] so i've taught marriage banquets a total
[3:06] of six times and two of those pastors
[3:08] had told me that
[3:10] the reason they had me preach a marriage
[3:12] banquet at their church was because they
[3:13] saw the genuine love of jesus christ
[3:16] between my wife and i and also between
[3:18] my wife and i and our children and i'm
[3:21] not saying that to brag in any way or
[3:23] try to be prideful god knows i don't
[3:25] want any pride in my life but i'm
[3:26] sharing it so it'll help our viewers
[3:28] understand that if a family has the true
[3:31] love of jesus christ it will be
[3:33] undeniable like jesus said it will be
[3:35] like the salt of the earth the love of
[3:37] christ in a family will be like the
[3:39] light in a dark world and again as jesus
[3:41] said if you're a true disciple or
[3:43] learner from jesus christ then the whole
[3:46] world will be able to see the love of
[3:47] god in your life
[3:49] because jesus said his disciples would
[3:50] be known for their love one for another
[3:54] bible scriptures and quotes from brother
[3:56] branham i'm going to begin by going over
[3:58] some notes from a sermon i preached in
[4:00] 2009 called irresistible love my text
[4:04] was from song of solomon chapter one
[4:06] verses two through four
[4:08] and my emphasis is on the verse that
[4:10] said thy love is better than wine the
[4:13] first quote from brother branham i used
[4:15] was about family problems are caused by
[4:17] the neglect of love let's listen to this
[4:20] quote from hear ye him
[4:27] is 1957 real genuine christian right
[4:30] this place among believers
[4:35] oh there is something to do
[4:39] in your little
[4:47] she was looking for somebody to love her
[4:51] and when you promised your husband
[4:53] he was looking for somebody when he come
[4:55] in
[4:57] and weary from working all day some
[4:59] little guys that put her arms around him
[5:02] and curry said his hair
[5:05] turned out she loved him
[5:09] that's what causes separation families
[5:11] is the neglect of law
[5:14] that's what causes the separation
[5:15] churches neglect of love
[5:18] we've got to have love
[5:22] this is a beautiful quote from brother
[5:23] branham
[5:24] notice he tells us what causes
[5:26] separations and families it's a neglect
[5:29] of love
[5:30] so if you have a problem in your family
[5:31] your marriage or between the parents and
[5:33] children it's because there's a lack of
[5:35] love and christians must manifest the
[5:38] love of jesus christ to everyone in
[5:40] their family next i showed how the man
[5:42] is responsible for his household genesis
[5:45] 3 16 said eve's desire shall be to thy
[5:48] husband adam and he shall rule over thee
[5:50] so the man rules the home
[5:53] first corinthians 11 verse 3 the head of
[5:55] every man is christ and the head of the
[5:57] woman is the man
[5:59] so the man is called by god to lead the
[6:02] house but he has to lead the house in
[6:04] love
[6:05] next i use a quote from brother random
[6:06] to show how a man who doesn't lead with
[6:09] love is a weak spiritual man this quote
[6:12] is from painted face jezebel 1956 let's
[6:15] listen to the
[6:18] man i'm quote of you as christian
[6:21] brother well let your wife do such a
[6:23] thing as that it shows what you were
[6:24] made out of that's right now women you
[6:27] are to say amen
[6:29] to you i guess because he's the ruler
[6:32] that's right and the way he lets you
[6:34] it's his fault god's going to hold him
[6:36] responsible for it that's right if you
[6:38] ain't man enough to take up and touch
[6:40] your own house in order god be merciful
[6:42] to you that's right because the bible
[6:45] said in the very beginning that he shall
[6:47] rule over thee now she's not a doormat
[6:50] now she's your sweetheart see but she
[6:52] used to sit down and talk to her and
[6:53] read it with her and tell her and read
[6:55] the bible and pray together these things
[6:57] wouldn't be in the church then if you've
[6:58] done that that's
[7:00] right
[7:02] notice brother branham said god is going
[7:04] to hold the man responsible for the
[7:06] state of his household
[7:08] this statement along with the scriptures
[7:09] we've already read ought to cause
[7:11] brothers to daily seek god for god's
[7:13] leadership and god's help and god's
[7:16] strength and christ's love in order to
[7:18] rule their homes the right way as the
[7:21] scripture says let's be strong in the
[7:22] lord and the power of his might
[7:25] in this next quote notice how brother
[7:26] branham said satan works harder on the
[7:28] wife because the bible says she's the
[7:31] weaker vessel let's listen to the quote
[7:35] i guess your sweetheart came too
[7:37] i know you feel that way about her you
[7:38] feel your sweetheart and
[7:40] that's why we i know we all thus
[7:42] christians feel that way about our wives
[7:44] and they're still our sweethearts
[7:47] i hope it never changes in my family and
[7:49] never changes in your family and we
[7:51] always feel that way about our wives
[7:54] after all they stand side by side with
[7:56] us to help us fight these battles and we
[7:58] need them
[8:01] although i've said many scorching things
[8:03] to them
[8:04] but it wasn't in such a way to make them
[8:06] feel bad
[8:07] is such a way to keep them in line with
[8:09] the gospel
[8:10] and uh see that satan's tool where he
[8:13] works so hard is that with his first
[8:15] instrument he's never changed he stays
[8:16] right there
[8:18] and he's we just have to pray for our
[8:20] sisters constantly of course they pray
[8:21] for us to and together with one unit we
[8:24] march forward like an undefeated army
[8:26] with our great chief captain christ
[8:28] jesus this word going before us making a
[8:31] way for us
[8:36] so i hope the brothers gain from this
[8:38] quote that they need to pray often for
[8:40] their wives
[8:41] now please understand a holy
[8:43] ghost-filled woman is anointed she's
[8:45] more than a conqueror she has the
[8:47] baptism of the holy ghost in her soul
[8:49] but as the scripture says in first peter
[8:51] she's a weaker vessel women are
[8:53] naturally weaker physically and
[8:55] spiritually they're not made to rule the
[8:56] home so the man was built spiritually to
[8:59] lead the home and brother bran points
[9:01] out from the beginning that satan began
[9:03] working in the garden of eden on eve
[9:05] first rather than adam so we see this
[9:07] principle that satan goes after the
[9:08] weaker ones first and that should remind
[9:10] us of the scripture that says those of
[9:12] us who are strong ought to bear the
[9:14] infirmities of the weak so these
[9:16] scriptures and quotes tell us that
[9:17] brothers need to be constantly praying
[9:19] they need to have a very strong prayer
[9:21] life praying for their wives their
[9:22] families their childrens their churches
[9:25] their brothers need to be leaders by
[9:27] example with the love of jesus christ
[9:29] next i used matthew 19 verse 5 where
[9:32] jesus quoted genesis and said a man
[9:35] shall cleave to his wife and they shall
[9:38] be one flesh
[9:40] if you look this word cleave up in the
[9:42] greek it means to be glued upon to join
[9:44] oneself closely
[9:46] to stick to
[9:48] so as husbands and fathers we have to be
[9:50] initiators with our wives and our
[9:52] children we have to go talk to them in
[9:54] love we have to be glued to them we have
[9:56] to be constantly involved in their lives
[9:58] we have to do things with them in fact
[10:00] do as much as you can with your family
[10:02] because the bible says you should be
[10:04] glued to them joined to them
[10:06] you cannot let the enemy distract you
[10:08] from your first responsibility which is
[10:10] your home life and to go along with this
[10:12] i used ephesians 5 25
[10:15] husbands love your wives even as christ
[10:17] also loved the church
[10:18] and gave himself for it
[10:20] a holy ghost-filled man should seek the
[10:23] lord on how he can give of himself or
[10:25] sacrifice of his own time in order to
[10:27] serve his wife and his children and a
[10:30] man's inspiration for this is christ
[10:32] christ gave his own life in order to pay
[10:34] the penalty of his wife's sins jesus
[10:37] paid for all the sins on the cross and
[10:40] so husbands should look at christ and
[10:42] ask themselves how can i give of myself
[10:44] to serve my wife and my children the
[10:47] problem is many men are selfish today
[10:49] and they're fulfilling the wrong
[10:50] scripture first timothy 3 they're lovers
[10:53] of their own selves rather than lovers
[10:55] of god
[10:56] if men and husbands really loved god the
[10:59] husband would be glued to his wife glue
[11:01] to his children sacrificing his own
[11:03] desires and his own plans in order to
[11:05] serve his wife and serve his children
[11:08] i also pointed out some observations in
[11:10] this sermon that jesus did not wait for
[11:12] his wife to make things right before he
[11:14] reached out to her in love he didn't
[11:16] wait for the church to repent he went
[11:18] and sacrificed himself on the cross
[11:20] first for the joy that was set before
[11:22] him so brothers should do the same the
[11:24] brothers in love should go to their
[11:26] wives to make something right or their
[11:28] children to make something right
[11:30] and in jesus example he overcame
[11:32] depression to do this
[11:34] matthew 26 verses 36 through 46 and in
[11:37] particular verse 37 says jesus and began
[11:40] to be sorrowful and very heavy in the
[11:43] greek this means the strongest of the
[11:45] greek words for depression so in order
[11:48] for jesus to give himself up for the
[11:50] church he had to overcome depression
[11:52] so this encourages our brothers who are
[11:54] husbands and fathers
[11:56] to overcome any spiritual struggle or
[11:58] any spiritual obstacle you're facing in
[12:00] order to serve your wife or serve your
[12:02] children give yourself lose your own
[12:05] life and then you'll find your life as
[12:07] jesus christ also said that's a true
[12:09] follower of christ someone who takes up
[12:11] their cross daily and lives for others
[12:14] rather than living for themselves
[12:16] and here's a quote from brother branham
[12:17] that says christ loved us so much that
[12:20] he took everything on his shoulders when
[12:22] he went to the cross so in other words
[12:24] love will make us carry a burden so if a
[12:27] brother has a burden in his family he
[12:29] needs to be like christ and let love
[12:32] motivate him to overcome the problem or
[12:34] the obstacle in the family with love
[12:37] let's listen to the
[12:40] [Music]
[12:51] the quote of all the world
[12:54] the healing ministry that we have in the
[12:55] world today rested on his shoulders
[12:59] the healing of congressman upshaw
[13:01] resting on his shoulders
[13:03] the healing of my blind eyes
[13:19] and again it's all about love here's a
[13:21] quote where brother brahm talks about
[13:22] how the garden of gethsemane was a
[13:24] conference and the holy spirit asked
[13:26] jesus do you love them enough to go to
[13:28] the cross let's listen to the quote
[13:31] but now the father said are you willing
[13:36] is your love for your brethren great
[13:38] enough
[13:40] is your love for that sinful staking
[13:43] world that you were born in
[13:46] do you love them enough
[13:48] to forfeit your life
[13:51] do you love them enough to take their
[13:53] place to bear their sins to the hardest
[13:56] crucial death you
[13:58] there could be nothing die that kind of
[14:00] death but him
[14:03] and in that conference
[14:05] such a decision
[14:07] was made until blood got to his brow
[14:13] he was under a strain the sins of the
[14:17] world was upon him
[14:20] and then he looked into the face of the
[14:22] dub and said
[14:24] it's not my will
[14:26] but thy will be done
[14:30] so brothers let's ask ourselves that
[14:32] question do we love our wife enough to
[14:34] be glued to her to be joined to her to
[14:37] be constantly concerned about her
[14:38] spiritual welfare brothers let's ask
[14:41] ourselves do we love our children enough
[14:42] to be glued to them to spend time with
[14:44] them and to care about their spiritual
[14:46] welfare rather than be distracted with
[14:49] our personal wants and desires and hopes
[14:51] and goals
[14:52] next i'm going to share some bible
[14:54] principles i preach from a sermon also
[14:56] from 2009 called espoused to christ and
[15:00] after i preached this as a guest
[15:02] preacher at another church numerous
[15:04] couples came up to the altar repenting
[15:06] and seeking restitution for their
[15:07] marriage
[15:08] one important question i asked was why
[15:11] do people fall in love during courtship
[15:14] i got this thought from
[15:15] from willard harley's book his needs her
[15:17] needs which i've already referenced he
[15:19] said they marry because they've enjoyed
[15:21] what happened during the courtship so
[15:23] much that they want it to continue for
[15:25] life brother branham also gave us this
[15:27] principle let's listen to this quote
[15:29] from time tested memorials of god where
[15:31] brother ram tells us to always be
[15:33] sweethearts in other words the way you
[15:35] treated each other at the beginning of
[15:36] the relationship should continue for the
[15:39] rest of the relationship if not the
[15:41] couple has left their first love they've
[15:43] backslidden from their original
[15:44] condition and need to repent and go back
[15:46] and do the first works
[15:48] let's listen to the quote
[15:52] a man losing their affections for their
[15:54] wife and don't uh love them as they did
[15:57] when they were sweetheart shame on you
[16:00] you ought to do it she's always your
[16:02] sweetheart absolutely that's the part
[16:04] she should be
[16:06] and you should treat her like that oh
[16:08] never let that little honeymoon cease
[16:12] because it isn't going to in heaven
[16:14] you're going to be just perfectly warm
[16:16] there that's why it's all
[16:18] well looks like some women ought to say
[16:20] amen to them
[16:24] [Music]
[16:26] why didn't you say something or somebody
[16:27] back there
[16:29] did you thank you sister that's very
[16:31] good brother cox that's for you
[16:33] everywhere you are you know
[16:34] all right yes sir and we should never
[16:37] forget to honor each other always be
[16:40] sweethearts never let it cease
[16:44] so notice brothers we cannot lose our
[16:46] affection for our wives brothers you
[16:49] have to love your wife as you did at the
[16:51] beginning and brother braham said shame
[16:53] on you brothers if you don't love your
[16:55] wife as you did at the beginning
[16:57] and brothers remember that's your
[16:59] responsibility to keep your first love
[17:01] in your marriage and also your
[17:02] relationship with christ
[17:04] god made you the leader and so god has
[17:06] equipped you as you seek god's face and
[17:09] his continual anointing of the holy
[17:10] ghost to keep the love alive in your
[17:13] marriage and also the love between you
[17:15] and your children
[17:17] now a beautiful point that harley
[17:18] brought out in his book is that is that
[17:20] men and women each have five needs that
[17:23] they need to meet again i have to
[17:24] rightly divide this and i found that all
[17:26] five of these are in scripture now for
[17:29] the sake of this video i'm just going to
[17:30] go over the needs of the wife because
[17:33] this video is focusing on how husbands
[17:35] should love their wives
[17:37] so after thousands of interviews dr
[17:39] harley did with married couples
[17:42] through counseling he found that these
[17:44] are the five needs of a wife that a
[17:46] husband needs to meet and all of them
[17:49] can be backed up by scripture
[17:51] the first is she needs family commitment
[17:53] and we see this in genesis 18 verses 17
[17:57] through 19.
[17:58] these scriptures show how abraham was
[18:00] committed to his family god said i know
[18:02] abraham he'll command his children and
[18:04] his household after him and they shall
[18:06] keep the way of the lord and to do
[18:08] justice and judgment
[18:10] so notice abraham as the man the ruler
[18:12] of the home was going to teach his
[18:14] children and his family how to keep the
[18:16] way of the lord that wasn't sarah's job
[18:18] that was abraham's job and that's the
[18:20] commitment that every christian wife
[18:22] needs she needs a husband that's going
[18:24] to lead the children into keeping the
[18:26] ways of the lord second the wife needs
[18:29] financial support this is taught in 1st
[18:31] thessalonians 3 10 and 1st timothy 5
[18:34] verse 8.
[18:35] men need to be hard workers in fact
[18:38] brother branham said the christian is
[18:39] the one that will work hard lazy men of
[18:42] course are not born again
[18:43] likely not even saved only god knows but
[18:46] the bible says a man that's fervent in
[18:48] the holy spirit will also be fervent in
[18:51] his business
[18:52] a third need for the wives is honesty
[18:55] and openness according to hebrews 13 18
[18:58] and 1st timothy 2 verse 2
[19:00] wives really need to know what the
[19:02] husband
[19:03] is thinking planning and feeling
[19:06] husbands should not hide things from
[19:07] their wives
[19:09] husbands should not be dishonest but
[19:11] always honest
[19:12] hebrews 13 18 says that we do all things
[19:16] willing to live honestly
[19:18] many marriage problems are caused when
[19:20] men
[19:21] are dishonest with their wives either
[19:23] through a lie
[19:24] or just withholding the truth from their
[19:26] wives
[19:27] in 1st timothy 2 verse 2 it says we
[19:30] should lead a quiet and peaceable life
[19:32] in all godliness and honesty
[19:34] so there's no room for dishonesty in a
[19:36] marriage
[19:37] the bible commands us to have all
[19:39] honesty so if a husband is lied
[19:42] or withheld truth he needs to repent of
[19:44] that say he's sorry and seek god's power
[19:47] to not do that again
[19:49] the fourth need is conversation and this
[19:52] is found in song of solomon 2 verse 14.
[19:56] the scripture says o my dove that art in
[19:59] the clefs of the rock in the secret
[20:01] places of the stairs let me see thy
[20:03] countenance let me hear thy voice for
[20:06] sweet as thy voice and that countenance
[20:08] is comely
[20:10] so we see from the scripture that
[20:12] solomon and the shulamite enjoyed having
[20:14] conversation they wanted to hear each
[20:16] other's voice they wanted to talk and
[20:18] have fellowship today we might call it
[20:21] connecting a good husband will want to
[20:23] connect with his wife talk about the day
[20:26] talk about the family
[20:27] talk about the future
[20:29] talk about lots of things and a husband
[20:31] should be willing to do that
[20:33] you know some sisters are with their
[20:34] children all day
[20:36] and maybe the first time they get to
[20:37] talk to an adult all day is when her
[20:40] husband comes home
[20:41] so brothers we need to see that that's
[20:42] our responsibility we're to be glued to
[20:44] our wives i know in my home i like to
[20:46] come home from work and like to spend a
[20:48] few minutes talking with my wife having
[20:50] conversation
[20:51] and i do that because i know the
[20:52] scripture says that here in song of
[20:54] solomon but also in 1st peter 3 where
[20:57] the bible tells husbands to dwell with
[20:59] their wives according to knowledge that
[21:01] means a deep christian understanding of
[21:03] their wives needs
[21:05] and also in my marriage i build it into
[21:07] my schedule where i can spend at least
[21:09] one time a week taking my wife out on a
[21:11] date in order to talk to her
[21:13] have this conversation and of course
[21:15] just having this date time helps to meet
[21:18] some of the other needs that she has
[21:19] such as
[21:20] honesty and openness and this leads into
[21:23] the next need she has is affection
[21:26] so the fifth need is affection and this
[21:28] is found in romans 12 10 first
[21:30] corinthians 7 3 and 2 samuel 12
[21:33] 24.
[21:35] romans 12 10 says be kindly affection
[21:37] one to another with brotherly love in
[21:40] honor preferring one another
[21:42] so affection means loving tenderly so
[21:45] this is tenderness
[21:47] all christians should be tender with
[21:49] each other and especially husbands
[21:51] should be tender with their wives and
[21:52] tender with their children and this
[21:54] means showing honor not dishonor not
[21:57] disrespect but loving respect and again
[22:01] preferring one another the man must
[22:03] place the needs of his wife and children
[22:05] above his own just like christ did first
[22:07] corinthians 7 3 says let the husband
[22:09] render unto the wife do benevolence and
[22:12] likewise also the wife unto her husband
[22:15] benevolence means kindness or goodwill
[22:18] all things a husband does for his wife
[22:20] should be done in good will and kindness
[22:24] we see this also when david comforted
[22:26] his wife bathsheba after the death of
[22:29] their first son
[22:30] he showed her comfort
[22:32] which means moved with pity to have
[22:34] compassion
[22:36] to ease her burdens
[22:37] so if a husband meets all these five
[22:39] needs of his wife then it's undeniable
[22:42] that he'll be fulfilling his role as
[22:44] leader of his wife and children leading
[22:47] with the love of jesus christ and if he
[22:49] leads like this in love the problems in
[22:51] the home will be greatly decreased
[22:54] because he's choosing to not neglect
[22:56] love for his wife and his children
[22:59] before moving on i do want to read the
[23:01] five needs that a man has
[23:03] that his wife should try to meet
[23:05] first recreational companionship
[23:08] second physical intimacy
[23:10] third admiration or respect
[23:13] fourth domestic support
[23:15] and fifth
[23:16] he needs an attractive spouse
[23:19] so again i highly recommend this book
[23:21] his needs her needs remember the author
[23:23] is not a message believer but if someone
[23:25] has the holy ghost like brother branham
[23:27] said you have a buzzer in your soul or
[23:29] you have discernment in your soul
[23:31] when you read something that's not
[23:33] scriptural you just get rid of it you
[23:34] don't pay attention to it but when you
[23:37] see something that's scriptural you can
[23:38] take that and apply it to your own life
[23:41] and become a more humble obedient
[23:43] christian
[23:44] having that discernment is what brother
[23:46] branham called having the thinking man's
[23:47] filter
[23:48] the filter for everything we see read
[23:51] and come in contact with is the word of
[23:53] god and the spirit of that word the holy
[23:55] ghost baptism is in our souls so we have
[23:58] a thinking man's filter built into our
[24:00] souls
[24:01] and remember brothers god is going to
[24:03] help you love your wife and children
[24:05] because the bible said god's favors upon
[24:07] the married proverbs 18 22 whosoever a
[24:11] wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth
[24:13] the favor of the lord
[24:15] when you're married in christian
[24:16] marriage you've got god's favor you have
[24:18] his grace and so you maintain that by
[24:20] constantly seeking the face of god
[24:22] repenting of your sins and trying to
[24:24] grow in the grace and knowledge of the
[24:25] lord becoming a better husband and a
[24:27] better father to your children
[24:30] also proverbs 19 14 says houses and
[24:32] riches are the inheritance of fathers
[24:34] and a prudent wife is from the lord
[24:37] one note i had from a sermon was how
[24:40] husbands love in marriage so to
[24:42] summarize
[24:43] husbands are called to active willing
[24:45] and complete self-sacrifice
[24:48] for his wife's benefit and that's from
[24:50] ephesians 5 where christ modeled that he
[24:53] gave himself
[24:54] for the church his wife
[24:57] second husbands are called to love and
[25:00] cherish them and cherish in the greek
[25:02] means to keep warm with tender love
[25:04] according to 1st thessalonians 2 verse 7
[25:07] and also called to nourish which means
[25:09] nurture or bring up his wife and his
[25:12] children according to ephesians 6 verse
[25:14] 4
[25:15] this love of jesus christ coming out of
[25:17] the husband's soul will produce
[25:19] sanctification by the word for the
[25:22] purpose of holiness
[25:24] here's some more quotes from god's
[25:25] prophet brother branham in this first
[25:27] one again from time tested memorials of
[25:29] god 1957 brother branham corrected a
[25:32] catholic boy the catholic man was
[25:34] married and he tried to tell brother
[25:36] branham that he didn't have to kiss and
[25:38] hug his wife and brother brahm said
[25:40] whoop wait a minute boy you're wrong
[25:42] let's listen to the quote
[25:45] catholic boy come to me not long ago his
[25:47] wife was separating said billy i hate to
[25:49] come to you i'm a catholic you're a
[25:51] protestant said to preach from me i'm a
[25:52] home while ago
[25:54] and i said what's the matter him he said
[25:56] well he told me he said i drink a little
[25:58] and said
[25:59] of a night i'll work hard and say my
[26:01] wife thinks i ought to come in every
[26:02] night and kiss her and hug her and make
[26:04] me laugh just like if we fixing to get
[26:06] married so we married got a bunch of
[26:08] kids and said we that's time i said
[26:10] whoop wait a minute boy you're wrong
[26:13] you're wrong that's just the same as it
[26:15] was before you're married see you must
[26:17] always remember i said she's 40 years
[26:19] old now at the time where she really
[26:21] needs your attention
[26:24] so see friends this quote supports the
[26:26] fact that women have a need for
[26:27] affection holding hands hugging kissing
[26:31] these are important needs god has
[26:32] already built into the woman that the
[26:34] husband has to meet so again so the
[26:37] husband cannot leave his first love and
[26:39] not give his wife the affection that she
[26:41] needs the wife needs the husband to
[26:43] treat her the same way he did before
[26:45] they got married and also when they
[26:47] started their marriage he has to keep
[26:49] the honeymoon relationship alive
[26:52] in the same sermon from 1957 brother
[26:54] brahm talked about how a couple was
[26:56] going to be divorced but through his
[26:58] counsel and through his prayer the
[26:59] couple repented of their divorce and
[27:01] came back together and brother branham
[27:03] gave the credit to the restoration of
[27:05] the marriage to love
[27:07] he says love conquers everything let's
[27:09] listen to the quote
[27:12] love conquers everything
[27:15] this is love
[27:16] you can have all your signs and
[27:18] evidences and just giving love
[27:20] that settles it for me
[27:23] oh
[27:23] my
[27:27] in the next quote brother branham is
[27:28] saying god never respects you for what
[27:30] you were but what you currently are so
[27:33] husbands we should ask ourselves how
[27:35] good of a husband are you right now it's
[27:38] from question answers on the seals 63.
[27:40] let's listen to the quote
[27:42] this nation is living off of a past
[27:45] reputation
[27:46] of what the forefathers was
[27:48] see and that's really think we'll be
[27:50] safe god never respected israel on what
[27:52] they was what they had been what they
[27:54] was then
[27:57] in the next quote brother branham says
[27:58] are you willing to learn this is a great
[28:01] problem i see amongst message people
[28:03] they start out on fire or excited
[28:06] enthusiastic about the message they're
[28:08] joyful but as time goes on they're
[28:10] deceived of the enemy they lose their
[28:12] joy they lose their enthusiasm and this
[28:14] especially happens in marriages men get
[28:16] to a spot where they don't want to learn
[28:18] how to love their wives better in this
[28:20] quote brother ram compares a person who
[28:22] won't learn to a donkey so we can't be
[28:24] spiritual donkeys we have to be
[28:26] spiritual pedigrees as brother ram said
[28:28] as well let's listen to the quote
[28:33] a mule is the most dumbest thing i know
[28:36] of no matter what you ever do you can't
[28:38] teach him anything
[28:40] why he's a hybrid
[28:42] that's all you you're never learning
[28:45] nothing or teach him anything
[28:48] you just sit there you can call him he
[28:50] has no affections
[28:52] you'll stand there with his ears out
[28:54] oh
[28:56] he don't know
[29:01] and here's another quote from
[29:02] perseverance that speaks the same truth
[29:04] what have we been taught lately it's
[29:06] from 1962 let's listen to the quote
[29:11] but i immune he's dumb you know you can
[29:14] just talk to him and he'll wait all his
[29:16] life to get kicked before he dies and he
[29:19] you can tell him you can't teach him
[29:21] nothing he's hard-headed you can try to
[29:23] be gentle to him he'll stick sticking
[29:25] his ears out snowing
[29:26] oh
[29:27] days of miracles his past
[29:29] there's no such thing with that
[29:32] brain
[29:33] but a good third
[29:35] red pedigreed horse and his teach him
[29:38] anything he knows who his pappy is who
[29:40] his man he is who his great-grandfather
[29:42] and great-grandmother he knows the
[29:44] history all the way back and so is where
[29:46] the good petty green christian is born
[29:49] of the holy ghost you don't have to say
[29:51] i was met with this baptist i had
[29:52] changed the press for jordan luther he
[29:54] was born
[29:56] by the holy ghost into the family
[29:57] begotten of pedigree runs from the
[29:59] pentecostals
[30:03] amen
[30:04] i like that inoculation
[30:09] so some things to consider we must be
[30:11] willing to relearn how we loved at the
[30:13] beginning and also try to love again
[30:16] brothers we must be willing to humble
[30:17] ourselves repent for the wrongs we've
[30:19] done and accept christ's power to not
[30:21] commit that wrong again and we must
[30:24] consider this question
[30:26] what have we learned lately about our
[30:27] spouses or ourselves
[30:29] we must take what we've learned
[30:31] and apply it to our lives and become a
[30:34] better husband and a better father to
[30:35] our children
[30:37] now you might ask yourself how can one
[30:39] man do all of that
[30:41] the answer is he has to stretch because
[30:43] he's the husband
[30:45] now if you look in easton bible's
[30:46] dictionary
[30:47] the word husband comes from the words
[30:50] house band
[30:51] in other words the husband connects and
[30:53] keeps together the whole family the
[30:56] husband's like a rubber band and he's
[30:57] got to stretch in order to handle and
[31:00] cover
[31:01] and hold all the needs of his wife and
[31:03] the children
[31:04] so husbands keep that in mind you are
[31:06] the husband you're the house band
[31:08] you've got to pray seek the holy ghost
[31:11] for every situation
[31:12] and your prayers must wrap around the
[31:14] needs of your wife and your children
[31:17] you must accept this role because it's
[31:19] god's role to you as leader you have
[31:22] more responsibility than your wife and
[31:23] children god's going to hold you
[31:25] responsible for your family so by the
[31:27] love of the holy ghost and power of god
[31:30] you've got to hold your family together
[31:32] hold them up in prayer before the lord
[31:34] and jesus says if you ask you shall
[31:36] receive if you seek you shall find if
[31:39] you knock the door will be opened unto
[31:40] you
[31:42] responsibility is for a real man the
[31:44] real man connects to each person in the
[31:46] house he loses sight of his worldly
[31:48] desires and focuses on the spiritual
[31:50] needs of the family
[31:51] through his example in teaching all
[31:54] other house members grow and change for
[31:55] the better
[31:56] god the father is the best example for
[31:58] all men desiring to be more responsible
[32:01] with their wives and children he's the
[32:03] perfect father the husband must know
[32:05] he's going to be stretched he must bend
[32:07] but not break he must not compromise on
[32:09] the word of god the husband's material
[32:12] is stronger than the woman's as she's
[32:13] the weaker vessel the bible says this in
[32:16] first peter 3 7 likewise you husbands
[32:18] dwell with them according to knowledge
[32:20] giving honor unto the wife as unto the
[32:22] weaker vessel and as being heirs
[32:24] together of the grace of life that your
[32:26] prayers be not hindered
[32:28] husbands are ultimately responsible for
[32:30] teaching their households and the
[32:31] spiritual conditions of the wives and
[32:33] children
[32:34] husbands are told not to discourage or
[32:37] bring their children to wrath which is a
[32:38] spiritual condition
[32:40] when a husband obeys ephesians 5 and
[32:42] loves his wife with christ's love her
[32:45] spiritual state will be greatly improved
[32:46] as well because love works by faith a
[32:50] husband's love upon his wife will
[32:51] motivate her to love her children better
[32:53] her faith in christ will be stronger the
[32:55] children will learn from an early age to
[32:57] have faith in god and to love god and
[32:59] repent of their sins and be baptized at
[33:01] young ages
[33:03] remember god told moses to tell israel
[33:05] to teach your children diligently
[33:07] deuteronomy 6 verses 7 through 9 and
[33:10] thou shalt teach them diligently unto
[33:12] thy children and shalt talk of them when
[33:14] thou sittest in thine house and when
[33:16] thou walk us by the way and when thou
[33:18] liest down and when thou rise us up and
[33:20] thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
[33:22] thine hand and they shall be as
[33:24] frontlets between thine eyes and thou
[33:26] shall write them upon the posts of thy
[33:27] house and on thy gates
[33:30] one more personal thought brothers how
[33:33] well you love your wife shows how much
[33:35] you love god christ's love for us drove
[33:38] him to the greatest self-sacrifice the
[33:39] world ever saw the cross
[33:42] christ laid down his life for the joy
[33:43] that was set before him as he died for
[33:45] sinners but he also died because of his
[33:48] submission and trust in the father's
[33:49] will he said not my will but thine be
[33:52] done and as jesus told peter peter's
[33:55] love for jesus was measured by his love
[33:58] for others
[33:59] john 21 17 he saith unto him the third
[34:02] time simon son of jonas loveth thou me
[34:04] peter was grieved because he said unto
[34:06] him the third time lovest thou me and he
[34:08] said unto him lord thou knowest all
[34:09] things now notice that i love thee jesus
[34:12] saith unto him feed my sheep so husbands
[34:15] your love for jesus my love for jesus
[34:17] will be measured and also seen by how we
[34:20] take care of our wives and take care of
[34:22] our children
[34:23] we should care for them with love we
[34:25] should care for them in humility and
[34:27] then others will know that we truly love
[34:29] jesus christ
[34:31] domestic violence is always evil wicked
[34:34] and wrong
[34:35] over the years i've got numerous emails
[34:37] from brothers and sisters who've
[34:39] experienced domestic violence let me
[34:41] clearly say that all christians should
[34:43] always condemn all forms of domestic
[34:46] violence
[34:47] a man should never hurt his wife or
[34:49] children
[34:50] behaviors like hitting beating dragging
[34:52] wounding are all signs of demonic
[34:54] possession a holy ghost-filled christian
[34:56] is filled with god's love not satan's
[34:59] hatred
[35:00] this is easily seen in acts 19.
[35:02] acts 19 verses 14 through 16 speaks of
[35:05] the seven sons of skeva when the seven
[35:08] sons of skiva tried to cast out a demon
[35:10] in jesus name but they didn't have the
[35:12] faith and authority like paul had and
[35:15] the bible said the man in whom the
[35:17] demons were leaped upon them and wounded
[35:19] them and those seven sons were beaten
[35:21] and wounded and they left the place
[35:23] naked
[35:24] we see those same demon powers today
[35:26] any husband that wounds his wife or
[35:28] children is demon-possessed
[35:31] again colossians 3 19 says husbands love
[35:33] your wives and be not bitter against
[35:35] them
[35:36] ephesians 5 25 husbands love your wives
[35:39] even as christ also loved the church and
[35:41] gave himself for it
[35:43] here's some quotes from brother branham
[35:45] the first one brother bram says men do
[35:47] not have no right to beat their wives
[35:50] drag them around or do any of those
[35:52] things
[35:53] brother brown said she should always be
[35:54] your sweetheart
[35:56] in the next quote brother brown said
[35:57] your wife is not your doormat she's your
[35:59] sweetheart let's listen to the quote
[36:03] a man's not supposed to use that
[36:05] authority over a woman just because he's
[36:07] her ruler god is her ruler above you
[36:09] brother see
[36:11] and if your wife is doing something
[36:13] wrong then going to now you can we got a
[36:15] right to tell her she's supposed to
[36:16] listen to you but you haven't got no
[36:18] right to beat her or drag her around or
[36:20] do those things no
[36:21] god made man a helpmate not a doormat
[36:25] remember
[36:26] she she was your sweetheart she should
[36:28] always be that
[36:32] in the next quote brother brahm says if
[36:33] you love your wife you wouldn't hurt her
[36:35] if you love your children you wouldn't
[36:36] want to do anything wrong to them let's
[36:38] listen to the quote
[36:41] you wouldn't hurt your little baby you'd
[36:42] hate to do that you'd hate to hurt the
[36:44] feelings of your wife or your husband
[36:47] how much more your lord and savior would
[36:49] you if you love him if you lost your
[36:51] wife you wouldn't hurt her if you love
[36:53] your children you wouldn't want to do
[36:54] anything wrong to them and how about
[36:56] your heavenly father
[37:00] in closing
[37:02] i hope this video was a blessing friends
[37:04] i felt led of the holy spirit i felt a
[37:06] burden on my heart to be able to give
[37:08] some scriptural guidance for our
[37:10] husbands
[37:11] that they will follow the example of
[37:12] jesus christ and love their wife and
[37:15] love their children as christ loved the
[37:17] church and gave himself for it
[37:19] the divine love of jesus christ is the
[37:21] answer to every domestic problem
[37:25] no family is going to be perfect and
[37:26] never have problems but the bible said
[37:28] when a christian is born again of the
[37:30] holy ghost he reigns in life by jesus
[37:33] christ
[37:34] so men that are truly baptized with the
[37:36] holy ghost will rule by the power of the
[37:38] holy ghost and they'll rule by love and
[37:41] the man will love his wife as christ
[37:43] love the church and love his children
[37:45] with tender affectionate compassionate
[37:47] christian love
[37:48] friends jesus christ does not want wives
[37:51] abused or children abused abuse is the
[37:54] work of satan and anyone that's been
[37:56] abused has to go to the proper
[37:58] authorities
[38:00] demon-possessed people if they won't
[38:02] repent will only keep doing the same
[38:04] cycle of abuse over and over again
[38:07] jesus wants his people to have a haven
[38:09] of rest the christian home should be a
[38:11] sanctuary of love and peace
[38:13] and if it's not then repentance has to
[38:15] take place
[38:16] and in many cases it's the fault of the
[38:18] husband so if you're having domestic
[38:20] trouble pray sincerely contact the
[38:23] proper authorities for help
[38:25] using the wisdom of the holy ghost
[38:27] and then know that jesus christ will
[38:28] bring healing to your life for he is the
[38:31] god who heals
