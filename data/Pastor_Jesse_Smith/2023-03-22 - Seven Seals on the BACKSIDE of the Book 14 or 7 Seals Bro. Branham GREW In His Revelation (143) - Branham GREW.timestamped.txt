[0:07] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:12] the purpose of this video is to show
[0:14] that God's Prophet brother William
[0:16] Branham grew in his Revelation on his
[0:18] understanding on the Seven Seals
[0:21] especially Revelation chapter 5 verse 1
[0:24] which says
[0:26] and I saw on the right hand of him that
[0:28] sat on the throne a book written within
[0:30] and on the backside sealed with Seven
[0:33] Seals
[0:34] by God's grace we'll see that God's
[0:36] Prophet at one time thought there were
[0:38] seven seals inside the book and also on
[0:41] the outside of the book but then three
[0:44] years later the Holy Spirit corrected
[0:45] him and then brother Branham came to
[0:47] understand that the revelation of the
[0:49] Seven Seals cannot be outside the Bible
[0:52] the revelation of the Seven Seals has to
[0:54] be in the Bible
[0:55] so we'll start by listening to the
[0:57] quotes and then we'll end this short
[0:59] video with a few lessons that we can
[1:00] learn and I hope it'll be a blessing to
[1:02] you by God's grace
[1:04] I'll begin with two quotes the first
[1:05] quote is from June 11 1961 Revelation
[1:09] chapter 5 part one and brother Branham
[1:12] says the revelation of the Seven Seals
[1:14] is sealed on the back side of the book
[1:16] not written Within
[1:18] and then brother Ram says Christ the
[1:20] lamb is the only one that can reveal
[1:21] those seven Mysteries out
[1:24] let's listen to the quote
[1:32] [Music]
[1:43] so this is
[1:49] [Music]
[1:54] [Music]
[1:57] reveal
[1:59] [Music]
[2:05] Ed next a year and a half later in 1962
[2:08] December 30th is this the sign of the
[2:10] end sir brother Branham speaks a little
[2:13] more about this subject and says there
[2:15] are seven other seals that's on the back
[2:17] side of the book it's outside the Bible
[2:20] so here brother makes it sound like
[2:22] there's Seven Seals in the book and then
[2:24] there's seven seals on the outside of
[2:26] the book let's listen to the quote if
[2:29] there's seven other seals that's on the
[2:31] back side of the boat
[2:33] outside the Bible
[2:41] [Music]
[2:44] this is
[2:45] [Music]
[2:53] not revealed
[2:55] it's not even written in the bill
[2:58] then friends three years later in
[3:01] spiritual food and due season July 1965
[3:04] while talking about the Seven Seals
[3:06] brother Branham says he always thought
[3:08] there were seals on the backside of the
[3:11] book and it wasn't something written in
[3:13] this heavenly book he says but then it
[3:15] turned out God cannot do that the
[3:18] revelation of the Seven Seals has to be
[3:20] something that's written in this
[3:22] heavenly book and then he quotes
[3:23] revelation 22 verses 18 to 19 that say
[3:26] not one word can be added to the book
[3:29] and therefore the mystery of God is
[3:31] already contained within the Holy Bible
[3:33] the book of redemption let's listen to
[3:35] the quote
[3:52] [Music]
[3:59] [Music]
[4:02] a mystery all about water baptism these
[4:06] other things that the
[4:07] salon
[4:10] so friends we can gain at least four
[4:12] lessons from these quotes
[4:14] the first lesson is that this is proof
[4:16] brother random had the baptism of the
[4:18] Holy Ghost because he could be guided
[4:20] into all truth according to John 16
[4:23] verse 13.
[4:24] although brother random was wrong about
[4:26] Seven Seals being on the back side of
[4:28] the book the holy ghost did not let him
[4:31] start a 14 seals Dogma or a 14 seals
[4:35] camp that had teachings outside the Holy
[4:37] Bible
[4:39] brand did not start a different gospel
[4:41] he preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[4:43] a second lesson is that this proves
[4:46] Jefferson Bill and the Bradham
[4:48] Tabernacle are wrong again of course not
[4:51] every word on tape is thus saith the
[4:53] Lord the two quotes that we heard at the
[4:55] beginning from 1961 and 1962 were not
[4:57] thus saith the Lord there are not Seven
[5:00] Seals on the back side of the book and
[5:02] of course this video supports that
[5:04] three-part series I made called 60 plus
[5:06] proofs not every word on tape was thus
[5:09] say the Lord and now Friends by God's
[5:11] grace I'm almost up to 80 proofs that
[5:14] not every word on the tapes are thus say
[5:16] the Lord so perhaps Lord willing in the
[5:19] future I'll make another video on that
[5:20] if God is willing and Friends those
[5:23] videos strengthen the faith of real
[5:24] Believers like myself and others that
[5:27] realize brother random was human and
[5:29] he's not to be worshiped and the tapes
[5:31] are not to be worshiped either the tapes
[5:33] point us to the absolute the Bible
[5:35] a third lesson is that we must prove all
[5:38] things we must take every quote brother
[5:39] random said back to the word and of
[5:41] course every quote from a preacher that
[5:43] we hear even today
[5:45] and this is what brother Ram taught us
[5:46] in 1963 he cares do you care he said
[5:49] I've always asked you to be careful when
[5:51] you're listening to him he said because
[5:52] there's so much of it that's the Human
[5:54] Side so it's a great lesson that we
[5:57] almost learn we can't get lazy we've got
[5:59] to continually prove all things we've
[6:00] got to go back to the scripture and make
[6:02] sure what we believe is found in the
[6:04] word of God
[6:05] and a fourth and final lesson is that no
[6:08] matter how emotional brother Brenda may
[6:09] sound in a quote it doesn't mean what
[6:12] he's saying is thus saith the Lord like
[6:14] with this example
[6:15] no matter how enthused brother random is
[6:17] how excited he may seem we've still got
[6:20] to take every quote he said back to the
[6:21] word of God a couple examples are like
[6:23] the quotes about 1977 brother brand was
[6:26] very emotional thinking total
[6:27] Annihilation would come before 1977 and
[6:30] of course it didn't that was just a
[6:32] human prediction brother Ram is still a
[6:34] prophet of God
[6:35] another example is brother Branch
[6:37] predictions about Martin Luther King Jr
[6:39] leading Millions into a death trap and
[6:41] causing another race war of course those
[6:43] were just his own opinions as he told us
[6:45] brother Ram said he had nothing on it
[6:47] from the Lord that was just his opinion
[6:49] as followers of God's Prophet we have to
[6:51] look for both Bible evidence and the
[6:54] words of brother Branham saying thus
[6:55] saith the Lord to know that some future
[6:58] prediction or prophecy is from the Lord
[7:00] just as brother Ram taught us and he
[7:02] cares do you care in 1963. so friends we
[7:05] rejoice in the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[7:07] is still here
[7:08] he still seals our souls the Holy Ghost
[7:10] is the dissolver of doubts he's the
[7:13] spirit of truth that's with us today
[7:14] he's the one that leads and guides us
[7:16] today into all truth he helps us rightly
[7:19] divide the word of Truth
