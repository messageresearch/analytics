TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] On July 5th, 1964, God's prophet William Brandham preached the sermon called the masterpiece. Sermon was over 2 hours and 17 minutes long. After talking and doing introductions for the first 13 minutes, Brother Random took his text in Isaiah 53 and read the entire chapter. The foundation of brother Ram's sermon called the masterpiece is Jesus Christ. His life, death, burial, and resurrection. Jesus Christ is the masterpiece of God. William Brandham preached on his inspiration on where he got this thought. He showed he got it from Michelangelo's sculpture of Moses finished around 1513 or 1515. Brother Ram said, "What made this a masterpiece was when the vision in Michelangelo's mind became a reality and then he smoked his masterpiece and commanded it to speak." For over an hour and 10 minutes, Brother Random preached on how Michelangelo's masterpiece was like God's masterpiece. When he sent his only begotten son, the Lord Jesus Christ, God Almighty told the son to speak on Mount Transfiguration. Then he was smitten on Calvary. In Michelangelo's story, he finished the sculpture, told it to speak, and then smote it. So, Brother Ram drew this parallel for over an hour and 10 minutes. And then about the hour and 22 mark, Brother Ram makes this statement and says, "I'm going to share with you, brethren, and especially the Pentecostals, my masterpiece." Now, Pentecostal brethren throughout the nations, I want you to listen, my brother, if this is the last message I'll ever preach. This is my masterpiece. When I heard this, I was pleasantly surprised. I've listened to the sermon before, but I never caught this thought about brother Brandham's own masterpiece. I was listening attentively. What was Brother Brandham's masterpiece? For around the next 30 minutes, Brother Ram showed how the wheat plant, its cycle of life, death, burial, and resurrection was his masterpiece. And it included at least five major Bible revelations. The first revelation he talked about, and these are in no particular order, are the anointed ones at the end time from Matthew 24:4. Brother Brham made the observation that the chaff was very similar and very close to the original seed, but it wasn't. So, brother Ram noted how this was like the Pentecostal movement. It was so close when the Holy Ghost fell to Isuza Street, but they eventually got off the word and denominated. They had the right anointing at first, but then they brought in false doctrines. What's nature? Nature exactly is God. God working in nature is all he can. But from the Pentecostal revival as they think was the seed, it wasn't. Now watch. But something come forth just like the seed. And watch what Jesus said in St. Matthew 24:24. That the two spirits at the last days would be so close together it would deceive the elected if possible. Now that stalk don't look nothing like a seed. Neither does a toss look like a seed. But notice now not in Luther's day but in the last day. So the anointed ones at the end times which he preached the next year in 1965 was a major revelation of his masterpiece. The next two elements were both the church ages and the three works of grace. As brother Random said all nature everything works right with with the word of God. And here it is exactly perfectly in these church ages. That's the reason the Holy Ghost came down and drawed those things and made them out for us the way he has. It's exactly notice the life that was in the husk in the stalk and in the tossel in the husk all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stalk went one went to make the other. Justification made a way for sanctification. Sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself. So, as these visuals show, Brother Ram used the wheat plant to show the progress of how the wheat goes through three stages. stalk which represents the Lutheran church, the head which represents the Methodist movement, and then back to the seed which is the bride of Jesus Christ, those who believe Brother Brandham's Bible-based message and who are filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. To make it as simple as possible, the wheat plant is almost like a timeline. Martin Luther started his ministry around 1517, representing the stalk. John Wesley had a deeper religious experience that stirred him up around 1738. The Holy Ghost fell on Isuza Street in 1906 and the bride of Jesus Christ began to receive the major teachings of the third pole in 1963 when brother Random preached the revelation of the seven seals which he called his new commission, the opening of the word, the third pole. And then it come to me, not a voice, just come to me. Oh, that is the angels of the Lord coming to give me a new commission. See the first pull healing. Second pull prophesy. Third pull the opening of the word. The mysteries revealed. No more. There's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets. But the only way the prophet can be a vindicated is by the word. And remember the third pool was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word. Jesus Christ also taught this masterpiece in Mark 4:28. He said the kingdom of God was like a wheat plant. First the blade which represents the stalk, the Lutheran church. Then the ear which is also called the head which represents the Methodist movement. After that the full corn in the ear which represents brother Ram's ministry bringing us back to the original word. The fourth revelation is that denominations are dead because they've added to the word or taken away from the word as brother Brandham said when he quoted Revelation 22:18 and 19. Amen. Don't you see why he never used an organization? He can't get back in it again. It's dead. But the life passes on from one to the other. Hallelujah. See the creeds and inject. Whosoever shall add one word or take one word out. See, he's blocked off from it. It must be the life seed traveling on. Notice what they have done. All these have done is proved by history just exactly the way the church has come. Never to be useful to him again. Organization is laid on the shelf. There never has been in all the history a church after it organized. But what it died and the organization died and never did raise again. Can't you see men who are blind? Open your eyes. Nature and the word coordinating together and proving it right here that this is the truth. That it is the truth that life leaves a stalk to make the tossle. From the tossel it makes the husk and from the husk it goes into the original. Never again. notice never again to be useful to him. And the fifth and final revelation in brother Ram's masterpiece is the end time restoration of the original church. The same power and brother Ram says the same doctrine as the book of Acts church. He's the same doctrine that come forth from the beginning. Brother Ram told us Malachi 45 and 6 taught this revelation. Luke 17:30, Revelation 1 11, Revelation 10:7, and Joel 2:23-26. And of course, there's many other verses that back all these five revelations up. Brother Ram said he could have spent hours on this section of the sermon, but it was only about 30 minutes. Alpha and Omega, it's become the first and the last. Oh my brother. Uh we can stay hours on that. How is this bride going to do this? How is this uh wheat going to do this? Malachi 4 said in the last days it would be restored back. What? Restored back like the beginning. Amen. Take it back. I will restore saith the Lord. All the years the palmer worm and canker worm and all these other things eaten. I will restore again. Malachi 4 said he will restore the hearts of the people and the faith of the people back to their original fathers again. We see this right before us, church. Where are we at? [Music] He started on the day of Pentecost to build another masterpiece. The original seed word started in the first church. What was it? The seed word, the word manifested, the promise that had been given. Joel said, "It shall come to pass in the last days, sayith God, I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and daughters shall prophesy. Your old man shall dream dreams. Your young man shall see visions." What he would do in the last days, too, last 2,000 years. Notice amen. [Music] The word has become flesh. Exactly like he promised in Luke 17, Malachi 4 and all. That's right. Revelations. And then around the 1 hour and 52 minute mark, brother Ram tells for the first time the preview of the bride vision. He spends about eight minutes on this vision and I think it can be summarized with this simple illustration. Brother Ram has seen a vision of the preview of the bride. The first bride he sees is the book of Acts church which would be true Holy Ghostfilled believers that have the true seed of God, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Next, Brother Ram gets discouraged and sad when he sees churches of the United States, churches of Asia, churches from all around the world led by a witch, which Brother Ram said was the World Council of Churches. But when the women were coming, the leader of them was a witch. And this witch, to my notion, it's nothing else in the world, but she's a she's that world council of church is leading him right straight down the road where she was going, dancing to rock and roll, smoking cigarettes, wearing makeup, short hair. But then, Brother Ram hears the voice say, "The bride's going to come again." And it's a bride from all nations who looks and acts just like the original bride of Jesus Christ in the beginning. So here's where we get the revelation of the life of the wheat plant. A wheat plant starts with seed, but it must go through all the stages in order to produce the seed again by the grace of God. Brother Ram used Revelation 1 to teach this truth. Jesus is the first and the last. So the full word of God was in the first church, the Ephesians church age, the book of Acts church, and the fullness of the word and power and doctrine will be in the last church age, the bride of Jesus Christ. Brother Ram said Christ in the church would be the first and the last, the alpha and omega. The alpha has become omega. Amen. The first become the last and the last is the first. The seed that went in has come through a process and become the seed again. The alpha and omega is the same. Now he said I am alpha and omega. You never say anything in between. I'm alpha and omega. The first and the last. That's sir. The first ministry and the last ministry is the same. Amen. The first message and the second last message is the same name. I'm I was an alpha. I'm an omega. But the bride came back cuz she is alpha and omega. God the great sculpture has made him a masterpiece. This is such a beautiful revelation. Brother Ram said this revelation made him the happiest person. Hallelujah. Oh mom, happiest person in the world. God has let me see this. Watch how perfect the word and these nature works together. And then from the 2hour mark to the end of the sermon about 17 minutes, Brother Bram closes with prayer, singing, and worship to the Lord Jesus Christ. Today we thank God for God's masterpiece, the Lord Jesus Christ, and also the masterpiece God gave to his prophet William Brandham, the masterpiece of the wheat plant. [Music] [Music]
