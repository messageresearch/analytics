[0:03] Revelation chapter 7 the themes of this
[0:08] chapter include the sealing of the
[0:10] 144,000 Israelites and the Gentile
[0:13] multitudes worship of the Lamb around
[0:16] the heavenly throne
[0:19] the sealing of the 144,000 Israelites
[0:22] which include 12,000 believers from each
[0:25] of the 12 tribes of Israel
[0:27] takes place on Mount Zion and Jerusalem
[0:29] as revelation 14 one through five
[0:31] provides us with more wonderful detail
[0:34] of the same scene we see in Revelation 7
[0:37] 1 through 8 this is the moment when the
[0:40] nation of Israel is born of the Holy
[0:41] Ghost at once in one day by Jesus Christ
[0:45] the Lamb himself this is the moment when
[0:48] the nation of Israel be grafted back
[0:50] into God's new covenant the baptism of
[0:52] the holy ghost the Gentile multitude
[0:56] from all nations of Revelation 7 verses
[0:58] 9 to 17 is the wife or bride of Jesus
[1:02] Christ and has seen worshiping the Lamb
[1:04] around his throne in heaven
[1:08] the timing of the events of this chapter
[1:10] are as follows
[1:13] the sealing of the 144,000 Israelites
[1:16] takes place at the end of the
[1:18] Tribulation Period following the
[1:20] three-and-a-half year ministry of the
[1:22] two witnesses or prophets Moses and
[1:24] Elijah after the 144,000 have witnessed
[1:28] the death resurrection and rapture of
[1:30] the two prophets they will be ready to
[1:32] receive the Messiah that the two men
[1:34] were preaching about for the last three
[1:36] and a half years
[1:38] the timing of the Gentile multitude
[1:40] worshipping around the throne in heaven
[1:42] is unknown to us but it seems to be
[1:45] either a scene that takes place during
[1:47] the marriage supper the lamb which is
[1:49] during the tribulation but takes place
[1:51] in heaven so that the wife of Christ is
[1:53] kept from wrath or it is a scene from
[1:56] the 1000 year millennial reign for these
[1:59] Gentile believers are seen in the temple
[2:01] which could be the earthly Millennial
[2:03] temple that will be built in Jerusalem
[2:05] we can rule out that this scene is not
[2:07] the New Jerusalem because there is no
[2:09] temple at that time according to
[2:11] Revelation 21 verse 22
[2:15] the symbols and key revelations in this
[2:18] chapter include the seal of the Living
[2:20] God in the foreheads and the blood
[2:22] washed white robes
[2:25] the seal of the Living God represents
[2:27] the baptism of the holy ghost that is a
[2:29] seal or mark unto the day of the
[2:31] believers Redemption or the day when
[2:33] they receive their new celestial body
[2:35] this seal is the indwelling presence of
[2:38] the Holy Spirit in the believers soul
[2:40] which Jesus foretold he would send and
[2:42] st. Paul said was the mystery that all
[2:45] the Old Testament believers longed for
[2:47] Christ in you the hope of glory the
[2:51] Gentile church has and is receiving this
[2:53] seal now but the Israelite church cannot
[2:56] be born again of this seal at this time
[2:58] because God has left the Jews and gone
[3:01] to the Gentiles to get a bride for his
[3:03] namesake the blood washed white robes
[3:08] represent the same thing as the seal of
[3:10] God God's Spirit indwelling the believer
[3:13] clothing them in the power of the Holy
[3:15] Ghost to have a white robe is to have
[3:18] the righteousness of Jesus Christ and
[3:20] His righteousness only comes to those
[3:22] who are born again of the Holy Ghost
[3:24] furthermore to be blood washed does not
[3:27] mean to be washed in the literal blood
[3:28] of Jesus but rather it means that the
[3:31] life of Jesus's blood or spirit of
[3:33] Christ has cleansed the mind and life of
[3:36] the believer
