[0:02] I agree disagree with the Baptist but
[0:05] the Presbyterians and their systems but
[0:08] in there these genuine Christians
[0:13] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:18] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:21] viewer's question about the Asbury
[0:24] Revival that's going on in Wilmore
[0:26] Kentucky
[0:27] so as message believers who follow the
[0:29] bible-based revelations that God gave to
[0:31] his Prophet William Branham what should
[0:34] be our reaction to this so-called
[0:36] Revival
[0:37] by God's grace our reaction should be to
[0:40] examine it by the word of God and hope
[0:42] that some people are genuinely getting
[0:45] saved which means justified by the Holy
[0:48] Ghost and hopefully by God's grace some
[0:50] are getting partial sanctification by
[0:53] the Holy Ghost as well which we'll
[0:55] explain in this short video
[0:58] I'll begin with what is the Revival
[1:00] and what is it producing
[1:03] on February 8th of this year 2023 at a
[1:07] chapel service at the University of
[1:10] Asbury in Wilmore Kentucky college
[1:12] students stayed after the service and
[1:14] kept worshiping and apparently seeking
[1:17] God and praying repenting of sins and
[1:20] this service has never stopped it's been
[1:21] ongoing for about 11 days if I'm not
[1:24] mistaken by the grace of God there's
[1:27] lots of videos online that you can see
[1:30] about this revival there's testimonies
[1:32] of people repenting of their sins
[1:33] there's also testimonies of physical
[1:35] healings there's lots of worship and
[1:38] praise going on and it's possible that
[1:41] even one demon was cast out in these
[1:43] meetings
[1:44] now if these are genuine works of the
[1:46] Holy Spirit then as a message believer I
[1:48] would Rejoice if people are genuinely
[1:50] getting saved repenting of their sin
[1:52] drawing closer to God and if a demon was
[1:55] cast out I would rejoice in that as well
[1:57] remember friends even David cast out
[2:00] demons out of Saul in the Old Testament
[2:02] and while Jesus was on Earth remember
[2:04] there was a man who was not following
[2:06] Jesus that was casting out devils and
[2:08] Jesus let him keep casting out devils
[2:11] and said he that is not against us is
[2:13] for us
[2:15] so I have not physically attended the
[2:17] Asbury Revival I live about six hours
[2:19] north of Wilmore
[2:21] but now let's look at what is Revival
[2:24] according to the Greek definition in the
[2:26] New Testament Revival has at least two
[2:28] meanings the first is to live again as
[2:31] in Jesus's resurrection
[2:33] so this is a physical Revival from the
[2:35] dead
[2:36] the second definition is probably what
[2:38] defines the Asbury Revival it's to be
[2:41] restored to a correct life of one who
[2:44] returns to a better moral State and it
[2:46] can also mean to regain strength and
[2:49] vigor so the second definition is
[2:51] probably what's going on at Asbury if
[2:54] indeed people are getting a genuine Holy
[2:56] Ghost Revival what's happening is
[2:58] college students or even adults are
[3:00] getting restored to a correct life
[3:02] they've probably heard about Jesus maybe
[3:05] they've claimed to believe in Jesus
[3:07] Through the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[3:09] and the worship going on perhaps some of
[3:11] them are repenting of their sins that
[3:12] they know are wrong and trying to live a
[3:14] correct Life Again by the grace of God
[3:16] perhaps some of the college students and
[3:18] adults had been weakened in their faith
[3:21] and now in this group worship they're
[3:24] finding strength maybe they're finding
[3:25] the joy of the Lord after repenting of
[3:27] their sins
[3:28] now what's interesting about this
[3:30] revival is that I've been preaching on
[3:32] the Azusa Street Revival since January
[3:35] 29th so a little over a week before this
[3:37] revival broke out in Asbury
[3:40] and brother Branham said the Azusa
[3:42] Street Revival was the greatest Revival
[3:44] or outpouring of the Holy Ghost since
[3:46] the day of Pentecost so let's listen to
[3:48] the quote
[3:53] a man in California
[3:57] a negro
[3:59] one crossed out
[4:01] give him the experience of the baptism
[4:04] of the Holy Ghost from there formed
[4:06] Azusa Street
[4:08] the old Azusa Street Mission
[4:10] from that scattered to a sweat the whole
[4:13] nation
[4:14] from Nation went to Nation after Nation
[4:21] God had provided for them
[4:26] one of the greatest revivals that this
[4:29] nation has ever known I don't care what
[4:32] it was
[4:33] there's never been a Revival like the
[4:35] Pentecostal Revival
[4:37] right
[4:39] Wesley never had none of him
[4:43] Wisconsin Calvin Knox great reformers
[4:46] but they never had to revive like the
[4:48] Pentecostal Revival the greatest thing
[4:51] that struck the Earth since the Holy
[4:52] Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost
[4:56] also I think it's important to show that
[4:58] through the study of scripture I found
[5:00] at least six types of Revival I have a
[5:03] video about this but at that point I
[5:05] only had recognized four of the types of
[5:07] Revival but now I believe they're six by
[5:09] God's grace so let's go through these as
[5:12] we go through these six type of revivals
[5:14] we'll be able to see what kind of
[5:15] Revival may be happening in Asbury
[5:18] the first type of Revival is National
[5:20] Revival
[5:22] and of course this is not happening in
[5:24] the United States brother random said
[5:25] it's thus saith the Lord the United
[5:27] States will never have a national
[5:28] Revival the Bible does record National
[5:30] revivals for Israel of course in the
[5:33] days of David Solomon when the Queen of
[5:35] Sheba visited she'd never seen such a
[5:38] Revival like that Revival and brother
[5:39] Brandon said it was because all the
[5:41] people rallied around Solomon's gift of
[5:44] course I was a short-lived Revival
[5:45] because Solomon fell away from his
[5:47] wisdom and built Alters unto every false
[5:51] god of his thousand wives but also in
[5:54] the days of Hezekiah there's great
[5:56] Revival which is recorded in Second
[5:58] Kings 18. they tore down all the high
[6:01] places or worship of false Idols they
[6:03] crushed all the physical idols and they
[6:06] restored the house of God
[6:08] also you see a Revival in the days of
[6:10] Josiah in second chronicles 34. they
[6:13] found the word of God they rent their
[6:14] clothes because they were so ashamed of
[6:16] all the sins they'd been committing but
[6:18] the word of God they read impacted them
[6:20] and they repented their sins and started
[6:23] keeping the Commandments of God
[6:26] the second type of Revival is a church
[6:28] age Revival and of course this is the
[6:30] Revival that started in 1906 for the
[6:33] laodicean church age through William
[6:35] Seymour whom brother Branham spoke very
[6:37] highly of
[6:39] and Friends history says that as the
[6:41] Azusa Street Revival went on Seymour
[6:44] realized tongues were not the evidence
[6:46] of the Holy Ghost Seymour realized that
[6:48] the Divine love of Jesus Christ was the
[6:50] evidence and that lines up with what
[6:52] brother random said as well because God
[6:54] is love
[6:55] when God comes into your soul and abides
[6:58] there permanently that's the baptism of
[6:59] the Holy Ghost and that will produce all
[7:01] the fruits of the spirit that will help
[7:03] you believe and receive the message of
[7:05] your hour
[7:06] so it's likely Asbury is not getting the
[7:09] church age Revival unless they go all
[7:11] the way on to the baptism of the Holy
[7:13] Ghost
[7:14] the third type of Revival is the latter
[7:16] rain Revival
[7:18] this is spoken of at James 5 verse 7 the
[7:21] early and the latter rain we know
[7:23] brother Adam's Ministry was the early
[7:24] Reign the teaching rain and we know
[7:26] rapturing faith is the latter rain so it
[7:29] does not appear that the Asbury Revival
[7:31] is the lateran Revival because that will
[7:33] be falling upon the Bride of Jesus
[7:35] Christ who believes all the Bible
[7:36] revelations that God gave to his Prophet
[7:39] brother Branham
[7:41] the fourth type of Revival is the Soul
[7:43] Revival this is a personal one-time
[7:45] Revival of the Soul or this is called
[7:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:50] it's unlikely Asbury students and
[7:53] faculty are receiving this four type of
[7:56] Revival and here's the proof of that
[7:58] recently I made a video about milk
[8:01] Christianity versus me Christianity from
[8:03] Hebrews chapter 5 verses 10 through
[8:06] chapter 6 verse 3. and as you can see on
[8:10] your screen here's six beginning or
[8:12] Elementary doctrines a Christian has to
[8:14] receive before they can move on to
[8:16] Perfection which is the baptism of the
[8:18] Holy Ghost
[8:19] so the first one is repentance from dead
[8:21] works
[8:23] hopefully some people at the Asbury
[8:25] Revival are repenting of their sins but
[8:28] how many will repent of all their dead
[8:29] works such as watching porn watching
[8:32] dirty movies watching sports how many
[8:35] will put on Modest clothes on some of
[8:38] the videos I saw girls in shorts and of
[8:40] course they're revealing their thighs
[8:42] and thighs our nakedness according to
[8:44] Isaiah chapter 47 I saw girls with short
[8:48] hair and a woman who cuts her hair is a
[8:50] dishonor to her husband if she's married
[8:53] or it's a dishonor to her father if
[8:56] she's single so we don't really know the
[8:59] depths of repentance that those at
[9:01] Asbury are actually receiving and
[9:04] pressing into
[9:05] second Faith towards God
[9:08] are those who are getting Revival in
[9:10] Asbury is there faith in God or the word
[9:14] the word of this hour
[9:16] the mysteries of God being finished
[9:19] justification entire sanctification and
[9:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[9:24] third do they have the doctrine of
[9:26] baptisms do they know there's a lord
[9:28] Jesus Christ water baptism and a soul
[9:31] baptism the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[9:33] it's likely they don't
[9:36] on the statement of faith website for
[9:39] Asbury University they State they are
[9:42] trinitarians so we plainly know they
[9:45] don't have the correct water baptism
[9:47] that's a shame but will they have such a
[9:50] Revival where they press into the things
[9:51] of God in order to understand the
[9:54] doctrine of baptisms only time will tell
[9:58] fourth laying on of hands
[10:00] do they recognize the power of laying on
[10:02] hands praying for the sick casting out
[10:05] Devils it seems they may have some
[10:07] understanding of this
[10:09] if indeed a woman did get a devil cast
[10:12] out of her
[10:13] but then the question arises well that
[10:16] woman who was set free will she clean
[10:17] out her house as Jesus taught in Matthew
[10:19] chapter 12 and fill it with the Holy
[10:21] Ghost so more demons don't come in
[10:25] fifth resurrection of the Dead
[10:28] do they have the understanding that
[10:30] there's two resurrections and not just
[10:32] one there's a Rapture Resurrection which
[10:34] is called the first resurrection and
[10:36] then there's the resurrection of the
[10:37] Dead to the white Throne judgment
[10:40] and six and finally Eternal judgment
[10:44] friends it's unlikely they understand
[10:46] that hell is not eternal
[10:49] Asbury University is a Wesleyan
[10:51] University
[10:52] so they follow some of the teachings of
[10:55] God's messenger John Wesley but of
[10:56] course not all
[10:58] do they believe that hell is not Eternal
[11:00] as the Bible says or do they believe
[11:03] that Sinners will burn eternally and of
[11:06] course we know Sinners cannot burn
[11:07] eternally because they do not have
[11:09] eternal life
[11:10] moving on to the fifth type of Revival
[11:12] this is the Revival in the human Spirit
[11:14] which Paul says it is a transformation
[11:17] of the Mind in Romans 12. and he says in
[11:20] the book of Ephesians that were to be
[11:23] renewed day by day
[11:24] so this is the daily Revival of the
[11:26] human spirit I believe this is the type
[11:29] of Revival some people are probably
[11:31] experiencing it Asbury they let their
[11:33] minds get focused on the things of the
[11:35] world maybe politics or as we said
[11:38] Wicked sins like pornography or maybe
[11:41] the NFL or NBA worldly things worldly
[11:44] music money riches cares of this life
[11:47] and they've realized they've sinned and
[11:50] so they're coming to God they're drawing
[11:52] night to God and regaining strength in
[11:54] their human mind to focus on things of
[11:57] God more often than the things of the
[11:59] world so to me that's likely the Revival
[12:02] that they're having at Asbury
[12:04] they're getting their minds more focused
[12:06] on God but again that doesn't mean their
[12:08] souls are baptized with the Holy Ghost
[12:10] because they've got to be justified
[12:12] saved Sanctified and this is the step
[12:14] most of them are probably lacking living
[12:17] a full Sanctified life and then having
[12:19] their souls baptized with the Holy Ghost
[12:22] and the sixth type of Revival is the
[12:24] physical Revival like Jesus's body was
[12:26] revived at his resurrection
[12:28] this was in Romans 14 verse 9 for to
[12:32] this end Christ both died and Rose and
[12:35] revived
[12:36] and also we wonder what will this
[12:38] revival eventually produce well it's my
[12:41] guess it'll probably produce the same
[12:43] thing that the 1970 Asbury Revival
[12:46] produced so this University had a
[12:49] Revival in 1970 about 52 or 53 years ago
[12:53] and there's videos about it I watched
[12:55] some of them on YouTube and It produced
[12:57] justification for people people claim to
[12:59] get saved and some level of
[13:01] sanctification
[13:03] now some of the people they interviewed
[13:04] were men and women some of the men went
[13:07] into full-time preaching Ministry or
[13:09] became missionaries for the Wesleyan
[13:11] Church or the Methodist Church which is
[13:13] good but we know that's not the full
[13:15] word of God that's not a full baptism of
[13:18] the Holy Ghost message
[13:20] and of course there were women that got
[13:21] saved and they testified and on the
[13:23] videos they had makeup on they had cut
[13:25] hair they were wearing pants so again
[13:27] the 1970 Revival didn't produce a fully
[13:31] Sanctified and cleaned out life so it's
[13:33] my guess that this current Asbury
[13:36] Revival will probably produce the same
[13:38] thing and again I'm not criticizing
[13:40] these individuals but I'm examining all
[13:43] of their lives according to the full
[13:45] revealed word of God which God promised
[13:46] to do in Revelation 10 verse 7 finish
[13:49] the mystery of God Jesus said in Matthew
[13:52] 17 11 Elijah would become and restore
[13:55] all things so he's restored modesty he's
[13:57] restored Holiness he's restored entire
[14:00] sanctification
[14:01] Saints I believe this revival is also
[14:04] this generation's chance to receive the
[14:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost as brother
[14:08] Branham said each generation gets a shot
[14:10] at receiving the word of God and it
[14:13] reminds me of Matthew 25 with the
[14:15] parable of the wise and foolish virgins
[14:17] both virgins get the wake-up call in
[14:20] every generation to receive the holy
[14:22] ghost or not so I believe this is this
[14:24] generation's opportunity they're in
[14:26] Asbury to get Justified Sanctified and
[14:29] go all the way to the Holy Ghost
[14:31] it's my humble opinion if they stay at
[14:33] that University they probably won't get
[14:34] the full baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[14:36] by God's grace some of them will be
[14:38] justified and partially Sanctified and
[14:40] if those are genuine experiences and
[14:42] they keep those experiences I believe
[14:43] they'll be saved friends I do believe
[14:45] that Asbury people can be saved just
[14:48] like the type of the wise and foolish
[14:50] virgins Abraham was the separated holy
[14:53] ghost-filled type he was separated unto
[14:55] God lot was the type of the foolish
[14:57] virgin closely associated with things of
[14:59] the world and yet the Bible called him a
[15:01] righteous soul in second Peter chapter
[15:02] two so we have wise Christians and we
[15:05] have foolish Christians are the Asbury
[15:07] Christians are they wise enough to
[15:09] repent of watching the Super Bowl the
[15:11] wicked halftime show the filthy
[15:13] commercials are they willing to delete
[15:15] all their worldly music and stop
[15:17] watching filthy movies are they ready to
[15:19] pray and fast for the baptism of the
[15:21] Holy Ghost are they ready to pay tithes
[15:23] and offerings are they ready to gather
[15:25] more with Saints as they see that day
[15:27] approaching are they willing to dress
[15:29] modestly and live holy unto the Lord
[15:32] and Friends brother Brandon believed
[15:34] denominational people could be saved as
[15:37] long as they were sincerely trusting in
[15:38] the blood of Jesus Christ in the seventh
[15:41] seal sermon brother Branham said any
[15:43] individual Catholic Jewish or whatever
[15:46] it might be Methodist Baptist
[15:48] Presbyterian any organization God has
[15:50] children sitting out in there so brother
[15:53] Ram said plainly God has children this
[15:57] must mean foolish virgins out there in
[15:59] the Catholic Church the Jewish Church
[16:00] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[16:03] any questions and answers part 1 1964
[16:06] brother Ram said he sent three quarters
[16:09] of a million of his converts to the
[16:10] Assembly of God Church he said he's not
[16:12] against the people he's against every
[16:15] system that separates men and then he
[16:17] said he'd be a hypocrite to send his own
[16:19] children to death so he was telling the
[16:21] people the Assemblies of God is Not
[16:23] death there are some people that are
[16:25] saved in there and then in part two he
[16:28] said the same thing I disagree with the
[16:30] Assemblies of God but there's a many
[16:32] Assembly of God man that's a precious
[16:34] brother
[16:35] I disagree with Oneness Doctrine but but
[16:37] there's a many of those men are precious
[16:39] men I disagree with the Baptist with the
[16:42] Presbyterians and their systems but in
[16:44] there there's genuine Christians so I
[16:46] would say the same thing for the Asbury
[16:48] Revival there's probably genuine
[16:50] Christians in there but remember Jesus
[16:52] said few there be that find it and the
[16:54] same thing applies to message churches
[16:55] few there be that find the narrow road
[16:58] that leads to life
[16:59] in closing
[17:01] friends I hope this short video has been
[17:03] a help to you if you've been wondering
[17:05] about the Asbury Revival or just
[17:07] revivals in general
[17:09] again I've been praying for Revival this
[17:11] year for myself and our local church
[17:13] which is what we should all be praying
[17:15] for according to Saint Paul but
[17:18] ultimately friends we should be praying
[17:19] for the latter rain Revival again found
[17:21] in the book of James and brother Brown
[17:23] said the latter rain is rapturing faith
[17:26] we're looking for that final Revival the
[17:28] bride's Revival where God pours out
[17:30] rapturing Grace upon the Saints so their
[17:33] bodies can be changed in a moment and
[17:35] twinkling of an eye of course no man
[17:37] knows the day or the hour of the rapture
[17:40] but the Bible says we know the seasons
[17:41] of The Rapture in first Thessalonians
[17:43] chapter 5. so may each one of us seek
[17:46] daily Revival for our minds if we're not
[17:48] born again may we seek that one Revival
[17:51] of the soul the baptism of the Holy
[17:53] Ghost the Sea of the Holy Ghost and may
[17:55] we press toward the mark of the High
[17:57] Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[17:59] friends this is our opportunity in our
[18:02] generation to receive the Revival that
[18:04] we need as message Believers we want the
[18:06] Revival in our souls the baptism of the
[18:09] Holy Ghost so we'll be the wise virgins
[18:11] and ready to meet Jesus at his appearing
[18:15] if you have any questions concerns or
[18:17] testimonies about this video please
[18:19] contact me
[18:22] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[18:24] the desire of your heart
