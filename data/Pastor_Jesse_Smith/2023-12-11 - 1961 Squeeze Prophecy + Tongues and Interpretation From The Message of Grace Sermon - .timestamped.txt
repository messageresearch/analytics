[0:31] that I will talk to you this morning by
[0:34] the voice of my Prophet I have given him
[0:36] a message this morning that might seem
[0:39] be strange to him yet it has been
[0:41] ordained of me that your understanding
[0:43] might be made fruitful that you might
[0:46] look upon my work of righteousness that
[0:48] I'm working in my church this day that
[0:50] your hearts might be lifted up that your

[0:56] things that I'm going to speak to you

[1:34] Mighty knowledge and this spiritual
[1:36] wisdom and the understanding that you
[1:37] are going to need when the time comes of
[1:39] the persecution that's going to come
[1:42] just before I Rapture my bride you will

[2:19] Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy
[2:24] name thy kingdom come thy will be done
[2:29] in earth as it is in heaven give us this
[2:33] day our daily bread and forgive us of
[2:36] our
[2:37] trespasses as we forgive those who

[3:11] tool and my paper would
[3:15] be

[3:22] might go to All
[3:26] Peoples God's holy spirit has strange
[3:30] ways of dealing with his people
