TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I have no Holiness to present to him but I'm trusting in his oh his grace and I have it in my heart I've unmerited it nothing I could do to deserve it by by Grace he called me and invited me to come greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question what do I think about Brother brandom's picture of him wearing shorts so I appreciate the question by God's grace we want to give an answer for every Bible question we believe brother Brandon to be a Bible Prophet a genuine Bible Prophet Vindicated by the Holy Ghost and so this is a good question before getting into it my name is Jesse Smith I pastored bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio for the last 17 years and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his Prophet brother William brandham and of course I also defend William branham's Christian Godly character so here's a picture apparently brother brandham wore shorts in 1951 in South Africa now I can't verify that this picture is legitimate or real but of course there's an online video of brother Ram's daughter sister Rebecca sharing this video apparently at a church in Tennessee in 1999 so in summary of course it's wrong to wear shorts so if this picture is legitimate which I don't know if it is or not it was either a moment of weakness for brother brandham willful sin or a moment of ignorance where he didn't have the Revelation yet that wearing shorts was a sin but friends even if the picture is real it doesn't change the fact that brother brandham was a genuine Vindicated prophet of the Lord and of course also like we all want to be he was a sinner Saved By The Amazing Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ he was saved and forgiven of every sin by the blood of Jesus Christ because he had faith in the blood of Jesus Christ so I want to make Five Points about this picture and this subject the first point is the Bible truth about shorts the Bible clearly teaches that revealing the thigh is nakedness in Isaiah 47: 1-3 of course I learned about this Truth by listening to brother brandham brother brandham preached against wearing shorts both women and men and then I used those thoughts from Brother Bram sermons to write my 2019 modesty book restoring Christian modesty God's perfect will for your outward appearance parents and it contains this Bible teaching that neither men nor women should expose the thigh because the thigh is nakedness so of course regarding shorts for men and women but in this case men I'm against men wearing shorts in public so that's the Bible teaching about shorts now what's interesting though is in 1953 it was the first time brother brandom condemned women wearing shorts so I can't find any quotes of brother Bram condemning shorts before 1953 so this just gives a little evidence that maybe he was ignorant on this this topic beforehand but I don't know this is from the resurrection of Lazarus November 22nd 1953 let's listen to the quote yes sir when you quit going to church and blow up calls a preacher told you it wasn't lady like to wear shorts you're on your road don't worry trouble's on its Road just keep on you bu out this Cas now the first time I can find a quote that brother Ram clearly condemned men wearing shorts was in 1964 so this possibly could give us some in ight into what brother Brown was thinking if this picture was indeed real from 1951 it was in questions and answers part two 1964 August 23rd evening brother brandom said if a man went half naked there would be no Scandal to it because a woman wouldn't be tempted by a man who had a shirt off or shorts on the man looks sloppy and sickly horrible let's listen to the quote now look a man there's not much to him when it comes to a body and he if he went half naked it would there wouldn't be no Scandal to it not holding for man but the you know that what kind of a woman would be tempted by a man with his shirt off and shorts on or whatever he had a big old Burly looking thing it looks sloppy and sickly I horrible see these men out Earth I think it' make a woman vomit to look at such a thing and she had but now you take a woman in putter like that that's a different Temple you understand so knowing this it seems maybe this was brother Ram's thought process maybe in 1951 we don't know but to me this seems the most logical explanation in 1951 brother random thought men are sloppy and sickly looking if they wear shorts so that's why maybe he thought it was fine in this moment to wear shorts but again I don't know and of course later on in 1965 Satan's Eden brother Bram condemned men wearing shorts and he said a man wearing shorts was men wearing women's clothes and of course that's why I don't wear shorts let's listen to the quote she took off the clothes that God dressed her in back in Eden for her journey through the this Wilderness she tuck them off she stripped herself down when God had her wrapped all over in skins she's begin to shave a little off each time now she's back to where she was at the beginning now she's got her adom to wearing her underneath clothes a man put on them little old looking shs and get out your I don't think there's much man doing amen he is the biggest I know of Amen see she's got her perverted Adam to act like she see wearing her underneath po she's seen what she could do out in her when she took off all her clothes but her underneath ones that's the shorts of course that's a woman's underneath clothes and here her Adam is wearing them now which according to God's original word is an Abomination for a woman to put on a garment pertains to a man and a man to put on a garment pertains to a woman from the original word think of it now he now wears her bangs also he Combs them down puts a curler in them some of the most sickly sights I've ever seen in my life is some of those kids out here today with their bangs combed down like this and colored bleached hair with some kind of a peroxide something and bleaching and rolling in curlers making Banks you big amen that's a horrible thing to say from a p pit but judgment begins at the house of God Amen you don't even know where you're a man or woman amen and I understand that our United States Army is coming out next in shars that's right see what the perversion is it's a woman's clothes where's R Beng the other day I was over Howard Johnson's not this one here but one on the road going up and I just said set back in the am here come a little boy along his mouth open and he had dark hair here and it combed it over this way the second point is the apparent purpose of the picture as a family joke so when I was researching for this video I went and found the YouTube video I mentioned earlier about Rebecca brandham sharing this picture apparently in 1999 at a church in tenness so I'm going to play that clip here sister Rebecca said her dad wore it as a joke to the kids and some brethren talked him into doing it in South Africa at a national park in 1951 let's listen to the quote want you see this other side of them H can you imagine sorry um this was in South Africa at the K National Park and um it's when he was down there in 19 I believe it was 1951 and the brothers took him there and talked him into putting on one of these Safari suits and having his picture made to take bring home to us kids and when we saw this weekend saying that's not Daddy that's not Dad did you know the ston the floran shoes give it away that's bad yeah he like to CL for us and so of course friends you and I would likely agree it's never right to wear immodest cloth even as a joke but we don't know what brother brand was thinking in 1951 if this picture is legitimate but it seems from his previous quote that he thought men wearing shorts was just sloppy and sickly the third point is perhaps it was a moment of weakness if brother brandham did know better so Rebecca said her father was a clown at times if you listen to this whole video on YouTube Sister Rebecca will say that brother Brandon really liked to clown around with his friends and family he liked to do things that make people laugh this makes me think brother brand probably didn't realize the full significance of wearing shorts in 1951 and if this was was a moment of weakness for brother brandham let's remember all Christians including those people who' left the message if they are Christians do things they regret and of course there's some record of all of our wrongs somewhere whether digitally or on paper or in pictures but this is why the accusers of brother brandham always accusing brother brandham of wrongs and treating brother brandham in a way that they would not like to be treated because surely brother M's accusers wouldn't want people to dig up their past and then call them out publicly on YouTube yoube for it they're not following the Golden Rule they're not treating brother brandom how they' like to be treated friends we don't know if brother brandom repented of this act of wearing shorts or not if in fact he did wear shorts one thing I've always appreciated about brother brandham was his honesty so I would think if he did wear these shorts then he likely did have regrets because he publicly confessed lying to the IRS in front of numerous congregations and then he even publicly confessed that he would tell his children prideful jokes and say he was one of the three greatest men to come out of Indiana let's listen to the quote you're not supposed even to joke and cut up with one another God will make you give an account for Every Idle Word that you speak did you know that the Bible said that you'll have to give an account for Every Idle Word so what kind of people ought we to be people that's Frank Stern loving kind and never a bunch of nonsense always going along look you take a fellow that you start today I notice it on myself being of my own nature an Irishman I'm always a lot of wind about me anyhow to cut up and carry on and every ever so often even my wife say no bill I say that's right honey she said I tell the kids around there I'll say cut up with them or something say well now you know there was three great men come out of Kentucky who was that well uh uh Abraham Lincoln yeah Daniel Boon and your father something like that and she'll say now Bill there you go again now I have to go off in the closet somewhere and say Lord forgive me I didn't mean to say it do something to me make me quit that see and every day I if I do that now we talking on the word backslide this morning when you do that you're backslid yes sir you got to repent is that right sir I don't mean to say you went out in the world you did this and that but you done something you've got to repent and Die daily to live in Jesus Christ so every daily every day you've got to die every day to live in Christ Jesus let's keep in mind also that brother Ram said he daily repented of all of his sins so that's why I said earlier at the beginning even if brother R did wear shorts he was forgiven by the blood of Jesus Christ because he had faith in Jesus Christ his Lord here in 1954 questions answers part one brother Bram said Paul had to die every day he said and if Paul had to do that I'm going to have to do it too let's listen to the quote you backside on Christ but you don't on God because if you when you sin you're gone but uh you're constantly falling Paul had to die every day is that right he had to die every day repent every day and just constantly repenting all the time see and if Paul had to do that then I'm going to have to do you that's right so we but now if you've been um if you've been redeemed and you feel that the the blood of Jesus Christ cleans you from sin then I I and you've lived a Christian Life I I wouldn't think it be necessary but if you want to all right it'll be fine we'll be glad to do it now here's a quote law of Grace 1954 brother Ram says I made many mistakes still make them will always make them the Holy Spirit tells me that's wrong I Repent right there Lord forgive me me and then he just had to accept that Jesus forgave him because the devil would come around and say you sinned didn't you and he'd say no don't talk to me I have perfect faith in he who told me if I confess my wrongs he'd forgive me so brother Ram had perfect faith when the devil would try to accuse him of his past sins that he'd already confessed through the blood of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote I made many mistakes still make them we always make them but when I make them the Holy Spirit tells me that's wrong then I Repent right there Lord forgive me didn't mean to do it you help me I I walk on the same thing go just no sooner than that goes through my lips if we confess our sins amen he's just to forgive them is that right amen hallelujah the devil say you know what I tell you you're supposed to go do a certain thing you didn't do it you sin it you I said I confess it well I tell you oh don't talk to me no I have perfect faith in who you told me if I confess my wrongs he'd forgive me amen so I confess it going away from me I don't care nothing about you anyhow so just keep moving on Amen walk boldly right on into it if death lays there that's all right move right on into it with a perfect faith that God has promised that he'd raise you up at the last days the next quote Hebrews chapter 7 part 2 1957 brother Ram said I have no Holiness to present to him I love this quote but I'm trusting in his grace I've unmar it nothing I could do to deserve it but by Grace he called me and invited me to come brother Bram calls that the power of the Gospel the holy church moving on through the Forgiveness of Jesus Christ that's the atonement of the blood of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote I have no Holiness to present to him but I'm trusting in his oh his grace amen and I have it in my heart I've unmerited it nothing I could do to deserve it by by Grace he called me and invited me to come and I Look to Him and He took the desire away from me I make thousands of mistakes e each month and each year Sur I do but when I see him wrong I said God I didn't mean to do that you know my heart I didn't mean to do that I was trapped into that I didn't mean to do it you forgive me Lord if I done wrong to my brother I said brother forgive me I didn't mean to do that certainly God knows my heart oh there you are there's the blood sacrifice there's the power of the Gospel that Holy Church moving on not because something you done it's something you had nothing to do with there's the atonement here's a fourth Point how long did Brother brandom wear them we don't know how long brother Brandon wore these shorts if he did in fact wear them maybe he only wore them for a few minutes according to his daughter he was just trying to make his kids laugh by wearing this safari costume I don't know how long he wore them nor do brother Ram's accusers know so it's unfair to condemn brother brandom for wearing shorts and trying to make brother Ram like a hypocrite the fifth and final point is that these accusers of brother brandham are again committing the presentism fallacy they're judging brother brandom by the current understanding we have about men and shorts well today men and shorts can be an attractive thing because a lot of men lift weights and the culture has celebrated women lusting after men or even men L lusting after men it's sad to say that but that's the awful state that the culture's in right now and friends we don't want to get into the Trap of the presentism fallacy and so we don't want to judge brother brandham unfairly we don't want to jump to conclusions like all these accusers of brother Bram due to their own shame and Folly brother ramam is not here to defend himself so we must not jump to false conclusions and make presumptions before finishing this video Let Me Again State the absolute proof that brother Brenham was a genuine prophet of God first there are six verses that declare this authorative phrase that Jesus must remain in Heaven until God has turned the hearts of the end time Believers back to the apostolic faith and these are the six scriptures that God used brother random to fulfill they are acts 320 and 21 Matthew 1711 and 12 Malachi 45 and 6 Revelation 107-11 Amos 37 and Luke 17:30 and again friends remember no accuser brother brandham has read my 2021 book and tried to refute the Bible truth in that book it's over 800 Pages proving brother random was a genuine prophet of God you know why they haven't because they're afraid of the truth and they're so disingenuous they won't research the other side of this subject that proves to me they're not serious researchers they're not honest researchers and they're very disingenuous the second reason brother brand revealed the 12 New Testament Mysteries there's only 12 doctrines called mysteries in the New Testament and brother brandom revealed all of them six of them he gave us thus sayith the Lord for the third point is brother R gave us eight other Pauline do with thus sayith the Lord the fourth point is that there are six fulfilled thus sayith the Lord prophecies from Brother brandham these people that say none of brother Ram's prophecies were foretold in advance they're foolish they're ignorant they don't know what they're talking about shame on them I have a video that shows six undeniable prophecies thus sayith the Lord that have come to pass the fifth point is there's 14 Pauline doctrines that brother brandham restored to the bride of Christ the New Testament Holy Ghost filled church every other church denomination every other Church Gathering is guilty of breaking one or all 14 of these this proves the true Holy Ghost filled Believers that follow brother Ram's message are the Bride of Jesus Christ because they keep all of Paul's gospel and Paul said we'd be judged by his gospel in Romans 2:16 and then Paul said if anyone adds or takes away their curse in Galatians 1 6-2 again proving brother R was a genuine prophet of God because He restored the truth from Paul's gospel that churches had failed to preach and He restored it to the true bride of Christ today and sixth and finally brother Ram had many Supernatural Miracles healings and discernments undeniable as these soldiers and Warriors of the faith who had these experiences die off we're going to have to do a better job and I mean we as message Believers of reminding the people of all these testimonies our family right now is reading the generations book there's 38 individuals who give testimonies in there and each one had thus sayith the Lord's from Brother brandham dreams and Visions discernments all from brother brandham and never one time did it fail and that's what I believe never one time did thus say the Lord fail coming from brother brandham did Brother Bram fail the brown bear Vision yes he told us that but on my video about the brown bear Vision there's 10 people some of them were prophets who failed Visions as well or disobeyed Visions they disobeyed thus say the Lord visions that God gave them so I'll put a link in the description to that video and also put a link to the video about the six fulfilled thus sayi the Lord prophecies in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing remember brother Ram's accusers will always point us away from the Bible revelations that God gave to brother brandham and they'll nitpick brother bram's life they'll strain at a knat and swallow camel but what I mentioned here at the end this is what the accusers want us to forget about or try to distract us from all these absolute undeniable proofs that brother brandham was a genuine prophet of God reminds us of how Paul told Timothy Paul was thankful that Timothy was not ashamed of Paul Christ prisoner and that's what we say today we're not ashamed of brother brandom he was Christ's prisoner of course he was a sinner saved by grace just like all of us but he was a mighty prophet of God that's undeniable and that's what both of my books have been all about brother bram's Ministry and restoring the modesty standards and brother bram's Ministry finishing the mysteries of God Revelation 10:7 Amos 3:7 if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
