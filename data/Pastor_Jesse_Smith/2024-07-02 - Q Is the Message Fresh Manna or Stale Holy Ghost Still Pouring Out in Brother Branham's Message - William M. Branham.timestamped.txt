[0:03] a true
[0:04] bride Hallelujah there's going to be one
[0:07] why she's
[0:09] predestinated she won't be
[0:12] denominated because she's
[0:15] predestinated she don't have to worry
[0:16] about some denomination she's already
[0:18] predestinated to take the
[0:20] place greetings friends in the matchless
[0:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:25] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:27] viewer's question since brother Brandon
[0:30] has been off the scene for almost 60
[0:31] years now does this mean the message has
[0:34] gone stale or should there be a constant
[0:37] flow of fresh Mana how do we balance
[0:40] this this is a wonderful question and
[0:42] I'll give my best answer by God's grace
[0:45] I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ
[0:47] Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I
[0:49] defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ that
[0:52] Christ revealed to St Paul then had to
[0:54] restore through Martin Luther John
[0:56] Wesley and the late William brandham
[0:58] God's Prophet to the Gentiles this
[1:00] church age brother random lived from
[1:02] 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother Ram's
[1:05] Godly Christian character this was a
[1:07] great question and it's based upon a
[1:09] quote this brother sent me in an email
[1:12] brother brandom said we're standing near
[1:14] the Judgment why they're trying to eat
[1:16] Old Mana that fell back Yonder 50 years
[1:18] ago the Pentecostal Church the Holiness
[1:21] Church is trying to over 200 years ago
[1:23] the lutherans about 300 years or more
[1:26] many hundreds of years ago they're
[1:28] trying to eat Old Mana old brother that
[1:30] stuff is
[1:31] stagnated this is from trying to do God
[1:33] a service without being the will of God
[1:36] July 18th morning service
[1:40] 1965 let's go ahead and listen to this
[1:42] quote and then we'll make some comments
[1:44] and I'll give my best understanding of
[1:46] this quote let's listen to the quote
[1:49] we're in the last days we're standing
[1:52] near the Judgment why they're trying to
[1:56] eat Old Mana that fell back down 50
[2:00] years ago the Pentecostal Church the
[2:03] Holiness Church is trying over 200 years
[2:06] ago the Luthers about 300 or more years
[2:09] ago many hundreds of years ago they're
[2:12] trying to eat Old Mana oh brother that
[2:16] stuff is
[2:18] stagnated it's
[2:20] contaminated it'll it's got It's
[2:24] got I always said wiggle tails in it
[2:27] maggots amen he look kill you eat
[2:31] it friends this is a great quote from
[2:33] brother brandham I'll just briefly say
[2:36] that the point brother brandham is
[2:37] trying to make is that the former
[2:38] movements before his movement have
[2:41] rejected the present truth or the most
[2:44] recent move of God when that present
[2:47] truth came to them for example the
[2:50] Pentecostal Church rejected the true
[2:51] evidence of the Holy Ghost that God
[2:53] showed to brother brandham because the
[2:55] Pentecostals major on tongues as the
[2:57] evidence and we know tongues is not the
[2:59] evidence of the Holy Ghost and as
[3:01] brother Ram said the Lutheran rejected
[3:03] John Wesley's sanctification movement
[3:06] then of course they rejected the gifts
[3:08] of the Spirit that God restored at isua
[3:11] Street around
[3:12] 1906 like to give three reasons why the
[3:15] message has not gone stale for us first
[3:18] the word of God can never go stale the
[3:20] Bible says the word of the Lord endures
[3:22] forever Psalm
[3:24] 119 160 Thy word is true from the
[3:26] beginning and every one of thy righteous
[3:29] judgments endureth forever 1 Peter 1:25
[3:32] but the word of the Lord endureth
[3:33] forever and this is the word which by
[3:35] the gospel is preached unto you in John
[3:38] chapter 6 Jesus said my words are spirit
[3:40] and they are life so if the word is life
[3:43] there can only be one type of Life
[3:45] related to God that's eternal life so
[3:47] the word of God that's been delivered to
[3:49] us is eternal life and the word of God
[3:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is still
[3:53] going out today we know acts 238 says
[3:56] repent and be baptized in the name of
[3:58] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[3:59] and you shall receive the Holy Ghost but
[4:01] notice this call this offer is still
[4:03] going out to as many as the Lord Our God
[4:06] shall call last year we had some
[4:08] Services there in Napoleon Ohio and
[4:10] numerous people said they received the
[4:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost so that proves
[4:14] God is still calling people today to
[4:15] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[4:17] acts 239 for the promises unto you and
[4:20] to your children and to all that are far
[4:22] off even as many as a lord Our God shall
[4:24] call as long as God is still calling
[4:27] there are opportunities to for people to
[4:29] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[4:32] the word of God is Not stale the word of
[4:34] God is just alive today as it was on the
[4:36] day of Pentecost but again the context
[4:39] brother ran was showing was that each
[4:40] move of God Grieves the Holy Ghost if
[4:43] they don't receive the present truth
[4:45] remember Peter said we must be
[4:46] established in the present truth 2 Peter
[4:49] 1:12 be established in the present truth
[4:53] anyone who studied church history know
[4:55] that the church needed reformed or
[4:57] restored Martin Luther started the
[4:59] Reformation around 1517 ad any honest
[5:02] person can recognize the Reformation
[5:04] what was God doing he was restoring the
[5:06] truth that had been lost throughout the
[5:08] last 1500 years after the day of
[5:10] Pentecost he continued that restoration
[5:13] so more present truth came through John
[5:15] Wesley then more present truth came
[5:18] through austry and William Seymour's
[5:20] move and then the finishing of the
[5:22] mysteries of God was done through God's
[5:24] Prophet William brandham so each move of
[5:26] God had to receive the present truth and
[5:28] so by God's grace we received the
[5:30] present Truth for our day the finished
[5:32] mystery of God that Jesus Christ
[5:34] revealed through his Prophet brother
[5:36] William brandham now a second reason the
[5:38] message has not gone stale after 60
[5:40] years is because the laty and church age
[5:42] is still going on God is still calling
[5:45] people remember Paul's message for his
[5:48] day had to last the entire 117 years of
[5:50] the Ephesian Church age I believe now
[5:52] we're at 118 years for the leian church
[5:54] age if I'm not mistaken so leod deia has
[5:57] lasted longer than Ephesus but the word
[5:59] of of God is still freshh for our day
[6:02] it's very similar to like Noah he
[6:03] preached probably 120 years maybe less
[6:06] we're not certain how many years he did
[6:08] preach and prepare the ark but his
[6:09] message never got stale he was a
[6:11] preacher of righteousness the preaching
[6:14] of righteousness that he preached never
[6:15] got stale it was always fresh and
[6:17] allowed eight souls to be saved by the
[6:19] grace of God a third reason the message
[6:22] is not stale is because it takes a
[6:24] lifetime to learn from Jesus if you read
[6:26] Philippians 4:11 and 12 Paul said he
[6:29] still learning to be content no matter
[6:31] what state he's in and the Bible said we
[6:34] learn through suffering so we have to
[6:35] suffer years decades an entire lifetime
[6:39] that's in Hebrews 5:8 Jesus learned
[6:41] obedience through the things he suffered
[6:43] and that's true for us especially true
[6:45] for us because we still have a sin
[6:47] nature Jesus did not have a sin nature
[6:49] Jesus had a word nature he was the word
[6:51] made flesh John 1
[6:54] ver4 and then 2 Timothy 2:12 says if we
[6:57] suffer we will reign with him so it
[6:59] takes a lifetime of suffering in order
[7:02] to develop Godly character that Jesus
[7:04] can use to Reign during the Millennium
[7:06] and also Reign during the future home
[7:09] God is gracious he gives us all things
[7:11] that pertain unto life and godliness 2
[7:13] Peter 1:3 anything we need to live a
[7:15] good life a Godly life here Jesus
[7:18] promised to give it to us as Peter
[7:20] stated in 2 Peter 1:3 and then he guides
[7:23] us into all truth all the truth that we
[7:25] need to live Godly and holy in this life
[7:28] God gives it to us Jesus promised that
[7:30] in John
[7:31] 16:13 we don't get it all at one time it
[7:34] takes a lifetime of learning a lifetime
[7:36] of suffering so the word of God never
[7:38] goes stale it's constantly giving us
[7:40] life and
[7:42] godliness I'll make a few more points
[7:44] here by God's grace brother Ram said the
[7:45] bride cannot be denominated he said this
[7:48] in spoken words Original Seed she won't
[7:50] be denominated because she's
[7:52] predestinated he said you are not
[7:54] denominated you are Brethren because you
[7:56] can't be denominated you're born sons of
[7:58] God so this shows anyone who has the
[8:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost will not start
[8:02] a denomination a tradition of man Creeds
[8:05] of man they will stay free because
[8:08] they're born again they cannot be
[8:10] deceived the elect cannot be deceived a
[8:13] true
[8:14] rde Hallelujah there's going to be one
[8:17] why she's
[8:19] predestinated she won't be
[8:22] denominated because she's
[8:25] predestinated you don't have to worry
[8:27] about some denomination she's already
[8:28] predestinated take the
[8:31] place it's time to rise ye sons of God
[8:35] in the name of Jesus Christ and rise to
[8:38] a
[8:39] place where you can return in this
[8:41] Jubilee and hear the sound of the
[8:43] trumpet of the Gospel of the word of God
[8:45] ye are
[8:46] Brethren Hall you are not denominated
[8:50] you are Brethren because you can't be
[8:51] denominated you're born sons of God if
[8:55] the slaves want to stay in the wall City
[8:57] let them stay but you are free
[9:00] amen you're free let's go back let's go
[9:03] back to our inheritance let's go back to
[9:05] the beginning back to their led by the
[9:07] inspiration of the Holy
[9:09] Spirit now of course there are deceived
[9:12] preachers who've started their own
[9:14] denominations around the message but the
[9:16] message itself the word itself cannot be
[9:18] denominated these type of men these
[9:20] false teachers have majored on minor
[9:23] doctrines or they've majored on their
[9:25] own false doctrines and they've created
[9:27] their own denominations the traditions
[9:29] of men similar to the seven Thunders
[9:32] movement that came out of New York the
[9:34] Peruan movement the movement that were
[9:36] already in the Millennium or the eighth
[9:38] messenger movement or even recently the
[9:40] tape Church movement press play obey
[9:43] movement that's a man-made denomination
[9:45] I proved that with numerous videos all
[9:47] these false movements have corrupt
[9:49] fruits as well like the tape Church
[9:51] movement they have the love of money and
[9:53] every movement is known by their fruits
[9:56] so all those denominations around the
[9:58] message have corrupt fruits I like what
[10:01] this brother said he said should there
[10:02] be a constant flow and yes there is a
[10:04] constant flow of the Holy Ghost brother
[10:06] Ram said always keep yourself and your
[10:08] family where the spirit of God is
[10:09] pouring out and of course he's talking
[10:11] about a home Church let's listen to that
[10:13] quote so many today you take a a family
[10:16] of people that'll start going church and
[10:20] God will heal the little family he'll
[10:22] bless them and give them the holy spirit
[10:24] in their lives the little children will
[10:26] pray around the table they'll pray
[10:28] before they go to bed mother and father
[10:31] are join hands and pray and as long as
[10:34] they continue like that they'll stay a
[10:36] family but you let them get first thing
[10:39] you know they didn't have nothing an old
[10:41] junk car maybe ride around in or maybe
[10:43] walking finally they'll get a good car A
[10:45] Better Home and the first thing you know
[10:48] then they want to get to what the the
[10:50] world calls a better class to associate
[10:53] with they move into a different
[10:56] neighborhood and in there they find out
[10:58] they become influenced by the wrong
[11:01] influence yes you must always stay where
[11:05] the kingdom of God is and where the
[11:07] glory of God is pouring
[11:10] out stay where you can be spiritually
[11:13] fed day and night
[11:15] amen then the first thing you know
[11:17] separations comes in the home and
[11:19] worldliness and they get lifted up you
[11:23] friends this is true because the
[11:24] fivefold ministry gives us three great
[11:27] purposes of preaching in Ephesians 4 12
[11:30] the perfecting of the Saints that's the
[11:32] equipping of the Saints the work of the
[11:34] ministry that's the work of the service
[11:36] of the ministry so the fivefold ministry
[11:38] equips us with the tools we need helps
[11:41] us to learn to serve and then edifies
[11:43] the body of Christ builds or grows the
[11:46] body of Christ people get saved but we
[11:48] also grow in Grace and knowledge of the
[11:50] Lord Jesus Christ and remember this
[11:53] produces numerous things according to
[11:55] Ephesians 4 a Unity of faith and
[11:57] knowledge it brings us us to a perfect
[12:00] man the measure of the stature of Christ
[12:03] it brings us to maturity we're no more
[12:04] children in Doctrine we're not tossed
[12:06] about by every wind of Doctrine and then
[12:09] we get to speak the truth in love then
[12:11] we get to grow up into him in all things
[12:13] and IT Supplies the needs of the body
[12:16] according to Ephesians
[12:18] 48-16 there's also an awesome quote from
[12:21] the church age book brother Bram says we
[12:22] get more information on the same
[12:24] Revelation just like at Jesus first
[12:26] coming the first 4,000 years of human
[12:30] history there was numerous Revelations
[12:32] about the first coming of Jesus Christ
[12:34] it spread all over the Old Testament
[12:36] books the same is true for the second
[12:38] coming of Jesus Christ all these
[12:40] Revelations are spread all over the New
[12:42] Testament books and then a lot of what
[12:44] was written we're getting fresh
[12:46] Revelation today more information on the
[12:48] same
[12:49] Revelation Paul knew it was God who had
[12:52] spoken to him so he said even if I come
[12:55] and try to give a second Revelation try
[12:57] to make one little change in what I gave
[12:59] originally let me be a cursed you see
[13:02] Paul knew that first revelation was
[13:04] correct God can't give a first
[13:07] revelation then a second Revelation if
[13:09] he did he would be changing his mind he
[13:12] can give a revelation and then add to it
[13:14] as he did in the Garden of Eden when he
[13:17] promised the seed to the woman and then
[13:19] later designated that seed had to come
[13:21] through Abraham and then later said it
[13:24] would come by the same Bloodlines in
[13:26] David but it was the same revelation it
[13:29] only gave the people more information to
[13:31] help them receive and understand it but
[13:34] God's word can't
[13:36] change over the past year you know I've
[13:38] made videos about that how we're getting
[13:40] fresh Revelation my brother Simon has
[13:42] had some wonderful recent Revelations
[13:45] about rebaptism being typed in the Old
[13:48] Testament God gave me a special
[13:50] Revelation showed me the serpent seed is
[13:52] in the Seven Seals it's actually in
[13:54] Revelation CH 5 Jesus being virgin born
[13:58] is able to take the book and loose the
[14:00] Seven Seals that was a beautiful
[14:01] Revelation to me that was fresh Mana to
[14:04] me and of course there are so many more
[14:06] examples I might make a video about that
[14:07] in the future one reason why I love
[14:09] being a message believer is because of
[14:11] all the fresh Mana the fresh Revelation
[14:13] that God pours out to his
[14:15] people in
[14:18] closing friends I hope this video was a
[14:20] blessing by the grace of God this is an
[14:21] excellent question from this brother I
[14:24] appreciate the question hope the answer
[14:26] was sufficient thank God the message of
[14:28] the hour has not gone stale it can never
[14:30] be denominated the bride can never be
[14:32] denominated because the word of God is
[14:34] not bound the Bible says and I'm a
[14:36] living witness that the word of God is
[14:38] constantly revealing itself more
[14:40] information on the same Revelation I'm
[14:43] constantly receiving fresh Mana keeps me
[14:46] strong keeps me encouraged keeps my life
[14:48] clean by the grace of God keeps me
[14:50] Sanctified empowered by the Holy Ghost
[14:53] so let's keep drawing nigh to God and
[14:54] surely he'll keep drawing nigh to us
[14:56] giving us more information on the same
[14:58] revelation a
[14:59] ations if you have any questions
[15:01] concerns or testimonies about this video
[15:03] please contact
[15:04] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[15:07] the desire of your heart
