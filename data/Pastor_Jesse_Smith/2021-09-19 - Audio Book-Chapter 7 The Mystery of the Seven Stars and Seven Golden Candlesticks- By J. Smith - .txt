TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 7 the mystery of the seven stars and seven golden candlesticks chapter seven contains footnotes numbers 972-1166 the mystery of the seven stars which thou sauce in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou saust are the seven churches revelation 1 verse 20. the book of the revelation of jesus christ the climatic finale of the new testament contains the seventh mystery of the seven stars and seven golden candlesticks the number seven is referenced 36 times in revelation as its spiritual meaning is completion genesis 1 shows god creating for six days but completing his work and resting on the seventh the greek meaning of revelation is laying bear disclosure of truth appearance in revelation jesus lays bare or unveils his plan to bring redemption restoration and completion to humanity through seven churches seven spirits seven golden candlesticks seven stars seven lamps of fire seven seals seven horns seven eyes seven trumpets seven angels seven thunders a seventh angel seven thousand men seven heads seven crowns seven last plagues seven golden vials seven mountains seven kings and a seven stone while some shy away from revelation jesus promises blessings upon those who read hear and keep it in its third verse blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand if you are born again you have no fear of misinterpreting revelation because jesus promised his spirit would guide you into all truth through divine inspiration john's writing from the isle of patmos pulls back the curtain to dramatically unveil jesus and his true bride along with lucifer and the false bride the mother harlot at the onset of this chapter i strongly advise you to read william branham's an exposition of the seven church ages for a thorough explanation of revelation chapters one through three i've always considered this book the second most important text i've read outside the holy bible i will share more about this monumental book at the end of the chapter the confusion about the mystery of the seven stars and seven golden candlesticks jesus leaves no confusion about the meaning of the seven stars and seven golden candlesticks because revelation 1 verse 20 declares the stars are angels and the candlesticks are seven churches ephesus smyrna pergamos thyatira sardis philadelphia and laodicea the confusion about the stars and candlesticks centers around two questions what are the identities of the seven star angels and were the messages to the seven churches only for those local churches around 95 a.d or were they prophetic to future ages and generations the revelation of the mystery of the seven stars and seven candlesticks is jesus ordained seven men to declare truth and model holy living during the time of the gentiles or seven church ages scripture and history validate the seven stars or angels our men jesus anointed to let their lights so shine before men in their generations these seven preachers most closely adhered to paul's gospel blueprint the letters to the seven churches apply both to seven local churches but are also prophetic warnings and blessings about the conditions christians would experience in future time periods biblical evidence for the revelation of the seven stars and seven golden candlesticks beginning with the seven stars jesus calls them seven angels but they were seven literal men not heavenly angels the first proof of this is found in revelation 2 verse 1 unto the angel of the church of ephesus write why would jesus tell john to author a handwritten letter to a heavenly angel at ephesus god speaks directly to heavenly angels sending them from his throne to minister to believers who shall be heirs of salvation the lord does not need to write letters to angels the truth is jesus was assigning john to write to an earthly man at ephesus who would preserve the letter for upcoming generations to whom it would also apply to secondly the seven angels are symbolic of human preachers because men are sometimes referred to as angels in scripture the hebrew definition of angel is messenger and jesus appropriately calls john the baptist god's messenger in matthew 11 verse 10. the prophet david is twice called an angel of god in first samuel 29 verse 9 and 2nd samuel 19 27. paul says the galatians received him as an angel of god even as christ jesus in galatians 4 14. a final witness is revelation 22 verses 8 and 9 as the angel sent to john to show him the prophecies was actually a fellow servant of his a prophet who kept the sayings of revelation a third fact is god uses men to help save men angels assist men but men are god's primary tool for sharing his way to salvation romans 10 verse 14 says how shall they hear without a preacher mark 16 20 explains jesus disciples preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following fourthly notice the location of the stars they are in jesus right hand both moses and jesus to find god's right hand as his power and authority strictly reserved for christ and not angels according to hebrews 1 verse 13 but jesus promised men would inherit god's power to witness his resurrection lastly abraham seed faith-filled humans are referred to as stars in genesis 15 verse 5. daniel 12 3 likens the saved and soul winners to stars saying and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever john the baptist god's messenger is likened unto a star a burning light in john 5 35. he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light jesus interprets the seven golden candlesticks as the seven churches of the seven gentile cities located in turkey no jewish churches are mentioned because john wrote this around 95 a.d and god had already blinded israel because of their unbelief and turned to the gentiles nearly 50 years prior jesus christ calls god's focus on saving the gentiles the times of the gentiles in luke 21 24 in matthew 21 verses 33 through 46 jesus plainly teaches he is going to take the kingdom from israel and give it to the gentiles verse 41 says he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasons the wicked men are the jews and the other husbandmen are the gentiles and they render their fruits to jesus in their individual season or church age jesus in luke 21 24 and paul teach the times the gentiles have an ending point paul says god will return to offering the jews the holy ghost kingdom when the fullness of the gentiles become in after the last elected foreign gentile saint is sealed by the holy ghost into the kingdom god raptures the bride church and returns to israel another term for the times of the gentiles is the seven church ages because jesus lists seven churches not less or more and his many member gentile bride is called his church on many occasions but most notably in romans 16 verse 16 ephesians 3 verse 21 and ephesians 5 verses 23 through 32 is the term church ages biblically acceptable yes paul twice says the old testament had ages in ephesians 3 verse 5 and colossians 1 verse 26 and it's apparent the 2000 year new testament time period does also the apostle speaks of future ages beyond his in ephesians 3 verse 21 unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end if there are past and future ages there must always be ages scripture foretells the 2000 year gentile church ages in hosea 6 verses 1-3 come and let us return unto the lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the earth the prophet says god will revive israel on the third day or after two days or two thousand years of dealing with the gentiles one day represents one thousand years in god's sight second peter 3 verse 8 says one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day god will revive the 144 000 israeli remnant with the seal of the holy ghost after he is done with the raptured gentiles in acts 2 verse 17 peter says the spirit will be poured out in the last days or last 2000 years before the great tribulation and millennium paul says in the last days perilous times shall come and the last two thousand years have been extremely dangerous for christians god has blinded israel for the past two thousand years or two days to graft in the gentiles to take a bride for his name's sake our lord likens the seven gentile church ages unto the seven branches of the golden candlestick moses constructed for the tabernacle in the wilderness in exodus chapter 25. six candlesticks proceeded out of the main central candlestick and all seven had lit fiery wicks drenched in the same oil this foretold every church age would burn with the same holy ghost anointing that fell at pentecost as oil represents the holy ghost in zechariah 4 verses 1 through 6. peter guaranteed the oil or gift of the holy ghost was for all seven church ages in acts 2 verses 38 and 39 39 reads for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call each successive church age burns brightly with the light of the holy ghost in revelation 1 verses 13 through 16 jesus's location standing in the midst of the seven candlesticks with the seven stars in his hand proves his constant presence with the one jew gentile church during the seven church ages observed jesus the stars and the candlesticks are associated together in unity the same jesus in his same holy ghost power would be with every church in every age until the end before christ left his disciples he said lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world as god's spirit was with the apostles so it is with believers today christ promised the spirit of truth would dwell with us and in us in john 14 17. three applications for the seven letters john seven letters from jesus to the seven gentile churches have at least three applications applying literally prophetically to the future gentile ages and also to individual christians the seven letters applied literally to christians around 95 a.d john 7 letters applied directly to christians living in the seven gentile cities around 95 a.d for example scripture confirms both ephesus and laodicea had established churches in ephesians 1 verse 1 and colossians 2 verse 1 and colossians 4 verses 13 through 16 respectively all seven cities have historical routes to christianity one notable example is the council of laodicea held in the 4th century jesus knew the exact spiritual conditions of those churches admonishing some while rebuking others john's letters to the seven asian churches seemed to be jesus's final call for them to repent because all asian churches had rejected paul by the end of his ministry which was around 67 a.d this thou knowest that all they which are in asia be turned away from me of whom are figelus and hermogenus here in 95 a.d the gracious savior gives them one final offer to repent the seven letters were prophetic to future ages second the seven letters were prophetic to the future spiritual conditions of the seven church ages revelation 1 verse 3 declares its prophetic nature blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy verse 19 of the same chapter repeats this prophetic aspect write the things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter here you see how john wrote about the current spiritual conditions of those churches in his lifetime yet they foretold future conditions much of the remainder of this chapter shows the divine parallels between seven cities to the seven future ages christians would live through three clear-cut examples prove the seven letters prophesied of future events and conditions first jesus warned the church in smyrna would have tribulation 10 days but must be faithful unto death in revelation 2 verse 10. the 10 days are historically accurate in one or two ways either as the 10 persecutions on the anti-nicean church or diocletian's 10-year persecution beginning with nero and ending with diocletian there were 10 major christian persecutions from 64 a.d to 303 a.d since one day can be symbolic of a year the ten days jesus warned christians about can also be the dreadful decade-long christian persecution initiated by the roman emperor diocletian from 303 to 13 a.d emperor constantine the first is credited with bringing an end to this madness many holy martyrs died but thanks to jesus's warning through john's letter 200 years beforehand their faith unto death attitude inspired christianity to abound even more second jesus foretold there would be an open door missionary age to the church of philadelphia or time period from 1750 to 1906 a.d during this age the world saw the greatest missionary efforts through men like william carey in india and david livingstone in africa the final example is the lukewarm condition of the final church of laodicea which represents today's churches falling away from the faith putting jesus spirit outside of their churches this prompted jesus to ask if he would find faith on the earth at his return in luke 18 verse 8 nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth the seven letters speak prophetically to individuals in all ages the third application of the seven letters is they prophetically speak to both individuals and individual churches in every age every honest christian knows what it's like to desire to return to his first love as taught in the ephesian letter thanks to jesus you know how to return do your first works smyrna's letter inspires today's persecuted christians as jesus says i know thy works and tribulation fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer holy ghost-filled saints from all ages have benefited from laodicea's warning about lukewarmness and constantly strive to be on fire for jesus sake of course first john 3 verse 9 teaches that a born-again believer's soul cannot sin or become lukewarm but we become weary and lukewarm in our minds paul and peter admonish us to stir up our minds which means to kindle up in flame one's mind in the greek individual churches today and throughout history have gone through the ephesus to laodicea cycle with ephesus representing the best condition and laodicea the worst you'll soon see how revivals start with great potential but once organized denominated and limited by man god's spirit departs to the next group and the organized group dies true holiness loving churches have and will remain in the ephesus condition breaking the lukewarm cycle keeping jesus as their first love how the star messengers are identified and their names identifying the seven stars or men anointed by the holy ghost to influence each church age over the past two thousand years is done by this principle god and his ways are unchanging hebrews 13 verses 7 and 8 best express this principle remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever ecclesiastes 3 verses 14 and 15 agrees saying i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and god doeth it that men should fear before him that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and god requireth that which is past and of course malachi 3 verse 6 reads for i am the lord i change not our unchanging god has and always will choose and equip one man to lead and influence the rest of his church age with god's revealed word he is the one major leader who teaches other local leaders who then lead their people paul taught this pattern to timothy in 2 timothy 2 verses 1 and 2. thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also indeed he is the star in jesus's nail-scarred hand observing old testament history you find seth leading the way for the godly seed to praise and seek god that lasted until god chose noah to influence his age via warning of oncoming destruction followed by abraham moses and joshua among others even in the days of the judges god followed this pattern when the spirit of the lord came upon athnil to lead israel delivering them from their enemies sadly after the death of each judge israel would backslide into sin and bondage until the people would cry out to god for deliverance graciously the lord would send them another deliverer a similar pattern exists in the new testament church ages as each messenger came on the scene at the beginning of the church age with the purpose of bringing revival to the people and in the later church ages restoration each star messenger meets three requirements exemplified by paul's ministry true teaching of god's word powerful manifestations of the written and spoken word and soul winning using paul's life he was true to the word christ revealed to him even correcting peter when he erroneously disassociated himself from fellowship with gentiles paul said anyone who altered the gospel was accursed and charged timothy to invest all his time in rightly dividing the word of truth any spiritual person according to paul would recognize god's word came to him and thus should be obeyed what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord holy ghost power in the form of the written and spoken word constantly flowed from paul's life as seen in him casting out devils loudly instructing an impotent man to walk for the first time and raising uticus from the dead paul's written word was just as powerful authoring most of the new testament and causing the corinthians to repent in godly sorrow from his written rebukes in 2 corinthians 7 verses 8 through 12 no one can calculate how many souls paul led to christ but there is undoubtedly much fruit to his ministry in this area paul knew he was nothing behind the very chiefest apostles having labored more than any other possible through three grueling missionary trips the apostle told his corinthian converts they were the seal of his apostleship in the lord and informed both the philippians and thessalonians they were his joy and crown paul said he had godly jealousy over his converts desiring their chaste virginity to christ while making mention of them in every prayer soul winning mattered more to paul than money and every worldly temptation as church history demonstrates jesus's seven star messengers to each church age who met the three major requirements are ephesus paul 5 to 67 a.d smyrna iranius 130 to 202 a.d pergamos martin 315 to 399 a.d thyatira columba 521 to 597 a.d sardis martin luther 1483 to 1546 a.d philadelphia john wesley 1703 to 1791 a.d laodicea william branham 1909 to 1965 a.d how the dates and lengths of the church ages are determined the following dates and lengths of the seven church ages are approximate determined by matching jesus's seven city descriptions with major events in church history figure 19 shows clarence larkin and william branham agree on most dates and lengths with slight differences between ephesus philadelphia and laodicea note also the star messengers ministered during the beginning of their respective church ages as proof of god's longsuffering allowing time for their revivals and revelations to fully spread the ephesian church age lasted from about 53 a.d to 170 a.d its starting point was paul's three-year ministry in ephesus in which many received the baptism of the holy ghost the ephesian church was founded on paul's third missionary journey along with churches in philippi thessalonica berea and corinth among others detailed in acts chapters 16-20 ephesus means permitted in the greek and larkin adds the synonymous phrase to relax to its definition which matches jesus's main concern for this age this age started in great zeal but decades later many left their first love the sumerian church age began around 170 a.d and ended about 312 a.d smyrna means myrrh in the greek which speaks to mer's use as a costly perfume and embalming antiseptic mer's connection with death aligns perfectly with jesus's prophecy that this time period would be an age of martyrs be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life this age fittingly began with the martyrdom of justin martyr and his six disciples and ended with the gruesome 10-year christian persecution under diocletian beginning in 303 the pergamine age lasted from around 312 a.d to about 606 a.d it began with emperor constantine the first reign over the western empire which later expanded to the entire roman empire in 324 a.d as jesus foretold in revelation 2 verse 14 many in this age would succumb to an unholy religious union similar to the one of balaam and balak the union of church and state false christianity in rome united with constantine who stopped christian persecution donated property to christians and had many churches constructed however he remained a murderer as he had his eldest son and wife killed after his supposed conversion constantine's conversion to christianity then was likely false and incomplete the thighterian age was the longest age beginning around 606 a.d and finishing about 1520 a.d thyatira means odor of affliction in the greek and christian persecution long lingered during the dark or middle ages pope boniface iii's acceptance of the title universal bishop in 606 a.d signaled the beginning of the darkest time period in church history as the jezebel spirit took the roman church to the depths of satan through fornication idolatry and many more doctrines of devils it is my humble opinion that the thyrotyrin age began earlier though around 560 a.d in order to allow for its star messenger columba to have labor during its time period additionally a holy ghost and power movement in frygea from 560 to 565 resembled the day of pentecost as all nine gifts of the spirit were honored and operated it seems likely thyatira began with a revival just as laodicea began with the 1906 azusa street revival the sardis church age began around 1520 a.d and stopped about 1750 a.d on october 30th 1517 martin luther nailed his 95 theses to the church door in wittenberg germany beginning the protestant reformation period but it was three years later in 1520 when he published three great documents which laid down the fundamental principles of the reformers as jesus said only a few names in sardis had not defiled their garments this was a difficult age wherein many fell away from their faith after the deaths of reformers like luther zwingli and calvin the time period of brotherly love the philadelphian age started around 1750 a.d and lasted until 1906 a.d this age labeled as the open door age by christ saw men like george whitfield john wesley william carey and david livingstone evangelized the world teaching saints to keep jesus's word name and patience just as seasons slowly transitioned from one to the next the philadelphian age had a first sign of spring in 1739 when whitefield's first american preaching tour providentially and supernaturally began in philadelphia pennsylvania the final and current age laodicea began around 1906 and continues today with the rapture as its unknown ending point the 1906 azusa street revival indicated a new age as the gifts of the spirit were restored as god promised in joel 2 25 and i'll restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you sadly pentecostals in all denominations and independence have grown lukewarm upon jesus's word and spirit wanting no more bible revelation and kicking jesus out of their churches yet our merciful messiah still stands at their doors knocking trying to enter with loving rebukes chastening and fellowship the gaining losing and restoring of truth during the church ages before digging into specific church history by age it's imperative to see god's design for giving and restoring truth to the seven church ages although god is unchanging he never said the church was no the church would have change because it would be persecuted afflicted and tested but this was done to strengthen the faithful few allowing them to truly know christ in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings since the church loved christ and wanted to reign with him it was necessary for her to suffer like him the seven stars or messengers are called thus because of the profound spiritual darkness upon the earth jesus specifically called paul the star messenger to the ephesian age a light to the gentiles to turn them from darkness to light spiritual darkness or life under satan's power has covered earth since the fall as he is the god of this world but due to increased iniquity and deception darkness grows increasingly black during the spiritual nighttime of the past 2000 years of gentile church ages remember the end time is a spiritual blackout as revelation 18 verse 3 and 18 verse 23 say all nations will be deceived by the beast and false prophets religious system in every age though jesus promised his followers light in john 8 verse 12 i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life scripture proves the early church began with the full written word and power of the holy ghost and the final true church in the laodicean age albeit a very small minority will have it all restored before the rapture logically in between the beginning and end would be a time where the church lacked the fullness of word and power holy ghost power was at its fullness at pentecost for not long afterwards the spirit led peter to pronounce a lame man healed peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk peter had divine power given to him by jesus joyfully the healed man leaped walked and praised god and these types of miracles followed all the apostles for they were given great power as witnesses of the resurrection of the lord jesus peter later wrote that god had given believers not some but all things that pertain unto life and godliness before leaving ephesus after a three-year apostleship there paul said he had declared to them all the counsel of god in acts 20 verse 27 while not all churches had all of paul's epistles the four gospels and the rest of the new testament canon at first the born-again believers had the holy ghost baptism which jesus said guided them into all truth in john 16 13. before jesus returns to rapture his bride he must restore all things the church had at pentecost jesus was the first to prophesy this end time restoration in matthew 17 verse 11 and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things note that jesus says a man anointed with the spirit of elijah would restore all things this man could not be elijah the tishbite back from the dead to restore moses law because hebrews 8 13 says the law has decayed waxed old and vanished away for good the elijah jesus is speaking of then has to restore the new testament truths chapter 13 details this revelation peter also prophesied of restitution or restoration in acts 3 verses 20 through 21 and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which god has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began heaven will keep jesus until all things are restored then christ will physically return to earth for his bride joel 2 verses 23-26 promises that the power of the holy ghost will be restored through the spiritual wine and oil of the former and latter reigns be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the laddering in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil and i'll restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed furthermore combining daniel 12 verse 4 and 12 verse 9 with revelation 10 verses 7 through 11 and matthew 24 14 you find full support for the same conclusion the end of human history cannot come until the mystery of god is finished and preached in all the world for witness unto all nations this can only happen in the technology age for daniel said the book would be sealed until the time of the end when knowledge shall be increased in between the beginning and end of the seven church ages would be a time of loss ecclesiastes 3 verse 6 teaches there is a time to get and a time to lose many truths and the glory from pentecost would fade in the first four ages but restoration would begin in the fifth and sixth jesus says the believers in the fourth age thyatira would have to overcome the depths of satan proving this age was a low point of truth and power just as john 12 24 likens jesus unto a corn of wheat that had to fall into the ground and die in order to bring forth more fruit the true church would experience the same it would slowly die and lose truth and power through the first four ages but in the fifth age the sardisian age of the reformation the seed would spring forth in strength as god began incrementally restoring truth then in the final age the laodicean age all things would be restored reading revelation chapters 2 and 3 you see jesus addressing two vines or two groups in every age workers of righteousness and workers of iniquity both are religious but only the righteous true vine overcomes satan's temptations throughout the ages starting with the ephesian age most worshipers left their first love and needed to repent but the true vine hated the deeds of the nicolaitans that the religious false vine had adopted in the second age jesus instructed the true vine in smyrna to not fear the persecution coming from the false vine the false church progressed from hateful deeds into a full synagogue for satan the third age pergamos shows jesus having a few things not just one thing against the true vine showing their decline in faith meanwhile the false vine had fully erected a seat for satan in the third tyran age the fourth age containing the dark ages the true vine increased their works but christ still had a few things against them such as allowing the jezebel spirit to teach and seduce his servants jesus simply said hold fast what they already had they had lost much of what pentecost had had and it was not the hour for restoration the false vines jezebel-like doctrines took it into the depths of satan making this the darkest age of all it is undeniable that rome took away the privilege of simply knowing and reading scripture from millions alexander hislop writes in the hands of roman priests that ushered in the dark ages when through many a dreary century the gospel was unknown and the bible a sealed book to millions who bore the name of christ thyatira was an age of great loss the fifth age sardis begins a hopeful restoration for the believing remnant known as the reformation the reformation was possible because the gutenberg press produced millions of bibles translated by godly men and placed truth in many believers hands for the first time jesus admonishes a few worthy undefiled saints to be watchful strengthen the things which remain hold fast and to repent notice jesus saying there are only a few worthy believers in the entire age proving the massive decrease of true believers the false vine adopted religious names but were spiritually dead there was more growth or truth in the sixth age the philadelphian age for the true vine had a little strength to walk through jesus's open door and work for his name believers kept jesus's word and name and christ made the false vine in satan's synagogue bow at the feet of their open door ministry the last stage laodicea sees a huge spiritual decline into materialism and lukewarmness and the false vine removes jesus from their churches altogether christ urges the true vine to zealously repent these overcomers inspired by the message of restoration by spiritual gold and white raiment from jesus and anoint their eyes with eyes out to become hot or on fire for christ right before the rapture historical evidence and revelations for the seven stars and seven golden candlesticks the church history of the past two thousand years validates and parallels jesus's prophetic promises regarding the seven church ages in jesus's seven addresses he reveals aspects of his divinity his messages to both vines and rewards for the overcomers the ephesian church age 53 to 170 in revelation 2 verses 1-7 star paul is the angel star to the first age he identified 9 out of 12 mysteries and authored 14 of the 27 new testament books far more than any other man first corinthians 15 verse 10 says god's grace enabled paul to labor more than any other apostle jesus was going to use paul's gospel to judge the secrets of men and curses come upon anyone who changes the gospel christ gave to him not only did peter submit to paul's face-to-face rebuke about his discrimination against gentiles but peter acknowledged paul's letters were scripture in second peter 3 verses 15 and 16. some may argue that paul cannot be the angel to this age because he wasn't alive at the time jesus gave this revelation to john around 95 a.d while it is true that paul died around 67 a.d his legacy is immeasurable far exceeding any other man due to his mission work and doctrinal revelations also god often sends messengers who are not recognized until after they die as in the case of john the baptist jesus told his disciples that elias or john the baptist had already come and they had not recognized him in matthew 17 verses 12 and 13. it would fit jesus's pattern to send paul as an angel messenger but not make it known to others until after paul went to heaven as evidence paul is the star messenger to this age his epistles teach exactly the same message jesus gives to the true vine in this age work and labor for christ flee all appearances of evil hate evil test self-labeled apostles to prove them be patient repent and renew yourself daily christ divinity jesus begins his address to his churches by showing his omnipotence omnipresence and sovereignty he holds the seven star angels in his right hand symbolizing the authority and power he has given them god's son walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks showing his unchanging presence in every age as he says in hebrews 13 verse 5 i will never leave thee nor forsake thee he is with you just as he was with paul peter and all other saints message to the true vine our lord tells this age he knows their works tireless labor and patience for his name's sake the true vine could not bear evil ones and tried self-exalted liars and found them to be false apostles in love christ rebukes his church for leaving their first love but provides the simple way back repentance through doing the first works just as paul's ministry matches jesus's message to the ephesian age the life of polycarp 60 to 160 the greek bishop does the same learning at the feet of the apostle john polikarp deeply loved our lord jesus and became head of the church at smyrna at a young age polycarp could not bear false teachers and tried them as he would not even talk with marcion and valentinian who were the great roman leaders of false doctrine at the time even at 90 years of age polycarp determined to travel more than 1 500 miles to plead with anicetus the bishop of the first church in rome to repent of his participation in pagan easter celebrations in every city he visited while approaching rome he preached christ and saw miracles and healings once in rome polycarp visited the first church and witnessed their worship of images peter and the eucharist after anaicetus refused correction palakkar visited the second and third churches of rome and saw god pour out rome's last recorded revival the sick were healed demons cast out and dead were raised to life before leaving polycarp also brought many of the straying valentinians and the martianites out of false doctrine and into truth their first love polycarp returned to smyrna and eventually turned himself into the pagans demanding his life in order to spare other christians lives he was burned to death and as a testimony of how christ-like polycarp was the pagans would not allow his disciples to have his corpse because they said the disciples would claim he had revived and raised from the dead like the master christ at jerusalem so they flayed the flesh from the bones then ground the bones to powder and cast the ashes over a running stream yet the true vine had to diligently examine itself to be sure it was keeping its first love edmund broadbent writes as the churches increased the first zeal flagged and conformity to the world and its ways increased also every age must battle and overcome spiritual complacency in 156 a.d montanus who might have been saved under polycarp's ministry protested against the prevailing laxity in the relations of the church to the world the true vine repented and did the first works to return to their first love iniquity of the false vine by satan's design vast numbers of lying false prophets rose up in the first age as john recognized there were many antichrists in 1st john 2 verse 18. though jesus called for their repentance the false vine grew in sinful hateful deeds after first receiving the gospel around 36 a.d from the apostles andronicus and junia the first church in rome fell away during a 13-year period 41-54 a.d in which faithful apostles were banned from the city with the faithful expelled worship of baal and ashtaroth flourished in the midst of the lukewarm church members when the apostles returned the pagan infused church repulsed them consequently jesus removed his candlestick or spirit-filled preaching ministry from the first church in rome as he had warned in this ephesian age jesus says he and the true vine hate the deeds of the nicolaitans observe these are deeds which are defined as acts undertakings in the greek lexicon these common undetected deeds would later advance to become official universal doctrines in the pergamian age revelation 2 verse 15 but in the first age satan deceived immature believers with seemingly harmless deeds the word nicolaitans might refer to a heretical group who followed a man named nicholas who were given over to prostitution but i found only one reference for this theory one certain meaning is found in the greek meaning of nicolas which is victor of the people satan will get victory over the people through religious leaders legalizing sinful deeds in churches jesus warned this age that the majority of religious people would be conquered by allowing sinful deeds into their worship james 1 verses 14 and 15 lists sin's progression but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death beginning in 41 a.d the first church of rome slowly and consistently added pagan deeds into their worship until they rejected the traditional holy passover observance fully embracing the pagan easter feast of ishtar when polycarp arrived around 150 a.d the faithful bishop also detested their wicked deeds of idolizing statues and eucharist worship the evil deed of changing water baptism since there is only one baptism also took place in the ephesian age as the first century document the ddj records the document seventh chapter removes the name of the lord jesus christ at baptism substituting the titles in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit five examples from the book of acts show baptism should be performed in the literal name of the lord jesus christ the ddj also adds the false deed of pouring water or sprinkling at baptism but scripture shows only full immersion in water is god's acceptable baptismal deed truly changing one word about water baptism would eventually lead to many more doctrinal changes causing spiritual death in the false vine the devil also conquered the people by the deed of exalting the clergy above the laity clergymen were given more power than allotted by god ignatius who died early in the second century erd by giving to the bishop of prominence and authority not only unknown in the new testament but also beyond what was claimed by clement hebrews 13 verses 7 and 8 and 13 17 teach god called men rule in the church but only by the revealed word of god the bible however men in the ephesian age had already begun leading by their own tenants rather than the word and jesus hated it the reward jesus promises overcomers in the ephesian age the blessing of eating from the tree of life in the midst of the paradise of god in the new jerusalem christ the tree of life will give his words for food as a spiritual partaking of the one and only life eternal life justin martyr will enjoy the reward of eating from the tree of life like spring blends into summer the church ages gradually overlap as seen through justin's martyrdom around 165 a.d as the ephesian age transitioned into the sumerian the foretold persecution increased justin and his six disciples boldly defied the emperor and were beheaded for refusing to sacrifice to the gods being threatened with death justin overcame with these words through prayer we can be saved on account of our lord jesus christ even when we have been punished because this shall become to us salvation and confidence at the more fearful and universal judgment seat of our lord and savior the sumerian church age 170-312 in revelation 2 verses 8 through 11 star irenaeus is the star messenger to the second age he was born in greece and became the bishop of lions having learned the gospel from polycarp hazeltine writes the churches in france had all the gifts of the holy spirit operating through iranius's teaching including speaking in tongues healings and miracles such as the dead being raised it is important to note iranians had the true understanding of the godhead which would soon be lost even to genuine believers until its restoration in the end time irania said god was not beings but one being with numerous titles all the other expressions likewise bring out the title of one and the same being as for example the lord of powers the father of all god almighty the most high the creator the maker and such like these are not the names and titles of a succession of different beings but of one and the same by means of which the one god and father is revealed he who contains all things and grants to all the boon of existence the sumerian star is known for perpetually resisting the bishops of rome like victor and zephariinus because of their idolatrous practices irenaeus combated many heresies and authored one celebrated an extremely influential tract called against heresies john fox on page 717 of his classic text fox's book of martyrs said iranius's writings pointed to no transubstantiation concerning the lord's supper irenaeus's battle against victor bishop of the first church in rome to keep easter a pure worship feast led to his martyrdom victor influenced septimius cerverus to behead iranians in 202 a.d iranis teachings on authentic christianity salvation the gifts of the spirit and godhead along with his staunch stand against the first roman church make him an obvious choice for star of the sumernian age christ's divinity our lord builds upon his divine description by saying he is the first and the last which was dead and is alive jesus reveals his deity to submirna showing he was before all things as the beginning of the creation of god jesus is the one true god and there is none beside him trust jesus because he existed before you he preserves your life now and he promises you grace for the day of judgment and a home in the new jerusalem for the last eternal day the messiah says he was dead but is now alive he resurrected conquering the grave in order to give us both a natural and a spiritual resurrection if we die before the rapture our bodies will rise in resurrection power at the meeting in the air but jesus offers a spiritual resurrection now paul says christ resurrects our lives which were dead in sins and trespasses making us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus jesus describes it best in his parable of the prodigal son returning to the father's house thy brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found you can be alive now spiritually with a promise for your body to live again in the first resurrection message to the true vine christ knows the works tribulation and poverty of this age and tells the saints to be faithful unto death the lord says fear not those things which thou shalt suffer which includes a 10-day period of tribulation jesus's timely warning of persecution fits smyrna since it means myrrh in the greek myrrh is a gum associated with death being used for embalming dead bodies and mingled with wine and offered to the dying this was the age of increased martyrdom jesus says be faithful unto death not until death emphasizing many believers would have to seal their testimony as martyrs although the first church of rome was growing in corruption and evil power god's anointing strengthened many to resist unto death and overcome torture men like erranus tertullian origen and novatianus are credited with defying rome's iniquity and they often paid the price with their blood being faithful unto death tertullian 155 to 230 a.d was a lawyer in rome before being converted through the evangelistic efforts of the second church of rome he saw the evangelist montanus and his disciples performed miracles in a holy ghost revival this experience led tertullian to receive the holy ghost baptism during that time after his new birth tertullian influenced believers through teaching and writing and in 197 he condemned baptizing the dead and baptizing infants tertullian took the bishop brick in carthage around 207 separating from rome and its challenges and became a great leader in the african churches while visiting one of tertullian's prayer meetings navocianus received the pentecostal gift of the holy ghost which changed the whole course of his life another visitor origen met with tertullian before going to rome in hopes of restoring them to the apostolic ministry on origen's trip home from rome he informed tertullian an even worse spiritual condition existed in rome than he had previous thought due to their adoption of many pagan customs tertullian believed the church should be holy and clean zealous of good works he even traveled to france to plead for iranius's life though unsuccessfully the first church of rome called tertullian a heretic for frequently exposing their devilish doctrines in his writings which were burned by rome not long after his death not all of tertullian's doctrines are accepted by christians such as the three-person trinity around 180 tertullian was first recorded using the latin form of trinity and theophilus was first to use the greek form calling god three persons does not eternally condemn a person's soul but it does show a huge step out of god's word and the original revelation given to paul and all other new testament authors however it is undeniable that tertullian defied rome's pagan corruption inspired many believers to live holy and pleaded for the life of this age's star irenaeus tertullian stumble into the unscriptural belief in a three-person god is evidence that each age lost some of the original apostolic revelation like a withering wheat plant but in this current laodicean age god has restored the revelation of his divine oneness origin 185 185-254 is called one of the greatest teachers as one of the most spiritually minded of the fathers at 17 years old he witnessed his father's arrest and martyrdom for christ and would have joined him had it not been for his mother who hid his clothes to keep him from leaving his house on a trip to rome he witnessed filthy deeds firsthand like bishops and priests taking bribes to forgive sins blackmail adulteries and more origen wrote rome did not wish to retain the scriptures in their hearts so god gave them a strong delusion that they might believe a lie a great gift origin left to the churches was his list of martyrs in rome peter's name is not on the list giving many confidence that peter was not the first pope like tertullian some of origin's beliefs are denounced by christians today but he sealed his testimony as a martyr at tyree and upon his death his writing on rome's martyrs became very precious to the saints second in their hearts behind the word of god novatianus 189-253 was an evangelical christian who opposed the pagan forms of the bishop of the first roman church he became bishop of the second church of rome ordained by another martyr fabian god bless their church with tongues prophecy and the dead being raised to life cyprian was one of his adversaries accusing novatianus of forsaking the mother church or first church of rome the power of the holy ghost was changing lives in rome's second church and the first church of rome despised it they called on the emperors to rid the city of novatianus and god's move which was accomplished in 251 novatianus and his church fled but god used it to spread his gospel to the far corners of the empire with novatianus's apostle heart he helped start evangelical churches all over the roman empire in 253 novatianus gave his life for jesus christ earning the martyr's crown of eternal life iniquity of the false vine jesus summarizes the false vines iniquity by rebuking their blasphemy synagogue of satan imprisonments trials and 10-day persecution of the saints like the nicolaitans of the first age and antipas of the third age there is little historical information about the lying group of false jews of this second age however jesus says they the false fine were claiming to be jews in order to gain preeminence as the original church at pentecost the holy ghost first filled jews like peter and mary and so the false vine pretended to be jews they blasphemed god and the true vine through their lies and were jews by name only no they were not jews by natural birth nor were they spiritual jews by spiritual birth a fascinating fact is that jesus called them the literal synagogue of satan meaning this group no longer hid their murderous ways like cain this false vine was full of satanic hatred for the true vine for the false vine will always hate and kill the true vine the seemingly harmless deeds of the first age had now advanced into a completely sin saturated satan seduced synagogue of sinister souls in the second chief of satan synagogues was the first church of rome polycarp's trip to rome to correct their heirs allowed him to witness their worship service first hand the lady came in lighting candles and placing them before a statue of saint peter while prostrating themselves adding to this idolatry they participated in pagan easter celebrations accepted bribes legalized adulteries and committed blackmail the clergy were exalted above the laity by their power to manifest transubstantiation the changing of common bread and wine into the literal body and blood of christ with idolatry and lies like these satan succeeded in creating his own synagogue a man-made organization fully devoid of bible truth on page 151 in hazelton's writing about tertullian's time period the first church of rome grew through the aid of the emperors rome's evil bishops would report names of genuine christians who opposed them to the emperors who would have them exiled or killed the emperors were murderous and the bishops of the first roman church loved it so carnal pretend christians of the false vine always kill the saints of the true galatians 4 verse 29 reads but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now yes the saints of the submerging age were hunted down imprisoned put on trial and martyred for jesus sake the false vine continually increased their brutality so much so that tertullian was said to have used his astute skills as a lawyer to plead many times for the lives of christians on trial ten roman emperors nero trajan hadrian aurelius severus maximum decius valerian aurelian diocletian initiated 10 awful persecutions upon christians with diocletians being the worst and lasting 10 years the 10 years of extreme violence occurred through diocletian's for edicts an issue to tear down the churches to the foundations and destroy the sacred scriptures by fire and commanding also that those who were in honorable stations should be degraded if they persevered in their adherence to christianity the order that the bishops presbyters and deacons should be imprisoned the order that the bishops and other clergymen should be tortured and compelled by every means to sacrifice the order that the laity should be tortured the atrocious cruelty with which these edicts were enforced and the vast numbers of those who suffered for the faith are attested by usabias and the acts of the martyrs we read even of the massacre of the whole population of a town because they declared themselves christians the rewards our savior offers two rewards for overcomers the crown of life and escape from the second death while every reward uniquely matches its respective age every overcomer from every age inherits all the rewards revelation 21 verse 7 promises he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son every overcomer gets an incorruptible crown of life because they overcame death's corruptable rewards during their earthly journey millions upon millions earned the crown of life as a martyr in the sumerian age but paul says there is a crown for all who love jesus's appearing in second timothy 4 verse 8. henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing jesus wore a crown of thorns so that you could wear a crown of life if jesus could patiently endure the most brutal death imaginable and sumerian saints like justin martyr iranius origen and novatianus could endure their persecutions you can patiently suffer through your tests james 1 verse 12 teaches your blessing will be the magnificent crown of life blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he has tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him overcomers are not her of the second death which takes place in the lake of fire based upon revelation 20 verse 14 and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death the first death is the end of natural life on earth one's deceased the body decays and loses its form so the second death is the end of spiritual life the life of the soul and the unbeliever's soul will lose its form and vanish away completely sinful souls have an ending point and will come to total annihilation ceasing to exist you have likely been told souls are tormented without end but that is a very shallow belief that god's word quickly rectifies without devoting substantial time to this point start with combining the truths from first john 3 15 and revelation 21 verse 8 that say murders do not possess eternal life and will burn in the lake of fire without eternal life which is the spirit of jesus christ murderers cannot burn or suffer eternally without end wicked ones may burn for millions of years or longer but at some point they will cease to exist consider how shallow it is to designate eternal life to a location heaven instead of a person for christ is the person of eternal life eternal life is not a place you go to rather it is a spirit that comes to live in you additionally if a sinner is going to burn eternally then he already has the same kind of life you have but you know the heir of that thinking jesus's life inside you is what makes you eternally different than a sinner romans 8 verse 10 declares and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness the sumerian saints receive the second life eternal life in their lifetimes which is the same life you receive because you surrendered your earthly life for jesus purpose being born again the holy ghost in your soul is in earnest or down payment in the greek lexicon of eternal life second corinthians 1 verse 22 declares jesus spirit has also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts the second death cannot hurt you because you already possess a portion of unending life look at jesus's claim that real believers pass from death to life in john 5 24 verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life all fear is gone because your soul possesses an earnest of the second life eternal life the pergamy in church age 312 to 606 in revelation 2 verses 12-17 star martin of tours is the angel star to the pergamian age who was trained in the gospel under hillary of poitiers in france hillary filled martin's mind with apostolic teaching straight from scripture as he was not under rome's influence after the lord led martin into his individual ministry he helped his pagan mother and sister convert to christianity martin built both a school and chapel for prayer and numerous men of god were sent forth from these institutions by the holy spirit to do great works in jesus name god performed many mighty signs and miracles in martin's ministry as he dedicated himself to study prayer and fasting the laws of nature were defied to vindicate martin's stand against idolatry doors supernaturally opened solely by god's power golden light shone from his body and the dead were raised to life hazelton writes that martin's life from conversion to death was one constant miracle full of god's love martin traveled over 300 miles to plead with spanish bishops for the life of his friend martin refused any fellowship with evil men promoting the first church of rome he saw how rome's man-made creeds which allowed idolatry killing lies and more left the roman church powerless in the holy spirit after martin's death many sick touched his tomb and were healed just as god honored elisha's bones in second kings 13 21 margin was not canonized by rome but certainly by god christ's divinity jesus reveals himself as he which hath the sharp sword with two edges his third revelation of his deity is his identity as the word scripture verifies jesus is the word the word is a sword the word proceeds out of his mouth like a sword and his name is the word of god you cannot separate jesus from the word for they are one and the same the word is also truth according to john 17 verse 17 and jesus calls the holy spirit the spirit of truth in john 14 verse 17. the world which includes iniquity working church members and sinners cannot receive the holy spirit because they disobey god's word yet the disobedient own bibles just like the pharisees own scrolls but manifest they are not god's children by blaspheming the true understanding of the word john 8 47 says he that is of god heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god the holy spirit gives a true interpretation of the word to every age and the bride or true church of jesus from each age hears it and speaks the same truth revelation 2 verse 17 says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and revelation 22 17 says and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely christ is the word and his bride always believes him and speaks his truth like martin and the pergamian saints message to the true vine jesus knows the true vines works dwelling place their grip on his name and stand for his faith even unto martyrdom he commands some of the true vine to repent for holding two false doctrines balaam and nicolaitans certainly the leading men of this age like hillary martin and patrick never agreed with those lies the balaam and nicolaitan doctrines and the false vine who propagated them will be covered in the next section genuine christian flocks labored on in jesus name throughout europe asia and africa despite rome being overcome with wolves in sheep's clothing working iniquity the true vine was zealous of good works knowing they were created in christ jesus unto good works they had read faith without works is dead in james 2 26 and their faith worked by love as this would be the age in which the false church united with the roman state exponentially growing in wealth power and influence broadbent notes how the true vine continued to exist by the power and simplicity of the written word there remained however through all these times one thing capable of bringing about restoration the presence of the scriptures in the world supplied the means which the holy spirit could use in the hearts of men with a power able to overcome air and bring them back to divine truth and there never cease to be congregations true churches which adhere to the scriptures as the guide of faith and doctrine and the pattern both for individual conduct and for the order of the church these though hidden and despised yet exercised an influence that did not fail to bear fruit in every dwelling place of the true vine jesus's presence dwelt there as well he blessed their works as they held on to his name and received his faith human faith is never enough as paul says he lived by jesus's faith not his in galatians 2 verse 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me peter teaches miracles and all works of faith are done through jesus's name and by jesus's faith in acts 3 verse 16. and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom he see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all saint patrick of ireland 372-461 whose given name was suckat is a saint from the pergamian age who held onto jesus's name and kept his faith patrick was robbed of his childhood and he and his two sisters were kidnapped and sold as slaves with patrick being taken to northern ireland to herd swine it was there he repented being converted by god's spirit upon returning home to his mother in france he enrolled in his uncle martin's bible school this is the same martin of tours who was the star messenger of this age patrick grew in grace and faith having gods leading to take the gospel to ireland where he once worked as a slave he and other ministers did just that and witnessed the holy ghost through many miraculous acts one barbarian chief witnessed so many miracles through patrick's life that he and his entire household repented and received christ just as jesus promised in mark 16 verse 18 patrick took up serpents and was not hurt he laid his hands on the sick and they recovered by jesus faith just as his uncle martin did patrick was once approached by an embassy from rome to visit rome but he refused knowing their wickedness it is believed the entire island received the pure gospel of the lord jesus christ through patrick's efforts sadly one hundred thousand of patrick's spiritual children were slaughtered through the efforts of roman jesuits in 1640 but their genuine faith in jesus name undoubtedly provided them a place in glory upon their martyrdoms iniquity of the false vine christ knows satan's seat of habitation and hates his two devilish doctrines balaam and nicolaitans satan's earthly seat or headquarters had three locations genesis 10 verse 10 shows it began in modern iraq in the land of shinar and became known as the kingdom of babel hislop says satan's seat moved to pergamos when the babylonian pontiff atlas iii was expelled from iraq by the medo-persian kings atlas iii reigned in pergamos from 138 to 133 bc and at his death bequeathed the province to rome antipas the faithful martyr was slain with other saints in pergamos satan's temporary seat satan's third and final seat became rome in this church age as predicted by john identifying mystery babylon as the city on seven hills in revelation 17 verses 5 through 9. this took place when constantine the first moved rome's capital to constantinople in 330 signaling the empire's weakened civil authority and the strengthening of its papal authority with the empire civil authority out of rome the city's religious authority grew vested in the first church of rome the ancient roman empire fell in the 5th century but its papal empire began to rise fulfilling revelation 13 verses 1-3 ancient pagan rome was the beast out of the sea whose one head was wounded but healed when pagan rome fell in the 5th century everyone thought the beast was dead but it lives to this day in papal rome the roman catholic church see chapter 9. this age's first hateful doctrine the doctrine of balaam imitates balaam's teaching who infamously caused israel to stumble into idolatry and fornication at bail pior in numbers chapters 22 through 25 jesus warns that some in the new testament church would join themselves to idolatry and fornication in numbers 25 a group of israelis attend a balaam designed moabite sponsored feast and stumbled in the sins of fornication and idolatry biopior was an immoral union of two groups note that moses aaron phineas and other faithful jews never attended god's anger was kindled against the israeli compromisers and 24 000 died in the judgment plague the new testament's immoral union was the church uniting with the roman state during constantine the first reign like moses despised baal pior and never joined them the true vine never united with rome but many left the true churches to unite with the roman state in 312 a.d constantine had a spiritual experience a dream or vision of jesus's cross which led him to a military victory the next year his edict of mylon freed christians from persecution and began rome's evolution into a so-called christian state constantine's early work for christians included donating lavish buildings and erecting beautiful edifices for worship courtesy of the state instead of sharing in the poverty of christ which included small group gatherings in humble homes and cottage prayer meetings the false church inherited royal palaces and gorgeous assembly halls attracting lukewarm believers instead of spirit-filled saints sadly constantine either never heard the true gospel or rejected it because his life bore many corrupt fruits one he never corrected the first church of rome it was already a pagan organization only with a christian name before this time the first church was already committing the following wickedness among others statue and eucharist worship transubstantiation bribery adulteries infant baptisms and baptizing the dead herein is fulfilled jesus is rebuked to this balaam doctrine as idolatry and sexual sin was permitted hazelton writes the first church of rome continued to develop unobserved by constantine 2 he exalted himself as the 13th apostle yet his compromise with the first church of rome and lack of signs of an apostle make him unfit of this self-imposed title second corinthians 12 verse 12 reads truly the signs of an apostle were raw among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds 3. he had his eldest son and wife murdered in constantinople while he was way celebrating his victories in rome these murders occurred over a decade after his supposed conversion first john 3 verse 15 says no murder such as constantine has eternal life abiding in him just as baal pior had their feast constantine had his own 10-month feast in 325 a.d called the council of nicaea his purpose was to unite all churches on jesus divinity as arius's doctrine that jesus was a created being and not equal with the father was questioned the council rejected aerys doctrines which led to the council to plant the seeds of what would later become the nicene creed a scripture denying confession of a false three-person god thus the legacy of this compromise council was that preeminence was given to creeds rather than the word here the church stumbled by uniting with creeds instead of the word the idolatry adulteries and other sins of the first church of rome were deemed acceptable by their sister churches as the roman church held to the creeds of the council of nicaea the nicolaitan doctrine is the second doctrine jesus hates from this age unconverted church leaders continued to be victors over the people by exalting themselves above the laity and instituting false doctrines the doctrine of transubstantiation worked to exalt the clergy because they claimed to have a miraculous power to change bread and wine into jesus's literal body and blood additionally constantine's church state union adopted human rule in place of the guidance of the spirit which led clergy to compete for lucrative positions and power just as publicly as political leaders competed with men ruling instead of the holy spirit ruling the unconverted clergy began using state power to persecute and kill the converted through clergy influence roman emperor theodosius 380 a.d edict ordered all christians to be called catholic christians branding all their names as heretics with threat of heavy penalties against the disobedient remember jesus said the overcomers would hold fast to his name in revelation 2 13 not the catholic name priscillian a holy ghost-filled bishop of spain and six others are said to be the first saints executed by the false church in 385 a.d while surprising to some saint augustine 354 to 430 usually lauded for his theology is said to have made popes fearless in killing anyone who disagreed with them when asked of his opinion on the death of a man killed simply for reading origen's books augustine wrote it is much better that some should perish by their own fires than that the whole body should burn in the everlasting flames of gehenna through the desert of their impious dissensions broadbent agrees his teachings incited and justified methods of persecution by which papal rome equaled the cruelties of pagan rome in 411 a.d augustine appealed to his allied roman bishops and officials to settle his doctrinal dispute with the donatists which he won augustine was clearly on rome's side as he more than any other writer taught salvation alone through the church and her sacraments it is significant that the first pope rises from this age damascus 304 to 384 and it is possible that the age ended with pope boniface iii giving himself the title universal bishop like the lawyers in jesus day these popes and others took the key of knowledge from the people by limiting scripture readings to latin only bible historian dr craig lamp says the bible was available in 500 languages in 400 a.d but was only heard in one latin 100 years later our lord had worn this age repent or else i will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth but the false vines stiffened their necks in repayment god fought against satan's new roman seat rome was captured by the goths under alaric in 410 and the western roman empire ended in 476. pagan ancient rome died but lived again in the papal holy roman empire the rewards the pergamine overcomer is promised to eat of the hidden manna and receive a white stone with a new name written therein manna was angels food given to israel during their wilderness journey in exodus 16. in verse 33 god instructs moses to hide a pot of manna in the holiest of holies to be kept for your generations only the high priest could ever see this hidden manna but jesus came as the living bread from heaven to us which word we live by the pergamian saints ate hidden manna as they daily lived in jesus presence they were privileged to partake of this hidden revelation of jesus christ hidden from bishops popes and even emperors like constantine every believer also has the future promise to partake of the hidden manna jesus will give to us in the new jerusalem there he will answer all of our questions and feed us the desire of our souls throughout all eternity the white stone with a new name represents a lasting revelation of jesus's righteousness as revelation is the rock the church is built upon according to matthew 16 verses 17-18 white is the righteousness of saints or jesus's righteousness he shares with us recall the false vine of this age rewarded themselves with massive beautiful structures to hold vain church services while the true vine hid out in caves dens homes woods and more the false vine wanted great natural stones in this life to build churches for their spiritually dead members but the true vine desired jesus's future reward of the spiritual white stones accompanying this lasting righteousness is your new name for you held fast the name of the lord jesus christ the third tier in church age 606 to 1520 in revelation chapter 2 verses 18 through 29 star columba is the angel star to this age he was born of royal blood in northern ireland but thankfully his father fergus valued jesus's cross more than his physical royal blood fergus diligently taught colomba the scripture kalama became a powerful missionary after hearing jesus's audible voice call him into missionary work some historians placed columbus supernatural missionary works in second place after jesus apostles two testimonies stick out in regards to god's power to save the lost visiting one heathen city columba prayed outside the gates while magicians inside the city tried to drown out his voice god increased the volume of his prayers until the holy spirit swung open the gates so heathens could hear and receive christ a second similar testimony is told of columba praying to enter a walled city being refused entrance he turned to leave but the chief's son became violently ill and the chief called for columba to pray for his son after the chief repented god healed the son and christ won souls in the city dr craig lamp credits columbus work of preserving god's word in the dark ages with making the reformation possible in 563 a.d columbus started a bible college in iona located in western scotland it's believed the barren ionian ground turned fruitful after columba planted seeds with one hand and lifted the other in prayer to jesus lamp says columbus college would continue through the dark ages the vast majority of evangelism that took place for the next 700 years took place as a result of that bible college due to its great missionary efforts the island was nicknamed the isle of the saints from it flowed many missionaries into scotland ireland and england building missionary villages was their main method of winning souls small groups of saints who were builders preachers and teachers would raise walls around their newly formed community and make converse of those who moved into their village faithful preachers and teachers were established among the new converts and trained to repeat this method these christian villages remained independent from rome and government aid keeping the true faith alive in jesus's little flock during the awful dark ages few men of god had such lasting and far-reaching influence as columba christ's divinity jesus reveals to thyatira that he is the son of god who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass he was most often called the son of man during his earthly ministry but here claims his rightful title as son of god seated on heaven's throne at the right hand of the majesty on high christ must tell this age he alone is the son of god to witness against the rise of papal power near the end of this age thomas aquinas and alvarez pelagius both observed how many saw the pope not as a man but a god with no bounds to his authority rejecting the pope's universal authority they said meant being shut out from salvation this age also saw the rise of islam which denies jesus is god's son blaspheming his holy blood as the one and only atonement but jesus full of truth is god's only begotten son as every overcomer believes who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god jesus's fiery eyes give warning that he looks upon the evil of this age with vengeance and will bring all wicked deeds into judgment at armageddon christ returns to destroy all his enemies with eyes as a flame of fire the son's feet of brass also speak of judgment as animal sacrifices died in fiery judgment for israel's sins on the brazen altar jesus bore his cross passing through judgment for us but at his second coming he will trample down unbelievers in judgment with his holy nail-scarred feet message to the true vine jesus knew the saints works charity service faith and patience he also knew the last works of the age would outdo the first works the lord put no other burden upon the true vine than to hold fast to its love service until his coming notice jesus acknowledged the works at the beginning and ending of the age you've read about the beginning works which included columbus foundational missionary method the thyroid tier and saints followed columbus example for at least the next 700 years as jesus also complemented their charity service faith and patience since this was the true vine their ever increasing and pleasing works were motivated by charity paul teaches any works without charity are unprofitable in first corinthians 13 verses 1 through 3 jesus complimented columba and countless other saints for their love inspired works their faith worked by love jesus's love shed abroad in their hearts by the holy ghost the greater works at the end of the thyroid tyrann age included those of john wickliffe john huss johannes gutenberg and deciderious erasmus among many others risking their own lives against all evil roman adversaries these men spread god's word in remarkable fashion wycliffe 1330-1384 systematically attacked catholicism as the most prominent scholar at oxford university his doctrinal lecture notes which exalted scripture alone as truth were copied and taken to other countries as ammunition against rome defying the pope and transubstantiation wycliffe fled as a refugee to lutterworth england where he spent the rest of his life working on his greatest achievement the first complete translation of the bible into english well after his death his english bible was banned by the archbishop of york in 1408 he was so hated by rome that in 1428 44 years after his death pope martin v ordered wycliffe's bones to be dug up and burned and his ashes were thrown into the river swift czech preacher john huss 1370-1415 came to follow wycliffe's teachings through jerome of prague who heard wycliffe at oxford huss labored for religious reforms while rebuking the pope before being burned at the stake his last words prophesied of a man to be raised up whose calls for reforms and changes could not be suppressed miraculously 102 years later god raised up martin luther who would not be suppressed and nailed his 95 theses to the church door in wittenberg germany huss's followers eventually formed the morovian brethren who played a major part in the conversion of the wesley brothers german craftsman johannes gutenberg 1390-1468 dedicated his life to perfecting the printing press with reusable movable type allowing books to be printed more quickly at a lower cost jesus anointed johannes's painstaking detail-oriented work leading to the publication of the gutenberg bible in 1455 through his efforts both the middle and lower classes could finally access the bible fueling spiritual awakenings the citarias erasmus 1469-1536 was the best-known scholar in europe his greatest work being the publication of the greek new testament a two-part study bible that included a new latin edition in 1516. previous to this publication erasmus had seen firsthand the revivals of thousands sparked by john colette reading the scripture to people in their own language the rest of erasmus life was devoted to translating scripture and his works made possible future bible translations by luther and tyndale lamp echoes erasmus famous quote i wish that even the weakest woman might read the gospels and the epistles of saint paul i long for the day when the husbandmen shall sing portions of them to himself as he follows the plow jesus assured this age that he accepted their service recall his highest compliment is for faithful service in matthew 25 verse 21 well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord it is faithful servants who jesus rewards thyatira means odor of affliction in the greek and many saints in this age fulfilled this description by giving their lives as martyrs each time a saint died christ smelled a sweet-smelling heavenly savor just as the father smelled a divine aroma when jesus sacrificed himself for us ephesians 5 verses 1 and 2 captures this truth be therefore followers of god as dear children and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling savor christian persecution continued in this age which undoubtedly was the bloodiest of all ages theologian samuel schmucker estimated 68 million christians were martyred from the time augustine gave his approval for persecution in the fifth century until schmucker's lifetime in the 19th century the saints in the thiater and age served christ with godly works until most died at the hands of the first church of rome their crusades and the inquisition broadband says the catholics were absorbed in enthusiasm for the crusades and the inquisition finished what the crusade had left undone iniquity of the false vine christ chides the false church for suffering jezebel to teach false doctrines seducing his servants into fornication and idolatry jezebel was given space to repent but didn't causing her to go into the depths of satan righteous jesus will judge jezebel her adulterous lovers and her children with death in this third tier and age jezebel is not a literal woman rather she is the roman catholic church in the old testament ahab married jezebel for political purposes and this union led israel into the depths of satan likewise in the new testament constantine married the state to the roman church for political reasons in the third age which plunged it into the depths of satan in the fourth age both the original jezebel and the catholics in this age were guilty of teaching sexual immorality idolatry murder silencing true preachers and erecting houses of false worship catholicism stooped to the depths of satan in this fourth age by first adopting the deeds of the nicolaitans in the first age in the third age catholicism made these deeds unbending church doctrines satan's depths meant a man the pope ruling over men instead of the holy ghost catholicism was indeed the mother or first man-made man-led demonic system of organization here it is observed that man-made organizations always produce spiritual death jesus called this jezebel system the depths of satan every denomination is spiritually dead because they have denied further revelation of the holy spirit every denomination whether catholic lutheran methodist baptist etc instantly dies when it writes its tradition-based by-laws and refuses to accept more truth jesus said so thus have you made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition denominations limit god to moving solely based upon their interpretation of scripture like israel each denomination starts serving god but ultimately limits god failing to gain more revelation fulfilling psalms 78 verses 40 and 41. how often they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert yea they turn back and tempted god and limited the holy one of israel as additional evidence which denomination has ever had a real word-based revival and returned to the teachings of paul peter and john none of them have and they never will for god's pattern is to call his people out of the mother-daughter system of catholics and protestants according to revelation 18 verse 4 come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues every denomination without fail falls further and further from truth as many now are publicly accepting homosexual clergy and celebrating transgenderism in the third tier and age satan-filled popes carried out both the crusades and inquisitions slaughtering millions pope urban ii began the two century-long crusades in 1095 promising total forgiveness of sins to any of his soldiers who died in battle dr lamp says the wars of the popes were carried out to capture the wealth of the world as some popes fought to steal money to build rome's extravagant basilicas fox records the papal inquisition which later inspired the evil spanish inquisition was instituted by pope innocent iii 1160-1216 after peter waldow 1140 to 1205 preached boldly against catholicism saying the pope was antichrist that mass was an abomination that the host was an idol and that purgatory was a fable another way popes raised finances was by selling indulgences pope john the 22nd 1244-1334 established a list of tariffs for indulgences in which catholics could kill a man for 1.75 cents ravish a virgin for two dollars or be absolved of all sins for twelve dollars papal debauchery ruled this age urban vi 1318-1389 in rome and clement the 7th 1342-1394 in france each claimed to be the true pope threatening to excommunicate the other speaking of popes in general fox says a worse set of men never corrupted the earth from the time of gregory the great in the sixth century to the latest period the popes have been more or less of abandoned principles they have been covetous popes proud popes profane popes unchaste popes dishonest popes murdering popes all of whose names and characters may be seen in any impartial history of these pretended representatives upon earth of him who was holy harmless and undefiled the lord jesus ends his rebuke to the false vine by warning he will judge jezebel her adulterous lovers and her children with death idol worshipers are often called lovers in scripture as malachi 2 verse 11 says judah was married to the daughter of a strange god the jezebel systems lovers in this age were the european governments who bowed to her evils the crusades were possible only because european nations obeyed their lover jezebel and her front man's call to war pope urban ii jezebel's children were all the daughter churches who formed through the efforts of the mothers proselytizing all churches who supported catholicism and his popes were children of the mother church and christ hated their idolatrous works having defied jesus's warning the false vine will be killed with death or eternal separation from god in the second death the lake of fire chapter 9 fully details the mother-daughter relationship between catholics and protestants the rewards christ's two rewards for the overcomers are power over nations and the morning star power over nations is the perfect reward for all overcomers but especially the thyroid tyrant saints they lived in the darkest age spiritually speaking one that was dominated by papal rome and the devil it was almost satan's millennium but it was not quite one thousand years long believers like columba peter waldow and wycliffe defied nations for they were of a holy nation being born again from above from the heavenly nation by forsaking worldly nations jesus grants the overcomers power over nations as rulers during the millennium revelation 20 verse 6 says blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years after suffering for christ during their earthly lives they are fit to rule and reign over nations jesus appropriately promises to reward overcomers with the morning star or his light for he is the morning star according to revelation 22 16 i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star christ gives his overcomers the morning star because they suffered through the dark ages in this age popes fervently worked to keep the light of god's word from the people forbidding most from hearing and reading scripture in their own languages but god anointed men to take the light of his knowledge to every hungry heart and their heavenly reward will be jesus sharing more of his light throughout all eternity in the natural the morning star is the brightest light in the sky before dawn jesus is the true morning star the hope of a new day for when his day dawns the thyre tier and saints will reign with him in the one thousand year millennial reign the sardisian church age 1520 to 1750 in revelation 3 verses 1-6 star martin luther is the angel star to this age one of the most well-known christians of all time luther sparked the protestant reformation as a poor monk standing against the whole vast papal power armed only with the bible's liberating message of habakkuk 2 verse 4 and romans 1 verse 17 the just shall live by faith luther's legacy is so vast it is hard to measure broadbent says luther revealed christ to countless sinners through unprecedented power and courage while writing many teaching tracks for christian understanding some believe his greatest work was translating both the old and new testaments into german but luther also added much to the church's music writing to him a mighty fortress is our god and it is believed that luther operated and possessed all nine gifts of the holy spirit climatic events abounded in luther's life amazingly he decided to become a monk after surviving a violent thunderstorm following numerous years in the ministry he nailed his 95 theses to the church door in wittenberg in 1517 after witnessing a papal worker shamelessly cell indulgences in the streets three years later he publicly burned the pope's letter of excommunication for him fully aware he may lose his life at the diet of worms luther refused to recant the sardisian star uttered his most inspired words my conscience is my guide scripture is my authority and i can do no other than abide by its teachings here i stand god help me while luther helped change the whole scope of christianity his work was unfulfilled as he aged his judgment failed at times he became dogmatic to a fault anti-semitic negative and saw many of his followers leave luther wrote not a tenth part of his converts remain steadfast in the faith and said we are almost utter heathen with the name of christian in some ways his lutheran church was reformed but not fully luther kept the church state system the catholic parish model infant baptisms and baptismal regeneration despite these disappointments luther's defiance of rome and scriptural revelations mightily pave the way for every future preacher and translator christ's divinity revelation 3 verse 1 reveals another aspect of jesus's divinity saying these things saith he that have the seven spirits of god and the seven stars you already know the seven stars are god's human angel messengers to the seven church ages but you need to know what the seven spirits of god represent it is crucial to maintain god is only one spirit as taught by jesus and paul but god manifests himself in various ways such as one holy spirit working through nine different gifts of the spirit in first corinthians 12 verses 4 through 13. the seven spirits appear four times in revelation chapter one verse four chapter three verse one chapter four verse five and chapter five verse six you learn four details about them they are before god's throne belong to christ appear as lamps of fire and are sent forth into all the earth these seven spirits of god refer to the seven earthly ministries of the seven stars as proven by the word first god greatly honored their prayers when they came boldly unto the throne of grace for mercy and help second they belong to christ as paul says he was a prisoner of jesus christ in ephesians 3 verse 1. third proverbs 20 verse 27 teaches the spirit of man is the candle or lamp in hebrew of the lord fourth zechariah 4 verse 10 says seven men are the seven eyes of the lord which run to and fro through the whole earth as you have seen thus far these stars or men paul irenaeus martin columba and luther had unique ministries but the same god supernaturally worked in their lives jesus heard their prayers protected fueled and sent them to the world two out of the seven stars remain to be described but you will see the same lord moving in unique ways to manifest his light to each age first corinthians 12 5 declares this and there are differences of administrations but the same lord message to the true vine christ knows their works encourages watchfulness and instructs them to strengthen the things that remain that are ready to die the saints were to remember how they received and heard the word holding fast to it and repent because their works were not perfect before god however the all-knowing messiah saw the few who walked worthy and undefiled in white garments while jesus acknowledges the works of the true vine he emphasizes they were not perfect or unfulfilled the reformation is highly acclaimed for its spiritual illumination within the dark ages and rightly so but it did not fully separate from all catholic traditions thankfully luther and other reformers purged the church from papal authority transubstantiation idolatry marioletry indulgences and much more but as noted previously luther and other leaders of this age retained some heirs notice jesus urging the faithful few to strengthen what remained because the age was ready to die remember luther said he observed the church as almost heathen showing it was ready to die or denominate historically speaking the sardisian believers were to cling to justification by faith the reformation's main theme because the majority of churches were going to die through organizing new daughter denominations the previous age thiatera saw the saints overcome jezebel the mother harlot denominational system of the catholic church basardus was the age of spiritual jezebel's daughter athaliah she represented the daughter denominations raising after the mother denomination the sardisian age saw the formation of denominational lutherans and countless other sex divisions and man-made organizations denominational zeal was causing many to die spiritually christ implored this age to remember how they first received the reformers message of justification by faith peter emphasizes the power of memory to stir up believers in 2nd peter 3 verse 1. stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance this age needed to remember how they repented and became justified under preachers like luther ulrich zwingli heinrich bollinger and john calvin to name a few justification is only the first work of grace with sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost being the second and third work respectively god's foreknowledge recognized the majority of sardisian believers would only accept justification so he saved the full restoration of the second and third works of grace for the last two ages philadelphia and laodicea however a few worthy saints in the sardisian age were born again with a third work of grace for that is what white raiment represents putting jude 1 23 romans 13 verse 14 titus 3 verse 5 and revelation 3 verse 18 together you understand that the holy spirit filled souls are likened to wearing a white robe of jesus's righteousness while alive on earth luthor and zwingli walked worthy in white robes indeed luther was born again for he had holy ghost power as a witness in germany and later risked his life defying the holy roman emperor at the diet of verms but his emphasis was preaching justification by faith to a stiff neck people who in the generation following him would relax spiritually and denominate plunging themselves into spiritual death other reformers and saints alike had the genuine new birth experience but they were all subject to the conditions of their age and thereby struggled to always magnify truth christians living today in the laodicean age do well to praise god for the strength of the reformers who triumphed over the utter corruption of the dark ages surely you can relate to the sardisian saints's battle against denominationalism for you severely battle today's lazy lukewarm conditions let us rejoice for the faithful few who walked worthy of christ in white many of whom gave their lives as martyrs for jesus holy name william tyndale 1494-1536 must be remembered from this age called the prince of translators and the father of modern english tyndale's translation of the bible into english serves as one of the greatest contributions to western civilization despite enduring 11 years of being hunted down for defying the pope and seeking to give the people an english bible he diligently translated the new testament while dying through strangulation and burning at the stake tyndale prayed lord open the king of england's eyes christ jesus heard his prayer for the very next year saw king henry viii grant permission and license to john rogers to print the english bible the king later printed 20 000 english bibles composed of 97 of tyndale's work called the great bible and sent a copy to every church in england the most accurate bible ever written the king james version of 1611 contains 90 of tyndale's translation work praise the lord for the few saints like luther and tyndale who walked worthy of the gospel in the sardisian age iniquity of the false vine christ rebukes the false vine for having a name they lived yet were spiritually dead this group would not repent of imperfect works nor watch for christ so he would come upon them as a thief in an unexpected hour assuredly the false vine of the roman catholic church associated themselves with the name of christ but they lived contrary to his teachings they arrogantly called themselves catholics which means universal their claim was to be concerned for the universal worldwide christian church yet jesus says they were dead indeed they were spiritually dead for they were more concerned with satisfying their lusts sadly this age was known for vast papal prostitution samuel schmucker records that in the days of pope paul iii 1468-1549 the popes were some of the most licentious men in history pope paul accepted indulgences for sex acts with prostitutes after licensing brothels in rome the holy city alone had nearly forty 000 prostitutes in their public register imagine the total number of prostitutes throughout rome influenced europe fox says rome's monasteries and nunneries were seats of iniquity with the latter comparable to the worst brothels describing their evils in the days of henry viii 1491-1547 fox wrote when these monasteries were fully explored in england the abbots priors and monks kept as many women each as any lashivious could desire and their crimes renewed the existence of sodom and gomorrah in the days of pope paul v 1550 1550-1621 the roman senate objected against his proposal to suppress licensed brothels because they were worried his priests would instead seduce the senators wives and daughters yes the false vine was dead in sins despite their claim to the precious name of jesus this age also saw the false vine promote denominationalism taking the name of lutherans and hussites but failing to obey their bible instructions like catholics they had a denominational name but were spiritually dead luther observed many in his generation were already dead but the second generation would be worse as the lutheran denomination became a replica of the old catholic system the daughter harlot was just like the mother harlot most second generation lutherans did not live with luther lived and thus died spiritually this brings the pharisees to mind as they reviled jesus and his message and claimed to be moses's disciples in john 9 28. jesus said they were the children of hell in reality the pharisees added and taught their own commandments rather than moses's which jesus exposed in matthew 15 verses 1-9 the lutherans did the same for if they had preached and lived what luther preached the blessings of justification by faith would have led them away from all false doctrine organization and complacency obedience to luther's teachings would have brought strength and led them into sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost but they denominated rebelled and died repentance was available but refused the false vine should have watched and waited for jesus's spirit to convict their hearts they should have diligently prepared their lives to meet jesus in peace understanding his warning to come like a thief instead they sold out their souls to temporary earthly pleasures and false religion the rewards our lord says the overcomers will be clothed in white raiment their names will not be blotted out of the book of life but will be confessed before jesus father and his angels the souls of born born-again christians are currently adorned in white robes while living on earth as paul says we put on the lord jesus christ and his armor of light in romans 13 verses 12-14 in the greek put on means to sink into clothing put on clothe oneself but jesus promises the future putting on of white robes referring to the supernatural theophany or celestial bodies that house the christian soul after death according to second corinthians 5 verses 1 through 4 all overcomers will have white as light raiment like jesus wore on mount transfiguration in matthew 17 verse 2. you already learned about the book of life in chapter 6 but the special reward of your name remaining on the book of life is what jesus directs his sardisian christians to strive for this is because the overcomers confessed jesus name rather than the pope luther zwingli or any other man's name the few overcomers had jesus name and lived by it walking worthy of the gospel job 14 verses 14 and 15 captures the truth of jesus calling and confessing our names after death if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come thou shall call and i will answer thee thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands he will call every overcomer to meet him in the air at the rapture then he will call them to sit down and feast at the marriage supper of the lamb lastly he will confess the names of the overcomers as they judge men and fallen angels at the white throne judgment for they will sit with him on his throne the philadelphian church age 1750 to 1906 in revelation 3 verses 7 through 13. star john wesley is the angel star to this age being the founder of the methodist movement and champion of the sanctification doctrine he and his brother charles a gifted songwriter were two of 19 children born to samuel and susannah wesley samuel was a busy traveling clergyman and susannah saw her children as talents committed to her by god since she had servants to assist her in housework susana devoted much time to prayerful godly child training she frequently gathered her children together to read scripture and counsel them sometimes up to 200 people crowded her home to hear her readings being trained and obedient to a disciplined christian life from his youth john grew in the faith and became an ordained minister while on a missionary trip to georgia the holy lives of the moravians made him realize he was not yet converted returning to england he received inspiring words from peter bowler to continue preaching and seeking god blessed assurance descended from heaven into his soul on may 24 1738 with his message of a new greater spiritual experience john was rejected by the churches he had previously preached for his old friend george whitefield introduced him to open air preaching and god blessed his efforts with amazing supernatural results as tens of thousands at a time attended his services the gifts of the holy ghost abounded in wesley's ministry as believers shook fell to the ground as dead wept and shouted as they were healed and delivered from demons the dumb spoke the insane made sane and the dead raised to life while wesley always preached justification by faith he argued christians could experience entire sanctification in this life by loving god and their neighbors meekness and lowliness of heart abstaining from all appearance of evil and doing all for the glory of god his organizational genius loosely united believers in faith societies or bands to spread christianity and yet let each individual church remain independent proving his stand against denominationalism wesley's commitment to sanctification led him to purge the societies of unworthy members as he saw fit the new life and energy of his movement could not be contained in the dead established church of england wesley traveled 4 000 miles per year and preached over 40 000 sermons in his lifetime even at 88 years old he said he felt no infirmities of old age at his death he twice cried out the best of all is god is with us god certainly was with wesley and the sanctification loving methodists christ divinity jesus tells philadelphia these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth christ alone is all holy and all true jesus only is exalted as the holy one witnessed by devils david peter paul and john his holiness was a result of him always doing the father's bidding thankfully jesus shares his holiness with man via substitution on the cross god exchanged our sins for jesus's holiness christ became sin so that we could become holy for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him jesus's holiness is a free gift for every believer but always remains accredited to his work no man can boast of his own holiness after healing a lame man peter who was filled with the holy ghost pleads with those marveling at the miracle to recognize it was not done through his own power or holiness only jesus's holiness heals it is the only holiness in all the universe jesus's grace imputes his holiness to us as we partake of his sufferings hebrews 12 10 says god chastens us for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness four verses later you read follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord when jesus returns in the rapture believers gifted with the holy ghost will be holy still how kind for the holy one to impute holiness to unholy men through the new birth christ is he that is true for he is the true light true bread true vine true god and true witness jesus is truth embodied in a man as he is the perfect realization of truth john 1 14 proclaims he is full of grace and truth as a source of truth christ always spoke the truth thus he corrected every false word including those spoke by his mother his disciples the pharisees pilate caiaphas and satan in john 17 verse 17 one of his final prayers before being arrested jesus said sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth our true messiah says his true word will sanctify or separate you from all profane things the key of david is jesus's right and ability for he is the son of david to sit upon the throne of david as king of israel in the millennium jesus has other keys the keys of death and hell which allow him to raise up his own to live with him for the 1000 year honeymoon jesus will open the millennium to his worthy ones and will close it in preparation for the white throne judgment isaiah 22 22 teaches the key of david is placed on jesus shoulder the purpose of the shoulder is to provide strength and range for the arm and hand jesus hand represents power and the arm of the lord symbolizes his ability to redeem save and judge christ beautifully and powerfully saves his elect luke 15 verse 5 says he rejoices as he lays all his saved sheep on his shoulders jesus takes full responsibility for you his lamb and rests you upon his shoulder of saving redeeming power message to the true vine jesus knows the works of the faithful saints and he sets before them an open door that no man can shut christ sees their little strength obedience to his words and how they have not denied his name our lord promises to make their enemies worship before their feet and know that jesus loves them another promise is that he will keep them from the worldwide time of temptation jesus says he is coming quickly so they must hold fast what they have that no man take their crown the open door has two interconnected meanings first this was the age of unprecedented missionary work and it was paul who called a new ministry opportunity in troas an open door in second corinthians 2 verse 12 furthermore when i came to troas to preach christ's gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord broadbent says william carey helped to bring about this sense of responsibility and of love to christ and to mankind kerry's works included 41 years of ministry in india over 700 converts numerous bible translations providing education for thousands and initiating social reforms his sacrificial works inspired many other missionaries like hudson taylor and david livingstone to enter the global open door that men could not shut a second meaning for the open door is the spiritual revelation of jesus as the door of the sheep in john 10 verse 7 then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep the philadelphian saints who entered into christ the door received his little strength to obey his great commission by making disciples of all nations the saints in this age confessed jesus name and had more strength than those of the reformation the philadelphian saints acted upon jesus name by producing some of the greatest sermons and works of literature in history with jesus strength gifted men like charles spurgeon jonathan edwards and john bunyan preached and wrote to magnify the name of jesus christ just as the second age had lying enemies who called themselves jews but were not these philadelphian saints battled similar liars historically speaking it is difficult to identify this group but it seems probable the synagogue of satan was the roman catholic church because she falsely claimed to be the original church either way jesus encouraged the true vine to be confident that he would show the false vine his love for true believers by making the false vine fall down at their feet at the white throne judgment liars will not bow now but every knee shall bow before jesus and his saints on judgment day first corinthians 6 verses 2 and 3 promises do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world should be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life the lord's final words to this age emphasize his soon coming saying behold i come quickly after the philadelphian age there would only be one more age laodicea jesus second coming was nearer than ever and sinful human history was coming to a close these saints kept the faith through tumultuous times such as the american revolution the napoleonic wars the french revolution and the american civil war to name a few since the true vine had kept jesus's word of patience by keeping his word in confessing his name jesus would keep them from the worldwide hour of temptation spoken of in revelation 13 verses 15 through 17. during the tribulation the image of the beast is going to try and force all to either take the mark of the beast or die this is still in the future but jesus gave this age blessed assurance that they would not see this wicked event chapter 12 outlines jesus's promise that the true vine in laodicea will not see this hour of temptation either christ will snatch his bride away in the rapture before the tribulation sets in god has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation no doubt we will see the ecumenical move grow and further unite with the world's governments since the mark of the beast will come out of the united states or beast out of the earth americans will see the churches unite with the state to enact laws against true christianity jesus's bride may be forced to stop preaching she may be threatened with the loss of the privilege of buying and selling but before the hour comes for the mark to be enforced upon all christ comes to rapture her away the true vine who held fast to jesus's name and strength were to gain their crown and not allow another to take it crowns belong to rulers who reign and two bible examples illustrate this thought king saul was anointed and crowned but his impatience and self-will caused his crown to be given to david and his sons judas iscariot was given the highest office in the ministry that of an apostle but forfeited it and his place was given to matthias philippian saints persevered and kept the faith ruling and reigning by wearing the full armor of god and overcoming satan's synagogue their crown awaits them along with a seat on jesus's throne iniquity of the false vine christ says very little about the false vine in this age because the true vine had the open door and strength in his name conversely the false vine weakened as seen through the fading power of the inquisition and the fading influence rome had over rulers the rise of european nationalism and revolutions around the globe gave greater power to national leaders who no longer feared popes two portions of prophecy were being fulfilled during this time first the roman antichrist spirit was moving to the united states to become the beast out of the land from revelation 13. second the iron and clay of the great image in daniel 2 verses 42 through 43 reforming the final catholic protestant kingdom this image agreed upon false doctrines but were not completely unified as jesus said the false vine were liars and their churches of satan for they continued persecuting the true vine broad meant tells of the persecution wesley and his preachers faced most violent opposition assailed the preachers from all sides righteous mobs attacked them and those who with them had confessed christ doing grievous injury to persons and property but all this was met by a courage and meekness which the adversaries were not able to withstand satan's liars name-called criticized broke up services and threatened to kill the true vine but none could close jesus's open door jesus promised he would make the false group know his love for the true ones and it seems this will be done at the white throne judgment during this age the false could not see jesus's love for his saints because of the spirit of deception and iniquity they had accepted equipped with reprobate minds and blasphemous words the false vine continued to think their killing was pleasing to god rome and the pope their evil works matched the pharisees of john 16 verses 2 and 3. yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god's service and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me had the catholics known the father and his son's prayer for believers sanctification through truth in john 17 verse 17 they would have honored wesley's move the rewards overcomers are made pillars in the temple of god and shall no more go out herein lies two truths first christ's bride will be residents of the millennial temple and never leave aside revelation 7 verses 9 through 17 shows his gentile people are like pillars in the temple for they are before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them you know there is no temple in the new jerusalem for the lamb is the temple throughout eternity second overcomers become part of the spiritual temple of god taught in ephesians 2 verses 19-22 bride members are built upon the original apostles and prophets with jesus christ being the chief cornerstone of the holy temple another reward is for the overcomer to have three names written spiritually on the fleshly tables of his heart god's name the name of his city and jesus's new name god's name is simply the lord jesus christ for john 5 verse 43 says jesus came in his father's name jesus means jehovah is our salvation and his name is the name above all names jesus is the image of jehovah the father for his proper name in hebrew is jehovah or jehovah the self-existing one god city is named the new jerusalem and this name is etched upon the overcomer's heart for this is his eternal home jesus's new name is another divine mystery yet to be unveiled and will be magnificent beyond all description the laodicean church age 1906 to the present in revelation 3 verses 14 through 22 star william branham is the angel star to this final gentile age meaning his bible-based message from jesus christ is what the true church needs to hear today this entire book is dedicated to sharing jesus bible message for today and chapter 13 covers branham's life spiritual gifts and bible foretold ministry summarizing his ministry's worldwide lasting impact the dictionary of pentecostal and charismatic movement states the person universally acknowledged as the revival's father or pacesetter was william branham the sudden appearance of his miraculous healing campaigns in 1946 set off a spiritual explosion in the pentecostal movement which was to move to main street usa by the 1950s and give birth to the broader charismatic movement in the 1960s which currently affects almost every denomination in the country as the final angel messenger to the gentiles jesus sent branham with an undeniable gift of discernment to know the thoughts and intents of hearts the holy spirit repeatedly and boldly spoke with thus saith the lord through branham as he had through prophets like moses joshua ezekiel and jeremiah numerous prophecies spoken by the spirit through branham have come to pass and many more remain to be fulfilled as the second coming of jesus nears since jesus had luther emphasized justification and wesley emphasized sanctification the savior had branham major on the baptism of the holy ghost this is the age of restoration we are walking where the apostles trod all mysteries are revealed believers hearts are turned back to the apostolic fathers jesus is returning soon to rapture his bride off the earth before judgment falls christ's divinity our lord signifies himself as the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god as our amen in the last age jesus demonstrates his authority of having the last word amen means so it is so be it may it be fulfilled in the greek he opened the door to the gentiles in ephesus and will close it himself at his own appointed time in laodicea his every promise to every age he will fulfill as second corinthians 1 verse 20 declares for all the promises of god in him are ye and in him amen unto the glory of god by us messiah is also connecting himself with his first and last title because the word amen in the greek is also used as the verily verily when beginning a statement jesus begins and ends his messages with the same loving eternal assurance that he will do what he said because he is the same yesterday today and forever again jesus's deity is speaking it is an astounding historical fact that only the first and last church ages knew jesus as one person and not the second person of a man-made trinity dogma jesus is the invisible god made flesh he's the image of the one and only god you will never see the father but he has taken on a flesh body so that he can be touched and handled indeed the term trinity was coined in the second age mandated in the third commonplace in the fourth and ignorantly carried on through the sixth age but now in the amen age the seventh age his bride knows his full deity as he desires to be known jesus is not part of the trinity for there is no such thing he's the fullness of the godhead bodily christ is the faithful and true witness concerning faithfulness it is through his power that everything consists the visible and invisible heavens thrones dominions principalities and powers jesus's words alone set the universe and its laws in order and keeps them intact if he can maintain all this surely he is faithful to start maintain and finish his work in you philippians 1 verse 6 promises being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ in this age of lukewarm and lying witnesses christ is the true witness second peter 3 verses 3 through 7 says false witnesses in the last days will be willingly ignorant of jesus's second coming the earth's creation and noah's flood they will avoid and deny the truth on purpose witnessing against it but jesus is the true witness for he was with and loved of the father before the foundation of the world this means he witnessed the earth's founding jesus spirit was in noah's preaching urging mankind to repent after his crucifixion jesus spirit descended to hell to preach and witness against that wicked generation the true witness is coming again and says to watch and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape judgment and stand before the son of man recall chapter 1 when you learn jesus is the beginning of the creation of god before there was time space or matter the invisible god alone existed his first words likely let there be light produced a visible light in time space and matter called the logos or the word this light was jesus for he is the word and was the first creation the first creation or beginner speaks assurance he is with us in the last age message to the true vine jesus again knows the works of christians and urges them to be hot which is possible through buying gold and white raiment directly from him believers are instructed to anoint their eyes with eye salve in order to see in love jesus rebukes and chastens his own who zealously repent his last words to this age place him knocking at every heart's door willing to come and sup with them if they will hear his voice and open their hearts to his spirit although jesus message is extremely harsh to this age as it should be there is hope for the true church the overcomers works will be hot which means boiling hot metaphorically of fervor of mind and zeal in the greek thinking on the word fervent also defined as passionate intense and sincere brings to mind scriptures like the fervent bold and diligent teacher apollos recall paul's plea for christians in romans 12 11 to be not slaughterful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord jesus's bride and laodicea must pray fervently as epreforus always labored fervently in prayer james 5 16 says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much twice in his first epistle peter admonishes us to love each other fervently above all else the true vine began this age hot on april 9 1906 when the holy ghost fell upon believers on azusa street california after intense seasons of prayer in obedience to the order of the word the saints spoke in tongues and every message was interpreted in english fueled by these vigorous works believers receive the revelation that god is one person within one decade afterwards this revelation was in direct opposition to the three-person trinity the apostolic revelation of jesus's supreme deity and god's one name as the lord jesus christ was restored at the perfect time just before jesus's rapture returned the next two decades would see the false vine hinder the move of god by deceiving men into organizing denominations based upon tongues as the evidence of the holy ghost and the oneness of god no longer would god speak through them or any other organization because he said he would spew lukewarm creed-minded groups out of his mouth after the church is denominated jesus moved right on into the prophetic ministry of william branham who began pastoring in 1933 and transitioned into a worldwide healing ministry in 1946 here is where god would speak his unadulterated truth to the age after winning millions of souls to the lord jesus in india africa and throughout the world jesus used brother branham to correctly interpret church history through a series he preached on the seven church ages in 1960. in march 1963 christ loosed the revelations of the seven seals and had branham preached them with the prophetic validation of thus saith the lord following branham's death in 1965 the true bride has been taking jesus's end time revelations around the world believers have experienced the continuation of god's revival by faithfully acting upon branham's revelations from the spirit the bride's eyes are anointed with jesus's eye self in fulfillment of ephesians 1 verses 17-18 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints in this age jesus's true church is buying gold and white raiment from him through spiritual transactions of faith proverbs 23 verse 23 reads by the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction and understanding jesus spiritual gold is time-tested unwavering faith according to first peter 1 verse 7 white raiment represents the righteousness of jesus christ manifested in a life of spiritual integrity and obedience to the holy spirit these eternal transactions are possible through jesus's rebukes and the zealous repentance of the hearers bride members in laodicea are constantly hearing convicting challenging sermons which is proof of jesus's love yet the saints rejoice in the constant correction recognizing god's unchanging method for dealing with his children for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening god dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then ye are bastards and not sons as paul promised the preaching of the five full ministry will perfect or complete jesus's bride believers will hear jesus knocking on their hearts door for his fellowship and let him in for supper the first course of christ's meal will be milk for the newborn christian according to first peter 2 verses 1-3 after growing up in maturity the second course will be meet feeding the hungry heart with spiritual discernment to judge every action as either evil or good in an age where riches and mega churches are exalted and falsely connected to spiritual attainment jesus true bride will be rich in faith through passionate prayers loving care for fellow christians daily repentance and fellowship with jesus she will overcome the spiritual complacency plaguing this age the laodicean age climaxes with a true vine being raptured to the sky to meet her husband christ in the air while the world suffers through the tribulation revelation 4 verses 1 and 2 offers a beautiful type of this catching away as john represents the bride called up to heaven before the throne of god immediately after the end of the laodicean message after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show thee the things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne iniquity of the false vine no other bible passage records such a scathing judgment as the false vine receives from jesus as the time of the gentiles come to a close christ's first assessment is his sickness over their lukewarm spiritual state the true vine is hot but the false is lukewarm which means tepid lukewarm metaphoric of the condition of the soul wretchedly fluctuating between a torpor and a fervor of love in the greek their wishy-washy works sometimes fervent but mostly lethargic may christ vomit calling to mind isaiah 28 verses 1-13 specifically verse 8 says baxter and israel's tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean isaiah says israel's pride drunkenness and perverted judgments caused the once holy tables to be covered in vomit the same conditions have repeated in the modern mother-daughter catholic protestant church system the pride natural and spiritual drunkenness and lack of sound doctrine and bible-based judgments makes jesus sick he spews these churches out of his mouth meaning he no longer speaks through their pulpits truly jesus is not speaking in catholic lutheran methodist baptist and pentecostal denominations you hear the groups compromising with and exalting sin you do not hear them issuing holy judgments with thus saith the lord like the true vine who is proclaiming the seventh angel's message to the age certainly their church members are drunk with pride for jesus records their despicable self-assessment i am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing the false fine is delighted with physical riches and goods and feels no need for the holy ghost spiritual revivals or repentance they refuse any further revelation of scripture and only accept changes to their bylaws that will swell their number of members they will accept female clergy homosexual clergy transgender members and repeated adulterers into their vomit-filled sanctuaries it sounds harsh but it is jesus judgment upon an age that wants its own rights and rules rather than god's rules yes the false fine does not want to follow god's rule and has long forgot paul's command for the saints to walk by the same rule minding the same thing in philippians 3 verse 16. the name laodicea means justice of the people in the greek and every church is making their own rules to meet the demands and rights of sinful adulterers homosexuals transgenders liars blasphemers child molesters and the rest since the mark of the beast comes out of the united states also known as the beast out of the land in revelation 13 notice the drastic submission of the government and churches to the rights of sin-loving workers of iniquity while america's founding fathers were far from perfect many possessed sincere faith in christ from the time of the revolutionary war to the civil war there were numerous government proclaimed days of prayer humiliation and fasting both washington and lincoln called and participated in these holy days historian david barton reports 29 out of the 56 signers of the declaration of independence had seminary degrees which is why america's founding documents are rich in biblical references and principles like israel america quickly fell from her humble god-fearing beginnings the roaring twenties saw the rise of rebellious women who cut their hair for the first time wore makeup miniskirts smoked and danced in defiance to god's holiness most men permitted it in weakness fear and shame hollywood rose during the great depression and it has constantly ushered in cultural corruption ever since rebellious rock and roll in the 1950s planted the seeds for the sexual revolution of the 1960s the mother harlot roman catholic church mounted on and began riding her final beast the american beast out of the land when john f kennedy became the first catholic president in november 1960. prayer was taken out of schools in 1962 followed by the legalization of murdering babies in 1973. abortion has now claimed over 50 million innocent lives whose blood cries to god for vengeance from american soil homosexuality was removed from the list of mental disorders in 1973 and on june 26 2015 the supreme court legalized this abomination just as jesus says this age is indeed wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked yet he says they do not know their deplorable condition because they have purposely failed to retain god's knowledge in their minds romans 1 verse 28 proves this saying and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient looking deeper in verse 28 the false vine knew the truth at one time but is since blasphemed the truth and accepted lies they will be destroyed because they rejected god's knowledge just as hosea 4 verse 6 reads my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge because thou has rejected knowledge i will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me seeing thou has forgotten the law of thy god i will also forget thy children as i conclude writing this book in february 2021 america and the world are in shambles more ripe than ever for judgment through massive voter fraud america has her second catholic president joe biden signaling afresh the vatican's grip upon the nation and the world coronavirus foretold by jesus as a pestilence in matthew 24 verse 7 has weakened the world economy stolen the rights of public worshippers and taken over one million lives but this is just the beginning since jesus says all pestilences and earthquakes are just the beginning of sorrows for this rebellious sinful world violent rioting and arson has decimated some american cities with one group in portland oregon burning bibles and american flags other groups are calling for statues of jesus to come down the black lives matter movement is leading the protests which claims to be a peaceful organization but some of its members escalate their protests into violent destruction even murdering innocent children and police officers christians believe black lives matter along with all lives including the unborn but the spirit of sodom is upon the blm movement as one of its goals is to disrupt the nuclear family in order to exalt the lgbtq agenda jesus warned the sodomite culture would return in luke 17 verses 29 and 30 and the same violent holiness hating mobs from sodom have re-emerged on american soil no one knows how long it will be until canceled culture targets true christians but the false vine will fully support stopping the true vine from preaching and ministering to the needy in fulfillment of revelation 13 verses 15 through 17 the false fine churches will unite with american politics to change laws forcing all churches into a unionized religion with the threat of losing money property food and life itself if not obeyed but before their ungodly bloodthirsty laws are enacted jesus will rescue his bride into heaven in the rapture christ promised this protection to the philadelphian saints so we know it carries over to this age because thou has kept the word of my patience i will also keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth the false vine will misconstrue jesus's prayer for oneness in john 17 verses 11 through 23 in order to promote its evil one world church it is a terror harvest a deadly impersonation do not believe it for you are the genuine wheat first peter 1 verse 22 says oneness with christ only comes through obeying the truth through the holy spirit and this unionized church will promote inclusion for adulterers murderers homosexuals liars pedophiles and more world leaders will promise peace and safety but sudden destruction is their worthy reward the reward the holy one promises overcomers a seat with him on his throne even as he overcame and is set down with his father in his throne jesus reminds the overcomers how he overcame satan's temptations in matthew 4. messiah overcame the wicked one by simply quoting the rightly divided word and obeying it we overcome the same way by obeying god's word while rebuking satan with god's word on our lips indeed the word is our mighty spiritual weapon we use to rule over satan the world sin and temptation no age needs the sharp cutting discerning power of the word like this age for deception is at its peak rejoice that jesus has already made you a king and priest unto god and his father just as king david smote and subdued the land with his sword you can smite and subdue every foul demon power with god's revealed word on your lips and the shield of faith protecting your heart and mind christ's final reward is a seat next to him on the millennial throne for the new age is nearly upon us certainly jesus will rule all nations with a rod of iron but recall he has promised that overcomers will rule in a similar way and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father by the holy ghost leading an authority rule over your bodily passions family situations work situations and church situations you are not just a conqueror in one area of your life you are more than a conqueror in every aspect of life through him that loved us jesus's love is calling you to rule over sin now so that you can rule over nations later you can do it by his grace he is with you even in you supernatural vindication of the seven church ages after witnessing jfk's election in november 1960 and recognizing it as the rise of catholicism in the united states the holy spirit led william branham to embark on his most in-depth study the seven church ages through much prayer and study branham preached 13 sermons related to the church ages from december 4th 1960 to january 8 1961. on the evening of the final sermon the holy spirit descended into branham tabernacle and visibly appeared as a pillar of fire to the congregation on the back wall of the church as figure 20 shows the holy spirit shown in the same seven circular patterns branham taught for the seven church ages the circles showed how the light or truth of each age would decrease until moving in an increasing direction beginning at the sardisian age this supernatural event vindicated branham was preaching heaven's revelation of the ages and not his own audio from the event is available for you to hear as awestruck worshipers tremble scream and weep at god's visible light in orderly fashion the holy spirit first shows the church ages revelation was true and then begins to anoint his prophet branham to minister to the sick through the gift of discernment here's the text versions of this magnificent incident now look this way you all now that's just like it is when it comes under glory here see see it comes it's the light over here you're moving here you see now look it's just it's just a reflection just a reflection that is see it's not the light here's the light hanging right here see right here at this woman i just happened to catch it and i thought it was over somebody now you're seeing one and i'm seeing two one of them is the natural and the other is the supernatural there's a man sitting on the outside here along this line looking over towards that light it struck him he's from seymour indiana and he's got had a stroke if you'll believe sir god will heal you of that stroke amen believe now the seven seals chronologically speaking you must understand the revelation of the seven stars and seven candlesticks in the first three chapters of revelation in order to understand the rest of the climatic book with the true understanding of the seven church ages you can now receive the revelations of the seven seals for a complete understanding of the seven seals i strongly advise you to read william branham's the revelation of the seven seals which is a transcription of the sermon series he preached in march 1963 audio of the sermon series is also available online at no cost first notice the four heavenly beasts around jesus's throne are connected to the first four seals revelation 4 verse 7 records their specific order with the first beast being like a lion the second beast like a calf the third beast with the face of a man and the fourth beast like a flying eagle the order of the beasts matches the order of the first four seals in revelation 6 verse 1 the first beast tells john about the first seal and its horse rider revelation 6 3 says the second beast the one like a calf announces the second seal and the horse rider the third beast announces the third seal in revelation 6 5 and the fourth beast announces the fourth seal in revelation 6 verse 7. notice the 5th 6th and 7th seals have no beasts announcing their symbols and no horse riders if you recall chapter 2 this is because the times of the gentiles are over after the fourth seal the fifth seal deals with blinded israel being promised eternal life once the tribulation ends the sixth seal is a description of the earthly effects of the tribulation and the seventh seal is the rapture of the gentile bride which ushers in armageddon and the millennium biblical numerology of number four concerning the four beasts and four horsemen of the first four seals you see the importance of the number four in biblical numerology four is a number of godly deliverance and an earthly number satan copies and perverts god's numbers so for in his work represents total corruption examples include delivered israel made their exodus from egypt in the fourth generation genesis 15 verse 16. ezekiel's dry bones vision listed four steps to israel's restoration sinew flesh skin breath ezekiel 37 verses 1-14 jesus was the fourth man in the fire delivering the three hebrews from nebuchadnezzar's furnace daniel 3 verses 25-28 the fourth day of creation saw the earthly and heavenly material finished sun moon stars genesis 1 verses 14-19 job was delivered and restored by god after his fourth visitor elihu finished speaking following his three miserable comforters eliphaz bildad and zofar jesus raised lazarus from the dead on the fourth day john 11 17. four important earthly elements earth air water fire four regions of the earth north south east west four divisions of the day and four night watches mark 13 35 mark 14 verse 25 earth's eternal city the new jerusalem is four square in measurement revelation 21 verse 16. four elements most biologically necessary for earthly life hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen four lunar cycles of the earth's moon new first quarter full third quarter four stages of the destroying insect palmer worm locust cankerworm and caterpillar delilah's fourth attempt to overcome samson succeeded in his blindness and slavery judges 16 verses 9 through 21 four steps in spiritual corruption lust enticed lust conceived sin death james 1 verses 14 and 15. the first four seals the four beasts association with the first four seals represents the characteristics of the spiritual power the true church would need during the times of the gentiles or seven church ages simply put the four beasts represent four anointings of the holy ghost jesus would send to the overcomers on earth a christian spiritual power is always the baptism of the holy ghost but these four beasts express special characteristics the spirit would provide the saints to combat satan's four horse riders during the church ages in scripture earthly beasts represent earthly kingdoms such as the beasts in daniel 7 representing babylon medes and persians greece and rome but the four heavenly beasts represent the kingdom of god upon the earth as for is an earthly number jesus earthly ministry introduced the kingdom of god which his apostles received within their souls on the day of pentecost for messiah taught the kingdom of god is within believers in luke 17 verse 21 identifying the four horse riders as belonging to satan is validated by looking at their works the fourth writer's name and follower the four horse riders are actually one person death revelation 6 8 says the writer's name is death and hell followed with him the writer is the cursed antichrist spirit with his identification known his four-step process of evil works are obvious conquering killing money capturing and worldwide soul destruction chapter 10 shares how today's mega churches dominate and deceive through this four-step process during the times of the gentiles satan is now taking the form of four horse riders he began as lucifer the heavenly lightbearer then entered the serpent in eden filled murderous cain and his descendants and then filled the pharisees in judas marvel not for though satan transforms from an angel of light to serpent to violent jealous worshipper to blaspheming religious clergy he is always discerned and overcome by the holy ghost yes the four horse riders are the same writer in different forms just as the four insects from joel 1 verse 4 palmerworm locust cankerworm caterpillar are the same insect in different stages of life from embryo to adult the attributes of each horse rider can be perfectly aligned with the church history presented in this chapter to show the four stages of the antichrist spirit as it heads up into death here in the final age laodicea god always acts first and then satan impersonates it just as god set up his throne in heaven first and later lucifer tried to exalt his throne above the stars of god historically god sent his first anointing the lion on the day of pentecost to seal his saints and prepare them for the battle to come in a counter-attack satan rode out against the lion as a white horse rider the process repeats until the true bride is raptured off the earth and god judges the sin-soaked world in the tribulation the first seal revelation 6 verses 1 and 2 records the lamb opening the first seal and the beast has to be the lion because the second third and fourth beasts are mentioned by order in the three succeeding seals john sees a white horse and a rider has a bow but no arrows are mentioned the rider is then crowned and goes forth conquering the lion anointing is the fierce boldness of the holy ghost the saints embodied during the ephesian and sumernian church ages and even into the pergamos age proverbs 28 verse 1 declares the wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold as a lion saints like paul iranius and martin boldly stood for christ and christ stood for them manifesting prophecies healings visions and special miracles the powerful line of the tribe of judah was with the true vine to combat and overcome the antichrist spirit the white color of the horse represents innocent deception as white often represents holiness but since the writer is the antichrist spirit his white horse represents his sly false teachings which jesus called the deeds of the nicolaitans a horse is a beast and represents power as horses are appropriately described so in job 39 verses 19-25 the rider has a bow but no arrows are mentioned here you learn two truths the antichrist spirit shot his lies like arrows from the bow of his tongue as jeremiah 9 verse 3 describes and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies your shield of faith quenches all of satan's fiery darts or lies according to ephesians 6 verse 16. second you learn satan is limited in his power for he was out of arrows he is the father of lies and as long as you withstand his untruths he cannot hurt you and make any christian disobey god a crown is given to the rider representing the first official pope damascus being crowned in 366 a.d rome conquered or overcame the lady by mixing sinful deeds in worship and exalting the clergy the lion-like holy ghost anointing battled the white horse rider for about 350 years from pentecost in 30 a.d to 385 a.d this was the fight between the bold living word and false teaching the second seal revelation 6 verses 3 and 4 records jesus opening the second seal and the second beast inviting john to come and see another horse rides this time a red one and he takes peace from the earth with a great sword the ox anointing is the sacrificial surrender of the holy ghost the saints expressed during the pergam age and part of the thyatiran age oxen were beasts of sacrifice and so christians in these ages gave their lives just as freely as god gave them to them recall priscillian and six of his disciples were said to be the first saints executed by the roman church in 385 a.d the red color of the horse represents the blood the rider shed with his great sword during the pergamian age church and state united through constantine and now the false church had power to kill anyone who opposed her it was augustine 354-430 who emboldened popes to kill anyone who disagreed with them as rome took the bible from the people she also took peace from the earth for christ and his word is the only real peace the acts like holy ghost anointing battled the red horse rider for nearly 710 years from 385 a.d to about 1095 a.d this was the fight between sacrificial saints and the roman sword the third seal revelation 6 verses 5 and 6 records jesus opening the seal and the third beast inviting john to see a black horse rider with a pair of balances in his hand a voice in the midst of the four beasts determines prices for trade and also protects oil and wine the man anointing is the wisdom of god given to saints during part of the thyroid age and in the entire sardisian and philadelphian ages while mankind is not the largest fastest or strongest living thing he is the wisest due to the spirit and soul god imparts to him the anointing of man's wisdom was needed to prepare the saints to conquer during the reformation recall how the last works of authoritarian saints were greater than their works at the beginning of the age in preparation for reformation the black horse represents the dark or middle ages it was a spiritual midnight for believers as their numbers were depleted along with their access to and understanding of the scripture the balances in the writer's hand represent rome capturing the wealth of the world stripping her subjects of all their wealth rome grew rich by controlling religion economics and agriculture she also funded her mammoth buildings by waging the crusades beginning in 1095 a.d and fighting other papal wars pope john xx showed future popes how to increase wealth through his profitable business of selling indulgences around 1 320 a.d the voice in the midst of the four beasts has to be gods since the beasts were around the throne worshiping the lord surely this is jesus's voice announcing exposing and limiting the financial aspirations of the black horse writer heaven is ultimately in control limiting rome's financial reach heaven is providing for the saints even in the dark ages we and barley have both a natural and spiritual meaning as jesus sees rome's efforts to get rich by selling natural food wheat and barley and selling false spiritual hope through indulgences the lord jesus protects the wine and oil forbidding the antichrist from hurting or injuring these two necessities of course jesus is speaking figuratively oil represents the permanent seal of the holy ghost baptism in a believer's soul and wine represents stimulation or joy from the spirit's revelation satan would not be able to hurt or hinder the true vine during these times during even the darkest times of the dark ages satan could not stop believers from receiving the holy ghost baptism and the joyful stimulation that accompanies it historically jesus protected the saints as the holy ghost revival fires continued to burn in the dark ages through men like pierre day bruise martyred in 1126 and peter waldo waldo's converts called waldensies powerfully spread the holy ghost gospel to ensure monasteries and parishes existed in many countries like france italy austria switzerland germany and bohemia to name a few these saints passed on the wine and oil until the pre-reformation saints like wycliffe huss gutenberg and erasmus could receive these blessings during the sardisian and philadelphian church ages christ administered wine and oil to luther wesley and many more laborers none would dare deny the holy man anointing upon luther defying every demon-possessed roman scholar whose sword-like wisdom cut and rightly divided the truth about salvation by faith alone apart from sacraments all the spiritual warriors from these ages possessed this man anointing overcoming the black horse rider in their unique callings the man anointing combated the black horse rider for nearly 850 years from 1095 a.d to 1906 a.d this was the fight between the wisdom of god's men and the money-hungry mother harlot the fourth seal revelation 6 verses 7 and 8 records jesus opening the seal and the fourth beast inviting john to come and see the pale horse rider go forth with hell following him power will be given them over a fourth part of the earth to kill with sword hunger death and beasts the flying eagle anointing is watchfulness saints keep during the laodicean age flying eagles watch for prey and potential adversaries ruling their territory from high altitudes jesus urges believers to sit in heavenly places and watch and pray for a second coming making their hearts and lives ready for their lord's return holy ghost-filled saints are rapture-minded meaning their thoughts are on the heavenly meeting in the air spoken of in first thessalonians 4 verse 17. our affections should be set on things above like the rapture as colossians 3 verses 1 and 2 declares like a high-flying eagle we must press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus jesus uses the eagle to represent end-time believers in matthew 24 verses 25 through 28 saying in verse 28 for wheresoever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together verse 27 tells you jesus is speaking of his second coming so you must be one of those blessed eagles anointed with god's flying eagle power the lord likens himself to an eagle in exodus 19 verse 4 proving you as his born-again child are of heavenly eagle lineage psalm 103 verse 5 and isaiah 40 verse 31 declare he renews your strength like the eagle his strength helps you fly or live above all earthbound temptations today and will lift you into the air to meet jesus at the rapture the pale horse represents the incurable disease of spiritual death striking billions now in the end time remember the writer's name is death from revelation 6 8 and so the antichrist spirit is death leading to eternal separation from christ in the greek pale means green and reminds us of the greenish plague of leprosy from leviticus 13 verses 47 through 49. if untreated and unhealed uncleanness from leprosy cause separation from the camp and ultimately death this green pale horse also symbolizes the final earthly ride of the person of the pope antichrist whose final ride in the tribulation will result in a fourth part of the earth being killed with a sword hunger death and beasts the incarnate devil antichrist will lay down the mark of the beast and any dissenters will be killed according to his fourfold strategy while he is killing on his last earthly ride jesus's bride will be safely overhead in heaven having already flown like an eagle into the skies to meet jesus at the rapture note how the writer also kills with death this speaks of spiritual death also known as blasphemy of the holy ghost or a reprobate mind in scripture recall samuel schmucker's tally of over 68 million christians who died from the sword in the 5th and 19th centuries those were natural deaths how many souls were killed with spiritual death or blasphemy of the holy ghost during those times no doubt millions upon billions died from spiritual death from rome's false doctrines of idolatry fornication and lasciviousness but in the end time death rides into a fourth part of the earth and kills nearly every remaining soul both naturally and spiritually hell always follows death like the evil rich man who despised the beggar lazarus he found himself in hell after his death and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom all beast worshippers share the same fate for denying the lamb's path to eternal life the fifth sixth and seventh seals the final three seals make no mention of horse riders or the four heavenly beasts because god's focus is off the gentiles and on the jews signaling the times of the gentiles defined by jesus in luke 21 24 are over god is again dealing with israel graciously offering them the new covenant for the second time the fifth seal found in revelation 6 verses 9 9-11 chapter 2 details the revelation of the fifth seal despite most of israel being blinded to jesus's identity as the messiah he saves all faithful jews who gave or live their lives for the testimony of the word of god the old testament scriptures the sixth seal found in revelation 6 verses 12 through 17 chapter 2 also details the revelation of this seal the wrathful indescribable punishments in the great tribulation upon beast worshipers the seven trumpets and seven last plagues mentioned in revelation chapters 8 9 11 15 and 16 outline each miserable destructive event this is the reality form of the pale horse's final earthly ride jesus provides matching details about the tribulation in matthew 24 verses 29-31 again none of the four heavenly beasts lion ox man or eagle are mentioned in the sixth seal because the anointed saints are off the earth feasting with christ at the marriage supper of the lamb the seventh seal found in revelation 8 verses 1 through 6 the seventh seal is the most mysterious verse 1 says heaven is silent when this seal opens which means the four beasts stop their unceasing day and night crying of holy holy holy before god's throne where jesus sits the only reason angels would stop worshiping jesus would be because jesus left heaven the next time jesus leaves heaven will be to meet his bride in the air at the rapture you can easily see the seventh seal is the unknown day and hour of jesus's second coming it is the moment of the last trump the third and final event of the rapture first the shout then the voice and lastly the trump at this moment believers which are alive and remain on the earth are changed from corruptable to incorruptable then rise to meet jesus and the dead in christ in the sky revelation 8 verse 6 gives proof that the judgments of god have not yet occurred because the trumpets are prepared to sound but have not yet sounded revelation 8 verse 1 shows the rapture takes place before the 7 trumpets sound the tribulation cannot begin until after the rapture revelations 7 verses 1 through 12 teaches the earth cannot be hurt by the effects of the seven trumpets until the 144 thousand jews are sealed by the holy ghost clearly the faithful jews are sealed by the spirit during the tribulation after the jew gentile bride is raptured and the times of the gentiles are completed the seven seals jesus snatching away his wife off the earth while heaven is making ready for judgments upon the sinners seven is god's number of completion so the seventh seal speaks of jesus bringing an ending to the times of the gentiles or seven church ages jesus's great commission is finished every nation has heard and the elect have received the holy spirit mercy is over for the gentiles and israel's blindness will now be taken away the 144 thousand guileless israeli saints will be grafted back into god's holy tree by the baptism of the holy ghost the revelation of the seven seals brought to earth it may surprise you to know that the interpretation you just read of the seven seals was sent to the earth in march 1963. while i understand the gravity of this statement i maintain its accuracy because god's prophet william branham spoke the interpretation of the seven seals with thus saith the lord look now to see how scripture foretold the revelation of the seals coming to earth revelation 10 shows the interpretation or revelation of the seven seals being brought to earth by a mighty angel which must be christ in the form of the holy ghost because his description matches john's earlier vision of jesus in revelation 1 verses 13-16 the holy ghost met branham daily between march 18th through the 24th 1963 to reveal each seal to him before he went to the pulpit to preach revelation 10 verse 2 says a little open book is in jesus hand as he reigns over the sea and earth this is the same seven seal book jesus took in revelation 5 verses 1 through 5 and then loosed or opened in revelation 6 and 8 verse 1. the revelation of the seven seals had to be brought to earth by christ's spirit for he was the only one worthy to loose the seals in revelation 10 verse 3 christ cries like a lion for he is the lion of the tribe of judah seven thunders utter their voices as christ cries but john is not allowed to write what was spoken verse 7 says when the mystery of god contained in the voices of the seven thunders would be finished or performed in the days of the seventh angel the seventh angel of revelation 10 verse 7 cannot be the heavenly angelic trumpet-blowing seventh angel from revelation 11 15 because their ministries are totally different when the seventh trumpet blows in revelation 11 15 the kingdoms of this world end and christ reigns on the earth in the millennium simply put the times of the gentiles ends and there is no more saving souls or missionary work to be done once the seventh trumpet sounds but in revelation 10 verse 7 and its following verses 8 through 11 speak of further soul saving to the gentiles verse 11 says the prophecy contained in the interpretation of the seven seals must be prophesied again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings the revelation 10 verse 7 seventh angel has to be the same seventh angel to the church in laodicea from revelation 3 verse 14 because both have a final worldwide message to the gentiles jesus said in matthew 24 14 that the gospel must be preached to all nations and then the end of human history would come in simplest terms revelation 10 is jesus's spirit coming to earth in march of 1963 to give the interpretation of the seven seals to william branham now you and i like john must spiritually eat the revelation of the seven seals and preach it to all nations for a witness and then the end shall come share them until the last soul is saved until the fullness of the gentiles be come in the seven thunders are the revelations contained in the seven sermons william branham preached on the seven seals when branham preached the first seal on monday march 18 1963 he shared jesus's revelation of the first seal since it was jesus's revelation it was his voice thundering upon the earth each succeeding sermon about a seal was another thunder until all seven were complete numerous scriptures teach god's voice is like a thunder second samuel 22 14 says the lord thundered from heaven and the most high uttered his voice the people who heard god's voice speaking to christ in john 12 28 and 29 said it thundered christ's voice has thundered on the earth daniel 12 4 has been fulfilled the once-sealed book is now loosed for it is the time of the end when travel technology and knowledge has increased chapter 13 will explain more about the prophecies we are to prophesy again to the world the church age is foretold in judges and joshua leaving the seven seals and returning to the church ages recall from chapter 4 that the church ages were foretold in judges 14 when samson held a seven-day feast for his perspective philistine gentile wife samson's riddle is not known until his gentile bride reveals it on the seventh and final day this type that the full revelation of god's bible would be made known to and through jesus's gentile bride in the seventh church age or laodicean age revelation 10 verse 7 supports this as the mystery of god would be finished through the seventh angel messenger and then taken around the world to every gentile nation by jesus's bride additionally william branham's god ordained teaching on the church ages was foretold in joshua chapters 18 and 19. note the sermons were preached in december through january 1960 through 1961 and the book version and exposition of the seven church ages was published in december 1965 i am thankful the lord revealed the foretelling of the exposition book in joshua 18 and 19 to my brother simon a faithful bible teacher and missionary joshua 18 verses 1 through 10 finds the promised land subdued before israel and joshua still needs seven tribes to possess their land inheritance he sends out men into the land to explore and bring back its descriptions to joshua so he can divide the land the men come back with a book describing the land cities and dividing them up into seven parts joshua cast lots before the lord and assigns the seven land plots to the seven tribes this assignment had to take place before the prophet joshua's death two applications are apparent the first is jesus as joshua placing his four known overcomers in the church ages of his choosing the seven part book symbolizes jesus's letters to the seven gentile cities in revelation chapters two and three you can rejoice that jesus placed you in the seventh age laodicea as you can zealously repent and execute hot fervent works for his holy name a second application is brother branham as joshua the seven part book represents his seven sermons on the seven church ages preached in december 1960 having received the revelation of the seven cities as seven church ages branham could place the believers of church history in their matching respective ages and write his exposition their historical placement had to come while the prophet was yet alive as his book was published just a few weeks before he went home to be with the lord the rewards for receiving the revelation of the seven stars and seven candlesticks you will gain at least three rewards if you receive this chapter's revelations first you will understand church history correctly for example when historians magnify constantine and paint him as a righteous christian you will know that is not the case because his corrupt fruits murder pride etc proved he was a corrupt tree also god's plan to permit the true church to lose some of its revelation as it descended into the dark ages becomes clear just as god let jesus enter the darkness of death but god's resurrection power brought jesus out of darkness and into the light just as he was going to restore the church through sardis reformation philadelphia's open door and laodicea's restitution second you will finally understand the book of revelation and thereby overcome the false vine of our age its symbols timing and themes will last make sense the same symbols john uses match those of ezekiel jeremiah zechariah and the rest of the prophets you will see jesus's separations between the times of the gentiles and his return to the 144 thousand jews most importantly you will see your responsibility as an overcomer and the unsearchable rewards awaiting you in the millennium and new jerusalem third the keystone of the entire bible god and his ways are unchanging unlocks the entire book of scripture you identify the true and false vines from genesis to revelation you see jesus christ in every scripture god's burning stars his prophets and preachers illuminate every age and generation from adam to today jesus of the seven church ages is the god of every age and his marvelous grace and power extend to each the consequences for rejecting the revelation of the seven stars and seven candlesticks there are at least two consequences for rejecting these revelations first rejecting jesus stars or seven church age messengers is refusing jesus's hand-picked lightbearers john 13 verse 20 says verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me turning down jesus stars is essentially turning down christ the light of the world jesus himself was shining through those seven stars no doubt paul was not perfect as he committed sins he hated martin luther made mistakes that caused many people much pain william branham's memory was imperfect but remember all of god's servants needed his grace abraham lied numerous times and even laughed in unbelief at god's promise moses killed a man and magnified himself rather than god which kept him out of canaan david had uriah killed after selfishly committing adultery with his wife jonah ran from god's presence and was angered that he did not destroy nineveh despite each servant's weakness they were later made strong by god's power his divine patience forgave his stars so they could again shine his light jesus says all that is left for rejecting him and his stars is judgment according to john 12 verses 47 and 48 and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i came not to judge the world but to save the world he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day may god be merciful to those who reject his stars the second consequence builds upon the first for rejecting the bright stars in jesus hand makes it easier to reject oil light from the candlesticks if you miss god's messenger in an age you will miss his plans for that period for example rejecting john wesley's ministry leads one to revile the vast brotherly love inspired open door missionary efforts of the 18th and 19th centuries currently rejecting branham's bible message redirects one out of jesus's light for these tumultuous times in which we live following branham's bible revelations is truly following jesus as john 8 verse 12 reads then spake jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life rejecting branham's bible message today is refusing to walk in the holy light of the seven golden candlesticks remember jesus is standing there in the midst of the candlesticks according to revelation 1 verses 12 and 13. jesus is inviting one and all to come to the truth of this age he will give mercy to those who walk in the light but those outside are liars and filthy first john 1 verse 6 and 7 declares if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin conclusion identifying jesus's seven stars and the light of each candlestick for each age helps you see god's past current and future actions he is empowering his bride to overcome the darkness of jezebel and her daughters jesus seven stars shine his truth in the midst of the darkness of iniquity christ's lights are witnesses and standards by his grace you have seen his light just in time as we are at the end of the times of the gentiles now let jesus's candlestick light reflect upon your life imitate the light of the seven stars follow the examples of the saints from ephesus to laodicea it is time to shine fulfill isaiah 60 verses 1 and 2 arise shine for thy light has come and the glory of the lord has risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall rise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee hallelujah action steps step one since it is most urgent for you to walk in the light of your age laodicea's call for zealous repentance contact me or go to www.messagehub.info to access the sermons of jesus's star for this age william branham step 2 locate a home church that teaches god's revelations given to brother branham as the fivefold preaching ministry will bring you as part of jesus's bride to perfection ephesians 4 verses 7 through 16. step 3 for an in-depth understanding of church history purchase and read branham's book and exposition of the seven church ages this will lead you into many more enriching studies in church history
