TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Oh [Music] greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to teach an overview on the book of Revelation God promised to bless those who read or hear this book and also keep the things that are written in this prophetic book of tremendous importance the word revelation means to lay bare or make visible so the book of Revelation is the unveiling of Jesus Christ Himself who he is who his true servants are who his enemies are what his plans are for Humanity and the destinies of all men and also angels to begin with the foundation of our understanding of the book of Revelation comes not from a theological seminary but from thus saith the Lord through God's endtime prophet William Branham Amos chapter 3 verses 7 and 8 state that God will do nothing except he first reveal his secrets to his servants the prophets and that was what God did in 1960 and 1963 God supernaturally revealed the secrets behind the Bible symbols of three complete chapters in the book of Revelation chapters 2 3 and 6 and then God had his prophet brother Branham speak God's own stamp of approval by proclaiming that the teachings were thus saith the Lord now the vision plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together so I could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the Word of God and the vision and the revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith along a summary of the book of Revelation would be as follows in Chapter 1 st. John received the revelation of Jesus Christ and saw Christ in his supreme deity proving that Christ is not a second person but the image of the one person of God for in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily Jesus Christ is God Christ's physical appearance his Sevenfold glory as supreme judge of the universe as he held the seven stars in his hand and stood in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks in chapters 2 and 3 Christ gave his messages to the seven stars or angels to the seven Gentile churches these angels were seven human preachers that God would anoint with his spirit to preach during the times of the Gentiles which lasted from 53 ad up to the current time Christ's words would give overcoming power to the true believers the New Testament church as they fought against all the forms of Satan's Antichrist religion over the past 2,000 years at the conclusion of this glorious book in chapters 21 and 22 we see these New Testament believers receiving the exact rewards Christ promised them such as the right to the Tree of Life in chapters 4 and 5 John was taken to the heavenly throne and saw Jesus Christ as the only worthy one who could lose the seven sealed book of redemption in heaven because of his all sufficient sacrifice on the cross of Calvary this proves that the blood of Jesus Christ shed on Calvary is still our only foundation for any spiritual blessing including salvation forgiveness divine healing Bible revelation and any other spiritual blessing in Chapter 6 Christ the Lamb opened the first six seals of the book the first four seals revealed Satan's four evil horse riders that would battle the New Testament Bride of Christ trying to defile her and make her lukewarm but we learned that God would use the four living creatures lion ox man and flying eagle to symbolize the holy ghost anointings by which the true Christians would defeat and overcome Satan's devices the fifth seal revealed the spiritual condition and location of the faithful Jews and the sixth seal revealed portions of the destruction during the tribulation period in Chapter 7 John saw the first view of the 144,000 Jews receiving the gospel of Jesus Christ and the you love God or baptism of the Holy Ghost during the Tribulation Period the chapter ends by showing the New Testament church or Bride of Christ already raptured up to heaven and in the midst of worshipping and serving their Lord the Lamb of God Jesus Christ in Chapter eight John saw the seventh and final seal opened which we believe to be the day and hour of the rapture of the New Testament Bride of Christ immediately after the opening of the seventh seal four of the seven trumpets of the Tribulation Period will sound bringing great judgments upon the earth and its inhabitants that miss the rapture in Chapter 9 John saw the sounding of the fifth and sixth trumpets and the passing of the first row which will take place after the rapture and during the Tribulation Period in chapter 10 John saw Christ as a mighty angel come down to earth with the open book of the seven seals mentioned in Revelation chapters four five six and eight and we are shown how God planned to finish all the mysteries of the Bible Christ would come to earth and give the revelation of the Bible to his seventh angel who would be a prophet and then at the end of the chapter John himself was a symbol of the New Testament church who would eat the book or believe and live the true revelation of the Bible and then spread those mystery truths to many peoples and nations and tongues and kings to finish Jesus's Great Commission in order to prepare the bride of Jesus Christ for the rapture in Chapter 11 John saw the Ministry of two witnesses or prophets who had prophesied to the faithful Jewish remnant during the Tribulation Period the passing of the second woe and the seventh trumpet sounding is also seen in the eleventh chapter it is crucial to notice that the New Testament church or Bride of Christ is scarcely mentioned in the chapters that deal with the destructive Tribulation Period which include chapters 8 9 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 and 18 and this is because Jesus Christ will rapture his bride off the earth for the Tribulation Period begins in Chapter 12 John saw a vision of Israel as she was the woman clothed with the Sun who brought forth a man child Jesus Christ whom the great dragon Satan tried to devour but failed this chapter shows how Satan has continually hated God's covenant people Israel attempting to persecute Christ at his birth and also attempting to destroy Israel during the Tribulation Period in chapter 13 john saw the beast out of the sea which was the ancient roman empire get new life in the holy roman empire and then become the beast out of the earth which is the roman catholic church working in the united states of america notice Rome rules the world until the second coming of Jesus Christ just as daniel chapters 2 7 and 8 teach us the order of Gentile kingdoms until the return of Christ which was Babylon Medes and Persians the number of the beast is a number of a man the title once ascribed to the Pope of Rome vicarious filet de which equals 666 in Roman numerals in chapters 14 15 and 16 John saw more scenes from the Tribulation Period which included another scene of the Lamb with his 144,000 Jewish saints on Mount Zion the announcements of the three angels and the Battle of Armageddon the last seven plagues the victors over the beast and the pouring out of the seven vials of the wrath of God in Revelation chapters 17 and 18 john saw a beautiful woman that made him wonder with great admiration because she was called the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth these two chapters reveal the identity of this woman who is the real enemy of the true Christian Church the Roman Catholic Church John learned of her evils such as being drunk with the blood of the saints as the Inquisition of the Roman Catholic Church caused many innocent believers to lose their lives then John also foresaw her destruction that comes in one hour of one day the Tribulation Period in chapter 19 we finally see a return to John being shown the new testament church the Bride of Christ after not seeing her during the tribulation chapters of the book of Revelation which included chapters 8 9 11 through 18 heaven literally announced a blessing upon those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb this marriage supper of Christ and his New Testament church will take place in heaven while the earth is being judged during the Great Tribulation Period chapter 19 closes by showing Christ's return to the earth after the marriage supper he will come riding a white horse with his army of resurrected Saints to destroy all remaining sinners who took the mark of the beast at what is known as the Battle of Armageddon we must notice that these false Christians suffer the same awful destiny as the false Jews a heaven Jezebel did being eaten by animals because these false Christians had the same evil spirit the spirit of Jezebel that hated the true holy spirit in chapter 20 John finally got to see what would happen after the Tribulation Period and he saw the 1,000 year earthly reign of Christ his New Testament church and the faithful Jews this 1000 year millennium of peace is the day of rest that Christ enjoys with his people since Satan had used his sinful tactics to interrupt the seventh day of God's creation in the Garden of Eden at the end of the 1,000 years Satan is loosed and gathers all the nations against Christ and his people but fire from heaven comes down in devour Satan and his earthly followers this chapter ends with a great white throne judgment where the New Testament church sits with Christ upon the judgment throne and all people from all generations including the fallen angels will be judged and given either eternal life or cast into the lake of fire which is the second and final death or separation from God's presence in chapters 21 and 22 John gave us a glimpse of the new heaven and the new earth which includes the City of God the to Jerusalem which will have no sin in its domain as we see the transition from time into eternity john saw a glorious description of the return and full restoration of the holy sinless conditions that were first present in the Garden of Eden one man Christ with his one wife the New Testament church Christians savor Jesus's final commands for faithfulness and his unfailing promises of love to his children such as surely I come quickly this
