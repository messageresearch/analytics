[31:32] shorter
[31:38] i want to share it here in a minute i'll
[31:40] share a few things i want to just
[31:41] some current events i'd like to update
[31:43] john i want to share amen had a real

[32:09] so we want to finish the series lord
[32:10] willing tonight we'll see how it goes
[32:12] uh about the mystery of god's will
[32:17] the bible clearly calls it a mystery so
[32:20] to the world
[32:20] and denomination it's going to be a
[32:22] mystery uh but to god's elect god's
[32:24] dearly beloved
[32:26] it's going to be revealed and it's going
[32:27] to be made known praise god
[32:29] and so we're grateful for that all the
[32:30] mysteries of god must be finished in the
[32:32] end time and taken around the world
[32:34] and so we're grateful that this mystery
[32:36] has been revealed and we're living it
[32:38] praise god we're living in the mystery
[32:40] of the revelation rather of the mystery
[32:41] of god
[32:42] thank the lord for that first john i'm
[32:45] sorry 217 first john 2 17.
[32:49] let's read that together ready one two
[32:51] three and the world
[32:52] passeth away and the lust thereof
[32:56] but he that doeth the will of god
[32:58] abideth forever may god add his
[33:00] blessings to rhema's word you may be
[33:02] seated praise god
[33:03] now you can switch over acacia to the
[33:07] i just got a few things i want to share
[33:08] on my phone real quick and i don't
[33:10] really have any other slides other than
[33:11] that
[33:12] um here let me start with that
[33:16] i'll start with this one brother amen
[33:17] had a good question because this morning
[33:19] we were looking at dearly beloved and
[33:20] how one of the meanings is like a
[33:22] favorite
[33:25] so i was pointing out how god has
[33:28] favorites
[33:30] he offers he offers uh salvation to all
[33:33] but then he has
[33:34] ones that will be his favorites and
[33:36] brother ram likens it unto a husband and
[33:38] wife right
[33:38] there's many women out there there's
[33:39] many churches but christ chose one
[33:42] church the bride right
[33:43] and now we know she's part of many
[33:45] different churches but it's a spiritual
[33:47] choosing um and he had a good question
[33:50] he said what about the scriptures about
[33:52] partiality i think that was an excellent
[33:53] question with amen excellent question
[33:56] um so i just thought i would briefly
[33:59] say it um there's a few scriptures on
[34:01] partiality
[34:03] in the days of malachi they were
[34:05] backslidden right so that god had to
[34:07] send a prophet
[34:08] so he said or they admitted they've been
[34:10] partial to the law so obviously being
[34:12] partial is a sin right
[34:14] being partial in the law and judgment
[34:17] first timothy 5 21 i charge thee before
[34:19] god and the lord jesus christ and the
[34:21] elect angels
[34:22] that thou observe these things without
[34:24] preferring one before another doing
[34:26] nothing by partiality
[34:27] so concerning god's commands we're not
[34:29] partial to any of them we obey all of
[34:32] them
[34:33] okay uh now here's a good one james 2 4.
[34:36] let's get the context of this one the
[34:38] context is someone walks into the church
[34:40] that's rich
[34:41] and says oh oh sit up right up front
[34:42] here right or
[34:44] somebody's so rich oh why don't you
[34:45] preach tonight you're rich you've got
[34:46] gold rings on and
[34:49] um so he said don't have a respect to
[34:51] persons if someone comes in with good
[34:53] you know fancy clothes on
[34:55] um and are you then not partial in
[34:59] yourselves and become
[35:00] judges of evil thoughts so i tried to
[35:03] just briefly
[35:04] amen and i didn't have much time but i
[35:05] just tried to show this morning as we're
[35:07] looking at
[35:08] dearly beloved that's dealing with
[35:09] relationship
[35:11] right that's dealing with relationship
[35:13] so it and brother brahms said you're
[35:14] going gonna have friends that are
[35:16] more special than others right you know
[35:18] so you're just gonna have relationships
[35:20] there now they're god ordained
[35:21] relationships
[35:22] where you trust those people more you
[35:24] have a more intimate connection because
[35:26] of the holy spirit
[35:28] and so in other words like a husband and
[35:29] wife god is going to choose
[35:31] groups of people where uh where you are
[35:34] you are extremely close to them right
[35:37] but you'll still treat everybody the
[35:38] same right as far as
[35:40] you'll still treat them with love and
[35:41] care and everything like that but you
[35:43] are going to have people that
[35:45] uh they're your favorites that that's
[35:47] kind of what brother bam said
[35:48] you have special friends um but you know
[35:51] it's because of god's grace
[35:53] it's a god it's a god-given choice i'm
[35:56] sorry it's a god-given
[35:57] uh blessing for your choice to follow
[35:59] him and so i hope that i hope that comes
[36:01] off right
[36:02] if not we can study more scriptures on
[36:04] it you know but another one
[36:06] this one's about wisdom with when we
[36:08] exercise wisdom
[36:10] which is choosing which is the right
[36:12] choice at the right time remember that's
[36:13] wisdom knowledge is just what
[36:14] what to do but wisdom is when to do it
[36:17] and how to do it
[36:18] so he says but the wisdom that's from
[36:20] above is pure peaceable
[36:21] gentle easy to being treated full of
[36:23] mercy and good fruits without
[36:25] without partiality and without hypocrisy
[36:28] so you know uh in our dealings with
[36:32] people
[36:32] we have to give wisdom without
[36:34] partiality right we have to give
[36:36] instruction
[36:37] no matter if they're a close friend or
[36:38] not we should give god's wisdom equally
[36:40] to all
[36:42] but i was sharing with brother amen when
[36:43] he asked me that the scripture came to
[36:44] me i'd never thought about it before
[36:46] but the scripture came to me jesus had
[36:48] three really close disciples
[36:50] he had 12 but he had three really close
[36:52] ones peter
[36:53] james and john right and there was those
[36:56] three
[36:57] could go up to mount transfiguration
[36:59] those three could go in the house with a
[37:01] little girl jairus daughter
[37:03] where was everybody else he had certain
[37:06] ones that were closer than others
[37:08] right and so we'll have that in our
[37:10] lives we'll have those who are
[37:12] extremely close by a spiritual bond that
[37:15] god has given to us
[37:17] and now favorite may may not be the
[37:18] right word to use but it came up in the
[37:20] lexicon so i was enjoying that this
[37:22] morning i just thought i'm one of god's
[37:24] favorites praise god
[37:25] not because anything you know
[37:27] necessarily different about us
[37:29] we just love god's word and that
[37:31] automatically creates a spiritual bond
[37:33] right it creates a blessing of god
[37:35] when you obey god you get the blessings
[37:37] of god so i try to i hope that helps a
[37:39] little bit uh but that was an absolute
[37:41] great
[37:41] question brother amen um yeah we're not
[37:44] to be we're not to be
[37:45] partial in pouring out wisdom and
[37:48] judgment
[37:48] and discernment and even love because
[37:50] we're to love our enemies
[37:52] but god it will give us special
[37:54] relationships
[37:55] that will treasure above others right
[37:59] i mean think of all the message people
[38:01] i've met but yet i've got a group of
[38:03] close really fr real close friends that
[38:05] i just treasure those relationships more
[38:07] than others
[38:08] and i hope you do as well by god's grace
[38:10] if you don't like we said this morning a
[38:12] friend
[38:12] shows himself friendly right like
[38:16] i even apologize to john out there i
[38:17] said sometimes i'm not a really good
[38:19] friend
[38:19] because i just all i think about is you
[38:21] know i'm preaching
[38:22] that's all i can think about helping my
[38:24] family cleaning the house you know
[38:26] washing dishes johnny called me this
[38:28] week i really appreciated it but i was
[38:30] washing dishes so
[38:30] was he was surprised i picked up because
[38:32] sometimes i don't pick up
[38:34] but i said i'm washing dishes i got free
[38:36] time you know i can just pick up there
[38:40] so god you know he places certain people
[38:42] that they're going to be naturally
[38:45] naturally just closer to us so i hope
[38:47] that's a blessing
[38:48] uh by god's grace like you know paul he
[38:50] had he loved everybody right he had all
[38:52] these
[38:52] you know loving relationships but then
[38:54] he had my son my dearly beloved son the
[38:56] gospel timothy
[38:57] you know he just had partners in the
[38:59] gospel that he was naturally going to be
[39:00] closer to
[39:02] so i hope that helps a little bit by
[39:03] god's grace i hope so buddy if not we
[39:05] can definitely do more studies on it
[39:07] because i never thought about that
[39:08] question that was a good question i was
[39:09] just all caught up in
[39:11] the beloved you know the bride you know
[39:12] we're the bride and uh but yeah brother
[39:14] does say we have uh real good close
[39:16] friends i don't know did you see this
[39:18] this week
[39:20] catholic leaders condemn pope francis's
[39:23] endorsement of same
[39:24] sex unions wow
[39:28] uh the mother harlot uh november should
[39:31] be full of abominations think of all the
[39:32] abominations she already has
[39:34] right with idolatry transubstantiation
[39:37] uh mary worship i mean think about all
[39:39] the and now here's another one
[39:41] now if you read the article if you want
[39:42] i can share it with you um i read it
[39:44] before service
[39:47] uh pope francis is on record saying
[39:50] homosexuality is
[39:51] is okay and we have to accept them and
[39:53] i'm sorry he's sorry that they've been
[39:55] mistreated
[39:57] but the interview was from from 2019 so
[40:00] they've hit it
[40:01] for a whole year and it just came out
[40:03] now i don't understand the timing of
[40:04] that i don't know why they would i know
[40:05] why they'd hide that
[40:06] because it's going to make a lot of
[40:08] catholics upset because it's so far
[40:10] left it's so evil it's so abominable
[40:14] now not the souls of the people i you
[40:16] know they can they can come out of that
[40:18] we know
[40:18] i've met people in the message that have
[40:19] come out of homosexuality right numerous
[40:22] and it's amazing god can still save them
[40:24] but most of them will be
[40:25] reprobate-minded
[40:26] and most of them will be lost okay i'm
[40:29] not
[40:29] condemning them that's what the word of
[40:31] god says and i don't know each and every
[40:33] case i can't condemn individual cases
[40:35] but i just thought i'd share that with
[40:36] you i was frankly shocked
[40:39] because you know it seems like the
[40:40] catholic church would just stay on like
[40:41] you know no abortion
[40:43] no like they're big on family right you
[40:45] know we have we have family members are
[40:46] catholic and they're big on having
[40:47] children they're big on
[40:49] you know husband and wife and the family
[40:52] culture so i was just i was shocked to
[40:54] see that
[40:54] um so if you want the article i can
[40:57] share it with you but
[40:58] just another sign you know about uh
[41:01] i mean i guess in one way maybe i
[41:03] shouldn't be surprised because
[41:06] lutherans and everybody else you know
[41:08] presbyterians they're adopting
[41:10] homosexual leaders right
[41:12] and they've got to unite on i mean
[41:13] they've got to unite on all these things
[41:14] but i said the last thing may be the
[41:15] communion though
[41:16] unite on he did say that so uh just a
[41:19] little bit very sad news but again
[41:22] she's a mother harlot and she's the cage
[41:24] of every
[41:25] unclean and hateful spirit that's
[41:27] another spirit right
[41:28] another uh evil spirit that has to be in
[41:30] that cage
[41:32] sadly but i just thought i'd update you
[41:33] on that okay so you can you can turn off
[41:35] my phone now
[41:36] that's all i have i i wasn't really i
[41:38] didn't have any notes really to show for
[41:40] tonight
[41:40] i got them on my ipad and they're kind
[41:43] of not they're not very nice to look at
[41:44] as far as they got writing all over them
[41:46] and different colors and everything
[41:48] so uh glory to god in the church say
[41:51] amen
[41:52] amen they can do whatever they want
[41:54] they're the false bride
[41:55] we're the truth we keep all the word of
[41:58] god
[41:59] so we just need to remember to pray god
[42:01] save what you can
[42:02] save what you can and use us to do it uh
[42:05] if you're willing by god's grace
[42:07] so let's take them a little bit here
[42:09] i'll set the timer when we do 40 minutes
[42:11] i'll try to preach in about 40 minutes
[42:12] we'll see how we do
[42:14] i just want to finish this thought
[42:15] tonight on the revelation
[42:18] of the mystery of god's will amen
[42:22] hope you've enjoyed it like i said
[42:23] brother cam's family is reading this
[42:24] this chapter right now for their
[42:26] devotions and he said he's really
[42:27] enjoying it he said it's really solid
[42:29] so that's my prayer that's my prayer my
[42:31] prayers to do my part of revelation 10
[42:34] 7 to 11. to take that
[42:37] word of god and prophesy it again to
[42:39] many nations kindreds peoples and
[42:41] tongues
[42:41] i want to do my part in taking that
[42:43] mystery that open book revelation
[42:46] and taking it to the world i just want
[42:47] to do my little part uh by god's grace
[42:51] so uh seem like there's something else i
[42:53] want to say
[42:57] i just can't think of it now maybe i
[42:58] thought there's something else i wanted
[42:59] to say
[43:01] all right forgive me okay so let's just
[43:02] quickly i just want to do a quick
[43:04] summary uh ephesians 1 9 says god has
[43:07] made known to
[43:08] us the mystery of his will right and
[43:11] that's because we wanted to know it
[43:13] the bible says the eyes of the lord go
[43:14] run around the earth searching for he
[43:16] that
[43:17] has a pure heart right and god is the uh
[43:19] the father is searching for true
[43:21] worshipers
[43:22] that will worship him in spirit and
[43:23] truth so that's why god found you
[43:25] because he knew you'd want the truth
[43:27] praise god
[43:28] and so it's made known to us and we saw
[43:30] it's a holy calling second timothy 1
[43:33] 9 says he's called us with a holy
[43:35] calling so the will of god is known
[43:38] it's holy ephesians 1 4 we're chosen in
[43:41] him before the foundation world that we
[43:43] should be
[43:44] holy and without blame before him in
[43:47] love
[43:48] praise god uh and then also we know the
[43:51] will of god means desire or pleasure so
[43:54] god has revealed to us the mystery of
[43:56] his desire
[43:57] the mystery of his pleasure and uh this
[44:00] is my summary of it the revelation the
[44:02] mystery of god's will
[44:03] is god initiates so that means he
[44:06] reaches out to us and rev
[44:08] reveals his will to every person making
[44:11] them responsible
[44:13] for responding to him and seeking his
[44:16] future desires
[44:17] that's what i believe because there's a
[44:18] lot of questions about the will of god
[44:20] is it known and
[44:21] who's whose responsibility is and i
[44:23] believe god
[44:24] reaches out to every heart praise god i
[44:26] believe god so wants to save each one of
[44:28] them he doesn't delight in people being
[44:30] lost
[44:30] he delights in those being saved amen i
[44:33] know he knows
[44:34] some won't be saved we know that but the
[44:35] bible said god does not delight in the
[44:37] death of the wicked
[44:38] and so uh now we know there's three
[44:42] aspects to god's will there's a
[44:43] sovereign will which
[44:44] no one can change nothing can change it
[44:46] it's going to happen
[44:48] now there's the known will of god which
[44:50] is the holy word of god amen
[44:51] the bible but then after that then
[44:54] there's the progressive
[44:55] will of god the future will that he
[44:57] makes known to us and that's one reason
[44:59] why we're here tonight aren't you
[45:01] right i'm here tonight you're here
[45:02] tonight so god can further make known
[45:04] his desires for my life
[45:07] and your life right no doubt about it
[45:09] that's what we want all of us are here
[45:11] to we want to know more about his known
[45:13] will right we want to know more about
[45:14] the bible
[45:15] but we also want to know more about his
[45:17] future desires for us and what we should
[45:19] do
[45:21] and now uh there's two aspects to
[45:23] finding god's
[45:24] progressive will remember it was there's
[45:27] two things
[45:28] his progress his future will always has
[45:30] to line up with his known will his word
[45:33] it can't be outside the word it's going
[45:34] to line up with the word if it's going
[45:36] to be the perfect will of god
[45:37] and the second thing is it has to be in
[45:39] his season the brotherham talked out
[45:41] about the five musts
[45:42] i think you can summarize them in there
[45:44] um
[45:45] in those things because we we know it
[45:48] came by the prophet the word of god
[45:49] always comes by a prophet
[45:50] all the other five months i believe it
[45:52] can be summarized in there
[45:54] now his progressive will then i we
[45:57] showed how
[45:58] there's always service david did the
[46:00] david served his generation by the will
[46:02] of god
[46:03] so whenever you're in the perfect will
[46:04] of god you're going to be serving others
[46:07] you're not the one being served you are
[46:09] actually laboring for other people
[46:11] when you're in god's perfect will praise
[46:13] god and then also you have submission
[46:16] you're learning to submit when you're in
[46:17] god's perfect will
[46:18] submit to church leadership right uh and
[46:21] family members
[46:22] you know we have to submit to our family
[46:23] members and we have to submit to the
[46:25] government right as long as they don't
[46:27] go outside the word of god and then the
[46:30] third thing is there's always suffering
[46:32] jesus learned to obey by the things he
[46:34] suffered
[46:35] so if we're to obey god's will and go in
[46:38] the perfect will of god
[46:39] we have to learn how to suffer and obey
[46:42] in the midst of it praise god then we
[46:46] saw how
[46:46] we find the permissive will of god
[46:48] that's by the bible said romans 12 this
[46:50] is how you prove the perfect will of god
[46:53] you present your body living sacrifice
[46:55] and you let the word of god
[46:56] transform your mind that's why you're
[46:57] here tonight praise god you get a good
[46:59] brain washing right to clear up
[47:00] clear up your mind just get everything
[47:02] out that's not everything that's
[47:04] darkness get it out and let the light of
[47:05] christ shine into our minds
[47:07] amen that's and then they says then you
[47:09] can prove to people
[47:11] the perfect will of god amen and so
[47:14] that's what we want to do we want to
[47:15] prove all things how many believe that
[47:17] let's prove all things we should be able
[47:18] to prove all things by the word of god
[47:21] now uh let me now go into the things i
[47:24] haven't really preached we looked at
[47:26] gifts and we looked at marriages and
[47:27] jobs and vocations and
[47:29] locations i'm not going to review that
[47:32] i'm going to go right to
[47:33] what's left of what i wanted to preach
[47:34] and what i felt led to right on so
[47:37] let's look at some rewards here are the
[47:39] rewards
[47:40] for doing god's will and i'll just give
[47:43] you
[47:43] a little preview they're glorious
[47:46] because you really can't get anything
[47:47] more glorious than eternal life
[47:49] so first john 2 17 we read it the world
[47:52] passes away
[47:53] and the lust thereof but he that doeth
[47:56] the will of god
[47:57] abideth forever amen
[48:00] so the first reward is eternal life
[48:04] you will abide forever think of that a
[48:07] country where
[48:08] you never cease to exist you'll always
[48:10] be there
[48:11] you will abide there you'll live there
[48:14] uh like the bible says you
[48:15] have to worry about another person
[48:17] living in your house or another in the
[48:19] millennium you want to worry about
[48:20] somebody
[48:20] harvesting your crops you'll get to do
[48:22] it i really don't like heart i don't
[48:24] really like
[48:25] gardening that much maybe i'll get to do
[48:26] something different but uh
[48:29] but the bible says it you know it will
[48:31] have a stability
[48:32] and with eternal life it'll be so stable
[48:35] all because you did god's will you chose
[48:38] to do
[48:38] what the word said here and so in the
[48:41] next kingdom god's when
[48:42] god's kingdom truly comes in the
[48:44] physical aspect of it
[48:46] he makes you a ruler there as well and
[48:49] you're a steady
[48:50] you're a steady uh say like pillar i
[48:53] guess i'll say like that
[48:54] you're a steady presence in pillar for a
[48:56] thousand years man
[48:58] ruling with a rod of iron many of us
[49:00] will be ruling with rods of iron it
[49:01] seems like according to the scripture
[49:03] because all the overcomers were promised
[49:04] that
[49:05] in the sardis church age so see church
[49:08] living god's will
[49:09] in this short fleeting life entitles you
[49:13] to
[49:14] unimaginably amazing eternal life to
[49:17] come
[49:18] just we just have a short vapor anybody
[49:20] seen a vapor this week with all the cold
[49:22] you know you
[49:22] see it from the exhaust from the cars
[49:24] you know you see it when it got hot it
[49:26] got up to 77 this week right
[49:28] 80. you see the when we had frost that
[49:30] morning in one of the mornings
[49:32] and you see it evaporate that's like
[49:33] your life that's like our lives right
[49:36] it looked pretty good for a while right
[49:38] but then it's going to fade pretty soon
[49:40] right if the lord tarries and look look
[49:43] real real strong looks real strong but
[49:45] then it quickly fades away
[49:46] time moves so fast i was telling brother
[49:48] stephen this morning i said brother you
[49:49] just keep on that
[49:51] graduate degree he's working on a
[49:53] graduate degree and it seems like it's
[49:54] going to be so far
[49:56] it's going to take so long to get there
[49:58] it's going to go like this don't you
[49:59] think sister diana
[50:00] couple years ago like that you just
[50:02] think about it since the gram's been
[50:04] here it's been two years can you believe
[50:05] that
[50:06] just like that and it just seemed like
[50:08] how did that happen
[50:09] it's a vapor but yet we're to the bible
[50:12] says we're to cherish
[50:13] every moment praise god and redeem the
[50:16] time because the days are evil praise
[50:17] god and we have been redeeming the time
[50:19] amen
[50:20] i've never been happier praise god we've
[50:21] never been enjoying such a fellowship
[50:24] like this
[50:25] we've never enjoyed it like this it's
[50:26] just been wonderful praise god
[50:28] it keeps going i'll say this it goes
[50:29] from glory to glory
[50:32] amen praise god it really has it really
[50:34] has
[50:35] uh i think in the days before you know
[50:37] naomi and karen came and then the you
[50:39] know amen and hua
[50:40] it's really going from glory to glory by
[50:42] god's grace it really is
[50:44] god would send us different ones and
[50:46] it's just wonderful
[50:47] uh it's just living with the beloved
[50:49] right it's fellowshipping with
[50:51] jesus's beloved there's nothing greater
[50:53] than that praise god
[50:54] we saw that this morning so life being a
[50:57] vapor
[50:58] those who do god's will in other words
[51:01] those who are diligent
[51:02] those who crucify the lusts of their
[51:04] flesh they are rewarded with eternal
[51:07] life
[51:07] and then responsibilities in the next
[51:09] life
[51:11] because the world will pass away thank
[51:14] god
[51:15] amen all the corruption in washington dc
[51:17] is going to pass away
[51:19] all the corruption in silicon valley is
[51:21] gonna pass away thank god amen
[51:24] right all the corruption of these human
[51:26] traffickers and these
[51:27] prostitution rings and all this
[51:29] corruption is gonna pass away thank god
[51:31] but the word of god will abide amen
[51:34] hallelujah
[51:36] it's going to abide because it is it's
[51:38] eternal
[51:39] it's immutable it's unchangeable the
[51:41] word of god so when we know we're doing
[51:43] the will of god
[51:44] it gives us that foretaste and that
[51:45] assurance that we will
[51:47] we will never have an ending as well
[51:49] praise god we'll be a part of the
[51:51] unending kingdom just by doing
[51:55] god's will notice it didn't say thinking
[51:58] god's will although we want to think
[51:59] about god's will
[52:00] we've got to do god's will right not
[52:03] not just by hearing god's will that's
[52:05] good it's good to hear god's will
[52:07] but we have to do god's will praise god
[52:10] we got to obey the word of god
[52:11] it's more than hearing it more than
[52:13] thinking about it it's even more than
[52:15] speaking it
[52:15] it's living it praise god amen it's
[52:18] manifesting god's
[52:19] glory it's obeying the voice of god
[52:24] so that's the first reward eternal life
[52:27] the second reward is joining
[52:30] and fellowshipping with god's eternal
[52:33] family praise god
[52:34] uh hold up mark 3 33 this is just a
[52:38] glorious
[52:39] what a promise what what what a
[52:42] perspective jesus christ gives to these
[52:44] people
[52:47] how many know some families that are
[52:48] really tight-knit and it's like well you
[52:50] just
[52:50] they only fellowship with their family i
[52:52] know a couple families like that day
[52:55] if you're not in their family you don't
[52:56] get invited you know
[52:58] and i guess you know there's some
[52:59] understanding for that but i'm just
[53:01] talking about close-knit families
[53:04] and i guess they can have their
[53:05] favorites right they can they're allowed
[53:06] to have their favorites
[53:08] but uh think think about this
[53:11] you know families are such a critical
[53:13] aspect i'm talking about your natural
[53:14] family
[53:15] but here jesus is preaching and gets
[53:18] interrupted by his natural family
[53:22] and just no and we know his reaction
[53:24] let's go to mark 3
[53:26] 33. and he answered them actually
[53:29] go to verse 32 can we do that one too uh
[53:32] a little background and the multitude
[53:34] said about him and they said behold thy
[53:35] mother and thy brethren
[53:37] without seek for thee uh we love this we
[53:40] love this
[53:41] scripture for the catholics right did
[53:42] jesus ever exalt mary above
[53:44] anybody else no he didn't right verse 33
[53:48] now
[53:49] he says uh and he answered
[53:53] them saying who is my mother or my
[53:55] brethren 34
[53:57] and he looked round about on them which
[53:59] set about and said behold
[54:01] my mother and my brethren next verse
[54:05] for whosoever shall do right
[54:09] do the will of god the same as my
[54:11] brother and my sister
[54:13] and my mother amen what a response
[54:18] and this this is why you and i we leave
[54:20] our family you know some of our natural
[54:22] family behind if they're not believers
[54:23] that's why we leave them behind and we
[54:25] come to god's family right here
[54:27] amen praise god because this is jesus's
[54:30] real family
[54:31] and he i like how he doesn't even
[54:32] hesitate he said behold which means
[54:35] look behold this is my real family
[54:38] those who come to hear the word of god
[54:40] that's the real family of god amen
[54:43] i love that so see the first thing is
[54:46] eternal life
[54:47] second thing you have fellowship with
[54:49] the true family of god
[54:51] amen tremendous blessing
[54:54] so your spiritual family is in fact your
[54:56] real family
[54:59] naomi your dad this week uh he saw that
[55:02] picture of malachi and i and my son
[55:04] zion and he's like he said do i have
[55:06] permission to make that my profile
[55:08] picture on whatsapp
[55:10] and i just realized it now he's family
[55:14] right by the blood of jesus and so his
[55:17] his profile picture is malachi zion and
[55:19] i
[55:21] i thought what a what a good example of
[55:23] just
[55:24] he could have any of his natural family
[55:26] i mean he probably has before right but
[55:28] he wanted he wanted to be i associated
[55:30] with his spiritual
[55:31] family hey man i think i think that's so
[55:34] awesome don't you think that
[55:36] i was so touched by that i was so
[55:37] tickled by that that really made me
[55:38] happy
[55:40] that that he can see now he's an older
[55:42] wiser man right
[55:44] very wise man experienced decades and
[55:47] decades of serving christ
[55:48] way longer than i've been alive he's
[55:50] been serving christ and yet look at the
[55:52] wisdom that he can recognize
[55:53] my spiritual family is my real family
[55:57] that's what i want to grow into that too
[55:58] don't you i thought that was such a
[56:01] wonderful blessing there so see
[56:05] interrupted by natural family jesus says
[56:08] hold on
[56:09] i want you to recognize who my real
[56:10] family is first
[56:12] those that hear the word of god that's
[56:15] my true family
[56:17] hallelujah and remember not just here
[56:20] but do
[56:20] doing god's will makes you part of god's
[56:23] forever family
[56:25] amen it's forever family praise god
[56:28] eternal family amen
[56:30] now go with me if you would uh matthew
[56:32] 10 33
[56:33] let's read this matthew 10 33 i know
[56:36] some of this is
[56:37] familiar but it's just good to see how
[56:39] it connects to the will of god
[56:45] yes it's god's will to dress modestly
[56:46] right it's god's will not to
[56:48] destroy our bodies with smoking and
[56:49] drinking and and and drunkenness and
[56:52] and whoremongering and all these things
[56:54] but that actually because you separate
[56:55] that it actually brings you into your
[56:57] real family
[56:58] praise god
[57:02] so see natural family ships or
[57:04] relationships rather are extremely
[57:06] important as we said
[57:07] but really the spiritual ones are your
[57:10] true
[57:10] family now let's look at matthew 10 33
[57:14] to 38 but whosoever shall deny me before
[57:18] men him will i
[57:19] also deny before my father which is in
[57:22] heaven
[57:23] think not that i am come to send peace
[57:25] on the earth
[57:27] i came not to send peace but a sword let
[57:29] me stop right there
[57:31] right most of us think of jesus and
[57:33] peace and happiness enjoying all these
[57:35] things
[57:35] but a lot of that is for you and your
[57:37] soul
[57:39] right in fact did how much peace did
[57:41] paul have in his life after he became a
[57:42] christian
[57:43] hardly any hunted down remember those
[57:46] men put curses on they put a bounty on
[57:48] paul's head
[57:49] he's constantly running from place to
[57:51] place yet the bible says jesus says i
[57:54] don't come to bring peace
[57:56] i come to bring a sword praise god but
[57:59] yet if we receive his spirit
[58:00] we have peace inside of our being amen
[58:04] so it's kind of like we get the peace
[58:05] inside but then it's war
[58:07] outside praise god
[58:10] you get the peace on the inside but then
[58:12] it's battle after battle
[58:14] seems like every side amen amen brother
[58:16] amen
[58:17] sometimes we have battles on every side
[58:19] family work and then
[58:20] you know there's trials at church
[58:22] sometimes and there's sometimes just
[58:24] it feels like there's trials on every
[58:26] side but that doesn't take away the
[58:28] peace of god in our hearts
[58:30] at least it shouldn't praise god and if
[58:32] we backslide a little bit then god will
[58:33] restore our minds praise god
[58:35] because it's a matter of daily renewing
[58:38] our minds
[58:38] every single day he said i don't
[58:42] bring peace but a sword for i'm coming
[58:44] to set a man at variance against his
[58:46] father and the daughter against her
[58:48] mother and the daughter-in-law
[58:50] against her mother-in-law and a man's
[58:52] foes
[58:53] shall be they of his own household
[58:57] all right look at that so your enemies
[58:59] are those in your own house how many can
[59:02] say amen to that
[59:03] i've seen it you know with like i said
[59:05] with my mother and father and different
[59:06] ones
[59:07] uh siblings at times they they uh fight
[59:10] against the true word of god
[59:11] now it's really gotten better over the
[59:12] years it really has got a lot sweeter
[59:14] over the years
[59:15] uh but at first it was such a a battle
[59:18] between good and evil i'll say it like
[59:21] that good and evil
[59:22] he that loveth father or mother more
[59:24] than me is not worthy of me
[59:26] and he that loveth son or daughter more
[59:28] than me is not worthy of me
[59:30] and he that taketh not his cross and
[59:33] followeth after me is not worthy of me
[59:35] there's the suffering right
[59:37] there's the suffering there's the
[59:38] service there's the submission
[59:40] a cross the bear what's your cross to
[59:42] bear tonight
[59:45] praise god for many of us it's our
[59:47] family how can i get
[59:49] god how can i get my family to be saved
[59:52] for some of us it's a ministry song
[59:54] surprise amen song service after song
[59:56] service for me
[59:57] sermon after sermon after sermon it's a
[1:00:00] it's a daily sacrifice for the mothers
[1:00:02] it's serving the children
[1:00:03] meal after meal after meal right they
[1:00:05] just keep eating
[1:00:06] when are they going to stop they're
[1:00:08] never going to stop
[1:00:09] there's hardly any breaks right but it's
[1:00:11] this constant uh
[1:00:13] burden that you carry to do the will of
[1:00:15] god
[1:00:17] and many times your foes are of those of
[1:00:19] your own household
[1:00:21] so see it all comes down to love if you
[1:00:23] love god you'll take up your cross and
[1:00:25] follow jesus amen if you love jesus then
[1:00:29] you'll say well that's
[1:00:30] if he took a cross i can take a cross
[1:00:31] because i know my cross won't come
[1:00:33] won't pale in comparison to the cross he
[1:00:35] bore hallelujah
[1:00:38] if he had a cross if that was god's will
[1:00:39] for him to take a cross then lord
[1:00:41] help me gladly to take your cross for me
[1:00:44] what what do i need to die to what what
[1:00:47] is the what is the selfishness that i
[1:00:49] need to die to what do i need to crucify
[1:00:51] what
[1:00:52] of my my desires or my my passions are
[1:00:55] my uh my goals or dreams what do i need
[1:00:57] to crucify
[1:00:58] and god help me to take up that cross
[1:01:00] and follow you
[1:01:01] praise god amen hallelujah
[1:01:08] now here's another benefit as part of
[1:01:11] god's family mark 10 29 and 30.
[1:01:14] remember peter is saying you know he
[1:01:17] talked about the rich young ruler
[1:01:18] the rich young ruler uh leaves and and
[1:01:22] leaves jesus and peter says who then can
[1:01:24] be saved he said with god all things are
[1:01:26] possible
[1:01:27] and then peter says we've left all what
[1:01:29] about us verse 29
[1:01:32] and jesus answered and said verily i say
[1:01:34] unto you there's no man
[1:01:35] that have left house or brethren or
[1:01:37] sisters or father or mother
[1:01:39] or wife or children or lands for my sake

[1:05:30] she's just smiling they probably don't
[1:05:33] get many visitors you know
[1:05:34] and they're the old lifestyle right
[1:05:36] where they're not like all like we're
[1:05:37] like this all the time
[1:05:40] you know it's just there's so much
[1:05:40] pressure right but they're just uh laid
[1:05:42] back
[1:05:44] no pressure happy to wash my dirty
[1:05:47] and then and all my other dirty clothes
[1:05:49] you know you can imagine all the dirty
[1:05:51] you know all the smells and all the dirt
[1:05:53] and everything like that you know
[1:05:54] just happy to wash for the kingdom of
[1:05:56] god and the next morning they're up
[1:05:57] there hanging on the clothes line and
[1:05:59] it's 95 degrees there and
[1:06:01] everything's sparkly white clean and
[1:06:02] everything i thought my
[1:06:04] i've got another mother i got my mom my
[1:06:07] mother-in-law and i got another mom here
[1:06:09] by god's grace
[1:06:10] that's what jesus said jesus said just
[1:06:13] like that just take in their family like
[1:06:15] that
[1:06:15] and treat you like royalty
[1:06:18] and this is what jesus says that's the
[1:06:20] true family of god i don't know about
[1:06:21] you but that's an awesome family right
[1:06:22] there
[1:06:23] that's a pretty uh trustworthy family
[1:06:25] right
[1:06:26] to be adopted in a family like that so
[1:06:29] think of the gains many times
[1:06:31] as we think about the losses god help us
[1:06:33] to get our minds on the gains amen
[1:06:36] all the gains that we're going to
[1:06:37] receive now praise god
[1:06:42] may god help us to see those gains
[1:06:46] now st nobody i remember one time there
[1:06:48] was a friend we had named jimmy
[1:06:50] he was he and i actually graduated
[1:06:51] together we played uh
[1:06:53] he didn't play football so he played
[1:06:54] track we ran track together won a state
[1:06:56] championship and everything like that
[1:06:57] right after i became a preacher um
[1:07:01] i shared the message with him he got
[1:07:02] saved and baptized
[1:07:04] and i remember cam warren i think it was
[1:07:05] cam cam said now you be careful you just
[1:07:07] got
[1:07:07] he was all excited about you know the
[1:07:09] water baptism in the godhead
[1:07:11] and cam warned him i said cam said you
[1:07:14] be careful the next few days satan's
[1:07:15] going to try to
[1:07:16] take this away from you and he was just
[1:07:19] like okay
[1:07:20] okay nice guy i mean i'm still in
[1:07:21] contact with him jimmy
[1:07:24] and the very next day he got into a car
[1:07:26] accident he slid off the
[1:07:28] road and totaled his car now he was okay
[1:07:31] but when cam and simon tried to contact
[1:07:33] him after that he said i don't want
[1:07:34] nothing to do with you guys anymore
[1:07:36] so he saw this accident as god saying
[1:07:39] you did the wrong thing rather than us
[1:07:42] giving him the warning he should have
[1:07:43] saw it the way we told him that satan's
[1:07:45] going to try to
[1:07:46] scare you away from us satan's going to
[1:07:48] try to he was upset
[1:07:50] he's upset that a soul got baptized in
[1:07:52] the right way
[1:07:54] right and so instead of recognizing his
[1:07:56] real family he went back
[1:07:58] to the other family and that's so sad
[1:08:01] because it was even warned a fourth time
[1:08:04] now be careful satan's going to try to
[1:08:05] throw you off of this and try to uh get
[1:08:08] you off of the narrow way
[1:08:12] but i was grateful he was there and i
[1:08:14] got ordained because i got the picture
[1:08:15] in my office he was there when i got
[1:08:16] ordained down in lima
[1:08:19] but see he uh he saw the he
[1:08:22] he didn't think it was worthy to come
[1:08:24] over to this side he didn't see the the
[1:08:26] blessings
[1:08:27] that we see you know the bible says when
[1:08:30] satan attacks you like that you're
[1:08:31] supposed to give god glory praise god
[1:08:33] you're supposed to rejoice when you go
[1:08:35] through trials right
[1:08:36] not shirk away from the truth but
[1:08:38] rejoice because i'm getting
[1:08:40] i'm getting persecuted or i'm suffering
[1:08:42] because i made the right choice
[1:08:45] but it takes a spiritual mind to accept
[1:08:47] that praise god
[1:08:48] it takes a spiritual mind to do it
[1:08:52] so church now we have a hundredfold now
[1:08:54] in this time
[1:08:55] houses brothers and sisters mothers
[1:08:58] children
[1:08:59] lands with persecutions and in the world

[1:12:28] and shall teach men so he shall be
[1:12:30] called the least
[1:12:31] in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever
[1:12:33] shall do and teach them the same
[1:12:34] shall be called great in the kingdom of
[1:12:37] heaven
[1:12:38] so there's going to be like in the
[1:12:39] millennium right we know there's going

[1:12:55] people that are called great
[1:12:57] right this this beloved people this
[1:12:59] beloved dearly beloved group
[1:13:02] they're going to have the label as great
[1:13:04] people
[1:13:05] because they taught the word they knew
[1:13:07] the word they taught the word
[1:13:09] and they helped others to obey it as
[1:13:11] well hey man
[1:13:13] isn't that glorious
[1:13:17] they should be called great in the
[1:13:18] kingdom of heaven i don't want to be
[1:13:20] called least in the kingdom of heaven
[1:13:22] i want to be called great in the kingdom
[1:13:24] of heaven and that to get that it's so
[1:13:26] simple
[1:13:27] keep the commandments and teach others
[1:13:29] to do the same
[1:13:32] hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:13:35] now as you wait upon god's will you get
[1:13:38] three more rewards
[1:13:40] the first one you eventually get the
[1:13:42] answer you actually receive the promise
[1:13:44] the bible said
[1:13:45] hebrews 10 35 to 38 cast not away
[1:13:48] therefore your confidence
[1:13:50] which hath great recompense of reward
[1:13:52] for you have need a patience
[1:13:54] that after you've done the will of god
[1:13:57] you might receive the promise amen so
[1:14:00] the first reward is
[1:14:02] sometime after you do god's will you'll
[1:14:04] receive the promise
[1:14:07] scripture says for yet a little while
[1:14:09] and he that
[1:14:10] shall come will come and will not tarry
[1:14:13] he says now the just shall live by faith
[1:14:15] if any man draw back
[1:14:16] my soul shall have no pleasure in him
[1:14:21] oh see there's a great temptation many
[1:14:23] times for people to draw back and say
[1:14:24] well i'm not going to
[1:14:25] pray anymore i'm not going to trust in
[1:14:27] god anymore it hasn't happened yet
[1:14:29] how do i know god heard my prayer but
[1:14:32] that's not what faith does
[1:14:33] faith takes a hold of it and knows that
[1:14:35] after i've done the will of god
[1:14:37] then i receive the promise praise god
[1:14:42] so that's a great benefit after you do
[1:14:45] god's will
[1:14:46] you actually receive the promise amen
[1:14:49] he promises it to you whether it's
[1:14:51] bodily healing right
[1:14:53] knowledge of who you're going to marry
[1:14:54] or financial need
[1:14:56] right whatever the need is just hang on
[1:14:58] to god and eventually it will come
[1:15:00] praise god
[1:15:01] my sister told a testimony yesterday my
[1:15:03] mom we were of course really poor
[1:15:05] because my parents were divorced and my
[1:15:06] mom
[1:15:06] she just did little side jobs but my mom
[1:15:09] remembers when
[1:15:10] the elect the uh electric company came
[1:15:12] to my mom's house and
[1:15:13] i don't know if i was at college by that
[1:15:15] time or not i probably was at college by
[1:15:16] that time
[1:15:18] and uh the electric company said uh mrs
[1:15:21] smith
[1:15:21] we're gonna shut off your uh electric if
[1:15:24] we don't have the payment in like a week
[1:15:26] and uh betsy testified she was crying in
[1:15:29] tears and she said
[1:15:31] she said betsy stay down here downstairs
[1:15:34] i'm gonna go up and pray
[1:15:37] and then uh my my sister said she heard
[1:15:39] my mom just shouting and praying up in
[1:15:41] the room
[1:15:42] uh and when she come down she had tears
[1:15:44] in her eyes and then betsy said she was
[1:15:46] there
[1:15:46] when somebody came and just brought a
[1:15:48] check over
[1:15:49] uh i forget which stranger it was but
[1:15:51] some some stranger brought over a check
[1:15:54] and uh betsy said she received it and
[1:15:55] that that's the amount that they needed
[1:15:57] to keep the electric on
[1:15:59] so see she did the will of god you make
[1:16:01] your request known unto god
[1:16:03] and god hears the prayer amen i wasn't
[1:16:06] there for that i wish i would have been
[1:16:07] there for that one
[1:16:08] but that was a great testimony
[1:16:12] see we must do the will of god and then
[1:16:14] wait
[1:16:15] wait for god to work on our behalf
[1:16:20] and then the second reward is renewed
[1:16:22] strength isaiah
[1:16:23] 40 verse 31. this is what we're getting
[1:16:26] right now a lot of strength praise god
[1:16:28] we're waiting for this rapture when is
[1:16:29] this rapture going to come is this when
[1:16:31] is the squeeze going to come right we
[1:16:32] everybody preaches about the rapture
[1:16:33] because we all want to see it
[1:16:34] that's what we're living for praise god
[1:16:37] all right and we have since brother bran
[1:16:38] was here he was preaching about the
[1:16:39] rapture for
[1:16:40] all these years and so we shouldn't get
[1:16:43] weaker we should get stronger praise god
[1:16:46] because the bible says they that wait
[1:16:48] upon the lord shall renew their strength
[1:16:51] they shall mount up with wings as eagles
[1:16:53] they shall run and not be weary
[1:16:55] they shall walk and not faint
[1:16:58] so that's another reward that we should
[1:17:00] have we should be stronger for the
[1:17:01] message
[1:17:02] stronger for the word of god because
[1:17:04] we're waiting and god promises as you
[1:17:06] wait i'll strengthen you praise god
[1:17:10] but it's hasty believers who try to
[1:17:13] force
[1:17:13] their will instead of waiting on god's
[1:17:16] will and they actually grow
[1:17:17] weaker in faith instead of stronger so
[1:17:20] when you and i
[1:17:21] if there's times we try to do it
[1:17:22] ourselves or figure it out right
[1:17:25] or we're ourselves with uh with problems
[1:17:28] right worry instead of worrying
[1:17:30] we need to have faith praise god but
[1:17:32] when we do that we actually get
[1:17:33] weaker when we try to figure out we're
[1:17:35] actually stronger when we cast our cares
[1:17:38] upon the lord for he cares for us
[1:17:40] amen amen we're actually stronger just
[1:17:42] by coming to the
[1:17:43] house of god worship and sing along with
[1:17:45] brother amen and the saints
[1:17:46] and just praising god and forget about
[1:17:48] it and trust god to take care of it amen
[1:17:51] we're actually stronger just forgetting
[1:17:53] about the things we can't control
[1:17:55] and god will make us stronger in due
[1:17:57] season
[1:17:59] he promised so he promises to strengthen
[1:18:02] your faith
[1:18:03] as you wait upon his time in season
[1:18:08] hallelujah that's the second one so the
[1:18:11] first one is actually you actually gain
[1:18:12] some of these promises you actually see
[1:18:14] them fulfill
[1:18:15] the second one he renews your strength
[1:18:16] as you're waiting after you've done the
[1:18:18] will of god
[1:18:19] and the third one is you understand
[1:18:22] god's will i thought this was just a
[1:18:23] beautiful
[1:18:25] portion of scripture uh pull up
[1:18:27] deuteronomy 4 6. i never seen this
[1:18:29] scripture like this until i was studying
[1:18:30] i think i found it in one of the
[1:18:32] commentary writers
[1:18:40] now look at this this is speaking of of
[1:18:41] course israel but we know it applies
[1:18:43] also to the the gentiles
[1:18:45] keep therefore and do them the
[1:18:47] commandments for this
[1:18:48] the commandments is your wisdom and your
[1:18:51] understanding in the sight of the
[1:18:53] nations
[1:18:55] right so when you keep god's commands
[1:18:59] when you
[1:18:59] give god's when you do god's will
[1:19:03] the bible says the commandments are your
[1:19:05] wisdom and understanding and all the
[1:19:07] nations look at you
[1:19:08] and they see something different praise
[1:19:10] god oh man i think about
[1:19:12] all your family members they see
[1:19:13] something different about your life
[1:19:14] don't they
[1:19:16] see when you do god's will it instantly
[1:19:19] separates you as
[1:19:20] a different kind of a person you're
[1:19:23] a dif a different kingdom right
[1:19:24] different family or something different
[1:19:26] now they might think we're like
[1:19:27] different like this
[1:19:29] but we're not we're different because we
[1:19:31] have the wisdom of god amen we have the
[1:19:33] understanding of god
[1:19:35] the same thing was true for israel god's
[1:19:37] will
[1:19:38] made them different and made them stick
[1:19:40] out they were a peculiar people
[1:19:42] and so is the bride of christ a peculiar
[1:19:44] woman praise god
[1:19:45] she's a special church there's not many
[1:19:47] like her and i'm glad to be a part of it
[1:19:49] amen
[1:19:50] hallelujah see god's will
[1:19:54] is your wisdom and you understand it's
[1:19:56] your understanding
[1:19:57] now you understand the world right now
[1:19:59] we understand the mother harlot
[1:20:01] some people are cheering some people are
[1:20:03] cheering in their churches
[1:20:04] that the pope said that and we're like
[1:20:06] oh god have mercy
[1:20:07] save us praise god we want the truth and
[1:20:10] we we want to be your bride and we want
[1:20:11] to get out of here right we don't want
[1:20:12] to be a part of this
[1:20:14] trash and this uh this sin and
[1:20:16] debauchery we don't want to be a part of
[1:20:18] that
[1:20:19] so see some people celebrate that uh or
[1:20:22] or
[1:20:22] cheer for that but we are uh we're
[1:20:25] earnestly condemning for the faith that
[1:20:26] was once delivered to the saints
[1:20:28] amen hallelujah and but it shows that we
[1:20:33] have the understanding
[1:20:34] right we have the understanding to do
[1:20:37] god's will
[1:20:39] and your life makes sense as you read
[1:20:41] god's word right your life
[1:20:43] makes sense you it all falls into place
[1:20:46] you know exactly what you're doing as a
[1:20:48] christian
[1:20:49] go to ephesians 5 here let's read this
[1:20:51] ephesians 5 14.
[1:20:56] and let me say like this before we read
[1:20:57] it you and i should know
[1:20:59] we should all we should know almost
[1:21:01] every step that we take
[1:21:03] right this scripture proves it we'll
[1:21:06] read it a little bit
[1:21:08] we shouldn't just make guesses many
[1:21:09] times and what we're doing we should
[1:21:11] wait upon god's will
[1:21:13] and then when it's known then we make a
[1:21:15] step into god's perfect will
[1:21:18] okay so wherefore he saith awake thou
[1:21:20] that sleepless and arise from the dead
[1:21:21] and christ shall give thee light next
[1:21:22] one
[1:21:23] now think of the foolish versions here
[1:21:25] see then that you walk circumspectly
[1:21:28] not as fools but why stop right there
[1:21:30] that word circumspectly means
[1:21:32] exactly so when you are awakened from
[1:21:35] the darkness of sin
[1:21:37] and now your eyes are open and now the
[1:21:39] light of jesus christ is shining
[1:21:41] and you're a wise virgin christian and
[1:21:42] you're born again you walk
[1:21:44] exactly in the perfect will of god
[1:21:48] praise god you're not going to walk
[1:21:49] purposely like into a wrong relationship
[1:21:52] right
[1:21:52] you're not going to walk purposely in
[1:21:54] the wrong job or the wrong situation
[1:21:57] you're not going to purposely walk in
[1:21:58] there because the light is on
[1:22:00] praise god god's light is shining and
[1:22:02] you can you can see darkness you can
[1:22:04] you have a sense of darkness you have a
[1:22:06] sense of evil so you walk precisely
[1:22:08] you know exactly where god wants you to
[1:22:10] go hey man
[1:22:15] i'll try to finish my i really didn't
[1:22:18] think i did
[1:22:18] okay i thought i'd get done more than
[1:22:20] that praise the lord
[1:22:22] i wanted to finish tight so
[1:22:26] see your life makes sense so when the
[1:22:28] light of god is on
[1:22:30] we make the decisions and the choices
[1:22:32] that we know are god's will and we stay
[1:22:35] in god's perfect will now go to john
[1:22:38] 7 16 and 17. this the will of god is a
[1:22:41] huge
[1:22:42] topic i just had to condense it because
[1:22:44] it's just such a major
[1:22:46] huge topic it's all because it's all
[1:22:47] connected with obedience
[1:22:49] uh john 7 16 and 17.
[1:22:55] i'm almost done here jesus answered them
[1:22:58] and said my doctrine is not mine
[1:23:00] but his that set me if i love this if
[1:23:02] any man
[1:23:03] do his will he shall know the doctrine
[1:23:07] whether it be of god or whether i speak
[1:23:10] of myself
[1:23:13] in other words the only way you'll know
[1:23:15] the doctrine is right is if you
[1:23:17] experience it
[1:23:18] right how do you know christianity is
[1:23:20] right because i've experienced it
[1:23:23] that's how you know you have to do it
[1:23:25] right that's why we tell people just
[1:23:26] just try it right try it give jesus a
[1:23:30] chance praise god give him a chance
[1:23:32] because the only way to know what the
[1:23:33] right teaching is is to experience
[1:23:36] doing god's will and that as soon as you
[1:23:38] do god's will god blesses you amen
[1:23:41] amen that's what jesus says he said you
[1:23:44] have to do my will
[1:23:46] then you know whether the teaching's
[1:23:47] right or not
[1:23:49] see because you grow in wisdom and
[1:23:51] understanding he blesses you
[1:23:53] for obedience and then you'll know the
[1:23:56] right thing
[1:23:58] praise god so see you'll know and
[1:24:00] understand true doctrine because of the
[1:24:02] spirit's presence
[1:24:03] in your soul praise god now
[1:24:07] let me close with this let me close with
[1:24:08] here's the consequences
[1:24:10] for rejecting the revelation of god's
[1:24:12] will so those are the blessings i hope
[1:24:14] that was a blessing to you praise god
[1:24:15] hope i didn't build it up too much and i
[1:24:16] hope i didn't disappoint you on that but
[1:24:18] i thought that was beautiful
[1:24:20] my look at all those blessings so the
[1:24:23] consequence is
[1:24:24] the worst one is being lost to hell
[1:24:26] eternally separated from god
[1:24:31] like jesus taught in matthew 7
[1:24:34] with the false prophets he said not
[1:24:36] every one that says unto me lord lord
[1:24:38] shall enter the kingdom of heaven
[1:24:40] but he that doeth the will of god of my
[1:24:42] father which is in heaven
[1:24:45] so to be saved you have to do the will
[1:24:47] of god
[1:24:48] right which we know is repentance like
[1:24:50] the thief on the cross he repented
[1:24:52] right now there is that question with
[1:24:54] the foolish version can they
[1:24:56] because they seem surprised right on the
[1:24:57] on the day of judgment
[1:24:59] uh and that's a whole other thing it's
[1:25:01] kind of hard to know
[1:25:02] but i i believe god does say that way if
[1:25:04] he's merciful but that's just my opinion
[1:25:06] i could be wrong
[1:25:07] but jesus says he that doeth the will of
[1:25:10] my father which is in heaven
[1:25:13] many will say lord lord have we not
[1:25:14] prophesy thy name and done
[1:25:16] cast out devils and in thy name done
[1:25:19] many wonderful works
[1:25:20] and then i will profess to them i never
[1:25:22] knew you depart from me ye that work
[1:25:23] iniquity
[1:25:24] so it's not enough to do miracles and
[1:25:27] operate spiritual gifts
[1:25:29] god wants simple humble obedience to his
[1:25:31] will
[1:25:32] the known will of god and the
[1:25:33] progressive will of god so look at that
[1:25:36] church they had enough
[1:25:37] these uh workers of iniquity they
[1:25:38] haven't had enough knowledge of the
[1:25:40] known will of god
[1:25:41] to see miracles happen right that enough
[1:25:44] of the
[1:25:45] the known will of god but they denied
[1:25:48] the progressive or future will of god
[1:25:50] that was leading them past
[1:25:52] gifts right because you their gifts are
[1:25:54] great
[1:25:55] right but you got to be born again the
[1:25:56] giver's got to be in you praise god
[1:25:59] the one who gave the gifts has got to be
[1:26:00] living inside of you praise god
[1:26:03] hallelujah see it's not enough
[1:26:06] to just know the or do the known will
[1:26:08] with gifts
[1:26:10] we have to do the will of god from our
[1:26:13] souls
[1:26:14] the word of god has to get down into our
[1:26:15] soul
[1:26:17] and that's why these false prophets
[1:26:19] jesus says are like wolves because they
[1:26:21] know god's known will
[1:26:22] but they blatantly re refuse
[1:26:25] the future will of god and of course you
[1:26:28] know some of the known will of god too
[1:26:33] the second consequence is unfulfilled
[1:26:35] potential how many times have we seen
[1:26:36] that
[1:26:37] people have they have so much potential
[1:26:39] like especially we see a lot with
[1:26:40] preachers
[1:26:41] some of the some of the wonderful gifted
[1:26:43] preachers but then they sell out
[1:26:45] uh the message for some worldly thing
[1:26:47] right and
[1:26:48] oh what if they just could have kept
[1:26:50] going what could god have done with a
[1:26:52] servant of god like that
[1:26:54] unfulfilled potential remember the bible
[1:26:57] says
[1:26:58] many will be saved but will have no
[1:27:00] reward
[1:27:01] right this must be foolish virgin
[1:27:03] they're saved but they lose the reward
[1:27:07] if they would have just diligently and
[1:27:08] faithfully obey the will of god
[1:27:11] let's read that real quick first
[1:27:12] corinthians i think it's first
[1:27:13] corinthians three
[1:27:21] and if it's chapter two forgive me but i
[1:27:22] think it's chapter three
[1:27:33] all right
[1:27:38] okay yeah uh 3 14 if any man's work
[1:27:42] abide which he hath built there upon he
[1:27:44] shall receive a reward
[1:27:45] if any man's work shall be burned he
[1:27:47] shall suffer lost but he himself shall
[1:27:49] be saved
[1:27:50] yet so as by fire
[1:27:53] all right so everybody can see that by
[1:27:56] god's grace there's going to be some
[1:27:57] people their only reward and brother bam
[1:27:58] says in the church age book
[1:28:00] their only reward is eternal life they
[1:28:02] have no other inheritance
[1:28:04] no other positions no other
[1:28:07] responsibilities
[1:28:08] all they inherit is eternal life because
[1:28:10] they forsook
[1:28:11] their potential that's why we tell you
[1:28:14] know that our children and brother amen
[1:28:15] invest in your
[1:28:16] talents you know invest in your music
[1:28:18] like loris
[1:28:19] told malachi he said he had good vice he
[1:28:22] said
[1:28:23] don't ever be satisfied with your piano
[1:28:25] playing he said don't ever think you've
[1:28:27] arrived malachi
[1:28:28] so i'm gonna echo that for you tonight
[1:28:29] buddy same thing for me don't ever feel
[1:28:31] comfortable as a preacher
[1:28:32] keep pressing into the things of god uh
[1:28:35] realize how little you are realize how
[1:28:37] enough
[1:28:37] we have nothing and we need more of god
[1:28:39] amen
[1:28:41] so we can reach our potential of
[1:28:43] yielding to god and then god can
[1:28:45] use us in in greater ways
[1:28:49] so unfulfilled potential is another
[1:28:51] consequence for rejecting the revelation
[1:28:53] of god's will
[1:28:58] a third one is in inward confusion
[1:29:01] sadness sorrow or grief
[1:29:04] uh let's go to mark 10 17.
[1:29:13] this is the rich young ruler mark 10
[1:29:17] 17-25
[1:29:20] is this helpful tonight i hope
[1:29:21] somebody's being blessed tonight by
[1:29:22] god's grace
[1:29:24] hope it's a blessing praise god
[1:29:27] i want to read 22 just for time's sake i
[1:29:29] know i know i said i'm going to close
[1:29:30] pretty soon
[1:29:31] verse 22 mark 10 22 and he was sad at
[1:29:34] that saying and he went away grieved for
[1:29:35] he had great
[1:29:36] possessions grieved in the greek means
[1:29:38] confusion
[1:29:40] sadness sorrow and grief
[1:29:43] brother ram said jesus offered him the
[1:29:44] highest office
[1:29:47] in the universe was an apostle right in
[1:29:49] the church
[1:29:51] and yet he turned it down for money
[1:29:54] and he left with a uh an inward
[1:29:57] sadness and confusion and grief because
[1:30:00] he loved his money so much now church
[1:30:02] you and i know
[1:30:02] that doesn't go away you can suppress it
[1:30:05] with
[1:30:06] pleasures right you can suppress it with
[1:30:07] pleasures and drunkenness and
[1:30:09] all kinds you can try to suppress that
[1:30:12] but it'll never go away
[1:30:14] right because that's that conviction
[1:30:16] it's that conscience
[1:30:17] where the person knows i should have
[1:30:19] done that and they'll do everything they
[1:30:21] can to forget about it
[1:30:23] so that's another consequence of
[1:30:25] rejecting god's will
[1:30:26] i'm glad church we can have a conscience
[1:30:28] that's free
[1:30:30] from guilt hallelujah i'm glad that
[1:30:33] man we can go to bed at night and we
[1:30:34] know i don't know what god asked me to
[1:30:36] do
[1:30:37] i've done everything he asked me to do i
[1:30:39] try to do it the best i can
[1:30:41] i'm giving him everything i got praise
[1:30:43] god i haven't turned down one thing
[1:30:44] i may not have uh reach it at the right
[1:30:46] time or accomplish it right away but i'm
[1:30:48] pressing toward it
[1:30:51] hallelujah oh what an assurance church
[1:30:54] we can have in our souls
[1:30:55] we don't have to sleep with grief right
[1:30:57] we have to go to bed with sadness and
[1:30:58] confusion in our lives
[1:31:00] we can go to bed rejoicing
[1:31:03] saying thank god i've done everything i
[1:31:05] know how to do to do god's will
[1:31:08] but not this fella the bible said he
[1:31:10] walked away grieved and yet the bible
[1:31:11] said jesus loved him
[1:31:13] jesus loved him enough to call him to be
[1:31:15] an apostle
[1:31:16] and he walked away so a third
[1:31:18] consequence is a sadness
[1:31:20] of mind and soul confusion sorrow
[1:31:23] grief
[1:31:29] praise god
[1:31:34] i think i'll end with just a few more
[1:31:35] thoughts here um matthew 7
[1:31:38] 8 here's jesus's guarantee what a
[1:31:42] beautiful
[1:31:42] this is an infallible guarantee i think
[1:31:45] aldi does a double guarantee money back
[1:31:47] if you're not satisfied
[1:31:49] right you get food replaced and you get
[1:31:51] your money back
[1:31:53] jesus goes way beyond a live stream just
[1:31:55] for a moment here
