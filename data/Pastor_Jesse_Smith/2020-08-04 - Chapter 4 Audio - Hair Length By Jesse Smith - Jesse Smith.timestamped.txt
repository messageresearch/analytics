[0:00] chapter 4 hair length
[0:03] includes footnotes 227
[0:06] through 236 but if a woman have long
[0:11] hair it is a glory to her
[0:13] for her hair is given her for a covering
[0:16] first corinthians 11 verse 15
[0:20] just like men and women having separate
[0:22] garments the bible teaches that men and
[0:24] women should also have separate
[0:26] distinct hair lengths scripture teaches
[0:28] that god requires women to keep their
[0:30] hair
[0:31] uncut and as long as genetically
[0:34] possible
[0:34] for their entire lives god asks men to
[0:37] keep their hair cut short
[0:40] when women obey the word of god and keep
[0:42] their hair uncut
[0:43] it is an honor to their husbands and to
[0:46] christ
[0:47] if men rebel against god and grow their
[0:49] hair out like a woman
[0:51] they are considered shameful in the eyes
[0:53] of god
[0:56] new testament teaching five new
[0:58] testament texts
[1:00] support men and women having separate
[1:02] distinct hair lengths
[1:04] first corinthians 11 verses 1 to 16
[1:07] john 11 verses 1 and 2
[1:10] john 12 verses 1 and 8 luke 7
[1:14] verses 36 to 50 and revelation 9
[1:18] verse 8. furthermore you cannot find a
[1:22] text in scripture where god asks
[1:24] any godly woman whether in the old or
[1:26] new testaments
[1:27] to cut or trim her hair in any way
[1:31] a question arises whether a woman can
[1:33] trim her split ends
[1:35] the bible-based answer is no women must
[1:38] not even trim their split ends
[1:40] contrary to the false idea that trimming
[1:42] split ends
[1:44] makes hair healthier healthy hair comes
[1:46] from a healthy diet
[1:47] and daily care scissors must not come
[1:50] upon
[1:50] any part of the hair of a faithful
[1:53] obedient christian woman
[1:58] the main text on hair length the main
[2:01] new testament text
[2:03] for teaching on hair length is first
[2:04] corinthians 11
[2:06] verses 1 1-16 the truth about hair
[2:09] length has been lying in the scripture
[2:11] for nearly 2 000 years
[2:13] churches may label this text as cultural
[2:16] which
[2:16] implies that they do not have to obey
[2:18] its commands
[2:19] but they are wrong for four reasons
[2:22] first
[2:22] paul never said this text was for the
[2:24] corinthians only
[2:26] in fact verse 16 says this custom was
[2:28] for
[2:29] all the churches of god not just one
[2:33] second the apostle never labeled hair
[2:35] length as an area of liberty
[2:37] as he did for observing holy days eating
[2:40] meat
[2:40] and drinking wine third hair length is
[2:44] directly associated with god's design
[2:46] for male headship
[2:47] as verse 3 details paul says headship is
[2:51] a universal principle
[2:52] that pertains to every man not just
[2:55] corinthian men
[2:57] fourth the unchanging pattern for hair
[2:59] length that god has laid out
[3:01] through the entire canon of scripture is
[3:04] vindication that all
[3:05] christians should honor paul's teaching
[3:09] in verses 1 and 2 paul urged the
[3:11] corinthians to continue to follow his
[3:13] ordinances because he was taught the
[3:16] gospel by christ himself
[3:18] as validated in galatians 1 verses 11
[3:21] and 12
[3:22] but i certify you brethren that the
[3:25] gospel which was preached of me is not
[3:27] after man
[3:28] for i neither received it of man neither
[3:31] was i taught it
[3:32] but by the revelation of jesus christ
[3:36] verse 3 describes the god-ordained
[3:38] headship
[3:39] for the entire universe man is head over
[3:42] the woman
[3:43] christ is head over man and god the
[3:46] eternal invisible spirit
[3:48] is head over christ this headship or
[3:51] order of leadership
[3:52] is important because it is reflected in
[3:54] hair length according to verses 4
[3:56] through 6.
[3:58] hair length is a god-ordained symbol of
[4:00] authority
[4:01] or leadership verse 4 teaches that a man
[4:04] dishonors christ
[4:06] if he covers his head by letting his
[4:08] hair grow long
[4:09] as verse 14 says it is a shame for a man
[4:12] to have long hair
[4:14] then in verse 5 paul teaches that a
[4:16] woman dishonors her husband
[4:18] if she prays or prophesies with an
[4:20] uncovered head
[4:22] an uncovered head is a head that has cut
[4:25] or trimmed hair upon it
[4:27] since verse 15 says a woman's long uncut
[4:30] hair
[4:30] is given her for a covering
[4:33] because it is a shame for a woman to be
[4:36] shorn
[4:37] short hair or shaven all hair cut off
[4:41] let her be covered as verse 6 details
[4:44] please know that the covering of a woman
[4:46] is not a cap or veil
[4:49] as seen worn by women from amish
[4:51] mennonite
[4:52] and other sex a woman's true covering is
[4:56] not
[4:56] a man-made covering but a covering made
[4:59] and designed by god
[5:00] her uncut hair there is no scripture
[5:03] that says
[5:04] a cap or veil is given her for a
[5:06] covering
[5:07] but there is scripture that says her
[5:09] hair is given her for a covering
[5:12] verses 7 through 12 explain why women
[5:15] should have long hair
[5:17] they came out of man in the beginning
[5:20] and were created for the man
[5:22] man was created first and is the
[5:24] god-ordained leader of the family and
[5:26] church
[5:27] long hair on a woman is the sign of her
[5:29] husband's authority over her
[5:31] as this authority is taught throughout
[5:34] the bible
[5:35] in verses 13-16 paul asked the
[5:39] corinthians to judge themselves
[5:41] is it calmly or fit for a woman to pray
[5:44] to god
[5:45] uncovered is it fit for a woman to pray
[5:48] with short hair
[5:49] or a shaved head of course the answer is
[5:52] no
[5:53] it is not fit for a woman to pray to god
[5:55] with cut hair
[5:56] for cut hair is a sign of rebellion
[5:58] against the authority of her husband
[6:01] next paul states that nature itself
[6:04] teaches that long hair
[6:05] on a man is a shame modern science says
[6:09] 40 percent of all men experience
[6:11] baldness
[6:12] so we can again see the infallible truth
[6:14] of the bible
[6:15] that god allows nature to teach us that
[6:17] long uncut hair on a man
[6:20] is a shame nearly half of the men in the
[6:22] world go bald
[6:24] this should let everyone know that god
[6:25] does not want long hair
[6:27] on men verse 15 contains the plain
[6:31] concise truth about the head covering
[6:33] for a woman
[6:35] paul states if a woman has long hair it
[6:38] is a glory to her
[6:39] because her hair was given to her for a
[6:41] covering her long
[6:43] uncut hair is her covering not a cap or
[6:45] veil
[6:46] or any other man-made covering
[6:49] paul ends this portion of scripture in
[6:51] verse 16 by answering the question he
[6:54] asked in verse 13.
[6:56] is it fit for a woman to pray to god
[6:58] uncovered
[6:59] with short hair or a shaved head
[7:02] the apostle says despite some being
[7:04] contentious about this topic of hair
[7:06] length
[7:07] we have no such custom in other words
[7:10] christians paul associated with had no
[7:13] practice
[7:13] of women praying to god with short hair
[7:16] neither did any other of the churches of
[7:18] god
[7:19] the churches of god in the days of paul
[7:22] did not allow women to prophesy or pray
[7:24] to god
[7:25] with short trimmed hair nor men to pray
[7:28] to god with long
[7:30] uncut hair undoubtedly
[7:33] paul taught this doctrine of women
[7:35] having long uncut hair
[7:37] in every church he visited saying
[7:40] for this cause have i sent unto you
[7:42] timotheus
[7:43] who is my beloved son and faithful in
[7:45] the lord
[7:46] who shall bring you into remembrance of
[7:48] my ways which be in christ
[7:51] as i teach everywhere in every church
[7:58] what long hair represents to god based
[8:01] upon the bible word
[8:02] covering a beautiful scripture from the
[8:04] old testament gives us further
[8:06] understanding of what long hair on a
[8:08] woman represents
[8:10] isaiah 30 verse 1 says woe to the
[8:13] rebellious children saith the lord
[8:15] that take counsel but not of me and that
[8:18] cover with the covering but not of my
[8:21] spirit
[8:22] that they may add sin to sin
[8:26] god wants us to know that a natural
[8:27] woman's covering or hair
[8:30] represents the covering of the spiritual
[8:32] woman
[8:33] or church of the lord jesus christ this
[8:36] means that the godly wife and the godly
[8:38] church
[8:38] both have coverings that they must
[8:40] maintain with their consecrated lives
[8:43] figure four explains this in depth
[8:47] figure four natural bride
[8:51] she has a covering which is her uncut
[8:53] hair
[8:54] first corinthians 11 verse 15 her uncut
[8:58] hair is a symbol that she is
[8:59] under the authority or leadership of her
[9:02] head
[9:03] or her husband the application for the
[9:06] spiritual bride is
[9:08] the church is covering is the spirit of
[9:10] god according to isaiah
[9:12] chapter 30 verse 1 which wrote the word
[9:15] of god
[9:16] according to second peter 1 verse 21 the
[9:19] presence of the covering
[9:21] which is the anointing of the holy ghost
[9:23] proves she is
[9:24] under the authority of her ruler christ
[9:26] jesus
[9:27] her husband the natural bride
[9:31] she has untrimmed uncut hair according
[9:33] to first corinthians 11 verses 5
[9:36] and 6. she does not cut off or take away
[9:39] any part of her covering
[9:40] which is her hair the faithful bride
[9:43] submits to every word of her husband
[9:45] according to ephesians 5 verse 24.
[9:49] application for the spiritual bride is
[9:52] the church submits to and lives by
[9:54] every word the holy spirit wrote taking
[9:57] nothing away from the word
[9:59] according to matthew 4 verse 4 and
[10:01] revelation 22
[10:03] verses 18 and 19. this church will not
[10:06] trim
[10:06] off parts of the bible or neglect
[10:09] preaching any
[10:10] truth of god whether society agrees with
[10:12] it or not
[10:14] for the natural bride to cut her hair is
[10:17] to deny
[10:18] god glory in her life and deny her
[10:20] husband honor
[10:22] she does not reject or cut even one hair
[10:24] on her head
[10:25] according to first corinthians 11 verses
[10:28] 5 and 15.
[10:30] the application for the spiritual bride
[10:32] is to reject one word of the bible is to
[10:35] deny
[10:36] christ glory in her life the true church
[10:39] progresses in their walk with god from
[10:41] glory to more glory
[10:43] according to second corinthians 3 verse
[10:46] 18
[10:49] the hair of mary sister of lazarus
[10:52] the second and third texts describe
[10:54] lazarus sister
[10:56] mary who anointed jesus with ointment
[10:59] in the gospel of john now a certain man
[11:02] was sick named lazarus
[11:03] of bethany the town of mary and her
[11:06] sister martha
[11:07] it was that mary which anointed the lord
[11:09] with ointment
[11:10] and wiped his feet with her hair whose
[11:13] brother
[11:14] lazarus was sick then took mary a pound
[11:18] of ointment of spike nerd
[11:20] very costly and anointed the feet of
[11:22] jesus
[11:23] and wiped his feet with her hair and the
[11:25] house was
[11:26] filled with the odor of the ointment
[11:30] the greek lexicon says this pound of
[11:32] ointment was 12 ounces of fragrant oil
[11:36] mary used her hair to wipe the precious
[11:38] feet of jesus christ
[11:40] to prepare him for his burial this
[11:43] undeniable witness
[11:44] helps prove that godly women in the days
[11:46] of jesus did not cut their hair
[11:49] because it would be impossible for a
[11:50] woman with short hair
[11:52] to wash the feet of christ short bobbed
[11:55] hair could not wrap around the feet of
[11:56] jesus
[11:57] and act as a towel to clean and anoint
[12:00] those precious
[12:01] holy feet the forgiven woman at simon's
[12:06] house
[12:07] a fourth text is luke 7 verses 36-50
[12:11] is very similar to that of john 12 3
[12:14] as luke speaks of a woman which was a
[12:16] sinner who went into the house of simon
[12:18] the pharisee
[12:20] she must have seen how simon and his
[12:22] servants did not kiss
[12:23] jesus or wash his feet upon his entrance
[12:26] or anoint his head with oil being moved
[12:30] by her love for christ as savior
[12:32] the woman ceased not to kiss his feet
[12:35] anoint them with oil
[12:36] wash them with her tears of repentance
[12:39] and wipe them
[12:40] with the hairs of her head this act of
[12:42] love caused jesus
[12:44] to tell her plainly that her sins were
[12:47] forgiven
[12:48] observe again that this forgiven woman
[12:51] could not
[12:52] have wiped jesus feet with short bobbed
[12:54] hair
[12:55] she had to have long uncut hair with
[12:58] years of growth
[12:59] in order to wipe the precious feet of
[13:01] the lord jesus christ
[13:04] locust with the hair of women the fifth
[13:07] text is revelation 9 verse 8
[13:09] and they had hair as the hair of women
[13:12] and their teeth were as the teeth of
[13:13] lions
[13:14] this scripture helps prove that god has
[13:16] specific different hair lengths for men
[13:18] and women
[13:20] revelation 9 verse 8 is part of a
[13:22] striking portion of scripture
[13:24] about the tribulation period detailed in
[13:26] revelation 9
[13:27] verses 3 through 10. under the fifth
[13:30] trumpet during the tribulation
[13:32] god will allow locusts to torment
[13:34] unbelievers and those who have rejected
[13:36] jesus christ
[13:37] as lord and ruler of their lives
[13:41] one of the physical attributes of these
[13:42] locusts is that they have
[13:44] hair as the hair of women we must ask
[13:47] ourselves
[13:48] what is the hair of women what style of
[13:51] hair do these locusts have
[13:53] society cannot define what the hair of
[13:55] women means
[13:56] as many women have short hair and look
[13:58] like men
[14:00] god's word must define what hair of
[14:02] women means
[14:03] based upon paul's teaching from first
[14:05] corinthians 11
[14:06] verses 1 to 16 women's hair is long
[14:10] and uncut the tormenting locus
[14:13] had to have long uncut hair it seems
[14:16] their job is to torment the
[14:18] christ-rejecting people
[14:20] who willingly took the mark of the beast
[14:22] but why
[14:24] it seems that god may be allowing these
[14:26] locusts to haunt the sinners
[14:27] because they have refused to honor many
[14:30] of god's commands
[14:31] obviously they did not accept god's
[14:33] salvation
[14:35] the baptism of the holy ghost and even
[14:37] hair length
[14:38] these rebellious religious apostates
[14:41] allowed their women to bob their hair
[14:43] and dishonor their husbands and god's
[14:46] word
[14:47] they never taught against men growing
[14:49] their hair
[14:50] out long to look like women these false
[14:53] teachers and their followers
[14:55] took away the glory of god which was the
[14:57] long uncut hair from the women
[15:00] allowing women to cut their hair shame
[15:03] their husbands
[15:04] and ultimately christ the only
[15:06] description worthy of their rebellion
[15:08] would be ichabod for the glory of the
[15:11] woman and of the man
[15:12] god's symbol of submission and headship
[15:15] was taken away from the people
[15:17] the preachers took away truth from the
[15:19] people and failed to preach the entire
[15:22] holy bible
[15:23] as a result both the speakers and
[15:25] hearers were worthy
[15:26] of the wrath of god how long does god
[15:30] want women's hair
[15:32] one question that i've been asked
[15:34] repeatedly on my youtube channel
[15:35] is how long does god want my hair to be
[15:39] the answer is as long as your hair can
[15:41] grow
[15:42] there is no set length that god is
[15:44] asking women to achieve
[15:46] such as 12 or 24 inches god wants a
[15:49] woman to leave her hair uncut
[15:51] for the remainder of her life god
[15:54] designed that a woman's genetics
[15:56] determines exactly how long her hair
[15:58] will be
[15:59] and he is pleased if her hair is 3
[16:01] inches at its full length
[16:03] or 6 inches or 12 inches or longer
[16:07] god is not asking for a specific length
[16:09] of hair
[16:10] he is only asking for uncut hair as a
[16:13] symbol of her full obedience
[16:15] to her husband
[16:21] old testament teaching on hair length in
[16:24] the old testament
[16:25] just as in the new you will find again
[16:28] the indisputable truth
[16:29] that god never asked a godly woman to
[16:32] cut her hair
[16:33] i conclude that paul's teaching from the
[16:35] new testament is in complete harmony
[16:37] with god's desire for hair length in the
[16:39] old testament
[16:40] god's desire for separate hair lengths
[16:43] for women and men
[16:44] remain unchanged from genesis 1 1 to
[16:47] revelation
[16:48] 22 21
[16:51] some bible readers may be familiar with
[16:53] the nazirite vow
[16:54] from numbers 6 verses 1 to 21.
[16:58] part of this vow is for the dedicated
[17:00] individual
[17:01] a man in this case not to cut his hair
[17:03] for a period of time
[17:05] at the end of the vow he would cut his
[17:07] hair
[17:08] in this case uncut hair was a sign of
[17:10] total consecration
[17:12] or dedication to god i cannot find an
[17:15] example of a woman
[17:16] under a nazarite vow nor have i found a
[17:19] woman
[17:19] under a nazrite vow ever cutting her
[17:22] hair
[17:22] so it would seem that only men were to
[17:25] cut their hair
[17:25] at the conclusion of their nazerite vow
[17:29] it seems women in terms of their hair
[17:31] were under a lifelong nazarite vow
[17:34] meaning they were never to cut their
[17:36] hair this
[17:37] lifelong dedication would be in complete
[17:39] harmony with god's command
[17:42] for women's hair length in the new
[17:44] testament
[17:45] according to scripture alone god has
[17:47] always asked all godly women
[17:49] whether jewish or christian to do the
[17:51] same
[17:52] leave their hair uncut as a sign of
[17:55] total consecration
[17:56] or dedication to the plan of god for
[17:59] their lives
[18:00] all christian women are under a similar
[18:02] total consecration to god
[18:04] not to cut their hair in order to
[18:06] display the symbol of headship
[18:09] furthermore as you read deeper in the
[18:11] old testament there are two specific
[18:13] cases in which
[18:14] god did command the cutting of hair but
[18:16] it was never command given to godly
[18:18] jewish women
[18:20] such as sarah rebecca abigail esther
[18:23] and the like therefore these two
[18:26] examples do not pertain to consecrated
[18:28] christian women
[18:29] today the first example is deuteronomy
[18:32] 21 verses
[18:34] 10 through 13. moses commanded that
[18:37] israelite men were to have their new
[18:39] wives
[18:40] taken from captivity after war with an
[18:42] enemy nation
[18:44] shaved their own heads as part of their
[18:46] transition into the jewish religion and
[18:48] culture
[18:49] observe that the faithful experienced
[18:52] jewish women were never commanded to cut
[18:54] their hair
[18:55] in any manner
[18:59] the second example is jeremiah 7 verses
[19:02] 28-30 god was speaking to jerusalem
[19:06] the capital of the nation of israel and
[19:08] upbraided them for their disobedience
[19:10] rebellion and abominable acts god said
[19:14] cut off thine hair o jerusalem and cast
[19:17] it away
[19:18] and take up a lamentation on high places
[19:21] for the lord hath rejected and forsaken
[19:24] the generation of his wrath
[19:26] it is difficult to tell if god was
[19:28] speaking literally to every man and
[19:30] woman
[19:31] or just men or just women in this case
[19:34] it is likely that this is simply
[19:36] figurative language in which god
[19:38] was speaking to the entire people rather
[19:40] than individuals
[19:41] one thing is for sure god told them to
[19:44] cut off their hair
[19:45] because he was rejecting and forsaking
[19:47] their generation
[19:49] due to their wickedness and abominable
[19:51] acts
[19:52] so cutting hair in this case was a sign
[19:54] of being rejected by god
[19:56] similarly a woman cutting her hair today
[19:59] is a shameful act
[20:01] and a sign that she is not submitting to
[20:03] her husband
[20:05] conclusion all the infallible bible
[20:08] evidence
[20:09] concerning hair length proves that
[20:11] christian men should frequently cut
[20:13] their hair
[20:14] so as not to bring shame upon themselves
[20:16] and their head
[20:18] the lord jesus christian women should
[20:20] let their hair grow long and uncut
[20:22] for the rest of their consecrated walks
[20:24] with the lord jesus
[20:26] obedience will bring honor and glory to
[20:28] their husbands
[20:29] and their spiritual husband jesus christ
[20:33] god never asked an obedient faithful
[20:35] godly jewish or christian woman
[20:38] to cut her hair for the sake of fashion
[20:41] convenience
[20:42] style or beauty as some women believe
[20:44] they can today
[20:46] all christian women are to have long
[20:48] uncut hair
[20:49] as a sign that they are under the
[20:51] headship of their husbands
[20:53] christ and god living by these truths
[20:57] will keep the covering of the anointing
[20:59] of the holy ghost upon us
[21:01] that the glory of god not depart from
[21:04] our homes
[21:04] and churches
