[0:16] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:18] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:21] this video is to show you how a prophet
[0:23] of God William brandham planned for his
[0:26] new year so you can plan and prepare for
[0:29] 20 24 by the grace of God hi my name is
[0:33] Pastor Jesse Smith I've been pastoring
[0:35] bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan
[0:37] Ohio USA for 17 years and I defend the
[0:41] Bible revelations that Jesus Christ
[0:43] revealed to his Prophet William brandham
[0:46] in this video I'm going to show four
[0:47] simple quotes from God's Prophet brother
[0:49] brandom hopefully this will give you
[0:51] some insight and guidelines into how you
[0:53] can prepare for the brand new year
[0:56] 2024 starting with the first quote this
[0:58] is from July 24th 1963 God doesn't call
[1:03] man to judgment without first warning
[1:04] him in Jeffersonville Indiana and
[1:07] friends as you listen to this quote
[1:08] imagine having 1,000 invitations to
[1:11] preach for one year brother brandom had
[1:13] over a th000 invitations to preach and
[1:15] he had to make a decision about which
[1:17] invitations he would accept and so if
[1:20] you're feeling overwhelmed with todos or
[1:23] jobs or projects or responsibilities for
[1:26] 2024 you're not alone most of us battle
[1:29] press your times to accomplish all the
[1:31] things on our to-do list but think about
[1:33] this a prophet of God had over a
[1:35] thousand invitations so how did he
[1:36] approach this insurmountable list of
[1:39] imitations well he tells us in the quote
[1:41] you'll hear brother brandom say he laid
[1:43] out all the imitations before God then
[1:46] prayed in order to find the will of God
[1:48] he said he would lay his imitations
[1:50] before the Lord and then talk to the
[1:52] Lord and say now you tell me Heavenly
[1:54] Father which ones to accept let's listen
[1:56] to the
[1:57] quote Billy right now is working on old
[1:59] overseas for a complete World Tour
[2:02] beginning right immediately after
[2:03] Christmas and I'm all booked up until
[2:05] around about December and uh well maybe
[2:08] the first week in December Dallas so
[2:10] then um then in January we want to start
[2:14] on a complete World Tour all way around
[2:16] completely and we're working on that now
[2:19] finding just where the Lord will lead
[2:21] and and I I'm so grateful to the even to
[2:24] the people of ministers as much as I say
[2:27] against their denominations and things
[2:29] like that you know on the books Lane
[2:31] right back there now brother Roy borders
[2:33] takes care of the invitations and since
[2:36] Christmas the first of the year there's
[2:38] been over a thousand invitations around
[2:41] the world a thousand invitations has
[2:44] come in back there so the Lord just has
[2:46] to direct me on which one of those to go
[2:48] to and what to do we just depend on him
[2:51] you couldn't take them all you you
[2:52] couldn't take over uh eight or 10 of
[2:55] them in a summer if you had to in a in a
[2:57] complete unless you just go one night
[2:59] here and one night there and that's
[3:00] they're asking for two weeks and 3 weeks
[3:02] and so forth as long as you can stay
[3:04] here some of them says just long as the
[3:06] Lord will lead and and all like that so
[3:09] you don't know just exactly where to
[3:11] start or what to do so we're just laying
[3:14] them out before the Lord and say now you
[3:16] tell us heavenly father and you help me
[3:18] pray with this matter see you help me
[3:20] pray that we can get this over and I
[3:23] thought now building on this quote let's
[3:25] go to the second quote from a super
[3:27] sense 1959 December 27th evening service
[3:31] here we get more details about how
[3:32] brother Brandon would handle all of his
[3:34] imitations now in this quote you'll
[3:36] notice he didn't have a lot of time to
[3:37] make the decisions he had about a week
[3:39] to decide which invitations he would
[3:41] accept for the upcoming year which would
[3:43] have been 1960 and the further details
[3:45] are this he would go for a walk and pray
[3:48] and then he would go for a drive and
[3:50] pray and look for inspiration from the
[3:52] Holy Spirit and then he would also ask
[3:54] the people to pray for him that he could
[3:57] find the will of God let's listen to the
[3:59] quote
[4:01] now this is going to be a great week for
[4:06] me coming tomorrow the Lord
[4:08] willing I've got to make decisions for
[4:12] the coming
[4:13] year well all the invitations I want to
[4:16] go out to to the office and pick up all
[4:19] my invitations and bring them home
[4:22] therefore for the next few days I go to
[4:26] prayer to God and pray for
[4:30] Him to guide me and show me which way to
[4:33] go and what to do we don't live in a
[4:37] time like it was when he was here where
[4:40] God led him from place to place and he
[4:42] was in a town for a few hours and gone
[4:45] to another city but today it's on a
[4:47] different system it's a setup
[4:50] ministerial groups and a lot of things
[4:52] has to be done and the way I do it I
[4:54] bring in all my African invitations and
[4:58] lay them down all the India invitations
[5:01] and all the California the Utah and all
[5:05] different invitations and put them
[5:06] separately in piles I let them lay and
[5:10] then I take to walking and praying maybe
[5:13] get him a car and be gone a day or two
[5:16] come back praying something comes on my
[5:19] heart to go to a certain place then I
[5:21] see if it's just an
[5:23] impression then afterwards then I if
[5:27] it's impressed me so hard I go to this
[5:30] pile where this certain place is then
[5:33] pick me up a letter and read it of
[5:36] invitation to see where it's at then
[5:38] from there here's the reason I do
[5:41] that you think of riding about 72 hours
[5:45] on a
[5:45] plane in the storms and up and down and
[5:49] around if you ever rode
[5:51] overseas don't know sometimes you're up
[5:54] and sometimes it's down and swinging and
[5:57] rocking and pitching through them clouds
[5:59] over that water for three days and
[6:03] nights then you step off onto a land and
[6:06] the first thing meet you is
[6:09] Satan well the ministerial group said
[6:12] this some of them divided on the vote
[6:14] and some for see then you might say this
[6:18] well maybe the Lord didn't want me to
[6:21] come but when you're s of God you're
[6:25] ready to meet the enemy you see I step
[6:27] here in the name of Jesus Christ Christ
[6:30] I come in the name of the Lord
[6:33] Jesus here I stay till his Works
[6:36] accomplished see and you are ready to
[6:38] meet the
[6:39] forces so you love me I know you do so
[6:42] pray for me this week that I'll make the
[6:45] right decisions by the inspiration of
[6:48] God will lead me so now that we heard
[6:51] both those quotes let's make a simple
[6:53] list of how you and I can approach 2024
[6:56] so first write out or lay out all your
[6:58] desires before the Lord I find it
[7:01] helpful to write them down on a piece of
[7:02] paper or in my
[7:04] notebook here's the notebook I'm using
[7:06] for 20124 I started using it in 2023 I
[7:10] still got pages left in it so I'm going
[7:11] to use up the rest of the pages Lord
[7:13] willing sometime in 2024 and switch to a
[7:15] new notebook so that's step one write
[7:18] out or lay out your desires before the
[7:21] Lord second step is pray so we should
[7:24] pray and ask the heavenly father to show
[7:25] us his will for our desires for 2024
[7:30] then step three is wait brother Bram
[7:32] said he would go for a walk and pray or
[7:34] go for a drive and pray next step is
[7:37] wait for inspiration to strike so
[7:40] basically you have those four steps and
[7:42] then once the inspiration strikes then
[7:44] you follow that inspiration by the grace
[7:46] of God those are the goals those are the
[7:48] projects that you accept and try to
[7:51] accomplish for the glory of God very
[7:53] simple isn't it it's a prophet of God
[7:55] trying to find the will of God and I
[7:57] love how brother Braham gives us these
[7:58] simple steps these simple god-honoring
[8:00] steps of just praying waiting on God
[8:02] looking for the Holy Spirit to move I
[8:05] want to share a third and fourth quote
[8:06] as well in the third quote brother
[8:07] brandom said times when he didn't feel
[8:09] he had a leading of the Lord he would
[8:11] depend on another brother's leading of
[8:13] the Lord in this case it's brother Argan
[8:15] bright so how this applies to you and I
[8:18] if we're praying and waiting on the will
[8:20] of God or the leading of the Lord and we
[8:22] don't get it right away we can go with
[8:24] someone else's leading if we know
[8:26] they're genuinely led by the Lord that's
[8:28] what brother Ram says in this quote
[8:30] brother Ram said I'll go with brother
[8:31] arganbright because I know God leads him
[8:34] let's listen to the quote now brother
[8:36] Aron just never runs out of things to do
[8:39] for the Lord Jesus and he doesn't do
[8:41] them grudgingly he just freely goes out
[8:44] and doesn't I couldn't have even taken
[8:47] trips overseas if it hadn't been his
[8:50] help and he's got a burden on his heart
[8:52] when he hits a burden for some Nation
[8:54] here he'll come I'll see it his car
[8:57] drive in the yard and I well me you sa
[8:59] my wife say well here we go overseas
[9:01] again don't
[9:03] we so brother argot with a burden on his
[9:06] heart and he's such a Godly little
[9:08] person even I have no leading yet I'll
[9:10] go with him because I know God leads him
[9:13] and so we appreciate him with all of our
[9:15] heart fourth and finally here's a quote
[9:17] from Shalom 1964 January
[9:20] 12th in this quote brother R tells us he
[9:23] has no leading on his schedule so he
[9:26] said I'm just simply going out to try to
[9:28] do whatever I can here's another
[9:31] suggestion if you do all these steps and
[9:33] you're just waiting on the Lord and you
[9:35] still have no leading like brother
[9:37] brandham says you can take some
[9:38] encouragement from brother brandham just
[9:40] to do something continue doing something
[9:41] so in brother Ram's case he would
[9:43] continue having Services continue
[9:45] preaching waiting to get some other
[9:47] leading from the Lord but until he got a
[9:50] special leading he stayed doing what he
[9:51] normally would do preach let's listen to
[9:54] the
[9:54] quote had a our first little group of
[9:58] meetings here I don't know where you
[9:59] have not the schedule here if some of
[10:01] you how leave it laying here Pastor re
[10:05] where we're to be at and if the Lord
[10:07] willing that is the Lord willing I have
[10:08] no leading for I'm just simply going out
[10:10] to try to do whatever I can and if you
[10:13] got any loved ones around in there would
[10:14] like to come to one of the meetings
[10:16] while you write letter tell to one of
[10:18] these in closing friends I hope this
[10:21] video was a blessing I preach these
[10:23] quotes at our home Church they were such
[10:24] a blessing to me the people seem to
[10:26] enjoy it as well I just thought it was
[10:28] so inspiring to get a look into a
[10:29] genuine prophet of God and how he would
[10:32] find the will of God for each year
[10:34] friends most of us probably don't have a
[10:35] thousand things to do in our to-do list
[10:38] if you do well then may God help you but
[10:40] no matter what if you're feeling
[10:41] overwhelmed here we can see from Brother
[10:43] bram's example cast your cares upon the
[10:45] Lord just lay out everything before the
[10:46] Lord you can lay it out on paper lay it
[10:49] out on your computer and then present
[10:51] yourself before the Lord reminds me of
[10:52] Romans 12 present your body as a Living
[10:55] Sacrifice and as you wait on the Lord
[10:57] you renew your strength like the eagle
[10:59] according to Isaiah and then God will
[11:01] transform your mind you'll see the
[11:03] inspiration of the Holy Spirit strike
[11:04] and you'll know which way to go you know
[11:06] which projects to work on or which
[11:08] places to travel so by God's grace I
[11:10] look for some testimonies to come out of
[11:11] this video Lord willing hopefully God
[11:13] will guide and direct you for 2024 and
[11:16] Beyond by the grace of God maybe next
[11:18] year I'll reuse this quote or redo this
[11:21] video and make it a fresh one for 2025
[11:24] if the Lord terries and before finishing
[11:27] up I want to wish you a wonderful new
[11:29] New Year by the grace of God and here's
[11:31] a quote where brother Brandon wishes a
[11:32] Happy New Year to the Saints and wishes
[11:34] all the blessings that God can pour out
[11:36] upon his people let's listen to the
[11:38] quote now I want to say this before I
[11:40] start I wish to each one of you all the
[11:44] most successful and blessful and
[11:48] healthy New Years that I can wish to you
[11:51] God be with you may you grow both
[11:53] physically spiritually
[11:55] financially and materially everything
[11:59] that God can bring up on you I pray that
[12:01] he'll do
[12:02] it if you have any questions concerns or
[12:05] testimonies about this video please
[12:07] contact
[12:08] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[12:11] the desire of your
[12:14] [Music]
[12:15] heart
