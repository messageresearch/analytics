[0:07] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:13] this video is to show 30 Bible verses
[0:16] that God's Prophet brother William
[0:18] Branham used to define his end-time
[0:21] message so this video answers the
[0:23] question what is the message and this
[0:26] video is a follow-up on the two podcasts
[0:28] I recently put out that are titled are
[0:31] you the message Parts one and two and I
[0:34] apologize my voice is a little hoarse I
[0:37] preached twice over the Easter weekend
[0:38] and we had a tremendous time of
[0:40] worshiping Our Risen Lord Jesus Christ
[0:44] recall that the word message means any
[0:46] notice word or communication written or
[0:49] verbal sent from one person to another
[0:53] so the bible message of today is the
[0:56] word of God sent from Jesus Christ to
[0:59] his bride the Holy Ghost filled Church
[1:01] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04] and I like to use this quote from
[1:05] Brother Branham from the Rapture 1965
[1:08] where he calls the message God's promise
[1:11] of the hour what God was scripturally
[1:13] vindicating from the Bible let's listen
[1:16] to the quote
[1:18] many of his strangers perhaps hear these
[1:20] men get up and they make these remarks
[1:22] about a message at this hour and so
[1:25] forth what they are getting at is God's
[1:28] promise of this hour that he promised
[1:30] what he would do and we seem
[1:32] scripturally vindicating just exactly
[1:34] what he said he would do in the same
[1:36] manner foretold it's just exactly
[1:39] perfectly each time because it's God
[1:41] saying it
[1:43] so I really appreciated the feedback
[1:45] from the first two podcasts and Lord
[1:47] willing in the future we'll make a video
[1:49] about how we are the word but the best
[1:51] way to say it is we are a part of the
[1:53] word because we were chosen in Christ
[1:55] before the foundation of the world
[1:57] according to Ephesians 1 verse 4. of
[2:00] course we know Christ is the word
[2:01] according to John 1 verse 1. in the
[2:04] beginning was the word and the words
[2:05] with God and the Word was God in
[2:08] Revelation 19 Jesus comes from heaven
[2:10] and his name is called the word of God
[2:12] but we must remember and we see from the
[2:16] scripture that we are born again of the
[2:17] word of God according to First Peter 1
[2:20] verse 23 so there is a portion or
[2:23] measure of the word of God in our souls
[2:25] when our souls are baptized with the
[2:27] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost anointing in
[2:30] our souls is a part of God's eternal
[2:32] spirit and God's spirit is the word in
[2:36] spirit form so according to the Bible
[2:38] the only way we can be the word is that
[2:40] we have a portion or measure of the word
[2:42] in our souls and so we fulfill the word
[2:45] of God and when we witness about Jesus
[2:48] Christ we're carriers of the word or
[2:50] when ministers preach about the Lord
[2:52] Jesus Christ we are declaring the word
[2:54] of God but we would never say we are the
[2:57] full word of God because that is for
[3:00] Jesus Christ Alone
[3:01] as the Bible said he was the fullness of
[3:03] the godhead bodily we are not the
[3:05] fullness of the word we just have a
[3:07] portion of the word of God and of course
[3:09] we find this truth in Colossians 2 verse
[3:11] 9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness
[3:13] of the godhead bodily
[3:16] before we start here's two screenshots
[3:19] of the 30 verses brother Branham uses to
[3:22] define the bible message of the end time
[3:25] here's numbers 1 through 21
[3:29] and here's Numbers 22 through 30 and of
[3:32] course friends there could be many many
[3:34] more these are just the 30 I found
[3:36] through maybe 10 to 20 hours of study I
[3:39] don't know I'm just guessing
[3:41] so let's begin with Hebrews 13 verse 8
[3:43] it says Jesus Christ is the same
[3:46] yesterday and today and forever and
[3:48] let's listen as brother random says this
[3:50] scripture is the same message he's
[3:52] always preached
[3:53] have I never see you again this side of
[3:56] the river I'll see you on the other side
[3:58] believing in the same word with the same
[4:00] mission that Jesus Christ did the same
[4:02] yesterday that said day and forever and
[4:04] Center of
[4:05] handsome but his word will never fail do
[4:07] you believe it
[4:08] here's another quote from three kinds of
[4:11] Believers where brother Rams says the
[4:13] messages Hebrews 13 8.
[4:19] the latter day the evening time when the
[4:22] lights are shining and the things has
[4:24] been opened up and the word Vindicated
[4:26] it proved to be the truth both
[4:28] prophesied comes to pass all these
[4:31] scientific is everything proved that it
[4:34] is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[4:35] forever and a man walk out on that
[4:39] he's a non-believer
[4:42] Beyond hopes he's known by the prayer of
[4:45] Satan
[4:46] the second verse is Acts 2 38 which says
[4:49] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[4:51] baptized every one of you in the name of
[4:52] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[4:54] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[4:56] Holy Ghost here's two quotes about that
[4:58] one from taking sides with Jesus and the
[5:01] other from Jezebel religion
[5:07] well you think it's badly thought of now
[5:09] you ought to notice and there's nobody
[5:11] and then this water baptism in the name
[5:15] of Jesus Christ and the blessings and
[5:17] things that we believe in and stand for
[5:20] tellers
[5:27] ections
[5:36] [Music]
[5:43] you'll be a servant of God
[5:46] sure will
[5:48] the Bible said he would come
[5:52] the third verse is Malachi chapter 4
[5:55] verses 5 and 6. it says behold I send
[5:58] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[6:00] of the great and Dreadful day of the
[6:01] Lord and he shall turn the heart of the
[6:03] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[6:05] the children to their fathers lest I
[6:06] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[6:10] here's a quote from questions and
[6:11] answers part 4 1964 where brother random
[6:15] quotes Malachi 4 verse 6.
[6:21] on the Holy Spirit wrote it for this
[6:23] prophet he said he will turn the hearts
[6:26] of the fathers first to the children
[6:30] see that with John's first coming
[6:33] he turned the hearts of the fathers the
[6:36] old patriarch fathers to the message of
[6:38] the children which was the new
[6:40] generation then Jesus and that
[6:42] generation then and conjuncts that time
[6:45] together the hearts of the children back
[6:47] to the fathers which means the message
[6:49] of the day will turn the hearts of the
[6:51] children in the church age back to the
[6:53] original Pentecostal faith of the
[6:55] beginning
[6:57] another quote on Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6
[7:00] as the message is from what shall we do
[7:03] with this Jesus called Christ 1964.
[7:05] let's listen to the quote
[7:08] simple man could there be today
[7:18] and the things that he promised during
[7:20] this day Malachi 4 being fulfilled all
[7:23] the rest of scriptures being fulfilled
[7:25] and sit right here at the end of the
[7:27] time you don't need any man to interpret
[7:29] it no sign interprets itself
[7:32] it's the
[7:36] man turn to God all
[7:39] the church is repent and turn to God
[7:42] on a Washington
[7:46] the fourth verse is Luke 24 47 and that
[7:50] says and that repentance and remission
[7:52] of sins should be preached in his name
[7:54] among all nations beginning at Jerusalem
[7:56] and brother baptized this in with Acts 2
[7:58] 38 because Luke 24 47 said in his name
[8:03] one name singular that's the name of the
[8:05] Lord Jesus Christ let's listen to the
[8:07] quote from Revelation chapter 4 part 3
[8:09] 1961.
[8:16] [Music]
[8:20] foreign
[8:22] [Music]
[8:39] [Music]
[8:47] verse is Jude 1 verse 3. beloved when I
[8:52] gave all diligence to write unto you of
[8:53] the common salvation it was needful for
[8:55] me to write unto you and exhort you that
[8:57] you should earnestly contend for the
[9:00] faith which was once delivered unto the
[9:01] Saints but around uses this quote and
[9:04] Malachi 4 5 and 6 in a sermon God's
[9:07] chosen place of worship 1965. let's
[9:10] listen to the quote
[9:12] and that's supposed to be the message of
[9:14] the hour to restore back the hearts of
[9:16] the children back to the Fate that was
[9:18] once delivered to the Saints
[9:20] won't you accept it tonight
[9:24] the sixth and seventh verses are
[9:26] Revelation 10 1-7 and Matthew 20 verse
[9:30] 6. I'm not going to read all of
[9:31] Revelation 10 1-7 but I'll paraphrase
[9:34] it's the mighty angel coming down with
[9:36] an open book and his voice Thunder seven
[9:39] times then the Bible says in verse 7 for
[9:41] the days of the voice of the seventh
[9:43] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[9:45] mystery of God should be finished as he
[9:47] has revealed unto his servants the
[9:48] prophets of course we believe this verse
[9:50] is the Lord Jesus Christ coming down in
[9:53] 1963 to reveal the revelation of the
[9:56] Seven Seals to his Prophet brother
[9:57] William Branham and then Matthew 20
[10:00] verse 6 says and about the 11th hour he
[10:02] went out and found other standing Idol
[10:04] and saith unto them why stand ye here
[10:06] all the day Idol brother Brown says we
[10:08] are the eleventh hour workers and that's
[10:10] the message of the hour it's from
[10:11] recognizing your dance message 1964.
[10:16] Angel's message is to open the mystery
[10:19] of the seals
[10:21] calling the 11th Hour Gentiles workers
[10:25] to receive the same pay that the first
[10:29] hour workers got
[10:32] the eighth verse is Luke 17 30 which
[10:34] says even thus shall be in the day when
[10:36] the son of man is revealed
[10:37] of course this is speaking of Jesus
[10:39] Christ being revealed in the prophetic
[10:41] Ministry of brother Branham in this
[10:44] quote brother random also cites
[10:45] Revelation 10 1-7 it's from what is the
[10:48] attraction on the mount in 1965 let's
[10:50] listen to the quote
[10:56] that's what all this noise is about
[11:00] notice God fulfilling his promised word
[11:05] again of Revelations 10 1-7 and in the
[11:09] days of the sounding of the seventh
[11:11] Angels message the mystery of God should
[11:14] be finished
[11:15] the hidden Mystery of Revelations
[11:17] 10 1-7 the last message to the last at
[11:21] church age
[11:23] full Fields attacked the end of sage
[11:26] St Luke 17 30 the days when the son of
[11:29] man shall be revealed National rise
[11:32] false prophets and false Christ
[11:35] notice later on the quote brother Ram
[11:37] says Revelation 10 1-7 is fulfilled
[11:40] prophecy let's listen to the quote
[11:43] and the god of Heaven promised the
[11:45] evening time would have evening lights
[11:48] three years ago this mystery was a
[11:50] prophecy but what time is it sir but now
[11:54] is history
[11:56] it's past the promise is fulfilled
[12:01] what time is it sir what's this
[12:03] attraction
[12:04] God fulfilling his word
[12:10] he's the same yesterday today and
[12:11] forever let us pray
[12:14] and that's why I believe Revelation 10
[12:17] 1-7 was fulfilled beginning in 1963 all
[12:21] the way to the end of brother Ram's life
[12:23] so he could finish the mystery of God
[12:24] before he passed away
[12:26] of course I wrote a book on that in 2021
[12:29] I'm not a book salesman but if you want
[12:31] a free copy let me know the 9th 10th and
[12:34] 11th verses are in the next quote from
[12:36] doors indoor 1965 Revelation 18 verse 4
[12:40] Matthew 25 1-13 and Luke 21 verse 28
[12:44] Revelation 18 4 says and I heard another
[12:47] voice from Heaven saying come out of her
[12:48] my people that ye be not partakers of
[12:50] her sins and that you receive not of her
[12:52] plagues brother Ram says that's the
[12:54] message of today to come out of
[12:55] denominationalism of course Matthew 25
[12:58] 1-13 is the parable of the wise and
[13:00] foolish virgins but the RAM tells us we
[13:02] need to be the wise virgins with the oil
[13:05] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost ready
[13:07] for Jesus coming Jesus is the bridegroom
[13:09] and then Luke 21 verse 28 is Jesus
[13:12] saying when these things begin to come
[13:14] to pass then look up and lift up your
[13:16] heads you re for your Redemption draweth
[13:18] and I let's listen to the quote
[13:20] we find that our messages today the
[13:23] message that we have of come out of
[13:26] Babylon and be free and be filled with
[13:28] the spirit your land streaming clear and
[13:31] look up our redemptions drawing there we
[13:34] these things are foreign to many people
[13:36] who breathe and call our lovely lord's
[13:40] name
[13:41] here's another quote from why I'm
[13:43] against organized religion 1962 where
[13:45] Bill Graham says Revelation 18 4 is the
[13:48] message of the hour let's listen to the
[13:50] quote
[13:52] immediately after her mystery was made
[13:56] known
[14:00] [Music]
[14:03] then God sent an angel a messenger
[14:09] go ahead
[14:15] [Applause]
[14:15] [Music]
[14:17] the message of the hour
[14:21] my people
[14:23] that should be not partakers of verse
[14:25] plagues uh you're going to cursor
[14:29] the 12th verse is Ephesians 4 verses
[14:32] 8-16 but specifically Ephesians 4 11 and
[14:36] he gave some Apostles and some prophets
[14:38] and some evangelists and some pastors
[14:40] and teachers
[14:42] so brother ram calls the five full
[14:43] ministry the message of the hour
[14:45] notice brother random never said the
[14:47] message of the hour is press play and
[14:50] the fivefold ministry should sit down
[14:52] let's listen to the quote
[14:54] the bride of Christ have worth the bride
[14:58] of Christ
[14:59] have a Ministry for the Rapture sure
[15:05] that's what's going on right now okay
[15:07] the bride of Christ serve me it is the
[15:10] message of the hour amenity the bride of
[15:12] Christ sure she's consist of Apostles
[15:16] prophets teachers Bashers and pastors is
[15:18] that right that's a bride of Christ sure
[15:20] she's got a Ministry great Ministries
[15:22] the ministry of the hour it'll be so
[15:24] humble
[15:25] the 13th verse is Luke 2 verse 49 and he
[15:29] said unto them how is it that you sought
[15:31] me wish ye not that I must be about my
[15:33] father's business of course this is
[15:35] speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ
[15:37] but in this quote brother random says
[15:39] the seeker of the message is being about
[15:41] the father's business and this is from
[15:44] the identification of Christ in all ages
[15:46] 1964. let's listen to the quote
[15:50] there's the secret of the message now
[15:53] just exactly the father's business what
[15:56] is the father's business
[15:58] and notice in the same quote he cites
[16:01] Hebrews 13 8 Malachi 4 5 and 6
[16:04] Revelation chapter 10 and Luke 17 30.
[16:07] also in this quote brother random cites
[16:10] four more new scriptures to add to the
[16:12] list so in this quote he lists the 13th
[16:15] 14th 15th 16th and 17th verses that
[16:19] Define what is the message of the hour
[16:21] and again those are Luke 2 49 John 14 12
[16:25] is the 14th verse barely verily I say
[16:28] unto you he that believeth on me the
[16:29] works that I do shall he do also and
[16:31] Greater Works than these shall he do
[16:33] because I go unto my father
[16:35] and then he cites the serpent seed from
[16:37] Genesis 3 15 and I'll put energy between
[16:40] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[16:42] and her seed it shall bruise thy head
[16:44] and thou shalt bruise his heel
[16:46] and then he quotes the 16th verse
[16:48] Matthew 5 32 and that says but I say
[16:51] unto you that whosoever shall put away
[16:52] his wife saving for the cause of
[16:54] fornication causes her to commit
[16:56] adultery and whosoever shall marry her
[16:58] that his divorce committeth adultery of
[17:00] course speaking of marriage and divorce
[17:03] and then another marriage and divorce
[17:05] verse Matthew 19 verses 8 and 9 and he
[17:09] saith in them Moses because of the
[17:10] hardness of your heart suffered you to
[17:12] put away your wives but from the
[17:13] beginning it was not so and I say unto
[17:15] you whosoever shall put away his wife
[17:17] except would be for fornication and
[17:19] shall marry another committeth adultery
[17:21] and whoso meareth her which is put away
[17:23] doth commit adultery
[17:25] now notice brother Ram doesn't cite
[17:26] those specific verses but those verses
[17:29] are the revelation of marriage and
[17:31] divorce that brother man preached in
[17:32] February
[17:33] 1965. let's listen to the quote
[18:06] [Applause]
[18:10] and so forth
[18:13] that's a father's business
[18:17] the 18th verse is John 10 verse 35 which
[18:20] says if he called them Gods unto whom
[18:22] the word of God came and the scripture
[18:24] cannot be broken
[18:26] this verse is speaking how the word of
[18:27] God comes to prophets as it has in every
[18:30] day
[18:30] again Enoch's day Noah's day Abraham's
[18:34] day Moses day Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel
[18:37] and Malachi's day they were all gods or
[18:40] rulers or judges unto whom the word of
[18:43] God came and brother random uses this
[18:45] verse in the identified Christ of all
[18:46] ages 1964. let's listen to the quote
[18:55] God through the word of God came to and
[18:58] here I am the Son of God how do you
[19:00] condemn me
[19:01] oh my the same thing is today it's God
[19:04] manifested in fashion
[19:06] [Music]
[19:07] the message of the hour
[19:09] a lot of the day we can't have the
[19:12] mother messages back there they've come
[19:14] and lived up we live in a glamorable
[19:16] life
[19:17] and just a disclaimer friends we don't
[19:20] call ourselves Gods even though the
[19:21] Bible does call the children of God Gods
[19:24] that's in Psalm 82 verse 6 I have said
[19:26] ye are gods and all of you are the
[19:29] children of the most high that word
[19:31] God's in Hebrew means rulers or judges
[19:33] we believe it's more humble to call
[19:36] ourselves Kings and Priests unto God
[19:39] because that's what the Bible says we
[19:40] are and brother Ram said we're spiritual
[19:42] Kings ruling over the flesh the world
[19:44] the devil and sin in his church age book
[19:46] from 1965 and Romans 5 17 says that we
[19:51] shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ
[19:54] so who rules but a king or a judge and
[19:58] then Revelation 1 verse 6 says Christ
[20:02] hath made us Kings and Priests unto God
[20:04] and his father
[20:06] the 19th verses are all the verses in
[20:09] the book of Acts chapter 2 verses 1-47
[20:13] brother random says that it's thus saith
[20:16] the Lord we must come back to the
[20:17] message and he says the message is back
[20:19] to the original Pentecost so which
[20:22] chapter in the Bible speaks of the
[20:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of
[20:26] Pentecost that's Acts chapter 2. and
[20:28] this quotes from Gabriel's instructions
[20:30] to Daniel 1961 let's listen to the quote
[20:34] Hallelujah
[20:43] [Music]
[20:50] [Applause]
[20:56] come back to the original amen get away
[21:00] from your method as fast as pray as the
[21:02] current ideas
[21:03] Pentecostal sinless one the street and
[21:06] surprises whatever it is Church of God
[21:08] Nazarene Pilgrim holding this Church of
[21:11] Christ
[21:12] movement amen amen
[21:15] now I realize this strikes the world
[21:29] amen but the organization in itself
[21:40] [Applause]
[21:44] [Music]
[21:48] for them
[21:50] [Music]
[21:52] will swing the people back to the right
[21:57] to the original Pentecost and The
[21:59] Originals with the originals and the
[22:02] original one Hallelujah
[22:06] here's another quote from why 1961
[22:10] brother random says Acts 2 is the
[22:12] Pentecostal message and he says it's the
[22:14] message of the hour let's listen to the
[22:16] quote
[22:21] [Music]
[22:36] together
[22:38] [Music]
[22:44] listen to Memphis
[22:49] many calls for Grace
[22:56] blessings
[23:02] for us
[23:05] the 20th verse is Jeremiah 29 verses 10
[23:08] through 14. brother reads this in
[23:11] desperations 1963 and then in Jeremiah
[23:14] 29 verse 14 brother random reads the end
[23:17] of verse 14 and says we'll bring you
[23:20] again unto the place which I cause you
[23:22] to be carried away captive and then
[23:24] brother random adds the words back to
[23:26] Pentecost I put that in myself it
[23:28] doesn't say that that's what I was
[23:29] meaning to the church so let's listen to
[23:31] the quote
[23:36] [Applause]
[23:36] [Music]
[23:38] [Applause]
[23:40] sick
[23:43] and I will be found in you saith the
[23:46] Lord and I will turn away your captain
[23:50] and I will gather you from All Nations
[23:53] and from all the places
[24:01] unto the place which I cause you to be
[24:05] prepared away captain
[24:12] doesn't say
[24:16] the 21st verse is Joel 2 verses 23-26 in
[24:22] the church age book by the random said
[24:23] these scriptures are thus saith the Lord
[24:25] come back to the message let's listen to
[24:27] the quote
[24:29] what about the true seed
[24:31] it will happen just as we have said
[24:33] the people of God are being made ready
[24:35] by the word of truth from the messenger
[24:37] to this age
[24:38] in her will be the fullness of Pentecost
[24:41] for the spirit will bring the people
[24:42] right back to where they were at the
[24:44] beginning
[24:45] that is thus saith the Lord
[24:49] it is a saith the Lord for that is what
[24:52] Joel 2 23-26 says be glad then ye
[24:56] children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord
[24:59] your God for he have given you the
[25:01] former Reign moderately and evil cause
[25:04] to come down for you the rain the former
[25:06] rain and the latter rain in the first
[25:08] month
[25:09] and the floors shall be full of Wheat
[25:11] and the fats shall overflow with wine
[25:13] and oil
[25:14] and I will restore to you the years that
[25:16] the locusts have eaten the canker worms
[25:19] and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm
[25:21] my great Army which I sent among you and
[25:24] you shall eat him plenty and be
[25:25] satisfied and praise the name of the
[25:28] Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously
[25:30] with you and my people shall never be
[25:33] ashamed
[25:36] the 22nd verse is John 5 24 which says
[25:40] verily bear this and to you he that
[25:42] heareth my word and believeth on him
[25:43] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[25:45] shall not come into condemnation but as
[25:48] fast from Death unto life
[25:50] brother says this is the message of the
[25:51] hour and true Eagles will understand it
[25:54] in the Easter seal 1965. let's listen to
[25:57] the quote
[26:01] he will understand
[26:04] the message of the hour
[26:07] a tree Eagle now the little Eagle
[26:09] problem the Barnyard was eating all
[26:11] right
[26:12] you know what it was just exactly right
[26:15] but then when he heard the truth then he
[26:18] received this truth now in John 14 uh
[26:22] John 5 24 rather Jesus said speaking
[26:25] this way
[26:27] he that Europe my words
[26:30] and believeth on him that sent me had
[26:34] everlasting life and shall not come into
[26:37] the Judgment but pass from Death on the
[26:40] line
[26:41] think how simple it is he that believer
[26:46] the 23rd verse is First Corinthians 6
[26:49] verse 11 and such were some of you but
[26:51] ye are washed but ye are Sanctified but
[26:54] you're justified in the name of the Lord
[26:55] Jesus and by the spirit of our God
[26:58] now brother Ram doesn't read this
[26:59] scripture but he says the message is the
[27:02] three works of Grace justification
[27:04] sanctification and the baptism of the
[27:06] Holy Ghost and we can see this taught in
[27:08] the Bible in First Corinthians 6 verse
[27:11] 11 but let's listen to the quote from it
[27:13] is the rising of the Sun 1965.
[27:34] these three steps
[27:36] before they hit the highway
[27:38] and on the highways a little early life
[27:41] White Lines into the the doors of Heaven
[27:45] that Pearl has been stretched out to the
[27:48] top of these tests if that ain't my
[27:50] message exactly today
[27:54] I would think that a person has to come
[27:57] by these three steps to be able to walk
[27:59] their highways
[28:01] to go along with that the 24th verse is
[28:04] Mark 4 verse 28 and this speaks of the
[28:07] three works of Grace this is Jesus
[28:09] talking and he said for the Earth
[28:10] bringeth forth fruit of herself first
[28:12] the blade then the ear after that the
[28:15] full corn in the ear so in this
[28:17] scripture Jesus is giving a parable and
[28:20] it reveals the three works of Grace he
[28:22] compares the three works of grace to the
[28:25] three stages of a seed growing and
[28:27] brother Rama actually uses the same
[28:28] symbolism in he swore by himself 1954.
[28:32] let's listen to the quote
[28:39] not three different dispensations not
[28:41] three works of Grace but one work and
[28:43] three different manifestations
[28:45] man holy spirit loser under
[28:47] justification without her wisely which
[28:49] magnification do the church now in the
[28:52] back of the Holy Ghost the same Holy
[28:53] Spirit
[28:54] not to the Holy Spirit the same Holy
[28:56] Spirit
[28:57] a little corny come up here the first
[28:59] thing in the former local senior social
[29:00] prophecy stand up wonderfully rejoice as
[29:03] well they got older withered away and as
[29:05] harm went on is it the same life as in
[29:07] this corner here at the first stalk is
[29:09] it up here to here in Grain
[29:11] insane it just went on
[29:14] towards the church going on to that
[29:16] perfect day when Jesus shall come amen
[29:19] see same Holy Spirit saying saying this
[29:22] different distances
[29:25] the 25th verse is Ezekiel 36 verses 26
[29:29] and 27 that speaks of the three works of
[29:31] grace these verses say he knew her also
[29:34] will I give you and a new spirit will I
[29:36] put within you and I'll take away the
[29:37] Stony heart out of your flesh and I'll
[29:39] give you and heart of Flesh and I'll put
[29:42] my spirit within you and cause you to
[29:44] walk in my statutes and you shall keep
[29:46] my judgments and do them brother Ram
[29:48] cites these verses in 1957 the
[29:51] impersonation of Christianity and these
[29:54] verses teach the three works of Grace
[29:55] new heart new spirit my spirit or God's
[29:59] spirit let's listen to the quote
[30:02] morning
[30:05] [Music]
[30:06] Juliet speaking
[30:10] he says
[30:14] same senses
[30:19] [Music]
[30:21] foreign
[30:26] [Music]
[30:40] [Music]
[30:57] we'll swap passes
[31:00] that is what the church sees beneath the
[31:03] bad things
[31:05] it needs the power of the Living God
[31:09] a reason to gratitude members who
[31:13] Revival needs to revise that what you've
[31:16] already got
[31:18] thank you
[31:21] a 26 verse is acts 1 verse 5. this says
[31:25] for John truly baptized with water but
[31:27] ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[31:29] not many days hence
[31:31] brother Ram uses this verse in the token
[31:33] message September 1st 1963 the baptism
[31:37] of the Holy Ghost is part of the message
[31:39] of the hour let's listen to the quote
[31:45] since
[31:48] and when the blood was shed the token
[31:51] was set down on the day of Pentacles
[31:52] like a Russian Mighty Wind happened
[31:55] the 27th and 28th verses are about
[31:58] Divine Healing in the Rapture Divine
[32:00] Healing is found in Mark 16 verses 15
[32:03] through 18. I'll just read Verse 18 they
[32:06] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[32:07] shall recover
[32:09] then in the same quote brother Brenna
[32:11] mentions the Rapture and the Rapture is
[32:13] found in the first Thessalonians 5
[32:15] verses 15 through 18. I'm not going to
[32:18] read all those verses
[32:19] but I'll read first Thessalonians 4 17
[32:21] and we which are alive and remain shall
[32:24] be caught up together with them in the
[32:25] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[32:27] so shall we ever be with the Lord so
[32:29] let's listen to the quote from 1959 be
[32:31] certain of God and it says the message
[32:33] is Divine Healing and the Rapture let's
[32:35] listen to the quote
[32:41] Paul preached the same message
[32:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost he believed in
[32:47] Divine Healing the power of God the
[32:49] second coming
[32:52] another quote about Divine Healing being
[32:54] the message is from the Ephesian Church
[32:55] age in 1960 and in this quote brother
[32:58] Branham cites Mark 16. let's listen to
[33:01] the quote
[33:03] it begins the church begins at Pentacles
[33:13] the church began at Pentecost with a
[33:16] Pentecostal blessing and was ordained by
[33:19] Jesus Christ to continue on until the
[33:23] last day with the same message and the
[33:25] same blessing work it is amen
[33:27] commission to his church March 16 going
[33:29] to all World preach the gospel these
[33:32] times shall follow them
[33:36] another quote that says Divine Healing
[33:38] is a minor in the message is sir we
[33:40] would see Jesus 1963. let's listen to
[33:43] the quote
[33:46] [Music]
[33:52] the percent of his ministry was on
[33:54] Divine Healing but is the the
[33:57] late brother biles worth many of you
[33:59] knew brother FF Bosworth The Godly
[34:01] saintly man he used to say that
[34:04] Divine Healing is just like uh the bait
[34:07] on the hook you never show the face the
[34:10] hook you're showing the bait and and So
[34:13] Divine Healing is a minor and you can
[34:15] never major on a minor but it
[34:18] so we
[34:21] another quote that says the Rapture is
[34:22] the second coming is from the fourth
[34:24] seal 1963 let's listen to the quote
[34:33] here's another quote that says the
[34:34] Rapture is part of the message but laram
[34:36] said the message is to get the bride
[34:38] ready and prepare for the Rapture from
[34:40] the end time evangelism 1962 let's
[34:43] listen to the quote
[34:45] regardless

[34:51] ready and prepared for the Rapture what
[34:53] can you do according to Montauk courts

[34:57] once delivered to the Saints bring him
[34:58] back to the faith of the fathers of
[35:00] Pentecostal part in the restoration time

[35:11] where brother random sites first
[35:13] Thessalonians 4 15-18 and he said it's
[35:16] the message of God getting the bride
[35:18] ready for the Rapture let's listen to
[35:20] the quote

[36:12] seventh Angel's message let's listen to
[36:15] this quote from the unveiling of God
[36:16] 1964.
[36:21] [Music]
[36:33] all around

[36:58] and again in the Rapture 1965 brother
[37:00] Ram says the Seven Seals are part of he
[37:04] says my message let's listen to the
[37:06] quote
[37:12] and I'm

[37:41] Jesus to the seventh angel the angel of
[37:43] laodicea and brother Ram said the
[37:46] message has come forth of the laodicean
[37:48] age and each age had a messenger and he
[37:51] says we are now living in the laodicean
[37:53] church age this is from Investments
[37:55] 1962. let's listen to the quote
[37:58] we find out
[38:00] that in Revelations 3 at the lady of SIA
[38:04] age which we are now living in to my
[38:06] interpretation of the scripture
[38:09] that when the message has come forth of
[38:11] the lady of SIA H as it did at each age
[38:13] and each age you had a messenger
[38:16] that we come forth in this last day and
[38:19] find out that that church was very rich
[38:25] and they were so
[38:27] disagreeable with him
