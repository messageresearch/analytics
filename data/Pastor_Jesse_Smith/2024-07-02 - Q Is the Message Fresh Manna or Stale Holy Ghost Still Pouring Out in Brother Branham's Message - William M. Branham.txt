TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] a true bride Hallelujah there's going to be one why she's predestinated she won't be denominated because she's predestinated she don't have to worry about some denomination she's already predestinated to take the place greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question since brother Brandon has been off the scene for almost 60 years now does this mean the message has gone stale or should there be a constant flow of fresh Mana how do we balance this this is a wonderful question and I'll give my best answer by God's grace I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ that Christ revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late William brandham God's Prophet to the Gentiles this church age brother random lived from 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character this was a great question and it's based upon a quote this brother sent me in an email brother brandom said we're standing near the Judgment why they're trying to eat Old Mana that fell back Yonder 50 years ago the Pentecostal Church the Holiness Church is trying to over 200 years ago the lutherans about 300 years or more many hundreds of years ago they're trying to eat Old Mana old brother that stuff is stagnated this is from trying to do God a service without being the will of God July 18th morning service 1965 let's go ahead and listen to this quote and then we'll make some comments and I'll give my best understanding of this quote let's listen to the quote we're in the last days we're standing near the Judgment why they're trying to eat Old Mana that fell back down 50 years ago the Pentecostal Church the Holiness Church is trying over 200 years ago the Luthers about 300 or more years ago many hundreds of years ago they're trying to eat Old Mana oh brother that stuff is stagnated it's contaminated it'll it's got It's got I always said wiggle tails in it maggots amen he look kill you eat it friends this is a great quote from brother brandham I'll just briefly say that the point brother brandham is trying to make is that the former movements before his movement have rejected the present truth or the most recent move of God when that present truth came to them for example the Pentecostal Church rejected the true evidence of the Holy Ghost that God showed to brother brandham because the Pentecostals major on tongues as the evidence and we know tongues is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost and as brother Ram said the Lutheran rejected John Wesley's sanctification movement then of course they rejected the gifts of the Spirit that God restored at isua Street around 1906 like to give three reasons why the message has not gone stale for us first the word of God can never go stale the Bible says the word of the Lord endures forever Psalm 119 160 Thy word is true from the beginning and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth forever 1 Peter 1:25 but the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you in John chapter 6 Jesus said my words are spirit and they are life so if the word is life there can only be one type of Life related to God that's eternal life so the word of God that's been delivered to us is eternal life and the word of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost is still going out today we know acts 238 says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost but notice this call this offer is still going out to as many as the Lord Our God shall call last year we had some Services there in Napoleon Ohio and numerous people said they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that proves God is still calling people today to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost acts 239 for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as a lord Our God shall call as long as God is still calling there are opportunities to for people to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost so the word of God is Not stale the word of God is just alive today as it was on the day of Pentecost but again the context brother ran was showing was that each move of God Grieves the Holy Ghost if they don't receive the present truth remember Peter said we must be established in the present truth 2 Peter 1:12 be established in the present truth anyone who studied church history know that the church needed reformed or restored Martin Luther started the Reformation around 1517 ad any honest person can recognize the Reformation what was God doing he was restoring the truth that had been lost throughout the last 1500 years after the day of Pentecost he continued that restoration so more present truth came through John Wesley then more present truth came through austry and William Seymour's move and then the finishing of the mysteries of God was done through God's Prophet William brandham so each move of God had to receive the present truth and so by God's grace we received the present Truth for our day the finished mystery of God that Jesus Christ revealed through his Prophet brother William brandham now a second reason the message has not gone stale after 60 years is because the laty and church age is still going on God is still calling people remember Paul's message for his day had to last the entire 117 years of the Ephesian Church age I believe now we're at 118 years for the leian church age if I'm not mistaken so leod deia has lasted longer than Ephesus but the word of of God is still freshh for our day it's very similar to like Noah he preached probably 120 years maybe less we're not certain how many years he did preach and prepare the ark but his message never got stale he was a preacher of righteousness the preaching of righteousness that he preached never got stale it was always fresh and allowed eight souls to be saved by the grace of God a third reason the message is not stale is because it takes a lifetime to learn from Jesus if you read Philippians 4:11 and 12 Paul said he still learning to be content no matter what state he's in and the Bible said we learn through suffering so we have to suffer years decades an entire lifetime that's in Hebrews 5:8 Jesus learned obedience through the things he suffered and that's true for us especially true for us because we still have a sin nature Jesus did not have a sin nature Jesus had a word nature he was the word made flesh John 1 ver4 and then 2 Timothy 2:12 says if we suffer we will reign with him so it takes a lifetime of suffering in order to develop Godly character that Jesus can use to Reign during the Millennium and also Reign during the future home God is gracious he gives us all things that pertain unto life and godliness 2 Peter 1:3 anything we need to live a good life a Godly life here Jesus promised to give it to us as Peter stated in 2 Peter 1:3 and then he guides us into all truth all the truth that we need to live Godly and holy in this life God gives it to us Jesus promised that in John 16:13 we don't get it all at one time it takes a lifetime of learning a lifetime of suffering so the word of God never goes stale it's constantly giving us life and godliness I'll make a few more points here by God's grace brother Ram said the bride cannot be denominated he said this in spoken words Original Seed she won't be denominated because she's predestinated he said you are not denominated you are Brethren because you can't be denominated you're born sons of God so this shows anyone who has the baptism of the Holy Ghost will not start a denomination a tradition of man Creeds of man they will stay free because they're born again they cannot be deceived the elect cannot be deceived a true rde Hallelujah there's going to be one why she's predestinated she won't be denominated because she's predestinated you don't have to worry about some denomination she's already predestinated take the place it's time to rise ye sons of God in the name of Jesus Christ and rise to a place where you can return in this Jubilee and hear the sound of the trumpet of the Gospel of the word of God ye are Brethren Hall you are not denominated you are Brethren because you can't be denominated you're born sons of God if the slaves want to stay in the wall City let them stay but you are free amen you're free let's go back let's go back to our inheritance let's go back to the beginning back to their led by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit now of course there are deceived preachers who've started their own denominations around the message but the message itself the word itself cannot be denominated these type of men these false teachers have majored on minor doctrines or they've majored on their own false doctrines and they've created their own denominations the traditions of men similar to the seven Thunders movement that came out of New York the Peruan movement the movement that were already in the Millennium or the eighth messenger movement or even recently the tape Church movement press play obey movement that's a man-made denomination I proved that with numerous videos all these false movements have corrupt fruits as well like the tape Church movement they have the love of money and every movement is known by their fruits so all those denominations around the message have corrupt fruits I like what this brother said he said should there be a constant flow and yes there is a constant flow of the Holy Ghost brother Ram said always keep yourself and your family where the spirit of God is pouring out and of course he's talking about a home Church let's listen to that quote so many today you take a a family of people that'll start going church and God will heal the little family he'll bless them and give them the holy spirit in their lives the little children will pray around the table they'll pray before they go to bed mother and father are join hands and pray and as long as they continue like that they'll stay a family but you let them get first thing you know they didn't have nothing an old junk car maybe ride around in or maybe walking finally they'll get a good car A Better Home and the first thing you know then they want to get to what the the world calls a better class to associate with they move into a different neighborhood and in there they find out they become influenced by the wrong influence yes you must always stay where the kingdom of God is and where the glory of God is pouring out stay where you can be spiritually fed day and night amen then the first thing you know separations comes in the home and worldliness and they get lifted up you friends this is true because the fivefold ministry gives us three great purposes of preaching in Ephesians 4 12 the perfecting of the Saints that's the equipping of the Saints the work of the ministry that's the work of the service of the ministry so the fivefold ministry equips us with the tools we need helps us to learn to serve and then edifies the body of Christ builds or grows the body of Christ people get saved but we also grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ and remember this produces numerous things according to Ephesians 4 a Unity of faith and knowledge it brings us us to a perfect man the measure of the stature of Christ it brings us to maturity we're no more children in Doctrine we're not tossed about by every wind of Doctrine and then we get to speak the truth in love then we get to grow up into him in all things and IT Supplies the needs of the body according to Ephesians 48-16 there's also an awesome quote from the church age book brother Bram says we get more information on the same Revelation just like at Jesus first coming the first 4,000 years of human history there was numerous Revelations about the first coming of Jesus Christ it spread all over the Old Testament books the same is true for the second coming of Jesus Christ all these Revelations are spread all over the New Testament books and then a lot of what was written we're getting fresh Revelation today more information on the same Revelation Paul knew it was God who had spoken to him so he said even if I come and try to give a second Revelation try to make one little change in what I gave originally let me be a cursed you see Paul knew that first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation then a second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated that seed had to come through Abraham and then later said it would come by the same Bloodlines in David but it was the same revelation it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it but God's word can't change over the past year you know I've made videos about that how we're getting fresh Revelation my brother Simon has had some wonderful recent Revelations about rebaptism being typed in the Old Testament God gave me a special Revelation showed me the serpent seed is in the Seven Seals it's actually in Revelation CH 5 Jesus being virgin born is able to take the book and loose the Seven Seals that was a beautiful Revelation to me that was fresh Mana to me and of course there are so many more examples I might make a video about that in the future one reason why I love being a message believer is because of all the fresh Mana the fresh Revelation that God pours out to his people in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God this is an excellent question from this brother I appreciate the question hope the answer was sufficient thank God the message of the hour has not gone stale it can never be denominated the bride can never be denominated because the word of God is not bound the Bible says and I'm a living witness that the word of God is constantly revealing itself more information on the same Revelation I'm constantly receiving fresh Mana keeps me strong keeps me encouraged keeps my life clean by the grace of God keeps me Sanctified empowered by the Holy Ghost so let's keep drawing nigh to God and surely he'll keep drawing nigh to us giving us more information on the same revelation a ations if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
