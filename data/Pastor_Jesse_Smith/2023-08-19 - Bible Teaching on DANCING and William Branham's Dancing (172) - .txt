TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] when I come to myself I was out there with that little girl dancing but I guess I did it all right it was I sure felt awful good I had a lot of Victory after that greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to teach about dancing from the Bible and show how God's Prophet brother Branham approved of dancing when it was done for the glory of God here's the outline for the video first we'll Define Dance by the Bible second we'll look at bible verses about dancing and also brother branham's two experiences where he talked about dancing in the spirit third we'll look at four reasons to dance and of course there could be more reasons and fourth we'll look at more points about dancing defining dance in the Hebrew the word dance means to twist to twirl it's number 2342 in the Hebrew Strong's Concordance it's the Hebrew word chol I'm not sure if I'm saying that right but I'll spell it c-h-u-l so we see how the word dance means to spin in a circle and of course we know the Holy Ghost would always keep us under control so this would be controlled spinning controlled twirling as a person rejoices in the Lord Jesus Christ and of course dancing is allowed it's permitted and it's commanded in Psalms 149 verses 1 through 5 and Psalms 150 verses 1 through 6. Psalm 149 verse 3 says let them praise His name in the dance the word let means allow allow them to praise the name of Jehovah in the dance and of course Jehovah the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new the word praise means to boast about one's accomplishments we twirl to rejoice in God's accomplishments and the word name means reputation fame or Glory so we dance or twirl to rejoice in God's accomplishments for his Fame for his glory and of course Jesus name means Jehovah is salvation the self-existing one is salvation is our deliverance Psalm 150 verse 4 says praise him with the timbrel the tambourine and dance praise him with the strained instruments and organs so chapter 149 says allow dance and then chapter 150 commands us to dance it says Praise Him in the dance so when we know we're dancing under leadership of the Holy Ghost we're obeying the command of God and God takes pleasure in our dancing that's from Psalm 149 verse 4. dancing is mentioned in verse 3 and then verse 4 says for the Lord there's Jehovah for Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation so we praise His name in the dance because the Lord takes pleasure in his people in other words the Lord is pleased when his people dance and rejoice about God's accomplishments or Jesus's accomplishments in the second section let's look at the Bible and brother Branham on Dancing friends the Bible uses the word Dance 26 times 21 times in the Old Testament and five times in the New Testament of course there's Unholy dancing like in Exodus 32 verse 19 when Israel was dancing at the time when they made a malted calf of worship while the prophet was away and there's also the Unholy dancing of herodias's daughter on herod's birthday Matthew 14 verse 6. but of course there's also holy dancing or dance that praises the name of the Lord as brothers said the first record of dancing is Exodus 15 verse 20 when Miriam danced and led the women out to dance after Israel passed through the Red Sea and all their enemies and taskmasters were drowned in the Red Sea regarding brother Branham and dancing brother Branham said dancing is Victory brother random also said dancing takes the spirit of Joy the Holy Spirit of Joy brother random said this in the basis of Fellowship 1961 whether rain was talking about William Cowper and he said quote as soon as the inspiration left him when he was in there he wrote the song and when he was up in such a high key where people don't know nothing about it just to sing and shout and dance that's not in that's in the spirit all right but in the spirit of Joy end quote so let's listen to that quote and notice how brother Brandon said singing shouting and dancing is the spirit of Joy so each of us need to receive the Holy Spirit anointing of joy in order to sing shout and dance let's listen to the quote as soon as the inspiration left him when he was in there he wrote the song and when he was up in such a high key or people don't know nothing about just to sing and shout and dance that's not in that's in the spirit all right but the spirit of Joy see but when you raise up into them spheres that you know nothing ah see you can't explain that you just you have to just know it's there and that's all in 1952 I am the resurrection of Life brother said Miriam got in the spirit grabbed up a tambourine and went down the bank dancing if that ain't an old-fashioned Revival I don't know nothing about it Victory so there he described dancing as a sign of Victory let's listen to the quote Spirit grabbed up a tambourine and went out on the bank dancing kind of shocking isn't it dancing beating a family and the daughters of Israel followed her beating cameras and dancing in the that ain't an old-fashioned Revival I don't know nothing about it victory now let's listen to the two times brother Ram said he danced in the spirit here's the first quote it's from Christ 1955 February 21st and in the quote brother Brandon said he went among Full Gospel people heard them clap their hands and said my that's terrible so when brother Brandon first became a Christian he didn't have the victory he didn't have the understanding of dancing and clapping and shouting but God taught him because God is faithful to guide all of us into all truth remember the ram talked about he was preaching a New Year's Eve service at Branham Tabernacle and during an intermission a group of girls saying there's going to be a meeting in the air brother random first didn't like it and said he was sitting in the seat of the scornful but then he thought my where did Dancing ever come from and he thought of Miriam then brother Ram said well I thought the only thing is the matter with me I just ain't got enough Victory Maybe and then he said he started tapping his foot and before he knew it he was out there dancing on the floor near the girl who was dancing he said I guess I did it all right I sure fell awful good I had a lot of Victory after that let's listen to the quote one night I was having a meeting in my Tabernacle and they was having a a New Year's night watch and the Tabernacle now I was teaching on the second coming of Christ some young ladies wanted to beat some a little tin cans and things and they had a washboard with some symbols on it on their fingers they're playing on this washboard I guess you've seen the hook up and one of us go to play the piano and they started playing that song there's going to be a meeting in the air a sweet sweet by and bye uh I was sitting right there in my Tabernacle Baptist Church [Music] why did it have to do that so I'm I waited looked around to people and they looked up at me and I looked around I thought I'm a fundamentalist you couldn't show me that in the Bible nice this is a whole lot of things a lot of us fundamentalists don't know what's in there that's all so I looked around I thought my where did dance never come from so I just let it go like that so I uh isn't that terrible all right you're my Tabernacle this little lady out there just with her eyes closed just dancing around first thing you know up got another one starting I thought oh so then I began to rehearse in my mind at in the Bible they did dance and I thought when they dance what was it dancing was spoke of when did Pharaoh was pursuing Israel and all the enemy was drowning Marion picked up a tambourine began to beat the tambourine and begin to dance and all the daughters of Israel followed her dancing I thought well that is addiction and I read were David when the ark had been away so long and when he returned back why are you so happy you started dancing he had the victory well I thought the only things that matter the eyes they got enough Victory maybe a few minutes something happened now this might shock it when I come to myself I was out there with that little girl dancing [Music] the thing that I thought I wouldn't do I did and when I was I was never on a dance floor in my life but I guess I did it all right it was I sure felt awful good I had a lot of Victory after that so that would be all right and I and I got the music don't you believe God's in music certainly God is in music and he's in art the second time brother Branham said he danced was when he ran around a tree worshiping Jehovah because he saw Jehovah in everything in the wilderness this quote is from the resurrection of Lazarus 1950 he said I was way up in Colorado I'd go 70 miles back by horseback he said he saw the great eye of Jehovah through the crevice and The Rock he said I see you Jehovah looking through the sunset you heard the gray wolf holler he said the wild I love it he said I had set down my rifle I raised up my hand the tears running down my cheeks I begin to sing praises to God I got real happy and I run around and around the tree brother Branham said if somebody would have been out there they'd have thought I was out of the insane institution I didn't care what people thought God was all around and I was worshiping him like David who danced before the ark so brother Brown said happily running around a tree is equal to dancing in the spirit let's listen to the quote about four years ago I grew up in Colorado I go 70 miles back for horseback a little ranch out there where nobody goes way up on top of the grilled cheese just to be alone and all the I think Colorado rain was going through it was all over there they ever dreamed and the sun was setting down through the crevices of the Rocks over there oh my God 70 miles from the civilization I sit down here where there's nothing in nature that pulls out I love their gods in these nature look at the sunset just save once and watch how different things look when you get saved and look at God in his nature right there that's right oh my how wonderful how would I have to go down here and not run around and around and around the tree and shake my hands with somebody insane institution uh my boys I got real happy and I run around around the trees if somebody would have been out there they thought I was out of the insane institution and I was worshiping him on these Pages like David who danced before the Arkham so friends the Bible and brother Branham give us a license to dance in the spirit when the Holy Spirit of Joy comes upon us and the Bible said it gives God pleasure when we rejoice in his accomplishments let's look at four reasons to dance in the scripture and of course there could be more the first reason to dance is because you have been saved you've gone through justification and you've been baptized fully immersed in water calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ of course we get this as an anti-type of when Israel passed through the Red Sea the Bible said they were baptized under Moses that was in First Corinthians chapter 10. of course we know we've been baptized into the Lord Jesus Christ in the New Testament according to Acts 2 38 and so Israel going through the Red Sea and then dancing was a type or foreshadowing of what we should do when we get saved we come out of the world we're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and Jesus forgives all of our past sins just like Israel's past task Masters and their entire sinful past was buried and done away with the Bible says we're buried with Christ and our sins are thrown in the sea of forgetfulness so whenever a genuine Christian gets saved they have a reason to dance and friends that go along with that the entire Gospel of Jesus Christ is like an unto dancing and that's in Matthew 11 verses 16 through 19 Jesus said we have piped unto you and ye have not danced and so Jesus Likens that unto his ministry the gospel is good news it's good because it forgives all of our sins through the blood of Jesus Christ which should make us rejoice in Jesus's accomplishments then Jesus said in verse 17 we have mourn unto you and you have not lamented and he Likens that to John the Baptist ministry in Matthew 11 verse 18. before moving on to reason two brother Branham asked this question he said did you ever get that much Victory and so I want to ask our viewers did you ever get that much Victory to be like Miriam and dance before the Lord the SE is a great question we should all ask ourselves and God will reveal to us in his time and season about the freedom we have to dance and praise the Lord so let's listen to this quote from Believers thou this 1950 brotherhound talks about Israel passing to the Red Sea Miriam had the Victory and he says did you ever get that much so friends I hope you get that much let's listen to the quote he went dancing Hallelujah yes sir she had the victory do you ever get that much all right she was dancing in the spirit Hall with daughters of Israel followed her dancing Moses stood with his hands up and sang in the spirit the second reason to dance is that the word is in its place or position and this comes from second Samuel chapter six of course this is David bringing the ark into its position and the Bible said in second Samuel 6 14 and David danced before the Lord with all his might and David was girded with a linen ephod and then in verse 16 and as the Ark of the Lord came into the city of David McCall Saul's daughter looked through a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord and she despised him in her heart friends notice that David danced with all of his strength he leaped with all of his strength so that gives us the liberty as Christians to leap and dance and rejoice in God's accomplishments especially when we know the word has come into its place and position now in David's day the word got in its position in the city of God Jerusalem and David was rejoicing in that in fact the word hadn't been in the city of David or Jerusalem in about 890 years the last time the word was in that location was when Melchizedek met Abraham and of course God wasn't in the form of the Ark at that time God was in the form of a priest Melchizedek and then even 450 years before David danced when Joshua took the promised land they could never take Jerusalem if you read the book of Joshua it's in Joshua chapter 15 verse 63 the Bible says the children of Judah could not drive them out but the jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day so the presence of God was kept out of the city of God for over 890 years from the time of Abraham meeting Melchizedek all the way up to Joshua and then all the way to David but David became Prophet priest and King just like the Lord Jesus Christ was prophet priest and King and David brought the word into its position the word of God the prince of God in the city of God and it caused him to dance with all of his strength and friends that's what we should feel today the word of God the Holy Ghost the pillar of fire is with the people of God because the mystery of God has been finished according to Revelation 10 verse 7. the hearts of the children have been turned back to the hearts of the apostolic fathers according to Malachi 4 verses 5 and 6. the mysteries of God all 12 mysteries of God have been finished by Brother Branham and brother Branham has given us so many thus say the Lord's statements about prophecy Doctrine and teaching that we can Rejoice like David today the word has found its position the word has found its place in the Heart of Jesus Christ's bride and this is the bride that's all around the world also one more important thing to note about this reason it's second Samuel 6 22 David was talking to McCall and said I will yet be more vile than thus and will be based in my known sight and of the maid service which thou spoken of of them shall I be had in honor notice David says he would dance again so this proves that we can have planned out dance Services dancing does not have to always be spontaneous we can know we're going to dance for the Lord just like we can know we're going to sing a song Special by the holy spirit's leading or just like a preacher knows I know I'm going to preach the word of the Lord this inspired thought at this particular time and also brother Randolph said while David was dancing before the Lord he said God looked down from heaven and was proud of his son and he said David you're a man after my own heart this goes from preparation November 11 1953. let's listen to the quote or he said you don't want to stand here and watch this and round and round and round yes sir I said watch this [Music] amen [Music] a third reason to dance is that God has rebuilt your life and given you a new season to dance this is found in Ecclesiastes 3 verse 4 a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance so notice friends there are seasons of mourning we lose loved ones we go through sickness we go through fiery Trials of our faith but once we come out of those Seasons then it's time to dance and rejoice and boast on Jesus's accomplishments also Jeremiah 31 verses 1 to 4 is a powerful portion of scripture where God promised he would rebuild Israel and then she would dance so again dance is connected to Victory and joy and strength for the joy of the Lord is our strength notice in Jeremiah 31 3 the Lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yea I love thee with an everlasting love therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee and friends God loves the Bride of Jesus Christ as well that is clear according to many scriptures but also Romans 9 25 and 26 the Gentiles are called My People by God and in verse 25 we're called beloved the Bride of Jesus Christ is the Beloved bride of Christ and then we're called Children of the Living God in Romans 9 26 so just as God loved Israel God loves the New Testament bride of Jesus Christ then Jeremiah 31 verse 4 says again I will build thee and thou shalt be Bill o Virgin of Israel Thou shalt again be adorned with thy tablets they're tambourines and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make Merry so friends we all have a promise when we feel like our life is being broken down or destroyed God promises to build us back up so we can dance for him to boast on his accomplishments and his seasons in our lives to bring us victory David also wrote about this new season of Dance in Psalm 30 verses 1 and then 10 through 12. David said thou Has Lifted Me Up in verse 1 and then in verse 10 he said God was his helper and then in verse 11 he said thou is turn me for my morning into dancing verse 12 to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and be not silent so God even gave David scenes of rejoicing seasons of Dancing friends God will turn our season from mourning into dancing the fourth reason to dance is to be like Jesus when he was in the logos form this may be a new thought for some of you but I found this in the scripture in Proverbs chapter 8 verses 22 and 30 the Bible said Jesus in the spirit form of the logos was like the wisdom of God before the foundation of the world and then in verse 30 it says then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him friends this word play in the Hebrew means to play music singing dancing so here we see the pillar of Fire or the logos dancing before the invisible spirit before the foundation of the world and of course brother Branham taught this in questions and answers on Genesis 19 53 and other places he quotes Saint John 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word remember the ram says that word was like a little Halo he said now that's the Son of God the logos now I can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity let's listen to the quote now in Saint John 1 he said in the beginning was the word one of the first and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God unfolding himself down to a human being Now watch how he did it now back there then when this little Halo comes out we can't see nothing yet but just by eyes of just Supernatural we see a Halo standing out that's the Son of God the Lord gods now I can see playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternities and I then in his imaginary makeup he began to think of what things would be and I can hear him say let there be light so friends Jesus was the first non-human dancer he was the first Supernatural Divine dancer so just like shouting religion happened at the foundation of the world according to job dancing started before the foundation of the world the logos danced before the invisible father so where do we learn to dance from our husband the Lord Jesus Christ of course if you have time read that entire passage Proverbs 8 23-30 and if people need more evidence of that you could read Song of Solomon 2 verse 8. and of course this is the shulamite rejoicing over Solomon and Solomon was the son of David he was a pre-figure of the Lord Jesus Christ and here the Bible says Solomon was skipping and that reminds us of brother random skipping or running around the tree in Colorado worshiping Jehovah Song of Solomon 2 verse 8 says the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the Hills so we see skipping is the same as brother random running around a tree it's playing before the Lord It's rejoicing before the Lord as the Bible says so there's two witnesses that Jesus Christ was the first dancer and continues to dance and rejoice and this reminds us of Zephaniah 3 verse 17 the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee is mighty he will save thee he will rejoice over thee with joy so God rejoices over his children with joy he will rest in his love he will Joy over thee with singing so either God is singing or he's having the angel sing over his people and remember he called his bride his beloved now I also have a fifth reason to dance and I'm sorry I only said four at the beginning but it doesn't matter those that are Faithfully listening will get another benefit of having another reason to dance and of course there's more than five when we dance we finally join the rest of Creation in their spinning twirling and dancing this is according to Psalm 148 verse 3 4 5 and also Psalm 65 verse 13. the Bible says praise ye him sun and moon praise him all ye stars of light Praise Him ye heavens of heavens and ye Waters that are above the heavens let them praise the name of the Lord for he commandeth and they were created in Psalm 65 13 the pastors are clothed with flocks The Valleys also are covered over with corn they shout for Joy they also sing so friends the Bible tells us all creation glorifies God all of creation shouts for joy and sing unto the Lord and in particular the moon and the planet spin they spin in their orbits according to the Bible says the planets spin what are they doing they're dancing and glorifying the lord they're declaring the glory of God as the Bible says David said in Psalm 19 verse 1 the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork so when we dance we join the Heavenly hosts the planets in their spiral twirling orbits we shout for Joy just like the mountains The Valleys the flocks the birds the trees we even joined the cherubims in heaven saying holy holy holy fulfilling Jesus prayer let it be done on Earth as it is in heaven and friends this topic could go on and on even in Ezekiel chapter 1 and 2 God looked like he was a wheel as in the middle of a wheel and what does a wheel do it turns and Spins and Twirls and that lines up with how Jesus played and danced before the father in Proverbs chapter 8 and Solomon skipped upon the hills according to Song of Solomon chapter 2 verse 8. for the fourth section we'll talk about more points or truths about dancing first Jesus will always stand up for you when you Worship in the Holy Spirit in Matthew 21 14-16 the children were crying out Hosanna to the son of David and Jesus said out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise the Bible said the children were crying out so notice Jesus didn't tell the children to be quiet Jesus said they've got to cry out if they don't cry out even the stones will cry out so Jesus stood up for worshipers we also see a parallel passage of that in Luke 19 35-40. then moving on to Mark 14 verses 3 through 10 Mary lazarus's sister anointed him and Judas complained and Jesus said let her alone so Jesus told Satan in Judas is scared leave Mary alone Jesus has always and will always protect the oil and the wine and so we should do what we can to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ and of course we have that promise from the third seal Revelation chapter 6 The Voice in the midst of the beast in verse 6 says see thou hurt not the oil and the wine to the Lord Jesus Christ will always protect the oil the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the wine the stimulation or joy of the Holy Ghost and we also know oil wine is the healing prescription as seen in Jesus parable of the Good Samaritan that's found in Luke chapter 10 verse 34 we get the understanding when religion and legalism or lasciviousness leaves worshipers half dead like in the parable the oil wine is the only healing prescription the baptism of the Holy Ghost the joy of stimulation of Revelation and where are you going to find that you're going to find that in the message of the hour the present truth as Peter says you're going to find it as the Bible said in Matthew 17 11 Elias will restore all things brother branham's anointing of the spirit of Elijah upon him will restore all things brother Adam's Ministry restored the Bible the Gospel of Jesus Christ second point is that Jesus specializes in changing seasons or turning the page in our lives there's so many examples Mary Magdalene Zacchaeus Lazarus but the Bible said he would do this in Isaiah 61 verses 1 through 3 the Bible said Jesus preached Good Tidings the Brokenhearted would be bound up and healed he would Proclaim Liberty to the captives that's what we have today Liberty in Christ Jesus opening of the prison to them that are bound and going down to verse 3 he gives us Beauty for our ashes oil of joy for our mourning a garma of praise for the spirit of heaviness so we cast down depression we cast down doubt discouragement and we receive the anointing of Joys brother Branham said the Bible calls it the Garment of Praise so he prays we shout we dance we stomp we clap we glorify Jesus Christ we brag on Jesus Christ's accomplishments third point is that clapping and shouting is triumph that's in Psalms 47 verses 1 and 2 oh clap your hands all you people shout unto God with the voice of Triumph third point is that God can only use dancing when we have both dancing and agonizing in prayer so again it goes back to that scripture from Ecclesiastes we have to have both seasons in our lives we have to have seasons of mourning and then seasons of dancing and brother Brown clearly teaches this in 1958 the sermon is called the evidence of the Resurrection brother said I believe in every bit of that dancing and shouting but if we have that and don't have that agonizing weeping broke up Spirit God can never use that of course this ties in with Ezekiel 9 verse 4 God only marks or seals with the Holy Ghost them who sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the city let's listen to the quote from 1958. our hearts are too cold cold we become in we become interested if if we can say if we can shout I believe in it if we can speak with tongues I believe in it I believe in every bit of that but if we have that and don't have that agonizing weeping broke up serious God can never use it foreign things are good but we got to have the other to go with it we've left off the main thing I'm gone first secondarily and you can never major on a minor the fourth point is that sin stops the dance if a person's not in the season of mourning this is found in Lamentations chapter 5 verses 14 through 16. the Bible said the elders ceased the young men cease from their music The Joy sees the dance was turned into mourning the crown has fallen why we have sinned the Bible says so many people in message churches or any church the reason they don't dance is because they're letting sin reign in their lives and they haven't confessed their sin they're living with complexes and so if we want to see the dance restored in our life and it's God's season for us to dance but we're living in sin all we need to do is go confess our sins and God will restore our joy the spirit of joy to dance for Jesus Christ in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing you know at the end of 2022 the Lord started dealing with me on the dance topic and it has just revolutionized My Worship now in our church and other churches I preach at will have dance Services we'll dance and praise the Lord and it's been a wonderful time of glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ bragging on Jesus's accomplishments rejoicing in what he has done for us and of course there's so much more to this topic I can't cover it I think I preached over eight or nine sermons on this series but I want to get this video out I hope it'd be a blessing to God's people so if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please email me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart foreign
