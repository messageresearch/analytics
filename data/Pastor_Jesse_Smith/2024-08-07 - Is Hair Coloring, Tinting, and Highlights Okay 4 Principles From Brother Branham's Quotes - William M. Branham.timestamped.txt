[0:03] I can't say for women about that putting
[0:06] color in their hair I have no scripture
[0:08] about against that I can only stay with
[0:09] the scripture are you ready and to you
[0:12] on the tape here it is sisters if there
[0:15] is a questioning it don't do it
[0:19] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:21] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:23] this vide is to answer a viewer's
[0:25] question about is it wrong to color
[0:28] one's hair this is a great question
[0:30] about modesty and Holiness that's a
[0:33] topic I've written a book about by God's
[0:35] grace and this topic in particular I did
[0:37] not mentioned in my 2019 book restoring
[0:39] Christian modesty so I want to make this
[0:42] video here by God's grace as a help to
[0:44] others hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor
[0:46] bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan
[0:48] Ohio USA and I defend the original
[0:50] Gospel of Jesus Christ that the Lord
[0:53] Jesus revealed to St Paul then had to
[0:55] restore through Martin Luther John
[0:57] Wesley and the late Prophet William
[0:58] brandham 190 9 to 1965 also defend
[1:02] brother Ram's Godly Christian character
[1:04] so as a brief answer to the question
[1:07] there are cases where it's okay for a
[1:09] woman or man to color their hair I would
[1:12] think in most cases men wouldn't want to
[1:14] color their hair but I guess there could
[1:16] be some cases a man might want to I
[1:19] can't think of one but I just want to be
[1:21] humble and leave that open but the most
[1:24] cases it seems there are women who want
[1:25] to color their hair so it seems the case
[1:28] where it would be okay for woman to
[1:30] color her hair is if her hair got gray
[1:33] due to age and she wanted to color it
[1:36] back to its original color as far as I
[1:38] know that would be the only reason a
[1:40] woman would want to color her hair and
[1:42] before we get started on a personal note
[1:44] uh my wife and daughters do not color
[1:46] their hair my wife still has most of her
[1:48] original hair color and she doesn't feel
[1:50] led to color it to hide the very few
[1:53] gray hairs she does have and all my
[1:56] daughters are quite young I would not
[1:58] let them put highlights in their hair to
[2:00] color their hair that's my personal
[2:03] preference I do not believe highlights
[2:05] are natural in most cases so in my
[2:08] family highlights would not be natural
[2:09] so I would not let my young teenage or
[2:11] adult daughters put highlights in their
[2:14] hair and I'd also recommend my wife
[2:16] would not put highlights in her hair of
[2:18] course she's never asked that she's
[2:20] never desired that I'm just letting you
[2:22] know my standards as a pastor and a
[2:24] minister of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus
[2:26] Christ so let's look at the question
[2:28] here from the brother says please what
[2:30] is your understanding of hair coloring
[2:32] based on the bible message and history
[2:35] thank you in advance for your feedback
[2:37] Shalom so the Bible regarding the Bible
[2:40] and hair coloring I cannot find any
[2:42] direct mentions of hair coloring in the
[2:45] Bible I could be wrong so if I'm missing
[2:47] something please let me know we're
[2:48] simply told from the scripture in the
[2:50] New Testament that women should not cut
[2:52] their hair that's 1 Corinthians 11 1-16
[2:55] I have two videos on this topic so I
[2:58] will leave links to them in the
[2:59] description
[3:00] and also the Bible tells us women should
[3:02] not pay for very expensive hairstyles I
[3:05] have a video on that as well these are
[3:07] the scriptures from Paul and Peter that
[3:10] talk about broided hair if you watch the
[3:13] video you'll see there's nothing wrong
[3:14] with braiding hair those scriptures
[3:16] refer to expensive hairstyles just like
[3:19] it refers to expensive jewelry so those
[3:22] are the two main principles we have
[3:24] about women's hair women's hair should
[3:26] not be cut and women should not pay
[3:29] large amounts some money for worldly
[3:31] hairstyles now regarding history I only
[3:33] did a very quick search because really
[3:36] the Bible is what matters most to me and
[3:38] I'm on limited amounts of time here I
[3:40] only found one site it said the
[3:43] Egyptians were the first to color their
[3:44] hair and notice it was Egyptians they
[3:47] were the enemies of God in most cases
[3:49] God's people the Hebrews were not the
[3:51] ones that were coloring their hair and
[3:53] according to this website that was about
[3:55] 1500 BC the website also says around 300
[3:59] BC
[4:00] in the Roman Empire prostitutes were
[4:02] required to have different hair colors
[4:04] to indicate their profession some
[4:07] Warriors apparently colored their hair
[4:09] in order to intimidate opponents on the
[4:10] battlefield around 300 BC then it seems
[4:14] nothing really changed until the 1800s
[4:16] when hair dye was discovered apparently
[4:19] by a chemist named William Perkin and
[4:21] then it was in the 20th century when
[4:23] modern hair coloring originated
[4:25] Hollywood took it and ran with it of
[4:27] course they encouraged bob hair as well
[4:30] next we want to look at quotes from
[4:32] God's Prophet brother William brandham
[4:34] uh William brandham said in a summary he
[4:36] said there's no Bible that forbids hair
[4:39] coloring and he offered his advice to
[4:43] those who followed his bible-based
[4:45] teachings I compiled four principles to
[4:47] keep in mind so I find these four
[4:50] principles in brother ROM's quotes and I
[4:52] may be missing some quotes as well so
[4:54] please let me know if I missed any
[4:55] quotes about hair coloring the first
[4:57] principle is from the first quote the
[5:00] first quote is from questions and
[5:01] answers part one 1964 and in this quote
[5:04] we're actually going to get the first
[5:05] two principles the first principle is
[5:07] freedom brother random said women want
[5:09] to look pretty it's their nature so
[5:12] there's freedom in this area but there's
[5:14] also responsibility so that's the first
[5:16] point women do have freedom to color
[5:19] their hair as long as it's for the right
[5:21] reasons uh but then the second Point
[5:24] brother brand makes is he defines real
[5:26] Beauty and real beauty is found in 1
[5:28] Peter 3: 3-6 it's the meek quiet and
[5:32] gentle spirit so I'm going to read those
[5:33] scriptures now before I play the quote
[5:36] whose adorning let it not be the outward
[5:38] adorning of plating the hair so plating
[5:40] the hair was the expensive hairstyle and
[5:42] of wearing of gold that's where we see
[5:44] expensive jewelry or a putting on
[5:47] apparel all women must put on apparel so
[5:49] this must refer to expensive
[5:52] apparel Let It Be The Hidden man of the
[5:54] heart and that which is not corruptible
[5:56] even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[5:58] Spirit which is in the sight of God
[5:59] great
[6:00] price so now we'll play the quote it's
[6:03] quite a long quote again brother Rams
[6:05] asked directly about this questions
[6:08] answers part one let's listen to the
[6:09] quote if it is wrong for me to is it
[6:13] wrong for me to run
[6:16] a a beauty shop I'm a beautician and
[6:20] don't believe in Christians cutting her
[6:23] hair but I cut others and I guess it's t
[6:29] NT tent that means the color I guess is
[6:31] it color also sister
[6:35] dear I would I wouldn't know what to
[6:38] tell you
[6:41] listen I can't say for women about that
[6:45] putting color in their hair I have no
[6:47] scripture against that I can only stay
[6:49] with the scripture see the scripture
[6:51] don't say for them not to do that the
[6:53] scripture says she must have long hair
[6:55] that's right and after that I don't know
[6:57] where to go see I I don't know nothing
[6:59] about that now a little Minister that's
[7:01] present year somewhere I know a dear
[7:03] friend of mine we was talking together
[7:04] the other day at the blueb when we was
[7:06] having dinner he said my wife's kind of
[7:08] shamed to come before you very saintly
[7:10] Godly little woman and she's a a pretty
[7:12] little lady grandmother and but she's a
[7:16] nice clean real my wife's just crazy
[7:19] about this woman and um and uh I think
[7:22] she's a real real woman she I don't know
[7:25] if she's sitting here I guess she is I
[7:27] think her husband's here and he said to
[7:29] me said she let her hair grow out
[7:32] actually she heard you preach and she
[7:34] seemed it was right but said she's been
[7:36] using some color in her hair and she's
[7:39] trying her best get all that color grow
[7:41] out before she comes around where you
[7:44] are I look sister dear I highly respect
[7:48] that I have an honor for a woman that'll
[7:51] do that for some woman just to come up
[7:53] and do her hair anyway or spit on your
[7:55] feet and walk around irant no respects
[7:58] at all remember Jesus said what you do
[8:00] to these you've done it to me am see and
[8:03] I respect that you and God will bless
[8:05] you for that but sister about the hair
[8:07] color or something like that I I don't
[8:10] know I I can't back that up with the
[8:12] scripture so I that's just up to you you
[8:13] see you if you want to do it that's
[8:15] perfectly all right with me as far as I
[8:17] know a church has no such Customs if you
[8:20] want anything that's not in this Bible
[8:21] Well you just that's up to you you see
[8:23] but I just give you my advice you see as
[8:26] far as I would know you know it's just
[8:28] the nature of a woman to want to look
[8:29] pretty she's supposed to be that way you
[8:31] know in every life there is the male is
[8:34] the prettiest but the human race take
[8:36] any bird cow take a bunch of cattle
[8:39] which is the prettiest like old crumpled
[8:40] horn cow or the big bull take a deer
[8:44] which is the Little D or the buck take a
[8:48] bunch of elk which is the prettiest the
[8:49] male or female moose whatever you want
[8:52] to do take it take it in the bird taking
[8:54] the chicken the rooster or the hen take
[8:56] it the bird the little big pretty
[8:58] cardinal are the Little Speckled H sat
[9:00] on their nest and raise their eggs see
[9:02] everything in the whole race always the
[9:07] the male is the prettiest but the female
[9:10] to the human why she callused the fall
[9:13] amen Satan chose her right there and
[9:15] beauty is of the devil
[9:17] am Satan was the most beautiful angel he
[9:20] was a cheran that overshadowed look how
[9:23] the difference women is getting out of
[9:24] what they used to be how many remembers
[9:26] Pearl reading of pearl Bryant let's see
[9:28] your hand some of you older people sure
[9:30] see supposed to be the most beautiful
[9:31] woman in America any little teenage
[9:33] snickle Fritz on the street would be
[9:35] twice as pretty as she
[9:36] now why that's just exactly what the
[9:39] Bible said when the sons of God saw the
[9:41] daughters of man were fair that is a
[9:43] bunch of Renegades that sent that flood
[9:45] upon the Earth that God destroyed the
[9:46] whole human race see so exactly and
[9:49] today everything's paced upon Hollywood
[9:51] and and beauty and things like that when
[9:54] beauty is the secret thing of the heart
[9:56] not the outward appearance let them
[9:58] Adorn themselves not with outward
[9:59] appearance but inward of Meek Gentle
[10:01] Spirit that's that's a Christian so now
[10:04] on your question sister I don't know
[10:06] just what to tell you next let's look at
[10:08] a second quote and in the second quote
[10:10] we get the third principle the third
[10:12] principle is avoid hair coloring if
[10:15] there's any question or doubt about it
[10:18] and then brother gives us a warning
[10:19] scripture it's Isaiah 3:16 through 26
[10:23] this is the scripture about the hottie
[10:24] Daughters of Zion and their 21 external
[10:27] accessories that they wore in in their
[10:29] pride and remember in Isaiah 4 God
[10:31] judged them and God took away all their
[10:34] outward beauty of course it was
[10:36] so-called Beauty it wasn't the true
[10:37] beauty that God gives a woman to be
[10:39] modest and holy so now we have three
[10:42] principles women do have some freedom
[10:44] but it's with responsibility they must
[10:47] remember what true beauty is a Meek and
[10:49] quiet spirit and not outward adorning
[10:51] and third if there's any question avoid
[10:53] it so let's listen to this quote it's
[10:55] from questions answers part 2 64 let's
[10:58] listen to the quote
[11:00] I believe this morning the question come
[11:01] up about um uh uh painting the hair you
[11:04] know with a with a color now I I if I I
[11:08] can't say anything about that I don't
[11:10] know but I I I have no scripture to say
[11:12] not to to color your hair that's that's
[11:15] all you women you like to look nice and
[11:17] you should look nice and brother bram's
[11:19] not against you children you're my
[11:21] children I I I love you and I I don't
[11:23] want to be balling you out I I wouldn't
[11:26] do it for nothing I'm only trying to
[11:28] help you but now look let me just ask
[11:31] let me say this and answer to that
[11:32] question are you ready and to you on the
[11:35] tape here it is sisters if there is a
[11:38] question in it don't do
[11:43] it but if you're if you're filled with
[11:45] God's spirit and led to go do it as long
[11:48] as it don't interfere with the scripture
[11:50] and don't interfere with a question
[11:51] you're perfectly satisfied that that's
[11:54] the will of the Lord then go ahead and
[11:55] do it see because there's no scripture
[11:58] to say no see about it I don't don't say
[12:00] nothing like that in the Bible I know
[12:02] Isaiah 5 I believe it just talk about
[12:04] women how they would wear changeable
[12:06] apparel and everything like that but
[12:08] that was pride and stuff hold on if you
[12:10] do that for Pride then it's wrong see
[12:14] examine your heart before God if there's
[12:16] no scripture for in the way the spirit
[12:18] leads you you go ahead and do it but now
[12:20] when it comes to whether you should have
[12:22] long hair or short hair you have long
[12:25] hair that's Survival here's my third and
[12:27] final quote I'm going to use and we get
[12:28] the four principle the fourth principle
[12:31] is use human color hair and you want to
[12:34] avoid non-human colors like blue pink
[12:37] purple and I'm using a quote from
[12:39] brother Brandon where brother br's
[12:40] talking about how makeup uses a lot of
[12:43] inhuman colors or nonhuman colors
[12:46] because those colors are not human which
[12:48] means they're beastly they're against
[12:50] God's creative nature they're against
[12:53] God's created pattern so this quote's
[12:55] from 1961 remember Ram's talking about
[12:58] makeup but let's apply this to hair as
[13:00] well we know God is against all makeup
[13:03] there's four or five verses that condemn
[13:06] makeup wearing and also prideful looks
[13:09] but here we have this principle that
[13:11] makeup wearing is not humanlike it's not
[13:14] natural it's unnatural so let's apply
[13:17] that to the hair color that's why I say
[13:19] I would not allow my family and also
[13:21] teach our church our sisters not to put
[13:23] highlights in their hair cuz that's
[13:25] usually not a natural thing let's listen
[13:27] to the quote Be not Afraid night
[13:30] 1861 and I thought I wonder if that's
[13:33] some kind of a manicure they're putting
[13:34] on their eyes you know uh and they make
[13:38] and then I I asked somebody else and
[13:39] they said yes that's that's um uh
[13:42] something um that they put on their face
[13:44] and I when I come home I told my wife
[13:46] about it I said honey that they didn't
[13:48] even look human see it it looked like
[13:50] something had come off of some other
[13:52] planet or fell out of the Marg somewhere
[13:55] or something I said I never seen
[13:56] something and today we was up there and
[13:58] there said a lady like that and and mey
[14:01] looked around my wife and she said is
[14:02] that it Bill I said that's it she said
[14:05] boy wouldn't that scare you in the night
[14:06] time I said he give you he give you
[14:08] chills and fever sure
[14:12] would in closing friends hope this video
[14:15] was a help by the grace of God this is
[14:17] an excellent question dealing with
[14:19] modesty Holiness and outward appearance
[14:21] as a message Pastor I don't get out very
[14:23] much I don't get many invitations which
[14:25] is totally fine I'm God gave me an
[14:27] invitation to be the pastor at our
[14:28] church here in aaran so I'm very
[14:29] thankful for that but I have had a few
[14:32] interactions about this topic the only
[14:34] sister I ever saw purposely put
[14:36] highlights in her hair for fashion her
[14:39] family became very worldly and all of
[14:41] her children are very worldly uh her
[14:44] daughters crossdress they wear pants
[14:47] they cut their hair they wear really
[14:49] light makeup and try to hide it from
[14:51] people and even that woman's husband the
[14:53] woman who has the highlights he told me
[14:56] he could handle having a TV in his house
[14:58] and he would watch college football
[14:59] games and who knows what else he watched
[15:01] but I just look at the crup fruits of
[15:03] this woman with her highlights in her
[15:06] hair and then the crup fruits from her
[15:08] family and Jesus said a tree is known by
[15:11] its fruits so friends as Christians we
[15:13] just want to stay as far away from sin
[15:15] and Temptation and worldly Temptations
[15:18] as possible we're thankful God's Prophet
[15:20] gave us his best advice we have those
[15:23] four principles let's use them by the
[15:25] grace of God if I miss something let me
[15:27] know but let's continue to Adorn our
[15:29] elves with that which is of a great
[15:31] price in the sight of God the humility
[15:33] of the Holy Spirit the meek and quiet
[15:36] spirit for our sisters and a humble
[15:38] prayerful gentle loving Spirit from our
[15:42] brothers if you have any questions
[15:44] concerns or testimonies about this video
[15:45] please contact
[15:47] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[15:50] the desire of your heart
