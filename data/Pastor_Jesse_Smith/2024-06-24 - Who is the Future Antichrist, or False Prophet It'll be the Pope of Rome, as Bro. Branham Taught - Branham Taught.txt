TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] then the Bible didn't call him a pope the Bible called him a false prophet greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to explain who the future Antichrist will be I believe it'll be the pope of Rome and so by God's grace I'll make a short video here to explain why and if you like more reading on this topic you can look into my book The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed I'm not a book salesman so if you can't afford it please email me and I'll email you a free pdf of the book friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor Bri of Christ Fellowship here in akaran Ohio USA for the past 18 years and I defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ that Christ revealed to St Paul and now has restored through the late Prophet brother William brandham 1909 to 1965 before getting into the issue of the Pope I wrote an entire chapter on mystery Babylon in my 12 New Testament Mysteries book there are 11 proofs that the Roman Catholic Church is the mother Harlot mystery Babylon of Revelation 17 and 18 and many of the church fathers believed that the Roman Catholic Church was mystery Babylon including tertullian irenius and Jerome along with recent reformers Martin Luther John Knox John Calvin William Tindale and John Wickliffe to name a few here's the 11 proofs I'm just going to read the titles of them so you're aware of these 11 proofs and of course I have videos on the mother harlot as well proof one the Catholic church is a woman proof two the Catholic church is the modern-day Babylon proof number three the Catholic church is a mother of harlots like Jezebel proof number four the Catholic Church sits on many Waters proof number five the Catholic Church sits on seven mountains or Hills proof number six the Catholic church is a harlot or to Christ proof number seven the Catholic Church uses the scarlet and purple apparel proof number eight the Catholic church is wealthy proof number nine the Catholic church is drunken with the blood of the Saints proof number 10 the Catholic Church's headquarters is a great City and the 11th proof is the Catholic Church rides the Beast the spirit of ancient Rome so the first point I want to make is that there are many antichrists out in the world they are actually false teachers and this has been going on the last 2,000 years 1 John 2 vers 18 says little children it is the last time and as you have heard that the Antichrist shall come even now there are many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time so I read the scripture to explain that you might hear preachers say there are antichrists and that's acurate any false teacher who's supporting the false religious system is an antichrist but there's coming one final Antichrist he'll be revealed after the Rapture at the beginning of the seven-year Great Tribulation period and his reign will be only about 3 and 1/2 years I believe it's quite simple to prove that the pope is the future Antichrist because the woman of Revelation 17 the mother Harlot rides the Beast and we've already proved that Roman Catholic Church is the woman that rides the Beast so if the Roman Catholic Church rides the beast power then the leader of the Roman Catholic Church would be the false prophet or Antichrist that's according to Revelation 17:3 mystery Babylon is to sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns so the woman Roman Catholic Church rides the beast power and God's Prophet The Late William brandom did say the pope would be the future Antichrist and also said he's the same person as the false prophet that the Book of Revelation speaks of the false prophet is mentioned in Revelation 163 Revelation 19:20 and revelation 20:10 a prophet is one who speaks for God so who is the false prophet who claims to speak for God but teaches the false Doctrine and is closely related to Rome it can be none other than the pope of Rome let's listen to the third seal where God's Prophet William brandham said the Bible doesn't call the Antichrist a pope it calls him the false prophet let's listen to the quote and they crowned a man a Superman see crowned him and then the Bible didn't call him a pope the Bible called him a false prophet why yeah of course he was be a false prophet by his Antichrist spirit that taught Antichrist against the original word because if you taught against the original word it was Antichrist and the word is God see Christ here comes the Pope the head to the woman the false Antichrist to the false bride of science which our world had our American Eastern World here Western world has led the world in science comes to her in his scientific church and now the whole Protestant is bound to him on 13 Now by God's grace let's go through this section I wrote in my book it's on pages 597 through 599 the Catholic catechism teaches the pope has the authority of Christ and has an infallibility in virtue of his office when he teaches on matters of faith and morals so notice the Catholic Church elevates the pope to infallibility at times yet we know the pope and his church are filled with false doctrines recently we've seen Pope Francis in the last few years accept homosexuality and even bless homosexual marriages so of course the pope of Rome cannot be infallible if he's blessing an abominable act also the pope is assigned the title Holy Father that's blasphemy Jesus said there's only one Holy Father in John 17:1 and Jesus said call no man father on this Earth Jesus said that in Matthew 23:9 and yet billions of people call the pope Holy Father only the heavenly father has the title of Holy Father now first portion of the scripture we want to look at is second thessalonians: 3-13 here's a detailed description of the Pope and his Blasphemous actions in verse two he's called the man of sin in verse two he's also called the son of predition or destruction very similar to Judas es scariot then he's called that Wicked in verse 8 so the pope is a sinful destructive and wicked man now in verse four he will sit in Jerusalem's future rebuilt Temple opposing and exalting himself above all that's called God or that's worshiped so that he sits in the temple of God showing himself that he is God so one day the future Pope will sit in the Jewish temp Temple the Third Temple a newly rebuilt Temple and make himself God next in verse 9 the Bible said his coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders so the future Antichrist will have lying wonders they won't be true wonders they'll be lying wonders and he'll have satanic power to do signs and lying wonders and this matches Revelation 19:20 which says the false prophet Prophet is able to do Miracles now it seems like most of these signs Miracles and wonders will be lying Miracles and wonders but we know Hellbound preachers can even do genuine Miracles but if they break the word of God they're a false anointed one that's according to Matthew 7: 21- 23 the workers of iniquity said Lord do we not cast out Devils speak in tongues prophesy in your name and Jesus said I never knew you Jesus never denied that they did genuine miracles denied they knew Christ because they were workers of iniquity they did not live a holy life and then in verses 10-2 the pope deceives with unrighteousness and lies allowing his followers to live in the pleasures of sin and of course Catholicism does that Catholicism lets people commit sins live in sins as long as they confess their sins to their local priest they do not preach a sanctification message they don't even preach really a justification message most of them Catholics are known for teaching Faith plus works of course that's why God anointed Martin Luther to say we're justified by faith alone and then the final portion of that scripture 2 Thessalonians 2: 10- 13 those who overcome him the Antichrist will be Believers and lovers of the truth and Jesus said in John 17:17 Thy word is truth so the word of God is truth True Believers will love the word of God and not a man-made religion not not the Roman Catholic Church religion I want to go through four more portions of scripture from Daniel about the pope Antichrist to kind of get an idea what he's going to do around the time of the Rapture right after the Rapture during the tribulation of course there might be a carryover or overlap before the rapture we might see the pope taking his place and here's what he's going to do on the world stage in Daniel 8:23 through2 it's a compound prophecy it was fulfilled first by Antiochus i 4 from 175 to 164 BC but has a future fulfillment in the future false prophet Pope for he shall stand up against the prince of princes Jesus Christ so the pope will oppose the true Jesus Christ of the word of God and he will have political policy to cause Financial craft to prosper so the pope Antichrist will be involved in politics and will make Financial craft to prosper so manufacturing and he will magnify himself in his heart all the nations will support the false prophet Pope because of his successful political and Financial Solutions and we can see how that's forming right now especially with inflation and with all the destruction to the financial system that Co has caused then in Daniel 9:27 it states that he the Antichrist Pope will make a onewe or 7-year Covenant with many but will break it after 3 and 1/2 years in the midst of the week the pope will cause Orthodox Jews to cease offering their animal sacrifices and oblations in their newly rebuilt Temple this 3 and 1/2 year period in the Great Tribulation is the same period that Israel's two anointed Witnesses or prophets are prophesying and manifesting God's power according to Revelation 11: 2 and 3 the third portion of scripture is Daniel 11: 21 through 31 it's another compound prophecy fulfilled by Antiochus IV but has a future fulfillment in the Antichrist Pope the pope is called a vow person and he'll make a peaceful League or Covenant with Israel through deceit and flatteries his deceitful heart though will be against the Holy Covenant of course that's the Old Testament Ten Commandments and the law of Moses and the pope will pollute the newly built Israeli Sanctuary by taking away the daily sacrifice of course that's in the middle of the week as well after three and a half years the final portion of scripture is Daniel 11: 36-45 Daniel 11 connects to 2 Thessalonians 2:4 as the pope will speak against God exalting and magnifying himself above everyone and everything the Antichrist Pope will enter into the Glorious land or Jerusalem and try to set up his own Tabernacle in the glorious holy mountain but God will let him swiftly come to his end though and None Shall help him there was an interesting Uh current event recently where the pope attended a G7 Summit right around June 14th 2024 and during this meeting President Joe Biden embraced Pope Francis with a forehead to forehead hug here's a picture of it notice this is the first pope to ever attend a G7 Gathering so we can see the pope starting to get more involved in worldwide politics apparently the pope was there to discuss issues about artificial intelligence energy and the Africa Mediterranean region then according to this article uh Joe Biden met with the Pope in individual meeting it says they met privately with Francis later Friday in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God a young believer asked me about this topic last week so I thought I'd make a video on it by the grace of God I already had the notes there in the 2021 book the Bible is totally clear that the false prophet or Antichrist will be the pope it's undeniable so we thank the Lord that God has shown us the revelation of who the mother Harlot is the Roman Catholic Church we're so thankful the Bible said in Revelation 18:4 come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and plagues so the Lord Jesus Christ is still calling his people out of the Roman Catholic church and all denominations that join in with the Roman Catholic Church the daughter churches of the mother Harlot this topic reminds me of Luke 21:36 watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that should come to pass and to stand before the son of man a few verses earlier Jesus said behold the Fig Tree and all the trees so the fig trees Israel the other trees are all the nations when they now shoot forth you see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand so when we see the pope going to a worldwide Summit for the first time ever and we see Israel having defend themselves and all the anger of all the nations coming against Israel we know these trees are putting forth their branches they're coming to maturity and so we know the Rapture is near by the grace of God perhaps In Our Lifetime maybe the next one we don't know no man knows the day or the hour but we can do what Jesus said take heed to ourselves do not be overcharged with with surfeiting drunkenness cares of this life so that day come upon you unawares Jesus is here to help us watch and pray always so we'll keep watching for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and praying Always by the grace of God if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
