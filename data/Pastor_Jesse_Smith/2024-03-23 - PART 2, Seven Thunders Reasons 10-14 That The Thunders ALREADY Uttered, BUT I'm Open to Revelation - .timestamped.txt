[0:02] but the Bible said and he promised in
[0:05] the last days he would send the spirit
[0:07] of Elijah and would call the people the
[0:10] children of God back to the original
[0:13] Faith like it was in the beginning of
[0:14] the world now remember it's thus sayeth
[0:16] the Lord it'll come to pass in this day
[0:20] I charge you in Christ's name to do this
[0:22] you preachers I charge you to read the
[0:25] newspapers or take consideration
[0:27] anywhere you want to go and see if it
[0:29] isn't on the Earth right now
[0:31] now greetings friends in the matchless
[0:33] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:36] purpose of this video is to do a part
[0:38] two on the seven Thunders and by God's
[0:40] grace I'll give reasons 10 through 14 on
[0:44] why I believe the Thunders have already
[0:46] uttered but again I'll humbly say that
[0:48] I'm open to God changing my mind if he
[0:51] wants to reveal them in the future by
[0:54] God's grace hi friends I'm Pastor Jesse
[0:57] Smith I pastored bride of Christ
[0:59] Fellowship here in in akan Ohio for
[1:00] nearly 18 years June will be our 18th
[1:03] anniversary by God's grace and I defend
[1:06] the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ
[1:08] revealed to his genuine Prophet The Late
[1:10] William brandham 1909 to 1965 and also
[1:14] defend brother bram's Godly Christian
[1:16] character so I'll briefly review the
[1:19] nine reasons I put on part one and then
[1:22] I'll get into reasons 10 through 14
[1:25] reason number one brother brandham said
[1:27] seven times after the seventh s sermon
[1:30] that the Thunders or seals were already
[1:32] fulfilled revealed or
[1:34] history number two brother brandom never
[1:36] mentioned the seventh seal Vision with
[1:38] the threefolds after preaching the
[1:40] seventh seal which makes me think it was
[1:42] already fulfilled and he knew the
[1:44] Thunders had already uttered the
[1:46] revelations of the Seven
[1:47] Seals reason number three when asked
[1:50] directly about the seven thunders in
[1:52] questions and answers part 4 1964
[1:55] brother brandham said they were already
[1:57] revealed reason number four brother
[1:59] brandham put it in print in his church
[2:01] age book released in December 1965 that
[2:05] the Thunders were the revelations
[2:06] contained in the Seven Seals and of
[2:09] course there's many quotes after the
[2:10] Seven Seals where brother Ram said the
[2:12] seals were revealed and made known and
[2:15] brother brandom would have read over the
[2:17] church age book a couple times as he
[2:19] said his daughter said perhaps five
[2:21] times the fifth reason was if the
[2:24] Thunders aren't revealed then our hearts
[2:26] are not turned to the apostolic fathers
[2:29] but of course I believe my heart and
[2:32] many Believers of the end time message
[2:34] have hearts turned back to the apostolic
[2:37] fathers Paul Peter James John and so
[2:39] forth the six reason is that Revelation
[2:42] 6 ver1 says a thunder sounded at the
[2:45] first seal which I believe was one of
[2:47] those seven Thunders that were later
[2:50] revealed on the earth in Revelation 10:
[2:53] 3 and four so there are not eight
[2:56] Thunders reason number seven there are
[2:59] no thus say the Lord's statements from
[3:00] Brother brandham on a future opening of
[3:03] the Seven Seals and seven Thunders and
[3:06] then I never heard brother Bram
[3:08] mentioned this Vision about the seventh
[3:10] seal anymore for the rest of his life
[3:13] which was nearly 32 months after he saw
[3:15] the vision of the seventh seal and the
[3:18] eighth reason if the Thunders are still
[3:20] Mysteries then the mysteries of
[3:22] Revelation 10:7 are not fulfilled and
[3:24] Revelation 10:7 isn't history but
[3:27] brother Ram said Revelation 101:7 was
[3:30] history it was God's prophecy fulfilled
[3:34] and then the ninth reason was the order
[3:35] of Revelation 10 seems to fit what has
[3:38] happened in reality since
[3:40] 1965 when brother Brandon went off the
[3:42] scene to the present time now let's move
[3:45] on to the new reasons I haven't released
[3:46] yet here reason number 10 if someone
[3:50] else comes to turn our hearts back to
[3:52] the fathers by giving us the revelation
[3:54] of the Thunders then brother brandom's
[3:57] thus sayi the Lord statement that he was
[3:59] the Fulfillment of Malachi 4:5 and6 was
[4:02] wrong last year I felt like the Lord
[4:04] reminded me of this thus sayi the Lord's
[4:06] statement from Brother brandham when a
[4:08] new person a false prophet raised up and
[4:11] said he was going to take brother
[4:13] brandom's mantle and turn our hearts
[4:15] back to the apostolic fathers but then
[4:17] the Holy Spirit reminded me of brother
[4:18] brandom's statement in the anointed ones
[4:20] the end time
[4:22] 1965 brother brandom quotes Malachi 4:5
[4:25] and6 about turning our hearts back to
[4:27] the original Faith he said it's God's
[4:29] promise it's it's thus sayith the Lord
[4:31] and then he said now remember it's thus
[4:32] sayith the Lord it'll come to pass in
[4:34] this day brother random said examine
[4:36] every cult and Clan every man every
[4:38] church every newspaper and he said see
[4:41] if it isn't on the Earth right now so
[4:44] there we have a thus sayi the Lord
[4:45] Malachi 45 and6 was fulfilled in brother
[4:47] R's ministry right there in July of 1965
[4:52] let's listen to the quote but the Bible
[4:55] said and he promised in the last days he
[4:58] would send the fear of Elijah and would
[5:01] call the people the children of God back
[5:04] to the original Faith like it was in the
[5:06] beginning of the word that word would
[5:09] confirm the son of man in the last days
[5:11] the same as it was of Sodom yesterday
[5:13] today and forever he promised to do it
[5:16] yes it's God's promisees thus sayith the
[5:20] Lord
[5:22] notice they did the same thing just as
[5:25] Moses did until God got enough of
[5:28] it amen now remember it's thus sayeth
[5:32] the Lord it'll come to pass in this day
[5:36] now search over the world take every
[5:39] cult take every Clan take every man take
[5:42] every church I charge you in Christ name
[5:45] to do this you
[5:47] preachers I charge you to read the
[5:50] newspapers or take consideration
[5:52] anywhere you want to go and see if it
[5:55] isn't on the Earth right
[5:56] [Applause]
[5:58] now now that we've heard the quote we
[6:00] also have to consider the next step we
[6:02] have to look at what brother random had
[6:04] written in the church age book and in
[6:06] this statement we get the two things
[6:08] that the seventh Church age messenger
[6:10] was supposed to do and notice there's a
[6:12] chronological order of the effects of
[6:15] the uttering of the seven
[6:17] Thunders so let's read the quote you're
[6:19] very familiar with this one probably now
[6:21] this messenger Malachi 4 in Revelation
[6:23] 107 is going to do two things one
[6:25] according to Malachi 4 he will turn the
[6:27] hearts of the children to the fathers
[6:29] now pause right there remember brother
[6:31] bam said in July of 65 it came to pass
[6:34] in his day with thus sayith the Lord
[6:37] number two he will reveal the mysteries
[6:39] of the seven thunders in Revelation 10
[6:41] which are the revelations contained in
[6:43] the Seven Seals it will be these
[6:45] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[6:47] literally turn the hearts of the
[6:49] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[6:51] exactly
[6:53] so so I'm going to put on the screen now
[6:55] you can see it here I'll just call it
[6:56] the orderly effect of the seven Thunders
[6:59] based upon that
[7:00] quote so the first step is the
[7:03] revelation of the seven
[7:04] Thunders that's the first thing that has
[7:06] to
[7:07] happen that's according to that
[7:09] statement he will reveal the mystery of
[7:11] the seven Thunders which are the
[7:13] revelations contained in the Seven
[7:15] Seals so now look at the second step
[7:18] after the Thunders utter then we have
[7:21] the Second Step then we have the
[7:23] revelation of the Seven
[7:24] Seals then the third step after that is
[7:27] literally our hearts are turned back to
[7:30] the Pentecostal
[7:31] fathers so again before moving on to
[7:33] reason number 11 if someone else comes
[7:36] to turn our hearts back to the apostolic
[7:39] fathers according to brother Ram's
[7:41] statement they would have to reveal the
[7:43] seven Thunders be a prophet as brother
[7:45] Ram said in the church age book chapter
[7:47] 9 the latan church age and then those
[7:49] Thunders would give us the revelation of
[7:51] the Seven Seals and then our hearts
[7:52] would finally be turned back to the
[7:55] Pentecostal fathers this is why I
[7:57] believe God used brother Braham to utter
[7:59] what the seven Thunders said which were
[8:01] the revelations of the Seven Seals and
[8:03] then when we received that we literally
[8:05] had our hearts turned back to the
[8:07] apostolic fathers reason number 11 if
[8:11] someone came to reveal the seven
[8:12] Thunders for rapturing faith that would
[8:15] be the last sign to us before the
[8:18] Rapture and yet that would go against
[8:20] the six thus sayi the Lord's statements
[8:22] from Brother Bram that said his ministry
[8:25] was the last sign to the Gentiles before
[8:28] the rapture
[8:30] and friends I wrote about this last sign
[8:31] from Brother brandham on pages 728
[8:34] through 733 in my 2021 book and I have
[8:37] all six quotes from Brother brandham
[8:39] about his ministry being the last sign
[8:41] before the Rapture in the book so again
[8:44] if someone came in the future to reveal
[8:47] the seven Thunders that would literally
[8:49] give us rapturing faith and then that
[8:50] rapturing Faith would spread from the
[8:52] real Holy Ghost filled churches to all
[8:54] the other ones it would seem that would
[8:56] be the last sign before the Rapture
[8:58] because people would would say oh
[8:59] there's a Revival the seven Thunders
[9:01] have been revealed and then that Revival
[9:04] would lead to a literal body change
[9:06] where their bodies would be swallowed up
[9:09] death would be swallowed up in life and
[9:11] that would be a great sign for the
[9:13] Believers that the Rapture was
[9:16] on moving on to reason number 12
[9:19] according to the church age book the
[9:20] Thunders must come through a prophet so
[9:23] if brother Bram did not reveal the
[9:25] Thunders then the entire bride worldwide
[9:28] would have to recognize this other new
[9:30] prophet and he must be undeniably the
[9:33] prophet with the thus sayith the Lord
[9:36] Revelation on the seven Thunders that
[9:38] comes out of the Bible it have to come
[9:40] straight out of the Bible and brother R
[9:43] said it must come to a prophet on page
[9:45] 324 the church age book chapter 9 it
[9:49] will take a prophet to get the
[9:50] Revelation because God has no other way
[9:52] of bringing out his scripture
[9:53] Revelations except by a prophet cuz he
[9:56] said it was in the end time period that
[9:58] the seven Thunders of Jesus came forth
[10:00] Revelation 10 3 and
[10:03] 4 so just humbly friends I don't see how
[10:06] this could happen this seems very
[10:08] unlikely that a man will rise up and be
[10:11] a Vindicated Prophet so this man would
[10:13] probably likely already have to have
[10:16] visions that have been fulfilled
[10:18] throughout his life because a person is
[10:20] born with a prophetic gift so they would
[10:22] be seeing visions all their lives and
[10:25] they would have a thus sayith the Lord
[10:27] maybe multiple thus sayith the Lords
[10:29] future prophecies that had already come
[10:31] to pass so everybody would know this
[10:32] person was a prophet and then after that
[10:35] then they would give us thus sayith the
[10:36] Lord with the revelation of the seven
[10:39] Thunders which would be rapturing Faith
[10:42] so to me this seems unlikely it seems
[10:44] more biblical that Revelation 10 1:7 was
[10:47] brother R's Ministry and it was
[10:49] fulfilled from 1963 to
[10:52] 1965 and then today it's God's will to
[10:54] fulfill Revelation 10: 8-1 that it's the
[10:58] Bride of Jesus Christ Christ that is
[11:00] supposed to take the revelation of the
[11:02] Seven Seals to the Gentile Nations and
[11:05] then when that last soul is filled with
[11:06] the Holy Ghost then the Rapture can
[11:08] occur but of course we know there's
[11:10] numerous things happening at that time
[11:12] brother Ram tells us the United States
[11:14] government will have to change laws in
[11:16] order to persecute and kill Christians
[11:18] but Jesus Will rescue the Christians
[11:21] before the Antichrist system can lay
[11:23] down the mark of the beast reason number
[11:25] 13 since the revelation of the Thunders
[11:28] is is the revelation of the Seven Seals
[11:32] then the Seven Seals have not yet been
[11:34] revealed if the Thunders have not
[11:38] uttered so basically if we're looking
[11:41] for the seven Thunders to utter then we
[11:43] don't even know what the Seven Seals
[11:45] were we don't know the revelation of the
[11:48] Seven Seals but again there's many
[11:49] quotes from brother brandham that tell
[11:51] us he believed the Seven Seals were
[11:53] opened and again this is based upon that
[11:55] quote from page 327 in the church age
[11:58] book chapter 9
[11:59] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[12:01] seven thunders in Revelation 10 which
[12:03] are the revelations contained in the
[12:06] Seven Seals so it's clear brother Ram
[12:08] showed the Thunders have to utter first
[12:11] and then you have the revelation of the
[12:12] Seven Seals and then the hearts get
[12:14] literally turn back to the apostolic
[12:17] fathers and the 14th and final reason I
[12:20] believe the Thunders have already
[12:21] uttered is that brother Ram never
[12:23] mentioned the seven thunders in the
[12:25] Rapture sermon from December 4th
[12:28] 1965 I searched for lots of words in
[12:31] this sermon but I found that he only
[12:33] mentioned the preview of the Bride
[12:34] vision and not the vision of the seventh
[12:37] seal so again this makes me think that
[12:39] he realized the seventh seal Vision was
[12:42] already fulfilled and then also friends
[12:45] there was five times in this sermon the
[12:47] Rapture sermon that brother brandom said
[12:49] the Seven Seals were either unfolded
[12:51] made known twice he said they were
[12:54] revealed and then once he said they were
[12:56] opened and again if brother Ram said the
[12:58] Seven Seals were unfolded made known
[13:00] revealed or opened then that makes me
[13:03] believe the seven Thunders already
[13:04] uttered their voices because that's what
[13:07] the Thunders were about the revelations
[13:09] the opening of the seals the unfolding
[13:11] of the Seven Seals i' like to go through
[13:14] those five quotes from The Rapture
[13:15] sermon here just briefly in the first
[13:18] quote he said the great mystery of the
[13:20] book was to be unfolded by the seventh
[13:23] Angel's message let's listen to the
[13:24] quote now here also a type of the
[13:29] seventh Church Ages which in Revelations
[13:31] 10:7 that the great mystery of the book
[13:35] was to be
[13:36] unfolded by the seventh Angel's message
[13:41] now in the second quote he said when the
[13:43] seventh angel begins to sound the
[13:45] mystery of God was to be made known
[13:47] right there the seals let's listen to
[13:49] the quote now watch now in the seventh
[13:53] Church age when the seventh angel begins
[13:56] to sound the mysteries of God was to be
[13:58] made know right there the seals that the
[14:01] reformers had been had had time Luther
[14:04] didn't live long enough neither did
[14:06] Wesley the ages didn't live long them
[14:08] reformers they had their message of that
[14:10] day and the people grasp it and
[14:12] denominated it in the third quote he
[14:14] said begins to sound his message that
[14:17] the mysteries of all the things that's
[14:19] been twisted up down through the age
[14:21] would be revealed in that time so we see
[14:24] the mystery of all the things that's
[14:25] been twisted up would be revealed by the
[14:27] seventh messenger let's listen to of the
[14:29] quote now we're living in the seventh
[14:32] Church age and when the Bible said that
[14:35] this seventh Church age when the
[14:37] messenger of the seventh Church age
[14:39] begins to sound his message that the
[14:41] mysteries of all the things that's been
[14:43] twisted up down through the age would be
[14:44] revealed in that time here we see it the
[14:48] son of man coming among his people and
[14:50] doing just exactly confirming his
[14:52] message as he said he would do here we
[14:55] find it in this last St in the next
[14:57] quote he said all these Mysteries would
[14:59] be revealed by a prophet he said it
[15:01] would take direct Prophet from God to
[15:03] reveal it let's listen to the quote now
[15:07] remember the message is promised and
[15:10] when all these Mysteries has been all so
[15:12] bundled up by a bunch of
[15:15] Ecclesiastes it will take a a direct
[15:18] profit from God to reveal it and that's
[15:21] exactly what he promised to do see and
[15:24] then finally brother brandham said
[15:26] brother Bram said and them Seven Seals
[15:28] open those Mysteries and showing those
[15:31] things is what's happened I didn't know
[15:33] it so again past tense Seven Seals
[15:36] opened let's listen to the quote and my
[15:39] message all the time knowing back there
[15:41] under healing and so forth like that was
[15:43] just to catch the people's attention
[15:45] knowing the message would come and here
[15:47] it is in them Seven Seals open those
[15:50] Mysteries and showing those things is
[15:51] what's happened I didn't know it but
[15:54] this man standing right here now was
[15:56] standing right with me when youall heard
[15:57] me preach that sermon sir what time is
[15:59] it that morning exactly where it said it
[16:01] would be there stood Seven Angels
[16:03] standing right there from the heaven and
[16:05] as they went up and that Whirlwind Tak
[16:07] them up there we stand in watching went
[16:08] away science tucked the picture of all
[16:10] the way across the Nations down into
[16:12] Mexico in closing friends I hope this
[16:15] video was a help again by the grace of
[16:17] God this is part two in the series then
[16:19] Lord willing I'll do a third part and in
[16:21] the third part I hope to show all the
[16:23] reasons that the seven Thunders could be
[16:25] revealed in the future but again I lean
[16:27] towards this understanding that the
[16:29] seven Thunders were already uttered they
[16:31] already uttered the revelations of the
[16:33] Seven Seals but I want to be humble I
[16:35] want to be open to further Revelation by
[16:38] the Holy Ghost because of brother rah's
[16:39] vision and then because of all these
[16:42] large amounts of quotes that connect
[16:44] rapturing Faith with the revelation of
[16:46] the seven Thunders friends let's
[16:48] continue to seek the Lord Jesus Christ
[16:51] seek his face hunger and thirst after
[16:53] righteousness and surely we be
[16:54] continually filled with the Holy Ghost
[16:56] in Our Minds when we're born again we're
[16:58] filled one time in the soul we're sealed
[17:00] to the day of our Redemption so we thank
[17:02] God for that we thank God for the
[17:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost and surely
[17:05] he'll come to us we'll see Jesus At The
[17:08] Rapture because he comes to all those
[17:10] that love is appearing as 2 Timothy 4:8
[17:13] says and not to me only but unto all
[17:16] them also that love his appearing so he
[17:19] will come to us for the Rapture he'll
[17:22] change our bodies because we love his
[17:24] appearing at the
[17:25] Rapture if you have any questions
[17:27] concerns or testimonies about this video
[17:29] please contact
[17:31] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[17:34] the desire of your
[17:38] heart
