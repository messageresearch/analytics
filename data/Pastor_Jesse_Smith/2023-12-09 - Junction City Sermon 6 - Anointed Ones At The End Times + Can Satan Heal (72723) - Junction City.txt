TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I like to have a copy just in case I make a mistake or something I can go back and uh fix it by the grace of the Lord so uh ra would you raise your hand if you listen to the anointed ones of the end time is anybody uh listen to that sermon is that the one that you talked about last time you were here I don't know brother no I don't think I can't remember which one I probably talked about two men last time probably mentioned too many scriptures right to listen to the one you had said it was really good and I forget what it was called but it was really good about 3 hours two 2 and a half hours or three hours okay was it God in hiding himself in Simplicity I would say something about appointed times or I'm not sure okay that's all right toer my phone that's all right what's the name EXC me what's the name of that again the anointed ones at the end times make of yes sir absolutely brother yes this is one you I just listened to it two or three times these last two weeks it's just a tremendous message tremendous um and just as a just real quick testimony when I first became a Christian I didn't know the message of brother brandom I was just going to a mega church there in akan I think they have Presbyterian roots and I read a scripture and I was like how is this possible and I just for two years I just scratched my head I don't understand this but then I heard about brother R's Ministry I went and listened to the anointed ones the end time and it dissolved all my doubts Amen in other words it just it just gave me complete understanding of this topic amen so this topic is tremendous it means so much to me because it proved to me brother brandham it was one of the proofs brother brandham was a prophet because the Bible said God will do nothing except he Reveals His secrets to his servants the prophets and also this this topic the anointed ones of the end time it ties him perfectly with the mystery of iniquity because the mystery of iniquity is the Antichrist spirit Paul said the the mystery of iniquity was already working in his day and it's going to go all the way up it's the trail of the serpent it goes all the way up you know uh to to the mark of the beast and then we know it even rides down into Armageddon right uh the the Antichrist will ride down into Armageddon and be defeated Hallelujah but uh it's a great it's a great subject because it's called a mystery in the Bible the mystery of iniquity iniquity means lawlessness so if is a worker of iniquity they don't honor God's law and church we're not under the law of Moses we're under the law of the spirit the Bible says but it's still a law the holy spirit is still a law praise God if we keep God's law we're blessed Hallelujah if we break God's law we got to repent Hallelujah and God will guide us into all truth amen now yes this was August 25th 1965 um as I Was preparing you know we after we got done there in Columbus I got to go to a little place and study a little bit and I was just overwhelmed with all the scriptures so um you know I'll be happy to take some questions afterwards as well if there's questions so uh the first verse that brother Brandon preaches and I I didn't get all the verses but I went like through the first half of this sermon it's a three-hour sermon and I tried to get uh the first verses that brother Ram uses uh because it kind of he calls it it lays the foundation it goes back to the Old Testament brings it all the way through the old test the first verse though was Matthew 24:4 and notice these are red letter words right Jesus Christ says uh there will be false christs and false prophets and they will show great signs and wonders this is interesting right it's an interesting thought a false Christ a false prophet is going to have signs and wonders yeah amen how can the devil's people have signs and wonders well there's two there's two ideas is with that right and we'll see that here as we go false I'll just say it now just to kind of uh make it plain because I'll be repeating it false prophets can have uh two types of signs and wonders they can have legitimate true Miracles but they can also have lying signs and wonders as well amen they can have both yeah and the secret to that is when they want to when when they want to do something genuine they can sacrifice and approach God and they can get under the anointing of God and then God can use their gifts in their life amen but the sad part is when they don't want to serve God then they'll go back into iniquity and they'll seek demonic spirits and demonic Powers okay and the clear example is balum we'll get to that in a little bit Hallelujah so it's it's that might be might be shocking but that's true that's what the Bible teaches that's what brother Ram teaches in this message okay so brother man he first points out notice they're false Christ he didn't say false Jesus is there's nobody there's very few people that come around and say well I'm a I'm a Jesus yeah because they know oh you don't have the scars in your hands and you know we know you're not a false Jesus right we know you're not a Jesus you don't have scars in your feet right there's no way you're back you know you're back in a physical body now because the Bible says you're in a glorified body right but it's false Christ which means they they're false prophets but they have the genuine anointing on them because Christ means the anointed one right the word Christ means the anointed so they're false anointed ones their soul is a false soul in other words their soul is The Bad Seed Jesus calls it right but they have the genuine anointing on them at times and you'll see what what I'm saying as brother ad gives beautiful simple examples from nature okay so just I'll try to let me try to get there there so uh these false christs are false prophets but yet they have the true anointing on them at times but not all the time now we are people that we want the true anointing on us all the time hallelujah amen we we we want to walk with the Holy Ghost anointing on us at all times how many want that by God's grace that's what I want Hallelujah I know I'm going to battle I know I'm going to sin every day you some point but I want to cast down that that that that uh battle I want to confess my sins I want to get right back in walking in the light as Christ is in the light praise God Amen thank you sir God bless you buddy love you now and notice they'll do great signs and wonders now like I said they can be either true genuine signs and wonders but they're also going to do deceiving signs and wonders okay now the next scripture brother R goes to is Matthew 5 verse 44 so let's go to Matthew 544 by God's grace and Malachi can you read that for me son Matthew [Music] 5 Matthew 5:44 and 45 we can whenever you're ready buddy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that Cur of father okay that last statement brother R brings it up he said notice God sends his reain on the just the the good and the unjust the bad amen right so both the good and the bad get God's Reign naturally right we I'm sure irin knows farmers who are sinners that don't love God right do they get rain from God yes they do but does Irving get rain does John get rain yes they do they're The Good Seed amen they're God's children but so do The Bad Seed they get rain as well and uh I'm not going to take the time to go there but there's many verses that call God's spirit rain or water Jesus said the Holy Ghost be like living water yeah amen um James 5:7 says the Holy Ghost will be like a latter rain a former and latter rain the Bible says the Holy Ghost is like rain and brings times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord remember when we had that drought a couple months ago in June or was it May and June it didn't rain for 28 days boy when it when it started raining John we walked out on our deck and I said this is so refreshing but then it became too hard and I had to go back in the house but when it first started rain it was such a refreshing praise God I was like oh I haven't felt this for a month praise God well that's what God said his spirit is like when we're singing How Great Thou Art I just started crying and raising my hands I got refreshed amen amen that's God's spirit amen it's refreshing us praise God it's making it feel new again it's making it feel making us feel in love with God hallelujah we might have battled all day we might have been working hard all day sweating out all day chasing the kids around all day praise God uh and it just been a busy day Hallelujah but when God's presence come it makes you feel fresh again hallelujah amen brings your joy back amen brings that smile back to your face amen makes you uh Cry tears of joy it refreshes because God Likens it unto rain praise God amen amen and brother Ram says notice the rain the Holy Ghost falls on true teachers and he says false teachers on true prophets and false prophets that's what brother Ram uses now next verse he uses is Hebrews chapter 6 go to verse four please Hebrews 6 verse4 and just listening the sermon again like I said prove to me William brandham was a genuine prophet of God because like the Bible said I've never heard a man talk like this I was raised in church I heard all kinds of Pentecostal preachers go through our church we had Revival sometimes we had Revival services from Sunday to Sunday people would speak in tongu shout and prophesy which was great but I never heard a man preach like brother Bram Hallelujah who opened the word of God and then of course brother Bram had greater miracles than I saw you know uh and so it just proved to me never a man talk like this man that's what they said about Jesus right and brother R was anointed with the spirit of Jesus so are you so so am I praise God hallelujah uh Hebrews 6:4 now here's the illustration I kind of already used it you know with our farmer Brethren here verse four says for it's impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again under repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves as Son of God aresh and put him to an open Shain that's quite a scripture but this is speaking of people like judas's scariot yeah and we won't have time to get there but in Matthew chapter 10 Judas is sent out with all the preachers and he's given power to cast out Devils raise the dead heal the sick I mean and the Bible ible said they all come back 12 come back and 70 come back to Jesus saying wow we the devils are subject to us we have power over demons and Jesus said don't Rejoice that you have power over demons but Rejoice that your names are in heaven Hall thank God hallelujah thank God that's what we should Rejoice over and Judas was one of those he was right there just rejoicing oh wow we can do Miracles we can cast out Devils but Jesus says be careful Rejoice because you're saved amen amen Rejoice because God loves you Hallelujah and you love God amen amen amen and even you Mal I we talking about this and even on the night uh Judas betrayed Jesus Jesus said one of you is going to betray me and not everybody turned to look at Judas and said I knew it was you the whole time the Bible said they looked at themselves yeah amen there was nothing about really Judas that separated him from the others they all they all fell short of God's glory didn't they amen just like all of us but the Bible tells us in another chapter I believe it's John 12 you don't have to read it but but Judas had a thief's heart and he didn't really care about the poor so see how people can come to church where they can hide things in their lives yeah you would have thought wow he's The Treasure of the church he's done Miracles he's one of Jesus's Inner Circle yet he was hiding his thief's heart the whole time now Church think think how easy this would have been brother John all he had to do is go up to Jesus and say Jesus can you pray for me for my my my sinful thieving heart that's all he had to do he just had to go to his Pastor I mean that's that's all he had to do but he wouldn't do it but see you and I we do that praise God Amen we go to Jesus in prayer and say God take this ly out of my heart or take this lust out of my heart take this greed take this anger take this bitterness out of my heart what does God do he forgives you he takes it out of your heart praise God hallelujah that's why we know we're not judases amen because we confess our sins Hallelujah and we overcome the wicked one praise God but Judas just let that stay in him the whole time yet he tasted of the powers of God now verse 7 now here's the illustration again like our farmer Brethren know all about for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh of upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which bear of thorns and Briars is rejected is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned okay so he gives us the illustration you have herbs like uh what are some herb names like uh clangula is that an herb something like my wife could list off about 300 of them but I can I can't even LIF off list off one of them basil basil there you go so the the rain falls on the basil but also falls on all those awful Thorns that got out there right and that's what that's what the illustration we get from nature right God's spirit falls on Believers but also falls on make Believers amen like Judas he was a make believer he tried to believe for a while but then he sold it out amen okay so so the same thing is true in the spiritual the Holy Ghost will fall on genuine Holy Ghost filled Saints but it also falls on mate Believers yeah Hallelujah brother man says how he said what's the way to know he said the same way it's always been the same way to know who stays with the word of God Amen who passes the word test Hallelujah who believes the word who loves the word who will obey the word who will repent and obey the word of God hallelujah amen it's always the word test brother amen it's always the word text Hallelujah now the next verse brother B goes oh next he tells two stories uh the first one when he first became in contact with the Pentecostal people he went up to Michigan in Mishawaka and he saw two men one would speak in an unknown tongue and then the next one would prophesy and it' be exactly right I'm sorry interpret and it would tell secrets of people's hearts and brother Ram said this is like heaven right he said I he said I'm in amongst I'm amongst Angels but then he saw a vision of that second man with interpretation and he saw he was married I'm sorry he was living with a blackheaded woman but he was married to a blond-headed woman and then brother Ram said am I amongst Devils right so he said he went up to the first man he said he would and he discerned his Spirit he said that's a real servant of God and then he went up to the other man and he said he said brother I see you're living with a second wife you shouldn't do that and the man look what he did instead of repenting and saying brother R will you pray for me that I'll go back to my wife or how maybe stay away from his wife I'm not sure how he'd handle that but the point is instead of repenting the brother R said he just walked out of the meeting and left that's right he wouldn't repent he wouldn't pass the word test praise God Amen brother R said that's that's a thorn that man was a thorn the other man was a genuine herb praise God basil amen hallelujah let's be basil today praise God hallelujah I like mint though that's that's right that's my wife get some mint boy smells good I like walking by that part of the the garden there Hallelujah the Bible says our worship is like a sweet smelling savior to God when we pray when we sing God says he go that's a wonderful worship I like that that's my mint down there that's my basil that's my wheat down there Hallelujah and then he tells another story he had questions even about this afterwards so he went to his cave where he went to pray it was in Green's Mill he says and uh he says then he a vision broke out and he saw a man dressed in all white sewing seeds in his field but right behind him came a man in Black and he was sewing his seeds and brother Ram says he said then they started growing up and brother Ram said uh then the clouds came by and it started raining and the good seed of the man in white shouted praise the Lord for the rain praise the Lord for the rain and then brother ra said the bad seeds from the man in Black started getting the rain they said praise the Lord for the the rain praise the Lord for the rain praise God and brother bam said see and this is a Bible reference this is the story of the parable of the swer yeah Jesus was the man in white sewing good seed Satan come around and sowed the tears but both Lov the presence of God yeah come on brother both rejoy the both enjoyed the blessings of God praise God you don't think those Sinners and those false prophets and those mega churches you don't think they like to get healed too you don't think they like to shout and cry worship they like it too but what's different is their seed their seed is different because their seed produces the wrong fruits it produces lying adultery right it produces cheating but our seed produces Holiness amen obedience patience longsuffering meekness godliness goodness and love hallelujah amen that's what it produces in our lives amen so we can both shout praise the Lord tonight hallelujah amen as as we feel the spirit of God refresh us we can both shout hallelujah praise the Lord amen beautiful M Matthew 13 3-23 we're not going to read it but if you're writing it down plus I got the audio recording going it's been 18 minutes so far so we're making good time by God's grace and again church when I heard brother preach this it just tied the whole Bible together never had did a man ever preached like this before hallelujah amen it it was so beautiful so tremendous brother Bram said I'm quoting brother Bram he said quote the same holy spirit that anoints the church that gives them desire to save Souls that gives them power to perform Miracles it falls on the unjust the same as the just the very same spirit amen end quote The Same Spirit I was raised in Domination so when I come to the message I felt the presence of God before and it was familiar but what was different was the what we did after the anointing we started I started Living the word praise God that was different praise God cuz in when I was raised Pentecostal we go home we'd watch bad movies watch Dirty TV shows you know we some of the people would drink alcohol and get semi- drunk or whatever but they got the same anointing see but when we come to Christ when we come to the full word of God it produces different fruits hallelujah it's not corrupt fruits but Incorruptible fruits Hallelujah that's what the word of God produces in our lives amen hallelujah now go to Matthew 7:21 this and this was the verse I sat I still remember to this day I was sitting in my college dorm room as a freshman in akan and I was scratching my head what does this mean my roommate was out partying he'd bring in girls in the night time and I'd be like oh Micah don't bring in these girls he bring them in anyway I slept on the top bunk he and his girlfriend were sometimes sleep in the bottom bun I remember numerous times I'd read through this and they'd come in and I'd be sitting there right right there reading my Bible and I'd highlight this and what does this mean what does Matthew 7:21-23 mean again red letter words Matthew 7:21 brother bam quotes this not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter in the Kingdom of Heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven amen amen so it's not just enough to say Lord Lord you got to say that and you then you got to do what God says hallelujah amen you have to do the will of God and what's the will of God the word of God praise God yes amen amen verse 20 no I'm sorry 22 now look at this many not a few Church look this is amazing to me many people at the white Throne judgment many will say to Jesus in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works so prophecy cast out devils and wonderful works there's at least three types of Ministries there right and many wonderful works then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity remember iniquity is lawlessness now Jesus never said no you didn't cast out Devils no you didn't prophesy he just said I never knew you yeah so that means this is a group of people just like Judas a scariot that they would they would they would sacrifice they would pray at times they would worship God God's spirit would fall they would prophesy they would cast out Devils do many wonderful works but then after the service they go get some cocaine which preachers have done like Benny Hinn they got videos of it online you can see it and he's the one asking h i the Lord tells me there's seven people out there that got to give me $110,000 tonight where do you find that where do you see Jesus doing that amen but yet when he walks out he comes out under singing and praying and the anoint you can feel a strong anointing there and maybe somebody gets healed I don't know i' I've never seen if anybody got healed or not in his meetings but the point is Jesus says he never argues with him and says no you didn't so he's he's acknowledging you did Miracles but then after the service what' you do then yeah come on Amen right they went and lived a lawless life like I don't have to obey those Holy Spirit God God blesses me when I'm there I struggle like everybody else but that's not what that's not that's not that's not the right approach no we don't the Bible said should we uh should we live longer in sin that Grace May abound God forbid God Amen we should die to our sins amen but see they use the gospel they get the anointing and usually it's a money-making scheme like BM yeah and then after service what do they do they take that money they buy a Rolls-Royce or they buy a mansion or a private jet right and they live lives of iniquity okay so this is the verse I'm sitting there I can still I can still see my little cubicle in my dorm room and I was just highlight like what does that mean I was reading NIV Bible too you know missing scriptures and everything and then months later I heard brother brandom I'm like oh now it makes sense oh praise God hallelujah thank God that we can do the will of God hallelujah that's what see that's what's important it's crying out Lord Lord but it's also doing what God says to do praise God Amen and not living a life of lawlessness but living a life of obedience to the law of the holy spirit amen amen does that help by God's grace do this does this help tonight amen amen okay praise God I you know as I've been praying and preaching all summer I'm I'm in my heart I'm saying God what would be most beneficial for this young group of of Christians here and I know for me this was crucial in my walk with God so I want to make sure I give it to you by God's grace if I had more time I wouldn't have printed out papers but I I had appointment this morning with my doctor I got good good blood numbers and everything again for another year by God's grace I'm happy about that I had to drive right away to Columbus I didn't have time to work on my my computer this morning had to preach last night we getting home till like 11:00 so it just been a busy last few days but I I like to give you print outs but I'm sorry I don't have one okay next brother bam says um then he tells another story anybody work with grafting of trees or anything does anybody do that here grafting anybody any any Vineyard workers here seen it already but I don't have experience right I don't either Mali have you seen any is there grafting at the orchard where you work okay there's a little bit of grafting okay well brother said he had a friend out in Arizona who had a citrus farm and he had orange trees but he walked by the orange Tre he said I saw lemons on them and tangerines and tangelos and then oranges too and brother br's like what is that all about he's like if you trim off one of the branches of the orange and you Graft in a lemon tree branch that Branch will produce lemons although it's connected to the life of a orange tree oh my praise God and brother said will that tree ever put forth oranges again he said yes when it puts forth an original Branch from the original tree praise God amen and brother said look this tree has a a lemon branch and it's producing lemons yet it's connected to the the life of an orange and brother BR said that's like a Methodist a Methodist is connected to life of Jesus but they produce produce Methodist fruit right he says but he said a Methodist will always produ a method a Methodist but a true branch of Jesus if Jesus is the vine we're the branches if we're a real Branch from Jesus we'll produce Jesus fruit praise God hallelujah we'll produce Christ Hallelujah we won't produce method we won't produce Amish amen we won't produce Pentecostal like I was Raising we'll produce Christ hallelujah amen amen I love these stories look I love brother the Simplicity God gave to brother Ram like a child could understand that I'm sure they do right because they get raised in the message Hallelujah see oranges will come only from a new Branch from the original tree so we must be original branches and we are brother R preach this a sermon about the bride tree praise God hallelujah and we're we're we're an original I'm sorry we're a branch from the original tree so we'll have the same signs same Doctrine same wonders same Miracles Same Love same emotion same everything as the early church praise God Amen like I was telling uh I was telling our our church a few weeks ago if we go back 10 years I've seen all the nine gifts of the holy spirit operate in our little church amen right because we're the original we're part of the original word of God Amen I've seen all nine of them I've seen all nine of them and plus uh now the preachers we don't see a lot of Apostles anymore Cu uh it's it's a hard job it's a hard job I mean which who do we know that goes to places where there's no churches and starts a brand new church that's a hard thing to do but we've had a couple Apostles over the last 10 years maybe two but we've had all the other gifts you know preaching the preaching gifts see we want to have all that God has for us praise God Amen Hallelujah now we can't we can't make God do Miracles so we got to wait till it's God's time to use those gifts of the holy spirit amen like I said here before maybe I told you before it really helped somebody one time I said God is not like a uh you know airpods or God's not like a a like something in my pocket like I can well when I want to speak in tonu I'll just take it out and I'll just speak in tonu whenever I want that's not how God works you and I don't keep God in our pocket no I'll say like this God dwells in our Souls praise God Amen but when God wants to move it's at God's Direction not my direction praise God I can ask God to move but it's all up to God if he moves or not praise God Hallelujah but that's what the Pentecost that's where they made their mistake I was raised that church they'd say okay take out your tongues in other take out your tongues and let's all speak in tongues well you can't do that that's not you don't find that in the Bible the Bible says if they do that they're barbarians yeah yeah right amen Paul said if you can't give an interpretation keep silent in the church well we need some Paws to step into those churches don't we Hallelujah some brother Brams that come down their denominations and stir them up praise God m now brother R gets back to the scripture I'm not going to read these but in John 15:5 Jesus said I am the vine ye are the branches so he's the original tree we got to be a branch off the original tree and Jesus said in John 14:12 The Works that I do shall ye do also amen and we can do the same works of Jesus when we're attached to the same tree the same life hallelujah amen right it's just his love flowing through us like I told you last time that brother had the migraine and we just had an anointed service about a month ago I said come up for prayer then the service we prayed over him and while we're praying he said the migraine totally left him amen and I you know I I don't we don't plan those things out he's had other migraines before we prayed it didn't happen but it happens when God wants it to happen praise God Amen you see we just got to we just got to be connected to the vine see we do the works of God hallelujah as God leads us to work and church don't feel bad if you don't have the gift of healing the Bible said not everybody has the gift of healing not everybody's an apostle thank God because if if if that was the case if we're all Apostles we never see one another thank God we have pastors you know that stay around and just stay with the people if not we'd be oh see you John see you Irvin see you brother Aaron we we just be traveling all around and we'd have no stability in our lives amen thank God there's differences of body parts too the nine gifts of the holy spirit then brother R goes to Genesis 4 we're not going to turn there but he said now look here's two men that are worshippers there he starts calling them twins just like just like the wheat and The Tear are twins right the two seeds they sow the white the man and white the man the man in Black they look very similar and he shows us the first twins here Cain and Abel brother said they both worship God Amen but one worshiped God the right way while the other worshiped God his own way yesen and God only accepted the one who worshiped according to the word of God that was able praise God and that's why God will accept you brother Urban and and Wilma that's why God will accept these people all these people here because we're worshiping according to God's word and not our feelings praise God Amen we bring our feelings into obedience to the word of God we deny our feelings and we take God's word if there's if there's a contrast or if there's a difference we take God's word hallelujah amen thank you Jesus so brother starts showing how now look the anointing fell on the anointing fell on Cain I need to worship and God even said you know what to do if you just did what I told you to do you'd rule over your brother but he turned down that he turned it down but he look he was anointed to come and worship they worshiped at the same church they worshiped at the same altar praise God but one took the anointing of God the other one took his own anointing see both were trying to contact God okay next then brother Ram goes to one of the main characters that's B if you haven't read about balum you got to read about balum in your free time cuz I I have to preach a whole Sermon Just on BM because it's such a rich and deep and uh important story brother Ram says now another set of twins is Moses and balum he said both had Miracles both had Supernatural gifts yeah but he says what was the difference between Moses and balam he said Moses's teaching was perfect there's a lot preachers they that don't like teaching they say oh we need more miracles and we Jesus isn't a Doctrine I know Jesus isn't a Doctrine but if Jesus ever tells us to do something it's a Doctrine praise God like if you ever spend time talking to Jesus he's going to tell you to do something that's a Doctrine because a Doctrine means instruction praise God hallelujah said Moses teaching was perfect but balam's teaching was sinful balum taught the people were all the same moabites and Jews were all the same that's like people to they saying oh you're the same as Catholics brother said we are not the same yeah amen oh you're the same as Baptists no we're not no we're not praise God we are totally different praise God because we're following the full word of God and we're not ashamed of the word of God hallelujah amen now in Numbers 22 we're not going to go over but um Balo is a king moit king and he asked balam to curse Israel and so what does balum do he says well let me go talk to God and God said don't go with Bayo and you can't curse Israel so bam comes back he says okay I can't do it and Bayo says go back and ask again now you would think you wouldn't have to ask God a second time about something but to show to show the the lustful desire of balum for money balum goes back to God and God said go now did God change his mind no God let balam have his permissive will okay that's very important so if somebody like like and the example I love what brother R gives he gives the example of a woman preacher a woman preacher will say well brother God told me to preach and brother said I don't doubt that one bit but that wasn't the first thing God told you the first thing God told you what it's it's wrong for a woman to take authority over men praise God because that's God's original word hallelujah amen and I'm just going to say this too with the tape Church movement Joseph brandom said the Lord told him that he's in God's will for playing tapes he said thus sayith the Lord I told Joseph I said I don't doubt that I told him an email I said I don't doubt that but that wasn't God's first word amen amen because God can't change Ephesians 4:11 praise God God can't change his his original method for people to hear the word of God it's living preachers preaching God's living word praise God amen amen I don't doubt that one bit but it wasn't God God's original will amen the Bible said how blessed are the feet of them who bring Gospel of good news where's brother R's feet today if you play a tape brother man's feet aren't here he's already gone on to his reward let him have his reward he can't be our pastor now he can still be our Prophet as far as he points us to the word of God through the tapes but he can't have a living Ministry now he's already living in another realm praise God Amen but we're living here and so living men with living feet must preach God's word and the Bible said how blessed are the feet of them who bring the gospel of good peace amen they asked brother brand should preachers keep preaching now or should we change our evangelism he said no keep preaching he said I'm right behind you praise God Amen so I know if brother was here he'd be right behind me saying Amen brother Amen brother keep preaching anoint the on in the end time keep preaching baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he'd be right behind the preachers hallelujah amen amen that's why I asked him I said Brother Joseph when are you going to say what brother ramam said you always say say what the tape say I said when are you going to say when you going to say that yeah when are you going to say what that tape says praise God I say it with love church I say it with love but see balam he went back to God for god's second opinion God don't have a second opinion no no but God will give you your heart's desire if it's the wrong desire now it's amazing in Numbers Chapter 23 uh balam of course earlier was warned by a talking dony the donkey warned him don't go but he still went yeah and then when he gets there church he makes sacrifice now here's a great lesson it's in numbers 23 veres 1 to 4 why don't we turn there because I want to read one verse out of there this moabit King Bao he wants he wants balum to change his mind and curse Israel and notice how does baam get God to come down and talk to him he makes seven altars yeah and he sacrifices uh seven oxen and seven Rams that is a huge sacrifice now look at this he's a bad seed he's going he's going to go to hell eventually you know the Bible says that in second Peter chapter 2 but he knows he's going to go to hell but he knows how to contact God how do he contact God sacrifice yeah shutting in with God in the secret place right shut in with God in the secret place we sing that song how do you how do you contact God you got to isolate yourself you got to seek God the Bible said draw night to God he'll draw night to you praise God Amen now if you notice though balam mixes Heathen worship with Jewish worship because the heathens would build multiple altars God said there's only one altar yeah so see he mixes his Heathen religion well I'll do seven altars that's not what God wanted God wanted one alter and then look he he incorporates well I'm going to get clean animals right and then what's amazing he gives the most Exquisite or the most uh valuable offering it's burn offerings all all the other offerings you would keep a piece and you would eat it and the people got to be blessed but not with the burnt offering with the burnt offering everything burned you got nothing God got everything and that was the most valuable sacrifice you could possibly give so bam says I if I want to contact God I've got to make some great sacrifices if I want to hear the voice of God I've really got a sacrifice and so he does and the Bible said God comes down now let's read verse one because that's an important verse you want to read that brother John numbers 231 whenever you get it brother and Bam said unto ba build me here seven altars and deare me here seven ox and seven Rams all right so he goes through this motions and God tells him he still can't curse Israel hallelujah it's a beautiful portion God tell and uh the Bible said that he actually goes into a vision and he sees how blessed Israel is and love what brother Ram said brother Braham said Bao and balam were like these guys can play in the wilderness Israel uh they're not very faithful to God look at all their sins look at all they're complaining and they they just saw Israel based upon their natural things but brother raham said but God looked down from heaven and God saw uh the Brazen serpent other words God saw them forgiven God saw the pillar of fire god was in the pillar of fire hallelujah amen but see they they just bam just looked at all their mistakes it just shows God's not looking at your mistakes God's looking at your sacrifice praise God Amen Hallelujah and also God's presence will never leave you he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you praise God you're God's child he can't curse his own children praise God that's what we learned from the story of balum balum and Bao triy to get God to curse his children he said I can't curse my children I I can't do that now the one I wanted to read was uh chapter 24:1 sister Miram could you read chapter 24 verse one that's the one that's really important for us here tonight and when bam saw that it pleased the lord to bless Israel he went not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he said his face toward the Wilderness unbelievable scripture right there unbelievable bam saw wow if I If I sacrifice these animals God will come down and so he kept doing that right but before what did he do brother John when he went if he couldn't hear from God what would he do he' go to the demon The Witches he' go to the witches he would seek enchantments how how can I get a curse on this person what what and yet God would talk right to him yes why because he had the gift of a prophet yeah the Bible calls him a prophet yeah amen so if God gives you that gift God's going to work with you in that way so don't feel bad if you've never seen a vision or you never prophesied don't worry about it you ought to be happy praise God hallelujah brother brother say that carries a lot of responsibility look what it did with bam yeah come on brother so think about that here's a man no wonder he went to hell most of the time brother uran he'd go out and he talked to witches can you get me an enchantment can you do this and this and we'll conjure up this we'll conjure up these spirits but then he learned well I can contact God through through sacrifice here's the way I can talk to the almighty God but yet he was also talking to Demons at times that is balam is one of these people like Matthew chapter 7 Lord Lord did I not prophesy he did prophesy on he prophesied of the star of Jacob that would rise balam prophesied of the star that would lead the wise men to baby Jesus right and this was uh 1500 years before Jesus was born and he was right brother Ram said true prophecy false teaching from balam his prophecy was right his gift was right but his teaching was wrong what did his teaching do he said let's let's invite Israel to Moab let's have a uh let's have a a unified meeting brother liking to under Constantine uniting with the church right amen around 325 the Council of NAA that's what brother said that was the modern version of ba uh B PR yeah and what did balum say bam got up to the pulpit he says well I prophesied of Israel he said but all you Israelites were all the same you can have fornication you you men can sleep with these moabit women and they went out and did it and God killed 24,000 of them wow but yet when he prophesied it was thus sayith the Lord it was perfect perfectly right yeah but then he tried to get in a different office and teach them about sexual relations and family and because of that he went to hell and he did it for money though that's the reason why the Bible said he loved the wages of righteousness so he was getting paid oh yeah put a few more dollars in there guys put 10,000 more in there and I'll tell him about fornicating yeah what a devil amen but see he knew how to contact God and knew how to contact Devils come on that's a scary thing to do thank God we only contact Jesus Christ thank God amen amen I'd rather be a small little insignificant Pastor or whatever just preach God's word and be true to God and only contact God I'd rather do that than have all kinds of Supernatural Miracles or prophecies and contact Devils let me only be in touch with God Almighty Jesus Christ amen amen praise God hallelujah let me only honor and serve Jesus Christ so because I know when I get there he'll say Well done good and faithful serving Hallelujah you didn't contact witches or anything like that you only sought heav you waited on me praise God and In God's Time and season I answer you praise God Amen brother man said the teaching of Moses was perfect that was the difference he said we're not the same as the denominations we're separated people hallelujah he said the prophecy of balam was exactly right because he couldn't speak and nothing else but what God told him the anointing of God wouldn't speak nothing else and God Vindicated it by proving it was the truth but it was the teaching of balam that was wrong now what about all these message churches that say polygamy is okay it's the same devil amen amen they only preach that because they don't understand what brother R said they don't search their Bibles and they don't listen with a humble heart brother never supported polygamy no if you go read if you go listen to marriage and divorce there's only one one time when a man can divorce his wife and marry another only one and that's when that woman woman she lied to him at the beginning before they got married and said I I've never known a man and they got married and later he finds out she did know a man in that case only can a man put that one away and then marry another woman right that's the only one that's in Matthew Chapter 5 and Matthew 19 so let me just say like this in most cases marriage is until death and the church said amen Brothers there's no such a thing as well I want a new model I'm going to put away this this old model why I'm going to get a new new model wife shame on a man that would do that that's a lustful demonic Spirit praise God amen amen and what's the example of that it's Mary and Joseph Joseph he found Mary impregnated and he said well I don't want to disrespect her publicly I'll put her away privately cuz she said she was a virgin but look she's got a child now and look how God stopped that amen look look how God protects his word amen hallelujah praise God he said don't put her away cuz that which is conceived in Mary is of the the Holy Ghost praise God don't do not fear to take marry thy wife amen see the Bible interprets itself praise God Amen now that wasn't in my notes so hopefully that helps Somebody by God's grace now brother B next he goes through more examples from the Old Testament we're not going to read them but I just want to listen to you I would encourage you read First Kings chapter 22 it's micaah the prophet he's right after Elijah or maybe right with Elijah kind of it's kind of hard for me I haven't actually placed the the the chronological order together but it's it was Mah the true prophet of God against zedekiah the false prophet okay and so Ahab was the evil King and zedekiah and all the all the prophets were saying thus sayith the Lord go up go up and repossess the land Ahab go up and you'll be successful and they said uh what do you think Micaiah you're you're always I hate you you're always speaking evil against me he said if you go up there he said then he said you're going to die basically he said if you come back then the Lord never talked to me he said see why I hate him Jehoshaphat see why I hate this guy he's always speaking evil against me and brother said that's because Ahab was doing evil yeah if Ahab would do right God would speak good things to you praise God but when you do evil God has to speak judgments against you praise God and then the Bible said Mah said you know why I know because God showed me in heaven God was sitting on a throne and all these demons were coming up and God said who can deceive Ahab to believe a lie to go up and be killed and fulfill Elijah's prophecy and we've got Elijah we received Elijah and God heard this one that one and then the lying spirit said I'll come up I'll deceive those 400 prophets I'll put a lying I'll be the lying spirit in their mouth and Mah said that's thus sayith the Lord and God said okay lying Spirit you go deceive Ahab he's got to he has to go die and fulfill what Elijah prophesied the church said but think about that think about you're one Prophet against 450 all 450 or shouting giving God you know trying to worship God or bail whatever they were doing you had 400 against one and God was with the one so don't be discouraged if you're standing alone if you're standing on the word you're standing with God hallelujah amen and really you're in the majority amen if God sing with you then the angels are with you and you're in the majority in heaven praise God Amen oh thank God the next one is Jeremiah and Hann and I in Jeremiah chapter 28 brother gives these examples haniah he agreed with the King and he put a yoke on himself and said he said thus sayi the Lord he said Israel is going to be back uh I'm sorry Israel is going to be back here in Jerusalem in two years thus sayi the Lord and Jeremiah had already said it's going to be 70 you know what Jeremiah said he said amen amen he said a prophet is known by when his word comes to pass yes amen so be it he knew where he stood church he didn't say well I don't know let me go check my writings let me go check he already spoke thus say the Lord praise God and the Bible said Hanah died that that very same year God killed him because he f prophesied a false prophecy yeah but look both look anointed hanah's got a yoke on and he he's he's so emot throws down the Yoke he said thus say the Lord and Jeremiah's over here thus sayith the Lord amen who you going to believe the one who's right with the word amen hallelujah you would you would have been on Jeremiah's side right you would have been on Mah's side right now the next one brother R gives is David when he brought the ark up the first time and uh brother R said look now this is a little bit different but he's saying here David danced and I danced remember I danced and shouted and jumped all over this place don't hit my head on there but the Bible said he had all the emotion all the jumping music everything but he he brought the Ark on a cart instead of carrying it on the levite shoulders and because that usza tried to steady it and he touched the ark and he died yeah yeah and brother said look when you obey the word of God you got to keep all the word of God yeah the dancing jumping shouting that's good but you also got to keep the word praise God amen amen so brother says look the anointing has to have obedience with it as well you can't just have emotion and excitement enthusiasm and praising God worshiping God that's good it's all good but you got to keep the word as well pra amen now sure just so you know three months later he brought the ark back again with with the Ark on the staves and God received it and nobody died yeah same dancing same that's why I'm happy to dance praise God same dancing same shouting same praising same everything the only difference was he now was obeying the word of God praise God fully now think about that just one thing off the word of God caus a man to die that's why I want this church to be founded on the word of God hallelujah we want you to have all the joy all the love all everything well we also want you to obey all the word of God Amen brother said you know uh he said when he said like he said uh the ark on a cart today is like a denominational idea like a woman preacher or praying to Mary like I've said or the Trinity that's a man-made cart yeah but see our arc's true our Ark is right where it needs to be praise God it's right above the heart of the preachers hallelujah what brother man says it's a nice little type there it's always above the heart it's right above the heart praise God all right now now brother now moves to our day and he reads 2 Timothy 3 where Paul said there will be perilous times in the last days and I want you to read 2 Timothy 3:13 so let's turn turn there 2 Timothy 3:13 and brother irin you could read that brother whenever you get it I'd appreciate that most you know this this is the section where Paul says men will be treacherous tra traitors heady high-minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godl denying the power thereof but Paul says something very important in verse 13 so brother uran could you read that please you men and shall and wor deceiving and being deceived amen so as as as deceptive as it was in Moses day or Mah's day or even Jesus day with Judas and Jesus our day is going to be more deceptive amen that's why I've said this from the PBA many times the most deceptive thing today to me is the tape Church movement because they love listen tapes they believe in miracles all these things but it's still wrong yeah that's my humble opinion that's why I'm looking at preachers I could be wrong but I believe I'm right because the word of God and brother's quotes go along with what I'm saying I'm trying to follow the word of God that's to me it's more deceptive like a woman just contacted me a couple weeks ago she said I follow uh brandom Tabernacle uh I want to come to your church do you guys follow the schedule Bram Tabernacle I said no ma'am she said okay I'm not going to come I said ma'am would you please consider here's a few videos I did about how a brandom tabernacle is off the word of God would you please like to listen to him she said no thank you I I I'll be happy with this now she won't even hear it now how is there any hope for that when you won't even hear the other side it's so sad I say I love you I'll be praying for you and I do pray for them I do pray for them now I want to get down to uh uh the pope now the Pope the pope Antichrist if we live to see it the pope will become this problem solver brother BR says and he'll solve all the economic problems all the peace problems the safety problems he'll solve all the problems but he'll have lying signs and wonders doing it yeah yeah who'll have Miracles now in most of the case it looks like they're going to be deceiving false Miracles okay yeah but he could he may have one Miracle that's a real miracle I don't know he he could be like bam he could get under the anointing but the Bible says lying wonders let's read that uh Revelation 1920 brother Aaron you want to read that when you get there Revelation 19:20 and then Mali do you want to go to 2 Thessalonians 2:8 I'm going to send you to a different scripture to kind of conserve a little time here I God gra I've been preaching about 53 minutes you been a wonderful audience paying attention and enjoying the word of God God bless you for that so brother everyone have you ready 1920 yes sir and the Beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought Miracles before him with which he deceived them that had to receive the mark of the beast and them that worshiped His Image these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with Brimstone amen glory that's at the end of Armageddon right how did how did the Pope Antichrist get all these nations to fight against Jesus Christ he deceived them with lying signs and wonders yeah right did you know Church my brother showed me some videos there's magicians that walk on water that climb walls I think David Blaine's one of them I don't know these guys um one of them they said even flew away I don't know if that's trick I don't know if that what I don't know what it is but Satan does have pretty he can do pretty powerful things yeah right but the Antichrist he's going to be able to deceive because he's going to do lying wonders and lying Miracles now remember church we don't have time to go through this but in Exodus 11 those Egyptian M magicians did three imitations of God's power yeah first they were able to throw down rods and turns into snakes yeah but God's up their things death is swalled up in life amen hallelujah hallelujah and then they're able to turn water into blood and the last thing they could do was they could bring frogs out of the water but the next thing God said lice I'm turning all this dust to lice and they couldn't do it so they reached they can't even do a third of what God can do now really they can't do it they can't even do a third of a third of a third of a third because God is infinite God is powerful praise God but let just let you know our God is greater our God is stronger and our God will always have more power praise God and also in Ma I'm sorry yes in Matthew and Luke chapter 4 Satan takes Jesus up to a high mountain now think of that yeah and think think think what a think what a loving father God was God let his son be taken up to a high mountain by the devil see because God God only gave him permission to do certain things right am Satan has power to transport people now I don't know if that's what alien abductions is I don't know that's that's my guess I don't know but Satan could transport Jesus up to a high mountain tempt him and then bring him back to Jerusalem set him on the Pinnacle and show him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment's time yeah he has that power but remember he only has that power when God allows it I don't want that to happen to me so Lord spare me from that praise God just keep me safe and humble in my little place in the world you know keep me in the CLI of the rock praise God hallelujah but see Satan does have powers and he can do lying signs and wonders like uh I think we talked about last time apparitions right how many you seen the Catholic apparitions they they have they have statues of Mary and blood will flow out of her eyes and they'll they'll go kiss the statue oil oil will run out of Mary's hands the statue and they think that's God that's not God God never wanted us to kiss statues and bow down to statues and worship them but yet it's a lying sign and wonder right that that fit Satan can turn water to blood Satan can make blood come out of the statue it fits yeah he has power to do that if God allows it yes but how do you know who's right or wrong go back to the Bible yeah where does the bible say there's Purgatory the Bible don't say that where does the bible call the pope Holy Father Pope's not even in the Bible and the only person that's the Holy Father Is God Almighty Jesus Holy Father amen there's only one Holy Father that's God hallelujah amen that's how I know we're right am Mali can you read that it's 2 Thessalonians 2 89 and 10 are verses about the Antichrist and he deceives by signs wonders and miracles now this case they're lying so that means they're they're motivated by the wrong Spirit go ahead malcol and then shall that Wicked be revealed and the Lord shall consume the spirit of his mouth and shall d the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the the truth that they might be saved there it is praise God how do you know the pope won't deceive you because you don't love sin you're chosen uh to Salvation by belief of the truth love of the truth in other words everyone in in the mark of the beast will hate truth but you love it praise God Amen so you know you're not going to be a part of that system you're not going to take the mark of the beast because Jesus Christ has already marked your soul with his holy spirit praise God Amen I can't be marked by two I can only be marked by one and I'm going be marked by Christ hallelujah amen amen and notice the pope will only deceive those people who love unrighteousness who love sin they put out an article two weeks ago the Pope the the Vatican did they put out an article and they now they're going to start uh uh investigating and and seeing if if if trans people and gays could be a part of the ministry with the Catholic Church oh my and trying to include them see it's going to church we're going to overcome by God's grace we're going to overcome amen we're on the side of the right praise God amen amen God standing with us amen hallelujah amen now before I move on brother man said this I'm going to read it he said when you listen to the tape even maybe I'll be gone someday when the Lord has finished with here with with me here on Earth you'll refer back to this tape listen to my voice what I'm telling you if he takes me before his coming just remember I've spoken to you in the name of the Lord by the word of the Lord amen that's a prophet hallelujah amen in this sermon brother man makes a powerful prophecy brother John he says it's predicted that they're going to do it and they're going to do it it's thus sayith the lord they're going to do it he said you think them nominations will ever break up and come back to the word of God he said it's thus say the Lord they won't yeah he said will they go in the mark of the beast he said thus sayith the Lord they will praise God and look has a has a denomination since 1965 broken up and say we're coming back to the Lord Jesus Christ baptism not a one of them he was a genuine Prophet Hallelujah they only fall further and further away what man talks like that only a man that's been in God's presence Hallelujah I use that quote all the time these people say brother R don't have any prophecies that come to pass I said what about that show me one I'm still waiting for I'm still waiting yeah I made that video like nine years ago I'm still waiting for somebody to show me when Hallelujah they won't they can't praise God because God's word is always true God doesn't lie praise God amen amen now all right and then I want to hit a few more more scriptures here let's see yeah now I'm going to stop on brother bam sermon I stopped about halfway now I just want to lay in some Bible verses now I want to just talk about the anointing for a few moments here I've already been preaching an hour so maybe give me 20 more minutes here by God's grace we'll see how it goes I I always underestimate the time so it's probably be 30 minutes okay I I always say 15 more minutes at home and it always turns into 30 minutes I'm trying now to understand this topic you have to understand you have three Parts you have a body mind and soul okay and the anointing of on us is supposed to fall on all three areas right but with people like Judas and balam the Holy Ghost never Falls in their soul their innermost part but it can fall on their minds that's why balum could see Israel goodly tense he could see the star where in his had anointing on his mind but it never got down to his soul amen right that's the difference between the wheat and the tears okay and church every person has a gift of God in here yeah amen the Bible makes that plain Romans 11:29 let's read that that's going to be crucial for us to read there Romans 11:29 my do you want to read that buddy Romans 11:2 I use your name today in the sermon praise God and then John can you get a different scripture for me brother can you get 1 Corinthians 12:7 1 Corinthians 12:7 and then Romans 11:2 M these two verses say you have a gift and calling even if you don't repent like Bam Bam had a calling to serve God but he didn't repent right Judas brother said Judas had the highest calling in the Bible to be a missionary but he didn't repent right he had gifts anyway he had gifts he had he could cast out Devils he could do all those things Jesus gave him power to do okay M can you read that Romans 11:29 for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance awesome good job buddy see you you have gifts and callings whether you repent or not right remember Judas and Judas the scariot and balam are the prime examples the easiest ones to see because we know the Bible says they went to hell yet they had gifts yet they did Supernatural things okay then 1 Corinthians 12:7 brother this has always been helpful to me 1 Corinthians 12:7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all how many men get it every man yeah that's why told you sisters and you Brothers when I first came all of you have a gift of God whether it's faith faith moves mountains you just God reveals the will and you just speak God's word and faith will move them out amen amen or how about knowledge someone needs a scripture and the Holy Ghost anoints you you give them the knowledge understanding of the word of God a sisters can have that how about wisdom wisdom is what to do and when to do it when should I buy that and a sister will say the Lord told me do this that buy it then and do do do and then build it there and that will be a gift of God God praise God tongues interpretation prophecy discernment we have a sister in the church she got discernment I've seen it we were going into to get a little rental trying to get uh her uh apartment to rent and I talked to the lady there she's really nice and we left and this sister in the church she's a new sister she said that woman's corrupt and I thought I don't think so she was pretty nice I mean she's kind of a young Christian maybe she just and come to find out she tried to steal the money thank God she didn't steal her money all the way and then one time my wife was really struggling she was hurting I think it was after one of the miscarriages and this new sister she the the Lord told her she only been to church about a year and a half sister Lena said go up and tell Kristen these certain certain things so she went up and she said the Lord told me to come tell you this and that and you're struggling with that and God wants God wants you to know this and it was exactly right that's just how simple it is amen it don't have to be like every time not be like thus say the Lord I'm going to do this and that in front of everybody you don't have to be like that every time yeah it might yeah but it don't have to be yeah you just follow God's leading all right so also let's read a good one here um I already went through balum bam had Visions from God he got the anointing but then he got on the anointing of Satan to teach false Judas had the anointing to uh to cast out Devils do all those things the disciples did but then he got Satan filled his heart to betray G uh betray Jesus the one that was new to me was Matthew 1227 Matthew 12:27 let's read that one brother Joel you want to read that for us Matthew uh 12:27 and 28 I never seen this till today I never really thought about it amen I love when I get fresh thoughts don't you like that it's Revelation praise God whenever you ready but you can read uh 12: 27-28 and if I by of cast out Devils by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judgment but if I cast out Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God Has Come amen here's another group that's casting out Devils but they're Pharisees they're Children of the Pharisees who are the Pharisees the Pharisees were the legalistic Jews that rejected Jesus so here we have a group of people and Jesus said most of the Pharisees were children of the devil and they make their Converse twice as much children of the devil as they were yeah and yet they're casting out Devils isn't that something now they weren't using the name of Jesus because they didn't believe in Jesus so maybe they cast out devils like David did they played and worshiped Jehovah or maybe they said in the name of Jehovah and the name of Yahweh come out and then you it' have to come out because that's the power of God Amen yet the Pharisees hated Jesus just like balum hated the Jews yes am just like judas's scarrett sold out Jesus that was new to me i' never seen that till today I was like that's right so Judas balam and the children of the Pharisees likely in their souls brother said they have like a serpent they don't have the seed of God they don't have the dove in their soul yeah amen but God can anoint their minds and they can do Supernatural things they can prophesy they can heal the sick they can lay hands on the sick they shall recover they can discern but see then they leave God's anointing and they work iniquity they have their little sin secret on the side remember a few years ago U one of those dating websites the adultery websites I forget somebody hacked them and they they they they they shared all these men that were committing adultery on their wives and a lot of them committed uh suicide see these these men have Secret Lives I don't want to have any secret life I want everybody to see my life I want to be plain Hallelujah I don't want to hide nothing I want to give it all to Jesus praise God Amen I was so glad I'm like thank God I'm not one of them hallah thank God I got no Seekers praise God I tell Jesus forgive me of my sins give me Grace to overcome give me strength yeah amen I don't want a secret life all these guys had Secret Lives balum Judas the children of the Pharisees but what's interesting is they knew the approach on how to get the anointing and everybody knows it today you got confess your sins and you got to start worshiping God isn't that what the Bible says let me read that verse uh the Bible says he inhabits the Praises of his people let me find that oh yeah Psalms 22:3 Mal you want to read that Psalm 22:3 if you want to feel God's anointing start praising God but first confess your sins right CU you got to have a sacrifice that's a sacrifice God forgive me and then you start praising Jesus you can have your own worship session Sister Sarah you can just dance or you can praise God you get on your knees that's what I like to do in my prayer closet or at the church sometimes I lay on my face I'll just praise God and pretty soon you'll feel the anointing pretty soon you're going to start being joyful praise God or you start weeping and crying because you feel the sacred presence of Jesus amen amen Mal you want to read that Psalm 22:3 Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabit the praise of Hallelujah when you start praising God his anointing Falls right on you and the church said amen amen and that lines up with a verse I preached last time 2 Kings 3:15 Elisha said somebody bring me a Minstrel somebody bring me somebody that can play the strings like David and when when when when the menro played the Holy Ghost SP Elijah and he said make a valley full of ditches the victory is coming that's thus sayith the Lord amen praise God Amen the gifts of God started operating when he started worshiping and praising God Amen Hallelujah all right I'm at an hour and 10 see I'm almost done here so that's how you get the anointing now I'm going to bring up this topic Aon and I were texting about it and John we talked about it can Satan heal right we all agreed Satan can't heal that's what Jesus said in uh uh Matthew 12 I think it's 26 uh let me go back there I'm going to read that one [Music] but there's some interesting quotes I want to read a quote brother Aon and I were texting about this quote and it just related perfectly to this topic of the anointed Winds of the end times I thought it'd be perfect to read Matthew 12:20 six there it is so Jesus was casting out devils and the Pharisees are saying well you're a devil and Jesus said Devils don't cast out Devils yeah amen if they do Their Kingdoms divided yeah amen verse 26 and if Satan cast out Satan he's divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand Satan cannot heal oh yeah the example I heard brother random give was uh when God sent boils on Egypt the uh the The Magicians couldn't take him away they couldn't bring healing is that a great example that was anointing was the time I thought that's a beautiful example yeah brother said he saw demons that would make ropes stand up straight or snakes dance or people walk on coals that's not that's not healing that's a trick yeah yeah some type of perverted trick demon power but God is the only one who heals he created the bodies Hallelujah and if he created it he can fix it Hallelujah no problem for him but Satan didn't create he can't he's not a Creator he's a perverter praise God amen amen now here's the quote brother ER and I were talking about brother Ram said he went to France and also another country I don't know if he says it in here but he says he went to France France he says oh yeah there's an idol of a dead woman in France and he said he said people would go up to that Idol and get healed and brother R said they can do that because God honors their faith okay now for me like I was telling brother Aaron that that might be true God might honor their faith but like I told brother Aaron I said if I want to teach something I got to be able to teach it from Genesis to Revelation so let me just give this as encouragement let's search our Bibles and if we can find some then I can come back and preach it praise God Amen okay now let me say this uh that was a great uh quote there brother I appreciate that brother Aaron um nine times brother Ram said Satan cannot heal we just read it we all agree Satan can't heal now here's some other thoughts brother Ram didn't give us all the details of that story maybe the witch doctors actually were giving out herbs to people and they got healed well that would be God using Divine Healing right remember the one time Isaiah said go get some figs and put it on those boils and the figs healed the boils God uses herbs to heal praise God he uses plants to heal sometimes see we don't know all the details right maybe they maybe he maybe they got the uh the herbs they rubbed them on they stood by the statue and left but it wasn't the statue it was God's herbs that did the healing Satan can't heal no right another example this is interesting Devils might have made those people act like they got healed by the statue because I've seen that before in Guyana and Pennsylvania women were two women come up for prayer and the Holy Ghost was there and before I could lay my hands on the woman she passed out and everybody thought praise God it's the Holy Ghost and I went down to pray for her she started kicking and fighting against me I said look at that Satan was doing everything he could so I couldn't lay hands on the sick so they'd recover my I said I learned a good lesson that day praise God Amen so maybe these sick people come before the idol and they pass out or something they get oh it could be pretend yeah come on we don't know we don't have enough details but I know that was real cuz then the I and then we prayed for her the devil was cast out she screamed and she was weeping and crying she was a new creature praise God Amen and then I was in Pennsylvania a couple years later over there brother Jim's Church brother Jim shix and a sister come up and the same thing happened and and the same thing happened people thought it was God I said no it's not it's the devil God God gave me you know he taught me before so I'd be ready and the same thing happened I went down to pray for her and she got this mean look on her face she's still alive today she's sweet sister boy she's she's really delivered from that devil now she she's so sweet she's forced brother Jim so much with all of her heart she got this mean face and she started cooking like this and I said in the name of Jesus Christ come out of her Satan come out and then she let out a scream and she was well after that see so that's two other thoughts that could happen because remember Satan does lying signs and wonders and miracles or here's another example the witch doctor could have been like balam and went and talked to God and prayed and made sacrifices and then maybe prayed for the people in the name of Jesus and then he went back to doing the witch witch enchantments like we don't know the details but we know God's the Healer praise God Amen he's the Creator he's the sustainer he's the Healer he's the forgiver he's the Redeemer praise God Jesus Christ is our all all praise God Amen two more thoughts Satan only has power when God allows it remember God allowed The Magicians just to to mimic the first three plagues God gave Satan power over everything in job's life except his life and again God let Satan take Jesus transported the mountain transported Jerusalem but he couldn't touch Jesus amen the second point and this is important brother Iran and John I want you if you guys are going to be preachers or whatever got to hear this one God will sometimes honor people's gifts even if they're disobedient yeah okay here's two here's three examples in numbers 20 God told Moses go speak to the Rock and'll bring forth water and Moses said you bunch of rebels all you guys do is complain and he smoked the Rock and brought forth water and God said you magnified yourself you pridefully glorified yourself you're not going to the promised land yet the gift operated brother Aaron told me a good story about a preacher that he heard there was a preacher he had the gift of healing but he got drunk right is that right and a mother brought her son up to be healed of club feet and under the anointing he prayed for her or prayed for the boy and the boy was healed yet the preacher was drunk because God honored the gift that was in the man's life isn't that something see that's right brother said he said you can send your soul to hell with a gift brother like balum did see that preacher got so relaxed I can get drunk anyway God still going to pour out his blessings well God is yeah if they have faith God's still going to honor Fai but we got to be faithful with our gifts amen the second example 2 Kings 2: 23-2 Elisha had a double anointing of the Holy Ghost my goodness and these children were mocking him saying thou bald head thou bald head you're a baldheaded creature and Elijah said thus sayith the Lord and the she bears come down there and killed 42 of them and brother R said that was not the spirit of God that was Elijah's anger he had the gift to do it he had the gift to do it that's why we got to be careful with the gifts yeah amen and now let me give you one from brother Brandon in 1947 brother Rand admits on tape he said I got to the spot in prayer lines when I said bring nothing up here but Mar mirales look up nothing but Miracles and he said think about that even Jesus never did that and brother BR said the Lord get let him got away with it for six months before he showed him he was wrong and brother Bram said I was in balam's shoes he was disobeying God yeah come on by trying to prove to everybody look what God can do look and God never said to do that think about that all the people with lesser diseases weren't even getting prayed for just the big Miracles because brother wanted to try to prove to everybody God was a Healer but he didn't ask God about that first God still honored his prayers he honored the gift Hallelujah and church I'll just be honest like this as a pastor I have a gift to pastor and sometimes some days I'll have bad days some days I'll struggle with sin different Temptations I'll ask God to forgive me I'll come to church I'll preach the word of God and God's holy ghost will fall but afterwards I still got to live a Godly life yeah amen amen I I'll be someone like I had such an awful day I I got angry I got I did this and I did that and yet God will still pour out his blessings because God honors his gift yes amen but I want to be faithful with my gift Amen brother I don't want to use the gift just for popularity just for money just for whatever I want to use God gift with a pure heart amen all right I'm closing it's been an hour and 20 so usually I preach an hour and a half so this is actually pretty good that's pretty good go to First John first John the book of First John at the end of the New Testament verses 7 to 10 if you want the anointing this is how we do [Music] it first John chapter 1 then we'll go to First John chapter 2 and we'll be done just two more two more portions of scripture saying you've been a wonderful uh Christian audience here verse seven if we walk in the light as he's in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin how many can say amen amen all sin not some sin all sin when we say Sorry God takes it all away verse eight if we say we have no sin I didn't sin today brother I never sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US see every and remember everybody has a gift right all the sisters have gifts too see we all got to be careful with our gifts verse n if we confess if that's a great big if isn't it that's a big little word isn't it that's a little word but it means a lot if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness now let's go to chapter 2 verse 20 chapter 2 ver 20 this has gone very well praise God I didn't think I'd have enough time to get through that but I think I got most of it and if you want some homework you can go read all those chapters I listed out there and you can or List actually the best thing we do go listen to anointed ones at the end times that's a tremendous message chapter 2 verse 20 actually let's read 19 now think about the people that have left this church in sin they went out from us because why they were not of us they were different seed right I'm talking about the Sinners not the saints that go to another church I'm talking about the Sinners when they leave here and they sin they left because they weren't the same seed as you guys you guys are the right seed Hallelujah that's right for if they had been of us they no doubt would have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us that's why people leave the church they're they're they're not the same quality as you Hallelujah they're not wheat like you are verse 20 but ye have an unction that means anointing what are we talking about the anointed ones at the end times who's the one that's really Anointed with the spirit of God it's us we're the real anointed ones of the end times praise God I heard a preacher preach that I really like that talk right the rain falls on the just and the unjust but the real people are the just ones the weak The Good Seed the children of God and we've got God's anointing on us praise God Amen but we have an anointing from the Holy One and you know all things now verse 27 the last verse and then we're going to close you've been a wonderful wonderful audience but the anointing which ye have received of Christ abides in you and you need not that any man teach you this is referring to overcoming seducers if you read the previous verse so when Satan's trying to seduce you or deceive you you don't need anybody to teach you you need the anointing yeah Amen brother you need the anointing to overcome lies the anointing to overcome gossip the anointing to come over lust or greed or fear fear of death whatever it is you need the anointing to overcome that need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you all things and his truth and is no lie there's no lie in the truth there's no lie in God's anointing praise God hallelujah won't lie he says even as it ha taught you ye shall abide in him and now my little children my little children and Young City abide in Christ that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at is coming let's stand to our feet praise God you know after a service like that it's good to worship god let's let's clap and give Jesus some some praise and can we do that by God's gra thank you Jesus thank you Lord we love you Jesus we love your anointing praise God hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah he inhabits the Praises of his people praise God now I hope that was a help by God's grace was that a blessing amen it was this is one of the deepest subjects I think seven Thunders might be a little deeper I don't know it depends how you approach it I believe they're already revealed I believe the seven Thunders already utter their voices but some people don't but the point is we have to have the anointing of Christ on us when the anointing is on us we'll be able to judge between good and evil praise God and we will always stay with the word we'll always pass the word test and we will not be deceived yes amen hallelujah because the elect can not be deceived amen I'm a witness Brother Ray brother Irvin I'm sorry Irvin I'm a witness I heard this message in November 2001 I've not been deceived since no preachers come around and swindle me over with some you know money-making schemes or uh anything anything like that this message always proves who's right amen amen because it's the word of God I don't have to fear anybody now sometimes I'm a nervous person sometimes I get nervous but I have to fear anybody because Jesus Christ is here praise God Amen the anointing is here if we got under the anointing the anointing cannot be defeated praise God it breaks all the yolks amen hallelujah the anointing breaks the yolks it teaches you all things Hallelujah it guides you into all truth praise God it will not lie amen let's bow our heads for a word of prayer here father God we thank you for tonight we thank you for the word of God I trust your people hallelujah fed on the word of God receive the word of God I trust your

God hallelujah the herbs of God hallelujah the children of the most high God hallelujah we believe it with all of our hearts Lord God those small number we know the word of God gives us many many
