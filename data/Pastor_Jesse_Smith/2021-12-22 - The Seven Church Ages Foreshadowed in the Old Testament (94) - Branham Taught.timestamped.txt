[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:08] of the lord jesus christ
[0:10] recently the lord revealed to me how the
[0:13] seven new testament church ages are
[0:15] foreshadowed in the old testament
[0:18] here's the outline for this video
[0:20] we'll start with my personal story
[0:23] second we'll look at ages proven by the
[0:26] bible
[0:27] third we'll listen to brother graham's
[0:28] quote about this
[0:31] fourth we'll look at the old testament
[0:33] church ages timeline
[0:35] in comparison with the new testament
[0:37] church ages timeline
[0:40] then we'll look at my understanding of
[0:41] the old testament age messengers
[0:45] and then we'll finish with the three
[0:46] types of the church ages in the old
[0:48] testament
[0:50] here's my personal story about this
[0:53] topic
[0:54] years ago probably 15 years ago
[0:57] i heard brother branham say how the
[0:59] church ages were foreshadowed in the old
[1:01] testament well this was a question i had
[1:03] and i couldn't understand it so i just
[1:05] put it up on the shelf
[1:07] and then last month i was studying and
[1:09] preparing and i felt led to look at this
[1:11] book by a man named kevin j connor
[1:14] called the tabernacle of david here's a
[1:16] picture of it
[1:22] i was reading through the book and then
[1:23] i saw conor's timeline for old testament
[1:26] revivals from the days of solomon to the
[1:29] days of john the baptist
[1:31] i felt through that picture the lord
[1:33] helped me understand that the ages of
[1:36] the israeli kings of the old testament
[1:38] were foreshadowing the new testament
[1:40] church ages
[1:41] so i thank the lord that as we wait upon
[1:44] him he dissolves all our doubts and
[1:46] answers all of our questions
[1:48] bible proof for ages
[1:51] friends many people that have left the
[1:53] bible-based message of brother branham
[1:56] who i call accusers of brother branham
[1:58] have claimed there are no such thing as
[2:00] church ages this is a very shallow and
[2:03] weak statement
[2:05] on pages 411 and 412 in my 2021 book i
[2:09] address the subject
[2:11] is the term church ages biblically
[2:13] acceptable
[2:14] yes paul twice says the old testament
[2:17] had ages in ephesians 3 verse 5 and
[2:21] colossians 1 26
[2:23] so it's apparent the 2000 year new
[2:25] testament time period has ages as well
[2:28] the apostle paul speaks of future ages
[2:31] beyond his in ephesians 3 21
[2:34] unto him be glory in the church by jesus
[2:37] christ throughout all ages world without
[2:40] end
[2:41] if there are past and future ages there
[2:44] must always be ages
[2:46] ephesians 3 5 says which in other ages
[2:49] was not made known unto the sons of men
[2:52] of course paul speaking of the old
[2:54] testament ages
[2:56] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[2:58] apostles and prophets by the holy spirit
[3:02] of course paul is talking about how the
[3:03] gospel going to the gentiles was not
[3:06] made known during the previous ages of
[3:09] the old testament
[3:10] in colossians 1 verse 26 paul says the
[3:13] doctrine of the baptism of the holy
[3:15] ghost was not known in previous ages or
[3:18] old testament ages
[3:20] even the mystery which hath been hid
[3:22] from ages and from generations but is
[3:24] now made manifest to his saints
[3:27] skipping ahead to verse 27 which is
[3:29] christ in you the hope of glory
[3:32] so see friends it is undeniable the old
[3:35] testament had ages
[3:37] the new testament has ages and there
[3:39] will be ages all throughout eternity
[3:42] brother branham's quote about old
[3:43] testament church ages
[3:46] let's listen to brother ram's quote from
[3:47] 1954 the seal of god and you'll see as
[3:50] he wonderfully identifies that solomon's
[3:53] age was the beginning of the old
[3:55] testament church
[3:58] ages it begins with the church of edison
[4:02] then the second church eighth the third
[4:05] church age the fourth church age the
[4:07] fifteen hundred years of dark ages out
[4:10] through the lutheran age philadelphia
[4:12] age and down into the latest dna the
[4:14] light thing
[4:15] seeing in the old testament how they
[4:17] were perfectly typed at the beginning of
[4:19] silence all down to at the time of ahab
[4:22] the dark age and found out as jesse bell
[4:27] ahead a borderline preacher
[4:29] or a man who was on and off
[4:32] just like a lot of lukewarm church
[4:34] members today
[4:36] people
[4:37] on and off in the church today tomorrow
[4:39] get them anywhere
[4:41] compromising letting down
[4:44] going with the world yet calling himself
[4:47] christians and ahab and that condition
[4:49] fell for a beautiful little woman so
[4:53] wicked is all get out
[4:55] and
[4:56] later and brought idolatry into israel
[5:00] right in the darkest
[5:01] irons of israel
[5:04] dark
[5:05] now
[5:06] we find out that they come out of there
[5:08] with a blast standing on out and finally
[5:10] lukewarm down to god spewed him from his
[5:13] mouth and accepted the gentiles
[5:16] now we find out that he start off from
[5:18] the first in the ephesians church in the
[5:21] beginning of the church age the next
[5:23] turkeys begin to cool off and get
[5:25] lukewarm went on in and the dark age and
[5:28] just as
[5:30] as
[5:31] that day ahab marrying of idolater
[5:35] jezebel and brought idolatry into israel
[5:38] then protestantism marriage romanism
[5:42] catholicism and brought our dollar
[5:43] dreams of church come out to martin
[5:45] luther down to john wesley over into
[5:48] pentecost and out in
[5:51] from god's mouth and god points back to
[5:53] the jews again
[5:54] [Music]
[5:57] comparing timelines
[6:00] now friends let's look at brother
[6:01] branham's timeline
[6:03] for the new testament church ages which
[6:05] it seems he got a lot of the dates from
[6:07] clarence larkin
[6:08] as he said he got his dates from
[6:10] historians
[6:11] and let's compare it to kevin j connor's
[6:13] timeline for the old testament church
[6:15] ages
[6:16] from the time of solomon to john the
[6:18] baptist so here's the picture i saw in
[6:21] conor's book on page 148
[6:25] he identifies solomon as the first age
[6:27] jehoshaphat as the second
[6:30] amos chapter 9 as the third hezekiah as
[6:33] the fourth josiah's age as the fifth
[6:36] ezra's age as the sixth and nehemiah's
[6:40] as the seventh
[6:42] notice that last age lasted until the
[6:45] early church
[6:47] in 46 a.d
[6:49] so here's a comparison of the old
[6:51] testament ages with the new testament
[6:53] ages
[6:54] on the bottom of course you can see
[6:56] the church ages that brother branham
[6:58] identified through the help of the holy
[7:00] spirit and clarence larkin it's
[7:02] important to keep in mind that the old
[7:03] testament ages lasted only a thousand
[7:06] years and the new testament church ages
[7:08] have lasted double about two thousand
[7:10] years
[7:12] it's also notable how the last ages are
[7:15] shorter as well
[7:16] note how both the new testament old
[7:18] testament ages had one age that was much
[7:21] longer than the others
[7:22] so in the new testament we know it's the
[7:24] thyroid church age which was about 914
[7:27] years almost a millennium brother
[7:30] branham called it satan's millennium
[7:32] in the old testament ages it's likely
[7:34] the sixth age was the longest age
[7:36] which would have been ezra's age
[7:39] all the way up to the time of john the
[7:40] baptist
[7:42] my understanding of the messengers
[7:46] as i studied this subject i saw a great
[7:48] correlation between four of the old
[7:50] testament messengers and four of the new
[7:52] testament messengers here's a visual so
[7:55] you can see what i'm referring to
[7:57] i can see a great correlation between
[7:59] paul and solomon
[8:01] you'll see with the second third fourth
[8:04] sixth and seventh old testament
[8:05] messengers i did not agree with our
[8:08] christian brother kevin j connor but i
[8:10] believe the second messenger was likely
[8:12] jehoshaphat i agree with him there i
[8:14] thought the third was probably usia
[8:17] and after studying the scripture i
[8:18] thought hezekiah was the fourth
[8:21] i believe josiah can be proven was the
[8:24] fifth
[8:24] ezra could be proven as the sixth and i
[8:27] believe john the baptist would be proven
[8:29] as the last old testament messenger
[8:33] i'll briefly go through the reasons why
[8:35] i think these four men from the old
[8:37] testament foreshadowed the four
[8:39] messengers from the new testament and
[8:42] i'll leave a link in the description if
[8:43] you want to listen to the complete
[8:44] sermons on this subject i think i
[8:47] preached three or four sermons on this
[8:48] topic
[8:50] paul and solomon had very strong
[8:52] similarities for example
[8:54] both men were master builders
[8:57] one in the natural solomon building the
[8:58] temple and one in the spiritual as paul
[9:02] said in first corinthians 3 verse 10
[9:06] according to the grace of god which is
[9:07] given unto me as a wise master builder i
[9:10] have laid the foundation and another
[9:12] buildeth thereon but let every man take
[9:14] heed how he buildeth thereon
[9:17] also both men solomon and paul wrote the
[9:20] inspired word of god paul wrote numerous
[9:23] epistles for us and solomon wrote
[9:25] numerous books of the bible for us
[9:28] both ages were warned to return to their
[9:30] first love
[9:32] god warned solomon not to fall away from
[9:34] his first love but we know he did
[9:36] at the beginning of his life solomon had
[9:38] one love
[9:39] in song of solomon 6 verse 9 he said my
[9:42] dove my undefiled is but one
[9:44] but then later we know he left his first
[9:47] love and had many wives first kings 11
[9:50] verse 4 said for it came to pass when
[9:52] solomon was old that his wives turned
[9:55] away his heart after other gods and we
[9:57] also know in 1st kings 11 verse 3
[10:00] solomon went from one love to one
[10:02] thousand loves having a thousand wives
[10:04] and concubines
[10:06] so solomon started on fire but he left
[10:09] his first love
[10:10] and we know the ephesian church age
[10:12] according to the words of jesus left
[10:14] their first love but by god's grace he
[10:16] gave them a way back remember repent and
[10:19] do the first works
[10:21] next both ages had the candlestick
[10:23] removed from their cities
[10:25] historically the candlestick was removed
[10:27] out of ephesus as the prophet teaches us
[10:30] in the church age book and the
[10:32] candlestick was removed from the nation
[10:34] of israel eventually as well so i truly
[10:36] believe this old testament age typed the
[10:39] ephesian church age
[10:42] in the second age with iranians and
[10:44] jehoshaphat i do not see as many major
[10:47] obvious types and shadows as the first
[10:49] age
[10:50] but i'll keep an open heart and perhaps
[10:51] the lord will show us a different
[10:52] messenger
[10:54] but i did see how both men had gifts of
[10:56] the spirit operating
[10:58] and both men sought the lord and
[10:59] condemned idolatry
[11:02] history said iranians had all the gifts
[11:04] of the spirit through his teaching in
[11:06] france's churches and resisted the
[11:08] idolatry of false roman bishops and he
[11:11] also had the true godhead teaching
[11:13] jehoshaphat had peace prosperity and
[11:16] supernatural deliverance through the
[11:17] gift of prophecy
[11:19] and through the removal of idolatry and
[11:22] seeking the lord
[11:24] in the third church age
[11:25] again it's like the previous age or the
[11:27] second age i don't see
[11:30] major similarities i only see minor
[11:32] so i'm hoping the lord will reveal more
[11:34] about this
[11:35] age later
[11:36] but i do see some similarities
[11:39] both ages show decline martin was a
[11:42] trinitarian but a tremendous man of god
[11:45] uzziah didn't reach the peace and
[11:47] prosperity of jehoshaphat according to
[11:49] the scripture
[11:50] also both men were builders martin built
[11:53] schools and sent out godly holy
[11:55] ghost-filled men
[11:56] and usia built engines and towers to
[11:59] keep israel strong and safe and
[12:01] protected
[12:02] also both men were famous for their good
[12:04] deeds
[12:06] in the fourth church age columba and
[12:08] hezekiah it's like the other previous
[12:11] two ages the second third i don't see
[12:14] many major similarities only minor so i
[12:16] could be wrong on this
[12:18] the similarities i saw were both men
[12:20] were known as the most godly men columba
[12:24] was compared to jesus disciples
[12:26] according to brother branham and
[12:27] hezekiah was honored above all other
[12:30] kings outside of david and solomon
[12:33] colombo was a powerful missionary
[12:35] likened unto jesus apostles he preserved
[12:38] the written word making the reformation
[12:40] possible his college sustained
[12:42] evangelism for over 700 years
[12:45] hezekiah led a great reformation he
[12:48] restored the altar the temple and
[12:50] worship after the wicked ahaz
[12:53] he destroyed the brass serpent
[12:55] he had a miraculous personal healing but
[12:57] sadly at the end of his life he was
[12:58] deceived by babylonian ambassadors and
[13:01] had a post-mature death
[13:03] in the fifth church age i see a very
[13:05] strong type between luther and josiah
[13:12] i see major similarities here such as
[13:15] first both men majored on justification
[13:19] or the passover the passover would
[13:21] represent justification because there
[13:23] was three feasts right in a row passover
[13:26] unleavened bread and first fruits
[13:28] so justification sanctification baptism
[13:30] of the holy ghost and josiah had a major
[13:34] passover celebration just like martin
[13:36] luther majored on justification
[13:39] second kings 23 verses 21 and 22
[13:42] say how there was not hold in such a
[13:44] passover from the days of the judges
[13:46] that judged israel nor in all the days
[13:48] of the kings of israel nor of the kings
[13:50] of judah
[13:52] next both men brought their generations
[13:54] out of spiritual darkness through the
[13:56] revelations of the written word
[13:58] we know martin luther helped bring the
[14:00] church out of the dark ages
[14:02] through his revelations on justification
[14:04] and many other topics he wrote many
[14:06] tracks which raised the faith of the
[14:08] people that day and set the spiritual
[14:10] captives free
[14:11] and he also translated the bible so he
[14:14] placed the written word back in the
[14:15] hands of the people josiah did the same
[14:18] in second kings 22 verse 8 the book of
[14:20] the law was found in the house of the
[14:22] lord it was given
[14:24] to shaphan and he read it to josiah
[14:26] josiah hears it he rents his clothes and
[14:29] god recognizes his humble tender heart
[14:32] and his tears and then he read the law
[14:35] to the people and restored the covenant
[14:37] so luther brought the restored word out
[14:39] of spiritual darkness and josiah brought
[14:41] the written word out of natural darkness
[14:44] into the light
[14:45] and third both men reform the true
[14:47] church
[14:48] martin luther is the most famous of the
[14:50] reformation ministers
[14:52] and again josiah reformed the church by
[14:54] restoring the law the covenant and the
[14:56] feasts in the sixth age i again see
[14:59] major similarities here i believe this
[15:01] is a true type with john wesley and ezra
[15:04] as the messengers to the age
[15:06] their similarities are both men preached
[15:08] or read the word in the open air format
[15:12] both men brought sanctification back to
[15:14] the people
[15:16] both men were thoroughly trained and
[15:17] prepared for their ministries
[15:19] both men enjoyed a god ordained open
[15:22] door of ministry with little resistance
[15:24] from the enemy and government
[15:27] and lastly the seventh age i see very
[15:29] strong similarities here between
[15:31] brother william branham and the church
[15:33] ages and john the baptist in the old
[15:35] testament
[15:37] and of course the major similarity is
[15:39] that they both had the spirit of elijah
[15:42] and prepared the way of the lord
[15:44] please see my five part video series
[15:47] that show william branham was the
[15:48] messenger of this day one of those
[15:50] videos shows how brother branham had the
[15:53] same elijah characteristics as john the
[15:56] baptist and elijah
[16:00] both men turned the hearts of believers
[16:02] john turned the hearts of the fathers to
[16:04] the children according to luke 1 17 and
[16:07] brother branham turned the hearts of the
[16:09] children to the apostolic fathers
[16:11] as he restored all things according to
[16:13] matthew 17 verse 11 and he turned the
[16:16] hearts of the children back to the
[16:17] fathers according to malachi chapter 4
[16:19] verses 5 and 6. the three types in the
[16:23] old testament of the new testament
[16:25] church ages
[16:27] the first type friends is moses's golden
[16:29] candlesticks
[16:31] the menorah was a type of the gentile
[16:33] church ages we know this because in
[16:35] revelation chapter 1 jesus stands in the
[16:38] midst of the candlesticks
[16:40] and then he tells us these candlesticks
[16:41] are the seven gentile cities
[16:44] ephesus smyrna pergamos thyratira sardis
[16:48] philadelphia and laodicea
[16:51] and the bible also says these are the
[16:53] times of the gentiles
[16:56] the book of acts says paul and barnabas
[16:58] left the jews to go to the gentiles to
[17:00] take a people out for his name's sake in
[17:03] other words god was getting a gentile
[17:05] bride ready to be married to his son
[17:08] jesus christ
[17:10] and this wedding takes place in the air
[17:12] at the rapture the wedding ceremony
[17:14] takes place in heaven at the marriage
[17:16] supper of the lamb and the honeymoon is
[17:18] the one thousand year millennium on the
[17:20] earth as detailed in revelation chapter
[17:22] 20.
[17:24] the second type is joshua's seven
[17:26] chapter book
[17:27] the holy spirit revealed this type to my
[17:29] brother simon as he was studying and
[17:30] preparing meditating on the church age
[17:33] book in joshua 18 there are seven
[17:36] remaining tribes that had not possessed
[17:38] their land
[17:39] so before joshua died he sent out men to
[17:41] go investigate the land describe it and
[17:44] bring it back and write it in a book
[17:46] through those seven descriptions of the
[17:48] land joshua divides the land to the
[17:51] remaining seven tribes
[17:53] it's a beautiful type of how the prophet
[17:55] had a written book about seven tribes
[17:58] before he passed in order for them to
[18:00] possess the promises of god for their
[18:02] lives
[18:03] that's exactly what happened in brother
[18:05] branham's day brother branham had to
[18:07] finish the seven church age book right
[18:09] before he passed away in order for the
[18:11] people to understand the seven church
[18:13] ages
[18:14] to see how the previous six ages had
[18:16] possessed their promises and how the
[18:18] seventh age needed to possess the
[18:20] promises before the return of jesus
[18:22] christ
[18:24] and the third type of course is the
[18:25] kings of the old testament which this
[18:27] video is all about
[18:29] in closing friends i hope this video has
[18:31] been an encouragement to you it's really
[18:33] encouraged me that the lord was able to
[18:35] answer a question i had
[18:36] that i left on the shelf for many years
[18:39] it proves that as jesus said the holy
[18:41] ghost will lead and guide you into all
[18:42] truth
[18:44] although i still have a question on
[18:45] three of the messengers i can clearly
[18:47] see how four of them are directly
[18:48] related to the new testament church ages
[18:51] and what a blessing that is
[18:53] we're trusting as time goes on if the
[18:55] lord tarries the lord will reveal more
[18:57] and more about his word we'll become
[18:59] more established in the faith we become
[19:01] more sure of our faith more established
[19:03] in the faith and fall more in love with
[19:05] jesus christ in his word
[19:08] if you have any questions concerns or
[19:10] testimonies about this video please
[19:12] contact me
[19:13] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[19:16] the desire of your heart
