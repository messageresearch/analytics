[38:52] i'm going to let you know why i am
[38:54] angry okay would you stand with me
[38:58] this morning and uh
[39:01] we'd just like to pray first before we
[39:03] open to our scripture
[39:06] we'll be reading first of all in
[39:09] proverbs chapter 29 and verse 18.
[39:13] and it'll take a while to get to my text
[39:15] but it's there
[39:16] we'll get there and i'm going to read
[39:18] some things i think will be very
[39:20] interesting to you
[39:21] and eye-opening i do believe this
[39:25] heavenly father now as we are opening
[39:28] your word the pages of your word
[39:31] lord we're asking you to speak to us
[39:34] through your word
[39:36] lord we know this is jesus christ in
[39:39] printed form and lord we rely
[39:42] on that printed word but we need the
[39:45] holy ghost to make that word come alive
[39:48] to our hearts
[39:49] and lord i pray this morning that you
[39:51] would give me a clear
[39:52] utterance of speech and just one more
[39:55] time
[39:56] as i report to duty lord that you would
[39:58] hide me behind the cross of calvary
[40:01] give me the right words to speak this
[40:03] morning for we ask it in jesus christ's
[40:06] name
[40:07] amen before we even open the scripture
[40:10] before i read the script
[40:11] and say the things i'm going to say this
[40:13] morning i want you to know
[40:15] we have the devil's answer yes i'm
[40:18] going to be standing for a moment before
[40:20] i read this we have the devil's answer
[40:22] yes and when jesus was on the mount
[40:25] being tempted
[40:26] when satan came at him you know what he
[40:28] did each time he
[40:30] he didn't use supernatural powers he
[40:32] said
[40:33] it is written it is written
[40:36] it is written in this written bible will
[40:39] defeat the devil
[40:41] anywhere anytime and wherever it is
[40:44] we have the devil's answer right here
[40:47] amen
[40:48] amen amen now in proverbs chapter 29 to
[40:51] get started
[40:53] where there is no vision the people
[40:56] perish
[40:56] but he that keepeth the law happy is he
[41:00] now you may be seated may god add his
[41:03] blessings to the reading of his word the
[41:06] title of this message this morning
[41:08] is perplexity in the valley
[41:11] of vision we'll get to our text
[41:16] in a little while but we want to start
[41:19] here
[41:20] because we see the scripture says
[41:24] where there is no vision the people
[41:28] perish a vision
[41:31] is a prophecy or divine
[41:35] communication able to perceive
[41:39] the past present and the future what it
[41:43] it is god's intelligence amen
[41:47] you know it's god's intelligence that
[41:49] causes
[41:50] in the fall it's going to be long that
[41:52] that that the trees will
[41:55] uh god's great funeral service
[41:58] the trees will turn and fall off and the
[42:00] sack will go down in the roof god's
[42:02] intelligence or
[42:03] didn't the tree would die in the little
[42:07] insects everything has an intelligence
[42:09] has a spirit
[42:10] and it's god's intelligence that does
[42:12] this
[42:13] and it's god's intelligence that's
[42:16] leading the bride of jesus christ
[42:19] in this hour amen now
[42:25] now see as it was in the days of samuel
[42:32] there was no open vision
[42:35] and with that the people perish
[42:38] we must have a visa
[42:41] and the vision comes to the prophets
[42:46] it's the word of the lord that's spoken
[42:48] to them
[42:50] amen you know don't want to miss
[42:53] anything here so we'll just
[42:55] go on now think about this
[43:00] i posted this on facebook it's i think
[43:02] it's so beautiful
[43:03] did you know the only the only bird
[43:07] that'll fly on the back of an eagle is a
[43:10] crow
[43:13] you can find pictures of a crow flying
[43:15] on the back but you know
[43:16] the eagle does not get mad
[43:20] the eagle don't try to shake him off the
[43:23] eagle just flies
[43:25] and higher and higher where the crow
[43:28] has no oxygen and he just falls amen
[43:33] so the bible says be angry
[43:37] and sin not amen don't let the rat don't
[43:39] let
[43:40] the don't let it uh the sun go down on
[43:43] your wrath
[43:44] and never give place to the devil so
[43:46] yeah i'm gonna tell you i am angry this
[43:48] morning
[43:49] i'm angry at the devil and what is going
[43:51] on
[43:52] you know that's you know brother branham
[43:55] said
[43:55] so many hard to live a christian life
[43:58] now i
[43:59] i'm gonna take a while this morning you
[44:01] bear with me
[44:02] because i got things to say it's a sad
[44:05] sight one of the saddest i've ever seen
[44:07] but i see
[44:08] a sight in phoenix the world over
[44:09] there's a mosaic site that
[44:12] i see men and women who were born to be
[44:15] sons and daughters of god and who are
[44:17] caged by the devil
[44:18] and to see them walking the streets and
[44:20] lust and passion
[44:22] caged in by the devil when really they
[44:25] would be free sons and daughters
[44:27] brother venom talk about those he saw
[44:30] those eagles caged up and it was a sad
[44:32] sight
[44:32] that was in the cincinnati zoo i and
[44:35] i've been to the cincinnati zoo
[44:38] probably not long after he said that and
[44:40] i saw those same eagles that were
[44:43] they were caged up in that cage
[44:46] which was meant to fly but they was
[44:48] caged
[44:49] and they could not fly so an eagle could
[44:53] fly
[44:53] higher than any bird there is there's no
[44:56] bird can climb where the eagle flies and
[44:58] neither was
[44:59] any man whether he was a teacher
[45:01] evangelist
[45:02] patcher who could climb to the spot
[45:05] where the profits went
[45:07] for they went up higher you go
[45:10] the further you can see some things i'm
[45:13] going to put off this side because i got
[45:15] my notes mixed up a little bit because i
[45:16] added two
[45:17] took away and added two this morning and
[45:19] last night and
[45:21] so you bear with me and we're going to
[45:23] get to something that's very interesting
[45:25] something that was written 300 years ago
[45:30] all right we're going to get there now
[45:32] also now now listen
[45:35] without a vision that people perish you
[45:37] take the word perish
[45:39] in the hebrew it's pera p-a-r-i
[45:42] you know what that means people don't
[45:44] perish without a leader
[45:47] evil men and seducers shall wax worse
[45:49] and worse deceiving in being deceived
[45:52] is to lead act as the leader to loosen
[45:56] all the restraints through neglect
[45:59] that's why the bible said how shall we
[46:01] escape
[46:03] if we neglect so great
[46:06] a salvation neglect
[46:09] i believe as the bride of jesus christ
[46:12] where i go
[46:13] everywhere there is a spirit of neglect
[46:17] it's so common anymore we're so
[46:20] happy in our find home soon
[46:24] and very soon that will end
[46:28] because we're going to find out we're
[46:29] going to give types to tell you
[46:31] exactly in in a little bit now
[46:35] you know matthew 7 13 says enter you in
[46:38] at the straight gate you know what the
[46:40] s-t-r-a-i-t
[46:42] is a waterway it's not straight like a
[46:46] straight line
[46:47] straight there is a waterway
[46:50] what is that waterway
[46:53] right here
[46:57] straight is the gate
[47:02] for why is the gate and broad is the way
[47:05] that lead it
[47:06] to destruction and many be that go
[47:09] in now another thing the word uh
[47:13] parish also means
[47:17] to be found naked the laodicean
[47:20] church age rich i was told my wife we
[47:24] was going down the street this is this
[47:25] is
[47:26] outstanding i remember as a little boy
[47:29] i probably won about nine or ten my dad
[47:32] was i i was raised in the southern
[47:34] baptist church and my dad
[47:36] mowed the grass and he start up that big
[47:39] lawnmower
[47:40] and he had sent me on that lawnmower and
[47:42] i'd blow that grass up i won about 10
[47:44] years old
[47:45] afterwards he gave me enough money
[47:48] to cut up the side street to what they
[47:51] called the dairy aisle
[47:52] and i'd get me a fritos and an ice cream
[47:55] cone
[47:56] but i had to walk through the catholic
[47:59] church
[47:59] big building but we were going down the
[48:03] street looking at some of these catholic
[48:05] church out in the country
[48:06] they're very small not much but you look
[48:09] at the big
[48:10] protestant churches the charismatic
[48:12] they're huge baptists
[48:13] they're huge they've got something for
[48:16] everybody they got for the door

[48:20] for the gays and everything else now
[48:22] they've got everything blind naked rich
[48:26] and they don't even know it that's a sad
[48:31] sons should been sons and daughters of
[48:34] god but they're blinded
[48:35] by religion and religion is a covering
[48:39] [Music]
[48:43] i'm not just talking in the protestant
[48:45] churches right

[48:49] churches on if you know what i have
[48:51] experienced in my travels
[48:53] and what i've seen and what i heard

[49:11] bible says in hebrews 4 12 neither
[49:14] is there any creature that is not
[49:16] manifest in his sight

[49:31] not even try it it won't work

[49:51] his word
[49:52] back god's word is forever settled in
[49:55] heaven

[57:43] the gentiles
[57:45] he is a life-giver and also a judge
[57:50] a separation it's separating time
[57:53] amen it's like joshua
[57:56] down in jericho i said you know you know
[57:59] the new testament
[58:02] meaning of jericho was an alluring
[58:04] fragrance but the old testament means
[58:08] many moons jericho

[58:13] of gods
[58:14] that's about the way we got today all
[58:16] kinds of gods

[58:37] buffett said that and jericho was
[58:40] right in line for judgment every nation
[58:44] in the world
[58:45] today is a line of god's judgment
[58:49] amen i can't people say well it's the
[58:51] united states i know that you know
[58:53] it's every nation every nation
[58:57] yes every nation is line of judgment
[59:01] and that's a little rehab harlot you
[59:04] know
[59:04] can you imagine she entertained those
[59:08] spies and kept them
[59:09] and she only had one plea when they left
[59:12] that her house would be saved
[59:14] and she put that little line outside
[59:16] that scarlet line that thread
[59:19] and when they when the destroying angel
[59:22] comes and
[59:23] he'll see that and he'll pass over your
[59:25] get everybody you can into that house
[59:28] you know and she was saved she had to be
[59:31] saved
[59:32] you know that it was god's
[59:33] predestinative plan because through that
[59:35] line would come jesus christ amen

[1:02:50] i was feeling pretty bad
[1:02:54] about a month ago i was having trouble
[1:02:56] breathing
[1:02:58] and that's why i went to the doctor and
[1:03:00] he found that seven millimeter
[1:03:03] nodule on my lung and he said don't
[1:03:05] worry about it
[1:03:06] and my brother frank ward we worked
[1:03:08] together and asbestos for years
[1:03:11] and he said i that's what worried him
[1:03:14] wasn't from smoking
[1:03:15] but i worked in asbestos for years but
[1:03:17] the doctor said don't worry about
[1:03:18] it so he sent me the hospital for that
[1:03:21] nuclear
[1:03:23] uh stress test and got moved even in
[1:03:27] that
[1:03:28] and sister sherian in mansfield
[1:03:31] this is how bad it was she was she was
[1:03:34] saying what am i going to do if he
[1:03:35] passes out
[1:03:36] in the pulpit the way i was breathing
[1:03:39] she's a registered
[1:03:40] nurse and what was she going to do well
[1:03:43] i ain't got no problem now god's touched
[1:03:46] me again
[1:03:47] i've been dead and come back to life and
[1:03:50] i'm still here
[1:03:52] i'm still finished i'm going to tell you
[1:03:54] why i'm angry
[1:03:55] in a minute see
[1:03:59] there's a little minority that believes
[1:04:02] the word
[1:04:03] i believe in a bride's revival
[1:04:07] i believe in a third pole ministry
[1:04:11] i believe the third call was a
[1:04:13] revelation of the seven seals as the
[1:04:15] prophet said
[1:04:16] but i believe there's a revival and i've
[1:04:18] received that message in my heart
[1:04:21] amen as the prophet said we know
[1:04:25] what defending okay we know what the
[1:04:27] vindication is
[1:04:28] yeah and we know what the third pull is
[1:04:32] yeah now this is not exactly i'm just my
[1:04:35] memory
[1:04:36] and he said i believe it'll lay dormant
[1:04:41] foresee you know what dormant is it's
[1:04:43] alive
[1:04:45] but it come but it's been like
[1:04:47] something's got to happen
[1:04:48] to manifest come out yes it'll lay
[1:04:51] dormant for a season
[1:04:53] until that great persecution comes and
[1:04:56] it'll be manifested perfectly like those
[1:04:58] five
[1:04:58] times i ain't looking for brother
[1:05:00] branham to come back in the return
[1:05:02] ministry
[1:05:03] i believe that ministry is for the bride
[1:05:06] and the prophet said that the bride of
[1:05:08] jesus christ
[1:05:09] will will manifest everything that was
[1:05:12] written about her
[1:05:14] in the new testament amen jesus christ
[1:05:18] fulfilled the old testament the bride
[1:05:20] will fulfill
[1:05:21] the new testament hallelujah i
[1:05:24] thank god i'm a part of it amen
[1:05:31] we are in the bright age
[1:05:34] they're going homey
[1:05:38] no more the word of noah wesley luther
[1:05:42] or any of them but we are in the bright
[1:05:45] age
[1:05:47] that message was for you
[1:05:51] for me wasn't necessarily for brother
[1:05:54] branham
[1:05:55] it was for you and for me he brought it
[1:05:58] to me eleazar when abraham
[1:06:02] is an eliaser to get a bride for isaac
[1:06:08] lord it wasn't for him one for elias
[1:06:12] he was just a messenger boy
[1:06:15] and what he did he went
[1:06:20] was it she just said yes i'll go
[1:06:25] and when they went back all along on the
[1:06:27] way back
[1:06:28] he told her all about it yeah
[1:06:37] he was out in the field
[1:06:42] and she went to meet him yes and he took
[1:06:45] her
[1:06:46] into his mother's house
[1:06:50] and they became one that's right and one
[1:06:53] of these days
[1:06:54] we're going to meet in the field in the
[1:06:58] clouds amen
[1:07:00] the lord himself shall descend from
[1:07:02] heaven with a shout
[1:07:03] with the voice of the archangel and the
[1:07:06] trump of god shall
[1:07:07] sign sound and the dead
[1:07:10] in christ shall rise first and we
[1:07:14] who are alive and remaining shall be
[1:07:16] caught up
[1:07:17] together to meet in the near brother man
[1:07:20] who said they'll be
[1:07:21] wave after wave after wave and we'll be
[1:07:24] caught up but i believe there's going to
[1:07:25] be a reunion first
[1:07:28] here on earth
[1:07:31] there's a little system i'm gonna get to
[1:07:34] in a minute hold on

[1:07:39] widows indeed

[1:09:49] you know in the valley i'm talking about
[1:09:53] perplexity in the valley of vision yes
[1:09:56] in the valley i don't know if you've
[1:10:00] ever watched an old movie called
[1:10:01] sergeant york
[1:10:04] back in the 50s he he actually made sure
[1:10:07] that that movie was
[1:10:08] right sergeant york
[1:10:11] was the most decorated
[1:10:15] soldier at world war one he was from
[1:10:18] jamestown
[1:10:19] tennessee and my father-in-law was from
[1:10:22] jamestown tennessee
[1:10:24] and he remembers sergeant wasn't
[1:10:26] sergeant york
[1:10:27] but he remembers him and he said he was
[1:10:31] a
[1:10:31] he was a jacob he was a shyster he
[1:10:34] remembers him bringing a
[1:10:36] taped up pumpkin you know to
[1:10:39] to the fair tried to enter it in tried
[1:10:41] to win
[1:10:42] a drunkard but god saved him amen
[1:10:47] and he was up on the mountainside
[1:10:50] he was he didn't want to kill he didn't
[1:10:54] want to fight
[1:10:55] but he was drafted into the army and man
[1:10:58] was he a sharpshooter
[1:11:01] he was drafted into the army
[1:11:06] in they went to the firing range
[1:11:10] man he he didn't need no instruction
[1:11:14] old tennessee hillbilly and
[1:11:17] you know and he still
[1:11:21] didn't want to fight you know the bible
[1:11:25] page is opening
[1:11:26] up he was on the mountainside praying
[1:11:29] and the pages opened up of the bible
[1:11:33] render under the caesars what is
[1:11:35] caesar's under god what is god
[1:11:38] and he went back he told his
[1:11:41] commanding officer i don't know
[1:11:45] whether i can kill or not
[1:11:48] but he went and it told how many he
[1:11:53] killed
[1:11:55] a whole troop prisoner
[1:11:59] and they asking
[1:12:02] how could you kill that many
[1:12:06] why did you do it i said i did it to
[1:12:08] save lives
[1:12:09] yes
[1:12:12] and sometimes we have to shoot down the
[1:12:16] enemy
[1:12:18] to save lives amen amen we have to
[1:12:22] bring down the enemy but you know what
[1:12:23] he said he was on the mountain
[1:12:26] but the richest ground was in the valley
[1:12:29] so expensive
[1:12:33] i was invited for a baby dedication
[1:12:36] brother
[1:12:40] july soleyak i asked him one time was
[1:12:43] you born in july he said yes i was born
[1:12:45] in july
[1:12:48] you know i hadn't seen brother july in a
[1:12:50] long time
[1:12:51] i knew him he was related to the
[1:12:53] bulletins
[1:12:55] and i saw him on facebook all i did was
[1:12:59] say a simple words to him
[1:13:01] the right words and the next trip he was
[1:13:03] back
[1:13:04] singing he said would you come
[1:13:09] can you come and climb a few steps
[1:13:14] for my grand son's or granddaughter
[1:13:17] remember dedication and when i went
[1:13:22] you understand in baguio everything's on
[1:13:24] a hill
[1:13:27] it wasn't a few steps it was like a
[1:13:30] highway to heaven
[1:13:33] oh my goodness i'm already tired i got
[1:13:35] bad feet and got bad legs
[1:13:37] i said i can do it i climbed and climbed
[1:13:40] and climbed and climbed and climbed
[1:13:43] and just a little bit more found out we
[1:13:46] could turn the corner and there it was
[1:13:48] but they you could even win a higher you
[1:13:50] know why
[1:13:51] way up there it's cheaper
[1:13:54] than down here the lowland area is
[1:13:58] always more
[1:13:59] because it's rich it's rich
[1:14:02] in the valley scene in the valley
[1:14:08] and before we go and i'm going to read
[1:14:09] this i'm almost at my text
[1:14:14] brother brandon said we know we're here
[1:14:16] in a negative form
[1:14:18] and as long as there is a negative
[1:14:20] remember about a negative impossible
[1:14:22] there
[1:14:22] has to be a positive there cannot be a
[1:14:24] negative without a positive because it's
[1:14:26] because of the positive that makes the
[1:14:28] negative
[1:14:29] like you had a negative picture of the
[1:14:30] some object there has to be an object
[1:14:32] somewhere of it to strike the light
[1:14:35] strike the lens there couldn't be any
[1:14:37] negative
[1:14:38] so when you see that our life is here in
[1:14:40] the negative
[1:14:42] knowing that we're here in the image of
[1:14:44] some life somewhere
[1:14:47] then we know that there is a a positive
[1:14:50] somewhere that'll
[1:14:52] that the light has struck and it's
[1:14:54] reflected something here on earth
[1:14:57] and we only we are only
[1:15:00] that reflection the genuine object
[1:15:03] is somewhere amen if that isn't i'm the
[1:15:06] worst deceived man in the world
[1:15:09] i spent my life in vain but i know
[1:15:12] beyond a shadow of a doubt there it is
[1:15:13] that's why we are here
[1:15:15] gloria you know
[1:15:19] i've been i i didn't plan on it when
[1:15:22] that 2017.
[1:15:24] my wife was in the room with me and my
[1:15:26] mum
[1:15:27] it dropped down to nothing and she
[1:15:30] massaging my feet
[1:15:33] and saying keep keep keep and later i
[1:15:35] told her
[1:15:36] i couldn't feel you massaging my feet
[1:15:40] but i could hear your voice she said my
[1:15:43] eyes was wide open like that all the
[1:15:45] time
[1:15:45] i didn't pass out she said you know what
[1:15:48] i was standing next to you
[1:15:50] i was standing i was not in my body and
[1:15:53] i was seeing this great big open room
[1:15:55] and i and i heard voices as they was
[1:15:58] bringing me back
[1:15:59] pleasant voices like women and
[1:16:01] fellowship and i always thought
[1:16:02] could that have been my mother they
[1:16:05] brought me back
[1:16:06] i was almost there almost there to the
[1:16:11] positive
[1:16:12] amen well they've been said how many
[1:16:15] times that the third psalm has been
[1:16:18] misinterpreted but you hear people say
[1:16:21] though we walk
[1:16:22] through the dark valley of the shadow of
[1:16:24] death it doesn't say that
[1:16:26] at all it doesn't even say that at all
[1:16:31] though i walk through the valley of the
[1:16:33] shadow of death darks
[1:16:35] not there at all see though i walk
[1:16:39] through the valley of the shadow
[1:16:41] dark before there could be a shadow
[1:16:45] there has to be a light to reflect the
[1:16:48] shadow
[1:16:48] see what i mean so it has to be light
[1:16:51] waiting there to perfect the shadow
[1:16:56] and the only thing it is it's just a
[1:16:58] shadow
[1:16:59] and there's nobody scared of a shadow
[1:17:02] so that that's all death is to us
[1:17:06] since jesus died in our stead it is
[1:17:09] a shadow just something we pass through
[1:17:12] a little place that's all
[1:17:14] nothing can keep us from the promised
[1:17:16] land god always
[1:17:18] god promised to us jesus died for it
[1:17:22] the holy ghost accepted us sealed us
[1:17:25] into the day of redemption
[1:17:27] and we're on the road and everything's
[1:17:29] got to be
[1:17:31] all right all right i'll tell you what i
[1:17:34] am warming up too much
[1:17:37] okay amen all right
[1:17:41] now get my hanky out
[1:17:45] brother jesse asked i need water
[1:17:48] i said no i try i ain't got time to
[1:17:52] drink water
[1:17:54] but i'll tell you what
[1:17:58] i i i was preaching in a place called
[1:18:03] uh i can't even think of the name now i
[1:18:05] tried to remember back there
[1:18:09] and when i left
[1:18:13] i was going to say uh
[1:18:16] said carlos pagassi now
[1:18:19] brother rancy
[1:18:24] and when i was so hot man i drink water
[1:18:27] there sometimes because i'm so hot i'm
[1:18:29] drained
[1:18:31] and he brought up a a 7-up bottle
[1:18:35] no he brought up a mineral bottle it was
[1:18:37] a mineral bottle i thought it was
[1:18:39] mineral water
[1:18:40] big jug and i drank that whole thing
[1:18:43] so i traveled back to baguio
[1:18:46] that morning i woke up my stomach was
[1:18:49] cramping so bad i said oh
[1:18:51] lord i didn't drink anything but mineral
[1:18:54] water
[1:18:55] and that little guy he's interpreting
[1:18:58] for me and i look over i can't even see
[1:18:59] him he's so
[1:19:00] short you know but uh
[1:19:05] he tried to kill me he didn't know
[1:19:10] that the water in that mineral bottle
[1:19:14] they had drawn it from a well there
[1:19:16] where we were just
[1:19:17] at you can't drink well water you don't
[1:19:20] want to drink the water ball
[1:19:23] and i've been like i say sick
[1:19:26] many times but uh
[1:19:32] i've learned don't drink the water
[1:19:35] and even though i don't drink the water
[1:19:37] something every trip will probably get
[1:19:40] me no matter
[1:19:41] what this weak
[1:19:44] system of americans you know right
[1:19:47] right probably if i lived over there i
[1:19:49] would probably get
[1:19:52] acclimated to what it is
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:55] see now
[1:19:58] all right
[1:20:03] you know the bible says and we said this
[1:20:06] ii corinthians 2 15 for we
[1:20:10] are unto god a sweet savor of christ
[1:20:14] and them that are saved and in them that
[1:20:17] perish
[1:20:18] to one a savior of death unto death and
[1:20:21] another
[1:20:22] life unto life and paul said
[1:20:27] who is sufficient for these things
[1:20:31] what is this death a life became courts
[1:20:34] even though they're still walking around
[1:20:38] zombies so to speak now
[1:20:42] turn with me to isaiah
[1:20:46] the 22nd chapter of isaiah
[1:20:52] to start with amen
[1:20:57] then we'll be looking somewhere else i
[1:20:58] thought i had it marked i'll find
[1:21:00] okay 22nd chapter of isaiah
[1:21:07] starting with verse 1.
[1:21:11] now here we're going to talk about you
[1:21:12] listen this is talking about jerusalem
[1:21:16] this valley is jerusalem not only that
[1:21:19] it is the neighboring cities of judah
[1:21:22] with your beautiful
[1:21:23] lush flowers and everything that was the
[1:21:27] valley
[1:21:28] the burden but the main thing is is
[1:21:30] jerusalem
[1:21:32] the burden of the valley of vision
[1:21:36] you know why it was called the valley of
[1:21:38] vision so much prophecy
[1:21:40] had went over it was a place a wonderful
[1:21:44] place
[1:21:45] what aileth thee now that thou art
[1:21:49] wholly gone up to the housetops
[1:21:52] see something has happened
[1:21:55] thou thou art full of stirs that stirs
[1:21:59] mean
[1:21:59] activity like going from the mall or
[1:22:02] shopping and
[1:22:03] going out to eat and not having to wear
[1:22:06] a mask and
[1:22:08] all this yeah that's right a joyous city
[1:22:12] thy slain men are not slain
[1:22:16] with a sword nor dead in battle
[1:22:22] listen to that first of all
[1:22:26] this is a prelude this versus here is a
[1:22:30] prelude to king nebuchadnezzar
[1:22:33] when he conquers israel it's a prelude
[1:22:37] just like this could be a prelude
[1:22:40] to the great tribulation right all right
[1:22:45] all thy rulers are fled together
[1:22:49] they are bound by the archers
[1:22:53] see there was no protection
[1:22:56] judah the arch they'd all judah had all
[1:23:00] ran down and some went into jerusalem
[1:23:01] and fled the cities
[1:23:03] because of fear as we're going to see in
[1:23:06] a minute
[1:23:06] yes they're fled together they are bound
[1:23:09] by the archers
[1:23:10] all that are found in thee are bound
[1:23:15] together which has fled from far
[1:23:19] therefore said i look away from me i
[1:23:22] will weep bitterly
[1:23:23] labor not to comfort me because of the
[1:23:26] swelling
[1:23:27] of the daughter of my people for it is a
[1:23:30] day of trouble
[1:23:32] and of a treading gown
[1:23:35] of perplexity by the word of god
[1:23:39] of host in the valley of vision
[1:23:44] breaking down the walls
[1:23:48] and of crying to
[1:23:51] the mountains you just hold there
[1:23:56] like i said the bible says multitudes
[1:24:00] multitudes in the valley
[1:24:05] of decision and what is that
[1:24:09] valley it's a steep
[1:24:12] narrow gorge
[1:24:18] depressing and all the rulers and
[1:24:22] multitudes
[1:24:23] roaming in confusion and the visions
[1:24:27] that came
[1:24:28] forth from that violin divine
[1:24:29] communication with god
[1:24:31] and i believe we've had a divine
[1:24:33] communication from god in this age
[1:24:37] and men are trying i can't believe some
[1:24:39] of these men that walked in the message
[1:24:40] for you are leaving the message
[1:24:43] i don't want to be in their shoes
[1:24:45] because most of them when they live
[1:24:48] leave can't keep their mouth shut if
[1:24:50] they leave their mouth shut they'd be
[1:24:52] all right
[1:24:53] but it borders on blasphemy
[1:24:58] now who's got a matthew henry commentary
[1:25:03] my computer do you yes sir
[1:25:06] you know matthew henry uh
[1:25:11] finney read it four times
[1:25:15] the fourth time down on his knees john
[1:25:18] wesley
[1:25:18] wrote a wrote on it spurgeon did
[1:25:24] but he was ahead of his time
[1:25:28] i don't normally push other people's
[1:25:30] messages than the prophet
[1:25:33] but john button was ahead of his time
[1:25:38] if you ever want to read a message the
[1:25:40] baron fig tree
[1:25:42] you ought to read that message you
[1:25:45] thought it was this very day
[1:25:50] now listen first of all
[1:25:54] the reason i like matthew henry
[1:25:58] he wrote this commentary in sev couple
[1:26:00] years 1706
[1:26:02] 1708 something like that
[1:26:05] in his commentary he talks about rome
[1:26:09] being the harlot and the pope
[1:26:12] just like martin luther many did you
[1:26:14] know in
[1:26:15] england it was once against the law to
[1:26:18] say
[1:26:19] that rome was not the heart
[1:26:23] you could be arrested
[1:26:26] it's true you can find it you can look
[1:26:28] it up you'll find it once against the
[1:26:30] law
[1:26:31] now it's all watered down because mama
[1:26:34] don't want nobody talking about
[1:26:36] mama wrong right now and they're
[1:26:40] separated children
[1:26:41] yes it's no longer calling them uh
[1:26:44] reprobates or they call
[1:26:45] our separated brethren they call them
[1:26:47] separated brethren
[1:26:48] because they're all going to come back
[1:26:50] most of them are already back
[1:26:51] even the southern baptist convention
[1:26:53] said we're going to write a dialogue
[1:26:55] what a dialogue is a bridge to come home
[1:26:57] come on back home
[1:27:02] see now listen
[1:27:06] this is quite lengthy but i want you to
[1:27:08] hear it amen
[1:27:12] not only that i like a man
[1:27:15] that walks in the light he came out of a
[1:27:19] home from the church of england
[1:27:22] he was ordained by a group of men called
[1:27:25] the church of non-conformist
[1:27:29] then he went into the presbyterian he
[1:27:31] was walking in the light
[1:27:34] but here now in the burden of the valley
[1:27:37] of vision here
[1:27:38] is that which will quite ruin it but
[1:27:41] only
[1:27:41] frighten it see it was sennacherib you
[1:27:45] know what sacrament meant
[1:27:48] sin the moon
[1:27:52] you know what the moon represents the
[1:27:54] church
[1:27:56] and that great as that eclipse when the
[1:27:59] pope went back to
[1:28:01] uh israel in the eclipse
[1:28:05] and it was dark brother venom said that
[1:28:08] lastly you'll see it was completely dark
[1:28:10] but god allowed him to put that sliver
[1:28:13] of light
[1:28:14] for us but i believe
[1:28:17] it's going back in the total of possibly
[1:28:20] total darkness
[1:28:25] but only frighten it see what are we
[1:28:28] having now
[1:28:29] people are being frightened i don't like
[1:28:32] wearing a mask
[1:28:34] i can't breathe in that mask and i'll
[1:28:37] tell you what i believe it is there's
[1:28:38] more than one people say
[1:28:41] i'll forgive me my own family doctor
[1:28:44] says that math
[1:28:46] math don't protect nothing
[1:28:49] he is a renegade to tell me and my wife
[1:28:52] that
[1:28:54] but when they laid the law down that he
[1:28:56] had to and i went in for my physical he
[1:28:58] had went on and i had one on
[1:29:02] that's right you know what it is
[1:29:08] i listened to rush limbaugh i don't know
[1:29:09] if you do
[1:29:11] but he said what it is it's control that
[1:29:13] we're all under one
[1:29:15] under like a monarchy we've got to do
[1:29:17] this and we got to do that
[1:29:22] now they're talking about it may never
[1:29:24] end
[1:29:27] in 1958 brother branham went on a
[1:29:29] hunting trip
[1:29:31] and they never even got out of the truck
[1:29:34] why they all got sick with the asian flu
[1:29:38] and 158 thousand died of i think it was
[1:29:41] of the asian few
[1:29:43] and nothing was said about it hardly at
[1:29:45] all i've walked in the philippines with
[1:29:47] the swine flu
[1:29:48] have to walk over a mat to clean my feet
[1:29:51] and different things and never got
[1:29:53] stopped but this one stopped why
[1:29:56] politic political i belie you ain't
[1:29:59] gonna like it but i'm gonna tell it
[1:30:01] i believe it was to stop donald trump
[1:30:08] i'm not a politician
[1:30:11] but my daddy was a republican and he
[1:30:14] voted one time
[1:30:16] for jimmy carter because jimmy carter
[1:30:20] was a southern baptist and after jimmy
[1:30:23] carter got elected
[1:30:24] he was so upset and one day i was at his
[1:30:27] house and
[1:30:28] he was complaining about jimmy carter
[1:30:30] and my mother screamed out but you voted
[1:30:33] for him
[1:30:36] right right now listen
[1:30:39] listen to this
[1:30:42] shanakarib was an
[1:30:46] assyrian king heathen king was going out
[1:30:49] conquering and killing
[1:30:51] and neighboring cities
[1:30:57] for he refers not to the destruction of
[1:31:00] jerusalem by nebuchadnezzar
[1:31:03] but to attempt made upon it by
[1:31:05] sennacherib
[1:31:06] which we had the prophecy
[1:31:09] it is here again prophesied up because
[1:31:14] of
[1:31:16] desolations of many of the neighboring
[1:31:19] countries
[1:31:20] as we'll read again in a little bit i'm
[1:31:22] going to finish up
[1:31:25] which were foretold in the foregoing
[1:31:28] chapters
[1:31:30] were to be brought to pass
[1:31:33] by the assyrian army see this was just
[1:31:37] the
[1:31:38] uh i have it somewhere the years
[1:31:43] maybe 70 years 60s maybe 70 80 years
[1:31:46] later
[1:31:47] nebuchadnezzar came in
[1:31:51] now let jerusalem know that when the cup
[1:31:55] is going around it
[1:31:57] will be put in her hand although it will
[1:31:59] not be her fatal cup
[1:32:02] it will be a cup of trembling here it is
[1:32:05] foretold
[1:32:08] now first of all i want you to remember
[1:32:09] ecclesiastes
[1:32:11] 9 it says the thing that has been
[1:32:15] it is shall be and that which is done is
[1:32:18] that which
[1:32:19] has already there is nothing new under
[1:32:21] the sun
[1:32:24] amen consternation
[1:32:27] the city should be upon the reproach
[1:32:30] of sennacherib's army even king
[1:32:36] oh they call it the the china
[1:32:40] virus i don't know how it spread i don't
[1:32:43] know why it's here
[1:32:45] but i do know if you didn't have a tv
[1:32:48] or if you didn't have the internet if
[1:32:50] you didn't have the news media it would
[1:32:52] go on and you would know nothing about
[1:32:54] it
[1:32:54] it would not be any serious than the
[1:32:56] common flu that kills thousand thousand
[1:32:58] people every year
[1:33:00] yes sir the media has publicized it and
[1:33:02] lied about it
[1:33:04] doctors have lied about it it is caused
[1:33:07] what that's what i am angry
[1:33:09] it shut off me from the mission field
[1:33:12] it's cut me off from the people i love
[1:33:16] right it's cuz i'm angry i'm angry at
[1:33:19] the devil

[1:33:23] down on your
[1:33:24] ass neither give place to the devil i
[1:33:27] have not given place to the devil
[1:33:29] i'm mad at him here it is a city of
[1:33:37] great trade
[1:33:38] jerusalem people hurrying to and fro
[1:33:41] about their business
[1:33:43] a tumultuous city populist and noisy
[1:33:48] you know
[1:33:51] i enjoy a good breakfast in the hotel
[1:33:55] and you know what i went down to get my
[1:33:57] breakfast

[1:34:14] gravy
[1:34:15] things have changed
[1:34:19] it's not the same i don't like it
[1:34:23] see where there is great
[1:34:26] trade there is great tumult he used to
[1:34:29] be a
[1:34:29] joyous reveling city things have changed
[1:34:35] what with the busy part and what with
[1:34:37] the merry part of mankind places of
[1:34:39] concourse
[1:34:40] or places of noise but what
[1:34:44] ails now
[1:34:47] yeah great concourse you can almost
[1:34:49] relate that to the airport
[1:34:51] going through now delta
[1:34:55] got nobody sitting in the middle seat i
[1:34:58] get their news all the time
[1:35:00] because i'm waiting to tell me i can fly
[1:35:02] you know
[1:35:04] the shops are acquitted there's no more
[1:35:07] walking in the streets in exchange but
[1:35:09] thou
[1:35:10] has holy gone up to the housetop
[1:35:12] bemoaned thyself in silence
[1:35:16] and solitude to secure their cells from
[1:35:19] the enemy
[1:35:21] or to look abroad and see if any of
[1:35:23] course come to the relief or which way
[1:35:25] the enemies nations
[1:35:26] motions are left both
[1:35:30] men of business and sportsmen
[1:35:34] can you imagine he said sportsman 300
[1:35:37] years ago
[1:35:39] he said sportsman rejoice
[1:35:44] as they rejoice and for something may
[1:35:46] happen
[1:35:47] quickly which they have little to think
[1:35:49] of that will be
[1:35:50] damped to them earth and stop to their
[1:35:52] business you know ain't that
[1:35:54] hypocrisy yes
[1:35:57] i saw it on the internet where the
[1:36:01] head guy of the nfl i'm just relating
[1:36:05] what i read
[1:36:07] he was so mad as he walked some walk up
[1:36:10] the concourse to the field some didn't
[1:36:13] have their mask
[1:36:14] on and they were not uh six feet apart
[1:36:19] i said what hypocrisy they get out on
[1:36:21] the field
[1:36:23] figure no math god and they're hitting
[1:36:26] each other
[1:36:26] slobbering on each other and everything
[1:36:28] else
[1:36:29] something just ain't right
[1:36:36] see to send them to watch as a sparrow
[1:36:41] alone on the housetop but why is
[1:36:44] jerusalem in such a fright
[1:36:47] her slain men are not slain with the
[1:36:50] sword
[1:36:51] their slain was famine why for
[1:36:54] sennacherin's army
[1:36:56] have laid the country waste and
[1:36:58] destroyed the fruits of the earth
[1:37:00] for provisions must needs to be very
[1:37:03] scarce
[1:37:04] and deer in the city which would be
[1:37:06] death to many of the poor of the
[1:37:08] people who would be constrained defeat
[1:37:11] on that which is unwholesome slain with
[1:37:13] fear
[1:37:15] they were put in a fright
[1:37:18] they had not a man killed but so
[1:37:20] dishearten themselves that they seem
[1:37:22] effectively stabbed with fear
[1:37:26] is that they've been run through with a
[1:37:27] sword that's what's going on
[1:37:30] right people's joy is taken away
[1:37:37] i go to my wife sometimes to go to the
[1:37:39] grocery with her i don't even want to go
[1:37:40] because i can't stand to wear that mask
[1:37:42] i keep forgetting to wear it
[1:37:48] don't like to wear it nobody here's got
[1:37:50] one on
[1:37:52] no boy
[1:37:55] what's wrong with you all
[1:37:59] you know what it is
[1:38:03] and then all and then not only that then
[1:38:05] come all the demonstrations
[1:38:11] riot duty
[1:38:14] with martin luther
[1:38:18] martin luther king was killed i'm going
[1:38:20] to say it we got some
[1:38:22] black sisters i was in the army
[1:38:25] i got home korea and
[1:38:30] i was sent and me and my wife got
[1:38:32] married
[1:38:34] to california for the rest of my tour
[1:38:38] i was stationed at a nuclear missile
[1:38:40] base
[1:38:41] on top of chestwork mountain
[1:38:45] and during that time he was killed
[1:38:50] and i was put on riot duty i couldn't go
[1:38:52] i lived off base and received i couldn't
[1:38:54] go home
[1:38:55] i was in charge of the carbines and the
[1:38:58] ammunition
[1:38:59] and i was told give them the carbine but
[1:39:02] don't give them the ammunition
[1:39:04] and i thought my that's going to cause
[1:39:06] confusion and you know at that time i
[1:39:08] was a young guy
[1:39:09] i i i just might have been
[1:39:12] 21 at the time i'm not sure i got
[1:39:14] married uh
[1:39:17] oh i can't remember now i was 20 i think
[1:39:20] yeah you know it's an awful thing when
[1:39:23] you go to the army
[1:39:24] and mom and dad don't have to sign for
[1:39:26] you but you're 20 years old back then
[1:39:29] my mom and dad had the sign for me to
[1:39:30] get married because i was 20 years old
[1:39:33] that was so embarrassing to me
[1:39:36] i could go to vietnam or somewhere and
[1:39:38] get killed and they didn't have to sign
[1:39:41] but they had the sign for me to get
[1:39:42] married
[1:39:43] i guess they thought well guess the
[1:39:44] lawful that was more dangerous than
[1:39:46] getting killed
[1:39:48] it could have been i don't know but you
[1:39:50] know i've been married to the same wife
[1:39:54] this december will be 53 years
[1:39:57] you know and you know she she sent me a
[1:39:59] message
[1:40:00] right before i left she was getting
[1:40:02] ready to go to church
[1:40:04] and she said that the engine light came
[1:40:06] on in her van
[1:40:08] and she said i'm not gonna go
[1:40:12] and i told her she wanted to go so bad
[1:40:15] i said that's probably meant to be
[1:40:18] because you don't know there might have
[1:40:19] been an accident
[1:40:21] found out it was just a low tire but she
[1:40:24] waited so long she couldn't go
[1:40:27] see god protects his own right now see
[1:40:33] see that's why i'm mad and i didn't go
[1:40:36] i i back then back then i was young i
[1:40:39] liked
[1:40:40] i like to fight i admit i did like a
[1:40:43] fight i've told you one of my stories
[1:40:44] about getting knocked out
[1:40:46] by an off duty please and i got another
[1:40:48] scuffles too when i was a young man
[1:40:51] before i was converting i mean i like
[1:40:54] the good fight and i still like a good
[1:40:55] fight now with the devil
[1:40:58] you know it's like martin luther i'm not
[1:41:01] finished yet
[1:41:02] oh i'm going over time but we're gonna
[1:41:05] i'm gonna i'm gonna tell this and i'm
[1:41:07] gonna read the finishing up of this
[1:41:08] story
[1:41:09] and i've got a lot of other notes but we
[1:41:11] won't even read them because this is
[1:41:12] gonna be the consummation of my message
[1:41:16] always like that my daughter used to buy
[1:41:19] used books at garage sales she bought me
[1:41:20] a book one time was about martin luther
[1:41:22] and i was having trouble sleeping the
[1:41:24] devil was beating me up
[1:41:26] left and right and left and right left
[1:41:28] and right
[1:41:33] and i read it he became like a hero to
[1:41:37] me
[1:41:39] you know in the wittenberg there's an
[1:41:43] eat mark
[1:41:44] i don't know if it's still there they
[1:41:46] kept it as a memorial because
[1:41:48] luther had such a bad temper he was
[1:41:50] studying
[1:41:52] and he heard somebody eating he said the
[1:41:54] devil was eating heavens in the attic
[1:41:57] and he threw that ink up there
[1:41:59] but one time he said the devil
[1:42:03] sleeps closer to me in bed
[1:42:06] than my wife katie does and the devil
[1:42:09] gives me more
[1:42:10] torment than my wife gives me joy
[1:42:14] but he said i found a secret
[1:42:19] i say when he comes at me
[1:42:22] because he said the devil is just an
[1:42:23] exalted creature
[1:42:25] he is i found that because i i did the
[1:42:27] same thing and it worked
[1:42:34] he said i look at the devil and i say
[1:42:38] devil you know what you're in is going
[1:42:41] to be
[1:42:42] it's going to be in the lake of fire and
[1:42:45] you
[1:42:45] will cease you believe he's going to
[1:42:48] cease
[1:42:49] to exist amen and when i do that
[1:42:52] he would leave i was preaching in
[1:42:56] indiana
[1:42:58] out in the vestibule i'll try to speak
[1:43:01] in terms of mixed yes
[1:43:04] but a sister came to me
[1:43:08] crying said i should have come to the
[1:43:10] altar i should have come to the altar
[1:43:14] and she began to tell me her story about
[1:43:16] her life
[1:43:17] as a child in the home and i won't go
[1:43:19] any further
[1:43:22] but she said it's ruined my marriage
[1:43:26] i told her that's not your fault
[1:43:30] i prayed for nothing happened i told her
[1:43:33] the story about martin luther looking at
[1:43:35] the devil
[1:43:36] tell him what his end is and when i did
[1:43:39] that
[1:43:40] she was jumping up and down clapping her
[1:43:42] hands god had delivered her
[1:43:45] that same church that same church

[1:43:56] i was praying for people at the altar
[1:43:59] and he comes to me and he says

[1:44:30] of god

[1:44:34] god

[1:49:46] yes but you know what happened
[1:49:51] because god heard the prayer of hezekiah
[1:49:54] yes and verse 35
[1:49:58] why can't we do this and it came to pass
[1:50:02] that night that the angel of the lord
[1:50:06] went out and smoked the camp of the
[1:50:09] assyrians
[1:50:11] 104 score and 5 000. that's 185
[1:50:15] 000. yes they didn't have to lift a
[1:50:18] hand because of the prayer the bonus of
[1:50:22] a king
[1:50:23] going before god amen
[1:50:27] and when they arose early in the morning
[1:50:29] behold
[1:50:30] they were all dead carcasses
[1:50:33] and you know what happened sennacherib
[1:50:36] the king of assyria departed went in
[1:50:38] return and dwelt in nineveh
[1:50:40] and it came to pass as he was worshiping
[1:50:42] the house of
[1:50:43] nisrad the god and amalek with i can
[1:50:47] pronounce like his son smote him
[1:50:49] with his sword his son smoke his own son
[1:50:52] killed him and one of his sons became
[1:50:54] king
[1:50:55] be sure your sins will find you
[1:50:59] right now amen and also that's why i am
[1:51:01] mad
[1:51:03] i am mad i couldn't believe what's going
[1:51:07] on
[1:51:08] it's worldwide
[1:51:12] it's a worldwide control and i'm going
[1:51:14] to tell you this you may think i am
[1:51:16] crazy
[1:51:17] i like martin luther said he said he
[1:51:19] believed every evil thing that happens
[1:51:21] comes from rome
[1:51:23] from the antichrist and from the
[1:51:26] prophecy
[1:51:30] the greatest spy system is the jesuit
[1:51:32] order of the roman catholic
[1:51:34] church yes that killed abraham lincoln
[1:51:37] yes sir what it is
[1:51:42] we're living in that hour you better
[1:51:45] know where you stand with god
[1:51:49] young or old repent of all your sins
[1:51:53] and the holy ghost will enter
[1:51:56] amen amen
[1:52:00] i think the problem is people come to
[1:52:01] the message without repentance
[1:52:03] they come out because of some great
[1:52:05] revelation right maybe something you go
[1:52:07] well oh
[1:52:08] it sounds like a mormon i like that
[1:52:09] mormon stuff i like that you know and
[1:52:11] everything
[1:52:12] that's what it is without a true
[1:52:16] genuine pentecostal blessing
[1:52:19] of the holy ghost i want you to know
[1:52:22] i'm going to simply tell you this i'm a
[1:52:25] baptist
[1:52:28] nazarene pentecostal
[1:52:31] that's been baptized with the holy ghost
[1:52:34] amen
[1:52:34] and it believes the full word of god the
[1:52:37] message of the owl
[1:52:38] hey man amen
[1:52:42] when i when i first came in the message
[1:52:46] i remember one time i had been i've been
[1:52:48] i i had just come in i've been in for a
[1:52:50] while
[1:52:51] i was on third shift you know and i had
[1:52:54] my
[1:52:55] uh my third shift you can get by with
[1:52:57] anything you know
[1:52:58] i wasn't allowed to wear earphones and i
[1:53:00] was listening to a message i had my feet
[1:53:02] propped up on my desk because i was a
[1:53:04] floor inspector
[1:53:05] i didn't work too hard you know
[1:53:08] and all of a sudden brother bannon said
[1:53:10] something
[1:53:12] the break area was right across the
[1:53:13] aisle
[1:53:15] i heard something echoing through the
[1:53:18] place i heard somebody speaking in
[1:53:19] tongues
[1:53:21] and i found out that was me i better be
[1:53:23] quiet
[1:53:25] it was echoing through the building what
[1:53:27] was it it was stimulation by revelation
[1:53:30] stimulation everything you know
[1:53:34] you know those those these these people
[1:53:36] back there
[1:53:38] knew who rome was they just didn't have
[1:53:40] a full understanding
[1:53:41] but what did the message do it come to
[1:53:44] tie up all the loose ends
[1:53:46] it began to tie it up perfect that we
[1:53:48] can understand
[1:53:49] we're not in darkness we look down
[1:53:52] through a glass darkly no not anymore
[1:53:56] we could see perfectly the apes that
[1:53:58] we're living in
[1:54:01] for the full restored revelation of his
[1:54:04] word
[1:54:05] for this hour amen
[1:54:20] you know is the best way to die i knew a
[1:54:24] pastor in the philippines

[1:54:34] nobody

[1:54:44] him to do
[1:54:45] what a testimony amen what a place to go
[1:54:49] amen
[1:54:50] i don't think my wife would like that
[1:54:53] when i died in that waiting room in
[1:54:54] there my wife said i never got nervous
[1:54:56] she didn't she just believed
[1:54:58] later when i told her what happened i
