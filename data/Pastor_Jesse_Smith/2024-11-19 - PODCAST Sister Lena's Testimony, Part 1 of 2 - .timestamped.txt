[2:40] now let's hear our sister's testimony uh
[2:42] we sure appreciate our sister Lena been
[2:44] a wonderful pillar in the church here
[2:46] and God's been working in her
[2:47] tremendously so sister if you could
[2:48] start uh tell us a little bit about
[2:50] yourself your childhood and uh just
[2:53] becoming aware of the Lord as a child
[2:55] okay God bless everybody I'm Lena um I
[2:59] grew up up in a Baptist Church in
[3:02] Stockton California when I was younger I
[3:04] didn't go there too long but it's just
[3:08] like what I remember in my early life
[3:11] pertaining to God so yeah I went to a
[3:14] Baptist Church my mom was really
[3:17] involved in the church and my dad was a
[3:19] deacon at church
[3:21] but the church itself wasn't really the
[3:25] best um I won't go too in depth with
[3:28] that but I did fall out of church due to
[3:33] like growing up and seeing like how my
[3:36] dad was a deacon in church but
[3:39] yet his home life didn't like really
[3:42] show it like he would come home and like
[3:46] just like was really without going too
[3:49] in deep just like really emotionally and
[3:51] physically like a piece on top of that
[3:53] like not being loyal to his wife so then
[3:55] like me seeing that that pulled me away
[3:57] because like I was just like what kind
[4:00] of man of God would do that so then it
[4:02] made me fall out of sorry guys I'm
[4:06] crying I wasn't planning to
[4:08] cry um anyways so yeah that had me fall
[4:12] out of church because I was just just
[4:15] like if this is what like people in
[4:17] church do I don't want anything to do
[4:19] with it because it was like really like
[4:21] a lot of people in church the church I
[4:23] grew up and was like not living the best
[4:25] so then I was just like I don't want
[4:26] anything to do it it never like had me
[4:28] turn cold shoulder towards God like I
[4:31] always had my own love for God you know
[4:35] and yeah like I had my own love for God
[4:37] but I just stopped going to church
[4:39] because I was like I don't want anything
[4:40] to do with it just because like just
[4:44] what I saw so
[4:46] then after that we just moved around a
[4:49] lot I don't really have like any special
[4:51] experiences when I was younger
[4:53] pertaining to God until like I got older
[4:56] probably like 17 19 is when I really
[5:00] started Experiencing God but other than
[5:03] that we just moved around a lot due to
[5:05] like certain situations my mother was in
[5:08] so we just had to move due to like for
[5:11] safety reasons so then like I moved from
[5:14] California to Arizona back and forth my
[5:16] whole life since I was younger and so
[5:19] like there's nothing really like
[5:20] significant spiritually that happened to
[5:22] me when I was younger just besides like
[5:25] when I was younger when I went to the
[5:27] Baptist church and then fell out but
[5:29] other than that that's it for Ping like
[5:32] my childhood with God we appreciate you
[5:35] sharing that sister yeah and uh you know
[5:37] we've you and I have connected on that
[5:38] you know with brother Austin we've
[5:40] connected on having a difficult home
[5:41] life uh growing up and so the Lord has
[5:45] kind of United Us in that aspect we've
[5:47] been United because Austin had a rough
[5:49] home life I had a rough home life my
[5:51] parents divorced and you've had a rough
[5:54] home life too so this is going to be a
[5:56] big part of your testimony although your
[5:58] life started off very difficult uh God
[6:01] is the great Redeemer and God's love
[6:04] we'll see is going to step into your
[6:05] life in a really powerful way here but I
[6:07] appreciate you being so sensitive to the
[6:10] Holy Spirit uh being so honest and
[6:13] transparent um and I believe this will
[6:14] help people too to know that even if
[6:16] you've been raised in a difficult home
[6:18] life where there's a lot of pain maybe a
[6:20] lot of suffering God Is Watching Over
[6:22] You God is uh he's seeing everything
[6:24] he's the God who sees and he's going to
[6:26] come and rescue his children he's so
[6:29] faith
[6:30] so we thank the Lord for that we thank
[6:32] the Lord for his grace uh protecting you
[6:34] all those years as well so now maybe we
[6:37] can get into your late teenage years as
[6:41] you said where God starts becoming real
[6:44] to you and uh we'll kind of hear how the
[6:46] Lord starts revealing himself to you so
[6:49] I grew up like in situations where like
[6:52] I had I was comfortable as a child like
[6:55] I was able to like rely on my mom and
[6:59] then like and like be able to have the
[7:01] things I need but then there was times
[7:02] where like I started over from like
[7:05] nothing like multiple times to the point
[7:08] like to this day it changed my mindset
[7:10] on things because it's just like at the
[7:12] end of the day like it's just
[7:14] materialistic things and I'm grateful
[7:16] that I went through that like it's
[7:17] unfortunate but I'm grateful because it
[7:19] like it made me like not really care
[7:22] about like material things in the world
[7:24] because like one moment like we're
[7:25] comfortable in the house next Moment
[7:27] Like We have nothing and we're like in
[7:29] the car or something so I'm really
[7:31] grateful about that um I moved around a
[7:35] lot in my childhood when I went to
[7:37] school it was nice my teachers always
[7:39] told me like yeah when you're here
[7:41] you're doing really good but then like I
[7:42] didn't really care to go I just did you
[7:45] know once I got to that age I was just
[7:46] like oh whatever it's whatever so I was
[7:50] like not really focused on school I was
[7:53] just like I fell into at a really young
[7:56] age I fell into like smoking
[8:00] and stuff like smoking THC is what I
[8:04] mean by that I don't know how I could
[8:06] explain that on here but like that's
[8:07] what I fell into at a young age um sad
[8:11] how young and then a little after that I
[8:13] fell into drinking very heavily cuz I
[8:16] was just like oh you know it's whatever
[8:18] who cares but then like anytime I got
[8:21] like super high or like super drunk I
[8:24] felt like so convicted like I would cry
[8:27] and i' be like God hates me why am I
[8:29] doing this and it's like I didn't even
[8:30] have a relationship with God but I still
[8:32] felt that way and I'm just like why am I
[8:35] doing this and then like once I would
[8:37] like sober up or whatever I'll still do
[8:39] it over and over and I'll still feel so
[8:41] like convicted and bad cuz I'm just like
[8:44] why are you doing these things but I
[8:45] didn't really care like I didn't really
[8:47] care about myself I like really cared
[8:49] about what happened to me it was just
[8:51] like oh whatever I was just like in a
[8:54] really dark place before God pulled me
[8:57] out and I was just like and I was just
[8:59] the Life I Lived all the way up until I
[9:01] met Austin and then he talked to me
[9:03] about the message that we'll get into
[9:04] later but I was just just living life of
[9:09] sin not caring and just being like in a
[9:13] really dark spot in my
[9:15] life um I even like had to graduate late
[9:19] because I like wasn't focused whatsoever
[9:24] like even my my teachers would be like
[9:25] Lena you have to show up you know cuz
[9:28] like you're really smart when you're
[9:29] here you know you got to you we we want
[9:31] you to graduate but I was like I didn't
[9:33] care I was just like uh whatever it's
[9:35] just it's not a big deal to me and then
[9:38] until it became a big deal I'm like oh
[9:40] no I have to graduate so then that's
[9:41] when I really went all in with school
[9:44] and then finally graduated but without
[9:47] going to details that was just like my
[9:49] life I just I didn't really care for
[9:51] much it was just like whatever whatever
[9:53] happens happens but yet I was still like
[9:56] so convicted I always felt bad for the
[9:58] way I was living like I walk out of the
[10:00] house and I'm just like like what are
[10:02] you doing but I'm I just ignored it like
[10:04] I just ignored that voice I'm just like
[10:06] like oh whatever and just continue to
[10:07] sin continue to drink continue to do
[10:09] like all those things it's not right
[10:12] regardless like no matter what age you
[10:14] are but it's just like I started so
[10:16] young I think I was like 14 15 when I
[10:19] started doing all those things and it's
[10:22] I it's heartbreaking think about and
[10:24] then like sometimes not knowing where
[10:27] you're going to lay your head to like
[10:28] maybe finally getting comfortable
[10:30] somewhere just for it to be all like
[10:32] snatched from under you so yeah
[10:36] certainly amazing to see how uh the Lord
[10:38] was with you despite the homelessness
[10:40] the
[10:41] instability uh losing everything uh the
[10:44] uncertainty of life you know you said
[10:46] the voice of God would say what are you
[10:48] doing you know that's the built-in
[10:49] conscience you know so even in that you
[10:51] know God was dealing with you uh working
[10:54] with you and uh basically helping to
[10:57] helping you to know that what you were
[10:58] doing with was wrong and we've all gone
[11:01] through that you know to some degree
[11:03] some levels more than others but it's
[11:05] wonderful to see that God was right
[11:06] there with you um he showed you what was
[11:09] right showed you what was wrong and a
[11:11] lot of times we have to go through
[11:12] difficult things so that we can really
[11:14] hunger for the good things and the the
[11:17] love of God the mercy of God the grace
[11:19] of God so I appreciate you sharing about
[11:21] that you know all of our listeners you
[11:23] know if you've uh ever battled with some
[11:25] of these things this will speak right to
[11:26] your life you know uh also gives us such
[11:29] an Assurance no matter how desperate
[11:31] your situation is no matter how much
[11:33] pain and suffering you've gone through
[11:35] when it seems like you have nothing you
[11:36] still have God you still have God's love
[11:39] you still have God's care you still have
[11:41] God's mercy and his grace so it's so
[11:44] comforting to know that uh despite our
[11:45] sister going through some of these very
[11:47] traumatic childhood experiences God was
[11:50] right there and God was convicting her
[11:53] God was ultimately protecting her and
[11:55] taking care of her
[12:02] please pardon the interruption I'd like
[12:03] to remind our listeners about two
[12:06] resources that will greatly strengthen
[12:08] your faith according to my humble
[12:10] opinion in 2019 I wrote the book called
[12:13] restoring Christian modesty it's over
[12:15] 120 Pages showing the Bible foundations
[12:19] for a modest and holy appearance it
[12:22] covers all the guidelines for modest
[12:24] clothing and also covers bracelets
[12:28] necklaces Rings earrings nose rings and
[12:32] many more
[12:33] topics one of the most useful parts of
[12:36] this book is the chapter that shows the
[12:38] history of the United States and how
[12:40] they slowly rejected modest clothing and
[12:43] it Chronicles all these changes decade
[12:46] by decade from the 1800s to the present
[12:49] and the second resource is my 2021 book
[12:52] it's an 82-page book about the 12 New
[12:55] Testament Mysteries that brother Brandon
[12:56] finished according to revelation 10:
[12:59] brother random said the seventh Church
[13:01] age messenger would finish all these
[13:03] mysteries in the sermon called is this
[13:05] the sign of the end sir from December
[13:08] 1962 friends this is an extensive Bible
[13:10] teaching on the major doctrines that
[13:13] brother renham gave us proving he was
[13:15] the seventh Church age messenger a
[13:17] genuine prophet of God and the Elijah
[13:19] Prophet to restore all things in a time
[13:22] when so many people are falling away
[13:23] from the message I feel these two
[13:25] resources will strengthen your faith if
[13:27] you want God to draw closer to you
[13:29] you've got to draw closer to him and
[13:30] many times that's through prayer Bible
[13:32] study worship so I know these two
[13:35] resources will be a great help to you
[13:37] they're available on Amazon I'm not a
[13:39] book salesman so if you can't afford
[13:41] them I'll gladly email you the free PDFs
[13:44] you can read them on your phone or
[13:45] tablet or print them off if you like
[13:48] recall acts 17:1 the Brians were more
[13:50] noble because they search the Scriptures
[13:52] Daily to prove the things that Paul
[13:54] taught were true and so we must do the
[13:57] same thing today if we're spiritual
[13:58] nobility
[13:59] if we're spiritual royalty in the family
[14:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ the family of
[14:04] King Jesus then we should search the
[14:05] Scriptures Daily to prove brother Ram's
[14:08] teachings where thus sayith the word of
[14:09] God thank you for your time now back to
[14:11] the
[14:17] content so now let's Jump Ahead a little
[14:19] bit to where U sister Lena meets brother
[14:22] Austin when I first met Austin it was in
[14:26] Lake Habu Arizona um my mom mom my
[14:30] siblings and I all moved there to a
[14:32] domestic violence place that was like
[14:35] out in Lake Abu and it was right next
[14:38] door to a Dollar General where Austin
[14:40] was working so we went there all the
[14:42] time and then like every time I would go
[14:45] in I'm just like I'll be nervous like I
[14:47] never said anything to him but I'll just
[14:48] like see him and I'm like oh wow you
[14:53] know so that's when we first met and
[14:56] like I think we like talked once we were
[14:57] like oh he as me if um I braid hair cuz
[15:00] his hair was long and he's like do you
[15:02] braid hair and I'm like no he's like oh
[15:04] okay and I think like that's the first
[15:06] time we talked and then I'll just go in
[15:08] there all the time and like not really
[15:10] say anything and then after that we left
[15:15] that town for a while probably
[15:18] like six months or so um we left that
[15:23] town and then we moved back and we still
[15:26] didn't I still didn't see him when we
[15:29] first moved back it was a while since
[15:31] we've been back in Habu since we I ran
[15:33] back into Austin and then one day I was
[15:37] just hanging out with friends by the
[15:39] river and then one of my friends is like
[15:41] waving at someone and I'm just like who
[15:43] is she waving at and she calls me over
[15:45] she's like look and then it was him and
[15:47] I was just like oh hey and then that's
[15:50] when we started to hang out and that's
[15:55] like when we bump back into each other
[15:56] and like from that moment on we would
[15:59] just like talk we didn't really like
[16:00] hang out as much since it was like right
[16:02] when the pandemic started so we would
[16:04] just like text and talk a lot and then
[16:07] after we started to hang out for a while
[16:11] and then like in May is when like we
[16:13] officially started like dating I guess
[16:16] and then the rest is history that's just
[16:18] like the summary of
[16:21] it just like same life I was just still
[16:25] living in sin
[16:27] and not really caring like I was still
[16:29] in like a really depressive state of
[16:31] mind and still just like living however
[16:35] not really caring and I was like oh yeah
[16:37] nice I got this guy is pretty cool
[16:39] hanging talking to him so that was nice
[16:41] but I was still like uh it's whatever
[16:43] life is whatever but still had that like
[16:45] conviction of like
[16:47] anytime I was just like under the
[16:49] influence I was just like so sad and
[16:51] depressed and I was just cry I'm just
[16:53] like what are you doing like and it's
[16:57] crazy that I felt that way cuz like I
[16:58] had like no relationship with God like
[17:00] yeah always knew God was real and like I
[17:02] prayed sometimes you know little to none
[17:05] never read my
[17:07] Bible but yeah I still felt awful
[17:10] anytime I would
[17:12] like just do those things and I'm just
[17:15] like I don't know why I'm doing this you
[17:16] know God hates me why am I doing this
[17:18] and then I'll still like I said still do
[17:21] it even though I felt that way or
[17:24] like even like my UNM modest appearance
[17:28] I would like why walk out the house and
[17:29] I'll still like feel
[17:30] like I don't know how to explain but
[17:32] like I felt guilty for the way I walked
[17:36] out the house cuz I'm just like I
[17:38] shouldn't be doing this but yet I'm
[17:39] still doing it who cares kind of mindset
[17:42] no like I said I don't it's just very
[17:45] real that I even felt that way like I
[17:46] cuz I had no relationship with God like
[17:48] yeah I knew he was of course I knew he
[17:50] was real I know he's real but I was just
[17:52] like whatever I'll live however I want
[17:55] to live you know God loves me for who I
[17:57] am he knows I mistake which is just
[18:00] like not okay but yeah that's it besides
[18:05] that and then up to that just living the
[18:07] same just not living the way the Lord
[18:11] would have wanted me to yeah again
[18:14] wonderful to see how uh you have that
[18:15] conviction you know the way you were
[18:16] dressing or the the substance abuse you
[18:19] know God's conviction was right there
[18:21] built into you I think Romans 1 and
[18:22] Romans 2 talk about that God puts a
[18:25] conscience in each and every one of us
[18:26] you know so it's wonderful to see how
[18:28] God was active right there and you're
[18:30] aware of that and really like the Bible
[18:32] says you know just like all of us we
[18:33] were under the prince and power of the
[18:35] air as Ephesians 2:2 says walking in the
[18:40] ways of the children of
[18:42] Disobedience uh but God was going to
[18:44] come rescue our sister Lena just like
[18:46] God rescues all of us that are believers
[18:48] so now we'd like to hear how brother
[18:50] Austin shared the gospel with sister
[18:52] Lena there you've already heard a little
[18:54] bit about it if you've heard our
[18:55] previous versions but it's awesome to
[18:57] hear it from another perspective we'll
[18:58] let our sister Lena share how it
[19:00] impacted her how it came to her and I
[19:03] know you'll be blessed by God's grace so
[19:05] the way Austin told me about the message
[19:09] was um it was just one random day we're
[19:13] sitting down watching TV and one day he
[19:16] was just like I don't remember how the
[19:18] conversation started
[19:20] but it started and then he was just he
[19:24] sat me down and he was just talking to
[19:25] me I think it was like um three almost
[19:27] three hours I could be wrong but like
[19:30] couple hours long of him telling me
[19:33] about the message and like how this
[19:35] church is like the message is different
[19:37] and like how the bride of Christ
[19:40] Fellowship is a different from all these
[19:43] other churches and then like due to my
[19:46] past I was just like doubting at first
[19:49] cuz I'm just like I don't know you know
[19:50] cuz like my experience my own
[19:52] experiences wasn't great like there's
[19:55] the pastor at the church was you know
[19:57] taking TI money for his own special like
[20:00] things he need for himself and like
[20:01] while people here struggling are like my
[20:04] dad is a deacon but yet coming home
[20:05] doing all these things and like
[20:07] mistreating his wife in every way you
[20:09] can think of and then so I'm just like I
[20:11] don't know but then like he's just
[20:12] sitting down talking to me like very
[20:14] passionate about and I don't think I
[20:16] really like respond that much I think I
[20:17] just like mainly just like listened
[20:19] really to what he was saying CU I'm just
[20:21] like taking it all in and then
[20:24] like um couple hours go by he's just
[20:28] like yeah like Lena you you know it's
[20:31] it's like this is really God like the
[20:33] holy spirit's there and stuff and then
[20:36] like he asked me to move here with him
[20:38] and then like towards the end of the
[20:39] conversation you know like I was fing
[20:41] the pool and I'm like okay yeah I'll do
[20:43] it and then like after that you know
[20:47] after the conversation was done like a
[20:49] few days go by and I'm I started like
[20:51] doubting a lot like I really thought I
[20:53] we would have to like break up because
[20:55] I'm like I can't I don't know like I
[20:57] don't know if I can do this like
[21:00] like I'm I was just really doubting
[21:01] because I'm like I don't I don't want to
[21:02] move to Ohio and it's like it's the same
[21:05] thing like that I grew up in or like I
[21:08] experienced or like I've been around I
[21:10] don't I don't want that so I just really
[21:11] doubting I was sad too because I was
[21:14] like I'm going to have to we're going to
[21:15] have to like split up I can't I won't be
[21:18] able to go with him kind of mindset and
[21:20] then one day I was at work I worked at a
[21:23] Goodwill um and I was just restocking
[21:25] the shelves and then it's like this lady
[21:27] comes up to me
[21:28] [Music]
[21:30] and I'm paraphrasing cuz I don't
[21:32] remember exactly what she said but she
[21:34] was just like you know the Lord has a
[21:38] plan for my life and like this life is
[21:41] temporary and you know there's bigger
[21:46] greater things like I said in
[21:47] paraphrasing I could be I don't really
[21:49] remember what she said but it was just
[21:50] like basically that and then like from
[21:53] that moment I felt that was it was
[21:55] definitely LED of the Lord because
[21:57] that's when that like I was really
[21:58] doubting really hard like cuz I didn't I
[22:01] wasn't going to move here I was just
[22:02] like no I I can't and then like when she
[22:04] said that I was just like it was just a
[22:06] Vindication for me that I'm supposed to
[22:08] be here and that the Lord wanted me here
[22:12] um probably it's just what I remember
[22:14] I'm probably missing a lot but like
[22:16] that's just how I remember the story
[22:19] yeah sounds like to me almost like a
[22:20] word of knowledge you know the Bible
[22:22] said knowledge is understanding and
[22:24] Jesus said knowledge opens up doors so
[22:26] you were doubting going through all this
[22:28] doubt and then this this this woman
[22:30] brings a word to give you understanding
[22:32] and that's the moment that the peace of
[22:34] God came on you and would allow you do
[22:36] such a drastic thing as moving across
[22:39] the country without any family or
[22:41] friends and trusting this handsome young
[22:43] guy here uh brother Austin by God's
[22:46] grace but yeah it's awesome to see how
[22:47] God sends you the right person at the
[22:49] right time again God is always on time
[22:52] he's never late so it's awesome to see
[22:54] how you got a word at just the right
[22:56] time to help lead you and guide you into
[22:58] all truth mhm so yeah so once I decided
[23:01] to well not I decided once the Lord
[23:02] showed me that I'm supposed to be here
[23:06] you know we started saving money to plan
[23:08] a trip to move here um but it was it was
[23:12] hard saving money when because I was not
[23:14] a good sa I'm still learning you know
[23:17] better than I was but I'm still learning
[23:19] so like anytime I got money I was just
[23:20] like oh you know whatever one CU like
[23:22] probably the way I grew up and I was
[23:24] just like oh anytime we got money just
[23:25] spend it on whatever so then it was
[23:27] really tough saving for the move until
[23:30] once my mom one of my sisters and I we
[23:35] got into a accident with a semi Tru that
[23:37] hit us and then I'm I'm saying this cuz
[23:40] it's going to lead up to the reason we
[23:41] moved here um we got into an accident
[23:44] with the semi truck who hit us and then
[23:47] like it was just like this whole lawsuit
[23:49] going on that I honestly forgot about
[23:52] until years later until like around the
[23:54] time we're moving here um the lawyers
[23:58] got into touch with us and they're like
[24:00] they set us down you know talk to us
[24:01] about it like yeah you guys are finally
[24:03] get us getting a settlement and stuff
[24:06] all these years later I was just like oh
[24:07] I forgot about that I didn't even know
[24:09] we were going to get money for it so it
[24:11] wasn't much but um I feel like the Lord
[24:15] allowed the settlement to come at that
[24:17] time
[24:18] because because of that we had enough to
[24:21] move out here to get us here so as soon
[24:24] as we got the settlement we bought our
[24:26] train tickets here we took a Am track
[24:28] all the way here I think it was like 36
[24:30] hours probably like 2 days on the train
[24:33] to get here and all we had was like
[24:36] three bags all together of like our
[24:38] clothes like and like maybe like a
[24:40] pillow and a blanket just to move here
[24:43] um but to go backwards I'm all over the
[24:46] place I'm sorry um going back the day we
[24:49] were leaving it was just like some issue
[24:51] with our luggage that we probably like
[24:54] weren't able to bring it or something
[24:56] and then Austin's like no you know let's
[24:58] just postpone and let's wait let's just
[24:59] like get our money back in
[25:01] um just wait until you know we're able
[25:05] to figure this out and I'm like no we
[25:06] have to go because if we keep postponing
[25:08] it we won't go so then we're just like
[25:10] all right we're doing it and by the
[25:12] grace of God when we got there you know
[25:15] they were fine with our luggage and
[25:16] literally like right when we got to
[25:17] Cleveland our last stop they're like oh
[25:19] you guys have too much stuff you can't
[25:20] do that anymore we're just like oh well
[25:22] praise God we we made it to our
[25:25] destination by the grace of God so that
[25:28] was pretty like a spiritual thing to me
[25:31] it was a blessing for
[25:33] sure yeah I remember that was part of
[25:35] Austin's testimony too like you know he
[25:37] was battling should we go or maybe we
[25:38] should not go and yet then God used you
[25:41] to help give him courage uh to go that's
[25:44] inspiring reminds us of Rebecca you know
[25:45] they asked Rebecca do you want to go
[25:47] she's like I want to go right now you
[25:48] know so it reminds me of that too God
[25:51] gave you the leadership and the courage
[25:53] to want to go very good so that day
[25:56] always be etched in my memory uh
[25:57] December 10 2021 it was Lydia's birthday
[26:01] was it your 17th birthday it was Lydia's
[26:04] 17th birthday my oldest child turned 17
[26:08] and Austin said uh can you come pick us
[26:10] up in Cleveland like at 5:00 a.m. or
[26:12] 5:30 so I got up you know about 400
[26:14] something like that went up to pick them
[26:16] up I was elated to see them I was a
[26:19] little nervous driving around Cleveland
[26:20] at you know 5: in the morning but um I
[26:23] was elated to see them it's so great to
[26:24] see Austin and uh funny story was that
[26:28] when I was putting the luggage into the
[26:29] car or in the trunk I didn't see his
[26:32] head and I kind of closed the trunk on
[26:33] his head and um I I've apologize for
[26:36] that over and over again I'm going
[26:38] apologize now again brother Alon I'm
[26:39] sorry you I I didn't mean to do that to
[26:41] you brother um that was just a fun thing
[26:44] that happened or unfortunate thing that
[26:45] happened there uh on that morning uh but
[26:49] since then we've had him back here and
[26:51] we'll let sister Lena share here how she
[26:54] adjusted to being an akine and how the
[26:56] Lord was gracious to her as she uh
[26:59] settled into uh her final destination by
[27:01] God's grace when I first got here to
[27:05] Ohio I was really excited but yet very
[27:09] nervous like super nervous thought I was
[27:12] nervous before this podcast I was no
[27:14] that was a different kind of nervous I
[27:15] didn't know what to expect I didn't
[27:18] know how people would treat me here but
[27:24] oh that was just like my own nervousness
[27:26] because from
[27:29] first met brother Jesse very kind you
[27:32] know it was funny the trunk thing was
[27:34] pretty funny but you know very kind man
[27:36] definitely felt God on him and
[27:42] then I don't remember if it was the
[27:44] following day or the night we got there
[27:47] but we went over to brother Jesse's
[27:50] house and I was nervous because I'm like
[27:53] oh what are they going to think of me
[27:55] you know are they going to think I'm
[27:57] weird you know judge me but no it was
[27:59] like the total opposite like from the
[28:01] moment I walked through the door it was
[28:02] just like love nothing but love there
[28:05] and I was just like a yeah this is nice
[28:07] and like meeting everybody was really
[28:10] amazing everyone was so nice very kind
[28:13] to me
[28:15] um like it was Lydia's birthday so I
[28:17] remember them opening up G opening gifts
[28:19] so yeah it was it was the night of then
[28:21] so yeah she was opening gifts and
[28:23] everything and I'm just quiet just
[28:25] sitting around just watching I'm just
[28:27] like okay this is still nervous but I'm
[28:30] like everyone's really kind um
[28:33] definitely the spirit of God in that
[28:35] home absolutely like I like I've never
[28:38] felt and it was beautiful um and then I
[28:41] remember we were leaving and one of the
[28:44] little girls gave me a hug and everyone
[28:46] was like she never hugs anyone and I was
[28:48] just like oh wow this is amazing won't
[28:51] say her name or anything but it was aaz
[28:55] I was just like oh really so that I
[28:56] don't know that just made me really
[28:57] happy I just wanted to throw that in
[28:59] there um and then from that moment on I
[29:02] was still nervous just felt like no one
[29:06] here like no one at all ever made me
[29:09] feel any kind of way everyone was loving
[29:11] there was there were never judgy they
[29:14] talk to me like you know like a like
[29:16] they've known me my whole life so no one
[29:20] here ever made me feel any kind of way
[29:22] but like myself I felt like really
[29:25] convicted like when I didn't right when
[29:27] I came came I didn't like immediately
[29:29] change my appearance you know I still
[29:30] had like piercings in my face you know
[29:34] but yet no one said a thing about it you
[29:36] know and it was just beautiful and I was
[29:37] just very grateful for it of course like
[29:39] during the sermons it was preached about
[29:40] just as it should be because like that's
[29:42] the Holy Spirit speaking so I was just
[29:44] like okay taking all that in but yet
[29:47] like still right away I was just like
[29:50] really nervous I just like I
[29:53] don't I don't know I just very convicted
[29:57] I felt very pressured to like I feel
[29:59] like I felt like I should already have
[30:01] my whole life figured out I should have
[30:04] been
[30:05] like got it all together from the moment
[30:07] I got here and I was just like oh I just
[30:09] feel like people want me to change
[30:10] already but like no one ever made me
[30:12] feel that way and I want to make that
[30:13] clear no one here ever made me feel that
[30:15] way it was just my
[30:17] own my own thoughts my own like just me
[30:21] being hard on myself on top of that like
[30:23] the conviction of the Holy Spirit like
[30:25] as it should be you know cuz obviously I
[30:27] wasn't living the best
[30:29] still but um I would tell Austin that he
[30:31] was like no he he would always be like
[30:33] no it's like no one feels that way like
[30:35] that's just like that's just you you
[30:37] know like no one here is making you feel
[30:39] that way I'm like I know I know and then
[30:41] it's like you know always he always
[30:43] talked me down and I just really
[30:44] appreciated that but then slowly but
[30:49] surely I started you know changing and I
[30:51] remember like when I officially took my
[30:53] the rest of my earrings and like
[30:55] piercings out it was like one Bible
[30:58] study and it wasn't even like about
[31:01] piercings or anything but one of the
[31:02] little girls were like they asked a
[31:04] question about earrings oh yeah they
[31:06] were like if um if you can you
[31:09] compliment someone's earrings or
[31:11] something or like something like that
[31:12] and then you know paraphrasing I don't
[31:15] remember exactly what was said but
[31:16] brother Jesse was like you know it's
[31:17] best to just like stay away from it and
[31:20] like don't really remember what said so
[31:22] I'm not even going to try but basically
[31:24] just like probably don't do that and I
[31:27] don't know like when she said that I
[31:28] felt really confined and like I was just
[31:30] sitting there and I just like
[31:31] immediately like took them all out took
[31:33] everything else out and just like threw
[31:34] it away cuz I just like felt like that
[31:36] was the Lord like letting me know like
[31:37] hey you know time to like get rid of all
[31:39] that so then that's when I finally took
[31:42] all of my PS my earrings and my um
[31:45] piercings
[31:48] out wardrobe wise like my clothing it
[31:52] took me a little bit longer to like
[31:54] finally start justing modest one for
[31:57] like
[31:59] financially but by the grace of
[32:02] God one of the sisters in the church
[32:04] definitely helped um by giving me like
[32:08] some skirts and stuff to start off with
[32:11] and that was definitely a blessing I
[32:12] didn't start like right away I kind of
[32:14] like I was so used to dressing and
[32:17] modest for so long like wearing pants
[32:19] and stuff for so long so like I didn't
[32:21] right away just like go all the way in
[32:23] to just like
[32:25] dressing modest so like here and there I
[32:27] would still like wear my pants but like
[32:29] wear the skirts also sometimes and then
[32:33] until eventually I don't
[32:36] remember when
[32:38] but I just was like felt L to just like
[32:41] get rid of like all of my modest
[32:43] clothing so I just like threw it all out
[32:45] and it was just like by the grace of God
[32:48] it wasn't it wasn't me it was definitely
[32:49] the Lord like leading me to like get rid
[32:52] of all those inm modest clothing and um
[32:56] just go all the way in with Jessie
[32:58] modison and that's when I did that I
[33:00] Cann remember how long it took me to do
[33:02] that
[33:04] but yeah that's when I did that
[33:08] um yeah so that's just kind of the
[33:11] summary of like when I first got here
[33:12] and how it was
[33:14] feeling yeah I love that story it's very
[33:16] unique you know how the Holy Spirit
[33:17] deals with each individual I think even
[33:19] my wife's testimony when we first came
[33:21] in the message uh nobody walked right up
[33:23] to Kristen and said get those earrings
[33:25] out uh they didn't order her around now
[33:27] some churches are known for that and
[33:29] some Churches get good results that way
[33:31] I guess we might call that the real
[33:32] aggressive approach uh but when we came
[33:34] in the message we went to a church that
[33:36] was more uh patient I'll call that the
[33:38] patient
[33:40] approach um and so it's just awesome to
[33:42] see you know looking back now that was
[33:44] like three years ago look how far God
[33:46] has brought our sister you know and
[33:48] because it's the work of God it's not
[33:50] the work of a man it's not the work of
[33:52] legalism it's the work of the Holy
[33:54] Spirit pointing us to the word of God
[33:56] and so I think it's awesome to see how
[33:58] God work with sister Lena the same way
[34:00] you know God worked with my wife you
[34:02] know when my wife first came in the
[34:03] message uh we see God dealing with um
[34:06] each person individually and that's the
[34:09] way we've always Tred to do at our
[34:10] church you know God has a time and
[34:12] season for everything God knows our
[34:14] Downs sittings our uprisings uh God
[34:17] determined where we'd be born you know
[34:19] acts 17 tells us that where we'd live
[34:21] and so if God has all that planned out
[34:23] we don't have to force our will or our
[34:25] thinking upon anybody God will do the
[34:27] the work so it's been amazing it's been
[34:30] wonderful it's been Supernatural to see
[34:32] God work here in Sister Lena's
[34:40] life friends we've come to the end of
[34:43] part one of sister Lena's podcast I
[34:45] trust it's been a great blessing to you

[34:52] given our sister since she's been in
[34:53] akran including her wedding and other
[34:56] answers to prayer
