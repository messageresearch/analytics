TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the name above all names the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to prove by the bible that the lukewarm condition jesus warned about in revelation 3 verse 16 never applies to the soul of the holy ghost filled born again christian the origin of this video was last year in 2021 we had a guest minister who preached a wonderful sermon and ended the sermon by sharing quotes about lukewarmness from god's prophet brother branham as i was invited back to the pulpit the scripture of first john 3 verse 9 struck my heart it says whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god so as i came to the pulpit i shared the scripture with the church to encourage them and let them know if they were born again their soul could never be lukewarm because the soul that is born again has god's nature in it and god's nature is god's holy spirit and god's holy spirit is eternal life so the soul of a born-again christian will be perpetually on fire or perpetually in revival as we talk recently in the youtube video about the four kinds of revival god's prophet brother branham taught us so in this video i'm going to rehearse the highlights from that sermon it was preached on august 1st 2021 my opening texts were revelation 3 16 which is jesus's warning to the laodicean church age to not be lukewarm or cold but to be hot i also use luke 3 verse 16 which is where john the baptist promised that jesus was baptized with the holy ghost and with fire so i emphasize that word fire because it related to the hot condition jesus promised that believers could live in in revelation 3 verse 16. and then i read acts chapter 2 verses 3 and 4 where the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost and it appeared as fire over the heads of the 120 believers in the upper room so i use these scriptures to show that a born-again christian who has the same baptism of the holy ghost experience today like they had on the day of pentecost has the fire of god in their souls and so their souls can never be lukewarm and then i also mentioned the book of john chapter 14 verse 16 where jesus said i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever and of course this comforter was the baptism of the holy ghost represented as that lick of fire or pillar of fire that fell in the day of pentecost and so the holy ghost fire would abide with believers forever and where would he abide in their souls of course so from those texts that i used we saw jesus sent the baptism of the holy ghost so his fire would abide in their souls forever making holy ghost filled believers his mouthpiece remember jesus promised in revelation chapter 3 that he would not speak through the lukewarm group because he would spew them out of his mouth so the only ones today that truly speak for the lord jesus christ are his born-again holy ghost-filled believers which we call the bride of jesus christ or the wise virgin group now next in my sermon i place the lukewarm group among other bible groups that jesus christ taught about and also that god's prophet brother branham highlighted so in revelation 3 verse 16 jesus listed three conditions hot lukewarm and cold the lukewarm do not speak for jesus and of course the cold do not either so the spewed out lukewarm group reminds us of isaiah 28 verses 1 through 13. in isaiah 28 we see the group is judgment bound verse and these israelis were crowned with pride and drunkenness verses 1 and 3. their priests and prophets who were supposed to be mouthpieces had no vision and no judgment according to verse 7 and their worship was likened unto vomit filthiness and uncleanness as verse 8 says and that vomit condition is connected to revelation 3 verse 16 because the lukewarm church is spewed out of jesus's mouth they do not speak for jesus christ this lukewarm condition in isaiah 28 also foretold the pharisees in their ultimate rejection of pentecost according to verse 11 and then first corinthians 14 verse 21 so here's a visual you can see on your screen and you'll see the three conditions jesus described hot lukewarm and cold notice under hot they speak for god the lukewarm group is rejected from speaking for god and the cold has no connection to god now this chart should remind us of the three kinds of believers sermon brother branham preached which is true but in the church age book and other sermons brother graham spoke of another class of believers as he also spoke of four crosses that were present at the time of jesus persecution now although this is mysterious all these statements from brother branham fit together with the bible remember god hides these truths from the wise and prudent but reveals them unto babes such as would learn the reason this subject is mysterious is because it's about the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of heaven is a mystery according to jesus christ matthew chapter 13. now in the church age book chapter 7 brother branham said there is another class brother ram said quote secondly there is another class their names are also in the book of life and they will come up in the second resurrection such are the foolish virgins and the righteous as are spoken of in matthew 25 end quote based upon that quote now i'm going to show you another visual at the top here we see now four columns or four groups there's hot two groups that are lukewarm and one group that is cold so let's look under hop the first group is hot they speak for god no doubt they're saved and the example from jesus day would have been peter after he got the holy ghost he would have been in the hot group now let's go to the first lukewarm group the second group from the left this lukewarm group was rejected from speaking for god yet they were saved and one example from jesus's lifetime was the saved thief on the cross he was scarcely saved as peter also wrote in his epistle the second lukewarm group or second from the right they spurn god's mercy and they're rejected from speaking for god they are also lost and the person from jesus day who signified this group was judas iscariot the fourth and final column is the far one on the right this is the coal group jesus spoke of this group had no connection to god they were lost and an example from jesus day was the government leader named pilate friends this chart might surprise some but be assured brother branham has quotes saying both of these groups are in the lukewarm group which i'll read now in testimony 1950 in cleveland ohio brother ram said quote and you christians don't stay in that lukewarm condition anymore lay aside everything just get as close to god as you can end quote so here brother ram says christians can be lukewarm then in the church age book chapter 9 brother branham said the false church was a lukewarm group quote in verses 15 to 18 which we have just studied lies the true picture of the ripe and false vine false spirit false church people so then because they are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth end quote so you hear the lukewarm church is proud arrogant this is the false church here's another quote where brother ram said the foolish virgin is lukewarm from 1953 israel in the church part three quote and to you you lukewarm church member that you're trying to impersonate christianity one of these days you're going to try to follow that holy ghost band and you'll find out your wheels will come off out yonder in the muddy somewhere there was ten virgins went to meet the lord five of them were wise and five foolish put oil in your lamp trim her bright one of these days they're going up and there was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth end quote so brother brown warned the lukewarm christians to get oil to be born again with the baptism of the holy ghost before it's too late what's interesting is that brother random also used lot from the old testament abraham's nephew he used lot most often to express lukewarmness here's one example jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever 1963 quote he came down there was lot down in sodom the lukewarm church member half backslidden and immediately after a lot came out the lukewarm left the city then fire destroyed the place end quote of course lot was saved the book of 2nd peter chapter 2 said he was a righteous man here's a wonderful quote that really blessed my heart where brother graham talked about a holy ghost-filled christian that will by no means be a lukewarm so i'm going to read this it's from god's provided place of worship 1965 quote now we've already resurrected the dynamics and the mechanics has gone to work quickened us and we're quickened up into the presence of god where his spirit is and now we are sealed together in heavenly places in christ jesus sitting in there that great seat that's already fired up been raised from the dead we're a part of it if you're a part of the bride you are because the bride is part of the groom you know so we find out that it's the same thing and she'll do exactly what's predicted for her to do in this day she won't be a laodicean not by no means a lukewarm she'll be on fire for god she'll be moving on in the spirit of god so here brother brown gives a beautiful description of a believer who's born again baptized with the holy ghost and notice the word he used quicken we get that from ephesians chapter two we were dead in sins and trespasses but jesus hath quickened us he's given us eternal life he's given us the seal of the holy ghost he's made us hot he's put his spiritual seed in our souls the nature of god eternal life the fire of god now let's move on to some bible teaching here about the lukewarm state the greek word for lukewarm is only used one time in the entire new testament revelation 3 16. the greek word for hot is only used three times and all three are in the passage of revelation 3 verses 15 to 16. the greek definition of hot gives us some spiritual clues to this divine connection it deals with enthusiasm zeal and desire so a hot christian or holy ghost-filled christian will be zealous for the word of god another way brother bam described it was knowing the truth and living the truth the greek word for lukewarm means tepid or lacking conviction lacking enthusiasm neglectful insulting or rude and of course the word cold would mean chilly towards god or separated from god or despising god next in this bible teaching let's remember first thessalonians 5 23 which says every person every human has a body human spirit and soul now with that thought in mind let's consider the three states that jesus spoke of in revelation 3 verse 16 hot lukewarm and cold what's interesting is that all three of these states apply to the three states of every human being and of course we're talking about a holy ghost-filled christian so let me explain the soul of the holy ghost filled christian is always hot because the soul has god's holy ghost fire baptism according to luke 3 16 acts 2 verses 3 and 4 and also acts 1 verse and inside the soul is the seed word of god according to first john 3 verse 9 and that seed cannot sin because it is the life of god it is a part of god it is god's own life it is eternal life now the human spirit or mind of a holy ghost-filled christian can be lukewarm at times it can even be cold at times so the bible never calls our minds specifically lukewarm since that was only used once but hebrews 12 3 says we get weary or sick and faint in our minds and our minds need transformed daily as paul said in romans chapter 12 and paul said he hated the things he did at times according to romans chapter 7 and then he also called himself wretched or an afflicted man at times and even said his carnal mind was enmity against god at times in romans 8 verse 7. so as holy ghost-filled christians we can still be convicted by jesus's preaching about being lukewarm but we know that lukewarm condition will only be in our human minds or human spirits and if we have the baptism of the holy ghost in our soul we've already passed from death unto life and we can never come into condemnation getting back to the human body the human body or flesh is usually cold on god because paul says it's a body of death in romans 7 verse 24 but of course there are times the holy ghost anoints our bodies where we're happy we're shouting we're joyful we're weeping we're crying and the holy ghost anointing that was in our soul overflows into our human mind and then that anointing can overflow onto our bodies as well but most of the time our human body is cold towards the things of god now these bible scriptures are true and it also relates to what brother branham said because in 1957 and god keeps his word part one brother ram said quote listen brother you're never saved by any sign you're never saved by any sensation you are saved when you meet god's condition of his word and nothing else are you saved by that's right god's word has made a way you're not saved because you feel like you're saved i'm not saved because i feel like i'm saved because a lot of times i don't feel that way but i'm saved because god gave me the promise i met god's conditions and upon god's holy word i can defeat satan seven days in a week and as many nights because it's god's word end quote and then brother branham quoted john chapter 5 verse 24 that says verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death into life i love this quote from brother branham friends because it shows brother branham had three parts to his being he was human just like all of us he said many times i don't even feel saved well that statement fits perfectly with the chart i'd already showed that says believers have all three conditions in their bodies usually holy ghost-filled believers are hot in their soul but they can even be cold or lukewarm in their minds if they're not meditating on the things of god and they've got to restore that or renew that zeal or passion in their minds every single day and many times their bodies will be called on god as well so we cannot trust our feelings we must believe the word and the revelation of the word in our souls and then we must stir up our minds when our minds don't feel hot for jesus so the goal of the holy ghostbuild christian is to have both the soul and the human spirit hot and of course the soul will be hot until the day of our redemption according to ephesians 4 30 we have to renew the mind every single day and keep it hot or stirred up or zealous for the things of god getting back to the word hot in the greek for revelation 3 verse 16 it means boiling hot metaphorically of fervor of mind and zeal and so we see the holy ghost-filled saints in the new testament had this hot experience acts 4 verse 31 when the holy ghost fell in the prayer meeting the bible said they were all filled with the holy ghost they spake the word of god with boldness that word boldness is the same word for heart ephesians 6 verses 19 and 20 paul said pray for me that i may open my mouth boldly there's the word for hot the same greek word and then in verse 20 that that there and i may speak boldly as i ought to speak that i may speak hot as i ought to speak there's many other verses friends that use this word hot first corinthians 12 31 but covet earnestly the best gifts first corinthians 14 1 follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts revelation 3 19 as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous there's the fire again be on fire therefore and repent and there's many many more scriptures and there's many more scriptures about being fervent in the spirit acts 18 25 fervent in the spirit romans 12 verse 11 always laboring fervently for you in prayers colossians 4 verse 12. love one another with a pure heart fervently first peter 1 22 first peter 4 8 and above all things have fervent or hot charity if god's holy fire is in my soul as a seal can it ever become lukewarm scripture says no scripture says if my soul is sealed with the holy ghost i'm hopped and of course that's first john 3 9 and 10 whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother so here is absolute bible proof that our souls cannot be lukewarm once the seed of god has been quickened in our soul the seed of god cannot sin notice friends the holy ghost filled bride of jesus christ is the mouthpiece of god the bride is the mouthpiece through the holy spirit and the bible says the spear and the bride say come come to jesus christ come to the living waters of life in other words come to the baptism of the holy ghost so there's only one group on the earth today that's giving that invitation for the living waters and that's the holy ghost-filled bride of jesus christ churches who are not born again including denominational and messed churches are no longer the mouthpiece of god because they're lukewarm they're not born again only born-again churches can be the mouthpiece of jesus christ today because they're the only ones that are hot they're the only ones that are on fire for the gospel of jesus christ before finishing up this video i just want to give a prophet's description as brother ram differentiated between the hot church and the lukewarm church in his sermon from 1960 december the laodicean church age brother branham said chile services or lukewarm services will drive the true believer to the red hot services next he said services that show enthusiasm once in a while are lukewarm because they're only enthusiastic for the music so we must be enthusiastic for every part of the service prayer and the word of god he said in lukewarm churches there's no warmth of the holy ghost he said there is no burden for lost souls he says their lives are loaded down with worldly events causing them lukewarmness he said the lukewarm church is a business everyone has to be paid and complains if they're not paid the song leader or the musician or the preachers they complain if they're not paid he said lukewarm churches are concerned about the size of the crowd he said lukewarm churches are concerned more about the physical condition of the church more than the move of the holy ghost or the spiritual condition of the church brother graham said in lukewarm churches the people are afraid to say amen during the service and don't like when people act drunk in the spirit and lastly he said lukewarm churches have people that are afraid of the manifestation of gifts in their lives due to their fears about what others will think of them so friends we've been warned by jesus christ and god's prophet of this day brother william branham let's do everything in our power by the grace of god to be the hot on fire church in closing hope this video has been a blessing friends as i said at the beginning the origin of this video was a special day for me i i was rejoicing in the sermon that i heard and then that scriptural revelation of first john 3 verse 9 came to me as i walked up to the pulpit it was such a memorable time in the lord and then the lord inspired me to go through all these scriptures and preach this sermon to our local church here giving them the consolation that if their soul is born again their soul is always going to be hot for jesus christ because that seal or that hotness or that fire that oil lasts until the day of redemption but we've got a big job to do in our human minds our human spirits and our bodies to stir them up daily the bible says be renewed in the spirit of your mind day by day second corinthians 4 verse 16 and the bible says transform your mind by the renewing of the holy ghost in romans 12 verses 1 and 2. how do we do that as paul said in first corinthians 15 die daily may god grant to you and to me and our home churches that will be hot on fire for jesus christ that we will continue to be the mouthpiece of jesus christ on this earth speaking what the spirit says inviting others to come and drink of the waters of life freely and as brother brahm said in the church age book the spirit the prophet and the bride will all be saying the same thing and what they're saying has already been said in the bible so we thank the lord jesus christ for the bible the absolute of the holy scriptures and the absolute of his holy ghost inspiring us through the holy scriptures if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
