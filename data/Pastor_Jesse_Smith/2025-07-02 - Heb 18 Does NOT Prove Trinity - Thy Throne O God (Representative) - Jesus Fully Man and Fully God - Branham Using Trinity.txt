TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Jesus Christ was talking and God was talking in him also. Sometimes it was Christ himself. Sometimes it was the father that dwelt in him. You see, and he they couldn't understand some things he would say. They talked in riddles to them. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about Hebrews 1:8. Does Hebrews 1 prove that God is a trinity? The answer is again, no. Similar to the video that I did recently about John 17. In fact, it was the same viewer asked about both texts. And so, in the previous video, I forgot to talk about Hebrews 1. So, I'll make a separate video here on Hebrews 1. by the grace of God. Hebrews 1:8 is a quotation of Psalm 45:6. Thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever. The scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter. So no, Hebrews 1:8 does not show two persons talking in the Godhead, but it does show God's invisible spirit speaking to his visible son. If you have two persons talking in Hebrews 1:5, you have tri-theism, which is the worship of three separate gods, it's polytheism. Because remember the erroneous definition of the trinity is three co-equal, co-eternal persons. And in the previous video, we saw the illogical application of that thought. The example was when Jesus was filled with the spirit of God. According to the definition of the trinity, he was already co-equal with the spirit of God. So why does one co-equal person need filled with a second co-equal person? And then Jesus said in the book of John that the father dwelt in him as well. So now we have one fully God person being filled with two other fully co-equal persons. That makes no sense. Why does a person who's already co-equal with God need to be filled with two other co-equal gods? That's heathenism. There is only one God according to the scripture. There's only one person in the Godhead. As Hebrews 1:3 says, that's been my challenge to trinitarians ever since I received the truth of the Bible through the ministry of God's prophet, Brother William Brandham. Show me one verse that says God is three persons and trinitarians cannot do it because they have no Bible verse that says that. I love how brother Brandham explained this. He said with Jesus he was fully man and also fully God. He said sometimes the body was talking. In other words, sometimes the humanity was talking and sometimes the divinity was talking. So here's a quote on that. It's the curtain of time 1955. Brother Ram said the person Jesus Christ was talking and God was talking in him also. Sometimes it was Christ himself. Sometimes it was the father that dwelt in him. I like what brother Ram said. He talked in riddles to them. One time he said, "I come from God and I go back to God." Of course, that's in the book of John. The person Jesus Christ was talking and God was talking in him also. Sometimes it was Christ himself. Sometimes it was the father that dwelt in him. You see, and he they couldn't understand some things he would say. They talked in riddles to them. Jesus finally said when he was talking to him one day, I had came from God. I come into the world and I go back again to God. And friends, it is scriptural that Jesus spoke in riddles or mysteries. Matthew 13:34 and35 say, "All these things spake Jesus unto the multitudes in parables, and without a parable spake he not unto them, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables." And I love this, "I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world." Matthew 13:35 is a quotation of the Old Testament book, Psalm 78:2. Look at this prophecy of the Messiah. I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old. So Jesus was uttering secrets hidden from the foundation of the world. Now in the Hebrew dark sayings is defined as this, a riddle, difficult question, an enigma or hard to understand saying, a perplexing saying. So Jesus purposely spoke in riddles, hard sayings, mysteries. And the Bible said he did this to hide himself from the sinners, the wise and prudent. And then he would reveal himself to the babes, to the humble. That's according to Matthew 11:25 and 26. Jesus looked up and thanked God and said, "Oh father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent, hast revealed them unto the babes. Even so, Father, so it seemed good in thy sight." So, in other words, it was God's good pleasure to hide the truth from the prideful and the arrogant and the workers of iniquity. And this ties in perfectly with water baptism. Matthew 28:19. Jesus is speaking in a riddle here. Jesus is speaking in a mystery, an enigma. Go ye therefore teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost. Jesus is not saying he's a trinity of three persons. Jesus is speaking in a riddle saying there's one name to the father son holy ghost. He's speaking in a mystery and 10 days later Jesus Christ filled Peter with his holy ghost and Peter baptized in the literal name of Jesus Christ. And we know if we put all the baptism examples together the true baptism is the Lord Jesus Christ but it's a hidden mystery and Jesus thank God for it and we're thankful that Jesus has revealed it unto us by his grace. I think I'll read 1 Corinthians 8:6. But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him. Now notice in Colossians 1, it says, "All things are from Jesus." That's because Jesus is the manifestation of the Father, God's visible image, and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. Now, notice Paul doesn't reference the Holy Ghost here because Paul was not a trinitarian. Paul knew the father was a spirit and the father was holy because Jesus called him holy father. So Paul knew God the father was the same person as the holy ghost. So God is one God, not three persons. Before we read Hebrews 1, let's go over some important points again. Remember there's eight problems with the Trinity dogma. So I'll insert a repeat of those eight problems right now. Just real quick, I want to review the eight problems with the Trinity Dogma. I wrote about this in my 2021 book, pages 23 to 32. The first problem is the Trinity Dogma adds to the Bible. The second problem is Jesus and his apostles taught and affirmed pure monotheism rather than trinitarianism. The third proof is the Aanian creed or sixth century trinitarian confessional contains multiple contradictions to biblical teaching on the godhead and there are six examples in my book. The fourth problem is major Bible contradictions and inconsistencies exist among trinitarians. They can't even agree on what they believe. Fifth, the early trinitarians did not affirm the Holy Spirit was divine until the council of Constantinople in 381 AD. Six, Trinitarian images and artwork are often deceptive, creating false representations of the Godhead. Seventh, some Trinitarians use two fear tactics to persuade others to believe in the Trinity, heresy and hell. Eighth, and finally, God sending prophet named William Brandham to warn Christians about the false trinity doctrine with thus sayith the Lord. So that was the first point. The second point is again the Bible never says three persons and it's a sin to add to the Bible. Proverbs 30:5 and 6 says, "Add thou not unto God's pure words, lest thou be called a liar." So many people will be called a liar on the day of judgment because they added to the word of God. But we're not going to do that. We're just going to believe everything the Bible says about the Godhead. A third point is that the Godhead, remember, is a mystery according to Colossians 2:2. And the mysterious part is not the father and the holy ghost. The father and the holy ghost are the self-same person. The mysterious part is the father and the son. As we looked at in the last video, how Jesus would use plural pronouns. And God had to use plural pronouns because there were two manifestations or two elements. You had the father and the son. Invisible visible. So two elements, invisible, visible, two nouns, God, manifestation. So you have to use plural nouns. The fourth point is that we as humans are in the image of God according to Genesis chapter 1. And if we are in the image of God, each one of us are not three persons, but we have three elements or three aspects to our being, our body, our spirit, our mind, and then our soul. So if God was three persons, then each one of us would be three individual persons. But we're not. We're one person with three aspects to our being. And that's how God is. God the Father invisible person. God in the flesh, Jesus. God visible. God with us, Emmanuel. That's the son of God. And then God in us, the Holy Ghost. One God, one person with three aspects or elements or you could say three manifestations. God above us, God with us, God in us. And I had this thought before, but humans are one person a piece. But yet they can talk to the other aspects of them. And this is scriptural. It might sound kind of funny, but it's true. The scripture tells us this. The first is Luke 12:1 19. The rich fool says, "And I will say to my soul, soul, thou has much goods laid up for many years. Take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry." So who is this rich man talking to? His spirit is speaking to his soul. Another example is Psalm 42:5. Why art thou cast down, oh my soul? And why art thou disquited in me? Hope thou in God. So the psalmist encourages his own soul to trust in God. I can relate to this. Sometimes I'll say, Jesse, just get up. Why you sleeping in? Just get up. Or Jesse, go do this. You know you should do this. See, I'm talking to my own soul. Yet I'm one person. I'm not three persons. I'm one person. So God can do the same. Of course, it's the invisible spirit speaking to the visible son. And the last point I want to make is that Jesus's human body was and always will be subject to the invisible father, the invisible spirit. We see this in 1 Corinthians 11 1-3. I'll just read verse three. But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God. Christ means the anointed. So again, we go with the order woman, man, Christ, the anointed. What is Christ anointed with? The spirit of God, the invisible spirit. So, woman, man, Christ, God. Christ is the body of Jesus. The glorified body of Jesus. Now, but before that, before Jesus was on the earth, before Jesus' body was conceived, it was the theophony of Jesus. We call it the logos, the word. And the head of that logos word or even the glorified body of Jesus now is the invisible father. We also see this playing out in 1 Corinthians 15:24-28. A very mysterious but amazing scripture. Then cometh the end. This is speaking of the new Jerusalem when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the father, when he shall put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign till heath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is expected which did put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, the Son, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. What an amazing verse. Deep, mysterious, no doubt, an enigma, a dark saying, without a doubt. But yet, it's true. It's fact. The body of Jesus will always be submissive to the invisible father because again the body of Jesus could die when it was on earth. Even Jesus said the son doesn't know the day and hour of the rapture only the father. So the body of Jesus was limited in its humanity and therefore that body is always in subjection to the eternal invisible spirit of God. Okay, let's get to Hebrews chapter 1 here. by God's grace. Hebrews 1:es 1 and 2 speak of God speaking to us through his son. Verse one said, "In time past he spoke to the fathers by the prophets." Verse two hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son. So this is true. It's emphasizing the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament. Some people erroneously use this to say there's no more prophets. And so they try to make Brother Brandham not a prophet. Of course, that's a lie. All you have to do is go to Ephesians 4 8-16 and you'll see that Paul said Jesus ascended on high. Then he sent gifts down to men. And God would use these five preaching gifts till we all come in the unity of faith. And of course, we haven't done that yet. That's speaking of the time of the rapture when we all come into unity with the rapture anointing, the latter reign, rapturing faith we call it. So to say there's no more prophets would be to also say there's no more of the four other gifts, preaching gifts in the five-fold ministry. But of course there are still pastors, prophets, teachers, apostles, evangelists. So to get rid of prophets, you have to get rid of all the others. So that's a false doctrine to say that God no longer has prophets. Verse three is excellent for the godhead. Here's the verse where God says he's one person. Jesus is the express image of his person. That means faximile the exact reproduction of God's character in a man Jesus Christ. Verse four, being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. For unto which of the angels said he at any time, thou art my son. This day have I begotten thee and again I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son. So these verses show how the son is greater than angels. And of course this is speaking of theophony form. The first creation was the son the logos of god and then the bible says the logos of the word created all things. All things were created by Jesus Christ according to Ephesians 3:9. Specifically, Hebrews 1:8 was a quote of Psalm 45:6. Hebrews 1:6 says, "And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith, and let all the angels of God worship him." So here the logos or the word of God or the son of God is called the first begotten. That means he was the first thing that came forth out of God. And then God must have made angels right after that in order to worship his son. Verse 7. And of the angels he saith, who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire. Now Hebrews 1:8 is probably where the question is about the godhead. But unto the son he saith, "Thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever. A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom." Hebrews 1:9 also goes with this. It's quoting Psalm 45. Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity. Therefore, God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. So, of course, Hebrews 1:8-9 is a quotation of Psalm 45:6 and 7. So, these verses do not prove God is three persons. It shows the father speaking to the son. So, here we have the father calling the son god and that trips up trinitarians. But again, if you do that, now you have three gods or tritheism. Now in the Greek this word God is the word for God's supreme deity, a deity. And one of the definitions is God's representative. So that's what Jesus was. Jesus the logos was a visible representative of the father God. So in other words, it could have said, "Thy throne, O representative." Of course, he also could have said, "Thy throne, oh son, is forever and ever." So, we can't let this one word give us a license to add to the Bible. Now, there's numerous other scriptures where Jesus calls the father God. So, let's go over those as well. John 20:17, Jesus said unto her, "Touch me not, for I'm not yet ascended to my father, but go to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my father and your father and to my God and your God." So, this shouldn't stumble us. Jesus was ascending to the invisible spirit. He's ascending to my God. He's ascending to my father, my creator, right? For the body of Jesus was created. The theophony of Jesus was created. So, he had to send to his creator. So, we could just interchange that word God with creator, to my creator and to your creator. And this is what brother was talking about. Sometimes the body was speaking, sometimes God was speaking. So, in this case, the body of Jesus is speaking. The body was ascending to its creator. Another great one is Revelation 3:12. Him that overcomemeth will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out, and I'll write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is a new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and I'll write upon him my new name. So again, Jesus says my God three times. In other words, my creator, my father. He's not saying my other co-equal person because remember the body of Jesus was not co-equal with God. Jesus said the father is greater than I. Jesus said the son can do nothing of himself but what he see the father doeth the son doeth likewise. And there was knowledge Jesus didn't know the human body. He didn't know the day or hour. Only the father knew the day and hour of his second coming. Another thing to look at which might be another video is the use of gods. Because God even called prophets gods and God even called the faithful Israelites gods. One example is Psalm 82:1, a psalm of Asaf. God standeth in the congregation of the mighty. He judgeth among the gods. Now, this verse is not talking about fake gods. It's talking about the believers who are in the congregation of God. So, this word, if you click on the word in the Hebrew, he judges among the gods. This word means rulers or judges or godlike one. So the best definition of this would be rulers or judges. God judges among the judges of Israel or the spiritual leaders of Israel, the mighty ones of Israel. And this reminds us of the New Testament how we're called kings and priests unto God. So what do kings do? They judge. They rule. So he judges among the kings and priests in the Old Testament because remember Israel was a nation, a priesthood unto God, a nation of kings and priests. John 10:35, Jesus is quoting Exodus. If he called them gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken. So here prophets are called gods. So I believe this is Jesus speaking in his dark speeches, his enigmas, his mysteries, his riddles. Again, this means God's representative. So prophets are God's representatives. Another word in the New Testament that might help you is ambassadors. 2 Corinthians 5:20. Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ. So all these words are interchangeable. Gods, judges, rulers, kings, priests, ambassadors. So we just have to believe what the Bible says and not add our own interpretation. Adding three persons to the Godhead is adding your own erroneous, false interpretation to the Bible. So let's finish Hebrews 1:10. And thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth. The heavens are the works of thine hands. They shall perish, but thou remainest, and they all shall wax old as doth the garment, and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed. But thou art the same, and thy years fail not. But to which of the angels said he at any time, sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foottool? So this tells us the invisible spirit had his son sit at his right hand. and right hand is not literal. It's representative of power and authority. In other words, sitting on God's throne. Verse 14, are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation? So, I think I'll close with this visual here. It's the God of the sun. So, we have these three phrases in the scripture. Oh God, speaking of Hebrews 1:8, thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever. Jesus said he'd descend to your father, your God, and my God. And here's another good one um quoting David. The Lord said unto my Lord, Psalm 110:1, a Psalm of David, the Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foottool. So this means the father said unto the son. There's not two lords. There's not two persons in the godhead. There's not two gods. It's the father saying to the son. It's the invisible one speaking to the visible one. So again, the invisible father is the god or supreme deity of the son. The deity of the father created the image of the son and then dwelt in his son. The son is the logos or the word. And remember according to 1 Timothy 6:16, the divinity of God, the father dwells in the light. the father is in the son. So I think that's a good thought. This scripture, the Lord said unto my Lord, is the same idea or revelation as Hebrews 1:8, thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever. There's not two lords, there's not two gods, but it's recognizing the son is subject to the father just as 1 Corinthians 15 shows. In closing, friends, hope this study was a blessing by the grace of God. This has been wonderful to tie all these scriptures together. And again, the most important thing is adding not unto God's word as God tells us numerous times. Proverbs 35 and 6, Revelation 22 18 and 19. Remember, if people add to the word of God, plagues will be added to them in this life perhaps, but certainly in the next life. So, we don't want to add to the word. We don't want to take away from the word of God. Let's be humble enough just to accept what the Bible says and just say what the Bible says. That's a point I shared with somebody recently. What's astounding is that trinitarians say they're solless scriptor, which means by scripture alone. They only believe the scripture, yet they insert their threeperson false doctrine, their trinity dogma. So see friends, trinitarians just are blind in many ways. And I believe some of them can still be saved, but spiritually they're blind. They say they're solar scripura, but they're not because they add three persons. They add trinity. They add co-equal, co-distinct persons to the Bible. We don't need a creed. We just need the Bible. So, we're thankful for the Holy Ghost today. He's the dissolver of all doubts. So, hopefully this video has dissolved any doubts people have about the Godhead. The Son will always be subject to the Father, the visible image of God will always be subject to the invisible God. And so, we friends, we we are the children of God. We're the offspring of God. And we will always be subject to God. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. is never fails. [Music]
