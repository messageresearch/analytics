TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 6 the mystery of christ in you the baptism of the holy ghost chapter 6 includes footnotes numbers 804-971 to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory colossians 1 27 during your earthly journey you could have no greater privilege than for jesus christ spirit to permanently live inside you all the days of your life the epigraph shows how paul calls this abiding presence christ in you similarly jesus calls it the baptism of the holy ghost this permanency privilege was unavailable in the old testament and is one of the major purposes and benefits of the new testament the baptism of the holy ghost is one of the better promises contained in the better covenant or new testament god walked with adam and eden but he wanted something better now he wants to walk in you god says i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people the verse preceding the epigraph colossians 1 verse 26 calls the holy ghost baptism the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints the baptism of the holy ghost is a hidden mystery god purposely kept from ancient ages generations and saints as you'll soon see job david and other saints knew they lacked something or rather someone namely they lacked the comforter in their souls the spirit of truth the holy ghost beginning with moses and extending the next 1500 years the lord first had to show the weakness of the law through human flesh the failure of the law would magnify the need for the holy ghost baptism god then sent his son jesus as the first to be filled with and walk according to the holy spirit in the fullness of time the holy ghost came rushing into the believer's souls on the day of pentecost so man for the first time could walk not after the flesh but after the spirit the foretelling and announcing of the baptism of the holy ghost the prophets joel jeremiah and ezekiel foretold the permanent anointing of the baptism of the holy ghost some 800 and 600 years before christ this long-awaited promise of god's indwelling permanent power was first experienced on the day of pentecost in acts chapter 2. joel described this experience as god freely pouring out his spirit upon believers of all ages and peter validated joel by quoting him in acts 2 verses 16-21 jeremiah fashioned this baptism as god writing his commands upon the hearts of his believing children and the writer of hebrews confirmed this in hebrews 8 verse 10 ezekiel 36 27 says the holy ghost baptism or god's spirit within you would cause or empower god's saints to walk in his statutes keep and do his judgments the new testament opens with john the baptist baptizing repentant ones john is aware his baptism unto repentance is solely an immersion in water he knows he is sent to baptize with water his close relationship with god gave him knowledge to announce the coming messiah would baptize his followers with something greater than water the holy ghost mark 1 verse 8 records john saying i indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost although baptism unto repentance is a necessary experience john knew there was a greater experience than just being baptized in water mark 1 verses 9 through 12 records jesus's water baptism administered by john this was no ordinary baptism for the heavens opened and god's spirit descended in the form of a dove a parallel passage in john 1 33 says the spirit descended and remained upon christ indeed the spirit abode upon him luke 4 verse 1 describes jesus as being full of the holy ghost after john baptized him you conclude that jesus christ is the first to be baptized with the holy ghost and is commissioned to baptize others into this blessed fellowship after his resurrection this explains why jesus foretells his disciples they would experience the same holy ghost baptism he had saying ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with jesus himself says he was sealed by the father and the word seal is repeatedly used by paul to describe the baptism of the holy ghost in second corinthians 1 verse 22 ephesians 1 verse 13 and ephesians 4 30. the four gospels contain jesus's announcements of the baptism of the holy ghost during his earthly ministry after he himself was filled with god's spirit in the first year of jesus's public ministry you read his first extensive teaching on the baptism of the holy ghost found in john chapter 3 verses 1 through 12 during his conversation with a pharisee named nicodemus four times jesus says believers must be born again or born of the spirit christ foretold the sudden powerful appearing of the soul baptism by comparing it to the wind the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hears the sound thereof but can't not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit when nicodemus couldn't understand the born-again requirement jesus challenged him by saying art thou a master of israel and knoweth not these things it seems jesus expected a master scholar like nicodemus to recall the aforementioned old testament prophecies of the holy ghost from joel jeremiah and ezekiel in jesus second year ministry he preaches the sermon on the mount christ's fourth beatitude hints of the baptism of the holy ghost matthew 5 6 says blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they should be filled later while teaching his disciples to pray messiah explains the simplicity in which we ask for the holy ghost and the heavenly father gives it luke 11 13 reads if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him during christ's third year of ministry he gave arguably the boldest most public invitation for the soon-to-be available baptism of the holy ghost in john chapter 7. verse 2 informs us jesus is with thousands of jews celebrating the feast of tabernacles in jerusalem 18th century theologian john gill provides contextual insight on the astounding meaning of this passage gil describes a jewish traditional ceremony of drawing and pouring water that occurred during the solemn assembly on the last day of the feast the eighth day in which no servile work was done since moses ordained this last feast to be a time of rejoicing in leviticus 23 40 jews would shout and dance as the priest drew water from the pool of siloam and poured it into a basin at the altar to fulfill isaiah 12 3 therefore with joy shall you draw water out of the wells of salvation this ceremony had dual purposes the first was to rejoice in god's annual pouring out of the water of his spirit to wash and forgive israel through the day of atonement second prayer was offered beseeching god for sufficient natural reigns for the ensuing agricultural year israel was approaching god in thanksgiving for the waters of forgiveness and seeking god for natural water for their crops at some point on the last day of that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water john 7 39 says christ was referring to the living waters of the holy spirit that would be given after jesus receives his glorified body following his resurrection more about jesus's glorified body will be explained later in this chapter but imagine the thousands of jews silent and stunned viewing the young controversial rabbi loudly declaring he was offering eternal water greater than the upcoming reigns israelis were trusting in to sustain their natural life jesus was the very god they were praying to standing among them offering them eternal water for their souls shortly before his arrest and crucifixion in his third and final year of ministry christ taught his apostles about the holy ghost baptism during their final intimate hours after the passover on their way to the garden of gethsemane in john chapters 14-17 indeed christ promised to send another comforter even the spirit of truth later naming the comforter as the holy ghost who shall be in you christ continually emphasizes future dwelling inside his disciples meaning inside their souls saying i in you in john 14 20. jesus later says twice i in them in john 17 verse 23 and 17 26 on at least two occasions following his resurrection christ instructed his apostles to wait or tarry for the holy ghost which he refers to as the promise of the father despite following jesus and performing miracles for over three years the apostles were not born again jesus death and resurrection he urged his disciples to receive this baptism john 20 verse 22 reads and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the holy ghost some of his final words before leaving his disciples assured them he would send the baptism of the holy ghost recorded in acts 1 verses 5 through 8. christ uttered for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you finally fifty days after jesus resurrection on the day of pentecost 120 disciples received the baptism of the holy ghost while tearing in an upper room acts 2 verse 4 records and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance this holy spirit baptism caused the once timid and fearful disciples to flow into the streets of jerusalem and saturate the city with loud noisy praise at 9 am in the morning thankfully the same holy spirit is available to us today but many are confused about how and when he comes the confusion about the mystery of the holy ghost baptism the confusion around the baptism of the holy ghost doctrine or born-again experience is widespread and carries massive repercussions when and how is a believer baptized with the holy ghost the revelation of the holy ghost baptism is christ's spirit permanently indwelling and sealing marking the believer's soul as the third work of grace i'll first show the two false extremes most churches gravitate towards before using biblical proof to identify precisely when and how a believer is born again there are two extremes most churches erroneously gravitate towards unemotional confession or emotional speaking in unknown tongues evangelicals foster the unemotional confession while charismatics and pentecostal denominations demand emotional speaking in unknown tongues from this point forward charismatics and pentecostal denominations will be referred to in one group as charismatics many evangelicals say you're already born again as soon as you invite jesus into your heart or recite the sinner's prayer sadly no scripture teaches new believers to recite a scripted generic unemotional prayer to invite jesus into their hearts instead the book of acts models zealous repentance from sin followed by water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and then a sealing with the holy ghost baptism in most cases the born-again experience follows water baptism at a future date true repentance is turning from and hating your previous sin which is often left out of the stoic evangelical salvation prayer the charismatics swing to the other extreme urging and requiring new believers to emotionally utter unknown words as evidence of being born again while having an emotional experience with god is impactful speaking in unknown tongues as the evidence of being born again is unscriptural on the day of pentecost all 17 nationalities heard and understood peter and the christians declaring the wonderful works of god in their own native languages the 120 believers spoke in other languages unknown to them such as iranian greek persian latin coptic and more but the tongues were all understood modern charismatic showcase their erroneous teachings when they speak in unknown tongues and no one understands their words in acts chapter 2 all inspired tongues were understood by the hears today in charismatic churches most tongues confuse the hearers god is not the author of confusion in the assembly of the saints tongues as the evidence churches are majoring on a minor emphasizing the gift of tongues rather than the giver of the gifts figure 15 shows the correct middle of the road approach to the holy ghost and the two erroneous approaches that are on the fringes of the road to heaven figure 15 extreme emphasis on confession dangerous fringe on one fringe the new believer publicly confesses faith in jesus christ as savior but neither seeks nor shows emotion his clergy completely avoid using the baptism of the holy ghost terminology despite the fact jesus used it in acts 1 verse 5. true baptism of the holy ghost middle of the road in the middle of the road lays the truth the believer publicly confesses faith in jesus christ and seeks to receive god's spirit with a bold liberating emotional experience based upon god's choosing the believer may prophesy speak in an unknown tongue shout weep dance scream or show other emotions sinners who witness this experience would call the believer drunk extreme emphasis on tongues dangerous fringe on the other fringe after publicly confessing faith in jesus christ as savior the believer seeks to boldly speak with unknown tongues as the evidence of the new birth based upon man's choosing in acts 2 all the tongues were understood but today few or none understand what is spoken when people speak in tongues sadly this believer seeks the unknown tongue's gift rather than the giver of the gifts the holy ghost the negative repercussions of both fringe teachings hurt millions of church-goers because they lack the permanent indwelling presence of christ the baptism of the holy ghost is a seal unto the day of redemption meaning it's a permanent mark of god's anointing and influence upon a believer's soul this anointing never leaves the believer without this permanent seal the evangelicals and charismatics are like jesus's description of homeowners who build their houses upon sand rather than rock in matthew 7 verses 24 through 27. when the storms of life come in various forms of temptations those without the permanent seal of god often see their testimony fall apart as they indulge in adultery greed idolatry drugs and other sins temporary testimonies abound in their churches rather than permanent lifelong memorials of obedience and dedication to the glory of jesus christ for evangelicals many are deprived of personally experiencing god's power in any form in luke 24 verse 49 jesus says believers are endued or clothed with power upon receiving the holy ghost but unemotional confessions usually lead to compromising sin loving church members because they never receive god's power to overcome temptations without supernatural power church members submit to temptations and learn to live in idolatrous sins under the guise of liberty or freedom in christ as second timothy 3 verse 5 says they have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof charismatics exalt personal experience above bible truth while they may experience god's power in the form of emotional tongue speaking they often stop short of experiencing god's power in their souls hebrews 4 verse 10 speaks of this power calling it a rest from selfish individual works the repercussion then of exalting tongue speaking above the true holy ghost baptism in the soul is coming short of the new birth and god's full inheritance just as israel tasted the massive grapes of canaan before rejecting god's leading to possess the land charismatic's taste of the glorious gifts of the holy ghost like tongue speaking but reject god's desire to possess their every decision the obvious result for charismatics is wandering for decades in the same false doctrine of unknown tongues as the evidence of the holy ghost just as israel wandered in the wilderness for 40 years biblical evidence for the revelation of the holy ghost baptism now that the two extremes have been described and debunked here is biblical proof for when and how a believer is baptized with the holy ghost when is a believer baptized with the holy ghost a christian is born again sometime after he is justified saved and completely sanctified rid of sinful habits in short you're born again after the first two works of grace are complete chapter 5 fully details the three works of grace needed for god's spirit to completely possess a christian justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost god gives the holy ghost the third work of grace to them that obey him by being justified and sanctified four examples from the book of acts validate this truth the first text acts 1 verses 12 through 15 records about 120 christians which included jesus's 11 remaining apostles and godly women gathering in an upper room in jerusalem to receive the holy ghost when did they receive the holy ghost 10 days later after god finished sanctifying them acts 2 verses 1 through 4 describes their holy ghost baptisms the holy ghost fell in a group setting as they all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication in the upper room for ten days although they were saved at different times before gathering in the upper room their complete sanctification came at the same time through group prayer and supplication consider the three works of grace in the life of mary the mother of jesus she was saved at some point prior to her meeting with elizabeth for she declared god as her savior in luke 1 verses 46 and 47 and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior mary's sanctification must have lasted well over 30 years she first had to give birth to jesus and then his ministry began at the age of 30 and lasted over three years but the faithful god finished her sanctification by giving her the gift of the holy ghost at pentecost mary is recorded as being in the upper room in acts 1 verse 14. acts 8 verses 5 through 25 is a second text about philip's evangelistic ministry in the city of samaria when did the samaritans receive the baptism of the holy ghost after peter and john laid hands on them and prayed for them to receive the holy ghost it's crucial to recognize that the samaritans were already believers before peter and john laid hands on them for they had seen miracles and were baptized in water this text wonderfully proves the difference between water baptism and the holy ghost baptism as you can believe in jesus christ have been baptized in his name and yet still not be baptized with the holy ghost in your soul reading acts 8 15-17 unveils this revelation for peter and john had to pray for the samaritans to receive the holy ghost because he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus then they laid their hands on them and they received the holy ghost what you and every believer needs today is the holy ghost to fall upon your soul baptizing your nature with god's divine nature although salvation is a magnificent step god wants complete preeminence in christians lives he wants believers daily empowered by the holy ghost the samaritans then quickly experienced the three works of grace in acts 8 verses 5-13 samaritans witnessed miracles and were justified being saved and baptized in the name of the lord jesus not the titles father son and holy ghost see chapter 1 sanctification took place in their lives from the time they were baptized until peter and john arrived after news spread to jerusalem of their conversions the holy ghost fell upon them as peter and john lay their hands on them and prayed the third text of acts 10 verses 1 through 48 shows a scene in caesarea in which gentiles in the house of cornelius the centurion received the baptism of the holy ghost when did cornelius and the many in his house receive this soul baptism they received the holy ghost baptism while peter preached to them acts 10 44 states while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word concerning the three works of grace cornelius and his household were already saved and sanctified before meeting peter acts 10 verses 36 and 37 proves cornelius had heard about christ and believed although he had not yet been water baptized peter said that word i say ye know which was the truth that god preached peace by jesus christ to israel consider how sanctified cornelius was before he met peter and compare your life to his for a moment scripture calls cornelius a devout man who constantly prayed fasted and gave alms to people in so much that the visiting angel told him heaven had a memorial of all his prayers and alms being in this sanctified condition it's easy to see how peter could preach a short 10 verse long sermon and the holy ghost could fall upon cornelius and his household forever baptizing their souls into the kingdom of god amazingly this text gives one more astounding fact many don't realize god can fill believers with the holy ghost before they are baptized in water yes god can send the spiritual soul baptism before a man knows about the natural water baptism acts 10 verses 47 and 48 records peter's command for cornelius and his house to be baptized in water after they had been baptized with the holy ghost saying can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord then pray they him to tarry certain days you learn the physical act of being baptized in water doesn't save and forgive sins water alone has no virtue to save calling upon the lord in obedience to his command for repentance has virtue to save romans 10 verses 12 and 13 reads for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved water baptism is simply an outward expression of the inward work of grace that has taken place you also learn through the example of corneas household that anyone who is spiritually baptized with the holy ghost will immediately be baptized in water when commanded to do so before peter preached in his house carnius was already saved by believing in christ for the forgiveness of sins and was sanctified living a selfless life of prayer fasting and almsgiving no one knows why he hadn't yet been baptized in water but one possibility is there was a separation of jews and gentiles in those days cornelius a gentile would not have been allowed to be in the company of jews and therefore could not hear preaching about being baptized in water before peter's great sheep vision the jewish christians had not yet received the revelation of god's grace extending to the gentiles peter acknowledged the end of this jew gentile segregation saying of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons in fact the whole point of peter's great sheep vision in acts 10 verses 9 through 16 was to prepare him to see god pour out the holy ghost upon the gentiles whom he had previously considered too unclean to be god's people acts 19 verses 1 through 7 is a fourth text in which paul meets 12 disciples of john the baptist in ephesus a city in modern day turkey when did these 12 ephesians receive the baptism of the holy ghost after paul opened their understanding to the existence of the baptism of the holy ghost this shows believers can be justified and sanctified without having knowledge of the third work of grace the baptism of the holy ghost as taught in acts 18 verses 24 through 28 the ephesian church was led by its bold and eloquent teacher apollos he was mighty in the scriptures and instructed in the way of the lord apollos's fervency caused him to diligently and publicly proclaim the repentance doctrine of john the baptist undoubtedly his teaching caused believers to be justified and sanctified before god later aquila and priscilla helped increase apollos's understanding of the way of god and apollos mightily convinced the jews showing by the scriptures that jesus was christ apollos and his group were justified and sanctified but unaware of the holy ghost baptism until god sent his hand-picked apostle paul on his third and final missionary journey upon his arrival we are only told paul's one question for the saved and sanctified ephesians have ye received the holy ghost sin she believed paul didn't doubt their belief in christ he wondered whether christ was inside their souls their response was that they had not heard of the holy ghost baptism paul knew what most preachers today do not the holy ghost fills you sometime after you believe not when you believe god doesn't fill a vessel until it is justified or declared his and also sanctified or cleaned out you wouldn't immediately use a cup you found laying on the grass at the park no matter how pretty or what the name brand was you'd first take it home and wash it before filling and using it god showed paul the three works of grace and he wrote the same in ephesians 1 verse 13 saying in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise the holy ghost filling comes sometime after you believe as a seal for your soul truly acts chapters 2 8 and 10 agree with chapter and validate christians receive the holy ghost after believing or after their moment of salvation and after being sanctified from sinful habits two more points can be made from paul's ephesus visit first in paul's day there were two different water baptisms john the baptists and the lord jesus christ baptism john the baptist's water baptism represented repentance unto salvation but the lord jesus christ water baptism represented the desire to obtain the spiritual soul baptism of the holy ghost this situation was prevalent in paul's day because believers were leaving the old testament for the new and john's baptism was a preliminary act to prepare the way of the lord meaning it prepared new testament believers for the spiritual baptism of the holy ghost the lord jesus christ water baptism with the promise to receive the baptism of the holy ghost is your golden opportunity to enter god's kingdom the ephesians could not be born again without knowledge of and obedience to the lord jesus christ water baptism because they were ignorant of its existence nor can believers today be born again without the knowledge of the full soul baptism of the holy ghost this two baptism situation still exists today in a different form because most churches don't teach the necessary doctrine that the water baptism is different from the soul baptism most clergy tell new converts they are already born again when they are water baptized but this is a major error a second point is that god allows re-baptism in water acts 19 verses 3 through 5 says the ephesians were already water baptized unto john's water baptism but paul informed them they needed to be water baptized in the literal name of the lord jesus the ephesians knew of and believed in christ but were ignorant of the lord jesus christ water baptism upon their obedience and water baptisms paul laid his hands upon them and the holy ghost came on them in your case you may need re-baptized and this is acceptable unto god according to acts 19 verses 1-7 if you were sprinkled or if the title's father-son holy ghost were invoked at your previous baptism you need re-baptized fully immersed in water while calling upon the literal name of the lord jesus christ a few of my brothers were sprinkled as babies but upon seeing god's revelation of the lord jesus christ baptism they were gladly re-baptized and filled with the holy ghost afterwards in my life i was wrongly baptized in the titles father son and holy ghost and also in the jesus only format but god graciously allowed me to be correctly baptized on my third attempt in the name of the lord jesus christ god's peace will fill your soul when you've been correctly baptized in water and spiritually baptized with the holy ghost how is a believer baptized with the holy ghost he's born again by the spirit of god falling into his soul from heaven causing a bold liberating emotional worship experience i call it the see and hear principle because that is what peter called it every time a believer was filled with the holy ghost in the book of acts observers could see and hear the outward effects of their inward soul baptism just as you see and hear a natural baby's birth you see and hear a christian spiritual birth five texts from the book of acts illustrate this revelation and acts 11 15 proves the holy ghost will fall into the souls of men in a similar worshipful manner every time and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning yes the spiritual birth experience will be a bold liberating worship experience for every christian every christian must have an experience of being baptized with the holy ghost but not every experience is exactly the same there is not one specific outward evidence of the soul baptism as i'll soon explain there can be varieties of expressions at the literal moment of receiving the baptism of the holy ghost such as speaking in tongues so others can understand the gospel declaring god's wonderful works prophesying or magnifying god but each experience is unashamedly life-changing a believer's experience must also be word based meaning the christian can identify how his experience matches one of those in the book of acts when the holy ghost fell upon souls it's as if you were there in the upper room in acts chapter 2 because you've had a similar experience lyrics to isaiah martin's 1906 hymn i'm glad i'm one of them joyfully ring in the hearts of all born again believers they were gathered in the upper room all praying in his name they were baptized with the holy ghost and power for service came now what he did for them that day he'll do for you the same i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them one of them one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them one of them one of them i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them while emotion comes with a see and hear experience it's not the focus of it lots of worshipers get emotional but never fully repent of their sins to experience a changed life the focus at the beginning of the sea and hear experience is lovingly praising god while asking him to fill your soul our father loves to hear his children pray and ask him to fulfill his word just as earthly fathers enjoy meeting their children's requests jesus says in luke 11 13 if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him in acts 2 verses 1 through 33 peter originates the see and hear principle by telling the multitude therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he has shed forth this which ye now see in here earlier in the chapter the 120 believers got so full of the holy ghost that they left the upper room and went into the streets of jerusalem about 9 am declaring the wonderful works of god in such a way that they were accused of being drunk on wine the holy ghost and the souls of these freshly filled christians caused the praises of god to flow out of their souls into their minds and then further out into their bodies and mouths as they moved around the streets and boldly spake of god's works it's been said a natural birth is a mess and so is a spiritual birth all the joy loud worship emotion and victory comes flowing out at once it looks messy to the world like natural drunkenness but it's a spiritual birth it's an emergence it's eternal life acts 2 is not an unemotional scripted sinner's prayer experience this was the promised living water jesus spoke about flowing out of satisfied souls freshly filled with eternal life note how acts 2 verses 6 through 11 teaches the multitude understood everything these holy ghost-filled galileans were saying the seeing here principle is seen a second time in acts 4 31 as recently born again christians prayed for boldness to speak god's word and scripture says the holy ghost filled all saints who were praying for this petition this powerful prayer meeting followed the miraculous healing of a lame man at the gate beautiful after performing the miracle through god's power peter and john were arrested and threatened to not speak jesus name anymore once released among the brethren again acts 4 verse 25 says they lifted up their voice to god with one accord their prayers asked for signs wonders and miracles to be done by the name of thy holy child jesus god was so pleased that he shook the building and those who had not been born again were immediately filled for the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness observe all you can see and hear in this event a shaking building and many loud bold voices the heavenly father smiled as his spiritual babies were born acts 8 verses 14 through 25 depicts the samaritans receiving the baptism of the holy ghost and the seeing here principle is evident the same worship experience from acts 2 in jerusalem is now happening nearly 100 miles away in samaria after peter and john lay hands upon the samaritans and the holy ghost falls upon them a former sorcerer and recent christian convert named simon is so amazed by how the samaritans act upon receiving the holy ghost that he offers peter money if he will give him the power to lay hands on people to impart the holy ghost simon was well acquainted with seeing satan manipulate molest and bewitch people through his own evil sorceries but had never witnessed such genuine pure holy and righteous empowerment as saints receiving the baptism of the holy ghost ultimately simon pleads with peter for prayer that god will forgive him of thinking he could purchase the power to impart the holy ghost to believe her souls simon had to learn what john the baptist taught it is jesus christ alone who baptizes with the holy ghost not any other person a third text about how the holy ghost falls is acts 10 verses 44 through 48. though small this text and its description in the following chapter provides great support for the see and hear principle during peter's sermon inside corneos's house the gift of the holy ghost is poured out upon many gentiles the jews with peter heard them speak with tongues and magnify god praise and worship directed to god always flows out of the mouths of spiritual babes these tongues were no doubt understood by the jews and anyone else in hearing distance because peter later returned to jerusalem and told his jewish brethren that god gave the gentiles the gift of the holy ghost like as he did unto us acts 11 15 proves the holy ghost fell on gentiles in the same way it fell upon jews in acts chapter 2. additionally peter's jerusalem testimony in acts 11 teaches the presence of the holy ghost inside a holy ghost-filled believer's soul can recognize when someone else has received the baptism of the holy ghost watching the samaritans receive the holy ghost brought jesus's words to peter's remembrance and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost for as much then as god gave them the light gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life a believer with god's own eternal life can often recognize when a fellow believer is born again paul confirms this truth in romans 8 verse 16 saying the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god first john 5 6 and verse 8 say it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one the final time recorded in acts in which believers receive the holy ghost is chapter 19 verses one through seven and the seeing hear principle is displayed by two expressions speaking with tongues and prophesying acts 19 verse 6 says and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied god sent tongues to share his works with the ephesians it's implied that these disciples were not alone there must have been unbelievers amongst the group of 12 because tongues are a sign for unbelievers not believers first corinthians 14 22 reads wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not prophecy a dramatic gift to assure believers of god's foreknowledge and omniscience accompany the tongues for telling things to come they would soon witness the fulfillment of revelation 19 verse 10 promises prophecy for those with jesus's spirit saying the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy supernatural prophecy will be present among christians but no not all christians prophesy according to first corinthians 12 verses 29-31 unknown tongues are not the evidence of the holy ghost baptism millions of charismatic churches worldwide erroneously teach speaking in unknown tongues is the initial evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost while the seeing here principle agrees believers must have an emotional bold and liberating worship experience at the initial moment of receiving the baptism of the holy ghost the bible allows for different expressions in the worship experience unknown tongue speaking is not the evidence of being born again six proofs validate this claim first all instances of speaking in tongues in the book of acts were understood by the hearers but today they are mostly unknown genuine tongues from the holy ghost in the book of acts were always understood by the hears when sent by god all hearers always understood what was said in acts 2 verses 4 through 12 acts 10 verses 44 through 46 and acts 19 verses 1 through 6 when the holy ghost fell and tongues were manifested the proof of this is found in acts 11 15. when peter said the holy ghost fell at the house of cornelius the same way it did on the day of pentecost since all the tongues that manifested on the day of pentecost were understood by the 17 nations of hearers than any other tongues given when the holy ghost fell in the book of acts had to be understood as well based upon the testimony of peter and the fact that god and his ways are unchanging in modern services there are usually unknown tongues and no one understands what is being spoken which is completely opposite of what took place in acts chapters 2 10 and 19. second the bible does not record tongues being manifested every time believers were born again speaking in tongues is mentioned three out of the five times in the book of acts when the holy ghost fell and filled believers but not five out of five this proof speaking in tongues is not present every time the holy ghost comes god must have a need to manifest the power of tongues or he will not send that manifestation known tongues were present in acts 2 verses 1 through 5 acts 10 verses 44 through 46 and acts 19 verses 5 and 6 but not in acts 4 verse 31 and acts 8 verse 17. the two instances without tongues acts 4 verse 31 and acts 8 verse 17 show god must not have needed tongues because all the believers present spoke the same language third paul taught not all christians speak in tongues first corinthians 12 verses 29 through 31 says are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show i unto you a more excellent way paul's repeated questioning proves there is diversity in gifts of the holy ghost not all speak with tongues therefore it's wrong to try and convince every believer that they must speak in unknown tongues this ungodly teaching is like pressuring every christian to perform a miracle like satan twice pressured jesus to tempt his father to perform miracles note though paul wrote in 1st corinthians 14 verses 5 and 6 he wished all believers would speak in tongues because of the powerful edification that the gift brings to the individual and the potential edification it can bring to an entire congregation if the unknown tongue would be interpreted so everyone understood what the tongue said fourth tongues are signs for unbelievers not believers tongues are not a sign for believers according to first corinthians 14 22 wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe this means tongues cannot be assigned to believers who are seeking the baptism of the holy ghost yet many churches teach the opposite a man seeking the baptism of the holy ghost is already a believer and doesn't need the sign of speaking in unknown tongues to believe he is born again the seeker does need a sea in here experience but it's wrong to require him to speak in an unknown tongue gifts are determined by god not man first corinthians 12 11 and 18 say god divides gifts to every man based upon his will as it pleases him in acts chapter 2 the first tongues were spoken by the 120 saints in order to get the unbelievers to believe this matches what paul says in first corinthians 14 verse 22. tongues are assigned to unbelievers the 120 spoke in unknown tongues so the foreigners from 17 different locations could hear the wonderful works of god and then repent be baptized and fill with the holy ghost fifth no one knows the source of an unknown tongue without an interpretation the problem with unknown tongues being the absolute evidence a person is born again is that no one knows the source of the tongue unless it is interpreted and judged this is why paul says in first corinthians 14 verses 28 29 all tongues and interpretations need judged and if there are no interpreters for those who speak in unknown tongues the tongues should be kept silent in the church the fact is most initial evidence churches don't judge unknown tongues unknown tongues cannot be the evidence of the holy ghost baptism because if it is then you would have to accept every kind of unknown tongue from any person as in evidence of being born again but speaking in tongues can be easily impersonated by the devil and his servants as reports from missionaries verify this religious encyclopedias describe one of the evidences of demon possession as speaking in an unknown tongue commonly called glossolalia witches and other workers of witchcraft are not born again by the spirit of god just because they speak in unknown tongues god desires tongues of men and angels to be manifested among his people as paul taught that the gift of tongues should be in the church but it must be used properly and kept in order paul placed great emphasis on understanding the meaning of tongues in first corinthians 14 verses 6 11 and 19 saying unknown tongues only profit if they are interpreted the apostle said he'd rather speak five words with understanding than ten thousand in unknown tongues speakers and unknown tongues seem like barbarians to the listeners without interpretations the three thousand souls saved on the day of pentecost didn't think the 120 holy ghost-filled saints were barbarians they understood the wonderful works of god they were declaring and received christ for themselves the holy ghost does not come with one mandated observation unknown tongues as jesus taught in luke 17 verse 20 the kingdom of god cometh not with observation it comes with a powerful dynamic worship experience others can see and hear a pure godly and overcoming life follows the see and hear experience which leads to the next proof unknown tongues are not in evidence of the new birth six jesus taught what the real evidence of receiving the holy ghost is and it isn't unknown tongues in john 14 verse 26 and chapter 16 verse 13 jesus says the evidence of being born again is being led by the spirit into all truth john 14 verse 26 reads but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you john 16 verse 13 declares how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come the evidence you are a child of god is that you can be taught to continually live a more holy obedient and righteous lifestyle john 6 verse 45 says it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me this evidence manifested in christ's own earthly life luke 2 verse 52 says jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man christ's holy character will manifest in every believer's life meekness and humility are prerequisites for the high calling of living a christ-like life for jesus says take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart both sinners and christians are growing in their endeavors sinners will increase unto more ungodliness and evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but christians grow up into him in all things even christ proverbs 4 verse 18 supports progressive holiness saying but the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day before concluding this subject i've personally witnessed numerous examples of people who spoke in tongues but later rejected righteousness and turned to unrighteousness these broken lives prove speaking in tongues is only a temporary anointing of a gift and not the seal or permanent abiding presence of christ two examples from my college days bear retelling first a friend alcohol graham confessed in tears that he pretended to speak in tongues during a revival service at his church he said he didn't want to pretend but felt intense pressure to perform an unknown tongue when the preacher stuck the microphone under his mouth and spoke to the entire congregation saying did you receive the holy ghost gram feeling singled out in front of the entire church and afraid the group would ridicule him if he didn't say yes he loudly answered yes unexpectedly the preacher stuck the microphone back into his face and shouted then speak in tongues for everyone to hear graham didn't have the courage to tell the truth so he blabbered an unknown tongue into the mic to the delight of the preacher and congregation my prayer is that graham has found forgiveness and redemption through the spirit of truth a second college friend i'll call billy got saved during his freshman year through a revival sponsored by an initial evidence church being tall handsome and charismatic the initial evidence church quickly groomed him to the pulpit as a preacher visiting their church i watched he and his fiancee repeatedly speak in unknown tongues afterwards i shared my differing opinion about the initial evidence but we agreed to disagree billy eventually married his fiancee but less than three years into their marriage his wife committed adultery with another man divorcing him and leaving him alone her adulterous act proved she never had the baptism of the holy ghost despite frequently speaking in unknown tongues because first corinthians 6 verses 9 through 10 says neither adulterers shall inherit the kingdom of god the sea of the holy ghost seals out satan's power to persuade believers to commit adultery among other sins billy's ex-wife may have had a genuine gift to speak in tongues but it was wrong for her church to teach her to seek after the gift of tongues rather than the giver of the gifts jesus christ had she received jesus christ our lord would have washed away her desire to commit adultery and she would be married to billy to this day speaking in unknown tongues can be easily impersonated as a carnal fleshly evidence but the real evidence is faith that produces the life of christ in a believer's daily life hebrews 11 verse 1 is the only new testament scripture that uses the word evidence and it never mentions unknown tongues now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen invisible faith that produces progressively holy christ-like works is the evidence a christian has been truly born again more about the genuine evidence of the holy ghost baptism more can be said regarding the sixth reason why tongues isn't the evidence of the holy ghost baptism yes jesus taught the real evidence for receiving the baptism of the holy ghost as being guided by the holy spirit into all bible truth but he also provided concrete examples to help clarify the nature of the spirit's guidance a christian life guided into all truth includes love for other christians john 13 35 says by this shall all men know that they are my disciples if you have love one to another supernatural signs and wonders done by the holy ghost mark 16 verses 17 and 18 says and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils speak with new tongues lay hands on the sick and they shall recover remembering jesus's words john 14 verse 26 says the holy ghost shall bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you testifying about and glorifying jesus john 15 26 and 16 14 say the spirit of truth he shall testify of me and he shall glorify me being convicted of and overcoming sin john 16 verse 8 and 1st john 5 verse 4 say he will reprove the world of sin and for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world knowing future events john 16 13 says the spirit of truth will show you things to come listening to and believing the human messengers sent to preach during their lifetimes john 17 verses 20 and 21 says neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one the above seven examples demonstrate the nature of the spirit's guidance for new testament believers but what about old testament saints generally speaking it can be said the spirit guided old testament saints into all of god's revelation available to them during their lifetimes they had to be in the word all the way for their day while saints like noah joshua caleb and john the baptist couldn't receive the baptism of the holy spirit in their souls they could be led by it noah is one of eight believers who were led by the spirit into all the truth for his day which meant living all of god's righteous commands and physically separating themselves into noah's ark before the flood the evidence noah's group were genuine believers was their full obedience to god's word in their lifetimes joshua and caleb were the only two out of the multitude that left egypt to inherit the promised land numbers 14 verse 24 says caleb had another spirit and it was that spirit that led he and joshua to receive the messenger of their day moses and to obey all the truth of moses's message john the baptist was the messenger for his day and all true believers heard him confess their sins and repentance and were baptized in luke 7 verse 30 the pharisees and lawyers rejected god's counsel given to john and refused to be baptized consequently john called those who rejected his message a generation of vipers later in this chapter more will be taught on the holy ghost and the old testament saints unifying and differentiating terminology terminology about the baptism of the holy ghost needs both unified and differentiated from the other two works of grace chapter five covers the three works of grace justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost it's absolutely essential for believers to have this understanding to rightly divide the word of truth about the three stages in a christian's experience without this understanding churches will falsely assure new believers who have only recently been baptized in water they are already born again but in reality the new believers are only justified not sanctified and certainly not endued with power from on high sadly i've witnessed a bible teacher try to convince children as young as five years old that they already had jesus full power and could do greater works than him misinterpreting john 14 verse 12 yet most of these children did not show any fruits of repentance justification nor the signs of a sanctified transformed human spirit along with spreading confusion when teachers reject or are ignorant of the three works of grace the power of god is reduced to a stale emotionless moment of inviting jesus in your heart thankfully the bible offers us so much more hope than this figure 16 shows the three works of grace and unifies terminology for each stage the first stage justification is often referred to as being saved and ezekiel calls it the new heart justification corresponds to israel's exodus out of egypt wherein they were saved from bondage and cleansed through the red sea representing the new testament water baptism sanctification the second stage is called the new spirit by ezekiel because god is renewing the believer's mind or human spirit another word for sanctification is purification god cleans out the believer's mind in this stage in the purest sense it is a brainwashing or human spirit washing by the washing of water by the word formerly the christian was under the spirit of disobedience but sanctification teaches him to obey the word this stage corresponds to israel's wilderness journey in which they were tested or proved by god that he might know what was in thine heart whether israel would keep the commandments or no the baptism of the holy ghost is the third stage specifically reserved for new testament christians old testament saints could never attain to this stage because jesus blood had not yet atoned for mankind's sins and he was not yet glorified note this following list of terms and descriptors for the holy ghost baptism it far exceeds the previous two stages converted luke 22 32 endued with power from on high luke 24 49 born again or new birth john 3 verse 7 receiving eternal life john 10 28 first john 5 verses 11 through 13. love or charity romans 5 verse 5 first corinthians 13 verses 1 through 13 2 peter 1 verse 7 the holy spirit dwelling in you romans 8 verse 11 the spirit of adoption romans 8 verse 15 god the father dwelling and walking in you second corinthians 6 verses 16 and 18 seal or spiritual mark ephesians 1 verse 13 and ephesians 4 verse 30 christ in you colossians 1 verse 27 washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost titus 3 verse 5 washed robes made white in the blood of the lamb revelation 7 verse 14 most of these terms and phrases are not found in the old testament proving they were reserved by god for the new covenant when he would live in believers souls old testament believers cannot be labeled as born again baptized with the holy ghost sealed or regenerated only new testament believers are able to presently possess love eternal life the spirit of adoption and have god daily walking in them let it be clearly and emphatically stated that the following terms and phrases are speaking of the one and same experience of the baptism of the holy ghost new birth born again filled with the holy ghost sealed christ in you possessing eternal life converted adopted regenerated charity love and endued with power from on high for your benefit it bears revisiting that love and charity are identical terms and are synonymous for the baptism of the holy ghost the bible twice says god is love chapter one's section called god manifests himself in three ways introduces the truth that god the father and the holy ghost are the self-same person god is the holy spirit the person of love who comes to abide in your soul if this seems confusing go back and read chapter 5 section called character quality number 8 charity eight scriptures reveal this truth and help bring harmony to bible terminology about the holy ghost baptism the holy ghost baptism comes upon one of man's three parts as explored in chapter five every human has three parts to his or her being body human spirit and soul first thessalonians 5 23 provides this fact saying and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ figure 17 provides a visual of man's threefold division some may suggest man has fewer or more parts to his being but the bible limits it to only three parts if each man has three parts which part receives the seal of god or the baptism of the holy ghost that jesus promised the body spirit or soul recall jesus's words in john 7 verses 37 through 39 about the holy ghost not being given until after he was resurrected and glorified which part of man was awaiting a spiritual baptism the soul equipped with the knowledge that man has only three parts to his being you can use the process of elimination to rule out the two parts that do not experience the baptism of the holy ghost body and human spirit and find the part that does the soul the body does not receive the baptism of the holy ghost starting from the outside and working inward the body or flesh does not receive the baptism of the holy ghost paul says for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing the apostle knew his flesh had a totally depraved sin nature twice more saying sin dwelt inside his flesh galatians 5 verse 17 says for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would the flesh is completely defiant against the holy spirit and always lusting after sin at times the flesh equipped with its five senses can certainly feel the anointing of the holy ghost but it is always temporary at paul's conversion on the damascus road in acts 9 verses 1 through 6 christ's heavenly light shines so brightly that he fell to the ground and physically trembled under jesus's holiness but paul wasn't baptized with the holy ghost until a later date after he received his eyesight and was baptized in water the human spirit does not receive the baptism of the holy ghost moving inward beyond the flesh is the human spirit or mind thinking takes place here in the human spirit this second part of man is the part that many erroneously say receives the seal of god but these professors are mistaken because the human mind needs daily renewed and refreshed by the holy ghost romans 12 verse 1 says a christian conforms or fashions his mind through spiritual transformation then ii corinthians 4 16 teaches this renewing happens daily for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day contrary-wise the baptism of the holy ghost or seal of god upon man's soul is a permanent anointing that lasts unto the day of redemption when god seals a man's soul the work is one and done but the human mind must be daily made new and forced to serve the law of god by man's freemore agency romans 7 verse 25 reads i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin the five aspects to the human spirit scripture teaches there are five aspects to the human spirit conscience memory reason affection and imagination each aspect is temporarily anointed by the holy ghost when the believer brings his mind into obedience to god's word it's noteworthy that the human spirit or mind is like a battlefield between satan and the believer the enemy has free access to your mind and can inject evil thoughts without your permission ephesians 6 16 likens this unto satan shooting fiery darts into your mind you can't stop him from attacking but you can stop the fiery darts from hitting you with the mighty weapons of your christian warfare such as the shield of faith you can cast down all imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against god's word definitions and bible examples of these five aspects include conscience is the moral compass that guides man to recognizing right and wrong the scribes and pharisees were convicted by their own conscience and decided not to stone the woman caught in adultery after jesus directed them to examine their own guilt first before judging the woman memory is the ability to store and recall information peter's memory of jesus's promise to baptize with the holy ghost helped calm and convince jews that god had granted the gentiles repentance unto life in acts 11 verses 1-18 one benefit of the baptism of the holy ghost is that he will bring all things to remembrance when needed reason is the ability to explain the cause or justification of an action or event jesus perceived the scribe's evil reasoning in mark 2 verses 1-8 after messiah declared a paralyzed man forgiven the scribes silently reasoned jesus blasphemed because only god can forgive sins but christ proceeded to prove he was god by miraculously causing the man to walk godly reasoning is a powerful tool used to explain the scriptures as paul caused many thessalonians to believe the gospel by reasoning old testament scriptures about jesus's death and resurrection in acts 17 verses 1 through 4. affection is the emotional component of the human spirit paul says titus one of his fellow workers in the gospel had an abundant inward affection towards the believers in corinth all believers must set their affections on things above not on things on the earth imagination is the ability to mentally form new ideas concepts or images not present god flooded the earth in noah's day because every imagination of the thoughts of men's hearts were only evil continually christians use their imaginations to receive revelation from god as they consider the future joys of heaven which god has prepared for those he loves note how first corinthians 2 verses 9 and 10 says god has already revealed unimaginable deep things to his children but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god the supernatural human spirit man's human spirit is the supernatural part of him god designed to live for thousands or more years currently cain's human spirit is one of the millions that lived six thousand years ago in the days of man's origin the human spirit of cain and all the lost of his day are alive in hell awaiting judgment at the white throne first peter 3 verses 18 through 20 teaches that jesus preached unto the spirits in prison who disobeyed noah's message and lived over 2000 years before christ's earthly ministry three biblical examples teach human spirits keep both their strengths and weaknesses or character even after death first the prophet samuel remained a prophet four years after his death when his spirit was called up to earth by the witch of endor his righteous character remained intact for he foretold or prophesied the death of saul and his sons the day before it happened proving he still had the prophetic gift in his human spirit once a prophet always a prophet interestingly this story also shows how a diviner or necromancer was able to bring up samuel's spirit from abraham's bosom thankfully this is no longer possible because jesus's death and descent into hell allowed him to take the keys of death and hell before resurrecting in power and leading the saints to heaven more on the keys of death and hell in the following section found in luke 16 verses 19 through 31 jesus story of the rich man and beggar named lazarus is a second example of human spirits keeping their character after death following death the rich man finds himself tormented in the flames of hell while lazarus rests comfortably with abraham the rich man's human spirit remained prideful even after death as seen in his discourse with abraham having five brothers the rich man wanted abraham to send lazarus back from the dead to testify to his brothers so they would believe god's word and escape hell abraham refused saying his brothers only needed to hear moses and the prophets to be saved arrogantly the rich man tried to correct father abraham by saying the miracle of lazarus's raising from the dead would convince his brothers to be saved death never changed the rich man's selfish prideful character wisely abraham uttered if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead witnessing miracles does not bring salvation repentance from sin brings salvation a third example of human spirits keeping their character after death is the souls under the altar in revelation 6 verses 9 through 11. in this fifth seal souls in the heavenly dimension are crying out for revenge you learn in chapter 2 of this book that these souls are jews who have been martyred for their faith in the word of god or old testament from the days of jesus to the present this includes all the slain jews during the new testament from the 1st century up to the 6 million jews murdered during the holocaust to the persecuted jews of today note they did not have the testimony of jesus christ like the apostle john had in revelation 1 verse 2 and chapter 1 verse 9. yes these jews were faithful to moses law but their human spirits still seek vengeance for their blood the human spirits of holy ghost-filled christians seek not vengeance but ask forgiveness for their persecutors stephen the first recorded christian martyr by stoning kneel down at his death and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge the ultimate example of a human spirit offering forgiveness is jesus christ at his crucifixion messiah breathed father forgive them for they know not what they do the human spirit receives a temporary anointing the fact that the human spirit only receives a temporary anointing is a prominent revelation in this chapter every church that makes speaking in tongues the evidence of receiving the holy ghost fails this revelation because they only receive a temporary anointing on their human spirits rather than a permanent one the holy spirit anoints their minds causing them to operate the gift of tongues but the anointing eventually leaves afterwards worldliness usually creeps into their lives and genuine fruits of the holy spirit cannot be produced jesus promised believers power when baptized with the holy ghost but many tongue speakers only have power to speak in unknown tongues and lack the power to overcome the lusts of the eyes lust of the flesh and pride of life it does no good to utter unknown tongues at church but utter gossip cursing lies and praise for worldliness outside the church even born again christians battle the lusts and pride of life some mornings when you wake up your human spirit has backslid into total defiance to god's word and your flesh doesn't feel like seeking god through morning prayer and bible reading but as a spiritual king you must exercise dominion over both the flesh and human spirit bringing them into subjection to the holy ghost ruling over the flesh and spirit is walking in obedience to god's spirit living spiritually minded is your daily victory of life and peace romans 8 verses 4 through 7 says that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be the dividing line between the temporary and permanent anointing you can understand the difference between the holy ghost's temporary anointing on the human spirit versus the permanent anointing upon the soul by using three scriptures john 7 39 acts 1 verse 5 and acts 2 verse 4. these scriptures create a dividing line at the day of pentecost with full bible authority acts 2 verse 4 is the first time believers all but jesus received the permanent anointing of the holy ghost in their souls every other time the bible speaks of the anointing or feeling of the holy ghost previous to the day of pentecost it is referring to the temporary anointing of the human spirit not the soul this means every old testament scripture that refers to the holy ghost anointing men and women was a temporary anointing upon their human spirits and not their souls additionally it means anyone anointed by the holy ghost in the four gospels excluding jesus christ at his water baptism only received a temporary anointing examining john 7 39 the baptism of the holy ghost in the soul could only be given after jesus was glorified but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified when was jesus glorified christ was glorified or received a new glorified body at the moment of his resurrection john 12 verses 23 and 24 records jesus saying his death meant the hour of his glorification was near saying the hours come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit two more scriptures john 2 verse 22 and john 12 16 place jesus glorification after his resurrection because christ's disciples only gain understanding of his prophecies after jesus rose from the dead john 12 16 reads these things understood not his disciples at the first but when jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto him shortly after the day of pentecost peter performed a miracle in christ's name and said god had already glorified his son jesus the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his son jesus acts 1 verse 5 records jesus's red letter words of promise to baptize his believers with the holy ghost ten days before it happened for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence this was the soul baptism both christ and john the baptist foretold luke 3 verse 16 records john differentiating his water baptism from the soul baptism that christ would unleash at pentecost john answered saying unto them all i indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than i cometh the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire old testament examples of the temporary anointing now that you've learned the human spirit the second part of your being is only anointed temporarily by the holy ghost you can understand old testament bible examples referring to believers being filled with the holy ghost you know these temporary fillings only anointed their minds not their souls because jesus was not yet glorified pharaoh recognized god's spirit in joseph in genesis 41 verse 38 saying can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the spirit of god is in exodus 28 verse 3 wise-hearted jews were filled with the spirit of wisdom in order to make aaron's priestly garments bezalil was filled with the spirit of god in all manner of workmanship to help build the tabernacle of moses but it was his human spirit that was filled with god's spirit not yet his soul because hebrews 10 verse 4 says it was impossible for the blood of bulls and goats which sacrifices he was living under to take away his sins numbers 14 verse 24 says caleb had another spirit with him which caused him to follow god fully in the days of joshua in numbers 27 verse 18 joshua had god's spirit for the lord told moses take thee joshua the son of nun a man in whom is the spirit and lay thine hand upon him micah knew his mind was filled with god's spirit saying but truly i am full of power by the spirit of the lord and of judgment and of might to declare unto jacob his transgression and to israel his sin all prophets had god's spirit temporarily anointing them numbers 11 verses 25-29 shows how god put a portion of his spirit that was already upon moses on seventy elders causing them to prophesy without ceasing closely examining three old testament individuals helps further prove the spirit's anointing was temporary samson saul and david sampson is known both for his supernatural strength via the holy ghost but also for his immorality judges 13 25 and judges 14 verse 6 record the spirit mightily moving upon him but later his disobedience and sensuality caused the lord to depart from him surely god's spirit was anointing samson to fulfill his life's purpose of delivering israel from the philistines but it wasn't the lord's anointing causing him to commit fornication with a prostitute the new testament believer is empowered by the baptism of the holy ghost in his soul to abstain from fornication since fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of god but this soul anointing wasn't available in samson's lifetime at the beginning of his reign saul was anointed king of israel and the spirit of god came upon him in 1st samuel 10 verses 1-10 through his rebellion against god an evil spirit came upon saul but departed as david played his harp after david slew goliath in 1st samuel 18 verses 6 through 12 the evil spirit returned to saul because he was jealous when dancing israeli women proclaimed david the better warrior the evil spirit would come and go saul even unsuccessfully attempted to murder david twice in 1st samuel 19 verses 8 through 18. next saul and his servants went to rhema to dispose of david but instead all prophesied as the spirit of god came upon them saul spent many of his remaining years on earth harboring a murderous spirit as he hunted down david god grew weary of saul's disobedience ultimately taking away both his mercy from saul and the kingdom of israel saul experienced only the temporary anointing of god's spirit upon his human spirit new testament believers with the permanent seal of god's spirit in their souls will not harbor murderous spirits because jesus says behold the kingdom of god is within their souls murderers will not inherit the kingdom of god first john 3 verse 15 teaches no murder has eternal life every born-again christian though already possesses eternal life david's life may serve as the most profound example of the holy spirit's temporary anointing upon the human spirit because his victories and failures were so great even before his epic victory against the giant goliath god's anointing came upon david as samuel poured a horn of natural oil on his head and pronounced him the next king along with being the universal symbol for a giant killer david is also well known for having a heart that chased after god's heart david loved god's anointing and you read of his love for god and his law in scores of worship songs in the book of psalm many of his psalms prophesied of jesus christ including psalm 16 22 and 110. indeed over one thousand years before jesus crucifixion the holy spirit took david so deep into revelation that he foretold messiah's suffering and some of his very words from the cross by writing my god my god why is thou forsaken me all my bones they look and stare upon me they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture david humbly and accurately said in second samuel 32 verse 2 the spirit of the lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue 2 peter 1 21 rightly describes david's experiences saying holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost on the other side of the spectrum david experienced the pain agony and shame of rejecting the anointing in his human spirit when he harbored and acted upon lustful thoughts about another man's wife bathsheba first kings 15 verse 5 says this situation was david's one time he purposely turned aside from god's command because david did that which was right in the eyes of the lord and turn not aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life save only in the matter of uriah the hittite without the permanent seal of the holy ghost in his soul david radically turned aside from the anointing of god's spirit and committed horrendous evils told in second samuel chapters 11 and 12 david's first mistake was neglecting his kingly war duties at the time of his downfall he was in jerusalem but should have been out with israel's army battling the ammonites you must learn to never neglect your responsibilities as all old testament scripture is written for your benefit next david stood on his rooftop at night and saw bathsheba bathing consumed by her beauty he inquired of her identity and then sent messengers to bring her to him consider the time that passed between the moment david first saw bathsheba and the time he lay with her in which he could have repented of his lust and chose obedience to god's commands he had at least two ways out first with god's anointing he could have cast out this lustful temptation from his mind second the king who had at least eight wives and ten concubines could have easily satisfied his sensual passions with one of his legal wives but instead took another man's only wife david willingly ignored the conviction of the holy spirit and scripture says he despised the commandment of the lord that forbid adultery david chose to commit adultery with bathsheba and after he received word from her that she was pregnant he repeatedly tried to cover up his sin this moved david to place bathsheba's husband loyal soldier uriah in the middle of a violent battle that led to his death the prophet nathan put the blame of murder upon david saying thou has killed uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of ammon in all of this scripture gives no clues about bathsheba's motives but david admits his blame saying i have sinned against the lord like all children of god david suffered grave consequences for his evil actions foretold by the prophet nathan as the sword never departed from his house he and bathsheba's first child died shortly after birth david's daughter tamar was raped by her half-brother amnon who was then murdered by absalon david's son soon after that epsilon stole the hearts of the people and the kingdom from david forcing his father into exile epsilon then slept with his father's concubines publicly as divine retribution for his secret adultery with bathsheba adonijah another son of david was executed after david's death as a traitor friend god is not mocked whatsoever a man sows that shall he reap psalm 51 is universally acknowledged as a divine song of repentance after david committed adultery with bathsheba in verses 10 through 12 david requests god recreating a clean heart within him and a renewal of the right spirit he pleads for god not to cast him away from his holy presence saying take not thy holy spirit from me this statement shows david knew god's anointing upon him was temporary the king then asked for a restoration of joy and god's upholding power for his human spirit herein lays the truth that under the old testament david could kill a giant goliath outside his body but not the giant of lust within his body because he lacked the inward power of the baptism of the holy ghost new testament teaching states adulterers cannot inherit the kingdom of god this is because power is now available to overcome adultery and every other sin in short a new testament believer who is truly baptized with the holy ghost will not commit adultery he may commit adultery before being born again but not after spirit-filled christians are sealed or marked as god's eternal property and are guarded by the power of god from committing adultery and other grave sins first peter 1 verse 5 says we are kept or guarded by the power of god through faith preachers and lay members alike may erroneously use david's failures to justify their own lusts claiming they too can be men or women after god's heart despite adulteries fornications and multiple marriages but the revelation of the holy ghost baptism unveils their folly by showing a higher holiness standard for new testament saints based upon access to greater power wolves in sheep's clothing live by the motto if god forgave david for his sexual sin then god will forgive me sadly these wolves plan out their sins like adulteries despite romans 13 verse 14 admonishing us to put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof false preachers devise plan and execute their sexual escapades but godly preachers depart from all iniquity second timothy 2 verse 19 reads nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity while david was guilty of his failures his life proves old testament believers lack the permanent indwelling of god's presence because god was hiding it until pentecost if david had been born again the holy ghost seal inside of him would have caused him to overcome adultery with bathsheba and refrain from uriah's murder rather than despising god's commands god's soul seal offers christians power to cause them to obey god according to ezekiel 36 verse 27 new testament examples of the temporary anointing john the baptist and his parents zacharias and elizabeth are three new testament examples of the temporary anointing of god's spirit technically the new testament did not begin until after jesus death and resurrection hebrews 9 verses 16 and 17 validates this saying for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth these three individuals are classified as new testament examples because their temporary anointing is recorded in luke's gospel which is considered part of the traditional new testament canon luke chapter 1 records john and his parents being filled with the holy ghost luke 1 verse 15 says for he john shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he should be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb speaking of elizabeth luke 1 verse 41 says and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost luke 1 verse 67 mentioned zechariah saying and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost and prophesied weigh these three experiences with jesus's words in john 7 39 but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified based upon the messiah's declaration john and his parents were temporarily filled with the holy ghost in their human spirits and not their souls additional proof is found in john's doubt of christ as messiah matthew 11 verses 2 and 3 reads now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another the pressure stress and agony of prison life had caused john to doubt his earlier experience of seeing the holy ghost descend and remain upon christ at his baptism that he performed john could doubt his supernatural experience because his soul was not sealed indeed john lacked the greater power in his soul to be an unwavering witness that only the holy ghost baptism could provide acts 1 verse 8 identifies this power saying but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in judea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth three other new testament passages teach of the temporary anointing of god's spirit upon the human spirit matthew 7 verses 21-23 shows that many persons who had god's anointing temporarily will be lost and sent to hell because they chose to work iniquity rather than righteousness see chapter 8's parables called the wheat and the tares and the net cast into the sea for a full study on this passage hebrews 6 verses 4 through 8 describes wicked people who temporarily enjoy the blessings of the holy spirit the hebrews author clearly states these reprobates can be enlightened of the spirit taste of heavenly gifts partake of the holy ghost but still fall away from living a true christian life lastly hebrews 10 verses 26 through 29 speaks of those who sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth god's judgment and fiery indignation is against those who serve god with his anointing long enough to be sanctified but then trodden underfoot the son of god and live despite the spirit of grace the soul receives the permanent anointing of the holy ghost using the process of elimination among the three parts of man's being body human spirit and soul the soul is the only realm of man left that can logically receive the baptism of the holy ghost the body and human spirit have already been ruled out as god's permanent abode but does scripture give enough support for the soul as god's permanent dwelling place within man the answer is a resounding yes contrast david's old testament description of god's temporary anointing with new testament descriptions of the permanent anointing psalm 51 verse 11 says take not thy holy spirit from me implying david knew the feeling of god's anointing leaving him but paul's words in ephesians 4 30 say the seal of the holy ghost cannot be taken away and last unto the day of redemption or until you die or your body is changed at the pre-tribulation rapture now insert jesus's promises for his spirit to indwell and never leave believers john 14 16 records messiah saying and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever jesus promised believers would know he was living in them and that he had made his abode with them in john 14 20 and verse 23 christ's parting words to his disciples in matthew 28 20 were lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world he would be with them by dwelling inside their souls twice in john 17 jesus says he'll achieve oneness with his disciples by his spirit living inside them john 17 verse 23 says i in them and thou and me that they may be made perfect in one john 17 26 reads and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou hast love me may be in them and i in them god permanently dwelling in believers souls is a major part of god's better covenant as he declares i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people new testament saints permanently born again in their souls have the benefit of greater obedience constancy and stability compared to old testament saints because the human will is fully surrendered to god's will remember david's fall into the shameful public adultery with bathsheba he lacked the power and stability of the baptism of the holy ghost in his hour of temptation likewise before pentecost peter fell in a shameful public denial of christ while speaking with a lowly maid the difference for peter was pentecost which was unavailable to david before the upper room peter even cowardly ran for his life at the threat of arrest but afterwards he was boldly crucified upside down as a martyr for christ in 64 a.d once filled with the holy ghost in his soul peter could not deny his lord and savior what is the soul the soul is defined as the nature will or desire of the human spirit the soul is closely connected to the human spirit soul thirsts for god the living god this was by god's perfect design because he wants fellowship with his creation just as the body has an innate natural thirst for water so the soul has an innate spiritual thirst for god's acceptance and fellowship if the body is denied water it dies the soul dies or is eternally separated from god if it denies itself fellowship with god's spirit isaiah 26 verses 7 through 9 beautifully describes the soul's thirst or desire for god the way of the just is uprightness thou most upright dust weight the path of the just yea in the way of thy judgments o lord have we waited for thee the desire of our soul is to thy name and to the remembrance of thee with my soul have i desired thee in the night yea with my spirit within me will i seek thee early for when thy judgments are on the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness the lord built this holy thirst into each person's soul so all are without excuse on the day of judgment romans 1 verses 18 through 21 teaches god manifests himself to all men through the amazing design of their human bodies and the indescribable majesty of the heavens earth and universe these three elements holy thirst design of the human body and majestic universe form an undeniable group of witnesses to god's unfathomable love for his creation paul speaks truth when he says but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us no man will be able to say god did not love him because christ has provided witnesses both within holy thirst design of the human body and without man creation the holy thirst in every soul produces a longing to worship every person in every culture longs to worship a higher being no matter how advanced or primitive wealthy or poor urban or rural mankind longs to worship it and does worship someone or something most often men try to satisfy this thirst with false religion because it pleases their selfish fleshly and sinful desires but god searches the earth until he identifies small groups of honest worshipers who will not stop searching until they find his true spiritual water that alone quenches the spiritual thirst inside them peter preached this truth in acts 10 verses 34 and 35 saying of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him jesus says the father is seeking true worshipers zechariah chapter 4 verse 10 agrees saying god's eyes run to and fro through the whole earth second chronicles chapter 16 verse 9 also describes god's eyes searching the whole earth in order to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him rest assured the loving heavenly father will search out and find every soul longing for fellowship with him free moral agency or the power of autonomous choice originates within man's soul as a gift from god life on earth is a gift but salvation unto eternal life is an even greater gift and is yours to gain or lose to accept salvation is to keep your soul to reject it is to lose your soul as jesus teaches in mark 8 36 for what shall a prophet a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul the lord does not force any soul to follow him or repent from his sins but graciously offers mercy and warnings to all persons the soul nature ultimately directs a person's destiny to heaven or hell your soul directs your way whether it's the correct or erroneous way james 5 verse 20 reads let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the heir of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins god mercifully gives each person the way or desire of their heart psalm 37 verse 4 says god gives the righteous the desires of their hearts romans 1 verse 28 implies he gives sinners their evil desire saying and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient those who want to be saved will be and those who desire a life and eternity without god will receive the same through the soul's free moral agency every person either chooses faith or unbelief if faith is chosen god directs the believer to heaven if faith is rejected unbelief is the default state of the unbeliever and satan directs him to hell unbelief is the absence or rejection of faith in god continual sin leads to complete unbelief to reject faith is the ultimate final sin because it determines a person's eternal destiny ezekiel 18 4 says the soul that sinneth it shall die sinning means missing the mark or wandering from the way in hebrew therefore it is a man's soul via free moral agency that chooses every action the soul either does good faith or evil unbelief romans 2 verses 9 and 10 confirm this saying tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also of the gentile but glory honor and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentile every soul worships someone or something the souls of faith rejecters choose to disbelieve god but their soul still worships satan according to their own wills appropriately paul calls all false worship will worship in colossians 2 verse 23 after condemning the worship of angels and legalistic teachings in verses 16 through 22 will worship or worshiping in self-will is the default mode of soul worship for all who reject god's requirements for true worship jesus teaches true worshipers must not should worship in spirit and in truth in john 4 verse 24 god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth cain is the first human will worship example in genesis 4 verses 1 through 7. instead of being happy that god had accepted his brother abel's offering and following his example to please god cain became very wroth against god the merciful god offered cain another chance at true worship through obedience and the opportunity to be the spiritual head of his brother but he flatly refused god's counsel cain then murdered abel and lied about it to god worshiping like cain and self-will according to your own requirements is a soul damning decision this is why cain is called the son of satan in 1st john 3 verses 11 and 12. for this is the message that ye have heard from the beginning that we should love one another not his cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous cain rejected the simple way to salvation john 14 verse 6 says jesus is god's one way to salvation i am the way the truth and the life and isaiah 35 8 says this way is so simple a fool will not err therein and a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not air therein imagery and foreshadowing of the soul receiving the baptism of the holy ghost scripture uses at least eight images with corresponding old testament foreshadowings to help us understand how the soul or human nature is born again all eight representations are fulfilled simultaneously at the moment a christian is born again the soul needs filled with god's nature more than 10 times the new testament mentions believers being filled with the holy ghost which suggests man's soul or will begins empty of the divine nature without the full anointing of god's spirit the human soul only has a finite human nature which ultimately leads itself to destruction ephesians 2 verse 3 says we were by nature the children of wrath before our conversions to christianity but beginning in acts 2 verse 4 believers were filled with the divine nature or divine will of god and were appropriately described as having one soul the fourth verse of 2nd peter chapter 1 states this truth plainly saying christians are now partakers of the divine nature paul likens believers unto vessels that must be filled with the spirit having previously been sanctified ready for the master's use similarly jesus likens believers unto houses that must be cleaned out of devils in matthew 12 verses 29 and verses 43 through 45. the obvious implication is that our houses our bodies must be filled with the holy ghost elisha's miracle of filling the widow woman's borrowed pots with oil in 2nd kings 4 verses 1 through 7 foreshadows the filling of the holy ghost in the new testament god will fill every empty vessel or soul who comes to him to be filled and he'll only stop when no more gentiles seek his spirit the soul needs sealed or marked as god's eternal property seven new testament scriptures call the baptism of the holy ghost a seal and in the greek it means both a mark and a sealing up both definitions accurately depict what happens at the new birth god's abiding spirit becomes a permanent property mark or stamp on the believer's soul keeping it from being marked or claimed by satan god puts his spiritual mark upon his children as a token they've received his new testament covenant it's also a seal to close up the soul like an envelope until it reaches its heavenly home after death god's will is sealed in to the soul while satan's will is sealed out beginning with cain sinners have been taking satan's mark on their souls romans 1 verses 18-32 and 2 thessalonians 2 verses 9-14 detail how satan's mark comes as the point of no return when sinners reject god's truth for the last time in return god gives them over to their reprobate minds letting them believe lies unto their own destruction because they love not the truth ephesians 4 30 says god seals his divine nature into the christian unto the day of redemption this eternal seal lasts longer than the time from one annual church revival event to the next it lasts forever without end because god seal is his holy spirit which is the one and only eternal spirit as you'll soon see in first john 3 verse 9 unbelief is sealed out of the soul and faith is sealed in ezekiel chapter 9 verses 1 through 7 foreshadows the marking of the holy spirit comparing it to a scribe marking faithful believers who sighed and cried against abominations kings sealed off their gardens and fountains in bible times solomon likens his wife to a sealed garden and fountain in song of solomon 4 verse 12. a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed this foreshadows jesus sealing off his spouse the bride the new testament church with the sole seal of the holy ghost the soul needs clothed in divine power in luke 24 49 jesus says the holy ghost baptism is a garment of power for the spirit is power luke 4 verse 14 says and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee man sinful soul is naked or lacking divine power in colossians 3 verses 7 through 10 paul calls this sinful powerless soul the old man and says his works are anger wrath malice blasphemy among other sins the old man must be put off or taken off like a garment and the new man must be put on the holy ghost baptism is power to do god's will the apostle admonishes believers to put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof additionally sinful souls are spiritually naked after death meaning they lack a celestial eternal body also called a theophany paul teaches this in second corinthians 5 verses 1-5 saying believers groan to be clothed with their celestial or heavenly bodies souls of sinners are found naked void of the clothing of the spirit's power elisha receiving elijah's mantle or anointing in second kings chapter 2 verse 14 foreshadows the soul clothing of the baptism of the holy ghost the soul needs its unbelief removed or circumcised in romans 2 verses 28 28-29 paul claims the holy ghost-filled christian is a spiritual jew having the circumcision of the heart in the spirit he again teaches this truth in philippians 3 verse 3 and colossians 2 verse 11 saying we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and have the circumcision of christ indeed it is christ who uses his sword the word to permanently cut off the evil desires of the human will severing it from the soul never to return again abraham's circumcision in genesis 17 verses 1 through 14 was a sign of the covenant between he and god foreshadowing the soul circumcision of the new testament christian the soul needs born or brought forth from above a birth is a bringing forth a start of new life your first birth from your mother's womb is your natural birth but christ promised and required heavenly birth for your soul saying ye must be born again in john 3 verse 7 in the greek again means from above your body birth on earth was your first birth through your father's corruptable seed but your soul's birth from heaven is another birth experience through your heavenly father's seed first peter 1 verse 23 plainly states being born again not a corruptable seed but of incorruptable by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever your body will die and perish but your soul will live eternally because it has god's own life or seed first john 3 verse 9 boldly proclaims your soul cannot sin because its seed life is from god whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god the apostle paul taught his flesh and mind sinned but not himself his soul romans 7 17 states now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me the born-again soul is a new spiritual creature like a natural baby is a new creature it's a start of a new life eternal life 2 corinthians 5 verse 17 says therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new indeed god's foreknowledge knew you desire the new birth so he foreordained it in his will like first time parents plan for and eagerly anticipate their first child's arrival your heavenly father planned your spiritual birth in his will at the perfect time in season john 1 verses 12 and 13 say sons of god are born again not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god seth son of adam and eve foreshadows the new testament new birth eve said seth was another seed or second seed from god to replace abel whom cain slew eve needed a new creature a new son christians need another seed a second seed an incorruptible seed from above in order to be a new creature seth was actually the second seed of adam as cain was the seed of the serpent according to genesis 3 verse 15 and 1st john 3 verse 12 chapter 10 details the serpent seed and cain's true father the soul needs quickened or made alive through god's eternal life your human soul has a supernatural life but doesn't have eternal life until it's born again your soul receives a faith seed for salvation through preaching but the seed needs quickened or made alive according to the greek in order for a natural seed to grow it needs three conditions met light water and fertile soil the seed cannot be quickened until all three conditions are present likewise the spiritual seed in your soul is quickened when the three following conditions are met the word seed in a believer's soul needs spiritual light soil and water to be quickened and these conditions were met on the day of pentecost spiritual light is the knowledge of jesus's work on the cross that paul says shine in our hearts second corinthians 4 verse 6 reads for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shine in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ this spiritual light shine brightly upon dark hearts as peter preached to the 17 nationalities in acts 2 verses 14-36 the second condition is fertile soil which jesus says is an honest and good heart in luke 8 15. this condition was met at pentecost when the new believer's hearts were pricked in acts 2 verse 37 leading to their repentance and water baptism in the name of jesus christ spiritual water is a third and final condition which represents the holy spirit that fell on the day of pentecost peter said this divine water was poured out upon he and the other 119 believers in the upper room in acts 2 verse 17. after peter's pentecost sermon the spiritual water fell upon the new believers shortly after their water baptisms because scripture says three thousand souls were added to the church that very day aaron's dead rod that butted overnight in the holiest of holies in numbers 17 verse 8 foreshadows the baptism of the holy ghost the lifeless rod received resurrection power in the third realm of moses's tabernacle typing the third work of grace the outer core and holy place type justification and sanctification respectively the soul needs immersed or baptized in god's nature the son of god himself depicted the born-again experience as a spiritual baptism for the soul in acts 1 verse 5 but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence the human soul is fully immersed in god's nature or will when it's born again as ezekiel says this divine nature will cause you to keep god's commands just like water causes a seed to carry out its genetic code reverting to the seed imagery water is one of the three elements a seed needs to germinate but the right amount of water is essential too much water and the seed dies waterlogged lacking oxygen too little water and the seed coat remains hard and doesn't germinate but when evenly moist soil surrounds the seed this baptism causes life to spring forth neyman's bodily cleansing after his seventh dip or baptism in the river jordan in second kings 5 14 foreshadows our spiritual cleansing through the holy ghost baptism the soul needs rest from doing its own will the lord jesus christ specifically preached his promise to give rest for our souls in matthew 11 verses 28 and 29 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls without christ's rest all souls are restless working to feel justified with god the human will labors in vain to try to do good deeds but ultimately fails all religions outside of christianity including all non-religious self-help programs are self-serving self-motivated and selfish they all do man's will rather than gods judaism is called the deeds of the law in romans 3 verse 20 because all human deeds and efforts of sinful fallible flesh cannot be justified in god's sight it's true the law is holy just and spiritual but we are carnal sold under sin what the human will needs is a rest from its carnal will and a full submission and obedience to the will of god this privilege is provided by the baptism of the holy ghost another way to express being sold under sin is slavery or the spirit of bondage the soul is under slavery labor and bondage until it's set free by the holy ghost baptism appropriately called the spirit of adoption in romans 8 15. you're officially adopted into god's family as his child through the new birth paul says in galatians 5 verse 4 we receive the adoption of sons you can rest knowing you're a child of god with a family kinship to him and not a slave romans 8 verse 23 tells you the adoption process is completed when you receive your new glorified body and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it the redemption of our body hebrews 4 verses 1 through 12 beautifully explains the new testament rest for the soul the author gives two examples of resting god resting from his creative work on the seventh day and most of israel failing to enter into their rest in the promised land before urging christians to labor to enter into the new rest for the people of god this rest must be both the same rest christ promised in matthew 11 29 and a new rest different from the sabbath day moses instituted in exodus chapter 20. the new testament rest is ceasing from your own works and doing god's works hebrews 4 verse 10 validates this for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his in colossians 1 verse 29 paul states his labors are god's spirit laboring through him whereunto i also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily you must know the new testament sabbath is not resting every saturday as seventh-day adventists teach while you should rest your body while worshiping with other believers every sunday like acts 20 verse 7 and hebrews 10 25 show the baptism of the holy ghost is the soul rest jesus promised not a body rest old testament saints already had the body rest under the fourth commandment colossians 2 verses 16 and 17 state saturday sabbath days were a shadow of things to come isaiah boldly prophesied the shadow or saturday sabbath would vanish on the day of pentecost by saying this is the rest in isaiah 28 verses 11 and 12. the prophet foretold the real soul rest would be stammering lips spoken to god's people paul says isaiah's prophecy was fulfilled on the day of pentecost in first corinthians 14 verse 21 in the born-again experience a christian rests or walks according to the spirit and does not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the remainder of his christian walk the believer rests or ceases from sinful habits and establishes holy habits now that's a true rest the new testament soul rest gives believers the potential but it remains impossible due to our sin nature to always obey god's word if we only wait and listen for god's spirit to speak to us in every situation this is true because our souls cannot sin or disbelieve once baptized with the holy ghost reference first john 3 verse 9 whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god but of course we don't wait and pray enough on a daily basis we often choose to make decisions based upon the feelings of the flesh or human spirit rather than the soul the greatest lessons in life are learning to listen to and rest upon the revelations from god's spirit in our souls listen to god first then act wait upon his leading calm yourself to hear the still small voice in your soul you'll never regret resting from your works and doing god's truly the rest jesus offers you today is a glorious soul rest one in which isaiah promised 800 years before emmanuel came isaiah 11 verse 10 reads and in that day there shall be a root of jesse which shall stand for an end sign of the people to it shall the gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious by the holy ghost baptism we partake in the divine glorious rest of god ruth's rest while waiting for boaz to finish the kinsmen redeemer work foreshadows the baptism of the holy ghost her life fits the three works of grace framework she was first justified or saved after deciding to believe and follow naomi's god jehovah secondly her sanctification came as she served and labored in boaz's field gleaning every ear of corn to ensure naomi's and her own survival ruth 3 verse 18 records naomi's wisdom for ruth to rest in boaz's redemption work then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day christians do the same resting from their own works and trusting in the finished work of jesus's cross and resurrection to conclude this imagery section scripture offers numerous symbols for the holy ghost including but not limited to oil dove water rain fire wind standard clothes quicken seed refillings of the holy ghost happen in the human spirit you may hear preachers or believers say they were refilled with the holy ghost based upon scripture a refilling of the holy ghost can only happen in the human spirit and not the soul 2 corinthians 4 verse 16 and ephesians 4 verse 23 teach your human spirit can have a fresh refilling or renewing these scriptures say you're renewed daily in the spirit of your mind no scripture teaches souls are refilled or reborn after the initial filling or birth ephesians 4 30 says the seal of god lasts until your day of redemption not for a year or until the next church revival meeting god seal marks and protects you until you die and cross over into the heavenly dimension or until your physical body gets swallowed up in a glorified body at the pre-tribulation rapture some may read the context of acts 4 31 and think souls can be refilled with the holy ghost but careful examination and scriptural comparison leads us to believe differently peter and john had returned to their company or fellow christians after being threatened to stop speaking in jesus name after loud group prayer the holy ghost shook the building and they were all filled with the holy ghost some in the company may have received the holy ghost baptism for the first time but not all and certainly not peter and john acts 1 13 says peter and john were among the group that was already filled with the holy ghost when the spirit fell in acts 2 verse 4. this means peter and john got a spirit refilling in their human spirits to refresh their minds but not another soul sealing because their soul baptism in acts 2 verse 4 lasted unto the day of redemption the soul of the old testament believer since only new testament believers can have their souls filled sealed clothed circumcised born quickened baptized and at rest what did old testament saints have in their souls the answer is faith hebrews 11 verse 1 describes faith as a spiritual substance or a small portion of god's spirit abraham the father of us all can be used as an example to illustrate an old testament believers soul change from unbelief to faith yet according to jesus the holy ghost could not be given in full measure to abraham like all persons abraham was born a sinner or unbeliever with an inherent sin nature david wrote behold i was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me romans 3 verse 23 reads for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god abraham was raised in ur of the chaldeas a southern babylonian city even as a sinner abraham's soul was thirsting for god but barren of faith therefore his soul was in the state of unbelief yet thirsting for truth one wonderful day in mesopotamia the god of glory appeared to abraham although he was still known as abram until genesis 17 verse 5 and in his freemore agency received god's word becoming a believer abraham freely chose to believe god and now had faith in god which set his way or course to acceptance with god in heaven indeed abraham had been converted from the heir of his way according to james 5 20. hebrews 11 verses 8 through 10 details how by faith his faith infused soul directed his earthly course by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god lot abraham's nephew undoubtedly experienced this same salvation in his soul 2 peter 2 verses 7 through 9 says lot was a righteous man with a righteous soul faith in his soul directed his earthly course to resist and rightfully accuse the sodomites of their wickedness god then mercifully delivered him from the judgment of sodom and gomorrah figuratively the seed of god's word had fallen upon abraham's soul but not yet quickened the seed contained powerful potential to produce great fruits of the spirit but could not due to the spiritual conditions of abraham's lifetime a natural seed lays dormant until three conditions are met sufficient water light and fertile soil the spiritual seed of god's word also needs three conditions met in abraham's lifetime two of the three spiritual conditions needed to quicken the seed in his soul were unavailable the water of the spirit was available to believers as you've already read of numerous old testament saints being powerfully anointed of the holy spirit in their human spirits god graciously anointed believers minds and bodies who longed for his presence but spiritual light and fertile soil were unavailable spiritual light is the knowledge of jesus christ and forgiveness of sins through his cross jesus's cross and pardoning blood were nearly 2 000 years in the future ahead of abraham and thus unavailable spiritually fertile soil was unavailable too because of the weakness of animal sacrifices jesus says a fertile heart is an honest and good heart in luke 8 15. according to hebrews 9 verses 9 through 14 abraham's flesh could be purified after animal sacrifice but his human spirit or heart didn't completely feel good specifically abraham's conscience could not be fully purged from dead works to serve the living god imagine abraham sacrificing and worshiping in sincerity trusting he was forgiven and righteous in god's sight by meeting his requirements but leaving his altar with an unclean guilty conscience remembering his past sins after each of abraham's animal sacrifices hebrews 10 verses 3 and 4 says there was a remembrance again of sins every year because it was not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins animal blood purged the flesh but not the human spirit with an unclean human spirit god could not baptize abraham's human spirit with his spirit let alone his soul it's clear the conditions for the soul baptism weren't right the remembrance of sins is observable in the lives of old testament saints especially in job and david jobe 9 verse 2 and verse 33 show job's desire to feel just with god through a mediator that would bring peace between he and god that mediator would later come as jesus christ the one mediator between god and men job's many previous animal sacrifices were accepted by god but it wasn't possible for the blood of those animals to make job feel truly justified job knew he lacked a person his mediator jesus christ david knew he lacked the same echoing similar thoughts in psalm 130 verse 3 and psalm 143 verse 2. israel's king asked if thou lord shouldest mark iniquities o lord who shall stand david said in thy sight shall no man living be justified paul said the law couldn't justify believers like job and david when he said therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight job and david's words explain their lack of rest or lack of the holy ghost baptism but to their credit god was hiding it from every old testament age and generation in accordance with the forthcoming keys of death and hell section abraham and the old testament saints lived a life subject to bondage and the fear of death due to the weakness of animal sacrifices but this fit into the plan of god to magnify the power of jesus's blood the law was a teacher a schoolmaster to bring us unto christ weak animal sacrifices emphasize the need for the powerful sinless holy sacrifice of christ before the cross satan stood before god like a cruel lawyer accusing all believers of sins based upon god's own law lucifer is rightly named the accuser of our brethren colossians 2 verse 14 makes it seem satan had compiled a written record of the sins of the old testament saints as handwriting of ordinances that was against them thankfully jesus death blotted out the handwriting taking it out of the way nailing it to his cross indeed all the evidence of our sins was nailed to his cross and taken out of the way isaiah 53 verse 6 rightly declares the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all our ransom or sin debt was paid in full by the substitutionary sacrifice of jesus christ three scriptures say jesus gave his life as a ransom payment for all sinners returning to abraham and lot both men had righteous souls by obeying god's animal sacrifice requirements but their degree of dedication to god's word and separation from sin differed abraham lived in total surrender to god while lot pitched his tent toward sodom before eventually becoming a resident in the sin saturated city lot's testimony only produced the saving of two souls out of sodom his virgin daughters before its destruction previous to losing his wife to the pillar of salt condemnation and his other daughters and son-in-laws in the fire and brimstone la experienced daily vexation from everything he saw and heard in sodom abraham's life was peaceful not of torment as lotz was genesis 18 verse 19 and genesis 26 verse 5 portray the father of faith patriarch as an obedient diligent teacher and keeper of god's commands among his family and household servants recalling the stature of a perfect man from chapter 5 abraham and lot both advanced in character adding traits to their faith with souls anointed with faith both men yielded their human spirits to god's service it seems abraham obtained the seventh trait brotherly kindness because he rescued lot from the kings gave lot the first choice on land to inhabit and then dramatically interceded with god for lot and the believer's souls in sodom abraham's soul though couldn't be born again due to the weakness of the law and animal blood it's likely lot only reached the fourth trait temperance because he was not content living away from sodom's riches impatient purposely lived amongst the ungodly sodomites ungodly and took the first choice of land to inhabit rather than allowing his elder uncle the first choice lacked brotherly kindness like jesus's disciples old testament saints could gain and lose the divine character qualities in their human spirits soul redemption through christ's blood peter writes of both the soul's redemption through christ's blood and its purification by the spirit in his first epistle he declares christians were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot in the greek redeemed means to release on receipt of ransom and liberate by payment of ransom to cause to be released to oneself by payment of a ransom to deliver new testament saints experienced liberated souls meaning the souls of the old testament saints were not yet released or delivered from satan's authority hence all believing souls in the old testament were kept in abraham's bosom in the heart of the earth separated only by a great chasm from the unbelievers in hell the devil had brought all men souls into bondage to sin by overcoming adam in eden jesus's self-sacrificial blood literally purchased the believer's souls back to god acts 20 verse 28 says christ purchased the church with his own blood since the wages of sin was death death of an innocent substitute was lawful payment or ransom for the redemption of believing souls matthew 20 verse 28 says the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many friend jesus's blood bought your soul you are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods now that christ's blood has paid in full the ransom for every believing soul there is now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit new testament believers can serve god with great freedom and liberty through a clean holy conscience hebrews 9 14 reads how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god if abraham could faithfully command and teach others god's will with a defiled conscience how much more should we serve our living god through the conscience purging blood of jesus christ let us serve him in complete liberation from condemnation romans 5 verse 1 rings true therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ paradise and the keys of death and hell before calvary satan held the keys of death and hell hebrews 2 verse 14 labels satan's keys as the power of death since they are not literal keys but spiritual authority satan earned the keys by beguiling eve into sinning which was followed by adam's willful sin through the fall satan conquered adam god's chosen ruler of the earth and all mankind came into bondage to satan and sin according to god's law ii peter 2 verse 19 says for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage for the next four thousand years after adam during the old testament mankind lived under this bondage and fear of death as slaves to sin thankfully another portion of god's law written in heaven before written on earth provided forgiveness of sins through the shedding of innocent blood this was certainly one of the better promises hebrews 9 verse 22 declares without shedding of blood is no remission substituting innocent blood and payment for someone else's sin is called a ransom or price for redeeming god ordained animal sacrifices to provide a temporary covering for sin in the old testament but not a total abolishment of sin truly the blood of bulls and goats could never take away sins which allowed satan to use the keys of death to keep all believers captive in the heart of the earth after their deaths animal sacrifices were limited in power only purifying the flesh and not the human spirit or conscience of man since a human adam calls the fall a human life not an animal life had to pay the ransom for sin first corinthians 15 verses 21 and 22 verify this saying for since by man came death by man mankind also the resurrection of the dead for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive a holy human sacrifice was needed to obtain eternal redemption for us and pay the full ransom for sin where could god get a holy sinless human being to become a willing offering for all humanity's sins god in his spirit form could not die and shed blood so he prepared himself a body his son and jesus willingly died on the cross to give his life a ransom for many just as god provided himself a sacrifice to save abraham's natural seed isaac god again provided his own sacrifice for abraham's spiritual seed the new testament church hebrews 9 verses 12 through 14 validates this saying neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who threw the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god in the next chapter hebrews 10 verses 1 through 18 these truths are expounded upon god prepared a body for himself since jesus is called emmanuel meaning god with us in the greek by jesus crucifixion we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once and for all jesus is pure sinless life made him the one and only acceptable sacrifice unto god allowing our sins and iniquities to be completely abolished hebrews 10 verse 14 and verses 17 through 18 reads for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin hebrews 2 verses 14 through 18 brings a great climax to this section pronouncing jesus's death destroyed satan's hold on the old testament saints and delivered them from bondage hebrews 2 verses 14 through 16 reads for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham by jesus paying the sin ransom with his holy blood he destroyed satan's influence over mankind as jesus's dead body lay in joseph of arimathea's tomb christ went by the spirit to hell located in the heart of the earth and took the keys of death and hell from satan christ now possessed the power of death this was a total surprise attack and raid upon hell neither satan nor the kings of the earth had predicted jesus redemption of the keys of death and hell that adam forfeited first corinthians 2 verses 7 and 8 says none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory if herod pilate and especially satan had known what jesus would accomplish after his death they would not have helped crucify him but god brilliantly hid jesus's raid on hell and subsequent resurrection in one of the 23 000 old testament verses psalm 16 verse 10 contains one of god's better promises jesus seizing the keys of death and hell david speaking of christ wrote for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither will thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption satan and the princes of the world didn't understand and weren't aware of the ramifications of the psalm 16 verse 10 prophecy allowing jesus to resurrect from the dead through jesus's innocent death he paid our ransom conquering death acts 2 verse 24 reads christ loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holding of it jesus paid our penalty and took death's keys from satan with the keys of death in his hand the true lion the lion of the tribe of judah led many of the old testament saints previously dwelling in abraham's bosom up to the earth's surface on easter morning christ first opened his grave and then many other graves of the saints who came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many job's prophecy had finally come true a resurrected job was standing in a new glorified body on the earth with his redeemer just as his vision predicted nearly sixteen hundred years before christ for i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god whom i shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another though my reigns be consumed within me jesus was seen for 40 days after his resurrection and it seems likely the old testament saints were also seen for this time period imagine the thrill for believers living in jerusalem to know they could see a resurrected christ as well as a resurrected abraham and sarah job joseph or david around any corner but imagine the shame and mental torment for men like caiaphas and pilate who might have seen the resurrected ones and heard report after report of jesus and the saints being alive at the conclusion of the 40-day period jesus ascended to heaven in a cloud inside of his apostles to sit at the right hand of the majesty on high as he went out of their sight ascending towards his heavenly throne he was joined by the resurrected old testament saints the saints followed their leader the son of god towards glory as ephesians 4 verse 5 says when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive jesus led captivity captive meaning he led the old testament saints out of captivity from the heart of the earth and into god's possession or divine captivity by god's power they rose higher and higher until they reached heaven's gates psalm 24 verses 7 through 10 records the dialogue between christ the resurrected saints and the angel doorkeepers as the resurrected ones arrive at heaven's doors jesus voice shouts lift up your heads o ye gates and be lift up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in the door dutifully asked for identification upon entrance into heaven saying who is this king of glory abraham sarah job and the resurrected saints proclaimed their king's credentials saying the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle how strong mighty and glorious was christ when he was slapped buffeted spit on beaten scoured stripped crucified and stabbed in obedience of the father's will christ endured the unfathomable brutality and shame of the cross for this moment the moment of joyfully entering his kingdom with his redeemed forgiven subjects hebrews 12 verse 2 says looking under jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god the dialogue repeats in psalm 24 verses 9-10 as jesus again commands for heaven's gates to be lifted up so the king of glory can enter the doorkeepers again ask who is the king of glory and the resurrected saints declare their savior jesus christ as the lord of hosts he is the king of glory jesus is the lord of hosts proving his supremacy over all creatures including the heavenly armies did not jesus say he had the option of asking his father for 12 legions of angels to appear at his side the greek meaning of legions is 6826 men exacting 12 legions or nearly 82 000 angels according to colossians 1 verses 15 through 17 christ is the image of the invisible god firstborn of every creature creator of all things before all things and by him all things consist the lord jesus christ is the king of glory since jesus's ascension to heaven with the resurrected old testament saints he has been fulfilling his high priest office seated on his heavenly throne making intercession for the saints living on earth in the new testament saint can no longer empower necromancers like the witch of endor to access believer's souls because they are protected in heaven by the blood of jesus christ god's son bruised the serpent's head on the cross crushing his venomous power of death life conquered death and now all who believe are freely forgiven all their trespasses and ascend to heaven upon death rather than descending to the lower parts of the earth paul knew upon his death he would ascend to heaven and put on his eternal body that awaited him there second corinthians 5 verses 1 and 2 says for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven paradise is no longer in the heart of the earth it's located in heaven in second corinthians 12 4 the apostle said he was caught up into paradise upon death christian souls ascend up to paradise not down christians are assured to be present with the lord after leaving their earthly bodies we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord souls and the book of life as illustrated in jesus's sower and the four grounds parable in matthew 13 verses three through nine see chapter eight each soul or ground has the opportunity to receive god's word or seed the mysterious truth of the second ground called the stony ground teaches souls like judas iscariot can temporarily receive the word faith and grow thereby for a period of time before ultimately rejecting it leaving their souls lost and bound for the lake of fire the stony ground's loss of sea life explains the oft misunderstood subject of names being blotted out from the book of life when a name is blotted out of the book of life the person loses the gift of salvation it's true a person can believe in christ for salvation but later reject christ just like a person can receive a christmas gift but later discard it both gifts salvation and a christmas present are given by unmerited grace but the receiver must accept and keep the gift salvation is a promise based upon conditions if you believe and endure unto the end hebrews 10 verse 39 says you must believe to the saving of the soul chapter 8 will deal more with this subject in light of judas iscariots falling away from salvation as john 17 verse 12 says none of the disciples were lost but the son of perdition jesus said he kept the other 11 disciples but judas was lost judas was saved but later forfeited salvation for money judas obtained part of a holy ghost ministry god took away his part out of the book of life when he betrayed christ you can read hebrews 6 verses 4 through 8 and hebrews 10 verses 26 through 29 and verses 38 and 39 in the meantime for more on this truth often repeat the phrase once saved always saved but judas proves this phrase incorrect the true phrase is once sealed always sealed based upon ephesians 4 30. once a believer's soul is sealed by the holy ghost baptism he is destined for heaven is there eternal security for christians yes every christian who meets god's salvation requirements is eternally secure your faith is the evidence of your eternal security john 10 verses 27 through 29 says jesus sheep hear his voice and he gives them eternal life messiah promises no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand but transgressors workers of iniquity the slawful and wicked have no eternal security because they forfeit eternal life for temporal pleasures of this life four astounding truths exist regarding the book of life first it's located in heaven and those whose names are on it should rejoice according to luke 10 verse 20. second it is the faithful witness the lord jesus who wrote the book of life but also he alone blots names out according to exodus 32 verses 32 and 33 deuteronomy 29 verse 20 and revelation 3 verse 5. these scriptures also teach christ blots out the names on the grounds of willfully sinning against him or failing to overcome the world third two scriptures revelation 13 verse 8 and revelation 17 verse 8 say all the names within the book of life were written before the foundation of the world through god's foreknowledge meaning there is no present compiling of names your name wasn't written on the book of life the day you were saved like many believe rather god foreknew you'd be saved and wrote it before the foundation of the world revelation 13 verse 8 and 17 verse 8 also reveal the fourth truth that unbelievers names or the wayside souls have never been nor ever will be written on the book of life figure 18 rightly divides the locations of names in heaven's books based upon jesus's classification of souls into four categories obviously the names of unbelievers are recorded in some heavenly books referred to in revelation 20 verse 12. but the only book with eternally saved names is another book which is the book of life figure 18 good souls matthew 13 verse 23 names written in the lamb section of the book of life before the foundation of the world also known as wise virgins in matthew 25 verses 1-13 thorny souls matthew 13 verse 22 names written in the book of life before the foundation of the world and left remaining therein also known as foolish virgins in matthew 25 verses 1 through 13. 13 stony souls matthew 13 verses 20 and 21 names were written in the book of life section before the foundation of the world but blotted out due to their sins wayside souls matthew 13 verse 19 names were never written in the book of life but were recorded in other books both the old and new testaments offer examples of names being blotted out of the book of life the old has three examples and the new alludes to one beginning in the old israel's worship of the golden calf in exodus 32 serves as the first witness of god blotting out names from the book of life moses unselfishly stood in the gap for idolatrous israel offering for his name to be blotted out instead of israel's but the lord said unto moses whosoever has sinned against me him will i blot out of my book hebrews 3 verses 16 through 19 and jude 1 verse 5 affirmed that many israelis who fell in the wilderness were lost their names being blotted out of the book of life two of the twelve tribes of israel dan and ephraim had their names blotted out from under heaven not in heaven for committing idolatry dan and ephraim were listed as part of the twelve sons of jacob that went into egypt in genesis 35 verses 22-26 both names remained in their tribal order after leaving egypt in numbers 10 verses 11-28 but deuteronomy 29 verses 16-20 had pronounced the blotting out warning to any israeli who would go and serve the gods of these nations saying the lord shall blot out his name from under heaven the tribe of dan's idolatry is recorded in first kings 12 verses 25-30 and ephraim's joining to idols is found in hosea 4 verse 17. the consequences for their idolatry is nearly 3 000 years without tribal recognition proven in revelation 7 verses 4 through as dan and ephraim's tribal names are missing from the 144 000 jews who are marked in their foreheads before the great destructions of the tribulation period surprisingly though god's amazing grace restores their tribal names in the millennium according to ezekiel 48 verses 1 through 8 and verses 22-29 because dan and ephraim as literal sons of jacob will be resurrected as overcomers to inherit their tribe's portion of land the third blotting out took place at the very conclusion of the old testament at jesus's crucifixion after pilate's attempt to wash his hands of guilt and claim his innocence in jesus death all the people answered him his blood be upon us and our children the israeli multitude willingly rejected some ignorantly though as jesus prayed for their forgiveness their own messiah and paul says they were broken off or cut off from the life of god or holy spirit in romans 11 verse 19. psalm 69 verses 20 through 28 prophesied of christ's calvary humiliation and also the blotting out of the workers of iniquity who consented to jesus death verse 21 says they gave me also gal for meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink and then verse 28 reads let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous many jews who rejected jesus had their names blotted out of the book of life but the apostle reassures us not all israel is lost though saying even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace even though the majority rejected their messiah god still saved the small remnant who worshiped in spirit and truth judas iscariot is the new testament example for an individual's name being blotted out of the book of life chapter 5 details his reception and eventual rejection of salvation but now you must know he was chosen by christ believed in christ was baptized under repentance and baptized others judas was commissioned by christ with the same holy ghost anointed ministry as the other 11 apostles in luke 9 verses 1 and 2. then in luke 10 verses 17 17-24 judas was among the group that jesus said had their names written in heaven sadly judas fell from his salvation by the wicked transgression of betrayal going to his own place or hell jesus says judas is lost he lost his soul his name's part on the book of life judas was overcome by the love of money he didn't overcome sin and consequently jesus was required to blot his name off the book of life had judas fully repented of his transgression and went to pentecost to receive the baptism of the holy ghost he would have been eternally sealed his name could have remained on the book but he departed from the faith like the stony ground judas for a while believed but then rejected the truth since he had no root in himself no deep genuine love for christ since paul says christians are rooted and grounded in love judas let the word seed grow a little making some progress but later let it die while the book of life was written before the foundation of the world and doesn't have names added to it during human history there is another heavenly book called the book of remembrance that is written in real time before the lord in his presence its purpose is to record the thoughts words and deeds of them that fear the lord malachi 3 verse 15 says then they that fear the lord spake often one to another and the lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and that thought upon his name in hebrew remembrance means memorial notice godly words and deeds are written therein acts 10 verses 3 and 4 seems to refer to this book as an angel of god tells cornelius his prayers and alms are come up for a memorial before god the book of remembrance will be useful in the future a signing of heavenly rewards finishing the book of life teaching there will be a future writing and compilation of names in a book in the new jerusalem also called mount zion the city of the living god in hebrews 12 22 god foreknows all future inhabitants of this holy city psalm 87 verse 6 shows god will make a revised role of names who remain in the book of life after the second resurrection the lord shall count when he writeth up the people that this man was born there salah herein is the final roll call in heaven how we want our names to be in that number soul searching you may have heard christians say they search their soul for answers in the midst of life's trials most likely we can all relate to a time of soul searching a time to make major life decisions like salvation marriage family ending relationships or moving locations the bible calls this communing with your own heart as explained by david asaph and solomon this truth helps you understand how you can know your soul condition whether faith is present the soul is saved or absent the soul is lost you might also call soul searching a testing time or trial of your faith peter admits there are seasons in which your faith will undergo fiery tests in first peter 1 verses 6 through 8 despite unspeakable loss suffering and disappointment the prophet job eventually recognized his faith was on trial he put his confidence in god and knew the outcome would produce godly character job 23 verse 10 reads but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath tried me i shall come forth as gold in psalm 4 verse 4 david writes stand in awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still soul searching is best accomplished during distraction free quiet time asaph's words in psalm 77 verse 6 provide the great revelation that the human spirit or mind stills itself before searching the soul i call to remembrance my song in the night i commune with my own heart and my spirit made diligent search it is during the still moments and hours of soul searching that god leads and accompanies every heart on its soul search the gentle spirit of god anoints each human spirit to search its motives and objectives that originated in the soul recall the soul is home of freemore agency the human will as each soul comes in god's view he weighs the actions thoughts and decisions and gives each person the fruit of their doings first chronicles 28 verse 9 says the lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou forsake him he will cast thee off forever jeremiah 17 verse 10 adds i the lord search the heart i try the reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings jesus is the lord for revelation 2 verse 23 is jesus proclaiming i am he which searches the reigns and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works at the conclusion of the search every soul decides to continue in their own will or abandon it for god's a worthy soul abandons their selfish will and seeks god's will and he promises to be found jeremiah 29 13 states and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart god satisfies the holy thirst inside worthy souls and unworthy souls like the rich man in jesus's parable in luke 12 verses 16-21 the context is jesus encouraging a man to not covet his father's inheritance in verses 13-15 jesus portrays a rich man communing with his own soul a rich man's human spirit tells his soul to take its ease in other words the man tells his own soul to take peace and comfort in his riches and to cease from trusting in god in luke 12 19 jesus makes it seem the human spirit or consciousness actually talks to the soul because it says and i will say to my soul soul thou has much goods laid up for many years take thy knees eat drink and be merry truly your consciousness either satisfies the holy thirst to know god in your soul or silences it jesus is parable about the rich man building greater barns is a classic example of a soul drawing back from living by faith the rich man told his soul to cease trusting in god and to trust in his great barns similarly judas iscariot's drawing back moment was his decision to leave jesus and his apostles at the last supper betraying his lord john 13 verse 2 reads and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him judas leaving the communion table symbolized him leaving faith judas left grace grace never left him he embodied hebrews 12 15 which says men can fail or fall back from the grace of god judas did despite unto the spirit of grace meaning he insulted the holy ghost he cast aside his faith and its absence allowed satan to enter judas heart luke 22 3 explains then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot being of the number of the twelve i'm persuaded you can choose a better destiny than judas hebrews 6 verses 9 through 12 declares but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which ye have showed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises dividing asunder soul and spirit while the soul and human spirit are closely connected scripture says they can be differentiated in order to allow individual ministry in care your soul is like the core of the human spirit and they are interdependent adam became a living soul when both his human spirit and soul entered his body genesis 2 verse 7 says adam became a living soul as god breathed into his nostrils the breath of life once adam's human spirit and soul were placed inside his body he was alive contrary-wise at adam's passing away his human spirit and soul left his body and he was dead or separated from this earth a seed serves as a suitable illustration for man's three parts the seed coat is like the body the stored food like the human spirit and the embryo represents the soul a complete seed always has all three parts just as a human being is complete with the body human spirit and soul as a seed can be divided into its three parts man's three parts can be divided or differentiated by god's word hebrews 4 verse 12 declares for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints in morrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the word reveals the location of the spiritual battle whether in the soul or human spirit it also discerns or judges the thoughts and intents of the human spirit and soul when you hear it said i'm having a mind battle you know the person's human spirit is under attack this is when your mind feels foggy and confused paul says the word of god is our mighty weapon amidst mind battles in second corinthians 10 verse 5 casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ battle ready christians cast down or reject evil thoughts choosing to dwell on god's word in order to win mind battles paul says god's peace comes to those who purposely think on things that are true honest just pure lovely of good report virtuous and praiseworthy if someone says i'm going through a soul-searching time it usually means their soul is at war with possibly both the flesh and human spirit attacking it you already learned how soul searching is when major choices are made and when faith is tested and tried peter confirms how the flesh wars against the soul saying dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul a young christian man in the corinth church was so overtaken by the fleshly lust of sexual immorality that paul excommunicated him from the church in hopes his soul would be saved paul recognized the battle for the deputy's soul in acts 13 verses 6 through 12 when elimus the sorcerer tried to stop the deputy from hearing paul's preaching the deputy's soul desired to hear the word of god being preached the spirit led paul to pronounce temporary blindness upon elimus so the deputies hungry soul could receive the word upon seeing this mighty sign the deputy believed the gospel all christians benefit from god's sword word separating the soul from the human spirit in order to faithfully minister to their individual needs most often this happens as christians listen to preaching romans 10 verse 17 reads so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god through my own church attendance and preaching i've seen the holy spirit minister to believers minds by presenting new scriptures they had never seen before thereby helping them understand god's will and truth other times the word preached brings peace to unsettled minds i've also seen the word minister to the needs of the soul as god seeks his children's obedience submission and praise indeed the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god ephesians 4 verses 11 through 16 teaches the holy spirit anoints the fivefold preaching ministry to equip and edify believers while bringing a unity of faith and knowledge about jesus christ the word conforms us to be christ-like transforming our thinking to renew our minds then the renewed human spirit can prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god a renewed mind clearly understands god's perfect will for its soul jesus is universal invite to receive the soul baptism jesus paul and his new testament church sound a universal invitation to receive both salvation and the baptism of the holy ghost christ doesn't discriminate age race or gender all who want to be saved and filled with the holy ghost can be jesus in john 7 verses 37 through 39 offer the living water of the holy spirit to any man saying if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink in matthew 11 verses 28 through 30 jesus invites all to come unto him for soul rest come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest paul says more of the same in romans 10 verses 12 and 13 for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved the holy spirit in the bride or new testament church freely offers the water of life to everyone in revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely if you're thirsty for eternal water god is ready to quench your thirst this gracious universal invitation will be referenced on judgment day as everyone will admit to having an opportunity to repent and accept jesus christ as their savior recall romans 1 verse 20 teaches there'll be no excuses on the day of judgment yes romans 2 verse 16 says that day is coming the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel no secret will be kept from jesus christ at that day the gospel he commissioned and revealed to paul will be his judgment standard respond to his loving universal invitation by receiving christ as savior and as your souls rest predestined to receive the soul baptism although the invitation is universal its reception is not jesus said few will find the narrow road that leads to life but scripture gives us an assurance that all of god's predestined elected and foreknown sons and daughters will receive the baptism of the holy ghost paul is the main teacher about god's foreknowledge and predestination ephesians 1 verses 4 and 5 say god chose us in him before the foundation of the world and then predestined us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself imagine that before the world was founded god knew human history and chose you and his mind to be adopted into his family by jesus christ spirit god didn't force you to choose him he knew you would choose him and with that foreknowledge he predestined how and when you'd be born again by a spirit god knows all who will receive and those who will not romans 8 verses 29 and 30 provide the divine order of his own counsel for whom he did for no he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified god's three steps in his eternal order for salvation is foreknowledge predestination and calling the almighty begins by knowing your ultimate choice about salvation then predestinates the events of your life so you can receive his calling to the new birth he already knows you'll receive him and be baptized with his holy spirit after explaining this it seems paul is supercharged with faith because his next words are what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us peter's first epistle also identifies foreknowledge as god's determining factor for salvation through eternal infinite foreknowledge the lord knows who will accept the gospel then he elects or chooses believers for his purposes first peter 1 verse 2 proclaims elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ paul's letter to the galatians provides the capstone on the baptism of the holy ghost revelation galatians 4 verses 1 through 7 likens us to servants to sin until god adopted us into his family through christ's work on the cross why did we receive the baptism of the holy ghost because we already were sons in god's mind galatians 4 verse 6 declares and because ye are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father god's foreknowledge before the world was founded told him you choose him so you've always been a son or daughter in his thinking even before you knew you loved god you already were his child the prodigal son parable in luke 15 verses 11 through 32 perfectly expresses this thought just like the prodigal left his father's house we willingly leave righteousness and run from truth some of us run for longer than others but eventually we come to ourselves as the prodigal did amongst the swine was the prodigal any less of a son while eating the swines as husks no he was fully a son just out of position until he repented i remember the moment i came to myself and knew i could return to my heavenly father do you and i remember the feeling of the father running to receive me back into his family after the prodigal's repentance the father gave him shoes a ring and change of clothes which typed the baptism of the holy ghost the prodigal was freshly clothed or endued with power authority from his father just as jesus says his born-again child receives power from on high because the prodigal was a son the father could give him the clothes and because you're a child of god he can give you the baptism of the holy ghost despite your disgraceful past this is amazing grace knowing god's foreknowledge helps you understand scriptures that may have been perplexing but beforehand no one rebuked the unbelieving jews as much as christ when he proclaimed the devil was their father and said their converts were two-fold more children of hell than they were was jesus being unfair or partial of course not he was speaking by the foreknowledge god had made known to him about their eternal destinies for jesus said he only spoke what god showed him in john 14 verse 17 christ goes as far as saying worldly persons cannot receive the holy spirit even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelt with you and shall be in you jesus sheep his predestinated children will hear and obey his voice god's sheep have eternal security because god knows they will faithfully believe the goats will not believe john 10 verses 26-28 reads but ye believe not because you are not of my sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand our human perspective can only hope and wish for people to be saved and baptized with the holy ghost but god's eternal perspective allows him to foreknow all who will receive him god created time space and matter so he's outside of time limits he knows the beginning from the end having no beginning of days nor end of life in the midst of any obstacle to win souls believers must continue to finish the great commission while sharing jesus confidence that every predestinated believer will come home to the heavenly father messiah says all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out the rewards for receiving the revelation of the baptism of the holy ghost outstanding rewards await those who receive the revelation of the baptism of the holy ghost both in this life and the life to come the great rewards in this life are possessing eternal life experiencing god's fellowship possessing spiritual sight manifesting the fruits of the spirit and a small remnant will escape death altogether in the rapture eternal life as a personal possession during this life serves as an anchor for your soul anchors usually ground boats to rocks below but the soul anchor lifts you upward do you know where your soul anchor catches within the holiest of holies in heaven hebrews 6 verses 19 through 20 says which hope we have as an anchor for the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil whither the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made in high priest forever after the order of melchizedek paul agrees saying we are seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus the eternal soul anchor again gives you assurance of eternal life since the holy ghost is eternal life called the eternal spirit in hebrews 9 14 every born-again christian possesses a small portion of god's own life death is passed out of your soul in john 5 24 jesus says verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life this eternal internal assurance is available to you now but wasn't obtainable for adam noah abraham moses and the rest of the old testament saints second spirit-filled believers experience a divine partaking of christ's fellowship while living in this corrupt world through meditation prayer and worship you can know christ intimately paul was born again and said he knew christ in two ways in his resurrection power and in the fellowship of his sufferings you were dead in sins but now your soul is alive through resurrection power none but jesus walks with you during your sufferings whether you're physically or mentally persecuted these dreadful seasons may actually best manifest christ's fellowship with you as you learn to lean upon him rather than men as your fellowship increases with christ your fellowship with the world family friends and associates decreases the longer paul preached the more he was rejected by men such as the so-called believers in asia and also demas but paul had consolation christ's grace was with him throughout his sufferings and he'd receive a crown of life upon entering heaven third holy ghost-filled saints or wise virgin christians are the only group on earth that possess spiritual eyesight or understanding starting with jews and gentiles paul says most jews are blinded to the gospel in romans 11 verse 25 their eyes will be opened to christ after the times of the gentiles is over moving on to the gentiles there are three types sinners foolish virgin christians and wise virgin christians second corinthians 4 verse 4 says satan has blinded the minds of them which believe not sinners minds denounce the spiritual light or knowledge of jesus's glorious gospel some might think foolish virgins have spiritual eyesight but three texts matthew 25 verse 8 john 3 verse 3 and revelation 3 verse 17 prove otherwise in matthew 25 verse 8 the lamps of the foolish virgins are gone out no fire no light this means the fullness of the holy ghost does not shine in their souls foolish virgins are saved being spiritual virgins but did not fully prepare to possess the oil of the holy ghost baptism therefore they do not fully know christ in his resurrection power and the fellowship of his sufferings god's light has shine in our hearts our souls and we have this treasure in earth and vessels true spiritual eyesight lets us see the world through god's eyes our worldview matches god's because we hate all sin choosing to love holiness obedience and righteousness jesus says you can only see or understand the kingdom of god when you're born again in john 3 verse 3. foolish virgins then cannot understand and thus cannot obey kingdom truths foolish virgins are part of the blind lukewarm group in revelation 3 verses 14 through 22 fluctuating between occasional love for god and love for worldly pleasures a common example of american lukewarmness in my region is church members loving both football games and their sunday worship service these foolish christians spend their entire saturday and sunday evening each weekend from september to february worshiping for six or more hours at the throne of the ohio state buckeyes and cleveland browns football teams some will even go to friday night high school football games wasting another three hours yet they will enjoy their one to two hours at their sunday morning church services their weekends are grossly lukewarm not hot or fully focused on serving jesus christ fourthly born-again christians are the only group on earth who manifest the fruits of the holy ghost jesus's the sower and the four grounds parable found in matthew 13 verses 3 through 9 and verses 18 through 23 reveals there are four heart reactions to hearing christ's gospel only one reaction from the honest and good heart brings forth fruit galatians 5 verses 22 through 23 lists the nine precious and rare fruits of the spirit love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance all other religions produce imitation fruit they promote good works but without the seed of god's word and the truths of jesus christ gospel there is no real fruit production first corinthians 13 verses 1 through 3 says good works done without christ's love even giving away all your money and dying at the stake is a martyr prophet the worker nothing fifth a small remnant of holy ghost-filled christians who live until the end of the gentile church ages see chapter 7 will experience the earthly reward of escaping death their bodies will be changed swallowed up in life at the last trump and they will need no funeral christ will snatch them away in the rapture before the awful tribulation period chapter 12 fully details this earthly reward for the soul baptized saints who are privileged to live until christ's literal coming heavenly rewards are numerous as well for those receiving the privilege of obtaining the first resurrection or rapture chapter 12 details the heavenly rewards which include meeting jesus and the resurrected saints at the meeting in the air the wedding supper of the lamb and the 1000 year earthly millennial reign paul said he would press towards the mark and go to any means to attain unto the resurrection of the dead and so should we be willing to lose our lives in order to gain heaven's future rewards revelation 20 verse 6 gives two descriptions for christians who attain the first resurrection blessed and holy immediately following the millennium is the climatic white throne judgment in which every soul that ever lived will be judged by their works and either granted eternal life or cast into the lake of fire there is one special reward for the holy ghost baptized saint at this judgment sitting with christ in his throne this is the final reward spoken to the overcomer in the laodicean church age in revelation 3 verse 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne obviously every overcomer from every age will inherit this reward based upon revelation 21 verse 7 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son muse about this reward and consider how all men and women throughout earth's history will be gathered at this second resurrection matthew 25 verses 32 and 33 describes it as all nations being gathered in one place in order to be separated into two groups the saved and the lost cain abel and nimrod will be there along with jacob and esau moses and pharaoh will be present in attendance will be famous men like goliath buddha cyrus confucius darius cicero and julius caesar men that other men esteem great like alexander the great will all stand face to face with the true great one the lord jesus christ what excuse would these men be able to make for not obeying the portion of god's truth that was available during their lifetimes if they refuse god's word there will be no excuses jesus tells us he will raise up witnesses who endured identical temptations but were overcomers first corinthians 10 verse 13 teaches our temptations are common to man or all the same therefore we are all judged by the same standard unrepentant ones who possessed great earthly power perhaps like alexander the great will not be able to plead that their temptation was too great to overcome because god will raise up moses as a witness since he overcame the temptation of riches and power in egypt hebrews 11 verses 24-27 says moses refused royal egyptian status pleasures and riches in order to be a part of god's people you can do the same matthew 12 verses 41 and 42 shows how jesus will use the men of nineveh and the queen of the south as witnesses against the unbelievers pharisees sadducees etc of his earthly ministry which lived 800 and a thousand years beforehand respectively the men of nineveh are witnesses because they repented at the preaching of a lesser preacher than jesus jonah the queen of the south is a witness because she traveled a great distance to hear a less gifted man than jesus solomon you learn god only requires respect for his preaching servants in every generation respect to a lesser gift of god will witness against those who disrespected a greater gift and where will moses the men of nineveh and the queen of south be sitting at this judgment they'll be sitting with jesus on his throne as he promised in revelation 3 verse 21 paul promises the same that the saints will judge the world and even angels in first corinthians six verses two and three yes if you're an overcomer you will sit by jesus and judge the very demons that tempted and attacked you second peter two verse four and jude 1 verse 6 teach some fallen angels are already awaiting judgment paul describes human history as a theater or spectacle unto angels in first corinthians 4 verse 9. fallen angels watch our lives like spectators sitting in a theater and then planning carry out evil against us but through the grace of jesus christ every overcomer testifies against the demons at the great white throne judgment and becomes a spectator as the wicked angels are cast into the lake of fire the consequences for rejecting the revelation of the baptism of the holy ghost returning to jesus's sower and foregrounds parable from matthew 13 there are serious consequences to the three other heart reactions that reject the revelation of the holy ghost baptism recall the four reactions to hearing christ's gospel one honest and good two thorny three stoney and four wayside this section details the consequences for the thorny stoney and wayside the thorny reaction is the foolish virgin christian who is indeed eternally saved but misses being part of the rapture and millennium because he failed to prepare oil for the bridegroom's coming in short he foolishly stopped short of his soul being sealed by the holy ghost like israel's exodus from egypt he came all the way to the jordan river or holy ghost baptism only to shrink back in unbelief the honest and good heart had fruit representing the nine fruits of the spirit but the thorny hearted believers brought forth no fruit any farmer or common house deader knows a disappointment at harvest time when there's a lack of fruitfulness they understand the painful feelings of knowing an opportunity was lost and potential wasn't reached you can begin to see god's disappointment at the lack of spiritual fruit in the foolish virgins as he is the lord of the soul harvest yet he's patient as the divine husbandman to wait for the precious fruit of the earth according to james 5 verse 7. you might wonder why such harsh consequences exist to the saved thorny hard believer isaiah 35 8 holds the answer and and highway shall be there and away and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not air therein god's command for believers to walk in holiness is so simple and he's provided such great mighty weapons of warfare that only a fool would squander the once in a life opportunity to be part of the holy ghost kingdom of god so god calls them fools who fall short of the seal of god combined with this the fact that everyone is freely and repeatedly invited to receive the holy ghost baptism and it causes the foolish virgin to miss out on indescribably honorable events like the rapture the wedding supper and the millennium putting three other scriptures together you see more obvious foolish attributes of this thorny-hearted group first luke 11 13 records jesus's pledge to give the holy spirit to anyone who asks the context is god the father portrayed as a generous father who delights in giving his children gifts this shows thorny hearts do not pray enough failing to ask god for the soul baptism next matthew 5 6 says foolish virgins neglect their spiritual hunger and thirst this is true because in christ's beatitude he promised to fill those who hungered and thirsted for righteousness the fact the foolish virgins were not born again shows they neglected their souls thirst for god third ephesians 5 verses 15 through 17 identifies faulty time management as an attribute of the foolish virgins because paul says the wise christians redeem their time foolish christians waste their time on frivolous cares of the world movies sports entertainments comedy riches social media and more time wasting was an attribute of the foolish virgins in matthew 5 3. they didn't plan ahead for the fact the bridegroom might tarry which he did in the spiritual sense they didn't pray seek god repent or worship enough they were invited to the rapture but didn't prepare in time jesus christ didn't have preeminence in their lives a stony heart one who temporarily believes in christ but then rejects him inherits awful consequences for devaluing the baptism of the holy ghost there are different degrees of punishment for those who once believed the gospel but left it luke 12 47 and 48 records jesus's own words you must heed and that servant which knew his lord's will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes but he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes here you learn punishment is based upon how much truth a person knew judas iscariot is the infamous example of someone who knew very much about the gospel but forfeited it he believed and served jesus for a season at least three years before betraying our messiah it would have been better for judas to have never been born compared to the woes that await him in torment no doubt he like others who serve christ but later betray him will be beaten with many stripes matthew 26 24 records jesus's words about judas's awaiting judgment the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born your heart sings for judas because he had the highest calling in scripture apostle and had the greatest completely blameless leader jesus christ and still forsook truth furthermore he was less than two months away from receiving the baptism of the holy ghost in the upper room in acts chapter 2. he turned his back on christ despite being so incredibly close to the spiritual promised land of the new birth finally the wayside heart one who briefly entertains believing in christ before letting satan snatch god's word from his soul also receives disgraceful dejected and sorrowful consequences many wayside hearts spitefully work against the lord jesus and purposely deceive distract tempt and destroy others they'll have degrees of damnation based upon the level of evil their souls created religious unbelievers like the scribes and pharisees of jesus day will receive the greater damnation because they blasphemed christ but also kept others from entering into god's promises any city that rejected the preaching of jesus disciples will have more intense punishment than the sodomites according to christ in luke 10 verses 1 through 12. jesus specifically names the cities of chorazin bethsaida and capernaum as having worse torment than tyree and sidon because they saw more mighty works and failed to repent conclusion christ's own words in john 7 verses 37 and 39 combined with paul's declaration in colossians 1 26 that the baptism of the holy ghost was hidden from ages and generations old testament saints could only experience a limited temporary anointing of the holy ghost upon their flesh and minds but new testament saints are privileged to possess the permanent eternal seal of the holy ghost in our souls the baptism of the holy ghost revelation can hardly be overemphasized because without god's soul seal a person profits nothing first corinthians 13 verses 1 through 3 says you can understand all the mysteries all 12 taught in this book and yet not have charity the baptism of the holy ghost god's presence in your soul is the relationship element of your walk with almighty god revelation without relationship profits little to nothing peter is the prime example for he possessed revelation that jesus was the christ in matthew 16 verses 16 through 17 but you know he later denied christ to a young maid three times peter received the relationship with christ the holy ghost baptism in acts chapter 2 verse 4 and was a new man afterwards being crucified upside down at the end of his life as a martyr to honor jesus relationship or oneness with christ profits your soul eternally my prayer for you is that you'll soon have a see in here experience like peter's if you haven't already now that you've received this revelation the bible makes sense and you understand the unified terminology for the baptism of the holy ghost most importantly you understand the need for all believers to understand and experience a deeper fuller experience with the holy ghost christ's blood purchased not only our forgiveness but the right for his spirit to baptize our souls into his kingdom because of his great sacrifice on the cross we are motivated to share his desire to constantly walk talk and dwell in his children's souls jesus wants more than a sinner's prayer and a speaking and unknown tongue's experience christ longs for intimate oneness with your soul action steps to the baptism of the holy ghost step number one if you haven't been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ obey this command if you have repent thoroughly of every known sin commune with christ upon your bed or in your prayer closet and let him walk you through your mind and soul that you can see the current state of each step number two look at the seven character traits of the stature of a perfect man and ask god to add his character to your being while waiting for the new birth devote yourself to a season of prayer and worship as you wait upon the lord's timing step number three recall corneas life and imitate it in love fast pray and give alms empty yourself of selfishness and live for others then god will come and fill you
