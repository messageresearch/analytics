somebody have a song special one of these days jose i'm going to ask you to sing a special guy it's been a long time buddy [Laughter] [Music] i've seen battle him in the republic one of these days okay you just pray about that that was that's a great song amen amen just as you're led [Laughter] praise the lord beautiful amen well let's thank the lord for those testimonies praise god i'm not going to turn us in a testimony meeting but sister naomi can i share just briefly about your testimony you shared on wednesday night so what uh sister naomi was telling me on wednesday night after church a few years ago she was praying god you know she was she really wanted a confirmation that she'd been baptized with the holy ghost and she prayed lord let me speak in tongues as a sign i have the holy ghost well she prayed it years ago was it that church you prayed or was it somewhere else at church and then uh she forgot about it as many times we do right we pray we ask god for signs and miracles and we ask god for great things we forget about it he's like brother braham he'd have visions he'd write it down and just forget about it and then god in the moment then god would bring it back to him oh this is what i prayed for this is the vision that i saw and then sister naomi said uh she remembered in a service i think it was a couple years ago the holy spirit fell on her and she spoke in tongues you probably remember that by god's grace so that's a great testimony i thought if we ask god our hearts desire he's faithful and just to minister to that so i just thought i'd share that testimony let's give that a round of applause praise god i love it i love things like that do you want to quickly share the testimony of uh your wife praying for you would that be okay yeah um i think it was on tuesday tuesday night or monday night um i was sleeping and i felt this really um evil spirit come upon while i was sleeping and um you know you like i was sleeping and behind me i heard the it was like a tv noise like the radio static noise it was getting louder and louder and i knew it was like the devil coming and and i was i i you know in that realm you can't really pray or say anything you know so i i just kind of turned my arm to my wife because i i wasn't able to move and that my wife i think she was awake or she woke up and she's like she put her hand on my hand and she started praying in the name of jesus in the name of jesus and that she felt um her arm go numb and the she felt like it kind of like transferred over here and and as soon as i heard her pray i felt a breeze of a wind of relief of like the presence of god coming down and the evil spirit just blew away i'm like wow and i woke up and told my wife did you just pray for me because i just because i just felt like you prayed for me and i felt the presence of god just come and deliver me from that wow praise the lord for that amen praise god that's what we're talking about the living presence of jesus christ in our lives i just thought i'd share that testimony back here testimony here let's thank the lord again praise god amen [Music] [Music] for me lord of every victory hallelujah a cloud by

i can't [Music] oh i am you can light it up [Music] is [Music] that's greece that's right we serve the god of revival thank god i want to look a little more at that today by god's grace we'd like to continue that little thought from wednesday returning to pentecost uh then returning to heaven like to return or work on that thought uh malachi can you switch over there for me buddy let me show a quick picture of zion i told you i'd do that here doing good by god's grace i appreciate your prayers i don't get to hold him as much as i like to but he's doing good that's where he's almost smiling there he's almost got a smile so praise the lord god is good we're thankful uh lord willing i'd like to look at this thought today now tonight i want to look at um is the is 2020 the year of the rapture we've johnny shared a video with me and bang shared a video with me different people saying i mean denominational people saying the rapture is going to happen this year um i don't personally think it is but i'm ready praise god amen if it's this year i'm ready it's next year i'm ready praise god amen how do you know cause my lamp is trimmed praise god amen i've got extra oil praise god i'm not looking around saying oh where's the oil where's the holy ghost where's holy ghost it's right here in me praise god i see my daily life if i didn't i would be down here at the altar praise god i would be so we're thankful uh for god's grace um did i uh i've been watching those videos uh yesterday and today sorry did i get the wrong ones here i meant to put part two on there so i'm sorry i just i thought i put part two but i forgot i did let's go to joel 2 i'd like to read our scripture joel chapter 2 verse 23 and then we'll read our memory verse by god's grace remember verses 23 to 26 is thus saith the lord uh the fullness of pentecost will be in the bride amen it's thus saith the lord so um this is a scripture that we're we're presently to fulfill god is in the process of fulfilling this we're a part of i believe the former rain the teaching rain as we said on wednesday there has to be a rain and anointing for this day and it's mechanics but ram said it's mechanics getting the mechanic down and then once the mechanics are come he said then the dynamics can come that would be rapturing faith amen praise god and so that's what we're living in today and i want to show a few scriptures uh to kind of vindicate that as well so joel 2 23. i'll just read verse 20 i'll read 23 and then we can all read matthew 6. so just let me read this one myself just to save us a little bit of time verse 23 says be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month praise god so let's go now to matthew 6 30. our memory verse from brother stephen he apologizes he can't be here he has to work they're doing uh seven day shifts now he's really disappointed with that uh and when we pray for the preaching we can also pray for him that uh they'll decrease the hours and that's something that seems like our brothers you know oftentimes it's either too much work or not enough it's just hard to find that middle of the road you know it's hard to find that but god knows you know god allows it as we heard last week god has to allow everything that happens and he's uh he's wanting to see us overcome with a good testimony amen praise god in fact if if job is applied just like us then god's like just go head devil go and test brother amen go and test brother so and so go and test sister so-and-so they're gonna overcome amen he knows we're going to overcome praise god he's not wondering he knows praise god matthew 6 30 down to 34. let's read that on three one two three wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall not he much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof let's have a word of prayer let's remember to pray for brother stephen and those we don't see here this morning as well don't see sister wendy and uh perhaps the roles will be here this afternoon we'll see but let's pray for those also let's pray for the holy spirit to minister now to our every need heavenly father we love you we bless you lord we've kept the the command of the word to gather more we prayed oh god we've we've read your word uh lord the songs have gone forth and now it's time for the preaching of the words time for battle lord god and may the word come forth in its power to strengthen us lord to meet every need edify us today lord god raise our faith let your gifts of the holy spirit operate lord god let your will be done we pray and father we ask that you meet all the needs of the saints here lord be with brother stephen as he's working god strengthen him let your spirit just minister to him direct all of his thoughts lord as much as he can as he's working to your word dear god and we just pray for the brothers and the church and lord that they get enough hours lord god and if they have extra that you give them grace to hang on uh until this the situation changes oh god and bless our sisters as well wonderful faithful mothers and grandmothers lord god and strengthen them lord in their homes lord and father just be magnified and glorified today where we place all these requests into your nail-scarred hands for we know you can handle all of them nothing is too hard for the lord so we thank you for that and we give you the praise in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen praise god god bless you as you're being seated praise the lord so by god's grace we'll do just a quick review from wednesday i'd just like to kind of remind everybody where uh our thoughts were for wednesday uh brother and i were talking last sunday about the rapture it just kind of got me thinking where's my slide with part two i just put in the wrong spot so forgive me but anyways we're looking at our vision our vision is uh joel 2 but the bible says where there's no vision that people perish right i'm sorry and the vision actually there means a divine communication so a lot of churches today don't have a divine communication and what i mean by that they don't have thus saith the lord they've got the bible but they don't have a divine communication living in their day or in their generation right that where they got thus saith the lord there in the perfect will of god now we got it by god's grace so i'm very thankful for that praise god and so we're living off that revelation remember habakkuk he said when you see the vision write it and run with it he said you just gotta wait though we gotta be patient aren't you glad it's part of the stature perfect man god knew you need patience so he built it in to your character praise god and if you really got holy ghost patience you can wait for the rapture praise god hallelujah and then remember we'll return to heaven because we came out of heaven this wasn't my main subject as far as now but the bible said you're chosen in him and then you got eternal theophany in the heavens so you have representation there you don't remember it because you were in the mind of god uh you don't remember when god made all those theophanies but you got one up there praise god the ram said when uh when god made adam and east theophany he made all yours too now that's something i wonder where that little section of heaven is that has all the theophanies waiting for us but brother adam said that's what he did he said adam and eve got placed in that theophany when they were just they were just a spirit hovering around the earth right they were in that theophy then god divided them and placed them in flesh bodies but all of our theophanies somewhere must be up in some bank in heaven i imagine somewhere some storage room or something uh and just remember you know the bible said above man said a group's gonna rise up that will listen to the spirit and by the pure word now that's why church we've got to take everything brother branham said back to the word amen and the holy spirit will help us do that like i was emailing the brother i summoned her back from brother joseph i was emailing one of his people that go to the church and i said well brother branham said pray to the third person of the trinity there's a quote brother says pray to the third person the trinity i said is your pastor going to teach you guys to pray to the third person the trinity this weekend and he just totally moved it off to another subject see because they can't they can't they have to accept every word as thus saith the lord uh because they don't know how to rightly divide it but see if we've got the holy ghost we can rightly divide it amen and we're going to believe the pure word not a tainted word not a a contradictory word but we're going to believe just the word of god amen and brother man like every man like you and i we grow in understanding uh we have to grow in revelation praise god and so those things don't stumble us but we know the word the bride has to be a pure word bride praise god because jesus is all word and we've got to be one with the word praise god and jesus is the word and so when we have the pure word we'll return to the full power of pentecost and that's joel remember joel 2 23. uh brother ram said it's it's a necessity of a return of dynamic power and we saw joel 2 23 as thus saith the lord the fullness of pentecost now what will that entail i don't know i don't know which parts of pentecost it will entail but uh it's thus saith the lord praise god so whatever they had the faith they had at pentecost we'll have it right before the rapture by god's grace of course i believe we have a portion of it now of course i believe that we couldn't have all these testimonies without the same faith praise god hallelujah now i'm just skipping ahead from wednesday like like you saw now brother ram said mechanics and dynamics uh he said we got to get the mechanics in order and then the dynamics will come he said uh which is rapturing faith uh and remember we saw how god said doctrine is like rain so when someone teaches you the truth about doctrine which is instruction it's the it's a refreshing anointing of the holy spirit i felt it when i first heard serpent seed i felt it fall like rain praise god when i forgot about cutting my hair and men got to have short hair i had i had a mullet can you imagine me with the mullet i had a big mullet well as soon as i heard that i cut my hair it was refreshing like rain see that doctrine is like rain it's a fresh oh now i know what to do now i know what god's telling me to do praise god and so it falls like rain the bible says and that's what the former rain is the former rain is just this refreshing of ah now i know how to live my life now i know what to do praise god now i know how to put god first and seek the kingdom of god first and everything else will be added to me amen so brother man says now brother answers the mechanics there are waiting on the dynamics that'll take her in the rapture uh we don't know how right now this is before he said thus saith the lord with joel 2 23 but he's the dynamics the dynamics of the church will be a refilling of the holy spirit which we've worked in a small measure while the headstone's coming down so if you're already born again at the time of the rapture you'll get a refilling in your human spirit if like our children and some of the ones that maybe aren't born again adults they'll get the real baptism of the holy ghost in their souls at that time amen praise god it has to be because they got to have oil in order to go out to meet the bridegroom praise god amen hallelujah it has to be so that's what we can see from the scripture now like you said but said we're looking for another surge of the holy spirit we saw that on wednesday he said from the token 64. i'm sorry 63. another surge for a rapturing faith so brother i'm clearly taught we're looking for this rapturing faith now we close the service by showing how the raptures of revelation and it struck me later that all god wants us to do is have as much faith as we can right and i gave the example of who is dead and bang's dad being healed i didn't know we didn't know for sure if god was going to do it but we took the little mustard seed we had brother bang and we acted on that mustard seed we spoke the word we did a prayer cloth we just whatever we got and he said if you just got a grain he said you'll move the mountains amen i didn't hear you praise god and i still didn't even know that god was going to do it as far as i didn't know he was going to do it but i was acting upon all the faith that i had i knew he could do it amen amen so we apply that like look with amen's healing from this week and our sister's testimony you know about speaking in tongues and asking god for these things we just got to be patient praise god ask god and if it's god's will god will do it and just serve god with as much faith as we have praise god cling to every ounce of faith that we have and god will give us the revelation for the hour that we need it praise god amen now i'm going to go past my review because i don't want to i don't want to spend too much time on the review now i want to um look here at a few things now you know it's thus saith the lord we have to return to pentecost we have to and uh now i want to look at this scripture i've never preached this before because i've been listening you know different sermons and yesterday i was listening to once more lord beautiful message from brother branham uh about samson uh beautiful but brother and makes his statement time and time again how we are in between two revivals how many know that the last revival was the healing revival started in 1946 so that world war ii ended 1945 the next year the holy spirit commissioned brother branham to go around the world and preach a few months after him uh billy graham started but he didn't get famous until 1949 when he preached in new york city and then uh uh oral roberts started in 1947 after seeing brother branham preach and that's why i brought this i bought this dictionary it's a pentecostal dictionary now they say brother branham was a true gifted uh to pray for the sick but he got off on his doctrine now everybody says that because they don't want to obey the word but we know he's a true prophet um anyways when you go to his name branham it says the initiator of the post-world war ii healing revival so this man that all these men that wrote it there's three three men there that wrote they don't even believe brother bran's the prophet they don't even believe that he teaches right doctrine yet they all have to recognize that god started a revival in brother man's ministry they all have to recognize it and they even show brother man's picture the pillar of fire they say this is perhaps the most famous picture in the post-war healing revival and it is because that's our god that's jesus right there praise god that's the holy spirit and uh i want to just read to you again a few things here they clearly say uh the the person universally acknowledged as the revival's father and pacesetter was william branham the sudden appearance of his miraculous healing campaigns in 1946 set off a spiritual explosion in the pentecostal movement which was to move to main street usa by the 1950s and give birth to the broader charismatic movement in the 1960s which currently affects almost every denomination in the country so they can recognize and then they say the second they call brother branham the first giant of the healing revival they say the second giant of the post-war healing revival was oral roberts so anyone with any spiritual understanding at all they can recognize a revival started in 1946 praise god and then brother branham gets towards the end of his ministry in 63 and he says that now that started a national revival it was a worldwide in fact national and then worldwide healing revival now say like this there's still that going on right here praise god amen but as far as a nationwide and worldwide it's not on anymore that part has died but i do believe it's worldwide it's still going from church to church in south america right africa we're hearing you know over the years we hear different testimonies about missionaries having great success in different countries so the revival is still going on in a small way but the national revival stopped and even educated men that went to seminary can all recognize god started something in brother branham's ministry praise god now i want to show this here if you've got your bibles here brother branham tells this now this is i never preached on this before the first time i ever preached on this and it was through brother amen's conversation and through the sermons i've been listening to there really are we are right now in the middle between revivals praise god amen the man says it you know and there's even scripture and these are the scriptures brother branham uses so let's go to mark 4 35 please i'm just going to try to not go rush i'm not going to try to rush today yep and we don't have any testimony signed up so that must mean i'm supposed to preach a little longer today mark 4 35. now this is jesus stealing the storm right crossing the sea and stealing the storm now who would have thought this scripture applied to 2020 or 1963 when brother anne preaches who would have thought i would have never thought right but church i think we're learning as time goes on that this whole bible speaks to jesus and his bride amen yeah as i speak to the jews but as time goes on we're finding more and more scripture applies to us so in this scripture mark 4 35 let me get back there sorry i closed my bible like 4 35 jesus crossing the sea here now it says and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over and to the other side now this is right after their last revival they'd had in the previous city verse 36 and when they sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they wake him and said him master carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and he said them why are ye so fearful how is it that ye have no faith and they fear it exceedingly it said one to another what manner man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him what a scripture brother adam says our day is seen in this scripture notice they were adam they had a multitude of people brother ram calls it a revival they leave the revival and church they're headed to a revival if you go to the next chapter chapter five the maniac of gabra and you know after that after he got delivered the whole city was in an uproar of revival so brotherhood says right now we are in between the two revivals amen now let me read the quotes uh i'm sorry i probably should have chose a better font it's kind of hard to read talk about amazing race how sweet this sound what a securities how secure we feel to know that when we're driving on the highways whatever we're doing that jesus lays in the ship now he ain't talking about your car he's talking about your soul praise god he's talking about the ship of your body praise god he said what a comfort calling jesus on the scene after the seals amen the one who can perform any miracle can do anything that he once done now see it's got to be what he wants done not what we want done amen unless we can now we got to get our will lined up with his will that's when we see the results doing it again perfectly identifying himself he is in our little boat as we're sailing life's solemn maine same as he was then so he is now what a feeling of security now this whole world is in chaos arguing and political unrest and and riots and uh major cities not like in our city thank god thank god it's not in our city i thank the lord for that i believe god has protected our city that's just my because i've signed and cried for the abominations in this city amen that just struck me i didn't think about that but i've been praying for this city praise god what a feeling of security that's one thing we've got security in christ jesus amen he said what a feeling while sailing the troubled lives waters of life when this mel johnson the abel singer the little swede saying when i cross over the river of jordan just think when you come down there to the river he'll be there i'll not leave you nor forsake you what a promise sailing these troubled waters aren't you glad jesus is right there praise god hallelujah look what he says they were something like us today he's talking about the disciples in the ship those disciples out there on that ship that night after the revival was feasting on the results now maybe now look there's that word maybe right like ben and i've been talking about the foolish virgin perhaps you know they'll be saved just by being good to the brother perhaps right these maybes now maybe between the revivals now we're looking for another stir where there has to be something happen now that will gather the church together so brother says it's like we're like in the ship and we're between revivals and we're looking for another stir praise god there will have to come some kind of a press sound familiar squeeze yes press squeeze it together god always does it that way to run his people together amen he always does the church he's always got to send trouble to get us to all come together more closely amen i believe that's already being formed that will shut out everything that won't agree with them he's talking about the mark of the beast and then it's going to run the church together and we're waiting for that to happen and we're living on the results of the great revival that we've just passed and he's resting now let me show this i know different message churches that won't have any fellowship yet they both claim they got the holy ghost all because one church kind of preached on the other one now church the sad part was the pastors never even talked about it they just go on their internet now which is okay to have internet services but they just bash each other back and forth now that should not be you can see miracles in both churches you can see the holy spirit godly lives holy lives but see we're not quite together right so god's got to do something to get us back together amen and brother man said i have a quote i don't have it this morning but i can look it up for you brother rahm said thus saith the lord he said god will will bring all the church together and cause him to leave all their denominational differences and fusses before the rapture he said it's thus saith the lord so don't be discouraged you know message churches fight and bicker you know they're just going to do that thank god you know as far as i know we're not bickering with anybody as far as i know now i'm trying to bring cracks into churches and i'm sure a lot of people don't like me very much and that's okay because i'm saying on god's word but i want to do it with the love of god and the thing is i've reached out to them i've offered to talk to them i've sent them letters and they still won't call me so what would you do i just keep trying to be loving praise god i said let's talk let's let's meet they don't want to do that they'd just rather write back and disagree that's fine but but see god always has to do that he has to let some persecution come in order to drive the people together that's what i i noticed too sometimes i get a little loose in my life right but then god allows somebody to criticize me it'll drive me to my knees right or you got a little struggle a little low on the finances or you got got some pain you got sick what does it always do drives you to prayer drives you back into fellowship with god amen and so church this is what we see here we see uh brother graham using this in this beautiful i never really thought about this before he said we're in between revivals looking for another stir here's the next quote now we wonder why revival is not going on right now we don't know why we don't see the enthusiasm with the people i don't know why but let's just think what it's like this maybe there's a little boy here tonight a little girl was born over in seattle washington now that book holds her name he's talking about the lamb's book of life he he come to redeem whose name was on that book reading means bring back from where it fell from and the human race she was fell and she can't accept it now she's too young so the church will slug along you ever seen a slug i opened up my door the other day i got slugs on my door because it was a humid day i noticed that on humid days there's slugs that climb on my car doors you ever seen them before am i the only one that's got slugs i might be the only one that has slugs my children see them right we see them around the house so look what i'm saying he said the church has got to kind of slug around right i'll say like this just kind of carry on the waves because we're in the we're in the boat praise god we got jesus in our boat praise god we got the real holy ghost in our boat amen thank god amen but we're just kind of slugging around the waves back and forth and you know just going sailing live silent maine probably said we just got to keep slugging along just playing along we'll have the meetings and so forth until that last person is brought in then the book is closed there's no more added then it's all over now church you and i want the rapture to happen right but what if uh just what if you've got a young one i've got eight young ones see so i like to i like the lord of terry a little longer or if he like amen i were talking or he could give him the holy ghost right before the rapture no matter what age they are as long as they repent you know and serve god as long as they're a little old enough but see so and in church let me say like this you know the reasons we'll go over tonight some of the reasons i don't believe the rapture can happen this year is because the the world hasn't heard the message the whole world hasn't heard the message when we were there voice of god it wasn't i think it was the first time jose and i went they told us that woman at the desk told us that the message has not been translated in every language yet they're still in need of translators in other words there are people that have never heard about jesus christ and the water baptism in the name of jesus christ in their language and so god is patient praise god and god's going to raise up he's going to anoint missionaries he's going to anoint translators glory and jesus said pray that the god that the lord of the harvest will send laborers into the harvest amen that's one thing we can do we can pray that god will break this covet fear because that's what it is fear and send forth the missionaries now i'm just going to add this real quick 4 000 people have died in ohio from coven that is i looked up the other day it's it's not even it's not even a thousandths of one percent of this of this pandemic i mean it's hard to imagine how small this really is so if you had one percent one one out of a hundred if you had one percent and then break that one percent into a thousand that's how many people are dying from coburn it's hard to imagine remember 60 percent of europe died in the black plague and we're not we're at a thousandth of one percent this is no this is no black plague did you and i remember i appreciate on uh wednesday the church is out in california i saw they won their legal battle so they can have church today because they took those numbers their numbers are actually better than ours right now at least in that part of california they're they're at like 99.9997 uh percent of people don't get covered and don't die and we're at like 99.9996 and so they won they won the court case this week in that church i think it's john macarthur church he's a denominational guy pretty good teacher pretty solid except he don't believe in the supernatural that's a real bad problem oh baby god is merciful but anyways you see it's it's just crazy what this world is doing so here you know they're trying to get the people to give up their rights what the bible says they want a worldwide economy right the bible said they want a worldwide religion because every so there that we know it the one world religion one world economy we know that's where it's moving and they're testing it out right they used covid to test it out it was china china sent it out and i don't know if china was responsible or russian people in china i don't know but it came out of china and they're trying to use that to just test the world and see what they'll give up and see they're trying to they start out west to try to get the churches to be so fearful they don't even come to church but church see we've got to come to church and gather more as we see that day approaching praise god we'll keep their 10 person limit for a few weeks but then when we see that there's no problem and there's nothing to fear and it's not going to strike us or anything like that then we're back with faith and we're back praising god and it's like it never happened right because we're here to praise god we're here to hear the word of god and we won't let anything distract us from serving jesus christ you see slug along gotta keep slugging along every now and then we'll see great little testimonies right like he's we'll see a few people saved here now in bed but we're just slugging along waiting for that last name praise god now look at this then jesus came and called until when to that time will be none of us know but let's just keep doing all we can to his glory until that time is over this is the continuation of the previous quote just slug along just keep having services revivals you know in your own self till time is over we don't know who that person is it may already be in we're just waiting is coming we do not know and it'll never be revealed to man the time of his coming because not even the angels of heaven know when it's going to be but we're just looking for any time waiting watching for his coming praise god now look here's where i mentioned this revival earlier look what he says in 65 when the message first started out of course everybody was praying for the sick great signs wonders and miracles that started especially in the pentecostal people a universal revival of a healing campaigns that swept the world for 15 years solid there's been revivals on every hill i suppose revival fires are burning literally millions have accepted christ as their savior by that one commission that inspired from there to oral roberts and so forth and on and on as it's went around i'm so glad our prophet agrees with the history because it shows that history is right because it agrees with the prophet they both agree praise god and let me say it like this you know bangs bang's former pastor went out west to a a a healing revival in the pentecostal churches and his wife got healed he told me that testimony when we were there celebrating your your dad's healing i mean this is still this healing revival is still going on like his wife that pastor's wife was healed of a kidney problem she was going to have to have kidney dialysis and she just heard the preaching of divine healing where'd that start out of our prophet's ministry amen the denominations are still being blessed because of god's prophet and so are we amen he's being healed and delivered and given signs and vindications and wonders god is still moving because of this revival praise god amen it's amazing to think about that that this revival from 46 was worldwide now it's really gone down it's really gone down but it's still going it started through our profit and that but now we're in between it's not a big multitude anymore now we're just in between they're raising see they're calling jesus they're waking jesus oh thank god bye and after the pentecostal church is laying its dead slope now see the denominations have died but there's little revival still going on when people get healed my intention the desire tonight is to awaken that church again to the coming of the lord jesus i have to rebuke it i have to rebuke sin and whatever man it is i don't mean it to anybody's denomination i have a message i'm glad i get to preach the same message now back to luke now go back to well you don't have to go back to luke i want to watch my time but i just said i don't have to watch my time forgive me now notice he says is your life worth the gospel this is the first sermon i ever listened to from brother branham brother dave lewellen gave me this tape a cassette tape that was back in the day before there was even cds i think he said did you notice in luke 14 there was three poles or three turns of it when they went out first and to call them that were bitten to come they didn't do it so there went out a healing campaign went out to get the blind and the heart and still there were room so he went out and compelled the good bad and different they should come in now this is powerful to me brother johnny i've never seen it like this i've heard this quote before but i've never seen it like this all of these scriptures can apply to us crossing the sea can apply because we're in between revivals now only god could do that praise god because you know it doesn't say anything about a rapture there does it you know jesus on the sea call and here this this doesn't say anything about the rapture right but it's a parable jesus tells and yet brother ran by the holy spirit can look down into the scripture and probably by vision can see how it applies to us today so let's go to i'm going to go to luke 14. if you've got your bible you can luke 14 16. this will kind of refresh you on the parable and this was like the whole point of my message was just i was i'm so shocked uh to see how almost every type in the bible is about the rapture or the bride or israel returning which happens right after the rapture i mean it's it's it's god did that to give us many infallible proofs that we're living the right word he's with us he's in the boat and we just got to stir him up praise god amen amen luke 14 16. this is the parable of the great supper now of course this supper represents the marriage supper of the lamb but it doesn't say that specifically right so you have to have a spiritual mind hallelujah in other words you have to be familiar with revelation 19 right give honor and be glad for the marriage of the bride has come and his wife has made herself ready amen verse 16. no i'm sorry yeah verse 16. luke 14 16. then he said to them a certain man made a great supper and made many and he said his servant at suppertime to say to them that we're bid and come for all things are now ready and they all with one excuse i'm sorry one consent began to make excuse the first of them i bought a piece of ground and it must needs and go see it i pray thee have me excuse imagine that turning down the rapture for property in other words turning down church in other words they didn't want to come hear the message turning down the message for more property you'd be surprised how many people do that next excuse verse 19. another said i bought five yoke of oxen and i approve them i pray thee have me excuse look how nice they are pray thee please pardon me they're so respectful to the servants of the lord and now it's about working and and breaking up the land so they can plant they've got they've got planting to do verse 20. another said i've married a wife and therefore i cannot come relationships get in the way oftentimes don't let any relationship get you away from serving jesus christ verse 21 now brother answers this now is his healing ministry this is amazing it's amazing just like jesus in the ship right between revivals here's brother i said three polls verse 21 so that servant came and showed his lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly in the streets and the lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the main and the hot and the blind and the servant said lord it is done as thou as commanded and yet there is room now look at this brother ram tells us he says this is what is happening in his day because they turned it down flat imagine that might have been the the people that denominated after azusa street remember that was a genuine revival they got the genuine gifts of the holy spirit operating but then many of them denominated i think the oneness church denominated in 1919 if my history it would be in there but if my his if my memory serves me correct they saw so right after azusa street 1906 those saints got so into the word they saw jesus as not three those those two dissolved and he became one praise god and many of them baptized but because they got pressure from the nominations they created their own denomination and it showed they went off in the wrong spirit and that's why god had to raise up brother branham for a healing revival they turned it down the man said they wanted to protect their revelation say we've got it and nobody else got it you got to be a part of our church or you're not you're not you're not saved or something like that but brother adam says he says so there went out a healing campaign out to get the halt and the blind he said so they don't come to the spiritual feast that they're invited to do you believe that god has given america invitation the last 15 years to a great revival a spiritual feast did they come no sir then to reject to come is that life worthy of the gospel though they call themselves that no so you know all the miracles of brother branham were to get the people to look and see a sign but then to hang around and hear the voice of the sign right that's the whole point of it that's why perry green he saw those miracles at bischo they saw the miracles but they said something stirred in them they didn't realize there was a prophet till a little later and then they realized oh well he's got a message he's directing us to the bible brother ed biscuit i saw his testimony he had questions about serpent seed all these things he wrote him out and brother branham answered all of them in a conversation and then he was convinced it's the word so in other words he said yes i'll come to the feast praise god amen hallelujah but many people even after the lame haul and blind were healed many people didn't come there was still room thank god there was still room praise god thank god there was room for you and i amen hallelujah it's a spiritual feast sister brother it's a spiritual feast today we might be in the boat but we must have some real good dried goods amen there must be some real dried foods here fruits and veggies my uh dried meats oh must be a great feast right here in the boat praise god right here on the ship but notice church there's one more call verse 23 the lord said to the servants go out into the highways now look at this missionary work oh this is this is revelation 10 right here go into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled amen in other words go out to the very outer realms of the kingdom that's what revelation 10 11 says go prophesy again to every kinder nation tongue and people oh look at that ah i didn't even see that till now look at that we are living in between revivals amen as far as huge revivals we're living in between but we still got jesus amen church doesn't he show up when you need him praise god that's when you wake up when you shake him say don't you care if i perish doesn't he wake up we ought to praise god for that amen he's still in the ship hallelujah when we need him he's always there praise god he's my comfort and stay my hope and peace my righteousness amen he's my all in all just got to stir him up oh just got to stir up the lord in our hearts wake up jesus don't you care that we perish of course he cares but look what he says he said i want to see your face i want to see you take that mustard seed of faith oh thank you love bye this is awesome i've never seen it like that before oh i mean with this you know most some denominations may read this parable today do you think they're seeing rapture in here do you think they're seeing healing revival worldwide healing revival that even doctors of divinity have to attest to they can't deny it it's so great because it's in the word and somebody's got to receive it somebody's got to accept it somebody's got to fulfill it praise god so our ministry is to compel people come in before the doors close come into this great supper our duty is compelling praise god amen our duty is to compel let me look that word up real quick here just give me a second here while you're there samson we'll get to samson here next by god's grace just give me a second here this just takes a second compel means to necessitate to drive someone to whether by force now we don't use force threats we don't use threats we use warnings or by permission and treaties or by other means in other words do as much as we can to try to influence people come to the word of god come the word of god that's our ministry how do we believe that's your ministry today how can we compel how can we invite people to come to church how can we invite people to to watch a video about god or or how can we how can we compel anybody to be more interested in god amen that's our ministry today praise the lord now samson found himself in between revival so now brother man uses jesus in the boat sleeping in the boat as between revivals and now brother brown uses samson between revivals his first revival was while he had his seven locks of hair the next revival comes when the seven locks grow out praise god there's got to be somebody who's afresh are you the fresh growth or not i believe in i'm part of that seven lac growth i'm a part of that fresh uh group of hair that fresh glory amen i'm a part of that revival group amen now samson thought of his great days when there was great days the church tonight is thinking back about 15 years ago to revival divine healing of the victory now isn't that what a lot of churches we have to be careful not to just use brother random's testimonies that's why you hear me use bang and who is that all the time now a few months ago i was using tanya's healing aaron's here remember when aaron got healed remember when time he got healed she couldn't raise her arm and we prayed for her she went home and she raised her arm and it just was healed right there different ones remember when marie got healed over that other sanctuary she was bleeding prayed for her and she said it instantly stopped right as i prayed for her amen praise god what are we trying to do just remember see we're trying to live in this day we're trying we're trying to see jesus today thank god for what he did but we really want to see him today as well praise god now you can use the old testimonies oh god did it for brother brahma he can do it today but bring that testimony to today praise god don't just talk about brother branham and have no faith to act upon your mustard seed there i'm scared to speak the word just whatever you got use it because if that if all you can do is just bow your head and say a whisper prayer then you do it use anything you got praise god use all the faith you got just call jesus on the scene wake him up let's have faith in god amen amen compel them keep doing now to keep reminding us of all the testimonies god has done among us right we have to do that we have to remember that jesus christ is here right now right and that ought to make you maybe sit up and lean forward a little bit or something like that right he's here in other words someone might need prayer at the end of service and i don't want to be in a backseating condition while we pray for them right because i might be like aiken and hinder somebody's victory you understand what i mean that's why we ought to always be on our toes we always got to be spiritually alert so we keep the army of god slugging along slugging along victory after victory slugging along just uh floating along solemn main keeping the victory on our way to the next revival praise god amen that rapture revival what a revival that's going to be glory now i know it's a lot sitting in this room this afternoon you brought this to my memory the man's praying uh at the end of his sermon preaching on samson this great man that once lived for you and the condition he got in now father as samson was willing to die die out to himself die with his enemy to bring god's victory and the promise back may we so as samson died let's all say we ready we oh you mean you can learn from samson oh yeah i can learn from samson's death yeah we with all of our church entity that's what we don't want here but listen that's why we got a battle right we all got a battle we all got a battle church entity you know how you're going to overcome it christianity hallelujah the kingdom of god amen the real christian experience will overcome church entity he's got to shake he's got to shake jesus wake him up may we with all the church entity and all of our difference i don't like that i don't like that preacher i don't like that singer i'm tired of them i just don't want to do it die out to our own thinking and accept your word die out to the thoughts that we've been told the days of miracles has passed when we know that that jesus is the same yesterday the day and forever grant lord that this audience will see the moving of the hand of god once more and then they may come and repent and there be a great meeting and may from this little church i like this go forth a revival that will slay the philistines of worldliness throughout the country that's the philistine god wants to destroy today worldly habits praise god worldly thinking worldly church a church entity experience that's the spill scenes that god wants to say today and we'll do it by the power of god's word amen may we have a revival and it'll slay all the worldliness throughout the country this is oh right before the seals just a minute here let's look at this one here lord jesus master of great master of life the shepherd of the sheep come forth lord these people are hungry and they're thirsty lord years i've wanted to see this happen now look he preached that that was 17 years before my birthday i like that that's why it's one of my favorite sermons it was preaching my birthday 17 years before though he said lord i want to see this happen maybe it will just once more lord one more great move in the spirit one more time lord and the church might receive the rapturing faith to go in so when brother brandon preached samson his objective was to say listen you need to revive in your own life but there's going to come a greater revival the bride's revival praise god rapturing faith because he was between revivals and he just had to remember that he had that covenant we just got to remember that we've got the blood of jesus covering all of our sins amen and eternal love amen and eternal mercy favor with god we have his covenant we have his promise he's unfailing he cannot fail his grace is sufficient his mercies are new every morning amen we've got his covenant so now we see two scriptural witnesses three where you see them between revivals but they still got access to jesus wake him up wake him up remember you may not remember this bill graham brother ram noticed the spiritual drive he noticed the revival calming down even amongst message believers he says this he says and us is out in arizona i use this numerous times i see we're drying we sit here i get amongst my brethren they talk with me uh he said i i always i watch them feeling out there with the spirit to see what's wrong with the people i begin to see us all reclining getting away from the spirit even brother branham right this is three weeks before he died he's seeing the people get further away from god the revival dying down jesus sleeping on the boat he said but what do we need he said we must worship in the spirit we must wake up the holy spirit amen it's got to be in our hearts or we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself and i'm trusting and believing in every one of you to be a real real christian now i forgot to read this part brother brahm said if you feel like i do i'm so hungry to see the spirit of god moving i just can't hardly stand it some experiences i had up in the mountain just to feel that once again that something that when i was first saved was so glorious to my heart see he wanted to feel that the initial revival again he wanted to feel he wanted to feel fresh amen amen and he prayed for it now but look in his last sermon that's a good point brother man's last sermon communion look what he says you know the hour will soon arise when right among us the holy spirit will speak out like it did in ananias and sapphira remember that hour is arriving now church we've seen this in a minor level here someone was criticizing me a few years ago i went in prayer to their seat and i rebuked that critical spirit in the name of jesus christ and then the following sunday the brother brian came in and preached it and told that person to leave and they left ananias and sapphira was the holy spirit discerning the wrong spirit and packing it out of the church so see what this is in a minor way in a minor way this is returning praise god there's going to be a pure word bride amen where she just believes the word amen amen just the word and any spirit contrary will be driven out by the holy spirit you don't you probably don't remember this if you do you got a great memory tim hayton came to our church around 2013 2014 it's been a long time i don't know if you remember he just gotten back from a trip to africa and he said he visited numerous churches he said they went out i forget which country was in africa but they went out into some country churches and he said the brothers he said he watched as the pastor they were all praying before the service before the church even service started and uh the one of the uh members uh called out somebody's sin thus saith the lord someone was committing adultery in the church called out right there where the people were sitting there and the person had to repent i mean so that proves this can happen praise god but the people got to be in tune with the holy spirit praise god see look brother i'm expecting this to return this is the fullness of pentecost amen we mostly think about miracles but but see god is going to be purifying the bride as well praise god the fullness of pentecost was also purity right and all the unbelief and all the sin cleaned out she's got to be washed in the waters of the word amen oh i love it it's arriving here's what i want to also share as well now you're saying about revival brother man you know why you're doing that so i was going to preach it now see brother also says so the the world the national revival from 1946 has died down but there's still revival fires burning now this is a long quote this is a lot here okay bro let's talk about when the holy ghost comes into you he says we've already resurrected dynamics and mechanics has gone to work quicken us and we're quickened up in the presence of god where his spirit is we're see together in heavenly places he says uh the bride she'll do exactly what's predicted for her she won't be a laodicean not by no means a lukewarm but she'll be on fire for god amen she'll be moving on in the spirit praise god that's what i want to do i want to stay close to the holy spirit so the holy spirit can show me new things it can help me grow for praying for the sick or speaking the word or preaching the gospel i want to stay close to the holy spirit stay on fire so i don't get lukewarm so i can keep compelling people come to the rapture come to the message amen i want to keep compelling you too praise god you want to compel people that's our duty that's our ministry this hour compel them to come here's the uh yeah here's what i like he's praying this is uh february 65. he's praying at the end of a service he said lord there in your hands altar call oh god we don't want our understanding we want your understanding somebody would say amen to that amen give them to us lord and may the revival here's what i love come within our souls amen that's the greatest revival we can have amen because it changes our nature we don't have an unbelief nature we have a nature of belief so when we have our mind battles we just got to pray and the power of the holy spirit our soul works its way out to our minds and then we get the victory in our minds and then we get victory over the flesh and we can bring these bodies into subjection to the word of god amen till this pack of people will just one heart and one accord granted father grant these things while we pray in jesus christ's name see brother and believe in revival today in your soul next thinking man's filter jesus cried blind pharisees the holy spirit in the heart tonight christ blind laodicea how oft god would give you revival but now your time has come it's too late now it's all about laodicea oh united states that god would have hovered you as a hand desert brood but you would not now this voice is going from coast to coast north to south east to west how god would have hovered you but you would not now your time has come now look this is what this is his prayer i love this lord hide me in the rock of ages god let me let me breathe upon me lord spear living god breathe on me take let me take god's filter and live under that lord let me breathe the fresh air of the holy ghost into my lungs in my soul each day that i what i sin not against you o lord breathe on me holy spirit breathe on me this is the revival they turned down the revival is a daily revival praise god in the soul where we learn not to sin against god but to obey god amen oh it's glorious trying to close here this is what the whole thing that inspired me after talking with brother amen and i'm just going to do a couple services on this night lord willing i think the the chapter i wrote chapter four about about the revelation of the church as the bride i think i'll pick it up on that later because it ties perfectly in you'll see because every woman can type the bride somehow right she either types israel mother harlot or the bride us i mean every woman you know just start with eve you know pretty soon every woman that's what brother ram said and he's talking about the seventh seal when the seventh seal opened there was silence uh brotherham says the seventh seal was the coming of the lord the rapture so the literal opening of the seventh seal the reality opening of the seventh seal will be the rapture because that's the final mystery praise god and then that just opens it up and then everything else just that's what we're waiting on that final mystery of the seventh seal the reality opening he said even the son himself don't know what's gonna happen god has all this to himself it's a secret that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space half an hour he said the seven thunders under their voices john was even forbidden to write see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't now here's what struck me this quote came to me last sunday he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible what the seventh seal the rapture the rapture second coming of jesus christ is in every type in the bible almost yeah almost therefore the bible is the entire i'm sorry the revelation of god's mystery in christ huh the entire bible is an expression of one goal god had one purpose he wanted to achieve an entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in time and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last days reviewed it and shows it and god's help you'll see it right here this morning when the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it now you know the threefold purpose we've been over this numerous times you probably heard other preachers preach it brother brahm said god's purpose was to get preeminence in the sun that is bride and restore eden god so brother says all types either point to christ the bride or restoring the new jerusalem amen which is israel right israel is a part of this too right israel gets 144 000 and then the millennial temple and then the new jerusalem it's all part of that together now i don't i just had just a brief moment to write down we see the rapture in the entire bible enoch abraham and sarah but ram said that was the rapture that was the last sign when god uh revealed the secret of sarah's heart that was brother ram's son of man ministry the last sign before the rapture thus saith the lord that means isaac's birth was the rapture whoever would have found that none of us would have found that unless god brought it with us saith the lord at least or rebecca praise god joseph revealing himself remember he put his wife out and the marriage supper before he went to the 144 000. he said honey i'm putting you in heaven as i reveal myself to my 144 000 down here on earth oh my glory the token the death angel which is of course the third exodus now i'm not going to go through all these rahab in the token which again is an exodus it's an exodus type because remember church this even even moses bringing israel that all everything in there can't be tied to the rapture because remember a mixed multitude came out does that type are there gonna be mixed people going the rapture that aren't born again no sir they gotta have oil so see church everybody understand we gotta be real careful with quotes and types right you gotta be really careful with types see so we have to apply that type the mixed multitude we have to apply that type to your earthly exodus right like anyone was thinking about leaving egypt remember that that's your that's getting saved so some people think they're getting saved when they still love egypt right they just left out because they saw somebody under the real token and then of course they run to the token as well but they weren't themselves really believers so see you've got to be careful with the types ray having the token uh before gentile destruction there's going to be a gentile bride who's saved from the destruction of the city praise god by the red cord of the token the blood of jesus amen and then samson's once more lord like i said i didn't devote much time to this i was doing the other quote studies on the boat and then samson and then the three calls uh to the marriage supper and we'll get to that we see the rapture the entire bible that's what you know i had to limit chapter four it was so long brother johnny because i could have wrote about almost every woman in the bible as hell as a type of christ almost almost every woman right brother ram said eve represented the early church she was engaged to christ but she fell but she got redeemed see praise god i mean we we can see live you can use all of these and they're all to point us to one thing it's all coming to jesus christ amen he's the headstone he's the capstone coming down from heaven amen and everything will be gathered up into christ this means there's much scripture being fulfilled right now now i made this years ago do you remember this anybody remember that brother ram said it's you know i've heard preachers over the years it's lamp trimming time it is matthew 25 right the bright the wise version it's lamb trimming time it's malachi 4 time yeah my heart needs restored to the pentecostal saints it's uniting time it is the world's uniting to antichrist we're uniting the word christ the moves on the bride it's that time yeah it's walking with god it's enoch time it's like everything is our time everything in the bible is pointing to us what we should be doing now falling more in love with jesus right trimming our limbs walking with god being the friend of god loving god being a faithful bride to jesus laying in the friends of the son that's matthew 13 the parables right the tear doesn't bow the wheat bows and lays in the presence of the son jesus said this type is for the end time the end of the world every times point does oh i say like almost every type is pointing to us oh this blew my mind these last few days i think you know why it makes me nervous because like i'm a person i want to get everything about a subject i want all the quotes on marriage and divorce and i got them too well most of them i'm in all the quotes on the rapture now brother amen when i seen all this now i don't have all the quotes on the rapture now i don't have all the scriptures on the rapture and it makes me nervous i start shaking in my uh my knees get a little wobbly like oh i feel like i'm unprepared like i don't really know it but i also have grace and know that god in god's appointed time he'll reveal it even then praise god amen i'm that kind i want to have a document i don't have a that has all the quotes and all the scriptures takes away all doubt but this just shook me up a little bit like wow now i got to use jesus in the boat i got to use sansom samson i got to use the marriage parable and you can but it's glorious to us isn't it it's glorious to us to us now here's one i just i'm trying to close here let me set timer 10 minutes thanks for putting up with me church i appreciate it i didn't preach last week so i kind of been ready to go thanks for being merciful to me now we know right noah types the foolish virgin let me skip ahead like here's a few things noah usually types the foolish virgin right and there's quotes on that i don't have them here but it'd be very easy to show you look just listen to the seals the man talks about it numerous times because enoch types the wise version right now look i was looking at my my timeline brother johnny where are we talking about the timeline enoch was raptured 987 years after sin entered the world so after the sin the garden he was raptured about night about a thousand years after that adam lived uh 930 years so enoch outlived adam by 57 years that means enoch could have fellowship with adam for over 308 years can you imagine the fellowship they could have had don't you think that raised enoch's faith a little bit the first i'm talking with the first adam i mean all the world around him is like oh you're you're you're a holy roller thinking there's a rapture you're a but he's like talking to the original adam you saw the pillar of fire the pillar of fire came down to talk to you he's like yes he did yes and he probably started crying i failed god's grace look at all this but enoch's like no there's a purpose adam there's a purpose be encouraged like we all need encouragement right for our mistakes 308 years so enoch was born when adam was a young 600 healthy 622 years old now isn't it interesting adam went off the earth 9 30 right so god god had the first adam die right god took that first man he left in other words he let the first man die and then just 57 years later he took the first man to heaven by rapture praise god the first man died but god said i'm going to redeem him by taking another man straight to heaven and i'm going to defeat death amen they just seen the first adam die but then they showed god showed i'm gonna allow man to cheat death and not die through enoch's type and that types you and i the seventh from ian adam praise god the seventh church age praise god the seven locks ahead right then it ties amen if we can just see it and just believe it praise god well i was pretty excited about that this morning i don't know about you but that that really did something for me this morning yeah we have to be careful how we use types and quotes so just a couple more things so how many know brother or how many how many don't know as a foolish virgin type well there is an aspect where you can use him for the bride because brother abraham said noah's ark types you getting into christ brother jesse don't preach to me about noah and i don't think anybody says that don't preach to me about noah he's the foolish version well brother branham said noah can type jesus christ just depends how you use it right look what he says next brother is preaching the token the first time he preached token remember he said this is one of the highlights of his entire ministry and all outside of that ark perish all outside the token the blood perish everyone everyone outside the token of the holy ghost will perish no matter how good how much church members there's a lot of them in days of noah there was a lot of them in the days of moses but a man that failed to apply the blood as the as the token was he perished those who failed to get into the ark perish those who fail to come into christ for he is the ark i can use noah and i can use him it's a type of the bride get in the ark before the door closes get into jesus christ get born again praise god but does he overall type the bride no but you can use now look you can i said it's in every type of the bible oh it's glorious hallelujah so i can still use noah for us today which means forget all the the marrying and eating and drinking right the world forget all those things build a life amen build an escape let your testimony build or let your life build a testimony that you can enter into that testimony and you can be safe in christ when the storms come praise god oh hallelujah thank you jesus so see if someone says don't preach to me about no that's foolish virgins say well there is a type for that there is a die for that and then he says see the song we were saying this morning by one spirit we're all baptized into one body the token is the door for you are in christ now last thing i want to bring this out before we close see there's a lot of people that will cling to a quote like this one brother branham says this isn't the third seal they'll say let's say the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival here no manifestation of god disturbed the bride yet we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it now watch she was dead now this was true when he said it the bride hadn't been awakened because the book had not been opened yet right the sevens of the book was still sealed how could she have a revival she couldn't hear the voices of those seals which which took her back to all the word of god revealed every mystery and but people will just they'll hang on this and say the bride hasn't had a revival and yet brother ram later says she has had a revival see be careful brother later taught the thunders were revealed so see they'll use this quote and say we don't know the seven thunders but brother ram said the thunders are fulfilled they're already revealed they're the revelations of the seven seals right but they'll hang on that quote see they gotta take it back to the word or they'll say or they don't know brother ram later said the bride was awakened see remember look he says she needs the thunders to wake her up and they'll say see the bride's still sleeping i'm not sleeping i'm not sleeping i see what's going on in this world i'm awake i'm a child of the light praise god i've heard the shout brother man praise god i'm trimming my lamp i make sure i got the extra oil i'm ready to go out to meet the bridegroom i'm not sleeping i'm awake amen amen look at brother says they said brother bran well then seven thunders you see wouldn't them seven thunders blasting out won't that be a revelation give to some man i said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it see they were trying to tell brother and write your own bible like they did joseph smith brother man said no the revelation of the seven thunders have to be in the bible and it's all revealed in there then the seven and the seven seals opened up the revelation of what that was that's what it was see it's still in the word oh i'm so glad it's in the word you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word but god's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word by blinding some and opening the eyes of others it'll always do that the man in the church age book says his ministry is going to do two things turn the hearts and then reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals hallelujah now this is a long one brother adam says in recognizing your day my last quote let's stand here let's get you standing here i appreciate your patience well the man said the denominations are saying fast and pray there's a uh he said we're going to have a great breaking of the day there's a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray pray he said we're not too late yet remember this quote all the denominations are saying we're going to have a new day we're going to have a break-in of the day and brother man says why do they do that why do they do that they want a great awakening they're crying believing that there will be an awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride see in 63 said they're not awake yet but now he says they they're fasting and praying but they haven't recognized the bride is awake now she's awake and i remember i show you those quotes we have revival in our souls now say like this when divine healing takes place like it happened on tuesday night in our church and the saints said right monday or tuesday night divine healing took place in our church just on tuesday night praise god what is it it's a continuance of the revival god started just on a smaller realm it starts in the soul but then it re works its way out to the flesh praise god where we see people healed where we see people saved isn't that awesome oh i'm just i just got joy and speakable full of glory today to see these scriptures i've never seen them but ramsay you see the type in almost everything in the entire bible oh church we can just open up our bibles and see great promises oh that's speaking to me that speaker that's speaking abroad it's all speaking of us so much of the bible speaking of jesus's bride aren't you glad bill graham said by being a christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something's supposed to happen but they're looking for in a way off in the future to come when it's already happening right by you let's have our musicians come i'm going to use
