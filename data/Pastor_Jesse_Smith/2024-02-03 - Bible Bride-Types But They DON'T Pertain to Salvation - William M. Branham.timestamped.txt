[0:01] we find here that God has always had
[0:06] Overcomers he's had Overcomers in every
[0:09] age there's always every time and every
[0:13] age that there's been on the earth God
[0:16] has always had somebody he could put his
[0:20] hands on as a witness in the earth he's
[0:23] never been without a witness though
[0:26] sometimes just one but
[0:28] somebody
[0:30] come now like the Saints of
[0:34] old and uh a very fine man a scholar was
[0:40] saying after the Seven Seals he said uh
[0:44] brother Brandon you being a a typist
[0:46] typologist rather said how in the world
[0:50] are you going to put that church in the
[0:53] Rapture without the tribulation period
[0:56] in a
[0:57] time he said you see if it's a type
[1:00] there's got to be uh there's got if it's
[1:03] an antitype there's got to be a type for
[1:05] that antitype to come
[1:07] from and everything I say that is true
[1:11] has a
[1:12] type it has a type you have a shadow and
[1:16] the Bible said the old things was a
[1:17] shadow of the new things to come he said
[1:20] but now you took the Old Testament as a
[1:24] shadow now he said what are you going to
[1:27] do with this
[1:28] church this man comes from a a great uh
[1:32] man great teacher that's a bosom friend
[1:35] of mine very good man and he's a lovely
[1:40] brother and I I'd be Darr to say one
[1:43] word against the brother I wouldn't
[1:45] anyhow as as a as a Christian I wouldn't
[1:47] say nothing against him he's he he don't
[1:49] agree with me on that one subject but he
[1:53] he's my precious brother we eat together
[1:55] and oh he's just a Dandy fell I take his
[1:58] magazine read his articles and he writes
[2:00] some of mine so forth and I've took a
[2:03] many texts out of what I I've read read
[2:06] of his articles hear him say he's a
[2:09] great man but he he just can't agree
[2:12] with me I appreciate that his sincerity
[2:15] though he don't just one of these
[2:16] pushover just have to grieve everything
[2:18] he say he's got his own
[2:20] convictions and he stands for I
[2:22] appreciate that and he's a good man oh I
[2:26] I'm not a teacher or scholar at all but
[2:29] this man's both teacher and Scholar but
[2:31] I I can't agree with him because I don't
[2:33] see it but it doesn't pertain to
[2:36] Salvation it's pertaining to the coming
[2:39] of the Lord he sees that the church has
[2:42] to go through the tribulation period for
[2:45] purification I say the blood of Jesus
[2:48] Christ purifies the
[2:49] church it needs no I believe that the
[2:53] church goes through the tribulation
[2:54] period Church organization that's right
[2:57] but the bride does not would would you
[3:00] choose the woman you had to purify
[3:01] before you married
[3:05] her Christ's bride is
[3:08] chosen and she is
[3:11] elected and she's God's
[3:15] bride a bride of Jesus Christ and now he
[3:19] said how you going to type that if that
[3:23] bride Goes Forth goes up before she goes
[3:27] through the tribulation period say I got
[3:29] scripture it shows you that the church
[3:30] is in the tribulation period I said just
[3:32] read the six seal that's all she's right
[3:35] there under the tribulation
[3:37] period but find out just before that the
[3:41] bride's done gone amen she's in glory at
[3:44] that time she has no purification see he
[3:48] that believeth on me has everlasting
[3:50] life and shall not come into
[3:52] condemnation or the
[3:54] Judgment but pass from Death unto life
[3:59] Christ gave the a promise that we would
[4:00] not even stand at the
[4:03] Judgment so freely did he take my place
[4:06] and tell I'm absolutely
[4:08] free when I'm pardoned I'm pardoned
[4:12] amen how can you take me out of the pawn
[4:15] shop got a clear receipt of how can you
[4:17] be my redeemer and take me from the pawn
[4:19] shop and the broker still say I belong
[4:21] to him now I got a written
[4:24] receip
[4:25] amen wrot by the blood of Jesus Christ
[4:29] see now
[4:30] now in that here's where we come he said
[4:35] now how are you going to get separate
[4:38] that elected bride you talk about now
[4:41] how you going to put that under a type I
[4:43] said very
[4:44] good I say here it is now in Matthew the
[4:50] 27th chapter and the 51st verse if we
[4:55] let me just read it and then we we got
[4:57] it good then we find find out whether it
[5:00] was typed or not where was the elected
[5:02] bride Matthew the 27th chapter and the
[5:06] and the 50 first verse all right we read
[5:11] this at the crucifixion of our
[5:14] law and
[5:17] behold the veil of the temple was
[5:20] written Twain From the top to the
[5:23] bottom now that was the law the law
[5:26] ended right there because the Veil kept
[5:29] the congregation from the holy articles
[5:32] of God only an anointed priest went in
[5:35] there and that once the
[5:37] year remember now God with his own hand
[5:42] notice from the top to the bottom not
[5:46] from the bottom to the top there some 40
[5:48] ft High notice not from the bottom to
[5:51] the top but from the top to the bottom
[5:53] showed it was done by God rent The Veil
[5:56] and to then though anyone who whosoever
[6:00] will may come and partake of his
[6:02] Holiness all right from top to the
[6:06] bottom and the earthy quake and the
[6:08] Rocks rent and the graves were
[6:12] open and many bodies of the Saints which
[6:15] slept arose and came out of the graves
[6:18] after his resurrection went into the
[6:21] holy city and appeared to
[6:24] manyen there's that
[6:27] elected that bride not all all of the
[6:30] Jewish Church come forth at that time
[6:33] all of them made the same sacrifice all
[6:36] of them has under the shed blood of the
[6:37] lamb but there was an elected
[6:40] group and that elected group as soon as
[6:42] the event come that really believed in
[6:46] it was sincere sincerity now I'm coming
[6:49] to the word overcome now hold that these
[6:52] that had really
[6:54] overcome sincerely making the same
[6:57] offering that the rest of them made but
[6:59] but in
[7:00] sincerity overcome the things of the
[7:05] worldall when the propitiation correctly
[7:09] was made for them they were in Paradise
[7:11] until that PL that time when that time
[7:14] was made they had overcome and was
[7:16] resting sleeping see many bodies of
[7:19] those that slept in the death
[7:23] slept now if we had time we could go on
[7:25] back to Daniel when Daniel that elected
[7:28] one let it
[7:31] overcome and he said close up the book
[7:33] Daniel for thou shall rest in thy
[7:37] L but when the prince shall come which
[7:41] will stand for the people thou shallal
[7:43] stand in the
[7:44] heart here it
[7:47] is Daniel this prophet of God saw the
[7:52] end time coming and he said Daniel
[7:56] you'll stand in your life if that
[8:01] day here he was come forth not all of
[8:05] Israel but the bride type of
[8:09] Israel now the rest of Israel don't come
[8:11] forth until the general
[8:13] resurrection and now at the coming of
[8:16] the Lord Jesus those who are
[8:18] really loving his coming that's living
[8:22] for
[8:23] it when he appears in the sky amen the
[8:28] church and dead and Christ or rise and
[8:31] those be changed in a moment the rest
[8:34] them will know nothing about it remember
[8:37] a to those in the
[8:39] city see the the the Rapture will be
[8:43] like
[8:45] that we'll see each other and we'll see
[8:48] them the rest of the world won't see
[8:49] them and it'll be caught away as a
[8:53] secret
[8:54] going waiting for that time then
[8:57] returning back to to the Earth that
[9:00] glorious Millennium then the Thousand
[9:03] Years the rest of the Dead live not for
[9:05] a thousand years and then come forth the
[9:07] general Resurrection where all Israel
