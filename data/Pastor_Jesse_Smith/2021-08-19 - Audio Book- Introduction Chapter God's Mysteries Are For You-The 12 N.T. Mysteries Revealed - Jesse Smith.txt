TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the 12 new testament mysteries revealed wraps your wisdom for christ's bride written and read by jesse smith copyright 2021 jesse smith bride of christ ministries incorporated introduction god's mysteries are for you the introduction contains footnotes numbers 1 through 120. he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given matthew 13 verse 11 it is at such a time as this the time of the end at the height of satan's greatest deception in which he is trapping all nations in a modern sodom and gomorrah state with the same days of noah conditions of gluttony and drunkenness that jesus christ the true and faithful witness has kept his promise to loose the mysterious seals on his bible and is revealing his secrets therein to you his dearly beloved god's eternal secrets are now at your fingertips his revelations were not originally sent to me i've only compiled them the new testament literally labels 12 individual doctrines as mysteries and if god is eternal as he claims then these doctrines are his eternal secrets the premise of this book is to make you aware of god's mysteries he wants you to understand share and live by before his second coming perhaps the thought of god having secrets you haven't known up to this point in your life makes you nervous or uneasy no one likes to feel like they do not know enough but don't fret i want to encourage you that god has chosen this time of your life to reveal his mysteries to you solomon says our omniscient god has a time and season for every purpose under heaven now is the season for you to allow god to reveal his mysteries to you as you read through this book the holy spirit will break down any misunderstandings you may have about his plan of redemption that he may build up your faith in the truth much biblical proof validates god's desire to reveal deeper more intimate knowledge about himself to you a hide and seek romance drama the bible contains the ultimate love story you are probably aware of god's love as scripture says for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son but did you know that the father's love was so great for mankind that he planned for his son the lamb to be slain for you before the foundation of the world along with pre-planning your salvation through the death of christ god also chose you in him before the foundation of the world after choosing you he predestinated the events of your life so he would be close to you and that you could seek after him and find him god set up your life like a hide and seek romance drama a clear allegory of this divine romance is that of the husband and wife jesus is the heavenly bridegroom and christians are his earthly bride chapter 4 covers this great mystery in full detail jesus teaches that god's primary role is seeker in this romance saying ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you paul says there is none that seeketh after god ultimately it is god who seeks and gives every good and perfect gift even our faith no man can boast for working to gain the salvation of the lord god loves to be on the seeker side of the drama jesus says that god searches after souls who will worship him in spirit and truth in his own words christ said he came to seek and save that which was lost our lord also stated his desire to hover over jerusalem as a hand her brood but they turned him down god lovingly sought men's souls in the days of noah but found only one in the earth that walked with him noah in a minor way god allows us to feel a need for him causing us to seek him remember the marriage allegory solomon's relationship with his wife in song of solomon portrays this drama well his wife is love sick and seeking solomon but does not immediately find him but once reunited marriage bliss ensues at times god hides himself because he loves to be sought after and feel our love isaiah says verily thou art a god that hides thyself o god of israel the savior after hiding god will then honor those who diligently search for his love proverbs says it is the glory of god to conceal a thing but the honor of kings is to search out a matter sometimes our creator will withhold answers to our prayer requests until we cry out to him in desperation solomon says if thou criest after knowledge and lift us up thy voice for understanding if thou seekest her as silver and searches for her as for head treasures then shalt thou understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god god loves to hear our prayers and feel our need for him it's obvious god loves romantic suspense and fulfillment so he placed this enjoyment in our lives both naturally and spiritually how wonderful it is to be loved and sought after by the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise god perhaps this is why both children and adults enjoy fairy tales of heroic kings rescuing beautiful princesses the tales remind us that our heroic god has defeated all enemies to save us his spotless glorious beloved wife jesus's own words prove that your creator wants to share his heart and mysteries with you jesus is preaching on the mysteries imagine you lived two thousand years ago and were privileged to hear jesus christ preach the gospel you along with the multitudes of followers would probably hang on his every word because of his reputation as a healer picture how you would feel if jesus told the crowd he wanted to share god's secrets with them your heart would explode with excitement and anticipation as god's deep intentions feelings and motives would be shared with you but then to your surprise he told simple parables about everyday work planting seeds fishing and baking bread how could god's intimate mysteries be revealed in such simple everyday tasks yet this is exactly what happened when jesus preached and is recorded in three out of four gospels in the gospel of matthew account jesus taught specifically on seven mysteries related to the kingdom of heaven see chapter eight there's five reasons jesus preached about the mysteries of god based upon matthew 13 verses 3 through 51 first god's mysteries were special knowledge for believers only jesus christ specifically stated this saying that unbelievers would not receive god's mysteries both jesus and paul declared that unbelievers loved the world more than god and thus would not desire the gospel recall this chapter's epigraph wherein jesus said it was given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given evidently god gives the understanding of his mysteries only to those who believe in him because only believers desire his knowledge the mysteries are not given to rejecters of the messiah scripture teaches that jesus would preach to multitudes but then would have private conversations with his disciples in order to confirm that they understood his messages second jesus taught the mysteries of god because he knew the knowledge would be valuable and precious to his followers everything about christ is precious to the christian as peter says unto you therefore which believe he is precious conversely god's knowledge is not precious to unbelievers in the discourse from the gospel of mark christ said his parables were just parables to unbelievers meaningless stories messiah said but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables to the unbeliever jesus's preaching was just mundane preaching it was not inspirational life-changing truth like it was to true christians third jesus preached about the mysteries in order to fulfill prophecy about himself one thousand years before christ the psalmist foretold the coming mysteries of god generation after generation were longing for this knowledge over the centuries millions of faithful jews were prayerfully anticipating these amazing revelations from god's own heart the gospel of matthew even recorded that jesus would utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world so even before david in the psalms all the way back to adam and eve god had secrets he was saving to reveal when his only begotten son would roam the earth he created jesus said that many prophets and righteous men had desired to see and hear what the disciples had experienced but were not ordained for that earthly assignment fourth jesus preached the mysteries in parables to give everyone a fair chance at receiving eternal life scripture says god is not a respecter of persons and desires that all would be saved god freely offers salvation to all men in simplicity in fact jesus's parables were so simple that they required hearers to humble themselves and become like a child in order to accept them jesus rejoiced at the thought of god's parables being received by the humble but hidden from prideful self-proclaimed wise men of the world the prophet isaiah nearly 800 years before christ prophesied that even a fool would not err in the way of salvation due to its simplicity god has made salvation such a simple subject to understand while revealing his creative power to all men so that all men will be without excuse on the day of judgment lastly and most importantly god's mysteries contain the keys to receive eternal life jesus said those who received his mysteries would gain the following spiritual abilities see with their eyes hear with their ears and understand with their heart while being converted and healed but sadly in the same scripture jesus taught that most hearers would purposely close their own eyes in order to continue in sin and not see his truth their eyes they have closed those who reject the mysteries will remain unconverted sin sick with unforgiven sins your destiny hinges upon understanding and applying god's mysteries to your life jesus's friends know the mysteries jesus reveals his mysteries to only one group of people his friends obedience is the only requirement for friendship with jesus christ says ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you doers of god's word are god's righteous friends as paul says obedience leads to righteousness know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto unrighteousness proverbs declares god's secret is with the righteous god's requirement for friendship is obedience based upon love in john chapter 14 jesus repeatedly expresses that love motivates believers to obey god's commands saying if you love me keep my commands he that hath my commands and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me undoubtedly you can be god's friend if you love him and keep his commands john called the believer's love for god the love of the father teaching that if any man loved the world the love of the father is not in him every human has the choice to either love the sinful things of the world or the holy things of god our father jesus had the love of the father to such a degree that he did only those things which pleased him as friends of jesus he gives us a status that is more personal than mere servants henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you jesus told his earthly disciples all that god showed him holding nothing back we have the same privilege today because jesus said the holy spirit would guide us into all truth and tell us things to come that we might be prepared for his return abraham is privileged to be called the friend of god three times in scripture because he believed god's promises genesis says god knew abraham would keep his commands and train his family to do so based upon abraham's faithfulness god revealed his plans to destroy sodom and gomorrah abraham the faithful friend of both god and man responded by interceding in prayer to god for his nephew lot whom god saved from destruction friends of god in our time will make themselves ready for the second coming of jesus christ paul says we will not live in sinful darkness being overtaken as a thief in the night when judgment is poured out upon the earth because we love the light of god's truth he has not appointed us unto wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ mysteries are treasures god's mysteries are invaluable spiritual treasures that must be preached to god's people jesus says his words are truth spirit and life solomon says the value of god's wisdom is so great that nothing on earth could be compared to it you'll soon learn his mysteries are also bred jesus said god's mysteries were given to his apostles who would then preach those truths to all who would listen go ye therefore and teach all nations god's mysteries are meant to be shared and this job was so important that jesus prayed for his messengers and those that would believe on christ through their preaching neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word when his mysteries are preached both new and old treasures of truth will be brought forth when we attend preaching services we expect to be reminded of god's eternal truths but also hear new revelations to inspire our commitment to the gospel of jesus christ jesus promises that a spiritual hunger and thirst will be satisfied blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they should be filled to bring forth god's truth treasures ministers study and pray diligent studying and meditation upon the word of god allows preachers to rightly divide the words of truth jesus promises that praying in secret will produce an open public reward for those who practice it the greatest reward a minister could receive is that both he and his hearers would be saved by the life-giving treasures of god's word praying and meditating on the treasures of god was so critical that the early apostles created the deacon office to care for the physical needs of the people so that they could focus on the people's spiritual needs which could be met only through the preaching of god's word stewards of the mysteries god's mysteries are so valuable that paul said all ministers of the gospel were stewards of the mysteries of god the greek definition of steward is a manager or superintendent since i am employed as a public school teacher my mind cannot help but compare the job of a minister with a school district superintendent in both occupations the worker is a manager of someone else's resources and is accountable for his actions the minister handles god's word and people while the superintendent handles the community's facilities and its financial and human resources my school district's budget is approximately 50 million dollars can you imagine being responsible for a sum that large but in reality the gospel minister is responsible for much more than the superintendent because earthly riches eventually perish but eternal life with jesus christ is never ending the fruits of a faithful ministry will be believers who live eternally with jesus walking on streets paved with pure transparent gold paul says ministers are required to be faithful managers of the mysteries of god saying it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful ministers faithfully teach uphold and rightly divide the truth for jesus says the truth will set hearers free from sin the minister's spiritual labor makes him worthy of not honor but double honor preaching truth is such an honorable work that paul says faithful ministers keep believers souls from losing faith he compares preaching false doctrine to being cankered or having gained green a flesh-eating disease saying their word will eat as doth a canker and overthrow the faith of some false doctrine is an evil sin that slowly consumes a worshiper's sincerity causing him to give up his faith in christ the remedy is a god-sent preacher who will faithfully and uncompromisingly preach truth jesus uses the illustration of a household manager to represent a minister in luke chapter 12. he says a faithful and wise steward is blessed by god because he feeds his household their portion of meat in due season god's truths are spiritual meals full of life-giving vitamins david says about god's word oh taste and see that the lord is good and sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb jesus said his meat was to do the will of god or the word of god the church of jesus christ must be healthy growing in grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ being god steward is a huge responsibility and includes tests sometimes stewards become discouraged or suffer persecution because satan always attacks true stewards through false ones as the children of the flesh will always persecute the children of the spirit in paul's stewardship he experienced much persecution and often requested prayer that he would preach god's mysteries with boldness he said praying for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak stewards today like paul of old need our prayers that they may declare the mystery of god boldly the finished mystery of god the bible foretold a time would come when all the mysteries of god are finished or revealed revelation 10 verse 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets now is the time in which god promised to reveal all his mysteries before the second coming of jesus christ to the earth first revelation 10 verses 1 through 6 show that jesus is the mighty angel descending to earth to sound forth the contents of the heavenly book that was previously sealed with seven seals two descriptions of this mighty angel match previous descriptions of christ from revelation chapter 1 a face as it were the sun and feet as pillars of fire this visitation to earth is not the physical body of jesus for that body is not an angel being made a little lower than the angels that it might taste death for every man the revelation 10 visitation is that of jesus's spirit or the holy spirit god's spirit is referred to as an angel or messenger many times in the old testament the angel of the lord commissioned to moses could forgive sins which only god can do hebrews calls moses angel christ saying esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt second revelation 10 verse 3 describes the earthly voice of christ as a roaring lion which represents the holy spirit prophesying through a prophet amos chapter 3 verses 7 and 8 says surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord god has spoken who can but prophesy notice that seven thunders utter their voices after the line roared a thunder represents the voice of god the seven thunders must be god interpreting each of the seven seals that were loosed off the little book through a prophet prophesying on the earth every time a seal is loosed off the little book a thunder sounds as seen in revelation 6 verse 1 and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four bees sang come and see third the seventh angel mentioned in revelation 10 verse 7 has to be a male human being because god's pattern is to save humans through the preaching of humans paul said ye are saved if you keep in memory what i preached unto you god never used angels to preach salvation and bring conversions to men the bible fully supports this interpretation as david paul and a prophet in revelation 22 are all referred to as angels david was an angel of god to both achish and mephibosheth the galatians received paul as an angel of god even as christ jesus john was shown the patmos vision by a prophet who was called an angel identified as a fellow servant of john of his brethren the prophets since the seventh angel's voice of revelation 10 verse 7 is finishing the mystery of god he must be a human being chapters 7 and 13 prove this man was god's prophet william branham who lived from 1909 to 1965. appendix b lists his quotes supporting the godhead mystery while the rest are available for free on my personal website at www.pastorjessesmith.com forward slash 12 mysteries book fourth multiple prophets foretold of the opening of the seven seal book and the finnish mystery just as revelation 10 verse 7 says as he hath declared to his servants the prophets daniel declared the seal book would be opened at the time of the end when many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased daniel predicted by the spirit advances in transportation and the internet joel 2 verses 23 through 26 speaks of a latter rain that will restore god's people back to spiritual prosperity the prophet malachi said the hearts of the children would be turned back to the hearts of their fathers pointing to a time when christians would experience god's presence like the early apostles in the book of acts jesus the god prophet echoed malachi's prediction that the christian restoration would take place through a prophet anointed with the spirit of elijah saying elias truly shall first come and restore all things the words of the prophets and christ prove that god's mystery will be completed before the second coming of jesus christ lastly the scriptures following revelation 10 verse 7 verses 8 through 11 describe how the spreading of the finished mystery actually completes jesus's great commission because it must be preached worldwide revelation 10 verse 11 says prophesy again before nations peoples kings and tongues john symbolizes the church who eats the open book and empowered by its revelations takes the revealed mysteries around the world to prepare god's people for jesus's second coming jesus says we are currently in the times of the gentiles the time that god is offering salvation to all nations while keeping the jews blind to the gospel because of their rejection of christ the 12 new testament mysteries the new testament mentions 12 mystery doctrines that compose the complete mystery of god spoken of in revelation 10 verse 7. you may wonder why god chose 12 mysteries rather than another number when searching scripture the meaning of 12 is government rulership or a kingdom examples include the 12 tribes of israel 12 legions of angels 12 apostles of christ and twelve pieces of shoe bread in the holy place it is through the type of shoe bread that we can understand why there are twelve new testament mystery doctrines in hebrew shoe bread means face and has gained the title bread of the face this indicates that through this bread god's face could be seen israel's high priest could only enter the holy of holies once a year representing seeing god's face but every sabbath god had constant communion with israel through the continual shoe bread that was laying before the lord the lesson is that through continual communion with god you can come into his presence his face for israel the 12 cakes or pieces of shoe bread were placed before the lord alway in the holy place god always wanted fresh bread before his face the holy of holies as his people daily approached him in worship there was never to be a time when god's people were lacking holy bread in their worship after laying before the lord for an entire week the twelve loaves were eaten by the priests as a most holy offering when the twelve new loaves were set in place each tribe of israel the entire kingdom was symbolized as having communion with god through the weekly eating of twelve cakes god sustained israel's earthly kingdom through his holy bread today he sustains his earthly spiritual kingdom through his twelve mystery doctrines for christians the shoe bread was foreshadowing that god is approached and known through the eating or believing of his fresh sacred word bread represents the word of god as jesus name the word of god says i am the bread of life god's name like the shoe bread is sacred or hallowed paul likens a true worship experience unto the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth the apostle recorded that the thessalonians received his preaching not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which effectually worketh also in you that belief christians like israel have a spiritual government of 12 leaders jesus told his apostles they would sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel the spiritual lesson is that god has a christian government representing the entire group of jew and gentile believers who are privileged with god's fellowship through his holy word we as jesus spiritual kingdom on earth have communion with almighty god right now through his 12 mystery doctrines that reveal his secrets furthermore just as israel could see god only through continually eating the 12 cakes we can see her understand god only when we have a true understanding of the 12 mystery doctrines any other contradicting views or opinions would be unholy spoiled or stale bred it is no coincidence that there are twelve doctrines labeled as mysteries not three five or ten in the new testament god is showing us his new testament kings and priests that we are to constantly feast on the preaching of his holy fresh and life-giving mystery truce each seceding chapter in this book is dedicated to the following twelve new testament mysteries the mystery of the godhead the mystery of israel's spiritual blindness the mystery of the new testament church composed of both jew and gentile the mystery of the new testament church as the bride of christ the mystery of godliness restored to man the mystery of christ in you the mystery of the seven stars and seven golden candlesticks the mystery of the kingdom of heaven the mystery of babylon the mystery of iniquity the mystery of god's will the mystery of the rapture these 12 mysteries are your spiritual food for this season of your life just as the jewish priests entered into the holy place to worship and commune with god you can enter into a dedicated life with christ as a spiritual priest and receive his nourishment tasting his amazing grace and growing thereby appendix a is a condensed bible study reference list for teaching the first revelation the godhead all other bible study reference lists for the remaining 11 mysteries are available for free online at smith dot www.pastorjessesmith.com forward slash 12 mysteries book speaking the mysteries in love god's gifted fivefold ministry of apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers preach the twelve new testament mysteries hearers of the fivefold ministry spiritually benefit by healthy growth complete maturity edification unity and stability the end result is followers of christ whose lives closely resemble the stature or character of jesus christ himself another important benefit is speaking the truth in love jesus's true disciples are known by their love for both enemies and fellow christians love is the greatest gift god has given to his people jesus sent out his first apostles as harmless doves paul's tender love and gentleness for new converts characterized his missionary work in thessalonica one of the greatest dangers christians face is receiving the revelations of god's mysteries intellectually instead of by faith genuine faith works through love hebrews uses israel as an example of hearing the word but not mixing it with faith paul witnessed the same type of people who heard and understood god's mysteries but never received his love he said though i understand all mysteries and have not charity i am nothing let the holy spirit shed the love of god abroad in your heart even if you can understand all the upcoming mystery revelations you will not be profited one benefit unless you plan to share god's truth with a loving spirit god hates pride and he delights in an upright innocent heart conclusion this is god's season to reveal his mysteries to you that jesus preached two thousand years ago he led you to this book your desire to love and obey his commands makes you his friend the 12 new testament mysteries are spiritual food you need to grow in this season of your life in order to be a faithful steward of the mysteries i have organized each chapter to begin with the confusion surrounding the mystery followed by the biblical proof of its revelation last are the rewards for receiving the revelation and consequences for rejecting it jesus says his mysteries were just for you his friend his beloved christ will help you correctly understand the bible by the grace of god after reading this book you'll know where you came from where you are now and where you are going
