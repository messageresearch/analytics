[1:06] you live in the United States or a PDF
[1:08] if you live outside the United States
[1:10] the audiobook for chapter nine is also
[1:13] available for free on my YouTube channel
[1:16] the judgment and destruction of mystery
[1:18] Babylon is found in chapter 18 verses 6
[1:22] through 24 which comes in one hour of
[1:25] one day according to verses 8 and 10.
[1:28] the merchants of the earth who lived in
[1:30] luxury just like the Roman Catholic
[1:32] Church Vatican officials weep and wail
[1:35] over the vatican's destruction which
[1:37] shows that there is a strong connection
[1:39] between the religious influence of the
[1:41] Roman Catholic Church Upon government
[1:42] leaders and their economies
[1:46] the symbols and key Revelations are
[1:48] numerous and include the Beast the
[1:52] mother Harlot the sitting of the Harlot
[1:54] on the waters and the Beast the B7 heads
[1:58] the harlot's fornication drunkenness
[2:01] riches and colors
[2:03] the great City ten horns the call to
[2:07] come out of her my people
[2:09] The Book of Life
[2:11] her sorceries and her guilt for every
[2:14] murder committed
[2:16] the Beast of Revelation 17 verse 3 is
[2:19] the Roman Kingdom which has seven heads
[2:22] and ten horns because it has the same
[2:24] description we have already taught on in
[2:26] Revelation Chapter 13 Verse 1. this
[2:29] Roman kingdom is the fourth Gentile
[2:31] Kingdom from Daniel chapter 2. when
[2:33] Daniel interpreted King Nebuchadnezzar's
[2:35] dream of a great image see Daniel 2
[2:38] verse 31. this Roman Kingdom will
[2:41] continue to rule the Gentile World until
[2:43] Christ Returns the stone cut out of the
[2:46] mountain and destroys the image
[2:48] according to Daniel 2 verse 45.
[2:51] it is important to note that in
[2:53] Revelation 17 verse 8 this Beast will
[2:55] Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go
[2:57] into perdition or its own destruction
[3:00] which is most likely the full power and
[3:03] strength of the Roman Kingdom since the
[3:05] kingdom of Rome is already here and
[3:07] ruling today in the Roman Catholic
[3:09] Church
[3:11] the mother Harlot is a symbol of the
[3:13] Unfaithful Roman Catholic church for a
[3:15] woman always symbolizes a church as seen
[3:18] in Acts 7 verse 38 and Ephesians 5 32.
[3:23] the Roman Catholic Church is the mother
[3:25] of false Christian churches or the First
[3:28] Christian Church that denominated thus
[3:31] limiting the Holy Spirit and accepting
[3:33] man's leadership instead of God's
[3:35] leadership
[3:36] this mother is a harlot because she is
[3:39] unfaithful to Christ and Christ is the
[3:41] word of God and this woman shares her
[3:44] false doctrines or abominable teachings
[3:46] with all the nations of the world
[3:48] notice that this mother denomination has
[3:51] daughters or children according to
[3:53] Revelation 2 verse 23 which are the
[3:55] Protestant churches that have
[3:57] denominated either by written Creeds and
[3:59] bylaws or by adherence to her false
[4:03] doctrines such as the three-person
[4:05] Trinity of Gods
[4:08] the sitting of the Harlot on the waters
[4:10] is a symbol of the Roman Catholic Church
[4:12] having influence over multitudes of
[4:15] people or Waters according to Revelation
[4:17] 17 verse 15.
[4:19] this is proven by the fact that she has
[4:21] churches in nearly every nation on Earth
[4:23] and sends ambassadors to those Nations
[4:25] as well
[4:28] the sitting of the Harlot on the Beast
[4:30] is a symbol that the Roman Catholic
[4:32] Church rides the power and influence of
[4:36] the Demonic Spirit of Rome also known as
[4:39] the Beast
[4:40] the spirit of Rome which divides and
[4:42] conquers is empowering the Roman
[4:44] Catholic church today and will continue
[4:46] to crush every nation under Heaven
[4:48] according to Daniel 7 verse 23 and
[4:51] Revelation 14 verse 8.
[4:54] the beast's seven heads are interpreted
[4:57] in Revelation 17 verse 9 as seven
[5:00] mountains or Hills according to the
[5:02] Greek Lexicon these Seven Hills are the
[5:05] Seven Hills of ancient Rome on which
[5:08] ancient Rome was built and was in close
[5:11] proximity to
[5:13] the harlot's fornication is a symbol of
[5:15] unfaithfulness to the true teachings of
[5:18] Jesus Christ and His Holy Bible the
[5:21] Roman Catholic church has given her love
[5:22] to idolatrous statues ritualistic
[5:25] prayers and many other heretical
[5:27] doctrines of men proving that she is
[5:30] unfaithful to Christ the word
[5:33] the harlot's drunkenness is a symbol of
[5:35] a blind spiritual condition according to
[5:38] Isaiah 29 verses 9 and 10. the Roman
[5:41] Catholic Church cannot see the truth of
[5:43] God's word and has been so blind it has
[5:46] not been able to discern true Christian
[5:48] teaching for nearly two thousand years
[5:50] the Roman Catholic Church is guilty of
[5:52] instituting the Inquisition which is an
[5:55] undeniable historical example of its
[5:57] persecution and murder of millions of
[6:00] Protestants
[6:01] and therefore the Roman Catholic Church
[6:03] is drunken with the blood of the Saints
[6:05] according to Revelation 17 verse 6
[6:07] Protestant historians record medieval
[6:10] Roman Catholic Church practices in the
[6:12] most negative terms and recall the
[6:14] massive Corruption of the Catholic
[6:15] church leaders including adulteries
[6:18] bribes extravagant papal art and
[6:21] architecture projects brothels
[6:24] and most destructive Wars of conquest
[6:26] such as the Catholic Crusades
[6:30] the colors and Riches of this Harlot
[6:32] church are denounced in Revelation 17
[6:35] verse 4 and chapter 18 verses 16 and 17.
[6:39] the colors of the Roman Catholic Church
[6:40] are purple and Scarlet which are
[6:42] commonly worn by priests archbishops and
[6:45] the pope and are warned during annual
[6:47] festivals and holy days
[6:50] the Roman Catholic Church is Rich with
[6:52] gold precious stones and Pearls as
[6:54] explained in Revelation 17 verse 4. the
[6:57] Bible portrays this woman or church as a
[7:00] wealthy Church the Vatican gets Free
[7:02] Will donations from more than one
[7:04] billion Catholics worldwide the Vatican
[7:07] also earns interest on its Investments
[7:09] and has flocks of tourists and visitors
[7:11] for its museums Galleries and libraries
[7:13] which hold their Priceless collections
[7:16] the mass Services of the Roman Catholic
[7:18] Church showcase golden cups instruments
[7:21] and precious stones just as the Bible
[7:24] foretold
[7:25] this Harlot is also called that great
[7:28] city as this Harlot Church Reigns over
[7:30] the kings of the Earth what other church
[7:32] can claim to be a great City and have
[7:34] influence politically and spiritually
[7:36] over the Earth's leaders other than the
[7:39] Vatican City which includes the Roman
[7:41] Catholic church and her Pope the Vatican
[7:44] city-state is the epitome of church and
[7:46] state
[7:47] the Vatican City is the world's smallest
[7:49] fully independent nation-state
[7:52] the city-state is tax free and has its
[7:55] own telephone system post office Gardens
[7:58] astronomical Observatory radio station
[8:01] banking system and Pharmacy as well as a
[8:05] contingent of Swiss guards responsible
[8:06] for the personal safety of the Pope
[8:09] since 1506.
[8:12] the ten horns of the Beast are symbolic
[8:14] for Ten Kings according to chapter 17
[8:17] verses 12-14
[8:19] these Ten Kings are rulers of Nations
[8:21] that will give power to the Beast or
[8:24] Roman Church for one hour during the
[8:26] tribulation period but then turn and
[8:28] hate her and Destroy her with fire
[8:30] according to Revelation 17 verses 16 and
[8:33] 17.
[8:36] come out of her my people is a key
[8:38] Revelation that teaches all of God's
[8:40] children will come out of false churches
[8:42] who teach false Doctrine including the
[8:45] Roman Catholic Church the mother of
[8:47] denominations and all the daughters of
[8:49] the mother
[8:50] and these daughters are the Protestant
[8:52] denominations who have taught the Roman
[8:55] Catholic Church's false Doctrine
[8:57] Revelation 18 verses 1 through 5 is one
[9:01] final plea to persuade God's people to
[9:03] come out of her the Roman Catholic
[9:05] church so God's people will not receive
[9:07] her plagues
[9:08] as always God will not destroy the
[9:11] righteous with the wicked like he
[9:13] promised in Genesis 18 verse 25 and God
[9:16] in his mercy and foreknowledge will call
[9:18] all the elect Believers out of false
[9:21] Christian churches
[9:23] The Book of Life is a key Revelation
[9:26] from Revelation 17 verse 8 because a
[9:29] person's judgment about the Roman
[9:31] Catholic church and its Protestant
[9:33] daughters reveals if the person's name
[9:36] is on the Book of Life or not from the
[9:39] foundation of the world this means a
[9:41] person's Eternal destination may be
[9:43] known by their attitude toward the Roman
[9:45] Catholic church and her daughters the
[9:47] Protestant churches
[9:49] Revelation 17 verse 8 says that all the
[9:52] people's names who Wonder or admire the
[9:55] beauty and power of the Roman Catholic
[9:57] Church are not written on the Book of
[10:00] Life meaning they will not have eternal
[10:02] life and God knew this before the world
[10:05] was founded
[10:06] the Bible repeatedly declares the
[10:08] foreknowledge of God in regards to the
[10:10] Salvation of souls as unbelievers or
[10:13] make-believers will not have their names
[10:15] on The Book of Life or their names will
[10:18] be removed from The Book of Life as
[10:20] Jesus stated in Revelation 3 verse 5.
[10:23] in contrast true born-again Christians
[10:26] were chosen in Christ before the
[10:28] foundation of the world according to
[10:30] Ephesians 1 verse 4 which means their
[10:33] names were written on the Lamb's Book of
[10:34] Life before the world was founded and
[10:37] will remain on the book for eternity and
[10:40] can never be blotted out
[10:42] the sorceries of the Roman Catholic
[10:44] Church will deceive not some but all
[10:47] nations according to Revelation 18 verse
[10:49] 23 every nation under Heaven which
[10:52] includes the United States Russia and
[10:54] China will be deceived by the spiritual
[10:57] wickedness that will fill the pope
[10:59] Antichrist during the tribulation
[11:01] because second Thessalonians 2 verse 9
[11:03] says that the person of the Antichrist
[11:06] will work by the power of Satan with all
[11:08] power and signs and lying wonders
[11:11] this should Inspire true Christians at
[11:13] all times to always prove All Things by
[11:16] the Bible as first Thessalonians 5 verse
[11:19] 21 says no matter what sign or wonder a
[11:22] person or group can produce
[11:25] Christians must discern the voice behind
[11:27] any potential sign as Deuteronomy 13
[11:30] verses 1 through 11 teaches and this
[11:33] text teaches a true voice behind a true
[11:36] sign from God will not turn us away from
[11:38] obedience to the written word of God the
[11:41] commands of God
[11:43] the mother Harlot Roman Catholic Church
[11:45] is guilty of all the murders done upon
[11:47] the Earth according to Revelation 18
[11:49] verse 24 and in her was found the blood
[11:52] of prophets and of saints and of all
[11:55] that were slain upon the Earth
[11:58] without going into conspiracies this
[12:01] observation must be made that this Bible
[12:03] verse does in fact put all the guilt of
[12:06] all slain upon the Earth upon the Roman
[12:10] Catholic Church
[12:11] this makes us wonder about the influence
[12:12] of the Roman Catholic Church behind
[12:14] every war terrorist attack and murder
[12:17] committed on the Earth
[12:20] recall that the Roman Catholic Church is
[12:22] a cage of unclean and hateful Birds
[12:27] the timing of events is as follows
[12:30] in Revelation 17 verse 8 the Beast
[12:33] ascends out of the bottomless pit and
[12:35] Revelation 11 verse 7 told us the timing
[12:38] of this event it is after the three and
[12:41] a half year testimony of the two Jewish
[12:43] Witnesses or two Jewish prophets is
[12:46] complete
[12:47] so we know the Roman Catholic church or
[12:50] Roman spirit will come into full power
[12:52] after the first half of Daniel's 70th
[12:55] week is complete
[12:57] which will also be three and a half
[12:58] years after the Rapture of the New
[13:00] Testament bride of Jesus Christ
[13:04] in fact the majority of the events in
[13:07] Revelation 17 and 18 take place after
[13:10] the first three and a half years of the
[13:12] tribulation period and include first the
[13:15] Ten Kings symbolizes ten horns that give
[13:19] their power unto the Beast for one hour
[13:20] and make war against the lamb but the
[13:23] lamb will overcome them which is a
[13:25] reference to the battle of Armageddon
[13:27] see Revelation 13 16 and 19.
[13:32] which takes place during the last three
[13:34] and a half years of The Seven Year
[13:36] tribulation period
[13:38] the battle of Armageddon takes place
[13:40] after the seven trumpets and seven vials
[13:43] have been poured out in God's Wrath
[13:45] against the unrepentant world
[13:48] and second the ten horns or Kings will
[13:51] then turn on the or Roman Catholic
[13:54] church and hate her destroying her with
[13:56] fire this destruction of the Vatican
[13:59] City or great city is detailed in
[14:01] Revelation 18 verses 8-24
[14:04] we believe that the fire that destroys
[14:06] this immoral woman will be some type of
[14:08] atomic bomb that Russia will drop on the
[14:11] Vatican City as prophesied by God's
[14:14] Prophet William Branham who said quote
[14:16] and remember I say this is God's Prophet
[14:18] this Russian Empire will drop an atomic
[14:21] bomb of some sort on the Vatican City
[14:23] and Destroy in one hour thus saith the
[14:25] Lord end quote
