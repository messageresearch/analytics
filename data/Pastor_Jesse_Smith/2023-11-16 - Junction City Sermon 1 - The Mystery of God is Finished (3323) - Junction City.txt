TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to share a sermon I preached for a group of new message Believers down in Junction City Ohio the sermon is from back in March of 2023 it has been a powerful testimony to see an entire group of former Amish people come out of the Amish community and now receive the bible-based message that God gave to his Prophet brother William Brandon this is the first sermon I preached to them called The Mystery of God is finished I believe I preach now nine sermons to them and Lord willing I'll be releasing the sermons of these in the next few weeks by God's grace so I first preached this group in March of 20123 then the next month in April of 2023 the Lord had moved upon the hearts of the people and by God's grace I baptized 17 of these new Believers I think only one or two have fallen away but the rest have remained on faithful and rejoicing in the bible message of this hour so it's been a wonderful testimony to see God move one man came to me after the April baptisms and said I've been praying for almost 20 years for a church to come out of the Amish community and received the message of the hour and he said today my prayers have been answered so I just want to share this as an encouragement to keep praying keep trusting in God keep seeking God for the Salvation of your loved ones and your friends God here all of our prayers so hope these sermons are a blessing here's the sermon the mystery of God is finished I like to record the sermon so I can share them later if people want the sermon so yes sir Hallelujah the Holy Spirit surely does the Holy Spirit energizes the word it brings life to the word and uh the Bible said the Bible said the word of God is sharp uh it's active and it's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart so in most Services you know we just we we we hear the word of God and pretty soon the holy spirit will start speaking right to our hearts that's called discernment of the holy spirit amen and when we know when when we when we hear God talking right to us then it perks us right up right we're all going to get tired of ourselves you know we're all human uh but the holy spirit's here to energize the word to Quicken the word amen and uh I'm so so thankful to be here by God's grace um I did bring a lot of extra family pictures we had some extra ones uh I'm sorry my wife can't make it uh and my eight children we have eight children by God's grace you want to pass those around here brother if they like one one of these they haven't got one yet it just so happened we had a lot of extra family pictures this year so I thought I'm going to take those to that uh hus Church there by God's grace and you can get a face and kind of match our our family hopefully 'll be able to come sometime so that's my family uh my wife Kristen uh we've been married uh we'll be married 20 years in June so we got married really young I was 22 and she was 20 thank you sir appreciate that thank you and so we're coming up on our 20 year anniversary hard to believe time just goes like that but uh it's been all done in the Holiness of the Lord you know it's all been the blessing of the Holy Spirit and uh you know eight kids later you know here we are you know and just pray for us you know we've had uh four miscarriages in the last year you know we we're just letting God tell us how many children we should have prise the Lord most people don't do that but we do it we believe that that we believe that's the right way to do it unless there was some medical problem you know but um so just pray for us you know we're seeking God and you know we want God's will to be done and uh but you know that's part of the reason she uh she didn't feel like coming she had a miscarriage a few weeks ago and still recovering and then all my children are in the music Ministry at our church you know uh my son is the lead piano player my daughter my daughters do the organ and my daughter runs the computer you know to show the the sermons and the scriptures and everything and so uh but they wish they could be here hopefully they'll come hopefully they'll be able to come by God's grace is that a son-in-law is one of your daughters married or is that your son no that's my son yeah that's my son yeah he's he's 16 and my daughter next to him on the the the left of him is my oldest daughter Lydia she's 18 so I got 18 all the way down to two you say Lydia Lydia is my oldest daughter my oldest sister is it really okay praise God yeah we're seeing some Lydia here too there's Lydia God bless you Lydia great name I noticed all Daniel's kids were Bible names I'm like oh I like that brother I like that I tried to name most of my kids Bible names so we're very happy to be here here uh normally if it's okay when we read the first verse we like to stand is that okay could we stand okay um brother brother sge had said maybe introducing the the Bible teachings from brother brandham that be okay yes so the main one of the main verses that's blessed me is revelation 10 verse 7 so if if you want to turn your Bibles to Revelation 10:7 just a beautiful scripture and so I got saved brother Iran and I both got saved in the same year not at the same place we we just met today uh but we got saved in the same year 2000 and but then I heard about brother Brandon's Ministry the next year in 2001 so um you know that's when I came to know the ministry of brother brandom um brother bram's Ministry came to point us back to the word of God Amen so many denominations Point outside the Bible they point to big buildings or they point to the lust of the flesh or they point to Hollywood brother Ram came to point us right here to the Bible and so that's how I knew it was the right truth because everything the everything we're taught is from the Bible praise God so we're thankful for that and uh I'm happy to share it today by God's grace appreciate the invitation brother thanks for having us here revelation 10:7 and I like to I like if you would read along with me okay let's just read verse seven together I'd like to hear your voices too and uh we're blessed the Bible says we're blessed to just read this book John said if you just hear this book or read it you're already blessed how many want a blessing today praise God we're going to be blessed just reading the word of God today verse 7 let's read this on three 1 2 3 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets amen so may God add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated so we'll try to just preach as the Holy Spirit leads and I wrote down a few notes you know I might want to reference uh i' like to maybe start you know with uh some of the main teachings that brother Brandon brought us from the Bible um also like to show you what a prophet is in the Bible or maybe share more of what you already know maybe kind of build on your understanding and maybe at the end I'd like to show just share some testimonies about how the Holy Spirit has worked in my life my Ministry and my wife and the children uh maybe to raise your faith by God's grace and I'm sure each one I don't Levi could probably stand here and testify for hours all all God's done for him that would raise my faith he was actually raising my faith on the way here he was telling me all these good testimonies like brother this is awesome man God is God's going to move Hallelujah God God is moving amen because we got to get down to the spot of repentance praise God we got to get we always got to repent and then once we're in that spot we repented then the Holy Spirit can just sweep in and really really move by God's grace amen really move and you know kind of orchestrate the direction of Our Lives PR praise God what and show us what God wants to accomplish in our lives Hallelujah so this is the the first verse and you know um when I became a Christian maybe I'll back around a little bit uh before I became a Christian in 2000 I was raised in a Pentecostal Assembly of God church so I was raised with clapping and every service clapping shouting screaming speaking in tongues interpretation almost every service almost every service um so I was around a lot of emotion okay now but that but mind you that whole time I didn't want to serve God so I sat there like a teenager I just sat there I don't I don't want to serve God I was into sports I was into the NFL the NBA the Major League Baseball I was into sports and I didn't want to serve god um but I knew the power of God now the reason I knew the power of God because when I was in second grade I was eight years old my mother was diagnosed with liver cancer it's incurable still to this day it's incurable um and so she was in the hospital she already had six kids I'm I'm the fourth out of six kids and uh my the doctor said told my mom you have six months to live six months to live and so my dad he couldn't he couldn't handle that he was praying and then one night in the middle of the night he walked over and he laid hands on my mom where the cancer was and he said I rebuke that cancer in the name of Jesus Christ he said he felt a hot warm sensation he never really felt that before and he just left the hospital or went laid down wherever he was at the next day my mom went into surgery they were going to see if they could try to remove some of it now you can't can't remove all of it in the liver but they opened her up and the cancer had vanished praise God that was in 1988 and so I remember my mom coming out of the hospital I remember when we got home she ran she ran to the or she skipped to the mailbox like this she was skipping to the mailbox because she has a brand new life so since I was 8 years old I knew Jesus Christ was alive hallelujah amen because chemo I mean thank God for chemo sometimes it's good thank God for doctors I want to say that thank God for doctors but there's only one Doctor Who can heal everything praise God that's Jesus amen so since I've been 8 years old I've no I could never deny that Jesus is not alive he's real but I still ran from God I wanted to uh you know I wanted to do Sports and everything like that and like I said I was raised in a Pentecostal church and and and um it was a it was overall a good experience I would say overall good experience now now to today I know a a lot of their false doctrines but they have some good doctrines but they have some really major false doctrines as well um so anyways I'll fast forward to when I was 20 I was at College in akan University I was playing football I played football for akan I played with a couple guys that went to the NFL so I have some friends who play in the NFL and uh won some Super Bowls it was kind of neat to see them but yeah to God to God the Super Bowl doesn't matter God don't care about the Super Bowl God cares about saving Souls but it was just neat to see you know have some friends that you know that uh were accomplishing things but it was the year 2000 I went to an athletes and action conference and I saw a big football player raise his hands like this and I got the Holy Spirit came on me I got so ashamed of myself I said Jesus forgive me I've ran from you for 20 years will you forgive me of all my sins and I started crying I started praising God and that's where I got saved in the year 2000 I went home from that conference it was in Columbus actually I went home from the conference back up to akan I took down all my I immoral pictures on the wall I took all those down I threw away all my rock and roll CDs all my rap CDs I don't know if you ever heard of Nirvana or ACDC or Snoop Dog I had all these awful worldly CS I threw them all away I was all into Jesus praise God Hallelujah so that's how I became a Christian and I went to a church up in aaran called the chapel they are a kind of like a Presbyterian church and they had some really sweet people but they didn't believe in any tongues or any interpretation or anything like that but I was just hungering you know I I heard some of the sermons and I loved them but I was hungering for more I was like there's got to be I was reading my Bible every day I was like there's got to be more where's more where's more and so I go to the Baptist Church I got some more there I was like this is this is wonderful there's got to be more Hallelujah and uh well then came 2001 and my brother Simon who's now a preacher as well in and preaching in the message that God gave to brother Bram uh Simon came and said Jesse you got to sit down and you got to listen to the sermon it's called The Serpent seed and so I said okay brother I'll sit down I'll sit down and listen to I sat down and listened to it and my eyes it's like I felt like the blinders had just been taken off my eyes and now the Bible made sense now I know why Jesus had to be born a virgin birth Jesus had to be virgin born because sin came into the world through an immortal sex act in the Garden of Eden that may sound strange but that's what happened because whatever they ate they covered their naked parts amen and there's no food you're going to eat that's going to make you cover up your naked parts right right the fruit was symbolic of adultery the Bible says okay that's in proverbs 30 ver 20 raise your hand if you're familiar with that is anybody familiar with that couple people okay well let's read that since we're on it Proverbs 30:20 if you got that this was my first introduction to the deeper things of God the true word of God even from as the verse we read the mystery of God being finished so Proverbs 30: 20 brother Lei you want to read that for us brother that be okay such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and WIP us her mouths and sayth I have done no wickedness all right thank you sir so here we see the symbolism for adultery is it's liken unto eating okay and so once I saw that in the Gard of Eden now it made sense now you had two seeds you had the seed of God and the serpent seed now if you fast forward of course through the scripture all the you know the sons of God saw the daughters of men in Genesis chapter 6 they enter marry and now it doesn't matter now it doesn't matter what natural seed you are now it matters do you have the spiritual seed of God amen and now you must be born again not of a Jewish lineage or a certain Gentile lineage but now you must be born inside the soul of the word of God Amen Hallelujah let's read that First Peter 1 verse 23 I'm so glad it does not matter who your parents are anymore it doesn't matter uh who your grandparents were or what lineage what country you come from what matters is that you can be born from your father above hallelujah amen 1 Peter 223 this is what the gospel came to do it came to give us a new birth Hallelujah so 1 Peter 1:23 brother Iran you want to read that brother you got that is 1 Peter 1 2 and 3 being born again not a corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and and abide us forever amen praise God the seed we need today or the uh the life we need today is the spiritual Life of Christ to be born again Jesus said in John chapter 3 you probably know it Jesus says uh Marvel not that I say unto you you must be born again praise God he was talking to Jews and they didn't even he said how can I how can I enter into my mother's womb and be born again and Jesus said you call yourselves Masters and you don't understand these things he said you must be born in the soul in other words you must let the Holy Spirit into your mind and then deeper still all the way down to the depth of your being to your very Soul Hallelujah and then when God's in your soul you have a new life you're new born you're born again praise God hallelujah and then Jesus Does The Works in you that he did as well praise God Amen and in all of our brothers and all of our sisters and children children can be born again there's times that's happened when they get to a certain age they can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost my daughter is now 11 she says she got it when she was 8 years old and my daughter danced around the church uh my daughters had all kinds of dreams that come to pass that's just what the Bible says when I pour out my spirit he said your sons and daughters shall dream dreams your old men shall see Visions praise God hallelujah they'll prophesy uh Visions dreams Hallelujah signs wonders and miracles done by the Holy Spirit praise God this is a reality and that's what Jesus wants today he wants to dwell in each and every one of your Souls praise God Amen so this is the birth we need today praise God the birth in the soul Hallelujah all right now uh and that's a whole and that in fact is a mystery why don't we go to that since we're kind of going that direction uh by the Holy Spirit let's go to Colossians chapter 1 if you would let's see where Paul calls Paul calls the baptism of the Holy Ghost he calls it a mystery Colossians chapter 1 he finishes chapter 1 in the middle of the chapter he preaches the godhead this beautiful revelation God and Christ are one and then he ends the chapter with the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I just want to tell you there's just a beautiful spirit here this morning I was over there at uh Levi's house and I just looked out at the the sunrise I started crying cuz God's Beauty out there in nature I get here I just my knees hit the floor I start crying because I feel the pre the presence of God is here I feel the presence of [Music] God Colossians 1 verse uh 20 26 Colossians 1:26 uh now look here even the mystery which hath been hid from ages now think of that and from Generations but is now made manifest to his sa so let's pause it right there Paul's going to share there's a mystery that's been hidden from all these ages like the ages of Malachi like the ages of Nehemiah the ages of zerubabel uh the age of Solomon David there he's going to say there's a mystery that's been hid all these ages but now it's it's available Hallelujah so for 4,000 years of human history this mystery was unavailable but Paul says now it's available praise God Amen and it is what we just read it's the being born again of the spirit of God in the soul praise God that is the mystery Paul's talking about verse 27 to whom God would make known what is the riches glory of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles so Gentiles anyone that's not a Jew I'm sure you maybe know that so there's there's one country in this whole world that's it's Jewish right Israel everybody else is Gentile so we're all Gentiles here today unless do we have any Jews here today by J okay yeah I rarely ever get to meet any Jews cuz I've always live in Ohio I hardly move I never leave Ohio I'm always in Ohio so I I don't meet too many people I just kind of stay in one spot and Pastor the church there um the Gentiles I was finished verse 27 the Gentiles among the Gentiles witches what is this mystery it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen so the whole Myster you know from Adam and Eve down to Noah to Abraham all the whole mystery was Christ wanted to live in them in their soul before that he could live in their mind he would anoint their minds they prophesy you know prophets they'd write the word of God but he never could get into the soul because the blood of Jesus had not yet been shed so before the before the cross before the cross they were their their sins were forgiven by animal blood but the Bible said those sacrifices could never really take away sin that's what the book of Hebrew is all about but once and so so the Holy Spirit couldn't fill their souls right but once Jesus died that blood the Bible said it it's it's God's own blood the Bible says in the book of Acts it's God's own blood and the Bible said that that that God has forgiven all your TR trespasses he's forgiven all your iniquities praise God blessed is the man whom God will not impute iniquity praise God they I mean Abraham wrote about it David wrote about it but Paul could say we've experienced it praise God Amen because we have the all-sufficient sacrifice the blood of Jesus Christ has been shed for us and now the Holy Ghost can go deeper so David had it here right but then when that that that beautiful woman named BBA what happened there this Holy Spirit left him and he didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul to Anchor him so he wouldn't go have adultery right he could defeat the giant of Goliath but he couldn't defeat the giant of lust and adultery because because the Holy Ghost wasn't in the soul but Paul saying this mystery was HIIT all these years that God was going to send the Messiah the Messiah is going to die and then the spirit of the Messiah is going to come and live permanently in The Souls of the Believers hallelujah amen oh my hallelujah amen amen that's a promise amen this is a better Covenant amen the Bible said better Covenant better promises amen hallelujah don't give I mean I admire David for slaying uh Goliath but I don't want to fall into adultery like David did and but I've got power now to keep me from that praise God because I'm in the New Testament I'm under better power better Covenant better promises amen I've got Christ not just in my mind but now I've got Christ in my soul praise God hallelujah so it's Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning warning every man teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Jesus Christ is that yours buddy I got eight kids so I know what it's all about I'm always picking up stuff on God bless that little guy beautiful red hair by the way buddy I love that so not so often you see those red heads they so so beautiful let me give you another one here let's go to the Book of John chapter 7 The Gospel of John this will this will prove it to you here that we have power beyond Old Testament Saints because we have the Holy Ghost in the soul that's why Jesus came to give us his spirit in US Christ in us the hope of glory John 7:37 brother Levi said you might have questions afterwards we be happy to do that you know after eat in Fellowship I love questions every Sunday night at my church is questions and answers we have two services so Sunday morning I preach my heart out preach for an hour and a half and then the evening I just sit down I said all the kids in front I just sit down on a chair and I teach them little lessons and I say anybody got any questions and so the kids ask questions the adults ask questions I love questions I don't have all the answers but I know Jesus does praise God I'm trying to train the children to know their Bibles and that it's okay to ask questions God's not afraid of your questions praise God God God is not afraid of your questions the thing we need often though is patience in order for God to answer our questions in his own time that's what we need we need patience so John 7:37 in that last I'm sorry in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this fake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified look at that undeniable the David couldn't have the Holy Ghost like we could have it today it wasn't available right but today it's available today Christ can live in US permanently praise God don't get me wrong I I believe I got filled with the Holy Ghost in the day after I got married was 2003 the day after my wedding day that's when I believe I got the holy ghost in my soul I was saved you know I was saved in 2000 but 3 years later I believe the Holy Ghost came down into my soul because I had an experience I never had before and it set me free before I was a little bit ashamed to praise God but once that once the spirit of God fell in my soul I was a different person I left that service shaking everybody's hand like I would just go up and I shake these guys hands oh God bless you I just loved everybody so love fell into my heart yes amen thank you buddy amen I can shake all your hands but just I just felt so different in fact it was the day after my wedding we were late to church because we just were tired from the wedding the previous day I went to church and my pastor brother Brooks was preaching do you know brother Isaiah Brooks right you that's okay he was preaching he lives out in Iowa now and he was preaching he was preaching about the blood of Jesus Christ how it totally forgives us and I stood up I just started crying I started shouting praising God and I think it's the only Vision I ever saw in my life I saw Jesus getting nailed to the cross and I felt the nails it's like I felt on the inside I felt the vibrations and I just wept and cried and said thank you Jesus for dying for my sins Hallelujah I always love you I always serve you I just maybe pray like that for maybe 10 minutes I don't know maybe 5 10 15 minutes I don't know and I just stayed after service praising God and when I walked out of there I felt like a million dollars I just felt like I just felt as light as light as a feather praise God I felt like I was floating out of the church and I just want to love every single person and that's when I felt the power of God come into my life praise God now so here you can see the Holy Ghost cannot be given well we know the Bible says Samson was anointed with the Holy Ghost right David was anointed with the Holy Ghost so that must be a different kind of anointing it was it was anointing on the human Spirit or the mind okay how many know you got how how many people know you have three parts to your being yeah you have a body you have a mind and you have a soul amen so the Old Testament they could get the anointing on the body where David could dance he could dance before the Lord Samson could pick up the gates you know he could carry the gates how many miles did he carry how how how's that possible the spirit of God was on his flesh am but the spirit could never get into the soul in the Old Testament because Jesus the Bible say right here Jesus had not yet been glorified the sacrifice had not been yet accepted in heaven Jesus's blood okay but but after and and look at Peter Peter's the best example Peter on on the night of jesus' rest he went up he he he's in front of all the disciples and he said he said Jesus I'll NE I'll die for you he said even if everybody runs I'm going to stay with you and I'll die with you and what happened just a few hours later they all ran away right Smite the shepherd and the Sheep will scatter what happened he's so anointed he got so much so much confidence but then fear strikes in the evil spirit of fear comes in before he was all bold you know he's in the presence of Jesus of course you'd be bold you know wow Miracles and Power Glory Victory but once he gets outside of that and he sees the swords and I'm going to get arrested I'm going to go to jail the spirit of fear comes on now look at him after the look at look at look at him after the day of Pentecost hallelujah look at him now praise God he's going down to pray and he says Silver and Gold Have I None he said rise up in the name of Jesus Christ and the guy got up right there in the name of Jesus Christ look at that and then look at him when he died they said we're going to crucify he said I'm not worthy to be crucified like my Lord so crucify me upside down now church that's real Faith right there amen anybody can talk and say well I'd give my life for God but wait till it comes down and you get arrested or something like that wait till down wait till it comes down till a gun's actually in your face but look at this guy he went from running from Jesus to being willing to be crucified upside down that's the difference of Christ in you the hope of glory praise God Amen that's right that's right now you can see that now I want to show you that verse just so you got it uh 1 Thessalonians I believe it's 5:23 I could be off there I know it's in that chapter 1 Thessalonians 5:23 I want to show you you got three parts again this is what brother Brown's brother br's Ministry came to do point us back to the Bible and show us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise God Amen and church Jesus has a plan for each one of your lives he wants your life to honor his word praise God and then he's going to do miracles in your life he's going to do signs in your life wonders in your life now the amount is up to God right but I want to encourage you there is a supernatural life God has for you praise God am so I just want to encourage you there are Supernatural things God wants you to do just things we can't even imagine but we can never leave just the love of serving God daily right man is do not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God so I want to tell it straight as I can here first Thessalonians 5 I believe it's 23 yep yes there it is okay now look Paul Paul said there's three parts to every person here's where he says it and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole Spirit now that's your mind your spirit is your mind cuz Paul that be renewed in the SPH of your mind and your soul that's your nature that's the inside of the inside at your very core of who you are and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus praise God Amen does that help by God's grace amen amen hallelujah there's three parts now Hallelujah uh this reminds me of Matthew chapter 11 let's go to Matthew chap 11 Jesus even said that he came to give rest to the soul he specifically said the soul Matthew chap 11 I believe it's 29 yes well let's read 28 because sometimes even in this room right some of us labor and we get we get worn out how many ever get worn out Hallelujah and church when you're when you're heavy laden you can come to Jesus and he'll give you rest praise God Amen he'll give you rest I work a full-time job I'm a school teacher I Pastor a church and I got eight kids uh I do two uh before school Bible clubs at school with the kids so sometimes I'll preach five times a week sometimes I get tired of talking my throat really gets worn out and on top of that I got to pay the bills I got to pay my bills I'm I'm the treasure for the church as well we're such a small Church you know all these things there's so much going on on but I found this if we put Jesus Christ first there will be enough time for everything else amen cuz he says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all other things will be added unto you praise God Amen Matthew 11:28 so church if we're if we're worn out if we're tired if we're weary let's come to Christ today praise God Amen bring your burdens to Christ come unto me all you that are labor and are are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon on you and learn of me for I'm meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto what your souls he's talking about the Holy Ghost he's talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul he's talking about this great mystery that's going to be poured out on the day of Pentecost for my yoke is easy and my burden is light oh hallelujah praise God oh my I I hate to think of the burdens I carried as a sinner think about that think of the burdens you carry before you come to Christ I hated my dad because my dad eventually divorced my mom I hated my dad so when I was a sinner I had all this hate for my dad I was looking at dirty magazines had all these lustful Spirits I was watching sports all the time so competitive you know worldly Spirits I was cussing all the time and I had bitterness and all think of all these think this heavy load I was carrying I'm so glad I got to go to that conference so I can raise my hands and and praise God and but I went to that conf is carrying this heavy load and Jesus says come to me and learn of me so come to Jesus and learn how to let go of the heavy load learn how to repent of your sins learn how like learn like the Bible says cast your cares upon the Lord because he cares for you praise [Music] God so that's what Jesus offers today we don't have to carry a heavy load of sin right we can we can repent of our sins and when we repent the Bible says we cast on the Lord he cares for us the Bible says be not anxious for anything that's Philippians chapter 4 right don't be anxious don't let your mind be so anxious or nervous about something but in everything through prayer and supp supplication with God make your request known unto God so when you're anxious pray about it say God you take care of this and then the bible promises the peace of God which passes all understanding will keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus amen oh Hallelujah we have a promise anytime we're struggling anytime we're anxious we have a promise all we got to do is take it to the Lord cast it on the Lord say Lord you take this I I'm not built to carry this you're built to carry this amen God will take our heavy burden and we can serve God the way we ought to serve god with a light load amen amen is Right Hallelujah I like that Hallelujah my two-year-old says Amen to my preaching too Hallelujah Jesus's burden is light the thing is we got to we we got to come to Christ willing to learn we can't come to Christ say I'm always right I got it all figured out I know exactly what's going on I know what I'm doing no we got to come to Christ with some humility amen amen and say Lord could I be wrong on something let me say like this you say Lord I'm probably wrong on something that's what how we need to pray Lord I'm probably wrong can you correct me yes cuz none of us have it all figured out not even the preacher not even the song leader no one's got it all figured out except Jesus right we're growing as Christians we the Bible says grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ why you have to grow in Grace because you need Grace is unmar favor you're going to need God's unmar favor later on down the road when you make a mistake amen you're going to need God's favor amen you're going to need more knowledge yes you need to understand more of God's ways more of God's instruction more of God God's Doctrine more of God's Mysteries so you can better serve God in this world praise God knowledge is understanding we need to grow in our understanding like I always you know learned from Co right we always remember the co years you know and boy I got a lot of understanding from Co I'm like why is this happen where is this in the scripture and the Bible says it it's in Matthew 24 yeah I was like where is this in this why is this happening Jesus said this would happen so I got so much understanding verse uh 6 Matthew 24:6 and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for although these things must come to pass but the end is not yet now look Russia Ukraine you know all these wars well we've had Wars throughout all human history but the next one is what helped me verse 7 for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines like there is in the Horn of Africa right now right uganda's having famine the next one and what pestilences well there's Co right a pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows so see just as a Christian just for you know I've only been a Christian for 23 years you know now I have so much more understanding why where is this in the scripture there has to be something about this well here it is Jesus said for 2,000 years these are all going to increase like a woman's labor pains right they get harder each time but then there's uh there's a little break hard a break I've seen all eight of my kids born so I kind of know a little bit about this a little bit I never went through the pain of course she she goes through all the B but I watched all eight kids be born right they come a little harder each time harder each time well look at co co was a little harder test right isolation quarantines vax mandates the government's getting what it's getting closer to Revelation 13 where they're going to change the money system and you can't we can't buy our sell without their Mark now thankfully God's prophet and I believe the Bible says as well God's going to rescue his bride off the Earth before the Beast pours out the mark of the beast amen that's what the Bible says Revelation 3:10 that's yeah let's read that I love I love how you guys want to read the Bible that's awesome Hallelujah Revelation 3:10 some of you already you turning there Revelation 3:10 and of course this is up this is a revelation brother Brandon brought out that that that Holy Ghost baptism Revelation that's when brother Brandon brought out uh here's another this is the rapture okay what verse did I say brother 10 3 3 ver 10 oh yeah Revelation 310 yeah thank you sorry sorry my mind is thinking of all these vers I could go to which one should I go to so thank you 310 because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which will come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth and the church said amen amen that's red letter words before that Mark can be laid down Jesus says because you've kept my word I'm going to keep you from that hour now no doubt we hear about we we we hear about the world economic system right going towards you know electronic currency and and one mark but that's what Co showed us Co showed the the pains are closer getting closer it's almost birth time it's almost birth time for the Millennium praise God where there finally be a president who's the right president that's Jesus hallelujah amen he's going to rule with a rod of iron hallelujah amen a't going to be none of these Playboys or crooked men like we got today it's going to be a real holy rule by the grace of God hallelujah the son of God Amen so there's a promise church now let's look at another one let's go to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 or four let's go to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 we were just there but let's go back there I'm hitting some of these Mysteries now these are all Mysteries God pointed brother random to the scriptures and shared it with us 1 Thessalonians chapter [Music] 4 now while you're tur there I've written two books I was going to share that with brother uh Levi this is my first book it's just about a modest appearance how women should have long uncut hair women should wear separate garments than men um it's called restoring Christian modesty um so this is like a witnessing book for people who don't understand why do we dress the way we dress how come we don't wear makeup how come we don't wear earrings and all these things so I wrote a book about it um and at the end I introduced brother brandham in the last chapter where' you where'd you get all this brother Jesse God's Prophet that's where I got it hallelujah amen now my second book it was on my desk I forgot to bring it uh it's about the Mysteries that God gave to brother brandom about Revelation 10:7 brother Brandon would speak these Mysteries God gave him and then he would stand behind the pulpit brother Levi and say that's thus sayith the Lord now who do you know that does that Billy Graham never did that John MacArthur doesn't do that TD Jake doesn't do that Joe Ting doesn't do that none of these guys do it because none of these guys are prophets but there's one man who could stand there and say the Seven Seals have now been revealed that's thus sayith the Lord hallelujah amen there's one man that could do that that was God's Prophet just like in ezekiel's day there was one man who had thus sayith the Lord we don't worship the man but the man's pointing us to something the man's pointing us to God's word hallelujah amen because this word is alive hallelujah amen 1 Thessalonians 4 so I want to read you the promise here Church where usually I take my coat off because I just I like to be a little more free by God's grace a little hot in there too verse uh okay so uh in verse 13 Paul says the Christians were sad because their loved ones were dying and and they're like do we have any hope to see them again so Paul gives them Hope Resurrection hope amen Rapture hope amen hallelujah what a blessing verse 14 for we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him amen for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend with heaven I'm sorry from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first if you have a loved one who's died that was a real Holy Ghost filled Christian I believe we may see them be right before the Rapture if not we'll see them in the air at the Rapture praise God one or the other praise God the reason I say we might see them before the Rapture is because when Jesus first rose from the dead how many know that the Old Testament saints were seen walking around the earth Matthew chapter 27 so if we if if they did that at Jesus first coming what about his second coming amen hallelujah amen think about that see your loved ones see uh see them that have gone before us and old pass through pass away or mom or dad and there they are in the beauty of the young age amen Church don't you think that would stir up enough faith for you to believe that your body could be changed amen I know it would be praise God Amen that lift me out of my slumps yes that lift me out of my discouragement he that raised my faith Hallelujah to see the Dead Alive again and then they vanish right out of the room Hallelujah no I'm not going crazy finally reality is coming to me praise God I'm finally getting in my right mind amen hallelujah the presence of God hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen first uh yeah verse dead in Christ rise first verse 17 then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord praise God there's going to come a time brother Iran when we don't have to leave Jesus's side hallelujah amen we haven't even seen him yet we love him Hallelujah but the promise is when we get saved we get to be with him and we don't have to leave him praise God Amen we'll always be with our savior praise God the Lord Jesus let me just let me just put my hands in his nail scarred hands for just for five hours let me just do that okay let me just slip my hand in his side for a few moments said Thank You Lord here's where my eternal life was purchased right here can like Thomas said can I put my hand I won't believe now I'm not I'm I'm not like Thomas but I understand what Thomas was saying I want to see it Hallelujah he Saidi believe if I can see the scars and the side I believe it and Jesus said come look look how look how merciful Jesus ISS come I'll give you your heart's desire church if you want your heart if you want your heart's desire God will give it to you praise God amen amen just come sincerely like Peter did I'm sorry Thomas did just come sincerely what what he really did he really made a vow with God and then God backed up The Vow God backed up God did his part and you know Thomas they call him doubting Thomas but I think if I'm not mistaken he took the gospel farther than any other Apostle in other words he traveled more more miles than Peter to preach the gospel praise God people say D Thomas D Thomas yeah he only di for a little bit he traveled to India to preach the gospel from Jerusalem now where have you traveled to preach the gospel see these preachers trying to put themselves above Thomas don't put yourself above anybody put yourself below everybody let's see how humble we can be let's not see how prideful we can be amen amen let's humble ourselves praise God that's what the Bible says humble yourself under the mighty hand of God and God will lift you up in Du season praise God amen Verse 18 wherefore Comfort one another with these words now if you keep reading here we see the promise that Jesus will not let us go through the tribulation what kind of a man here would let his wife go through tribulation I mean the worst tribulation there ever could be if you haven't read those recently go read the seven trumpets and the Seven vows go read them it it's incredibly awful in Revelation in Revelation we don't want to be here when that happens we want to be with Jesus praise God Amen so that's why we're making ready for it right now Hallelujah am I think I think in the third trumpet a third of the ocean turns to blood I think on the first trumpet all the green grass is is burned up now I looked out there Daniel has a beautiful yard there there's a lot of green grass out there but when that first trumpet sounds all of it's burn up what what what is it going to take to do that all the green grass grass on the earth and that's God's judgment because they rejected Christ but you and I receive Christ you and I worship Christ you and I have Christ in us hallelujah amen so we'll Escape those we'll Escape those wrath we'll we'll escape the judgments of God because we're being judged right now by the word of God hallelujah verse one in chapter 5 but of the times and Seasons Breen you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night night a thief does not announce his coming no smart Thief at least right so Jesus comes when no one's looking for except the bride amen the bride's looking for because the Bible say it later the Bible say later we're actually walking in two different worlds right now Sinners are walking in darkness they're groping in darkness where am I going in life am I going after money am I going after sex am I am I going after popularity what they're walking in darkness but the Bible said we are children of the light praise God in other words we know EX exactly where we're walking exactly where we're going because the light is on thank God there's a man that's turned on the light that's Christ amen hallelujah thank God Amen thank you Jesus we're not walking in sinful Darkness but we're walking in the light of God's revelation of his word hallelujah amen amen verse three for when they shall say peace and safety so the UN United Nations or Joe Biden or whoever whoever the leaders are in these days the pope then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child so there's that idea again Jesus talked about the being of Sorrows right so here's the idea of again the earth going through birth pains and they shall not Escape they shall not Escape we shall Escape but ye Brethren verse four are not in darkness that the day should overtake you as a thief in other words we're going to know when Jesus coming back we have a pretty good idea when he's coming back we won't know the day or hour Jesus said no man knows the day or the hour but the Bible says here we'll know the season of it that's right verse five you are all children of the light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be sober let's be looking for the coming of the Lord let's be sober let's be sincere praise God verse S for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken are drunk in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of Salvation so let's be awake let's be alert let's be on duty let's be praying let's be fasting let's be giving to the poor let's be seeking the Lord let's be ready for the coming of the Lord let's be awake praise God amen amen verse n here it is right here beautiful verse brother Irvin you want to read that for us brother verse n for God has not appointed us to WRA but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ amen this is in the Rapture passage now I want to say this too it's possible Christians could die I mean we see some of our loved ones die sometimes with accidents and things like that and we know there's persecution you know in uh uh what's the Kenya there's a lot of Christian persecution in Kenya Kenya right now um Saudi Arabia you know all these all the Middle Eastern countries so we know some Christians may die by persecution or some type of uh evil attack but overall as a church oh thank you sir I appreciate that thank you brother I appreciate that thank you now I gota be careful not to pound this too hard here so got to control myself so you know we're not saying though you know Christians will never be persecuted because another scripture Paul says uh whoever lives Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution right so there's there's a persecution we get from our friends our family our Associates our co-workers uh on the Internet or on social media or there's certain persecution we all go through whether it's rejection or mocking or making fun of but here we're talking about right before the Rapture Jesus Through Paul promises he says you are you will not suffer my wrath you w ordained to suffer wrath you were ordained to be saved hallelujah amen oh what a promise amen hallelujah verse 10 who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him so whether I live to see the Rapture or whether I die I'm still with Jesus it don't matter praise God it's already been decided where I'm going I'm going to see my king hallelujah amen it's already decided whether I Die Tomorrow a heart attack or I die in a car accident whatever it doesn't matter whether I live or sleep I shall be with the Lord praise God verse 11 wherefore Comfort one another with these words I love this this is a comforting scripture right God's not ordained you to wrath God's ordained you to Salvation that would comfort our family that would comfort your family that should comfort all of us amen we will not suffer God's Wrath why because we believe in Jesus Christ and when we believe in Jesus Christ we understand he already took the wrath for us he was our sacrifice God's Wrath was poured out on Christ and when I Believe In My Sacrifice when I believe in him my sins were imputed to him and his righteousness is imputed to me amen it's a Divine exchange praise God we traded our sorrows we traded we traded our sorrows we traded our sins he took all of our sins he paid for all our sins and he gives us forgiveness back he gives us Mercy back he gives us righteousness he gives us Holiness back praise God what a trade amen hallelujah wherefore Comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also you do all right okay now these are wonderful scriptures now let me um let me share one of them that was really powerful for me uh go to 2 Thessalonians 2:7 we're already in first Thessalonians yes this is one page over there we go 2 Thessalonians 2:7 so really you know so far I preach on two Mysteries the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul and then the Rapture now if you look it up there's 12 mysteries in the New Testament it's very fitting because 12 Apostles right 12 tribes of Israel 12 is the number of government in the Bible okay uh so 12 is a very good number Elijah when he restored the sacrifice remember uh on Mount uh Mount Carmel how many stones did he use he used 12 he had to plac the 12 Stones in order then the fire fell amen hallelujah praise God and God's got to finish the mysteries of God in Revelation 10:7 God's got to finish all those Mysteries then the fire falls amen that's what the Bible says hallelujah the Bible says they got to once that book is open the Mysteries are finished John has to eat the book and then go take it to Every Nation he's got to prophesy to every nation and this messenger brother Brandon is going into Japan right now it's exploding in Japan hallelujah it's floating in Brazil I got a a a missionary friend who goes down to Brazil he just floats down the Nile on his boat brother Levi he'll stop he'll preach water baptism name of the Lord Jesus Christ he'll baptize people and he'll move on to the next place set up a church people love this message because this is a bible message amen amen and it releases the power of Christ in their lives amen hallelujah because Christ comes to live in them Christ in you the hope of glory now I'm at 2 Thessalonians 2: 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way so this in this mystery Paul says it's called iniquity iniquity is lawlessness even though you know it's wrong so iniquity is I know not to steal but I'm going to steal anyway that's iniquity I know not to I know not to lie but I lie anyway but Paul calls it a mystery every remember John in the book of First John said there's already many Antichrist gone out into the world right Antichrist Spirit right so that's what this is Iniquity the mystery of iniquity now when I first became a Christian it wasn't this Bible but if you would let's go to Matthew chap 7: 21 Matthew 7:21 when I first became a Christian I like I told you I was on fire I just want to read the Bible I like the I like I like the Chapel Services but I was W more I was in the Baptist get more truth there but I came to this verse and I thought I don't understand this at all Matthew 7: 21 Matthew 7:21 so this is a mystery that God gave to brother Brandon I've never heard any other preacher preach this before and this mystery is a mystery of iniquity and the Mystery is what Jesus says the mystery is that some people can do works of God with God's spirit but ultimately be lost and sent to hell because when they once they got done doing God's work they would go sin again and live in sin now that's kind of hard to understand but be like a preacher coming here he'd pray for the sick and God would actually heal people but they would go home and he'd be addicted to porn he'd be sleeping with three or four women instead of his wife and then go back and he would he would he tried to repent right he tried and then some some miracle might happen so it's like he rotates between two different anointings but a real Christian longs to live only under God's anointing praise God Amen a Christian will be diligent oh yeah I'm sorry I missed that one a Christian will be diligent to serve the Lord and stay under the anointing of the Holy Ghost praise God so we we we we really have to watch our habits is what I'm saying we can't let sin become addictions we can't let sin become a habit we've got to fight against sin okay so I'm in my college dorm I don't know the message of brother brandom yet I'm just reading I come to verse 21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven I'm like instantly I'm shocked what doesn't Romans 10 say whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved amen oh there must be a deeper Revelation here because I know the Bible doesn't contradict itself it doesn't but what Romans means is anyone who's sincere anyone who sincere and calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved amen amen but here we're seeing people that are not sincere Christians they're not well they're not even Christians now everyone that sayth me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven oh so now now we understand a Christian has to know the will of God and then keep doing the will of God can't fall away like we're talking about preachers right we can't fall away when we get older we got to remain faithful all the time like I was telling Levi and brother Iran we were talking about that Salomon started off on fire if you're not if you're questioning that go go read The Book of Proverbs Salon is like stay away from Evil women Stay Away From Evil women y my my son be be holy be strong all these things and then a few years later what happens he starts marrying all these women the very man who had wisdom fell away from the wisdom now I believe he was saved at the end brother B makes it clear the Bible makes it clear Jesus quotes wisdom wisdom of but he went through an awful time he had two terrible tormenters think of that think about that he had two terrible tormentors because he married all those women that's in uh First Kings 11 if I'm not mistaken God raised up two men to torment him because he not only did he build the house of God he built a false Temple to all the false Idols of his wives think about how could he do that and he's seen the theophany of God he'd seen God in a vision twice so see that's what we're talking about we got to be faithful the whole our whole lives we can't let sin the Bible says lay aside the sin that easily besets us hallelujah amen lay it aside and run the race with perseverance praise God Amen don't let an addiction bog you down don't don't get trapped in addiction overcome it keep praying until God does deliver you praise God sometimes it's your you just got to let it go other times God has to take it away because it's a testimony it's a testimony wow so not everybody that says Lord Lord's going to heaven Jesus says no why because it's the mystery it's the mystery of iniquity workers of iniquity will not be saved because they never loved Christ with all their hearts look at verse 22 many not a few Church many will say to me that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name so that's a gift of the spirit have we not I'm sorry and in thy name cast out Devils I've cast out Devils on about six or eight times I can't remember I always forget the number but I I've had people foaming at the mouth I've laid my hands I join hands and we just pray and they start fighting me they start fight all of a sudden they scream out and then they fall down like they're dead and I'll go over there wake them up and they're like I'm like you're free now it's time to praise God hallelujah then we do praise God I've seen that just like the Bible says that's what happened when Jesus cast out Devils that they they'd fight then they'd scream they'd fall out and then you raise them up and they're well this gospel is real praise God and in thy name done many wonderful Works verse 23 and then I will what what will he say to these people people look they got under the anointing to do Miracles but then outside of church they lived like devils in church they they knew how to get under the spirit they knew how to worship God and get the spirit to fall but outside of the church they let the devil rule their lives verse 23 and then I'll profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity there it is now this is what I learned this is why I was glad I was raising a Pentecostal church and I saw that tongues and I saw the tongues and shouting and speaking in tongues I saw interpretation I saw prophecy my mom got the prophecy she was going to be made well from the cancer that was a prophecy too there was a prophecy in there I forgot to tell you somebody a woman was praying and woke up in the church or she woke up and the Holy Spirit said go tell Ruby Psalm 118:17 you shall not die and live and declare the name of the Lord so my mom had a prophecy and then my dad prayed for her but I was glad I was raising that because I seen people who would who would they would they would have Supernatural things like they would they would speak in tongues but then I watched their lives after service and some of them didn't live a right life that's like brother BR brother BR went to that mishala meetings remember up in Michigan and he saw one man speaking tongues another man interpret and it was exactly right and brother man went up and talked to them afterward said how you doing he said the first guy shook his hand and brother saw a vision and he was a good man the second guy though he said shook his hand he saw a vision and brother said oh you're married to a blackheaded woman but you're living with a blond-headed woman and have two kids he was an adulterer and brother R said why is this what lord I can't understand this and that's what I was doing too that whole time when I was in college I was like what before I heard the message of brother BR what does this mean brother Braham went to his cave to find out what this meant and God showed him what it meant brother man went in his cave and the he laid open his Bible the wind blew his Bible open three times in a row to Hebrews chapter 6 let's turn there yes so the wind would blow it open he'd read Hebrews 6 and say I'm not sure what that means he'd go back to praying he'd move his Bible the Holy Spirit would blow again Hebrews 6 read again the holy spirit will blow again Hebrews chapter 6 now verse four Hebrews 6:4 and this is why church I rejoice in any miracle any miracle I hear that seems to be God I'll say amen I hope it's great but I always watch the people's lives after the miracle because I know what Jesus said if they're working iniquity outside of the church or outside their lives something's wrong amen yet I can rejoice in that Miracle whatever it is I Rejoice how they got under the spirit there but they better stay under that SP and this is a revelation God gave to brother Brandon he preached it and he called it the anointed ones of the end time one of the most powerful sermons I've ever heard in my life once I listen to that I my mind would explode like oh now I know what Matthew 7 means I never understood it till then like it it it hurt me like how could people do Miracles and go to hell like it hurt me like Jesus I don't understand but then I heard God's Prophet preaching like oh it makes perfect sense now amen they just they they partake of both cups but the Bible said don't be a partaker of both cups amen how can two walk together except they be agreed praise Goden you can't drink from the devil's cup and God's cup drink from one of the other praise God verse four for it is impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come verse six if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repent seeing They Crucified to themselves as Son of God aresh and put into an open Shain did you did you catch that they're tasting on God's word they're enjoying they're feasting on this they're feasting on this but then at some point they crucify the word they kill the word and they don't want to obey the word anymore yeah at one time they're feing I love this and God's pow fall and God's doing Miracles but then they say I don't want to live that I don't believe that I'd rather work iniquity I'd rather do my will rather than God's Will and Jesus said those are the kind of people that are going to go to hell how many know how many know though that you're on the road to Heaven praise God Amen Hallelujah I'm not on the devil's Road I'm on the Highway of Holiness praise God so every day I search my life every day I pray every day we seek God and say Lord created me a clean heart forgive me my Stakes every day we should pray forgiving my sakes for each day right but Lord Purge my heart cleanse my heart make me pure Lead Me In pass of righteousness I don't want to be a worker of iniquity I want to be a worker of righteousness amen let's finish that verse did we finish it no we didn't finish it close my Bible Hebrews 6 now before we read verse 7 a modern example of this or an easy example of this is Judas es scariot Judas es scariot was sent out to raise the dead heal the sick cast out devils and on the night of the Betrayal Jesus said one of you is going to forgive me and Jesus never and the disciples never looked over and said I know it's Judas he was a worker of iniquity for three and a half years the Bible said he carried the bag and the Bible makes it sound like maybe he stole money from the ministry maybe remember he had a thief's heart the Bible said yeah on the night Jesus says one of you is going to betray me nobody looked over at Judas because it was the mystery of iniquity he had done all the Miracles they' done yes he had gone on all the missionary trips think about that he done he he'd been he'd been faithful with the finances man when it come down to it Jesus said what you got to do go do quickly he was so hungry for money he sold out the gospel he tasted of the Heavenly gifts he had seen the Miracles he'd seen Jesus walk on water he'd seen Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead he'd seen all these things but he'd rather have money than Christ I don't know about you but I'd rather have Christ and all the money in the world Amen Hallelujah CU money will perish Moss will come down and eat and Destroy but your Treasures in Heaven are imperishable hallelujah amen so think of Judas a scar he tasted on the things of God but then he sold out Jesus for money that's what a lot of preachers do today they sell out this message for their denominational money amen I know preacher this message was brought to my brother Simon took the message to a preacher and he said I I believe the water baptism should be full of imersion in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but I can't do it because I'll lose my pension and you know what happened to him he got Parkinson so bad he shakes to this day we prayed over him we asked God to have mercy on him but he won't come out of his denomination he knows it's right but he won't preach it and God basically made him he took his voice voed down to this loud voice to just a whisper now and he still preaches but he just Whispers he shakes like this all the time no I'm not I'm not making fun of him or anything like that I'm just saying when the word of God comes to you we better believe it we better want the word of God more than money praise God Amen but Judas wanted money more than the word of God that's why I don't care if my church is small I don't care as long as Jesus is there that's all that matters praise God I ain't trying to be big I'm trying to let Jesus be big amen I'm trying to let this word this word is what to attract Believers praise God God's got big churches small churches the main thing I I want to be in God's Church Hallelujah that's what I want praise God brother brand says it's a variety God likes a variety God likes blue flowers pink flowers purple flowers white flowers God likes big churches and God likes little churches like mine too God's like God likes little churches like yours too amen and the church said God loves little churches just like he loves big churches as long as they're faithful to his word amen as long as that they're workers of righteousness amen and not workers of iniquity amen now does that help by God's grace can everybody see that verse 7 now here here's why it happens the the reason it really happens is because Judas had a wrong seed inside of him he didn't he he didn't really want the seed of God right we talked about earlier you got to be born again of the seed of God and the Bible Compares it to like a regular herb and then weeds so I love how the Bible is so simple the reason these people can go to hell doing Miracles is because they originally were the wrong seed right originally God knew they were the wrong seed they were they wanted to sell out God they wanted money and it all boils down to the seed that's inside of you amen that's why we got to pray Lord give me your seed give me your life let your spirit dwell in me fill me with the Holy Ghost praise God Amen verse seven for the Earth which drth in the rain that cometh down upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth the blessing from God okay so good plants get the rain that's the it's the type of the Holy Spirit right we're the good plants we get the rain of the Holy Spirit verse eight but that which beare thorns and Briars is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though thus we speak okay so now we can see the mystery is this there's there's uh there's good plants and then there's weeds both get the rain both get the anointing of the Holy Ghost but watch that watch both seeds and they will ultimately produce what's in their hearts amen give it some time amen I I don't care who it is give each person time they're really going to show what seeds inside of them they're either going to bring forth the fruits of the spirit or fruits of unrighteousness Amen Hallelujah Jesus said how do you know those false prophets by their fruits they are known Hallelujah amen look at a person's life what are they ultimately producing they should be producing Christ amen now it's almost 11:30 can you believe that almost 11:30 I looked over there like what time was it oh my goodness so let me finish up here I better finish [Laughter] up you're sweet people by God's grace the Lord bless you but I just want to share that with you that was so helpful to me because brother I grew up seeing tongues interpretations healings my own mind but I looked at these people's lives and said well some of them live good but some of them do not live good what's going on how can God bless how can God bless that kind of life and I found out this is why there's two different seeds both plants get the rain but each seed is going to bring forth its own God oh Hallelujah let the seed of God Be in my Heart praise God Lord let me produce prod the right fruit of the spirit praise God that's my prayer now let me um let me uh hit a few more scriptures uh how good are how good do you guys know water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ do you know that water you know the water baptism I I read brother brand books on that and I was actually baptized last summer uh submerged I I we would have just I grew up with with just sprinkling okay yes okay great great wonderful thank you what anything else I was I was I was I read that and I was like the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is that that's what brandham does yes brother brandham because they baptized me I was thinking later and I actually went back and listened to the recording because I was like I think that's what I was baptized in so then I went back and they said in the name of the Father the Son the Holy Spirit In The Name of Jesus Christ how did they say did cuz someone they they they did it in the name of Jes they said those but they also said in the name of I baptized you in the name of Jesus Christ okay okay um anyway I I thought about that because I knew and I've still got the recording it was obviously where I came from if I would have done that I would have been totally thrown out sure um but yeah no I always thought baptism was submerging I me like in my heart I thought yes good read that and I was like I like that amen yes wonderful so yeah let's let's show that um came up out of the water let me look up that scripture real quick here I don't have all the Bible memorized okay so it's um came yeah could I yeah I know they went down into the water that's acts 8 I thought there was a one where they come up out of the water came up out of the water there it is yeah yep Mark 1110 there it is yeah what what one you got brother Levi which one you got brother that's actually the same one I was just looking at Mark 110 yes okay yes let's read that one thank you brother wonderful yeah that's a great one too brother uh Irvin with the uh the unic the Bible said they went down in into the water right good very good what's that says both of them went down yes both of yes very good both of them went down there yes sir there still people arguing that they just went down to dip their Cup in and Frink water on top think the B says that sure doesn't it say that John the Baptist he was bapt which he would have been before Jesus I guess but it says that he would have baptized in the river of Jordan yeah that's right but he baptized Jesus and it says here great way coming up out of the water that's right he saw the heavens open and the spirit like a do descending upon yes sir yep so Mark if you take Mark 1:10 and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens open and the spirit like a dove descending upon him so Jesus came up out of the water when he was baptized right and Jesus said it becometh me to fulfill all right I it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness in other words whatever we saw Jesus do that's what we need to do so if Jesus was fully immersed in water then we need to be fully mer and water and also there's a scripture that says because there was much water there uh so you can't you can't I mean if you sprinkle you just need a little water but if you're going to baptize you need much water there that is uh John 3:23 yes and John also was baptizing in I'm not sure how to pronounce that a a aan near to Salem because there was much water there and they came and were baptized also if you have access to a Greek Lexicon or strong concordance if you if you look up the word baptize it means so fully immersed in water my Jewish Bible says the same thing they always when they say baptism it's immersion it's immersion yes sir and that's the word yes wonderful and then the Bible says in Romans we're buried with him into baptism buried that's a good topic for all you Saints good um it says it actually two places Romans 6:4 and Colossians 2:12 we don't have to read them I can read them wherefore we are buried with him by baptism into death okay buried with him Colossians 2:12 buried with him in baptism so Buried buried is not sprinkling in fact sprinkling is only used one time in the New Testament uh think it also goes on to say one of those places to rise with him again yes that's right risen yes sir now you bued with him Rising absolutely that's right brother beautiful beautiful it's exactly right the word sprinkling is only used uh well let's see 1 2 3 4 5 seven times in the New Testament six of them refer to Moses sprinkling the blood in Hebrews but the only one that doesn't is 1 Peter 1:2 it says elect according to the for knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto the sprinkling I'm sorry unto The Obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ so it's a spiritual sprinkling in other words it's an anointing when you repent of your sins it's like God has sprinkled you he's anointed you but the Bible said he wants to baptize you amen hallelujah praise God Amen so sprinkling is that that first anointing you get oh Lord forgive me of my sins I need to obey your I need to obey your commands but eventually he wants to baptize your soul he wants to fill your soul with the Holy Ghost praise God so it all the way up yes Hallelujah absolutely beautiful now have you guys heard the the difference between father son Holy Ghost and Lord Jesus Christ have you heard that I have not I have not discussed that a lot yet okay great wonderful let's need a little teaching that yeah let's do some teaching on that and I have I have I have videos on YouTube about all these topics so I and it's all scripture I put some sometimes I put brother brandom in there and then there's are there are videos where I just address questions about brother brandom but I try to stay mostly on the scripture so people can just find it Bible Bible Bible Bible and you have your personal uh your personal link that we can get to all your videos yes yeah I have a personal Channel and then I have a church channel so I I put all my teachings on my personal Channel I just put all the sermons from our church on the the Church Channel yeah great brother great and that's why I started this I started the YouTube channel back in 2013 so 10 years ago yeah so I've been on YouTube 10 years just trying to share the message this Bible truth that God gave to brother brandom for us thank you yeah thank you thank you okay uh where did I say oh yeah Matthew Matthew 28: [Music] 19 Matthew 28 8 [Music] 19 now this is one of the most misunderstood scriptures in the whole Bible because trinitarians will take this verse and say see God is three persons but that's not what the Bible said the Bible never said he's three persons thank you God is never called three persons in the entire Bible now is it mysterious yes the godhead is a mystery but God never says I'm three different persons yes God never says that so we are not trinitarians the Trinity wasn't even developed until 200 years after John died the TR the word Trinity wasn't even made up until 200 years after this book was finished amen so other words the Bible writers never wrote about Trinity Amen in there it's a it's an addition to the word of God it's adding something and remember the Bible said the Bible Ends by saying don't add one word and don't take one one away like the ends with that in revelation 22 18- 19 and then 200 years later these guys are like well let's call them three persons God never said these three persons would it make sense to say that once they tried to explain God from a carnal way of thinking is when they did that yes ining him by yes sir beautiful brother yes absolutely and brother I looked it up in history the whole at first they only had the father and son they were first they only had two persons I looked up in history it wasn't until like uh 361 that they finally made the the Holy Spirit a third person they were so carnal they didn't even know the Holy Spirit was God how could the Holy Spirit not be God who else could he be but God there's only one God and God's holy and God's a spirit so if you just study the history of it it's all man's ideas injected into the word of God and the Jesus said if you add to this word he said the plagues will be added to you uh in torment amen so I'm not going to add anything I believe everything the Bible says about God but I will not add to the Bible I will not say God's three persons because that's that's going to carry a lot of repercussions in this world or in the world to come amen okay so Matthew 28:19 be it's a beautiful scripture if you just understand it it's it's a beautiful scripture Matthew 28:19 go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you and lo I'm with you all way even until the end of the world Amen now look at the verse how many names are there there's one name he don't he didn't say go baptize them in the names he said go baptize them in the name amen there's one name of the Father the same name for the Son and the same name for the Holy Ghost God in other words God is saying I have three manifestations that's that's the word of King Jam James uses God manifests himself in the flesh manifest means to appear in other words God's going to appear in the flesh and then he's going to appear as the Holy Spirit but it's the same God the whole time so there's one name to the father son Holy Ghost now Jesus spoke this and shortly after that he floated up to heaven right 10 days later he come back down but he come down as fire amen hallelujah praise God he didn't come in a body he came as a pillar of fire amen he came as a rushy mighty wi Hallelujah and he filled the place where they were sitting praise God and then that man Peter got filled with the Holy Ghost in his soul like we're talking about and then he commands them 10 days later to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ okay so let's go to acts 238 this is the first verse I memorize when I come in the message so if somebody asked me what's your favorite verse in the Bible I say acts 238 now it's hard to turn down John 3:16 but it doesn't doesn't really matter as long as the Bible's your favorite book that's what what matters but this verse is special to me because this is the first verse that I memorize once I come in the message acts 238 brother Levi you want to read that for us brother then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah I'd like to read the next verse too go ahead yes br yeah go ahead for the promise is unto you yes and to your children and to all that are AAR off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen hallelujah now we're going to see this later in the scripture but if you get baptized in the right name and repent of your sins God is obligated and he will fill your soul with the Holy Ghost because that's what it's promised to This Promise repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's a promise hallelujah it's a beautiful promise now that's what the churches today have done the churches today the I'm talking about the churches whove Fallen away from God they take the name of Jesus out of everything now it's just Father Son and Holy Ghost or it's mother Mary or they take the name of Jesus out of it but jesus' name was meant to be in it praise God okay so that's the F now I don't know if you know this but there's five times people are baptized in the book of Acts and every time they use the name of the Lord the Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ amen they never use Father Son and Holy Ghost in the book of Acts because Jesus was revealing a mystery that mystery was the godhead that there's one God who manifests himself as father son Holy Ghost it's one God manifesting himself to redeem mankind amen that's right church that's right amen that's exactly the scripture okay uh so let's go to Acts chapter 8 you'll see it again they have this revival in uh Samaria you're probably familiar with it one of the sorcerers Simon gets he almost gets converted we don't know what actually happened to him but he sees them casting out Devils doing miracles in Samaria he gets baptized and then go to verse 16 well actually let's read 15 and 16 so they have this revival devils are being cast out people are being healed and they say these people and all these people get baptized but they're not getting the Holy Ghost yet so they call for Peter and John to come lay hands on them to receive the Holy Ghost praise God verse 15 who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was Fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of what can you say it out loud the name of the Lord Jesus not follow the Holy Ghost because that's not a name it's Lord Jesus Christ that's the name of God have you ever heard that illustration Father Son and Holy Ghost is just like I a father I'm a son I'm a teacher I'm a brother I'm a friend I'm an uncle I'm a lot of things so are you but that's not my name you can't cash a check if I can't cash my checks and say uh son of Ruby Smith they won't let you cash a check like that it's got to have your name on it praise God Amen you can't buy anything without the name and so it is today we can't get God's blessing without using the name praise God Amen that's why some people don't cast out Devils because they don't use the name of Jesus Jesus that's why some people don't get healed because they don't pray in the name of Jesus that's why some people don't get saved because they don't get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen it's the name above all names praise God am that's exactly right amen that's right and church let me just share my testimony I remember I was in those denominations for about uh about a year and a half I was in the almost two years because I got saved I heard the message at the very end of 2001 anyways I was in the denomination for almost two years and I could never get rid of my I chew tobacco I smoke cigarettes I still worship Sports I could never get rid of that because they were just giving me Father Son and Holy Ghost but as soon as I heard the Lord Jesus Christ baptism I stopped cussing that very day I cussed like a sailor for 20 21 years when I heard the Lord Jesus Christ baptism and I got baptized I never cussed again amen amen praise God I never smoked another cigarette I never chewed another uh tin of tobacco once the name of Jesus Christ was spoken over me amen hallelujah praise God amen amen see it's a revelation of that name when you receive the Lord Jesus Christ that's receiving God because the fullness of the godhead dwelt in Christ amen amen all that was God dwelt in Christ he said this is my son in whom I'm well please praise God Amen Hallelujah yeah so now you see Acts 2 acts 8 now go turn a page to acts 10 or maybe two pages mine's two pages verse 44 acts 10:44 well that's when the Holy Ghost Falls um go to verse 48 so you know this Cornelius story right Peter gets a vision he goes to the Gentiles which were before unclean people but he preaches to them the Holy Ghost Falls right on them but they've never been baptized in water yes they're already filled with the Holy Ghost in their soul but they've never been baptized their bodies haven't been baptized in water so Peter commands them I command you to go be baptized in the name of the lordel verse 48 and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord then Terri they him I'm sorry then prayed they him to T certain days okay three examples so far they've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or Lord Jesus let's hit let's hit a fourth one Acts 19 verse 5 now this is actually a really great story uh Acts 19 in Acts 19 Paul goes to Ephesus right in turkey and they believe in Jesus but he he ask them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed in verse two have you rece they already believed in Jesus but they don't have the Holy Ghost yet so see it's a good thing if you believe in Jesus now keep believing until he FS your soul praise God hallelujah it's great to believe hallelujah amen thank God keep believing Saints Hallelujah keep believing he will fill you with the Holy Ghost praise God Amen you might have to wait I had to wait uh I wait almost 2 and a half three years before I got the Holy Ghost after I got after I got baptized the right way everybody T just takes different to to to to die and surrender it takes everybody different times to confess their sins and and really seek God and get cleaned out but God promised to fill you with the Holy Ghost if you get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he will fill you with the Holy Ghost amen he will because he said it now so they're already Believers and they had AOS he was a mighty preacher remember in Acts chapter 18 he taught by the scriptures Jesus was the Messiah he could convince anybody that Jesus was the Messiah just by the word of God but they didn't have the Holy Ghost yet in the soul okay so verse two have ye received he said to them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said to him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost I didn't even know there was a holy ghost baptism in the soul and he said to them unto what then were you baptized in verse three and they said to him unto John's baptism now John the Baptist baptized only for repentance he said who's sorry for your sins who deserves to go to hell who wants to be saved and the people would come forth and John would baptize are you a sinner yes confess your sins okay now you're forgiven he baptized him and that's all they had yet they knew Jesus was the Messiah but Paul comes and says there's a greater baptism there's the mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory amen amen glory there's a greater mystery amen there's more of the Holy Ghost for you they said we didn't even know there was a holy ghost so what'd he do verse four they said they've only been baptized for repentance they've only repented their sins they haven't been filled with the Holy Ghost verse four then said Paul John barely baptized with a baptism of repentance saying on the people that they should believe on him whom should come after him that is on Christ Jesus when they heard this they were baptized in what the father son holy ghost or Lord Jesus or Christ Jesus right righten the Lord Jesus he didn't baptize Father Son and Holy Ghost he baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus praise God so it's a mystery it's a mystery what is the one name of the father son Holy Ghost and this mystery is hidden from millions of Christians most Christians haven't received this Revelation but it's a revelation that there's one God and that God became incarnate in his son and that son has one name and that son is the Lord Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah so I urge anyone today to pray about these things and and here's more of my testimony when I was 16 I got baptized just out of sympathy in the in the Pentecostal church I just I kind of got tired of the youth Minister telling me to get baptized I'm like you know my God he my mama cancer I might as well be baptized so I got baptized from the Holy Ghost but it didn't change anything I went right out to the car later on I'd smoke a cigarette or later on I would and I even played Sports too and I'd still smoke cigarettes it was ridiculous I listen the Dirty music the rock and roll music but when I heard this message it changed everything because I saw the power in the name of Jesus Amen Hallelujah in this in the book of Acts demons are cast out in the name of Jesus Amen people are sick people are healed in the name of Jesus Christen never does anyone ever use fathers and Holy Ghost to do any Miracle to to baptize anyone it's never father son Holy Ghost it's always the Lord Jesus Christ because that's the name above all names all right so I encourage anybody if you haven't repent of your sins and find a river or lake or some Pond or pool and confess your sins and call upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah because that is the name given among men whereby we must be saved in Acts 4:12 that's the name we must be saved under Hallelujah all right now it's past 11:30 so let's see maybe we'll just hit a few more scriptures here you're such a very patient loving peoplee do Hallelujah we'll just hit a couple more here by God's grace um well let me uh let let me just hit a couple more okay yeah let me share some scripture about brother brand and then I'll share some about my life and then we'll finish here so uh scripture about brother brandom um so many I could use um let's go to Luke 17 Luke 17:30 I think this is maybe it's one of the easiest for people to see now to understand Luke 17:30 you got to look up at verse 26 as well you're probably familiar with this this is a beautiful Prophecy from Jesus you know this you know this transgender stuff going on now so wicked so sad this was already prophesied by Jesus 2,000 years ago homosexuality all this it was all prophesied by Jesus right here in Luke 17:26 and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered in the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all now let's pause right there what was happening in Noah's day violence was in the earth sons of God were marrying uh beautiful sexy sinner women that's what Genesis 6 says the imagination of their hearts were only evil continually so whatever conditions were in MO or Noah's day it's got to be today too the days of the coming of the son of man Jesus and also they're eating drinking they're acting like nothing's going to happen they're just living their lives they forget all about Jesus verse 28 likewise also as it was in days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all now look at verse 30 and th even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so in whatever day the son of man which is Jesus in the prophet form right son of man is a prophet in flesh whatever day Jesus the son of man is going to come we're going to see days of Noah and days of Sodom Sodom was male homosexuals that's what Sodom was right it was overrun with male homosexuals right and so Jesus said all this is going to repeat at the end time all this violence all this sexual wickedness it's all going to repeat and in that day the son of man is going to be revealed now that son of man means a prophet Jesus's Ministry in brother brandom now I know it might be hard to swallow or maybe understand but I believe with all my heart that's the truth amen I met two people that knew brother Brandon the first one she passed away uh 13 years ago 201 Florence Humes she's on tape she was dying of tuberculosis she went up in the prayer line brother Bram she never met brother BR you stood there brother Bram caught a vision and said I see you're dying you're losing your weight you're dying of tuberculosis brother bam said I've seen a vision he said I condemn Satan in the name of Jesus Christ he said go weigh yourself next Monday and the Monday after you'll gain a pound each week now usually with tuberculosis you wither away and sister Florence went and did that she believed brother brandom she went and weighed herself she gained one pound the next Monday and the Monday after that she gained a second pound she went on to have four more children so she had a total of six children Hallelujah and uh and she recovered from tuberculosis because God showed brother brand a vision and gave her gave her the power in the name of Jesus Christ and it's on tape you can you can hear the tape I think it's 1955 or 1958 and I met her the other man was Tom Brown his name's on tape too he met brother Brandon he had questions about serpen SE that I preached on earlier you know uh Proverbs 30:20 he had all these questions and he got an interview with brother brandham and he sat down with brother brandham and brother Bram they said hi brother Bram slid a paper across the table and brother Tom said oh thank you he open up the paper on the paper were all of his questions and all of his answers before he even asked a question Hallelujah yes ask gifted Visions amen now in 1965 brother Bram had a vision of the American churches listen dancing to rock and roll in my mom was alive my mom was born in 1950 my mom I asked my mom I said mom was any church dancing to rock and roll in the' 60s she's like no all the church she was Assembly of God we were against rock and roll no church was for rock and roll now you go to any mega church today what are they doing today they're dancing to rock and roll amen they either have rock and roll bands now I believe in dancing in the spirit I dance around our church I praise the Lord like David I I dance like I I dance around the church I praise God but they were dancing to Filthy rock and roll yes and brother Ram saw it and I told my mom I said my mom doesn't believe in brother brandom but I said Mom you have witnessed brother bram's Vision yes right because now every mega church how do they get people people in how do they get the world in they got to bring their music in rock and roll those guitar s those and drums they just bang on the drums that's that's confusion I mean gentle drums okay Clapp and tambourine I love that I love but not like a confusion head banging and stuff so they're trying to lose their heads or something like that it's nonsense brother random saw that in 1965 look it it's he said it's thus sayith the Lord and it's come to pass amen hallelujah the man saw Visions he he he from God but Church the most important thing like I hope you know today the most important thing is that he pointed us to this Bible amen that's right he would He restored our hearts back to the apostolic fathers and that's Malachi 45 and 6 let's read that that's what brother Brown's ministry that's why it means so much to me brother sge brother Levi all these brothers brother John Malachi 45 and 6 now this is a compound prophecy this is a prophecy of both John the Baptist and we believe brother brandom verse 5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children I'll stop right there that was John the Baptist and that is in Luke 1:17 the Bible literally says that John the Baptist fulfilled this first part he turned the heart of the fathers of the faith the fathers of the New Testament to the children in other words the endday Believers right because they were all Paul and Peter they were all hoping Jesus would come back in their lifetime their hearts were turned to the end to the generation that would see Jesus but the spirit of Elijah has to come back though and it has to come back and and he's going to turn the heart of the children the end day father the I'm the endday Believers back to the fathers see the the fathers of the faith long for the children the you know the day when Jesus would come but now we're the children and we're longing for the days of our fathers we're longing for the book of Acts amen amen hallelujah amen we're longing for Lord Jesus Christ baptism Healing The Sick uh see the dead raised whatever God would have prophecies Visions dreams but we also want to live a daily Godly life every single day living the Holiness of God hallelujah amen so those are just a few of the major verses about brother brandom Luke 17 Malachi 45 and 6 uh Revelation 10:7 I wrote a whole book on it brother uh Irvin it's a 800 page book I wrote about the 12 new test you should see it and I'm not bragging I just told my wife I said honey I'm going to try to write write about about brother Brandon and the more I wrote the longer the book got it took me two and a half years to write that book it's 800 Pages wow brother brandham finished the mystery of God he explained all these Bible Mysteries and now the Bible's not confusion now the Bible makes sense and not only that the Bible is alive the Holy Spirit comes makes this word live amen that's right let me just finish with a few testimonies like I said um the first time I went to South America I went four times but the first time I went I was preaching at churches that believe brother Brandon uh when I preached there um I seen the greatest Miracles I've ever seen there I've seen Miracles here in the us too but you know they they hardly have anything they hardly have any food you know I mean it's just just it's third world country try to give them you know food and help them out but they have I'll tell you they do have faith Hallelujah that's all that that's all that matters praise God have faith but I was going to bed one night after meetings I knock on my door uh brother Jesse yes I was already my pajamas they're like uh can you come out and cast a devil out of this girl I'm like I just laid down I was just getting ready to go to bed you want me to cast out a devil I said okay I'd never done it before well I went up to this girl and she's got this strange and all these teenagers around he got this strange look on her face she kind of just strange and I was all scared cuz I tried to cast out Devils before I was just I was meditating all of a sudden church God is my witness it's like heaven dropped down on me and I heard these words say perfect love casts out devils in my mind I'm like and at that instant all the fear left I'm like oh we're going to take care of this tonight now that doesn't happen every day trust me I wish it did happen every day but it was a special time to teach me the things of God and then and then the scripture came to me okay I'm no longer afraid then the scripture says when Jesus wanted to do something he had to get all the laughers and scorners out of the room right he couldn't raise that dead girl until he got all the laughers and scorners out I said sister come with me I grabbed her hand said you two preachers come with me we took her over here where there's no teenagers and I looked at that sister I said you're a daughter of God do you want to be free from this devil and she said yes I said let's pray I said in the name of Jesus Christ and as soon as I said Jesus Christ she started fighting she bit me on the shoulder thank God didn't it didn't no no blood was spilled or anything like that she was just I just I just kept I just hanging on for dear life I'm like Lord Jesus I said Satan the blood of Jesus Christ is against you and all of a sudden she screamed out and she fell down to the ground I Pat her on the cheek a little bit after a minute she got up and she said what happened I said the demons cast out I said you're free in the name of Jesus I said raise your hands let's praise God hallelujah hallelujah so we rais our hands in the whole tussling and everything her glasses got broken I said I'm not going to let the devil get a victory here who's got 20 how I said how much these glasses cost and she said $20 I said I got $20 here's $20 the devil's not getting any victories in this here by God's grace hallelujah it's just I've seen the power of God I was preaching one time too I preached for two hours straight almost like what we got today two hours straight and this man comes up he's got I he said I got arthritis he had white hair I said let's just pray we just prayed a simple prayer I had we had we had a prayer line probably lasted an hour I went and sat down on the seat over here all of a sudden this old guy comes up he T me I said yes sir he said look at me he said I'm Healed I have no more arthritis anymore I said brother I said you go up there and testify he went up he got the mic he said the Lord Jesus come down and all my arthritis is grown look at me I'm walking on over and everybody's clapping and rejoicing praise God praise God another time I was preaching there and I finished the sermon I said who wants prayer a mother come up who had a kidney stone and it was the only time in my life I ever preached without looking at like you saw me looking at my notes it's the only sermon I never preached without looking at my notes one time and she come up there crying she said brother Jesse can you pray for me I got a kidney stone I said yes sister I prayed for her she went back to her seat and while she was singing I saw her start crying I didn't know know what happened we went outside the church and she said brother Jesse I just want to tell you when I went back to my seat I kept praising God and in that moment I felt fire where my kidney stone was and I felt it shoot out of my leg and it went out of my foot I'm completely healed now praise God Amen in 2016 a woman came to our church her name was Marie she I didn't know her she had a blood issue she was bleeding she couldn't stop the bleeding and I preach a message that brother Rand preached called the five identifications of a true church in other words the church has to have the right message the power of God the holy lives all these things and she come up for prayer and she said I'm bleeding so I said well I know somebody who can heal that Jesus healed that all the time in the Bible am whether it was 12 years or 18 years Jesus can heal that praise Goden so he prayed the prayer of faith and she said during that prayer she felt the blood dry up and she and her husband calls me the next day and said we have been praying for years and now the blood is all dried up now praise God hallelujah and I said it's not it's not the point anything to me it's the point to this Bible that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise God Amen and it even works if you have loved ones that are not saved amen we had a young man his name was Austin he came to the church for a year and then he left he went and got into every drug imaginable he would take xanax and cocaine all day he would take them all day and he knew this message was right brother Sarah gay he ran from it for 5 years for 5 years my daughters you saw him on the picture there for 5 years little Haven that little one with the black there she's 11 now for 5 Years From the time she was six until last year she would put a prayer request and say daddy pray that brother Austin comes back and gets saved I'll tell you I didn't really believe God could do it my faith was lacking on that one oh and he came to your church last year remember at the Easter celebration that's right after five years he called me up he said brother Jesse I'm coming back and so after five years The Prodigal returned he started working hard we were rejoicing the very first service he walked I was preaching on Joshua the power of God and you come up for prayer most of the church was out with Co and I laid my hands on his I just prayed I for some reason I laid my hands on his on his rib cage right there I don't know it just one of those moments it's hard to explain I just prayed for him and he said he felt the fire of God burn up and down in his chest run through all of his chest and he said the next day he went to see his mom and they always argued he said he went to his mom's house it's the first time in his life he never argued with his mom praise God the demon of a temper the demon of bitterness left in that moment the Holy Fire of God burned out of him praise God Amen praise God and now today he's seeking the he's not born again but he's seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost God's clean up his life I'll just tell his testimony a month later I was trying to get him some work I was having him paint at our church because I didn't have any other jobs to give him he was just painting I was running out of money and I'm like Lord I need some money and church he had wasted his whole life in drugs for 5 years he was $6,000 in debt and I dropped him off and I'm running out of money to I don't have any more jobs to get him my and run out of money to pay him I just sat to the light there and I said Lord I said you own the cattle on of a th000 Hills amen praise God said Lord could you send brother Austin some money that's all I did I only I I think I might have cried a little bit and I just drove on three days later I get an email from PayPal I'm like what is somebody scamming me someone's trying to send me $1,958 so I I called PayPal I went on PayPal I said is this a scam they said no this is legitimate and some man in the UK I don't even know to this day some man in the UK heard that we had a financial need and he said I just feel led to send $1,958 and I said and my brother Austin he was I I say that as a surprise for him so he come to church he's all discouraged I preached a sermon called John the disciple Jesus loved and I ended the sermon by saying brother Austin I said Jesus loves you you're the disciple Jesus loved and I said look look here I got proof that Jesus loves you and I put a screenshot of that 12,900 I said brother not only has Jesus paid off all your sin debt five years of drugs and sexual sin and depression and he tried to commit suicide three times but God spared him every single time amen praise God God wasn't done with him yet praise God God I said not only has God forgiven all your spiritual debt God just forgave all your natural debt that too praise God amen amen praise God hallelujah and then the the guy who sent me that money saw that I gave it to him I guess I must have announced I don't know if I accidentally announced it on TV and then he sent my family $113,000 and then my computer broke down my car broke down our washing machine for all those eight kids broke down and so I had to use up all that money to buy God was providing beforehand and church I didn't ask for nothing I'll never asked you for a penny I I never ask anybody for anything if I can just for you to repent that's all I ask for you to do but I'm telling you the God of this Bible is alive and well praise God Amen praise God and being raised as a Pentecostal I I appreciated the testimonies like my mom being heal of cancer but I never could understand the Bible but now this message has brought both the power and the word together amen because Jesus said we must worship with the holy spirit thank God and Truth amen and now we can have both as as real Believers let's stand our feet by God's grace now how do you normally run service brother Irvin do you uh finish okay

when you come up for prayer you don't have to tell me or S you don't have to tell any of us the specific request unless you want to some things are so personal you don't have to share the main thing is if there's any sin make sure you confess any sin the Bible says confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that you may be healed sometimes God withholds healing because we haven't confessed our sins Hallelujah and let's all have a just a reverent how how many believe Jesus can meet these needs today I know he can too I know we can look at those hands thank you friends for
