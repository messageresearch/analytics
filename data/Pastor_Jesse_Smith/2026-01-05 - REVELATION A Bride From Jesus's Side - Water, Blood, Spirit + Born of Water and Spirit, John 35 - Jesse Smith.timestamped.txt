[0:03] God took out of the side of Adam a rib
[0:06] and made A BRIDE TO HIM. GOD OPENED UP
[0:09] THE SIDE OF CHRIST AND TAKING OUT WATER,
[0:11] BLOOD, and spirit for a bride,
[0:14] &gt;&gt; for the himself, for Christ. How
[0:18] beautiful.
[0:20] [music]
[0:21] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:23] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:25] [music] this video is to share a
[0:26] revelation that finally opened up to me.
[0:29] I've been in the message for about 25
[0:31] [music] years by God's grace. And I
[0:34] never understood a bride [music] from
[0:36] Christ's side until a few weeks ago. But
[0:40] I'm very thankful the Lord opened this
[0:41] up through the word of God, [music]
[0:43] through waiting on the Lord and putting
[0:45] it up on the shelf until the spirit
[0:47] could reveal it to me by [music] the
[0:49] grace of God. For years, I've heard
[0:51] brother Ram say that just as God took a
[0:54] bride out of Adam's side, that God took
[0:57] a bride out of the side of [music]
[0:59] Christ. Well, I never quite understood
[1:01] it. I'd heard brother M talk about it on
[1:03] numerous occasions, most recently in the
[1:06] masterpiece sermon, which I made a video
[1:08] about last year and preached five
[1:11] sermons on the masterpiece. And even
[1:14] still, while preaching that series, I
[1:16] did not catch the revelation till I was
[1:18] studying on the water and the blood. So,
[1:21] I'm just thankful that God reveals what
[1:23] he wants us to know in his time and
[1:25] season. Now, friends, over the years,
[1:27] I'd heard brother Ram say numerous times
[1:29] that the church or the bride was born on
[1:32] the day of Pentecost. Of course, I could
[1:34] see that Jesus said, "You must be born
[1:36] again." And then he breathed on the
[1:37] disciples and said, "Go up to Jerusalem
[1:39] where you'll be endued with power from
[1:41] on high. receive ye the Holy Ghost. And
[1:44] then the Holy Ghost came in the form of
[1:46] a rushing mighty wind and then licks of
[1:48] fire were over the heads of all the 120
[1:51] believers there. And the Bible said in
[1:52] Acts 2:4, "And they were all filled with
[1:55] the Holy Ghost and began to speak in
[1:57] tongues as the Holy Spirit gave them
[1:59] utterance." But I could not understand
[2:01] how Brother Ram would say the bride was
[2:04] taken out of Christ on Calvary. Here's
[2:07] just one quote that I'd heard before
[2:08] that I believed from 1959. Palmerworm,
[2:12] locust, cankerworm, caterpillar in
[2:14] Jeffersonville. Brother Ram said, "The
[2:16] first thing the church was established
[2:18] on the day of Pentecost, Peter preached
[2:19] the inauguration sermon at the balorette
[2:23] service." I could be saying that wrong.
[2:25] When the church was born, the Christian
[2:28] church was born on the day of Pentecost.
[2:30] I could always see that because it was a
[2:31] spiritual birth.
[2:33] &gt;&gt; Now, the first thing, the church was
[2:36] established on the day of Pentecost.
[2:39] Peter preached the the inauguration
[2:43] sermon
[2:44] at the Bealoid service when THE CHURCH
[2:48] WAS BORN, THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH WAS BORN
[2:51] ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; But here's one quote that I couldn't
[2:55] understand from 1951 at thy word.
[2:58] Brother Ram said, "And as God taken from
[3:01] Adam a rib and made Eve out of it, he
[3:04] taken from the side of Christ and made
[3:06] the church out of it." That was the one
[3:08] I couldn't understand. And so it was the
[3:11] scriptures that helped me understand
[3:12] this. How God took a bride out of Jesus
[3:16] Christ starting at the cross. And this
[3:18] is the main point that helped me. It was
[3:21] a process. Just like a birth is a
[3:23] process in the natural. My wife's had
[3:26] nine children. And each time we see the
[3:28] water, blood, and then spirit in that
[3:30] order. The water breaks. Then there's
[3:32] blood. And then the spirit of life of
[3:35] the child crying out, breathing oxygen.
[3:38] And so that's three steps. Water, blood,
[3:41] spirit. And now I can see the three
[3:44] steps of process of the spiritual birth.
[3:46] Water and blood from the body of Jesus
[3:49] Christ on Calvary. And then the spirit
[3:51] came on the day of Pentecost, 50 days
[3:53] after the feast of first fruits. So,
[3:56] what was confusing me is that it seems
[3:59] Adam's bride was quickly taken out of
[4:01] him. We'd say on the sixth day of
[4:03] creation, but what was stumbling me was
[4:06] the amount of time between Jesus's death
[4:09] on Calvary and the day of Pentecost. But
[4:12] as I studied the scripture, I saw it as
[4:14] a birth process, a spiritual birth
[4:16] process. So now it comes together by the
[4:19] word of God. So I'll start by showing
[4:21] this image. I found some pictures
[4:23] online. So here on the left you have
[4:25] Adam going to sleep and then you have
[4:27] the bride being brought out by the Lord
[4:30] and remember this is just artwork
[4:32] friends and then on the right you have
[4:34] the Lord Jesus being crucified and you
[4:36] have water and blood coming out of his
[4:38] body. Now the actual verse that opened
[4:41] this up was John 3:5. Except a man be
[4:44] born of water and of the spirit he
[4:47] cannot enter in the kingdom of God.
[4:48] While I was studying on this, I read
[4:50] this verse and I thought, "Oh, there's
[4:51] two, water, spirit. There must be a
[4:54] third, blood." And of course, I thought
[4:56] of that picture of Jesus on the cross
[4:58] where you have water and blood coming
[5:01] out. And so, this is when it struck me
[5:03] the water and blood and spirit represent
[5:06] the natural birth of a baby. Water,
[5:08] blood, spirit. And so, water and blood
[5:11] also had to be shed for our spiritual
[5:13] birth. So I thank the Lord that John 3:5
[5:15] opened this up along with 1 John 5 67
[5:19] and 8. So let's read those. This is he
[5:22] that came by water and blood, even Jesus
[5:25] Christ, not by water only, but by water
[5:27] and blood. And it is the spirit that
[5:29] beareth witness because the spirit is
[5:31] truth. And when I preached this, and
[5:33] I'll leave a link to the sermon where I
[5:35] preached this, I showed how water
[5:37] represents cleansing, blood represents
[5:40] atonement. So Jesus on the cross had to
[5:43] atone for our sins. That's why the blood
[5:45] was shed. That means reconcile us back
[5:47] to God, be our propituation, take the
[5:50] wrath of God that was against us. Jesus
[5:52] took our wrath and our shame that we
[5:56] might be his righteousness. And then the
[5:58] water was the washing of the water of
[6:01] the word, our cleansing, our
[6:04] purification.
[6:05] So he needed both water and blood.
[6:07] That's according to the holy scripture 1
[6:09] John 5:6. Then 1 John 5:7, a great verse
[6:12] for the Godhead of God's one person, not
[6:14] three persons. For there are three that
[6:16] bear record in heaven, the Father, the
[6:18] Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these
[6:20] three are one. Notice it doesn't say
[6:21] these three persons are one. Because the
[6:24] Father and the Holy Ghost are spirit,
[6:25] and then the word is spirit as well, cuz
[6:27] God's not talking about a paper Bible in
[6:29] heaven. He's talking about the logos or
[6:32] the visible image of God. And the Holy
[6:35] Ghost is represented as seven fires, the
[6:37] seven spirits of God before the throne
[6:39] of God. That's the Holy Spirit in each
[6:41] church age. And remember, there was Old
[6:43] Testament church ages as well, beginning
[6:45] with Solomon and ending with John the
[6:47] Baptist. I have a video on that if you'd
[6:49] like to watch that by the grace of God.
[6:51] So, we're so thankful. 1 John 5:7
[6:54] supports one person in the Godhead, not
[6:56] three. And then verse 8, and there are
[6:58] three that bear witness in earth, the
[7:00] spirit and the water and the blood. And
[7:02] these three agree in one. So, this verse
[7:04] also helped me along with John 3:5. Here
[7:08] again, you have spirit, water, and
[7:10] blood. Now, I'll put this image back up
[7:13] here on the screen, but I added some
[7:16] labels and caption. On the left, you
[7:18] have Adam sleeping. You have his side
[7:20] opened up, and then you have the bride.
[7:22] So, sleep, side, bride. On the right,
[7:25] you have Jesus was asleep through death.
[7:28] So, sleep, his side is opened up, and
[7:30] you have water and blood come out. And
[7:32] the water and blood had to come out for
[7:34] the soon birth of the bride in Acts 2:4.
[7:37] by the spirit.
[7:40] And of course, the scripture says in
[7:41] Romans 5:14 and 1 Corinthians 15:54,
[7:45] Adam brought in sin and death, but the
[7:48] last Adam, Jesus Christ, brought eternal
[7:51] life. So, we can see how Adam was a type
[7:55] of Jesus Christ. Adam in Genesis 2:es 21
[7:59] and 22 was put to sleep. His side opened
[8:01] up and God uses ri form his wife or Eve.
[8:05] So you have those three sleep side bride
[8:08] and then Christ in John 19 30 and 34 was
[8:12] put to death or sleep his side was
[8:14] opened up by a spear which brought water
[8:17] and blood and that started the process
[8:19] of the birth of the church because you
[8:21] had water blood and then on the day of
[8:23] Pentecost came the spirit of God. So you
[8:25] have sleep again side and then bride.
[8:29] Now later I found this quote from 1953
[8:32] where brother Ram ties in this type of
[8:34] Adam and his rib making a bride with
[8:37] Christ and the church and brother Renham
[8:40] quotes water, blood and spirit. So he
[8:42] quotes first John 56 7 and 8. Now
[8:46] brother Ram's talking about the baptism
[8:47] of the Holy Spirit which is Acts 2:4. He
[8:51] said, "The only thing to do is save
[8:52] yourself from the this generation by
[8:54] looking to Jesus Christ, accepting him,
[8:56] and be born into to God's provided way,
[8:59] the baptism of the Holy Spirit." Amen.
[9:02] Listen, he died on the cross, and there
[9:03] he bled. He was took upon himself the
[9:06] form of sinful flesh. He died in
[9:08] mystead. He was just as God took out of
[9:11] the side of Adam a rib and made a bride
[9:13] to him. God opened up the side of Christ
[9:16] and taken out water, blood and spirit
[9:17] for a bride for the himself, for Christ.
[9:21] How beautiful. And I can say amen to
[9:22] that. How beautiful, brother Brandham.
[9:24] And by one spirit, not by one church
[9:26] membership. By one spirit, we're all
[9:28] baptized. Amen. Are we all baptized into
[9:32] one body and become members of that
[9:34] body?
[9:36] And then he connects it to the rapture.
[9:37] And just as sure as God raised that body
[9:40] in the literal out from the grave, the
[9:42] spiritual body will go in the rapture
[9:43] truly. Hallelujah.
[9:46] &gt;&gt; HE DIED IN MYSTEAD. HIS JUST AS GOD TOOK
[9:50] OUT THE side of Adam a rib and made A
[9:53] BRIDE TO HIM. GOD OPENED UP THE SIDE OF
[9:55] CHRIST AND TAKEN OUT WATER, BLOOD, and
[9:58] spirit for a bride,
[10:00] &gt;&gt; for the himself, for Christ. How
[10:04] beautiful. And by one spirit, not by one
[10:08] church membership,
[10:10] &gt;&gt; by one spirit.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; Are we all baptized?
[10:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; ARE WE ALL BAPTIZED INTO ONE BODY?
[10:21] &gt;&gt; AND BECOME MEMBERS OF THAT BODY.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; AND JUST AS SURE AS GOD RAISED THAT BODY
[10:26] IN THE LITERAL OUT FROM the grave, the
[10:27] spiritual body will go in the rapture.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Truly.
[10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:32] Now, over the years, some people have
[10:33] stumbled at the word bride. They don't
[10:36] realize it's in the Bible. And Jesus
[10:38] calls his church, the Holy Ghost filled
[10:40] saints, the bride. Now, God even
[10:43] promises to call Israel during the
[10:45] millennium, his bride. In Isaiah 62:es 4
[10:49] and 5, he's speaking of thy land bulah,
[10:52] or married land. For the Lord delightth
[10:54] in thee, and thy land shall be married.
[10:57] And as the bridegroom rejoicth over the
[10:59] bride, so shall thy God rejoice over
[11:02] thee. So we have this prophecy of how
[11:05] God will rejoice over Israel like a
[11:07] husband rejoices over a bride. But we
[11:10] already have this promise in the New
[11:12] Testament. John 3 29, he that hath the
[11:15] bride is the bridegroom. So this is
[11:17] speaking of Jesus Christ and the church.
[11:20] And then Revelation 22:17 says the same
[11:23] thing. The word bride, the spirit and
[11:25] the bride say come. And of course, this
[11:27] was spoken during the Ephesian church
[11:29] age. So the times of the Gentiles. So
[11:33] the church during the times of the
[11:34] Gentiles is the Gentiles. So the
[11:36] Gentiles are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[11:39] God had blinded the Jews and went to the
[11:41] Gentiles. So here the Gentile church is
[11:43] called the bride of Jesus Christ. And
[11:46] I'll share two more things here. by
[11:47] God's grace. Also, when I was studying
[11:50] on the water and blood and spirit, I was
[11:52] reminded how Jesus when he was crucified
[11:55] and the spear was thrust into him, water
[11:58] and blood came out. That blood at
[12:00] Jesus's crucifixion represented the
[12:03] earth being atoned for for all of its
[12:06] sins. Because the earth has to go
[12:08] through three works of grace, just like
[12:10] the believer goes through three works of
[12:12] grace for redemption. Three is a number
[12:15] of perfection. So perfect redemption
[12:17] comes by justification, sanctification,
[12:19] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's
[12:21] represented by water, blood, and spirit.
[12:24] So God redeems the earth in a perfect
[12:26] way through the three works of grace.
[12:28] The water covered the earth in the days
[12:31] of Noah's flood. Blood was shed from
[12:34] Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the son of
[12:36] God, at his crucifixion. And the fire
[12:39] will be the fervent heat that covers the
[12:41] earth before the righteous can walk upon
[12:44] the ashes of the wicked into the
[12:45] millennium as Malachi 4:1 says and
[12:48] numerous other verses speaking of the
[12:50] fervent heat. And lastly, while studying
[12:53] on this subject abide from Christ's
[12:55] side, I felt like just some more
[12:57] revelation dropped down as I was sitting
[12:59] here studying. So Jesus's open side when
[13:03] he was pierced by the spear on the cross
[13:06] opened everything or helped start the
[13:10] opening of everything. And what I mean
[13:12] by everything is the following. When the
[13:14] side of Christ was open, we were given
[13:16] access to eternal life because the water
[13:19] and blood came out and then eternal life
[13:21] came on the day of Pentecost. That's the
[13:24] spirit of God sealing the soul unto the
[13:26] day of redemption and that's eternal
[13:28] life for the believer. Next, the temple
[13:30] veil was opened according to Matthew
[13:32] 27:51. That gives us access to God's
[13:35] presence through prayer. Third, the
[13:37] bosom of Abraham was opened according to
[13:39] Matthew 27. This gives the Old Testament
[13:43] saints access to heaven and now New
[13:45] Testament saints go to heaven as well.
[13:47] Paradise changed locations from the
[13:49] heart of the earth to heaven. Fourth,
[13:52] the earth was opened up in Matthew 27
[13:55] when the earthquake took place on the
[13:56] morning of the resurrection and that
[13:58] gave the Old Testament saints access to
[14:00] Jerusalem. The Bible said they were seen
[14:02] of many in the city. And lastly, the
[14:05] graves were opened up and that gave the
[14:07] saints access to glorified bodies.
[14:11] So, praise God that the side of Jesus
[14:13] Christ, the last Adam, was opened up
[14:15] that a bride could be taken out and the
[14:18] Old Testament and New Testament
[14:19] believers were giving access to
[14:21] everything.
[14:23] In closing, friends, hope this video was
[14:26] a blessing by the grace of God. Again,
[14:27] it's another example of how we just wait
[14:30] on the Lord. He'll renew our strength
[14:31] like the eagle. God reveals everything
[14:33] in his time and season. So, for 25 or 24
[14:37] years, I just never understood this
[14:38] until recently. So, I'll leave a link to
[14:40] that sermon in the description. I think
[14:42] it was called There Came forth Blood and
[14:44] Water. It's a good reminder. If you
[14:46] don't understand something, just set it
[14:47] on the shelf and then at the right time
[14:49] and season, God will reveal it when we
[14:51] have need of it by the grace of God. We
[14:53] just want to thank the Lord that just as
[14:55] Eve was taken out of Adam, we as the
[14:58] bride of Jesus Christ were taken out of
[15:00] Christ. Now, we know Ephesians 1:4 says
[15:02] we were in the mind of Christ before the
[15:04] foundation world, but there had to come
[15:06] a time of manifestation. And when God
[15:08] sent us down here to earth, sent our
[15:10] spirits and souls down here when we were
[15:12] born, that's when God started
[15:14] manifesting his thought of every
[15:16] believer. And then he manifested their
[15:18] life as part of the bride of Jesus
[15:20] Christ, the seven church ages. And I
[15:22] just read today how brother Ram said,
[15:23] "The Holy Ghost was the same in every
[15:25] age, the same evidence, the same Holy
[15:27] Ghost experience in every age." I'll
[15:29] just read it out of my book here. And
[15:31] every age is the age of the Holy Ghost
[15:33] for the true believer. I say in every
[15:35] age, the evidence was the same. Those
[15:37] who had the spirit, the teacher, heard
[15:39] the word. And that spirit in them took
[15:40] the word and taught it, revealed it to
[15:42] them. And they were of the group that
[15:45] heard the messenger and his message and
[15:46] took it and lived it. Praise God that
[15:49] we've heard God's messenger, brother
[15:51] William Brham. And the Holy Spirit's
[15:53] revealed his word to us. And we just
[15:54] don't talk about it. We just don't
[15:55] press, play, and obey. We actually live
[15:57] it. The tape worshippers don't live the
[16:00] word of God. They don't gather more as
[16:01] we see that day approaching. They don't
[16:02] listen to the five-fold ministry like
[16:04] Ephesians 4 8-16 says. But the true
[16:07] bride of Christ will live all the word
[16:09] of God. What a privilege that all these
[16:11] things have been opened up to us. Let us
[16:13] serve the Lord in fear, godly fear, the
[16:16] fear of the Lord and holiness all the
[16:18] days of our life.
[16:21] If you have any questions, concerns, or
[16:22] testimonies about this video, please
[16:24] contact me.
[16:26] God bless you and [music] may Jesus
[16:28] Christ be the desire of your heart.
[16:32] I'm very happy to be here this afternoon
[16:34] and again in defense of the gospel of
[16:36] Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings,
[16:39] the good news that Jesus raised from the
[16:41] dead, living among man today, his
[16:43] church. The same Jesus that was
[16:46] yesterday will be today and forever
[16:50] is never failed.
