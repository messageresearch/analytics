[0:00] speaking of tension I was praying about
[0:03] this morning what would you do if you
[0:04] didn't have
[0:06] tension just think of it tension is part
[0:09] of living yeah that kind of encouraged
[0:11] me when I thought that if you had no
[0:13] tension you'd be like a rag doll you
[0:15] wouldn't have no feelings there'd be
[0:16] nothing you could work on like a husband
[0:19] and wife maybe if she wants to do
[0:21] something and they're trying to work
[0:23] together especially Christians and the
[0:25] other more and then when you come
[0:26] together to you find out what she's done
[0:28] she found out see the tension really
[0:30] brings you closer together amen and
[0:32] somebody tells you that well it said the
[0:35] let's think of the little wife it was a
[0:37] lot of tension when you wasn't so good
[0:38] or the little husband W some tension
[0:40] when you wasn't so good then when it's
[0:42] all forgiven look how you feel about it
[0:44] my you just see You' got to have tension
[0:47] that's all and just think of feelings
[0:50] what if you didn't have any feelings no
[0:51] pain or nothing was there be no pain at
[0:54] all you'd have no feelings at all see
[0:57] and if you'd have no feelings then one
[0:58] of your senses to be gone see so see
[1:01] everything's just right anyhow so God
[1:04] just give us Grace to stand up to it
[1:06] that's the thing just stand up that
[1:08] Grace and stand there and say we know
[1:10] that when this life is over the great
[1:12] ones on the other side where we're
[1:14] looking to go to and now we we remember
[1:17] that all these things that attention
[1:20] some people tries to introduce
[1:22] Christianity at you're free from war
[1:25] you're no you're not you're free from
[1:26] tension oh no you add tension when you
[1:29] become a that's right because you was
[1:31] kind of a flop go happy go lucky
[1:34] whatever it was out there not caring
[1:36] what you did but when you become a real
[1:38] Christian every moment you're wondering
[1:40] am I pleasing my Lord if I could hear
[1:43] from him it put your own tension put
[1:44] your on guard that's what makes you what
[1:46] you are so after all tension is a
[1:49] blessing just the way you're looking at
[1:51] it it's just the way you're looking at
[1:53] it see if you just look the other side
[1:55] there's another no matter how thin you
[1:57] slice anything you still got two sides
[1:59] through it so you want to see both sides
[2:01] so tension I think oh my it's what's
[2:04] this tension if I could been born
[2:05] without this tension well if I wouldn't
[2:07] had this tension I would have been what
[2:08] I am I wouldn't have been a Christian
[2:10] perhaps it was this tension that drove
[2:12] me to Jesus Christ see so it's been a
[2:15] blessing thing to me so then as Paul
[2:17] said as though when he had attention or
[2:19] something other consulted the Lord to
[2:22] take it away from him three times the
[2:24] Lord said all my all my grace is
[2:26] sufficient he said then all glory in my
[2:29] infirmity
[2:30] I'm weak I'm strong see long just to the
[2:33] will of God all right I consulted him
[2:35] one time when he used to bother me so
[2:37] bad it scared me and he told me about
[2:39] eight or 10 years ago he said he'll
[2:41] never scare you again and it never has
[2:44] did
[2:44] it worry about it I just feel it but I
[2:47] know it's there but I just go on cuz it
[2:49] don't scare me no more so thankful for
[2:51] that now he could said it won't be no
[2:53] more just as well as you won't be scared
[2:55] any more so it's his will that it
[2:57] happens so I just embrace it and say
[2:59] thank you Lord Lord I walk that
[3:01] way we want everything just everything
[3:05] uh so we can take it easy and retire and
[3:09] take life easy life wasn't intended to
[3:11] be easy life is a
[3:14] struggle anything that's got life is a
[3:17] struggling look at the trees how they
[3:20] struggle look at everything that's got
[3:22] life it's a struggle and when we try to
[3:24] get some kind of a system that takes it
[3:25] easy then we're wrong and we know
[3:28] there's something wrong I listen today
[3:30] of our our television and and programs
[3:34] and our papers and all these things
[3:39] that's going on and everybody's telling
[3:41] a joke trying to get America's built up
[3:43] a bunch of laughter and some kind of a
[3:45] joke like Ernie Ford and all those
[3:47] television stars and to make all our
[3:50] movies is so corrupt it's this could not
[3:53] be anymore corrupt that's all it puts me
[3:56] in the mind of a little boy going
[3:57] through a graveyard whistling trying to
[4:00] make himself think he's not afraid but
[4:02] that's the reason he's whistling see
[4:04] he's afraid and that's whater you're
[4:06] trying the world today's time to laugh
[4:09] it off America is a joke and know that
[4:11] our numbers up she's weighed in balance
[4:14] and found warning if God Almighty
[4:16] doesn't tear this nation to Pieces he'll
[4:19] be he'll be obligated to Sodom and gomor
[4:21] to raise her up and apologize for
[4:23] burning her
[4:25] up right we are doomed the whole world's
[4:30] Doom she's falling
[4:32] apart and there's no way of saving it
[4:35] she's done send away her day of
[4:37] Grace is it possible for a holy ghost
