[0:03] bride of Christ travels the same Journey
[0:06] that Abraham did
[0:09] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:14] this video is to show how the Bride of
[0:15] Jesus Christ walks in the steps of
[0:18] Abraham our spiritual father of the
[0:21] faith according to the scripture as the
[0:24] Bible says we are the spiritual seed or
[0:26] children of Abraham by faith in Christ
[0:29] Jesus
[0:30] as Galatians 3 talks about we are the
[0:33] children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
[0:36] and then Galatians 3 29 says if ye be
[0:38] Christ then you're Abraham's seed and
[0:40] heirs according to the promise
[0:43] so this video is meant to be an
[0:44] encouragement I'm going to show a lot of
[0:46] scriptures and a lot of quotes from
[0:47] God's Prophet brother Bynum that will
[0:49] help us understand our walk with the
[0:51] Lord because it was all foreshadowed by
[0:53] Abraham's walk with the Lord this video
[0:55] is going to be a summary of a few
[0:58] sermons I preached about Abraham and how
[1:00] we walk in the steps of Our Father
[1:03] Abraham I'll put a link to one of the
[1:05] sermons I preached I was a guest
[1:07] preacher out in Iowa a little over a
[1:10] month ago and I preached this sermon out
[1:12] in Iowa called Walking the steps of
[1:13] Abraham and the Saints were truly
[1:15] blessed and so I thought I'd share some
[1:17] of the highlights to be an encouragement
[1:18] to all the saints by God's grace
[1:21] so let's begin by listening to the quote
[1:23] from Brother Branham from does God
[1:25] change his mind 1965 brother random said
[1:28] Abraham met God in many different forms
[1:30] and then he says the Royal Seed of
[1:32] Abraham travels the same Journey the
[1:35] bride of Christ travels the same Journey
[1:37] that Abraham did includes the last sign
[1:40] that Abraham seen before the promised
[1:42] son came and as we'll see friends
[1:44] Abraham met God in numerous forms
[1:47] beginning with visions and hearing the
[1:49] voice of the Lord
[1:50] later he met God in the body Melchizedek
[1:53] then God met him in a vision God met him
[1:57] as a burning lamp which reminds us of
[1:59] the pillar of fire and then God met
[2:01] Abraham just in a body of a man in
[2:04] Genesis 18 then of course Abraham heard
[2:07] God's voice when he was about to offer
[2:10] up Isaac and God stopped him from that
[2:12] offering as it was just a test of his
[2:15] faith
[2:16] so let's listen to the quote from
[2:17] Brother Bynum
[2:18] now in Abraham's Journey he met God all
[2:22] along in different forms and so forth
[2:24] which you could take it and show it just
[2:25] we are Abraham's seed if we're in Christ
[2:28] and Isaac was really his his lesser son
[2:33] he was his son sexually
[2:36] but
[2:37] spiritually Christ was Abraham's seed
[2:40] his royalty his faith now we find that
[2:45] his royalty is travels the same Journey
[2:48] that's bride of Christ travels the same
[2:52] Journey that Abraham did and the last
[2:54] sign that Abraham seen before the
[2:57] promised son came was when God was
[2:59] manifested in a human body
[3:01] the two angels came down
[3:04] next I want to read Joshua 24 2 at the
[3:07] end of the verse the Bible says even
[3:09] Tara the father of Abraham and the
[3:11] father of nakor and they served other
[3:13] gods so imagine Abraham was an idolater
[3:16] serving other gods before he heard the
[3:18] voice of God which was likely recorded
[3:20] in Genesis chapter 12. so here's a
[3:23] simple chart of Abraham's life in
[3:25] Genesis it goes from Genesis 12 to
[3:27] Genesis 25. and the first thing that I
[3:30] want to point out is that Abraham was
[3:32] called by God likely around the year
[3:35] 1920 BC and this is according to the
[3:39] historian Usher and I get this number
[3:42] from my Scofield bible if you look in
[3:44] the middle reference column in the
[3:46] Scofield bible there's dates and those
[3:49] dates come from the historian Usher
[3:52] so I just want to point out Abraham was
[3:54] called around 1920 BC he wasn't given
[3:57] the circumcision until about 1911 BC so
[4:01] I just think it's a wonderful thing to
[4:03] see that the Bible says in Romans 4 1-10
[4:06] that Abraham was righteous in the eyes
[4:09] of God before he even had the
[4:11] circumcision the Covenant of
[4:13] circumcision and so it was about nine
[4:15] years from the time Abraham was called
[4:17] by God until he got the Covenant of
[4:19] circumcision and of course the
[4:21] circumcision was like a seal as Abraham
[4:23] was sealed into the promise of God into
[4:26] the Covenant of god so let's first
[4:28] emphasize that God said Abraham was
[4:31] already righteous before he had the
[4:33] token or seal of the circumcision
[4:36] this is encouraging to us because in the
[4:38] New Testament we know the same is true
[4:40] we're already declared righteous we're
[4:42] saved and forgiven even before we
[4:45] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[4:46] and of course this is getting into the
[4:48] idea of the three works of Grace
[4:50] and now looking at the chart again
[4:52] you'll see in Genesis 12 is the blue
[4:54] color that represents Abraham's
[4:56] justification or when he was saved or
[4:59] called by God out of idolatry of course
[5:01] that's in type how work called out of
[5:04] our sinful lives of idolatry and other
[5:06] sins into justification by faith
[5:10] and so then the chapters with the
[5:12] greenish color chapter 13 14 15 16 those
[5:15] are the years or the chapters that cover
[5:17] Abraham's sanctification in type of
[5:20] course
[5:21] and it would seem Abraham got the
[5:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost in Genesis 17.
[5:26] but of course that's in type because of
[5:28] the Covenant of circumcision
[5:30] and then the rest of his life he had
[5:33] that token or that seal of the
[5:34] circumcision
[5:37] and I want to play a quote from Brother
[5:39] Branham that backs this interpretation
[5:41] up is from Revelation chapter 4 part 3
[5:44] January 8th 1961. brother Brenham talks
[5:48] about how Abraham was justified by faith
[5:50] and then he had sanctification and then
[5:52] he says but God to accept his belief
[5:55] speaking of Abraham give him the Seal of
[5:57] circumcision and sealed him and that was
[5:59] a type of Ephesians 4 30. let's listen
[6:02] to the quote
[6:03] notice how beautiful this is here we saw
[6:05] George the other day watch yours here
[6:08] therefore be justified
[6:13] justified by faith
[6:16] all right
[6:17] second place thanks for being Morris
[6:19] sanctified
[6:23] and then build
[6:26] with the Holy Ghost
[6:29] justification sanctification baptism of
[6:32] the Holy Ghost you see it how's his
[6:35] message justification by hearing
[6:37] sanctification is what you do in regards
[6:40] to what you did in appreciation that God
[6:42] sealed you by the Holy Ghost now you my
[6:44] Baptist brother won't ask you something
[6:47] he said what more could Abraham do but
[6:49] believe God and God imputed the end for
[6:51] righteousness that's all he could do
[6:53] right here he believed God but God to
[6:56] accept his belief give him the Seal of
[6:59] circumcision and sealed him showing that
[7:01] God had accepted his faith amen and if
[7:04] you profess faith and God has never been
[7:06] sealed by the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4 30.
[7:09] if you want to put it down Ephesians 4
[7:11] 30 grieve not the holy spirit of God
[7:14] whereby you are sealed amen and you're
[7:18] not sealed until you ever see the Holy
[7:20] Ghost
[7:21] amen how long does it last till the next
[7:24] Revival on to our Redemption
[7:31] Romans 4 16 says that Abraham is the
[7:33] father of us all in other words we look
[7:35] to Abraham and we see what kind of man
[7:37] he was he was a man of Faith he's the
[7:40] father of faith
[7:42] and so we all pattern Our Lives as New
[7:45] Testament Believers off the faith that
[7:47] we see in Abraham and it truly blessed
[7:50] me looking at Abraham's life with this
[7:52] chart in mind and the quotes from
[7:54] Brother Branham I was so blessed to see
[7:56] how this chart is a lot like my life and
[7:59] probably a lot like your life as well
[8:01] we all have a time where we came into
[8:03] the faith we left our sinful lives we
[8:05] were Justified and then there was a
[8:07] stage of sanctification and then after
[8:10] we're born again the rest of our lives
[8:11] are being born again and we still battle
[8:13] sin we still overcome the wicked one
[8:17] and now I want to point out those red
[8:19] dots those red dots are obvious mistakes
[8:21] Abraham made in his walk with God
[8:24] and yet remember the Bible said he was
[8:26] already righteous before he had the
[8:27] token or seal of circumcision he already
[8:30] had God's favor he was already forgiven
[8:32] he was already a child of God but yet
[8:34] God let him make mistakes learn from his
[8:36] mistakes and grow in Grace and knowledge
[8:38] of the Lord
[8:41] such a great encouragement to us let's
[8:42] go chapter by chapter now by the grace
[8:44] of God so in Genesis 12 Abraham is
[8:48] called out of UR to Canaan and then he
[8:51] went to Heron according to acts 7 verses
[8:54] 2 through 4 which was a journey of 600
[8:56] miles and now we have this thought of
[8:58] Abraham on a journey and we look at our
[9:01] lives we're on a journey serving the
[9:02] lord Jesus Christ whether we travel
[9:05] physical miles or we just go through the
[9:07] battles the spiritual journey of the
[9:10] weeks months and years and decades
[9:12] serving the lord Jesus Christ now notice
[9:14] he took lot and then went to she Jim
[9:17] that was another 400 mile journey and
[9:21] then he went to Bethel for 20 miles and
[9:23] he went down to Egypt for 225 miles and
[9:26] that's where he lied to Pharaoh so his
[9:28] two mistakes in this chapter were that
[9:30] he took lot he was not supposed to take
[9:32] lot because God had told him just to
[9:34] separate himself and then he lied to
[9:36] Pharaoh about Sarah being his wife and
[9:39] notice here's a quote from Brother
[9:40] Branham God told him separate yourself
[9:42] but did Abraham do it no sir brother
[9:44] Graham said God never did bless him
[9:46] until he he did fully obey what God Said
[9:48] do brother Ram said the church will now
[9:50] never go no further until you fully obey
[9:52] what God Said do and this is true we can
[9:55] all think of times when we were saved
[9:57] such a wonderful feeling but do we obey
[9:59] everything of course not we had to grow
[10:01] we had to be taught by the Holy Spirit
[10:03] we had to learn from Jesus let's listen
[10:06] to the quote
[10:07] now
[10:08] he said separate yourself but did
[10:11] Abraham do it no sir and God never did
[10:14] blessing until he did fully obey what
[10:18] God Said do now I'm going to say this to
[10:20] the church the church will never go no
[10:23] further until you fully obey what God
[10:26] Said do
[10:28] you just can't do it God makes a promise
[10:30] Abraham wandered about and so forth and
[10:33] God never did fully blessing until we
[10:35] get over in the 13th chapter of Acts of
[10:39] Genesis and we find out then if that
[10:41] rose up a little fuss between the
[10:42] herdsmen and so forth and God
[10:46] seen that coming on so Abraham being a
[10:49] Christian like he said to his nephew lot
[10:51] he said let there have been old quarries
[10:53] between us because we are brothers he
[10:56] said now you take your choice if you go
[10:58] east I'll go west and if you go west
[11:00] I'll go east just take that's a real
[11:03] Christian gentleman see uh you go one
[11:06] way and I'll go the other let's not fuss
[11:08] with one another let not our husband
[11:10] fuss
[11:12] and notice there's another quote where
[11:13] brother Brandon even calls Abraham a
[11:15] coward and of course that's because he
[11:17] didn't tell the truth about Sarah
[11:19] my brother Ram said this proves the
[11:21] Bible's a Divine book because Abraham if
[11:24] he wrote the Bible would not have
[11:25] included his failures but God included
[11:28] the failures of the father of the faith
[11:30] and now we can see why it's an
[11:31] encouragement we all struggle we all
[11:33] fall short of the glory of God and it's
[11:35] an encouragement for us to overcome our
[11:37] trials and to not quit not give up keep
[11:40] Journey on keep following God keep
[11:42] walking in the steps of faithful Abraham
[11:44] which we know is also following the
[11:46] steps of our Lord Jesus Christ let's
[11:48] listen to the quote from Christ is
[11:49] revealed his own word August 22nd 65.
[11:53] Abraham for instance he's called the
[11:56] father the faithful notice how that
[12:03] that of his own characterness
[12:07] how do you think you would rule that he
[12:09] lied
[12:10] to the king that morning and said that
[12:14] was his sister when it was his wife
[12:16] with right of his cowardly Deeds that he
[12:19] done
[12:21] sort of never done that
[12:24] next we go to Genesis 13 Abraham Returns
[12:27] the Canaan 225 more miles and then
[12:29] separates from lot brother Brown said he
[12:31] was a Christian gentleman because he
[12:33] preferred lot he gave lot the First
[12:36] Choice rather than taking the First
[12:38] Choice brother said remember God didn't
[12:40] visit Abraham again until after he
[12:42] obeyed and separated himself from lot so
[12:45] now in Genesis 14 we're going to see how
[12:47] God visits Abraham again
[12:49] Abraham delivers lot after traveling 160
[12:52] miles and then he meets Melchizedek on
[12:55] the return from Kanan again seeing God
[12:57] in a new form he never seen this form
[12:59] before and that's how we experience God
[13:02] as well as the years pass we see God
[13:04] minister in new forms God Appears to us
[13:07] in new forms new testimonies new
[13:09] experiences new dreams New Visions new
[13:12] words from the Lord new relationships so
[13:15] we thank God for his continual
[13:17] revelation of himself to us
[13:19] in Genesis 15 God confirms his Covenant
[13:22] with Abraham and this is a great
[13:24] encouragement that God will visit you
[13:26] again after you obey despite your
[13:28] failures again we here we see God's
[13:31] unconditional Covenant and friends this
[13:33] is the beautiful part God's covenant is
[13:35] unconditional because he's the one that
[13:37] will keep the Covenant as you can see in
[13:39] Abraham's life and other people's lives
[13:41] like Moses and David all the Believers
[13:44] fail the Covenant from time to time they
[13:46] all fall short of God's glory but God is
[13:49] the one who gives the unconditional
[13:51] Covenant because God chose his servants
[13:53] you and I and all these Old Testament
[13:56] Saints before the foundation of the
[13:58] world God is going to bring his promises
[14:00] and his plan to pass because it's for
[14:03] his own good pleasure
[14:05] and also Abraham chewing away the birds
[14:08] brother Graham said was a type of
[14:10] Abraham casting out Devils it's a type
[14:12] of the New Testament Church where Jesus
[14:14] said these signs shall follow them to
[14:16] believe in Mark 16 they shall cast out
[14:18] devils and notice he was doing this
[14:20] before he got the token of circumcision
[14:22] and this proves you can have a gift of
[14:24] God a spiritual gift to do signs wonders
[14:26] of Miracles and operate in that gift
[14:28] before you're even born again
[14:31] so one day God was talking to Abraham
[14:34] and he said Abraham I'm going to confirm
[14:36] this I'm going to I'm going to give you
[14:38] a sign God always gives time
[14:41] these signs shall follow them that
[14:44] believe
[14:45] they shall Shake into the pastor and put
[14:47] their name on the book
[14:49] that might be an almanac but not in the
[14:51] Bible see that's right yeah these times
[14:54] shall follow them at least in my name
[14:56] they shall cast out Devils they shall
[14:58] speak with new tongues if they should
[15:00] take up a serpent and drink a daily
[15:01] thing we're not harm them if they lay
[15:03] their hands on the sick they shall
[15:04] recover
[15:05] sign shall follow believers
[15:08] that hands laid on that believer that
[15:10] believer says amen I'm Abraham's seed I
[15:13] believe it and it works all right comes
[15:16] to pass
[15:17] now
[15:18] these signs that Abraham said to God how
[15:22] will I know this he said Abraham go get
[15:25] me a she goat and a heifer and a ram
[15:28] make a sacrifice and Abraham cut him
[15:31] apart killed him put him apart took a
[15:33] turtle dove and a young pigeon and
[15:35] throwed it in and made him and made a
[15:38] sacrifice unto the Lord
[15:41] and what he did he waited there and kept
[15:44] the birds off the food until the sun was
[15:48] going down
[15:51] we go to Genesis 16 and chapter Abraham
[15:54] takes Hagar that's a red dot that's a
[15:56] mistake and then ishmael's born now
[15:59] notice God never left him God never
[16:01] forsook him God never quit on him there
[16:04] was so much more that was going to
[16:05] happen in Abraham's life he just had to
[16:07] keep trusting God repenting obeying God
[16:10] seeking God and God would bring his
[16:13] perfect will to pass in Abraham's life
[16:15] as Abraham learned to submit and obey
[16:18] the voice of God
[16:20] in chapter 17 we see a type of the
[16:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost but first
[16:25] Abraham gets the revelation of El
[16:27] Shaddai and then he gets the
[16:29] circumcision Covenant which is a type of
[16:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[16:33] some people forget in this chapter that
[16:35] Abraham himself laughed at God when God
[16:38] said he would have seed through Sarah
[16:40] and friends what observation this is a
[16:43] prophet of God could have such unbelief
[16:45] that he would laugh at a thus saith the
[16:48] Lord he would laugh at the word of God
[16:50] because he didn't think it was possible
[16:51] but again this shows God's mercy to
[16:53] Abraham it shows God's mercy to us
[16:56] when we doubt things when we doubt
[16:58] whether God could do something
[16:59] Supernatural God never forsook Abraham
[17:02] God never rejected Abraham but what God
[17:06] did do is prove his word to Abraham God
[17:08] is always proving his word just like God
[17:11] will prove his word to us over and over
[17:13] again
[17:14] then we go to Genesis 18 we see the Lord
[17:16] appears to Abraham here in another form
[17:18] not Melchizedek but just God in a flesh
[17:21] body and the Lord appeared to Sarah of
[17:23] course with the two Messengers the two
[17:25] angelic Messengers and this is the last
[17:27] sign Abraham and surrogate before the
[17:30] arrival of Isaac the promised son of
[17:32] course this is the type of the ministry
[17:35] of brother Branham it was Jesus Christ
[17:37] in brother Branham now friends this is
[17:40] not a perfect type in Genesis 18 it was
[17:42] God in a human body and that human body
[17:45] was never born never died brother
[17:47] Randolph said God just borrowed the
[17:49] potash calcium and all the elements that
[17:51] make up the human body and then after
[17:52] God left God put those elements back to
[17:55] the Earth that's not the same as brother
[17:56] Branham brother bran was born a sinner
[17:58] he said LeBron said he was a sinner
[18:00] saved by grace he was not fit to live
[18:02] and he wasn't saying that to be humble
[18:04] so this is not a perfect type God and
[18:06] flesh in Genesis 18 was not a perfect
[18:09] type in brother random's life because
[18:11] brother bran was a sinner Say by grace
[18:12] in any sensible person could accept that
[18:15] only people that worship brother Branham
[18:18] would reject that and then in Genesis 18
[18:20] we see Sarah lies to God and brother
[18:23] tells us God couldn't destroy Sarah for
[18:26] lying to his face calling out a liar
[18:27] because she was a part of Abraham and
[18:29] again this shows the grace and mercy of
[18:31] God think of all the times we've
[18:33] disobeyed the Holy Spirit we made a
[18:36] mistake we've disobeyed the word of God
[18:37] and yet God doesn't destroy us because
[18:39] we're part of the promise we're part of
[18:41] Christ
[18:42] as brother Brandon said we're Spirit of
[18:43] Christ's spirit
[18:45] then we see Abraham interceding for lot
[18:47] this is of course the prayer life of
[18:49] Abraham which we should have we should
[18:51] have a prayer life where we intercede
[18:52] for the foolish Virgin of course for the
[18:54] bride and of course for all men the
[18:56] Bible said Paul said pray for all men
[18:58] and before moving on remember brother
[19:00] Brown said six times thus saith the Holy
[19:02] Spirit his discernment Ministry was the
[19:05] last sign to the Gentiles before the
[19:06] Rapture and there would be no greater
[19:09] gift given to the Gentiles to see before
[19:11] the Rapture than this gift of
[19:13] discernment God gave to brother Branham
[19:15] that has stood the test of time that's
[19:17] undeniable let's listen to the quote
[19:19] and remember Abraham and his group never
[19:23] receive one more sign from God until the
[19:26] promised Sun arrives how many knows
[19:28] that's true that sign of discernment and
[19:30] the Royal Seed of Abraham let me hear
[19:33] you let me tell you thus saith the Lord
[19:36] you're receiving your last sign
[19:40] that's according to the scriptures
[19:42] and the revelation of God that's in my
[19:44] heart that speaks that this is the truth
[19:47] and I trust that you will believe it to
[19:50] be the truth
[19:51] now I'm just going to quickly go through
[19:53] Genesis 19 through 25 Sodom is destroyed
[19:56] in Genesis 19 and Genesis 20 Abraham and
[19:59] abimelech meet at Greer that's a 40-mile
[20:02] journey for Abraham and of course this
[20:04] is when Abraham lied to abimelech
[20:07] and yet God still favored Abraham
[20:10] because he was the more righteous man he
[20:11] was the father of faith and abimelech
[20:13] had to have Abraham pray for him that he
[20:16] could be blessed again but we still see
[20:19] a shortcoming of Abraham now if you're
[20:21] counting the red dots that's six
[20:22] shortcomings
[20:23] and then in Genesis 21 Isaac is born
[20:26] which is a type of the Rapture Hagar's
[20:28] cast out and then he goes back to
[20:31] Beersheba then in Genesis 22 Abraham
[20:34] travels 55 miles to offer Isaac and of
[20:36] course God spares Isaac like God spared
[20:39] Abraham's seed us and a ram died in our
[20:42] place the Lord Jesus Christ died in our
[20:44] place all glory to God
[20:46] in Genesis 23 Sarah dies in Genesis 24
[20:49] Elise or gets Rebecca another type of
[20:52] the Rapture so there's another example
[20:54] of brother Branham in the life of
[20:56] Abraham
[20:57] so we see brother Ram's Ministry in
[20:58] Genesis 18 the Lord Discerning the
[21:01] thoughts and Tents of the heart to
[21:02] Abraham and Sarah then we see Brothers
[21:04] ministry as Eliezer to go get Rebecca
[21:07] brother and of course taught this he was
[21:09] at a difficult time in his ministry and
[21:11] he said Lord there must be some place in
[21:12] the Bible where my Ministry is he said
[21:15] I'm just going to open your Bible and
[21:16] point
[21:17] and let it be a verse that speaks to me
[21:19] and of course it was Genesis 24
[21:22] brother random saw himself as the
[21:24] faithful servant to get a bride for
[21:26] Christ let's listen to the quote from
[21:28] Brother Bradham
[21:32] [Applause]
[21:34] this that some character in there that
[21:36] you dealt with
[21:38] would be on the same basis that would be
[21:40] my question if somebody done something
[21:42] and you gonna ask him about it then let
[21:45] me turn to that place survival and if
[21:47] somebody whatever they've done it'll
[21:49] leaned my way where I've done wrong or
[21:52] something you want me to do or haven't
[21:53] done let me see some character in the
[21:56] Bible I cannot close my eyes you said
[21:58] the Bible I'll fall off and put my
[21:59] finger on a scripture the chance to 24
[22:01] 7.
[22:03] Ella easer
[22:04] Abraham's faithful servant the model
[22:07] server of the Bible
[22:08] being sent to hunt the bride
[22:12] for Isaac chills run over me
[22:16] sure that's my that's right with the
[22:18] rest of my message pulling out the body
[22:20] said swear that you will not take a
[22:22] bride out of these
[22:23] but go to my own people
[22:26] he said what if the woman won't come
[22:27] with me said then you're free at this
[22:28] old
[22:30] he said
[22:31] and the god
[22:33] well of heaven will send his Angel
[22:35] before you
[22:36] to Direction he went right straight out
[22:39] began praying and he met the beautiful
[22:41] Rebecca that become the Bride of Isaac
[22:45] it's the perfect message back to the
[22:47] word
[22:49] go get that brat
[22:51] that's a duty that's what I'm here for
[22:53] that's what I'm trying to do is call out
[22:55] a bride
[22:57] then in Genesis 25 Abraham Weds Katura
[23:01] and he dies in Hebron which was a
[23:03] 30-mile journey
[23:05] so again there's many things we can see
[23:07] from Abraham's life think of all the
[23:09] miles he traveled think of all the
[23:11] journeys he went on he kept believing
[23:13] God he kept trusting and thus saith the
[23:15] Lord despite his failures he kept
[23:17] repenting and serving the lord exactly
[23:19] what we should do we should walk in the
[23:21] steps of faithful Abraham
[23:24] I want to start bringing this down to a
[23:26] close and add some quotes from Brother
[23:27] Branham this has always been a blessing
[23:29] to me and works as Faith expressed in
[23:31] 1965 brother random said every time he
[23:33] got feeling a little blue he turned to
[23:35] Romans chapter four and he'd read how
[23:37] Abraham was not weak in faith
[23:40] any staggered not at the promise of God
[23:42] but was strong in faith giving God glory
[23:45] so friends think of this every time
[23:47] brother Branham has a prophet felt
[23:48] discouraged he went to the life of
[23:50] Abraham to encourage himself so next
[23:52] time you're battling depression the next
[23:54] time you're battling self-pity you're
[23:57] feeling blue feeling sad listen to see
[23:59] if the Holy Spirit might direct you to
[24:01] go read Romans chapter four like the
[24:03] Holy Spirit directed brother Branham to
[24:06] go read he said every time I go to
[24:08] feeling a little blue let's listen to
[24:09] the quote
[24:11] listen to this now who against hope
[24:15] against hope all hopes is gone
[24:20] oh every time I go feel a little blue
[24:22] here's the chapter I turn to Romans 4.
[24:25] I think
[24:26] who against hope lead and hope that he
[24:29] might become the father of Nations
[24:31] according to that which is spoken so
[24:33] shall thy seed be now listen 19th verse
[24:36] and be not weak in faith he considered
[24:39] not his own body now dead
[24:43] when he was about a hundred years old
[24:44] neither the deadness of Sarah's womb he
[24:47] staggered out the promise of God through
[24:49] unbelief but was strong giving glory to
[24:52] God
[24:55] and then also I love this quote perfect
[24:56] strength by Perfect weakness November
[24:59] 1961. brother said Romans 4 is the
[25:02] Divine commentary of the life of Abraham
[25:04] we know Abraham many times got kind of
[25:07] frustrated like we do but when his
[25:09] commentary was written there wasn't any
[25:11] of his frustrations mentioned
[25:13] never mention them at all Abraham
[25:16] staggered not at the promise of God the
[25:18] ram said I hope mine will be rode up
[25:21] there there's no mistakes in brother
[25:23] Brown's commentary from God about his
[25:26] life he said may it be just what I tried
[25:28] to do the intention of my heart to do
[25:30] for God's people and friends this is
[25:33] absolutely biblical if Abraham's
[25:36] mistakes and failures are not recorded
[25:38] in heaven neither will ours because
[25:40] we're under the blood of Jesus Christ
[25:42] which speaks better things than the
[25:44] blood of bulls and goats of the Old
[25:45] Testament and of course we have many
[25:47] scriptures to back it up just read the
[25:49] entire chapter of Romans 8. there's no
[25:52] condemnation to us because we're in
[25:53] Christ Jesus no one can lay anything to
[25:56] our charge if God is for us who can be
[25:58] against us nothing shall separate us
[26:01] from the love of Jesus Christ let's
[26:03] listen to the quote
[26:05] I was reading
[26:07] over in the book of of Romans the fourth
[26:10] chapter where Paul uh wrote the the
[26:15] Divine commentary of the life of Abraham
[26:18] now we know that Abraham many times got
[26:22] kind of frustrated like we do but when
[26:25] the his commentary was written there
[26:27] wasn't any of his frustrations mentioned
[26:29] anything I never mentioned him at all
[26:31] said Abraham staggered not the promise
[26:34] of God through unbelief but with strong
[26:36] given praise to God see and that's why I
[26:40] hope mine be wrote up there is not my
[26:44] mistakes and everything but just the
[26:46] what I tried to do the intention of my
[26:48] heart to do for God's people
[26:52] I remember friends Colossians 1 22 also
[26:55] says Christ has made us unreprovable
[26:58] blameless without spa and blemish we
[27:01] could not be any more clean any more
[27:03] forgiven
[27:04] any more pure any more sinless in the
[27:07] eyes of God than what we already are
[27:09] because of the blood of Jesus Christ and
[27:12] our simple faith in the blood of Christ
[27:13] as Romans 3 25 says whom God is set
[27:18] forth to be a propitiation through faith
[27:20] in his blood Hallelujah
[27:22] that's what our faith is in the blood of
[27:24] Jesus Christ our faith is not in our
[27:27] works we're not saved by our works for
[27:29] no man shall boast of their Works
[27:31] according to Ephesians 2 verses 8-10
[27:34] what is the blood of Jesus Christ that
[27:36] makes us holy and our faith is in the
[27:39] blood of Jesus Christ also another
[27:42] scripture is First John 3 9 this shows
[27:45] the power of the seed of the Holy Ghost
[27:47] the Bible said whosoever is born of God
[27:50] doth not commit sin for his seed
[27:52] remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[27:54] because he is born of God so every
[27:57] spiritual Seed of Abraham with the
[27:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost has the seed
[28:01] of God in him it's a spiritual seed now
[28:03] which makes us the Seed of Abraham
[28:05] because our faith is in Christ
[28:08] and that seed that Holy Ghost in US
[28:10] cannot sin and never can sin so there's
[28:14] a part of us that has not sinned and
[28:16] never has sinned but yet there's a part
[28:18] of us that sins every day that's our
[28:20] flesh and our mind
[28:22] but the soul that is Born Again of the
[28:23] Holy Ghost has never sinned and will
[28:26] never sin because it's a part of God's
[28:29] Own eternal life we also see this is
[28:31] true in First Peter 1 verse 23 we're
[28:35] born again of The Incorruptible seed the
[28:37] word of God so when a person is born
[28:39] again the Holy Ghost comes into their
[28:41] soul that Holy Ghost and their soul is
[28:43] like a seed the Bible says and that seed
[28:46] cannot sin because that seed is a part
[28:49] of God and this is the power of
[28:51] Abraham's seed which is Christ
[28:54] in closing friends I hope this video was
[28:56] a blessing it was a blessing studying
[28:58] this preaching this the quotes that
[29:00] brother Branham did so much to
[29:01] understand the life of Abraham so again
[29:03] we thank the Lord for sending us
[29:04] faithful servant the Lord's true Prophet
[29:06] brother William Branham hope this video
[29:08] was a blessing hope it was an
[29:10] encouragement if you have any questions
[29:11] concerns or testimonies about this video

[29:16] Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
