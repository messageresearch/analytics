TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's see if that okay I'd like to preach uh this evening on the three works of Grace uh you know like I told you there's many subjects I like to preach on maybe just to uh just because I love you so much and uh I want you to know as much of the message as you can by God's grace as fast as you can but I know God doesn't work like that you know God works in times and Seasons you know but I just I just have a burden I love you so much I want you to know as much of the word of God as you possibly can in as a short amount of time as possible so we love you in the Lord uh let's go to uh Ezekiel 36 uh 26 and 27 and then we'll read Mark 4:28 now I know I preached here before on the baptism of the Holy Ghost this message is closely connected to that and uh uh I think you'll be blessed tonight you know I do want to apologize I left my Bible at home I was in a rush to get out does anybody got a extra Bible uh by God's grace oh you know I can actually use my phone y sorry oh there's one in here okay used to be I think they're just song books that's okay you I can use my uh that's okay I can use my phone I forgot about that I apologize you know when I go on different trips sometimes I forget my Bible and um oh thank you Sarah all right well thank you sister I appreciate that hallelujah oh yes beautiful Bible here oh yes praise the Lord amen Ezekiel 36:26 this will be I believe a helpful message um there's many ways it applies to us as Believers and it's especially important oh and our sister even has this highlighted in her Bible praise the lord well that work look it's all in blue right there that's a that's a good sign right there we got two witnesses amen Witness here and witness here that I felt led the Lord I was praying in my closet this morning I thought Lord what could I teach this people how could I help your people I just kind of felt this thought about the three works of Grace so I just uh I'm just trying to go with the leading of the Lord here tonight I sure appreciate that uh verse 26 and let's read it together let's read 26 together and 27 I like to hear your voice so we can read maybe two verses there together out loud let's begin on three 1 2 3 he a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of Flesh verse 27 and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them amen of course this is Ezekiel uh if I'm not mistaken this is about uh 500 or so years before Christ and he's prophesying about how how is he going to help Israel how is God going to help Israel he's got to give them a new heart a new spirit and then he's got to put his Spirit within them in order for them to do the word of God hallelujah so we know we can do the word of God once we have God's spirit inside of us because that's the power inside of the believer how many know that by God's grace amen let's have one more word of prayer if you would let just bow our hearts here father God we're thankful to be here tonight thank you for safe travel on the roads Lord thank you that your people your Junction City Saints can uh make it Lord safe travel as well thank you that they're sound in body sound in Mind and Spirit Lord God we're grateful for that I pray God you just take these mortal lips of clay Lord in my mind just Lord bring the scriptures to my mind that could help the people here and father I pray you'd be glorified here today uh Lord that you might be magnified and Lord that you give understanding Lord to to your people God I know it'll bless them I know it'll help them it'll strengthen them Lord as it helps me and so father we want to thank you for tonight Lord just guide this sermon For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated there praise God all right so I do want to of course I want to thank uh you know uh brother Irvin for letting me come come here and uh help out this summer also want to thank uh Ruth and Sarah for opening up their home and brother uh Daniel on the Psalms can we give them Round of Applause we appreciate all them by God's grace Hallelujah we always want to appreciate everybody who has a burden you know to uh play a part and you all do it by coming of course but you know I just like to recognize people that you know do these things and we're grateful by the grace of God for them so it looks like that's going to work okay praise the Lord uh I see I got three more times including tonight to preach to you for the summer by God's grace I got two more if you got any topics let me know afterwards or pray about it and text me you know after tonight we got two more topics if there's one you know certain topic You' like me to address or just do an overview on numerous topics I can do that like I'd love to show you marriage and divorce brother mam gave it to us thus sayith the Lord I'd love to show you the New Jerusalem you know the future home uh there's so many topics I'd like to preach to you by God's grace so that you're heard it from the word of God and God's Prophet you know I like to I like to just uh do that by God's grace so you know tonight I felt this was important so I trust the Lord will guide us here uh by the holy spirit so the the three works of Grace uh raise your hand if this is kind of a new subject to you okay okay a lot of hands up okay great well then this will be good by God's grace um in other words there's three works or three steps God has to take you to to fill you with the Holy Ghost and it's it's all throughout the New Testament praise God and I'm going to show you there's five examples in the New Testament I mean anyone that denies this would have to deny the Bible they would have to deny the written word of God in order to deny this but let me tell you most churches do deny this so that proves uh most churches are deceived Jesus said few there be that find the narrow road that leads to eternal life how many remember that Matthew 7:14 very few people will find that Road and I'm going to I I'll close with that thought by God's grace now you read this from Ezekiel ezekiel's prophesying I love the next chapter the next chapter is the valley of dry bones amen that's the 144,000 Hallelujah God's going to bring these dead bones he's going to bring them back to life Hallelujah and Israel finally recognized their Messiah that's Ezekiel chapter 37 Hallelujah but 36 is speaking of the three works of Grace all right that God was sending to Israel now most of Israel would turn it down so God would blind Israel but there were some Jews that did receive this like Paul Peter James and John Bartholomew all those Mary the mother of Jesus all those saints that were in the upper room they receive this scripture and I'll tell you tonight you can receive it as well Hallelujah that's why you're here tonight Hallelujah because you want to receive this if you haven't already some of you probably have I've heard your testimony some of you have some of you believe that you have the Holy Ghost in your your soul Hallelujah and that's wonderful but this is Brother Ram's thought you know there's a new heart brother ram calls that justification right and justification means God has declared you righteous that's the first step you're saved right you're justified by faith the Bible says Romans chapter 5 and uh numerous verses in Romans and then of course Ephesians 2 8-10 we are saved by grace through faith not of Works lest any man should boast hallelujah we're saved by grace when we repent of our sins and we trust in Jesus Christ's righteousness we are saved we are Justified Hallelujah and then that's the first step that's a new heart God gives you a new heart the Bible said here plainly before you were a Christian you had a Stony heart you know nobody could tell you anything about the word of God right you were living in sin uh we are living in sin we didn't want to hear about the word of God I'd I'd sit in church like this like come on preacher when are you going to like my head would be down the whole time when and now I'm the one shouting and screaming and praising God all over the place the first one to get there to church the last one to leave amen hallelujah so I Had a Heart of Stone before I don't want anybody to tell me nothing I don't want you to tell me nothing I don't care I don't care but now my heart's open when I got saved now I had a new heart now I had a hunger now I want to know God's word hallelujah my heart is tender to the word of God now Glory but then the second step is a new spirit which means your mind you're thinking brother R said you got to develop new habits right you got to think uh differently about things and that's called sanctification s sanctification means a clean a cleansing a purification so you get saved you get a new heart but then God's got to give you a new way to think develop good habits but said it's got to clean you out brother said sanctification is cleaning you out and setting you aside for service you're not in service yet but you're getting cleaned out so you can be in service Hallelujah right and I'm sure you heard the story brother said the three works of Grace is just like a he said like a farmer going out to the chicken yard now this I got 17 chickens now yeah I think I yeah I got 17 chickens used to have 20 we had to get rid of two roosters and then one of them died during that heat that heat wave a couple weeks ago that was really sad for my daughters you know it's our first batch of chickens so they're really attached to the chickens but it's just brother is like a farmer walking out the chicken yard and I do this all the time brother John and my kids leave out the bowls and the cups out there well I tell you I pick those up the next day they're filthy I would not drink out of those bowls I would not drink out of that cup and brother Adam said that's God that's God pulling you out of the world you were filthy but when God picks you up now you're his hallelujah amen as dirty and filthy as you are God's got a purpose for you God's going to fill you eventually Hallelujah right so what do I do when my kids leave the dishes out sister Wilma I got to bring them in and wash them amen or put them in the dishwasher right and that's the that's the sanctification washing it SC scrubbing it or put in the dishwasher whatever you all got you know uh you got to wash it then you got to let it dry right and then finally when it's dry now I'll consider drinking out of that I wouldn't do it while I got it out there when I first picked it up I wouldn't put my ice cream in there I wouldn't put my you know I wouldn't put my lasagna in there I wouldn't eat that I wouldn't feel that but now that it's clean now that it's set aside it's washed out now I'll put something in there I'll fill that vessel amen and now I can use it for service Hallelujah to give me some ice cream hallelujah or whatever service you would you would use a vessel for and that's what the Bible said your vessels of Honor unto God hallelujah so that's what God does God picks you up Justified he cleans you out he sanctifies you and then he pours his holy spirit in you now he can use you for service does that make sense by God's grace brother R tells that story it's a beautiful story Hallelujah it explains it so very well so now you see the three steps right there new heart new spirit my spirit Jesus gives it another way for our farmer friends in here by God's grace go to Mark 4 verse 28 if you got your Bible I'm so glad Jesus could teach it and so such a calm and simple way that even a simple person like me could understand it it's actually in actually Mark 4:26 sorry sister Rachel do you want to read that for us do you want to read uh 20 26 27 28 29 would that be okay sister Rachel okay and he said so is theom of God as cast seed into ground and SLE andise night and day and the seed and grow up he knowe not for the Earth bring fruit of first the blade then the after when the fruit is immedately because the Harvest is and the church said amen there's three steps to the wheat grain in here everybody see that in verse 28 for first is the blade you see the blade pop out of the ground right thank God it's going to thank God we're on our way hallelujah we're on our way to the the full maturity of the seed amen we can see it now it's manifested right that's justification right it's bringing forth something there's some life but there's bringing forth life right the Second Step then you get the ear right Second Step sanctification and third is the full corn so the wheat grain now and as far as know with wheat when I've seen the field then it bows when it's heavy right before Harvest Right it boughs a little bit so Jesus says this is what the kingdom of God is liken unto and I love this brother I love how the Jesus says the farmer goes to bed he wakes up he's like I don't even know how this happened God did this and that's how it is in your life sometimes you don't even realize how God is cleaning you out Hallelujah you even realize how God is so like how many demons did I have in me before I got saved I had to have many demons in me I don't even remember when they left me necessarily I remember when bitterness left me I remember that I had bitterness toward my dad and I wrote him a letter and I just got saved you know I didn't know the message or nothing I said dad I'm going to and then the Holy Spirit came I I didn't like my dad I hated my dad had all this bitterness because he divorced my mom and I was writing that letter to him he was in Tennessee I was in Ohio as I was writing the letter I remember the Holy Spirit brought back the words if you don't forgive others then God won't forgive you and I remember I started crying and then I C dad I forgive you for leaving us you you left six of your children but I forgive you I love you we're going to come and we're going to bring you home and I felt I felt that bitterness lead me so that was one time the demon left me amen but how many other demons I don't know but this is just like the farmer amen when God plants a seed in there he doesn't know how uh The Roots spring out he can't he can't plan that right did you ever watch that no it's it's hidden amen it's something Supernatural going on the inside but if God planted a seed and God Waters the seed and God gives sunlight to the seed that seed is going to bring forth hallelujah amen whether you understand it or not God is going to bring you into maturity of the Holy Spirit through justification sanctification and then you'll know you'll know when the the matur come you'll have a real experience Peter said we saw and heard the Holy Ghost fall amen when the Holy Ghost comes on you something will happen happen to you amen hallelujah praise God just like a baby when it's born amen everybody know that's seen it know you know when the baby's born there's no question the baby's born am because something has emerged something something has become visible amen you can see the baby you can hear the baby Hallelujah that's how it is in the spiritual when God gives birth when God births somebody people around something happened a birth a birth happened something emerged a new life has appeared hallelujah amen amen something happens Hallelujah you don't understand how it all happened like when did you lose this or when did you g gain that and how did all this you don't really understand how just like the farmer but you just know God's laws operate and God brings his word to pass hallelujah amen none of us can figure it out none of us Jesus said it's like the wind blowing none of us know when the wind's going to blow right none of us know when we're going a nice breeze we can try to predict when we're going to get some rain and you know when the clouds might come in and they got the radar and all these things they tried their best to predicted but how many know the weatherman's only right 50% of the time oh yeah I'm sure the farmers know that all their years out there on the fields he he he can try but he's not going to get it right all the time and that's Jesus said that's how the Holy Ghost is see a man goes to bed he wakes up uh and there's three stages here and this is the kingdom and remember Jesus said in Luke 17 the kingdom of God is within you let's read that Luke 17 I know you love the Bible here I think it's verse 21 around there but I don't got that one memorized here I want to get it memorized oh yeah there it is amen Luke 17:21 uh brother irin you want to read that for us brother neither shall they say l here or L there for behold the kingdom of God is within you yes Hallelujah sorry I want to check my timer been preaching 17 minutes already okay all right it's hard to believe thank you sir I appreciate your love for the word of God that's how we should all feel sometimes I put pressure on myself but that's right now look the kingdom of God where's the kingdom of God someone's like I want to join the kingdom of God when you repent the kingdom of God is in you and it's just going to grow like the seed eternal life comes in you right and it grows and grows and grows Hallelujah and it grows and then finally it goes through three stages right justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah all right now you got some good verses there to start now the next I want to see if I can put this up there brother brandom's mom had a dream and it was of the the three works of Grace and let me see if I can do this here uh huh it's not working there I see it on my screen but it's not on your screen okay I'm sorry I'm just going to have to read it brother said this is it is the rising of the sun uh April 18th 1965 brother man said my own mother she's gone now she was a very odd woman and she was you know half Indian and but in her she was a person that didn't dream she only had four or five dreams all of her life but every time she dreamed it was true she had a dream it was true I remember one time I was preaching many years ago she was living up the road right above here I was preaching right here at this church she dreamed a dream that I was standing by the side of three steps everybody see this uh like you sisters got some steps coming down right brother R standing by uh in a his mom had a dream brother standing by three steps so one step two step three step that's the three works of Grace but look at the dream that his mother had and I was standing preaching to everybody that they must walk up these three steps before they hit the highway now the highway is the Highway of Holiness right in Isaiah 35 we'll read that next so why don't you turn there if you got it uh if you got your Bibles go and turn to Isaiah 35 I don't have the verse memorized but I know I got the chapter memorized I hope so if not you have to forgive me brother Ram says and then on that highway is a little pearly like white line that runs right into the doors of Heaven to the Pearly gate and that Pearl had been stretched out over the top of these steps now look what says if that ain't my message exactly to day what three steps and then an ivory Highway brother said that's my message Glory my message is you got to walk up three steps and once you get to that third step then you walk the Highway of Holiness all the way to heaven to see Jesus amen he said that's my message he said exactly justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right there's a way of holiness let me see if I got oh I do got it Isaiah uh 35:8 brother Noah you got that you got your Bible open brother no could you read that Isaiah 358 and in Highway shall be there in a way and it shall be called The Highway of the way of Holiness and the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those waying though fools shall not there amen I love this brother R picks up a scripture I'm sorry the uh Isaiah prophesied this this was 900 years before Christ he said there's going to be a way of Holiness the unclean cannot passed on this way think about that what are those steps it's cleansing you're clean by justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost now you're clean now you can walk Hallelujah now God can use you now God can put you into service Hall Hallelujah and it's right there in the Bible Hallelujah Isaiah 35:8 this is the way of Holiness and brother said see ain't that my message exactly the three works of Grace the justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and I was saying that a person has to come up by these three steps to be able to walk that highway now listen here's here's a important part of the story and there was a lady came by you know those kind of of shoes people wore 35 years ago there's a lady come by this is 65 so 35 years a ago uh third 1930 good buddy I'm I've had all the summer off from adding and subtracting you know she had a great big pair like they wear today spiked high heeled shoes now you know we don't believe in high heeled shoes in the message right it's sad that some preachers allow but that's sin the high heeled shoes what does it do it props up a woman right props her up so her body sticking out more because men like to lust after her and it actually ruins their feet too why would they want to do that you know just for fashion just for sex appeal and remember high heels are are preached in Isaiah 3 did you know that did you know the mincing the mencing in Isaiah 3 remember that everybody remember raise your hand if you know that high heels were preached in Isaiah 3 yeah see the Bible say there's nothing new Under the Sun right it's just more deception and more sin right but same same things same things and brother BS and this and she said I'm sorry and she come by and I said wait a minute sister you can't walk that Highway like that and I said you can't do that and she said ah and she looked around the rest of women said don't believe him he's a mad man see don't believe him I'll show you I can be justified Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and still walk that and I just let her go this is a dream brother Ram's mom had look how she looks how she disrespects the preacher that's what we got a lot of today a lot of disrespecting people disrespect the preacher they don't know their Bibles they don't care what the Bible says they just want religion they just want to act like they're saved when they're not saved but a a real person who saves lives by the word of God loves the word of God wants to hear the word of God hallelujah oh I say like this a real child of God wants to be warned if they're wrong Hallelujah I don't want to offend Jesus and I know if Jesus loves me he'll correct me he'll give me warnings Amen Hallelujah Lord Hebrews 12 says that every Son of God must be chastened Hallelujah and God chastens every one of his sons Hallelujah in other words when we all need a spank and we all get one Hallelujah I'm not talking about physically I'm talking about spiritually Amen brother R said I couldn't do more about it couldn't stop her and she just jumped up on the highway and she looked back and she said see I told you and she started to run up in her high heels imagine her running in her high heels on the highway I look like silly don't I he said you know know as the Bible said Isaiah the 5ifth chapter they had outstretched necks see and they stretch out their necks I've seen them I work with teachers they walk down the hallway like this everybody knows they're coming clink clink clink I'm like oh God have mercy brother R said they're mincing as they go he's actually uh quoting Isaiah we'll read that next and he he quotes Isaiah so brother says high heels were in Isaiah Isaiah prophesied of that and brother said she started up that highway just as hard as she could and after a while the road got narrower and narrower Hallelujah is that right see we learn we learn brother said because we know so much we're more there's more responsibility for us we can't live loose on this way we got to say we got to repent every day brother R said I Repent every hour that's what brother R said I Repent of any sin every hour so I can walk the straight and narrow way hallelujah look she's walking up on those high heels and it's getting narrow narrow she started reeling mincing like that and off she went she fell off the way that's right church that's right and mother said the horriblest screams that I ever heard in my life was that woman falling into those flames and the smoke and see and I said I turned around and said see to all those women that were watching him see you can't walk the holy way like a SE a sex object of Temptation you can't live like that and walk the Highway of Holiness amen some of you sisters ought to say Amen to that Hallelujah you Brothers ought to say Amen too amen now let's go read it where are you in Isaiah mincing is the word yes Isaiah 3:16 Now read the whole chapter I I wrote about this in my modesty book if you want a free copy let me know a brother from Missouri just ordered 30 my cop my books he said I'm going to pass them out said God bless you buddy not that we're we don't hard to make any on but I love it he wants to pass them out like Glory this is what people need to hear hallelujah look at verse uh brother John you want to read that brother John you got your Bible sorry forgive me if you're not ready when I call on you just tell me you're not ready okay I don't want to put anybody on the spot but I like to hear your voices too it makes you more active in the service go ahead brother John whenever uh Isaiah 3:16 sir moreover the Lord say because the daughters of Zion are Hy and walk with stretched fornes and W eyes walking and as they go and making a timling with their feet all right now what does he then he judges them there's over 23 accessories you know all you sisters know about accessories right at least in uh America you know all the girls want to have all these accessories and they got this and I got that and I got this uh those Rings they got all these accessories it's a stench in the nostrils of God hallelujah god brother says if you're married or something you want to wear a nice a necklace for your husband that got you or you want to wear a little bracelet or a ring and he said just keep it uh just make sure it's the right motive motive and objective behind it and brother said this the more you decorate yourself probably uh the less you actually feel about yourself on the inside the more insecure you are the more you decorate the outside Hallelujah right that's so true brother right you know because when you dress modest like most of you sisters tonight you're you're you're not bringing attention to yourself you're you're actually deflecting the attention you're reflecting the attention up to Jesus you're not drawing it to yourself you're actually reflecting it up to God right because you're modest you don't draw attention to yourself Hallelujah now that's the verse you can read the rest of it look they got in verse 21 they got rings and nose Jewels look at that see there's nothing new Under the Sun that people have been doing this forever all right how many like that quote by God's grace brother said that's my message my message is you got to come up three steps and you got to walk the narrow road now Church don't let's we're not going to become legalists right we talked about last we're not going to become legalists you just came out of legalism right but it's it's based upon love if you love God you want to keep his commands if you love God you don't want to sin you don't want to uh you don't want to grieve the Holy Spirit remember Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed unto the day of your Redemption grieve means to offend I don't I don't want to offend Jesus the one who died for me I don't want to offend him because he loves me and he died for me praise God let me just read this here three works of Grace now uh go to Titus Chapter 2 I believe it's verse 9 Titus 2:9 I appreciate that Bible thank you sister Sarah appreciate that Titus 2 I believe it's nine I could be wrong there it is G all right Titus 2:9 actually it's verse 11 I'm sorry I'm a little bit uh too early on that one Titus 21 now I want you to see what Grace does okay now you know this most churches will say well uh you can live however you want cuz God gave us Grace you can smoke cigarettes you can get drunk uh you can divorce or remarry that's okay there's Grace for you no there's not if if you spurn Grace if you know better and still do it there's no Grace for that that's called willingly Disobedience I'm talking about Sinners I'm talking about churches that are really deep in sin I'm not talking about our daily small sins I'm talking about the major Abominations right and you know better right right like Herod right Herod divorced div his wife and then married his brother's wife herodias right I mean he needs to repent of that John said you got to repent of that that's why she killed him see he I mean but if he would have been humble he would have gave her back or at that point she's defiled he would have sent her away just live by herself if he really would would would have repented but he never repented see that's what I'm talking about I'm not talking about our daily sins or you know we we have doubts fears we get angry you know we might uh Pride lust or greed or some things we battle dayto day those spirits that come to us in different seasons I'm not talking about that I'm talking about these major sins that people they just allow the churches they they they get so big because they allow and they let the people live in such a way everybody understand by guys I'm talking about Methodist Baptist Presbyterian that's what I'm talking about you know Pentecostal that's what I'm talking about I'm not talking about people that are just like us living Sanctified uh set aside living holy lives and we we just battle sin on a daily basis that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about church is that they legalize sin that's what I want to say they turn the grace of God into lasciviousness that's what I'm telling you am it's in that's Jude 1:3 if you want to read that they turn Grace into lawlessness you can live however you want in other words uh the Bible says a preacher has to be married to one wife well it's okay if the preacher married his third time around it's okay that's lasciviousness everybody understand but a church like us will stand on the word of God live or die amen we want God's word Hallelujah amise Lord now look at this Titus 2:1 look what Grace teaches how many receive God's grace anyone ever have a favor from God for salvation but Daniel you want to read that brother uh 2 verse 11 brother read uh I'm sorry 11 and 12 brother for the grace of God that BR salvation appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and world of L we should live righteously and godly and amen what does grace teach now the church doesn't tell you Grace teaches oh you're saved no matter what you do you can divorce and remarry and have adultery you're saved we can do whatever you do that's not what Grace teaches and the church said what's the Bible say it teaches that's right Ryan amen buddy that's he's raising his hand saying amen the grace teaches to deny ungodliness Grace will teach you deny that don't don't accept that sin Grace will teach you to deny worldly lust don't give into the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life Grace says don't give into that amen Grace says live soberly righteously Godly in this present world looking for what verse 13 looking for that blessed hope the Glorious appearing of our great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people jealous of Good Works he died that he could wash us sanctify us fill us with the Holy Ghost that we be zealous to do the works of God isn't that beautiful verse right there see people and now go to 1 Corinthians 15:10 sister Lydia if you can get that 1 Corinthians 15:10 here's another verse about how Grace makes you labor so if how many ever felt that burden like I'm a Christian I need to do more for God anybody ever felt that before that's Grace that's not legalism that's Grace that's Grace saying let's labor let's do something with our lives let's not waste our time amen and when you feel that voice saying oh don't give any this lust and and that's not legalism that's Grace Hallelujah Lord now we heard the legalism where they say you can't eat shrimp remember we talked about that that's legalism because Acts chapter 10 proves that we talked about it God gave you the right verses brother that gentleman tried to bring in legalism that's sin that is legalism right he's bringing in legalism because the Bible says all the creatures of God Amen I God gave you that verse brother all the creatures of God are good to be received with Thanksgiving Hallelujah so you guys re by God's grace you recognize that evil spirit believe that's right you got to be a believer amen thank God for the liberty of the Holy Ghost amen but the but still the Holy Ghost will say labor more for me give me more of your life uh deny lust that's the Holy Ghost that's Grace that's God's gift to you amen that's God's gift to you that God's spirit lives inside of you and saying don't give into the lust obey and let's and uh put yourself in a position you can do more works for God like take less land brother so you have more time for the word of God that's your testimony amen that's a beautiful testimony of God's grace now Sister Lydia uh 1 Corinthians 15:10 I want you to see Paul says he labored more than any other apostle that means Paul worked harder than Peter you know that Paul worked harder than James John Bartholomew uh Thomas Thomas he even though he doubted don't feel bad about Thomas Thomas took the gospel further than anybody else don't don't don't let anybody say anything bad about Thomas because you would have doubted too Peter doubted John doubt they all doubted right that's not bad MTH Thomas like we're somebody special like we we believed everything every time no matter what nonsense we did it we needed God's grace amen but look at this verse what caused Paul to work harder than everybody else for Jesus go and read it s but by thece of God I am what I am and his abant with me and the church said what caused Paul to work harder he went on three Miss missionary trips he was beaten numerous times whipped uh three times Shipwrecked five times what caused him to keep laboring it was God's grace in other words the Holy Spirit saying keep going Paul keep pressing through there's more for you to do don't get distracted don't don't feel bad keep laboring it's my grace that's with you Hallelujah see that see grace will teach you to deny sin and then Grace will cause you to labor more for Jesus Hallelujah and remember Church there is no condemnation to you because you're in Christ Jesus when you if God forbid we should pass away before the rapure or something you will not receive condemnation you will receive Mercy because you're a child of God because you're in Christ Jesus there is no condemnation Jesus says if you believe you've already passed from Death unto life Hallelujah you've already passed from Death un life Hallelujah because you believe in Jesus Jesus Christ amen how many believe that Hallelujah this is God's grace and remember brother said my message is step up these three steps I wish I had three chairs like this i' go I'd go one two three one two three and I'm going to walk the gospel highway I'm going to walk a holy life because I've walked these I've already raised these three steps and I can walk this way because I'm walking the King's Highway Hallelujah and I don't have high heels on either Hallelujah now Church there's so many Bible Witnesses I have a whole chapter on this in my book The 2021 mystery book see every process there's many processes that have three works right first work second word third word so when a baby's born I've seen it eight times my wife's had eight babies I was there for all eight I didn't pass out I got close to passing out because I like seeing blood but I was I saw all eight by God's grace what happens first the water breaks and we're like oh my the baby's on the way better get ready and then there's a bloody show or blood right I forget what my wife says you need to correct that I think I corrected it there's some blood she's always good at correcting me amen did you know brother said that my wife is my correction you know brother said that he said sister ma is my she's my correction he said you know you Brothers know what I'm talking about I said Amen brother R if I was ever Hallelujah brother R see my wife she always corrects me I love it that's why I need her she's the other part of me Hallelujah I'm only part of me right she's the other half of me I need to be corrected so not only did God give me the Holy Ghost he gave me the Holy Ghost and my wife to correct me I love it amen and then and then the last thing is the baby takes the breath of life you know once it's born the Breath of Life comes in that first breath so there's three stages to a natural birth friends brother R said there's three stages to the spiritual birth amen justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost when Israel left they had to leave Egypt through the water that's baptism then the Wilderness then they got to the promised land amen then the Cross Jordan into the promised land three Works Hallelujah three stages of the journey and the Tabernacle Moses and also Solomon and also David had a tabernacle too it was cleansed by three things had to be cleansed the blood had to be in the outer Court then the blood had to be in the Holy Holy place then the blood had to be in the Hol of holies amen three steps three places to cleanse it and the church said let me show you that uh this might help you here let me uh I I just was looking here I thought well maybe this will help the Saints now this this has a couple different a couple different tracks here here's uh Israel leaving ramsy you know or Egypt this is the traditional way this blue way some people think that's the blue way uh the alternate way is they come this way the dotted line and then they went up here either way it doesn't matter there's three steps the first step was leaving and crossing the uh the Red Sea here right first step Second Step they either went all the way to KES Baria then they rejected it then they keep going around around and then Joshua finally let him over there's Jericho over the Jordan River okay but there's still three steps right one getting out of Egypt two three getting in the promised land and the church said am does that helpful there's only three steps you got to get out of Egypt you got to get out of sin you got to get out of your your worldliness you got to get Sanctified in the wilderness amen and and and Moses said God told Moses I'm going to prove you in the wilderness see that's what sanctification is it's Proving Grounds do you want to be filled with the Holy Ghost are you willing to be cleaned out are you willing to go all the way and if you're willing to go all the way God will bring you into the promised land God will bring you into the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost glory amen everybody see that you got three steps leaving Egypt Wilderness crossing over into Jordan into the promised land okay everybody's really do a good doing a good job paying attention here today now the Earth is brother said the Earth this is in the future home brother said the Earth is cleansed with three things Noah's flood water second Jesus blood on Calvary and third the fervent heat right that burns up the outside of the Earth by it doesn't destroy the Earth it just burns up the outside so then Jesus can step on it because now it's clean and now he can he can he can live on the earth because now all the sin is burned off of it so even the Earth is cleansed in three steps just like you're cleansed in three steps amen now we read ezekiel's prophecy new heart new spirit my spirit or God God spe ever see that this is a Bible Revelation and this proves again brother irin that we've got the revelation we have thus sayith the Lord out of the Bible all these other churches outside the message they don't have it they might have some ideas like some of them will be believe like oh this is tongues if you speak in tongues and you're filled with the Holy Ghost no I've met a lot of people that spoke in tongues that aren't born again like I told you Cam and Simon when we first got saved we went to a church our church uh it's Assemblies of God Pentecostal Church there was this one kid in the youth group was probably 22 21 he spoke in tongues all the time he said he had the Holy Ghost he would go in the church uh kitchen he would steal the the metal forks out of there and then he would bend them and make them like in these strange shapes and then he would go sell them and make money now you tell me that's just like Judas steal money see tongues can't be the evidence and then I love Hebrew or 1 Corinthians 12 said do all speak with tongues of course not do all work miracles are all apostles are all missionaries are all pastors are all teachers no but God has given to us the gifts as it please him not as it pleases us as it pleases him Hallelujah so we must find how God wants us to please him not what pleases us but what pleases God hallelujah I've asked God to speak in tongues I've never spoken tongues but I've but I have cast out Devils I have prayed for the sick and they've recovered Hallelujah I have had dreams and they came to pass so is my wife but is is somebody better cuz they spoke in tongues than somebody who had a dream or someone who prayed for the sick no we're all part of the same body Hallelujah we all I thank God for it I'd like to know what it likes to speak in tongues but the Bible said it just makes you feel better it just edifies you if you speak in Tong right well I who doesn't want to feel good I like to feel good but if if God don't want me to do it then I I don't want to do it praise God you know when I was younger I'll tell you the story when we were younger in our assembly God church I was probably eight or nine or 10 right and they they'd have week long revivals like service Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday one night they invited all my brothers like cam cam Simon me we all come up and they all laid hands on us and brother they were shaking us like this fill them with the Holy Ghost fill them with the Holy Ghost and the guy's like Jesse just whisper I love you Jesus just keep saying I love you Jesus I love you Jesus and that's what I did I said I love you I started crying because all the people are shouting and the music's pumping and I'm like I feel I feel the anointing I feel something here and I started talking so fast like Jesus Jesus that I I I muttered a few words that didn't make sense and they're like oh he's smoking tongues he's fill with the Holy Ghost after the prayer I I I got out my sucker that I had in my pants and I was crying but I ran back out and played baseball with the kids I didn't even stay in to you know to worship God how could that be the Holy Ghost how could that be filling with the Holy Ghost it's not praise God it was a motion but I thought back to that thought wow see they just want to work you up to a tongue they just said they're seeking the gift instead of The Giver we have to seek The Giver of the gifts amen and then he gives the gifts as it Mak as it pleases him as he sees fit praise God was that okay that I shook you Budd you got I saw those strong shoulders brother I knew he could hand a little Shake oh God Shake us up tonight amen hallelujah stirs up by the Holy Spirit praise God Amen brother amen so see then Jesus gives us three ways the kingdom of God grows blade ear full corn justification sanctification baptis and I love this Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life I love it oh he he's basically saying I'm I'm the I'm the highway I'm the way of Holiness amen he's basically saying I am Isaiah 5:8 I'm the way the truth the life no man comes into the father except by me hallelujah oh I love it remember Jesus said in John 17:17 sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is trueu see when when people get Sanctified they need more of the word teach them the word know the word they can get rid of their bad habits get rid of their sins and then once that cup is all clean then God can pour in his holy ghost now you're ready for service Hallelujah amen woo glory to God all right now yeah showed you that okay now I don't know if I can I would just like to show you uh I probably don't have time to do it I um I want to show you a little picture I got here let me [Applause] see I I I can't do it right now but um maybe I'll preach it next time I like to just preach message some point just about the power of the blood of Jesus Christ have you ever just read all the verses on the blood of Jesus Christ you would be you would be so blessed to see there's so much power the blood justifies you the blood sanctifies you and the life of the blood of the Holy Spirit fills you you're also in a covenant with God through the blood of Jesus Christ now what's a covenant it's a promise it's a oath I promise to live to Pure my wife I made a oath when I got married I didn't do this you know we got to do that in the courtroom you know but I promise Hallelujah and God promised that to you brother irin and sister wi Jesus said I'm going to give my blood I'm going to make a promise to you my blood is going to forgive you my blood is going to bring you on the way of Holiness I promise I'll keep my my word oh the god of Heaven made a promise to you Hallelujah and you know God doesn't break his promise Hallelujah there's so much Power in the Blood of Jesus Christ it brings us into the Covenant as I preached last time the Waters of Separation when God when you repent of your sins God sprinkles that anointing on you and that that's what brought Moses in into the Covenant with the people remember he sprinkled the blood on them at Mount Si remember that he said you're joined he said I don't mean to do this in your face he said but he said you're joined under the Covenant he would actually sprinkle them and they they would get hit with blood and that blood when got hit okay now now the covenant's on me now I'm joined now I'm a part of the Covenant and see s Saints when you confess your sins and you repented and I baptized most of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you were brought into Covenant with God Almighty and God will keep his promise to you God will bring you to the Rapture God will bring you up the three steps he'll help you walk that Highway of Holiness and then the Gates of Heaven will open for you and I Hallelujah CU God's covenant cannot fail Hallelujah in order for the Covenant to fail the blood would have to be wrong blood and it wasn't wrong blood it was Holy Blood amen it was the blood of God's own son hallelujah amen church we are more secure than we even imagine our Salvation is more secure than we can possibly imagine Jesus said no man brother Daniel can pluck you out of the hand of God Amen I got to preach a whole sermon on that maybe next week I or maybe in two weeks go to Second Peter chapter uh 1 second Peter chapter 1 now I gave you just the general way of the three works of Grace Peter gives you a more detailed look at it second Peter chapter 1 I need some readers here if you got your Bible I'm already at 50 minutes so I don't I don't know we'll see brother irin gave me said just go ahead and preach it so I might just do that preach a little bit longer here tonight by God's grace Hallelujah look at verse three according to his divine power has given unto us all things everybody say all things ready all God's already given you all things that pertain unto life on this Earth and godliness whatever you need to be more Godly God's already given it to you but it's by promise and you got to accept the promise see through the knowledge of him that called you that called us to glory and virtue look at verse four whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust there's a serpent seed verse right sin is in the world through lust Eve didn't lust after an apple like oh I want to love that Apple it wasn't no it was it was sexual lust right with with the serpent that's why God said eve you're desires now to your husband not to the serpent remember that and now I'm going to punish you now you're going to bring for seed and and and pain because you received the wrong seed now you're going to bring forth the seed with pain Hallelujah that's right church that's right but see that you're giving great precious promises and when you receive the promise you become a partaker of the Holy Ghost a partaker of God's divine nature okay now here's a picture for you up here in 1962 brother Ram taught this sermon he called this the stature of a perfect man if you haven't listened to it you need to listen to it it's a beautiful message and this is what Peter teaches now let's look at verse uh five verse five it says and beside this giving all diligence see grace will make you be diligent add to your faith what church what do you let's say together add to your faith what now Faith is a substance of things hoped for it's an Evidence of Things Not Seen that's what you need to get saved where saved by grace through what through that's the first that's the first anointing you get when you confess your sins and you're Justified but then you get virtue now virtue just means strength and in the Bible Ruth was known for virtue why because she was out with the men and yet she stayed true she didn't go running after the guys and oh I can marry another guy she lived it publicly and so that's what virtue is when you can live Glory when you can live the gospel in front in front of your former church friends when you can just publicly stand up and say I don't believe that anymore I believe the word of God now you've got virtue because that's what Ruth had Ruth said I'm not running around with you young boys I'm going to wait for God's man for me that was Boaz Hallelujah she could have run run around and chase those young guys no she had virtue and the whole city knew she had virtue amen your whole family will know youve got the virtue of God when you stand on God's word hallelujah that's right then the Bible said add to your virtue what knowledge means a deep Christian understanding you understand the word of God now see that's an anointing a lot of people don't understand why do why shouldn't women cut their hair why shouldn't men smoke cigarettes why shouldn't men cuss why can't we go see movies they don't understand it takes an anointing of the Holy Ghost to give them that but you got it how many got it tonight by God Amen I understand God's ways I understand his three steps I understand the Highway of Holiness amen I understand jusic sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost I have an understanding I understand God's ways I know something like I'm crazy but I'm not I'm just crazy for Jesus okay and after you get knowledge then what comes next Temperance that means control over sensual bodily passions so it could be food or it could be sexual Temptation okay anything your flesh or body wants like well I really want that McDonald's like I told you last I don't know if I told you I got to drive by McDonald's and say I rebuke you McDonald's in the name of Jesus Jesus right I used to be addicted to Dr Pepper but now I walk by Dr Pepper I said I rebuke you Dr Pepper in the name of Jesus cuz it's going to give me diabetes if I keep drinking it I don't want diabetes but said the diabetes is a chemical problem it's not some Demon it's you you ate too much sugar and the church said I can give you the quote if you want it my my wife found that one again my wife helping me out praise God I love my wife amen you see that's why people fall in sexual sin sometime because they don't have that anointing of temperance all these preachers this year that have fallen in sexual sin it proves they don't have that anointing that's why they fall see because they're not look they're not Sanctified they might be saved like like David right David he he he David could never get this in the Old Testament so the highest he could get was up here but when he lost that anointing here he fell right here you can gain these anointings and lose these anointings in your mind you okay I'll proove it to you I approve it to you uh getting a good lesson here tonight by God's grace yep if you got your Bible go to Luke 22 uh 31 Luke 2231 I'm going prove it to you Luke 22 31 see this is where people fall in sexual sin or they overeat like Eli right and Eli's Sons remember Eli was overweight this is where he struggled and his sons remember they were sleeping with women they were married but they had adulterous Affairs this is where they failed they never got this anointing Church Peter wrote this by the Holy Ghost how many believe that amen the Holy Ghost says start with faith and then add to it God give me more anointing how many say that tonight God anoint me more with more power more love amen Lord I I need a fresh anointing of patience I need a fresh anointing of temperance I need a fresh anointing of godliness or brotherly kindness I'm talking about in your mind now the first time you go through this is the first time you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul but then your mind needs continually Sanctified how many know that how many know your mind needs continually Sanctified you don't always think the right things I don't always think the right things but this is but the first time you go through this you get those anointings you get sealed with the Holy Ghost in your soul but then you got to keep Sanctified that's why Jesus said I sanctify myself for their sakes the night he was arrested how many remember that the night he was arrested he said he said oh Father I sanctify myself for their sakes because the preachers were going to abandon him in just a few hours see even Jesus had to make sure his mind was sanctified it was set aside it was focused on the word of God that's what Jesus said now Jesus never sinned right but he he had a record he still had a human will remember he prayed God take this cup from me what he had a human mind he had he had a human desires Lord take this cup from me but if it if it be possible but if not let thy will be done the man said he didn't want to die he want to stay he he wanted to stay there with his disciples he didn't want to die but he had to overcome that you overcome that by the word of God by prayer that's how you'll overcome Church in your hardest battles God might drive you to the prayer closet so you can overcome your trials Hallelujah all right now stay there in Luke 22 but okay next is patience right after you get control over your flesh and over your desires then God has to give you patience Hallelujah and brother Ram said the first thing is patience with God do you know brother R said that stat your perfect man brother says what's the first thing you need to be patient with God like God where's all my answers to all my prayers where's all my blessings the church said God I want this where is it God I want that I prayed about that last year where is it and God said he's got to teach you patience with God because remember church God is not your Aaron boy okay I'll go do this brother Jesse okay what else you need brother Jesse I'll go do this he's not your Aaron boy he does what he wants he said prayer is to change your mind not God's mind mind right we want everything that we want at one time and God said no God said I'll do what's best for you I'll do my will not your will but ra said prayer changes your mind Hallelujah and then godliness is being like God reverence and brother says that's loving that's loving the unlovable loving your enemies how many know it takes a special anointing to love your enemies amen that's godliness like like uh Jesus said God sends his Reign on the just the good people and the unjust that's being like God he said then if if you're good to those that are mean to you now you're the children of God now you're the children because you're like God hallelujah praise God and then brotherly kindness is the last anointing see before God gives his people the Holy Ghost brother Urban he's got to make sure they got the anointing to treat other people in the church the right way God's not going to give you the Holy Ghost you're going to mistreat the church the church say he's got to give you the anointing of Brotherly kindness I'm kind to my brother oh I'm so sorry but I didn't mean to rub your shoulders too hard forgive me all right Y in other words when you you do something wrong with somebody in the church you go oh I'm so sorry that's my fault I didn't mean to do that how many times have I to do that as a pastor I got to say Church you I'm sorry I preached the wrong thing you know forgive me or I'm sorry sorry I forgot to tell you about this I forgot to announce that you know forgive me I was a little harsh here forgive me I didn't mean to do that how many times I got to apologize to my wife that's like a hundred times you know all the time I'm just not perfect I don't think like a woman amen I think like a man because of that I'm insensitive and I sin sometimes and I need God's help to overcome that praise God that's right and then brother said after that God will cap you off God will seal you another word he says is vulcanize you or weld you he'll weld his holy ghost he'll put the holy ghost in your soul and then you're seal to the day of your Redemption praise God so see this is the three works of Grace with more detail Peter gives us more detail Peter can't change what Ezekiel said Peter's not going to change that Peter's not going to change uh what Jesus said the three steps of the wheat no this just gives you more detail see brother UR you got the Holy Ghost brother this is what God did you didn't even know just like the farmer Glory the farmer just went to bed he didn't know what was happening you just drew you just kept drawing night to God and God kept giving you more anointing all the time and then that one day then you got the Holy Ghost amen amen that one day then the wheat grain was finally mature now can be harvested now can be used for the glory of God hallelujah I didn't know I was going to preach this hard tonight I'm enjoying this more than I thought I would praise God like brother I finally feel like preaching preaching I'm starting to feel religious now Hallelujah all right everybody got that now now you can go so in depth with this this is what I did in my book faith is a substance needed to choose the right way uh virtue is the strength needed to daily walk in the way publicly knowledge is the understanding needed to know why you must Walk This Way Temperance is the self-control needed to remain on this way patience is the steadfastness needed to be content on this way godliness is reverence need to be just like God on this way talk about the three steps of Grace brother kindness is selflessness needed to live for others on this way and the presence of God is needed to completely manifest the living Christ on this way amen hallelujah now and church now now now now imagine the pyramid flipped upside down the first thing you get is faith but what do you have to reject first to over to get Faith you got to reject unbelief you have to overcome the opposite sin in order to get the right anointing so if you want virtue you got to you got to overcome hypocrisy if you want knowledge you got to overcome human reasoning like Eve in the garden oh yeah surely if I eat it I won't die I'll be just like God that's human reasoning if you want Temperance you got to overcome sensuality giving your flesh and body whatever it wants you got to overcome that by the Holy Spirit if you want patience you got to understand haste do everything quickly I need it now I got I got to have it now God God's like no you need to overcome haste you need to be patient if you want godliness you got to overcome being irreverent not recognizing God God's all around us you got to live a respectful life if you want brotherly kindness you got to overcome selfishness if you want the Holy Ghost you got to overcome resisting brother said people don't get the Holy Ghost because they they don't open themselves up and just let God fill them and then praise God all right okay now you got Luke 21 or I'm sorry Luke 22:31 uh sister Ruth you got that could you read uh why don't you read 31 and 32 sister hallelujah what is converted converted is the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't he's saying you're not converted yet your Soul's not born again yet but what did he pray he said I pray that what doesn't fail your faith that night later that night he was going to deny Jesus three times so look and and church he had he had all this he had all this virtue right he's like Jesus I won't deny you I won't deny you but he lost that virtue because of fear but Jesus said don't worry Peter I prayed for you that you don't lose your faith amen hallelujah so Peter lost all this anointing right he Lo he had different levels of this anointing throughout his ministry before he got the Holy Ghost but that night on Jesus rest he lost his virtue he couldn't stand up for Jesus but Jesus said don't worry I pray for you in my prayer I know God will hear my prayer Hallelujah brother ra says that Peter wasn't brother said Peter didn't even put on the full armor of God until the day of Pentecost remember Ephesians 6 the armor of God man said he didn't even have on the armor till he got to Pentecost then he had the sword then he had the shield then he had the helmet then he had the breastplate then he had the feet shot and then he had the belt of truth hallelujah he got that when he got the baptism of the Holy Ghost other words you and I are not mature soldiers until we're born again and we can walk on that Highway Hallelujah I know I'm laying a lot in here how many enjoying this tonight by God's grace I feel like I'm tying the whole Bible together tonight you know I know I'm not but I feel like it Glory it's a beautiful Revelation no see brother I was raised in church my whole life I never heard nothing like this that's how I know this is the message it ties the Bible together it finishes the mystery of God it takes out all the questions as brother said the Holy Ghost dissolves all of our doubts amen that way we know we're in the truth for this hour Hallelujah I'm sorry sisters I'm spitting all over your floor you know forgive me if you want me to wipe it up give me a towel after service I don't mean to spit on your floor I just can't help it I just get so excited sometime Hallelujah all right now there's five examples Peter's one of them now I'm just for time sake Saints I just got to go through these quickly okay it's already hour and six I have a video about this if you want a link you know some somebody text me I'll send I got a whole video on this teaching the whole thing there's at least five examples Peter's the first one Peter was saved before he got the Holy Ghost right and Jesus said you got the keys of the kingdom and he wasn't even born again yet see he's already saved and the Bible said Jesus didn't baptize anybody when he was on Earth the disciples baptized him well what does baptism mean you got saved so Peter had to First be baptized then he could baptize all the other ones so he was already saved but he didn't have the Holy Ghost so Acts 2 ver4 you see that church look at this he walked on water and he didn't have the Holy Ghost in his soul Hallelujah he could walk on water go see that that proves you know people can do Miracles and not be born again remember Paul said you can understand all the Mysteries you can give your bod as a sacrifice to be burned you can give away all your goods but if you don't have charity you don't have nothing you need the love of God you can speak every M you can speak Every Mountain out of existence you know you could you can do all these things but if you don't have God's love it doesn't profit you anything Mary remember in Luke chapter 1 uh Mary got the word uh about I'm sorry Mary uh met her her sister-in-law Elizabeth and remember she sang that song remember the The Babe leaped in uh her womb uh Elizabeth's womb when it talk about Jesus and Mary said I rejoice in God my savior how many remember that verse she's already saved she's a 16y old virgin with a baby now around 16 and she said I'm already saved and look at that church she was in justification and sanctification for over 30 some years till Jesus was born raised lived died resurrected and then the day of Pentecost think of that brother John she was in sanctification for over 30 years so Church don't be discouraged if you're waiting to get the Holy Ghost you're going to get it I was hoping for a little more amens than that you're going to get the Holy Ghost Hallelujah better amen glory she had to wait 30 years amen just keep trusting in God God has a time and season for everything Hallelujah now of course she couldn't get it because Jesus had it wasn't glorified yet that's what John 7: 37-39 says remember uh the Holy Ghost couldn't yet be given until Jesus was glorified remember that verse okay that meant in the soul they couldn't have the Holy Ghost in the soul till Jesus was B was dead raised and now he's in a glorified body now the day of Pentecost can happen all right now these already went over the last I've already gone two there's five examples I've done two of them Peter Mary the third one is the Samaritans and I preached this a while ago but remember the Samaritan story Philip goes down there preaches Christ to them they get baptized but they said we're not filled with the Holy Ghost they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus let's go call Peter and John to pray for them remember that then Peter and John come to Samaria and they pray and then the Bible said they're filled with the Holy Ghost so there's a third example you're saved first Sanctified and then filled with the Holy Ghost everybody see that church this Bible is Rock Solomon this Bible has one Revelation amen this Bible only has one interpretation and that's the interpretation of the Holy Ghost amen and the Holy Ghost gave that to brother Bram amen like I tell people I've been on YouTube 11 years and not one person can disprove the three works of Grace the serpent seed the godhead the water baptism not one of them can do it and it's not because of me it's because God gave us the revelation of the word of God the Gates of Hell won't Prevail against this Revelation hallelujah hallelujah glory amen I feel religious amen I already said that amen I feel double religious amen acts 10 is Cornelius Cornelius was fasting praying giving alms and he hadn't been baptized yet but he knew about Jesus and then he had the dream go call Peter Peter comes Peter preaches a 5 minute sermon and the Holy Ghost Falls and the Bible said they were filled with the Holy Ghost even before they were baptized in water my sweet daughter asked me a few nights ago she said daddy she said Daddy we have I have to be baptized before I get the Holy Ghost right and I said no yeah I hate I hate to cck my children you know I said no hun I said cornelus they got the the Holy Ghost in their soul before they were baptized in water because the Jews weren't allowed to preach to them the Jews weren't allowed they they didn't know until God showed Peter the vision Hallelujah is that right they had nobody to baptize him they had no preachers to baptize him but then when God sent Peter there oh go Peter says I see God's not a respector of anybody amen hallelujah God gave me the vision amen don't call unclean what God has cleansed amen and while Peter preached the word the Holy Ghost fell and then they got the holy ghost appear said now who can forbid that these men should be baptized in water and the Bible said that hour they bury them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah that's right so see people can get the Holy Ghost without even being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the Bible the truth or not Church absolutely it's entirely true there's no erors in the word of God the King James version is the best version It's the only version that I use just so you know that's a whole another sermon you know cuz all the other versions they start taking out verses and they start uh they start attacking message Doctrine yeah so I recommend only use a King James brother brand used a King James that's the only thing he used was a scoffield scoffield King James you don't have to have a scoffield but use the King James I've seen too much I have to show I have to show that I went I went through with my church I showed like 30 verses all these other versions take out they take out prayer and fasting they take out forgiveness they take out the water baptism they take out serpent seed they take all these things out of the of the Bible the devil knows what he's doing but also God knows what he's doing too amen all right let me try to close here uh the fifth and final one is Acts 19 so let's go to Acts 19 this is the one brother Ram says in the church age book this is thus sayith the Lord on the Holy Ghost and the three works of Grace Acts 19 verse I believe it's it's 1 through 7 but we're not going to read all them verse two uh Acts 19 verse2 sister maram do you want to read that is that okay sister whenever you're ready Amen brother R uses this verse and the next verse is he says well then what were you baptized right oh John the Baptist he said that was for repentance but you got to be baptized to receive the Holy Ghost In The Name Of The Lord Jesus right this proves Apollos was already preaching remember read CH read chapter 18 when you have time Apollos was already proven Jesus was the Christ they were already Christians they they' already been baptized under John under the repentance they were saved Sanctified but they weren't filled with the Holy Ghost so they got the right baptism Hallelujah so church I just showed you five examples people have to go through the three works of Grace justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother said that's my message Hallelujah that's my message and my mom had a dream about it amen God showed her the dream all right I just got this last verse and then I'll take any questions and see if anyone has need of prayer okay let's go to Hebrews 6 1 Hebrews 61 Mah when you can you read it a little bit buddy would that be okay Hebrews 61 that's my guy right there amen Hebrews 61 so brother Micaiah let's see um could you read verses 1 2 and three it's a little bit of reading but I'm sure you can do it buddy the ofm [Music] layre excellent buddy great reading all right everybody see this I'm trying to close I'm trying to close here by God's grace my wife knows that means about 15 more minutes okay that's what she tells me sometimes 30 I'm like I'm sorry honey I got caught up in the Heavenly places she's like I know you always do but but Paul Paul says he says uh you have to leave the principles that means the elementary teachings and I know all about elementary I've taught 20 years in elementary Paul says you have to leave the early doctrines and move on to Perfection and you can only do this if God permits Perfection means maturity you can only go on let me go back there Paul says you have to leave you have to move on for from elementary things and go into maturity and you can only do that if God permits now do you see some of these look at some of these doctrines in here Paul lays out uh repentance from dead works now that ought that ought to make somebody say Amen most churches don't make you repent of sins that's what I was talking about earlier they let you commit adultery they let you smoke cuss drink watch filthy movies they let you go to uh parties they let you do drugs they don't care as long as you come to church and say you're sorry and keep paying ties and offerings see they don't they don't they can't move on because they never repent from dead Works they never in other words they don't get what they don't get Sanctified right they can't move on think of the church you guys used to be in they couldn't move on from the dead works right they kept bitterness right they kept lying remember lying brother you told me about that lying the gentleman were lying to you he where's his virtue where's his where's his knowledge though you don't lie you don't put people in bondage where's the understanding of the word of God they didn't move on to maturity they didn't move on to Perfection and they can only do it if God permits and the God will only permit you if you repent that's the only way God let you move on is if you repent of your sins amen and repent of your dead works that's why they can't move on brother sister they won't repent they won't even do the elementary things they won't even do the kindergarten things how are they going to know algebra if they don't know their ABCs that's what I teach ABCs at church at school at church I kind of try to go up to algebra brother said algebra is the gifts of the Spirit that's what brother says when you can start teaching about visions and dreams and how to know things like what is algebra it's like 2X = six well what is x equal 3 you got to find out the unknown what's the unknown well there's a dream I I don't know what it means now you're going to into algebra you might have to pray and fast until God gives you the meaning everybody understand that is this prophecy of God someone had a dream there a prophecy about me is this from God or not you don't know you better find out you better start some algebra class that's right right Hallelujah I just did algebra this week do you know um the people that left the message they did a video called Kenneth Hagen supposedly prophesied of brother Ram's death it was a prophecy I listen to you yeah okay you did all right good hey you got a you got a good foundation thank you Brothers it was amaz it was amazing I I I didn't really plan to study the Holy Ghost brought to me so it's a prophecy it's an unknown and the first thing the Lord showed me is that the prophecy wasn't written until after the fact no one shared this Prophecy Before brother R died that's why I believe it was a false prophecy and then the other thing in the prophecy it said brother Rand made a misstep so God gave him over to Satan to kill him I said there's not one example in the Bible of that a genuine Prophet making one mistake and then God gives him over to Satan there's only one example of someone being given over to Satan what was that that was that man who was sleeping with his stepmother in 1 Corinthians chapter 5 right Paul said I'm going to let give him over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that his soul might be saved brother random lived true to his wife brother lived a real Christian Life Hallelujah he's the most humble preacher I've ever heard in my life right and so what is it was unknown so what the Holy Spirit gave me the wisdom and people say people made comments on there this helped me this Set Me Free I don't now now I see the wisdom of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah there other reasons too but just the Simplicity of this was after the fact this wasn't told beforehand and even the wordss don't make sense it's off the word of God that's what the Holy Ghost does H when you start getting a spiritual algebra you brother man said you give it the word test you take everything back to the Bible does that line up with the Bible is that what the Bible said and then we find out what the Bible said is always going to be right Hallelujah get that for our guy there so see that the Holy Ghost will make you know the unknowns that's algebra Hallelujah all right now I'm trying to close here I think I'll stop right there I'm already at uh let's see hour 21 that's plenty of time there so how many enjoyed it tonight any questions on the three works of Grace I and I'm going to try to find the scripture for you anybody have any questions on the three works of Grace you got to be saved you got to be Sanctified and you got to be filled with the Holy Ghost and after that you just got to keep your mind Sanctified because remember the seat of God inside of you the Holy Ghost the seat of God cannot sin that's why brother said part of you never sin in the first place the spirit of God in you never sinned it's a part of God 1 John 3:9 the seed of God cannot sin Hallelujah and then Paul said in Romans 7 it's not me that sin it's sin that dwell Within Me glory amen thank God for Amazing Grace let's stand RP any questions let's stand like I said I got numerous videos on this I got a video about the five people that were say but not born again but then they got born again proving three works of Grace oh yeah my last point was the churches hate this teaching I'm talk about the false churches the false churches hate this teaching because then we're telling them they don't have the Holy Ghost but they don't have the Holy Ghost if you can live like a devil you don't have the Holy Ghost that's why they hate brother R's message because they hate the truth but we don't hate the truth we love the truth that's all we want is the truth hallelujah amen brother that's why these people that left the message they don't like the three works of Grace they just say oh no there's one work can you imagine a holy ghost filled person uh cussing divorcing remarrying three or four times going to see prostitutes all these things oh yeah you're filled with the Holy Ghost you you're filled with the Devil is what you're filled with the Holy Ghost teaches you to deny ungodliness we I read it we read it tonight the Holy Ghost will purify A peculiar people unto himself that are zealous of good works not zealous of lustful Works let's bow our hearts
