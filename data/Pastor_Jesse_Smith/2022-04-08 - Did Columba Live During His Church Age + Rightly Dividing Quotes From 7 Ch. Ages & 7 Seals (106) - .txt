Description:
Some wonder if Saint Columba lived during his Church Age, the Thyatirean Age. According to historical dates, Columba died 10 years before his Church Age began. It's my humble opinion that it's most likely the Thyatirean Age began around 560 A.D. when a Holy Ghost and power revival struck Phrygia, which would have allowed Columba to live and preach during his age. Brother Branham quotes from both the 7 Church Age sermons and the 7 Seals sermons are rightly divided. All honest believers recognize that NOT every word Brother Branham spoke was "THUS SAITH THE LORD," making it crucial for believers to rightly divide truth.

========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matches name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about columba as he asked can you explain why colomba did not live in his church age my answer to this question was quote no i cannot explain why kalama did not live in the age in which he was the messenger my guess is that brother branham just made a mistake on his dates and didn't have full access to all the historical dates brother branham never said the dates of the ages were thus saith the lord in fact on my larkin video on youtube i showed a quote from brother brandon that said he got the dates from historians end quote friends i cannot answer this question beyond a shadow of doubt because brother branham is not here for us to ask him about this subject but i'll share my personal opinion in this video as it is another exercise in rightly dividing the word of truth and defending jesus's message and messenger brother william branham who is a genuine prophet of god friends every gospel preacher is commissioned by the holy ghost to rightly divide the word of truth according to second timothy 2 verse 15 and to prove all things according to first thessalonians 5 verse 21 also message ministers have to rightly divide the quotes of brother branham as he taught us to be careful how we listen to his sermons discerning his human side from his prophetic gift brother branham also said we must prove all things not some things by the bible let's listen to the quote now we must prove all things by the scripture not what if it's contrary to my faith and yet the scripture says so the scripture is right and i'm wrong see the scripture is always right and only way you can do anything is come back to the scripture brother branham also said to test him by the word let's listen to the quote remember it's the elected is the only kind that'll catch it well you say how do you know what you're not right then test me by the word come test your denomination by this word let's see that prove all things the bible says and brother branham said he was not infallible at least twice calling it tomirat to make him infallible let's listen to the quotes and now i want each of you my dear brethren to know that that these answers are are given to the very best of my knowledge the very best that i would know how to understand and these answers are not infallible see because the scriptures is infallible and as far as i know they're aligned with the scriptures i hope that makes it plain and the tape is to be uh kept now and anyone would want it well they could have it but now i know the scriptures are infallible but my answers are not infallible so i'm sure everyone understands that and if it's not if it's not infallible then you have a right maybe to ask me at any time if there's somebody else's question but the lord sent me to praise and in there what i do know about him i love to express it with all my heart if i make mistakes you pray for me i'm not involved i'm your brother that they're claiming here that some brethren up there that said that i sent them up there and they're preaching that man should leave their wives and hunt for their spiritual mate and that that i am perfectly infallible that there's nothing and over some of the office things you ever heard and the ministerial association got a hold of it and they're writing me a letter about and that i sent them up there and it's causing a lot of confusion and some of them prophesying and saying if one man should leave this wife and go marry that one this church knows that we don't stand for no such tommy rod is that we believe in the bible there are some preachers that do not take time to answer questions and friends that's a very sad thing first peter 3 verse 15 says to be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear so according to the scriptural context one reason a preacher would not want to answer questions is because he was prideful because peter says here it takes meekness to answer questions the preacher must humble himself and look in the scripture or look in history or look in both in order to answer sincere questions the next verse first peter 3 verse 16 says by doing this you have a good conscience so it's likely preachers that won't answer questions have a guilty conscience and are probably haunted by the spirit of fear so as always we should pray for those who are battling fear or any evil spirit the outline for this video is first we'll look at brother branham's apparent mistake on his dates in the church ages next i'll share my opinion on this subject third we'll look at important quotes from brother branham about the church ages and the seven seals and fourth we'll look at history about columba brother branham's apparent mistake on dates in the church ages brother branham said the authority and church age lasted from 606 to 1520 but colomba's lifetime lasted from 521 to 596. according to these dates columba did not even live in the church age he was supposed to be sent to brother branham's accusers will use this apparent mistake to mock brother branham and say he didn't get the memo and also use it to say his sermons were not inspired of the holy ghost both statements are wrong and the accusers have again jumped to conclusions without taking in all the evidence additionally accusers of brother branham have also falsely claimed that there is no such thing as church ages which is completely false scripture is clear using four scriptural examples that there were past ages current ages and future ages so there must be church ages for the ages of the gentile churches are also called the times of the gentiles by jesus in luke 21 verse 24 ephesians 2 verse 7 says there's future ages that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus ephesians 3 verse 5 and colossians 1 verse 26 says there are past and current ages ephesians 3 verse 5 which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now so now means a current age as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and his prophets by the spirit colossians 1 26 even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now this now is the current church age paul was living in but now is made manifest to his saints ephesians 3 verse 21 shows future ages unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end amen these four bible verses prove that there are ages despite the false claims of brother branham's accusers and this proves the anti-message researchers also called brother random's accusers are only selective researchers selecting research only when it fits their narrative to attack brother branham and before moving on saints note that brother branham never said thus saith the lord every date detail and word i preached during the church ages was correct the truth is not every word on brother branham's tapes and also every word in his books was thus saith the lord the sermons and books of brother branham must all be rightly divided and proven to be true as scripture says in first thessalonians 5 21 and 2nd timothy 2 verse 15. my opinion in my personal opinion which i am always open to being corrected on i believe colomba did live in his church age which means brother branham probably forgot to compare columbus lifetime with the timing of the fourth church age thyratira which lasted from 606 to fifteen hundred twenty friends brother branham is not here that we could ask him about these apparent mistakes on the dates of the church ages so we just have to be humble and give our best personal opinion according to all the truth that is laid before us and colombo lived from 521-596 a simple comparison shows according to the dates brother branham gave for the church ages columba did not even live during the age in which he was the messenger here's a visual of the dates clarence larkin and brother branham used for the seven church ages friends here's a quote where brother branham said columba came in thirteera and not before thyrotira so clearly brother branham thought columba lived during or in his church age so it's likely brother branham just never looked up columba's lifespan let's listen to the quote [Laughter] is [Laughter] in this next quote brother ram never claimed all the dates in the church ages were from the lord let's listen to this quote remember as i said before sometimes on these things we might disagree upon them as far as as the theology is concerned and most of my dates i take from the authentic uh historians which really not interested in any side they just wrote down facts whatever it was what the churches did and i of course the divine part of the interpretation i tried to place it up on there myself the best that i know how but brother branham did say the choices of the seven messengers was from the lord which is proven true because brother brahm did not get the names of the messengers or stars from larkin uriah smith or any other historian or preacher let's listen to the quote you might disagree but i sat there for days and days under inspiration until i felt the holy spirit's strength that's reason i know and watch these man that has been picked if you're a historian there's the same man that i have got here and know by revelation that they was the angels to the church they had the same ministry that these did at the beginning and that ministry cannot change it must save pentecost all the way through important quotes regarding the seven church ages and seven seals i feel compelled to share the following quotes to help followers of brother branham's end time message to better understand his ministry in the seven church ages and in the seven seals first brother branham said the messengers always came at the end of their ages a simple comparison of the timeline shows that is not the case it's more common that the messengers came at the beginning of their ages here's the quote about the messengers always coming at the end of the age ages its messenger we know that paul was the first messenger and when the first trumpet sounded and the first seal was tore loose paul was the first messenger as we that jesus had produced to them remember paul come at the end of the age all the messengers come at the end of the age it's at the end time when these things are brought forth at the end of the pentecost nation we are supposed to receive according to the word as god help me tonight to show you you hear that we are to see receive a messenger that will take all those who sins out there and reveal the whole secret of god by the master of the church and here's a simple chart that shows the messengers came at the beginning of their ages except for columba so here you see paul came at the beginning of the ephesian church age arenas finished his ministry at the beginning of the sumerian church age martin lived his entire life during the beginning of his church age the pergamian church age and again according to brother ramsey's dates columbus did not live during his church age the third tier in church age but as i wrote in my 2021 book it seems likely that the thyroidian age started around 560. because there was a holy ghost and power movement in frigia from 560 to 565 that resembled the day of pentecost as all nine gifts of the spirit were honored and operated so it seems likely thyrotira began with the revival just as laodicea began with the 1906 azusa street revival and of course this is my own opinion this is the most logical answer i could come up by comparing church history with the scriptures there you can see martin luther came at the beginning of his church age along with john wesley the beginning of his church age the philadelphian church age and lastly brother branham came at the beginning of his church age the current church age laodicea and again friends not to be critical but remember the quote from the first seal when brother branham said at the end of the pentecostal age we're supposed to receive a messenger which of course was speaking of brother ram's ministry again i don't bring these quotes out to criticize brother branham but just to show that not every word was thus saith the lord we must do as the bible says rightly divide the word of truth we must be honest with ourselves and we must remain humble and prove all things as the bible says and search the scriptures daily whether these things be so and be ready to give an answer to every man who asketh of the hope that we have within us so an honest look at the church ages sermons will show that not every word brother branham said during the church ages was thus saith the lord here in the patmos vision which was part of the church age series brother branham said the revelation 6 white horse writer was the word and he said it was the same white horse writer of revelation 19 but as you probably know during the first seal brother ram said the revelation 6 white horse rider was the antichrist let's listen to the quote when the white horse there was six when the white horse rider went forth he was giving up a bull to conquer and to conquer and a sword went out of his mouth what was he the white horse rider of revelations notice the sword out of his mouth goes a sharp two-eighth sword a word and finally by his word when it's made manifest to all the sons of god he owned his validation down with his words and of course friends as you know if you listen to the seven seals brother ram said the white horse rider was the antichrist not the holy [Music] spirit antichrist that deceitful spirit has gone now and crept in so again this shows not every word on tape as thus saith the lord and brother ram could grow in revelation like all of us can regarding the seven seals notice that not every word brother branham preached during this seven seals series was thus saith the lord as proven by the following two quotes and of course there's probably more examples the first example is brother branham said there were 700 who did not bow the knee to bail but then later corrected it and said there were seven thousand let's listen to the quotes now wait a minute wait a minute wait midline's running and i got 700 to hit out around the united states you don't know where they're at god said i'm going to open up on the seals and show you something he said you know i got 700 back there that ain't never about anita joined any of them created denominations there's 700 of them ready for the ranch early first kings 19 brother branham i believe that the number who did not bow the knee was set yeah that's right 700 instead thank you that's correct for 767 000. brother seven thousand to the 700. i see that the second example is that brother branham said he could make someone's head swim and then immediately after he apologized now friends god doesn't apologize god doesn't make mistakes so brother adam's human statement that he could make someone's head swim and confuse them was not thus saith the lord because he apologized about it he made a mistake as he admitted let's listen to the quotes it just goes to show that people without the baptism and our call to the office of a minister has no business to be in the pulpit right i i can take that person out by the help of god and time is such an eye to make her head swim look don't know what i don't mean i don't sound like forgiving i didn't mean that lord i didn't know i felt he checked me on that see so i didn't even sit that way i'm sorry i believe that the holy spirit could reveal to that person some secret that sounds better it's just like tuning a instrument when you do something wrong you can tell each christian you said something wrong he didn't like that see that was putting me in there see i ain't in the picture at all i'm just going to be myself for nothing just him let him do the work so these examples would help anyone who would say well i'm taking brother branham's statements during the seven seals because they were more inspired while it's true brother branham felt the seven seals were the most inspired sermons of his ministry it doesn't mean every word in the seven seals series was thus saith the lord as we've just proven this means we still have to rightly divide the word of truth in the sermons on the seven seals before moving on here's a quote where brother brahm said colombo was the third church age messenger and also said martin was the fourth church age messenger but again according to this picture from the church age book and other quotes this was likely a slip of brother ram's tongue as he simply switched the third and fourth messengers let's listen to the quotes the third church age which was pergamos was saint columbia which was a great saint of god during the time of the dark age and the persecution of the fourth age and the fourth count saint martin of taurus the great saint coming from france here's a quote from brother branham where he says the revelations from the seven seals and the church ages were thus saith the lord as you listen to the quote consider these human errors that we've heard in the seven seals and in the church ages so this statement by brother branham can only mean that the revelations in the church ages and the seals were thus saith the lord and not every word on the tape was thus saith the lord let's listen to the quote now the vision plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together so i could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of god and the vision and the revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith the lord history about columba to go along with the history brother branham used about columba in the church age book here's a few more details i found while researching columba for my 2021 book on pages 448 and 449 in my book i wrote the fire tier in church age 606 to 1520 in revelation chapter 2 verses 18 through 29. star columba is the angel star to this age he was born of royal blood in northern ireland but thankfully his father fergus valued jesus's cross more than his physical royal blood fergus diligently taught colomba the scripture kalama became a powerful missionary after hearing jesus's audible voice call him into missionary work some historians place columbus supernatural missionary works in second place after jesus apostles two testimonies stick out in regards to god's power to save the lost visiting one heathen city columba prayed outside the gates while magicians inside the city tried to drown out his voice god increased the volume of his prayers until the holy spirit swung open the gates so heathens could hear and receive christ a second similar testimony is told of columba praying to enter a walled city being refused entrance he turned to leave but the chief's son became violently ill and the chief called for colomba to pray for his son after the chief repented god healed the son and christ won souls in the city dr craig lamp credits columbus work of preserving god's word in the dark ages with making the reformation possible in 563 a.d columbus started a bible college in iona located in western scotland it's believed the barren ionian ground turned fruitful after columba planted seeds with one hand and lifted the other in prayer to jesus lamp says columbus college would continue through the dark ages the vast majority of evangelism that took place for the next 700 years took place as a result of that bible college due to its great missionary efforts the island was nicknamed the isle of the saints from it flowed many missionaries into scotland ireland and england building missionary villages was their main method of winning souls small groups of saints who were builders preachers and teachers would raise walls around their newly formed community and make converse of those who moved into their village faithful preachers and teachers were established among the new converts and trained to repeat this method these christian villages remained independent from rome and government aid keeping the true faith alive in jesus little flock during the awful dark ages few men of god had such lasting and far-reaching influence as columba in closing friends i hope this video was a blessing it's so important to see today that god sent a prophet named william branham and he sent him with thus saith the lord's statements but not every word brother branham said was thus saith the lord friends we've got to allow brother branham to be human but also a prophet of god and it's extremely important that we follow the bible commands that tell us to prove all things search the scriptures daily whether these things are so to have an answer for every man who asks you of the reason of the hope that you have within you and the command to rightly divide the word of truth may god help preachers and all other believers to be humble to be willing to answer questions and be honest before the people that we may be faithful stewards to the gospel of jesus christ if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me [Music] god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
