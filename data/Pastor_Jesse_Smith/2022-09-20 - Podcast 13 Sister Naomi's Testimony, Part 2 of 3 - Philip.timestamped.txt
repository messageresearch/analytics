[0:10] God bless you and welcome to the
[0:12] defending the message podcast I'm your
[0:14] co-host Pastor Jesse Smith joined by and
[0:16] I'm Eamon Lee we're happy to be here
[0:18] recording another podcast we're doing
[0:21] part two of our sister Naomi's testimony
[0:23] I'm sure you're blessed by part one and
[0:25] before we get started with part two I
[0:27] just want to share that as we were doing
[0:29] part one and I was listening to the type
[0:31] of testimony God has given our sister I
[0:34] was just thinking about who her
[0:36] testimony would speak to and I thought
[0:39] about Austin's testimony and brother
[0:41] amen's testimony in my own testimony and
[0:43] you know Amen in my testimony we did
[0:45] that first I spoke to people that were
[0:47] raised in denomination and that God can
[0:49] bring us to a greater light and then you
[0:51] know brother Austin's testimony speaks
[0:52] to people who are out in the world and
[0:55] are trapped in demonic oppression or
[0:57] trapped in drug abuse and God is able to
[1:00] reach the very depths of Despair and
[1:02] rescue people out of the depths of
[1:04] Despair and bring them into Marvelous
[1:06] Light the Bible says he saves to the
[1:07] uttermost and it's just a beautiful
[1:09] scripture there in the book of he
[1:10] Hebrews how he ever lives to make
[1:12] intercession Christ is sitting on the
[1:14] throne right now living just Desiring to
[1:16] rescue people whether it's out of
[1:18] denomination or whether it's out of drug
[1:20] abuse or the world and then you know as
[1:22] we're listening to our sister's
[1:23] testimony it just struck me like wow
[1:25] this is a wonderful testimony for all
[1:27] these Saints who have been raised inside
[1:28] the message amen and I Austin were not
[1:31] raising the message but sister Naomi was
[1:33] raising the message a wonderful Message
[1:35] Church where we heard they had
[1:36] discernments and and tongues and
[1:39] interpretations and prophecies a a
[1:41] church where the gifts of the holy
[1:43] spirit were very active which we're very
[1:44] thankful for and so I just was blessed
[1:47] to know that this testimony will be a
[1:49] great help to our young girls in our
[1:51] church and also our young boys in our
[1:53] church that even if you're raising the
[1:55] message it doesn't diminish your
[1:57] testimony at all in fact if you're
[1:58] faithful while you're raising the
[1:59] message or raising the truth your
[2:01] testimony is even greater because it's
[2:03] just like Jesus Christ he he never
[2:05] sinned so he was faithful to God he was
[2:06] faithful the whole time and he's exalted
[2:09] to the highest place in all the universe
[2:11] of course he was without sin but will
[2:13] sin but I just want to just start with
[2:15] that introduction and I think we left
[2:17] off on our sister's testimony about the
[2:18] time she was in senior high or college I
[2:21] think the the term is so pick up right
[2:23] where we left off
[2:24] before we begin first I want to
[2:26] apologize for the low quality of our
[2:28] sister Naomi's voice this is my fault as
[2:31] I forgot to change the audio in setting
[2:34] when we were recording the podcast so
[2:36] please forgive me for that but hopefully
[2:38] you can still hear her voice if you turn
[2:40] up your volume to maximum
[2:42] foreign
[2:48] life so can you share some of the
[2:51] battles you went through in college
[2:53] and some of the things you had to
[2:55] overcome okay so in college I got to
[2:58] college before I turned 17 so I was
[3:00] I was pretty young and
[3:04] once again away from home
[3:06] but then back in back in high school
[3:10] I mean I was I was associated with
[3:12] Christians but who were in denomination
[3:15] so not Christians and messy churches but
[3:17] I got to college and I got I met a few
[3:21] um believers
[3:23] so I was like oh okay cool so
[3:26] I'm not going to be the only one who's
[3:28] going to be in security I mean usually
[3:30] when you get to places you're looking
[3:31] for people who are identify with
[3:33] yourself
[3:34] you're not going to be the only person
[3:36] who is going to be in skirts and stuff
[3:37] like that
[3:38] so I was I was happy about that
[3:42] during the College Years we did not have
[3:45] a church on campus we have this
[3:47] fellowship and then we meet only on
[3:49] Wednesdays then on Sunday we go out to
[3:53] church there were a few churches on
[3:56] campus but they were not messy churches
[3:58] so you have to go out and then
[4:00] go to church I mean like pay for public
[4:03] transportation and sometimes I did not
[4:05] have money like I said we grew up with
[4:08] very little so sometimes I did not have
[4:09] money yet I could not afford to
[4:12] take public transport and go so and I
[4:16] did not want to miss church so I just go
[4:18] to some of the churches around
[4:21] and
[4:22] sometimes in the evening I have like
[4:25] um
[4:26] fellow Believers come to to my to me the
[4:29] Hostile in the acts like why weren't you
[4:31] in church today and
[4:33] I'm like oh I went to church but I went
[4:37] to one of the churches on campus and
[4:38] that's like I had sinned and they say
[4:42] all sorts of things like you shouldn't
[4:43] be doing that you should go to church
[4:45] and it's not like I don't want to go to
[4:47] church but it was because I did not have
[4:49] money for the transportation so I'd
[4:51] rather just stay on campus and walk to
[4:53] church
[4:54] can I ask you where these people and
[4:56] like The Message Church they were asking
[4:58] yes yes message charges there was there
[5:01] were some two were coming from my home
[5:02] Church
[5:04] I mean those were the ones I was close
[5:06] to so those were the ones that would
[5:07] come to my hostel and then say all sorts
[5:10] of things again because
[5:12] and I think it got to a point they felt
[5:14] like I did not believe the message I was
[5:15] falling away so I don't know if it was
[5:17] their way of bringing me back but I mean
[5:20] deep down I knew it wasn't like I was
[5:22] falling away but like I did not I just
[5:24] did not have money and when I go there I
[5:28] see all the things that are wrong I see
[5:30] all the things but of course you pick
[5:32] one or two things that that are good
[5:34] some things they they were pretty
[5:36] sermons that will speak to your heart
[5:37] and but they made it sound like one you
[5:40] cannot once you believe the message you
[5:42] cannot go you just can't go to any other
[5:44] church because they don't have anything
[5:46] there and because of some of these
[5:48] things on Wednesdays when you meet for
[5:51] the fellowships
[5:53] might be past certain comments and
[5:56] makes it feel like you don't know what
[5:59] you're doing like you do not believe the
[6:00] message so I struggled a lot with how we
[6:05] can't accept each other how we can't
[6:08] encourage each other but then amongst
[6:10] our own selves it looks like they had
[6:12] kind of figured out who is who is the
[6:15] Christian who is more message believer
[6:17] and who is not who is like fake and
[6:20] unfortunately I was put in the fake
[6:22] categories
[6:23] one time I remember the way we went to a
[6:26] fellowship and then he was he was like
[6:29] that Patron or something like that and
[6:31] that he was talking about the sisters
[6:34] and those who are believing the message
[6:35] and those who are living a holy life and
[6:37] I wasn't doing anything bad
[6:39] because we're living a holy life and
[6:41] then some of us were not part of it so
[6:44] it was like when the brothers come in
[6:46] they were they're looking for
[6:47] recommendations for wife I know the ones
[6:49] who are marriageable here and those who
[6:52] are not and I'm like so I mean I still
[6:56] went to church though but I still went
[6:58] for the fellowship but I I had my own
[7:00] reservations about it and how we
[7:03] couldn't love one another and how we're
[7:05] able to like be very judgmental
[7:08] and then decide who is more Christian
[7:10] than the other based of what we see when
[7:13] you can see the person's heart because
[7:15] there are a few of them that now have
[7:18] left the message and stuff like that
[7:20] yeah did anyone at any time offer to
[7:23] give you a ride to the message church or
[7:25] offer to give you money so you could go
[7:27] to the right Church no I'm not
[7:32] I'm not too sure what I was doing wrong
[7:34] but
[7:36] people felt like I was I was not in the
[7:39] message I did not believe I don't know I
[7:41] I'm not sure what I was doing wrong
[7:43] that was the General perception about me
[7:46] I'm not too sure it was because I had
[7:48] gone to college I mean there were a lot
[7:51] of sisters in college so I'm not too
[7:52] sure and I mean I grew up in the message
[7:55] but I
[7:58] I never wanted it to be like I'm being
[8:00] forced to do something I don't want to
[8:01] do
[8:02] I always tell my dad I have to
[8:04] understand the reason why I'm doing this
[8:07] I have to understand the reason why I am
[8:09] not doing this
[8:10] so
[8:12] and it wasn't like major sense but like
[8:15] a few little things here and there okay
[8:17] we should do this why should we do this
[8:19] why should we do that so I think
[8:21] probably sometimes when I'm having those
[8:23] conversations with them I'm asking all
[8:25] those Horizons and things like that then
[8:27] it makes it sound like maybe you don't
[8:30] you don't really believe at all so I
[8:32] don't know maybe
[8:34] that's the only thing I can think of no
[8:36] that's good uh I found just in the
[8:38] message you know there's people that
[8:39] have lots of questions and people that
[8:41] don't so God has a variety of people you
[8:43] know some people want to know why other
[8:45] people just say well I'll just believe
[8:47] it they're not very inquisitive I'm I'm
[8:49] the kind like I have lots of questions
[8:50] that's why I like doing questions and
[8:52] answers
[8:53] but uh yeah there's certain people that
[8:56] can be judgmental at times if you don't
[8:58] do everything they want you to do and I
[9:01] you know honestly I and I preached this
[9:02] recently uh I feel like pride is one of
[9:04] the greatest stumbling blocks in the
[9:06] message because we can if we're not
[9:08] careful we can clean the outside of the
[9:10] cup and not clean the inside of the cup
[9:12] uh that's and that's what happens like
[9:14] our like our sister said there was
[9:15] people criticizing her about not going
[9:18] the right church but then later they
[9:19] fall away and she's standing on the word
[9:21] okay
[9:22] so they're obviously the inside of their
[9:25] hearts were not clean but your heart was
[9:27] clean you were doing all you could do
[9:28] and you just wanted to have questions
[9:30] and you just could go where you just
[9:32] went wherever you could go based upon
[9:34] your your financial status which I know
[9:36] God honored that because like brother M
[9:38] said you can't go to the church with the
[9:39] whole loaf of bread go where you can get
[9:41] a slice so you were being uh as a real
[9:44] Christian by just wanting to go to
[9:46] church and making sure you went every
[9:47] Sunday and that's what Jesus modeled in
[9:49] Luke chapter four
[9:50] so one of the things that I can remember
[9:52] I was being criticized about it was they
[9:55] were very hard on your hair as a sister
[9:57] there are certain things you can you can
[10:00] add to your hair they were very
[10:01] practical about the type of hair as a
[10:04] sister you can carry what you should use
[10:06] to braid to the hair and what you
[10:07] shouldn't used to and I wasn't really
[10:11] convinced about it so I did what I
[10:14] believed in then so that was also one of
[10:16] the things that made them come hard
[10:18] Against Me Do they have any scripture
[10:21] for like how you could braid your hair
[10:22] or the standards that they were holding
[10:24] did they point you to any Scripture
[10:26] none that I know so without any
[10:28] Scripture to support their particular
[10:30] guidelines for braiding sister's hair
[10:32] then those guidelines are simply
[10:34] man-made opinions and with all due
[10:36] respect man-made guidelines are man-made
[10:39] standards of course we want to respect
[10:41] other Christian standards but it's sad
[10:43] some people would criticize you for not
[10:45] following their own man-made guidelines
[10:47] you are able to agree to disagree and
[10:50] show respect to those who are
[10:51] criticizing you but in your own heart
[10:53] the Holy Ghost had given you different
[10:54] convictions and so you could only honor
[10:56] the convictions that God had put in your
[10:58] heart the convictions that you
[11:00] understood by the word of God but again
[11:02] God allowed you to go through these
[11:04] tests of criticism as Trials of your
[11:06] faith after you were filled with the
[11:07] holy ghost from a young age we're on 12
[11:09] years old and by the grace of God you
[11:11] pass those tests
[11:12] foreign
[11:17] anything else you want to share about
[11:18] the college experience if
[11:25] I mean everybody wants to look cute and
[11:27] they're put in all their dresses and
[11:29] stuff like that
[11:30] you put on your skin cell I've had
[11:33] comments like
[11:34] you this is not from the message
[11:37] Believers but like from friends like you
[11:40] act like you're the only Christian and
[11:41] why don't you dress like in your
[11:44] bathroom
[11:45] things like that but I mean I I had a
[11:49] few too that just accepted me for who I
[11:52] was like this is how I guess in the
[11:54] accepted and I remember one time I had a
[11:57] friend tell me about it he said he was
[11:59] gonna laugh at me
[12:01] when he sees me in hell
[12:03] he's gonna forget about his suffering
[12:05] and laugh at me because of the way I'm
[12:08] carrying myself about if if I end up in
[12:11] Hell he's
[12:12] he's going to forget about his suffering
[12:14] and he really laugh at me so
[12:16] that was one of the things that he said
[12:19] it in I think he probably said it as a
[12:21] joke but it just stayed with me I'm like
[12:25] I need to make it at all cost I don't
[12:28] have to let what he said come to us I I
[12:31] have to make it at all because so
[12:33] I mean he said it but it has stayed with
[12:35] me all these years and I still remember
[12:37] it so so some of the things that
[12:39] kept me going like you don't have to
[12:42] fall you need to stand for praise God so
[12:45] what was he criticizing was he
[12:46] criticizing your holy and modest dress
[12:49] style
[12:50] how I was living differently how I was
[12:53] dressed and
[12:55] forsaken everything like I'm I'm
[12:58] forsaken all the fun that is going on
[13:01] now so if if I end up in hell and then
[13:04] he also finds himself in hell
[13:06] then he's gonna laugh at me because I
[13:09] did not enjoy all the pleasures on Earth
[13:11] and I mean the same place on here as him
[13:14] well he's so deceived the Bible says
[13:16] that Moses gave up the pleasures of sin
[13:20] for a season praise God to take the way
[13:22] with God's people so that's what you've
[13:24] done
[13:25] and God certainly Vindicated your life
[13:27] as a real Christian Life
[13:29] you know hindsight is always 20 20 right
[13:31] we can always learn as time passes time
[13:33] is the great Vindicator of everything so
[13:35] Looking Back Now sister on some of these
[13:38] people that were very judgmental some
[13:40] that may have criticized you and never
[13:42] offered to help but never had enough
[13:44] maybe discernment or care to know that
[13:47] you would have liked to gone to a
[13:48] different church and and also some of
[13:51] these other ones that maybe said some
[13:52] really harsh words
[13:54] what have you seen in all these years
[13:55] since you've left College what kind of
[13:58] lives have they lived have they stayed
[14:00] true to the word have some of them
[14:01] stayed true have they all Fallen away
[14:03] are they all faithful if you could share
[14:05] something on that that would be really
[14:07] interesting
[14:08] I know a few that are still still in
[14:10] church and then a couple of them have
[14:12] fallen away so
[14:15] um I think I've seen one on Facebook and
[14:18] she's living like a completely different
[14:20] like I'm not in touch with her but I saw
[14:22] it on Facebook she's living a completely
[14:24] different life a couple of them are no
[14:26] longer in the message
[14:29] I think some of them did not even
[14:31] believe there is good so
[14:36] yeah that's a common thing we see in our
[14:39] own message church and also what we saw
[14:40] in denominations too some of the people
[14:42] that were the most may be critical or
[14:45] said some of the harshest things
[14:46] seemingly to stand up for Holiness or
[14:50] stand up for a higher standard some of
[14:52] them have fallen away so to me it's that
[14:54] idea of the fact that they were critical
[14:57] or maybe or said very harsh words that
[14:59] was a sign of a sinful condition that
[15:01] was some leaven in their lives and if
[15:04] they wouldn't repent of that 11 that 11
[15:06] is only going to grow and it's going to
[15:07] leaven the whole lump and so that's what
[15:10] we've seen with different individuals if
[15:12] they won't confess one sin if they won't
[15:14] repent and overcome their current sin
[15:17] whether it's greed or lust or fear or
[15:21] unbelief or in this case criticism or
[15:25] maybe even legalism if they won't
[15:27] confess that then that sin will eat them
[15:29] alive it'll ruin their spiritual life
[15:31] and then they'll be atheists then
[15:33] they'll leave the message and they'll
[15:35] leave the nomination and they'll no
[15:36] longer serve God because they didn't
[15:37] take care of their own sins so this is a
[15:40] great testimony about how to overcome
[15:41] persecution
[15:43] foreign
[15:47] things that the Lord LED you to do that
[15:49] helped you overcome criticism and some
[15:51] of these harsh words and persecution or
[15:54] feeling like no one cared and no one
[15:56] would even ask you if you needed a ride
[15:59] to the right Church
[16:08] this was the truth like I was I was
[16:11] settled in my heart I did not have any
[16:14] questions about about the message and
[16:16] the truth of it the questions I had was
[16:19] more about the people so I when I when I
[16:23] went out I was out of home college and
[16:25] stuff I I didn't have any problem with
[16:27] the message that it was wrong or
[16:29] anything like that but the main the main
[16:32] thing was how we're not able to love one
[16:34] another like Christian love I was not
[16:37] seeing Christian love I had gone to a
[16:39] couple of churches
[16:41] and then I had seen how they treated one
[16:43] another so it always kind of disturbed
[16:47] me why is it that we who have the
[16:50] message we are not able to love on one
[16:52] another like
[16:54] like we showed but then when I go out
[16:56] saying denominations I see how
[16:59] they love one another so this kind of
[17:01] really stumbled me
[17:03] but then I couldn't go to any other
[17:06] Church
[17:07] I really wanted to go
[17:09] but I couldn't go anywhere because
[17:11] during college Years I had been to a
[17:13] couple of churches and I knew like this
[17:16] was not the truth this is not this is
[17:18] not a Christian thing
[17:20] so I couldn't go to any other Church and
[17:23] I mean if if you're honest with yourself
[17:26] if you've sat under this message
[17:29] everywhere else like denominations will
[17:31] just not feel right you you can't sit
[17:34] under it and feel okay so I was I was in
[17:37] it but that was what stumbled me it
[17:40] wasn't it wasn't really the message but
[17:42] it was it was the people so I just had
[17:45] to
[17:46] accept it and kind of live with it and
[17:49] then
[17:50] I go to church I'm like so this one
[17:53] scripture that really helped me was seek
[17:55] your own salvation with trembling and
[17:57] fear like your own salvation gets you
[18:00] your life right with God because if
[18:03] anything God is not going to ask why why
[18:05] why did you do this because that person
[18:07] did that or you don't have to you I mean
[18:10] you wouldn't have to answer for someone
[18:11] else
[18:12] you would have to answer for your own
[18:14] self so one thing that really one
[18:16] scripture that really helped me was
[18:18] Secure own salvation with trembling and
[18:21] fear and then with with house also
[18:23] growing up with very little
[18:26] I mean um it seemed like
[18:29] the message was like was like for poor
[18:32] people
[18:34] so going to college and starting to work
[18:37] I I never wanted it to be like
[18:40] I believe the message because we were
[18:42] poor
[18:43] and now that God has blessed me like I'm
[18:46] doing okay now I want to go out there
[18:49] and have fun and live that kind of life
[18:52] so that was also one thing that
[18:54] checked me because I knew I knew it was
[18:57] the truth and I never wanted it to be
[18:59] like after God blessed me I have kind of
[19:02] deserted him God blessed me and I've
[19:04] turned my back the things that I used to
[19:07] um
[19:08] say we're wrong
[19:10] now um I'm going back to do them I I
[19:13] never wanted that to be my my testimony
[19:16] so
[19:17] I think it was just God God just helped
[19:20] me and he settled it in my heart at a
[19:23] very young age that this is truth
[19:26] and then that guided me that helped me
[19:30] through
[19:31] all the times I was away from home and
[19:33] meeting people and going through
[19:35] everything I went to I knew it was the
[19:38] truth
[19:39] and then seek your salvation with
[19:41] trembling and fear it is you and God so
[19:44] seek seek your salvation
[19:47] yeah so it seems like the fact that you
[19:49] got born again when you were 10 or 11
[19:52] was the the pivotal point of your whole
[19:54] life God had to see what the holy ghost
[19:56] at such a young age because of the huge
[19:58] trials that were coming forth in senior
[20:00] high in college and that was the
[20:03] settling in your heart the Seal of God
[20:05] in your soul unto the day of your
[20:07] Redemption and regarding Christian love
[20:09] you know brother Eamon and I did a whole
[20:10] podcast on that we can recognize you
[20:12] know sometimes uh message churches have
[20:14] the most truth but if they're not
[20:15] careful if they get in complexes or if
[20:18] some of them don't get born again
[20:20] the very people that should have the
[20:22] love of God sometimes don't have the
[20:23] love of God and sometimes we've gone
[20:25] we've gone to certain denominational
[20:26] churches and we felt more of God's love
[20:28] there than we did at a message church
[20:30] that may have had like complexes or
[20:32] maybe just some sin in the church you
[20:34] know that's very interesting to see that
[20:36] that you know even you had the same
[20:37] experience in your country that we had
[20:40] also in the United States where we want
[20:42] to go to a church that has truth but we
[20:44] also want to be loved at the same time
[20:45] and that's what Jesus said Jesus said
[20:47] the love of many shall wax cold because
[20:48] iniquity will bound
[20:50] so a lot of times we don't feel love in
[20:52] certain churches because iniquities in
[20:54] there again like the leaven the spread
[20:56] of sin in the church if it's not taken
[20:58] care of and the people won't love each
[21:00] other like they ought to and you gave us
[21:02] the answer Philippians chapter two I'm
[21:04] gonna look that up real quick so you
[21:05] answered it wonderfully and there was
[21:07] your scripture the Holy Spirit gave you
[21:08] Philippians 2 verse 12 work out your own
[21:11] salvation with fear and trembling so
[21:13] despite the inconsistencies of message
[21:16] peoples testimonies or even
[21:18] denominational people's testimonies the
[21:20] Holy Spirit showed you and brought down
[21:22] to the fact where it's between God and
[21:24] each individual like Jesus said I stand
[21:26] the door and knock and if any man will
[21:28] open unto me I'll come in and sup with
[21:30] him and he with me praise God so
[21:32] trusting that that scripture Philippians
[21:34] 2 12 mean a lot to the listeners and if
[21:36] you know anyone you know who's in the
[21:37] midst of struggling with persecution or
[21:40] being mistreated even amongst Believers
[21:42] share that scripture with them and let
[21:44] them know that or their main focus
[21:45] should be serving the lord Jesus Christ
[21:47] loving Jesus Christ because they'll be
[21:49] judged individually if they they can
[21:51] overcome Jesus will reward them and
[21:54] that's what he's looking for he's
[21:55] looking for individual Overcomers
[22:02] okay we're gonna fast forward to the
[22:04] time you left college and came to the
[22:06] United States and maybe you can tell a
[22:08] little bit about how you traveled here a
[22:11] little bit like how you met your husband
[22:13] and how that all came together
[22:16] so
[22:19] I had a hard time getting a job it was
[22:22] it was tough God was good he saw he sold
[22:25] me through and then my dad helped out
[22:27] and I got a job and I had to
[22:29] completely move out of town and go to
[22:32] like a whole different regions so I had
[22:35] to move to a completely different region
[22:37] and I was there for probably about two
[22:40] or three years
[22:42] over there too
[22:44] there was a small church that that I was
[22:47] going to one thing I like to say is
[22:49] probably thankfully where have I found
[22:51] myself God has always directed me to a
[22:53] mercy church God has always directed me
[22:56] wherever I found myself I find myself to
[22:58] a message and I'm very thankful for that
[23:01] because that has also kept me so for my
[23:04] husband I was I was in college with him
[23:06] and then
[23:07] who were friends and then we we used to
[23:11] talk and then it was I applied to school
[23:13] I applied for a school over here I mean
[23:16] we talked about marriage and
[23:19] it was it was a hard one for me because
[23:23] I mean I was married was something I was
[23:25] very very scared of
[23:27] because I knew once you're going to read
[23:29] it for life so
[23:30] I was very scared of it I was very
[23:33] hesitant
[23:35] I mean I was praying for it but I was
[23:37] still scared of it
[23:38] so when
[23:40] when we're talking I mean I had to he
[23:43] was here he was in the U.S so if I was
[23:45] we're going to get married I have to
[23:47] come here
[23:48] and one of the things I was
[23:51] I had to apply for school
[23:54] and then go through the Visa process and
[23:56] all that and one of the things I was
[23:58] praying about was
[24:00] if this if this is not going to be the
[24:03] will of God if
[24:05] come in here
[24:07] is going to make me fall away from the
[24:10] message
[24:11] that when I go into apply for Visa I
[24:14] should be denied
[24:16] that was that was my prayer I mean I
[24:20] mean everybody wants to come to the U.S
[24:24] it's like the big thing everybody wants
[24:26] to come here bad
[24:28] I mean I wasn't too
[24:29] it'll be nice if I come but it wasn't
[24:31] anything I was so excited for and I was
[24:34] praying God give me let me be granted
[24:36] the Visa and all that my siblings were
[24:38] pretty excited because I mean you're
[24:39] traveling to the US but I wasn't too
[24:41] excited about it and we're praying about
[24:44] it but
[24:45] for me every time I prayed about it it
[24:48] wasn't like God give me Visa Lord I mean
[24:52] Lord when I go let me be granted Visa
[24:54] but my prayer was like if coming here
[24:56] will make me fall away from the feet
[24:58] then let me be denied so I'm like
[25:03] what when I go into when I go into for
[25:07] the visa interview whatever results that
[25:10] come
[25:11] if I'm granted then it means God has
[25:14] God God says when I come here I'm still
[25:17] going to stand if I get denied then it
[25:20] means this is not for me so
[25:22] that was I fasted I prayed about it and
[25:26] I wasn't I wasn't really excited about
[25:28] it because I wasn't too sure I had I had
[25:31] seen a couple of people who had traveled
[25:33] out here and have fallen away from the
[25:35] faith so I was I was like really scared
[25:38] and like I earlier said I never wanted
[25:40] it to be like God has blessed me and I
[25:43] turned my back on him I I never wanted
[25:46] that so I'm like if coming here will
[25:48] make me fall
[25:49] then I shouldn't come
[25:52] I went through the visa application and
[25:54] all that went for the interview it was a
[25:56] very like quick smoothie interview
[25:59] wasn't finished I couldn't believe I was
[26:01] done and I had been grounded I'm like
[26:02] wow
[26:05] so
[26:06] I mean my siblings were excited but
[26:10] I was thinking like really deep I'm like
[26:13] I I never wanted to be my testimony that
[26:17] and that thing that my friend told me in
[26:20] college about he laughing at me you know
[26:22] like it also stuck with me like I never
[26:24] wanted anything that will make me fall
[26:27] away from that Faith so
[26:29] I had to trust God that if I had been
[26:32] granted he's gonna
[26:35] see me too so we got married and then
[26:37] I came here
[26:39] and I had probably been here like I came
[26:43] in as a student so I came in during
[26:45] summer but when I came in I did not
[26:48] start right away I started in fall
[26:52] so when I started
[26:54] I was I was looking for a message church
[26:57] when I started school I was looking for
[26:59] a message because then I had been here a
[27:01] couple of months and I hadn't been
[27:02] teaching
[27:04] I mean I was going to denomination but
[27:07] I wanted I wanted to go to church like
[27:10] like in church so
[27:13] I I Googled around to see if there were
[27:15] message charges near me but there was
[27:18] there was really none all the ones I was
[27:20] Finding was like very far away I just
[27:22] forgot about it
[27:24] and then one time I was in the library
[27:26] and I was learning and it just dropped
[27:28] in my heart like look for a church
[27:31] and then I Googled again and
[27:34] I found one from one in Columbus
[27:38] for my Columbus that's far and then too
[27:41] I was now driving I was now learning how
[27:43] to drive so I wasn't that good of a
[27:45] driver to go that far
[27:48] so
[27:49] I called the Columbus
[27:51] I think did I I texted him I'm like I
[27:54] mean Akron and I need a church so do you
[27:57] know of any church near us near me and
[28:00] then he said oh yeah there's a church in
[28:02] Akron I was like oh nice so he gave me
[28:05] the pictures contract and
[28:07] I'm like okay so after a couple of days
[28:09] I texted amen I think I did not hear
[28:12] back so I'm like okay
[28:14] maybe I shouldn't even go
[28:17] there after a while I'm like I think
[28:20] after about a week I'm like I need to
[28:21] send it six again so I send the text
[28:23] again and then he responded and gave me
[28:27] the church the church address and I went
[28:30] there I'm like okay yeah so once I went
[28:32] I'm like okay now I'm finally home this
[28:35] is this is where I'm supposed to be at
[28:38] yeah that's where I've been mental now
[28:40] and
[28:42] I can't even say how much the church has
[28:44] been of a person so
[28:47] I I believe God knows the intents of our
[28:50] hearts and
[28:51] if you're sincere I'm not I'm not saying
[28:54] that to
[28:55] sound prideful but if you're sincere I
[28:58] believe that God knows the intent of
[29:00] your heart and if you want to stand for
[29:02] him he would he will definitely make a
[29:05] way for you
[29:08] I mean I always look back
[29:11] and then where I am now I know it's an
[29:14] unsaid prayer it is God that has
[29:16] answered my prayer and I'm still here
[29:18] I'm still standing
[29:21] a couple of years ago I had it
[29:23] a friend from college he contacted me on
[29:27] Facebook he's like I hope you're still
[29:28] wearing your dresses and your skirts and
[29:30] you're still dressing nicely and I was
[29:32] like oh okay so at least people were
[29:35] noticing that I was dressing nicely I
[29:38] mean in college nobody ever like
[29:40] commended me or anything like that so it
[29:43] was nice to know that okay so people
[29:46] still remember that I was I was dressing
[29:49] Madison so when when he sent me that
[29:51] text I was like whoa what if I had
[29:54] fallen away what would have my response
[29:56] been so
[29:57] yeah I'm thankful to be here I'm
[29:59] thankful for how God has kept me
[30:01] standing so now and I I believe you'll
[30:04] see me through to the end
[30:06] that's a great testimony for all
[30:08] believers to see you know as you started
[30:09] working there you know you had to move
[30:11] to a new region and God provided a home
[30:13] church for you I mean how many times
[30:15] have we talked about that like we
[30:16] instruct the people don't go anywhere
[30:17] don't move anywhere unless you have a
[30:19] good home Church
[30:20] and so every time our sister moved or
[30:22] every time she did something God raised
[30:24] up a wonderful Church where she could go
[30:27] and hear the word of God and also I want
[30:29] to point out just the fact about praying
[30:31] about marriage praying about applying
[30:33] for school praying about the Visa this
[30:36] is something we all can learn right
[30:37] especially our Young Generation you know
[30:39] and reminders for our for those of us
[30:40] who are older in the faith maybe pray
[30:43] about everything and our sister showed
[30:45] how we want to pray and be neutral about
[30:48] everything I like how she kind of laid a
[30:51] fleece like Gideon lay a fleece before
[30:52] the Lord Lord let this go well if you
[30:54] want me to go and God answered really
[30:56] quickly right so she clearly knew it was
[30:59] God's will for her life now that's a
[31:01] prayer we all should pray Lord do
[31:03] whatever you need to do to keep me
[31:04] standing wherever you need to send me
[31:06] whatever you need to allow to happen in
[31:08] my life just keep me standing I want to
[31:10] be faithful I want to be about the
[31:11] father's business I want to hear Jesus
[31:13] Christ say Well done thou good and
[31:15] faithful servant
[31:21] we're at the end of part two and we're
[31:23] gonna have a third part with sister
[31:25] Naomi and hope you'll be blessed by this
[31:28] podcast that we did today yeah we can
[31:30] thank you for your time and thank you
[31:31] for downloading this podcast I hope all
[31:33] these testimonies that we're hearing now
[31:35] from brother amens to mind to Austin and
[31:37] now our sister Naomi hope they're a
[31:39] great blessing to you and in part three
[31:41] Lord willing we'll look at how God has
[31:43] used sister Naomi and her family here in
[31:45] our local church since she's been here
[31:47] around the end of 2013 or maybe the
[31:49] beginning of 2014 and God has just
[31:52] blessed us tremendously in our
[31:53] fellowship around the revealed word of
[31:55] God we're so thankful for that I hope
[31:57] you'll stay tuned for part three of that
[31:59] episode as well because you can see how
[32:01] God set aside our sister's life from a
[32:03] young age and protected her and guided
[32:05] her through some very difficult college
[32:07] Years and school years and then God sent
[32:10] her over here to our church you know to
[32:11] use the numerous gifts in her life
[32:13] to be a great blessing to us and so that
[32:16] would encourage all of us no matter our
[32:18] age to live a consecrated dedicated life
[32:21] to Jesus Christ so that God can use our
[32:22] gifts to be a blessing to other people
[32:24] if you have any questions for us about
[32:26] the podcast anything we can help you
[32:27] with please let us know God bless you
