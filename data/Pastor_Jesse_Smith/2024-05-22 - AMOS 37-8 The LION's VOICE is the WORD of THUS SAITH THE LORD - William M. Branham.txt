TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and this line of the tribe of Judah prevailed he said don't weep John for the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed he's already overcome he's done it it's over John hallelujah praise the Lord he produced the beach amen [Applause] Glory that s sent on back to the greasy hands that the with his wisdom that defiled him the human being yes but when John turned to look he saw a lamb what a different from a line he said the line has prevailed see again I could use that there God hiding in Simplicity he said is a line that's a king of the Beast the lon has prevailed the strongest thing there is is a line God I've laid out in the jungles in Africa and hear the uh the giraffe squealing and the Great Mighty elephant with his trunk in the air we we we and you're the the the Savages of the desert screaming out their bloody curle cries and the The Beatles to and Billy Paul and I laying a little place covered over with stickers and hear way off in a distance a line Roar and every thing on the desert shuts up even The Beetles stop har the king [Music] speaks I tell you that's when denominations and doubts fall to the ground everything the king spe and this is the king that's his word hallelujah oh I believe it was Amos as I referred to him a while ago that he said he was not a prophet he the son of a prophet but said that when the lion roars who can be fear and if anyone ever heard a real lion roar in the wilderness these you hear in the cages around here are just meowing but when one Roar s in the wilderness everything takes heed I've laid in the jungle of hunam and he's the king of the Beast and when that line Roars even the Beatles stop hollering everything the the jackals and the and the hyas of screaming and the other animals the squawking of the baboons and monkeys and The Beetles you can hardly hear yourself think but in a distant let lion roar and every Beetle stop all see everything's afraid of him yet there's many things can kill him but he's recognized as a king amongst the Beast he said when the lion roars who can but fear he said then God has spoken who can but prophesy that's I think the condition meets that challenge again today God has spoken see and we see the handwriting on the wall so it's very easy to prophesy and see that we're at the end time and we're seeing God from every section of denominations all the way from Catholic ISM through all the Protestant churches Buddhist and what more from India and whatever more he's calling his people together assembling them together and um I'm very happy for that to see this day coming is right here among you you will just remember thus saith the Lord you will never in any over more Gentile Church age ever see any sign to succeed this go greater this is the last sign to the church it's predicted that they're going to do it and they're going to do it for it's thus sayth the lord they're going to do it you think them nominations will ever break up their denomination come back to the word it's thus sayith the Lord they won't will they go into the Antichrist exactly it's thus sayth the Lord they will what are you saying about I have to be a witness in told to you all believers you wonder why I rap it women the way I do 30 years ago I've got thus sayeth the Lord 30 years ago when I entered the ministry he told me that the strain of women would come so immoral and imputed in the last days it' be the most defiled thing on the Earth right she started at the beginning and Satan us her at the end and look what is happening look down through the ears said she'll continue to strip herself and said there'll just be a little tiny group of the very elected it's predestinated will escape that Vision notice just closing I want to say this one thing just before closing that's what led me to say this it's thus sayth the Lord a man would say that without putting it in his own thinking he'd be a hyp critt should go to hell for some of the dirtiest looking things I ever seen in my life and when the American Church come up it was the awfulest I ever seen the heavenly father is my judge they had on these tattletail gray skirts like one of these barroom girls with no back oned up here holding up like a gray looking piece of paper and like hoola dancing paint short bobbed hair smoking cigarettes and twisting as it walk to rock and roll and I said is that the Church of the United States and the voice said yes it is and thus sayith the Lord amen hallelujah hallelujah the baptism using the title of father son Holy Ghost is false th sayth the Lord amen amen amen I command every one of you on here on tape that hasn't been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ be baptized again in the name of Jesus Christ amen Paul in Acts 59 or 195 said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and said we know not where it be any Holy Ghost said what was you baptized amen they said we've been baptized but not in Christian baptism Father Son and Holy Ghost is not Christian baptism amen no Christian was ever baptized like that in the Bible or for hundreds of years after the Bible it's a Catholic Creed and not a Christian doctrine show me in the Bible amen it's a it's a fraud it's a working of devils amen I don't mean to say the people it's baptized like at her that way God's got a many person out there today that don't know no better but but the hour has come amen we've got to get back to the word if we expect God to work in this day like he then
