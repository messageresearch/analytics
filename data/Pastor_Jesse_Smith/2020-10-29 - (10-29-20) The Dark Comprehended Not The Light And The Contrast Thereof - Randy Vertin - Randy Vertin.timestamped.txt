[39:00] to the book of john
[39:02] chapter one
[39:11] we'll just read the first
[39:12] five verses there and
[39:17] just bring greetings there from texas
[39:19] and my wife lindsay and she wishes she
[39:21] could be here you know but
[39:23] uh she's taking care of the pups there
[39:25] at home
[39:26] and uh
[39:27] but but don't feel bad texas is honestly
[39:30] right now basically just as cold and
[39:32] it's been just as wet as it is up here
[39:33] so
[39:34] we're uh we're not only one in the
[39:36] spirit but we're even one in the in the
[39:37] weather right now so
[39:39] uh but you know what the the fire of the
[39:42] gospel keeps us
[39:43] going on the inside man
[39:45] and uh we'll just uh read here the first
[39:48] five verses of the book of john chapter
[39:50] one
[39:51] it says in the beginning was the word
[39:53] and the word was with god and the word
[39:56] was god
[39:57] the same was in the beginning with god
[39:59] all things were made by him
[40:01] and without him was not anything made
[40:03] that was made
[40:05] in him was life and the life was the
[40:07] light of men
[40:08] and the light shineth in darkness and
[40:11] the darkness comprehended it not
[40:14] amen and uh
[40:17] let's just turn over to the book of
[40:19] genesis as well chapter one
[40:31] and i'll read verse
[40:36] three through five actually we just
[40:37] started first one we'll just read one
[40:39] verse one through five as well here
[40:42] in the beginning god created the heaven
[40:43] and the earth
[40:44] and the earth was without form and void
[40:46] and darkness was upon the face of the
[40:48] deep
[40:50] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[40:52] face of the waters
[40:54] and god said let there be light and
[40:56] there was light
[40:58] and god saw the light that it was good
[41:00] and god divided the light from the
[41:02] darkness and god called the night
[41:04] the light day and the darkness he called
[41:07] night
[41:07] and the evening and the morning were the
[41:10] first day
[41:11] amen this is far our head's a little
[41:12] prayer heavenly father lord jesus so
[41:14] jesus come
[41:16] lord that this evening lord to hear from
[41:18] you oh god just to gather together lord
[41:21] in one accord to to read from your word
[41:24] lord and to have something lord that
[41:26] would maybe be said that would draw your
[41:28] people closer to you lord jesus that
[41:30] would be a benefit to your bride this
[41:31] evening but we just pray that you would
[41:33] have preeminence in the service oh god
[41:35] may
[41:36] lord you just have your perfect will and
[41:38] way amongst your people lord may just
[41:40] let me get out of the way
[41:41] lord all the ones that would have a
[41:43] desire to be here lord we know there are
[41:45] many that would desire to be here lord
[41:47] but the devils put up different
[41:49] roadblocks and obstacles but god we know
[41:51] that the word of god is is sharper than
[41:54] the two-edged sword lord and
[41:56] lord we just go forward knowing oh god
[41:58] that
[41:59] wherever two or three gathered you're
[42:00] there in the midst and lord even as i
[42:03] believe our brother paul said in the
[42:05] scriptures though he was absent in the
[42:06] flesh he was present in the spirit and
[42:09] we lo no lord god by the oneness of the
[42:12] holy ghost that you put in your bridal
[42:14] god that
[42:15] that your presence is here with us lord
[42:17] and it's with all the saints that would
[42:19] desire to be here lord and you can
[42:20] minister to them just as powerfully
[42:22] right now
[42:23] and lord we just
[42:24] ask that you're perfect this evening
[42:26] lord may you just have something said
[42:28] that would be
[42:29] pleasing to you lord god and that would
[42:31] be a benefit to your people we just ask
[42:33] these things in the name of the lord
[42:34] jesus christ we pray amen and i need to
[42:37] be seated
[42:40] just maybe you want to preach a simple
[42:42] little sermon this evening probably
[42:44] won't keep you long
[42:46] um
[42:48] and uh
[42:49] you know we definitely know i believe by
[42:51] the by the signs of the times and the
[42:52] things that we see that we're living in
[42:54] the last days
[42:55] you know it's so tempting
[42:57] i was just talking with the brother
[42:59] before a little bit earlier today and
[43:02] and um
[43:04] it's so tempting because the the nature
[43:05] of man is always trying to figure things
[43:07] out you know and and with all the things
[43:09] going on there's no doubt that even the
[43:12] denomination and
[43:13] and all the the ones out there that that
[43:16] believe on the lord jesus they can
[43:18] there's a feeling
[43:19] that that a believer gets you know even
[43:22] to know that that the time is is nigh
[43:26] it's even at the door
[43:27] and there's there's an i believe an
[43:29] urgency
[43:30] in the air really
[43:32] in in the in the spirit of the people
[43:34] that we just know that the lord is soon
[43:36] to come amen even if we can't
[43:38] necessarily put our finger on it or
[43:41] as much as you know trying to to
[43:43] figure out the exact times and
[43:45] everything and i was talking with the
[43:46] brother and saying how with all the
[43:47] things going on with the election and
[43:49] things there's all these different ones
[43:50] out there oh this is definitely gonna
[43:51] happen and this is definitely going to
[43:53] happen and it's it's so easy to get
[43:55] caught into that because
[43:57] the spirit of the age is crying out for
[43:59] the lord you know we the there's their
[44:02] their people are are in gross darkness
[44:05] and they know that something's wrong but
[44:07] that so many don't know where to turn
[44:09] and and you know it really is it seems
[44:12] like a really
[44:14] an embodiment of the scripture where it
[44:15] says the blind would lead the blind and
[44:17] they'd both fall into the ditch and
[44:19] everyone's trying to find something
[44:21] because we know we had a word come in
[44:23] our day that showed us the truth of the
[44:25] gospel and the and the fact that the
[44:27] word of god is true amen that it's not
[44:29] just something that we had to guess at
[44:31] and and wonder about but the word of god
[44:33] is yea and amen and his promises are
[44:36] true and we don't have to question the
[44:38] word of god we just have to believe it
[44:39] amen you know but and we know in this
[44:42] hour that we're living in that the devil
[44:45] is coming with such a deception amongst
[44:47] the people always throwing distractions
[44:49] and different things
[44:50] but we want to speak about in this hour
[44:53] is if we just give a title to the sermon
[44:56] of contrasting attributes
[44:58] you know because
[44:59] god
[45:00] works by a law of contrast
[45:03] and we see that right even here in the
[45:04] beginning of the book of genesis you
[45:06] know the the spirit of the age
[45:08] is is that spirit of filial love
[45:13] it's a real strong spirit of what they
[45:15] of fleshly
[45:16] what the the devil tries to define his
[45:19] love
[45:19] one of the biggest things that the the
[45:21] devil's trying to do in this day is he
[45:23] redefines things all the time the things
[45:25] that used to be one way they just aren't
[45:27] the they aren't that way anymore you
[45:29] know i and and forgive me if it sounds
[45:31] really crude to say it this way but it
[45:33] used to be that the word gay
[45:36] meant a happiness or a joy you know it
[45:39] would be it would be oh well i feel i
[45:41] feel this way and and now we've
[45:43] redefined it to go in this other
[45:44] direction and and so many things that
[45:46] you could find of even the very
[45:48] definition of things is is trying is
[45:51] trying to take itself and the devil has
[45:54] tried to use intellect and intellectual
[45:57] uh
[45:58] reasonings and things to try to bring
[46:00] the people to a place where they've
[46:02] completely reasoned god
[46:04] out of their lives you know the
[46:06] scripture says that it would come to a
[46:07] place that they would not even like to
[46:09] retain god in their knowledge
[46:11] they've completely
[46:13] lost any any any semblance of of
[46:17] reverential fear for god
[46:20] let alone knowing what we know if if
[46:22] it's not just it's not just god is in
[46:25] just some great spirit that the the the
[46:27] world would try to find oh some great
[46:29] power like the the hindus would worship
[46:31] or or or
[46:33] some some a native american would just
[46:35] worship some great spirit but we know
[46:38] that god gave himself a name and that
[46:39] was the name lord jesus christ so we we
[46:42] understand that
[46:44] but meanwhile the devil is coming with
[46:46] intellectualism and and blinded the
[46:48] people so much with science and
[46:50] reasonings and all the things that we
[46:52] see in the world and granted there are
[46:54] many wonderful things i'm grateful for
[46:55] the fact that just earlier today i could
[46:58] be all the way in texas and just a few
[47:00] hours later here i find myself back in
[47:02] ohio you know
[47:03] and we're grateful for those things but
[47:05] we understand it's a it's a tree of
[47:06] knowledge of good and evil and we need
[47:09] to be so careful even though you know we
[47:11] have to partake of so many of the things
[47:13] just to survive you know we drive our
[47:15] cars and those things are wonderful we
[47:17] have our computers and we're grateful
[47:18] for those things but but the devil has
[47:20] twisted those things to to be a uh uh to
[47:24] not be a benefit for the people of god
[47:26] in so many ways we we see how how the
[47:29] computers and the cell phones and all
[47:32] the televisions and all these things
[47:34] that maybe in some aspect could be used
[47:36] for such a great
[47:38] a great ministry for the things of god
[47:40] the devil always just twists it down
[47:42] into the pits of hell
[47:44] but we understand that it has to be that
[47:46] way because there has to be god works by
[47:49] a law of contrast
[47:50] and we understand even right in the
[47:52] beginning in the book of genesis you
[47:53] know the world is operating in this this
[47:56] false idea of love of oh love just it
[47:59] brings everybody together no matter what
[48:01] and it doesn't matter what you believe
[48:04] and it doesn't matter you know whether
[48:06] or not we can you know
[48:08] whether or not we agree on anything you
[48:10] know we just need to all get along and
[48:12] and just tolerate one another and just
[48:14] let everybody do what they want to do
[48:16] and really as the scripture says they
[48:18] have the attitude of eat drink and be
[48:20] merry for tomorrow we die
[48:22] they just well let's just do whatever we
[48:24] want whatever would feel good whatever
[48:26] makes you feel better whatever whatever
[48:29] just makes you feel like well this is
[48:31] just the way it's going to be so let's
[48:32] just you know i can get along with
[48:34] everybody it's not hurting me it doesn't
[48:35] really matter it doesn't mean it's wrong
[48:37] but
[48:38] but
[48:39] that is just an absolute perversion of
[48:43] real love because real agape godly love
[48:47] can only recognize the word of god
[48:50] real love in the heart of a believer can
[48:54] only recognize the word of god to be
[48:57] true and anything against that
[49:00] oh sure you know we're not going out and
[49:03] always pointing fingers in people's
[49:04] faces per se but just you don't realize
[49:07] that even your very life that you live
[49:10] the spirit that dwells within the
[49:12] believer is a rebuke to the world
[49:16] it's an absolute rebuke to the world so
[49:19] there's no wonder why the world would
[49:21] hate the believer even without a cause
[49:24] there's nothing that may have even been
[49:26] done but
[49:27] just like our lord jesus said he said if
[49:29] the world hated you it hated me first
[49:33] and the only reason the world can really
[49:34] hate you
[49:35] isn't because of you it's because of
[49:38] jesus christ who the world hated he
[49:40] dwells in you
[49:43] and so it's no wonder you know
[49:45] and it's it's something that has gotten
[49:47] into the youth of the day within the
[49:49] within the ranks of the believers
[49:50] because there's such a desire and such a
[49:54] spirit of wanting to belong to the
[49:57] people everybody wants to belong
[50:00] everybody wants to be loved and and
[50:02] appreciated by everybody but but we
[50:04] understand that if you're going to walk
[50:06] the road of a real christian
[50:09] it's going to be a harder road it's
[50:12] gonna be a road that's not filled with
[50:14] all the praise and adoration that the
[50:16] world tries to heap on their so-called
[50:18] celebrities and their so-called their
[50:20] idols that they've that they freely call
[50:23] them
[50:24] but it's gonna be a harder road where
[50:27] the real comfort because when it comes
[50:28] down to it the only comfort the believer
[50:31] can really have is in jesus christ amen
[50:34] the only comfort the believer can really
[50:36] have is in the holy ghost there is
[50:39] absolutely nothing no matter how good it
[50:42] might seem no matter how good it looks
[50:44] or how good it feels for a season that
[50:47] can comfort or bring you into a real
[50:49] fellowship other than the holy ghost
[50:51] amen
[50:52] other than a real fellowship with god
[50:55] himself through underneath the shed
[50:57] blood in the name of the lord jesus
[50:59] christ
[51:00] but the whole world has gotten into this
[51:02] idea of well you just have to you just
[51:05] have to accept everything you just have
[51:07] to take it because that's love that's
[51:09] what love is but see god in this hour
[51:13] just like he did in the beginning is
[51:15] trying to draw a contrast
[51:18] there is a law of contrast that has to
[51:20] exist and as you can see it seems you
[51:23] know sir i've been serving the lord by
[51:25] the grace of god for going on i'd say
[51:27] maybe 20 years or so since i first gave
[51:30] my heart to the lord and and then you
[51:32] know come to the knowledge of this word
[51:34] and what we have now in this hour uh for
[51:37] about 18 years or so now by god's grace
[51:40] and and it's just something to see
[51:42] because
[51:43] just when we don't think as believers
[51:45] that it can get any worse
[51:47] it just the world continues to find new
[51:50] ways to get worse
[51:52] but there's a purpose behind it because
[51:55] in order to express
[51:58] god's perfection there has to be a
[52:00] backdrop
[52:02] to it there it's just like a painting if
[52:05] you have a painting and you have a
[52:06] canvas you say this this monitor here is
[52:09] a canvas if i was gonna paint on it and
[52:12] i wanted to paint a bright background
[52:14] and a sunny sunny nice day well then i
[52:17] would have to start out with something
[52:20] along those lines you have to have a
[52:21] contrast to it if you want to have a
[52:23] light you there has to be darkness
[52:26] otherwise light can't be perfectly
[52:28] expressed
[52:30] we even find that in the book of genesis
[52:32] because god said let there be light and
[52:35] there was light
[52:37] and meanwhile the world is saying just
[52:39] as we know the scripture declares that
[52:41] there's a binding of the tares and a
[52:43] binding of the wheat going on there is a
[52:45] binding going on and there's a natural
[52:48] binding that they're trying to do a
[52:49] forced union where let's just accept
[52:51] everything
[52:52] let's just accept it we can break down
[52:54] the walls of whether or not we believe
[52:57] that god is one god we can break down
[53:00] the walls of whether we believe or not
[53:03] in the true baptism in the name of the
[53:04] lord jesus christ or we can break down
[53:07] the walls of holiness and living right
[53:09] before god in actually taking the word
[53:12] for what it says instead of what we want
[53:15] it to say
[53:18] but the world wants to break down all
[53:19] those barriers
[53:22] think oh well if god god is love god is
[53:24] love god is love but he's not the kind
[53:27] of love that the world is pushing upon
[53:30] the people
[53:32] he's not just a pushover grandfather
[53:34] that will just accept any old thing just
[53:37] for the sake of let's get along
[53:40] you know the scripture says that we need
[53:43] as much we live peaceably with all men
[53:44] as much lies within you
[53:47] and it's not that we're going out there
[53:49] just trying to pick fights believe you
[53:51] me if
[53:52] this hour the fight is coming to the
[53:55] believer you won't need to pick any
[53:57] fights brothers and sisters because the
[53:59] fight is coming to the believer why
[54:02] because your very life is an expression
[54:05] of everything contrary to what the devil
[54:09] is doing in the world right now
[54:12] you don't realize it but just by being
[54:14] here in this place or if you're
[54:16] listening on on on the
[54:18] internet or whatever listening because
[54:20] you're not able to be here or whatever
[54:21] it might be just you trying to enter
[54:25] into the channel of the word and receive
[54:28] something from god in this hour is
[54:31] setting you
[54:32] you are actively taking sides
[54:36] right now whether you know it or not
[54:38] just by the attitude you take towards
[54:39] the word of god you're choosing a side
[54:42] right now
[54:43] of where you're gonna stand are you
[54:44] gonna stand with the world that just
[54:46] says let's just do whatever it does well
[54:48] god is love god god accepts everybody
[54:50] god does this god does he does accept
[54:53] everybody on his conditions
[54:56] he accepts everyone on his conditions
[54:59] what are the conditions it's the word of
[55:01] god repent and be baptized in the name
[55:04] of jesus christ
[55:06] for the remission of sins and you shall
[55:08] receive the gift of the holy ghost for
[55:09] god so loved the world he gave his only
[55:11] begotten son that whosoever believeth on
[55:14] him shall not perish but everlasting
[55:15] life what is that but what proves he
[55:18] said if you love me
[55:19] there's that word again see the the
[55:21] world loves to throw that word around
[55:23] love love love oh we gotta you gotta
[55:25] have love how could jesus jesus wouldn't
[55:27] have done this jesus wouldn't say
[55:29] homosexuality is wrong jesus wouldn't
[55:32] condemn all the insanity going on now
[55:35] well he may not be out there marching in
[55:37] a political realm because i the the
[55:39] political realm is the devil's realm to
[55:41] do with what he wants but
[55:42] that's that's his thing to do now the
[55:44] lord is ultimately in control you know
[55:47] we're in that season now i'm sure
[55:48] everybody's thinking about it it's on
[55:49] everybody's mind with the election and
[55:51] all these different things going on
[55:53] we understand that that realm is satan's
[55:56] realm god let him have it
[55:58] he said he gave it to him for the season
[56:00] that he gets it but in the end it
[56:02] doesn't matter anyway because the
[56:03] scripture already gave us a backstop
[56:05] that god sets up kings and he takes them
[56:07] down so no matter what the devil's
[56:09] devices are it's all in the control of
[56:12] our lord jesus christ it's all under the
[56:15] control of god it doesn't matter what it
[56:17] looks like on the outside oh well we you
[56:19] know we can do what we have to do
[56:21] whether it be you know trying to live
[56:23] our lives the right way and all these
[56:25] things and
[56:26] you know maybe not partaking in those
[56:28] things you know everybody want the oh
[56:30] you got to get on this cause you got to
[56:32] get on this cause and this and that this
[56:33] and that the only cause i want to be a
[56:35] part of is the cause of the world amen
[56:42] praise the lord but we understand
[56:45] that there has got to be a contrast in
[56:48] this hour
[56:50] and and the people of god the bride of
[56:52] jesus christ has been called to be a
[56:55] contrasting element to the darkness of
[56:58] this world
[57:00] even now the word the scripture says
[57:03] that it would be a time that wouldn't be
[57:05] called day or night but in the evening
[57:07] time it shall be light
[57:09] you are right now that light in the
[57:12] evening time
[57:14] it is such a deceptive
[57:16] time
[57:17] it's that that gloomy
[57:19] that that they say the most deceptive
[57:21] time of the day is what they call
[57:23] twilight it's that evening time it's
[57:26] right before the sun goes down and and
[57:28] dusk and and twilight and all those
[57:30] things and then right before the sun
[57:31] comes up why because everything looks
[57:33] like it's kind of blending together the
[57:35] shadows get real long the darkness is
[57:38] pressing itself together it doesn't
[57:39] matter how much the darkness presses
[57:41] itself together brothers and sisters it
[57:42] can't stop the light it can't stop what
[57:45] god has placed inside of you it cannot
[57:48] do it but the question is
[57:51] it's it's whether or not we're gonna let
[57:53] that light shine
[57:55] even that just being here now
[57:57] just
[57:58] siding yourself with this word in your
[58:00] heart lord i believe your word i take
[58:04] every word of it to be true and i'm
[58:06] going to do everything in my power by
[58:08] your grace to live according to this
[58:10] word amen
[58:11] sets you apart
[58:13] from everybody else in the world
[58:16] that just says well that was just no i
[58:18] believe you know that if we believe on
[58:20] the lord jesus we'll be saved but i
[58:21] don't know i don't know about that
[58:22] holiness stuff
[58:24] you know i don't know i don't know about
[58:26] the holy ghost
[58:28] i don't know about why because there's
[58:30] so there's got to be a contrast brothers
[58:32] and sisters there is
[58:34] darkness upon the land and gross
[58:36] darkness on the people people you can
[58:39] see it in the way they act you can see
[58:41] it in the way they live their lives that
[58:42] they are groping looking for something
[58:45] that's why everybody gets attached to
[58:47] these causes everybody wants to jump on
[58:50] the bandwagon why because they're
[58:52] they're wanting something to believe in
[58:55] they are desiring to believe in
[58:58] something because a man
[59:00] and i say this bro man or woman you know
[59:03] brother or sister a man or woman without
[59:06] a purpose
[59:08] a man without a vision to see where
[59:10] they're going they have no drive don't
[59:13] become lackadaisical they don't they're
[59:15] confused why because there's got to be
[59:18] something that you're pushing towards
[59:21] there's got to be something that you're
[59:22] driving towards there's got to be
[59:24] movement somewhere i remember a long
[59:27] time ago i heard this and it's been a
[59:29] long time so maybe they've changed it i
[59:31] don't know science seems to change every
[59:32] two seconds for all i know but but i
[59:35] remember hearing this because you know
[59:37] scientists are always trying to figure
[59:38] things out right that's just what they
[59:39] do
[59:41] and they want to figure out what is life
[59:44] you know they can see it you know as far
[59:46] as the flesh goes like you're alive
[59:48] brother amen and and brother bang i'm
[59:50] alive right now and you know we're here
[59:52] and we'll do it we're doing that they
[59:54] can look at a dog and they can look at a
[59:56] a little plant and they can look at the
[59:58] cells and they say there's they can even
[1:00:00] look at the little bacteria and they'd
[1:00:01] say this thing it's alive
[1:00:04] there's a life to it
[1:00:06] and they define it different ways you
[1:00:08] know they'd say i think they say like
[1:00:09] viruses aren't technically alive because
[1:00:11] of this or that
[1:00:12] but but there's but there but we
[1:00:14] understand by the word in this hour by
[1:00:16] the message that there is a life behind
[1:00:18] that virus
[1:00:20] there's a life there so but but the one
[1:00:22] thing they said i remember hearing this
[1:00:24] or reading this a long time ago they
[1:00:25] said the one thing that that they find
[1:00:28] in common about all life no matter what
[1:00:30] it looks like it's movement
[1:00:33] it's it is a movement it is action and
[1:00:36] something going on he said brother well
[1:00:38] that doesn't make any sense i could go
[1:00:39] down in the bottom of the ocean and find
[1:00:41] a sea sponge and he doesn't move at all
[1:00:43] but if you were to take a piece of that
[1:00:45] sea sponge and zoom in all the way out
[1:00:47] into the cells you'd see all those
[1:00:48] little cells moving all the time you'd
[1:00:51] see all those little pieces of the the
[1:00:53] mitochondria and the little different
[1:00:55] things going on the cells in the uh i
[1:00:57] don't know if sea sponge has blood but
[1:00:59] whatever the equivalent of blood is for
[1:01:01] a sea sponge is moving around moving the
[1:01:03] nutrients here and there and filtering
[1:01:06] out the things from the ocean moving it
[1:01:07] here and there you know if brother
[1:01:09] brother amen sleeping in the bed and he
[1:01:11] maybe he's a i don't know what kind of
[1:01:13] asleep you are brother but maybe you're
[1:01:14] maybe you're a really good sleeper like
[1:01:16] brother simon
[1:01:17] who could just sleep like nobody's
[1:01:20] business where you almost think man bro
[1:01:22] is he even still alive maybe they're
[1:01:24] sleeping so good you don't know you got
[1:01:26] to put the mirror up to see if they're
[1:01:27] still breathing but even then
[1:01:30] take someone in a coma and they say oh
[1:01:32] they're brain dead or something
[1:01:34] you know but then they could go to the
[1:01:36] cellular level they can look and they
[1:01:38] see while they're still breathing
[1:01:40] their the cells are still moving there
[1:01:42] is life
[1:01:43] somewhere and so it was
[1:01:45] i remember hearing that it really struck
[1:01:47] me movement
[1:01:48] and then it started me thinking and i
[1:01:50] thought well that's the problem
[1:01:52] with people that become stagnant
[1:01:55] is when you stop moving when you stop
[1:01:58] pressing forward when you stop when you
[1:02:01] lose and i remember i preached this when
[1:02:03] i was here last time so forgive me if
[1:02:04] i'm kind of overlapping some things and
[1:02:06] i would admit to start on on stepping
[1:02:08] into the vision i believe it was and
[1:02:11] but it kind of goes along this line that
[1:02:13] if you lose the vision if you lose the
[1:02:15] purpose if you lose what the lord is
[1:02:18] trying to move you towards if you lose
[1:02:21] that you become stagnant you become
[1:02:24] you become you just become it just
[1:02:26] becomes filthy and the problem is is
[1:02:29] that once you once a body of water or
[1:02:31] once a being once something becomes
[1:02:33] stagnant what happens rap starts to set
[1:02:36] in
[1:02:36] parasites start to set in
[1:02:38] these problems start to happen i mean
[1:02:41] branham calls them all the wiggle tails
[1:02:42] and all the little the tadpoles and
[1:02:44] things that come along with it they
[1:02:46] start to set in why because there's no
[1:02:48] movement there's no direction there's no
[1:02:50] purpose
[1:02:52] as a believer we ought to have a purpose
[1:02:54] to our lives there needs to be that
[1:02:57] vision that god's given and there is a
[1:02:59] vision in this age it's to be a contrast
[1:03:02] with what the rest of the world is
[1:03:04] showing right now
[1:03:06] and you don't see the devil likes to try
[1:03:08] to beat the believer down because oh we
[1:03:10] live humble lives
[1:03:12] you know we have a small little church
[1:03:14] here you know there's a small little
[1:03:16] church here there's small little
[1:03:17] churches everywhere you know maybe just
[1:03:19] a few here and maybe some are a little
[1:03:20] bit bigger some a little bit smaller and
[1:03:22] the devil oh you're just insignificant
[1:03:24] you're this and you're that it has
[1:03:25] nothing to do with you brothers it's not
[1:03:27] about the flesh it's not about according
[1:03:29] to the natural yeah
[1:03:31] it's just like the one time
[1:03:33] when when gideon had all these soldiers
[1:03:36] and god said there's too many we got to
[1:03:37] whittle him down so we whittled him down
[1:03:39] and then he said the lord said no that's
[1:03:41] still too many we got to whittle him
[1:03:42] down and he winded him down and he said
[1:03:44] look the reason i'm doing this is to
[1:03:47] show you that it's not about numbers
[1:03:50] it's not about like what the what the
[1:03:52] the carnal mind can see it's about
[1:03:56] whether or not god is in the camp
[1:03:59] because i tell you what brothers and
[1:04:00] sisters as long as god is in the camp
[1:04:04] you might as well count that one as one
[1:04:07] billion because it doesn't matter
[1:04:09] because there be more for us than they
[1:04:11] could even see there'd be more for us
[1:04:13] than against us
[1:04:15] even now encompassed by a great crowd of
[1:04:17] witnesses yeah we may not have prophetic
[1:04:20] eyes to see into the spiritual realm but
[1:04:24] i know that the word says wherever two
[1:04:26] or three are gathered he'd be there in
[1:04:28] the midst
[1:04:30] that the angels of the lord encamp about
[1:04:32] them that fear him i like that in
[1:04:35] camping why they're pitching their tent
[1:04:37] around you there's a there's a holy
[1:04:39] perimeter
[1:04:41] that's a military thing that putting a
[1:04:43] perimeter around your brothers and
[1:04:45] sisters
[1:04:46] god's done it in this age and the devil
[1:04:48] tries to make you feel small and
[1:04:50] insignificant and you don't realize that
[1:04:53] you are the greatest light that the
[1:04:56] world is ever going to see right now
[1:04:59] and that's not here to just pump you up
[1:05:01] according to the flesh that's not the
[1:05:03] point because i think we've gotten too
[1:05:05] much of that but but we have to
[1:05:07] understand who we are and realize that
[1:05:10] there is something in you that you have
[1:05:12] to offer
[1:05:14] there is something in you as a believer
[1:05:17] as a holy ghost-filled christian who
[1:05:19] believes the revealed word of god for
[1:05:21] the hour that there is a life in you
[1:05:25] that there is a truth that that is in
[1:05:27] you
[1:05:29] that you have to offer
[1:05:31] that the world can't stand
[1:05:34] but every once in a while brothers and
[1:05:36] sisters you're going to come across one
[1:05:38] that's who they're going to see it
[1:05:40] oh it's a glorious thing it's becoming
[1:05:42] more few and far between it seems all
[1:05:44] the time
[1:05:45] but it's a glorious moment why because
[1:05:47] it proves that there's something
[1:05:50] deep down inside that that you can't see
[1:05:53] it with your natural eyes
[1:05:56] someone would have looked at me
[1:05:58] you know 20 years ago even probably 10
[1:06:00] years ago even when i was going through
[1:06:02] a lot of trials i thought there was
[1:06:03] nothing to it doesn't really matter
[1:06:05] that's okay there was something on the
[1:06:07] inside that that man can't see
[1:06:12] and there's something in you that you
[1:06:14] have to offer
[1:06:16] god has made us a contrasting element in
[1:06:19] this age
[1:06:20] the world is
[1:06:22] just groped and they're just covered in
[1:06:24] darkness
[1:06:26] and and
[1:06:27] granted there are many out there that
[1:06:29] are that are christians
[1:06:31] that believe as much as as they've had
[1:06:33] revealed to them and as much as they can
[1:06:34] see
[1:06:36] but but
[1:06:37] brothers and sisters there's there's not
[1:06:39] much
[1:06:40] that that
[1:06:41] you know how rare it is in it again this
[1:06:43] is not to puff up according to the flesh
[1:06:46] i've talked about it here i've talked
[1:06:47] about it a lot of places i don't like
[1:06:49] the bride pride
[1:06:51] thing we're all we're just the pride of
[1:06:52] jesus christ we're this we're that no
[1:06:54] we're only anything because god had
[1:06:56] mercy upon us
[1:06:58] we're only anything because his grace
[1:07:00] and his mercy if it was up to me if it
[1:07:03] was up to my own i would have put myself
[1:07:05] out a long time ago
[1:07:08] but by the grace of god like paul said
[1:07:10] by the grace of god i am what i am
[1:07:13] i can't help but be what i am amen and
[1:07:15] thank the lord that he made me made us
[1:07:17] that way but i i want to say that
[1:07:21] if we would realize
[1:07:23] how rare
[1:07:25] it is
[1:07:26] to to say
[1:07:29] that you believe every word of this
[1:07:31] bible
[1:07:32] and actually mean it
[1:07:35] because there are so many
[1:07:38] you that would claim to believe the
[1:07:40] scripture but they'll come to a place
[1:07:42] where i just can't take that
[1:07:45] well i just don't think i can go that
[1:07:46] far
[1:07:48] how rare it is
[1:07:50] to that the lord has opened our eyes to
[1:07:53] see the truth of the scripture to know
[1:07:56] that when god says something he says
[1:07:58] what he means he means what he says his
[1:08:01] promises are true
[1:08:03] his word is yea and amen
[1:08:05] amen and we've had it revealed to us
[1:08:09] i mean
[1:08:10] it's such a humbling thing it ought to
[1:08:11] humble us just down below the floor
[1:08:15] because who are we to receive that
[1:08:18] but there's but there is there is a
[1:08:20] contrast to be had in this age because
[1:08:23] see the lord
[1:08:25] he puts the back it's just like an
[1:08:27] artist
[1:08:28] like we were talking about the painting
[1:08:29] or something along that line
[1:08:32] an artist when he's getting the
[1:08:34] situation ready to to show to show
[1:08:36] something that there needs to be a
[1:08:38] background
[1:08:40] to the to the art piece there needs to
[1:08:43] be a background to the painting there
[1:08:45] needs to be a background to the
[1:08:46] photograph or or the picture or whatever
[1:08:48] it might be to the sculpture whatever
[1:08:50] they're doing
[1:08:51] and what if if they do it properly there
[1:08:54] needs to be a contrast between the two
[1:08:56] because if you have you know those one
[1:08:58] of those white marble sculptures
[1:09:00] and you place it in front of a white
[1:09:02] marble wall
[1:09:03] then they're just going to get lost it
[1:09:05] won't be able to really you'll never
[1:09:07] really see
[1:09:09] what's laying there
[1:09:10] but if you take that and put it out of
[1:09:12] contrast all of a sudden it becomes
[1:09:15] revealed what was there and you can
[1:09:17] start to see the form of it you start to
[1:09:19] understand the purpose of it and that's
[1:09:21] what it is for the believers in this day
[1:09:24] kind of going back i know we kind of
[1:09:26] went off on attention we just kind of i
[1:09:28] forget you'll forgive me i know i i do
[1:09:30] that a lot i just try to go where the
[1:09:32] lord leads and
[1:09:35] but the thought is
[1:09:37] the world and i i we go so much of this
[1:09:40] because we understand that divine love
[1:09:43] is the only thing that's going to be
[1:09:44] there
[1:09:45] is real defined love not the the forgive
[1:09:48] me for saying this way i know it's not
[1:09:50] the garbage
[1:09:52] that the world spews that love is oh
[1:09:54] love is this love is that oh love just
[1:09:57] means you just gotta roll with whatever
[1:09:59] the devil wants you to do basically is
[1:10:01] what they're saying
[1:10:02] but real love
[1:10:04] if real divine love is the only thing
[1:10:07] that's going to be there
[1:10:09] and because the world is saying well
[1:10:10] love love love we gotta we just got to
[1:10:12] let everybody in and do whatever they
[1:10:14] want but from the beginning
[1:10:17] god shows that he's a separator amen
[1:10:20] from the very beginning god shows that
[1:10:22] he's separating light from darkness
[1:10:25] he's separating goats from sheep
[1:10:28] he's separating make believers from
[1:10:30] unbelievers and from real believers
[1:10:33] he's separating them sure we have our
[1:10:35] moments where yeah we understand three
[1:10:37] types of believers and all these
[1:10:38] different things but even now they're
[1:10:40] being separated
[1:10:42] why because
[1:10:43] as we're getting closer and closer to
[1:10:45] the top of that pyramid it's getting
[1:10:46] smaller and smaller and smaller and the
[1:10:49] roads becoming narrower and narrower and
[1:10:52] narrower and the battles become harder
[1:10:54] and people fall away and they just give
[1:10:56] up and say i can't do it anymore
[1:11:00] why because there's got to be a contrast
[1:11:03] there's got to be a contrast and in this
[1:11:05] day
[1:11:07] you could you could think of all the
[1:11:08] qualities
[1:11:10] about the bride
[1:11:11] versus versus the world
[1:11:14] you look at holiness
[1:11:15] the world wants to just do do whatever
[1:11:18] you want to do it doesn't matter going
[1:11:19] that they go into the churches and they
[1:11:21] play rock and roll now
[1:11:22] i mean it's just flat out they want to
[1:11:24] say that they they're believers and they
[1:11:26] play demonic rock and roll music in the
[1:11:27] churches the the
[1:11:29] the the people dress any kind of way the
[1:11:32] the that they're 90 naked
[1:11:35] you know and if they if they do have any
[1:11:37] clothes on it looks like a second skin
[1:11:38] painted on them you know it's absolute
[1:11:41] insanity but it shows that there there's
[1:11:44] a contrast there first holiness
[1:11:47] verse really living according to the
[1:11:49] word of god when it comes to those
[1:11:50] things and dressing in in a holy way
[1:11:54] that's that would be acceptable and meek
[1:11:56] before the lord not going and swatting
[1:11:58] yourself because his flesh is nothing
[1:11:59] anyway
[1:12:01] everybody wants to flaunt their flesh
[1:12:03] but it's nothing but a dead man anyhow
[1:12:05] the flesh is already condemned so much
[1:12:08] so that it's got to be totally changed
[1:12:11] you ain't taking it with you
[1:12:15] if it doesn't go in the ground
[1:12:17] it'll it'll change it before rapture
[1:12:20] and so no matter what you do it ain't
[1:12:22] going with you anyhow but they want to
[1:12:23] show it off however they want they want
[1:12:25] to do that they you know they they
[1:12:27] they'll just let you live any kind of
[1:12:29] way but see god
[1:12:31] isn't just about
[1:12:32] you know just letting these things go
[1:12:35] it's not about
[1:12:36] just
[1:12:37] there's got to be a standard
[1:12:41] and whether you know it or not
[1:12:42] your life is a living standard
[1:12:45] that the world sees and is preaching and
[1:12:47] crying out
[1:12:50] some some may understand it some don't
[1:12:52] many you know the scripture said they
[1:12:53] hate you without a cause they don't even
[1:12:55] know why but there's a spirit
[1:12:58] of the age that would do that they don't
[1:13:00] have they basically accept except they'd
[1:13:03] be underneath the blood and the holy
[1:13:05] ghost they won't even have a choice
[1:13:07] because the scripture said it would be
[1:13:08] so deceptive it would deceive the elect
[1:13:10] if it were possible
[1:13:12] if that be the case
[1:13:14] so we see
[1:13:15] the the the contrast there the holiness
[1:13:18] of the bride of jesus christ verses and
[1:13:21] but then even then
[1:13:23] many people in the world see hypocrisy
[1:13:25] and so even according to natural numbers
[1:13:27] many of them lose people
[1:13:29] and all they want is more members and
[1:13:31] more members so what do they do they
[1:13:33] start lowering standards they start not
[1:13:36] preaching the real gospel at all none of
[1:13:38] the gospel at all and now it just
[1:13:39] becomes this greater and greater thing
[1:13:41] so what happens is as the bride's
[1:13:43] getting smaller and smaller and smaller
[1:13:46] as we're getting closer and closer and
[1:13:48] closer
[1:13:49] the other half just enlarging enlarging
[1:13:51] enlarging
[1:13:53] so we see the contrast of that tiny
[1:13:55] little group
[1:13:57] that would stick with the word of god
[1:14:00] and then this the whole entire world
[1:14:02] that couldn't care less about the word
[1:14:04] of god and if you try to say anything
[1:14:06] like that you're just a hate monger
[1:14:08] you're just a person you you don't have
[1:14:10] any real love because jesus wouldn't be
[1:14:12] like that
[1:14:13] oh my if jesus were here they would have
[1:14:15] well that we already know what happened
[1:14:17] because we had a prophet preach
[1:14:18] an indictment
[1:14:20] crucifying the lord afresh
[1:14:22] that was only in the spiritual if he was
[1:14:24] hearing the natural now they would have
[1:14:25] done it a long time ago
[1:14:29] so we see there's there's got to be a
[1:14:30] contrast god is a separator
[1:14:34] he is not the lord is not just oh you
[1:14:37] know i think if i remember you know it
[1:14:40] wasn't oh the lord didn't say oh well
[1:14:42] i'll just go down and i'll come in the
[1:14:45] form of jesus christ and die and i just
[1:14:48] hope that someone feels bad for me
[1:14:50] and and maybe they'll just believe on me
[1:14:52] or or something like that no
[1:14:54] the lord didn't leave anything the
[1:14:56] chance
[1:14:57] he knew
[1:14:58] them that are his he knows that they are
[1:15:01] his he came to redeem those that are his
[1:15:05] yes he gave the opportunity to all he
[1:15:07] knew all wouldn't receive it but here
[1:15:09] you are
[1:15:11] trying your best in the devil see the
[1:15:13] devil doesn't like that because you know
[1:15:15] the desire of the believer is to be
[1:15:17] perfect
[1:15:18] our desire is to always walk perfect
[1:15:20] every time and the devil knows that so
[1:15:22] he always uses that against you
[1:15:24] you know he's uh it's always funny i i
[1:15:27] always think about i think about how the
[1:15:29] devil he loves to take both sides of the
[1:15:31] argument
[1:15:32] he's always ready to take both sides
[1:15:34] because he's the accuser of the brethren
[1:15:36] so he takes the one size and says oh you
[1:15:38] can't do it you can't do it you're not a
[1:15:40] real believer you're not a real believer
[1:15:42] y'all you know you know god can't do it
[1:15:44] anyway even if you didn't believe yeah
[1:15:45] you may believe it but it's not gonna
[1:15:47] happen and then as soon as something
[1:15:48] happens he's right there to say oh it
[1:15:50] didn't really happen anyway you didn't
[1:15:52] see it that way oh you know you know you
[1:15:54] just made this mistake anyway he's
[1:15:56] always on both sides of the argument
[1:16:00] and it's amazing because we fall victim
[1:16:02] to it all the time
[1:16:03] because our eyes get we lose our focus
[1:16:06] we lose our vision of where we're going
[1:16:10] you know but god has always been about
[1:16:13] contrast
[1:16:14] and there are attributes there are there
[1:16:16] is a there is a life the life of jesus
[1:16:19] christ the holy ghost
[1:16:22] that is looking to express itself
[1:16:24] in you the believer
[1:16:27] in order to contrast the world that we
[1:16:29] live in
[1:16:31] and if i tell you what brothers and
[1:16:32] sisters it's getting darker and darker
[1:16:35] it's getting harder and harder the
[1:16:37] battles are getting greater and greater
[1:16:40] the the the spiritual pressure is
[1:16:42] building and building and building why
[1:16:44] because there's there
[1:16:47] the more that they press the more that
[1:16:49] that darkness presses itself together
[1:16:51] they're all doing one thing and that's
[1:16:54] even though they don't know it is
[1:16:55] they're trying to hinder the work of god
[1:16:57] they're trying to hinder the rapture
[1:16:59] they're trying to hinder the coming of
[1:17:01] the lord they can't do it
[1:17:02] we know they can't do it but but the
[1:17:04] devil is only here just to try to trip
[1:17:07] you up just to try to make it take a
[1:17:09] little bit longer than than you thought
[1:17:11] you needed to he's here just to try to
[1:17:13] follow things up a little bit and get
[1:17:15] you off course just enough
[1:17:18] so you miss the mark
[1:17:19] remember just just a little bit left or
[1:17:22] right
[1:17:23] before you shoot the gun will put your
[1:17:25] feet off the target down the line
[1:17:28] you know we got to be so careful because
[1:17:31] if there's any
[1:17:34] thing we got to be so careful is is just
[1:17:36] getting if i say lackadaisical
[1:17:39] because
[1:17:40] as we've talked about that life has got
[1:17:44] to be moving
[1:17:45] that that if we're talk we're talking
[1:17:47] out of your belly shuffle rivers of
[1:17:49] living water it's not just a pool
[1:17:51] it's not a stagnant pool but they're
[1:17:53] rivers of living water a river a river
[1:17:56] ain't gonna find that stagnation in a
[1:17:57] river
[1:17:58] because the river's moving that river's
[1:18:00] flowing that river that river's
[1:18:03] always what is a moving river you put a
[1:18:06] little log or a stick on a moving river
[1:18:08] well it's always having a revival it's
[1:18:10] always pushing out the garbage it's
[1:18:12] always pushing out the trash towards
[1:18:14] that ocean it's trying to get rid of it
[1:18:16] and that's what we need in our lives is
[1:18:18] to understand that it's got to be always
[1:18:21] oppressing it's always oppressing paul
[1:18:23] said he said it's not i don't speak as
[1:18:25] though i've already attained the goal i
[1:18:27] don't i don't acted so i've already
[1:18:29] arrived he said but i forget those those
[1:18:31] things that are behind and i press
[1:18:33] forward i press towards the mark of the
[1:18:36] high calling in christ jesus and that
[1:18:38] pressing isn't just well i press
[1:18:42] without have arrived
[1:18:44] now we because now understand me there
[1:18:47] there is
[1:18:48] even a very distinction to be made here
[1:18:50] as well because
[1:18:51] there there there is such a thing as
[1:18:53] resting in the holy ghost
[1:18:55] but when it comes to to our our getting
[1:18:59] closer unto the lord and and pressing
[1:19:01] towards this rapture that it's still a
[1:19:03] continual pressing because until we are
[1:19:06] out of here until the lord calls us away
[1:19:10] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we
[1:19:12] are going to be fighting
[1:19:14] and if we're fighting a battle then we
[1:19:16] got to be pressing
[1:19:19] so and many times the devil see the
[1:19:21] devil gets us because
[1:19:24] we've received the holy ghost
[1:19:28] we know who we are
[1:19:30] we accept the word of god
[1:19:33] we know that his word is true we don't
[1:19:36] question it we're doing everything we
[1:19:37] can and then the devil comes along and
[1:19:39] says well then if
[1:19:41] if what is this rest you speak of when
[1:19:43] every day you get up you're battling
[1:19:48] because it's not a rest
[1:19:51] in the sense that you don't do anything
[1:19:54] see when we think of rest as carnal
[1:19:57] we just think we just lay around
[1:19:59] and we just sit on the sit on the couch
[1:20:01] and eat some popcorn
[1:20:03] or eat an apple or something i guess
[1:20:05] those are two things i like to eat so
[1:20:07] you know you know when we think of rest
[1:20:09] we're thinking of a natural thing but
[1:20:11] when we're talking about resting it's
[1:20:13] that we've
[1:20:15] scripture says we've rested from our own
[1:20:17] works
[1:20:19] it's no longer our own works but we do a
[1:20:21] desire to do the works of god
[1:20:24] we desire to live a christian life
[1:20:26] before god and if you're gonna do that
[1:20:29] you're going to fight
[1:20:31] if you're going to live a life for jesus
[1:20:34] christ you are going to have to press
[1:20:37] every day
[1:20:38] you're going to fight every day because
[1:20:41] you've never even got see it's a paradox
[1:20:44] isn't it
[1:20:45] it's a paradox
[1:20:47] because
[1:20:49] the devil's on one side saying don't
[1:20:51] press don't press you know don't don't
[1:20:53] try to press to the holy ghost don't try
[1:20:55] to press into this don't and then you
[1:20:57] make it
[1:20:59] and then the devil said
[1:21:01] the devil says well well why are you
[1:21:02] fighting now
[1:21:05] and all he's there is he's there
[1:21:06] accusing you accusing you accusing you
[1:21:08] accusing you trying to hold you back
[1:21:10] why because many times we just think oh
[1:21:12] we've arrived
[1:21:14] and we have
[1:21:15] in the sense that
[1:21:17] once the sealed
[1:21:18] once the sealed vessel is there the work
[1:21:21] is finished
[1:21:22] but you see there there's still work to
[1:21:24] be done there's still life to be lived
[1:21:26] there's still a contrast to be made with
[1:21:29] the world
[1:21:31] and if we're going to fight you're going
[1:21:33] to press
[1:21:35] you're going to battle
[1:21:36] it's going to be an everyday affair
[1:21:38] because you didn't even join the fight
[1:21:41] until you receive the holy ghost you
[1:21:43] didn't even join the fight until you
[1:21:45] believed this word
[1:21:46] amen
[1:21:49] no doubt
[1:21:50] there's a lot of the israelites who
[1:21:52] thought when they crossed jordan
[1:21:54] well we got it this is it
[1:21:57] we made it the land flowing with milk
[1:21:59] and honey
[1:22:00] but now it was time to pull the sword
[1:22:02] and go to work
[1:22:04] that was the time to really pull the
[1:22:06] sword and go to work
[1:22:08] and now is the time brothers and sisters
[1:22:11] that it's time to pull that spiritual
[1:22:13] sword and go to work amen we got to pray
[1:22:17] like we've never prayed before
[1:22:20] he said brother it just sounds like
[1:22:22] works that you're it's not about words
[1:22:23] you see we can rest in the sense that i
[1:22:26] don't count
[1:22:27] on my prayer to save me
[1:22:30] the lord already did that
[1:22:33] but because he saved me
[1:22:36] i must fight if i must win
[1:22:39] increase my courage lord
[1:22:43] if if there's and desiring you for this
[1:22:45] rapture that it's time that we showed
[1:22:48] some fight
[1:22:51] that it's time to buckle down and say
[1:22:52] devil
[1:22:54] i see the darkness
[1:22:56] i see these things that are going on in
[1:22:58] the world
[1:23:00] but i'm gonna pull the sword
[1:23:03] and i'm gonna start chopping
[1:23:05] in all the things that i see in my life
[1:23:08] i'm going to start chopping with the
[1:23:09] worm
[1:23:11] all the things i see
[1:23:12] and maybe my brothers or my sister's
[1:23:14] life that they may be struggling with
[1:23:16] i'm going to go to prayer and i'm going
[1:23:18] to start chopping for them too
[1:23:21] and i'm gonna start chopping for my
[1:23:23] family now i'm gonna start fighting for
[1:23:25] my brothers and sisters
[1:23:28] and i'm gonna start fighting for for all
[1:23:30] those that we don't even know may be out
[1:23:32] there right now
[1:23:34] so we may not pray for the world in the
[1:23:37] sense oh lord just let the world be the
[1:23:40] way the way because we know it's not
[1:23:42] going to be that way until jesus comes
[1:23:46] but say lord
[1:23:47] help me to find
[1:23:49] those that you have predestinated
[1:23:52] help me to save it as many as i can
[1:23:55] you know you know and many times we
[1:23:57] don't even know you know when someone
[1:23:59] comes in your life and and does
[1:24:01] something kind for you or you know not a
[1:24:03] not a glass of water given that his name
[1:24:05] will be forgotten
[1:24:06] we don't even know what the lord's doing
[1:24:09] but the lord's working
[1:24:11] and the devil tries to make you think
[1:24:13] just because these battles are going on
[1:24:15] and and different ones in the church get
[1:24:16] sick and oh there's necessarily got to
[1:24:18] be something wrong that's not the case
[1:24:20] there's got to be battles brothers and
[1:24:22] sisters there's got to be battles
[1:24:24] because if you're going to be an
[1:24:26] overcomer then we've got to have
[1:24:28] obstacles to overcome there's another
[1:24:30] contrast
[1:24:32] if you're going to be in how can you how
[1:24:34] can you find the solution to a math
[1:24:36] problem
[1:24:37] except there be a problem to solve
[1:24:40] how can you overcome an enemy except
[1:24:43] there be an enemy to fight
[1:24:46] how can you win a victory except there
[1:24:48] are
[1:24:49] there has to be a battle that lies
[1:24:51] before you
[1:24:52] and the battle that lies before the
[1:24:54] pride of jesus christ is great
[1:24:56] and even though we have to press we've
[1:24:59] got to press we've got to press like
[1:25:01] paul said i press that's not that's not
[1:25:05] a one-time pressing
[1:25:07] that's not just just pressed for a short
[1:25:09] period but it's the continual pushing
[1:25:12] it's a continual pushing it's a
[1:25:14] continual pushing it's a continuous
[1:25:16] marching forward
[1:25:20] but the rest we can have
[1:25:22] is in the fact that we know the battle's
[1:25:24] already won amen but we merely march
[1:25:27] forward to bring to pass what he's
[1:25:30] already spoken of us
[1:25:33] you are a living embodiment
[1:25:36] of the word coming to pass in this day
[1:25:41] you
[1:25:42] are a living embodiment
[1:25:44] of the word of god coming to pass in
[1:25:47] this day can i say it this way you
[1:25:50] the bride of jesus christ
[1:25:53] are literally prophecy being fulfilled
[1:25:57] your life is prophecy being fulfilled
[1:26:01] when you walk forward in the name of
[1:26:03] jesus christ and stand with this word
[1:26:06] and don't give in to the wiles of the
[1:26:08] devil don't compromise on it but you
[1:26:10] stand there
[1:26:11] it may not look like anything from the
[1:26:13] outside but shadrach meshach and
[1:26:15] abednego daniel with the lion's den they
[1:26:18] didn't look like anything from the
[1:26:19] outside at the time but when the time
[1:26:22] came
[1:26:23] it was like contrast again wasn't it
[1:26:26] it was an entire kingdom against three
[1:26:28] hebrew boys
[1:26:30] it was an entire kingdom against one man
[1:26:33] who refused to give into the king's
[1:26:34] commandment
[1:26:38] that's what we're coming to right now
[1:26:42] i'm not trying don't want to get
[1:26:43] political
[1:26:44] in that sense
[1:26:45] but we understand that there are a lot
[1:26:48] of opposing viewpoints
[1:26:50] that are at play when it comes to
[1:26:53] freedom to worship god
[1:26:56] we understand that i'm not even going to
[1:26:58] go deep into it but we understand it i
[1:26:59] don't even have to say it we know
[1:27:04] and believe you me
[1:27:07] if it's if it's this time
[1:27:09] or if it's the next time
[1:27:11] or if it's the time after that i don't
[1:27:13] know
[1:27:15] what i do know
[1:27:16] is that it's coming to that place again
[1:27:20] where you better believe
[1:27:22] that they're going to be looking for
[1:27:23] people like us
[1:27:25] who refuse to compromise on the word
[1:27:30] that contrast is coming
[1:27:33] that contrast is already here
[1:27:35] spiritually
[1:27:36] and it's going to manifest in the
[1:27:38] natural
[1:27:39] i don't know how
[1:27:41] exactly
[1:27:42] i don't know what form it's going to
[1:27:44] take i wouldn't claim to know all these
[1:27:45] things it's part of the faith that we
[1:27:47] walk in
[1:27:48] it's to know that to know that we
[1:27:51] already have the victory
[1:27:55] and just like the three hebrew boys
[1:27:56] could say whether or not he'll deliver
[1:27:58] us deliver us in this fashion i don't
[1:28:01] know
[1:28:02] but what i do know is that i will not
[1:28:05] bow
[1:28:06] to anything other than the lord jesus
[1:28:08] christ and his word
[1:28:13] and it's going to be a contrast
[1:28:16] you realize when you when you sisters
[1:28:19] if you if you have jobs or whatever you
[1:28:21] go to work or even you just go to the
[1:28:23] store
[1:28:24] you are a contrast
[1:28:26] to the rest of the world
[1:28:28] and the women you are you are a rebuke
[1:28:31] to the women walking around where
[1:28:33] nothing
[1:28:36] you don't even maybe even realize it
[1:28:37] because because to you this is life this
[1:28:40] is who you are you're living it
[1:28:43] you don't feel uncomfortable
[1:28:46] living
[1:28:47] in holiness
[1:28:48] because that's part of you
[1:28:51] but you don't even know that your life
[1:28:53] is a contrast
[1:28:55] everywhere you go
[1:28:56] and brothers it may not be like that so
[1:28:59] much on the outside but spiritually
[1:29:01] speaking
[1:29:02] it's a contrast
[1:29:04] when you don't give in
[1:29:06] and go out with them and you tell the
[1:29:08] people that oh did you see this thing
[1:29:10] that happened on tv and you tell them no
[1:29:11] i i don't own a tv
[1:29:14] i was just actually i was just telling a
[1:29:16] guy the other day he was mentioning
[1:29:17] something about some tv show i said i
[1:29:19] don't know i said i'll be honest i
[1:29:20] haven't owned a tv in 20 years and he
[1:29:22] said what
[1:29:24] he about broke his neck turned his head
[1:29:26] so fast
[1:29:28] but that's just a simple thing but even
[1:29:30] the way you talk
[1:29:32] the the way the way you the way you
[1:29:34] speak the atmosphere that you have
[1:29:36] is is so different from the world
[1:29:40] whether or not they can put their finger
[1:29:42] on it
[1:29:43] whether or not they're consciously aware
[1:29:45] of it
[1:29:47] you are a contrast
[1:29:49] to everything about their life
[1:29:53] because it can't because you don't even
[1:29:54] know that the light the spiritual light
[1:29:58] that is shining off of your life
[1:30:01] is so much greater
[1:30:03] than even what you can see or hear
[1:30:07] that that you can't even imagine
[1:30:10] it's the grace of god that we stand
[1:30:14] so many times we can take if we're not
[1:30:16] careful we always take it for granted
[1:30:19] that we can actually believe this
[1:30:21] when the rest of the world is is
[1:30:24] constantly spiraling downward to
[1:30:27] insanity
[1:30:29] the scripture declared what it would be
[1:30:31] it said they would they would believe
[1:30:33] things that were that weren't even
[1:30:34] convenient
[1:30:38] things that didn't even make logical
[1:30:40] sense
[1:30:42] the bible even says that there'd be
[1:30:44] accusations of science that were falsely
[1:30:46] so-called they're calling it science
[1:30:49] it's not even science
[1:30:51] you know real real science will back up
[1:30:53] the word
[1:30:57] because any real real thinking man
[1:31:01] can only come to one conclusion and
[1:31:02] that's that god's word is true amen
[1:31:08] amen we'll just
[1:31:09] maybe just wind it down
[1:31:13] you know we've
[1:31:15] these contrasts
[1:31:17] that were coming you know i've talked a
[1:31:18] lot we spoke a lot this evening on the
[1:31:20] contrast with the world i forgive me if
[1:31:22] it seems kind of broken or something i'm
[1:31:23] not a very eloquent speaker so
[1:31:25] you forgive me i just try to speak
[1:31:27] whatever the lord puts on my heart and
[1:31:30] and even then many times i feel like it
[1:31:31] doesn't come out the way you desire to
[1:31:33] come out but
[1:31:36] i really just want to encourage you you
[1:31:38] know as we're just kind of starting here
[1:31:39] in these few days lord willing will have
[1:31:41] these four days of little meetings and
[1:31:43] things
[1:31:44] and and
[1:31:45] i just wanted to maybe the lord put on
[1:31:47] my heart to say to bring us into a place
[1:31:50] where we can really have faith
[1:31:52] for what we're standing for and who we
[1:31:54] are
[1:31:55] and have courage in the fact that the
[1:31:58] things that are going on the battles
[1:32:00] that you're fighting
[1:32:01] the because we're all fighting battles
[1:32:03] every one of us
[1:32:05] the the few of us that are here now you
[1:32:07] know all of all of the ones that are
[1:32:08] maybe watching on a live stream you know
[1:32:10] are either battling if we're not
[1:32:12] battling physically we're all battling
[1:32:14] spiritually
[1:32:16] because every day is that battle where
[1:32:17] that old man's trying to raise up and
[1:32:19] you got to put him down
[1:32:20] he raises up you got to put him down you
[1:32:22] got to you got to strike him down and
[1:32:24] behead him with the word of god every
[1:32:26] day
[1:32:27] you've got to because he's there to
[1:32:30] raise up every day that's the battle
[1:32:31] we're all we're all fighting that battle
[1:32:34] but we have to understand see the the
[1:32:37] age
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:39] there's a purpose behind it though
[1:32:43] the the darker the age the age that
[1:32:45] we're living in as dark as it is
[1:32:48] it's here for a purpose
[1:32:50] you know the scripture says in in
[1:32:52] corinth and first i believe it's first
[1:32:53] corinthians
[1:32:55] that
[1:32:56] paul was talking about he says there
[1:32:58] there are he says i've heard that there
[1:32:59] are heresies among you
[1:33:02] he says and he said there must be
[1:33:04] heresies among you he said and he said
[1:33:06] he says so that those that are approved
[1:33:08] can be made manifest
[1:33:11] so paul is showing us that these issues
[1:33:14] even came into the church people
[1:33:16] bringing in heresies and things that
[1:33:18] were off the word were brought
[1:33:20] specifically
[1:33:21] the lord allowed it to happen so that he
[1:33:24] could show that his word
[1:33:27] and what was true and what wasn't
[1:33:30] so is it with us the believer you the
[1:33:33] believer brothers or sisters wherever
[1:33:35] you may be
[1:33:36] the bride of this age
[1:33:39] has been brought here
[1:33:42] in this dark age
[1:33:44] to manifest contrast
[1:33:47] to the world
[1:33:49] when you see the people
[1:33:51] that you may work with
[1:33:53] speaking ill one of another you have
[1:33:55] been brought for a purpose to bring a
[1:33:57] contrast of perfect love to the
[1:34:00] situation
[1:34:03] when you see people
[1:34:04] that have no hope
[1:34:06] that that can't understand why the world
[1:34:09] is as crazy as it is
[1:34:10] they don't understand why they they feel
[1:34:13] so depressed
[1:34:14] and they they just can't get out of the
[1:34:16] hole that they're in god has put within
[1:34:19] you a life
[1:34:21] that can contrast
[1:34:23] and can show that person
[1:34:25] that there is a peace in jesus christ
[1:34:30] that there is a hope and a real faith
[1:34:33] and a real love in jesus christ you have
[1:34:37] been brought specifically to contrast
[1:34:40] that
[1:34:43] if there be
[1:34:44] sickness
[1:34:47] you've been brought god has put in you
[1:34:49] the power
[1:34:51] to be a contrast with healing power in
[1:34:54] the name of jesus christ amen
[1:34:57] if there be someone that needs saving
[1:35:01] someone that needs
[1:35:02] holy ghost in their life
[1:35:05] you've been brought as a contrast
[1:35:08] to offer
[1:35:10] let me pray for you
[1:35:12] let me show you the word
[1:35:15] how to receive it
[1:35:17] let me show you that god is still alive
[1:35:19] and well
[1:35:21] that god still fulfills his promise that
[1:35:23] god still
[1:35:25] makes himself known amongst his people
[1:35:29] when the world
[1:35:30] is is doing those things that there is
[1:35:33] god put it within you the believer
[1:35:36] within your soul with the holy ghost
[1:35:38] that's in you it exists
[1:35:41] to be a contrasting light
[1:35:45] to the darkness that the world is
[1:35:46] showing
[1:35:48] but don't expect it to go over well with
[1:35:50] everybody
[1:35:53] don't expect it to be well received
[1:35:56] because we know that the hour is late
[1:35:59] it's gleaning time
[1:36:02] narrow is the way
[1:36:05] there's going to be very few that find
[1:36:07] the door
[1:36:09] that really find the door
[1:36:12] and we understand we read and john
[1:36:15] said the light shined in darkness and
[1:36:17] the darkness comprehended it not
[1:36:19] that's why
[1:36:21] you won't be understood
[1:36:23] it gets so easy i sit so much with like
[1:36:26] young the more more of the younger
[1:36:28] people and you know i ca i can only
[1:36:30] imagine
[1:36:32] you know i graduated almost
[1:36:34] oh lord it's 2020. so i graduated 18
[1:36:36] years ago now it was really hard to
[1:36:38] believe but 18 years ago i've been i'm
[1:36:40] 36 now i've been out of high school as
[1:36:43] long as i was in school i was 18 and 18.
[1:36:45] so you know i but it's it's hard to
[1:36:47] imagine just in those 18 short years
[1:36:50] you know i remember being in that that
[1:36:52] place and if there's any younger people
[1:36:54] i just trust you're listening because i
[1:36:56] i guess i just kind of have a burden for
[1:36:57] that a lot because i've seen it and
[1:36:59] there's such a desire to be accepted
[1:37:02] and just to be part of something
[1:37:04] be a part of the body of christ
[1:37:09] the lord jesus will give you all the
[1:37:12] comfort
[1:37:13] that that drugs would love to offer you
[1:37:16] but can't give you
[1:37:17] that alcohol would offer to you but will
[1:37:20] never be able to satisfy
[1:37:22] that that that women and or men or
[1:37:25] whatever it is would would try to fill
[1:37:27] that hole but nothing can do it
[1:37:29] jesus christ is the only
[1:37:32] only one who can
[1:37:34] only one who can and so many are looking
[1:37:36] for that acceptance so i want to be part
[1:37:38] of this group or that group if you want
[1:37:40] to be a christian you'll never be
[1:37:42] accepted
[1:37:44] by those groups
[1:37:47] and we've and i see so many people
[1:37:50] struggling with that that battle
[1:37:54] because they want to be accepted by the
[1:37:56] world
[1:37:57] but they have a desire to live for god
[1:38:00] and there's got to be a choice made
[1:38:03] remember god is a separator
[1:38:05] and you're going to have to separate one
[1:38:07] from the other
[1:38:08] and make your choice and decide this day
[1:38:11] who you're going to serve
[1:38:15] and you've got to understand that you
[1:38:17] will not be accepted
[1:38:19] because the light shines in that
[1:38:21] darkness and the darkness can't
[1:38:22] understand it it can't comprehend it
[1:38:24] it cannot
[1:38:26] it will not
[1:38:27] if in the garden of eden god himself
[1:38:30] could try to explain to cain
[1:38:33] how to come the proper way and he could
[1:38:35] not do it
[1:38:36] how much less
[1:38:38] for us trying to shine the light to
[1:38:41] people that don't want anything to do
[1:38:42] with god
[1:38:45] so we've got to stop trying to be
[1:38:46] accepted by that
[1:38:48] and i i'm speaking
[1:38:50] now who am i going to obey my my my my
[1:38:53] empathy and my my desire to help my
[1:38:56] brother would be very strong no doubt
[1:38:59] having a love for brother jesse wanting
[1:39:00] to help and do that but but if the lord
[1:39:03] has given me a command
[1:39:05] said no this isn't the season no i don't
[1:39:08] want you to go this time
[1:39:10] it could make you no i believe don't
[1:39:11] believe brother jesse would get
[1:39:13] necessarily in a twist about it
[1:39:16] but there's no doubt that the devil
[1:39:17] would be right there to do that if i was
[1:39:18] saying no brother i don't feel led why
[1:39:20] because you know the accuser the devil
[1:39:23] he don't like to he he's not gonna put
[1:39:24] he's not going to let that go he's going
[1:39:26] to be right there maybe your brother
[1:39:28] jesse's here oh that brother he's just
[1:39:29] trying to make excuses you know he
[1:39:31] doesn't really love you if he did he'd
[1:39:33] come out or you know this and that and
[1:39:35] the devil's going to be right there and
[1:39:35] the devil's going to be right there in
[1:39:36] my ear oh are you really sure that the
[1:39:38] lord told you that you know if you
[1:39:40] really love brother jesse you'd go help
[1:39:41] him out and and this and but we
[1:39:43] understand who what is it better to obey
[1:39:45] god or man
[1:39:47] are we going to obey our own affections
[1:39:49] and our own thoughts
[1:39:51] and our own desires or are we going to
[1:39:52] obey the word of god to the point where
[1:39:55] as as we're told by brother branham
[1:39:56] we're just just the least little bit of
[1:39:58] his desire is what we run to do
[1:40:01] that's where we're supposed to be that's
[1:40:03] where we're going god has put that
[1:40:05] contrasting life inside each and every
[1:40:08] one of you
[1:40:09] you don't even know it the devil many
[1:40:11] times blinds us to it because we stumble
[1:40:13] and we fall we have our problems we have
[1:40:15] our struggles that we have
[1:40:17] but praise the lord even though we're
[1:40:19] pressing even though every day we're
[1:40:21] fighting paradoxically we're resting at
[1:40:24] the same time
[1:40:25] because we're not i'm not even though
[1:40:27] i'm fighting every day i'm not fighting
[1:40:29] by my own strength i'm fighting with the
[1:40:31] word that he gave us with the promises
[1:40:34] that he's promised to us that we're more
[1:40:36] than overcomers that he that begun a
[1:40:38] good work in you is faithful to complete
[1:40:41] it
[1:40:42] so i know
[1:40:43] even though i'm running the race
[1:40:47] there there's there's a me over there
[1:40:50] that's already made it
[1:40:52] why because it witnesses in here
[1:40:55] that there's something for me there
[1:40:58] and so all i do is i keep pressing
[1:41:00] pressing and that's what we're here to
[1:41:02] do
[1:41:03] by the grace of god over these next few
[1:41:05] nights that the lord will allow we'll
[1:41:07] see what the lord will do
[1:41:09] but just remember just keep pressing
[1:41:12] just keep pressing if you need something
[1:41:14] from god it's already done for you
[1:41:17] but all you got to do is press into it
[1:41:21] it's a paradox
[1:41:22] it's to hold on to it but at the same
[1:41:25] time relax and know that it's already
[1:41:26] over
[1:41:29] but but god gives us the grace to do
[1:41:31] that
[1:41:32] and so many how many times can we look
[1:41:34] back at our lives and say lord i don't
[1:41:35] even know how i'm still here
[1:41:37] i was i would i felt pressed beyond
[1:41:40] measure
[1:41:41] you know i felt i felt like my spirit
[1:41:43] was just like water
[1:41:45] i just felt like i just couldn't i
[1:41:47] couldn't see i couldn't even see how
[1:41:49] there was a way to tomorrow let alone
[1:41:52] the next five minutes
[1:41:55] but we're still standing by the grace of
[1:41:57] god we're still here we're pressing into
[1:42:00] the perfection of that statue of a
[1:42:02] perfect man the work has been completed
[1:42:04] in you right now you are a greater
[1:42:07] contrast every day to this insane world
[1:42:11] you know how crazy people think you are
[1:42:12] to show up with covet going on to show
[1:42:16] up on a thursday night when it's dreary
[1:42:18] and cold and rainy
[1:42:23] but you know what we're preston
[1:42:25] so praise the lord for the press praise
[1:42:28] the lord for for that desire
[1:42:31] to even to even serve god to really have
[1:42:35] a desire to put him first
[1:42:38] hey man let's just all stand
[1:42:40] i hope that was okay
[1:42:42] we just want to maybe bring some
[1:42:44] encouragement you know
[1:42:45] this age that we're living it's so it's
[1:42:47] so full of fear
[1:42:49] and everywhere you turn you know i work
[1:42:51] for the government
[1:42:52] i'm in air traffic control i work for
[1:42:54] the government so you know everywhere
[1:42:56] it's always we have this you know since
[1:42:58] i work for the government you see all
[1:43:00] the things that they're doing oh we have
[1:43:01] to do this and you have to do this and
[1:43:02] you have to be worried about this and
[1:43:04] then every time something happens
[1:43:05] everybody gets notified about it you got
[1:43:07] to look at this and this and be very
[1:43:08] careful because we're we're going to
[1:43:09] clean this and don't touch that and
[1:43:12] you know it's just the devil just
[1:43:14] working everything up
[1:43:16] he just you know
[1:43:17] he's just
[1:43:18] building the pressure building the
[1:43:20] pressure building the pressure
[1:43:25] praise the lord we can we can let off
[1:43:27] the pressure amen we can
[1:43:30] we can rest even though we're pressing
[1:43:32] even though it's a battle
[1:43:34] we can rest
[1:43:35] in his promises
[1:43:38] see the devil and i guess this is the
[1:43:40] crux of what i wanted to say i'm really
[1:43:41] grateful that the lord brought it back
[1:43:42] to my mind
[1:43:43] see the devil
[1:43:45] gets us so fixated
[1:43:48] on us
[1:43:50] trying to win a victory
[1:43:53] just because we understand he's made us
[1:43:55] overcomers he puts these obstacles in
[1:43:57] our way
[1:43:58] so that by his grace
[1:44:00] we can overcome them
[1:44:01] and prove his word
[1:44:03] prove to the devil even prove to
[1:44:05] ourselves
[1:44:07] that god is living that he's alive that
[1:44:10] his spirit is just as strong as it has
[1:44:12] ever been
[1:44:14] but the devil so many times puts the
[1:44:16] onus on us in the flesh so you got to
[1:44:18] win this victory you got to do this
[1:44:20] victory you got to do this you have to
[1:44:21] do that while we're pressing and we're
[1:44:22] pressing we're doing the best that we
[1:44:24] can but what the lord is trying to tell
[1:44:26] us is even though we're pressing and
[1:44:28] we're looking to win a victory we're not
[1:44:30] looking
[1:44:31] at the victory
[1:44:33] we're not looking just at the victory
[1:44:35] that we're trying to win for whatever
[1:44:37] obstacle is in your way now
[1:44:39] but we can look you say satan it's not
[1:44:42] about whether i can win the victory
[1:44:46] it's about the fact that the victory was
[1:44:48] already won
[1:44:49] and i'm resting i'm not resting in my
[1:44:52] ability to overcome
[1:44:55] this is what i want to say
[1:44:57] by the grace of god i'm not resting we
[1:44:59] cannot rest in our ability to overcome
[1:45:03] but we rest in the fact that he has
[1:45:06] already overcome for us
[1:45:09] if i could say it like that
[1:45:12] that would be the crux of the whole
[1:45:13] thing
[1:45:14] i don't rest
[1:45:16] in my ability to overcome i rest
[1:45:19] in the fact that jesus christ already
[1:45:21] overcame for me
[1:45:23] he said brother that's so simple if it
[1:45:26] was if it was but i tell you what
[1:45:27] brother it is simple
[1:45:29] but it's not
[1:45:30] just because it's simple doesn't mean
[1:45:32] it's easy
[1:45:34] and i can say it that way
[1:45:36] just because it's simple doesn't mean
[1:45:38] it's easy
[1:45:39] because we all know
[1:45:41] that he said it is finished we all know
[1:45:45] that greater is he that is in us that he
[1:45:47] that is in the world
[1:45:48] but somebody that
[1:45:50] gets our eyes focused on ourselves
[1:45:52] in our current situation no i don't look
[1:45:55] at my situation
[1:45:57] because he fixed the situation
[1:46:00] not just on calvary but before the
[1:46:03] foundation of the world the works were
[1:46:04] finished
[1:46:06] but we looked at calvary because that
[1:46:07] was the fulfillment of it
[1:46:10] and so i don't rest i'm gonna say it one
[1:46:12] more time i don't rest in my ability to
[1:46:15] overcome
[1:46:16] i rest in the fact that jesus christ has
[1:46:19] already overcome for me
[1:46:21] amen
[1:46:23] so just rest in that
[1:46:25] yeah you're gonna fight yeah we'll get
[1:46:27] weary
[1:46:28] that's why the scripture we we we would
[1:46:31] be fighting weariness
[1:46:32] we have to be fighting weariness
[1:46:34] otherwise the scripture wouldn't say
[1:46:36] don't be weary in well-doing
[1:46:38] why would the scripture encourage us not
[1:46:40] to be weary
[1:46:41] if there wasn't going to be weariness
[1:46:43] trying to bring you down
[1:46:47] so don't be weary in well-doing
[1:46:49] well you've done all you can do to stand
[1:46:51] stand
[1:46:52] yeah these are simple things but this is
[1:46:54] what's going to make bring us to a
[1:46:55] rapture
[1:46:58] oh we could we could the mysteries are
[1:46:59] wonderful those things are great but
[1:47:01] when it comes down to it
[1:47:03] when the rubber meets the road as we
[1:47:05] like to say it's are you going to take
[1:47:07] god at his word or not
[1:47:08] are you gonna believe that he overcame
[1:47:10] for you already or not
[1:47:13] because that's all the hebrew boys could
[1:47:14] do
[1:47:15] that's all daniel could do
[1:47:17] daniel said i've done all i can do
[1:47:19] i did not bow to the to the to the word
[1:47:22] of the king i prayed to my god
[1:47:25] i didn't bow the knee
[1:47:27] and then he said well that's all i can
[1:47:29] do but all i can do is stand on the fact
[1:47:31] that i what i know is true
[1:47:34] the three hebrew voice said we didn't
[1:47:35] bow the knee either
[1:47:37] i don't know i can't do anything else
[1:47:40] other than stand
[1:47:41] on the fact that i know
[1:47:44] that what we believe is true and i
[1:47:45] followed the word of god to the best
[1:47:46] that we could
[1:47:48] and that's what we're looking to do by
[1:47:49] the grace of god let's just bow our
[1:47:51] heads in a word of prayer heavenly
[1:47:52] father
[1:47:53] lord as we just come before you this
[1:47:55] evening we're just once again reminded
[1:47:57] oh lord that the works were finished
[1:47:59] lord before the foundation of the world
[1:48:00] lord jesus
[1:48:02] lord even though we battle and we
[1:48:04] struggle every single day we wake up and
[1:48:07] it seems like the devil is he's always
[1:48:09] faithful in that sense that he's always
[1:48:10] there to accuse us in the fight in the
[1:48:12] battle and to try to hinder but lord
[1:48:16] we know that you were already faithful
[1:48:17] lord on calvary father
[1:48:19] and we've even understood by revelation
[1:48:21] that even beyond that lord jesus that
[1:48:24] before the foundation of the world you
[1:48:25] had this already said
[1:48:27] lord that you that you gave us promises
[1:48:30] that you wouldn't give us the promises
[1:48:31] if it wasn't to fulfill them lord that
[1:48:33] we can rest upon those promises lord and
[1:48:35] even though we're battling and fighting
[1:48:38] and and the world may think we're crazy
[1:48:39] but in a paradox that at the same time
[1:48:41] even though we're battling and fighting
[1:48:43] we can rest with blessed assurance oh
[1:48:46] god knowing that you've already finished
[1:48:47] the work lord that we don't have to look
[1:48:50] at our own ability lord we don't have to
[1:48:52] look at our own perfection but we're
[1:48:54] looking on the perfection of the lamb of
[1:48:56] god that takes away the sin of the world
[1:48:59] that that lord brought us into your
[1:49:01] presence lord filled us with your spirit
[1:49:03] has brought us into this word
[1:49:05] and lord is even now perfecting us and
[1:49:07] drawing us closer piece by piece by
[1:49:09] piece
[1:49:11] lord as
[1:49:12] we've just come to start these little
[1:49:14] meetings that brother jesse had in his
[1:49:15] heart to have and
[1:49:17] lord no doubt that
[1:49:18] father
[1:49:20] want to do something marvelous with your
[1:49:21] people otherwise the devil wouldn't
[1:49:23] fight the way that he does we believe
[1:49:25] that lord and we're trusting in you with
[1:49:27] that lord we just pray that you just
[1:49:29] minister to each one as they would have
[1:49:31] need oh god lord i know my abilities are
[1:49:33] nothing and
[1:49:34] lord my my own
[1:49:36] ability to speak as an orator maybe not
[1:49:39] be anything special or anything father
[1:49:41] but just talking with ones before how
[1:49:44] they said it's not it's not about the
[1:49:46] intellectual
[1:49:47] because no doubt as paul said it wasn't
[1:49:49] with wisdom of words or speech but with
[1:49:51] power and demonstration of the holy
[1:49:53] ghost father and it's you that's the
[1:49:54] great interpreter that can take mixed up
[1:49:57] words of immortal
[1:49:58] lord and can quicken it into the heart
[1:50:00] of a believer and bring it unto fruits
[1:50:02] to everlasting life into perfection
[1:50:04] father that's a paradox lord for your
[1:50:06] word said that by the foolishes of
[1:50:08] preaching you chose to save them that
[1:50:09] are lost
[1:50:10] lord so that no man could glory but we
[1:50:13] heap all the praise and glory upon you
[1:50:15] our lord jesus we just want to glorify
[1:50:17] and lift you up lord we thank you for it
[1:50:19] father we pray that you'd be with
[1:50:21] everyone that was able to press their
[1:50:22] way out this evening for those that are
[1:50:24] maybe watching over a live stream lord
[1:50:26] we even we thank you lord for lord the
[1:50:29] the good that comes out of the tree of
[1:50:31] the knowledge of good and evil lord that
[1:50:32] we would even be able to do that father
[1:50:34] that that lord as it was even the day of
[1:50:38] when the prophet was speaking and how
[1:50:40] they would do radio hookups how we could
[1:50:41] even do it now to even have the sight
[1:50:43] lord
[1:50:44] to be able to see and we're grateful for
[1:50:46] those things father we pray that it
[1:50:48] would always be used for your glory and
[1:50:50] we would just magnify you for it lord
[1:50:52] jesus we thank you we just pray that you
[1:50:54] bless each and every one and may you
[1:50:56] just guide us and direct us lord let us
[1:50:58] be that contrast lord whenever we see
[1:51:01] lord the the evil that the world is
[1:51:03] wrought whether it be a sickness lord
[1:51:04] know that
[1:51:05] lord we have healing power that you put
[1:51:07] in us lord not that it's our that is our
[1:51:09] ability father but but your life that
[1:51:12] you put in the believer is a contrast to
[1:51:15] the sickness that the world would have
[1:51:17] that the peace that you put in us as
[1:51:18] believer is a contrast to the to the
[1:51:21] torment that the world has lord that the
[1:51:23] power that you've placed in the believer
[1:51:25] by your holy ghost is a contrast to the
[1:51:28] weakness and bondage that the world is
[1:51:30] in and oh god you've chosen us to be
[1:51:33] here in this hour lord not that we would
[1:51:34] glorify ourselves but just to show to be
[1:51:37] a proof a living proof and a living word
[1:51:40] in this hour that you are alive and well
[1:51:43] and oh god that you're here to express
[1:51:45] your life to the world lord even though
[1:51:47] the numbers may be smaller and smaller
[1:51:50] as we get closer and closer to that hour
[1:51:51] when you take your bride away and the
[1:51:53] and the children of the bond women be so
[1:51:56] many more than the children of the free
[1:51:58] woman
[1:51:59] but god we're resting upon your word
[1:52:01] lord god when you said you'd never leave
[1:52:03] us nor forsake us lord we're looking
[1:52:05] upon your word as we i just take such
[1:52:08] consolation of the the three hebrew boys
[1:52:10] lord that would stand against an entire
[1:52:12] empire lord god that daniel would stand
[1:52:14] against an entire empire
[1:52:16] oh god how paul could stand against the
[1:52:18] roman empire paul and those apostles
[1:52:20] that went before oh god and you've
[1:52:22] called us to to have another book of
[1:52:24] acts written behind your people oh god
[1:52:26] if we have to stand up against an
[1:52:28] american empire oh god and a worldly
[1:52:30] empire that would seek to destroy
[1:52:32] everything that would have the knowledge
[1:52:34] of the lord jesus christ give us the
[1:52:36] strength oh god not in our own ability
[1:52:38] but in standing and knowing that when
[1:52:40] we've all we've done all that we can do
[1:52:41] lord whether you deliver us in the flesh
[1:52:43] or not whatever it is oh god we know
[1:52:45] that we can stand firm lord holding our
[1:52:48] faith to the end fast oh god knowing
[1:52:50] that the reward lord is is worth the
[1:52:52] sacrifice of god because how great was
[1:52:55] the sacrifice you gave the lord
[1:52:57] we just love you
[1:52:59] we pray oh god that you would be
[1:53:00] glorified
