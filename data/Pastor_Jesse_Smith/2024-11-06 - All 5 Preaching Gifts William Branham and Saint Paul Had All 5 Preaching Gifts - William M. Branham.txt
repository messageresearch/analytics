TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] for Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists for the perfecting of the church then pastors and teachers and so forth will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ did God's Prophet William brandham have all five preaching gifts I believe the answer is yes by the grace of God this video will show the quotes that prove that just as St Paul had all five preaching gifts hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor Bri of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William Marin brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 let's begin with the life of St Paul and again prove how he had all five preaching gifts and he just was led by the spirit to move into each gift or preaching Channel as the Holy Ghost directed him it seems by God's grace that the Holy Ghost would lead a man like St Paul and brother brandham to transition into different gifts when the Holy Ghost wanted to use that man in that particular Ministry so St Paul was no doubt an apostle Romans 1 ver1 tells us that Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated un the gospel of God St Paul was a prophet in 1 Thessalonians 4:1 15-17 he says for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord so Paul prophesied of the catching up or the Rapture the pre-tribulation Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ Paul was the first pastor at Ephesus according to acts 20:31 Paul said he taught them the full counsel of God in Acts chapter 20 and then ceased not to warn everyone Night and Day With Tears by the space of three years so Paul was the pastor 3 years in Ephesus Paul was a teacher in 1 Timothy 2 s he said a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and Varity and Paul also did evangelism acts 15:36 Paul said unto Barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they do so now we can see a Biblical precedent for a man having all five preaching gifts let's look at the life of brother brandham and I tried to put these gifts in order that they happen in his life and so if I'm wrong in anything please forgive me and please share a quote with me that would help correct me by the grace of God the first preaching gift brother BR had was a pastor in this first quote from 1964 brother Ram said he was ordained as one of the local Pastors in the Missionary Baptist Church so his first preaching gift would have been a pastoral gift let's listen to the quote then about 17 years after that I was had become a minister a Baptist preacher of the Missionary Baptist Church Dr Roy E Davis ordain me as one of the local pastors give me ride sand the state Mary Berry baptize so forth and uh the missionary baptist church burned down which I was assistant pastor at the time and Mr Davis come back to Texas which was of Davis Mountains and and U Down near Van harn Texas that's where they come from and so while he was gone I started to take over the congregation got a tent and I be to preach in the city just a boy preacher the next three gifts show how brother Bram was a prophet of God and of course I mean by this is speaking with thus sayith the Lord Brother Bram speaking with thus sayith the Lord we know he had Visions as a young boy but I think there's a difference when a man is a ordained preacher and he begins to share Visions with us sayith the Lord so we'll start in Shalom 1964 brother Ram said since 1933 when the Holy Spirit gave me that visions and showed me the end time seven things that I spoke of and five of them has already happened perfectly right on and then in Souls that are in prison 1963 brother Ram said just exactly what's wrote on my book of Prophecy in 1933 and then a third quote about the seven major Visions showing brother brandham was a prophet was from conference November 25th 1960 the seven major Visions came to brother brandham in June of 1933 on his way to Sunday school let's listen to the quotes and is it not a strange thing that in this day that when we have come through all these things and the message has crossed the Earth against organization it's blasted it from right to left amen that in this hour that's been told since 1933 when the Holy Spirit gave me that visions and show me the end time seven things that I spoke of and five of them has already happened perfectly right on like Germany and and Italy and all the wars and the national things s speaks to me on those things but they happened just exactly the way he said it happened yeah I know that see just exactly what's wrote on my book of Prophecy in 1933 that would take place amen I picked up a prophecy I didn't I was a pastor of the Baptist Church there I didn't even know what a vision meant and now D things would happen i' call it falling into a trance I didn't know to call it a vision at that time I was just a boy 1933 on June I was on my way to Sunday school and while I was getting my Bible a vision came before me and I was stopped in the floor and here was what it's said it's on yellow paper will be printed in the herald of Faith right away because most all of it is fulfilled 19 and3 33 think of this now many many years ago about 28 years ago it it taken place watch how accurate his word is the third preaching gift that seemed to manifest in the life of William Brenham was the teacher and as a pastor brother BR would take time and teach the word of God so here's a quote from the seven Church ages 1954 brother Ram said he spent a year and 6 months in the Book of Revelation in teaching he said I just love teaching it gives the basis and settles the church let's listen to the quote I remember seeing a year in six months in This Book of Revelation and and the Tabernacle here that's what I like and and teaching I just love teaching oh my I I think it's wonderful it gives the bases and settles the church the fourth gift seem to manifest in brother Ram's Ministry in 1946 it was the gift of evangelism brother Ram said in 1946 he left the Tabernacle and went into the Evangelistic campaigns of healing Services first quote's from Israel and the church part 3 1953 second quote is from wi are people so tossed about 1956 he said he left in 1946 when I left the Tabernacle let's listen to the quotes and now in the healing campaigns and this is the first time I've had a Revival in 7 years of this type 7 years this coming week I left the Tabernacle and went out into the Evangelistic campaigns of healing services and I've committed to managers who's done the preaching mostly and I would only speak on the subject of Divine Healing because we were a mixed audience now a few weeks ago I had promised the Lord a or about 10 years ago when I left in 1946 when I left the Tabernacle that I would serve him with all my heart in these campaigns knowing that it was going to be a great disturbance out there Fifth and finally the gift that manifested was the Apostle the fifth and final preaching gift of the fightful ministry it seems and I could be wrong that brother Ram's trip to Finland in 1950 was his first missionary trip and I could be wrong on that so please correct me if I'm wrong but here in 1952 brother Ram said going overseas brother baxer the first time I said I was led to go to Finland of course we know that's where the little boy was raised from the dead just as the vision was showed to brother Brandon by the Holy Ghost let's listen to the quote from Get the people to believe 1952 going overseas brother Banker the first time I said I was led to go to Finland is that right finland's where the real meeting was the best of meetings leading to what I'm talking about thank you brother back so again here's my order of the five preaching gifts manifesting in the life of brother brandham around 1932 he was ordained as one of the pastors it seems in 1933 he gave his first Prophecy of the seven major visions and then his teaching gift manifested sometime after 1933 and before 1946 cuz in 1946 he went into evangelism and then his first Apostle trip missionary trip seemed to be 1950 in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God it's wonderful to look into the scripture and see a Bible precedent St Paul having five preaching gifts and then God sending us the seven Church age messenger brother brandham also with five preaching gifts so it's neat to see the alpha St Paul and the Omega Church age messenger brother William brandham both having five preaching gifts I'll just play one quote from Brother brandham perseverance 1962 he said I believe there's a church coming into that Perfection or maturity with the offices the five full ministry will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up unto the coming of the Lord I believe that I believe we're nearing that time now I believe it's so and I do as well Friends by the grace of God let's listen to the quote now I believe that there's a church coming into that Perfection that Ministry of perfection where the offices where Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelist for the perfecting of the church then pastors and teachers and so forth will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord I believe that and I believe we're nearing that time now I believe it so so we thank the Lord Jesus Christ for giving St Paul brother brandom and so many other preachers gifts in the fivefold ministry they unite the faith of the Believers they bring us to Perfection or maturity the fullness of the stature of Christ for each one of our Lives please pray for those preachers in the fful ministry that you're associated with ask God to reveal more of his truth to them so we can all be ready for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
