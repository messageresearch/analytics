TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] he said there was a test of a prophet if a prophet prophesied and that what he said come to pass and hearing but if it don't come to pass then God hasn't spoke that's all so don't don't fear Him that's right greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ what is a new testament prophet in this video I'll explain the requirements for a new testament Prophet by the grace of God this is the fourth video in the series of five videos on the five preaching gifts of the five full ministry according to Ephesians 4: 11 by God's grace we've already covered the Apostle the pastor and the [Music] Evangelist this video will cover the prophet and the final video will be on the teacher I'll begin with the definition of a prophet in the Hebrew lexicon the prophet is the spokesman or speaker for the Lord according to the lexicon so in both the Old Testament and the New Testament the prophet speaks for the Lord the prophet speaks in the name of the Lord the prophet will say thus sayith the Lord or the prophet will say something is spoken in the name of the Lord I want to start with two important points about prophets before I get into the six qualifications of a new testament Prophet the first point is that women cannot be New Testament preaching prophets but they can have any of the nine gifts of the Holy Ghost found in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 one of which is the gift of Prophecy women in the Old Testament and New Testament could have the gifts of Prophecy such as Miriam and Deborah in the Old Testament and Philip's four virgin daughters who prophesied according to the book of Acts if you like more teaching on this you can reference my video no women Angels no women preachers I'll leave a link in the description by the grace of God a second point is we need to differentiate between a preaching prophet and the gift of Prophecy the preaching prophets found in Ephesians 4:1 but the gift of Prophecy is in 1 Corinthians 12:10 to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy so the Bible teaches there's a difference between a new testament Prophet preacher who is a spiritual leader in the fiveo ministry and this new testament preaching Prophet can only be a man the New Testament differentiates the preaching Prophet from the man or woman who has the gift of Prophecy those who have the gifts of Prophecy are not leaders in the Church like a new testament preaching Prophet we can still call those men and women with the gift of Prophecy by the term prophets because we understand the difference between a preacher leader Prophet versus a person who has the gift of Prophecy the gifts of Prophecy which can be men or women need to be judged by two or three Witnesses when their prophecies are given according to 1 Corinthians 14 27-29 the Bible said if they speak in the unknown tongue Let It Be two or at the most by three and let one interpret verse 29 says let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judge so the gifts of Prophecy must be judged in the congregation of the Saints when those prophecies go forth or if they're shared also maybe dreams are shared or something like that they must also be judged they're judged by those who have the gift of discernment which is another of the nine gifts of the Holy Ghost according to 1 Corinthians chap 12 but a preaching Prophet or five-fold Ministry Prophet isn't judged by two or three Witnesses brother ran told us this in the Rapture sermon 1965 he said nobody set before a prophet because he was absolutely the word of God he was that word in his day brother Bram said the gift of prophecy two or three has to set and judge whether that's right or not for the church can receive it let's listen to the quote prophets there's such a thing as gift of Prophecy in a church but a prophet is predestinated and for our d for the hour yes sir now if a prophecy Goes Forth two or three has to set and judge where that's right or enough where the church can receive it but nobody set before a prophet because he was he was absolutely the word of God he was that word in his day you see God reflect now God has promised to send us that again in the last days to bring that bride out of that ecclesiastical mess and the only way it can be done as we'll get to later though the preaching prophet must be tested as brother random said so a preaching Prophet isn't judged by two or three Witnesses but a preaching Prophet is tested to be a prophet as brother random taught this lines up with Deuteronomy chapter 18 which is the test of a prophecy a prophecy that comes to pass proves the man is a preaching prophet of course that can also be applied to those who have the gift of Prophecy their prophecies must come to pass it's also important to remember though that some prophecies that are given by prophets are not fulfilled while the prophet is alive such as Isaiah's prophecy about the Rapture in Isaiah 25:8 this has still not come to pass and it's been well over 2,500 years since this prophecy was given by Isaiah I think I'll share that quote right now where brother ROM said Deuteronomy 18 is also the test of a prophet so again a prophet a preaching Prophet isn't judged by two or three Witnesses but a preaching Prophet his prophecies are given the test of a prophet that they come to pass brother Ram said this in the signs of his coming April 7th 1962 let's listen to the quote now now God in all ages gave the people signs bear record of it Deuteronomy 18:22 also 1331 if you want to put these scriptures down uh God gave Israel a an assured sign he said now God sends his word By His prophets is that right it's exactly what the Bible said the word of the Lord come to the prophets he said there was a test of a prophet if a prophet prophesied and that what he said come to pass then hear him but if it don't come to pass then God hasn't spoke that's all so don't don't fear Him that's right there be one among you spiritual Prophet I the Lord God will make myself know to him in Visions speak to him in dreams if it comes to pass then I that's me speaking sure God ain't going to lie you know he can't lie there's nothing in him to lie he's the Fountain of all Purity all truth is God so it can't be a lie come from God he's perfect pure so not's get into the six qualifications of a prophet and of course there could be more this is just a simple list I've come up with over the years I've used the same list of qualifications on two previous videos three Prophecies of brother William brandham and six thus sayi the Lords that have come to pass the first qualification is a thus sayith the Lord prophecy that comes to pass this is according to Deuteronomy 18: 21-22 how shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which a Lord hath not spoken but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him also James 510 tells us we must remember the prophets who have spoken to us in the name of the Lord so a new testament Prophet must foretell something in the name of the Lord and it must come to pass God's Prophet William brandom did this on at least six occasions likely many more I'll leave a link to the description of I'll leave a link in the description to this video and again remember brother Ram says this was the test of a prophet the second qualification is a prophet reveals Secrets according to Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing except he re reveal his secret unto his servants the prophets this is easily seen in prophets like Abraham Moses Isaiah Jeremiah and Ezekiel just to name a few but every Prophet was given Secrets or the mind of God to reveal to the people brother random of course revealed The Mystery of the Seven Seals and these Revelations of the Seven Seals were the seven Thunders from Revelation 10 and I have a whole video series on the Seven Seals proving brother Ram did not plagiarize them they were genuine Revelations from the Holy Ghost from the Lord Jesus Christ there's over 38 differences between brother am's Revelation on the Seven Seals from Clarence Larin and Charles Tas Russell brother random also finished the mystery of God the 12 Bible defined New Testament Mysteries six of them were spoken with thus sayith the Lord and no other preacher even comes close to this so we thank the Lord that he's given us a genuine Prophet to reveal Bible Secrets the third qualification is a Godly life with with good fruits this is found in Matthew 7:1 15-23 Jesus talks about a false prophet he said you'll know them by their fruits false prophets have corrupt fruits or sinful lives true prophets have Godly lives Paul also said a true Prophet will not abuse his power in the gospel 1 Corinthians 9:18 I make the gospel of Christ without charge that abuse not my power in the gospel so brother random lived a Godly Christian life that's undeniable he kept all the word of God another Godly fruit I like to point out is Hebrews 10:24 and 25 a true prophet of God will stay in fellowship with churches a true prophet of God will go to church so this is one proof uh brother bram's son Joseph brandham is not a prophet he does not physically gather more with the Believers as we see that day approaching a prophet of God does not take years off from physically attending church St Paul never did that brother brandham never did that and so this is a proof that brother brandham was a genuine prophet of God but his son Joseph brandham is not a prophet of God another point I want to make is that in the Old Testament prophets could be alone in the wilderness like John the Baptist or Elijah and away from the church or Saints or Believers but the New Testament we taught different New Testament Believers and Prophets and any preacher in the fivefold ministry will gather more as we see that day approaching again according to Hebrews 10:2 24-2 and brother Ram learned this lesson in standing the Gap his sermon from June 23rd 1965 brother brandom said he had made an excuse in his mind he was going to go live out in the wilderness in Colorado but the Holy Spirit corrected him and said he wasn't an Old Testament prophet he was a prophet in the apostolic form with many Apostolic gifts so God kept his Prophet from leaving the church and going out in the wilderness I'll play that quote brother brandom says he was told by the Lord but that was the Old Testament prophets you've been called to a much higher office than that in the apostolic form let's listen to the quote said your wife will go to she won't live up in them Hills like that and you'll become a bum just as the dream showed you was I said I don't want to be that but the I don't want to have to live like like that I I want to do something different but I I was told that that you'd call me to be a a prophet and I want to live in the wilderness like the prophet but I was using my own excuse so I can hunt my own good and he said but that was the prophets of the Old Testament you've been called to be that in a much higher office than that Hallelujah he said you have more gifts besides that you was called to pray for the sick and to preach the gospel and and the apostolic Farms you know of of greater things many great gifts said why do you wait for me to move you every time you move where is your reward the fourth qualification is fruit to the ministry which is Souls one this is according to 1 Corinthians 9:2 Paul says for the the Seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord so the fact Paul won their souls was proof he was an apostle we see the same thing in 1 Thessalonians 2: 19 for what is Our Hope or Joy or crown of rejoicing are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming Paul won souls in thessalonica and those Souls were his hope joy and Crown of course we know God's Prophet brother brandham won many souls for the Lord he estimated around 2 million perhaps more by the grace of God the fifth qualification is prophets are sent by God with God's word to teach it in its Purity in Galatians 1: 6-2 Paul says anyone that changes the gospel or preaches a different gospel is a curse he says it twice and Jesus also said in Matthew 24:11 many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many so God's Prophet brother brandom taught the word of God in its Purity He restored us back to the apostolic faith of the fathers according to Malachi 4: 5 and 6 one very important video was a video I put out about 10 months ago called The Bride has hundreds of differences from all other churches absolute proof we are jesus' bride in the video I show over 110 differences between the true Bible doctrines brother Bram top versus denominational or non-denominational churches who teach false Doctrine I'll leave a link in the description by the grace of God going along with this idea of prophets teach the word of God in its Purity I want to bring out this point where a prophet interprets the word of God but it's not by The Prophet's own ideas or opinions but it's by the anointing of the Holy Ghost so a prophet teaching the truth of God's word we would say it's the prophet giving the interpretation of what the word means brother Ram said the interpretation only comes to a prophet he said this in modern events are made clear by prophecy 1965 let's listen to the quote in uh Hebrews 1:1 God in sundra times wrote the Bible by his own chosen way he never wrote it by theologians neither does he interpret by theologians amen there never was a time that that the theologians ever had an interpretation of the word of God the interpretation comes only to a prophet and the only way we're ever going to get out of this mess is for God to send us that Prophet just exactly the only way it's going to be done now to balance that we must show that brother Ram said I can't interpret God's word so again this shows the interpretation doesn't come from the thoughts of the Prophet it's not the prophet who has the ability to interpret God's word the Holy Ghost anoints the prophet and tells the people what the word of God means because brother Ram said God don't need any interpreter I can't interpret his word neither can anybody interpret his word so brother Ram saying not Moses not Jeremiah not Ezekiel not Isaiah no man can interpret God's word it's God's ability God Alone can interpret his own word but then of course he reveals the interpretation to prophets who tell us what God means let's listen to this quote from when their eyes were open they knew him 1964 as I said last night God don't need any interpreter I can't interpret his word neither can anybody interpret his word he's his own interpreter when he said he'll do anything he does it that settles it that's all there is to it he said he would do it and he did it that settles it you know nobody tell this is that or that's that he does it himself our interpretations is nothing to the scripture he speaks himself that's the way it is the Sixth and final qualification is prophets are sent by God with Supernatural works and or visions from God we see this in numbers 12:6 God said if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream brother Ram had many dreams and Visions one in particular was thus say the the Lord was the preview the bride I referenced that Vision on my video about the six thus sayith the Lords that have come to pass false prophets give false visions and divinations out of the deceit of their heart according to Jeremiah 14:14 the Lord said the prophets prophesy lies in my names I sent them not neither have I commanded them neither spake unto them they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination and a thing of not and the deceit of their heart so all prophets of God will have Supernatural Works Andor Visions from God and one thing about John the Baptist he had no Miracles the Bible said that in John 10:41 and John did no Miracle but all things that John spake of this man were true but John the Baptist did see Visions according to John 1: 32 and 33 John bear records saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and in Abode upon him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon on whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God I think all these scriptures are a great place to start for how to define a new testament preaching prophet in the five-fold ministry we're so thankful the Lord Jesus Christ has sent brother William brandham as a genuine prophet of God in the fivefold ministry brother Ram stayed with the fivefold ministry he was faithful to all the these qualifications so we rejoice in that we know we're following a genuine prophet of God who is pointing us back to the absolute the Bible written and inspired by the Lord Jesus Christ perhaps in a future video I'll go through all these beautiful scriptures about prophets I made a list of them in my new Bible so I'd like to make a video on that in the future some of them I've mentioned in the last few videos about how a prophet sent from God is a sign of God's compassion upon his people so again a sign of God's love he would send us a prophet to teach us the word of God to warn us to help us to correct us to point us to the Lord Jesus Christ so we rejoice in that today if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
