[0:10] God bless you and welcome to the
[0:12] defending the message podcast I'm your
[0:14] co-host Pastor Jesse Smith and today I'm
[0:17] again hosting solo as our precious
[0:19] brother amen has had some health issues
[0:21] lately and he's scheduled to have
[0:23] surgery soon so if you would please keep
[0:25] him in prayer yesterday at church he
[0:27] testified that God was teaching him
[0:29] something through the situation so we
[0:31] rejoice in that but we also Comfort your
[0:33] prayers for our brother to return to
[0:34] complete Health by the grace of our Lord
[0:37] the topic of today's podcast is can
[0:39] people be saved outside the message
[0:42] a few days ago I put out a video about
[0:44] the Asbury Revival in Wilmore Kentucky
[0:46] and there's been a few comments about
[0:48] the Asbury Revival YouTube video it was
[0:51] released February 18 2023 so today's
[0:55] question is can people be saved outside
[0:57] the message I believe the answer is yes
[0:59] and the reason I believe that is because
[1:02] brother Branham taught that through the
[1:04] Holy Bible the scriptures and the
[1:06] scriptures he used were Ephesians 2
[1:08] verses 8 through 10 and Matthew 25
[1:10] verses 1 through 13. now of course there
[1:13] could be other scriptures but these are
[1:15] the two that are most clearly seen
[1:17] Ephesians 2 verse 8 says for by grace
[1:19] are ye saved through faith and that is
[1:21] not of yourselves it is a gift of God
[1:23] not of Works us any man should boast for
[1:26] we are his workmanship created in Christ
[1:28] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[1:30] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:31] them so according to the Bible and
[1:34] brother Branham were saved by grace
[1:35] through faith and brother Ram taught
[1:37] salvation is accompanied by three works
[1:40] of Grace justification sanctification
[1:43] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost so for
[1:45] a person to be justified or declared
[1:47] righteous a person only needs faith in
[1:50] Jesus Christ if they have faith in Jesus
[1:53] Christ they recognize Jesus Christ as
[1:55] the perpetuation of their sins Jesus's
[1:57] death on the cross paid the penalty of
[2:00] their sin debt that they owed and they
[2:02] are given Jesus's righteousness as a
[2:04] gift because all of a person's sins was
[2:07] placed upon Jesus and Jesus Paid the
[2:09] price for their sins this concept is
[2:12] clearly taught in second Corinthians 5
[2:13] 21 for he hath made him to be sin for us
[2:16] who knew no sin that we might be made
[2:19] the righteousness of God in him and of
[2:22] course this was the main message of
[2:23] Martin Luther justification by faith no
[2:27] one is saved by works brother Branham
[2:28] was not saved by works you and I are not
[2:30] saved by works we are all saved by grace
[2:33] simply repenting of our sins and
[2:36] trusting in the sacrifice of Jesus
[2:38] Christ I'd like to go through some
[2:40] quotes from Brother Branham now that
[2:41] plainly say people can be saved outside
[2:44] of his message the first quote is from
[2:46] January 1961 brother Brandon said
[2:49] trinitarianism is of the devil thus
[2:51] saith the Lord but then he says are all
[2:54] trinitarians of hell he said no sir I
[2:56] believe they are Christians so in this
[2:58] quote we see the Trinity Doctrine is a
[3:00] separate Doctrine from salvation
[3:02] Salvation is something totally different
[3:04] than the godhead Doctrine let's listen
[3:06] to the quote
[3:07] characterianism is not the devil
[3:10] I say that yes
[3:13] [Applause]
[3:15] now do you say then you believe in all
[3:17] these people as three attorneys are of
[3:19] hell no sir I believe they are
[3:22] Christians
[3:23] but the areas approaching brother were
[3:26] they are sincerely wrong
[3:29] [Applause]
[3:31] the next quote is from expectation
[3:33] February 61. brother random said a
[3:36] person is saved if he's Methodist
[3:37] Baptist Catholic if he's solemnly
[3:40] trusting in Jesus Christ for his grace
[3:42] and again he quotes Ephesians 2 verse 8.
[3:46] I believe that a person is saved if he's
[3:49] a Methodist Baptist Catholic or whatever
[3:52] he may be if he's solemnly trusting
[3:54] Jesus Christ for his grace
[3:56] but if he's the Catholic and believing
[3:59] the church saving then he's lost
[4:01] he's a Pentecost and believe in the
[4:03] church saves him he's lost but no matter
[4:06] what he is what church he goes to if he
[4:09] is solemnly depending on the blood and
[4:12] merits of Jesus Christ he's saved I
[4:14] don't care what church he's in or it's
[4:16] by faith or we say that by grace
[4:19] the next quote is from 1961 January 19th
[4:23] brother Ram said he never
[4:24] unchristianized no man or person he said
[4:27] he based if someone is saved on whether
[4:29] they're trusting in Jesus Christ whether
[4:31] they're Catholic Protestant or Jew so
[4:33] notice brother Ram says a Catholic
[4:35] Protestant or Jew could be saved
[4:45] if they're saved their trust in Jesus
[4:47] Christ where they are Catholic
[4:49] Protestant Jew or whatever they are
[4:51] you're saved because you're born of
[4:54] Christ but you've asked me a question
[4:56] in the next quote it's very similar to
[4:58] the previous quote from February 1961.
[5:01] brother Branham again quotes Ephesians 5
[5:03] verse 8 and says Catholic Protestant
[5:05] Baptist Presbyterian whatever can be
[5:07] saved because he has a personal faith in
[5:10] a finished work that Christ died for us
[5:21] [Music]
[5:22] because
[5:42] [Music]
[5:46] therefore I have never drawn a
[5:49] denominational boundary or had a barrier
[5:52] I've tried to reach out take everyone in
[5:55] my arms and brought them to the cross
[5:58] later on in this podcast from the audio
[6:00] of the YouTube video you'll hear Brother
[6:02] random say during the seals that he
[6:04] believed Catholics Protestants and even
[6:06] Jews could be saved if they're trusting
[6:08] in Jesus for salvation and that's from
[6:10] the seventh seal sermon but now we'll
[6:12] skip ahead to 1964. questions and
[6:15] answers part one brother brand was
[6:17] specifically asked can people be saved
[6:19] that don't believe his message and the
[6:21] way he preaches and he says yes if they
[6:23] believe the Lord what about the people
[6:26] that believe in the Lord now and don't
[6:30] and not the way you preach they don't
[6:33] have to believe this
[6:34] then I'd be the way I preach it see
[6:36] don't have to believe that for the last
[6:39] day message will they be saved yes
[6:42] if they believe the Lord see and if they
[6:45] if they disagree and say I don't believe
[6:47] he's a word I don't believe it this is
[6:48] right I don't believe in the baptism the
[6:50] holy ghost that shows where they're
[6:51] headed for the tribulation period but
[6:53] those who can accept the word in its
[6:55] fullness not me preaching it because
[6:57] it's a Bible say so
[6:59] those who accept that is free because it
[7:02] the word's already been judged
[7:04] not later in that same sermon from
[7:06] questions and answers part 164 brother
[7:08] Branham specifically said he sent three
[7:12] quarters of a million of his converts to
[7:13] the Assemblies of God and said he did
[7:15] not send them to death
[7:17] he said would I be a hypocrite to send
[7:19] my own children to death far be it for
[7:21] me no sir so of course brother brand
[7:23] believed his converts could be saved and
[7:25] still go to dominational churches now of
[7:27] course I know time is Advance we're 57
[7:30] years since brother Ram's passing and
[7:32] now there are message churches that
[7:34] brother Brown's converts Fellowship in
[7:35] but the scriptural truth brother brand
[7:37] new still pertain to today Ephesians 2
[7:40] verse 8 through 10 second Corinthians 5
[7:42] verse 21 Matthew 25 1-13 and as we'll
[7:46] see you soon Matthew 25 verses 31
[7:48] through 46. there is one quote that's in
[7:52] question this quote was brought up by
[7:53] one of Brothers accusers in the
[7:55] September 2020 debate that I had and he
[7:58] brought up a quote from Brother Branham
[8:00] on the anointed ones at the end time
[8:01] 1965 and brother Branham said a
[8:03] trinitarian would be lost of course I've
[8:05] heard this quote before but this quote
[8:07] goes against all the other quotes that
[8:09] you've already heard so I believe
[8:11] brother Brown was maybe overzealous at
[8:13] this point or maybe brother Brown was
[8:14] just speaking to that one individual
[8:16] he's that he was talking about in this
[8:18] story this Christian scholar who is
[8:20] denying Revelation and maybe this
[8:22] Christian scholar himself was lost but
[8:24] again in this quote brother Randolph
[8:25] says if you believe in a second or third
[8:27] person you're lost I want to point out
[8:29] brother Ram never said this with thus
[8:31] saith the Lord so I believe this is
[8:33] about Abraham's human opinion in that
[8:35] moment I believe he was overzealous
[8:37] because it goes against the previous
[8:38] quotes he'd used even from less than a
[8:41] year earlier in questions and answers
[8:43] part one and as we'll see soon this one
[8:45] quote from the anointed ones at the end
[8:47] time it goes against quotes from his
[8:49] church age book that he really least in
[8:51] December of 65 a few weeks before he
[8:53] passed away and the topic of a church
[8:55] age book could be an entire separate
[8:57] podcast or YouTube video but I believe
[9:00] the church age book was an inspired book
[9:02] not every word in the church age book
[9:04] was thus saith the Lord
[9:06] but there's a lot of solid Bible
[9:07] teaching in the church age book brother
[9:10] Brandon called it a special book he
[9:11] called it his book and he said if there
[9:14] was any light of God in a person they
[9:16] would recognize the truths that are in
[9:18] the church age book but let's first
[9:19] listen to the anointed ones at the end
[9:21] time quote
[9:22] he is the revelation of God the spirit
[9:26] of God revealed in human care
[9:34] person besides God you're alone
[9:37] except you believe that I am he you will
[9:40] die in your sins
[9:42] now the last quotes I'll read are from
[9:44] the church age book The sardisian Church
[9:46] age chapter chapter 7 and I'm just going
[9:48] to read these myself brother Ram said
[9:50] quote now we do not need to guess about
[9:51] those who in the second Resurrection are
[9:54] given life we are told is given to them
[9:56] on the grounds that they have been kind
[9:58] and good to the brethren those who are
[10:00] raised and cast in the Lake of Fire will
[10:02] be so treated because of their
[10:03] mistreatment of the Brethren since this
[10:05] is the word of God we simply accept it
[10:06] there's no argument here just a simple
[10:08] statement of fact end quote and he's
[10:10] referring to Matthew 25 verses 31-46
[10:15] about Jesus separating the sheep from
[10:17] the goats at the white Throne judgment
[10:18] and he says the saved group of people
[10:21] are not the bride
[10:23] so these are the foolish virgins as he
[10:25] also says in this quote brother Ram goes
[10:27] on to say quote now because of their
[10:28] love of the people of God they are
[10:30] recognized and saved no doubt these
[10:32] served and helped the children of God
[10:34] perhaps like Nicodemus and gameo they
[10:36] stood for the children in a time of
[10:38] trouble end quote and then a few
[10:40] paragraphs down he said quote it is the
[10:42] second Resurrection where in the five
[10:43] foolish virgins come up notice that they
[10:46] were virgins they did not have the Holy
[10:47] Spirit so they missed being in the bride
[10:50] while the five wives who had oil became
[10:52] a part of that bride but these people
[10:54] being a separated god-loving people and
[10:56] trying to abide in the word according to
[10:59] what they knew of it and being a help in
[11:01] the work of the Lord will come up at the
[11:02] end time end quote
[11:05] also there's one more quote that comes
[11:06] to mind brother Branham was a man of
[11:08] Grace he believed for and hope for the
[11:10] grace of God for people in difficult
[11:12] situations and I really appreciate
[11:15] brother Branham for that that's the kind
[11:16] of Minister I want to be as well I never
[11:19] want to compromise on the word of God
[11:20] just like I believe brother Branham did
[11:22] not compromise in the word of God but we
[11:24] want to hope for grace and the quote I'm
[11:26] referring to is from questions and
[11:28] answers part 2 1964. it's question 316.
[11:31] brother Brandon was asked if a man has
[11:33] been married and divorced is that man in
[11:36] his second wife married in God's sight
[11:38] and how can both or one of them be in
[11:40] the rapture
[11:41] brother Ram's answer is very gracious he
[11:44] said it kills me to say that because he
[11:46] said adulterers will not enter the
[11:48] kingdom of God and I want to play the
[11:50] part where brother Brown said there
[11:51] might be a chance of you getting in
[11:53] brother Ram tried to encourage this
[11:55] couple that was living in adultery that
[11:57] God may let them in the Rapture now the
[12:00] Bible is clear only those with the
[12:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost the oil
[12:03] mentioned in the parable of the wise and
[12:05] foolish virgins will go in the Rapture
[12:07] but brother Branham is a man of Grace
[12:09] and he's trying to give them hope to
[12:10] keep serving Jesus Christ live as pure
[12:12] as you can and he says there might be a
[12:14] chance so let's listen to the quote
[12:16] don't don't leave them with children
[12:18] without a home and things like that God
[12:20] has made restitutions and places for
[12:22] people at at uh did things wrong you
[12:26] remember Jesus said David when he was
[12:29] hungry he entered into the temple of God
[12:31] and eats a shoe bread which is only
[12:33] lawful for the priest and it's found
[12:34] blameless
[12:35] a priest also blasphemed the Sabbath
[12:38] upon the Sabbath day and are found
[12:39] blameless and a greater
[12:42] than the Sabbath was here they there uh
[12:45] let's just leave it up to God go ahead
[12:47] and just live the way you just live for
[12:49] Christ now let's see there might be a
[12:51] chance of you getting in don't make do
[12:54] wrongs don't ever writing one just go
[12:56] and live the way you are if you're if
[12:58] you're happy together you might I had
[13:00] the wrong companion I say this one thing
[13:02] if you got the wrong companion this way
[13:04] this life you'll never have it in the
[13:07] other one
[13:08] so please don't misunderstand me I'm not
[13:11] saying adulterers can go in the Rapture
[13:12] I'm just letting you know brother
[13:14] Branham said there might be a chance of
[13:16] adulterers getting in and this shows
[13:18] brother Brown was a man of Grace he
[13:20] believed people in denominations could
[13:21] be saved Catholics Methodist Baptists
[13:24] lutherans even Jews and he said there
[13:26] might even be a chance adulterers could
[13:28] go in the rapture
[13:34] before ending this first part of the
[13:36] podcast I want to look at two comments I
[13:38] had on YouTube the first comment was
[13:40] kind but it criticized me and said the
[13:43] Asbury Revival preaching wasn't
[13:44] preaching the way of Holiness but I
[13:47] would disagree to one extent because if
[13:50] the Asbury Revival is preaching
[13:52] justification by faith that is the first
[13:54] step in the way of Holiness because
[13:56] there's three steps in the way of
[13:57] Holiness justification sanctification
[13:59] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost now of
[14:02] course not every person in the Asbury
[14:04] Revival and all the other related
[14:06] revivals are getting saved Jesus said
[14:08] only few will find the narrow road that
[14:10] leads to life but I do believe there is
[14:12] a possibility people in that Revival
[14:15] could be getting saved and it will be
[14:17] based upon Ephesians 2 verses 8 through
[14:19] 10 and second Corinthians 5 verse 19
[14:22] along with all the other scriptures
[14:23] about justification by faith the fact is
[14:26] people don't recognize there's at least
[14:28] six kinds of revivals as I put on the
[14:29] video so the only Revival that could be
[14:31] going on at the Asbury Revival is the
[14:33] Revival of the human Spirit or mind and
[14:36] that's what Ezekiel called a new heart
[14:37] because he said there's three works for
[14:39] the baptism of the Holy Ghost a new
[14:42] heart a new spirit and my spirit the new
[14:44] heart is justification
[14:46] hopefully people at the Asbury Revival
[14:48] are getting a new heart to love Jesus
[14:50] Christ
[14:51] some of them will go a little bit
[14:52] further and get a portion of the new
[14:54] spirit since the Asbury College is a
[14:57] Wesleyan College they will accept some
[14:59] level of sanctification if they're
[15:01] sincere but without the message God gave
[15:03] to brother Branham they'll never get to
[15:04] the third step God's spirit or the
[15:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul
[15:09] and the second YouTube comment
[15:10] criticized me said I was off the mark
[15:13] But I disagreed of course and I
[15:15] recognize of course Judas is scared did
[15:17] Miracles so Miracles are not proof of a
[15:19] genuine Revival and again not every
[15:21] person in the Revival is likely getting
[15:23] saved like Jesus said probably only a
[15:26] few are getting saved and in this
[15:27] comment the person criticized me and
[15:29] said a person could not get Justified
[15:31] under a trinity Doctrine but in my reply
[15:34] I said the Trinity Doctrine is a
[15:36] different Doctrine it's a separate
[15:37] Doctrine than the doctrine of
[15:39] justification so these are two separate
[15:41] doctrines as long as people are hearing
[15:43] the doctrine of justification at the
[15:45] Revival they could be getting saved if
[15:48] they accept it and I use the quote where
[15:49] brother Ram said trinitarians can be
[15:51] saved he said quote I believe they are
[15:53] Christians end quote so I told the
[15:55] brother I'm going to believe brother
[15:57] Branham rather than you and then I left
[15:58] this brother with numerous quotes that
[16:00] I've already played on this podcast
[16:04] foreign
[16:07] of this portion of the podcast next
[16:10] you'll hear me play the audio from the
[16:12] YouTube video The Asbury Revival a
[16:14] message believer's response plus six
[16:16] kinds of Revival and by God's grace we
[16:18] have so many topics I want to get to I
[16:20] just don't have enough time for it I'm
[16:22] hoping brother amen can join me again
[16:24] soon when his health improves if you
[16:27] follow my blog posts I'd like to do a
[16:30] YouTube video about are you the message
[16:32] and of course we are not the message
[16:33] we're receivers of the message but we're
[16:36] carriers of the message
[16:38] and were one with a message with our
[16:40] souls by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[16:42] another topic I'd like to look at is
[16:44] racism
[16:45] the racism accusation against brother
[16:47] Branham of course it's a false
[16:49] accusation I've been studying on that
[16:51] and I have a list of almost 40 topics
[16:53] I'd like to cover so I want to quickly
[16:55] get out this podcast I hope it's a
[16:56] blessing to you and now here's the audio
[16:58] from the Asbury Revival video
[17:07] I agree disagree with the Baptist but
[17:10] the Presbyterians and their systems but
[17:13] in there there's genuine Christians
[17:19] greetings friends in the mattress name
[17:21] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:24] purpose of this video is to answer a
[17:26] viewer's question about the Asbury
[17:29] Revival that's going on in Wilmore
[17:31] Kentucky so as message believers who
[17:34] follow the bible-based revelations that
[17:36] God gave to his Prophet William Branham
[17:38] what should be our reaction to this
[17:41] so-called Revival
[17:43] by God's grace our reaction should be to
[17:45] examine it by the word of God and hope
[17:48] that some people are genuinely getting
[17:50] saved which means justified by the Holy
[17:53] Ghost and hopefully by God's grace some
[17:55] are getting partial sanctification by
[17:58] the Holy Ghost as well which we'll
[18:00] explain in this short video
[18:03] I'll begin with what is the Revival
[18:06] and what is it producing
[18:08] on February 8th of this year 2023 at a
[18:12] chapel service at the University of
[18:15] Asbury in Wilmore Kentucky college
[18:17] students stayed after the service and
[18:19] kept worshiping and apparently seeking
[18:22] God and praying repenting of sins and
[18:25] this service has never stopped it's been
[18:27] ongoing for about 11 days if I'm not
[18:29] mistaken by the grace of God there's
[18:32] lots of videos online that you can see
[18:35] about this revival there's testimonies
[18:37] of people repenting of their sins
[18:38] there's also testimonies of physical
[18:41] healings there's lots of worship and
[18:43] praise going on and it's possible that
[18:46] even one demon was cast out in these
[18:48] meetings now if these are genuine works
[18:51] of the Holy Spirit then as a message
[18:52] believer I would Rejoice if people are
[18:55] genuinely getting saved repenting of
[18:57] their sin drawing closer to God and if a
[19:00] demon was cast out I would rejoice in
[19:02] that as well remember friends even David
[19:04] cast out demons out of Saul in the Old
[19:07] Testament and while Jesus was on Earth
[19:09] remember there was a man who was not
[19:11] following Jesus that was casting out
[19:13] devils and Jesus let him keep casting
[19:15] out devils and said he that is not
[19:18] against us is for us
[19:20] so I have not physically attended the
[19:22] Asbury Revival I live about six hours
[19:24] north of Wilmore
[19:27] but now let's look at what is Revival
[19:29] according to the Greek definition in the
[19:31] New Testament Revival has at least two
[19:33] meanings the first is to live again as
[19:36] in Jesus's resurrection
[19:38] so this is a physical Revival from the
[19:40] dead
[19:41] the second definition is probably what
[19:43] defines the Asbury Revival it's to be
[19:46] restored to a correct life of one who
[19:49] returns to a better moral State and it
[19:52] can also mean to regain strength and
[19:54] vigor so the second definition is
[19:56] probably what's going on at Asbury if
[19:59] indeed people are getting a genuine Holy
[20:01] Ghost Revival what's happening is
[20:03] college students or even adults are
[20:05] getting restored to a correct life they
[20:08] probably heard about Jesus maybe they've
[20:10] claimed to believe in Jesus Through the
[20:13] anointing of the Holy Spirit and the
[20:15] worship going on perhaps some of them
[20:16] are repenting of their sins that they
[20:18] know are wrong and trying to live a
[20:19] correct Life Again by the grace of God
[20:21] perhaps some of the college students and
[20:23] adults had been weakened in their faith
[20:26] and now in this group worship they're
[20:29] finding strength maybe they're finding
[20:31] the joy of the Lord after repenting of
[20:32] their sins
[20:34] now what's interesting about this
[20:35] revival is that I'd been preaching on
[20:37] the Azusa Street Revival
[20:39] since January 29th so a little over a
[20:42] week before this revival broke out in
[20:44] Asbury
[20:45] and brother Branham said the Azusa
[20:47] Street Revival was the greatest Revival
[20:49] or outpouring of the Holy Ghost since
[20:52] the day of Pentecost so let's listen to
[20:53] the quote
[20:58] a man in California
[21:02] a negro
[21:04] one crossed out
[21:06] give him the experience of the baptism
[21:09] of the Holy Ghost from there formed
[21:12] Azusa Street
[21:13] the old Azusa Street Mission
[21:15] from our scattered to a sweat the whole
[21:18] nation
[21:19] from Nation went to Nation after Nations
[21:27] God had provided for them
[21:31] one of the greatest revivals that this
[21:34] nation has ever known I don't care what
[21:37] it was
[21:38] there's never been a Revival like the
[21:40] Pentecostal Revival
[21:42] right
[21:44] Wesley never had none of him
[21:48] virgin Calvin Knox great reformers but
[21:51] they never had to revive like the
[21:53] Pentecostal reminder the greatest thing
[21:56] is struck the Earth since the Holy Ghost
[21:58] fell on the day of Pentecost
[22:02] also I think it's important to show that
[22:03] through the study of scripture I found
[22:05] at least six types of Revival I have a
[22:08] video about this but at that point I
[22:10] only had recognized four of the types of
[22:12] Revival but now I believe they're six by
[22:14] God's grace so let's go through these as
[22:17] we go through these six type of revivals
[22:19] we'll be able to see what kind of
[22:20] Revival may be happening in Asbury
[22:23] the first type of Revival is National
[22:25] Revival
[22:27] and of course this is not happening in
[22:29] the United States brother random said
[22:30] it's thus saith the Lord the United
[22:32] States will never have a national
[22:33] Revival the Bible does record National
[22:36] revivals for Israel of course in the
[22:38] days of David Solomon when the Queen of
[22:40] Sheba visited she'd never seen such a
[22:43] Revival like that Revival and brother
[22:44] Branham said it was because all the
[22:46] people rallied around Solomon's gift of
[22:49] course I was a short-lived Revival
[22:50] because Solomon fell away from his
[22:52] wisdom and built Alters unto every false
[22:56] god of his thousand wives but also in
[22:59] the days of Hezekiah
[23:01] there's great Revival which is recorded
[23:03] in Second Kings 18. they tore down all
[23:06] the high places or worship of false
[23:07] Idols they crushed all the physical
[23:09] idols and they restored the house of God
[23:13] also you see a Revival in the days of
[23:15] Josiah in second chronicles 34. they
[23:18] found the word of God they rent their
[23:19] clothes because they were so ashamed of
[23:21] all the sins they'd been committing but
[23:23] the word of God they read impacted them
[23:26] and they repented their sins and started
[23:28] keeping the Commandments of God
[23:31] the second type of Revival is a church
[23:33] age Revival and of course this is the
[23:35] Revival that started in 1906 for the
[23:38] laodicean church age through William
[23:40] Seymour whom brother Brandon spoke very
[23:43] highly of
[23:44] and Friends history says that as the
[23:47] Azusa Street Revival went on Seymour
[23:49] realized tongues were not the evidence
[23:51] of the Holy Ghost Seymour realized that
[23:54] the Divine love of Jesus Christ was the
[23:55] evidence and that lines up with what
[23:57] brother random said as well because God
[23:59] is love
[24:00] when God comes into your soul and abides
[24:03] there permanently that's the baptism of
[24:04] the Holy Ghost and that will produce all
[24:06] the fruits of the spirit that will help
[24:08] you believe and receive the message of
[24:10] your hour
[24:11] so it's likely Asbury is not getting the
[24:14] church age Revival unless they go all
[24:16] the way on to the baptism of the Holy
[24:18] Ghost
[24:19] the third type of Revival is the latter
[24:21] rain Revival
[24:23] this is spoken of at James 5 verse 7 the
[24:26] early and the latter rain we know
[24:28] brother Adam's Ministry was the early
[24:29] Reign the teaching rain and we know
[24:31] rapturing faith is the latter rain so it
[24:34] does not appear that the Asbury Revival
[24:36] is the lateran Revival because that will
[24:38] be falling upon the Bride of Jesus
[24:40] Christ who believes all the Bible
[24:42] revelations
[24:43] that God gave to his Prophet brother
[24:45] Branham
[24:46] the fourth type of Revival is the Soul
[24:48] Revival this is a personal one-time
[24:50] Revival of the Soul or this is called
[24:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[24:55] it's unlikely Asbury students and
[24:58] faculty are receiving this four type
[25:01] Revival and here's the proof of that
[25:03] recently I made a video about milk
[25:06] Christianity versus me Christianity from
[25:08] Hebrews chapter 5 verses 10 through
[25:11] chapter 6 verse 3. and as you can see on
[25:15] your screen here six beginning or
[25:17] Elementary doctrines a Christian has to
[25:19] receive before they can move on to
[25:21] Perfection which is the baptism of the
[25:23] Holy Ghost
[25:24] so the first one is repentance from dead
[25:26] works
[25:28] hopefully some people at the Asbury
[25:30] Revival are repenting of their sins but
[25:33] how many will repent of all their dead
[25:35] work such as watching porn watching
[25:37] dirty movies watching sports how many
[25:40] will put on Modest clothes on some of
[25:43] the videos I saw girls in shorts and of
[25:45] course they're revealing their thighs
[25:47] and thighs our nakedness according to
[25:49] Isaiah chapter 47 I saw girls with short
[25:53] hair and a woman who cuts her hair is a
[25:55] dishonor to her husband if she's married
[25:58] or it's a dishonor to her father if
[26:01] she's single so we don't really know the
[26:04] depths of repentance that those at
[26:06] Asbury are actually receiving and
[26:09] pressing into
[26:10] second Faith towards God
[26:14] are those who are getting Revival in
[26:15] Asbury is there faith in God or the word
[26:19] the word of this hour
[26:21] the mysteries of God being finished
[26:24] justification entire sanctification and
[26:26] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[26:29] third do they have the doctrine of
[26:31] baptisms do they know there's a lord
[26:33] Jesus Christ water baptism and a soul
[26:36] baptism the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[26:38] it's likely they don't
[26:41] on the statement of faith website for
[26:44] Asbury University they State they are
[26:47] trinitarians so we plainly know they
[26:50] don't have the correct water baptism
[26:52] that's a shame but will they have such a
[26:55] Revival where they press into the things
[26:56] of God in order to understand the
[26:59] doctrine of baptisms only time will tell
[27:03] fourth laying on of hands
[27:05] do they recognize the power of laying on
[27:07] hands praying for the sick casting out
[27:10] Devils it seems they may have some
[27:12] understanding of this
[27:14] if indeed a woman did get a devil cast
[27:17] out of her
[27:18] but then the question arises will that
[27:21] woman who was set free will she clean
[27:22] out her house as Jesus taught in Matthew
[27:24] chapter 12 and fill it with the Holy
[27:26] Ghost so more demons don't come in
[27:30] fifth resurrection of the Dead
[27:33] do they have the understanding that
[27:35] there's two resurrections and not just
[27:37] one there's a Rapture Resurrection which
[27:39] is called the first resurrection and
[27:41] then there's the resurrection of the
[27:42] Dead to the white Throne judgment
[27:45] and six and finally Eternal judgment
[27:49] friends it's unlikely they understand
[27:51] that hell is not eternal
[27:54] Asbury University is a Wesleyan
[27:56] University
[27:58] so they follow some of the teachings of
[28:00] God's messenger John Wesley but of
[28:01] course not all
[28:03] do they believe that hell is not Eternal
[28:05] as the Bible says or do they believe
[28:08] that Sinners will burn eternally and of
[28:11] course we know Sinners cannot burn
[28:12] eternally because they do not have
[28:14] eternal life
[28:15] moving on to the fifth type of Revival
[28:17] this is the Revival in the human Spirit
[28:19] which Paul says it is a transformation
[28:22] of the Mind in Romans 12. and he says in
[28:25] the book of Ephesians that were to be
[28:28] renewed day by day
[28:30] so this is the daily Revival of the
[28:31] human Spirit now I believe this is the
[28:34] type of Revival some people are probably
[28:36] experiencing it Asbury they let their
[28:39] minds get focused on the things of the
[28:40] world maybe politics or as we said
[28:43] Wicked sins like pornography or maybe
[28:46] the NFL or NBA worldly things worldly
[28:49] music money riches cares of this life
[28:53] and they've realized they've sinned and
[28:55] so they're coming to God they're drawing
[28:57] night to God and regaining strength in
[29:00] their human mind to focus on things of
[29:02] God more often than the things of the
[29:04] world so to me that's likely the Revival
[29:07] that they're having at Asbury
[29:09] they're getting their minds more focused
[29:11] on God but again that doesn't mean their
[29:13] souls are baptized with the Holy Ghost
[29:15] because they've got to be justified
[29:17] saved Sanctified and this is the step
[29:20] most of them are probably lacking living
[29:22] a full Sanctified life and then having
[29:25] their souls baptized with the Holy Ghost
[29:27] and the sixth type of Revival is the
[29:29] physical Revival like Jesus's body was
[29:31] revived at his resurrection
[29:34] this was in Romans 14 verse 9 for to
[29:37] this end Christ both died and Rose and
[29:40] revived
[29:41] and also we wonder what will this
[29:43] revival eventually produce well it's my
[29:46] guess it'll probably produce the same
[29:48] thing that the 1970 Asbury Revival
[29:51] produced so this University had a
[29:54] Revival in 1970 about 52 or 53 years ago
[29:58] and there's videos about it I watched
[30:00] some of them on YouTube and It produced
[30:02] justification for people people claim to
[30:04] get saved and some level of
[30:06] sanctification now some of the people
[30:09] they interviewed were men and women some
[30:11] of the men went into full-time preaching
[30:13] Ministry or became missionaries for the
[30:15] Wesleyan Church or the Methodist Church
[30:18] which is good but we know that's not the
[30:20] full word of God that's not a full
[30:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost message
[30:25] and of course there were women that got
[30:26] saved and they testified and on the
[30:28] videos they had makeup on they had cut
[30:30] hair they were wearing pants so again
[30:32] the 1970 Revival didn't produce a fully
[30:36] Sanctified and cleaned out life so it's
[30:39] my guess that this current Asbury
[30:41] Revival will probably produce the same
[30:43] thing and again I'm not criticizing
[30:45] these individuals but I'm examining all
[30:48] of their lives according to the full
[30:50] revealed word of God which God promised
[30:52] to do in Revelation 10 verse 7 finish
[30:54] the mystery of God Jesus said in Matthew
[30:57] 17 11 Elijah would become and restore
[31:00] all things so he's restored modesty he's
[31:02] restored Holiness he's restored entire
[31:05] sanctification
[31:06] Saints I believe this revival is also
[31:09] this generation's chance to receive the
[31:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost as brother
[31:13] Branham said each generation gets a shot
[31:15] at receiving the word of God and it
[31:18] reminds me of Matthew 25 with the
[31:20] parable of the wise and foolish virgins
[31:22] both virgins get the wake-up call in
[31:25] every generation to receive the holy
[31:27] ghost or not so I believe this is this
[31:29] generation's opportunity they're in
[31:31] Asbury to get Justified Sanctified and
[31:34] go all the way to the Holy Ghost
[31:36] it's my humble opinion if they stay at
[31:38] that University they probably won't get
[31:39] the full baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[31:41] by God's grace some of them will be
[31:43] justified and partially Sanctified and
[31:45] if those are genuine experiences and
[31:47] they keep those experiences I believe
[31:48] they'll be saved friends I do believe
[31:50] the Asbury people can be saved just like
[31:53] the type of the wise and foolish virgins
[31:56] Abraham was the separated holy
[31:58] ghost-filled type he was separated unto
[32:00] God lot was the type of the foolish
[32:02] virgin closely associated with things of
[32:04] the world and yet the Bible called him a
[32:06] righteous soul in second Peter chapter
[32:08] two so we have wise Christians and we
[32:10] have foolish Christians are the Asbury
[32:12] Christians are they wise enough to
[32:14] repent of watching the Super Bowl the
[32:16] wicked halftime show the filthy
[32:18] commercials are they willing to delete
[32:20] all their worldly music and stop
[32:22] watching filthy movies are they ready to
[32:24] pray and fast for the baptism of the
[32:26] Holy Ghost are they ready to pay tithes
[32:28] and offerings are they ready to gather
[32:30] more with Saints as they see that day
[32:32] approaching are they willing to dress
[32:34] modestly and live holy unto the Lord
[32:37] and Friends brother Brandon believed
[32:39] denominational people could be saved as
[32:42] long as they were sincerely trusting in
[32:44] the blood of Jesus Christ in the seventh
[32:46] seal sermon brother Branham said any
[32:48] individual Catholic Jewish or whatever
[32:51] it might be Methodist Baptist
[32:53] Presbyterian any organization God has
[32:56] children sitting out in there so brother
[32:58] Ram said plainly God has children this
[33:02] must mean foolish virgins out there in
[33:04] the Catholic Church the Jewish Church
[33:06] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[33:08] any questions and answers part 1 1964
[33:11] brother Rams said he sent three quarters
[33:14] of a million of his converts to the
[33:15] Assembly of God Church he said he's not
[33:18] against the people he's against every
[33:20] system that separates men and then he
[33:22] said he'd be a hypocrite to send his own
[33:24] children to death so he was telling the
[33:26] people the Assemblies of God is Not
[33:28] death there are some people that are
[33:30] saved in there and then in part two he
[33:33] said the same thing I disagree with the
[33:35] Assemblies of God but there's a many
[33:37] Assembly of God man that's a precious
[33:39] brother
[33:40] I disagree with Oneness Doctrine but but
[33:42] there's a many of those men are precious
[33:44] men I disagree with the Baptists with
[33:47] the Presbyterians and their systems but
[33:49] in there there's genuine Christians so I
[33:51] would say the same thing for the asper
[33:53] Revival there's probably genuine
[33:55] Christians in there but remember Jesus
[33:57] said few there be that find it and the
[33:59] same thing applies to message churches
[34:01] few there be that find the narrow road
[34:03] that leads to life
[34:04] in closing
[34:07] friends I hope this short video has been
[34:09] a help to you if you've been wondering
[34:10] about the Asbury Revival or just
[34:12] revivals in general
[34:14] again I've been praying for Revival this
[34:16] year for myself and our local church
[34:19] which is what we should all be praying
[34:21] for according to Saint Paul but
[34:23] ultimately friends we should be praying
[34:24] for the latter rain Revival again found
[34:26] in the book of James and brother Brown
[34:28] said the latter rain is rapturing faith
[34:31] we're looking for that final Revival the
[34:33] bride's Revival where God pours out
[34:35] rapturing Grace upon the Saints so their
[34:38] bodies can be changed in a moment and
[34:40] twinkling of an eye of course no man
[34:42] knows the day or the hour of the rapture
[34:45] but the Bible says we know the seasons
[34:47] of The Rapture in first Thessalonians
[34:48] chapter 5. so may each one of us seek
[34:51] daily Revival for our minds if we're not
[34:53] born again may we seek that one Revival
[34:56] of the soul the baptism of the Holy
[34:58] Ghost the Sea of the Holy Ghost and may
[35:00] we press toward the mark of the High
[35:02] Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[35:04] friends this is our opportunity in our
[35:07] generation to receive the Revival that
[35:09] we need as message Believers we want the
[35:12] Revival in our souls the baptism of the
[35:14] Holy Ghost so we'll be the wise virgins
[35:16] and ready to meet Jesus at his appearing
[35:20] if you have any questions concerns or
[35:22] testimonies about this video please
[35:24] contact me
[35:25] [Music]
[35:31] God bless you friends as the Holy Ghost
[35:33] anoints you to defend the Gospel of
[35:35] Jesus Christ as Paul also said in
[35:38] Philippians 1 verse 17 he said knowing
[35:40] that I am set for the defense of the
[35:42] Gospel
[35:48] of Jesus Christ
[35:50] to bring the Good Tidings the good news
[35:53] that Jesus
[35:58] read Jesus
[36:03] that never say
