[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] you let me talk to a man two minutes I
[0:05] can tell you whether he's received the
[0:06] Holy Ghost or not so can
[0:10] you greetings friends in the matchless
[0:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:15] purpose of this video is to do a part
[0:17] two on the question how far can a
[0:20] Christian fall into sin I want to
[0:22] appreciate all the feedback from part
[0:25] one of this video and I hope this video
[0:27] is a blessing as well by God's grace
[0:30] friends I'm Jesse Smith I'm Pastor bride
[0:31] of Christ Fellowship I pastored here in
[0:33] akan Ohio for about 17 years and I
[0:36] defend the Bible revelations that Jesus
[0:38] Christ revealed to his Prophet his
[0:40] genuine Prophet brother William brandham
[0:42] and also defend brother branham's Godly
[0:44] Christian
[0:45] character so the outline for this video
[0:48] is basically I'll go over points about
[0:50] the wise virgin and how the wise virgin
[0:53] has battles with sin but will not commit
[0:55] major sins and then I'll go through a
[0:58] few more important points from the past
[1:01] video so let's start with the wise
[1:03] virgin I want to start with another list
[1:05] of major sins uh located in Revelation
[1:08] 21: 7 and 8 the Bible says he that
[1:12] overcometh shall inherit all things and
[1:13] I will be his God and he shall be my son
[1:16] but the fearful and unbelieving and the
[1:18] Abominable and murderers and hor mongers
[1:20] and Sorcerers and idolators and all
[1:23] liars shall have their part in the lake
[1:24] which burneth with fire and brimstone
[1:27] which is the second death so I love how
[1:29] this verse 8 lists all the sins but in
[1:32] the previous verse I love how it says
[1:34] the Overcomers inherit all things and
[1:36] these are some of the things the
[1:37] Overcomers overcame like the example
[1:40] with brother brandom from part one
[1:41] brother brandom lied to the IRS right
[1:44] but brother randam overcame Lying by the
[1:46] grace of God as a holy ghost filled
[1:48] Christian of course he overcame it he
[1:49] had power within him to do that cuz
[1:52] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:53] that's in the world think of Mary
[1:55] Magdalene it's believed by history she
[1:57] was a hormonger or a prostitute but Look
[2:00] what Jesus did for her Jesus forgave her
[2:02] cast seven demons out of her she was
[2:04] there on the day of Pentecost she was
[2:06] the first one to see Jesus raised from
[2:07] the dead and murderers how many people
[2:10] did Paul agree to see murdered we know
[2:13] at least one Steven the Bible said he
[2:15] put all these people in jail and even
[2:17] blasphemed against Jesus but yet he was
[2:19] forgiven he was an overcomer by the
[2:21] grace of God Almighty so friends we're
[2:24] Overcomers by the blood of the Lamb
[2:26] right and the word of Our Testimony from
[2:28] Revelation 12 even as New Testament
[2:30] Believers despite our sins our minor
[2:33] sins as wise virgins we still have to
[2:36] remember all these wonderful scriptures
[2:38] about the Power in the Blood of Jesus
[2:40] Christ let's read through some verses
[2:42] like Colossians 1 13 and 14 who have
[2:46] delivered us from the power of darkness
[2:47] and has translated us into the kingdom
[2:49] of his dear son in whom we have
[2:51] Redemption through his blood even the
[2:53] Forgiveness of sins so the blood of
[2:55] Jesus Christ has forgiven all of our
[2:57] sins the Bible said when Jesus died he
[3:00] paid for the sins of the whole world and
[3:01] that had to been past present and future
[3:04] so Jesus Christ has paid for all of our
[3:06] sins we just have to confess them by the
[3:08] grace of God then Colossians 1:22 says
[3:12] he's able to present you holy and
[3:14] unblamable and unreprovable in his sight
[3:17] unblamable you cannot be blamed on the
[3:20] day of judgment because of the blood of
[3:21] Jesus Christ brother ran won't be blamed
[3:24] for his lie to the IRS because the blood
[3:26] of Jesus Christ forgave him of that and
[3:28] that's because Colossians 2 13 said he's
[3:31] forgiving you all your trespasses praise
[3:35] the Lord every trespass is forgiven by
[3:38] the blood of Jesus Christ no wonder it's
[3:40] called The Gospel good news and here we
[3:43] get into this wonderful truth even in
[3:44] the Old Testament that in heaven God
[3:47] already recognizes us as his children as
[3:49] his sons as perfect spotless Before the
[3:53] Throne of God but on Earth we still need
[3:55] chasen during our lifetime we need
[3:56] rebuked by the grace of God we see this
[3:59] in job chap 1 and 2 in job chapters 1
[4:02] and 2 God tells Satan that job is
[4:04] perfect and he excus evil God has a
[4:07] testimony meeting he invites Satan and
[4:09] he brags on his servant job by the grace
[4:11] of God but then on Earth job goes
[4:14] through tests and trials and job even
[4:17] exalted himself above God and God
[4:19] confirmed that in job
[4:22] 40:8 God told job that he had Justified
[4:25] himself more than him God we also see
[4:28] this truth of God rebuking job in Job 38
[4:32] 1-3 God comes down to answer job's
[4:35] questions and God says who is this so in
[4:38] heaven God is telling the devil here's
[4:40] job here's job but because job's
[4:43] struggling on Earth God comes down and
[4:44] says who are you to keep him humble to
[4:46] rebuke him while he's in this pest house
[4:49] this body of death the Bible calls it
[4:52] and the Bible said God rebukes all he
[4:53] loves like in Revelation 3: 19 so we
[4:56] must accept the rebuke of the Holy Ghost
[4:59] confess our sins and walk in the light
[5:01] as he's in the light and remember
[5:04] friends Abraham and Isaac lied as well
[5:07] so we think of that example of brother
[5:08] brand lying prophets can lie prophets
[5:10] can make mistakes but they are forgiven
[5:12] by the blood of their sacrifice for us
[5:14] it's the blood of Jesus Christ here in
[5:16] the New Testament remember friends the
[5:18] Bible says in Ephesians we're already
[5:20] accepted in the Beloved first John says
[5:22] we are now the sons of God the book of
[5:25] Romans is so beautiful we've been
[5:27] preaching on that lately but Romans 8 is
[5:28] so powerful starts off in verse one by
[5:30] saying there's no condemnation to us and
[5:33] then the chapter 8 Ends by saying
[5:35] nothing can separate us from the love of
[5:37] God so we have no condemnation and we
[5:40] have no separation from God's love in
[5:42] the middle of the chapter we also hear
[5:44] that all things work together for our
[5:46] good that we're predestinated to be in
[5:48] the image of Jesus Christ that if God is
[5:50] for us who can be against us and no man
[5:53] can lay any charge to our account
[5:55] because it's God who justifies us again
[5:58] thank God for the Amazing Grace that
[6:00] he's given to us the next idea comes out
[6:02] of uh Romans 7:17 I mentioned this verse
[6:05] in part one where Paul said it's not I
[6:08] that sin but sin that dwelleth within me
[6:10] we see the same idea in 1 John
[6:13] 3:9 the Bible said whosoever is born of
[6:15] God doth not commit sin for his seed
[6:18] remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[6:21] because he's born of God so here we're
[6:23] taught that a wise virgin who's Born
[6:25] Again In The Soul cannot sin and yet
[6:28] Paul says he sins and brother Ram says
[6:30] we sin every day so how do we understand
[6:32] this well we break it down because each
[6:34] person has three parts a body a spirit
[6:38] or mind and a soul and of course the New
[6:41] Testament is about the birth in the soul
[6:43] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[6:45] soul so we get this beautiful truth that
[6:47] once a person's born again that seed of
[6:50] God the holy spirit inside of them
[6:51] cannot sin and can never sin what sins
[6:55] is the sin nature In the Flesh and also
[6:58] the sinful thoughts in the
[7:01] mind so this is how we understand God
[7:03] sees us as perfect in Heaven by the
[7:06] grace of God we have a perfect sacrifice
[7:07] the blood of Jesus Christ and also we
[7:10] have a theophany body there in heaven
[7:11] the Bible says according to 2
[7:13] Corinthians 5:
[7:14] 1-5 and then inside of us we have a seat
[7:17] of God that never sin to begin with so
[7:20] this is the beauty again of the Gospel
[7:22] of Jesus Christ and the glory of being a
[7:24] wise virgin who's baptized with the Holy
[7:26] Ghost the next point is about complexes
[7:29] again I believe the main sin Holy Ghost
[7:31] filled Christians will battle with is
[7:33] complexes found in 2 Corinthians 104 and
[7:36] 5 they're called strongholds but brother
[7:38] Bram said a lot of Christians have them
[7:41] in other words they have a lot of Mind
[7:42] battles brother Ram says that in the
[7:44] flashing red light of of the sign of his
[7:46] coming in
[7:47] 1963 brother Ram said I guess if I'd
[7:50] asked tonight in this audience homon in
[7:51] here knows you have a complex
[7:53] practically every hand would go up and
[7:55] then he asks them he says look at there
[7:57] so brother ROM realized even mature Holy
[8:00] Ghost filled Christians can have mind
[8:02] battles and that's where Satan works on
[8:03] them the hardest right the greatest
[8:05] battle ever fall is in the mind let's
[8:07] listen to the quote because I had I was
[8:11] making My Confession of having complex
[8:13] and I guess if I asked tonight in this
[8:16] audience of people how many in your NOS
[8:18] you have complex practically every hand
[8:20] will go up that you might know brother
[8:22] way just let me show you where this
[8:23] discernment not how many knows that you
[8:25] got a complex raise your hand look at
[8:28] there but uh I don't know if that shock
[8:32] of me saying that to brother wayy taking
[8:35] it like I might be rebuking him or
[8:37] something then it uh he fell into this
[8:40] condition and the Lord Jesus brought him
[8:42] back now friends understanding this
[8:45] truth that will battle complexes we're
[8:47] going to battle complexes in these three
[8:49] areas the lust of the eyes lust of the
[8:52] Flesh and the pride of life in part one
[8:54] I talked about that a lot even Holy
[8:57] Ghost filed Christians can battle the
[8:58] lust of the eyes that's why brother BR
[9:01] had to hang a cross in his car to get
[9:03] his eyes off any immorally dressed woman
[9:07] I talked about then the pride of life
[9:08] how a lot of preachers say call
[9:10] themselves the goats the greatest
[9:11] preachers of all time on both the
[9:14] five-fold side and also the tape worship
[9:16] side the one I left out I want to
[9:18] mention was the lust of the flesh now
[9:21] I've heard at least two preachers say
[9:23] they battle this area they overeat they
[9:26] get nervous and they overeat or they
[9:28] travel a lot and they overeat they eat
[9:30] unhealthy Foods so that's something I
[9:32] want to bring out as well that you can
[9:34] have a real Holy Ghost filled preacher
[9:37] but his battle might be with the lust of
[9:39] the Flesh and he might overeat he might
[9:42] get distracted with the cares of this
[9:44] life too much because one of our battles
[9:47] that we Battle Is Easy Living or soft
[9:49] living as brother random says especially
[9:51] here in leoa he says it in the thy in
[9:54] church age page 239 He said Each age had
[9:57] its pressures for example a great burden
[9:59] of this last age is the pressure of
[10:01] riches soft living and nervous tensions
[10:04] in a complex age that we seem unfitted
[10:06] to live in so it's fitting he says it's
[10:08] a complex age and we have a lot of
[10:10] complexes notice the pressure of riches
[10:13] and also the pressure of soft living so
[10:15] each Holy Ghost filled person if you
[10:18] pray about it long enough or meditate
[10:20] long enough you'll see which area you
[10:21] battle the hardest either lust of the
[10:23] eyes lust of the flesh or pride of life
[10:26] and you got to keep battling many times
[10:28] with that area of your life over and
[10:30] over again Satan will leave for a season
[10:32] but then he'll come back you just got to
[10:33] be ready to fight and overcome cast down
[10:36] anything that exalts itself against the
[10:37] word of God the next verse I want to
[10:40] talk about is the scripture in 1 Peter
[10:44] 2:1 here's why people sometimes wonder
[10:47] am I filled with the Holy Ghost or not
[10:49] Peter says dearly beloved I beseech you
[10:51] as strangers and pilgrims abstain from
[10:53] fleshly lust which war against the soul
[10:56] so fleshly lust would probably be lust
[10:58] of the flesh right
[11:00] overeating giving the flesh too much
[11:02] food too much drink fancy clothes
[11:04] anything the flesh might like but also
[11:07] it could be lust of the eyes as well I
[11:10] personally believe because notice Peter
[11:12] says when people give into that if they
[11:14] don't abstain from fleshly lust it
[11:17] causes a war against their soul so this
[11:19] is why so many people have a war am I
[11:21] saved or not am I filled with the Holy
[11:23] Ghost or not it's because they've spent
[11:25] a lot of time recently giving in to the
[11:27] lust of the flesh but as soon as they
[11:29] cast that down they get into a new
[11:31] season they get a season of Victory a
[11:34] season of repentance a season of
[11:36] dedication and diligence to God then all
[11:39] these mind battles will be forgotten
[11:42] they'll be cast down and then the person
[11:44] can get their first love back get back
[11:46] on fire for Jesus Christ doing the first
[11:48] works and there won't be this big war
[11:51] going on in their minds so I hope that
[11:53] verse is a blessing 1 Peter 2: 11 now in
[11:57] the last part for the wise virgin I want
[11:59] to address the two comments on this
[12:01] video about major and minor sins and
[12:04] just so you know brother brandom said
[12:05] major sins three times the first is how
[12:08] can I overcome he said quote when this
[12:10] is the major sin of our day it's the
[12:12] major sin among our people worldliness
[12:15] let's listen to the
[12:16] quote when this is the major sin of our
[12:19] days that's right the major sin among
[12:22] our people worldl as the Bible said the
[12:24] lady lady OA age was she's worly Rich
[12:28] have need of nothing don't know that
[12:29] she's naked miserable wretched
[12:33] blind that's the sin of our day the
[12:37] second quote is from broken sisters
[12:39] 1965 brother is talking about Israel
[12:42] being accused by the prophet and they
[12:43] were accused of two major sins and the
[12:46] two major sins were forsaking God and
[12:48] then hewing out themselves ssts of
[12:51] course that's from the book of Jeremiah
[12:53] chapter 2 brother Brandon preached
[12:54] broken
[12:55] sisters we find out here that Israel
[12:59] is Accused by the prophet when God had
[13:02] ordained him and sent him out they were
[13:04] accused of two major sins and we want to
[13:08] talk on those two things that they had
[13:10] done and from that we want to prosper V
[13:14] uh they had turned from God the Fountain
[13:17] of Living Water and had hewed themselves
[13:20] out
[13:21] sisters so here we can see now there are
[13:24] major sins brother Ram said and minor
[13:26] Sins Of course minor sins was from 196 1
[13:29] he was asked specifically about minor
[13:31] things Christians might battle so the
[13:34] first comment said there's a problem
[13:36] with major and minor sins and this was a
[13:39] great question he said what about a man
[13:40] looking on a woman in lust and hating an
[13:43] individual in your heart you're guilty
[13:44] of murder and so forth he says Sin is
[13:46] Sin and So my answer was God bless you
[13:49] dear friend Sin is Sin and I agree with
[13:51] that and there are always consequences
[13:53] to sins whether in thought only form or
[13:57] action form but I said not all sins are
[14:00] equal nor are their consequences the
[14:03] Pharisees get the greater damnation for
[14:05] their hypocrisy According To Jesus in
[14:07] Matthew
[14:08] 23:14 and also the house or city that
[14:11] rejects the gospel will be punished more
[14:13] than Sodom and Gomorrah Matthew 10:14
[14:16] and 15 remember Sodom and gomorra was
[14:18] filled with Wicked gangster sodomites
[14:20] that surrounded houses and did
[14:22] wickedness so yes Sin is Sin but not all
[14:25] sins are equal and then also there's
[14:27] different levels of Rewards for
[14:29] Christians According To Jesus in Matthew
[14:32] 13:23 brother R talked about degrees of
[14:34] Believers as well there'll be Kings and
[14:37] rulers and then there'll just be the
[14:38] Common People by God's
[14:40] grace
[14:42] then I can prove that there is degrees
[14:45] in heaven that they'll not all be on the
[14:49] same equal but you'll have equal eternal
[14:51] life but the Bible said that the kings
[14:55] of the earth bring their honor and Glory
[14:58] Revelations 22 bring their honor and
[15:00] Glory into the city that proves that
[15:03] they'll be kings in the new
[15:07] Earth Kings and rulers Jesus told his
[15:11] disciples they said what will we have
[15:13] after we have left father and mother and
[15:15] all to follow you he said verily I say
[15:17] you you'll set up on 12 Thrones judging
[15:22] the 12 tribes of
[15:24] Israel so I went on to tell the brother
[15:27] yes walking in the spirit is a solution
[15:29] but thought sins like lust murder
[15:31] coveting that get confessed before
[15:33] actions are not the same as literally
[15:36] committing those sinful actions Jesus
[15:39] was basically showing that evil thoughts
[15:42] are the origin of all sin which goes
[15:45] with Matthew 15: 18- 19 if thought sins
[15:49] are confessed before taking action
[15:51] they're still forgiven according to 1
[15:53] John 1 8-10 if we confess them they're
[15:56] forgiven and then if they're confessed
[15:58] they won't have the same consequences as
[16:00] if a person literally commits one of
[16:02] those acts and then I didn't write this
[16:05] but I wanted to add this in on the video
[16:07] any genuine repentance is accepted by
[16:09] God and that's why David was not killed
[16:11] for his adultery and murder even though
[16:13] David knew and judge himself worthy of
[16:16] death as Nathan let David judge his sin
[16:19] first and David said that man will die
[16:22] but then Nathan showed Mercy from God
[16:24] and said Thou shalt not die in 2 Samuel
[16:27] 12:5 and second Samuel
[16:30] 12:13 but yet there was awful
[16:32] consequences to David's sin we all know
[16:34] that numerous people lost their lives
[16:37] because of David and on the other side
[16:39] David said blessed is the man to whom
[16:41] God will not impute sin so David
[16:43] committed the sin there was consequences
[16:45] but God didn't impute it against him in
[16:47] heaven it's according to Romans 4: 6-8
[16:51] another good example is the thief on the
[16:53] cross where he was so easily and
[16:55] powerfully forgiven and saved Jesus said
[16:58] today you'll be with me in
[17:00] Paradise the second comment on major and
[17:03] minor sin said that it seemed to him
[17:05] that brother brandom didn't mean to
[17:07] categorize sins as major and minor and
[17:10] then he thought this was the case
[17:11] according to James
[17:12] 29-11 he said based upon those
[17:15] scriptures I don't think the major minor
[17:17] distinction can be lined up with
[17:19] scripture my reply was God bless you
[17:21] thanks for your kindness we'll just have
[17:23] to agree to disagree brother brandham
[17:24] did say major sin and major sins and two
[17:26] other quotes also brother Bram said
[17:28] there's degrees in heaven with Kings
[17:30] rulers and common people how did some
[17:32] people become Kings While others were
[17:34] common people by their works because
[17:37] works is Faith expressed the Kings and
[17:40] rulers Liv the high calling as St Paul
[17:43] taught they lived above the major sins
[17:46] we're not saved by works but our works
[17:48] demonstrate our appreciation for Grace
[17:50] as brother brandom said and as of course
[17:52] the Bible teaches the Bible said in
[17:54] Ephesians 2 we're saved by grace but
[17:55] then we're created unto good works
[17:57] Ephesians 2:
[17:59] 8-10 so I told the brother Galatians 51
[18:02] 18-26 and 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 prove the
[18:06] distinction can be made between major
[18:09] and minor sins in my humble opinion also
[18:11] the life of Peter and the apostles
[18:13] before and after Pentecost proves this
[18:15] distinction as well God bless you and
[18:18] let me expound on that just a moment
[18:20] Before Peter got the holy ghost look at
[18:22] his major sins that he did he denied
[18:24] Jesus Christ three times but after he
[18:26] got the Holy Ghost he never denied
[18:28] Christ again also before they got the
[18:31] Holy Ghost the apostles were arguing
[18:32] about who's the greatest afterwards they
[18:34] were constantly trying to serve each one
[18:37] died a martyr except for St John I
[18:39] believe James and John were asking for
[18:41] Jesus to send fire down from heaven and
[18:43] destroy the cities that didn't accept
[18:45] him and Jesus said you don't even know
[18:46] what Spirit you're of in other words
[18:48] they lack the love of God but afterwards
[18:50] John was known as the disciple of love
[18:53] so there is clearly a difference between
[18:54] the major sins versus the minor sins
[18:57] denying Christ had to been major sin for
[18:59] Peter but after got the Holy Ghost he
[19:01] never denied Christ again now by God's
[19:04] grace I want to get to a few important
[19:06] points I want to sayate a few more
[19:08] things about that idea of sometimes we
[19:10] can know the wise virgin and the foolish
[19:12] virgin sometimes we can't I'm sure as
[19:15] message Believers have youve been around
[19:16] the message for long enough there's
[19:18] probably people that have fallen away
[19:20] that you or I might have thought for
[19:21] sure that person had the Holy Ghost I
[19:23] know that's happened to me especially
[19:24] when I was younger and a lot more
[19:26] immature but I felt like in part one I
[19:28] didn't do enough justice as far as
[19:30] saying there are people that you can
[19:32] definitely know are the true children of
[19:34] God are the wise virgins like think of
[19:37] brother ROM's life all the saints around
[19:38] him knew he was a born again Holy Ghost
[19:40] filled prophet of God it's undeniable
[19:43] they knew it and yet he had his human
[19:46] shortcomings he sinned every day as he
[19:48] said but he confessed them all by the
[19:50] blood of Christ the 120 Believers in the
[19:53] upper room would have known each one was
[19:55] filled with the Holy Ghost cuz they saw
[19:57] the fire above their forehead heads and
[19:59] yet then Peter at galatia would battle
[20:02] this fear complex and segregate himself
[20:04] away from the Gentiles and need to
[20:06] rebuked by St Paul so again they would
[20:09] have known Peter and the other 119
[20:11] Saints on the day of Pentecost had the
[20:13] Holy Ghost some Old Testament examples
[20:16] are there as well Samuel the prophet
[20:18] would have known David was the wise
[20:20] virgin for his day because he even told
[20:22] Saul David is better than you other
[20:24] words David was going to obey the
[20:26] Commandments better or more Faithfully
[20:28] than Saul and that's found in 1st Samuel
[20:33] 15:28 the Lord hath rent the kingdom and
[20:35] given it to a neighbor of thine that is
[20:37] better than thou and then remember David
[20:40] of course committed adultery and
[20:41] murdered but yet he was the highest
[20:44] quality of believer for his day everyone
[20:47] was compared to David all the kings were
[20:48] compared to David he was a man after
[20:50] God's Own Heart so again there are times
[20:53] we can know someone is the highest
[20:56] quality of believer for their day so for
[20:58] us today it's called the wise virgin the
[21:00] people who are baptized with the Holy
[21:02] Ghost in their souls next I want to read
[21:04] that quote I appreciate two people
[21:06] shared the quote with me where brother
[21:07] Ram said I can tell within 2 minutes if
[21:11] the person has the holy ghost or not the
[21:14] quotes from 1959 what is the Holy Ghost
[21:17] let's listen to the quote you let me
[21:20] talk to a man two minutes I can tell you
[21:22] whether he receed the holy ghost or not
[21:24] so can
[21:27] you it's separates them it's a Mark it's
[21:30] a
[21:32] sign and the Holy Spirit is a
[21:37] sign and again friends this quote backs
[21:39] up some of the examples I gave from the
[21:41] scripture about the day of Pentecost St
[21:43] Paul they would have seen St Paul filled
[21:45] with the Holy Ghost of course David as
[21:47] the example of the wise virgin for his
[21:49] day and then remember some people will
[21:51] battle whether they are born again or
[21:53] not like sister Bruce in 1964 interview
[21:56] with sister Bruce brother random ures
[21:58] her I've seen you under Vision you're a
[22:00] real Christian and brother Ram would
[22:02] tell her you know you should pray to
[22:04] speak in tongues if that will help you
[22:06] to know that you've got the Holy Ghost
[22:08] So you you're you're a Christian I've
[22:11] watched your life I've watched you under
[22:14] B and I know you're a Christian see not
[22:19] one spe of the I am your Shepherd as was
[22:23] somebody got if there was any doubt in
[22:25] my mind if I thought you was something
[22:27] was wrong I tell you sister R but if
[22:31] there's anything wrong in your
[22:32] experience anything wrong between you
[22:35] and God it's more than I know anything
[22:38] about
[22:41] than for
[22:44] friend so either way friends whether we
[22:47] struggle with it or not we've got to
[22:48] make our calling and election sure we've
[22:50] got to be humble we' got to press on
[22:52] toward the mark of the High Calling of
[22:54] God in Christ Jesus one final point I
[22:57] want to make is the power of confession
[22:59] Proverbs says life and death is in the
[23:01] power of the tongue brother random says
[23:03] don't ever say you're a weak Christian
[23:06] and remember Jesus Christ is the high
[23:08] priest of our profession the Bible also
[23:11] says in Proverbs whatsoever a man
[23:13] thinketh in his heart so he is so we got
[23:15] to make sure we keep the right thoughts
[23:16] about oursel all these scriptures about
[23:18] we're forgiven from Romans 8 also John
[23:21] 5:24 if we believe in Christ we pass
[23:24] from Death unto life and will not come
[23:26] into judgment we will not go for the
[23:29] white Throne judgment we will sit with
[23:30] Christ in the throne and the Bible says
[23:33] the Saints shall judge the Earth the
[23:35] Saints shall judge Angels why because of
[23:37] the grace of Jesus Christ because of the
[23:39] blood of Jesus Christ the present truth
[23:42] the message of the hour that Christ sent
[23:44] for this end times here at the end of
[23:46] the leian church age and recall friends
[23:49] there is 14 Seasons or times in
[23:52] Ecclesiastes 3 1-8 we must go through
[23:55] all of them by God's grace some are
[23:57] easier to go through than others it's a
[23:58] lot easier to dance than to mourn
[24:01] remember Ecclesiastes 8:11 God makes all
[24:04] things beautiful in his time let's
[24:06] confess that we're forgiven we're
[24:08] purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ
[24:10] we're bought with the price and In God's
[24:12] Presence we're unblameable
[24:14] unreprovable and let's live on this
[24:15] Earth where we can accept God's rebukes
[24:17] we can daily confess our sins and we can
[24:20] overcome All Things by the grace of our
[24:22] Lord Jesus Christ let us keep God's word
[24:24] let's say God's word let's profess God's
[24:27] words and we surely overcome by the
[24:30] power of the spoken
[24:32] word in
[24:33] closing friends I hope this video has
[24:35] been a blessing by the grace of God it's
[24:38] so wonderful to see all those verses
[24:39] about being forgiven Colossians 1
[24:41] Colossians 2 Romans chapter 8 and so
[24:44] many other ones 1 John chapter 1 Let's
[24:46] daily confess our sins and walk in the
[24:48] light as he's in the light let's confess
[24:51] the positive truths of God's word may
[24:54] life be in our tongue and not death
[24:57] let's remember God is rich in mercy God
[24:59] is quick to forgive God is slow to anger
[25:02] and rich in love remember a righteous
[25:05] man fth seven times but he rises up I'm
[25:08] reminded of a sermon I preached not long
[25:10] ago called so easily beset from Hebrews
[25:13] 121:2 the Bible said let us lay aside
[25:15] every weight and the sin which doth so
[25:17] easily beset us and let us run with
[25:19] patience the race that is set before us
[25:22] looking unto Jesus the author and
[25:23] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[25:25] that was set before him endured the
[25:27] cross despising the shame shame and set
[25:29] down at the right hand of God friends
[25:31] let's run the Christian Race Free from
[25:34] weights of sin as Peter said in First
[25:36] Peter 2:11 let's not live life with all
[25:39] these wars in our minds because of
[25:41] fleshly sins we've given into let's
[25:44] confess them let's overcome them let's
[25:46] get our first love back let's be on Fire
[25:48] Let's do our first works by the grace of
[25:50] God remember in this age we're either
[25:52] cold lukewarm or on fire if you know the
[25:56] fire of God has come into your soul well
[25:57] let's that fire up by the grace of God
[25:59] let's crucify the the lust and the
[26:02] affections thereof let's overcome every
[26:04] weight let's lay them all aside and
[26:06] let's get our original fire back by the
[26:08] grace of God if you have any questions
