[11:34] my sister went over there and said he's
[11:36] doing a lot better
[11:37] uh and he's smoking less so the thought

[11:42] getting him away from smoking so he can
[11:44] actually have a revival
[11:45] in his life he used to really love the
[11:47] lord and then he
[11:49] fell away backslid and that started with
[11:52] cigarette when program told that story
[11:53] from that time on as soon as someone
[11:55] makes a wrong decision if they don't
[11:56] correct that they backslide
[11:58] that's what happened to my dad god
[12:00] cleaned him out
[12:01] sanctified him with the holy spirit but
[12:03] then he went right back to cigarettes
[12:04] and he's been down
[12:06] falling down ever since so anyways thank
[12:09] you for your prayers he's doing better
[12:10] uh austin thanks you for your prayers

[16:58] testimonies praise god
[17:01] i'm not going to turn us in a testimony
[17:02] meeting but sister naomi can i share
[17:04] just briefly about your testimony you
[17:05] shared on wednesday night so what uh
[17:07] sister naomi was telling me on wednesday
[17:08] night after church
[17:10] a few years ago she was praying god you
[17:12] know she was she really wanted a
[17:13] confirmation that she'd been baptized
[17:15] with the holy ghost
[17:16] and she prayed lord let me speak in
[17:18] tongues as a sign i have the holy ghost
[17:20] well she prayed it years ago
[17:22] was it that church you prayed or was it
[17:23] somewhere else at church
[17:26] and then uh she forgot about it as many
[17:28] times we do right we pray we ask god for
[17:30] signs and miracles and
[17:32] we ask god for great things we forget
[17:34] about it he's like brother braham he'd
[17:36] have visions he'd write it down and just
[17:37] forget about it and then god in the
[17:38] moment then god would bring it back to
[17:40] him oh this is what i prayed for
[17:42] this is the vision that i saw
[17:45] and then sister naomi said uh she
[17:47] remembered in a service i think it was a
[17:49] couple years ago
[17:49] the holy spirit fell on her and she
[17:51] spoke in tongues you probably remember
[17:52] that
[17:53] by god's grace so that's a great
[17:55] testimony i thought
[17:57] if we ask god our hearts desire he's
[17:59] faithful and just
[18:00] to minister to that so i just thought
[18:02] i'd share that testimony let's give that
[18:03] a round of applause
[18:04] praise god i love it i love things like
[18:06] that
[18:08] do you want to quickly share the
[18:09] testimony of uh your wife praying for

[18:50] in the name of jesus and that she felt
[18:52] um her
[18:53] arm go numb and the she felt like it

[34:52] and then once the mechanics are come he
[34:54] said then the
[34:55] dynamics can come that would be
[34:57] rapturing faith amen praise god
[35:00] and so that's what we're living in today
[35:02] and i want to show a few scriptures uh
[35:04] to kind of vindicate that as well
[35:07] so joel 2 23.
[35:13] i'll just read verse 20 i'll read 23 and
[35:15] then we can all read matthew 6.
[35:17] so just let me read this one myself just
[35:19] to save us a little bit of time
[35:20] verse 23 says be glad then ye children
[35:23] of zion
[35:24] and rejoice in the lord your god for he
[35:26] hath given you the former reign
[35:28] moderately and he will cause to come
[35:30] down for you
[35:31] the rain the former rain and the latter
[35:34] rain
[35:35] in the first month praise god
[35:38] so let's go now to matthew 6 30.
[35:41] our memory verse from brother stephen he
[35:43] apologizes he can't be here he has to
[35:44] work
[35:45] they're doing uh seven day shifts now
[35:47] he's really disappointed with that
[35:49] uh and when we pray for the preaching we
[35:52] can also pray for him that
[35:53] uh they'll decrease the hours and that's
[35:55] something that seems like our brothers
[35:56] you know oftentimes it's either
[35:58] too much work or not enough it's just
[35:59] hard to find that middle of the road you
[36:01] know
[36:01] it's hard to find that but god knows you
[36:03] know god allows it
[36:05] as we heard last week god has to allow
[36:07] everything that happens
[36:09] and he's uh he's wanting to see us
[36:11] overcome with a good testimony
[36:12] amen praise god in fact if if job is
[36:16] applied just like us then god's like
[36:17] just go head devil go and test
[36:19] brother amen go and test brother so and
[36:21] so go and test sister so-and-so they're
[36:23] gonna
[36:23] overcome amen he knows we're going to
[36:25] overcome praise god
[36:27] he's not wondering he knows praise god
[36:30] matthew 6 30 down to 34.
[36:34] let's read that on three one two three
[36:37] wherefore
[36:37] if god so clothed the grass of the field
[36:40] which today
[36:41] is and tomorrow is cast into the oven
[36:45] shall not he much more clothe you o ye
[36:48] of little faith therefore take no
[36:51] thought
[36:51] saying what shall we eat or what shall
[36:54] we drink
[36:55] or wherewithal shall we be clothed for
[36:58] after all these things do the gentiles
[37:00] seek
[37:01] for your heavenly father knoweth that ye
[37:03] have need of all these things
[37:06] but seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[37:08] his righteousness
[37:10] and all these things shall be added unto
[37:12] you
[37:13] take therefore no thought for the morrow
[37:15] for the morrow shall take thought for
[37:17] the things of itself
[37:19] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[37:21] thereof let's have a word of prayer
[37:23] let's remember to pray for brother
[37:24] stephen and those we don't see here this

[38:43] christ's name and the saint said amen
[38:46] praise god god bless you as you're being
[38:47] seated praise the lord
[38:54] so by god's grace we'll do just a quick
[38:56] review from wednesday i'd just like to
[38:58] kind of remind everybody where uh our
[39:00] thoughts were for wednesday
[39:02] uh brother and i were talking last
[39:05] sunday about the rapture it just kind of
[39:06] got me thinking
[39:07] where's my slide with part two i just
[39:09] put in the wrong spot so forgive me
[39:11] but anyways we're looking at our vision
[39:13] our vision is uh
[39:15] joel 2 but the bible says where there's
[39:18] no vision that people perish right
[39:21] i'm sorry and the vision actually there
[39:23] means a divine communication
[39:25] so a lot of churches today don't have a
[39:27] divine communication
[39:28] and what i mean by that they don't have
[39:30] thus saith the lord
[39:32] they've got the bible but they don't
[39:33] have a divine communication
[39:36] living in their day or in their
[39:38] generation right that where they got
[39:40] thus saith the lord
[39:41] there in the perfect will of god now we
[39:43] got it by god's grace
[39:44] so i'm very thankful for that praise god
[39:47] and so we're
[39:48] living off that revelation remember
[39:50] habakkuk he said when you see the vision
[39:52] write it and run with it he said you
[39:55] just gotta wait though we gotta be
[39:56] patient
[39:57] aren't you glad it's part of the stature
[39:58] perfect man
[40:00] god knew you need patience so he built
[40:02] it in
[40:03] to your character praise god and if you
[40:05] really got holy ghost patience you can
[40:07] wait for the rapture praise god
[40:09] hallelujah and then remember we'll
[40:11] return to heaven because we came out of
[40:12] heaven this wasn't my main subject as
[40:14] far as now
[40:15] but the bible said you're chosen in him
[40:17] and then you got eternal theophany in
[40:19] the heavens
[40:20] so you have representation there you
[40:22] don't remember it because you were in
[40:23] the mind of god
[40:24] uh you don't remember when god made all
[40:25] those theophanies but you got one up
[40:27] there praise god
[40:28] the ram said when uh when god made adam
[40:30] and east theophany he made all yours too
[40:33] now that's something i wonder where that
[40:34] little section of heaven is that has all
[40:36] the theophanies waiting for us
[40:38] but brother adam said that's what he did
[40:40] he said adam and eve got placed in that
[40:41] theophany when they were just they were
[40:43] just a spirit hovering around the earth
[40:45] right
[40:45] they were in that theophy then god
[40:46] divided them and placed them in flesh
[40:48] bodies
[40:49] but all of our theophanies somewhere
[40:51] must be up in some bank in heaven i
[40:53] imagine
[40:53] somewhere some storage room or something
[40:56] uh and just remember you know
[40:57] the bible said above man said a group's
[41:00] gonna rise up
[41:01] that will listen to the spirit and by
[41:03] the pure word now that's why church
[41:05] we've got to take everything brother
[41:06] branham said back to the word
[41:07] amen and the holy spirit will help us do
[41:10] that
[41:10] like i was emailing the brother i
[41:12] summoned her back from brother joseph
[41:14] i was emailing one of his people that go
[41:15] to the church and
[41:18] i said well brother branham said pray to
[41:20] the third person of the trinity there's
[41:21] a quote brother
[41:22] says pray to the third person the
[41:23] trinity i said is your pastor going to
[41:25] teach you guys to pray to the third
[41:26] person the trinity this weekend
[41:28] and he just totally moved it off to
[41:30] another subject see because they can't
[41:32] they can't they have to accept every
[41:33] word as thus saith the lord
[41:36] uh because they don't know how to
[41:37] rightly divide it but see if we've got
[41:39] the holy ghost we can rightly divide it
[41:41] amen
[41:41] and we're going to believe the pure word
[41:44] not a tainted word not a
[41:46] a contradictory word but we're going to
[41:48] believe just the word of god amen
[41:50] and brother man like every man like you
[41:52] and i we grow in understanding
[41:54] uh we have to grow in revelation praise
[41:56] god and so those things don't stumble us
[41:58] but we know the word the bride has to be
[42:01] a pure word bride
[42:03] praise god because jesus is all word and
[42:05] we've got to be
[42:06] one with the word praise god and jesus
[42:09] is the word and so when we have the pure
[42:11] word
[42:12] we'll return to the full power of
[42:14] pentecost and that's joel
[42:16] remember joel 2 23. uh brother ram said
[42:19] it's it's a necessity of a return of
[42:21] dynamic power
[42:22] and we saw joel 2 23 as thus saith the
[42:25] lord
[42:26] the fullness of pentecost now what will
[42:28] that entail i don't know
[42:30] i don't know which parts of pentecost it
[42:31] will entail
[42:33] but uh it's thus saith the lord praise
[42:35] god so whatever they had the faith they
[42:37] had at pentecost
[42:39] we'll have it right before the rapture
[42:40] by god's grace
[42:42] of course i believe we have a portion of
[42:43] it now of course i believe that we
[42:45] couldn't have all these testimonies
[42:46] without the same faith praise god
[42:48] hallelujah now i'm just skipping ahead
[42:51] from wednesday like
[42:52] like you saw now brother ram said
[42:54] mechanics and dynamics
[42:56] uh he said we got to get the mechanics
[42:57] in order and then the dynamics will come
[43:00] he said uh which is rapturing faith uh
[43:03] and remember we saw how
[43:04] god said doctrine is like rain so when
[43:07] someone teaches you the truth about
[43:08] doctrine
[43:09] which is instruction it's the it's a
[43:12] refreshing anointing of the holy spirit
[43:15] i felt it when i first heard serpent
[43:16] seed i felt it fall like rain praise god
[43:19] when i forgot about cutting my hair and
[43:21] men got to have short hair i had i had a
[43:23] mullet can you imagine me with the
[43:24] mullet i had a big mullet
[43:27] well as soon as i heard that i cut my
[43:28] hair it was refreshing like rain
[43:31] see that doctrine is like rain it's a
[43:33] fresh oh now i know what to do
[43:35] now i know what god's telling me to do
[43:37] praise god and so it falls like
[43:39] rain the bible says and that's what the
[43:41] former rain is the former rain is just
[43:43] this refreshing of ah now i know how to
[43:46] live my life
[43:46] now i know what to do praise god now i
[43:49] know how to put god first
[43:50] and seek the kingdom of god first and
[43:53] everything else will be added to me
[43:54] amen so brother man says now brother
[43:58] answers the mechanics there are waiting
[43:59] on the dynamics that'll take her in the
[44:01] rapture
[44:02] uh we don't know how right now this is
[44:05] before he said thus saith the lord
[44:07] with joel 2 23 but he's the dynamics
[44:12] the dynamics of the church will be a
[44:13] refilling of the holy spirit
[44:15] which we've worked in a small measure
[44:18] while the headstone's coming down
[44:20] so if you're already born again at the
[44:22] time of the rapture you'll get a
[44:23] refilling in your human spirit
[44:25] if like our children and some of the
[44:27] ones that maybe aren't born again adults
[44:29] they'll get the real baptism of the holy
[44:31] ghost in their souls at that time amen
[44:34] praise god it has to be because they got
[44:36] to have oil
[44:37] in order to go out to meet the
[44:38] bridegroom praise god amen hallelujah
[44:42] it has to be so that's what we can see
[44:45] from the scripture now like you said
[44:46] but said we're looking for another surge
[44:48] of the holy spirit we saw that on
[44:49] wednesday
[44:51] he said from the token 64. i'm sorry 63.
[44:55] another surge for a rapturing faith so
[44:58] brother i'm clearly taught we're looking
[45:00] for this rapturing faith now we close
[45:03] the service by showing how
[45:04] the raptures of revelation and it struck
[45:07] me later
[45:08] that all god wants us to do is have as
[45:11] much faith as we can
[45:13] right and i gave the example of who is
[45:15] dead and bang's dad being healed
[45:17] i didn't know we didn't know for sure if
[45:18] god was going to do it but we took the
[45:20] little mustard seed we had brother bang
[45:22] and we acted on that mustard seed we
[45:25] spoke the word we did a prayer cloth we
[45:27] just
[45:28] whatever we got and he said if you just
[45:30] got a grain
[45:31] he said you'll move the mountains amen i
[45:33] didn't hear you praise god
[45:35] and i still didn't even know that god
[45:36] was going to do it as far as i didn't
[45:37] know he was going to do it but i was
[45:39] acting upon all the faith that i had i
[45:41] knew he could do it amen amen
[45:43] so we apply that like look with amen's
[45:45] healing from this week and
[45:47] our sister's testimony you know about
[45:49] speaking in tongues and asking god for
[45:51] these things
[45:52] we just got to be patient praise god ask
[45:54] god and if it's god's will
[45:56] god will do it and just serve god with
[45:58] as much faith as we have praise god
[46:00] cling to every ounce of faith that we
[46:02] have and god will give us the revelation
[46:05] for the hour that we need it praise god
[46:08] amen now i'm going to go past my review
[46:09] because i don't want to i don't want to
[46:10] spend too much time on the review
[46:13] now i want to um look here
[46:16] at a few things now you know it's thus
[46:20] saith the lord
[46:20] we have to return to pentecost we have
[46:23] to
[46:24] and uh now i want to look at this
[46:27] scripture i've never preached this
[46:28] before because i've been listening you
[46:29] know different sermons and yesterday i
[46:30] was listening to once more lord
[46:32] beautiful message from brother branham
[46:34] uh about samson
[46:36] uh beautiful but brother and makes his
[46:40] statement time and time again
[46:42] how we are in between two revivals how
[46:44] many know that
[46:46] the last revival was the healing revival
[46:49] started in 1946 so that world war ii
[46:53] ended 1945 the next year
[46:57] the holy spirit commissioned brother
[46:59] branham to go around the world
[47:01] and preach a few months after him
[47:04] uh billy graham started but he didn't
[47:06] get famous until 1949 when he preached
[47:08] in new york city
[47:10] and then uh uh oral roberts
[47:13] started in 1947 after seeing brother
[47:15] branham
[47:16] preach and that's why i brought this i
[47:19] bought this dictionary
[47:21] it's a pentecostal dictionary now they
[47:22] say brother branham was a
[47:24] true gifted uh to pray for the sick but
[47:28] he got off on his doctrine now everybody
[47:29] says that because they don't want to
[47:30] obey the word
[47:32] but we know he's a true prophet um
[47:36] anyways when you go to his name branham
[47:38] it says the initiator of the post-world
[47:41] war
[47:41] ii healing revival so this man that
[47:45] all these men that wrote it there's
[47:46] three three men there that wrote they
[47:48] don't even believe brother bran's the
[47:49] prophet
[47:50] they don't even believe that he teaches
[47:52] right doctrine yet they
[47:53] all have to recognize that god started a
[47:56] revival in brother man's ministry
[47:58] they all have to recognize it and they
[48:01] even show brother man's picture the
[48:02] pillar of fire
[48:04] they say this is perhaps the most famous
[48:05] picture in the post-war
[48:08] healing revival and it is
[48:11] because that's our god that's jesus
[48:13] right there praise god that's the holy
[48:15] spirit
[48:16] and uh i want to just read to you again
[48:18] a few things here
[48:23] they clearly say
[48:26] uh the the person universally
[48:28] acknowledged as the revival's father
[48:31] and pacesetter was william branham the
[48:33] sudden appearance of his miraculous
[48:35] healing campaigns in 1946
[48:38] set off a spiritual explosion in the
[48:40] pentecostal movement
[48:41] which was to move to main street usa by
[48:44] the 1950s and give birth to the broader
[48:46] charismatic movement
[48:48] in the 1960s which currently affects
[48:50] almost every denomination in the country
[48:53] so they can recognize and then they say
[48:55] the second they call brother branham the
[48:57] first
[48:57] giant of the healing revival they say
[49:01] the second
[49:01] giant of the post-war healing revival
[49:04] was oral roberts
[49:05] so anyone with any spiritual
[49:08] understanding at all
[49:09] they can recognize a revival started in
[49:12] 1946
[49:14] praise god and then brother branham gets
[49:18] towards the end of his ministry in 63
[49:20] and he says that now that started a
[49:22] national revival
[49:24] it was a worldwide in fact national and
[49:26] then worldwide healing revival
[49:29] now say like this there's still that
[49:30] going on right here praise god
[49:32] amen but as far as a nationwide and
[49:34] worldwide
[49:36] it's not on anymore that part has died
[49:38] but i do believe it's worldwide
[49:40] it's still going from church to church
[49:42] in south america right
[49:43] africa we're hearing you know over the
[49:44] years we hear different testimonies
[49:46] about missionaries having great success
[49:48] in different countries so the revival is
[49:50] still going on in a small way
[49:52] but the national revival stopped and
[49:54] even educated men that went to seminary
[49:57] can all recognize god started something
[50:00] in brother branham's ministry
[50:01] praise god now i want to show this here
[50:04] if you've got your bibles here
[50:06] brother branham tells this now this is i
[50:08] never preached on this before the first
[50:10] time i ever preached on this
[50:11] and it was through brother amen's
[50:13] conversation and through the sermons
[50:14] i've been listening to
[50:16] there really are we are right now in the
[50:18] middle between revivals
[50:20] praise god amen the man says it you know
[50:24] and there's even scripture and these are
[50:27] the scriptures brother branham uses so
[50:28] let's go to mark
[50:29] 4 35 please i'm just going to try to not
[50:33] go rush i'm not going to try to rush
[50:35] today
[50:37] yep and we don't have any testimony
[50:39] signed up so that must mean i'm supposed
[50:40] to preach a little longer today
[50:42] mark 4 35.
[50:46] now this is jesus stealing the storm
[50:49] right crossing the sea and stealing the
[50:52] storm now who would have thought
[50:54] this scripture applied to 2020
[50:58] or 1963 when brother anne preaches who
[51:00] would have thought
[51:01] i would have never thought right but
[51:04] church i think we're learning as time
[51:06] goes on
[51:06] that this whole bible speaks to jesus
[51:10] and his bride amen yeah as i speak to
[51:12] the jews
[51:13] but as time goes on we're finding more
[51:15] and more scripture
[51:16] applies to us
[51:21] so in this scripture mark 4 35 let me
[51:24] get back there sorry i closed my bible
[51:26] like 4 35 jesus
[51:29] crossing the sea here
[51:34] now it says and the same day when the
[51:37] even was come
[51:38] he saith unto them let us pass over and
[51:40] to the other side
[51:41] now this is right after their last
[51:44] revival they'd had
[51:46] in the previous city verse 36 and when
[51:48] they sent
[51:49] away the multitude they took him even as
[51:52] he was in the ship and there
[51:53] were also with him other little ships
[51:57] and there arose a great storm of wind
[51:59] and the waves beat into the ship so that
[52:01] it was now full
[52:03] and he was in the hinder part of the
[52:04] ship asleep on a pillow
[52:06] and they wake him and said him master
[52:08] carest thou not that we perish
[52:10] and he arose and rebuked the wind and
[52:12] said unto the sea peace be still
[52:15] and the wind ceased and there was a
[52:17] great calm
[52:18] and he said them why are ye so fearful
[52:21] how is it that ye have no faith
[52:23] and they fear it exceedingly it said one
[52:25] to another what manner man is this that
[52:27] even the wind
[52:28] and the sea obey him
[52:32] what a scripture brother adam says
[52:35] our day is seen in this scripture
[52:39] notice they were adam they had a
[52:40] multitude of people brother ram calls it
[52:43] a revival
[52:44] they leave the revival and church
[52:47] they're headed to a revival if you go to
[52:49] the next chapter chapter five the maniac
[52:51] of gabra
[52:52] and you know after that after he got
[52:53] delivered the whole city was in an
[52:55] uproar of revival
[52:56] so brotherhood says right now we are in
[52:58] between
[53:00] the two revivals amen
[53:03] now let me read the quotes uh i'm sorry
[53:05] i probably should have chose a better
[53:06] font it's kind of hard to read
[53:08] talk about amazing race how sweet this
[53:10] sound what a securities
[53:12] how secure we feel
[53:15] to know that when we're driving on the
[53:17] highways whatever we're doing
[53:18] that jesus lays in the ship now he ain't
[53:22] talking about your car
[53:23] he's talking about your soul praise god
[53:26] he's talking about the ship of your body
[53:28] praise god he said what a comfort
[53:30] calling jesus on the scene
[53:32] after the seals amen the one who can
[53:34] perform any miracle
[53:36] can do anything that he once done now
[53:38] see it's got to be what he wants done
[53:39] not what we want done
[53:40] amen unless we can now we got to get our
[53:43] will lined up with his will that's when
[53:44] we see the results
[53:46] doing it again perfectly identifying
[53:48] himself he is in our little boat as
[53:50] we're sailing
[53:51] life's solemn maine same as he was then
[53:55] so he is now
[53:56] what a feeling of security now this
[53:58] whole world is in chaos
[53:59] arguing and political unrest and and
[54:02] riots and
[54:03] uh major cities not like in our city
[54:05] thank god thank god it's not in our city
[54:07] i thank the lord for that i believe god
[54:08] has protected our city
[54:10] that's just my because i've signed and
[54:11] cried for the abominations in this city
[54:13] amen
[54:14] that just struck me i didn't think about
[54:15] that but i've been praying for this city
[54:17] praise god
[54:20] what a feeling of security that's one
[54:21] thing we've got security in christ
[54:24] jesus amen he said what a feeling
[54:27] while sailing the troubled lives waters
[54:29] of life when this mel johnson the abel
[54:31] singer the little swede saying when i
[54:33] cross over the river of jordan just
[54:35] think
[54:35] when you come down there to the river
[54:37] he'll be there i'll not leave you nor
[54:38] forsake you what a promise
[54:40] sailing these troubled waters aren't you
[54:43] glad jesus is right there praise god
[54:46] hallelujah look what he says they were
[54:49] something like
[54:50] us today he's talking about the
[54:51] disciples in the ship
[54:54] those disciples out there on that ship
[54:56] that night after the revival
[54:59] was feasting on the results
[55:03] now maybe now look there's that word
[55:05] maybe right like ben and i've been
[55:07] talking about the foolish virgin perhaps
[55:10] you know they'll be saved just by being
[55:12] good to the brother perhaps right
[55:13] these maybes now maybe between the
[55:15] revivals now
[55:17] we're looking for another stir where
[55:19] there has to be something happen now
[55:21] that will gather the church together
[55:24] so brother says it's like we're like in
[55:26] the ship and we're between revivals
[55:29] and we're looking for another stir
[55:30] praise god
[55:32] there will have to come some kind of a
[55:34] press sound familiar
[55:36] squeeze yes press squeeze it together
[55:40] god always does it that way to run his
[55:42] people together amen
[55:44] he always does the church he's always
[55:46] got to send trouble to get us to all
[55:48] come together more closely amen
[55:53] i believe that's already being formed
[55:55] that will shut out everything that won't
[55:57] agree with them he's talking about the
[55:58] mark of the beast
[55:59] and then it's going to run the church
[56:00] together
[56:02] and we're waiting for that to happen and
[56:04] we're living on the results of the great
[56:06] revival
[56:06] that we've just passed and he's resting
[56:08] now let me show this i know
[56:10] different message churches that won't
[56:12] have any fellowship yet they both claim
[56:14] they got the holy ghost
[56:16] all because one church kind of preached
[56:18] on the other one
[56:19] now church the sad part was the pastors
[56:21] never even talked about it
[56:23] they just go on their internet now which
[56:24] is okay to have internet services but
[56:26] they just bash each other back and forth
[56:28] now that should not be you can see
[56:30] miracles in both churches
[56:32] you can see the holy spirit godly lives
[56:34] holy lives
[56:36] but see we're not quite together right
[56:38] so god's got to do something to get us
[56:39] back together amen
[56:41] and brother man said i have a quote i
[56:42] don't have it this morning but i can
[56:43] look it up for you
[56:44] brother rahm said thus saith the lord he
[56:46] said god will
[56:47] will bring all the church together and
[56:50] cause him to leave
[56:51] all their denominational differences and
[56:53] fusses before the rapture
[56:55] he said it's thus saith the lord so
[56:58] don't be discouraged you know message
[56:59] churches fight and bicker you know
[57:00] they're just going to do that
[57:02] thank god you know as far as i know
[57:03] we're not bickering with anybody as far
[57:04] as i know now
[57:05] i'm trying to bring cracks into churches
[57:07] and i'm sure a lot of people don't like
[57:09] me very much
[57:10] and that's okay because i'm saying on
[57:11] god's word but i want to do it with the
[57:13] love of god
[57:15] and the thing is i've reached out to
[57:16] them i've offered to talk to them i've
[57:18] sent them letters and they still won't
[57:20] call me so what would you do
[57:23] i just keep trying to be loving praise
[57:24] god i said let's talk let's
[57:26] let's meet they don't want to do that
[57:28] they'd just rather write back and
[57:30] disagree that's fine but but see
[57:34] god always has to do that he has to let
[57:36] some persecution come
[57:38] in order to drive the people together
[57:40] that's what i i noticed too
[57:42] sometimes i get a little loose in my
[57:43] life right but then god allows somebody
[57:45] to criticize me it'll drive me to my
[57:47] knees
[57:48] right or you got a little struggle a
[57:50] little low on the finances or
[57:52] you got got some pain you got sick what
[57:54] does it always do
[57:55] drives you to prayer drives you back
[57:57] into fellowship with god amen
[58:01] and so church this is what we see here
[58:02] we see uh brother graham using this in
[58:04] this beautiful
[58:05] i never really thought about this before
[58:08] he said we're in between revivals
[58:10] looking for another stir here's the next
[58:13] quote
[58:14] now we wonder why revival is not going
[58:16] on right now we don't know why we don't
[58:18] see the enthusiasm with the people i
[58:20] don't know why
[58:21] but let's just think what it's like this
[58:23] maybe there's a little boy here tonight
[58:24] a little girl was born over in seattle
[58:26] washington now
[58:27] that book holds her name he's talking
[58:28] about the lamb's book of life
[58:30] he he come to redeem whose name was on
[58:33] that book
[58:34] reading means bring back from where it
[58:36] fell from and the human race
[58:38] she was fell and she can't accept it now
[58:40] she's too young
[58:41] so the church will slug
[58:44] along you ever seen a slug
[58:48] i opened up my door the other day i got
[58:49] slugs on my door because it was a humid
[58:51] day i noticed that on humid days
[58:53] there's slugs that climb on my car doors
[58:55] you ever seen them before am i the only
[58:57] one that's got slugs
[58:58] i might be the only one that has slugs
[59:01] my children see them right we see them
[59:02] around the house
[59:04] so look what i'm saying he said the
[59:06] church has got to
[59:07] kind of slug around right i'll say like
[59:08] this just kind of carry on the waves
[59:12] because we're in the we're in the boat
[59:14] praise god we got jesus in our boat
[59:16] praise god
[59:17] we got the real holy ghost in our boat
[59:19] amen thank god amen
[59:21] but we're just kind of slugging around
[59:23] the waves back and forth and
[59:25] you know just going sailing live silent
[59:27] maine probably said we just got to keep
[59:29] slugging along
[59:30] just playing along we'll have the
[59:33] meetings and so forth
[59:35] until that last person is brought in
[59:37] then the book is closed there's no more
[59:38] added then it's all over
[59:41] now church you and i want the rapture to
[59:44] happen
[59:44] right but what if
[59:49] uh just what if you've got a young one
[59:53] i've got eight young ones
[59:57] see so i like to i like the lord of
[59:58] terry a little longer
[1:00:00] or if he like amen i were talking or he
[1:00:02] could give him the holy ghost right
[1:00:03] before the rapture no matter what age
[1:00:04] they are
[1:00:05] as long as they repent you know and
[1:00:07] serve god as long as they're a little
[1:00:08] old enough
[1:00:09] but see so and in church let me say like
[1:00:12] this you know the reasons we'll go over
[1:00:13] tonight
[1:00:14] some of the reasons i don't believe the
[1:00:15] rapture can happen this year is because
[1:00:17] the the world hasn't heard the message
[1:00:20] the whole world hasn't heard the message
[1:00:23] when we were there voice of god it
[1:00:24] wasn't i think it was the first time
[1:00:26] jose and i went
[1:00:27] they told us that woman at the desk told
[1:00:29] us that the message has not been
[1:00:30] translated in every
[1:00:32] language yet they're still in need of
[1:00:34] translators
[1:00:35] in other words there are people that
[1:00:37] have never heard about jesus christ
[1:00:40] and the water baptism in the name of
[1:00:41] jesus christ in their language
[1:00:44] and so god is patient praise god and
[1:00:46] god's going to raise up he's going to
[1:00:48] anoint missionaries
[1:00:49] he's going to anoint translators glory
[1:00:51] and jesus said pray
[1:00:53] that the god that the lord of the
[1:00:54] harvest will send laborers into the
[1:00:56] harvest amen
[1:00:58] that's one thing we can do we can pray
[1:01:00] that god will
[1:01:01] break this covet fear because that's
[1:01:03] what it is fear
[1:01:05] and send forth the missionaries now i'm
[1:01:08] just going to add this real quick
[1:01:09] 4 000 people have died in ohio from
[1:01:11] coven
[1:01:13] that is i
[1:01:16] looked up the other day it's it's not
[1:01:17] even it's not even a thousandths of one
[1:01:20] percent of this
[1:01:22] of this pandemic i mean
[1:01:26] it's hard to imagine how small this
[1:01:28] really is
[1:01:30] so if you had one percent one one out of
[1:01:33] a hundred if you had one percent
[1:01:34] and then break that one percent into a
[1:01:36] thousand that's how many people are
[1:01:37] dying from coburn
[1:01:39] it's hard to imagine remember 60 percent
[1:01:42] of europe died in the black
[1:01:44] plague and we're not we're at a
[1:01:46] thousandth of one percent
[1:01:47] this is no this is no black plague did
[1:01:52] you and i remember i appreciate on
[1:01:53] uh wednesday the church is out in
[1:01:56] california i saw they won their legal
[1:01:57] battle so they can have church today
[1:02:00] because they took those numbers their
[1:02:02] numbers are actually better than ours
[1:02:04] right now at least in that part of
[1:02:05] california
[1:02:07] they're they're at like 99.9997
[1:02:10] uh percent of people don't get covered
[1:02:12] and don't die and we're at like 99.9996
[1:02:19] and so they won they won the court case
[1:02:21] this week in that church i think it's
[1:02:22] john macarthur church he's a
[1:02:23] denominational guy
[1:02:24] pretty good teacher pretty solid except
[1:02:27] he don't believe in the supernatural
[1:02:28] that's a real bad
[1:02:29] problem oh baby god is merciful
[1:02:33] but anyways you see it's
[1:02:36] it's just crazy what this world is doing
[1:02:38] so here you know
[1:02:40] they're trying to get the people to give
[1:02:42] up their rights
[1:02:44] what the bible says they want a
[1:02:46] worldwide
[1:02:47] economy right the bible said they want a
[1:02:50] worldwide religion
[1:02:52] because every so there that we know it
[1:02:54] the one world religion one world economy
[1:02:56] we know that's where it's moving and
[1:02:58] they're testing it out
[1:03:00] right they used covid to test it out it
[1:03:02] was china
[1:03:03] china sent it out and i don't know if
[1:03:04] china was responsible or
[1:03:06] russian people in china i don't know but
[1:03:09] it came out of china
[1:03:10] and they're trying to use that to just
[1:03:12] test the world and see what they'll give
[1:03:14] up
[1:03:15] and see they're trying to they start out
[1:03:17] west to try to get the churches to be so
[1:03:19] fearful
[1:03:19] they don't even come to church but
[1:03:21] church see we've got to come to church
[1:03:23] and gather more as we see that day
[1:03:24] approaching praise god
[1:03:26] we'll keep their 10 person limit for a
[1:03:28] few weeks but then when we see
[1:03:29] that there's no problem and there's
[1:03:30] nothing to fear and it's not going to
[1:03:32] strike us or anything like that
[1:03:33] then we're back with faith and we're
[1:03:35] back praising god
[1:03:36] and it's like it never happened right
[1:03:38] because we're here to praise god we're
[1:03:40] here to hear the word of god
[1:03:41] and we won't let anything distract us
[1:03:43] from serving jesus christ
[1:03:50] you see slug along gotta keep slugging
[1:03:52] along
[1:03:53] every now and then we'll see great
[1:03:54] little testimonies right like he's
[1:03:57] we'll see a few people saved here now in
[1:03:59] bed but we're just slugging along
[1:04:00] waiting for that last name
[1:04:03] praise god
[1:04:06] now look at this then jesus came and
[1:04:08] called until when to that time will be
[1:04:10] none of us know
[1:04:11] but let's just keep doing all we can to
[1:04:13] his glory
[1:04:14] until that time is over this is the
[1:04:16] continuation of the previous quote
[1:04:18] just slug along just keep having
[1:04:20] services revivals
[1:04:21] you know in your own self till time is
[1:04:23] over we don't know who that person is it
[1:04:25] may already be in we're just waiting is
[1:04:26] coming
[1:04:27] we do not know and it'll never be
[1:04:29] revealed to man the time of his coming
[1:04:31] because not even the angels of heaven
[1:04:32] know when it's going to be
[1:04:34] but we're just looking for any time
[1:04:36] waiting watching
[1:04:37] for his coming praise god
[1:04:41] now look here's where i mentioned this
[1:04:43] revival earlier look what he says in 65
[1:04:46] when the message first started out of
[1:04:47] course everybody was praying for the
[1:04:50] sick great signs wonders and miracles
[1:04:52] that started especially in the
[1:04:53] pentecostal people a universal revival
[1:04:56] of a healing campaigns that swept the
[1:04:58] world
[1:04:58] for 15 years solid there's been revivals
[1:05:01] on every hill i suppose
[1:05:02] revival fires are burning literally
[1:05:04] millions have accepted christ as their
[1:05:06] savior
[1:05:07] by that one commission that inspired
[1:05:09] from there to oral roberts and so forth
[1:05:11] and on and on
[1:05:12] as it's went around i'm so glad our
[1:05:14] prophet agrees with the history
[1:05:16] because it shows that history is right
[1:05:18] because it agrees with the prophet
[1:05:20] they both agree praise god
[1:05:23] and let me say it like this you know
[1:05:24] bangs bang's former pastor
[1:05:28] went out west to a a a healing revival
[1:05:31] in the pentecostal churches and his wife
[1:05:33] got healed
[1:05:35] he told me that testimony when we were
[1:05:36] there celebrating your
[1:05:38] your dad's healing i mean this is still
[1:05:42] this healing revival is still going on
[1:05:44] like his wife that pastor's wife was
[1:05:46] healed of a kidney problem
[1:05:47] she was going to have to have kidney
[1:05:48] dialysis and she just heard the
[1:05:50] preaching of divine healing
[1:05:52] where'd that start out of our prophet's
[1:05:54] ministry amen
[1:05:57] the denominations are still being
[1:05:59] blessed because of god's prophet and so
[1:06:01] are we
[1:06:01] amen he's being healed and delivered and
[1:06:04] given signs and vindications and wonders
[1:06:06] god is still moving because of this
[1:06:08] revival praise god
[1:06:10] amen
[1:06:14] it's amazing to think about that that
[1:06:17] this revival
[1:06:18] from 46 was worldwide now it's really
[1:06:21] gone down it's really gone down
[1:06:23] but it's still going it started through
[1:06:27] our profit and that but now we're in
[1:06:30] between it's not a big multitude anymore
[1:06:33] now we're just in between they're
[1:06:35] raising see they're calling jesus
[1:06:36] they're waking jesus
[1:06:38] oh thank god bye
[1:06:42] and after the pentecostal church is
[1:06:44] laying its dead slope now see the
[1:06:46] denominations have died but
[1:06:47] there's little revival still going on
[1:06:49] when people get healed
[1:06:51] my intention the desire tonight is to
[1:06:53] awaken that church again
[1:06:54] to the coming of the lord jesus i have
[1:06:56] to rebuke it i have to rebuke sin and
[1:06:58] whatever man it is i don't mean it to
[1:07:00] anybody's denomination
[1:07:01] i have a message
[1:07:06] i'm glad i get to preach the same
[1:07:07] message
[1:07:09] now back to luke now go back to well you
[1:07:12] don't have to go back to luke i
[1:07:13] want to watch my time but i just said i
[1:07:15] don't have to watch my time
[1:07:16] forgive me now notice he says is your
[1:07:18] life worth the gospel this is the first
[1:07:20] sermon i ever listened to
[1:07:21] from brother branham brother dave
[1:07:23] lewellen gave me this tape a cassette
[1:07:25] tape
[1:07:25] that was back in the day before there
[1:07:28] was even cds i think
[1:07:30] he said did you notice in luke 14 there
[1:07:33] was three poles
[1:07:34] or three turns of it when they went out
[1:07:37] first and to call them that were bitten
[1:07:39] to come
[1:07:39] they didn't do it so there went out a
[1:07:41] healing campaign
[1:07:43] went out to get the blind and the heart
[1:07:45] and still there were room so he went out
[1:07:47] and compelled the good
[1:07:49] bad and different they should come in
[1:07:51] now this is powerful to me brother
[1:07:52] johnny
[1:07:53] i've never seen it like this i've heard
[1:07:54] this quote before but i've never seen it
[1:07:57] like this
[1:07:58] all of these scriptures can apply to us
[1:08:01] crossing the sea can apply because we're
[1:08:04] in between revivals
[1:08:06] now only god could do that praise god
[1:08:09] because
[1:08:09] you know it doesn't say anything about a
[1:08:10] rapture there does it
[1:08:12] you know jesus on the sea call and here
[1:08:15] this
[1:08:16] this doesn't say anything about the
[1:08:17] rapture right
[1:08:19] but it's a parable jesus tells and yet
[1:08:22] brother ran by the holy spirit can look
[1:08:24] down into the scripture
[1:08:26] and probably by vision can see how it
[1:08:28] applies to us today
[1:08:31] so let's go to i'm going to go to luke
[1:08:32] 14. if you've got your bible you can
[1:08:35] luke 14 16. this will kind of refresh
[1:08:38] you on the parable
[1:08:40] and this was like the whole point of my
[1:08:42] message was just i was
[1:08:44] i'm so shocked uh to see how
[1:08:47] almost every type in the bible is about
[1:08:49] the rapture
[1:08:50] or the bride or israel returning which
[1:08:53] happens right after the rapture i mean
[1:08:56] it's it's
[1:08:56] it's god did that to give us many
[1:09:00] infallible proofs
[1:09:01] that we're living the right word he's
[1:09:03] with us he's in the boat
[1:09:05] and we just got to stir him up praise
[1:09:06] god amen amen
[1:09:08] luke 14 16.
[1:09:17] this is the parable of the great supper
[1:09:18] now of course this supper represents
[1:09:20] the marriage supper of the lamb but it
[1:09:22] doesn't say that specifically right
[1:09:24] so you have to have a spiritual mind
[1:09:27] hallelujah in other words you have to be
[1:09:28] familiar with revelation 19
[1:09:30] right give honor and be glad for the
[1:09:33] marriage of the bride has come
[1:09:35] and his wife has made herself ready amen
[1:09:39] verse 16. no i'm sorry yeah verse 16.
[1:09:42] luke 14 16.
[1:09:44] then he said to them a certain man made
[1:09:46] a great supper and made many and he said
[1:09:48] his servant at suppertime
[1:09:50] to say to them that we're bid and come
[1:09:51] for all things are now ready
[1:09:53] and they all with one excuse i'm sorry
[1:09:56] one consent began to make
[1:09:57] excuse the first of them i bought a
[1:09:59] piece of ground and it must needs and go
[1:10:01] see it
[1:10:02] i pray thee have me excuse imagine that
[1:10:04] turning down the rapture
[1:10:06] for property in other words turning down
[1:10:09] church in other words they didn't want
[1:10:11] to come hear the message
[1:10:12] turning down the message for more
[1:10:14] property you'd be surprised
[1:10:16] how many people do that
[1:10:19] next excuse verse 19. another said i
[1:10:22] bought five yoke of oxen
[1:10:24] and i approve them i pray thee have me
[1:10:26] excuse look how nice they are
[1:10:27] pray thee please pardon me they're so
[1:10:30] respectful
[1:10:32] to the servants of the lord and now it's
[1:10:34] about working and
[1:10:35] and breaking up the land so they can
[1:10:37] plant they've got they've got
[1:10:38] planting to do verse 20.
[1:10:42] another said i've married a wife and
[1:10:44] therefore i cannot come
[1:10:45] relationships get in the way oftentimes
[1:10:48] don't let any relationship
[1:10:49] get you away from serving jesus christ
[1:10:54] verse 21 now brother answers this now
[1:10:57] is his healing ministry this is amazing
[1:11:01] it's amazing just like jesus in the ship
[1:11:04] right between revivals
[1:11:07] here's brother i said three polls
[1:11:13] verse 21 so that servant came and showed
[1:11:15] his lord these things then the master of
[1:11:16] the house being angry said to his
[1:11:18] servant
[1:11:18] go out quickly in the streets and the
[1:11:20] lanes of the city and bring in hither
[1:11:22] the poor and the main
[1:11:23] and the hot and the blind and the
[1:11:25] servant said lord it is done as thou as
[1:11:27] commanded
[1:11:28] and yet there is room now look at this
[1:11:32] brother ram tells us he says this is
[1:11:34] what is happening
[1:11:36] in his day because they turned it down
[1:11:39] flat imagine that might have been the
[1:11:40] the people that denominated after azusa
[1:11:43] street
[1:11:44] remember that was a genuine revival they
[1:11:45] got the genuine gifts of the holy spirit
[1:11:47] operating
[1:11:48] but then many of them denominated i
[1:11:51] think the oneness church
[1:11:52] denominated in 1919 if my history
[1:11:55] it would be in there but if my his if my
[1:11:57] memory serves me correct
[1:11:58] they saw so right after azusa street
[1:12:00] 1906 those saints got so into the word
[1:12:02] they saw jesus as not three
[1:12:05] those those two dissolved and he became
[1:12:07] one praise god
[1:12:08] and many of them baptized but because
[1:12:10] they got pressure from the nominations
[1:12:12] they created their own denomination and
[1:12:15] it showed they went off in the wrong
[1:12:17] spirit
[1:12:18] and that's why god had to raise up
[1:12:20] brother branham for a healing revival
[1:12:23] they turned it down the man said they
[1:12:25] wanted to protect their revelation say
[1:12:26] we've got it
[1:12:27] and nobody else got it you got to be a
[1:12:29] part of our church or you're not you're
[1:12:30] not
[1:12:31] you're not saved or something like that
[1:12:35] but brother adam says he says so there
[1:12:36] went out a healing campaign
[1:12:38] out to get the halt and the blind
[1:12:42] he said so they don't come to the
[1:12:43] spiritual feast that they're invited to
[1:12:46] do you believe that god has given
[1:12:47] america invitation the last 15 years to
[1:12:49] a great revival
[1:12:51] a spiritual feast did they come no sir
[1:12:54] then to reject
[1:12:55] to come is that life worthy of the
[1:12:57] gospel
[1:12:58] though they call themselves that no
[1:13:01] so you know all the miracles of brother
[1:13:04] branham were to get the people to look
[1:13:06] and see a sign
[1:13:07] but then to hang around and hear the
[1:13:09] voice of the sign
[1:13:11] right that's the whole point of it
[1:13:13] that's why perry green he saw those
[1:13:15] miracles
[1:13:16] at bischo they saw the miracles but they
[1:13:18] said something stirred in them they
[1:13:19] didn't realize there was a prophet
[1:13:21] till a little later and then they
[1:13:23] realized oh
[1:13:24] well he's got a message he's directing
[1:13:26] us to the bible
[1:13:27] brother ed biscuit i saw his testimony
[1:13:29] he had questions about serpent seed all
[1:13:30] these things
[1:13:31] he wrote him out and brother branham
[1:13:32] answered all of them in a conversation
[1:13:35] and then he was convinced it's the word
[1:13:38] so in other words he said yes i'll come
[1:13:40] to the feast praise god
[1:13:41] amen hallelujah but many people even
[1:13:44] after the lame haul and blind were
[1:13:46] healed
[1:13:47] many people didn't come there was still
[1:13:48] room thank god there was still room
[1:13:50] praise god
[1:13:52] thank god there was room for you and i
[1:13:54] amen
[1:13:55] hallelujah it's a spiritual feast sister
[1:13:59] brother it's a spiritual feast today we
[1:14:02] might be in the boat but we must have
[1:14:03] some real good dried goods amen
[1:14:05] there must be some real dried foods here
[1:14:07] fruits and veggies my
[1:14:09] uh dried meats oh must be a great feast
[1:14:12] right here in the boat praise god right
[1:14:13] here on the ship
[1:14:14] but notice church there's one more call
[1:14:18] verse 23 the lord said to the servants
[1:14:20] go out into the highways now look at
[1:14:22] this
[1:14:22] missionary work oh this is this is
[1:14:24] revelation 10
[1:14:25] right here go into the highways and
[1:14:28] hedges and compel them to come in
[1:14:30] that my house may be filled amen in
[1:14:32] other words go out to the very
[1:14:34] outer realms of the kingdom that's what
[1:14:37] revelation 10 11 says
[1:14:39] go prophesy again to every kinder nation
[1:14:42] tongue and people oh look at that
[1:14:46] ah i didn't even see that till now look
[1:14:48] at that
[1:14:50] we are living in between revivals amen
[1:14:54] as far as huge revivals
[1:14:57] we're living in between but we still got
[1:14:59] jesus amen
[1:15:02] church doesn't he show up when you need
[1:15:03] him praise god that's when you wake up
[1:15:05] when you
[1:15:06] shake him say don't you care if i perish
[1:15:08] doesn't he wake up we ought to praise
[1:15:10] god for that amen
[1:15:12] he's still in the ship hallelujah when
[1:15:14] we need him he's always there praise god
[1:15:17] he's my comfort and stay my hope and
[1:15:19] peace my righteousness amen
[1:15:22] he's my all in all just got to stir him
[1:15:25] up
[1:15:27] oh just got to stir up the lord
[1:15:31] in our hearts wake up jesus don't you
[1:15:32] care that we perish of course he cares
[1:15:36] but look what he says he said i want to
[1:15:37] see your face
[1:15:39] i want to see you take that mustard seed
[1:15:41] of faith
[1:15:44] oh thank you love bye this is awesome
[1:15:46] i've never seen it like that before
[1:15:50] oh i mean with this you know most
[1:15:53] some denominations may read this parable
[1:15:55] today do you think they're seeing
[1:15:56] rapture in here
[1:15:57] do you think they're seeing healing
[1:15:58] revival worldwide healing revival
[1:16:01] that even doctors of divinity have to
[1:16:03] attest to
[1:16:04] they can't deny it it's so great because
[1:16:07] it's in the word
[1:16:08] and somebody's got to receive it
[1:16:10] somebody's got to accept it
[1:16:11] somebody's got to fulfill it praise god
[1:16:13] so our ministry is to compel people
[1:16:16] come in before the doors close come into
[1:16:19] this great supper
[1:16:20] our duty is compelling praise god amen
[1:16:24] our duty is to compel let me look that
[1:16:26] word up real quick here
[1:16:29] just give me a second here while you're
[1:16:31] there samson we'll get to samson here
[1:16:33] next by god's grace
[1:16:36] just give me a second here this just
[1:16:37] takes a second
[1:16:39] compel means to necessitate to drive
[1:16:43] someone to
[1:16:44] whether by force now we don't use force
[1:16:48] threats we don't use threats we use
[1:16:50] warnings
[1:16:51] or by permission and treaties or by
[1:16:53] other means
[1:16:54] in other words do as much as we can to
[1:16:56] try to influence people
[1:16:58] come to the word of god come the word of
[1:17:00] god
[1:17:01] that's our ministry how do we believe
[1:17:02] that's your ministry today
[1:17:04] how can we compel how can we invite
[1:17:06] people to come to church
[1:17:07] how can we invite people to to watch a
[1:17:10] video about god or
[1:17:11] or how can we how can we compel anybody
[1:17:13] to be more interested in god amen
[1:17:15] that's our ministry today praise the
[1:17:18] lord
[1:17:22] now samson found himself in between
[1:17:25] revival so now
[1:17:26] brother man uses jesus in the boat
[1:17:28] sleeping in the boat as
[1:17:29] between revivals and now brother brown
[1:17:31] uses samson between revivals
[1:17:33] his first revival was while he had his
[1:17:35] seven locks of hair
[1:17:38] the next revival comes when the seven
[1:17:40] locks grow out praise god
[1:17:44] there's got to be somebody who's afresh
[1:17:45] are you the fresh growth or not
[1:17:48] i believe in i'm part of that seven
[1:17:51] lac growth i'm a part of that fresh uh
[1:17:54] group of hair that fresh glory amen i'm
[1:17:58] a part of that revival group
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:03] now samson thought of his great days
[1:18:06] when there was great days
[1:18:07] the church tonight is thinking back
[1:18:08] about 15 years ago
[1:18:10] to revival divine healing of the victory
[1:18:12] now isn't that what a lot of churches
[1:18:14] we have to be careful not to just use
[1:18:16] brother random's testimonies that's why
[1:18:18] you hear me use bang and
[1:18:19] who is that all the time now a few
[1:18:21] months ago i was using tanya's healing
[1:18:23] aaron's here remember when aaron got
[1:18:24] healed remember when time he got healed
[1:18:26] she couldn't raise her arm
[1:18:28] and we prayed for her she went home and
[1:18:29] she raised her arm and it just was
[1:18:30] healed right there
[1:18:34] different ones remember when marie got
[1:18:36] healed over that other sanctuary she was
[1:18:38] bleeding
[1:18:38] prayed for her and she said it instantly
[1:18:40] stopped right as i prayed for her amen
[1:18:43] praise god what are we trying to do just
[1:18:46] remember see
[1:18:46] we're trying to live in this day we're
[1:18:48] trying we're trying to see
[1:18:50] jesus today thank god for what he did
[1:18:52] but we really want to see him today as
[1:18:54] well praise god
[1:18:56] now you can use the old testimonies oh
[1:18:58] god did it for brother brahma he can do
[1:18:59] it today
[1:19:00] but bring that testimony to today praise
[1:19:02] god
[1:19:03] don't just talk about brother branham
[1:19:04] and have no faith to act upon your
[1:19:06] mustard seed there
[1:19:08] i'm scared to speak the word just
[1:19:10] whatever you got use it
[1:19:12] because if that if all you can do is
[1:19:13] just bow your head and say a
[1:19:15] whisper prayer then you do it use
[1:19:18] anything you got praise god
[1:19:19] use all the faith you got just call
[1:19:21] jesus on the scene
[1:19:23] wake him up let's have faith in god amen
[1:19:26] amen
[1:19:28] compel them
[1:19:36] keep doing now to keep reminding us of
[1:19:37] all the testimonies god has done among
[1:19:39] us
[1:19:40] right we have to do that we have to
[1:19:41] remember that jesus christ is here right
[1:19:43] now
[1:19:45] right and that ought to make you maybe
[1:19:47] sit up and lean forward a little bit or
[1:19:48] something like that
[1:19:50] right he's here in other words someone
[1:19:53] might need prayer at the end of service
[1:19:55] and i don't want to be in a backseating
[1:19:56] condition while we pray for them
[1:19:58] right because i might be like aiken and
[1:19:59] hinder somebody's victory
[1:20:01] you understand what i mean that's why we
[1:20:03] ought to always be on our toes
[1:20:05] we always got to be spiritually alert so
[1:20:08] we keep
[1:20:08] the army of god slugging along slugging
[1:20:12] along victory after victory
[1:20:14] slugging along just uh floating along

[1:20:45] now father as samson was willing to die

[1:23:01] that was
[1:23:03] 17 years before my birthday i like that
[1:23:06] that's why it's one of my favorite
[1:23:07] sermons it was preaching my birthday 17
[1:23:10] years before though
[1:23:11] he said lord i want to see this happen
[1:23:13] maybe it will just once more lord
[1:23:15] one more great move in the spirit one
[1:23:17] more time lord and the church might
[1:23:19] receive
[1:23:20] the rapturing faith to go in so when
[1:23:23] brother brandon preached samson his
[1:23:25] objective was to say listen you need to
[1:23:27] revive in your own life
[1:23:28] but there's going to come a greater
[1:23:29] revival the bride's revival praise god
[1:23:33] rapturing faith because he was between
[1:23:35] revivals
[1:23:36] and he just had to remember that he had
[1:23:38] that covenant
[1:23:39] we just got to remember that we've got
[1:23:41] the blood of jesus covering
[1:23:42] all of our sins amen and eternal love
[1:23:46] amen
[1:23:46] and eternal mercy favor with god we have
[1:23:50] his covenant we have his promise
[1:23:52] he's unfailing he cannot fail his grace
[1:23:54] is sufficient
[1:23:55] his mercies are new every morning amen
[1:23:58] we've got his covenant
[1:24:03] so now we see two scriptural witnesses
[1:24:06] three where you see them between
[1:24:09] revivals
[1:24:11] but they still got access to jesus wake
[1:24:13] him up
[1:24:14] wake him up remember you may not
[1:24:17] remember this bill graham brother ram
[1:24:19] noticed the spiritual drive he noticed
[1:24:20] the revival calming down
[1:24:22] even amongst message believers he says
[1:24:25] this he says
[1:24:26] and us is out in arizona i use this
[1:24:28] numerous times i see we're drying
[1:24:32] we sit here i get amongst my brethren
[1:24:34] they talk with me
[1:24:35] uh he said i i always i watch them
[1:24:39] feeling out there with the spirit to see
[1:24:40] what's wrong with the people
[1:24:45] i begin to see us all reclining getting
[1:24:47] away from the spirit
[1:24:50] even brother branham right this is three
[1:24:52] weeks before he died
[1:24:53] he's seeing the people get further away
[1:24:55] from god the revival dying down
[1:24:58] jesus sleeping on the boat he said but
[1:25:00] what do we need
[1:25:02] he said we must worship in the spirit we
[1:25:05] must
[1:25:05] wake up the holy spirit amen it's got to
[1:25:08] be in our hearts
[1:25:09] or we can't rightly present it to the
[1:25:11] people the spirit has to pack the
[1:25:13] message itself
[1:25:14] and i'm trusting and believing in every
[1:25:16] one of you to be a real
[1:25:17] real christian now i forgot to read this
[1:25:20] part
[1:25:21] brother brahm said if you feel like i do
[1:25:23] i'm so hungry to see the spirit of god
[1:25:25] moving i just can't hardly stand it
[1:25:28] some experiences i had up in the
[1:25:29] mountain just to feel that once again
[1:25:31] that something that when i was first
[1:25:33] saved was so glorious to my heart
[1:25:35] see he wanted to feel that the initial
[1:25:38] revival again he wanted to feel he
[1:25:40] wanted to feel fresh
[1:25:42] amen amen
[1:25:45] and he prayed for it now but look in his
[1:25:48] last sermon that's a good point
[1:25:50] brother man's last sermon communion look
[1:25:52] what he says
[1:25:54] you know the hour will soon arise
[1:25:57] when right among us the holy spirit will
[1:25:59] speak out like it did in
[1:26:00] ananias and sapphira remember that hour
[1:26:03] is arriving now church we've seen this
[1:26:07] in a minor level here
[1:26:09] someone was criticizing me a few years
[1:26:11] ago i went in prayer to their seat and i
[1:26:13] rebuked that critical spirit in the name
[1:26:15] of jesus christ
[1:26:16] and then the following sunday the
[1:26:18] brother brian came in and preached it
[1:26:19] and told that person to leave and they
[1:26:21] left
[1:26:24] ananias and sapphira was the holy spirit
[1:26:26] discerning the wrong spirit
[1:26:27] and packing it out of the church so see
[1:26:31] what
[1:26:31] this is in a minor way in a minor way
[1:26:34] this is returning praise god there's
[1:26:37] going to be
[1:26:38] a pure word bride amen where she just
[1:26:41] believes the word amen
[1:26:43] amen just the word and any spirit
[1:26:46] contrary
[1:26:48] will be driven out by the holy spirit
[1:26:51] you don't you probably don't remember
[1:26:52] this
[1:26:53] if you do you got a great memory tim
[1:26:54] hayton came to our church around 2013
[1:26:56] 2014 it's been a long time i don't know
[1:26:59] if you remember he just gotten back
[1:27:01] from a trip to africa and he said he
[1:27:03] visited numerous churches he said they
[1:27:04] went out i forget which country was
[1:27:06] in africa but they went out into some
[1:27:08] country churches
[1:27:10] and he said the brothers he said he
[1:27:12] watched as the pastor
[1:27:13] they were all praying before the service
[1:27:14] before the church even service started
[1:27:17] and
[1:27:18] uh the one of the uh members uh called
[1:27:21] out somebody's sin thus saith the lord
[1:27:22] someone was committing adultery in the
[1:27:24] church
[1:27:25] called out right there where the people
[1:27:26] were sitting there and the person had to
[1:27:27] repent
[1:27:29] i mean so that proves this can happen
[1:27:32] praise god but the people got to be in
[1:27:35] tune with the holy spirit praise god
[1:27:38] see look brother i'm expecting this to
[1:27:40] return this is the fullness of pentecost
[1:27:43] amen
[1:27:43] we mostly think about miracles but but
[1:27:45] see god is going to be purifying the
[1:27:47] bride as well praise god
[1:27:50] the fullness of pentecost was also
[1:27:51] purity
[1:27:53] right and all the unbelief and all the
[1:27:55] sin cleaned out
[1:27:56] she's got to be washed in the waters of
[1:27:58] the word amen
[1:28:01] oh i love it it's arriving
[1:28:06] here's what i want to also share as well
[1:28:08] now you're saying about revival brother
[1:28:09] man you know why you're doing that
[1:28:12] so i was going to preach it
[1:28:17] now see brother also says so the the
[1:28:19] world the national revival
[1:28:21] from 1946 has died down
[1:28:24] but there's still revival fires burning
[1:28:28] now this is a long quote this is a lot
[1:28:30] here okay bro let's talk about when the
[1:28:32] holy ghost comes into you
[1:28:34] he says we've already resurrected
[1:28:36] dynamics and mechanics has gone to work
[1:28:38] quicken us
[1:28:39] and we're quickened up in the presence
[1:28:40] of god where his spirit is
[1:28:42] we're see together in heavenly places
[1:28:45] he says uh the bride she'll do exactly
[1:28:48] what's predicted for her
[1:28:49] she won't be a laodicean not by no means
[1:28:52] a lukewarm
[1:28:54] but she'll be on fire for god
[1:28:58] amen she'll be moving on in the spirit
[1:29:03] praise god that's what i want to do i
[1:29:06] want to stay close to the holy spirit so
[1:29:07] the holy spirit
[1:29:08] can show me new things it can help me
[1:29:11] grow for praying for the sick
[1:29:13] or speaking the word or preaching the
[1:29:14] gospel i want to stay close to the holy
[1:29:16] spirit stay on fire
[1:29:17] so i don't get lukewarm
[1:29:21] so i can keep compelling people come to
[1:29:23] the rapture
[1:29:24] come to the message amen i want to keep
[1:29:26] compelling you too praise god you want
[1:29:28] to compel people
[1:29:29] that's our duty that's our ministry this
[1:29:31] hour
[1:29:32] compel them to come here's the
[1:29:36] uh yeah here's what i like he's praying
[1:29:39] this is uh
[1:29:41] february 65. he's praying at the end of
[1:29:44] a service he said lord there in your
[1:29:45] hands altar call
[1:29:47] oh god we don't want our understanding
[1:29:49] we want your understanding somebody
[1:29:51] would say amen to that amen
[1:29:52] give them to us lord and may the revival
[1:29:54] here's what i love
[1:29:55] come within our souls amen that's the
[1:29:58] greatest revival we can have amen
[1:30:00] because it changes our nature we don't
[1:30:02] have an unbelief nature
[1:30:04] we have a nature of belief so when we
[1:30:06] have our mind battles we just got to
[1:30:07] pray
[1:30:08] and the power of the holy spirit our
[1:30:09] soul works its way out to our minds
[1:30:11] and then we get the victory in our minds
[1:30:13] and then we get victory over the flesh
[1:30:15] and we can bring these bodies into
[1:30:17] subjection to the word of god amen
[1:30:20] till this pack of people will just one
[1:30:23] heart and one accord
[1:30:24] granted father grant these things while
[1:30:26] we pray in jesus christ's name
[1:30:29] see brother and believe in revival today
[1:30:31] in your soul
[1:30:35] next thinking man's filter jesus
[1:30:39] cried blind pharisees the holy spirit in
[1:30:41] the heart tonight christ blind laodicea
[1:30:43] how oft god would give you revival but
[1:30:45] now your time has come it's too late now
[1:30:48] it's all about laodicea oh united states
[1:30:51] that god would have hovered you as a
[1:30:52] hand desert brood but you would not
[1:30:54] now this voice is going from coast to
[1:30:56] coast north to south east to west
[1:30:58] how god would have hovered you but you
[1:30:59] would not now your time
[1:31:01] has come now look this is what
[1:31:04] this is his prayer i love this lord hide
[1:31:07] me in the rock of ages
[1:31:08] god let me let me breathe upon me lord
[1:31:12] spear living god breathe on me take let
[1:31:15] me take god's filter and live under that
[1:31:17] lord let me breathe the fresh
[1:31:19] air of the holy ghost into my lungs in
[1:31:22] my soul
[1:31:23] each day that i what i sin not
[1:31:26] against you o lord breathe on me holy
[1:31:29] spirit breathe on me
[1:31:31] this is the revival they turned down
[1:31:34] the revival is a daily revival praise
[1:31:37] god
[1:31:37] in the soul where we learn not to sin
[1:31:40] against god
[1:31:41] but to obey god amen oh it's glorious
[1:31:47] trying to close here this is what the
[1:31:49] whole thing that inspired me after
[1:31:50] talking with brother amen and i'm just
[1:31:52] going to do a couple services on this
[1:31:53] night
[1:31:54] lord willing i think the the chapter i
[1:31:56] wrote chapter four about about the
[1:31:59] revelation of the church as the bride i
[1:32:02] think i'll pick it up on that later
[1:32:03] because it ties perfectly in
[1:32:05] you'll see because every woman can type
[1:32:08] the bride somehow right
[1:32:09] she either types israel mother harlot
[1:32:12] or the bride us i mean every woman you
[1:32:15] know just start with eve you know
[1:32:16] pretty soon every woman
[1:32:20] that's what brother ram said
[1:32:24] and he's talking about the seventh seal
[1:32:25] when the seventh seal opened there was
[1:32:27] silence
[1:32:27] uh brotherham says the seventh seal was
[1:32:30] the coming of the lord the rapture
[1:32:32] so the literal opening of the seventh
[1:32:33] seal the reality opening of the seventh
[1:32:35] seal will be the rapture
[1:32:37] because that's the final mystery praise
[1:32:38] god and then that just
[1:32:41] opens it up and then everything else
[1:32:42] just that's what we're waiting on that
[1:32:44] final mystery of the seventh seal the
[1:32:46] reality opening
[1:32:48] he said even the son himself don't know
[1:32:50] what's gonna happen god has all this to
[1:32:51] himself
[1:32:52] it's a secret that's the reason there
[1:32:53] was silence in heaven for the space half
[1:32:55] an hour
[1:32:56] he said the seven thunders under their
[1:32:58] voices john was even forbidden to write
[1:33:00] see the coming of the lord
[1:33:01] that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet
[1:33:03] how he will come and when he will come
[1:33:04] it's a good thing that he doesn't
[1:33:07] now here's what struck me this quote
[1:33:09] came to me last sunday
[1:33:11] he has showed or revealed it in every
[1:33:13] type that's in the bible
[1:33:15] what the seventh seal the rapture
[1:33:19] the rapture second coming of jesus
[1:33:21] christ is in every type in the bible
[1:33:23] almost yeah almost
[1:33:27] therefore the bible is the entire i'm
[1:33:30] sorry the revelation of god's
[1:33:32] mystery in christ huh the entire bible
[1:33:34] is an expression of one goal god
[1:33:36] had one purpose he wanted to achieve an
[1:33:37] entire bible and all the acts of the
[1:33:39] believers in the bible has been in time
[1:33:41] and expressing what god's great goal is
[1:33:43] and now in this last days reviewed it
[1:33:45] and shows it and god's help you'll see
[1:33:47] it right here this morning when the lord
[1:33:48] has had in his mind
[1:33:50] all along and has expressed it now you
[1:33:52] know the threefold purpose we've been
[1:33:53] over this numerous times you probably
[1:33:55] heard other preachers preach it
[1:33:56] brother brahm said god's purpose was to
[1:33:58] get preeminence in the sun
[1:34:00] that is bride and restore eden
[1:34:04] god so brother says all types either
[1:34:06] point to christ
[1:34:08] the bride or restoring the new jerusalem
[1:34:11] amen which is israel right israel is a
[1:34:14] part of this too right israel
[1:34:15] gets 144 000 and then the millennial
[1:34:17] temple and then the new jerusalem
[1:34:19] it's all part of that together now i
[1:34:22] don't
[1:34:22] i just had just a brief moment to write
[1:34:24] down we see the rapture in the entire
[1:34:27] bible
[1:34:28] enoch
[1:34:31] abraham and sarah but ram said that was
[1:34:33] the rapture that was the last sign when
[1:34:35] god
[1:34:36] uh revealed the secret of sarah's heart
[1:34:38] that was brother ram's son of man
[1:34:39] ministry
[1:34:40] the last sign before the rapture thus
[1:34:42] saith the lord
[1:34:44] that means isaac's birth was the rapture
[1:34:48] whoever would have found that none of us
[1:34:50] would have found that unless god brought
[1:34:51] it with us saith the lord
[1:34:53] at least or rebecca praise god joseph
[1:34:56] revealing himself remember
[1:34:58] he put his wife out and the marriage
[1:35:00] supper before he went to the 144
[1:35:02] 000. he said honey i'm putting you in
[1:35:04] heaven as i reveal myself to my 144
[1:35:06] 000 down here on earth oh my glory
[1:35:10] the token the death angel which is of
[1:35:12] course the third exodus
[1:35:14] now i'm not going to go through all
[1:35:15] these rahab in the token which again is
[1:35:17] an exodus it's an exodus type
[1:35:20] because remember church this even
[1:35:23] even moses bringing israel that all
[1:35:26] everything in there can't be tied to the
[1:35:27] rapture because remember a mixed
[1:35:30] multitude came out
[1:35:32] does that type are there gonna be mixed
[1:35:34] people going the rapture that aren't
[1:35:35] born again
[1:35:36] no sir they gotta have oil so see
[1:35:40] church everybody understand we gotta be
[1:35:41] real careful with quotes and types
[1:35:43] right you gotta be really careful with
[1:35:45] types
[1:35:48] see so we have to apply that type the
[1:35:50] mixed multitude we have to apply that
[1:35:52] type to your earthly exodus
[1:35:53] right like anyone was thinking about
[1:35:55] leaving egypt remember that
[1:35:58] that's your that's getting saved so some
[1:36:00] people think they're getting saved when
[1:36:01] they still love egypt right
[1:36:03] they just left out because they saw
[1:36:06] somebody under the real token and then
[1:36:08] of course they run to the token as well
[1:36:10] but they weren't themselves really
[1:36:12] believers
[1:36:14] so see you've got to be careful with the
[1:36:15] types ray having the token
[1:36:18] uh before gentile destruction there's
[1:36:20] going to be a
[1:36:21] gentile bride who's saved from the
[1:36:23] destruction of the city praise god
[1:36:26] by the red cord of the token the blood
[1:36:28] of jesus amen
[1:36:30] and then samson's once more lord like i
[1:36:32] said i didn't devote much time to this i
[1:36:34] was doing the other quote studies on the
[1:36:35] boat
[1:36:36] and then samson and then the three calls
[1:36:39] uh to the marriage supper
[1:36:41] and we'll get to that we see the rapture
[1:36:42] the entire bible that's what
[1:36:44] you know i had to limit chapter four it
[1:36:45] was so long brother johnny
[1:36:47] because i could have wrote about almost
[1:36:48] every woman in the bible
[1:36:50] as hell as a type of christ almost
[1:36:53] almost every woman
[1:36:55] right brother ram said eve represented
[1:36:58] the early church
[1:37:00] she was engaged to christ but she fell
[1:37:04] but she got redeemed see praise god
[1:37:08] i mean we we can see live you can use
[1:37:10] all of these
[1:37:12] and they're all to point us to one thing
[1:37:14] it's all coming to jesus christ
[1:37:16] amen he's the headstone he's the
[1:37:18] capstone coming down from heaven amen
[1:37:21] and everything will be gathered up into
[1:37:22] christ
[1:37:26] this means there's much scripture being
[1:37:28] fulfilled right now
[1:37:30] now i made this years ago do you
[1:37:31] remember this anybody remember that
[1:37:36] brother ram said it's you know i've
[1:37:38] heard preachers over the years it's lamp
[1:37:39] trimming time
[1:37:40] it is matthew 25 right the bright the
[1:37:43] wise version it's lamb trimming time
[1:37:45] it's malachi 4 time
[1:37:47] yeah my heart needs restored to the
[1:37:49] pentecostal saints
[1:37:50] it's uniting time it is the world's
[1:37:52] uniting to
[1:37:54] antichrist we're uniting the word christ
[1:37:56] the moves on the bride it's that time
[1:37:58] yeah
[1:38:00] it's walking with god it's enoch time
[1:38:03] it's like everything is our time
[1:38:05] everything in the bible is pointing to
[1:38:07] us
[1:38:07] what we should be doing now falling more
[1:38:09] in love with jesus right
[1:38:11] trimming our limbs walking with god
[1:38:13] being the friend of god loving god
[1:38:15] being a faithful bride to jesus laying
[1:38:18] in the friends of the son that's matthew
[1:38:20] 13 the parables
[1:38:21] right the tear doesn't bow the wheat
[1:38:23] bows and lays in the presence of the son
[1:38:26] jesus said this type is for the end time
[1:38:29] the end of the world
[1:38:31] every times point does oh i say like
[1:38:33] almost every type is pointing to us
[1:38:37] oh this blew my mind these last few days
[1:38:40] i think you know why it makes me nervous
[1:38:42] because like i'm a person i want to get
[1:38:43] everything about a subject i want all
[1:38:45] the quotes on marriage and divorce and i
[1:38:46] got them too
[1:38:48] well most of them i'm in all the quotes
[1:38:50] on the rapture now brother amen when i
[1:38:51] seen all this
[1:38:52] now i don't have all the quotes on the
[1:38:53] rapture now i don't have all the
[1:38:55] scriptures on the rapture and it makes
[1:38:56] me nervous
[1:38:57] i start shaking in my uh my knees get a
[1:38:59] little wobbly like oh i feel like i'm
[1:39:01] unprepared like i don't really know it
[1:39:02] but i also have grace and know that god
[1:39:05] in god's appointed time
[1:39:06] he'll reveal it even then praise god
[1:39:08] amen
[1:39:10] i'm that kind i want to have a document
[1:39:11] i don't have a that has all the quotes
[1:39:13] and all the scriptures
[1:39:15] takes away all doubt but this just shook
[1:39:18] me up a little bit like wow now i got to
[1:39:20] use
[1:39:20] jesus in the boat i got to use sansom
[1:39:23] samson i got to use the marriage parable
[1:39:26] and you can but it's glorious to us
[1:39:28] isn't it
[1:39:29] it's glorious to us to us
[1:39:37] now here's one i just i'm trying to
[1:39:39] close here let me set timer 10 minutes
[1:39:44] thanks for putting up with me church i
[1:39:45] appreciate it i didn't preach last week
[1:39:47] so i kind of been ready to go
[1:39:50] thanks for being merciful to me
[1:39:54] now we know right noah
[1:39:58] types the foolish virgin let me skip
[1:39:59] ahead
[1:40:01] like here's a few things noah usually
[1:40:03] types the foolish virgin
[1:40:04] right and there's quotes on that i don't
[1:40:07] have them here but it'd be very easy to
[1:40:09] show you look just listen to the seals
[1:40:10] the man talks about it numerous times
[1:40:12] because enoch types the wise version
[1:40:14] right
[1:40:16] now look i was looking at my my timeline
[1:40:18] brother johnny where are we talking
[1:40:19] about the timeline
[1:40:20] enoch was raptured 987 years after sin
[1:40:24] entered the world so after the sin the
[1:40:26] garden he was raptured about night about
[1:40:28] a thousand years after that
[1:40:30] adam lived uh 930 years so enoch
[1:40:34] outlived adam by 57 years
[1:40:37] that means enoch could have fellowship
[1:40:39] with adam for over
[1:40:41] 308 years
[1:40:45] can you imagine the fellowship they
[1:40:47] could have had don't you think that
[1:40:49] raised enoch's faith a little bit
[1:40:51] the first i'm talking with the first
[1:40:53] adam i mean all the world around him is
[1:40:56] like
[1:40:56] oh you're you're you're a holy roller
[1:40:59] thinking there's a rapture you're a
[1:41:00] but he's like talking to the original
[1:41:02] adam you saw the pillar of fire
[1:41:04] the pillar of fire came down to talk to
[1:41:06] you he's like yes he did
[1:41:07] yes and he probably started crying i
[1:41:09] failed god's grace
[1:41:11] look at all this but enoch's like no
[1:41:13] there's a purpose adam there's a purpose
[1:41:15] be encouraged like we all need
[1:41:18] encouragement right
[1:41:19] for our mistakes 308 years
[1:41:22] so enoch was born when adam was a young
[1:41:25] 600
[1:41:26] healthy 622 years old
[1:41:29] now isn't it interesting adam went off
[1:41:31] the earth 9 30 right
[1:41:33] so god god had the first adam
[1:41:36] die right god took that first man
[1:41:40] he left in other words he let the first
[1:41:42] man die and then just 57 years later
[1:41:45] he took the first man to heaven by
[1:41:47] rapture praise god
[1:41:49] the first man died but god said i'm
[1:41:52] going to redeem him
[1:41:52] by taking another man straight to heaven
[1:41:55] and i'm going to defeat death
[1:41:57] amen they just seen the first adam die
[1:41:59] but then they showed god showed
[1:42:01] i'm gonna allow man to cheat death and
[1:42:03] not die
[1:42:04] through enoch's type and that types you
[1:42:06] and i the seventh from ian adam praise
[1:42:09] god
[1:42:10] the seventh church age praise god the
[1:42:12] seven locks ahead
[1:42:13] right then it ties amen if we can just
[1:42:15] see it and just believe it praise god
[1:42:22] well i was pretty excited about that
[1:42:23] this morning i don't know about you but
[1:42:24] that that really did something for me
[1:42:25] this morning
[1:42:30] yeah we have to be careful how we use
[1:42:31] types and quotes so just a couple more
[1:42:33] things
[1:42:34] so how many know brother or how many how
[1:42:37] many don't know as a foolish virgin type
[1:42:39] well there is an aspect where you can
[1:42:40] use him for the bride
[1:42:42] because brother abraham said noah's ark
[1:42:44] types you
[1:42:46] getting into christ
[1:42:51] brother jesse don't preach to me about
[1:42:53] noah and i don't think anybody says that
[1:42:55] don't preach to me about noah he's the
[1:42:56] foolish version well brother branham
[1:42:58] said
[1:42:59] noah can type jesus christ
[1:43:02] just depends how you use it right
[1:43:05] look what he says next brother is
[1:43:07] preaching the token the first time he
[1:43:08] preached token
[1:43:09] remember he said this is one of the
[1:43:10] highlights of his entire ministry
[1:43:12] and all outside of that ark perish all
[1:43:15] outside the token the blood
[1:43:16] perish everyone everyone outside the
[1:43:18] token of the holy ghost will perish
[1:43:20] no matter how good how much church
[1:43:22] members there's a lot of them in days of
[1:43:24] noah there was a lot of them in the days
[1:43:25] of moses
[1:43:26] but a man that failed to apply the blood
[1:43:28] as the as the token was he perished
[1:43:30] those who failed to get into the ark
[1:43:33] perish
[1:43:33] those who fail to come into christ for
[1:43:36] he
[1:43:37] is the ark i can use noah
[1:43:40] and i can use him it's a type of the
[1:43:42] bride get in the ark before the door
[1:43:45] closes
[1:43:45] get into jesus christ get born again
[1:43:48] praise god
[1:43:49] but does he overall type the bride no
[1:43:52] but you can use now look you can i said
[1:43:54] it's in every type of the bible
[1:43:56] oh it's glorious hallelujah so i can
[1:43:59] still use noah
[1:44:00] for us today which means forget all the
[1:44:03] the marrying and eating and drinking
[1:44:05] right the world
[1:44:06] forget all those things build a life
[1:44:08] amen
[1:44:09] build an escape let your testimony build
[1:44:12] or let your life
[1:44:12] build a testimony that you can enter
[1:44:15] into that testimony
[1:44:16] and you can be safe in christ when the
[1:44:18] storms come praise god
[1:44:20] oh hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:44:25] so see if someone says don't preach to
[1:44:26] me about no that's foolish virgins say
[1:44:28] well there is a type for that
[1:44:31] there is a die for that
[1:44:34] and then he says see the song we were
[1:44:36] saying this morning by one spirit
[1:44:37] we're all baptized into one body
[1:44:42] the token is the door for you are in
[1:44:46] christ
[1:44:48] now last thing i want to bring this out
[1:44:49] before we close
[1:44:51] see there's a lot of people that will
[1:44:52] cling to a quote like this one
[1:44:55] brother branham says this isn't the
[1:44:58] third seal
[1:45:00] they'll say let's say the bride hasn't
[1:45:01] had a revival yet
[1:45:03] see there's been no revival here no
[1:45:05] manifestation of god disturbed the bride
[1:45:06] yet
[1:45:07] we're looking for it it will take those
[1:45:08] seven unknown thunders thunders back
[1:45:10] there
[1:45:11] to wake her up again he will send it he
[1:45:12] promised it now watch
[1:45:15] she was dead now this was true when he
[1:45:17] said it
[1:45:18] the bride hadn't been awakened because
[1:45:20] the book had not been opened yet
[1:45:22] right the sevens of the book was still
[1:45:25] sealed
[1:45:26] how could she have a revival she
[1:45:27] couldn't hear the voices of those seals
[1:45:30] which which took her back to all the
[1:45:32] word of god revealed every mystery
[1:45:35] and but people will just they'll hang on
[1:45:37] this and say the bride hasn't had a
[1:45:38] revival
[1:45:40] and yet brother ram later says she has
[1:45:41] had a revival
[1:45:44] see be careful brother later taught the
[1:45:47] thunders were revealed
[1:45:49] so see they'll use this quote and say we
[1:45:50] don't know the seven thunders but
[1:45:52] brother ram said the thunders are
[1:45:53] fulfilled
[1:45:54] they're already revealed they're the
[1:45:56] revelations of the seven seals
[1:46:00] right but they'll hang on that quote
[1:46:03] see they gotta take it back to the word
[1:46:06] or they'll say
[1:46:07] or they don't know brother ram later
[1:46:09] said the bride was awakened see remember
[1:46:11] look
[1:46:12] he says she needs the thunders to wake
[1:46:15] her up and they'll say see the bride's
[1:46:16] still sleeping i'm not sleeping
[1:46:19] i'm not sleeping i see what's going on
[1:46:20] in this world i'm awake
[1:46:22] i'm a child of the light praise god i've
[1:46:25] heard the shout brother man praise god
[1:46:27] i'm trimming my lamp i make sure i got
[1:46:29] the extra oil i'm ready to go out to
[1:46:31] meet the bridegroom i'm not sleeping i'm
[1:46:33] awake amen
[1:46:34] amen look at brother says
[1:46:41] they said brother bran well then seven
[1:46:43] thunders you see wouldn't them seven
[1:46:44] thunders blasting out won't that be a
[1:46:46] revelation give to some man
[1:46:47] i said no sir it would be adding
[1:46:49] something to it or taking something from
[1:46:51] it
[1:46:52] see they were trying to tell brother and
[1:46:53] write your own bible like they did
[1:46:55] joseph smith
[1:46:56] brother man said no the revelation of
[1:46:58] the seven thunders have to be in the
[1:46:59] bible
[1:47:00] and it's all revealed in there then the
[1:47:03] seven
[1:47:04] and the seven seals opened up the
[1:47:06] revelation of what that was
[1:47:08] that's what it was see it's still in the
[1:47:10] word oh i'm so glad it's in the word
[1:47:12] you see you can't get out of that word
[1:47:13] it won't leave the word but god's spirit
[1:47:15] will never leave that word
[1:47:16] it'll stay right with the word by
[1:47:18] blinding some and opening the eyes of
[1:47:20] others it'll always do that
[1:47:25] the man in the church age book says his
[1:47:28] ministry is going to do two things turn
[1:47:29] the hearts
[1:47:30] and then reveal the mysteries of the
[1:47:32] seven thunders in revelation 10 which
[1:47:34] are the revelations contained
[1:47:36] in the seven seals hallelujah
[1:47:40] now this is a long one brother adam says
[1:47:42] in recognizing your day my last quote
[1:47:44] let's stand here let's get you standing
[1:47:45] here i appreciate your patience
[1:47:48] well the man said the denominations are
[1:47:49] saying fast and pray there's a
[1:47:51] uh he said we're going to have a great
[1:47:55] breaking of the day
[1:47:56] there's a great thing going to happen
[1:47:57] all of you pray pray pray he said we're
[1:47:59] not too late yet remember this quote
[1:48:01] all the denominations are saying we're
[1:48:02] going to have a new day we're going to
[1:48:04] have a break-in of the day
[1:48:05] and brother man says why do they do that
[1:48:07] why do they do that
[1:48:08] they want a great awakening they're
[1:48:10] crying believing that there will be an
[1:48:11] awakening
[1:48:12] they're good people why is it what have
[1:48:14] they done they have not recognized the
[1:48:16] awakening of the bride
[1:48:18] see in 63 said they're not awake yet but
[1:48:20] now he says
[1:48:21] they they're fasting and praying but
[1:48:23] they haven't recognized the bride is
[1:48:24] awake now
[1:48:26] she's awake and i remember i show you
[1:48:27] those quotes we have revival in our
[1:48:29] souls
[1:48:30] now say like this when divine healing
[1:48:32] takes place like it happened on tuesday
[1:48:33] night in our church
[1:48:34] and the saints said right
[1:48:37] monday or tuesday night divine healing
[1:48:39] took place in our church just on tuesday
[1:48:41] night praise god
[1:48:42] what is it it's a continuance of the
[1:48:44] revival
[1:48:45] god started just on a smaller realm it
[1:48:48] starts in the soul but then it re
[1:48:50] works its way out to the flesh praise
[1:48:52] god where we see people healed
[1:48:55] where we see people saved isn't that
[1:48:58] awesome oh
[1:49:00] i'm just i just got joy and speakable
[1:49:02] full of glory today
[1:49:04] to see these scriptures i've never seen
[1:49:06] them but ramsay you see the type
[1:49:08] in almost everything in the entire bible
[1:49:11] oh church we can just open up our bibles
[1:49:13] and see great promises

[1:49:26] bride

[1:49:31] bill graham said by being a christian
[1:49:32] they feel the pull of the hour but they
[1:49:34] haven't recognized what's been done
[1:49:36] that's what's making them feel that way
[1:49:37] they know something's supposed to happen
[1:49:39] but they're looking for in a way off in
