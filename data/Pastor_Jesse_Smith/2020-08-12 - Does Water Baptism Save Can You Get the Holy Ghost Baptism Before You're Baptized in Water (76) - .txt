TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the mattress name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's two questions about water baptism the first is does water baptism save you and the second is can you get the holy ghost baptism before you're baptized in water here's the answers according to scripture first does water baptism save you the answer is no the act of being baptized in water does not save you we've all known people that have been baptized but then have fallen away from the faith you're saved by grace through faith according to ephesians 2 verses 8 through 10 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them this means you are saved when you repent of your sins and believe in faith jesus died for your sins and you trust jesus's righteousness to save you you're saved at that moment but after a person is saved he or she will gladly be baptized if given the opportunity here's jesus saying those who already believe meaning they have already repented and loved him and his work on the cross will obey and be baptized in water in mark 16 16. he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned a second proof that the act of being baptized doesn't save is jesus's saving grace to the repentant thief on the cross matthew chapter 27 verses 41 to 47 show how this condemned thief was mocking jesus with the chief priests scribes elders and the lost thief likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and the elders said he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god and notice verse 44 the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth see both thieves were mocking jesus but the holy spirit must have come to him and he realized jesus's innocence the saved thief must have repented for he began standing up for jesus and judged him as righteous this is found in luke 23 verses 39 to 43. the saved thief said thus thou not fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the dew reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and jesus said unto him verily i say unto you today shalt thou be with me in paradise you learn from the scripture that jesus saved this repentant thief promising him eternal life to be with jesus in paradise and yet he was never baptized since you know hebrews 13 verse 8 jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever you know god has always and will always save by grace through faith the repentant thief was saved by grace through his faith in christ and would have been baptized if he had had the chance this saved thief was one of the last persons saved under the old testament for when jesus died he said it is finished the old testament was finished the veil covering of the holiest of holies was torn and the new testament began in the new testament god was going to use his holy spirit to lead men into the presence of god now called the baptism of the holy ghost rather than the physical room of the holiest of holies the unchanging god still saves by grace through faith in the new testament question number two can you get the holy ghost baptism before you're baptized in water according to the bible the answer is yes you can be baptized with the holy ghost before you're baptized in water cornelius and his house experienced this in acts chapter 10. the whole chapter is needed to understand this truth but verses 44-48 states specifically that the holy ghost fell upon corneas house while peter spoke to them and then peter commanded them to get baptized in water and they obeyed so we learn these truths first the holy ghost can fill the souls of believers who are unaware of god's desire for them to be baptized in water corneos and his house were either unaware of jesus's request for water baptism or were unable to find a preacher to baptize them in water second a person who is truly baptized with the holy ghost and born again will gladly obey all the word these newly born again saints didn't refuse to obey part of the bible commands no they gladly obeyed and so will all those who are truly born again if this is confusing please view my two-part series about the three works of grace this will help you understand when a person is ready to be filled with the holy ghost and it details god's three-step cleansing process he uses in order to fill a person's soul it's called justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost here are two quotes from god's prophet brother branham that support these answers on this the bread i video jesus is the bread of life that's true but this is a symbol just like baptism baptism doesn't save you baptism is only a sign that you're witnessing to the congregation that you believe in the death burial and resurrection of jesus christ it doesn't save you water will not save you it's your faith that saves you but baptism is an order and it must be carried out because god can't save be baptized and then turned around said doesn't need to be done he cannot issue taking communion and turn around and say you know neither taking it you've got to do it a preacher if he come here preaching divine healing by laying on hands you'd have to preach that to you out of the word his hands laying home with being more than baptism or anything else you have to have faith if you haven't got faith you just go down a god center and come up a wet one you're still a sinner if your heart hasn't been changed the baptism means nothing just an outward expression that an inward work of grace has been done and no matter how many times preachers lay their hands on you how much they do this it doesn't mean a thing until you really believe it that all soul grace is the truth then why could anyone criticize and say that grace is wrong that we're saved by works we are saved by grace not through faith not by works works shows that you have been saved but what saves you the grace of god grace saves you grace is what god does for you works is what you do for god to show appreciation what god did for you but by grace are you saved not one time did he ever have to wait after that why peter speak these words to the gentiles the holy ghost alone even before there was that time is that right well acts 10 49 give us evangelists in the world today not those who persuade and prove and make denominational children god raise yourself up some children have the people are to pray i'm thinking of carne elise's house it never happened to a gentile before but they were fasting and praying and when that man of god that prophet stood there and while he spake these words a holy ghost fell on him that heard the word god grant that kind of a meeting while peter spake these words oh god they were ready they were fasting they were waiting they were sincere they were also concerning water baptism i recommend you watch my video called water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ so if you haven't been baptized in the literal name of the lord jesus christ you can obey god's word and do that please contact me if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
