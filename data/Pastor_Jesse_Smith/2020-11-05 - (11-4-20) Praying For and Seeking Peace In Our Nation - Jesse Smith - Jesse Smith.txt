ask that you'll speak to us through the word of god here tonight [Music] say our bibles here will stand by god's grace in your homes i'll sing about that song i came to worship and we came to youtube to worship together so that's how we came together tonight let's go to first timothy two i have to look at this uh thought tonight as the nation is uh in this little bit of uh confusion time i like to look at this thought of praying for and seeking peace in our nation we always need to pray for our nation and uh we need to seek the peace of god so let's go to first timothy two verse one first timothy 2 1. praise god [Music] read one through eight by god's grace why don't we read one and two together and then i'll read three through eight okay we'll read one and two together let's begin on three between we'll begin on three one two three i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty i'll read myself 3-8 for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time whereunto i am ordained a preacher an apostle i'm sorry and an apostle i speak the truth in christ and ly not a teacher of the gentiles in faith and verity i will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting may god add his blessings three is where he may be seated i'm gonna adjust this a little bit so i want to just take a few uh minutes here and preach by god's grace i took off my watch so i'm not sure um we'll try to watch the time i guess i can do it on my phone here let me just set a timer so i just got about an idea how far we'll go let me set it for 40 minutes and see how it goes by god's grace but if you just hold on just set it down anywhere just so we like to look at this thought here of uh praying for the nation and also uh seeking peace in the nation you know a lot of my prayers obviously have been on the election and things related to politics uh over the last numerous years but of course especially in the last few weeks and months here leading up to the election and so uh scripturally um i believe that's the right thing to do i believe it uh there's uh there's a responsibility christians have to do that so i want to just take a a sermon tonight and kind of look at the scriptural basis that we have for our government and for um for voting and then of course uh numerous things our prophet brother branham said about it um i just want to start here you know here here's paul uh and i just want to just point out verses one and two he says pray for all those that are leadership um you know we should pray for our local officials and state and then government uh officials that's this is called good and acceptable in the sight of god so we never want to you know look down on that if anyone would look down on someone praying for leaders we don't look down on upon that we want to honor that that's a very respectful thing to do as we'll see why here in a few moments by god's grace and so you can see that god works through human government verse 3 i'm sorry verse 2 says the reason we do this the reason we pray for our leaders in america is so we can lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty so our motivation is that we pray for our leaders that we can have peace uh in our country uh that we can live a completely godly life we can live a totally honest life uh before all men that's our motivation this is the bible says this is good uh and acceptable in the sight of our savior i'm reminded now i didn't have my notes but i'm reminded of ecclesiastes uh where solomon urges you know the readers he urges them to enjoy life he said but remember god will bring all these things into into judgment solomon says whatever you do do with all your heart and i know the colossians repeats that as well do it with all your strength and so we have this liberty as as christians to live godly and pursue peace and and that's a scriptural rite that we see right here in the scripture um and notice then verse 8 i just wanted to point this one out as well that men pray everywhere we can pray everywhere we can pray in our homes at the church at the state house right we can pray everywhere lift up holy hands without wrath and doubting so we have no reason to doubt that god would not hear us right if we're praying for our leadership and our government or the sick like we were tonight we pray for the sick so we have confidence that our great god and savior jesus christ the mediator between god and man he hears us no matter where we are so that means god is present and god's aware of uh every every job of man right every uh every avenue of man every uh every office of man god is aware of it and of course now we know the balance to it we will get to the balance a little bit the balance is that you know satan offered jesus all the kingdoms of the world so we know the majority of people in leadership uh are not godly people many of them are not um and yet we're still called to pray for them right we're so called to pray for them maybe my children can help me on this one i was listening and uh do you know during the days of the romans did they get to vote for their leaders or was it like a tyrant kind of rulership do you remember it would depend on the time okay yeah so you know i've heard recently you know some people say well jesus never voted paul never voted many times they didn't have the chance to vote power was often passed down and it was killed for it was fought for so that's one thing to keep in mind you know as we'll get to that in a little bit but yet we know you know the one who inspired paul to write this was jesus christ and yet jesus christ knew every human government governing body and leadership was ultimately controlled by satan but yet he still prayed that we could have peace as christians it's a holy ghost-filled prophet of god named paul encouraging us to pray for peace and yet satan uh is in control of many of these governments no doubt about it so i just want to start with that thought uh that we can pray everywhere and we're to pray for this the main purpose is that we can live a peaceful life that we can help others to know god because who will have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth so god wants all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth that's best done when we can live a quiet and peaceable life in godliness and honesty according to the scripture here so we thank the lord for that now i want to look at another scripture here let's go to jeremiah 29 1. so to kind of go along with this idea of praying for peace we see this also in jeremiah 29 i believe 1-7 [Applause] now the context as you probably know is that israel was getting uh exiled out of the promised land for their sins their many many sins and so many of them were going to be taken away to assyria or babylon but jeremiah had a word for them now let's look at jeremiah 29 1. now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the people from nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from jerusalem to babylon now let's go let's get down to verse 4. thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel unto all that are carried away captives whom i have caused to be carried away from jerusalem unto babylon verse five build e houses and dwell in them and plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them so israel was going to be slaves but they had the freedom to build their own houses and so god tells them build your own houses bricks take e wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that you'd be increased there and not diminished now here's verse 7 we're going to go here and seek the peace of the city whether i have caused you to be carried away captives and pray unto the lord for it so there in babylon a heathen land and god says go along like you're going to live there right build your houses have weddings have children don't diminish your numbers increase your numbers and seek the peace of the city bless you whether i have caused you to be carried away captives and pray unto the lord for it these are heathens right so a lot of people think i wouldn't want to pray for these heathens that the bible says pray for the the peace of that city a bunch of heathens bunch of idolaters pray for idolaters to live in peace with the believers the jews for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace so what a promise god gives them and now this is one of the most beautiful chapters people often you know quote this at weddings and of course all to encourage themselves you know in verse 10 god tells them he's going to give him 70 years they'll be there that's why i said build the houses have children have weddings going to be there 70 years i'm going to bring you out verse 11 for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and out of evil to give you an expected end okay then you shall call upon me you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart and i will be found of you saith the lord and i will turn away your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether i've driven you saith the lord i'll bring you again into the place whence i cause you to be carried away captive what a beautiful promise right god promises and peace and god's thoughts for them his own people that were under a temporary punishment right x out of their land god's plans for them were peace not just once they got back to israel but while they set up homes in babylon and he said pray for peace in the city that you may have peace and so the same you see how we see the same idea saints you know in the old testament here with jeremiah and then also the new testament right that was just a different form of babylon right rome paul was under the roman empire battling the roman empire died under the roman empire just another form of the same antichrist spirit but yet in both cases one's old testament one's new new testament god is encouraging them pray for peace that you can live a godly life in all honesty and sincerity so i thought i would start with those so everybody can see no matter no matter where we are old testament new testament we're to pray for peace and we're to act in peace now of course there's another thought the other thought is with there's a time for war and time for peace now that of course the time of war was the american revolution we know our country went through that world war one world war ii there was times for war this obviously right now is a time of peace and so we rejoice in that but we're still to pray for peace especially with this summer's riots and all the violence and things we are to pray for peace we are the agents of peace and we're to plead with god to send peace in our in our land and that's what we should do by god's grace now go to romans 13 we'll hit this here you know some we had a brother years ago come to church and he don't come anymore but he told me romans 13 was about preachers and i said no it's not preachers it's about government officials and the proof of that is because you don't pay dues and tributes and customs in verse 7 to preachers you pay tithes and offerings to preachers okay these are the same greek words where jesus told uh peter you know give to caesar what's caesar's right speaking of the government so um this whole chapter is devoted um to being subject to the higher power so listening to the governments uh that god places over mankind okay and now just to preface this what was the previous chapter and remember the previous chapter was about how to do the perfect will of god right romans 12 is about doing the perfect will of god making your body living sacrifice and then transforming your mind right and the chapter ended chapter 12 ended with um be not overcome with evil but overcome evil with good and then on that thought with transformed mind doing the perfect will of god paul now he's told him to do the perfect will of god now he says submit to the government as long as they as long as the government agrees with god's word now verse 3 i'm sorry verse 1 in chapter 13 that every soul be subject under the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god so god has ordained god ordained the roman government when paul wrote this god ordained the united states government and each government around the nation god ordained that government uh remember this is all orchestrated by god uh remember jesus told pilate he said you don't have any power over me but what my father gives you remember that children so every every human power was a power ordained of god it says it right there that's ordained of god god ordained that we live under uh i'm sorry our republic here in the united states verse two whosoever therefore resists the power resists this the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation for rulers are not a terror to do good works but to the evil wilt thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same so we should be law abiding citizens verse 4 for he is the minister of god to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the story in vain for he's the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil wherefore you must need to be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake so the bible says we will have a bad conscience toward god if we're not obeying the laws of the land verse six for this cause you paid tribute also for they are god's ministers attending continually upon this very thing render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honor to whom honor that's why when we tell if we go before judge we say your honor right they should have honor they're ordained of god now they might be some of them might be good some of them might be rascals but we're still supposed to honor them now verses 8 uh the 14 talks about how we all must love one another love fulfills all the law now in verse 14 i want to just say that well why don't we read uh 13 and 14 because this ties in with what paul wrote to timothy about living an honest life let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in uh chambering and wontonness or wantonness not in strife or envying but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof now i don't know if you remember when we preached on ephesians and we looked at the history of the roman government and the roman society it was awful it was men could do evil things to their wives their children they were just had way too much power um the social life and the the social customs were absolutely corrupt and filthy i don't i don't can't even mention these things that they were so awful and filthy but yet paul says in the midst of that darkness shine as the light and he said put on the lord jesus christ in other words put on the full armor of god be anointed with the holy spirit and live a honest life obeying all the laws of the land okay so again paul writes this after saying we must do the perfect will of god we find out god ordains the government leaders we're to pray for them and ask god to to help them but mostly that we can live in peace and others can hear the gospel of jesus christ that we have heard that's the main point here of praying for our government and leadership okay now i'm going to switch over to my notes add some electronic notes here um and we'll be uh looking at some of those here by god's grace so i want to um now look at this thought you know a lot of people at least around the churches we associate with called the message of the hour churches um they will take quotes from our prophet william branham and though they'll try to make it sound like um you know we shouldn't vote we shouldn't have any interest in the government or anything but uh i think it's okay for brother brahm to have those opinions of course he's a man now we've read what the scripture says and i just want to start with a few different quotations um i don't have some of these in front of me i'm just going to go off memory but i know brother branham said a couple of times he wouldn't vote um because the elections are rigged and that's possible as we're seeing now some of them may be rigged there's a lot of there could be some uh corruption with the ballots and everything the mail ballots or ones that were delivered so we're just praying for god to figure that out if it be god's will um but i'm going to bring out you know some different uh scriptures and and then some quotes from the prophet of god that we can look at tonight now here's one from 1954 invisible union i'm sorry invasion united states sorry now remember i never cast a vote my life see now that's nothing to brag on that's my american birth rights if i want to do it so brother man wasn't proud that he never voted he said there's nothing to brag on but i think too much of my friends to put them in there look i've seen them go in as fine men come out as crooks and i don't want that so one reason brother ramsey didn't vote was he said he saw all the men go in there become crooked and come out now we know that's true with a lot of people but there have been some men that have been able to go in there and have a good testimony right congressman up shaw right saints right he's god honored him so much god healed him and raised him out of a wheelchair now there's maybe some others i'm just gonna name a few names like ron paul seems like he was a godly man or at least to some degree right a righteous man i'll say it like that uh maybe there's some others i personally think mike pence seems like a very honest and righteous man there could be some others okay no doubt about that i don't i wouldn't know any of them anyway but i just want to say something brother ram didn't brag on he didn't brag well i never vote he just uh saw a lot of corruption now i want you to listen to this quote six years later he talks about dwight eisenhower he said i certainly had great admiration for president dwight eisenhower sure i'm sorry sir he has sure been one of great man in my way of thinking if he was running again and i was voting i would vote for him again so brother m6 years later earlier said he never voted and then six years later he said it but if eisenhower was running again i'd vote for him why brother ram tells us i don't care if he's 100 years old i still be voting for him because i like him and let's remember him in our prayers tonight so so let's just take let's just take some thought we've heard all these things about voting and brother rand was against voting well no doubt there was some corruption even in their day with voting but he didn't brag about it he didn't brag about not voting um but he said if dwight eisenhower was running for president again he would vote for him now let me uh read a little bit about eisenhower and some of this was shocking to me but some good history so let me read this here um on february 1st 1953 10 days after his inauguration eisenhower was baptized and welcomed into the national presbyterian church by the reverend edward elson eisenhower remains the only president ever to been baptized while in office and his work to link faith and the american identity has influenced political debate in the country for half a century since and this article is on history.com shows how eisenhower had a strong relationship with billy graham although eisenhower was not an evangelical he was a presbyterian so brother branham admired a presbyterian preacher so much now lydia on my phone look up and see what church mike pence belongs to so just take your time i'm not gonna i'm gonna have my daughter look up see what denomination pants belongs to because i don't know if you heard a couple weeks ago donald trump came out and said he wasn't a presbyterian he's an independent and of course eisenhower was a very humble leader um you know leading the the the country through the 50s okay so i just thought i would read that uh just so you know brother branham said he would vote for a presbyterian man because he liked him if he had the chance to do it okay so hopefully that helps out and i just want to read one more scripture too i recall this let's go to daniel 2 21 i'll go there daniel 2 21 just because this scripture says god raises up leaders and brings them down yeah so daniel blesses god in verse 20 in daniel 2 21 and he changes the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding and i'll stop right there because again we see god raises up leaders and then god brings them down he's the one that sets them up all in his wisdom in his sovereign uh eternal wisdom and his godly counsel and his his god counsel he sets them up and brings them down okay did you find anything okay no problem all right so um so see there may be some quotes that make people don't want to vote that's fine but brother brown calls it a birthright so i believe voting is a sacred birthright it's a christian it's a it's an american birthright through the christian faith um and i believe this because many biblical people never lived in a republic like we have they were mainly ruled by tyrants and kings where powers passed down it's not voted upon okay so let me just read a little snippet about america instead of kings who wield absolute power for entire lifetimes america was established as a nation ruled by the people the government's ability to wrest power from the people was reigned in by an ingenious system of checks and balances but what is often missed by people today was the expectation of the founding fathers all of whom held a great reverence for god and scripture that leaders possess a moral compass and that virtue justice and righteousness were essential for government not to trample on the god-given rights of the people george washington warned america in his first inaugural dress never to depart from its founding principles which he clearly believed flowed from god he declared the propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself has ordained there's that word ordained right all the powers of government leaders are ordained of god okay well he was a catholic but now he says he's a born-again evangelical catholic all right so pence used to be a catholic but according to one website he says now he's a born-again evangelical catholic he's a catholic and then he's about an evangelical mega church well i felt like himself a catholic and now yeah he's been born again so he joins part of an evangelical church so that's interesting i still like him uh remember he got a lot of flack a couple years ago a lot of anger in the media because he will refuse to have a meeting one-on-one with a woman that's not his wife he's got to have at least another person in there that's the same standard billy graham always kept during his ministry as well and so i have a lot of uh i like him like with ram said i like i like mike pence so um so i hope that's a help by god's grace hopefully that opens up some people's minds and hearts brother ram said don't even pray for the nation and of course we don't pray for the nation as a whole we pray for individuals within the nation because we know the nation cannot come back to god we know it can't uh because it's gonna be kind of it's gonna become the beast that rises up uh out of the land in revelation 13 so we can't pray for the whole nation because it's not scriptural but we can pray for peace and we can pray for individuals to hear the truth and acknowledge the truth and be saved okay so let me just look at let me just share a few more thoughts um you know brother brown he never saw many men live a godly life in the government and it's true many can't but i just want to say there are scriptures where godly men can keep their testimony in the government government and they did it without the baptism of the holy ghost right joseph in egypt right he lived a very sanctified holy life uh in the government right uh how about daniel and babylon those are just two simple examples no one lived a life like daniel did right him and the three hebrew children what a godly uh honest life that he lived he lived so close to god they tried to kill him falsely he was such a godly man and so we can't say well god would never put anybody in government we can't say that because god is if he's the same yesterday today and forever he has placed men and women sometimes in government remember deborah we preached on deborah last year or may was earlier this year and god allowed or god used her in a great way where the king balak didn't have the faith god used deborah's prophecies to raise his faith and gain the victory a powerful victory for israel and she was in the judicial ranks she was a judge so we cannot say god would never call someone to the government um but we can say if god calls him there god will be able to keep them in the midst of the trials and a couple more things uh you know should christians vote i believe yes i believe it's a sacred a sacred right uh it's a american birthright because what is voting voting is influencing leaders and choosing leaders can anyone think of a godly person who influenced a king or a leader or any government maybe save lives yeah joseph esther that's what i was thinking of esther didn't esther use her influence with the king to save lives well that that's all that's all we that's what our votes do they influence the leaders right um so i look at it like that esther influenced her king we influence our leaders by voting or protesting or emailing them writing letters esther saved lives why didn't god just do it himself why did he have to use the government right what why did god need to use esther well god likes to give people a part in redemption god likes to give them assignments praise god right the bible said he worked with them right they went the disciples went out preaching and the lord worked with them in mark 16. god didn't need esther to save the jews but he used her for such a time as that in the government right through prayer fasting look how prayer and fasting shapes the government so god loves to work with mankind he's the vine we are the branches and i believe we can still save lives by sighing and crying for the abominations done the abortions done and by voting pro-life i still believe all things are possible with god some people may think i'm crazy but i believe that i'm going to keep praying for that i was crying for that today as well signing crying for the abominations let me just give one more example if i lived in california today i'd want to influence my leaders i'd want to vote out the governor i don't know i don't know what his terms up but right because he's forbidding people from from fulfilling the scripture of going to church right and mayors i see we have that right many governments over the years never had that right the people didn't have that right but we have the right so if i lived there i would pray of course pray for peace and pray for the laws to change and the mandates to end but then i would go on vote because they're forbidding me of my god-given rights they're causing me to try to or to break hebrews 10 24 to 26 it says gather more as you see that day approaching and so we'll see if the lord tarries we'll see if god will raise up people to vote out those leaders and bring in leaders that will give them their rights back we'll see it's all in god's hands and then remember proverbs 14 34 righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a reproach to any people that's why i pray we pray for the most righteous leaders to be elected now god may allow unrighteous ones we've seen that over the years but we should pray for peace pray for the most righteous leaders okay so god is the one who places governments over us and we're just we're just fortunate in america that we have a say-so at times for our leaders now this whole sermon kind of came from this this idea i was listening to thirst 1965 and i heard brother brown say these words where is our patrick henry's he says where is our abraham lincoln's he says where is our john quincy adams i don't know if i've mentioned that in the last few months but this whole thing came from that i've just had that thought on my mind um so i want to go through some quotes and a little bit of history here uh as we move on how much time do i got lydia for 40 minutes six minutes okay so i got about six minutes time at 40. maybe i'll go a little bit over that by god's grace so i want to look at a little bit of history and look at there's um there's five quotes where brother ran talks about this idea and it's all at the end of his message the first one is in august 64 then they're just spread out here the rest of his life 64-65 so five times he says this about where are the godly men in one case he says we need those kind of men and you'll be surprised maybe about what they did um so see uh i want to just bring a balance to this so these are quotes maybe people never have read right or not never preached or never heard and so we want to understand the context of them so the first quote uh brother does tell us about the government the majority of people won't be turned uh but he is um he says there's few people that will stand for principles and convictions and godliness so let's let's let's uh let me read this to you he says there will never never never come salvation to the world anymore they've passed their line between grace and judgment you might put abraham lincoln in every country in the united states every county in the united states it'll never turn this bunch of rickies and elvises back to god so he says you can put godly leaders there but it'll never bring the overall majority back to god he says oh how this world is contaminated there's a lot of hope for it all they've crossed the dividing line between reason and common sense let alone between salvation men can't even judge we don't have men no more like we used to have where's patrick henry where's abraham lincoln men that can stand for solid convictions whereas that man can raise up and make these crazy women out there stripping themselves off out before these men then and run them out there like a bunch of striptease and then they put the boy in a penitentiary that's insult one of them where's your reasons where's your common sense where's the laws that could stop it and then he tells a story where a policeman was fired for arresting a morally dressed woman in louisville kentucky he said a couple weeks ago so july 64. he said god help a nation that that rotten you can't get by unless you do wrong we might not get by but we can get up and that's where we're looking let's bow our heads now he this is the close of his sermon my questions answers part one he said lord jesus let the great shepherd come and take us out of this lord we're waiting for him wow so just seeing that a police officer getting fired for trying to arrest an indecently dressed woman made brother branham want to go to heaven in the rapture take us out of here we're waiting for him we're watching for that hour when we see the world so corrupt you said it would be this way your great prophets prophesied that these hours would be here we believe the prophets lord we believe it and now we pray god that you'll give us prophets to interpret this word to us that we might know whether we are right or wrong okay so brother bran's prayer goes god we want to leave this place but we want to know we're right or wrong we want to know the truth and how many can say amen to that amen praise god now here's a short biography on patrick henry he was a founding father his main job was a criminal attorney before the revolution he rode 50 miles on horseback to be a lawyer for three baptist preachers that were on trial in 1768 for preaching things that weren't allowed to be preached in the british colonies and god honored him he won the he won the trial and the baptist preachers didn't go to jail later he served five terms as a governor of virginia he sponsored the armed resistance of the revolution against great britain he gave the famous give me liberty or give me death speech and here's a little bit of it i hope i can find it here yeah let me pull up let me read a little bit of that quote here okay now in his give me liberty or give me death speech he quotes jeremiah the book of jeremiah and matthew the book of matthew brother where is our patrick henry's that'll stand up for truth he says it is vain sir to accentuate the matter gentlemen may cry peace peace but there is no peace the war has actually begun it's about the revolutionary war against britain or great britain the next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms our brethren already already in the field why stand life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death he didn't want to live in the chains of tyranny of great britain and their king uh and their state church which i believe was anglican if not mistaken so these are the famous words give me liberty let me fight for my freedoms to worship god and to have our own country or give me death the man says where's our men like that that will stand for convictions okay he also mentioned abraham lincoln of course abraham lincoln was the 16th president uh our leader during the civil war now the civil war began one month after he took office and ended five days before he died six hundred thousand americans lost their lives in his second uh presidential inaugural address he quoted matthew 18 7 and also psalms 19 9. matthew 18 7 woe into the world because of offenses for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh it's quoting the lord jesus christ we know offenses are going to come but let's not be the one making the offenses that's what abraham lincoln taught and then he quoted psalms 19 9 the lord is clean and during enduring forever i'm sorry the word of the lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the lord are true and righteous all together okay so um abraham lincoln often addressed god in his speeches we know we did that often uh there's a couple examples here but i'm not just for time's sake i'm not going to read them i'm sorry they're both from his second inaugural address where he uh quotes the scriptures and if god's will be done speaking of the judgments of the lord in his last speech he he was setting the tone for the plan for the nation's reconstruction right the nation been torn apart through civil war in his last speech before he was killed in his inaugural uh second inaugural address was this he says with malice toward none with charity for all that's not like the scripture charity for all love all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right right so he says god help us to see what's right let us strive on to finish the work we're in to bind up the nation's wounds to care for him who shall born the battle and force widown for his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations peace see peace that's what the bible says peace is such a blessing all right so brother man says where's men like this that will pray for peace pray for healing and of course abraham lincoln stood he stood between the north and south and kept the country together that's why they fight it they fought the civil war to keep the states united in a federal government and so that's the first quote with some short biographies about cement here's a second one this is the oddball actually this is the first one but as far as chronological order do you know the politicians can't judge right or wrong you see them keeping quiet on this voting the bible back into the school they don't know which way the politics are going to blow think of it i don't know how it is in indiana now but the state of arizona it's against the law to read the bible in school i think it's the same thing in indiana nearly the whole united states because some infidel women changed the whole program and remember it's against the law to read the bible in our public schools but believers taxes supports infidelity to be taught in the school right like such sex education and evil things like that you can't read the bible but bible believers pay taxes so the schools can continue and they teach sex education immoral acts politics he said we need another abraham lincoln brother am says that we need another patrick henry we need an american who can stand out regardless of where the politics are and call right right and wrong wrong we need more men like that did you know preachers they can't judge which is right the word of god or the church denomination they don't know which road to take they can't judge between right and wrong i know the bible says it but our church says see people are not capable of judging right from wrong and anything that's contrary to the bible is wrong god's word is right and every man's word is a lie that's contrary to it and to try to stand upon a time like that to stand for what's right you become a nut how many nuts we got out there i know i'm one of those nuts by god's grace hallelujah standing upon god's word believing god's word teaching god's word only the bible's right hallelujah here's another one and here's where brother brown brings up john quincy adams and arnold von winklereed okay this is from uh 1965 an oath and not the mental faculties and reasons of man is broke down there's no hopes it's beyond hope the whole thing is a reputation sore the mental faculties of man they can't make decisions i'm not i'm not a politician he says i don't neither democrat or republican they're all filthy i'm for one kingdom and that's the kingdom of jesus christ that's all but how in the world did you ever see a bunch of puppets like we got up there now like the bunch of texans we got in there why they say whatever the people wants if they want communism we'll give them communism if they want integration we'll give them integration want segregation we'll give them whatever did it where is man he says oh god that's like the pulpit where is man man that's man that stands for a principle where's woman that stands for principle so now he calls women into it too where's a church that stands for a principle i ain't got a nickel's worth of time for a wishy-washy given compromising spirit a woman is a woman let her be a lady if a man is a man let him be a man if he's a president where is our john quincy adams he says where's our abraham lincoln's men of the principle where's our patrick henry that said give me liberty or give me death where's a man that stands for what's right where's a man that's not afraid to speak out regardless the whole world's against him speak out what for what's right and stand for it and die for it where is our arnold von winklereed again today where's our men of integrity where's men with spirit they're so wishy-washy and gummed up until they don't know where they stand god let me stand with the principles of one man as a minister the word of jesus christ for heavens and earth will pass away but it'll never fail on this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell should not prevail against it in that powerful wow who was john quincy adams he was our sixth president the son of the second president john adams and you know what he wasn't a trinitarian amen according to this article about him he was a unitarian but he wasn't a trinitarian so god bless him for that he staunchly opposed slavery even fought against it in the court system one article says of all american presidents john quincy adam was perhaps the most deeply immersed in scripture and in christian theology he read the bible virtually every morning of his life and went to church without fail on the sabbath often attending two circumstances every every sabbath oh my the man says where's men like this that will stand up against the evils why didn't you sit back and say oh you guys can take care of slavery no he stood up against slavery right just like with the other ones uh why didn't patrick henry if government's so bad why do you sit back and say oh it's okay we'll just stay under the great great britain we'll just we'll live under them no he recognized the freedoms that jesus christ died for to get to give us the freedoms and he stood up for it so we could have it enjoy those freedoms see that's why i don't believe in standing back and not voting and doing nothing and not even praying for the nation i believe we should pray i believe we should vote we should do all we can within our power these men brother brahms calls by name they didn't sit back and do nothing they were active uh in their faith and in their political uh positions that god ordained now most of us are not political positions that doesn't mean we shouldn't pray for them we should constantly pray for people in political positions all right that was the third one who was arnold von winklery my brother man tells a story about him uh it's hard to say whether he was he's from switzerland um some people say well he's a legend so he's made up others people say he's a real person okay but but in 1386 according to this uh brother ram story and of course you know historians that believe it's true he sacrificed his own life to change the situation of a battle and it ultimately led to victory for the swiss forces okay so he basically ran into some spears and he took out some people while he did it and that opened up that opened up the soldier so then the swiss could come in and defeat them i actually physically went in and divided them so that his army could get the victory brother says where's men like that and i guess his last words before he went and died was take care of my wife and children because today i'm going to save switzerland so brother ramsey says where's men like that they'll stand up for freedoms and truth the memory said we need them for all those people that say i believe every quote well there's a quote we need more men like that we need men like john quincy adams right we need men like abraham lincoln all right i got two more quotes and i can finish this here uh tonight by god's grace okay so let's fast forward to thirst this is the one that i listened to now you cannot pull sin through the pages of the bible no it stops it it filters it out now you can go to church and just take anything but you can't come through this bible and have sin it will not do it it filters out all sin and it gives a holy man's takes because if the man is thinking that he wants to be holy and be like god and be a son or a daughter of god then he wants the right kind of a filter so he stops all sin on this side of the bible and he can only bring the holy spirit through the bible that wrote the bible it's a holy man's taste to have this thinking man's filter now we find how deceiving is today matthew 24 24 jesus said in the last days the two spirits would be so close alike until they would deceive them very elected if it was possible how close what a deception of a right and wrong we have today even in our government he goes now in our politics we haven't even got a man that we could put up as a politician that will absolutely stand up for what he thinks is right where's our patrick henry's in george washington's abraham lincoln's up today just as our president said there the way if they want communism they can have it whatever the people wants if that ain't a man that won't speak his conviction a man that will stand up on a principle that will stand on what's what's a principle just want to go the way of least resistance rather man says most politicians go the way of least resistance rather than standing on the principles of god and he says that's the way the people's got in the church they want to come join a church and say oh well that's it i joined church for now you're trying to satisfy that great holy thirst that god put in you that control tower trying to turn you to the right thing and to try to satisfy with joining a church quoting a creed or something like that when it's nothing but the very presence and filling of god himself in your life that will satisfy that praise god don't be satisfied with joining a church be satisfied with becoming a church or being baptized with the holy ghost in the church of the firstborn praise god the church of jesus christ that's the only thing that will satisfy that thirst inside of you is jesus christ's own spirit abiding in your soul leading and guiding you every single day all right of course we know there's a lot of people today that want socialism in america so we pray against that that's had awful effects all over the world um so of course we pray against that i'm not going to get into that but brother talked about communism and socialism is close to that but not the same thing um a marxist theory but we will not go into that tonight i'm not really ready to preach on that but just so you know those things are rising up in america so where is our john uh quincy adams where's our patrick henry's that'll speak out against that the evils of that system so we have to pray against it we have to encourage our leaders to speak out against it last quote and then we'll be finished here by god's grace uh this is from leadership a couple weeks before brother brandon passed away he said oh god take us back to eden again lord where there's no death no sorrow granite lord we stand humbly waiting for the second adam to come for his bride make us a part of him father we pray in jesus name amen he's closing the sermon he said do you love god can you feel do you realize what i'm trying to tell you if you can understand raise your hand say i understand what you're saying can you see the insanity of this age he said look how it's gone even there's no reasons among the people no more he says even our leaders he said look at our president if they want communism let them have it whatever the people wants let them have it where's our patrick henry's our george washington's where's our leaders that can stand for a principle we haven't got them no more and they're very few and far between where's our churches our ministers we'll take the people in just on probation or come in and join the church and do this or have a little sensation or something where's those men of god those prophets that stand out and dare to defy all the things of the world amen where's men of integrity where are they at they're so soft and through intellectual conception so they're not here no more oh god have mercy on us he says these hideous things that are coming upon the earth you can see how the people's moving right into it it's an insanity when the thing strikes the church will be gone hallelujah he said god let us be there that's my prayer to the great supernatural being that's in this building tonight the great christ that still has eternal life i pray thee christ as i'm here with my eyes open looking at the church that you've redeemed with your blood god don't let a one of us be lost that's our prayer tonight we want to be right with you so cleanse us o lord from all of our iniquities to take away our sins and things when we seen you heal the sick even raise the dead come back to life through prayer we've seen all these things happen father now bring us back to life spiritually bring us back to realization of eternal life through jesus christ grant this father i commit it all to you in jesus christ's name so as we close brother branham wanted to prepare the people for the rapture we see the world going insane most leaders are wrong but we're to do we are to defy the world we are to live holy and godly in this present age and ask jesus to cleanse us from every uh filthiness of flesh in preparation for the rapture so children let's stand here malachi can come to the piano by god's grace hope you enjoyed that tonight by god's grace i really enjoyed studying on that and just seeing those beautiful scriptures here we're to pray for our country pray for our leaders and we're to seek peace and try to get the gospel to more people i trust that's what this live youtube streaming is doing here trying to reach people that don't know jesus christ as their savior so we'll certainly pray for them by god's grace why don't you play i believe on a hill called mount calvary let's pray together here heavenly father we thank you for tonight dear god we thank you for the word that we've heard thank you for inspiring us to find these scriptures today lord god [Music] we know they're yea and amen we know this scripture will
