Description:
The importance of true doctrine can hardly be overemphasized. Jesus Christ received His doctrine from His Father and all who obeyed it would know it came from God. Paul and apostles labored in doctrine while forbidding all doctrine outside of Paul's gospel. God's prophet, William Branham, loved doctrine and teaching. 

Today's ecumenical move attacks the true Bride doctrine, but Christ will save all those who preach and hear sound Biblical doctrine.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] but yet a church without a doctrine is just like a jellyfish that has no backbone greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ is doctrine important or necessary for all christians and for christians who follow the bible-based message of god's prophet william branham the answer is an emphatic yes especially when you understand the definition of doctrine all the bible references regarding it and quotes from god's prophet brother william branham as you heard in the opening brother branham said churches without doctrine are like jellyfish with no stability no spiritual backbone where might brother branham have got the inspiration for this jellyfish quote i'm not sure but it's likely from ephesians 4 verses 8 through 16 because the five-fold ministry brings holy ghost-filled saints to perfection or spiritual completion but the lack of the doctrine heard from the fivefold ministry keeps believers in a state of spiritual immaturity as the bible said they'd be tossed by every wind of doctrine ephesians 4 verse 14 and doctrines of devils would permeate their churches according to first timothy 4 verse 1. true doctrine or sound doctrine gives spiritual health strength and stability to the saints here's the outline for this video first we'll look at defining doctrine and contrasting it with general preaching second bible proof supporting the necessity of doctrine third quotes from brother branham supporting doctrine and teaching fourth the ecumenical attack on true doctrine and fifth addressing misconceptions about doctrine let's define doctrine and contrast it with preaching in the greek lexicon doctrine is defined as instruction teaching precepts or commands doctrine is closely related to teaching since teaching means to hold discourse with others in order to instruct them and to teach one to impart instruction instill doctrine into one as the greek definition states these two closely related words have the following two greek words in the greek doctrine is did escala and of course i may be saying that wrong it's used 21 times in the new testament the greek word for teaching is didasco and that's used 91 times in the new testament so we can clearly see how doctrine and teaching are closely related and the holy spirit emphasizes the importance of these two greek words over 110 times in the new testament looking at the word preach in particular in the greek preach means to bring good news declare joyful tidings of god's kindness in particular of the messianic blessings it's used 60 times the new testament although doctrine seems it could be a type of preaching there are numerous scriptures that contrast doctrine and preaching second timothy 4 verse 2 makes it seem like doctrine could be a type of preaching because it says preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine as i've studied doctrine and preaching i found a stark contrast because doctrine is instruction what believers should do while preaching is announcing or declaring what jesus has done and will do so again doctrine is what you should do and preaching is what god has done or will do bible examples that prove this are matthew 4 verse 23 jesus did both preaching and teaching and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people the disciples did both preaching and teaching as well according to acts 5 verse 42 and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ acts 15 35 paul also and barnabas continued in antioch teaching and preaching the word of the lord with many others also and acts 28 31 preaching the kingdom of god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence no man forbidding him another clear example is luke 3 verses 15-17 in these scriptures john the baptist was preaching jesus's future works he said he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire and will gather the we into his garner and then luke 3 verse 18 says and many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people so notice john the baptist did not give any instruction or teaching in this text he simply published or declared what he was called to do and what god and jesus would do in the future with this understanding i was recently corrected by a viewer which i appreciate the correction the viewer noted how i called serpent seed a doctrine and said it wasn't a doctrine he was correct because the serpent seed revelation does not instruct believers to do anything so i want to thank my viewers who provide correction for me and i always want to be open to correction as a humble servant of the lord jesus christ bible proof supporting the necessity of doctrine friends the necessity of true doctrine can hardly be overemphasized in summary a church that possesses and teaches true doctrine is a sign the leaders and members are baptized with the holy ghost as true children of god according to second john 1 verses 9 through 11 matthew 24 24 john 6 verse 45 and john 16 verse 13. listen carefully to second john 1 verse 9 whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son so the holy spirit wrote through saint john that whoever abided in the doctrine had christ and the father this must mean if you abide in true teaching that proves you have the baptism of the holy ghost and the opposite is true as well with the wrong doctrine you do not have christ and the father you do not have the baptism of the holy ghost matthew 24 verse 24 says in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect so we understand from jesus's words the elect cannot be deceived with false doctrine john 6 45 says it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me so this proves all that are taught of god are the children of god and of course they would be taught the true doctrine by their father and through his son the lord jesus christ john 16 13 said how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth so jesus's words promise if we have the baptism of the holy ghost they'll guide us into true doctrine let's overview jesus doctrine paul and the apostles doctrine and deadly effects of false doctrine or doctrines of devils regarding jesus many people do not understand that jesus was known for both power and doctrine because the pharisees sadducees and other religious sects of his day were powerless and held false doctrines or traditions of men numerous scriptures reveal christ jesus's power flowed through him because of his authoritative doctrine that he received from god the father in john 7 verses 16 and 17 jesus doctrine was not his own but the fathers those who obeyed the doctrine would know it was from god the same is true today those who follow jesus doctrine or instruction will know it's from god because of the results that it bears in mark 4 verse 2 even jesus's parables were doctrine because they gave instructions on how to live such as jesus instruction to keep a good and honest heart in his parable of the four grounds and the sower jesus gave us instruction on how to live a fruitful life with the fruits of the holy spirit keep a good and honest heart in matthew chapters 5 through 7 and also chapter 7 verse 28 people were astonished at jesus doctrine which included teaching about marriage and divorce how to be married in obedience according to the instruction of jesus christ there are many other doctrinal statements in jesus sermon on the mount so friends doctrine cannot be ignored or downplayed because adulterers who disobey jesus's teaching on marriage and divorce will not inherit the kingdom of god so jesus gave us marriage doctrine on how to be married in a god honoring way and remember your decision about marriage is your second most important decision in life so having the right doctrine regarding marriage and divorce is extremely important for obedience to that doctrine of marriage and divorce will allow you to eventually become part of the kingdom of jesus christ at the high priest house jesus said he did not hide his doctrine but openly taught it to the world yet churches went to keep doctrine out of their sermons which is extremely sad john 18 verses 19 through 20 says jesus doctrine was preached openly to the world as he was teaching in the synagogue and temple in mark 11 verse 18 the scribes sought to kill jesus and feared him because of his doctrine and in one of his doctrines he called them a den of thieves jesus power flowed through his doctrine in mark 1 verse 27 they ask what new doctrine is this they saw jesus authority to cast out devils which was a new doctrine as also matthew 10 verse 8 proves because jesus taught his disciples to cast out devils and again casting out devils was a doctrine because there is a how-to or instruction on how to cast out devils for example jesus said some only come out by prayer and fasting luke 4 verses 32 and 33 said they were astonished at jesus doctrine because his word was with power in relation to casting out devils matthew 22 verse 33 and mark 1 verse 22 say the multitudes were again astonished at jesus doctrine regarding our theophany bodies like angels and we'll have these theophanies after death and how we'll have no sexual relations in heaven according to jesus's doctrine jesus great commission said teach all nations in matthew 28 so he was saying his apostles were to give them sound doctrine and not doctrines of devils so doctrine and power are both part of the great commission because in mark chapter 16 jesus said these signs will follow them that believe and listed all the supernatural power the holy ghost would give to true believers like speaking in new tongues casting out devils taking up serpents and it wouldn't harm them and all the wonderful supernatural blessings christ authorized for his church jesus gave warnings about false doctrine in matthew 15 verse 9 he said doctrines of men produce vain worship or traditions of men in matthew 16 12 he said the doctrine of the pharisees was leaven and leaven always represents sin in the bible in mark 12 38 in jesus doctrine he said beware of the scribes notice that jesus either loves the doctrine of the church or hates the church's doctrine according to revelation 2 verse 14 and 15 here jesus hated the doctrine of the nicolaitans he also hated the doctrine of balaam because it was a stumbling block of fornication again jesus hated the doctrine of jezebel in revelation 2 verse 24 saying it was the depths of satan which included fornication and idolatry for bible and message believers this should remind us of how false doctrine enters a church the revelation of the first four seals shows how the antichrist spirit rides into churches through false doctrines the first seal teaches that the white horse rider uses deeds of the nicolaitans to begin deceiving churches which are simply sayings those sayings or traditions of men soon become doctrines or the unbending ways of the deceived churches thus in the first four seals we see god's anointings to overcome the antichrist's sinful progression god's anointing is like a lion bold an ox sacrificial a man his wisdom and an eagle a prophetic revelation watching and praying satan uses the white horse or false teaching then moves to the red horse killing those who oppose him in our day it's mostly killing the influence of the true believers but also manifests itself in the worldly physical persecution of christians it then moves to the black horse a money capturing ministry building its own earthly headquarters or kingdom lastly it ends in spiritual death which can be blasphemy of the holy ghost or taking the mark of the beast like first timothy 5 6 teaches these terrors are spiritually dead while living in worldly pleasures while physically alive as you can see i'm recording the remainder of this video at a later time now regarding the doctrine of paul and the apostles we begin in the book of acts in acts 2 verse 42 the disciples had steadfast continuance in doctrine and fellowship with the apostles in acts 5 verse 28 the apostles filled jerusalem with their doctrine which means the powerful signs wonders and miracles of the holy ghost simply followed them after they taught the doctrine of the lord like in mark 16 verses 17 and 20. also in acts 5 19-21 the angel told them to go teach in the temple the words of this life so the angel of the lord commanded the apostles that doctrine must be taught in acts 13 verses 11 and 12 the deputy was astonished by the doctrine of the lord that blinded elimus the sorcerer and notice both jesus and the apostles had such astonishing doctrine vindicated by supernatural power i've seen that in my own life there was a brother from columbus who witnessed some miracles that were done after i preached and he left the meeting astonished that the holy ghost had done such wonderful works through the preaching of the revelation of the message of this hour in romans 6 verses 16 and 17 the bible says we should be servants of righteousness and obey the doctrine from the heart in romans 16 verse 17 the bible says teachers of false doctrine are to be avoided and their false doctrine proves they serve their own bellies and not the lord in first corinthians 14 verse 6 the bible says tongues can profit us by giving us doctrine revelation and prophecy in first corinthians 14 26 paul complemented the church of corinth and said everyone had a doctrine tongue psalm revelation etc in ephesians 4 verse 14 paul says those outside the five full ministry are tossed like spiritual children and easily deceived so without the true doctrine of the fivefold ministry people remain spiritual children and get swayed back and forth between all kinds of false doctrine in first timothy 1 verses 3 through 11 paul said teach no other doctrine so if you combine this thought with galatians 1 verses 6 through 12 wherein paul said you're cursed if you change one thing about the gospel that jesus christ gave to paul you again see the necessity of having true doctrine in 1st timothy chapter 1 paul lists sins that were contrary to sound doctrine in the greek sound means in good health so true doctrine produces good spiritual health while false doctrine produces spiritual sickness in first timothy 4 verses 6 through 16 paul mentions doctrine three times says we should be nourished in doctrine and that doctrine saves both the preacher and the hearers in first timothy 5 17 paul says god will give double honor to those who labor in doctrine in first timothy 6 verses 1 through 5 paul said servants who dishonor their masters blasphemed the doctrine of christ he also said teachers of false doctrine are proud people or they're filled with the spirit of pride in second timothy 3 verse 1 and verses 10 through 13 paul said perilous times are here and they're because men love themselves and we're lovers of themselves more than lovers of god but paul said my doctrine was fully known and all godly people will be persecuted because evil seducers wax worse and worse or teachers of false doctrine will abound more and more in second timothy 3 verse 16 paul said all scripture old testament and new testament is profitable for doctrine in second timothy 4 verses 1 through 5 paul said he exhorted the saints with long suffering and doctrine he said because there will come a time when people will not endure sound doctrine and it's clear we've come to that time most churches do not want sound doctrine in titus 1 verses 8 9 paul said preachers should use sound doctrine to convince the gangsters in titus 2 verses 1 through 3 paul said speak sound doctrine and live lives of holiness in titus 2 verses 7 through 10 paul said doctrine must not be corrupt or dishonest or insincere and paul said we must adorn the doctrine of god meaning the doctrine of god is lived out and displayed in a public manner through our character just as a garment is seen by everyone in public so is the doctrine that you believe manifest by how you live your life in private and public and you are known and read of all men like a written epistle in hebrews 6 verses 1 through 3 paul says we should move on from elementary doctrines if the lord permit so paul says there's a requirement for maturity we must accept the initial elementary doctrines and move on to deeper more spiritual doctrines in hebrews 13 verse 9 paul warns about strange or alien doctrines and we see a lot of that false doctrine today in some deceived message churches and also in many denominational and independent churches as well around the world regarding the deadly effects of false doctrine we've already seen how the first four seals show spiritual death or the fourth horse rider begins his deadly work with evil deeds that grow into false doctrines christ said traditions or doctrines of men produce vain worship in matthew 15 verses 1 through 8. christ also said false doctrine was like leaven in matthew 16 verse 6 because it puffs up a corrupted church in pride arrogance and many other sins see first corinthians 5 verse 2 paul urged the corinthians to be unleaved meaning free from false doctrine and sinful church members see first corinthians 5 verses 7 and 8. similar to the growing effects of false doctrine paul told us the false doctrine that the rapture has already passed destroys the faith of the hears comparing it to gangrene a flesh-eating disease that slowly eats away from the outside in second timothy 2 verses 16 through 18 says this but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenius and felidus who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection is passed already and overthrow the faith of some lastly paul taught doctrines of devils cause people to depart from the faith so nothing could be worse or more detrimental to the believer than false doctrines the true church has the right doctrine paul said teach no other doctrine because instruction is instruction or doctrine for eternal life doctrine is how to receive eternal life and manifest christ's life during your lifetime first timothy 4 verse 1 says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils in first timothy 4 verses 1 through 5 paul said in the latter times which is our day he said many would depart from the faith because they'd be addicted to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils and he gives two examples celibacy which the roman catholic church supports and propagates to their own detriment and sin and a ban against me eating which is also in the catholic church and many other denominational churches colossians 2 verses 16 through 23 say christians can be robbed of reward through the false doctrines of man that's specifically in verse 22 if you want to read that quotes from brother branham supporting doctrine and teaching the following quotes prove brother branham understood and preached the necessity of sound doctrine and teaching the first quote again shows how a church has no backbone or stability without doctrine understand what this means a church that never instructs its members on how to repent or how to receive the holy ghost or how to receive divine healing will have no backbone to stand against satan the very first step man has received the holy spirit is humility real god-given humility that is must be given humbly yet a church without a doctrine is just like a jellyfish that has no backbone so we've got to have that bone in it and not also backbone but heath also because the church of god must eat the bread of life the second quote shows brother branham understood that every single preacher has doctrine and without doctrine or instruction the preacher has no ministry because he is not telling the believers how to live godly how to believe how to receive god's blessings and so i have forth express doctrines and so forth to make this any man that has not a doctrine he has not a ministry in the next three quotes brother adam says teaching builds up believers in christ because they won't be built upon sensations then he says all doctrine or teaching must be based upon the word those who have the holy ghost will be in the word all the way which includes over 110 bible verses about the importance of doctrine i think the church has been preached to death the thing that these guys have come back to teaching and getting on a foundation so you'll know how to build yourself up in christ and we've built our churches up on sensations and upon different things but we can't build up on nothing but christ the revelation of jesus christ that's the only thing that we can do in him you are complete without him you're lost that doctrine can't be based upon some experience doctrine is based on god's word not only spirits people can have experiences of everything make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the holy ghost into the body of christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost i want to share this thought that the new testament only mentions the latter reign or rapturing faith as brother branham defines it in the church age book in one verse james verse 7. this helps you see the holy ghost's emphasis on doctrine in the over 110 new testament verses that speak of doctrine so the holy ghost emphasizes doctrine over 110 times but only speaks of the latter rain one time this proves those who love the holy ghost bible doctrine will be fully prepared for the latter rain and will receive it and will meet christ in the air at the rapture i'm going to read a portion about doctrine from my 2021 book the 12 new testament mysteries revealed found on pages 805-809 the importance of doctrine due to the rise of many false teachers in the message some have dismissed the need for doctrine to their detriment the bible is clear true doctrine saves both the preacher and hear first timothy 4 16. in fact ii john 1 verse 9 says the holy ghost-filled message believers will abide in christ's doctrine whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ hath both the father and the son in this quote brother branham says the bride will have true doctrine the antichrist refuses the true bride doctrine and therefore he takes his own bride now and peels her up under a creed of his own takes his own bride and makes her a denomination she gives birth to other denominations as quoted in this holy scripture gives birth to daughters and um she don't she becomes just like her mother natural worldly denominational opposing the spiritual bride the word in first timothy 5 17 paul says labors in doctrine are worthy of double honor let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor especially they who labor in the word and doctrine if there's a deep call for true doctrine there has to be a deep to respond you know the true bride will have both the spirit supernatural works of the holy ghost and the truth true doctrine some forget brother branham's quote that jesus's first doctrine was on the new birth or the baptism of the holy ghost this proves true doctrine leads you to the new birth and once born again the spirit keeps guiding you into more true doctrine brother rams said the following i want to take the subject this morning of jesus first doctrine first doctrine of jesus was you must be born again that was his first doctrine it's wrong for preachers to say they aren't trying to preach doctrine because every single sermon includes doctrine since it means instruction preachers are either giving instruction for miracles divine healing salvation etc brother random says every preacher has doctrine whether he knows it or not as he cannot have a ministry without doctrine in here i might say that i have to express doctrines and so forth to make this any man that has not a doctrine he has not a ministry brother ram love teaching the bible and wished he had charts to reference when teaching his people god's revelations saying it would be a little heaven this is why power points or visuals can be helpful to believers to grow their understanding brother random said the following how you all enjoying revelations all right man i believe a whole lot like my little girl sarah back there's become revolutions to me it's just revolutions going over and over you know i wish we just had now until about march or april just to put a great big canvas across the back here and just come down in daytime and draw out those pictures the whole chart and just raise them up and down like when the shades you know like i've always dreamed sometimes i'm having a great big tabernacle somewhere where i could reach down and pull this chart down come all the way across the platform and revelations and the interpretation of the lord has given me and take a pointer to start through there and bring these ages down let me get through that raise that one up pull the other one down like this and start on that and teach it through oh that would just be like a little heaven what just set the complete winner through just send it out with the lord i've never seen a year and six months in this book of revelation and and the tabernacle here that's what i like and and teaching i just love teaching all my i i think it's wonderful it gives the basis and settles the church of course there are many many more quotes from brother branham that support doctrine in teaching but i'm sure that these nine quotes show you the prophet's love and respect for sound doctrine and teaching economical attack against true doctrine message believers or followers of god's bible-based revelations given to his prophet william branham will be familiar with the ecumenical advances that took place in 2014 this was the year the reality of the one world religion began to take shape also known as the bundling of the tares according to christ in matthew 13 verse 30. in january 2014 anglican bishop tony palmer brought a personal video greeting from pope francis to kenneth copeland and the word of faith movement at copeland's annual ministers conference in fort worth texas let's watch portions of the video regarding doctrine and other subjects i believe that god has brought me here to this year's ministers conference in the spirit of elijah let me explain if you look carefully the spirit of elijah was on john the baptist to turn the hearts of the sons to the fathers and to turn the hearts of the fathers to the sons to prepare the way for the lord and we know that prophecy always has a double fulfillment and we know that elijah will come before the second coming as well and i've understood that the spirit of elijah is the spirit of reconciliation to return hearts to each other we know that the first thousand years there was one church it was called the catholic church and the word catholic means universal it doesn't mean roman catholic means if you're born again raise your hand if you're born again you're a catholic take back redeem what belongs to you we are catholics i've come to understand that diversity is divine it's division that's diabolic one it's the glory that glues us together not the doctrines it's the glory if you accept that christ is living in me and the presence of god is in me and the presence of god is in you that's all we need because god will sort out all our doctrines when we get upstairs this brought an end to the protest of luther brothers and sisters luther's protest is over is yours and i get a bit cheeky here because i challenge my protestant pastor friends if there is no more protest how can there be a protestant church maybe now we're all catholics again the protest is over the protest is over we receive your blessing it's very very important to us and we bless you with all of our hearts we bless you with all of our souls we bless you with all of our might and we thank you sir within that service friends were many heretical statements such as first palmer claiming he was under the anointing of elijah to restore the catholics and protestants but this was a lie for god had already sent brother william branham under the spirit of elijah to declare rome and the roman catholic church were the mother harlot and the protestants who held the mother's dogmas like the trinity doctrine were daughters of the mother harlot with thus saith the lord second palmer claimed the protest was over between the protestants and catholics third copeland and all the people under his ministry blessed the pope with all their souls a heretical statement because jesus said we are to love only the lord our god with all of our souls in matthew 22 37 this showed their souls were united with the pope for the one world religion fourth palmer claimed god doesn't care about our doctrine and he will sort it out later in heaven friends nothing could be further from the truth as we've already seen in the bible jesus christ and the apostle paul said the doctrine sorts out who you are right now remember the bible said avoid heretics jesus warned his disciples to avoid the leaven of the pharisees paul said this though in romans 16 verses 17 and 18. now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple now isn't it fitting that the word of faith movement is a prosperity gospel movement as they boast about their millions and billions of dollars boasting about private jets they purchase which reveals that they are not serving the lord jesus christ they're serving their own bellies their own interests friends false doctrines are heresies and according to romans 16 heresies prove that false teachers are not true followers of christ because their bellies are their gods know also that the pope then invited kenneth copeland and tony palmer to the vatican for a formal agreement of their anti-doctrine union here's a picture from copeland's website sadly bishop palmer passed away a few months after his claim to be elijah in july 2014 while we mourn the loss of his life especially for his family we must discern or judge that palmer was completely deceived regarding doctrine and that he did not have the spirit of elijah because brother branham had the spirit of elijah and god vindicated that palmer's message was completely opposite of brother branham's message and brother brown's message was thus saith the lord and i must say that there is a move around the message churches to belittle doctrine two examples include the jeffersonville movement and some fivefold ministry churches beginning with the jeffersonville movement they say they believe every word on brother branham's tapes which essentially means they have very little to no doctrinal backbone as brother branham said they hold many contradicting doctrines as i've already showed in some of my previous videos about how brother branham grew in his understanding on multiple doctrines such as the baptism or filling of the holy ghost whether or not to accept gifts from other people in churches see philippians 4 verse 17 divine healing and other revelations like the godhead so according to brother branham's life and teachings the current jeffersonville movement has no backbone they're a jellyfish church they have to believe every single thing on the tapes even though brother branham admitted there were mix-ups or mistakes on the tapes and said look in the bible when that happens next some fivefold ministry preachers also belittle doctrine but recently i heard the saddest statement from an american preacher he said tape churches return ministry churches and five-fold preaching churches are all the same in my humble opinion this man is deceived by the same spirit that was on the late tony palmer and please know that i reached out to this man on the phone and sent him a letter explaining his 24 heirs in a recent sermon he preached which included his attack on doctrine and claimed that all messed churches were unified and the same because doctrine didn't matter he was essentially trying to bring in ecumenical unity to message churches to justify his own rejection of sound doctrine such as having a home church friends return ministry churches idolize brother branham looking for his ministry to return which makes them neglect their own ministries or the current ministry of the holy ghost today remember according to saint paul in galatians 1 verses 6 through 12 to add delete or change paul's gospel was to be accursed the jeffersonville movement drastically changes the fivefold ministry saying brother branham fulfilled the five full ministry and they encourage less preaching from living preachers which breaks the command of ephesians 4 verses 8 through 16 and 2 timothy 4 verse 2. jeffersonville changes how the fivefold ministry operates saying we need less live preachers or less living preachers and we need more mechanical ministry and here's a quote where brother branham said machines are not to take the gospel but living men a god in the beginning that could have made the son preach the gospel or the winds preach the gospel or an angel preached the gospel but he our gain man for that purpose and he never changes it he never already ever ordained denominations he never ordained groups of man he ordained man to preach the gospel not machinery mechanical devices or any angelic being it was man remember the mark of the beast in the head is accepting the doctrine of the ecumenical system such as trinitarianism etc tony palmer kenneth copeland and pope francis hold this false line doctrine of doctrine doesn't matter and as i witnessed in some message circles some message preachers have the same belief may god have mercy on those who are so close to accepting the mark of the beast in their heads whether they're outside the message or in the message the uniting principle of the one world religious system is we don't need doctrine only a unity of experience but theirs is a false experience that celebrates the anointing while crucifying the love-based obedience to doctrine needed from the heart and soul of the believer as romans 6 17 says but god be thanked that ye were servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you misconceptions about doctrine i've heard numerous statements about doctrine from both message and non-message preachers that show their non-biblical attitude toward doctrine the first statement is something like this the message is not a doctrine it's a person the message is the person of christ while i understand what the brothers are saying it seems they're not taking a few quotes from brother branham into account for example in look away to jesus brother branham said i may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world so brother branham seems to separate the message from the person of christ let's listen to the quote i may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world for as john the baptist was sent before run the first coming so is the message to forerun the second coming so i understand what the brothers are saying but i also know the person of christ frequently issued instructions and teachings to his people like acts 1 verse 2 says until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen and jesus had already said if you loved him the person of the message you would keep his commands or doctrines in john 14 21 and he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him in fact if the person of christ ever came to you and instructed you to do anything then christ was giving you doctrine because doctrine is instruction first timothy 4 16 shows how true doctrine saves both the preacher and the hearers take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee friends consider the person of christ is the holy ghost but any command or instruction that he gives is the doctrine of the holy ghost so the person of christ and doctrine his own doctrine are very closely connected in fact in revelation 3 jesus christ himself said as many as i love i rebuke and chasten to rebuke is to correct or give instruction on how to change your life in order to please the lord more so the person of christ is always offering doctrinal instruction to the ones he loves a second statement is essentially the message is power not doctrine or there is no power in the doctrines of the message this statement over emphasizes power gifts and signs making message believers sound like the anointed ones at the end times who get results but deny the word this statement also assumes god always wants to heal and show miracles which is not the case according to saint paul and numerous bible examples jesus told paul his grace was sufficient when jesus didn't heal his eye trouble in second corinthians chapter 12. some message people are basically making god their errand boy to do whatever they want and forget we can't make god do anything they forget the simple but powerful truth that we must pray let thy will be done not mine and if the lord is willing he will do a miracle or manifest his power some message people forget jesus was known for his doctrine and power because they are inseparable the scripture says the signs follow the word or instruction for example moses signs follow the instruction that god gave him mark 16 says these signs follow them that believe and the person of christ said to go teach all nations or go instruct all nations with my doctrine in matthew chapter 28 and in the parallel passage of mark 16 jesus said the signs would follow them as they taught all nations a person that says doctrine doesn't have power has not read the four gospels lately nor the book of acts i've already shown how israel recognized both new doctrine and new power in the ministry of jesus christ and how they were inseparable from his ministry in the book of acts paul smote elimus blind in acts 13 verses 11 through 13 and the deputy was astonished at paul's doctrine or instruction third i've heard many message believers say i'd rather have the right spirit than the right doctrine that is a true statement but consider that holy ghost-filled saints like paul had both the right spirit and the right doctrine as evidenced by paul correcting peter's false doctrine in galatians 2 when he separated himself from the gentiles one prophet corrected another an observation i made is that every message believer believes that brother branham preached what paul preached as brother branham related this statement expressed by the saints who were already beyond the curtain of time friends if brother branham preached what paul preached which we know he did then brother branham gave us the same doctrine as paul remember that paul was the one who wrote about doctrine more than any other new testament writer romans 2 verse 16 says paul's gospel will judge the world and the secrets of men's hearts on the day of judgment so we should give ourselves to doctrine and power the testimony of both our doctrine and power will judge the world paul said don't you know that the saints will judge the earth and angels we should not despise doctrine but those called of god should give ourselves to it for god gives double honor to those who labor in doctrine notice paul never said people would give double honor to laborers and doctrine which shows the truth that many believers don't like doctrine because they don't like to obey god's instructions many believers simply have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof also using the symbolism of the pyramid brother branham said the bride ministry has to match jesus ministry when jesus returns this means the bride must match jesus in power but also in teaching and doctrine any honest bible reader knows paul was heavy on doctrine as he taught the how-to with gifts the how-to with marriage and divorce the how-to with widows the how-to with ties and offerings the how-to with alms and so much more it is so incredibly irresponsible to say that we do not need doctrine perhaps the brothers that preach we don't need doctrine have complexes or some other spiritual sickness without doctrine you would never tell anyone how to do anything you would just talk about salvation but never explain how to get it as we know it comes through genuine repentance according to acts 2 verse 38 but then you have to explain what is real repentance how do you really repent in order to be saved and then later fill with the holy ghost we must all consider these scriptures as well from the book of proverbs proverbs 1 7 says the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction fools despise doctrine proverbs 4 verse 13 take fast hold of instruction or doctrine let her not go keeper for she is thy life so those who hold on to the true doctrine of the holy ghost are holding on to life proverbs 6 verse 23 for the commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life so this is how you maintain a holy life is by being corrected on your doctrine and proverbs 9 verse 8 says reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and he will love thee the conclusion from these scriptures is that a born-again holy ghost-filled believer loves doctrine for doctrine shows him how to live while the foolish virgin despised doctrine and the sinners hate it and will never receive it in closing i hope this video has been a blessing to you really i could only scratch the surface on the scriptures related to doctrine and also there were many many other quotes about doctrine and teaching wherein brother branham said he loved both my prayer is that our church and your church will have the true bride doctrine as brother branham said and that jesus christ will continue to instruct us giving us true doctrine that will lay a hold on eternal life and eventually the rapture meeting in the air if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
