[0:02] greetings friends
[0:03] in the matchless name of the lord jesus
[0:06] christ
[0:07] in my desire to defend jesus's message
[0:10] of the hour
[0:11] and jesus's messenger of that message
[0:14] against false accusations i want to show
[0:16] that william branham did not pretend to
[0:18] speak in tongues
[0:20] as he's been accused of by some of those
[0:22] who have left
[0:23] god's message it seems his accusers have
[0:27] again
[0:27] jumped to a false conclusion in an
[0:30] attempt
[0:31] to discredit god's true prophet as
[0:34] you'll soon see
[0:35] clear proof of this but first before
[0:38] getting into the subject

[1:24] mysteries
[1:25] that jesus revealed to brother branham
[1:27] will be released in june of 2021
[1:31] now back to this video's topic here's a
[1:34] summary of the false accusation
[1:37] the accusers say brother branham claimed
[1:40] a few
[1:41] finnish phrases he knew and spoke
[1:44] to a woman during an april 11 1959
[1:48] discernment
[1:49] were an unknown tongue to him they
[1:52] claimed brother branham was pretending
[1:53] to speak in tongues
[1:55] but this accusation is false here's what
[1:58] really happened
[1:59] god used brother branham to give seven
[2:01] discernments
[2:02] during that april 11th 1959 sermon
[2:06] called watching his star
[2:08] during the fifth discernment brother
[2:09] branham did speak to a finnish woman
[2:12] about her high blood pressure and
[2:14] brother branham spoke
[2:15] a few finnish phrases to her as a
[2:18] friendly gesture
[2:20] the next day on april 12th brother
[2:23] branham was commenting about a group of
[2:25] armenian people
[2:26] who were blessed by the previous night's
[2:29] discernments
[2:30] in which brother branham told the name
[2:32] of a woman
[2:33] who didn't know english the armenian
[2:36] group
[2:36] wasn't referring to the finnish woman
[2:39] that brother branham spoke the finnish
[2:41] phrases to
[2:42] but when telling about the conversation
[2:44] with the armenian people
[2:46] brother branham accidentally confused
[2:48] the woman they were talking about
[2:50] with the finnish woman and we know
[2:52] that's true because brother branham
[2:53] didn't reveal the finnish woman's name
[2:56] like the armenian people were so excited
[2:59] about
[3:00] in the other discernment brother branham
[3:03] even seemed to catch his mistake
[3:05] because he admitted the discernment the
[3:07] armenian people were talking about
[3:09] might not have been the finnish woman
[3:12] this false accusation came to my
[3:14] attention during the september 2020
[3:18] discussion and debate i participated in
[3:21] i'll leave a link to the debate in the
[3:23] description below and the accusation
[3:26] comes up around the two hour 36 minute
[3:29] mark
[3:30] the quotes in question let's listen to
[3:33] both quotes you can understand the truth
[3:35] behind the false accusation here's the
[3:38] first quote
[3:39] it's the fifth discernment out of seven
[3:42] on the sermon
[3:43] and notice brother branham never tells
[3:44] her her name
[3:47] right straight back the back of this
[3:49] place you're about middleways of this
[3:51] aisle
[3:53] there's a little there's a woman and
[3:56] she's
[3:56] suffering with a high blood pressure
[4:01] she
[4:04] she's not from here she's a
[4:07] fan she's from finland
[4:10] if you believe sister you receive your
[4:13] healing
[4:14] you might rise up to your feet and
[4:17] accept your healing
[4:18] and be made well god bless you
[4:26] keith jesus
[4:31] hallelujah what was i saying
[4:40] if thou canst believe
[4:44] according to the google translate
[4:46] website the meanings of the finished
[4:48] phrases are
[4:50] joomla god bless
[4:54] ketos jesus thank you jesus
[4:58] here's the second quote from the next
[5:00] day in which brother branham is sharing
[5:02] a testimony
[5:03] of the armenian group who were blessed
[5:05] by the discernments the previous night
[5:09] i was enjoying some fellowship this
[5:12] morning with the
[5:13] armenian people of the the city
[5:17] at their church and to
[5:21] my surprise there was a lady who could
[5:25] interpret languages that
[5:29] last evening i was speaking here
[5:32] and was the holy spirit
[5:35] was speaking rather and was calling the
[5:39] people
[5:40] out in the meeting and telling them of
[5:42] their different afflictions
[5:44] and their diseases and sometimes i
[5:48] couldn't make them understand just
[5:51] who it was and then the holy spirit
[5:54] would call their name
[5:55] out as you've noticed him doing that
[6:00] and then they were telling me this
[6:02] morning which visions to me are
[6:04] just like a trance and they were telling
[6:08] me
[6:08] of a woman that i had called back in
[6:12] somewhere in the audiences and it told
[6:15] her that
[6:17] a certain affliction had gripped her
[6:22] but she was couldn't understand me
[6:25] because she didn't
[6:27] she was from a another country
[6:30] a finnish woman and then the
[6:34] holy spirit to show that he's no
[6:36] respecter person
[6:38] spoke through here and called her name
[6:40] and told her to bless god
[6:43] spoke in a language that i didn't know
[6:47] and call the woman and give
[6:50] who she was and something about to
[6:54] uh the lord's blessings upon her or
[6:57] something other in
[6:58] finnish language i don't even know
[7:02] english let alone finish
[7:05] so it goes to show that god
[7:08] speaks in all the languages and all
[7:11] human beings belong to him
[7:14] how wonderful
[7:19] notice the armenian people were joyful
[7:22] because brother branham
[7:23] called the woman's name so this proves
[7:26] they were not referring to the finnish
[7:27] woman
[7:28] because brother branham did not call her
[7:30] name based upon these quotes brother
[7:32] branham's accusers claim
[7:34] he pretended to speak in tongues but
[7:36] they are wrong
[7:37] they've made three major mistakes the
[7:40] first mistake
[7:42] the first mistake the accusers made was
[7:44] misunderstanding brother branham's words
[7:47] of what was i saying
[7:57] what was i saying
[8:04] if thou canst believe
[8:09] the accusers think this means what was i
[8:12] saying
[8:12] or what unknown language was i speaking
[8:14] in the accusers have misunderstood the
[8:17] context
[8:18] when brother branham said what was i
[8:20] saying it meant what was i preaching a
[8:22] few minutes ago
[8:24] notice the words if thou can't believe
[8:27] spoken right after this statement of
[8:29] what was i saying
[8:31] in other words brother branham was
[8:32] saying don't you remember me
[8:34] saying or preaching about your need to
[8:36] believe jesus christ was showing his
[8:38] messiah sign of discernment through my
[8:40] ministry
[8:42] here are the quotes that prove brother
[8:44] branham's context as he had said if thou
[8:46] canst believe
[8:47] twice before this third time he said it
[8:50] when he was making a parallel between
[8:52] the wise men following their sign
[8:54] a star and today's believers following
[8:57] the messiah sign
[8:58] of jesus's gift of discernment in
[9:01] brother branham's ministry
[9:03] and when they seen that star again the
[9:07] bible said they rejoice with exceeding
[9:10] great joy
[9:13] may i say tonight that god has a sign
[9:17] today it's a sign of his spirit
[9:22] that were jesus is there's life
[9:27] for he is life and the messiah
[9:31] sign has appeared that he's with us
[9:34] in us and will comfort us and will help
[9:37] us
[9:38] and will bless us and will lead us
[9:43] to that one who was scarred in the hands
[9:46] pierced in the sign but if you believe
[9:50] that the lord
[9:51] jesus who stood and could tell
[9:54] the apostle peter who he was
[9:57] and what his father's name was and all
[10:00] the signs that he did like that which
[10:02] they
[10:02] crucified him for those signs and killed
[10:05] him
[10:05] a witch made him a beelzebub a
[10:10] devil that same
[10:13] spirit that was on jesus christ is in
[10:16] his church
[10:19] we'll yield ourselves down to his spirit
[10:23] god will do the same thing do you
[10:25] believe it
[10:27] let us bow our heads that you would pull
[10:30] from this
[10:31] audience those who you're calling
[10:34] tonight
[10:35] and all praise will be yours lord and
[10:37] we'll go out of here tonight feeling
[10:40] that the same morning star a heavenly
[10:43] gift is leading us
[10:45] deeper depths and higher hypes to jesus
[10:48] christ
[10:49] for we asked it in his name and for his
[10:52] glory
[10:58] amen
[11:02] if thou canst believe
[11:07] shortly after this god gave brother
[11:10] branham a discernment and he repeated
[11:12] if thou canst believe let's listen
[11:16] just back over in this other section
[11:18] here a little woman sitting with her
[11:20] hand up praying
[11:24] and she is suffering with the
[11:27] there's something wrong with her head
[11:31] and she's got asthma in her throat
[11:34] and a heart condition
[11:38] sitting right here looking right at me
[11:41] her name
[11:42] is mrs henry she come from
[11:46] san diego the lord has
[11:49] blessed you go home and be well your
[11:52] faith has made you whole
[11:57] if thou canst believe
[12:03] then shortly after this brother branham
[12:06] spoke to the finnish woman about her
[12:08] high blood pressure after the holy ghost
[12:10] discerned the high blood pressure
[12:12] brother brahm said what was i saying or
[12:14] don't you remember me preaching about
[12:16] jesus's
[12:17] messiah sign of discernment if you can
[12:20] only believe
[12:22] the second mistake the second mistake
[12:25] the accusers made was misunderstanding
[12:28] brother branham's statement of
[12:30] spoke in a language that i didn't know
[12:32] that he made
[12:33] about one of the seven discernments the
[12:35] next day in his sermon
[12:37] be certain of god on april 12 1959
[12:41] the accusers think brother branham meant
[12:43] he spoke in finnish
[12:44] but brother branham meant the holy
[12:46] spirit interpreted his
[12:47] english into the foreign woman's native
[12:50] language according to the context of the
[12:53] sermon
[12:54] apparently brother branham's accusers
[12:57] didn't listen to the context
[12:59] according to the armenian people god
[13:01] told brother branham the literal name of
[13:03] the woman
[13:04] was discerned then god performed a
[13:07] miracle of hearing
[13:08] letting the woman understand brother
[13:10] branham's english
[13:11] in her native language let's listen to
[13:14] the quote
[13:15] and then the holy spirit to show that
[13:18] he's no respecter person
[13:20] spoke through here and called her name
[13:23] and told her to bless god
[13:26] spoke in a language that i didn't know
[13:30] and call the woman and give
[13:33] who she was and something about to
[13:37] uh the lord's blessings upon her or
[13:40] something other in
[13:41] finnish language i don't even know
[13:44] english let alone finish
[13:48] so it goes to show that god
[13:51] speaks in all the languages and all
[13:54] human beings belong to him
[13:57] how wonderful
[14:03] and if we could only grasp
[14:06] that this afternoon that his goodness to
[14:09] that little
[14:10] woman finish or whatever she was last
[14:12] night
[14:13] to be sure that her faith would be
[14:16] recognized
[14:18] he called her in her own language
[14:21] wonderful now overseas many times we see
[14:25] that happen in the foreign countries
[14:28] that i'll be standing speaking and it'll
[14:31] turn
[14:31] right back around and use my language
[14:33] and call people their names and
[14:35] everything just like it does here
[14:36] in their own native language that's what
[14:40] i call
[14:40] pentecost i believe it that's
[14:44] the holy spirit
[14:48] so see friends here are the seven
[14:50] discernments and you can see
[14:52] the only literal names given and
[14:55] discerned were mrs allen
[14:57] the first discernment mrs henry the
[15:00] second discernment
[15:01] and mrs delaney the seventh and last
[15:04] discernment
[15:05] the finnish woman was the fifth
[15:06] discernment and her literal name
[15:08] wasn't called based upon the
[15:11] descriptions of the armenian people
[15:13] it seems the discernment they were
[15:15] testifying about was either mrs allen
[15:18] mrs henry or mrs delaney and not the
[15:20] finnish woman
[15:22] it seems brother branham just made an
[15:24] accidental mistake thinking the armenian
[15:26] people were talking about the finnish
[15:28] woman
[15:29] brother branham described god using him
[15:31] to speak in a language he didn't know
[15:34] but he wasn't talking about himself
[15:36] speaking in an unknown language
[15:38] rather he was referring to him speaking
[15:40] in english
[15:41] and then the holy spirit interpreting
[15:42] his english words
[15:44] in the here's native language which was
[15:47] what happened on the day of pentecost
[15:49] peter and the holy ghost-filled
[15:50] galileans were speaking in galilean
[15:53] but the 17 nations of people were
[15:55] hearing them
[15:56] in their native languages so the miracle
[15:59] was the hearing
[16:00] it's my humble opinion that mrs allen
[16:02] was likely the testimony
[16:04] the armenians were referring to because
[16:06] brother branham was
[16:07] afraid she wasn't catching god speaking
[16:10] to her
[16:11] through brother branham and brother
[16:12] branham said a quick humble prayer
[16:14] for god to do something so she would not
[16:17] miss her blessing
[16:18] but i could be wrong here's the audio of
[16:21] mrs allen's discernment
[16:23] here look this away just a moment
[16:28] right over in this direction here
[16:33] i see a little woman i do not know her
[16:37] but she's praying
[16:39] she's wearing a little flat hat
[16:42] and she's suffering in over her stands
[16:45] that
[16:48] light
[16:50] she's suffering with her something wrong
[16:52] with her eyes
[16:54] and her ears i'm afraid the woman is not
[16:59] catching who i'm speaking of lord god
[17:02] say something or do something and she
[17:04] won't miss it
[17:08] her name is mrs allen all right do you
[17:12] believe that you will be healed
[17:14] then rise and be made well in the name
[17:16] of the lord jesus
[17:18] now
[17:22] be thankful that's the way to do it
[17:30] the third mistake the accusers failed to
[17:33] continue listening to the quote
[17:35] because brother branham admitted the
[17:37] discernment the armenian people were
[17:39] blessed by
[17:40] may not have been the finnish woman at
[17:42] first brother branham said it was a
[17:44] finnish woman
[17:44] but later said it could have been a
[17:46] different nationality
[17:48] here's the quote and
[17:52] if we could only grasp that this
[17:54] afternoon that
[17:55] his goodness to that little woman finish
[17:59] or whatever she was last night
[18:01] to be sure that her faith would be
[18:04] recognized
[18:06] he called her in her own language
[18:09] wonderful
[18:13] notice brother branham said finnish or
[18:15] whatever she was
[18:18] all these facts prove brother branham
[18:19] was not pretending to speak in tongues
[18:21] but was giving god glory for
[18:23] interpreting his english words
[18:25] in the native language of one of the
[18:27] women in his discernment ministry the
[18:30] night before
[18:32] in closing friends
[18:35] paul asked timothy to not be ashamed of
[18:37] the lord's testimony
[18:39] nor of paul's testimony paul told
[18:42] timothy to be a partaker
[18:44] of the afflictions of the gospel because
[18:46] it's a holy calling
[18:47] and worldly people despise the holiness
[18:50] of god
[18:51] second timothy 1 verses 8 and 9 says be
[18:54] not thou therefore ashamed
[18:56] of the testimony of our lord nor of me
[18:58] his prisoner
[19:00] but be thou partaker of the afflictions
[19:02] of the gospel
[19:03] according to the power of god who hath
[19:06] saved us
[19:06] and called us with an holy calling
[19:10] not according to our works but according
[19:12] to his own purpose and grace
[19:14] which was given us in christ jesus
[19:16] before the world began
[19:19] i encourage you to use this scripture as
[19:21] a reminder
[19:22] to be unashamed of the true gospel of
[19:24] the lord jesus christ
[19:26] and his prophet brother william branham
[19:29] it seems the attacks on brother
[19:31] branham's character teachings and
[19:32] ministry
[19:33] will only increase as the rapture
[19:35] approaches but we have the spirit of
[19:37] truth
[19:38] and therefore will be guided by the holy
[19:40] spirit into all truth according to jesus
[19:43] in john 16 verse 13. as false
[19:47] accusations come and they will wait upon
[19:50] the lord jesus christ
[19:52] and he will renew your strength and give
[19:54] you the answer
[19:55] in due season and friends never feel bad
[19:59] for defending
[20:00] the gospel of jesus christ the true
[20:02] revelation
[20:03] of the message of this hour and god's
[20:05] prophet
[20:06] in philippians 1 verse 17 paul said
[20:09] knowing that i am set
[20:11] for the defense of the gospel so paul
[20:14] was set or
[20:15] appointed in the greek to defend the
[20:18] gospel
[20:19] the word defense in the greek means a
[20:21] verbal defense
[20:23] speech in defense a reasoned statement
[20:27] or argument we also know the scripture
[20:30] says
[20:30] prove all things hold fast that which is
[20:33] good
[20:34] and additionally earnestly contend for
[20:37] the faith
[20:37] which was once given to the saints the
[20:40] bible-based message of brother branham
[20:42] is thus saith the lord because it's
[20:45] according to the true revelation of the
[20:47] scripture
[20:48] not every word on tape is thus saith the
[20:50] lord as brother branham taught
[20:52] so by the holy spirit we must be careful
[20:54] what we listen to on the tapes
[20:56] as brother branham said and rightly
[20:58] divide the word of truth
[21:00] the bible revelations are thus saith the
[21:02] lord because brother random gave us over
[21:04] 30 thus saith the lords
[21:06] regarding doctrine and prophecy and the
[21:09] scripture
[21:10] promised that elias would restore all
[21:13] things
[21:13] before the second coming of jesus christ
[21:16] and brother branham was anointed with
[21:18] the spirit of elijah
[21:19] to restore the apostolic faith
[21:23] if you have any questions comments or

[21:30] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[21:33] the desire
[21:34] of your heart
