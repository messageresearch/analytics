Description:
Christians husbands should seek to manifest the love of Jesus Christ to their wives and children, as Christ manifested His love to His bride, the church. Many Bible Scriptures and quotes from God's prophet, William Branham, are presented to validate this truth. 

Domestic abuse is a clear sign that the abuser is possessed by demons.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question recently i was asked if i could teach on how husbands should love their wives i believe this was a noble and godly request and i wanted to make a video about this for the glory of god i'll be using scriptures quotes from brother branham and findings from a book called his needs her needs by willard harley jr some may criticize me for using this book by willard harley but i feel that's a great misunderstanding anyone that would criticize me for using a book from someone who doesn't believe the message would also have to criticize brother branham freezing books from people that didn't have his same revelation such as clarence larkin which brother adam used lots of clarence larkin's information and teachings when he preached the seven church ages and the seven seals and also the book how did it happen by rachel hazeltine which was a book brother branham used when he preached the seven church ages in 1960 and got a lot of helpful historical church information from mrs hasseltine's book i was reading here and a woman that wrote a hazelton mrs hazel and others of the nicene council said that she went to their card at the oxford to get the card for the um the life of saint uh martin and this fellow said but he wasn't canonized by the roman church certainly not he protested the thing started st patrick another thing that i'd like to read you it's found in the book um how did it happen and this is by the historians and um how did it happen by rc hazelton the history of the early churches and here on page 180 the spiritual gifts in irena's town so we understand from brother branham's example of using books from people that didn't completely understand the message that a holy ghost filled preacher can read other sources outside the message and then rightly divide the word of truth or find the true information within outside sources and then use the true information not the false information from those sources take that true information and find the scriptures that teach that and then share it with god's people that was brother branham's example and that's how ministers should rightly divide the word of truth today so my outline is going to be very basic i'm going to start with scriptures and quotes and then at the end i'll look at how domestic abuse is always wicked and wrong and domestic abuse is a sign that a man or woman is demon-possessed and friends this subject is close to my heart over the course of my ministry three pastors have had me preach marriage banquets at their churches and so i've taught marriage banquets a total of six times and two of those pastors had told me that the reason they had me preach a marriage banquet at their church was because they saw the genuine love of jesus christ between my wife and i and also between my wife and i and our children and i'm not saying that to brag in any way or try to be prideful god knows i don't want any pride in my life but i'm sharing it so it'll help our viewers understand that if a family has the true love of jesus christ it will be undeniable like jesus said it will be like the salt of the earth the love of christ in a family will be like the light in a dark world and again as jesus said if you're a true disciple or learner from jesus christ then the whole world will be able to see the love of god in your life because jesus said his disciples would be known for their love one for another bible scriptures and quotes from brother branham i'm going to begin by going over some notes from a sermon i preached in 2009 called irresistible love my text was from song of solomon chapter one verses two through four and my emphasis is on the verse that said thy love is better than wine the first quote from brother branham i used was about family problems are caused by the neglect of love let's listen to this quote from hear ye him is 1957 real genuine christian right this place among believers oh there is something to do in your little she was looking for somebody to love her and when you promised your husband he was looking for somebody when he come in and weary from working all day some little guys that put her arms around him and curry said his hair turned out she loved him that's what causes separation families is the neglect of law that's what causes the separation churches neglect of love we've got to have love this is a beautiful quote from brother branham notice he tells us what causes separations and families it's a neglect of love so if you have a problem in your family your marriage or between the parents and children it's because there's a lack of love and christians must manifest the love of jesus christ to everyone in their family next i showed how the man is responsible for his household genesis 3 16 said eve's desire shall be to thy husband adam and he shall rule over thee so the man rules the home first corinthians 11 verse 3 the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man so the man is called by god to lead the house but he has to lead the house in love next i use a quote from brother random to show how a man who doesn't lead with love is a weak spiritual man this quote is from painted face jezebel 1956 let's listen to the man i'm quote of you as christian brother well let your wife do such a thing as that it shows what you were made out of that's right now women you are to say amen to you i guess because he's the ruler that's right and the way he lets you it's his fault god's going to hold him responsible for it that's right if you ain't man enough to take up and touch your own house in order god be merciful to you that's right because the bible said in the very beginning that he shall rule over thee now she's not a doormat now she's your sweetheart see but she used to sit down and talk to her and read it with her and tell her and read the bible and pray together these things wouldn't be in the church then if you've done that that's right notice brother branham said god is going to hold the man responsible for the state of his household this statement along with the scriptures we've already read ought to cause brothers to daily seek god for god's leadership and god's help and god's strength and christ's love in order to rule their homes the right way as the scripture says let's be strong in the lord and the power of his might in this next quote notice how brother branham said satan works harder on the wife because the bible says she's the weaker vessel let's listen to the quote i guess your sweetheart came too i know you feel that way about her you feel your sweetheart and that's why we i know we all thus christians feel that way about our wives and they're still our sweethearts i hope it never changes in my family and never changes in your family and we always feel that way about our wives after all they stand side by side with us to help us fight these battles and we need them although i've said many scorching things to them but it wasn't in such a way to make them feel bad is such a way to keep them in line with the gospel and uh see that satan's tool where he works so hard is that with his first instrument he's never changed he stays right there and he's we just have to pray for our sisters constantly of course they pray for us to and together with one unit we march forward like an undefeated army with our great chief captain christ jesus this word going before us making a way for us so i hope the brothers gain from this quote that they need to pray often for their wives now please understand a holy ghost-filled woman is anointed she's more than a conqueror she has the baptism of the holy ghost in her soul but as the scripture says in first peter she's a weaker vessel women are naturally weaker physically and spiritually they're not made to rule the home so the man was built spiritually to lead the home and brother bran points out from the beginning that satan began working in the garden of eden on eve first rather than adam so we see this principle that satan goes after the weaker ones first and that should remind us of the scripture that says those of us who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak so these scriptures and quotes tell us that brothers need to be constantly praying they need to have a very strong prayer life praying for their wives their families their childrens their churches their brothers need to be leaders by example with the love of jesus christ next i used matthew 19 verse 5 where jesus quoted genesis and said a man shall cleave to his wife and they shall be one flesh if you look this word cleave up in the greek it means to be glued upon to join oneself closely to stick to so as husbands and fathers we have to be initiators with our wives and our children we have to go talk to them in love we have to be glued to them we have to be constantly involved in their lives we have to do things with them in fact do as much as you can with your family because the bible says you should be glued to them joined to them you cannot let the enemy distract you from your first responsibility which is your home life and to go along with this i used ephesians 5 25 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it a holy ghost-filled man should seek the lord on how he can give of himself or sacrifice of his own time in order to serve his wife and his children and a man's inspiration for this is christ christ gave his own life in order to pay the penalty of his wife's sins jesus paid for all the sins on the cross and so husbands should look at christ and ask themselves how can i give of myself to serve my wife and my children the problem is many men are selfish today and they're fulfilling the wrong scripture first timothy 3 they're lovers of their own selves rather than lovers of god if men and husbands really loved god the husband would be glued to his wife glue to his children sacrificing his own desires and his own plans in order to serve his wife and serve his children i also pointed out some observations in this sermon that jesus did not wait for his wife to make things right before he reached out to her in love he didn't wait for the church to repent he went and sacrificed himself on the cross first for the joy that was set before him so brothers should do the same the brothers in love should go to their wives to make something right or their children to make something right and in jesus example he overcame depression to do this matthew 26 verses 36 through 46 and in particular verse 37 says jesus and began to be sorrowful and very heavy in the greek this means the strongest of the greek words for depression so in order for jesus to give himself up for the church he had to overcome depression so this encourages our brothers who are husbands and fathers to overcome any spiritual struggle or any spiritual obstacle you're facing in order to serve your wife or serve your children give yourself lose your own life and then you'll find your life as jesus christ also said that's a true follower of christ someone who takes up their cross daily and lives for others rather than living for themselves and here's a quote from brother branham that says christ loved us so much that he took everything on his shoulders when he went to the cross so in other words love will make us carry a burden so if a brother has a burden in his family he needs to be like christ and let love motivate him to overcome the problem or the obstacle in the family with love let's listen to the [Music] the quote of all the world the healing ministry that we have in the world today rested on his shoulders the healing of congressman upshaw resting on his shoulders the healing of my blind eyes and again it's all about love here's a quote where brother brahm talks about how the garden of gethsemane was a conference and the holy spirit asked jesus do you love them enough to go to the cross let's listen to the quote but now the father said are you willing is your love for your brethren great enough is your love for that sinful staking world that you were born in do you love them enough to forfeit your life do you love them enough to take their place to bear their sins to the hardest crucial death you there could be nothing die that kind of death but him and in that conference such a decision was made until blood got to his brow he was under a strain the sins of the world was upon him and then he looked into the face of the dub and said it's not my will but thy will be done so brothers let's ask ourselves that question do we love our wife enough to be glued to her to be joined to her to be constantly concerned about her spiritual welfare brothers let's ask ourselves do we love our children enough to be glued to them to spend time with them and to care about their spiritual welfare rather than be distracted with our personal wants and desires and hopes and goals next i'm going to share some bible principles i preach from a sermon also from 2009 called espoused to christ and after i preached this as a guest preacher at another church numerous couples came up to the altar repenting and seeking restitution for their marriage one important question i asked was why do people fall in love during courtship i got this thought from from willard harley's book his needs her needs which i've already referenced he said they marry because they've enjoyed what happened during the courtship so much that they want it to continue for life brother branham also gave us this principle let's listen to this quote from time tested memorials of god where brother ram tells us to always be sweethearts in other words the way you treated each other at the beginning of the relationship should continue for the rest of the relationship if not the couple has left their first love they've backslidden from their original condition and need to repent and go back and do the first works let's listen to the quote a man losing their affections for their wife and don't uh love them as they did when they were sweetheart shame on you you ought to do it she's always your sweetheart absolutely that's the part she should be and you should treat her like that oh never let that little honeymoon cease because it isn't going to in heaven you're going to be just perfectly warm there that's why it's all well looks like some women ought to say amen to them [Music] why didn't you say something or somebody back there did you thank you sister that's very good brother cox that's for you everywhere you are you know all right yes sir and we should never forget to honor each other always be sweethearts never let it cease so notice brothers we cannot lose our affection for our wives brothers you have to love your wife as you did at the beginning and brother braham said shame on you brothers if you don't love your wife as you did at the beginning and brothers remember that's your responsibility to keep your first love in your marriage and also your relationship with christ god made you the leader and so god has equipped you as you seek god's face and his continual anointing of the holy ghost to keep the love alive in your marriage and also the love between you and your children now a beautiful point that harley brought out in his book is that is that men and women each have five needs that they need to meet again i have to rightly divide this and i found that all five of these are in scripture now for the sake of this video i'm just going to go over the needs of the wife because this video is focusing on how husbands should love their wives so after thousands of interviews dr harley did with married couples through counseling he found that these are the five needs of a wife that a husband needs to meet and all of them can be backed up by scripture the first is she needs family commitment and we see this in genesis 18 verses 17 through 19. these scriptures show how abraham was committed to his family god said i know abraham he'll command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord and to do justice and judgment so notice abraham as the man the ruler of the home was going to teach his children and his family how to keep the way of the lord that wasn't sarah's job that was abraham's job and that's the commitment that every christian wife needs she needs a husband that's going to lead the children into keeping the ways of the lord second the wife needs financial support this is taught in 1st thessalonians 3 10 and 1st timothy 5 verse 8. men need to be hard workers in fact brother branham said the christian is the one that will work hard lazy men of course are not born again likely not even saved only god knows but the bible says a man that's fervent in the holy spirit will also be fervent in his business a third need for the wives is honesty and openness according to hebrews 13 18 and 1st timothy 2 verse 2 wives really need to know what the husband is thinking planning and feeling husbands should not hide things from their wives husbands should not be dishonest but always honest hebrews 13 18 says that we do all things willing to live honestly many marriage problems are caused when men are dishonest with their wives either through a lie or just withholding the truth from their wives in 1st timothy 2 verse 2 it says we should lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty so there's no room for dishonesty in a marriage the bible commands us to have all honesty so if a husband is lied or withheld truth he needs to repent of that say he's sorry and seek god's power to not do that again the fourth need is conversation and this is found in song of solomon 2 verse 14. the scripture says o my dove that art in the clefs of the rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet as thy voice and that countenance is comely so we see from the scripture that solomon and the shulamite enjoyed having conversation they wanted to hear each other's voice they wanted to talk and have fellowship today we might call it connecting a good husband will want to connect with his wife talk about the day talk about the family talk about the future talk about lots of things and a husband should be willing to do that you know some sisters are with their children all day and maybe the first time they get to talk to an adult all day is when her husband comes home so brothers we need to see that that's our responsibility we're to be glued to our wives i know in my home i like to come home from work and like to spend a few minutes talking with my wife having conversation and i do that because i know the scripture says that here in song of solomon but also in 1st peter 3 where the bible tells husbands to dwell with their wives according to knowledge that means a deep christian understanding of their wives needs and also in my marriage i build it into my schedule where i can spend at least one time a week taking my wife out on a date in order to talk to her have this conversation and of course just having this date time helps to meet some of the other needs that she has such as honesty and openness and this leads into the next need she has is affection so the fifth need is affection and this is found in romans 12 10 first corinthians 7 3 and 2 samuel 12 24. romans 12 10 says be kindly affection one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another so affection means loving tenderly so this is tenderness all christians should be tender with each other and especially husbands should be tender with their wives and tender with their children and this means showing honor not dishonor not disrespect but loving respect and again preferring one another the man must place the needs of his wife and children above his own just like christ did first corinthians 7 3 says let the husband render unto the wife do benevolence and likewise also the wife unto her husband benevolence means kindness or goodwill all things a husband does for his wife should be done in good will and kindness we see this also when david comforted his wife bathsheba after the death of their first son he showed her comfort which means moved with pity to have compassion to ease her burdens so if a husband meets all these five needs of his wife then it's undeniable that he'll be fulfilling his role as leader of his wife and children leading with the love of jesus christ and if he leads like this in love the problems in the home will be greatly decreased because he's choosing to not neglect love for his wife and his children before moving on i do want to read the five needs that a man has that his wife should try to meet first recreational companionship second physical intimacy third admiration or respect fourth domestic support and fifth he needs an attractive spouse so again i highly recommend this book his needs her needs remember the author is not a message believer but if someone has the holy ghost like brother branham said you have a buzzer in your soul or you have discernment in your soul when you read something that's not scriptural you just get rid of it you don't pay attention to it but when you see something that's scriptural you can take that and apply it to your own life and become a more humble obedient christian having that discernment is what brother branham called having the thinking man's filter the filter for everything we see read and come in contact with is the word of god and the spirit of that word the holy ghost baptism is in our souls so we have a thinking man's filter built into our souls and remember brothers god is going to help you love your wife and children because the bible said god's favors upon the married proverbs 18 22 whosoever a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth the favor of the lord when you're married in christian marriage you've got god's favor you have his grace and so you maintain that by constantly seeking the face of god repenting of your sins and trying to grow in the grace and knowledge of the lord becoming a better husband and a better father to your children also proverbs 19 14 says houses and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the lord one note i had from a sermon was how husbands love in marriage so to summarize husbands are called to active willing and complete self-sacrifice for his wife's benefit and that's from ephesians 5 where christ modeled that he gave himself for the church his wife second husbands are called to love and cherish them and cherish in the greek means to keep warm with tender love according to 1st thessalonians 2 verse 7 and also called to nourish which means nurture or bring up his wife and his children according to ephesians 6 verse 4 this love of jesus christ coming out of the husband's soul will produce sanctification by the word for the purpose of holiness here's some more quotes from god's prophet brother branham in this first one again from time tested memorials of god 1957 brother branham corrected a catholic boy the catholic man was married and he tried to tell brother branham that he didn't have to kiss and hug his wife and brother brahm said whoop wait a minute boy you're wrong let's listen to the quote catholic boy come to me not long ago his wife was separating said billy i hate to come to you i'm a catholic you're a protestant said to preach from me i'm a home while ago and i said what's the matter him he said well he told me he said i drink a little and said of a night i'll work hard and say my wife thinks i ought to come in every night and kiss her and hug her and make me laugh just like if we fixing to get married so we married got a bunch of kids and said we that's time i said whoop wait a minute boy you're wrong you're wrong that's just the same as it was before you're married see you must always remember i said she's 40 years old now at the time where she really needs your attention so see friends this quote supports the fact that women have a need for affection holding hands hugging kissing these are important needs god has already built into the woman that the husband has to meet so again so the husband cannot leave his first love and not give his wife the affection that she needs the wife needs the husband to treat her the same way he did before they got married and also when they started their marriage he has to keep the honeymoon relationship alive in the same sermon from 1957 brother brahm talked about how a couple was going to be divorced but through his counsel and through his prayer the couple repented of their divorce and came back together and brother branham gave the credit to the restoration of the marriage to love he says love conquers everything let's listen to the quote love conquers everything this is love you can have all your signs and evidences and just giving love that settles it for me oh my in the next quote brother branham is saying god never respects you for what you were but what you currently are so husbands we should ask ourselves how good of a husband are you right now it's from question answers on the seals 63. let's listen to the quote this nation is living off of a past reputation of what the forefathers was see and that's really think we'll be safe god never respected israel on what they was what they had been what they was then in the next quote brother branham says are you willing to learn this is a great problem i see amongst message people they start out on fire or excited enthusiastic about the message they're joyful but as time goes on they're deceived of the enemy they lose their joy they lose their enthusiasm and this especially happens in marriages men get to a spot where they don't want to learn how to love their wives better in this quote brother ram compares a person who won't learn to a donkey so we can't be spiritual donkeys we have to be spiritual pedigrees as brother ram said as well let's listen to the quote a mule is the most dumbest thing i know of no matter what you ever do you can't teach him anything why he's a hybrid that's all you you're never learning nothing or teach him anything you just sit there you can call him he has no affections you'll stand there with his ears out oh he don't know and here's another quote from perseverance that speaks the same truth what have we been taught lately it's from 1962 let's listen to the quote but i immune he's dumb you know you can just talk to him and he'll wait all his life to get kicked before he dies and he you can tell him you can't teach him nothing he's hard-headed you can try to be gentle to him he'll stick sticking his ears out snowing oh days of miracles his past there's no such thing with that brain but a good third red pedigreed horse and his teach him anything he knows who his pappy is who his man he is who his great-grandfather and great-grandmother he knows the history all the way back and so is where the good petty green christian is born of the holy ghost you don't have to say i was met with this baptist i had changed the press for jordan luther he was born by the holy ghost into the family begotten of pedigree runs from the pentecostals amen i like that inoculation so some things to consider we must be willing to relearn how we loved at the beginning and also try to love again brothers we must be willing to humble ourselves repent for the wrongs we've done and accept christ's power to not commit that wrong again and we must consider this question what have we learned lately about our spouses or ourselves we must take what we've learned and apply it to our lives and become a better husband and a better father to our children now you might ask yourself how can one man do all of that the answer is he has to stretch because he's the husband now if you look in easton bible's dictionary the word husband comes from the words house band in other words the husband connects and keeps together the whole family the husband's like a rubber band and he's got to stretch in order to handle and cover and hold all the needs of his wife and the children so husbands keep that in mind you are the husband you're the house band you've got to pray seek the holy ghost for every situation and your prayers must wrap around the needs of your wife and your children you must accept this role because it's god's role to you as leader you have more responsibility than your wife and children god's going to hold you responsible for your family so by the love of the holy ghost and power of god you've got to hold your family together hold them up in prayer before the lord and jesus says if you ask you shall receive if you seek you shall find if you knock the door will be opened unto you responsibility is for a real man the real man connects to each person in the house he loses sight of his worldly desires and focuses on the spiritual needs of the family through his example in teaching all other house members grow and change for the better god the father is the best example for all men desiring to be more responsible with their wives and children he's the perfect father the husband must know he's going to be stretched he must bend but not break he must not compromise on the word of god the husband's material is stronger than the woman's as she's the weaker vessel the bible says this in first peter 3 7 likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered husbands are ultimately responsible for teaching their households and the spiritual conditions of the wives and children husbands are told not to discourage or bring their children to wrath which is a spiritual condition when a husband obeys ephesians 5 and loves his wife with christ's love her spiritual state will be greatly improved as well because love works by faith a husband's love upon his wife will motivate her to love her children better her faith in christ will be stronger the children will learn from an early age to have faith in god and to love god and repent of their sins and be baptized at young ages remember god told moses to tell israel to teach your children diligently deuteronomy 6 verses 7 through 9 and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walk us by the way and when thou liest down and when thou rise us up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shall write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy gates one more personal thought brothers how well you love your wife shows how much you love god christ's love for us drove him to the greatest self-sacrifice the world ever saw the cross christ laid down his life for the joy that was set before him as he died for sinners but he also died because of his submission and trust in the father's will he said not my will but thine be done and as jesus told peter peter's love for jesus was measured by his love for others john 21 17 he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas loveth thou me peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things now notice that i love thee jesus saith unto him feed my sheep so husbands your love for jesus my love for jesus will be measured and also seen by how we take care of our wives and take care of our children we should care for them with love we should care for them in humility and then others will know that we truly love jesus christ domestic violence is always evil wicked and wrong over the years i've got numerous emails from brothers and sisters who've experienced domestic violence let me clearly say that all christians should always condemn all forms of domestic violence a man should never hurt his wife or children behaviors like hitting beating dragging wounding are all signs of demonic possession a holy ghost-filled christian is filled with god's love not satan's hatred this is easily seen in acts 19. acts 19 verses 14 through 16 speaks of the seven sons of skeva when the seven sons of skiva tried to cast out a demon in jesus name but they didn't have the faith and authority like paul had and the bible said the man in whom the demons were leaped upon them and wounded them and those seven sons were beaten and wounded and they left the place naked we see those same demon powers today any husband that wounds his wife or children is demon-possessed again colossians 3 19 says husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them ephesians 5 25 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it here's some quotes from brother branham the first one brother bram says men do not have no right to beat their wives drag them around or do any of those things brother brown said she should always be your sweetheart in the next quote brother brown said your wife is not your doormat she's your sweetheart let's listen to the quote a man's not supposed to use that authority over a woman just because he's her ruler god is her ruler above you brother see and if your wife is doing something wrong then going to now you can we got a right to tell her she's supposed to listen to you but you haven't got no right to beat her or drag her around or do those things no god made man a helpmate not a doormat remember she she was your sweetheart she should always be that in the next quote brother brahm says if you love your wife you wouldn't hurt her if you love your children you wouldn't want to do anything wrong to them let's listen to the quote you wouldn't hurt your little baby you'd hate to do that you'd hate to hurt the feelings of your wife or your husband how much more your lord and savior would you if you love him if you lost your wife you wouldn't hurt her if you love your children you wouldn't want to do anything wrong to them and how about your heavenly father in closing i hope this video was a blessing friends i felt led of the holy spirit i felt a burden on my heart to be able to give some scriptural guidance for our husbands that they will follow the example of jesus christ and love their wife and love their children as christ loved the church and gave himself for it the divine love of jesus christ is the answer to every domestic problem no family is going to be perfect and never have problems but the bible said when a christian is born again of the holy ghost he reigns in life by jesus christ so men that are truly baptized with the holy ghost will rule by the power of the holy ghost and they'll rule by love and the man will love his wife as christ love the church and love his children with tender affectionate compassionate christian love friends jesus christ does not want wives abused or children abused abuse is the work of satan and anyone that's been abused has to go to the proper authorities demon-possessed people if they won't repent will only keep doing the same cycle of abuse over and over again jesus wants his people to have a haven of rest the christian home should be a sanctuary of
