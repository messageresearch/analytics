[0:03] a human faith in their faith of God and
[0:07] you must have The Godly face to believe
[0:10] [Music]
[0:13] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:18] this video is to explain the different
[0:20] types of feelings love Faith fruits and
[0:25] more that lead to Greater revelation
[0:29] I personally believe these teachings are
[0:32] Revelations of the Holy Ghost because
[0:34] they help dispel confusion about these
[0:37] spiritual attributes and this helps the
[0:40] Bride of Jesus Christ to be more mature
[0:42] in understanding as Paul told us to be
[0:45] men in understanding in First
[0:47] Corinthians 14 20 Brethren be not
[0:50] children in understanding how be in
[0:52] Malice be children but in understanding
[0:55] be men
[0:57] also understanding these subjects will
[0:59] help us grow in Grace and knowledge or
[1:02] understanding of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04] as Peter said in second Peter 3 18 but
[1:08] grow in Grace and in knowledge of our
[1:10] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be
[1:13] glory both now and forever amen
[1:17] also brother Braham told us in the
[1:19] church age book we can have more of the
[1:22] same Revelation and that is what is
[1:24] happening today brother Branham has been
[1:26] off the scene for nearly 56 years but
[1:29] the Holy Ghost is still guiding
[1:31] Believers into all truth as Jesus
[1:34] Promised in John 16 verse 13 how be it
[1:38] when he the spirit of Truth is come he
[1:40] will guide you into all Truth for he
[1:43] shall not speak of himself but
[1:45] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:47] speak and he will show you things to
[1:49] come
[1:51] friends it is not that our Revelation is
[1:54] greater than God's prophet
[1:56] but we do have more support
[1:59] both scripturally and scientifically in
[2:02] some cases for the same Revelations God
[2:05] revealed to brother Branham just like
[2:07] brother Branham said
[2:09] the example brother Ram gave in the
[2:10] church age book was with Jesus's first
[2:12] coming the first prophecy was Genesis 3
[2:15] 15. the serpent would bruise Jesus's
[2:19] foot but Jesus would crush Satan's head
[2:21] and then down through the next four
[2:23] thousand years there was many many
[2:24] Prophecies of Jesus's first coming
[2:27] so over 4 000 years God gave more
[2:30] information brother Rams says about the
[2:32] same Revelation well the same thing is
[2:34] happening today
[2:35] as we are closer to the second coming of
[2:37] the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is
[2:40] giving us more understanding more
[2:42] information about the same Revelations
[2:46] let's listen to this quote from the
[2:47] church age book about more information
[2:49] of the same revelation
[2:53] Paul knew that first revelation was
[2:55] correct
[2:56] God can't give a first revelation then a
[2:58] second revelation
[3:00] if he did he would be changing his mind
[3:03] he can give a revelation and then add to
[3:05] it as he did in the Garden of Eden when
[3:07] he promised the seed to the woman and
[3:09] then later designated that seed had to
[3:12] come through Abraham
[3:13] and then later said it would come by the
[3:15] same Bloodlines in David
[3:17] but it was the same revelation
[3:20] it only gave the people more information
[3:21] to help them receive and understand it
[3:25] God's word can't change
[3:28] seed came exactly as revealed Hallelujah
[3:33] when we have Revelation on some of these
[3:35] topics we're going to get into we have
[3:37] the correct understanding a mystery is
[3:40] revealed so topics that were Mysteries
[3:42] now become Revelations and even some
[3:45] false doctrines can be dispelled or
[3:47] dismissed with the correct biblical
[3:50] understanding of these different
[3:52] subjects
[3:54] here's the outline for the video first
[3:56] we'll look at two types of fillings
[3:59] then four types of faith
[4:02] then we'll look at four types of love
[4:06] then we'll look at two types of
[4:08] temperance
[4:10] then we'll look at Four kinds of fruits
[4:13] and last we will look at two types of
[4:15] godliness
[4:17] let's begin with two types of fillings
[4:21] friends this topic is actually part of
[4:24] one of the mysteries of God
[4:26] is spoken of in Colossians chapter one
[4:28] it's the mystery of Christ in you the
[4:30] hope of glory
[4:32] so the two types of fillings are the
[4:35] filling of the Holy Ghost in the human
[4:37] Spirit or mind and the second kind is
[4:40] the filling or the baptism of the Holy
[4:42] Ghost in the soul and these are two
[4:44] different types of fillings
[4:47] this Revelation is important for
[4:50] understanding both the Old Testament and
[4:52] the New Testament and also specific
[4:54] quotes from God's Prophet brother
[4:55] Branham
[4:57] so beginning in the Old Testament the
[4:59] Bible says in numerous places that
[5:00] people were filled with the spirit of
[5:02] God and of course this can only mean in
[5:05] the human spirit
[5:06] Pharaoh recognized God's spirit in
[5:08] Joseph in Genesis 41 38. Pharaoh said a
[5:13] man in whom the spirit of God is
[5:16] Exodus 28 verse 3 says wise-hearted Jews
[5:19] were filled with the spirit of wisdom in
[5:21] order to make Aaron's Priestly garments
[5:25] Exodus 31 verses 2 through 5 says
[5:28] bezalia was filled with the spirit of
[5:30] God in all manner of workmanship
[5:32] and there are many more examples such as
[5:34] Caleb and Joshua
[5:37] and then even in the gospels the Bible
[5:40] says John the Baptist and his parents
[5:42] were filled with the Holy Spirit and of
[5:44] course this can only mean in the human
[5:46] Spirit or the mind
[5:49] the proof of this is found in John
[5:50] chapter 7 verses 37-39
[5:53] Jesus stood and cried and said If any
[5:55] man thirst let him come unto me and
[5:57] drink then in verse 39 he said this
[6:00] spake he of the spirit for the Holy
[6:02] Ghost was not yet given because that
[6:04] Jesus was not yet glorified
[6:07] so John 7
[6:09] 37-39 is a major scripture for
[6:12] understanding these two types of
[6:14] feelings anyone before the day of
[6:16] Pentecost except for Jesus had the
[6:18] feeling of the holy spirit in their mind
[6:20] or human Spirit only
[6:23] and then beginning on the day of
[6:24] Pentecost Sinners Say by grace that were
[6:27] Justified and Sanctified could be filled
[6:29] with the Holy Ghost in their souls
[6:32] and then every person baptized with the
[6:34] Holy Ghost thereafter could be baptized
[6:36] in the soul
[6:38] but of course we know few would find
[6:40] that narrow road
[6:41] but there have been born again Holy
[6:44] Ghost baptized Saints in their souls
[6:46] since the day of Pentecost and still to
[6:49] this day I believe I'm one of them by
[6:51] the grace of God and I trust you are as
[6:53] well
[6:54] with the correct understanding of this
[6:56] topic friends on the two different kinds
[6:58] of fillings it helps us better
[7:00] understand quotes from Brother Branham
[7:02] that say something like this a Believer
[7:05] can be filled with the Holy Spirit and
[7:07] yet still be lost and go to hell well
[7:10] how can this make sense
[7:12] the only way it can make sense is if the
[7:14] person Brothers talking about was filled
[7:16] with the Holy Spirit in their minds or
[7:18] their human spirits and not their souls
[7:20] and then at some point they would have
[7:22] sold out the gospel like a Judas
[7:23] Iscariot they would have transgressed
[7:25] against God they would have trodden
[7:27] underfoot the Son of God afresh and done
[7:29] despite under the spirit of Grace as the
[7:31] book of Hebrews says and then Men cast
[7:33] away like Judas Iscariot
[7:37] the choice of your conduct you could you
[7:41] can't mix it now you're either far God
[7:43] or against God and the outward
[7:46] expression shows exactly what's on the
[7:48] inside
[7:52] a bird many of you think I got the
[7:54] badges the Holy Ghost I'm going to
[7:55] heaven that don't mean one thing that
[7:57] you're going to have
[7:58] it no sir you have the baptism the Holy
[8:00] Ghost every hour in your life and still
[8:02] be lost and go to hell
[8:04] the Bible says so it's exactly right
[8:06] look here you are a outside person you
[8:10] have five senses it contacts that
[8:12] outside body God gave you five senses
[8:14] not to contact him your Earthly home see
[8:16] taste feel smell in here then you have a
[8:18] spirit on the inside of that and
[8:21] conscience love and so forth five
[8:23] Outlets that you contact the spirit
[8:25] world with that
[8:27] with your spirit
[8:29] to go contacts the physical you
[8:34] decided that you've got you've got a
[8:35] soul
[8:37] that soul is that Jane
[8:40] that come from God
[8:44] there's one specific quote in particular
[8:46] that's very helpful on the subject
[8:48] brother random calls the baptism of the
[8:50] Holy Ghost in the human Spirit or mind a
[8:52] temporal gift
[8:53] so let's listen to the quote
[9:07] we're in the church
[9:08] with the wheat
[9:10] rest up Rejoice for the rest
[9:12] all the spiritual blessings is Right
[9:14] upon you you say well I prophesy King
[9:17] offices
[9:19] so did Balaam yes that has nothing I got
[9:21] the baptism the holy spirit that still
[9:23] has nothing to do with it
[9:25] only a temporal tip for you the real
[9:28] gift is your soul either
[9:32] born of God and that controls the whole
[9:34] thing to the word of God and the will of
[9:36] God and there you go and see then you
[9:39] are son and daughter of God you are a
[9:41] child of God
[9:44] four kinds of faith
[9:48] Friends by God's grace there are these
[9:50] four kinds of Faith the first kind is
[9:52] intellectual Faith this is the common
[9:54] human Faith every human possesses and
[9:58] even the common faith that angels have
[10:03] now the common human faith is Hebrews 10
[10:05] verses 26 and 27 it says for if we sin
[10:09] willfully after that we have received
[10:11] the knowledge of the truth that
[10:12] remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but
[10:15] a certain fearful looking for of
[10:17] judgment and fiery indignation which
[10:19] shall Devour the adversaries
[10:21] so intellectual faith is Simply Having
[10:23] the knowledge of Truth you know the
[10:26] truth
[10:27] and then the Bible says also in Romans
[10:29] chapter 1 and Romans Chapter 2 that all
[10:33] men are without excuse on the day of
[10:34] judgment so everyone has an intellectual
[10:37] faith that there is a God because the
[10:39] Bible says only a fool says there's no
[10:41] God
[10:42] and then Romans chapter 1 says there are
[10:45] two undeniable proofs that leave every
[10:48] human without excuse
[10:49] first is God reveals himself inside each
[10:52] person's being
[10:54] or they know there's a God by their own
[10:55] body and mind and second all of creation
[10:59] or all of nature declares the glory of
[11:01] God and so all men are without excuse
[11:05] also James chapter 2 verse 19 says Thou
[11:08] believest that there is one God thou
[11:09] doest well the Devils also believe and
[11:12] tremble so fallen angels have this
[11:15] intellectual Faith or knowledge of the
[11:17] truth that Jesus Christ is God and they
[11:19] tremble at that but of course they're
[11:21] not saved they can never be saved
[11:25] second there's a saving Faith also known
[11:28] as justification by faith this is an
[11:31] anointing of God's divine nature that
[11:33] Peter speaks about in second Peter 1
[11:35] verse 4 but saving faith is found in
[11:38] Ephesians 2 verses 8 and 9. for by grace
[11:41] are you saved through faith and that not
[11:43] of yourself it is the gift of God not of
[11:45] Works lest any man should boast
[11:49] the Third Kind of faith is the gift of
[11:51] faith the gift of faith is one of the
[11:53] nine gifts of the holy ghost from First
[11:55] Corinthians chapter 12 and it's
[11:58] different from saving Faith because the
[12:00] gift of faith is always present in a
[12:02] person's human Spirit from birth
[12:04] every person has a gift of the Holy
[12:07] Spirit and God will use it in their
[12:09] lives if they'll just yield themselves
[12:11] to that for example even Judas Iscariot
[12:14] had gifts of the holy spirit in his
[12:16] human Spirit he was sent out with a
[12:19] twelve to cast out Devils heal the sick
[12:21] raise the dead and the Bible makes it
[12:23] plain that Judas Iscariot operated those
[12:25] gifts but possessing gifts of the holy
[12:28] spirit does not make one saved
[12:30] possessing saving Faith makes someone
[12:33] saved and that is what Judas
[12:35] transgressed against that is what Judas
[12:37] forsook he rejected saving Faith he
[12:41] betrayed Christ for money
[12:43] the gift of faith is First Corinthians
[12:45] 12 verse 9 to another Faith by The Same
[12:49] Spirit
[12:50] so the gift of faith is always present
[12:52] in a person's human Spirit from birth on
[12:54] but saving Faith only comes upon a
[12:56] Believer after genuine repentance from
[12:59] sins
[13:00] the fourth type of faith is the fruit of
[13:02] Faith this is found in Galatians 5 verse
[13:06] 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love
[13:08] joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[13:11] goodness faith
[13:13] again faith is one of the nine fruits of
[13:16] the spirit as well
[13:17] fruit of faith is the rarest form of
[13:20] Faith because it's only manifested in
[13:22] mature seasoned Christians whose souls
[13:25] are baptized with the Holy Ghost
[13:28] remember anyone sinner or Saint can
[13:31] manifest a gift of faith
[13:33] saving faith is more rare than the gift
[13:36] of faith being only present in the few
[13:38] Believers Jesus said would find the
[13:40] narrow path that leads to eternal life
[13:43] then of course the fruit of faith is
[13:45] even more rare because there's few
[13:47] people say but then out of the save
[13:49] there are even fewer who go all the way
[13:51] with God
[13:52] are guided into all truth and are
[13:54] baptized in their souls with the Holy
[13:56] Ghost
[13:58] four types of love
[14:00] the first type of Love is common human
[14:03] love Jesus spoke about this in Matthew 5
[14:07] 44 45 46 47 and 48 I'm just going to
[14:12] read verse 46 for if ye love them which
[14:16] love you what reward have ye do not even
[14:19] the publicans the same
[14:21] so Jesus says publicans are sinners can
[14:24] express this human love
[14:26] so everyone has this human love or care
[14:28] that they express to others
[14:31] but this is not the Divine love of God
[14:33] as we'll see soon
[14:35] this human love is sometimes mistaken
[14:38] for Christian love but it is not real
[14:40] Christian love brother Branham mentions
[14:42] this in the sermon presuming 1962
[14:45] speaking of the Christian Science people
[14:47] he said they deny the Virgin birth they
[14:50] deny the blood of Jesus Christ and just
[14:52] talk about love so of course this group
[14:55] does not have the real love of God it is
[14:57] just a false human love let's listen to
[15:00] the quote
[15:01] foreign
[15:24] [Applause]
[15:26] second there's a type of love that the
[15:29] foolish virgin has
[15:31] which is probably brotherly kindness as
[15:33] stated in second Peter 1 verse 7. this
[15:37] is Christian love that allows a
[15:38] Christian who's not yet born again
[15:40] to keep the commands of Jesus because
[15:43] Jesus said in John 14 21 he that hath my
[15:46] commands and keepeth them he it is that
[15:48] loveth me and he that loveth me shall be
[15:50] loved to my father and I will love him
[15:52] and will manifest myself to him
[15:55] so foolish virgins are still virgin to
[15:57] the word of God that they hold but
[15:59] remember they will not go all the way
[16:01] with the word of God
[16:02] so they have a love for God that keeps
[16:04] them undefiled from idolatry or
[16:07] spiritual fornication that makes them
[16:09] virgin to Christ but they're still
[16:11] foolish
[16:13] This Is The Love Someone Like Old
[16:15] Testament believer lot would have had
[16:16] the Bible calls him just lie in second
[16:19] Peter 2 verse 7 second Peter 2 verse 8
[16:22] calls him a righteous man and second
[16:25] Peter 2 verse 9 calls him The Godly
[16:28] because God knows how to deliver The
[16:30] Godly out of Temptations
[16:32] so lot Abraham's nephew would have had
[16:35] some type of love for God a lesser love
[16:38] for God because he was still just
[16:39] righteous and godly but he wasn't nearly
[16:42] as devoted and full of love as Abraham
[16:45] was
[16:46] and the final proof of this is found in
[16:48] Matthew 25 verses 34 to 40. here we see
[16:52] Jesus giving the foolish virgins eternal
[16:55] life at the white Throne judgment
[16:57] and they asked Jesus when did we see you
[17:00] and hungered and fed you and thirsty and
[17:03] gave you drink or saw you as a stranger
[17:05] took you in or naked and clothed you or
[17:08] saw you in prison and came unto you and
[17:11] Jesus said in Matthew 25 verse 40 verily
[17:14] I say unto you inasmuch as ye have done
[17:16] it until one of the least of these my
[17:18] brethren you have done it unto me
[17:20] so These Foolish versions showed their
[17:23] love for other Christians Jesus's
[17:25] Brethren of course these were holy
[17:27] ghost-filled brethren in their souls
[17:29] the foolish version showed them Love by
[17:31] giving them water giving them clothes
[17:33] housing them visiting them in prison and
[17:36] other acts of Brotherly kindness
[17:39] the third type of Love is divine love or
[17:42] charity
[17:43] this is also known as the baptism of the
[17:45] Holy Ghost this is the love of the wise
[17:48] virgins
[17:50] this is spoken of in second Peter
[17:51] chapter 1 verses five through seven on
[17:54] the Statue of a pervert man the eighth
[17:56] and final step is Charity verse 7 says
[18:00] and to Godliness brotherly kindness
[18:01] antibody kindness charity
[18:05] this is the permanent love of God that
[18:07] God places in a believer's soul when
[18:09] they are sealed by the baptism of the
[18:11] Holy Ghost unto the day of redemption
[18:14] Romans 5 verse 5 says this and hope
[18:17] maketh not a shame because the love of
[18:19] God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
[18:21] Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[18:24] and of course First Corinthians 13
[18:27] verses 1 through 8 speak of this love of
[18:30] God and this is the love that flows out
[18:32] of a true believer's Soul when he or she
[18:34] is baptized with the Holy Ghost in their
[18:36] souls
[18:37] this kind of love suffers long is kind
[18:40] envious not wanteth not itself is not
[18:44] puffed up this is the charity that never
[18:46] fails
[18:49] The Fourth Kind of Love is the fruit of
[18:51] love this is the most rare mature form
[18:54] of love this is one of the nine fruits
[18:57] of the Holy Ghost according to Galatians
[18:59] 5 verses 22 through 24.
[19:03] verse 22 specifically States this love
[19:06] but the fruit of the spirit is love
[19:09] we see this love in the Bible in the
[19:11] case of Saint Paul the Bible said he was
[19:13] always praying for churches like the
[19:15] Saints in Philippi
[19:17] and also we see his love for the
[19:19] Corinthian Church how he would write
[19:22] them harsh letters in order to get them
[19:23] to repent he had a Godly jealousy that
[19:26] they would remain Chase virgins unto
[19:28] Christ
[19:29] and we also see the fruit of love in
[19:31] Paul's life in second Corinthians
[19:33] chapter 11 where he gives his resume as
[19:35] being a true Apostle of Jesus Christ
[19:39] three times beaten with rods stoned once
[19:43] three times Shipwrecked he served Christ
[19:46] in hungered and thirst and fastings
[19:48] often and also had the daily care of all
[19:51] the churches this was the true love of
[19:53] Jesus Christ the rarest and most purest
[19:56] form of love the fruit of love
[20:00] two types of temperance
[20:03] friends there are two types of
[20:04] temperance or self-control the first is
[20:07] the anointing on the Statue of a perfect
[20:09] man a Believer receives before they're
[20:12] born again it is the fourth step or the
[20:14] fourth anointing on the Statue of a
[20:16] perfect man according to Second Peter
[20:18] chapter 1 verses five six and seven but
[20:21] specifically verse 6 and to knowledge
[20:24] temperance
[20:25] so this is the anointing of temperance
[20:28] that foolish virgins have they have a
[20:30] level of self-control because they're
[20:32] still virgin to Christ
[20:34] in other words they haven't committed
[20:36] spiritual fornication against Christ
[20:38] through idolatry they haven't built up
[20:40] Idols in their lives
[20:41] so in other words this anointing of
[20:43] temperance is part of sanctification the
[20:45] second work of Grace
[20:47] you remember friends Saints in the Old
[20:49] Testament could have justification and
[20:52] sanctification they could have these
[20:54] anointings of the Statue of a perfect
[20:55] man we see it in Joseph's life
[20:58] Joseph had amazing Temperance to deny
[21:01] Pharaoh's wife and her daily Temptations
[21:05] in Genesis 39 verse 9 Joseph said how
[21:07] then can I do this great wickedness and
[21:09] sin against God in verse 10 says and it
[21:12] came to pass as she spoke to Joseph day
[21:14] by day that he hearkened not unto her to
[21:17] lie by her or to be with her
[21:19] Joseph had such a strong anointing of
[21:21] self-control or Temperance that he
[21:23] turned down daily Temptations from
[21:25] Potiphar's wife
[21:27] and again we see Jesus parable of the
[21:30] ten virgins five were wise five were
[21:33] foolish so the five foolish would have
[21:35] had self-control they would have had an
[21:37] anointing of temperance because they
[21:39] were virgins to Christ and that's in
[21:41] Matthew 25 verses 1 to 13.
[21:45] the second type of temperance is
[21:47] self-control that only a mature holy
[21:50] ghost-filled believer can manifest and
[21:52] of course this is much more rare than
[21:54] the first kind of temperance this type
[21:56] of temperance is manifested by those who
[21:58] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[22:00] their souls and also this Temperance is
[22:03] a fruit of the Holy Spirit according to
[22:05] Galatians 5 verse 23 meekness Temperance
[22:09] against such there is no law
[22:12] so this is even greater self-control
[22:15] than a Sanctified person has and we see
[22:18] it in Paul's life like in First
[22:19] Corinthians 9 27 he said but I keep
[22:22] under my body and bring it into
[22:24] subjection lest that by any means when I
[22:26] have preached to others I myself should
[22:28] be a Castaway
[22:29] so Paul had such power of temperance he
[22:33] kept his body under subjection because
[22:35] he didn't want to feel like he would be
[22:37] Cast Away he had a greater anointing of
[22:40] self-control we also see it in second
[22:42] Corinthians 11 verse 27 in weariness and
[22:45] painfulness in watchings often in hunger
[22:48] and thirst in fast things often in cold
[22:51] and nakedness
[22:53] Paul had such a powerful anointing of
[22:55] temperance he could fast often he could
[22:58] exist even in the cold weather he could
[23:01] persevere despite weariness he could
[23:04] persevere in the faith despite being
[23:05] hungry and thirsty that takes a great
[23:08] anointing of temperance
[23:10] and this is the mature Temperance that
[23:12] Holy ghost-filled Believers have because
[23:14] they're manifesting the fruits of the
[23:15] Holy Spirit
[23:18] four types of fruit
[23:22] friends there's at least four kinds of
[23:24] fruits the first kind is corrupt fruit
[23:26] which Jesus speaks about in Matthew 7
[23:29] specifically verses 17 and 18.
[23:33] but a corrupt tree bringing forth evil
[23:35] fruit
[23:36] so of course these are sinners or
[23:38] make-believers like Judas Iscariot who
[23:40] bring forth corrupt fruit
[23:42] the second kind of fruit is the fruit of
[23:44] repentance which is the first stage of
[23:46] justification because remember there's
[23:48] three stages or steps to be born again
[23:51] justification sanctification baptism of
[23:54] the Holy Ghost
[23:55] John the Baptist spoke of this in Luke 3
[23:57] verse 8 but bring forth therefore fruits
[24:01] worthy of repentance so when a person
[24:04] genuinely repents there are fruits that
[24:06] come out of their lives
[24:07] so we can clearly see the Bible says
[24:09] there are fruits to repentance or fruits
[24:12] to justification this implies there must
[24:14] be fruits of sanctification because we
[24:17] also know there's fruits to the baptism
[24:19] of the Holy Ghost which are the nine
[24:20] fruits of the spirit
[24:22] so David gives us scriptures about
[24:25] fruits of sanctification because again
[24:27] David can never be baptized with the
[24:28] Holy Ghost in the soul
[24:30] the greatest level of anointing he could
[24:32] have would be in the human Spirit The
[24:34] Filling of God in his mind which no
[24:36] doubt he had at times
[24:38] Psalms one two and three speaks of this
[24:40] but we'll read verse 3 he shall be like
[24:43] a tree planted by the rivers of water
[24:45] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[24:47] season
[24:48] so even in the Old Testament they could
[24:50] bring forth fruits of repentance
[24:51] justification and then fruits of
[24:54] sanctification as well
[24:56] fourth and finally is the most rare kind
[24:58] of fruit that's the mature fruit of the
[25:01] Holy Ghost baptism in the soul of the
[25:03] believer found in Galatians chapter 5.
[25:07] verse 22 but the fruit of the spirit is
[25:10] love joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[25:12] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[25:14] against such there is no law
[25:17] so amongst the Christians we have wise
[25:19] and foolish virgins the foolish virgins
[25:22] can only manifest fruits of
[25:23] justification sanctification but a holy
[25:26] ghost-filled Christian can manifest even
[25:28] more mature fruits and of course those
[25:31] are the nine fruits of the spirit
[25:33] and again Paul's life is a great example
[25:35] of this
[25:36] and Paul of course speaks of all these
[25:38] fruits and how they flow out of love in
[25:41] First Corinthians chapter 13.
[25:43] charity is patient charity is kind
[25:45] charity thinketh no evil charity can
[25:48] hope all things endure all things
[25:50] so we can see the connection between
[25:52] charity the love of God
[25:54] and how once that love gets in a
[25:56] believer's soul it will bear the nine
[25:58] fruits of the spirit
[26:01] two types of godliness
[26:05] friends again
[26:07] just like the two kinds of fillings
[26:08] godliness is one of the mysteries of God
[26:11] the Bible says in first Timothy 3 16
[26:14] that there is a mystery of godliness God
[26:17] was manifest in the flesh
[26:19] and of course brother random tells us
[26:20] this is godliness restored to man
[26:23] through Jesus's life Jesus's example and
[26:25] then Jesus sending his holy spirit into
[26:28] believer's Souls
[26:30] so there are two types of godliness one
[26:33] is the initial level of devotion you
[26:36] receive as you approach your spiritual
[26:38] birth or before you're born again so in
[26:41] other words there is an anointing of
[26:43] godliness you receive as part of
[26:44] sanctification and it is the sixth step
[26:47] on the stature of a perfect man in
[26:49] second Peter chapter one
[26:51] this measure or portion of godliness or
[26:54] this anointing of godliness is the sixth
[26:56] character trait God adds to your being
[26:57] after he saved your soul
[27:00] but the second type of godliness is a
[27:02] mature rare spiritual state of devotion
[27:05] a Believer manifests after he's born
[27:08] again
[27:09] it's a pattern of holy living after your
[27:12] soul is baptized with the Holy Ghost
[27:13] this is found in numerous places but
[27:17] most notably in first Timothy 2 verse 2
[27:19] the Bible said praying for kings and for
[27:22] all that are in Authority that we may
[27:23] lead a quiet and peaceful life in all
[27:26] godliness and honesty
[27:29] so mature godliness is godliness in
[27:31] every area of your life this is a much
[27:33] more mature godliness than just the
[27:35] sanctification godliness because this
[27:38] godliness impacts every area of a
[27:40] person's life
[27:41] so again we should see this in the
[27:43] difference between the foolish virgins
[27:44] and the wise virgins
[27:47] and Paul has at least five texts about
[27:49] mature godliness for Holy ghost-filled
[27:51] Believers you'll find it in Titus 1
[27:54] verses 1 and 2 first Timothy 2 1-3 like
[27:57] I just read first Timothy 4 7-8 First
[28:00] Timothy 6 3-12 and second Timothy 3 1-17
[28:07] in closing
[28:10] friends I hope this video has been a
[28:11] blessing the thought about these
[28:13] different kinds of fillings love Faith
[28:17] fruits Temperance and more came to me
[28:20] while I was writing my 2021 book about
[28:22] the 12 New Testament Mysteries that God
[28:24] revealed to brother Branham
[28:25] and then recently I was reminded about
[28:27] some of these subjects so I thought I
[28:29] would make a video on it quickly and
[28:31] share it with the Saints by the grace of
[28:32] God
[28:33] we're so thankful the Lord has given us
[28:35] these Revelations because they help us
[28:37] so much understand our lives and of
[28:39] course the lives of others and friends
[28:41] we want to strive to be the wise virgin
[28:43] we want to strive to have our souls
[28:44] baptized or fill with the Holy Ghost so
[28:47] we can manifest both the gift of faith
[28:49] and the fruit of faith mature Holy Ghost
[28:53] Temperance or self-control
[28:55] all nine fruits of the Holy Ghost
[28:57] according to Galatians chapter 5 and
[28:59] mature godliness that flows out from the
[29:01] soul of a holy ghost-filled believer
[29:04] if you have any questions concerns or
[29:06] testimonies please contact me
[29:09] thank you
[29:10] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[29:13] the desire of your heart
