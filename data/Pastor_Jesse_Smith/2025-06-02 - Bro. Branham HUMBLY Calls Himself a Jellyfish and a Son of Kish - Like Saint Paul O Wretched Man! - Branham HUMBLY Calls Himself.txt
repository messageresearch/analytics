TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Sometimes I look at myself and think I've been such a jellyfish in my life. I have waited and missed many thousands of souls into the kingdom. But by God's grace, I ain't to keep my eye on the promise. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to show two quotes from God's prophet, brother William Mariam Brham, where he humbles himself and shares with everyone how he's a human. He's a sinner saved by grace. He was prone to make mistakes and yet he was a genuine prophet of God. I came across these two quotes recently and I thought I'd share them as an encouragement that despite our mistakes as Holy Ghost fil Christians. We should repent of our mistakes, learn from our mistakes, and then press on toward the mark of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. We'll start with a Bible foundation. I think Romans 7 is a great place to start. Here we have the prophet, the first church age messenger, St. Paul, and he's speaking about the war between his flesh and his mind. I love verse 17 in Romans 7. Now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth within me. So Paul was able to separate the real person that he was which is the soul and the human spirit on the inside. The soul and spirit was the real Paul. The sin nature and his flesh was not the real Paul. He was able to separate the two. But of course he still had to repent of all the sins that his flesh committed. That's why Jesus said daily take up your cross and follow me. That's why Paul also said I die daily. in 1 Corinthians chapter 15. Then Paul said in verse 18, I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. So if that was true for St. Paul, that's true for brother Brandham. That's true for all of us by the grace of God. And then in verse 20, he said, "Now if I do that, I would not." In other words, if I sin, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. And then in verse 23, he calls this a war against the law of his mind. In his mind, he wanted to always obey the word of God, but he would lose the battle. Brother Bram calls this the battlefield of the mind. So the law of the mind would war against the law of his members, the sin nature in his flesh. And when he would sin, he said, "I was brought into captivity," again in verse 23, Romans 7:23, bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. There's times we feel trapped in our flesh. We feel enslaved to the sin in our flesh. I love verse 24, though. Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? So here Paul, a Holy Ghostfilled Christian who's seen Jesus, says he's a wretched man. And what a parallel to brother Brandham who had seen Jesus twice by vision. And as we'll see here, Brother Brham calls himself a son of Kish. Brother Brandham puts himself on the level of Saul, not David. In this quote from the rejected king, May 15th, 1960. But before that, Romans 7:25 says, "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord." So then with the mind, I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin. So here we see every Holy Ghost-filled Christian has a war between the law of the mind and the law of the members, the sin nature. And we overcome through Jesus Christ our Lord, through repentance. And then when we truly repent, the anointing comes back upon our minds. We can bring our sinful bodies into subjection to the Holy Ghost. We yield our members to the Holy Ghost as Romans 7 also says. So now let's look at this quote from a rejected king 1960. This is a striking quote to me for a couple reasons. First, because this is the ninth time and the final time in this sermon that brother Ram speaks of a son of Kish. So nine times he talks about a son of Kish or King Saul who in many ways failed God. Many times God had to take the kingdom from him because of his disobedience and his rebellion against the Holy Ghost. But here this ninth time he mentions it. He compares it to himself. He says brother Ram says he can't forgive the people. He can't give them pardoning grace because he's not the Lord. He said your spirit will do that work Lord. There's no way for me to do it. I'm just a man. He said, "Another son of Kish." And I remember listening to this recently and I'm like, "Oh my goodness." I had to go back and listen. Did Brother Random just call himself a son of Kish? He did. And then he said, "But we need you, the Holy Spirit. God, let me be as Samuel, one who tells the truth of the word." So I don't believe Brother Random mixed his words here. I believe that Brother Ram recognized in his flesh, he was no better than anybody else. Just as the Bible said, we've all fallen short of the glory of God. according to Romans chapter 3. But previously in this sermon, brother Ram had talked about how Saul was a son of Kish. And then he compared it to even Billy Graham being a son of Kish, failing to take on the challenge from the Muslim people about miracles. And I trust you'll go back and search out those quotes. You can do that in your time. It'd be a great study for you. He also compared sons of Kish to seminary preachers that don't believe in the supernatural, the power of God. But here at the end, Brother Ram says,"I am just a son of Kish as well." Let's listen to the quote. And we pray today, Father, that these who are now asking for pardoning grace, that your spirit will do that work, Lord, there's no way for me to do it. I'm just a man, another son of Kish. But we need you, the Holy Spirit. God, let me be a Samuel, one who tells the truth of the word and you have vindicated it so far and I believe that you will continue as long as I stay true to you. Before getting to the next quote, I think it'd be important to see how brother Brandham here was humbling himself and then God did exalt him. Of course, brother Brandham said this in 1960. And then 7 months later, Brother Brandham would preach the revelation of the seven church ages. It's a mystery that was revealed according to Revelation 1 20. The mystery of the seven golden candlesticks and the seven stars. So despite a prophet's human fail failures, despite being a wretched man, like Paul said, Brother Ram was the same, a wretched man, a sinner saved by grace, God would use him to reveal the mystery of the seven church ages. And then of course in 1963, God used brother Ram to reveal the seven seals. The mystery of the seven seals. And then of course there's 10 other mysteries. I believe that's what I wrote my 2021 book about that Godhead. Brother Brandham reveal six of them with thus sayith the Lord. Important ones such as the Godhead. God is one person not three. With thus sayith the Lord and then the revelation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost with thus sayith the Lord. Brother Ram told us in the church age book. But in Matthew 23:10-12, Jesus said, "Neither be ye called masters, for one is your master, even Christ." I see brother Brandham in this verse. Brother Ram never exalted himself as a master above anybody. But then he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. Brother Ram always served the people by traveling to minister to people by spending extra time in prayer lines, even recognizing children in the Brham tabernacle, giving them gifts at Christmas time, recognizing them, shaking their hands. Brother tried to make himself the servant of all. And then in verse 12, Jesus said, "Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased. And he that shall humble himself shall be exalted." So here is a good example of brother Random fulfilling this scripture. Brother Ram humbles himself and says, "I'm a son of Kish." Brother Ram did not exalted himself and say, "I'm the greatest preacher of all time." Like some message preachers have a bad habit of doing today. Or I'm amongst the greatest preachers of all time. Brother Brandham never said that. Brother Ram was humbling himself saying, "I'm a son of Kish." In other words, I'm a man that can make mistakes as well. So, let's go to the second quote. This is from four years earlier in November 25th, 1956, a secondhanded robe. And the context is Brother Ram preaching on Elijah. Brother Bram said, "Elijah gave Elisha a condition to receive his mantle." He said, "If you see me when I go, it'll come on you. There is a promise. If thou canst believe, all things are possible to them that believe. And then look what brother Ram says. Sometimes I look at myself and think I've been such a jellyfish in my life. So I just thought it was interesting and also how brother Ram is humbling himself and then how God would exalt him. God would exalt him throughout the rest of his ministry. And the reason he called himself a jellyfish, he said because he's waited and missed many thousands of souls into the kingdom because he waited and said, "God, depending too much on a spiritual gift and said, Lord, if you'll just show me and if you'll give me a vision, what to do?" And God, give me the vision, then I'll turn around, let somebody talk me into something else. And oh, I have never come to that spot yet until like I have at this time that I feel it's a faith that we must step out there because it's a promise and the things that he has done and the healings that he has performed and the miracles even so much as come down and have his picture taken by the side of us and so forth which has never been known since the world began and then stand around like a jellyfish again. So twice he calls himself a jellyfish. It even makes me discouraged with myself. It's time to keep your eye on the promise. And that's what by God's grace I aim to do. And I realize that every devil of hell will shoot at me. But by God's grace, I aim to keep my eye on the promise." End quote. So again, another example of brother Brandham humbling himself. He wasn't exalting himself. He was humbling himself. Now I've speculated. I just thought maybe he's talking about the 1951 trip to South Africa where he took the denominational itinerary rather than the itinerary of the angel of the Lord. Maybe he's talking about that experience as losing many thousands of souls. I don't know. I'm just guessing. But yeah, brother Brandham said it anyway. So again, friends, let's enjoy this quote as brother Bram humbles himself as a true man of God. If we humble ourselves, we'll be exalted. Let's listen to the quote. Elijah, give him a condition. If you see me when I go, it'll come on you. There's the promise. If thou canst believe, all things are possible to them that believe. Sometimes I look at myself and think, I've been such a jellyfish in my life. I have waited and missed many thousands of souls into the kingdom because I've waited and said God depended too much on a spiritual gift and said Lord if you'll just show me if you'll give me a vision what to do and God gives a vision then I'll turn around and let somebody talk me into something else and oh I have never come to the spot yet until I like I have at this time that I feel it's a faith that we must step out there because it's a promise and the things that he has done and the healings that he has performed and the miracles in so much has come down and have his picture taken by the title and so forth which has never been known that the world began and then stand around like a jellyfish. It even makes me discouraged with myself. It's time to keep your eye on the promise. Amen. That's what by God's grace I aim to do. And I realize that every devil of hell will shoot at it. But by God's grace, I aim to keep my eye on the promise. I think I'll share one more quote here by God's grace. But this is a quote that constantly pops up in my mind uh from the seventh seal 1963. Brother Brandham said at the conclusion of preaching these revelations from the Lord Jesus Christ, he says, "We want to be gems in the crown of Jesus Christ. We don't want never put a man in it. You forget anything about me. I'm your brother, a sinner saved by grace, not fit to live." And that's the phrase that I often get my mind. Brother Ram says, "I'm not fit to live." That's exactly the truth. I ain't saying that to be humble. That's the facts. There's nothing in me, not one sound thing at all. but by the grace of God has let my poor dimming eyes look beyond the curtain of time and see those things back yonder. So here after getting all the revelations of the seven seals getting visited every day by the angel of the Lord the Holy Spirit brother Ram says it's I'm not fit to live. Don't put a human in it. Has nothing to do with a human. It's God fulfilling his word. And this reminds me now going getting back to the rejected king. That was the first sermon where brother Random shared his experience of going beyond the curtain of time. And how many people have had that experience? Very very few. Right? We know St. Paul had that experience. He told us about that in 2 Corinthians chapter 12 getting up to the third heaven which he couldn't even utter. He wasn't allowed to utter it. But here brother Brandham gets to go beyond the curtain of time. We'd say the sixth dimension perhaps. And even after telling how he was privileged to go beyond the curtain of time, brother Ram still comes back and says I am a son of Kish. In other words, I'm not worthy. This is God's doing. I'm just a brother, a sinner saved by grace. So let's listen to this quote from the seventh seal. May you always bear that in mind to be a gem in the crown of Jesus Christ. Paul said to the church, you are you are the jewels or gems of his crown. We want to be the gems of the crown of Jesus Christ. We don't want never put a man in it. You forget anything about me. I am your brother, a sinner saved by grace. Not fit to live. That's exactly the truth. I stand to be humble. That's facts. There's nothing in me, not one sound thing at all. But the grace of God has let my poor dimming eyes look beyond the curtain of power and see those things on earth. And I come back. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. It was just fresh and encouraging to me to come across these two quotes about being a son of Kish and then acting like a jellyfish, not having the backbone needed. And I think that's very helpful to see that sometimes even as Christians, God can tell us exactly what to do, but then we'll still disobey it. Like brother Ram said in the quote about the jellyfish from a secondhanded robe 1957. Notice that brother Ram asked for a vision. God gave him the vision, told him what to do, and then still he disobeyed. This again highlights the grace of God. Like Paul said in Romans 7, good and evil will be present with me, but then I'll choose the evil. He says, "Oh, wretched man that I am." So, I hope this encourages you today to confess any sins and have real godly sorrow, not worldly sorrow, but godly sorrow that leads to obedience and taking revenge upon the enemy according to the book of 2 Corinthians. And just remember, if God's grace extended to St. Paul, then it no doubt extended to brother Brandham, and then no doubt it'll extend to you as well. We're all saved by grace through faith. And God is rich in mercy. His mercies are new this morning. If you have any questions or concerns about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He never failed. [Music]
