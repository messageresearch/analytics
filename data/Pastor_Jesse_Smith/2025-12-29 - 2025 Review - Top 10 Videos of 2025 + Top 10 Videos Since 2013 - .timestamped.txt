[0:03] And we pray, Lord, that you'll receive
[0:05] our thanksgiving first to begin this uh
[0:09] dying year as we're issuing it out
[0:12] tonight in service, issuing it out,
[0:15] giving praise, studying thy word, and
[0:18] knowing what thus sayaeth the Lord
[0:20] means.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; How many things could we put out on a
[0:24] paper to be thankful for? the little
[0:27] narcapes that we've had this year where
[0:30] Satan would have smothered our life out,
[0:33] but you're not through with us yet. So,
[0:35] we're still continuing on. We believe,
[0:37] Lord, that we're only born and raised in
[0:40] this world to honor and glorify thee.
[0:44] Greetings, friends, in the matchless
[0:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. As we
[0:48] come to the end of 2025, [music] I
[0:50] thought it'd be fun to do a review on
[0:52] all the videos that were released this
[0:54] year by the grace [music] of God. So,
[0:56] we'll look at the top 10 videos of the
[0:58] year and then look at the top 10 videos
[1:02] for the entire 12 years I've been on
[1:04] YouTube with the point of edifying the
[1:06] body of Christ. And hopefully, if you
[1:08] feel led of the Holy Ghost, you can
[1:10] share some videos to edify others, also
[1:13] to witness to others by the grace of
[1:15] almighty God. As I put that video out
[1:17] earlier this year, the four reasons I
[1:19] started this YouTube channel. And one of
[1:21] them was to do outreach since I didn't
[1:23] want to travel overseas because of my
[1:26] large family. I felt I could make
[1:28] YouTube videos and then they could be
[1:29] shared with people overseas or here
[1:32] domestically in the US with the main
[1:34] purpose of getting the message out. As
[1:36] brother Ram said, everyone deserves a
[1:37] chance to hear the message. Thank God we
[1:39] get to hear it every week, multiple
[1:41] times a week, even daily by the grace of
[1:43] God. So by God's grace, here's a few
[1:46] facts about this year. I put out 71
[1:49] videos. This is the 72nd and October 3rd
[1:53] of this year marked the 12th year that
[1:56] I've been making YouTube videos and
[1:57] putting them out for people to
[1:59] strengthen their faith to defend brother
[2:01] Brandham and to have confidence in the
[2:03] holy word of God, the holy Bible, which
[2:05] is our absolute as God's prophet brother
[2:07] Brandham taught us. And as I reflected
[2:09] upon this year, I began this year by
[2:12] being called a know-it-all, a nad,
[2:15] someone trying to correct Brother
[2:17] Brandham, someone trying to change
[2:19] brother Ram's message. Of course, those
[2:21] are all false accusations.
[2:23] And then the middle of the year, I put
[2:25] out the video that had the most views,
[2:27] which was abandoned. How Brandham
[2:29] Tabernacle has been abandoned, just like
[2:31] the days of King Ahaz. and then ended
[2:34] the year with the 60th anniversary of
[2:36] when God took his prophet home, brother
[2:38] William Brandham. And again, we're so
[2:40] thankful for the ministry of God's
[2:42] prophet, Brother Brandham. We wouldn't
[2:43] be where we are today without the
[2:45] ministry of Malachi 45 and 6, the seven
[2:48] church age messenger, the prophet to
[2:50] finish the mystery of God, as the
[2:52] scripture tells us. So, let's start with
[2:55] the top 10 videos of 2025. Number 10 was
[2:58] reaction to Derek Prince's claims about
[3:02] Brother Ram's death. Ninth was, "Is
[3:04] Donald Trump a forerunner of the Pope
[3:06] Antichrist?"
[3:08] Eighth was reaction on Justin Peters
[3:11] calling William Brham a false prophet in
[3:13] charlatan.
[3:14] Seventh was on interracial marriage.
[3:16] Brother Brandham called it perfect and
[3:18] God's choice in relation to Moses and
[3:20] Zapora.
[3:22] Sixth was when will Los Angeles sink?
[3:25] William Brandham's prophecy about the
[3:26] sinking of Los Angeles. Now, two of
[3:29] these have been from years previous to
[3:31] 2025. So, the Derek Prince video was
[3:33] 2024.
[3:35] The sinking of Los Angeles video was
[3:36] from 2023. So, it's nice to see even a
[3:39] couple years later, they still get lots
[3:41] of views cuz people have those
[3:42] questions. Hopefully, that gives them
[3:44] Bible answers by the grace of God. The
[3:47] fifth top video of the year was no
[3:49] tapes, no token, another lie coming from
[3:51] Brandham Tabernacle.
[3:53] The fourth video of the year was new
[3:55] Pope Leo I 14th predicted 71 years ago
[3:59] by God's prophet brother William
[4:01] Brandham. And again, it's still
[4:03] staggering to know that brother Brandham
[4:05] predicted a pope from the United States
[4:07] in December of 1954 there would be a
[4:10] pope rise out of the United States and
[4:11] then if our records are right, 9 months
[4:15] later, Pope Leo I 14th was born. So,
[4:18] it's likely Brother Anom predicted this
[4:20] the month that the Pope was conceived in
[4:23] his mother's womb and then he was born 9
[4:26] months later. Amazing. The third video
[4:28] of the year was the serpent seed nine
[4:29] Bible proofs part one of three. And
[4:31] again, that's from 2017. So, it's
[4:34] awesome to see a video made 8 years ago
[4:37] as the third best video of the year. And
[4:39] I just love the serpent seed revelation.
[4:41] That's what first drew me to the message
[4:43] of the hour. Then, of course, God
[4:45] revealed the rest of the mysteries of
[4:46] God. But that topic is so important.
[4:48] Brother Ram said, "It doesn't save, but
[4:50] it shines more light on the truth we're
[4:51] all trying to see, which is the
[4:53] revelation of Jesus Christ." The second
[4:56] video of the year was responding to
[4:57] three criticisms on three of my videos
[5:00] regarding interracial marriage,
[5:02] ministers marriage requirements, and the
[5:04] order of the great tribulation period.
[5:07] And the top video of the year, as I
[5:08] mentioned earlier, was abandoned five
[5:10] parallels with Brennham Tabernacle and
[5:12] King Ahaz shutting the temple doors.
[5:17] And now, just for your reference, if
[5:19] you're new to my channel, let's go over
[5:21] the top 10 videos over the 12 years that
[5:24] we've been on YouTube here by God's
[5:26] grace. And if you haven't viewed them,
[5:27] I'd encourage you to view them. Share
[5:29] them with friends, family members,
[5:31] co-workers, however you feel led to
[5:33] share them with by the grace of God.
[5:34] That's why I made them so people could
[5:36] watch them in the privacy of their own
[5:38] home and the Holy Spirit could deal with
[5:40] them in order to receive the word of
[5:42] God. So number 10 in these 12 years is
[5:45] the serpent seed nine Bible proofs part
[5:48] three. It's neat to see all three
[5:51] serpent seed videos are in the top 10.
[5:53] Number nine is jewelry tattoos in the
[5:55] Bible. Number eight is the serpent seed
[5:57] nine Bible proofs part two. Seventh
[6:00] highest video is three prophecies of
[6:01] William Brham. Now by God's grace as
[6:04] years have gone by I'm up to seven now.
[6:06] Seven prophecies brother Brandham
[6:07] foretold in the name of the Lord that
[6:09] came to pass. But back then in 2014, I
[6:12] just found those three. So here we are
[6:14] 11 years later and I found four more
[6:17] prophecies with us, sayith the Lord,
[6:19] Amazing Grace. The sixth video is the
[6:22] serpent seed, nine Bible proofs, part
[6:24] one.
[6:26] The fifth video is modest clothing, four
[6:28] Bible guidelines, and that video helped
[6:30] me write my 2019 book about restoring
[6:33] Christian modesty. The fourth video is
[6:35] long dresses in the Bible, which shows
[6:37] how crossdressing is an abomination. It
[6:40] always has been to God and always will
[6:41] be. And that's even more obvious today
[6:44] with all the transgender confusion. But
[6:47] thank God for a prophet of God. Thank
[6:49] God that God has dissolved all of our
[6:51] doubts and we know the truth on the
[6:53] issue of crossdressing by the grace of
[6:55] God.
[6:57] The third video is thus sayith the Lord
[6:59] future prophecies of William Brandham. I
[7:01] believe there's 11 future prophecies on
[7:02] there if I'm not mistaken.
[7:05] Second highest video is long hair in the
[7:07] Bible part one of two.
[7:09] And the most watched video of the past
[7:12] 12 years is makeup and the Bible.
[7:15] So again friends, thank you for watching
[7:17] these videos. Thank you for sharing
[7:18] them. It means so much to me. So
[7:21] wonderful to know that the gospel is
[7:23] being spread through this format. This
[7:25] is the format that works best for me. My
[7:28] family's too big for me to travel. I
[7:29] don't have the money to travel. So this
[7:31] is a great way I can do evangelistic
[7:34] work. I can do teaching and preaching
[7:37] and spreading the message of the hour,
[7:39] the Bible-based message, and it doesn't
[7:41] happen without you sharing them. So,
[7:43] thank you and God richly bless you for
[7:44] that. In closing, friends, it's been
[7:47] another wonderful year again by the
[7:49] grace of God, preaching the word of God,
[7:50] sharing the word of God, and let me
[7:52] again say my gratitude to all the
[7:54] listeners who not only listen and watch
[7:56] the videos, but then they leave kind
[7:58] comments or sincere questions. I love
[8:00] those as well. And a big thank you to
[8:02] those who share the videos. It means so
[8:04] much. Seems like a lot of people share
[8:06] the videos through WhatsApp, which is
[8:08] wonderful. Other social media sites like
[8:10] Facebook. So again, thank you from the
[8:13] bottom of my heart for helping spread
[8:15] the end time Bible message, the
[8:18] revelation of Jesus Christ, the final
[8:20] message to the final church age. May God
[8:23] bless you as you go into 2026. Thank
[8:26] God. In Hebrews 13, it says, "God will
[8:28] never leave us nor forsake us. Jesus is
[8:30] still standing in the midst of the seven
[8:32] golden candlesticks. The same Lord Jesus
[8:35] Christ who is with St. Paul, Iranius,
[8:38] Martin, Columba, Luther, Wesley, and
[8:40] brother Random is with the bride of
[8:42] Jesus Christ today. Praise God for that.
[8:45] Thank you saints for another wonderful
[8:46] year. Let's press on toward the mark of
[8:49] the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[8:51] As we do every year, we wonder and pray,
[8:54] could this be the year of the coming of
[8:55] the Lord? We don't know. But we can do
[8:57] two things. we can watch and pray. So,
[9:00] we'll do that by the grace of God. If
[9:03] you have any questions, concerns, or
[9:04] testimonies about this video, please
[9:05] contact me. [music] God bless you and
[9:08] may Jesus Christ be the desire of your
[9:11] heart.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[9:15] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[9:17] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[9:20] good news that Jesus raised from the
[9:22] dead, living among man today, his
[9:24] church. The same Jesus that was
[9:27] yesterday will be today and forever.
[9:31] He is never failed.
