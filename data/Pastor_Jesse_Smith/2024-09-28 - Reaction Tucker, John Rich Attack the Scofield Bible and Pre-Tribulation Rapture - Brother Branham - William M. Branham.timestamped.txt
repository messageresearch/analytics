[0:02] and I took my Bible the little SC field
[0:05] Bible about like that and I put it on my
[0:08] arms and I took off I believe that the
[0:11] church goes through the tribulation
[0:12] period Church organization that's right
[0:15] but the bride does not would you choose
[0:18] the woman you had to purify before you
[0:20] married
[0:22] her greetings friends in the matchless
[0:24] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:26] purpose of this video is to make a
[0:28] reaction video to John Rich's recent
[0:31] stance against the Scofield bible and
[0:33] against the pre-tribulation Rapture
[0:35] Revelation that God revealed to his
[0:38] Prophet The Late William brandham who
[0:39] lived from 1909 to
[0:41] 1965 hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor
[0:43] bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan
[0:45] Ohio USA and I defend the original
[0:47] Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he
[0:49] revealed to St Paul then had to restore
[0:51] through Martin Luther John Wesley and
[0:53] the late Prophet William brandham I also
[0:55] defend brother bram's Godly Christian
[0:57] character in this video I'm defending
[0:59] God's Revelation that he gave to brother
[1:01] brandham regarding the Rapture and the
[1:03] fact that the Rapture is
[1:05] pre-tribulation so the origin of this
[1:07] video is last summer I saw a short video
[1:10] with Tucker Carlson and John rich and
[1:12] they were blasting the Scofield bible
[1:14] and that's a Bible that I've Loved it's
[1:16] the Bible brother random used most often
[1:19] he said there were other Bibles probably
[1:21] better that one of my first Bibles and I
[1:23] just learned to read it like that and I
[1:25] just keep the same Bible which uh if I
[1:28] had the Thompson Chain it would have
[1:29] been much better I could found my text
[1:31] much faster on a Thompson Chain but he
[1:34] just got used to using the scoffield
[1:35] Bible and therefore he kept using it he
[1:38] could find the scriptures where they
[1:39] were located on the pages and then after
[1:41] seeing this video I went back and
[1:43] studied the Rapture again and just
[1:44] preached three sermons recently on the
[1:46] coming of the lord The Rapture mystery
[1:48] so I found it's great to revisit
[1:49] subjects and it's interesting how the
[1:51] enemy will attack them at certain times
[1:53] I was surprised by this attack on the
[1:55] pre-tribulation Rapture and upon the
[1:57] Scofield bible so I thought I'd make a
[1:59] reaction video by the grace of God I
[2:01] think I'll start with some quotes from
[2:02] God's Prophet brother brandham on his
[2:04] scoffield Bible the first one is from
[2:06] 1950 the Angel and the commission
[2:08] brother Brandon was wondering about
[2:10] whether his Visions were from God or not
[2:13] the preachers were telling him it was
[2:15] not from God but he told his wife he
[2:17] said he's going to take some time to go
[2:18] into his cave find out whether it's from
[2:21] God or not and he said he would stay
[2:23] there until he died if God didn't answer
[2:25] him but of course we know thankfully God
[2:27] answered him his gift was from the Holy
[2:29] Ghost and it's interesting the only
[2:31] thing he took into that cave was his
[2:33] scoffield Bible he said that little old
[2:35] scoffield Bible then of course the angel
[2:36] of Lord visited him the angel was always
[2:39] scriptural and then I'll play a portion
[2:41] from the angel of God 1947 reiterating
[2:44] what the angel told him a gift of Divine
[2:46] Healing would be given to him for the
[2:48] peoples of the world let's listen to the
[2:50] quotes and this Angel still speaking
[2:53] behind me which is a big man and he said
[2:56] I will meet you in there and watch he's
[2:59] always scriptural he said did not our
[3:03] Lord say when thou prayest be not like
[3:05] the Hypocrites that like to make a show
[3:08] said enter into the secret closet and
[3:10] when you've done so close the door then
[3:12] pray your father what seeth in secret
[3:14] and he that seeth in secret shall reward
[3:16] thee openly now I said to my wife I said
[3:19] honey call them up tell them I don't
[3:21] know when I'll ever be back to work
[3:23] again for I am now going to find out
[3:25] what that is or die I said if I said I
[3:29] got about $23 left in the bank and I'll
[3:32] write you a check and I'm going to leave
[3:35] and I shall never return until I find
[3:38] out what that is that's followed me all
[3:39] my days one says this and one says that
[3:42] but I'm going to find out what it is and
[3:44] I took my Bible little old SC field
[3:47] Bible about like that and I put it under
[3:50] my arms and I took off I went I read
[3:52] until night time I got a cave I go into
[3:55] and be way back in the hill and I prayed
[3:58] and I prayed I was that free but when he
[4:01] came visible it was a man that was seing
[4:04] would weigh 200 lb yes it's true friends
[4:07] I couldn't see and he said to me I just
[4:10] sit there and he said fear not I'm
[4:14] sensing the presence of God to tell you
[4:17] that this peculiar life of yours
[4:20] peculiar
[4:21] birth a gift of Divine Healing to the
[4:24] peoples of the world instead if you'll
[4:26] be sincere and will get the people to
[4:29] believe you there will be no disease
[4:32] stand before your prayer not even to
[4:34] cancer and he said it'll come to pass
[4:36] that you'll tell the people their
[4:38] diseases from a vibration over your hand
[4:41] then if you will be reverent on then you
[4:44] will tell the people the sins of their
[4:46] lives and the things that they have
[4:49] done dear friends there a Bible before
[4:52] me this afternoon has come to
[4:55] pass I went forth here's a second quote
[4:59] where brother brand say said I'm not a
[5:00] scoffield I so brother bran must have
[5:02] known people that just believed every
[5:04] word scoffield said so brother BR was
[5:06] not a scoffield i neither am I a
[5:09] brandham I I don't worship all of
[5:11] brother bram's words like some people do
[5:13] but I know for sure God's Prophet
[5:15] brother Bram was a genuine prophet of
[5:17] God I preach his message for all 20
[5:20] years I've been preaching the Gospel of
[5:21] Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote
[5:24] and of course the natural meaning of
[5:25] that even Dr scofi in his footnotes I'm
[5:28] not a scofi I but but however in his
[5:30] footnotes there he gives that it meant
[5:32] when the syrians come over and invade it
[5:34] that's true here's a quote from 1957
[5:37] brother Ram says he has a scoffield
[5:39] Bible he says he doesn't agree with
[5:42] scoffield on many of his theories but he
[5:44] likes the way it's set up he's had it
[5:47] for a long time he knows how to find his
[5:50] subject let's listen to the quote I got
[5:53] a small Scofield and I'm used to the
[5:56] Scofield bible it's markings I don't
[5:58] read the Scofield F notes now because I
[6:00] don't agree with scoffield on many of
[6:02] his the
[6:04] uh his theories but I I do like way it's
[6:07] set up because it's I've had it for a
[6:09] long time and read it and so much kind
[6:11] of know how to find my subject all right
[6:14] so let's move on to this next part here
[6:15] well let's look at I want to look at
[6:17] three comments from this video between
[6:19] Tucker Carlson and John rich I guess in
[6:22] one way you could say it's viral it's
[6:23] got almost 4 million views the first
[6:25] comment is Tucker Carlson's comment on
[6:27] the scoffield Bible and the scoffield
[6:30] commentary we're on the 46 minute Mark
[6:32] Tucker Carlson claims that the
[6:35] commentary of scoffield has had massive
[6:37] effects on our politics resulting in the
[6:39] deaths of many people here's that video
[6:42] clip uh the Bible has had massive
[6:45] effects on our politics that have been
[6:48] very very negative and resulted in the
[6:50] deaths of a lot of people so I do know
[6:52] that for a fact but I don't know much
[6:54] about the theology so would you now my
[6:56] reaction to that is that could someone
[6:58] please tell me which Darby or scoffield
[7:01] comments have led to so many deaths
[7:03] through the American government one
[7:05] person thought perhaps that it was
[7:07] scoffield support for Israel that is
[7:09] carried over into the United States
[7:11] government support for funding Israel's
[7:14] war efforts over the years not sure I
[7:16] can verify that right now I would need
[7:18] videos of past presidents past senators
[7:20] past Representatives saying that they
[7:22] wanted to fund Israel's Wars because God
[7:25] was going in return to bless them and
[7:27] then revealed to them Jesus as their
[7:29] Messi mesiah because that's what
[7:31] Scofield taught Scofield taught just
[7:33] what the Bible teaches that God would
[7:35] eventually cut off the Gentiles and then
[7:37] graft back in the Jews and 144,000 will
[7:40] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:42] secondly let's look at John Rich's
[7:44] comment about the buz saww Trap that
[7:47] pre-tribulation Believers might walk
[7:49] into which I believe is ridiculous but
[7:51] let's look at that here so here we're on
[7:53] the 49 minute Mark John Rich claims the
[7:56] danger of the pre-tribulation Rapture is
[7:59] that they will say or pre-tribulation
[8:01] Believers will say it can't be the mark
[8:03] of the beast or Antichrist because I'm
[8:05] still here go ahead and sign me up let's
[8:08] watch the video clip people do so why is
[8:11] it dangerous right
[8:12] now that
[8:15] Christians have this idea that they're
[8:19] going to be out of here before any of
[8:20] the things that are prophesied about
[8:22] happen why is that dangerous it's
[8:24] dangerous because when the mark of the
[8:27] beast shows up when the on a predition
[8:30] shows up who is who refer to as the
[8:32] Antichrist when those things happen and
[8:35] they're still
[8:36] here they'll say well that can't be the
[8:39] mark of the beast that can't be the
[8:41] Antichrist because I'm still here what
[8:44] danger does that put someone in that's
[8:47] not the mark of the beast because I'm
[8:48] still here so go ahead sign me up think
[8:51] about the the level of danger with that
[8:53] and it has not existed in my opinion
[8:55] until recently since technology has
[8:58] gotten to the point to actually execute
[8:59] these things so my reaction on that is
[9:02] that you cannot deceive the elect
[9:04] according to Matthew
[9:06] 24:4 Jesus said it be so close it would
[9:09] deceive the very elect if it were
[9:11] possible so of course it's not possible
[9:13] deceive the very elect because their
[9:14] names were written on the Lamb's Book of
[9:15] Life before the foundation of the world
[9:17] the Bible tells us that plainly The Book
[9:19] of Revelation and the Bible said we were
[9:21] chosen in Christ before the foundation
[9:22] of the world in Ephesians 1: 4 and 5 so
[9:26] therefore a true Holy Ghost filled
[9:27] Christian will not be deceived by the
[9:29] mark of the beast a true Holy Ghost
[9:31] filled Christian will not accept the
[9:33] beast's Temptation that they cannot buy
[9:35] or sell without its Mark The Book of
[9:38] Revelation is clear that only those
[9:40] whose names were not written on the
[9:42] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[9:43] foundational world will take the mark
[9:45] That's according to Revelation 13:8 and
[9:47] all those that dwell upon the Earth
[9:48] shall worship Him whose names are not
[9:50] written in the Book of Life of the lamb
[9:52] slain from the foundation of the world
[9:54] so it seems humbly I'm just saying John
[9:57] Rich does not understand predestination
[9:59] you cannot deceive the very elect and
[10:02] third and finally John Rich uses his
[10:04] proof text that there is no
[10:06] pre-tribulation Rapture uh from 2
[10:09] Thessalonians chapter 2 and Matthew 24
[10:12] for time sake I'm not going to show the
[10:14] video of this but I just want to make
[10:15] some comments here let's look at those
[10:17] two texts in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2
[10:20] yes Paul does talk about the Antichrist
[10:22] but he never says that the Christians
[10:24] will see the Antichrist or be tempted by
[10:27] the Antichrist so John Rich's of course
[10:29] misunderstanding 2 Thessalonians chapter
[10:31] 2 Paul told us when the Antichrist would
[10:34] be revealed in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 he
[10:37] said there must come a falling away
[10:39] first we see that happening of course in
[10:40] the last 100 years or so people falling
[10:43] away from the faith the true Faith the
[10:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost Holiness God
[10:48] as one person the faith of the apostolic
[10:51] fathers 2 Thessalonians 27 says only he
[10:54] who now lth will let until he be taken
[10:57] out of the way so God is letting the
[11:00] mystery of iniquity already work through
[11:02] many false Antichrist and he will let it
[11:05] continue until the Holy Ghost is taken
[11:07] out of the way this connects to Romans
[11:09] 11 where the Gentiles are grafted in to
[11:11] the holy tree God's spirit but then
[11:14] finally the time of the Gentiles will be
[11:16] fulfilled according to Luke 21:24 as
[11:18] Jesus said and Romans 11:25 I believe it
[11:21] is until the last Gentile believer is
[11:24] saved and then God will cut off the
[11:26] Gentiles that's when the Rapture happens
[11:29] Jesus snatches harpazo is the Greek word
[11:33] Jesus catches away the Gentile Church
[11:35] who's the wise virgin who has the oil
[11:37] Jesus snatches them away takes them up
[11:39] to the meeting of the air takes them to
[11:40] the the wedding ceremony then the
[11:42] wedding reception and that is when God
[11:44] then cuts off the Gentiles and he goes
[11:46] back to the Jews through the two
[11:48] prophets so again Anyone who reads 2
[11:51] Thessalonians chapter 2 will realize
[11:53] Paul never said the Holy Ghost filled
[11:54] Christians would see the Antichrist
[11:57] himself and have to choose between
[11:58] taking the the Mark or not remember
[12:01] Revelation 3:10 literally says God will
[12:03] keep us from that moment of having to
[12:05] decide because thou kept the word of my
[12:07] patience I will also keep thee from the
[12:09] hour of Temptation which will come upon
[12:11] all the world to try them that dwell
[12:13] upon the Earth and second John Rich read
[12:16] Matthew 24 now Matthew 24 is greatly
[12:19] misunderstood by most people Clarence
[12:21] Larin had a good insight into it he saw
[12:23] how six of the Seven Seals were in
[12:25] Matthew 24 and he notes how they asked
[12:28] Jesus three questions in Matthew
[12:30] 24:3 what's the sign when there won't be
[12:34] one stone left upon another in the
[12:36] temple of Herod when was the sign of
[12:38] Jesus's second coming and what's the
[12:39] sign of the end of the world this is
[12:41] what John Rich misses there's three
[12:43] different comings or there's three
[12:44] different events in Matthew 24 I don't
[12:47] have time to go through all of Matthew
[12:49] 24 but I preached a sermon on it
[12:50] recently so I'll leave a link to that in
[12:52] the description if you want to listen to
[12:54] that by the grace of God to summarize it
[12:56] the six seals are in Matthew 24 and then
[12:59] Jesus answers the question about those
[13:01] three events but his answers are not in
[13:04] chronological order you have to look at
[13:06] the short context of each set of verses
[13:09] and then match them to the three
[13:11] different events so as brother Ram
[13:13] taught us you can't read the Bible like
[13:14] a newspaper it takes the Holy Spirit to
[13:17] understand the Bible and its Revelations
[13:19] there's lots of chapters in the Bible
[13:22] that are not chronological for example
[13:24] Joel chapter 1 and 2 in Joel 1 it ends
[13:27] with the great Army that's speaking of
[13:29] the 144,000 Jews then in Joel chapter 2
[13:32] you have the rapturing faith anointing
[13:35] promised for us which is yet future
[13:37] tense in Joel 2: 23-26 brother Ram tells
[13:40] us that thus sayith the Lord in the
[13:41] church age book and that is actually
[13:43] before the day of Pentecost scriptures
[13:45] in Acts 2:28 through the end of the
[13:48] chapter the people of God are being made
[13:50] ready by the word of truth from the
[13:52] messenger to this age in her will be the
[13:55] fullness of Pentecost for the spirit
[13:57] will bring the people right back to
[13:58] where they were at the beginning that is
[14:01] thus saith the
[14:03] Lord it is thus saith the Lord for that
[14:07] is what Joel 223 through 26 says be glad
[14:11] then ye children of Zion and rejoice in
[14:14] the Lord your God for he hath given you
[14:16] the former rain moderately and he will
[14:19] cause to come down for you the rain the
[14:21] former rain and the latter rain in the
[14:23] first month and the floors shall be full
[14:25] of Wheat and the fats shall overflow
[14:28] with wine and oil
[14:30] and I will restore to you the years that
[14:32] the Locust have eaten the canker worms
[14:34] and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm
[14:37] my great Army which I sent among you and
[14:39] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[14:42] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[14:44] that hath dealt wondrously with you and
[14:47] my people shall never be ashamed God
[14:50] isn't going to plant a new church but is
[14:52] going to bring his original planting
[14:54] back to Original Seed he is doing it as
[14:57] started in verse 23 by the teaching or
[15:00] former Reign next will come the Harvest
[15:03] Reign or rapturing faith so we know God
[15:06] does not put every chapter in
[15:08] chronological order the same is true
[15:10] about Matthew 24 lastly remember there
[15:12] are six reasons the Rapture is
[15:14] pre-tribulation I have this in my 2021
[15:16] book The 12 New Testament Mysteries
[15:18] revealed I also have a video about this
[15:20] topic but I'm going to go through them
[15:22] very briefly it's on pages
[15:24] 709 through
[15:27] 718 reason one the Great Tribulation is
[15:30] described as trouble for Israel trouble
[15:32] for the foolish virgins and trouble for
[15:34] Sinners but not for the Holy Ghost
[15:36] filled Christian reason number two
[15:38] there's no mention of Christ bride or
[15:40] church in the tribulation text in the
[15:42] Book of Revelation reason number three
[15:45] the bride or true church is specifically
[15:47] promised a pardon from God's Divine
[15:49] wrath and of course the wrath of God is
[15:51] poured out during the tribulation
[15:53] period reason number four the bride or
[15:55] true church is foreshadowed to receive a
[15:57] pardon from God's Divine
[16:01] wrath reason number five Jesus and Paul
[16:04] taught the Rapture was imminent at any
[16:06] unknown day as an approaching Thief
[16:09] while the other views can number or
[16:11] count to the
[16:13] day and six and finally the Rapture is
[16:15] the removal of the grace of God for
[16:17] Gentiles in preparation for the
[16:19] Antichrist public Revelation and God's
[16:22] return to the Jewish
[16:25] people in
[16:27] closing friends hope this video was a
[16:29] blessing by the grace of God it's so
[16:30] refreshing to revisit important topics
[16:33] of course like the Rapture and revisit
[16:35] all the scriptures and quotes from God's
[16:37] Prophet brother William brandham telling
[16:38] us that it's a pre-tribulation Rapture
[16:41] again I found it surprising that this
[16:43] summer The Bible that I use most often
[16:45] the scopio Bible was being attacked the
[16:48] Bible our Prophet used was being
[16:49] attacked and of course the
[16:50] pre-tribulation Rapture Revelation was
[16:52] of being attacked of course this man
[16:55] John Rich probably has good intentions
[16:57] it seems like Tucker Carlson has good
[16:58] intentions as well but as we've heard
[17:00] before they're probably just sincere but
[17:02] sincerely wrong remember the Bible calls
[17:04] the Rapture a mystery in 1 Corinthians
[17:08] 15:51 so that means if someone doesn't
[17:11] understand this doesn't mean they're
[17:12] lost doesn't mean they're going to hell
[17:14] the revelation of the Mysteries belong
[17:16] to God's true children who are baptized
[17:18] with the Holy Ghost as Deuteronomy 29:29
[17:21] plainly proves Revelation 10:7 Matthew
[17:24] 13 Jesus said the Mysteries are given to
[17:26] you they're given to the humble those
[17:29] that become like babes so we Rejoice
[17:31] that the mysteries of God have been
[17:32] finished that's what my 2021 book was
[17:35] about if brother BR fulfilled Revelation
[17:37] 10:7 which we know he did then every
[17:39] Bible defined mystery has to be finished
[17:42] or revealed and they are by the grace of
[17:44] God I thought about doing a entire video
[17:47] on brother Ram's quotes about scoffield
[17:49] and scoffield Bible so if you'd like
[17:50] more information about that let me know
[17:52] if you'd like to see that video let me
[17:54] know by the grace of God praise God that
[17:56] the Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon we
[17:58] don't know know the day or the hour but
[18:00] we're told that we'll know the season
