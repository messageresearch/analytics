[0:00] and notice the Bible said here they eat
[0:03] and they drink of course with their
[0:05] pretty women now when you realize that
[0:07] that's all right eating and drinking
[0:09] that's one of the natural laws of life
[0:11] we have to do it but when that's all
[0:13] upon your
[0:14] mind the day the people just become
[0:18] gluttons drunk women drinking in the
[0:22] restaurants and you go into a place
[0:25] where the the high balls and Cocktails
[0:28] are sered the women I've drink the
[0:32] man Jesus said as it was the days of
[0:36] Noah they were eating and drinking and
[0:39] giving in marriage in other words they
[0:41] were living with the women without being
[0:43] married to them amen and today while
[0:47] it's so instituted they did have a Reno
[0:51] that you could get married and divorced
[0:53] and married again all the same day but
[0:55] that's way out of date now the the
[0:58] husband soal and wives pack different
[1:01] keys to their rooms in these big cities
[1:04] now I travel I'm right in the cities and
[1:07] know it to be true that the husband has
[1:10] his dates and the wife has her
[1:13] dates oh it's such a conglomeration of
[1:17] of
[1:18] rotness until it's produced a bunch of
[1:22] of soft
[1:24] lazy no good am uh
[1:28] Hellbound gener
[1:33] these episodes has been on the earth
[1:35] since the days of Noah we find out when
[1:38] God had Noah the prophet of
[1:40] righteousness going forth with his
[1:42] message there was an episode of
[1:44] immorality in that day as the Bible said
[1:46] eating drinking marrying giving in
[1:48] marriage we find out gluttonous and
[1:50] immorality and so forth taking place in
[1:52] that day and then the world fell apart
[1:55] because the people rejected the message
[1:58] of God for that
[2:01] day Noah was a prophet anointed of God
[2:04] sent of God with a message from God and
[2:07] he gave the people a warning before the
[2:09] Judgment come and they sniggered and
[2:11] laughed and made fun of it and scoffed
[2:14] and the whole world system fell apart
[2:17] and that day and is drowned beneath the
[2:19] Seas right why they rejected the message
[2:22] of the
[2:24] hour now after the same manner also 25th
[2:29] verse
[2:30] after the same manner also he took the
[2:33] cup and when he had s saying this cup is
[2:37] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[2:41] as off as you drink it in remembrance of
[2:44] me for as off remember now far as off as
[2:49] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[2:53] you do sh forth the Lord's death till he
[2:57] comes how long until he come
[3:02] am wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[3:06] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[3:09] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[3:12] and the blood of the Lord let me stop
[3:14] just a minute the reason he said this
[3:16] you notice in another verse here another
[3:18] chapter that he said I understand when
[3:20] you when you come together you're eating
[3:24] even getting drunk at the Lord's table
[3:26] they misunderstood it you see they just
[3:29] glutted in see just like people are
[3:31] doing today just live any kind of life
[3:33] and take it see he said you got homes to
[3:36] eat in see but this is an ordinance that
[3:40] we should keep
[3:41] seeing now not not only that but man
[3:44] they have to set the time up so they can
[3:46] get out and play golf or something like
[3:48] that take a little exercise get some of
[3:49] the fat off of them what a Pity the rest
[3:54] of the world starving to death you think
[3:55] we're not going to receive damnation for
[3:57] these
[3:58] things sure we
[4:02] will I've left the Nations and poor
[4:04] little children ringing their hands in
[4:06] their eyes and crying their little dirty
[4:07] faces like that crying for a piece of
[4:09] bread in America some sometimes in the
[4:12] afternoon a midafternoon A8 plate and
[4:14] half of it red off in a garbage can to
[4:16] feed you a
[4:18] hog it's not
[4:20] right and brother the time's coming when
[4:23] God will make us pay for those things
[4:27] too now that's a wonderful thing but yet
[4:31] in having that many times the people
[4:34] stray away and they make an idol out of
[4:37] the very thing that God has ordained do
[4:39] you believe that look at the serpent the
[4:42] brass serpent in the wilderness did you
[4:44] know the prophet had to tear that
[4:45] serpent to Pieces why because the people
[4:48] are worshiping The Serpent and they made
[4:51] an idol out of it do you believe you can
[4:53] do that today you can make an idol out
[4:55] of your church you can make an idol out
[4:57] of your pastor you can make an ID lot of
[5:00] an evangelist and I'm afraid that that's
[5:02] what a whole lot of it's being done they
[5:05] idolize the man
