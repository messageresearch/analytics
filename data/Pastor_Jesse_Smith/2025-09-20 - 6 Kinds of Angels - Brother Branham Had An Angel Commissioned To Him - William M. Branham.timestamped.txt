[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] And I one night saw our Lord Jesus. I'm
[0:06] saying this with permission I believe
[0:09] from the Holy Spirit. The angel of the
[0:12] Lord that comes is not the Lord Jesus.
[0:15] It doesn't look like him in the same
[0:17] vision. For the vision I saw of the Lord
[0:20] Jesus that he was a little man.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:25] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:27] this video is to answer a viewer's
[0:29] question about angels. Recently, I was
[0:31] asked to do a video about angels. So, by
[0:34] the grace of God, we'll make a simple
[0:36] short video here on angels. So, I'll
[0:39] start off by saying I could be wrong on
[0:40] some of these teachings here. I'm just
[0:43] doing my best by the grace of God.
[0:44] Again, it's not the deepest study I've
[0:46] ever done, but I thought it was an
[0:47] excellent question by God's grace. And
[0:49] so, for the outline, we'll begin with
[0:52] five or six kinds of angels in the
[0:54] Bible. And then second we'll look at
[0:56] various attributes of angels. And third
[0:59] we'll look at brother Brandham's angel
[1:01] by God's grace.
[1:04] So let's begin here uh with the five or
[1:06] six types of angels. And again I could
[1:08] be wrong on some of these. There could
[1:09] be less types of angels in the Bible or
[1:12] more. The first and most important type
[1:14] of angel is the angel of the Lord. This
[1:17] is God in angelic form. It's God taking
[1:21] on a theophony body. Brother Ram calls
[1:24] it the covenant angel.
[1:26] And so we see the covenant angel
[1:28] numerous places. I'll just hit the
[1:29] highlights here. In Genesis 22:15 and
[1:33] 16, the Bible said, "The angel Lord
[1:34] called into Abraham and said, "By myself
[1:37] have I sworn, saith the Lord." So here
[1:40] we see an angel speaking with divine
[1:42] authority, saying, "Saith the Lord," and
[1:46] swearing by himself. So this is God
[1:49] speaking to Abraham. Of course, God gave
[1:51] the covenant to Abraham. We call it the
[1:53] Abrahamic covenant. So that's our first
[1:56] picture of the angel of the Lord as far
[1:58] as I can tell there to Abraham. Second
[2:01] example would be with Moses. Now Moses
[2:03] had a couple interactions with the angel
[2:05] of the Lord in Exodus 3:es 2-6. The
[2:08] angel Lord appears unto Moses in a flame
[2:11] of fire out of midst of a bush and says,
[2:13] "I am the God of thy father, the God of
[2:16] Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of
[2:18] Jacob." And later God calls himself as
[2:21] the I am God. Brother Ram said in God
[2:24] commissioning Moses in 1953 that was the
[2:26] angel of the Lord Jesus Christ sitting
[2:28] in that bush the pillar of fire that led
[2:30] the children of Israel through the
[2:31] wilderness. Any teacher knows the angel
[2:34] of the covenant was Jesus Christ. So
[2:37] that's something I had to learn when I
[2:39] became a believer. when I really
[2:40] repented and gave my heart to the Lord
[2:42] was that the Lord would show up in
[2:43] angelic form at times to different
[2:45] servants of God, prophets of God
[2:47] throughout the Old Testament. The next
[2:50] one is the angel Lord or the captain of
[2:52] the Lord's host. In Joshua 5:13-15,
[2:56] Abraham said Joshua, the angel Lord that
[2:58] led Israel is the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[3:02] there in Joshua chapter 5, he's called
[3:03] the captain of the host of the Lord.
[3:06] I'll go to the New Testament now here by
[3:08] God's grace. Again, just hitting the
[3:09] highlights in Acts 27 23-2.
[3:14] Paul was in a ship with some prisoners,
[3:16] and he said, "There stood by me this
[3:18] night, the angel of God, whose I am and
[3:21] whom I serve." So, I don't know if this
[3:23] is the covenant angel, the Lord Jesus,
[3:26] or just the ministering angel or
[3:28] guardian angel that was set over Paul
[3:31] because in verse 24, it said, "Lo, God
[3:33] hath given thee all them that sail with
[3:36] thee." But we can clearly see that Paul
[3:38] had an angel with him throughout his
[3:40] whole life and ministry just like Moses,
[3:42] just like Abraham, just like Joshua and
[3:45] of course just like God's prophet
[3:46] brother Brandham in this day. And then
[3:48] the final angel lord appearance that I
[3:50] want to go over is Revelation 10:es 1-7.
[3:53] Here we see a mighty angel come down
[3:55] from heaven and he has attributes like
[3:57] unto Christ described in Revelation 1.
[4:00] He has a face like the sun and feet like
[4:03] pillars of fire. So those are attributes
[4:06] mentioned of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[4:07] Revelation 1. Revelation 1 said his
[4:10] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[4:12] his strength and feet like unto brass in
[4:15] Revelation 11:15. And remember friends,
[4:17] brother Ram said Revelation 10 1-7 is
[4:20] history. And what is the attraction on
[4:22] the mountain? 1965.
[4:24] So we believe this means the Lord Jesus
[4:26] Christ came down and met with brother
[4:28] Brandham in order to reveal the seven
[4:31] seals to brother Brham that he could
[4:32] preach them to us. the revelations
[4:34] contained therein with thus sayith the
[4:36] lord. All right, moving on now to the
[4:38] second type of angel is the archangel.
[4:41] Now the only archangel by name is
[4:42] Michael. There's only two occurrences in
[4:45] the entire bible of archangel. Both are
[4:47] Michael. Revelation 12:7 said he led the
[4:51] war against Lucifer in heaven. And then
[4:54] an archangel or voice of archangel is
[4:57] connected to the rapture in 1
[4:58] Thessalonians 4:16.
[5:00] For the rapture, there's the shout voice
[5:02] and trump. So, the second attribute is
[5:05] the voice and it's called the voice of
[5:07] the archangel. So, perhaps Michael is
[5:09] involved somehow with the gentile
[5:11] rapture. I'm not exactly certain of
[5:13] that, but Michael's the only archangel
[5:16] named and there's only two mentions of
[5:18] archangel in the in the entire New
[5:20] Testament or in the entire Bible. Jude
[5:23] 1:9 also mentions Michael and he's
[5:27] connected with the resurrected body of
[5:29] Moses. So again, you have an archangel
[5:31] connected with resurrection. And so what
[5:33] is the rapture of the gentile bride?
[5:35] It's a resurrection of the dead in
[5:36] Christ first and then we which are alive
[5:38] and remain will be changed in a moment
[5:40] in a twinkling of an eye and caught up
[5:42] in the air to meet the Lord and the dead
[5:44] in Christ. What a wonderful promise. But
[5:46] again, archangels are connected to
[5:49] resurrection. Moses's in Jude 1:9 and
[5:53] then also the gentile rapture in 1
[5:55] Thessalonians 4:16.
[5:58] The third type of angel is the cherub.
[6:00] There are 69 mentions of cherub or
[6:03] cherubam or cherubs in the entire bible.
[6:06] 68 in the old testament, one in the new
[6:08] testament. Of course, I can only hit the
[6:10] highlights of these. Most of the
[6:12] mentions of cherub are recorded in
[6:15] reference to how they were handcrafted
[6:18] and put into the tabernacle Moses and
[6:20] also the temple of Solomon. But in
[6:22] Genesis 3:24, cherub cherubs guarded the
[6:27] tree of life with flaming swords on
[6:29] earth. And then Exodus 25 18- 22 speak
[6:34] of the cherub or cherubam that faced
[6:36] each other on top of the ark of the
[6:38] covenant. They had two wings that
[6:41] touched one another. They faced each
[6:43] other where God communed with the high
[6:45] priest. And then there's many mentions
[6:48] of course of God dwelling between the
[6:49] cherubams in heaven in the Old Testament
[6:51] as well. Psalm 18:10 is very
[6:54] interesting. It says God rides on the
[6:56] wings of cherub. So it seems like God
[6:58] uses cherubam to come down and minister
[7:01] to the believers on earth perhaps, but
[7:04] I'm not exactly certain of that. And
[7:06] fourth, cherubims are mentioned in
[7:09] Ezekiel chapter 10. They're also called
[7:11] living creatures in Ezekiel 10:20. And
[7:14] the Bible says there's coals of fire
[7:15] between the cherubams. So we know
[7:18] cherubams are near the coals of fire in
[7:20] heaven. And that also relates to the
[7:22] fourth type of angel called saraphim.
[7:24] But before we get to saraphim, Lucifer
[7:28] was the anointed cherub that coverth in
[7:30] Ezekiel 28 14 and 16. So God's
[7:34] adversary. Lucifer or Satan was a cherub
[7:38] to begin with, but pride exalted his
[7:41] heart. According to Isaiah chapter 14, I
[7:43] believe. Also related to cherub are the
[7:46] living creatures. Again, Ezekiel 10:14
[7:49] and 15. These creatures have four faces
[7:52] a piece. They have a face of a cherub,
[7:55] man, lion, and eagle. very similar to
[7:57] the four living creatures or the four
[8:00] beasts or four zunes in Revelation 4:es
[8:04] 6-8. So I don't quite understand the
[8:07] differences there. So the face of the ox
[8:09] is missing in Ezekiel 10, but the face
[8:12] of the ox of course is present in
[8:13] Revelation 4 6-8. So I'm not sure why
[8:16] there's a change there. Perhaps they're
[8:19] different creatures. I don't know. Of
[8:21] course I'm open to learning, open to
[8:22] more Bible scriptures that would give
[8:23] revelation. But one thing's for sure, in
[8:25] eternity, we'll fully understand all
[8:27] these things by the grace of the Lord.
[8:30] The fourth kind of angel is the
[8:31] saraphim. They're called fiery or
[8:33] burners in Hebrew. There's only two
[8:36] occurrences in Isaiah 6:es 2 and verse
[8:39] 6. They carried a live coal in their
[8:42] hand with tongs to lay it on Isaiah's
[8:44] mouth to cleanse him from his iniquity.
[8:47] Brother Ram said, "If that ain't a
[8:49] dressed up servant, I don't know what
[8:51] is." Speaking of the seraraphim, brother
[8:53] Ram preached numerous messages on
[8:54] influence related to Isaiah and his
[8:57] influence he gained from his vision of
[8:59] seeing the Lord high and lifted up in
[9:01] Isaiah chapter 6. Brother Ram said, "If
[9:04] that ain't a dressed up servant, I don't
[9:06] know what is. Reverent, humble, and in
[9:07] action. Oh my, I tell you." So the three
[9:10] sets of wings, Brother Ram typed as
[9:12] reverence, humility, and action. Now the
[9:15] fifth kind of angel is the ministering
[9:18] spirit or guardian angel spoken of in
[9:20] Hebrews 1:14.
[9:23] The angels are sent to them that would
[9:25] be the heirs of salvation. So I believe
[9:28] these would be also called the guardian
[9:29] angels. The Bible said the angel Lord
[9:32] encamps around them that fear God. So
[9:34] that's found in Psalm 34:7.
[9:38] And Jesus said the angel of the children
[9:41] always behold the face of my father
[9:42] which is in heaven. in Matthew 18:10.
[9:46] So, it seems like ministering spirits or
[9:48] ministering angels are a different kind
[9:49] of angel or they could be cherubs. I
[9:51] don't know. But since I don't know, I'm
[9:54] just going to make this a separate group
[9:55] here. A fifth group of angels called
[9:58] ministering spirits or ministering
[9:59] angels or we might call them guardian
[10:02] angels. Now the sixth and final type of
[10:05] angel which again might be another kind
[10:07] of angel I'm not sure are called
[10:09] watchers in Daniel 4:es 131 17 and 23
[10:15] they are sent from heaven to execute
[10:17] decrees in the case of Daniel chapter 4
[10:19] this watcher is executing a a decree
[10:22] against Nebuchadnezzar the Bible said
[10:24] Daniel saw a watcher and an holy one
[10:27] come down from heaven delivers a decree
[10:29] of the watchers in verse 17 and a demand
[10:33] by the word of the holy ones. And then
[10:34] in verse 24, it says, "This is the
[10:37] decree of the most high which has come
[10:39] upon my lord the king." So I don't know
[10:42] if watchers are cherub or some other
[10:44] type of angel I've already listed. I
[10:46] don't know for sure or if they're their
[10:48] own separate type of angel. When I did a
[10:50] quick Bible search, I didn't find the
[10:52] word watcher in any other places other
[10:54] than Daniel chapter 4. So by God's
[10:57] grace, let's move on to the next
[10:58] section. Various attributes of angels.
[11:00] Now the word angel means messenger in
[11:02] both the Greek and Hebrew. Uh the Bible
[11:05] says in Hebrews 13:2 that we can
[11:07] entertain angels unawares.
[11:10] Now that would mean that an angel would
[11:12] come down sent from God but then it
[11:14] would take on a flesh body kind of like
[11:16] what happened to Gideon also Abraham in
[11:18] Genesis chapter 18 where Abraham saw
[11:20] three men. It was God's theophony
[11:22] covered in flesh and then two angels who
[11:25] had theophanes that were covered in
[11:27] flesh as well. Well, they look like
[11:28] regular men, in other words, but they
[11:30] were angels. Numerous other Bible
[11:32] characters were entertaining angels and
[11:34] not certain they were angels. I believe
[11:36] Samson's parents had that experience as
[11:38] well. The Bible says in Luke 15:10,
[11:42] there's joy in the presence of the
[11:43] angels over one sinner that repents. So
[11:46] again, I'm not certain if the angels are
[11:47] rejoicing or if it's the rejoicing of
[11:50] the repentant one and those humans who
[11:52] are watching this sinner become a
[11:54] believer, repent of his sins. But the
[11:57] Bible does say there is rejoicing in the
[12:00] presence of angels when sinners repent.
[12:02] Angels are involved in warfare. Like in
[12:05] Daniel chapter 10:es 10- 21, Daniel's
[12:08] angel was helped by Michael to break
[12:11] through the spiritual wrestling match to
[12:15] bring Daniel understanding after a
[12:17] 21-day wrestling match. And then the
[12:20] angel went and returned to the fight
[12:23] after delivering the revelation from God
[12:25] to Daniel. In 2 Kings 19:35, the angel
[12:29] of the Lord smokeote 185,000
[12:32] Assyrians under Hezekiah's reign. So
[12:35] friends, we got to keep that in mind.
[12:36] The power of angels. If we just have one
[12:38] guardian angel, it's enough to protect
[12:40] us, minister to us. That again assures
[12:43] us if we're called home to heaven at any
[12:46] time, it would be God's will. God
[12:48] allowed it. But if God wants to protect
[12:51] us, surely he can do that because one
[12:53] angel can easily defeat over 185,000
[12:56] men.
[12:58] Matthew 26:53 tells us that Jesus had
[13:01] access of over 12 legions of angels. He
[13:04] could have called for them, but he
[13:05] didn't in order to fulfill the scripture
[13:07] as God's suffering servant. And praise
[13:11] God to give us eternal salvation through
[13:13] his shed blood. And then finally, Elisha
[13:16] and a servant in 2 Kings 6:16-17
[13:20] realized there was a mountain full of
[13:22] horses and chariots of fire round about
[13:26] them. So God let Elisha be aware of this
[13:30] host of angels, this angel army that
[13:33] surrounded them and that encouraged
[13:35] Elisha's servant to know that God was
[13:37] protecting them. Now friends, I don't
[13:39] know if an angel army surrounds every
[13:41] believer, but in this case, God let
[13:43] Elisha and the servant see that they had
[13:46] plenty of protection from heaven by the
[13:48] grace of God. The last one I'll share is
[13:50] Matthew 4:11. How the devil left Jesus
[13:53] after his temptation, and behold, angels
[13:55] came and ministered unto him. So again,
[13:58] we get this idea of God sending angels
[14:00] to minister to our spiritual needs after
[14:03] difficult battles. So if we're ever
[14:06] refreshed after a season of difficult
[14:08] trials, tribulations, and so forth, and
[14:11] that would be the angels of the Lord or
[14:13] the angel of the Lord ministering to us
[14:15] and strengthening us. That reminds us
[14:17] again of how as Elijah was under the
[14:19] juniper tree in First Kings 19:5 and an
[14:23] angel touched him and said, "Arise and
[14:25] eat." So it's wonderful to know that God
[14:27] sends his angels when we have need of
[14:29] it. Remember Elijah wanted to die, but
[14:31] God sent his angel instead to strengthen
[14:33] him, give him courage. Such a comfort to
[14:35] know that God will send his angel to us
[14:37] when we need supernatural strength, when
[14:41] we need help from heaven. Lastly, let's
[14:44] look at brother Ram's angel here by
[14:45] God's grace. I first want to start by
[14:48] reading this quote from 1955. How the
[14:50] angel came to me and his commission from
[14:51] Chicago, Illinois. Brother Ram said,
[14:54] "The angel of the Lord that comes is not
[14:56] the Lord Jesus. It doesn't look like him
[14:58] in the same vision. He said, "When I saw
[15:01] the Lord Jesus, he was a little man when
[15:03] he was out praying for his dad in a
[15:05] sagebrush field." He said, "Jesus had a
[15:08] white garment on, a little fellow, had
[15:09] his arms folded like this, a beard kind
[15:12] of short, hair down to his shoulders."
[15:15] The next quote is from Expectation 1950.
[15:18] Brother Ram said, "The angel that
[15:19] followed him, not the Lord Jesus, was a
[15:21] big large man about 200 lb, dark hair to
[15:24] his shoulder."
[15:26] I used chat gtp to make the thumbnail
[15:29] and the image of the angel was from AI
[15:32] and I just put this description from
[15:33] brother Brandham into the AI and that's
[15:36] what it produced.
[15:38] And the final quote is from El Shadi
[15:40] 1959. Brother Ram speaking about the
[15:43] pillar of fire picture from Houston
[15:45] Coliseum 1950. And brother Ram calls
[15:48] that the same pillar of fire that
[15:49] followed the children of Israel. So if
[15:52] that's the case, then that pillar fire
[15:53] picture is the Lord Jesus, the angel of
[15:56] the covenant. And that would make sense
[15:58] because brother Random was restoring the
[16:01] truce of the new covenant or the new
[16:02] testament to the bride here at the end
[16:05] of the leosian church age because it had
[16:07] been lost during the church age. So God
[16:09] had to start restoring it through Martin
[16:10] Luther, John Wesley, William Seymour,
[16:13] and then God's prophet, brother William
[16:14] Brandham.
[16:17] Brother Random said, "Here it is, the
[16:18] pillar fire back again today, dwelling
[16:20] in all of us, the universal church,
[16:22] doing the same thing. Jesus Christ the
[16:24] same yesterday, today, and forever."
[16:27] In closing, friends, hope this video was
[16:30] a blessing by the grace of God. It's
[16:31] great to review these truths and to know
[16:33] that when we need ministering to, when
[16:36] we need strength, God sends out his
[16:38] angels to us to help us by the grace of
[16:40] God. I love this verse from Isaiah 63:9.
[16:44] In all their affliction he was afflicted
[16:45] and the angel of his presence saved
[16:47] them. In his love and in his pity he
[16:50] redeemed them and bare them and carried
[16:52] them all the days of old.
[16:54] The reason I love this is because it
[16:56] shows that any angel of the Lord that
[16:58] comes to us brings the presence of God,
[17:01] the holy presence of God. So when we
[17:04] feel the presence of the Lord, it could
[17:05] be the Lord Jesus himself or it could be
[17:07] the angel Lord because the angel Lord
[17:09] carries his presence or a ministering
[17:11] spirit. we'd say a ministering angel,
[17:13] our guardian angel, sent to us. And I
[17:16] love how God said he's sending the angel
[17:19] in his love and his pity to the
[17:22] redeemed. And we are redeemed. We're
[17:23] bought with the precious blood of Jesus
[17:26] Christ. Jesus paid our ransom, our debt.
[17:30] He purchased us with his holy blood. We
[17:33] belong to him. So, he sends his
[17:35] ministering spirits to bring us what we
[17:37] have need of. The Bible said he bore
[17:40] them and carried them all the days of
[17:41] old. And that's the same for us. It is
[17:43] God's spirit through his angels that is
[17:47] carrying us, protecting us all the days
[17:49] of our lives. We have so much to be
[17:50] thankful for and rejoice in. So friends,
[17:53] let's thank God for his protection, his
[17:55] guardian angels. Let's be constantly
[17:57] aware of their presence. As brother Ram
[17:59] said, let's live so close to God like
[18:02] Zachariah and Elizabeth so that God will
[18:04] visit us just like he visited Zechariah.
[18:07] And again, this was not a deep study by
[18:10] any means, but I was blessed as I was
[18:12] spending a few hours in this study.
[18:14] Please let me know any mistakes I made.
[18:16] Perhaps I can make a part two or if
[18:18] there's additional questions, I could do
[18:20] a part two with questions and answers by
[18:22] God's grace. Praise God for the angel of
[18:25] his presence. Thank God that we get to
[18:26] enjoy the presence of the Lord Jesus
[18:28] Christ.
[18:30] If you have any questions, concerns, or
[18:31] testimonies about this video, please
[18:33] contact me.
[18:35] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[18:37] the desire of your heart.

[18:41] &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[18:43] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[18:46] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[18:49] good news that Jesus raised from the
[18:51] dead, living among man today, his
[18:53] church. The same Jesus that was
[18:56] yesterday will be today and forever
[18:59] is never failed.
