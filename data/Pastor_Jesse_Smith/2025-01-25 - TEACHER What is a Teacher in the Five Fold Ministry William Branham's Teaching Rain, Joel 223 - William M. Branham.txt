TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the teacher is a special man he sits back under the anointing of the spirit it's able to take the words and put them together by the holy spirit that the pastor advances either one could not compare with him greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer the question what is a Bible teacher in the fivefold ministry this video is the final video in a five-part series on the five-fold ministry spoken of by St Paul in Ephesians 4:1 by God's grace we've covered the pastor the Apostle the Evangelist the prophet and now we're looking at the teacher let's begin with a definition of the teacher the word teacher from Ephesians 4:11 is Greek Lexicon number 13:20 one who is fitted to teach for a deeper definition we go to the next Greek Lexicon number number 13 21 did ASCO and it means to impart instruction instill Doctrine into one to explain or expound a thing so this definition gives us a better understanding of the teacher he is one who imparts instruction gives Doctrine explains or expounds a thing now the word instruct also means to command so the teacher gives Bible instructions or Bible commands as we'll see this is very important important to the Lord Jesus Christ ties him perfectly with the Great Commission from Matthew 2819 and 20 let's start with two quotes from God's Prophet brother William Marin brandham about the teacher the first is from God doesn't call men to judgment without first warning him July 24th 1963 brother R said the teacher is a special man he's under the anointing of the spirit to put the words together by the holy spirit that the pastor and evangelist cannot compare with so having the single gift to teach is different than a pastoring gift a teacher doesn't have the pastoring anointing needed to feed the flock counsel the flock and as Paul said take care of the Church of God in 1 Timothy 3:5 if you remember the pastor video brother Bram said the Pastor is able to sit down with two individuals that may have a disagreement and bring them back into fellowship and obviously the pastor gift is a more frequent Ministry where the pastor is feeding the flock of God multiple times a week but as we'll see the pastor can have a gift to teach as well let's listen to the quote the teacher is a special man he sits back under the anointing of the spirit it's able to take the words and put them together by the holy spirit that the pastor evangelist either one could not compare with him but you see in the church there is a pastor and that Pastor is a special person he's built to where he can uh he can put up with the fussing of the people he he is a bird bur barrier he's the ox of the team he he's a man that can sit down when the somebody's got something against somebody else and sit down with them two families and take either side and reason it out and bring it right back into sweetness he he's a pastor he knows how to take care of things the second quote is from Ephesians parallels Joshua 1960 brother Bram said Bible teaching is a little treacherous you know and then he differentiates teaching and preaching he said preach teach ing catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word or conviction by the word but teaching places a man positionally where he is then he's rightly able to have faith if he's been taught the word of God correctly let's listen to the quote Bible teaching is usually a little treacherous a little you know kind of walking out on the thin ice we call it but we just feel that maybe at this ha and at this time it might be good to kind of bring the the church to what I think to a a complete uh understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus amen and sometimes I think that preaching is a wonderful thing but I believe sometimes brother beer that teaching goes beyond that amen and kindly especially to the church now preaching usually catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places the man positionally what he is and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are now let's look at a section of I'm calling importance of teaching let's start with Matthew 28:19 and 20 Jesus gives the Great Commission and said he's always with us as we teach others to obey all the commands of God so Matthew 28:19 Jesus said go ye therefore and teach All Nations so teaching must be part of the Great Commission it can't just be preaching or declaring God's Great Tidings but it must be teaching them giving commands giving Doctrine then he repeats it again in verse 20 teaching them to observe all things things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I'm with you always even unto the end of the world how long does it take Christians to observe all the commands well it takes an entire lifetime so this means we'll need Godly teachers during the entire lifetimes of the Believers and thank God we have them by the grace of God so we see Jesus Christ puts a major emphasis on preaching and teaching as a major important part of the Fulfillment of the Great Commission next in Matthew 5 5:19 Jesus said whosoever therefore shall break one of these least Commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of God but whosoever shall do and teach them the same Shall be Called great in the kingdom of God so notice it's very important for teachers to live what they're teaching if they live what they teach they'll be called great in the kingdom of God that's a future reward it should not be a reward teachers receive during their lifetimes because God's Prophet brother brandom told us to never call each other great he said this in trying to do God's service without being his will 1965 he said sometimes great guys get together and they talk about each other saying great so and so brother Ram said don't never do that there's no great ones among us because God is the model of humility he came down from the ivory palaces of Glory to become one of us now who is the big one let's listen to the quote sometimes great guys get together you hear him say great so and so great so and so our great don't never do that there's no great ones Among Us there's only one great one and that's God we are brothers sisters I don't care if you're a pastor or church got five people in it that don't make you little that makes you a brother see if you're true to God's word don't care what how you don't get little God don't have little children and big children he just has children they're all the same notice God himself come from the ivory palaces of Glory to become one of us now who's the big one to not come down here take the form of a priest but a servant wash the very clay that he created the feet of his Apostles and other now who's great now in this next section I'm going to call it teachers in the New Testament you can see how they're differentiated from pastors prophets evangelists and the other four gifts of the five-fold ministry in Acts 13: 1-4 in Antioch there were certain prophets and teachers who came together to fast and pray and minister to the Lord and that's when the Holy Ghost said separate me Paul and Barnabas so it's interesting I don't know why they call it just prophets and teachers perhaps the pastors were busy feeding their flocks and couldn't come and fast and pray I don't know but just prophets and teachers came to fast and pray and God gave Paul and Barnabas thus sayith the Holy Ghost so the early church identified prophets and teachers and of course pastors and evangelists and apostles acts 13 is the sending forth of Apostles so we should be able to recognize them today because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever next in 1 Corinthians 12:28 and 19 Paul told the Corinthians God hath set someon the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers then he said are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles and of course the answer is no everyone has their individual gift and we must be faithful with the gifts God has given to us the next verse is 1 Timothy 3:2 Paul says a bishop which in this case is overseer which must be a pastor or Shepherd must then be blameless the husband of one wife Vigilant sober of good behavior given to hospitality apt to teach the word apt in the Greek means skillful in teaching so a pastor has to be able to teach as well of course because because he's feeding the flock of God like we said multiple times a week and remember pastors can have multiple Gifts of preaching just like St Paul had all the five preaching gifts I made a video recently how brother brandom had all the five preaching gifts and God would use them at different times and seasons of his life but R said Martin Luther even had all nine gifts of the holy spirit so on top of the preaching gifts Martin Luther may have had he also had all nine gifts of the holy spirit which is quite a great responsibility but he'll be rewarded much because was faithful with those gifts by the grace of God the next section I want to call this both preaching and teaching needed by Jesus and Paul so in Jesus's Earthly Ministry and the ministry of all the apostles in the book of Acts they always had both preaching and teaching it wasn't just preaching it was teaching as well Matthew 4:23 Jesus went all about Galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people so Jesus both taught and preached and again the difference is teach is to give commands to give Doctrine instruction preach is to declare to publish truth so I'll give some examples in just a moment but the same idea about Jesus ministry is repeated in Matthew 9:35 preaching and teaching and Matthew 11:1 preaching and teaching Jesus did both preaching and teaching Matthew 5:42 and daily in the temple and in every house they cease not to teach and preach Jesus Christ we must have both we must preach Jesus Christ we must teach Jesus Christ then next acts 15:35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with many others so Paul brother ramam said was the greatest missionary outside of Jesus Christ he did both teaching and preaching of course we know Paul said he was also a teacher of the Gentiles that was in 1 Timothy 2:7 here's some simple examples of the difference between preaching and teaching I have three examples the first example is preaching or declaring is God hears our prayers see that's publishing good news that's encouraging God hears your prayers now teaching would be different it'd be using Jesus's prayer and other prayers to explain how to pray when to pray explaining or expounding giving commands on prayer second example of preaching would be the seven seals are revealed that's a great declaration that's great news being published as preachers are preaching but the difference is with teaching when you go to teaching on the Seven Seals you're explaining the symbols and their meanings expounding on them going verse by verse in fact there's numerous quotes from God's Prophet brother Brandon where he talked about he was teaching on the Seven Seals through the revelation of the Holy Ghost the angels of God visiting him for seven days straight to reveal the revelation of the Seven Seals how did he present it to us did he preach it or did he teach it he said he was teaching on the Seven Seals and I'm sure there was times in the sermons where he was preaching or just declaring truths as well but when he was explaining the symbols and giving commands about how to live a Christian Life that was teaching and the third and final example I hear this one often is God is the Healer God's present now to heal Jesus wants to heal that's all good preaching we need that that's preaching but teaching is different teaching explains we must confess our sins first and find the will of God first and then even give thanks to God for God's will whether he heals us or not so teaching will give commands on how a person will go about being healed you might first have to go confess your sins or you might have to first be Anointed with oil or you might have to first let people lay hands on you or you might have to wait numerous years for your healing but teaching will explain those different Avenues of God's healing power in the next section we look at Doctrine or teaching is like refreshing do according to God so think of a morning when you walk out in the grass or in a park and there's DW on the grass that is what God Likens his teaching unto a refreshing du this is found in Deuteronomy 321 and2 God says in verse two my Doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distill as the do so I love this God says when God teaches when God gives Doctrine and instruction and commands it's like rain from Heaven it's refreshing and God's speech God's Doctrine is as the do so notice according to thus saith the Bible Doctrine and teaching is like rain and do Reign and do is required for Life required for growth required for refreshment and our lives require the refreshing teaching of God's word I'm just going to add something in here I've noticed among the goat preachers I call them they are constantly attacking teaching and Doctrine they have a saying that kind of goes like this Jesus isn't a Doctrine and I agree Jesus is not a Doctrine but if Jesus ever gives you a command or if Jesus ever tells you to do something then Jesus has given you a Doctrine because that's what Doctrine means instruction commands and we see Jesus all the time giving commands teaching giving instruction for his Believers to follow and he said said they must observe his teachings in all the areas of their life they must observe all the teaching all the instruction so I believe the goat group here is exalting experiences above the word and we should never do that we need both the word and we need experiences notice what brother Ram said about Moses since Deuteronomy 32 is referring to Moses brother Ram said what was the difference between balam and Moses the difference was Moses's teaching was perfect from the anointed ones of the end time 19 65 let's listen to the quote bam Anointed with the same spirit that was up on Moses what was the difference the teaching of Moses was perfect the Bible said here in second Peter that it was a teaching of balum that Israel received that God never did forgive unpardonable sins now let's look at Joel 2:23 brother Ram said this is thus sayith the Lord for the bride referring to rapturing Faith he said that in the church age book but what about the true seed it will happen just as we have said the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the Lord it is thus saith the Lord for that is what Joel 2 23-26 says I'm going to jump ahead in the verse but it says for he hath given you the former rain moderately he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month it seems people fail to remember that brother Ram said the latter rain is rapturing Faith which hasn't fallen yet because we haven't been raptured and then they forget brother BR said the former Reign was his is Teaching Ministry so again these goat preachers are bashing teaching bashing Doctrine but yet that was the whole point of brother Ram's Ministry was to teach the people the apostolic faith to turn their hearts back to the apostolic fathers so they would observe all of Jesus's commands what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rign which is the spring or teaching rain the latter rain then is the Harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching Reign had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turned the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening onto the Rapture had not come so some of these goat preachers don't even know they're bashing the former rain they're in a very sad condition so we continue to pray for them by God's grace brother Ram said this in a resume of the church ages chapter 10 in the church age book he's talking about the anointing that fell at isua Street they thought it was latter rain they thought it was the long awaited restoration but brother Ram said it was not because the latter rain can only come after the former rain he says the latter rain then is the Harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching Reign had not come so brother bam calls former Reign teaching Reign and that's what the word former means in Hebrew teaching the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come so brother Ram's Ministry is called a Teaching Ministry according to the Holy Ghost through brother brandham so again it's sad these goat preachers and other ones are saying they don't need the doctrine or they're saying they don't need the teaching Reign and this is sad because that means they'll drift into Pride complexes and also other false doctrin such as God always wants to heal which means you don't have to find the will of God for healing and I've already witnessed I have videos of these mistakes people have made I've already witnessed numerous of these false predictions from preachers in the goat group they publicly claim someone's going to be healed but then the individual dies and it becomes a sad disgrace and it causes confusion to the Believers how can these famous preachers say God's going to heal them and then God doesn't heal them it almost looks like like a false prophecy but of course the preachers aren't saying thus sayith the Lord in the name of the Lord but it just brings confusion upon people who believe these men to be men of God they speak so boldly and publicly but then their predictions fail to come to pass so this is why it's so important to have teaching of the word of God teaching on Divine Healing so that we know we must find the will of God first before publicly declaring God's going to heal a person here's another quote I always like to share by God's grace the four seal 1963 brother Ram said the Antichrist refuses the true bride Doctrine so there is Doctrine for the true bride of Jesus Christ it's the instruction from the Bible it's all the Bible commands Jesus said his teachers are to help the Believers observe according to again Matthew 28 19 and 20 let's listen to the quote the Antichrist refuses the true bride Doctrine and therefore he takes his own bride out and builds her up under a Creed of his own takes his own bride and makes her a denomination she gives birth to other denominations as quoted in this Holy Scripture gives birth to daughters and um she don't she becomes just like her mother natural worldly denomination a oing the spiritual bride the word and next friends here's a very important scripture 2 John 1 8-11 John said whoever abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God so just meditate on that scripture if you would for a moment he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ he hath both the father and son so whoever abides or stays with the true teaching the true doctrine of Christ that proves they're born again if they don't stay with the true teaching of Christ that proves they're not born again they don't have the Father the invisible Spirit or his son the high priest the Lord Jesus Christ then Paul says if any come and bring not this Doctrine do not receive him in his house neither bid him godp speed in this final section I'm going to look at other important quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham let's look at some quotes where brother Bram said the Seven Seals Revelation was part of his third poll or new commission and it was teaching so the opening of the word can also be the teaching of the word brother Ram said the revelation of Seven Seals was a new commission so we'll play that quote then we'll look at a guide from October 14th 1962 brother Ram said we want to go to them last seven last seals to teach that and then he said in God hiding him himself in simplicity at the beginning of the Seven Seals series he said that we might study in this before we go into the great teachings of the Seven Seals and then in the second seal brother random said last evening as we always like in the teaching on the seals teach it in the same way you do on the church ages brother R said he taught the Seven Seals the same way he taught the church ages so now we know the church Ages were teaching sermons so were the seven seal sermons backing up to 1961 the true Easter seal brother brandom again said he taught the church ages he said we found out in our teaching when we taught the church ages let's listen to those quotes and then it come to me not a voice just come to me oh that is the angels of the Lord coming to give me my new commission and when I thought that I raised up my hands and I said oh Lord Jesus what will you have me do and the vision left me for almost an hour I couldn't feeli and now the next time as far as I know to be with you will be after the church is completed and I want to then after the church ages that we want to go down to the seven uh last seals and um the seven last seals in the Book of Revelations to teach that I thought it made a a text that we might study this before we go into the the the great teachings of the Seven Seals many miss him by the way he reveals himself now last evening as we always like in teaching on the U on the seals we had teach it the same way you do on the on the U the church ages and uh when we got finished with teaching the church age the last time when I draw them out here on the on the pulpit on a board how many remembers what took place he came right down went right back on the wall and a light and dra it off himself right on the wall before Sol the angel of the Lord stood right here before several hundred people and now uh he's he's doing something real Supernatural now too and so we're just expecting great things we don't know and first thing you know in the Bible we found out in our teaching when we taught the church ages that Jesus told him before it happened about 200 years that there'd be a Doctrine or first it would be a Deeds of the nicadan and then finally become a Doctrine and when it did that he said I hate it and what did the Pentecostal do the Pentecostal up and up starchy class organized and made the Catholic Church the first mother organ organization the little minority was forced off to one side here's another quote from 1954 the seven Church ages brother Ram said he remembered staying a year and 6 months in the Book of Revelation in the Tabernacle that's what I like in teaching I just love teaching oh my I think it's wonderful it gives the basis and settles the Church of course brother R would think teaching is wonderful he just loves it he just loves the rain he just loves the dew falling from heaven and brother R again differentiates preaching from teaching their different Ministries brother Ram said preaching Waters the seeds that the teacher has taught and then he says there's a great vast difference between a teacher and preacher let's listen to the quote I remember saying a year and six months in This Book of Revelation and and the Tabernacle here that's what I like and and teaching I just love teaching oh my uh I I think it's wonderful it gives the bases and settles the church and preaching now there's some people that are preachers they can pick up the word with inspiration and sway it out there in places that's watering the seeds that the teacher has taught see now you got put some seed in first and then water and the watering comes from the preaching of the word there's a great vast difference between a teacher and a preacher see it's two different gifts of the Spirit all together two different gifts and I humbly say this but I haven't the gift of either but mine as usual is praying for the sake that's what the Lord called me to do the last quote I want to play is from the rejected King 1960 brother Ram telling brother Ram is telling about his experience going beyond the curtain of time it's the first time he told about this experience if I'm not mistaken and he said the multitudes beyond the curtain of time told Brother brandham they would go into the higher Realm Of Heaven where Jesus was in other words the seventh Dimension or we might say the third heaven because of his teaching the people said you were sent for a leader and God will come when he does he'll judge you according to what you taught them first whether they go in or not will go in according to your teaching think about that we go into the presence of Jesus Christ because of the Bible teaching the Bible commands the Bible doctrines that the former Reign Ministry gave us and then he gives examples he preached every word Peter and Paul preached he baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's when all the people were screaming out we know that and we know we're going with you someday back to the Earth and is this scriptural yes this is scriptural do we go in according to our teaching yes of course it's repentance that we hear from the teaching and then we have faith in the blood of Jesus Christ but it's first Timothy tothy 4:16 take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee Paul told Timothy he'll be saved if he obeys the teaching and his listeners will be saved if they obey the teaching just like the multitudes beyond the curtain of time shared with brother brandom let's listen to the quote they said now he's just a little higher right up that way said someday he will come to you see said you were sent for a leader and God will come and when he does he'll judge you according to what you taught them first whether they go in or not we'll go in according to your teaching I said oh I'm so glad if Paul does he have to stand like this does Peter have to stand like this yes I said then I preached every word that they preached I never did it from it one side to the other were they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I did too were they taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost I did too whatever they thought I did too and then people scream and said we know that and we know we are going with you someday back to Earth said Jesus will come and you'll be judged according to the word that you preached this and then if you are accepted at that time which you will be and said then you will present us to him as your trophies of your ministry said you will guide us to him and all together we'll go back to the Earth to live forever in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God now we have a complete series on the five full ministry I trust God will use it to help strengthen the Saints by the grace of God remember God will use this five full ministry until we all come in the unity of the faith that means he's going to use the fivefold ministry until we're raptured remember what it's for it's for the perfecting of the Saints the maturation of the Saints for the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body of Christ so I hope this Series has helped you mature I hope it has shown you the work of the ministry and if you're a part of that whether a preacher or supporting it through prayer fasting giving of tithes and offerings and I hope you've been edified as part of the body of Christ thank God the true five-fold Ministry is Jesus's gift to the church according to Ephesians 4:8 he ascended high in Heaven Led captivity captive and then he gave gifts unto men and these are the gifts he gave unto men to lead and Shepherd the flock of Jesus Christ the five-fold preaching gifts and you'll know when you're under the five full ministry correctly because you won't be tossed back and forth on every wind of Doctrine as Ephesians 4:14 says and you'll speak the truth and love growing up into him in all things which is the head even Christ Ephesians 4:15 please remember to always pray for the ministers in the five full ministry they're men they're susceptible to mistakes they need our prayers but God is faithful God will hear your prayers and all the promises in Ephesians 4 and the rest of the Bible regarding the fivefold ministry will be fulfilled by the spirit of the Lord for it's not by might not by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
