[0:04] as we begin part two please be sure to
[0:09] listen to part one of this series on
[0:12] marriage and divorce so you can
[0:14] understand the Bible definitions of
[0:16] important terminology that pertains to
[0:18] marriage and divorce remarriage and
[0:22] divorce
[0:24] the perfect will of God is for one man
[0:26] to marry one woman and be faithful to
[0:29] one another until death according to
[0:31] Matthew 19:6 and Romans 7 verse 2 the
[0:34] Bible teaches that married couples are
[0:36] bound to one another until death and are
[0:39] not free to marry anyone else while
[0:41] their first spouse is living all those
[0:44] who do so are committing adultery and
[0:46] without repentance will not inherit the
[0:49] kingdom of God according to 1st
[0:50] Corinthians 6 9 through 11
[0:54] remarriage is only allowed in two cases
[0:57] the first case is that a widow or
[0:59] widower may remain another believer who
[1:02] does not have a living spouse
[1:05] this is because a widower is no longer
[1:08] bound to their previous spouse because
[1:10] that spouse has died and they're free to
[1:12] marry again but only in the Lord or only
[1:16] another Christian first Corinthians 7
[1:18] verse 39 the wife is bound by the law as
[1:21] long as her husband liveth but if her
[1:23] husband be dead she is at liberty to be
[1:26] married to whom she will only in the
[1:28] Lord
[1:31] Romans 7 verse 1 no you're not brethren
[1:34] for I speak to them that know the law
[1:37] how that the law hath dominion over a
[1:39] man as long as he liveth for the woman
[1:42] which hath an husband is bound by the
[1:43] law to her husband sir lamb as he liveth
[1:46] but if the husband be dead she is loosed
[1:48] from the law of her husband so then if
[1:50] while husband liveth she be married to
[1:53] another man she should be called no
[1:55] doctorís but if her husband be dead she
[1:57] is free from that law so that she is no
[2:00] adulteress though she be married to
[2:02] another man
[2:03] the second case for remarriage is that a
[2:06] man only not a woman according to Jesus
[2:09] may put away his wife in divorce and
[2:11] marry another if she did not confess any
[2:14] fornications she committed before they
[2:16] were married according to Matthew 5:32
[2:19] and Matthew chapter 1 verses 18 through
[2:22] 21 because the revolving gage 'men to
[2:26] dis artisty as clearly seen through the
[2:29] Bible example of Joseph's potential
[2:31] divorce or putting away from Mary as at
[2:34] one point he believed she had committed
[2:36] fornication but we know God revealed the
[2:39] immaculate conception to Joseph before
[2:41] he put her away here is what Jesus
[2:44] taught in Matthew 5 verse 32 but I'm
[2:47] saying to you that whosoever shall put
[2:49] away his wife saving for the cause of
[2:52] fornication causeth her to commit
[2:55] adultery and whosoever shall marry her
[2:57] that is divorced committeth adultery
[3:01] so I repeat Jesus and Saint Paul taught
[3:05] that divorce and remarriage with a
[3:06] living spouse is only allowed in this
[3:09] one and only case unconfessed
[3:11] fornication before marriage
[3:15] some may question why Jesus said only a
[3:18] man marry marry for fornication and the
[3:21] answer is simple the woman Eve was the
[3:24] cause of all sin in the human race
[3:26] because she was first deceived by the
[3:28] serpent and then commanded to be under
[3:30] complete obedience to her husband
[3:32] because she was the one who initially
[3:34] fell into sin god forbid surgery mode
[3:36] with a living husband as well as God
[3:39] even forbidding women to preach the
[3:40] gospel according to 1st Timothy 2 verses
[3:43] 11 through 15 the only way a woman can
[3:46] remarry second or more time is if her
[3:49] first husband has died which loses her
[3:51] from the law of her husband
[3:55] God has displayed this pattern all
[3:57] through our Bible history such as in the
[3:59] days of Abraham David and Solomon the
[4:02] man could have multiple lives but the
[4:04] woman could not have multiple husbands
[4:08] all due to the fact that Eve was
[4:10] deceived in the beginning by the serpent
[4:12] and death entered the human race through
[4:15] her being deceived you must know that
[4:18] God allowed polygamy in the Old
[4:20] Testament even though it was not his
[4:22] perfect will but today in the New
[4:24] Testament God does not allow polygamy
[4:26] according to the teachings of Jesus
[4:28] Christ in Matthew chapter 19 verses 1 to
[4:31] 12 Matthew chapter 5 verses 31 to 32
[4:36] mark chapter 10 verses 1 to 12 and Luke
[4:40] 16 verse 18 our Lord Jesus taught we New
[4:44] Testament believers are to go back to
[4:47] the beginning with one man being fully
[4:49] committed to only one woman
[4:54] adultery and separations concerning
[4:57] adultery contrary to popular opinion in
[5:00] many churches adapter II when one spouse
[5:03] has a sexual relationship with anyone
[5:05] else who is not their spouse is not an
[5:07] acceptable cause for divorce and
[5:09] remarriage this is true because there
[5:11] are no New Testament Bible examples of
[5:14] any believer being allowed to remarry
[5:16] because their spouse committed adultery
[5:18] on them adultery does not lose someone
[5:21] from the law of their marriage vow if
[5:22] adultery takes place in a marriage the
[5:25] couple must seek forgiveness and remain
[5:27] together for if they separate and marry
[5:29] anyone else they have committed adultery
[5:33] if a doctor
[5:36] one spouse once the divorce and does so
[5:38] and remarries another the remarried
[5:40] spouse would be living in adultery but
[5:42] the divorce spouse must remain single or
[5:45] else he or she will be an adulterer as
[5:47] well
[5:49] this is the hard truth but Jesus
[5:51] specifically said fornication not
[5:54] adultery is the only cause for divorce
[5:56] and remarriage
[6:00] many churches have
[6:02] in st. paul's words in first corinthians
[6:04] 7 verse 15 which state but if the
[6:08] unbelieving depart let him depart a
[6:10] brother or sister is not under bondage
[6:13] in such cases but God have called us to
[6:16] peace
[6:17] this scripture cannot contradict what
[6:19] st. Paul wrote in verses 10 and 11
[6:22] because those verses already gave the
[6:24] only two options for couples who divorce
[6:27] or separate they must either remain
[6:29] unmarried or be reconciled notice that
[6:33] after verse 15 st. Paul rather instructs
[6:36] the believing spouse to remarry anyone
[6:38] else and that is because a spouse who is
[6:41] diverse or separated cannot marry anyone
[6:44] else according to the Word of God the
[6:46] true interpretation of verse 15 is that
[6:49] a believing spouse who has an
[6:50] unbelieving spouse who divorces or
[6:52] leaves them is not to be under bondage
[6:55] or slavery to continue to meet that
[6:57] person's needs for example if an
[7:00] unbelieving man leaves his believing
[7:02] wife the wife is not to remain a slave
[7:05] to the man and try to go to his new
[7:08] house and continue to cook his meals
[7:10] clean his house or serve Him in any
[7:13] other way because he left her she is not
[7:16] bound to meet his needs any more if he
[7:19] divorced her but she cannot remarry
[7:21] another spouse because st. Paul gave her
[7:24] two options in verses 10 and 11 she must
[7:27] either remain unmarried or wait and see
[7:30] if she can be reconciled to her first
[7:32] husband who has left her she is third
[7:35] bound to the law of her husband
[7:36] according to st. Paul's words in Romans
[7:38] 7 verses one through three concerning
[7:42] separation a married couple can separate
[7:45] or divorce for sound reasons other than
[7:47] fornication and adultery but their only
[7:50] options are to remain separated or
[7:52] reunite according to 1st Corinthians 7
[7:54] verse 11
[7:57] couple who separates in their divorces
[7:59] and then remarries any other person
[8:02] other than their first spouse is living
[8:05] in adultery and must repent or they
[8:07] cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[8:09] according to 1st Corinthians 6 verses 9
[8:11] and 11 and Galatians 5 verses 19 through
[8:14] 21 the will of God for your marriage
[8:20] some of our viewers may be wondering
[8:22] what the will of God is for their
[8:23] current marriage situation as the Bible
[8:26] teachings that have heard in this video
[8:27] series have probably enlightened them to
[8:29] truth on marriage and divorce here is
[8:32] our sincere plentiful and godly advice
[8:35] for our viewers first if you find
[8:38] yourself in the perfect will of God
[8:39] meaning God is pleased with your full
[8:42] and complete obedience to God's Word in
[8:44] regards to your marriage relationship
[8:46] stay happily in your current state and
[8:48] seek not to be loosed from your spouse
[8:51] and children
[8:53] second if you find yourself in the
[8:55] permissive will of God meaning God is
[8:58] not pleased with your disobedience
[8:59] probably fornication or adultery and God
[9:03] has allowed you in your own free will to
[9:05] disobey His Word despite his desire for
[9:08] you to walk in obedience recognize first
[9:11] if you are or are not a follower of
[9:13] God's endtime message sent through his
[9:16] prophet William Branham if you are not a
[9:19] fire of God's message given to William
[9:21] Branham though we encourage you to see
[9:23] godly counsel from your pastor before
[9:25] making any marriage decision if you are
[9:27] living in fornication or before you make
[9:31] any family altering decision if you're
[9:33] an adulterer we pray that your first
[9:36] seek to remain in your current marriage
[9:38] and family situation for God hates
[9:41] divorce and is deeply grieved when
[9:43] children are left motherless or
[9:44] fatherless
[9:47] if you're a father of God's endtime
[9:49] message sent from william branham
[9:51] that we encourage you to contact your
[9:53] pastor and seek his Bible based wisdom
[9:55] on the will of God for your marriage and
[9:57] seek not to be loosed from your spouse
[9:59] and children we want to close by
[10:03] remembering the notable and inspired
[10:05] words of brother William Branham that he
[10:07] spoke by permission from God to the
[10:09] followers of his message who were caught
[10:12] in the permissive will of God bill in
[10:14] their second or third marriages yet
[10:16] having living divorced spouses from
[10:18] their first or second marriages God told
[10:21] his prophet William Branham that those
[10:23] caught in adultery second or third
[10:25] marriages were given permission by God
[10:28] to remain in the current marriages and
[10:30] not to break up their homes and families
[10:32] and to go on serving God God commanded
[10:35] them to never divorce and remarry ever
[10:37] again and he told those parents to teach
[10:40] their children to never live in adultery
[10:42] never divorce a spouse and then remain
[10:45] another spouse for that would be
[10:47] teaching their children to commit
[10:49] adultery
[10:51] now I'm speaking to our followers only
[10:55] who's following me and this message only
[10:59] not the outside bury me record this
[11:03] before God just to this group only now
[11:09] you believe this to be true and believe
[11:14] it to come from God and by the
[11:17] vindication of his cloud and his
[11:20] messages brought me this far should not
[11:25] God up on a mountain permit me to do the
[11:27] same thing to suffer you to go on the
[11:30] way you are and do it no more
[11:32] so is your riser limousine for the hour
[11:36] is late the coming of the Lord is at
[11:40] hand we haven't got time to break these
[11:44] things up don't you dare try to do it
[11:47] again I'm speaking only to my
[11:50] congregation but if you are married and
[11:53] God bore me witness of that on the
[11:56] mountain I could say this a supernatural
[12:00] revelation to call to the opening of the
[12:02] seven seals and this is a question you
[12:04] not word let they want and as they are
[12:09] and single horn so under the modern
[12:15] condition I command you to go to your
[12:18] home with your wife now
[12:20] if you are happy with her live with her
[12:23] raise your children in the emanation of
[12:25] God but God be merciful to you if you
[12:28] ever do that again you teach your
[12:31] children to never do a thing like that
[12:33] bring it up in the emanation club and
[12:35] now that you are as your let us go now
[12:38] to late evening hour that we're knitting
[12:40] and press towards the mark of the high
[12:42] calling inside

[12:50] quotations about marriage and divorce

[12:55] Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
