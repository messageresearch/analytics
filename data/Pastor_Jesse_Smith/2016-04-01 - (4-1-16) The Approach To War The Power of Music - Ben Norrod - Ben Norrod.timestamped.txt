[1:06:39] 80 this year isn't she so you know she
[1:06:42] may not have too many years with him and
[1:06:43] i said well just you just hold on to him
[1:06:46] for a little while
[1:06:47] so
[1:06:48] anyways we're glad to be here zach let's
[1:06:50] turn to second chronicles chapter 20
[1:06:52] verse 20. please i want to uh i want to
[1:06:55] speak tonight this might be a little bit
[1:06:57] of an odd subject for some
[1:06:59] especially those that would consider
[1:07:01] you know to be an evangelistical theme
[1:07:04] of some sort i i don't really consider
[1:07:06] myself too much of an evangelist
[1:07:08] sometimes because some of the themes i
[1:07:10] use aren't necessarily what other people
[1:07:12] consider evangelistical but i i feel
[1:07:14] like when the bible said that we're
[1:07:16] supposed to reprove and rebuke with all
[1:07:18] long suffering and doctrine then
[1:07:19] evangelists ought to have something to
[1:07:21] say
[1:07:22] so then sometimes i have a tendency not
[1:07:24] to just preach on getting people they
[1:07:25] all are getting saved and things but
[1:07:27] sometimes i'd like to try to dig in and
[1:07:30] deal with things that people really live
[1:07:31] with and live out you know i like to
[1:07:34] catch them areas where they're
[1:07:35] struggling and having problems trying to
[1:07:37] figure stuff out preach that way because
[1:07:40] i found a long time ago that you can
[1:07:42] know all the mysteries of god you know
[1:07:44] all the seals the thunderstruck and all
[1:07:45] the things and thank god for every bit
[1:07:47] of that but if people don't know how to
[1:07:48] pray and how to love
[1:07:50] all of this
[1:07:55] so by god's grace we're glad we're glad
[1:07:58] amen that we've got a chance to be able
[1:08:00] to look at these things amen so i want
[1:08:02] to speak tonight if the lord will help
[1:08:04] me now it's highly possible many several
[1:08:07] years ago many times i had our first
[1:08:08] meeting that i might have preached on
[1:08:10] music at some point in my travels to uh
[1:08:13] folks here around the message but the
[1:08:15] lord has shown me some different things
[1:08:17] as i went along
[1:08:18] and uh this is all just kind of a brand
[1:08:21] new thing that the lord has given to me
[1:08:23] on this music and i want to share um
[1:08:26] this this thought with you tonight i
[1:08:28] want to call it the approach to war the
[1:08:31] approach to war the power of music and
[1:08:33] the benefits of music
[1:08:35] and uh the older i get the more
[1:08:36] long-winded i get so i'm glad i'm
[1:08:38] preaching a bunch of young people that
[1:08:40] way you won't be too quick on that 45
[1:08:42] minute tonight i'll probably go over it
[1:08:44] just a little bit as far as that's right
[1:08:46] amen second chronicles 20 verse 20. we
[1:08:49] use this thought out at your brothers
[1:08:50] down there napoleon and uh i'll tell you
[1:08:53] the lord really really blessed that i
[1:08:55] felt and i seemed like everywhere i've
[1:08:57] gone in in the message preaching this in
[1:09:00] different churches seemed like the
[1:09:01] lord's really done some great things in
[1:09:03] it one pastor come to me with tears in
[1:09:05] his eyes and he said this is the thing
[1:09:07] my church has been lacking in for ain't
[1:09:08] no telling how many years he said we
[1:09:10] didn't even know what it was he said
[1:09:11] until you brought this message on the
[1:09:13] music so i i just trust that somehow
[1:09:16] whatever the benefit would be here the
[1:09:18] weekend for the little church here at
[1:09:19] bride fellowship that the holy spirit
[1:09:21] will give that to you
[1:09:23] watch here now let's look they rose
[1:09:24] early in the morning and went forth
[1:09:26] into the wilderness
[1:09:28] and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood
[1:09:30] and said hear me o judah and the
[1:09:32] inhabitants of jerusalem
[1:09:34] believe in the lord your god so shall
[1:09:37] you be established believe his prophets
[1:09:39] so shall you prosper
[1:09:41] now years ago we used to call this 20 20
[1:09:44] vision
[1:09:46] chronicles 20 20.
[1:09:48] of course their version of it was is
[1:09:50] believe the prophets you got 20 20. but
[1:09:53] i said that's only one eye
[1:09:55] you got to believe the lord that's the
[1:09:56] other eye
[1:09:57] that the lord the prophet put together
[1:09:59] now you've got 20 20 vision you can see
[1:10:01] real clear what hour you're living in
[1:10:03] amen don't you think so amen we sure
[1:10:06] need that and when he consulted with the
[1:10:08] people now here's the thing that really
[1:10:09] troubles a lot of people around the
[1:10:11] ranks he appointed singers
[1:10:14] unto the lord that now you think that
[1:10:16] this man of god if he had anything that
[1:10:18] he could have appointed surely wouldn't
[1:10:20] have been singers certainly would have
[1:10:22] been musicians and music and things of
[1:10:24] that nature but it was it was he
[1:10:26] absolutely appointed singers unto the
[1:10:29] lord why that should praise the beauty
[1:10:32] of holiness now watch this as they went
[1:10:35] out before
[1:10:37] the army and to say
[1:10:40] if you're reading there
[1:10:42] praise the lord exactly right
[1:10:44] for his mercy endureth forever
[1:10:48] and when they begin to sing
[1:10:50] and to praise i know message people have
[1:10:52] lost that whole thing right there
[1:10:54] because to them coming to church is a
[1:10:56] staring contest with the preacher
[1:10:58] but when we come to the house of god
[1:10:59] we're supposed to worship god
[1:11:01] [Applause]
[1:11:03] we're supposed to worship we're supposed
[1:11:04] to praise and we're supposed to sing but
[1:11:07] he said i can't carry a tune in a bucket
[1:11:09] god likes your tune god likes your
[1:11:11] bucket he wants you to sing he wants you
[1:11:14] to worship
[1:11:16] if you sing bad just don't sing loud
[1:11:18] that's the key of it
[1:11:20] yeah just kind of blend in with
[1:11:22] everybody else
[1:11:23] and as they begin to sing and to praise
[1:11:26] watch the lord set ambushments against
[1:11:29] the children of ammon god said y'all are
[1:11:32] doing such a good job praising and
[1:11:33] worshiping you just keep doing that i'll
[1:11:36] fight the battle over here
[1:11:40] you don't even have to worry about too
[1:11:42] much he said just keep on worshiping
[1:11:44] keep on praising and while you're
[1:11:45] worshiping i'll fight the battle i'll
[1:11:47] ambush the devil over here on this other
[1:11:49] side
[1:11:51] oh my that'll make you happy find your
[1:11:53] happy fire's broke that's all there is
[1:11:55] to it
[1:11:56] watch here in the paradox paragraph and
[1:11:57] the man said you know there's something
[1:11:59] about song
[1:12:00] that's got power in it he said we all
[1:12:02] know that we're aware of that he said
[1:12:05] look at the army when they would sing
[1:12:07] songs and play the music do you know
[1:12:10] that the approach to war in the army of
[1:12:13] god is first by music
[1:12:16] the singers went before the ark
[1:12:18] rejoicing and singing
[1:12:21] then come the ark then come the battle
[1:12:24] that's right so that's the right
[1:12:27] approach
[1:12:28] music first rejoice in singing
[1:12:31] ark then the battle that's the right
[1:12:34] approach
[1:12:34] that's exactly what we believe you
[1:12:36] taught
[1:12:37] amen let's let's pray together and ask
[1:12:39] him to help us can we heavenly father i
[1:12:42] so thank you lord jesus for this
[1:12:43] opportunity to be in your house again
[1:12:46] oh god i'm a poor sorry excuse of a
[1:12:49] preacher of any kind
[1:12:51] lord to try to bring something to help
[1:12:52] these people lord you know in my own
[1:12:54] abilities i i just don't have anything
[1:12:57] humanly that i could offer to these your
[1:12:59] children the purchase of your blood my
[1:13:02] lord god i would be a miserable person
[1:13:04] to try to put my ideas my way is out
[1:13:07] there before such blessed people so lord
[1:13:10] i'm praying that you'll come tonight and
[1:13:12] you'll take this little gift that you
[1:13:14] placed in me lord it's just a little
[1:13:16] insignificant piece lord it's a tiny
[1:13:18] part no doubt father but it is a part of
[1:13:21] you it's something from your divine
[1:13:24] nature that you place down inside of me
[1:13:26] that helps me get out of the way so that
[1:13:28] you can use this body this mouth these
[1:13:31] eyes and my mind and things to be able
[1:13:33] to speak to your children
[1:13:35] lord i'm sure many of them are standing
[1:13:37] here tonight very very needy i know many
[1:13:39] of them probably got needs in their life
[1:13:41] lord god i have needs as well don't
[1:13:43] forget me as well lord as i raise my
[1:13:46] hand to tonight ask you to help us to
[1:13:48] bless us and to give us your courage and
[1:13:50] your faith lord to approach your word
[1:13:52] lord knowing that every time we take the
[1:13:54] bible that the devil is going to come
[1:13:56] after us give us protection from thy
[1:13:58] spirit that we can gird ourselves with
[1:14:01] the armor of the living god and be ready
[1:14:03] for any fight that satan would take to
[1:14:05] us lord as we look over the word tonight
[1:14:07] we're asking that you would bless it
[1:14:09] that you would help every person in here
[1:14:11] to be receptive to everything that you
[1:14:14] would say to us tonight we are ready to
[1:14:17] hear from thy throne
[1:14:20] we're asking tonight that the holy
[1:14:21] spirit will take total control over all
[1:14:24] of this here tonight over me over them
[1:14:26] over every little part lord jesus and
[1:14:28] father the progressions of the service
[1:14:30] if you tarry from tonight tomorrow and
[1:14:33] sunday morning we're asking that you be
[1:14:35] mindful that you would help strengthen
[1:14:37] us once again in jesus name for thy
[1:14:39] service amen and amen
[1:14:42] god bless you you may be seated amen
[1:14:44] it's so good to be able to read the word
[1:14:46] of the lord and to say amen to the
[1:14:48] things of god amen
[1:14:50] now for just a little bit i'm going to
[1:14:52] i'm going to give you just a
[1:14:54] kind of a foundation
[1:14:56] as to where it is that i want to go
[1:14:58] on this about music now mind you that
[1:15:01] the
[1:15:02] elements of music as we could break them
[1:15:05] down
[1:15:05] are composed of scales and notes and
[1:15:08] scale tones and different types of
[1:15:11] musical qualities that people could
[1:15:14] break down and teach to others but what
[1:15:16] i'm talking about is more than just
[1:15:18] being able to teach a c scale or a g
[1:15:21] scale or something like that or being
[1:15:23] able to show someone on the piano how to
[1:15:25] run a certain chord or a chord
[1:15:27] progression but what i'm talking about
[1:15:29] is the effect that gospel music much
[1:15:33] less
[1:15:33] you know ungodly music for that matter
[1:15:36] that it has upon the human body and what
[1:15:38] it does to our spirit what it does to
[1:15:41] our soul
[1:15:42] now we know many times in reading what
[1:15:44] we've read here tonight that you'll hear
[1:15:46] people say well brother ben now i'm not
[1:15:48] too much on music when it comes to
[1:15:50] church i like to get to the word well
[1:15:53] unless i'm mistaken what we read here in
[1:15:55] ii chronicles 20 20-22
[1:15:58] that is the word am i wrong brother
[1:16:00] jesse i'm pretty sure that's the word
[1:16:02] so in other words what they're saying is
[1:16:04] they're saying then we want to skip the
[1:16:06] word to get to the word so by doing so
[1:16:09] they got it in their mind that this is
[1:16:11] not a part of the word but it is it's
[1:16:13] actually a significant part of our walk
[1:16:16] with god now i realize that in message
[1:16:19] churches and i'm using message churches
[1:16:21] because we are a message people that
[1:16:23] follow brother man's message and follow
[1:16:24] the minister william branham we know how
[1:16:26] brother branham established to us that
[1:16:28] uh church orders we say the order of the
[1:16:31] church and i i was talking to a brother
[1:16:33] just the other day who was relating to
[1:16:35] me that they was out on holiday
[1:16:37] somewhere in other news they were out
[1:16:39] they thought they would stop by a church
[1:16:40] and they went by a certain baptist
[1:16:42] church and
[1:16:43] some state somewhere i think someone in
[1:16:44] the south and as they went in there they
[1:16:47] said they accidentally got into the
[1:16:48] contemporary service thinking it was the
[1:16:50] traditional service and the contemporary
[1:16:52] service was a rock concert and they were
[1:16:54] singing rock and roll songs and wild
[1:16:56] guitars and all these type of things and
[1:16:58] they said well you know we looked around
[1:17:00] everybody's blue jeans and here we are
[1:17:01] in a certain time pretty dress and all
[1:17:03] that he said we realized he was in the
[1:17:05] wrong one but you see that's the way as
[1:17:08] i'll show you in a little bit that's the
[1:17:09] way the devil has worked is to get rock
[1:17:12] and roll in these evil things to blend
[1:17:14] it over and put it into the church of
[1:17:16] the living god because the devil knows
[1:17:19] the power and the
[1:17:21] the the uh the the backing and the
[1:17:24] substance and the uh how would you say
[1:17:26] the power even uh the authority that you
[1:17:29] could say that is behind
[1:17:31] behind a musical talent behind a musical
[1:17:33] gift and there is an ability in some of
[1:17:36] these worldly people out there we know
[1:17:38] that when we hear their songs and hear
[1:17:40] them singing in the restaurants and
[1:17:41] things there's a little bit of a pull
[1:17:43] there that kind of distracts you
[1:17:44] sometimes obviously backslidden you want
[1:17:47] to listen what they're saying but
[1:17:48] there's a little pull there why because
[1:17:50] there is a genuine gift of god down
[1:17:53] inside of those people but they're using
[1:17:55] it for the devil's glory and not for
[1:17:57] god's glory
[1:17:59] now you realize that a person that is
[1:18:01] gifted in the way of singing and music
[1:18:03] and so forth like that they have a
[1:18:05] special quality that god has given to
[1:18:07] them to be able to do things on the
[1:18:09] music and in the singing and such to be
[1:18:11] able to help the body of christ to
[1:18:13] become freer to become looser to give
[1:18:15] their bodies and their minds and all
[1:18:18] that a break as it were so that they can
[1:18:20] kind of enter up into this healing part
[1:18:23] of the way that music works on the human
[1:18:25] body now we realize that a person that
[1:18:28] truly understands the powers
[1:18:30] of music and understands the way that
[1:18:32] music is put together that music is more
[1:18:35] than just putting chords together and
[1:18:37] putting chord progressions together but
[1:18:39] it is actually entering into an
[1:18:41] anointing or a spirit or creating an
[1:18:44] atmosphere of what a person is listening
[1:18:46] to i'm sure many of you that come from
[1:18:48] the world whether john there myself
[1:18:50] brother uh brother jesse different ones
[1:18:52] of us that used to listen rock and roll
[1:18:54] and those type of things back in our
[1:18:56] center days i used to be want to be a
[1:18:58] rock and roll star myself
[1:18:59] you can imagine that i'm thankful god
[1:19:01] crushed that dream a long time ago as
[1:19:04] could you imagine me with my balling
[1:19:05] head in my potbelly out there with a
[1:19:07] guitar in my hand carried on like some
[1:19:09] of them guys i just wouldn't look good
[1:19:11] at it they wouldn't want it that way no
[1:19:13] how but i remember i used to listen to
[1:19:14] some of the things and the music would
[1:19:17] be so gripping that it wouldn't be so
[1:19:19] much that the tune as it were that i was
[1:19:21] hearing but it was the atmosphere that i
[1:19:23] would get into and as i was in a store
[1:19:26] early this morning and i heard him
[1:19:28] playing 50s type music over the radio i
[1:19:30] got to thinking about how that it was a
[1:19:32] happy sound and i thought well that's it
[1:19:34] the devil has absolutely offered such a
[1:19:37] uh uh such a devastation around the
[1:19:40] world of what is really a home life or a
[1:19:43] church life and he offers no hope to
[1:19:45] anybody and so in that music there's a
[1:19:47] little bit of a happiness there there's
[1:19:49] a little bit of release for them so that
[1:19:52] when they begin to hear that type of
[1:19:53] music they feel like they can just float
[1:19:56] their their cares and their troubles
[1:19:57] away all that's how that dirty old devil
[1:20:00] has impersonated and stolen from god
[1:20:03] actually do things that we are supposed
[1:20:05] to be using music for ourselves
[1:20:08] amen that's exactly right now watch here
[1:20:09] again in second converse 20 20. now just
[1:20:12] notice as they appointed singers unto
[1:20:15] the lord now once they appointed these
[1:20:17] singers that they should praise the
[1:20:19] beauty of holiness now i'm sure if
[1:20:21] you've studied the book of psalms you
[1:20:22] know that the book of psalms is broken
[1:20:24] into five parts and that david himself
[1:20:27] was the writer of about say 70
[1:20:30] of the psalms asap haman jebeth and the
[1:20:32] song of moses uh solomon had a part each
[1:20:35] one comprised together the book of
[1:20:37] psalms and they would take these certain
[1:20:40] categories of psalms and they would sing
[1:20:42] these songs and before the passover
[1:20:44] before certain parts of the feast and
[1:20:46] they would take these words and they
[1:20:48] would break them down in almost like a
[1:20:50] prophetic form and so as they would sing
[1:20:53] the man calls david a prophetic poet he
[1:20:56] calls it or a poetic prophet in one
[1:20:58] place he said and so he would break into
[1:21:00] these songs and sing things that had
[1:21:02] real substance to it now when you get
[1:21:04] time tonight or tomorrow or weekend
[1:21:06] sometime look at revelation chapter five
[1:21:08] and look how that when the song is being
[1:21:11] sang there when the lamb is taking the
[1:21:13] book look at the substance behind what
[1:21:15] is being said to him his power and honor
[1:21:18] and glory and all these things and why
[1:21:20] because they've got something to say in
[1:21:23] the songs that they are saying i'm gonna
[1:21:25] tell you something friends in the modern
[1:21:26] day we're living in a lot of our message
[1:21:28] songs are becoming more like a chat and
[1:21:30] they'll say jesus jesus jesus jesus
[1:21:32] jesus jesus jesus i thank god for that
[1:21:34] but i want to know a little bit more
[1:21:36] than just what his name is i want to
[1:21:38] know what kind of jesus is is he a jesus
[1:21:41] that he heals come on somebody is there
[1:21:44] jesus that saves and jesus that delivers
[1:21:46] well if he is then sing to me about what
[1:21:49] he is
[1:21:51] don't just spoke to me we're going to
[1:21:53] heaven we're going to heaven we're going
[1:21:54] to heaven we're going to heaven over and
[1:21:56] over again and just because it sounds
[1:21:57] pretty we think that's all right tell me
[1:21:59] how i'm supposed to get there if you're
[1:22:01] going to sing me a song and tell me how
[1:22:03] i'm supposed to get there i noticed a
[1:22:06] few moments ago when brother jesse was
[1:22:07] saying one of the verses and they came
[1:22:09] to that part about you must be born
[1:22:11] again boy that preacher to him he was
[1:22:13] just hammering away at that one spot but
[1:22:15] i thought that's exactly the way that a
[1:22:17] real gospel song should be orchestrated
[1:22:20] because when you're saying something you
[1:22:22] need to say brother i just come and beat
[1:22:24] around the bushes we say and maybe go
[1:22:26] another sideway down around it don't
[1:22:29] just quote to me jesus jesus and make it
[1:22:31] pretty music but tell me something
[1:22:33] that's going to encourage my soul to
[1:22:35] serve the
[1:22:36] lord amen exactly right now watch in
[1:22:40] verse 21 he appoints singers unto the
[1:22:42] lord
[1:22:43] that they should praise the beauty of
[1:22:45] holiness as they went out before the
[1:22:48] army to say praise the lord for
[1:22:51] his mercy endureth forever now watch as
[1:22:54] the the order of god is they move into
[1:22:57] verse 22 when they begin to sing and to
[1:23:00] praise now here's a point i want to
[1:23:02] bring up to you so that you're aware of
[1:23:03] this there is no place in the bible
[1:23:06] nowhere but what you will find singing
[1:23:09] music and worship directly connected
[1:23:12] together always remember that anytime
[1:23:15] you have music you have worship
[1:23:18] associated with music
[1:23:21] so for those people that say well i
[1:23:22] listen to music it has nothing to do
[1:23:24] with worship you are deceiving yourself
[1:23:27] every time you have music or singing
[1:23:29] worship is directly associated i wish
[1:23:32] somebody would help me preach because
[1:23:34] i'm telling you the truth you know i am
[1:23:36] it's absolutely directly connected
[1:23:38] together it even goes on the other side
[1:23:41] with satanic worship you notice that
[1:23:43] when thou shalt and all these different
[1:23:44] things was going on and the kingdom when
[1:23:46] daniel was alive oh my that when they
[1:23:48] were going to worship the image of
[1:23:50] daniel which we know that the prophet
[1:23:52] daniel was the image that they were
[1:23:53] going to worship when did they fall down
[1:23:55] to worship when the sultry and the
[1:23:58] sacred and all the different music was
[1:24:00] played that was their cue to begin to
[1:24:03] worship and oh and that is the way it
[1:24:05] should be right here tonight that when
[1:24:07] we hear the sister get on the piano and
[1:24:09] we hear people singing and clapping
[1:24:11] their hands and rejoicing in the lord
[1:24:13] when we hear the music playing that's
[1:24:16] our cue to know it's time for worship
[1:24:21] hallelujah oh my praise the lord a lot
[1:24:23] of times people hear the music that's
[1:24:25] their cue to go to sleep you know
[1:24:27] it's time to rest time to catch up on
[1:24:29] some of that sleep they've been missing
[1:24:30] through the week playing video games all
[1:24:32] week
[1:24:33] or watching television or netflix or
[1:24:35] something like that
[1:24:36] but when we hear the music it's our time
[1:24:38] to worship now notice let me read to you
[1:24:41] again just one more time notice brooklyn
[1:24:43] said there's something about song that
[1:24:45] has got power in it
[1:24:47] and he said do you know that the
[1:24:49] approach
[1:24:50] to war
[1:24:51] in the army of god was first
[1:24:54] by music
[1:24:56] so god so saw the power of music and
[1:25:00] singing and worship that he wanted that
[1:25:02] to be the prelude to the armies of god
[1:25:05] marching out with the word across their
[1:25:07] shoulder the levites
[1:25:09] it was such a powerful thing brother
[1:25:11] smith that if they did not have the
[1:25:14] music
[1:25:15] then the soldiers did not know
[1:25:18] how to prepare themselves to war
[1:25:21] you remember what paul said if the
[1:25:23] trumpet gives an uncertain sound well
[1:25:25] there had to be a certain sound that
[1:25:27] they had to hear and one of them certain
[1:25:29] sounds was was the sound of the singers
[1:25:32] going forth to praise amen the beauty of
[1:25:35] his holiness hallelujah once they heard
[1:25:38] them singers i'd be religious to my
[1:25:40] toenails once they heard them singers
[1:25:42] going out then the power of god would
[1:25:45] fall on the army and they would become
[1:25:47] so encouraged by what they were hearing
[1:25:50] i mean you think about the battle that
[1:25:52] the children of israel was up against
[1:25:54] many times they were outnumbered five to
[1:25:56] one they had men on horses on chariots
[1:25:59] all they had was a stick in their hand
[1:26:01] but yet when they would hear them
[1:26:02] singers pick up the song of moses about
[1:26:05] how god overcome pharaoh and the
[1:26:08] chariots are laying in the mud it says
[1:26:11] now that god is a god of war how their
[1:26:14] heart god shall deliver us i imagine an
[1:26:16] anointing fell on those men and women
[1:26:19] that they could stand there and hear the
[1:26:20] armies of god marching board
[1:26:23] in the name of great jehovah god
[1:26:26] it encouraged them
[1:26:29] it encouraged them so much
[1:26:31] that god said if you'll start worshiping
[1:26:33] praising
[1:26:34] i'll come down and i'll get in the
[1:26:36] middle of your worship in praise
[1:26:38] i inhabit your praise if you create a
[1:26:42] room for me i will dwell in that room
[1:26:45] amen
[1:26:47] i want you to think as the people would
[1:26:50] begin to worship and to praise
[1:26:53] god would come down and inhabit their
[1:26:55] praise doing what creating a perimeter
[1:26:58] around the armies
[1:27:00] so everyone that was worshiping the holy
[1:27:02] ghost was creating a divine perimeter
[1:27:05] around those harmonies
[1:27:07] oh thank you lord jesus and he was
[1:27:10] surrounding them in the beauty of his
[1:27:12] holiness so actually before them armies
[1:27:15] ever met one soldier they met the holy
[1:27:18] ghost before they met the soldiers
[1:27:22] because he inhabited their praise
[1:27:25] oh my
[1:27:26] oh my goodness says that's the right
[1:27:29] approach
[1:27:30] that's the right approach you understand
[1:27:32] it must come by music first well let's
[1:27:35] get to the word this is the word
[1:27:38] this is the word
[1:27:40] you can't skip the word to get to the
[1:27:42] word this is the word
[1:27:46] i wonder friends i've said this many
[1:27:47] places but i'm sitting in here tonight i
[1:27:50] wonder when brethren said eve just just
[1:27:52] she just dogged off one eye one little
[1:27:54] eye the wrong way she crossed the t when
[1:27:56] she should have dotted an eye it was
[1:27:58] just one little thing you know laying
[1:28:00] out there that she missed one little
[1:28:01] word that she listened to from the devil
[1:28:03] that god had crossed up i wonder how
[1:28:05] many people in the message ain't gonna
[1:28:07] make the rapture because they hate this
[1:28:08] part right here
[1:28:10] praise worship and sing it they hate it
[1:28:12] they don't want you screaming they don't
[1:28:14] want you shouting they don't want you
[1:28:16] glorifying god they don't want you
[1:28:17] raised in your hands they don't want you
[1:28:19] saying praise the lord
[1:28:24] hello
[1:28:25] they don't want you saying hey man glory
[1:28:28] to god they don't want you getting in
[1:28:30] the spirit
[1:28:31] they say jump to the word so they're
[1:28:33] going to miss the word to get to the
[1:28:35] word there
[1:28:36] i wonder i wonder how god is going to
[1:28:38] look on when they skip that part of the
[1:28:41] message to get to this part of the
[1:28:42] message that's why john was told the
[1:28:44] whole book amen
[1:28:47] hello
[1:28:48] don't just see what parts you like you
[1:28:50] know
[1:28:53] that's somebody said one time well i'm
[1:28:54] not much of a music person i said that
[1:28:56] you ain't much of a god person
[1:28:59] because god likes music
[1:29:01] where do you think it comes from
[1:29:03] now you hear people say about the devil
[1:29:05] well you know the devil i heard people
[1:29:07] saving the message now satan was you
[1:29:09] know he was the the man over music i
[1:29:12] said somebody please show me one quote
[1:29:14] or one scripture that said satan was a
[1:29:16] song leader
[1:29:18] satan was more than a song leader he was
[1:29:21] the right hand man to god the right hand
[1:29:23] man's a fellowship he was more than a
[1:29:25] song leader
[1:29:28] praise the lord
[1:29:30] but you say well he was old now he was
[1:29:31] the right hand of god
[1:29:33] in other words what god wanted done he
[1:29:36] done it and you realize that because he
[1:29:38] was an angel an angel was created for
[1:29:41] basically two purposes they were created
[1:29:43] to worship and for service
[1:29:46] so the devil had a master understanding
[1:29:49] of what worship was all about including
[1:29:52] singing and music
[1:29:53] so that's more than just a local song
[1:29:55] leader
[1:29:56] he was more than just a local song they
[1:29:58] didn't decide oh maybe i'll i'll just
[1:30:00] you know maybe i'll sing a few
[1:30:01] contemporary songs and some godly ones
[1:30:03] it was more than that they make the
[1:30:05] devil out to be just kind of a little
[1:30:07] little small something up there but
[1:30:09] listen brother the reason the devil can
[1:30:11] manipulate worship in things is because
[1:30:13] he was created the highest being next to
[1:30:16] god everything god was except for
[1:30:18] created
[1:30:20] he was more than a song leader he was
[1:30:22] somebody that knew how everything worked
[1:30:26] the only thing he couldn't figure out
[1:30:27] was creation because god didn't give it
[1:30:29] to him
[1:30:32] folks you know that's the one that makes
[1:30:33] the devil so mad about you and i we know
[1:30:34] how creation works he don't
[1:30:37] ours comes by spoken word we've got what
[1:30:39] he's wanted all these years
[1:30:41] we've had somebody we've got what he's
[1:30:44] always wanted
[1:30:45] no wonder he hates us so much
[1:30:49] oh my that's the right approach so the
[1:30:52] devil brings it down from heaven
[1:30:53] remember they don't lose any of their
[1:30:55] power authority or ability so they bring
[1:30:57] it down from heaven down to the earth
[1:30:59] now what does the devil do the very
[1:31:01] first thing he does is he anoints the
[1:31:03] serpent and the serpent goes to working
[1:31:05] on what eve's area of worship
[1:31:09] you know you could be a god eve well why
[1:31:12] would he want to make her an object to
[1:31:13] worship when she already had an object
[1:31:15] of worship
[1:31:16] you see what he was doing manipulating
[1:31:19] her object of worship trying to bring it
[1:31:21] upon where herself
[1:31:24] and where are most of the songs focused
[1:31:26] on today themselves
[1:31:29] hey the days of people uh uh a safe
[1:31:31] worshiping type of uh acid rocky you
[1:31:34] know what i'm talking about these things
[1:31:36] got the devil horn you don't see much of
[1:31:37] that anymore but what you see now is
[1:31:39] people worshiping themselves i am the
[1:31:41] great i've done this
[1:31:47] why the devil's keeping his promise
[1:31:50] he's making him a god
[1:31:52] that's exactly what he promised them and
[1:31:54] that's what he's trying to fulfill
[1:31:56] because by giving them what they want he
[1:31:58] knows he can get what he wants
[1:32:00] now i'm a funny guy brother jesse i'm a
[1:32:03] little strange sometimes to people in
[1:32:05] the message because
[1:32:06] i just believe the elected can't be
[1:32:08] deceived
[1:32:09] and as a preacher i just happen to
[1:32:11] believe that if i study something i
[1:32:13] believe the holy ghost will protect me
[1:32:15] so hear about oh i don't know back in
[1:32:17] december when i was in africa i got out
[1:32:19] there and i said lord
[1:32:21] if you'll help me
[1:32:22] i want to do my very best to study my
[1:32:25] enemy better and i got to thinking and i
[1:32:27] study on this music of things and i got
[1:32:29] to thinking i've never studied satanism
[1:32:32] and i thought i'm going to go get the
[1:32:34] satanic bible you can get electronically
[1:32:36] and different things like that and i'm
[1:32:37] going to study what they believe because
[1:32:39] i want to know
[1:32:40] what they teach i was absolutely turned
[1:32:42] upside down when i got to reading what
[1:32:44] the real belief behind satanism is
[1:32:47] now mind you as a preacher i don't
[1:32:49] encourage or endorse anybody go do this
[1:32:51] i'm talking about as a preacher you
[1:32:53] study facts but believe me let me give
[1:32:55] you the essence of it just take all the
[1:32:56] curiosity out of it the bottom line is
[1:32:59] that satanism they say that there's two
[1:33:01] important holidays that every satan
[1:33:04] worshiper every satanist they call them
[1:33:06] should observe number one is the most
[1:33:09] and number two
[1:33:10] is the next under that number one i'm
[1:33:13] saying it that way because i want to
[1:33:14] give you a little test what do you think
[1:33:15] their number one holiday is
[1:33:18] somebody gonna say halloween because
[1:33:20] that's probably what you're expecting
[1:33:21] done that way that's number two you know
[1:33:24] what their number one most important
[1:33:25] holiday is you're on birthday why
[1:33:28] because the teaching is there is nobody
[1:33:31] greater or higher
[1:33:32] than yourself
[1:33:35] do you realize they don't even actually
[1:33:36] believe in the devil
[1:33:37] they believe that it is an inherent evil
[1:33:39] inside of everybody that if you are a
[1:33:42] true satanist you yield to the good of
[1:33:45] yourself and the evil of yourself so
[1:33:47] what is their main belief you are the
[1:33:49] most important thing put on planet earth
[1:33:51] that is the exact opposite of what god
[1:33:54] has said he said if any man shall follow
[1:33:57] me let him deny
[1:33:59] himself
[1:34:02] i want to make a statement everybody
[1:34:04] hang on do you realize when you see
[1:34:06] people around the rings that consider
[1:34:08] their opinions their beliefs their
[1:34:10] feelings their whatever they are to be
[1:34:12] more important than anybody else do you
[1:34:14] realize that person is actually a closet
[1:34:17] satanist
[1:34:22] amen now you don't know what to do
[1:34:24] still the same truth i'm preaching to
[1:34:26] you that's what i'm talking about the
[1:34:27] devil tried to make human beings to make
[1:34:31] them the very object of everybody's
[1:34:33] worship take some girl out there she's
[1:34:35] got a figure got a face or something
[1:34:37] like that what she wants somebody to
[1:34:39] worship her is the next title some man
[1:34:41] he's got a voice who's got a certain
[1:34:43] athletic ability they want everybody who
[1:34:45] wants to put his autograph down why it's
[1:34:47] worse it's worse that's why i don't go
[1:34:50] along with all these sportings and
[1:34:51] things like that because that's worship
[1:34:53] that people are doing too many of these
[1:34:55] athletes and people out there in the
[1:34:56] world they worship these guys they put
[1:34:59] their ball gaps on they put their
[1:35:01] posters up in the room do they have
[1:35:02] posters of jesus no they've got posters
[1:35:04] of michael jordan or somebody like that
[1:35:06] and what they worship their image that
[1:35:08] they set before them it's what they
[1:35:10] worship but now the devil is changing
[1:35:12] the focus and he's making you the most
[1:35:15] important thing
[1:35:17] well it's only appropriate because in
[1:35:19] the day of lydiocell or people's rights
[1:35:23] who else is more important than you
[1:35:26] so if you're a homosexual then you're
[1:35:28] important because you're homosexual
[1:35:30] don't touch your homosexuality because
[1:35:32] hey i'm an important person
[1:35:35] don't tell me that god's going to judge
[1:35:37] me because i am an important person
[1:35:39] jesus said if you want to follow me deny
[1:35:42] who you are
[1:35:44] hey somebody started a debate some time
[1:35:46] ago about oh you know how are they born
[1:35:48] that way or whatever i said look you
[1:35:50] guys believe whatever you want to
[1:35:52] believe but i'm going to go to the next
[1:35:53] step of the question the next step is or
[1:35:56] you say i'm born that way okay my next
[1:35:58] question is then can you deny how you
[1:36:00] were born
[1:36:02] hello somebody oh they said my mama made
[1:36:05] me this way my daddy made me this way
[1:36:07] all right my next question is how can
[1:36:09] you deny the way mama raised you can you
[1:36:12] because jesus said if you can't deny
[1:36:14] yourself then you can't be a follower of
[1:36:16] him oh you know my grandpa made me this
[1:36:19] way or my great great great great great
[1:36:21] was an alcoholic so that's why i pretend
[1:36:24] you deny yourself the fire of the lord
[1:36:27] jesus as if you can't deny yourself
[1:36:29] you'll never receive christ
[1:36:34] the real key to being the christians let
[1:36:36] go and let god amen
[1:36:39] you got a better idea than god that you
[1:36:40] ain't saved amen
[1:36:44] hello
[1:36:45] if you've got better ideas in the holy
[1:36:47] ghost you ain't even got to holy ghost
[1:36:49] as a person is born again they ain't got
[1:36:51] no coming to this word of god they
[1:36:53] want what he says what he says
[1:36:56] the days of i think i feel i think i
[1:36:59] feel that ignorance is going over to
[1:37:01] people around this rank or either your
[1:37:02] preacher tell them something i think i
[1:37:04] feel i believe but listen if god said it
[1:37:07] it doesn't matter what you think or what
[1:37:09] i think if the word says that the
[1:37:11] promises of god are what gay and amen
[1:37:18] but what's most of our music focused on
[1:37:20] now
[1:37:21] the person
[1:37:22] all of your bubble gum pop artists out
[1:37:24] there brittany and christine aguilera
[1:37:26] and all these and all these girls out
[1:37:27] there listen the song says say
[1:37:30] i'm this and i'm that hey come on y'all
[1:37:32] don't live in a cave you're out in the
[1:37:33] world like i am you hear these songs and
[1:37:35] restaurants and bus stations everywhere
[1:37:37] else they're saying everything they say
[1:37:39] is about them
[1:37:40] about them about what they go through
[1:37:43] about their life why do i want to hear
[1:37:46] about all the things they've done in
[1:37:47] their life in a song
[1:37:49] i don't care how many times they've
[1:37:50] committed adultery that's between them
[1:37:52] and the lord
[1:37:56] praise the lord
[1:37:58] but the focus is upon themselves all
[1:38:00] right now you say but i listen and love
[1:38:02] songs by the bib that's about the worst
[1:38:04] of all of them
[1:38:06] which one's the worst focus and the one
[1:38:08] the satan song is shoving the devil down
[1:38:10] your throat or the song that don't
[1:38:12] mention nothing about jesus the blood
[1:38:13] calvary redemption or nothing what about
[1:38:15] the song that ignores him all together
[1:38:17] is that batman that's a bad one
[1:38:20] ignores them all together
[1:38:22] it's whitney houston singing i'll always
[1:38:24] love you she don't even put a name with
[1:38:25] it you know why because there's 15 years
[1:38:27] ago in that song
[1:38:28] she gets rid of jim she'll get job once
[1:38:30] she gets done with john she'll get with
[1:38:32] this one get with that one get the other
[1:38:33] and they can sing the same song for
[1:38:35] every letter that they pick up
[1:38:37] come on don't look at me like a bunch of
[1:38:38] peace you know what i'm talking about
[1:38:40] why because the holy spirit is trying to
[1:38:43] show us brother that the devil is slick
[1:38:46] in every way you turn around that's why
[1:38:48] we got to be careful what kind of music
[1:38:50] we listen to
[1:38:51] [Applause]
[1:38:54] i know you're going to think i'm crazy
[1:38:55] on this but i'd rather have a song shut
[1:38:57] the devil down my throat than one that
[1:38:59] doesn't that ignores jesus altogether
[1:39:02] because at least if i hear about a devil
[1:39:03] i might be able to hear about god
[1:39:07] huh but some of these other songs don't
[1:39:09] even mention it
[1:39:10] they
[1:39:20] exactly right
[1:39:22] oh my now notice let me take for just a
[1:39:24] few moments
[1:39:26] the uh the scientific part of this now i
[1:39:29] know this may
[1:39:30] i'm not going to get terribly deep with
[1:39:32] this but just to give you the highlights
[1:39:33] of what science says
[1:39:35] that music does to us now mind you
[1:39:37] there's a lot that i can tell you in
[1:39:38] this but i'm just going to try to hit
[1:39:40] the highlights and then we'll go home
[1:39:42] after a while notice science as they
[1:39:45] begin to define music
[1:39:48] they realize that the approach
[1:39:50] that the the approach of musicians and
[1:39:53] things as they put a song out there that
[1:39:56] it has the way they play the beats the
[1:39:58] rhythms the way they uh frame the song
[1:40:01] it has a direct effect upon you
[1:40:03] now we realize and i always get this
[1:40:05] wrong but if it's the left side of the
[1:40:07] brain i'm pretty sure that uh figures
[1:40:09] two plus two equals four and four and
[1:40:11] four is eight and all that then the
[1:40:13] right side is your creative part that's
[1:40:15] the part that absorbs music now the left
[1:40:18] side that comprehends and calculates and
[1:40:20] figures this is so tall that's so uh
[1:40:23] along and so forth that's this part of
[1:40:25] your brain here but now the right side
[1:40:28] of your brain is the part that takes in
[1:40:30] music now this is what science says
[1:40:32] science says that music drops him to
[1:40:35] this right side of your brain and as it
[1:40:38] drops into this right side of your brain
[1:40:40] it directly feeds into your subconscious
[1:40:43] without any conscious thought going into
[1:40:46] the process whatsoever so in other words
[1:40:48] if you've been sitting there at a
[1:40:49] restaurant and before you even know that
[1:40:51] you hear a song playing overhead before
[1:40:53] you even know it you're kind of doing
[1:40:54] this number like that you're like oh
[1:40:55] good lord i backslid no you haven't
[1:40:57] maxed it but what has happened is that
[1:40:59] music has moved into that right side of
[1:41:02] the brain it has dropped into your
[1:41:04] subconscious and your body is reacting
[1:41:07] to that beat of that music and it
[1:41:09] bypassed this left side of thought
[1:41:11] altogether that's the reason why that
[1:41:14] you didn't think too much about it it
[1:41:15] was happening before you do it that's
[1:41:18] god's design for the power of music to
[1:41:21] get itself into your life i want you to
[1:41:23] pay attention to this because this is
[1:41:25] the way that if we could use music to
[1:41:27] the right ability then we would realize
[1:41:29] that music is not something that we're
[1:41:31] supposed to be sitting there thinking
[1:41:33] about when a brother is singing i am
[1:41:34] bound for the promised land many times
[1:41:37] people steal away the blessings of that
[1:41:39] song because they're sitting there
[1:41:41] trying to figure it out they're working
[1:41:43] from the left side of the brain well if
[1:41:45] i'm bound for the promised land what is
[1:41:46] the promised land and how big is the
[1:41:48] promised land am i going to the promised
[1:41:50] land or how about you i know you ain't
[1:41:52] going to the promised land and that
[1:41:54] one's definitely on the promised land
[1:41:56] and before you even got halfway through
[1:41:58] the song you've done till the effects of
[1:42:00] the way the music is supposed to react
[1:42:02] into your body and you realize that when
[1:42:05] the music hits the right side of your
[1:42:07] brain it literally shifts your mind over
[1:42:10] and shuts off the left side
[1:42:13] so you can't really think
[1:42:15] and be creative at the same time
[1:42:18] so in other words if you're going to
[1:42:19] listen to a song you can't pull it to
[1:42:22] pieces while you're listening to it
[1:42:25] well for all you intellectual saints in
[1:42:27] here hold on real tight tonight okay
[1:42:30] you cannot figure it out now why is that
[1:42:33] the way that is that i was thinking
[1:42:34] about this song lord of god why you was
[1:42:37] singing it did you get the blessing out
[1:42:38] of it well no because i see busy
[1:42:39] thinking about it
[1:42:41] there you go
[1:42:42] that's the reason they don't get the
[1:42:43] blessing because they're thinking so
[1:42:45] much about words and all this that they
[1:42:48] don't let the music do the job that it's
[1:42:50] supposed to do
[1:42:52] which is what give your brain
[1:42:54] a break
[1:42:58] if it shuts off this left side like
[1:43:00] turning the faucet you don't talk about
[1:43:04] and it shuts it off where you cannot
[1:43:06] think
[1:43:07] the ability to be able to shut that part
[1:43:10] of your mind off gives you a little bit
[1:43:12] of a rest i want you to think about
[1:43:14] something if your brain
[1:43:16] is connected to everything in you
[1:43:19] your liver your kidneys your pancreas
[1:43:22] your heart your lungs your nerves
[1:43:25] cells
[1:43:27] corpuscles everything
[1:43:29] feet toes legs arms
[1:43:32] everything in you is connected to your
[1:43:34] brain
[1:43:36] so if your brain is stressed what do you
[1:43:38] think that does to the rest of you
[1:43:42] if your mind is overworked
[1:43:44] what do you think that does to the rest
[1:43:46] of you
[1:43:46] it overworks everything in you
[1:43:50] hello
[1:43:51] if your mind is stretched will you say
[1:43:53] brother ben i am a deep thinking person
[1:43:56] well i'm glad you come to church tonight
[1:43:58] because i'm going to show you how to
[1:44:00] quit doing it
[1:44:03] at least for portions of the day
[1:44:05] now notice again they said here in an
[1:44:07] article in september 2013 that music has
[1:44:10] an effect uh a unique effect on the
[1:44:13] brain says that because that they cannot
[1:44:16] really define what music is
[1:44:18] it's something that they don't really
[1:44:20] understand but they said it has a
[1:44:21] definite effect upon learning upon
[1:44:24] memory emotion and even spirituality
[1:44:27] they said that because the brain is it
[1:44:29] has wide circuits in it that brings a
[1:44:32] strong what they call neuroplasticity
[1:44:35] that is effect and this ability to learn
[1:44:37] is increased exponentially whenever the
[1:44:40] music is played along with something
[1:44:43] they're doing you know from being school
[1:44:44] teachers you and sam that when you go
[1:44:46] into a place and you're trying to teach
[1:44:48] the kids some sort of mathematical fact
[1:44:50] or some kind of a deal like that uh same
[1:44:52] or familiar you use a little musical
[1:44:54] something to try to get it down why they
[1:44:56] can learn better with a musical thought
[1:44:59] because music actually opens up channels
[1:45:02] of the mind that are not opened up
[1:45:04] without it so they can actually have
[1:45:06] more of their brain used when they use
[1:45:09] music a more creative part that actually
[1:45:12] drives the learning down into their
[1:45:14] subconscious if it ever gets into your
[1:45:16] subconscious it sticks there
[1:45:20] that's what they call long-term memory
[1:45:22] science calls it long-term we call it
[1:45:24] your subconscious
[1:45:26] it's been etched into the long-term part
[1:45:28] of your subconscious that's why some of
[1:45:30] y'all right now if i quoted you the
[1:45:32] first three lines of some of the rock
[1:45:33] songs you listened to you could tell me
[1:45:35] what tune it is if i played just a few
[1:45:37] bars of it
[1:45:38] why that went down into that little
[1:45:40] recorder of yours called your
[1:45:41] subconscious and it's been laying down
[1:45:43] and i can play you a few bars and
[1:45:45] michael jackson beat it and you tell me
[1:45:47] who it was what date it was played on
[1:45:49] all of that why all of that's dropped
[1:45:51] into your subconscious well if we can do
[1:45:53] that with the worldly side what about
[1:45:55] the things of god what about the things
[1:45:59] of god could not the word be done the
[1:46:01] same exact way
[1:46:04] oh my
[1:46:05] oh hallelujah to the lamb of god notice
[1:46:08] again the strong effects
[1:46:11] from music they say could drive soldiers
[1:46:13] into war
[1:46:15] brother burley williams was showing a
[1:46:16] clip back at our church some time ago i
[1:46:18] don't know maybe brothers have seen it i
[1:46:21] got off youtube or one of these things
[1:46:23] about a testimonial from a tank soldier
[1:46:26] a tank battalion uh leader one of these
[1:46:28] battalions was talking about that when
[1:46:30] he would go into this uh this this war
[1:46:32] type of ironman or iraq or whatever they
[1:46:34] might have been it said that as they
[1:46:36] would go in there they would play a
[1:46:37] certain type of music and they played
[1:46:39] just a few bars of it it was uh marilyn
[1:46:42] manson's the bodies hit the floor or
[1:46:44] something like that but the bodies hit
[1:46:45] the floor some of that nature and they
[1:46:47] just repeat the words over and over
[1:46:49] again that the bodies hit the floor the
[1:46:51] bodies hit the floor over and over again
[1:46:53] so this young man would play this and he
[1:46:55] said his own words he said i actually
[1:46:57] became anointed to kill i became
[1:47:00] anointed to kill and once i started
[1:47:02] killing and destroyed with that music
[1:47:04] playing i could not stop it was only
[1:47:06] until after i shut it off that it was
[1:47:08] kind of something would lift off of
[1:47:10] yourself and then it wouldn't feel like
[1:47:11] you couldn't stop and why is that
[1:47:13] because that music would drive right
[1:47:15] directly into the subconscious and it
[1:47:18] responded out of the body the body was
[1:47:21] responding to that music now remember
[1:47:23] they also tell us that when a person is
[1:47:26] listening in music that music has the
[1:47:28] power listen close to be able to change
[1:47:31] your intentions
[1:47:35] so somebody could be sitting there
[1:47:36] listening to godly music they could love
[1:47:38] their mom and dad they're always
[1:47:39] respectful coming to church and so forth
[1:47:41] sit on the front row and what more
[1:47:43] always participate all of a sudden
[1:47:45] something changes they become rebellious
[1:47:48] they become hard-hitted they become
[1:47:49] disrespectful start missing church if
[1:47:51] they're in church or not paying
[1:47:52] attention on and on i guarantee you if
[1:47:54] you go look in that person's music deck
[1:47:57] if they've even got decks anymore or
[1:47:59] their ipod or whatever they got you'd
[1:48:01] find out that someone another they got a
[1:48:03] hold of some music that has changed
[1:48:05] their intention a lot of times is what
[1:48:07] happens because the songs are working on
[1:48:10] the biblical principle remember the
[1:48:12] bible said in isaiah that it should be
[1:48:14] lined up online precept on precept here
[1:48:17] a little there a little line online
[1:48:20] preset precept here little there look in
[1:48:22] other words repeat repeat repeat repeat
[1:48:26] repeat repeat so the more you say it the
[1:48:29] more you get it remember the book of
[1:48:31] james when he said he looks into the
[1:48:32] mirror and he forgets who he was but the
[1:48:35] more that he looks into the mirror the
[1:48:37] more he remembers what he is
[1:48:39] so you understand the music then that
[1:48:42] we're hearing in the world is actually
[1:48:44] shaping and forging the intentions of
[1:48:47] humanity
[1:48:48] they talked about these boys in
[1:48:50] columbine
[1:48:51] and they still cannot figure out to this
[1:48:53] day what made them boys change and do
[1:48:55] like they did there was an article that
[1:48:57] was given just the other day where the
[1:49:00] one of the young boys
[1:49:02] mothers was interviewed i think my uh oh
[1:49:05] diane somebody another sawyer one of
[1:49:06] them out there and they had a little
[1:49:08] article set down where they would say
[1:49:10] you know certain certain interviews
[1:49:12] gonna take place such and such so i
[1:49:14] found it on the internet i was
[1:49:15] interested i want to listen to this
[1:49:16] young woman and hear what she had to say
[1:49:18] about her son and throughout the
[1:49:19] interview that asked her questions did
[1:49:21] you see signs did you notice certain
[1:49:23] behaviors uh did things change and
[1:49:26] through the majority of the interviews
[1:49:27] she said we thought everything was fine
[1:49:29] we thought it was just normal teenage
[1:49:31] life we had no idea that these things
[1:49:33] were hiding when they began to discover
[1:49:35] that certain things were happening there
[1:49:36] was a little worried but not too worried
[1:49:40] now they found that later on
[1:49:42] a baptist minister from some place
[1:49:44] begins studying as it were this this
[1:49:47] particular setup of these boys
[1:49:50] and you know there's been a lot of
[1:49:52] questions as to why they've done what
[1:49:54] they've done well one day they found an
[1:49:56] article or another article but a um an
[1:49:58] interview where they have the boys
[1:50:00] standing there talking to somebody from
[1:50:02] the school one of them dylan or whatever
[1:50:03] the other guy's name was and they would
[1:50:05] take him they would hold him there
[1:50:06] before the camera and give him a little
[1:50:08] interview they walk on to the next
[1:50:10] person and it was just enough that they
[1:50:12] could see the boy's t-shirt and what was
[1:50:15] read on the t-shirt
[1:50:17] and one of this baptist preacher he
[1:50:19] honed in on the name of the band that
[1:50:21] was on his shirt and it was a german
[1:50:24] death metal man
[1:50:25] and in one of their songs they tracked
[1:50:27] this down they found out that the boys
[1:50:29] would listen to certain type of music
[1:50:31] and they found this was one of their
[1:50:33] number one groups that they listened to
[1:50:35] over and over again and one of the main
[1:50:38] songs that this german group would say
[1:50:40] they would sing it in english they would
[1:50:41] sing it in german they would sing it in
[1:50:43] different ways but the essence of the
[1:50:45] song over and over again was go to the
[1:50:48] schoolyard get the gun and kill the boy
[1:50:51] over and over and over again go to the
[1:50:54] schoolyard get the gun and kill the
[1:50:56] bullet now they may have been looking
[1:50:58] for some kind of parental problem and i
[1:51:00] don't doubt that mom and dad should have
[1:51:01] been more aware of what kind of music
[1:51:03] they were listening to but they did not
[1:51:05] realize the reason that them boys had
[1:51:08] the courage to do the thing that they
[1:51:10] were doing is because as brother madam
[1:51:12] said music gives courage and it was
[1:51:15] giving them courage to go in and do the
[1:51:17] thing that the song was telling them to
[1:51:19] do
[1:51:22] if it can do that for two boys going
[1:51:24] into a schoolyard and assaulting as many
[1:51:26] people as they can assault and kill what
[1:51:28] could that do for you and i when we get
[1:51:30] discouraged
[1:51:31] i need a little pick me up i need some
[1:51:34] time to give our brain a break come on
[1:51:36] somebody
[1:51:37] i guarantee you can change your
[1:51:39] injection as well because you may be at
[1:51:41] the spot i don't think i'll serve the
[1:51:43] lord anymore i think i'll give up i
[1:51:45] think i'll quit
[1:51:46] and you go to listen to one of them
[1:51:48] gospel songs and after a few minutes you
[1:51:50] go to thinking well that is so bad after
[1:51:52] all
[1:51:54] wow
[1:51:55] this is pretty good i think i'll keep
[1:51:57] serving the lord
[1:52:00] why that song has entered into your
[1:52:03] subconscious and it has changed your
[1:52:05] intentions
[1:52:07] oh glory to god praise the lord are you
[1:52:11] hanging on pretty good
[1:52:13] all right now watch us now now they said
[1:52:17] that group singing
[1:52:19] actually produces a higher measure
[1:52:22] of general health and quality of life in
[1:52:25] the elderly they notice in an
[1:52:27] observation that cancer survivors and
[1:52:29] caretakers of ill people and so forth
[1:52:32] that that music and group singing would
[1:52:34] increase their health and their ability
[1:52:37] to be healthy and watch this i love this
[1:52:39] music training in the elderly would help
[1:52:42] avoid memory loss
[1:52:46] music therapies rhythm therapies along
[1:52:49] with electoral stimulation
[1:52:51] improved aphasia and stroke victims
[1:52:54] musical training would aid with dyslexia
[1:52:58] teaching someone how to learn a musical
[1:53:00] instrument help dyslexia
[1:53:03] parkinson's patients use rhythm in
[1:53:05] physical therapy to improve their date
[1:53:08] or how they their span of walking
[1:53:10] notice in babies interactive song
[1:53:12] learning increased smiling waving
[1:53:15] communicating and understanding pitch
[1:53:18] even dogs and shelters now listen to
[1:53:20] this even dogs and shelters bark less
[1:53:24] and slept better when they played
[1:53:26] classical music
[1:53:28] and mice with heart transplants they
[1:53:31] survived twice as long when they
[1:53:32] listened to classical music as they did
[1:53:35] this other stuff
[1:53:38] now you think the devil didn't know what
[1:53:40] he was doing
[1:53:41] want to begin manipulating music
[1:53:43] because he knows that music has an
[1:53:45] effect upon you
[1:53:47] if it has an effect upon your body he
[1:53:49] can actually steal your health away
[1:53:52] while you're listening to the wrong kind
[1:53:53] of music
[1:53:55] but if you're listening
[1:53:56] to music no wonder the prophet said god
[1:53:59] heals by music
[1:54:02] amen
[1:54:03] amen he heals in a whole lot more ways
[1:54:05] than just full and instant healing like
[1:54:07] that healing's not that way no how it's
[1:54:09] a process of time how much healing and
[1:54:12] diseases would lead people's bodies and
[1:54:14] so forth and they would give their brain
[1:54:16] a break about say 30 minutes every
[1:54:18] single day
[1:54:23] let's turn out the first chronicles
[1:54:24] chapter 15 verse 14. let's go down
[1:54:27] through 14 through
[1:54:28] 16 there
[1:54:30] let's look just a little bit more at the
[1:54:31] way that this is put together
[1:54:34] my my mind
[1:54:36] well if music and good music made people
[1:54:38] smile and wave and communicate better i
[1:54:40] said we need a few longer song services
[1:54:42] and a message
[1:54:46] and somebody else cause i can't tell you
[1:54:49] one thing people don't know how to smile
[1:54:50] much less communicate in the message to
[1:54:52] the out
[1:54:53] some people don't but a lot of them
[1:54:54] don't
[1:54:56] watch now in first chronicles 15 look at
[1:54:58] verse 14 so the priests and the levites
[1:55:00] sanctified themselves to bring up the
[1:55:03] ark of the lord god of israel the
[1:55:05] children of the levites bear the ark of
[1:55:07] god upon their shoulders with the stabs
[1:55:10] thereon
[1:55:11] as moses commanded according to the word
[1:55:13] of the lord
[1:55:15] and david spake
[1:55:16] to the chief of the levites to appoint
[1:55:18] their brethren
[1:55:20] to be the singers
[1:55:22] with instruments of music
[1:55:24] oh my
[1:55:26] give me to tell me god would allow this
[1:55:28] man
[1:55:29] to go and appoint singers and
[1:55:30] instruments of music
[1:55:32] well surely he'd go look up the biggest
[1:55:34] evangelists in the country
[1:55:36] surely he finally pastors got the
[1:55:38] biggest church brother smith
[1:55:39] charlotte is looking for somebody to
[1:55:41] help him out they want the greatest
[1:55:43] apostle that's ever walked shoe leather
[1:55:45] but singers
[1:55:47] with music
[1:55:49] but it's not important so you want to
[1:55:51] skip the word to get to the word there
[1:55:56] now i ask you
[1:55:57] is it the word
[1:55:59] are we reading the word
[1:56:00] as i check these scriptures being read
[1:56:02] out of your bible amen praise the lord
[1:56:04] somebody and the bible is the word
[1:56:09] amen amen right that's where it's coming
[1:56:11] from it's from the word
[1:56:13] now watch instruments of music sultries
[1:56:16] and hearts oh
[1:56:18] praise god that's how i like it
[1:56:20] you say brother ben that's salty that
[1:56:22] heart
[1:56:26] nice and quiet
[1:56:29] until mr symbol shows up
[1:56:34] oh
[1:56:35] yes
[1:56:36] but you say that it's got to be a quiet
[1:56:39] easy thing
[1:56:41] sometimes it needs to be loud
[1:56:48] oh glory to god
[1:56:50] i don't believe in creating scandals on
[1:56:52] facebook but i believe i'd almost take a
[1:56:54] picture of y'all's faces and put it on
[1:56:55] there tonight
[1:56:58] you said brother ben that's ridiculous
[1:56:59] know what hey now once they say that
[1:57:01] when a person is actually meditating
[1:57:04] that when they have soft easy going
[1:57:07] music in the background good music now
[1:57:09] that it actually increases their ability
[1:57:12] to meditate on on what's been said or
[1:57:14] what's been read now you watch brother
[1:57:16] brown when he comes to the end of a
[1:57:18] service he's saying now brother sister a
[1:57:20] piano player uh organ player or whatever
[1:57:22] who you are he said now real easy on the
[1:57:25] music
[1:57:28] why because he knows in loud music or
[1:57:30] loud or music it interrupts your ability
[1:57:33] to think
[1:57:34] have you been sitting somewhere and some
[1:57:36] loud music going on and you get
[1:57:38] frustrated and fed up with it it's a lot
[1:57:40] in here i can't even
[1:57:43] thank you
[1:57:45] you're telling the truth
[1:57:46] that's what that loud music is supposed
[1:57:48] to do it's supposed to interrupt the
[1:57:50] channel of your thoughts so you can't
[1:57:52] think
[1:57:53] so we want soft music whenever it's time
[1:57:56] to meditate
[1:57:57] but we need the symbols when it's time
[1:57:58] to worship
[1:58:12] that don't raise their voice
[1:58:15] i understand now after many many years
[1:58:17] this june will be 25 years of preaching
[1:58:19] the gospel i now understand after this
[1:58:21] study brother jesse why god made me a
[1:58:23] loud preacher
[1:58:25] amen
[1:58:27] amen
[1:58:28] i now understand because you know what
[1:58:29] if people stopped and thought about
[1:58:31] every little word i said they would
[1:58:33] never be able to absorb every word that
[1:58:34] i said so many times god made me laugh
[1:58:37] so i can keep people thinking about it
[1:58:44] it's hard to really enjoy your meal if
[1:58:46] you're looking at every bite before you
[1:58:47] stick it in your mouth
[1:58:49] doing scientific tests on it making sure
[1:58:50] it's actually food before you eat it
[1:58:53] so when it comes time for me to preach i
[1:58:55] just say just open up and just let me
[1:58:57] slam it in there
[1:59:00] symbols or sounding which is a loud
[1:59:03] sound a loud thing now watch by lifting
[1:59:06] up the voice
[1:59:10] with joy
[1:59:14] so the song
[1:59:16] has to be able to bring joy
[1:59:18] oh now we're driving home
[1:59:21] so what kind of saw what kind of joy
[1:59:25] is the song bringing
[1:59:27] if it is not bringing holy ghost joy
[1:59:29] if it is not bringing spiritual joy
[1:59:32] then evidently you've got the wrong song
[1:59:40] the lord showed me that when i said god
[1:59:42] help me punch that thing in the face as
[1:59:43] hard as i can hit it amen help me stomp
[1:59:46] his foot pull that camera's beard poke
[1:59:48] him in the eyes and show exactly where
[1:59:50] he's at do you understand that's why
[1:59:52] some people listen to music that ain't
[1:59:53] got it because it gives them a joy when
[1:59:56] they listen to that type of music but
[1:59:57] there's a joy that the holy ghost can
[1:59:59] give you that comes with the whole god
[2:00:02] all about you listen some of them taught
[2:00:04] this song and saying it and worshipping
[2:00:06] some of you
[2:00:07] it brings the joy of the holy ghost
[2:00:09] so then bring holy ghost joy you got the
[2:00:11] wrong song
[2:00:17] i've heard people say oh it just makes
[2:00:18] me happy was it god making you happy or
[2:00:21] was you happy
[2:00:22] there's a difference
[2:00:24] there's a difference absolutely now
[2:00:26] watch let's go to first chronicles 25
[2:00:28] verse one now let's dig down into this
[2:00:30] just a little bit more
[2:00:32] amen first chronicles 25 verse one i got
[2:00:35] the slightest idea how long i've been up
[2:00:37] here but maybe it's long maybe it ain't
[2:00:38] i don't know we're gonna keep going
[2:00:40] watch your first chronicles 25 1.
[2:00:42] whoever david and the captains of the
[2:00:43] host separated the service of the sons
[2:00:46] of asap haman jonathan these are writers
[2:00:48] of the book of psalms now books of the
[2:00:50] psalms and who should prophesy
[2:00:53] with harps
[2:00:55] oh my
[2:00:57] sultries and symbols
[2:00:59] who should prophesy
[2:01:02] prophesy
[2:01:04] so when you're playing this pen over
[2:01:05] here it's more than just putting notes
[2:01:07] together but you're actually prophesying
[2:01:10] did you remember that
[2:01:11] you're prophesying
[2:01:13] you say how in the world can i be
[2:01:16] prophesying will i give you an example
[2:01:18] what if you're sitting there sick in
[2:01:19] your body
[2:01:20] and you're sitting you hear a song come
[2:01:22] across the platform
[2:01:23] start singing he was wounded for my
[2:01:25] transgression bruised for my iniquity
[2:01:28] and by the stripes i'm already here
[2:01:30] you realize if you sing that song like
[2:01:32] paul said with understanding and singing
[2:01:34] with the spirit do you understand that
[2:01:36] when you sing that song out with that
[2:01:38] illness in your body what you are doing
[2:01:40] you are prophesying to your body you are
[2:01:44] prophesying amen to the devil you are
[2:01:46] prophesying to god i believe you are my
[2:01:51] viewers
[2:01:54] prophesy
[2:01:55] your prophet not what he said revelation
[2:01:57] 10 and he said eat the book and then go
[2:01:59] prophecy
[2:02:02] i am convinced that we are prophesying
[2:02:04] more differently today than what we ever
[2:02:06] realized
[2:02:08] people are standing in church singing
[2:02:09] i'm going to make the rapture one day
[2:02:11] like this one salmon i tried i'll see
[2:02:13] you in the rapture
[2:02:15] amen you know what i'm doing i'm
[2:02:16] prophesying amen i'm prophesying to you
[2:02:19] and then when you sing it back to me
[2:02:20] you're prophesying to me
[2:02:23] amen
[2:02:24] i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make it i'm
[2:02:27] gonna see you in the right
[2:02:33] oh praise the lord
[2:02:35] so they go into battle the armies will
[2:02:36] be all gathered together they'll be
[2:02:38] about 500 000 on one hill there'll be
[2:02:40] about 40 000 israelites
[2:02:43] and they go to singing
[2:02:44] my god
[2:02:46] turned israel upstairs turned egypt
[2:02:48] upside down
[2:02:50] he put the he put the chariots in the
[2:02:52] mud
[2:02:53] our god is a god of war hot god is going
[2:02:55] to deliver us from all the hands of our
[2:02:58] oppressors and our enemies that there's
[2:03:00] been forty thousand singing as hard as
[2:03:02] they can sing and they're looking at
[2:03:04] them five hundred thousand that's gonna
[2:03:05] wipe them out like you flick your finger
[2:03:07] across a little beetle book
[2:03:10] and who's the winners israel
[2:03:12] why because they were prophesying to
[2:03:14] that other group
[2:03:16] it isn't just us fighting the battle is
[2:03:18] not mine he said little people but the
[2:03:20] battle is the lord's i don't know
[2:03:23] the battle is
[2:03:28] oh praise the lamb of god listen to this
[2:03:31] leadership let me read it to you and i
[2:03:32] said singing gives courage the soldiers
[2:03:35] when they're going to battle what do
[2:03:36] they do they play music and singing
[2:03:38] things to give them courage when we're
[2:03:40] going to battle we sing and it gives us
[2:03:43] courage to go on now i want you to
[2:03:45] notice now that many times i always
[2:03:48] marvel this time of year
[2:03:49] and the school systems and things but a
[2:03:51] lot of times they'll go in and they'll
[2:03:53] say to the young people they'll say now
[2:03:55] you know don't take drugs and don't
[2:03:57] don't have sexual affairs and things and
[2:03:59] all that and then they put them on the
[2:04:00] dance floor they play all that music up
[2:04:03] above them they cannot figure out how
[2:04:05] that young man that young woman who was
[2:04:06] so bashful could barely look in the eye
[2:04:08] will go through their morals to the dogs
[2:04:10] after prom or homecoming or one of these
[2:04:12] deals why the music gave them courage to
[2:04:15] do the thing that the musicals want them
[2:04:17] to do
[2:04:18] now i'm going to have to say this gently
[2:04:19] because it's kind of a little strong
[2:04:21] words i got to use here
[2:04:23] but you realize that that the
[2:04:25] origination of rock and roll itself the
[2:04:27] term rock and roll is actually a street
[2:04:30] term that refers and forgive me enough
[2:04:33] is to blood but sexual intercourse
[2:04:35] so when you talk about elvis presley
[2:04:37] being the king of rock and roll
[2:04:40] now you see what kind of king he really
[2:04:42] was
[2:04:45] now rock and roll music is kind of a
[2:04:47] mishmash of your will of all these
[2:04:49] different styles and so as it evolved
[2:04:51] over over time it started with say blues
[2:04:54] and r b and some jazz and a few pieces
[2:04:57] and then as it evolved it brought in big
[2:04:59] band and swing and different types of
[2:05:01] music until it became what it is today
[2:05:04] now we know the prophet of god said that
[2:05:06] elvis was actually set out there elvis
[2:05:09] red foley and all these others pat boone
[2:05:11] and them you know when i collect old
[2:05:13] records i even go past the pat boone's
[2:05:15] and the red bullies and the tennessee
[2:05:16] earning forwards i don't even go get
[2:05:18] them old lps like that i figured brother
[2:05:20] brown didn't have nothing for him i
[2:05:21] could have that for him either
[2:05:23] as brother said leather standing there
[2:05:25] said now if you believe me to be a
[2:05:26] prophet of god he said you remember
[2:05:28] elvis presley is an incarnate devil
[2:05:33] he said he is a challenger to the church
[2:05:37] he said they're trying the devil is
[2:05:39] trying to use men like elvis in them to
[2:05:43] get that spirit into the church
[2:05:46] of rock and roll music
[2:05:48] now i want to show you something real
[2:05:50] quickly
[2:05:51] because the beats and the rhythms of
[2:05:53] rock and roll music are arranged in a
[2:05:56] certain way
[2:05:57] it is found that the scientists the
[2:05:59] physiological and all the smart folks
[2:06:01] can figure this stuff out
[2:06:03] oh you're just trying to read some of
[2:06:04] the words you have to almost get a
[2:06:05] dictionary to get through some of these
[2:06:07] little articles and things to get it all
[2:06:08] down
[2:06:09] but they go into the human body and as
[2:06:12] they go down in there they find out that
[2:06:14] rock and roll music has a certain effect
[2:06:16] upon the human body again forgive me if
[2:06:18] this is too plain but i got to be
[2:06:20] truthful with you telling us about this
[2:06:22] part of the sermon
[2:06:23] and that is rock and roll music the
[2:06:25] rhythms of the beats brother jesse
[2:06:27] actually release the hormones and the
[2:06:30] chemicals and things for a boy or a girl
[2:06:33] as if they were getting ready to enter
[2:06:35] into a physical relationship that's why
[2:06:37] the girls will pull their underneath
[2:06:39] clothes off and throw them up front for
[2:06:40] mr presley to sign all his autograph to
[2:06:43] the underneath closed why the rhythms of
[2:06:45] the beats was releasing hormones and
[2:06:47] pheromones and toxins and things in
[2:06:49] their body now listen to me carefully if
[2:06:52] a man or woman then listens at so-called
[2:06:55] contemporary gospel uh christian rock
[2:06:58] music or some sort of contemporary style
[2:07:01] that has the same type of rock and roll
[2:07:03] beats in it i want you to realize that
[2:07:06] your body does not know the difference
[2:07:08] just because one song says jesus and the
[2:07:11] other one says the devil your body
[2:07:13] doesn't know the difference
[2:07:15] your body responds to it as though it is
[2:07:18] rock and roll music even though they
[2:07:20] might be saying in jesus jesus jesus
[2:07:22] jesus and many of the contemporary
[2:07:24] so-called christian artists today they
[2:07:26] are literally calling it god not jesus
[2:07:29] but god so that they can appeal to the
[2:07:32] buddhists and to the sikhs and to the
[2:07:34] james and the muslims because all of
[2:07:37] them have gods and they all have a god
[2:07:40] and so if they say god not jesus then
[2:07:43] the other groups will buy their music as
[2:07:45] well
[2:07:46] but i want you to know when i sing about
[2:07:48] it when you sing about it i want to sing
[2:07:51] that his name is the lord jesus i want
[2:07:53] to sing there is only one god that we
[2:07:56] poured out of worship there's only one
[2:07:59] name whereby there's been given that we
[2:08:01] can be saved that is the name of the
[2:08:03] lord jesus christ
[2:08:10] tell me his name
[2:08:12] don't just quote to me god
[2:08:14] don't just sing to me about god anything
[2:08:16] could be a god
[2:08:18] but tell me who he is
[2:08:20] tell me that he saves me
[2:08:22] amen tell me that he loves me put on
[2:08:24] somebody
[2:08:25] tell me that he redeems me tell me that
[2:08:28] he wants to take me out of this old
[2:08:30] world
[2:08:34] don't just sing to me about god
[2:08:37] anything could be a god a car could be a
[2:08:39] god a football star could be a god
[2:08:42] a singer could be a god but there's only
[2:08:44] one lord jesus
[2:08:50] now let me let me talk to you about
[2:08:51] nature for just a moment
[2:08:54] in job 38 verse 6 and 7
[2:08:57] he asked joe where the foundations were
[2:08:59] fastened
[2:09:01] and who laid the cornerstone
[2:09:04] of course job if he's a smart guy and he
[2:09:06] was
[2:09:08] he didn't answer too much when god was
[2:09:09] asking him these questions
[2:09:12] and then today into this day and age and
[2:09:14] said who laid the foundations and we
[2:09:15] probably answered one of our great
[2:09:17] grandfathers it was walkway brother
[2:09:18] branham or something like that because
[2:09:20] that's the way people act anyways they
[2:09:21] think that we got some kind of a uh some
[2:09:24] kind of an elite group and we've done
[2:09:26] everything all the focus is upon what
[2:09:28] great great so-and-so done and not the
[2:09:30] great great jesus had done it for all of
[2:09:31] us
[2:09:33] but i'll just point your attention again
[2:09:35] in revelation 5 when they begin singing
[2:09:37] about that lamb of god the focus wasn't
[2:09:39] on them or the prophets because remember
[2:09:41] before that just a few verses there was
[2:09:43] a search made in heaven and no man was
[2:09:46] found worthy to open the book of the
[2:09:47] look thereof whether he was in heaven
[2:09:49] whether he was on the earth or whether
[2:09:51] it was buried underneath the earth in
[2:09:52] the ground there was nobody found worthy
[2:09:55] and when they went to sing and they sing
[2:09:57] about who they should sing about and
[2:09:59] that's about the lamb of god don't just
[2:10:01] sing to me about brother branham point
[2:10:02] to me to jesus
[2:10:06] if you send me a song about brother
[2:10:08] brahma and that song points me to jesus
[2:10:09] and i'll say amen to us
[2:10:11] but by the time you're done singing
[2:10:12] about brother brown you're still singing
[2:10:14] about brother brown something's wrong
[2:10:15] with your soul write another verse
[2:10:18] hello
[2:10:20] hello
[2:10:20] write another verse that's right write
[2:10:22] another verse
[2:10:24] watch here he said when the morning
[2:10:26] stars now
[2:10:27] sang
[2:10:28] together
[2:10:30] and all the sons of god shouted
[2:10:33] for joy
[2:10:34] music and worship goes together
[2:10:38] stars saying sun shouted music
[2:10:47] music and worship go together that's why
[2:10:49] god wants us to have the right kind of
[2:10:51] music because the right kind of music
[2:10:53] ushers us to the right kind of worship
[2:10:56] kids we don't take it seriously enough
[2:10:57] around the race
[2:10:59] no we come to church we sit down and say
[2:11:01] well
[2:11:02] turn to page two in the only believe
[2:11:04] song but they come from the east and the
[2:11:07] west
[2:11:08] barely an enthusiasm
[2:11:10] barely sings the verses out i don't mean
[2:11:12] because their voices scratch you either
[2:11:15] they just barely just barely get it out
[2:11:17] you know they finally finish the song
[2:11:19] and you're not sure whether or not you
[2:11:20] showed up to a funeral on accident
[2:11:24] looking for the dead body whatever they
[2:11:25] got in lady have someone around you got
[2:11:27] to be in this church somewhere
[2:11:28] huh come on somebody
[2:11:31] no enthusiasm no joy
[2:11:33] hey listen if i'm singing about being in
[2:11:35] the cross i'm only smile while i
[2:11:38] come on now
[2:11:39] if i'm going to sing without him coming
[2:11:41] back for me i want to be rejoicing when
[2:11:43] i sing the song because i'm prophesied
[2:11:49] i prophesy
[2:11:54] now watch this my what is what a thought
[2:11:56] this is right here
[2:11:58] when the morning stars sang now it was
[2:12:00] done i might have quoted this you once
[2:12:02] before but
[2:12:03] out of the university of central
[2:12:05] lincolnshire
[2:12:06] professor don kurtz done a little study
[2:12:08] on the stars one day to see if there's
[2:12:10] any truth to that
[2:12:12] and he found that there was a certain
[2:12:13] instrument they could use
[2:12:15] what they call astro sized biology
[2:12:18] you can say that you're better than i am
[2:12:20] and it takes this instrument and they
[2:12:22] stuck it somehow another one of these
[2:12:23] stars out there and they put this
[2:12:25] instrument out where it could read the
[2:12:27] stars
[2:12:28] and his words were that the stars
[2:12:30] actually sing
[2:12:32] they ring
[2:12:33] like giant musical instruments as
[2:12:36] instruments as sound waves cause them to
[2:12:39] vibrate to get hotter to get cooler
[2:12:42] brighter dimmer bigger smaller and
[2:12:45] change shape
[2:12:47] here's the key
[2:12:48] you could not hear from the outside
[2:12:51] the music being the same
[2:12:53] but once they were able to get the
[2:12:55] instrument to pick up what was coming
[2:12:58] from the inside that's where they heard
[2:13:00] the music
[2:13:02] the music was on the inside
[2:13:05] on the outside you couldn't hear the
[2:13:07] music or see the music but on the inside
[2:13:10] you could see the music oh come on
[2:13:12] somebody show you know what i'm talking
[2:13:13] about
[2:13:14] it's not the outside that sees the music
[2:13:17] that hears the music it's the inside
[2:13:21] and that's where all good music should
[2:13:23] come from and that's from
[2:13:37] [Applause]
[2:13:38] you said you had to look beneath the
[2:13:41] circles he said even a black hole
[2:13:43] would vibrate 57 octaves below middle c
[2:13:47] uh
[2:13:48] you know what i'm saying don't you i'm a
[2:13:50] black hole
[2:13:57] and so we know that they ring out of
[2:13:59] vibration everything
[2:14:02] has a vibration to it
[2:14:05] they're all vibrating the glory of god
[2:14:09] you say nature does not recognize god i
[2:14:11] bet your pardon brother said when jesus
[2:14:14] was dying on calvary he said the earth
[2:14:16] had a nervous breakdown
[2:14:19] he said the son recognized his creator
[2:14:22] was dying on calvary and it had
[2:14:31] so they vibrate
[2:14:33] they vibrate and ring out
[2:14:35] the glory of god have you ever had to
[2:14:37] see a parakeet
[2:14:39] taken in to get a diabetes a1c test
[2:14:43] you ever seen a bluebird with high blood
[2:14:45] pressure
[2:14:46] huh
[2:14:47] you've been to the doctor before haven't
[2:14:48] you have you ever seen a giraffe
[2:14:51] in there with a thermometer in its mouth
[2:14:54] no why they're constantly ringing out
[2:14:56] god's praise
[2:14:58] they're wringing out god's praise
[2:15:01] you know why they know how to get their
[2:15:02] little brains a break
[2:15:04] they know how to get their little brains
[2:15:06] to break they don't worry about what
[2:15:07] they're going to eat tomorrow because
[2:15:08] jesus is going to feed them oh god
[2:15:11] oh yes sir hallelujah they don't worry
[2:15:14] about what they're going to live
[2:15:15] tomorrow because god's got a home for
[2:15:17] them tomorrow and before they get to
[2:15:19] tomorrow he is
[2:15:34] they're constantly vibrating his worship
[2:15:38] his praise
[2:15:39] no wonder john the baptist said if you
[2:15:42] hold your peace these rocks
[2:15:45] will immediately cried out
[2:15:50] hey glory
[2:15:52] why because they were oxford
[2:15:56] it's just that they know their place
[2:15:58] they know humans first rock second
[2:16:02] but jesus john said if they hold their
[2:16:04] peace he said i won't even let the rocks
[2:16:06] hold their peace
[2:16:08] why somebody's gonna worship him if we
[2:16:10] don't worship
[2:16:14] lord
[2:16:16] again it's that sound is unique
[2:16:20] there's never any real silence anywhere
[2:16:23] in nature the more quiet we become
[2:16:26] the more subtle the sounds we hear from
[2:16:28] the environment
[2:16:30] we're placed inside of an isolation tank
[2:16:33] we'd hear our heartbeat our breathing
[2:16:36] it'd be the ocean sound and the in our
[2:16:38] ears
[2:16:39] that's when the air molecules vibrating
[2:16:41] in our ear canals
[2:16:43] we hear the sounds of our own nervous
[2:16:45] system
[2:16:46] in this tank
[2:16:48] why because everything is vibrating
[2:16:49] constantly
[2:16:51] constantly the glory of god
[2:16:53] notice worship praise going together
[2:16:56] in psalm 96 1-2 the day david said it
[2:16:58] was singing of the lord
[2:17:00] sing unto the lord all the earth
[2:17:02] watch him saying worship sing worship
[2:17:05] worship sing
[2:17:07] in isaiah 42 verse 10 through 13
[2:17:10] he said the sing of the lord a new song
[2:17:13] and his praise from the end of the earth
[2:17:16] either go down to the sea orleans
[2:17:17] they're in the aisles the inhabitants
[2:17:19] thereof watch us let the wilderness and
[2:17:21] the cities lift up their voice
[2:17:23] the villages that kid are not inhabited
[2:17:24] let the inhabitants of the rock sing
[2:17:27] that's my new title y'all i'm an
[2:17:29] inhabitant of the rock
[2:17:30] [Laughter]
[2:17:32] glory
[2:17:33] yes sir
[2:17:35] let them shout from the top of the
[2:17:36] mountains and let them give glory unto
[2:17:39] the lord and declare his praise in the
[2:17:41] ivories
[2:17:44] worship and praise going together music
[2:17:46] going together watch again psalm 148 1-3
[2:17:50] praise you the lord praise you the lord
[2:17:51] from the heavens praise him in the
[2:17:53] heights
[2:17:54] praise him all the angels
[2:17:58] praise him all ye hosts
[2:18:00] praise him sun and moon
[2:18:03] praise him all you stars of light
[2:18:06] what's he showing everything is
[2:18:08] vibrating out god's praise god's worship
[2:18:10] god's glory
[2:18:12] it's constantly vibrating out oh i feel
[2:18:14] religious hallelujah
[2:18:16] hallelujah it's always vibrating out
[2:18:19] through oh my maybe even clapping the
[2:18:21] hands maybe even raising up the hands
[2:18:24] maybe saying the voice of amen maybe the
[2:18:26] sound of their tears patting off their
[2:18:28] cheek maybe the sound of their heart
[2:18:30] beating in a faster rhythm when they
[2:18:32] feel his presence come into the room
[2:18:38] oh glory to god if it make the sun go
[2:18:40] happy and what ought to do to a s-o-n
[2:18:44] if it would make the s-o-s you've been
[2:18:46] praising what about an esso win
[2:18:50] psalm 144 verse nine going back about
[2:18:52] four chapters he said i sing unto the
[2:18:54] lord a new song and a d o god
[2:18:57] upon a sultry and an instrument of ten
[2:18:59] strings
[2:19:00] well i praise unto thee so if you've got
[2:19:02] all your fingers you've got a ten string
[2:19:05] instrument if you're missing a few
[2:19:07] you're tapping by faith
[2:19:10] if you understand what i'm saying you
[2:19:11] might be missing an arm you're clapping
[2:19:12] by faith but potentially potentially
[2:19:14] you've got ten strings right
[2:19:16] and then you may not have it here maybe
[2:19:18] a surgery took a hand off maybe an
[2:19:20] accident made you lose an arm but when
[2:19:22] you get in that new city your
[2:19:23] 10-stringed instrument will be waiting
[2:19:25] on you
[2:19:26] hey
[2:19:27] it's going to be why not in the glory of
[2:19:29] our god what do you think we're going to
[2:19:31] do in the new city slap here and pass
[2:19:33] quote books to each other and debate
[2:19:34] doctrine
[2:19:36] when we get in this new city brother
[2:19:37] there's gonna be worship after worship
[2:19:39] praise after praise there's gonna be
[2:19:41] songs saying come on somebody there's
[2:19:43] gonna be victory ringing out through the
[2:19:45] kingdom of god
[2:19:50] psalm 22 verse 3
[2:19:53] he says but thou art holy
[2:19:55] oh lord
[2:19:57] that inhabits
[2:19:59] the praise
[2:20:01] of israel
[2:20:03] faith abraham little man says how
[2:20:04] wonderful i just notice the scripture as
[2:20:06] you listen to this
[2:20:08] how god enters poetry
[2:20:11] how he enters songs
[2:20:13] how he enters praise how he enters
[2:20:17] worship
[2:20:18] it's as though you build a room for him
[2:20:20] to inhabit
[2:20:22] glory to god
[2:20:24] it's like you built a room for him to
[2:20:26] have it i call it a little room
[2:20:32] come on somebody preach to me i'm
[2:20:34] talking about i'll meet you in there
[2:20:36] that'll be the third pool i want that if
[2:20:39] many people haven't missed the third
[2:20:40] pull knowing that part of this third
[2:20:42] pool is worship praise and singing and
[2:20:44] music
[2:20:48] and prayer
[2:20:49] remember what he quoted matthew 6 6 he
[2:20:51] said well why did he why don't you say
[2:20:53] that little room like that in private he
[2:20:54] said didn't jesus say go into a little
[2:20:56] room and when you pray
[2:20:59] what your father reveals his secret
[2:21:01] he'll reward you open amen
[2:21:05] oh my hallelujah is in the lamb of god
[2:21:08] you might be getting tired after but i'm
[2:21:10] just getting started i'm feeling warmed
[2:21:11] up right now
[2:21:12] watch out in psalm 33 1-3 rejoice in the
[2:21:16] lord
[2:21:17] oh ye righteous
[2:21:19] for praise is comely for the upright
[2:21:22] amen
[2:21:24] praise the lord with heart
[2:21:27] and sing unto him a sultry and an
[2:21:30] instrument of ten strings sing unto him
[2:21:33] as do song and play skillfully with a
[2:21:38] oh no surely that ain't what david said
[2:21:43] but he did
[2:21:44] with a loud
[2:21:47] boy
[2:21:52] i'm just not an emotional person you see
[2:21:54] and
[2:21:55] i just don't get emotional about much
[2:21:57] about much well
[2:21:59] let's do a little experiment kevin i
[2:22:01] notice as i walk past that room right
[2:22:03] there there's all kinds of little
[2:22:04] hammers and
[2:22:05] saws and instruments of working over
[2:22:08] there
[2:22:08] if you don't mind we'll go to the side
[2:22:10] room after church you that are not
[2:22:12] emotional we'll take a hammer you offer
[2:22:15] up the right hand of fellowship i will
[2:22:18] wax that hammer on said hand if you
[2:22:20] don't squeal you have a right to stay
[2:22:22] quiet in church
[2:22:24] but if you squeal you're an emotional
[2:22:27] person
[2:22:28] i think you already know the answer to
[2:22:30] what's going to happen though
[2:22:32] no we're not emotional about what we
[2:22:34] don't want to be emotional about we're
[2:22:35] emotional about what we want to be
[2:22:37] emotional about
[2:22:38] you know those are grandkids or
[2:22:40] something like that
[2:22:41] or whoever and they're playing soccer
[2:22:42] they kick a field goal or whatever you
[2:22:44] call them and then oh hey i could knock
[2:22:46] people over did you see what happened
[2:22:49] and then we come to the house of god and
[2:22:50] the devil kicks field goals on the devil
[2:22:52] on her god kicks phil goes on the devil
[2:22:54] day and night how many cents they go
[2:23:01] i'm just a quiet person
[2:23:06] okay so what you're saying is
[2:23:08] if i had a million dollars i'm not i'm a
[2:23:10] real evangelist silver and gold have i
[2:23:12] done
[2:23:16] [Music]
[2:23:18] no that's not a pool for a bigger offer
[2:23:23] but if i was to hand you a million
[2:23:25] dollar check let's say i had 10 million
[2:23:27] dollars i wanted to share a million
[2:23:29] dollars with you you need to tell me if
[2:23:31] i wrote down a personal check earmarked
[2:23:33] it from me to you for one million
[2:23:35] dollars a year market so it's it's
[2:23:36] tax-free that you don't even have some
[2:23:38] charitable non unsolicited tax free gift
[2:23:40] you only have to pay taxes on it one
[2:23:42] million smackaroos in your bank account
[2:23:44] you mean to tell me if i handed you that
[2:23:46] check and you knew money was in the bank
[2:23:47] you knew i was good for it that you just
[2:23:49] stand and go
[2:23:50] wow
[2:23:51] i didn't mean something
[2:23:54] you know what that brought up i got a
[2:23:56] million dollars this day
[2:23:58] you did yeah sure did yeah
[2:24:01] hey did you hear what's happening in the
[2:24:02] super bowl over the weekend
[2:24:06] you imagine that big one
[2:24:07] you imagine you change the subject but
[2:24:09] you move on to the next thing
[2:24:11] you've been talking about the last trump
[2:24:13] or hillary or whatever it's going to be
[2:24:16] come on
[2:24:17] you imagine that's the way it is i
[2:24:19] imagine if i handed you a million
[2:24:20] dollars and you knew i was good for it
[2:24:22] that you'd be going
[2:24:23] hey hey everybody everybody i got a
[2:24:26] million
[2:24:31] so you mean you can come to church and
[2:24:33] these brothers can hand you god-given
[2:24:35] qualities of the word
[2:24:37] that are priceless
[2:24:39] of eternal value
[2:24:45] [Music]
[2:24:50] no if you got this right what david's
[2:24:52] saying right here you praised him with a
[2:24:54] loud noise
[2:24:59] oh hallelujah
[2:25:02] let me go just uh just a little bit
[2:25:04] further okay all right
[2:25:06] turn the act 16 25 26 now
[2:25:09] now let me show you this part about
[2:25:11] giving your brain a break
[2:25:13] now something that you got to know is
[2:25:15] that
[2:25:16] i'm going to read you some quotes in
[2:25:17] just a moment we're running around deals
[2:25:18] with people of this type of nature
[2:25:21] that many times our thinking is what
[2:25:24] gets us in such a nervous condition i
[2:25:26] understand there's times that you got to
[2:25:28] think there's times that you've got to
[2:25:30] uh figure things you're going to dwell
[2:25:32] on things and meditate and so forth
[2:25:34] but as i said
[2:25:36] you know with the easy music it was easy
[2:25:38] to meditate with a softer thing
[2:25:40] because brother ramen just got done
[2:25:41] preaching sermons and things and he
[2:25:43] wanted the people to meditate on what's
[2:25:45] been said if the musician or ever who
[2:25:48] would have started on a loud rejoicing
[2:25:50] jubilee type song it would have not that
[2:25:52] that ability to meditate on what's being
[2:25:55] saying that's why at the end of the
[2:25:56] service it shouldn't be something wild
[2:25:57] thing it should be some deal to get you
[2:25:59] kind of calm or you can meditate on
[2:26:01] what's being said then you watch brother
[2:26:02] brown after the people have been dealt
[2:26:04] with god's death with them they thought
[2:26:06] things over they've repented whatever
[2:26:07] they've done then he says now everybody
[2:26:09] everybody on your feet now let's say
[2:26:10] real loud everybody the type you alone
[2:26:12] sing together now what he done he
[2:26:14] changed by the leadership of the holy
[2:26:15] ghost he changed the atmosphere because
[2:26:18] meditation was over right
[2:26:20] now sometimes you've got to give your
[2:26:22] brain a break
[2:26:26] sometimes you don't need to think
[2:26:32] i'm letting that soak because you really
[2:26:34] need to know that
[2:26:35] sometimes you don't need to think
[2:26:41] you say brother ben i am a faker
[2:26:44] sometimes you need to quit
[2:26:51] well i'll ask you what gets you in more
[2:26:53] trouble making assumptions and guessing
[2:26:54] and getting nervous and all out of sorts
[2:26:56] and not being able to wait on the will
[2:26:58] of god
[2:26:59] then thank you but if i don't have you
[2:27:01] know the old saying is the old adage is
[2:27:03] brother ben people don't plan to fail
[2:27:05] they found a plan
[2:27:07] i agree with that too
[2:27:09] i believe that's right too
[2:27:11] but there are times that you need to
[2:27:13] remember that your plans are
[2:27:22] it said that if you want to make god
[2:27:24] laugh just tell him your plans
[2:27:40] rapture comes at you one
[2:27:47] i believe there's a time the bible said
[2:27:49] ponder the direction of your feet so
[2:27:50] there's times we need to be ready you
[2:27:52] need to plant the apples and so forth he
[2:27:54] said like you know the coming of the
[2:27:55] lord could be 50 years off but you need
[2:27:57] to be ready like it'd be right now i
[2:27:59] believe that
[2:28:00] but i'm talking about something entirely
[2:28:02] different be ready for the rapture i'm
[2:28:03] talking about your daily today life
[2:28:06] because that's where a lot of us
[2:28:07] struggle at
[2:28:09] sometimes with the time we just got to
[2:28:11] give this part of our brain to break
[2:28:13] because if you go out and you think
[2:28:14] constantly about every little thing that
[2:28:16] moves you're going to get nervous you're
[2:28:18] going to get tore up before long you're
[2:28:20] dreaming about it before it's all you
[2:28:22] can talk about you'll notice people that
[2:28:23] get on it they can't get off it that's
[2:28:25] all they're thinking about
[2:28:27] that's why they're talking about it over
[2:28:28] and over and over again so thank god god
[2:28:31] has given us away
[2:28:34] amen stay with me now he's given us a
[2:28:37] way to give our brain a break
[2:28:44] let me prove that to you right now in
[2:28:46] acts chapter 16 verse 25-26
[2:28:50] and at midnight paul and silas prayed
[2:28:53] and sang praises unto god
[2:28:58] so you've got a church age messenger in
[2:29:00] a jail cell with you
[2:29:02] you've got the man that's got the
[2:29:03] mystery that god right mr god right next
[2:29:05] to you
[2:29:06] and yet you don't say hey paul read me
[2:29:09] more about that ephesians letter about
[2:29:10] being caught in heavenly places but you
[2:29:12] you're saying
[2:29:14] you're saying
[2:29:17] now why are they doing this think about
[2:29:19] where they're at
[2:29:20] a lot of times they're sitting on iron
[2:29:22] rails they're shackled down
[2:29:24] many different conditions are there the
[2:29:26] the stink and the putrification and rats
[2:29:29] running over and all kinds of things
[2:29:30] like that i don't mind telling you after
[2:29:33] a while that would get to this little
[2:29:35] gray matter between my ears right here
[2:29:36] called my brain
[2:29:38] and if that's all i can think about what
[2:29:40] happens you start getting discouraged
[2:29:42] you start getting down hearted
[2:29:44] so paul and silas said hey
[2:29:46] let's give our brain a break for a
[2:29:48] little while
[2:29:50] hallelujah
[2:29:52] and they prayed and started singing and
[2:29:55] as they sang watch that verse 26
[2:29:57] suddenly there was a great earthquake
[2:30:00] you know i believe that
[2:30:02] i believe god got to listen to them
[2:30:04] they got to like him when he was hearing
[2:30:08] god saw the tightness foot
[2:30:10] god sort of clapping his hands
[2:30:12] angels would say hey hey lord there's a
[2:30:13] whole horse and my boys are really
[2:30:14] putting on a good concert right now
[2:30:24] they may not have known what it was
[2:30:26] but his dog was patting his foot there
[2:30:28] was an earthquake shaking the trail said
[2:30:30] all right
[2:30:33] this was the original jailhouse rock
[2:30:37] oh glory
[2:30:41] why they had to give their brain a break
[2:30:49] [Music]
[2:30:50] when you are nervous and tore up and
[2:30:52] upset
[2:30:54] the worst thing you can do is put on
[2:30:56] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[2:30:59] [Laughter]
[2:31:05] one of the worst things that you can do
[2:31:07] is determine i'm going to read 37
[2:31:09] chapters in my bible right now
[2:31:11] you know why you're stressing your brain
[2:31:13] even more because if you're like me and
[2:31:15] you are when you listen to the message
[2:31:17] you read the bible and things you're
[2:31:18] working
[2:31:19] you're laboring in the word you're
[2:31:21] working as you listen if you're already
[2:31:22] frazzled you get nothing out of that
[2:31:24] message whatsoever so what is the answer
[2:31:27] apply the word
[2:31:28] but apply a different part of the word
[2:31:30] in this right application
[2:31:34] amen
[2:31:35] i was preaching this the other day
[2:31:36] another place here in ohio and i said
[2:31:39] that about the future home another
[2:31:40] preacher said look out i thought the
[2:31:42] other one needs to look out because
[2:31:43] you're going to get embarrassed during a
[2:31:44] few minutes
[2:31:45] that's right one of the worst because
[2:31:47] you know how you are if you're frazzled
[2:31:49] and upset and nervous and you've got to
[2:31:50] put on the tape especially something
[2:31:51] like future home my brother starts out
[2:31:54] by talking complimenting people on the
[2:31:55] way their their rooms looked and their
[2:31:57] behavior in the restaurants and if
[2:31:59] you're any kind of a slob at all and
[2:32:00] you're already uh overworked and nervous
[2:32:03] and then you hear brother talking that
[2:32:04] way what starts happening the devil
[2:32:06] jumps on your shoulder and says now i
[2:32:07] see that that's everything's
[2:32:09] complimenting them because of how their
[2:32:10] homes looked how does your home look
[2:32:13] come on now don't look at it that way
[2:32:16] what does he do he starts using things
[2:32:18] again because why you're already
[2:32:20] frazzled from much thinking so he just
[2:32:23] takes you that much deeper that much
[2:32:25] deeper that much deeper you said use the
[2:32:28] word on the devil i completely agree
[2:32:30] with you amen
[2:32:33] but the part of the word i want to use
[2:32:35] is a little bit different part of the
[2:32:36] word you want to use
[2:32:38] i want to use the part of the word where
[2:32:40] they've done this right here where they
[2:32:42] gave their brain a break
[2:32:48] let me prove something to you right now
[2:32:50] let me drop down here just a little bit
[2:32:52] let me let me read to you how brother
[2:32:53] brown did this now brother branham did
[2:32:55] this
[2:32:56] and it doesn't really matter to me what
[2:32:57] anybody thinks about this it's just
[2:33:00] absolutely the way it ought to be done
[2:33:02] now here's brother brown of course he's
[2:33:03] got all these different little uh
[2:33:05] problems and things that he's dealing
[2:33:07] with all the time now you know as well
[2:33:08] as i do brother man had to absolutely
[2:33:10] get so frazzled sometimes he didn't know
[2:33:12] how to go up down left or right
[2:33:15] so brother adam would use
[2:33:17] these different ways to actually get in
[2:33:20] there
[2:33:20] and give his mind a rest
[2:33:23] now the message i'm looking for i'm
[2:33:24] trying to get down here to it right
[2:33:25] quickly i've got a lot of hay on this
[2:33:27] fork over here
[2:33:28] but i'm just talking about how he said
[2:33:31] have you ever got down in the dumps he
[2:33:33] said go about how god heals by music let
[2:33:36] me pull over this little place i may
[2:33:37] have it on this this other little file
[2:33:39] right here i want to read it to you word
[2:33:41] for word lord helping me now watch this
[2:33:44] he said god heals my music and so forth
[2:33:47] he said sometimes i get kind of feeling
[2:33:49] tired and wore out just that down
[2:33:51] calvary actually he said nerves on edge
[2:33:54] he said i'll jump in my car take out
[2:33:56] hold of the steering wheel going down
[2:33:58] the road singing i'm glad that i can say
[2:34:01] i'm one of them
[2:34:05] see gripping the steering wheel singing
[2:34:07] and stopping my foot and shouting after
[2:34:09] a while i get tired turn home and start
[2:34:11] something else he says
[2:34:13] now if brother branham
[2:34:15] had to go down
[2:34:17] and go down and and sing to get kind of
[2:34:19] out of that nervous
[2:34:21] tired press
[2:34:23] then what do you think it'll do for us
[2:34:24] when we do the same thing
[2:34:26] the same thing for him
[2:34:29] all right in another place here brother
[2:34:30] man said if you've ever been down the
[2:34:32] dumps
[2:34:34] he says the street expression we call it
[2:34:36] he said but you kind of got the blues i
[2:34:38] know some of y'all ain't never probably
[2:34:40] been there but if you ever get to the
[2:34:42] dump spill down there go down about
[2:34:44] halfway down through the middle of it
[2:34:45] you'll see a big old trash can on the
[2:34:47] side ben was here
[2:34:50] so i've been here many many times down
[2:34:51] in the dust
[2:34:54] brother brandon said just put on one of
[2:34:56] those tapes ah
[2:34:58] see that brother man
[2:35:00] just keep on reading
[2:35:02] one of those records or music he says
[2:35:06] and before you know it now listen
[2:35:08] brother kind of says this in a way as if
[2:35:11] almost like it sneaks up on you
[2:35:13] it does why it's going down through this
[2:35:16] right side of the brain it drops into
[2:35:18] the subconscious and before you know it
[2:35:20] it's making your body react it's making
[2:35:22] your body pick up changing your
[2:35:24] intention and picking it up
[2:35:27] the music that that he's listening to
[2:35:30] he said this gospel music he said first
[2:35:32] thing you know you're pat your foot
[2:35:34] you're clapping your hand
[2:35:36] it's all over you're up and ready to go
[2:35:38] again amen
[2:35:40] now here's the prophet of god that had
[2:35:42] tapes on the scene when he was here
[2:35:44] so why didn't brother say go listen to
[2:35:46] one of my tapes it was all at all
[2:35:50] amen
[2:35:52] because listening to a tape doesn't
[2:35:53] solve everything
[2:35:55] but you say the word has power i agree
[2:35:58] but the word in his right application
[2:36:00] [Applause]
[2:36:03] i like what brother biscuit said one
[2:36:04] time he said god man shall live by every
[2:36:07] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[2:36:08] god he said that's true and that's not
[2:36:10] true
[2:36:11] and like my pastor said back home he
[2:36:13] heard it he said huh
[2:36:14] he said i'll give you an example he said
[2:36:16] if god said in the days of noah build an
[2:36:18] ark and i'll save your household he said
[2:36:20] in this day and age he said you can
[2:36:21] build every ark there was and the fire
[2:36:23] falls you ain't going to be saved
[2:36:25] he said the days of the passover said
[2:36:27] paint the door of your of your of your
[2:36:29] house red with the blood of the lamb he
[2:36:31] said you could paint your entire house
[2:36:32] red today and he said it would never
[2:36:34] save you why it's not just word per se
[2:36:37] but it is the word of due season
[2:36:41] remember one of the must have said you
[2:36:43] must not do is dislocate the word
[2:36:46] so there are times to read your bible
[2:36:48] said every christian is this spiritual
[2:36:50] praise and read the bible every day
[2:36:52] there's times for that there's times to
[2:36:54] meditate times to have loud music
[2:36:57] there's times to listen to the message
[2:36:59] but there's times that just give your
[2:37:01] brain a break too
[2:37:06] thank you jesus
[2:37:08] oh
[2:37:09] hallelujah that was in luke and phoenix
[2:37:11] god heals by music
[2:37:13] he said just put on one of those tapes
[2:37:15] the musical record go to playing it he
[2:37:17] says all over you're up and ready to go
[2:37:19] again now watch this
[2:37:20] in in um
[2:37:22] ephesians chapter 5 verse 18 19 we'll go
[2:37:25] just a pinch further and i'm going to
[2:37:26] quit okay because we got two more
[2:37:27] services and i could i could make you
[2:37:29] wait a whole lot longer on some of this
[2:37:31] so tomorrow anyways
[2:37:33] but get your appetite up a little bit
[2:37:34] one little bit more of this
[2:37:36] ephesians 5 18 19.
[2:37:39] i don't know we'll see how it goes i'm
[2:37:40] going to hear more on this music i got
[2:37:42] page after page after page after page we
[2:37:44] can spend the whole weekend on it really
[2:37:46] he says be not drunk with wine whereas
[2:37:48] an excess but be filled with the spirit
[2:37:51] watch speaking to
[2:37:53] yourselves
[2:37:55] in psalms hymns spiritual songs singing
[2:37:59] and making melody in your heart to the
[2:38:02] lord
[2:38:03] so sometimes i sing to you
[2:38:05] sometimes i sing to god
[2:38:08] sometimes i sing down to the devil
[2:38:10] sometimes
[2:38:11] i sing to me
[2:38:16] speaking to yourselves
[2:38:19] that's why sometimes god ain't wanting
[2:38:20] to be encouraged
[2:38:23] you understand god ain't never had to be
[2:38:25] encouraged
[2:38:29] sometimes the devil don't want to be
[2:38:30] told he's a loser he already knows that
[2:38:33] sometimes i sing to him and tell him
[2:38:34] he's lost the battle you're a loser
[2:38:38] amen
[2:38:40] sometimes i need to sing to me
[2:38:42] because sometimes me needs to hear
[2:38:45] that he's still a healer
[2:38:46] that is still the deliverer
[2:38:48] that is still a savior
[2:38:50] that no matter what kind of a wall we're
[2:38:52] backed up on as christians that he has
[2:38:54] always got the answer to how to get away
[2:38:56] from things amen how to get out of
[2:38:58] master troubles and master problems oh
[2:39:00] my
[2:39:01] watch here in colossians 3 16 let the
[2:39:04] word of christ dwell in you richly with
[2:39:06] all wisdom teaching and admonishing one
[2:39:08] another watches teaching and admonishing
[2:39:11] one another how in psalms
[2:39:14] hymns
[2:39:15] and spiritual songs singing with grace
[2:39:17] in your heart to the lord
[2:39:19] so you're actually teaching and
[2:39:20] admonishing through singing through
[2:39:22] music
[2:39:23] ah i thought the preachers are the one
[2:39:25] who could do that
[2:39:27] not necessarily
[2:39:29] because sometimes you come to church
[2:39:31] you're mad at the preacher
[2:39:35] sometimes you're mad at it but when you
[2:39:36] go to church you're standing there you
[2:39:39] don't really feel like being in church
[2:39:40] but you're trying to do your service to
[2:39:41] god
[2:39:42] so you just give an example of what my
[2:39:44] idea of admonish would be so the person
[2:39:46] next to you is satan with all their
[2:39:48] heart
[2:39:49] before you know it they've pulled you
[2:39:51] into their atmosphere and you're feeling
[2:39:53] better
[2:39:56] why you admonish them in spiritual
[2:39:58] psalms sitting right here in the
[2:39:59] congregation
[2:40:02] that's wife is saying you should sing
[2:40:03] with all your heart every time you come
[2:40:05] amen
[2:40:07] james 5 13
[2:40:09] is any among you afflicted let him pray
[2:40:11] is in he married let him sing psalms
[2:40:15] amen
[2:40:16] praise the lord
[2:40:20] let me just pick this up now
[2:40:22] come sir
[2:40:24] as you walk to me i've seen something
[2:40:25] moving and here is what it is
[2:40:28] it's anemia your blood
[2:40:30] one thing you're a nervous person
[2:40:33] huh
[2:40:34] nervous person
[2:40:36] nervous person
[2:40:38] not the kind that shakes and carries on
[2:40:42] but the deep thinking
[2:40:46] so you mean you can be a nervous person
[2:40:48] just by being a deep thinker that's what
[2:40:49] brings on the nervousness
[2:40:51] yes
[2:40:54] yes
[2:40:57] he said that's right there's an old
[2:40:59] saying you're always crossing bridges
[2:41:01] before you get to them
[2:41:06] building up things that never happen you
[2:41:08] can't hide your life he said
[2:41:10] the man prays for the man he said now
[2:41:12] sir
[2:41:13] as you go rejoicing go and be happy
[2:41:19] okay
[2:41:22] so how am i supposed to do that again
[2:41:25] that's it just flip a switch be happy
[2:41:27] you've got one chance to stand in front
[2:41:29] of a prophet of god one you wait months
[2:41:31] to get a prayer card you're right billy
[2:41:33] it takes a month to give you a prayer
[2:41:34] card you go stand out weeks before the
[2:41:37] meeting comes you're standing out hours
[2:41:39] before you get to the prayer line you
[2:41:40] stand in front of brother brown he tells
[2:41:42] you what's wrong with you and then looks
[2:41:43] at you and says now go be happy
[2:41:46] i'm going to tell you something if you
[2:41:47] ain't got a revelation from god about
[2:41:48] what's going on you're going to put you
[2:41:50] up a website pretty soon
[2:41:55] but watch what brother says he says go
[2:41:57] be happy very next words sing songs all
[2:42:01] day long
[2:42:08] you mean that's all there is to it if
[2:42:10] you're the deep thinking kind yes it is
[2:42:15] you understand what happens as i told
[2:42:17] you when you sing the thinking part of
[2:42:19] your brain shuts off
[2:42:21] so the devil knows
[2:42:22] what type of nature this guy's got
[2:42:25] brethren's actually giving me antidotes
[2:42:28] watch he said you're that quiet type of
[2:42:30] person which would hurt you later in
[2:42:32] life
[2:42:35] you go on and you just start singing
[2:42:37] hymns
[2:42:38] and rejoicing testifying of your healing
[2:42:41] and it will leave you
[2:42:44] why didn't brother madam say now look
[2:42:46] i'm a prophet of god i've laid my hands
[2:42:47] on you that devil's got better brains
[2:42:49] and come back after you after all
[2:42:51] prophets laid his hands on you why
[2:42:53] didn't that tell him to go sing hymns
[2:42:54] and be happy you know why that's the
[2:42:57] approach to the lord this man was
[2:42:58] fighting
[2:43:00] that was the approach to this war
[2:43:03] he knew the only way that he could truly
[2:43:04] win
[2:43:06] was if he said
[2:43:09] let me read you another one do you
[2:43:11] believe now with all your heart he says
[2:43:13] i've never seen you don't know you but
[2:43:14] god knows you don't
[2:43:16] you want to get over that stomach
[2:43:18] trouble and be made well
[2:43:19] he said you believe
[2:43:20] it's caused from a nervous condition
[2:43:23] you'll have to do what i tell you in a
[2:43:25] few minutes just accept your healing
[2:43:27] right now and go out here just as happy
[2:43:29] as you can be
[2:43:32] okay
[2:43:34] so how do i do that again
[2:43:37] listen i heard everybody just said today
[2:43:39] if god gives you something you said to
[2:43:40] do god's obligated to give you a way to
[2:43:43] do it
[2:43:44] amen
[2:43:47] he says
[2:43:48] be singing and rejoicing
[2:43:52] that's how you could just automatically
[2:43:53] be happy
[2:43:56] you said but that doesn't make any sense
[2:43:58] to me all right let me break it down
[2:44:00] let's say you're this nervous type
[2:44:02] person right here deep thinking crossing
[2:44:04] bridges
[2:44:05] and the devil knows your nature he knows
[2:44:07] how you think he knows how you are so
[2:44:09] when you wake up in the morning a lot of
[2:44:11] times all the devil has to do is drop
[2:44:12] the stone into the river and he knows
[2:44:15] that the wailers will take the rest of
[2:44:16] it you other ways you'll take the rest
[2:44:18] of it off for the rest of the day
[2:44:20] so let's say that the next night after
[2:44:22] this that brother baby said you wake up
[2:44:25] and the devil comes to you and he says
[2:44:27] i'm gonna let you know something right
[2:44:28] now that was a hoax yesterday
[2:44:31] that man was reading your mind
[2:44:34] that wasn't god
[2:44:36] that wasn't anything
[2:44:38] but now all of a sudden
[2:44:40] if she yields to that
[2:44:41] then that mind or hers that left brain
[2:44:43] starts going
[2:44:45] like a choo-choo train
[2:44:49] it just keeps picking up steam picking a
[2:44:51] momentum and faster and faster all the
[2:44:53] time but now let me show you the beauty
[2:44:55] of what i'm preaching to that
[2:44:57] so when the devil comes by and he says
[2:44:59] you know what you're not gonna make it
[2:45:02] all of a sudden you lift your voice up
[2:45:04] and you start singing i'm gonna make it
[2:45:07] someday
[2:45:12] the devil says did you hear what i said
[2:45:15] to you i'm gonna make it someday
[2:45:21] after about three or four times that he
[2:45:23] stomps back down into hell with his tail
[2:45:25] between his legs and the devil said the
[2:45:26] devil said to him how'd it go terrible
[2:45:29] what do you mean terrible i had the
[2:45:31] perfect plan i had her right where i
[2:45:34] wanted her i had him right where i
[2:45:36] wanted him well what happened what
[2:45:38] happened every time i tried to talk to
[2:45:40] the left side she turned it off
[2:45:43] and was keep singing on the right side
[2:45:45] and i couldn't get a thought in
[2:45:49] i couldn't get a word in x-wise because
[2:45:52] she shut it off
[2:46:00] oh my
[2:46:02] he said now sister you've been under a
[2:46:04] strain
[2:46:05] you've been nervous since she was born
[2:46:06] i'm not reading your mind
[2:46:08] but i see your life go back as a little
[2:46:10] girl stand with me i'm done i'm done
[2:46:12] let's let's finish this real quick he
[2:46:14] said you always get care you get scared
[2:46:16] right
[2:46:17] a lot of times things will frighten you
[2:46:19] dogs or something like that
[2:46:21] you make a noise i see you coming home
[2:46:22] from school you was running home by a
[2:46:24] dog one time
[2:46:25] that makes you real nervous
[2:46:27] you always feel that way
[2:46:30] you're the deep thank you kind always
[2:46:32] upset
[2:46:33] crossing bridges before you get to them
[2:46:35] is that right
[2:46:37] but you're healed now
[2:46:38] you can go home and eat your supper and
[2:46:40] be well in the name of the lord jesus
[2:46:42] he says god bless you
[2:46:44] he said but go home
[2:46:46] being happy singing
[2:46:48] and rejoicing amen
[2:46:50] why he saw that nature with that person
[2:46:52] he was deep thinker so this side of the
[2:46:55] brain is always active it's always going
[2:46:57] it's always
[2:46:58] something's always moving you ever see
[2:47:00] people like that they can't even have a
[2:47:01] normal conversation with you because
[2:47:02] they jump from seven to seven seven
[2:47:04] seven we call it adhd i call it people
[2:47:07] that aren't trained enough to keep their
[2:47:08] brain when they need to keep it
[2:47:12] if that's the case almost every person
[2:47:14] in the world is adhd nowadays
[2:47:17] i believe there's a real case of it no
[2:47:18] doubt for some people their problem is
[2:47:20] they don't have enough discipline in
[2:47:21] them to sit down and think
[2:47:23] they're so used to video games and 10
[2:47:25] second commercials and everything like
[2:47:26] that they expect life to be the same way
[2:47:28] they watch it on a video to youtube or
[2:47:30] youtube or some of that kind of stuff
[2:47:33] nowadays and again you click on youtube
[2:47:35] has got that 30 second little commercial
[2:47:37] it likes to kill some of us
[2:47:39] we can't we're hoping and praying to god
[2:47:41] they put that skip commercial thing on
[2:47:43] there that you can click it off in three
[2:47:45] seconds to get right down to the thing
[2:47:46] and so we sit down and try to go through
[2:47:48] life that very same way chop chomp chomp
[2:47:49] chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp the devil
[2:47:51] sees that
[2:47:53] he sees it you're in a rush and a gush
[2:47:54] and a push
[2:47:55] all that all the time so he knows that
[2:47:58] if he can keep this part of your brain
[2:47:59] working all the time that you're
[2:48:01] constantly rushing you're constantly
[2:48:03] pushing and you never get yourself a
[2:48:05] rest
[2:48:06] and when you start getting down in your
[2:48:08] health
[2:48:08] and you start getting weak you don't
[2:48:10] serve the lord like you used to yes sir
[2:48:12] yes sir right
[2:48:14] you
[2:48:16] all that but you just cannot put forth
[2:48:18] the efforts that you used to
[2:48:19] why because your whole system is so
[2:48:22] fatigued that you absolutely cannot keep
[2:48:24] up with the pace
[2:48:26] so god give us music in this
[2:48:28] to give this part of our brain a break
[2:48:30] from time to time
[2:48:31] i'm gonna tell you something i have
[2:48:33] applied this to my life brother jesse
[2:48:36] i have this has revolutionized my life
[2:48:39] because i happen to be one of these type
[2:48:41] of guys
[2:48:42] always thinking i wake up more my wife
[2:48:44] said you sleep so no i worked all night
[2:48:48] that's true
[2:48:49] my brain never rest
[2:48:51] always one thing another another another
[2:48:54] all the time
[2:48:55] david said cry loud on your beds it
[2:48:57] wouldn't hurt us to have some singing
[2:48:59] and thanks before we went to sleep
[2:49:01] relax our mind and get us in that quiet
[2:49:03] tight mode where our brain begins
[2:49:04] shutting down and entering into the
[2:49:06] subconscious arrest
[2:49:09] technology has gotten slower they say
[2:49:10] even that little light from your phone
[2:49:12] looking at it an hour before you go to
[2:49:14] sleep so disrupts your brain waves that
[2:49:16] you can't have perfect rest don't you
[2:49:18] see what the devil's doing he is working
[2:49:20] his best to get a people of lady osea
[2:49:23] that is nothing but fatigue people
[2:49:26] fatigued tired people that's why they
[2:49:28] don't have time for the gospel they
[2:49:30] don't have time for revivals they don't
[2:49:32] have time to read the bible because
[2:49:33] they're always exhausted and that's his
[2:49:36] trick
[2:49:37] yes sir yes sir so god give us the
[2:49:39] ability
[2:49:40] to give our brain a break
[2:49:48] oh my thank you lord jesus
[2:49:50] how do you do lady now this won't hurt
[2:49:52] you that's the holy spirit
[2:49:55] such a wonderful anointing he said it
[2:49:56] turns dark around the woman as i see her
[2:49:58] moving in some doctor's office they keep
[2:50:01] shaking their head they don't know
[2:50:02] what's wrong with her but he knows your
[2:50:04] main trouble is nervous it's a spasm
[2:50:06] like the nerves causing you to feel
[2:50:07] horrible all the time they can't find it
[2:50:09] because it's a devil their instruments
[2:50:11] won't show a spirit they might have hid
[2:50:13] from the x-ray he might have but he
[2:50:15] can't hide from god
[2:50:17] god looks right through him now lady
[2:50:19] you don't know me but you've had an up
[2:50:21] and down life all the time you desired a
[2:50:23] deeper life of god desired a deeper
[2:50:25] study with god to live for him because
[2:50:27] you've had your troubles i don't mind
[2:50:28] telling you this sounds like me
[2:50:31] this sounds like me i've always desired
[2:50:33] something deeper haven't you
[2:50:35] don't you feel the same way this woman
[2:50:36] did
[2:50:37] he said that can't be hit it's not for
[2:50:39] this audience to know you've had your
[2:50:40] troubles that's the point you've got to
[2:50:41] die but will you take my advice as this
[2:50:44] prophet
[2:50:45] go out of here tonight happy
[2:50:48] listen it makes it sound like an
[2:50:50] automatic thing it's very next words go
[2:50:52] out singing
[2:50:53] go out rejoicing
[2:50:55] and forget that it ever happened to you
[2:50:59] and you'll be well tell me how you're
[2:51:01] supposed to forget
[2:51:02] something that's been a main struggle
[2:51:04] all your life
[2:51:06] how are you supposed to
[2:51:07] forget it
[2:51:08] you shut it off
[2:51:11] you shut it off
[2:51:13] every time the devil brings it up you
[2:51:14] say
[2:51:15] i'm gonna make it one day amen every
[2:51:18] time the devil throws it back in your
[2:51:20] mind says hear me
[2:51:22] sing grace i sleep you say but i'm not a
[2:51:25] good singer that's all right maybe your
[2:51:27] scale of singing doesn't fit in with a
[2:51:28] scale that me and sister would play over
[2:51:30] here
[2:51:30] but the bible said every sound has a
[2:51:32] distinct sound
[2:51:34] so maybe it doesn't fit into our earthly
[2:51:35] scale but i'm sure it fits into his
[2:51:37] heavenly scale if there's someone else
[2:51:39] because every sound fits in so you may
[2:51:41] not be right on the note but i'm sure it
[2:51:43] fits into his notes somewhere
[2:51:56] how do you forget it shut this part of
[2:51:59] your brain off
[2:52:00] and open this part up let the holy
[2:52:02] spirit let him move into your
[2:52:04] subconscious and do things for you
[2:52:07] oh my let's pray together
[2:52:09] lord jesus thank you for your word
[2:52:11] tonight
[2:52:12] lord god i'm so so privileged
[2:52:16] to hear the things that i get to hear
[2:52:17] tonight
[2:52:18] lord not because of me preaching it lord
[2:52:21] be foolish for me to think that even
[2:52:22] comes from me in the first place but
[2:52:24] lord because of what i hear you say
[2:52:26] through my mouth but i hear out of your
[2:52:28] word
[2:52:29] thank you for it
[2:52:31] thank you lord jesus
[2:52:33] it's such a wonderful privilege lord to
[2:52:35] be gathered under the auspices of your
[2:52:37] presence
[2:52:38] thank you father
[2:52:40] for everything that you've accomplished
[2:52:41] here tonight
[2:52:42] lord jesus
[2:52:44] lord i've preached this out here to your
[2:52:46] children
[2:52:47] i know the devil is standing right there
[2:52:48] trying to steal us out of their hearts
[2:52:50] but lord it's the truth
[2:52:52] and i pray that you seal it into them
[2:52:54] sealing into them lord god that the
[2:52:55] devil can't get over to it with the
[2:52:57] blood of christ around these teachings
[2:52:59] tonight
[2:53:00] lord may they just bring forth fruit 30
[2:53:02] 60 80 100 140 whatever the
[2:53:06] outcome may be just let it bring forth
[2:53:08] fruit yes lord jesus
[2:53:10] help us to learn
[2:53:12] how to give our minds a break
[2:53:14] help us lord
[2:53:16] father so much confuses and bothers and
[2:53:19] torments us
[2:53:20] but lord if you'll help us
[2:53:23] we'll learn how to rest ourselves from
[2:53:24] time to time
[2:53:26] i thank you
[2:53:27] for this little sermon
[2:53:29] not just tonight but i mean the sermon
[2:53:31] itself
[2:53:33] lord as you saw we had just a great
[2:53:34] great great shake up here this the other
[2:53:36] night back at total church
[2:53:38] some real troubles come up
[2:53:40] lord jesus
[2:53:42] normally
[2:53:43] that would have tore me all to pieces
[2:53:45] but lord because my mind was rested
[2:53:48] i've been able to take it
[2:53:49] it's been not really that big of a
[2:53:51] problem to me grieved and bothered by
[2:53:53] certain people yes
[2:53:55] offended by certain things that have
[2:53:57] been done and said lord hurt for people
[2:53:59] that aren't living right sure
[2:54:02] but lord i was amazed
[2:54:03] at how much easier i was able to take
[2:54:06] this
[2:54:06] because i've been applying this
[2:54:08] sermon to my life
[2:54:10] god if it can do that for me what can it
[2:54:13] do for mothers what can it do for
[2:54:14] fathers for workers for husbands wives
[2:54:18] might what could it do for young people
[2:54:20] what can it do for all of us if we would
[2:54:22] learn to take the pressure off of us
[2:54:25] as your prophet taught us there is a
[2:54:27] place that the bride could go to learn
[2:54:29] to let off the pressure lord i think we
[2:54:32] found an answer tonight and how to get
[2:54:35] free from some of these things i pray
[2:54:37] you'd help us
[2:54:38] help us lord in the name of jesus christ

[3:02:24] [Music]
[3:02:28] that was a tremendous message amen that
[3:02:32] was the absolute masterpiece
[3:02:36] you know a few weeks ago you remember
[3:02:37] when i preached on the anchor the soul
[3:02:38] on the wednesday night remember that
[3:02:41] i ended with showing how nervous this is
[3:02:43] what got sister bruce thinking she
[3:02:45] wasn't born again it was just
[3:02:47] nervousness brother branham said you
[3:02:48] think of one thing and you focus on it
[3:02:50] over and over that's good when you go to
[3:02:52] pray for people that's bad
[3:02:54] when you start doubting your testimony
[3:02:58] that was just a few weeks ago
[3:03:00] any brother said that's worse than
[3:03:02] cancer yeah being a nervous person
[3:03:05] i'm worried about everything all these
[3:03:07] things
[3:03:09] i thought was so beautiful i just i just
[3:03:10] listened to that day on calvary on
[3:03:12] easter
[3:03:13] i remember brother
[3:03:14] everybody had to get this car installed
[3:03:16] down the road just to relax
[3:03:18] and i preached out here before
[3:03:21] church it's a it's
[3:03:23] the grace of god
[3:03:26] i just want to say a few things when you
[3:03:28] when we stop thinking about it it's
[3:03:31] casting our cares upon the lord casting
[3:03:34] those thoughts upon the lord and just
[3:03:36] letting the other side just relax in his
[3:03:38] grace and his mercy at church i know we
[3:03:40] got a lot of deep thinkers in here
[3:03:42] [Music]
[3:03:44] the church said
[3:03:46] some people are more happy-go-lucky they
[3:03:48] don't ever worry about too much things
[3:03:50] but some people we really think about
[3:03:51] and analyze a lot of things in life
[3:03:54] that was for us tonight
[3:03:56] [Music]
[3:04:00] and if that's you you really need to
[3:04:02] take that to heart
[3:04:05] [Music]
[3:04:06] i'll be honest i'm more happy kind of go
[3:04:08] lucky person i don't really analyze a
[3:04:10] whole lot of things
[3:04:11] even as a teacher i've learned
[3:04:13] i learned things but
[3:04:15] i've always thought my mind you can't
[3:04:17] get to
[3:04:18] make all these plans and they don't come
[3:04:19] to pass
[3:04:21] because the problems come up
[3:04:23] i've learned to try to balance a little
[3:04:25] bit of planning but
[3:04:27] also ready to just go off and do
[3:04:29] whatever you need to do to meet the need
[3:04:31] of the hour
[3:04:33] but i know there's some of us that just
[3:04:34] analyze everything
[3:04:37] we've got to be able to balance that
[3:04:40] this word was for us praise god
[3:04:42] for all of us
[3:04:44] but especially those of us who
[3:04:46] go over one thing the person said that
[3:04:49] but what about that this morning and
[3:04:50] just go over and over and run it through
[3:04:52] our minds
[3:04:54] as a pastor i battle that because
[3:04:55] sometimes i get emails
[3:04:57] uh you know from people that leave the
[3:04:58] messenger you know you know you people
[3:05:00] especially especially on youtube i get
[3:05:02] all kinds of things and if i'm not
[3:05:04] careful i'll stew over that question all
[3:05:06] day or they criticize me and say you
[3:05:08] idiot or you you listen if i'm not
[3:05:11] careful
[3:05:12] that that's when i get hurt and then say
[3:05:14] knows what he's doing too
[3:05:16] when i feel like i've failed somebody
[3:05:18] that's when i get hurt oh man if i don't
[3:05:21] release that care and cast it upon the
[3:05:23] lord i don't get me
[3:05:24] and i'm not even that deep
[3:05:28] that my makeup
[3:05:30] but how many grateful that the word in
[3:05:31] due season comes when we need to burst
[3:05:34] apparently god thought it that we needed
[3:05:36] this message tonight
[3:05:38] that you would be here
[3:05:40] and i would be here
[3:05:43] i was just telling my wife you found
[3:05:44] this beautiful accused acoustic music on
[3:05:47] itunes
[3:05:48] of this christian man his lyrics are all
[3:05:50] about the bride he's not even a
[3:05:51] messenger believer
[3:05:53] it's about going ascending up to god in
[3:05:55] the holy city and worshiping when the
[3:05:57] gates open into some of the most
[3:05:59] beautiful music and i'll just lay the
[3:06:01] episode and turn that music on just pray
[3:06:02] i'll just start weeping and crying
[3:06:05] just enjoying prayer again
[3:06:08] because of the beautiful the skillful
[3:06:09] remember the skillful play
[3:06:12] play
[3:06:12] the interest with skillful play
[3:06:15] and then words that mean something as
[3:06:17] brother ben said not just a chant and uh
[3:06:20] over and over but words that have deep
[3:06:22] meaning to them
[3:06:24] about the bride and the rapture and all
[3:06:26] gathered scene jesus and lay throwing
[3:06:28] our crowns at the feet of jesus it has
[3:06:31] been so refreshing to me
[3:06:33] and that has spoken to me
[3:06:35] and the bible said they'll keep thou
[3:06:37] will keep him in perfect peace whose
[3:06:39] mind is stayed on thee
[3:06:41] not stayed on our problems
[3:06:43] but stayed on the songs and the worship
[3:06:45] and the glory of god
[3:06:47] i'm really grateful for the scripture
[3:06:50] that's just our heads i just want to ask
[3:06:52] one more time
[3:06:53] i don't even say brother jess pray for
[3:06:55] me i'm that kind of a person i just
[3:06:58] worry and i cross bridges before i
[3:06:59] analyze everything pray for me that god
[3:07:02] will help me to sing in those times god
[3:07:05] bless those hands i'll pray for you you
[3:07:07] pray for me i get discouraged when i
[3:07:08] feel like i fail people

[3:07:12] fruit in my life or the ministry or
[3:07:13] something like that
[3:07:15] you pray for me pray for others that you
[3:07:17] know you're not looking around but

[3:07:24] this message was for us

[3:07:30] stewing over things
[3:07:32] crossing bridges trying to make our
[3:07:34] plans
