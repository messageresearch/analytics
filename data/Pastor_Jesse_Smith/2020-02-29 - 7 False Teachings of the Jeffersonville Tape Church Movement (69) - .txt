TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to overview my upcoming video series that will discern by the Bible seven false teachings of the tape church movement whose headquarters is in Jeffersonville Indiana USA I'll start with some important background information as a pastor I've been deeply concerned about the Jeffersonville false doctrine for over 15 years but in the past four or five years it's really increased I have reached out to multiple people in Jeffersonville to have kind brother Lee conversation about these subjects sharing quotes and scriptures through email and also sharing an 18-minute private YouTube video with brother branham's two sons but up to this time it seems no one wants to discuss my concerns about the Jeffersonville teachings I hope to soon hear back from my friends in Jeffersonville so we can have these important discussions in brotherly love please know these videos are made with brotherly kindness and respect in hopes that they will help those in Jeffersonville and anyone influenced by them to return from error to the truth and will also help those unsure about the teachings of the tape church movement to rest only on the Word of God no doubt there are many sweet sincere people in the tape church movement I want everyone to feel my brolly kindness in this video series also I believe William Branham was a genuine prophet of God whose ministry God used to fulfill revelation 10 7 Malachi 4 5 and 6 and Luke 17 30 I believe he is the final and seventh angel or church age messenger of revelation 3:14 I give brother Branham respect and honor as scripture commands that we should give to all prophets and even all Christians according to first Timothy 5:17 and first Peter 2:17 but I do not exalt or worship brother branham this video series then seeks to magnify Jesus Christ above brother Branham and every other man or woman only Christ deserves our praise and highest honor summary of jeffersonville teachings here are seven false doctrines of the tape church movement the Bible proves these teachings from its leadership are sincerely wrong be assured that I've saved audio recordings of all these false teachings number one it's wrong to say every word the late William Branham said was thus saith the Lord Jeffersonville leadership teaches quote I believe everything brother Branham says is thus saith the Lord I believe everything the Prophet says that it is the truth of God to me and you whether we want to accept it or not end quote the tape church movement believes every word brother Branham said was thus saith the Lord which is a form of idolatry because it makes brother Branham infallible no prophet including Moses Isaiah and Ezekiel spoke every word with thus saith the Lord it's true though that a genuine prophet is infallible when he says thus saith the LORD which is one of the qualifications for a genuine prophet he must foretell something and it must come to pass brother Branham meets this requirement please see this video called three prophecies of William Branham second it's wrong to say william branham and his tape recordings are the absolute Jeffersonville leadership teaches quote I believe everything brother branham says is thus saith the Lord this message has to be my absolute I believe everything the Prophet says that it is the truth of God to me and you whether we want to accept it or not end quote this is a form of idolatry as well because God's absolute is his word the Bible because heaven and earth shall pass away but Jesus's words shall never pass away third it's wrong to teach others to have blind faith in and unquestionably believe every word William Branham said Jeffersonville leadership teaches quote we don't care what says on them tapes we believe it I don't have to explain it I don't have to understand it I just have to believe it you don't know what the truth is unless you listen to the tapes end quote again this is a form of idolatry because the Bible commands us to prove all things try every spirit and search the Scriptures daily to decide the truth about what is being preached forth it's wrong to say the token or baptism of the Holy Ghost is two things it is not it is not the audio recordings of William Branham and second it's not the state of being a tape Church Jeffersonville leadership teaches quote they preachers got to catch the vision you got to play the tapes you've got to amen they're the token and quote she Rahab had to show her token she said I am a tape Church that's the token I'd say it's real important to say that we are a tape Church end quote this is limiting God by making a tradition of men or man-made Creed the evidence of being born again is not owning a collection of audio mp3 files nor is it a habit of playing those audio files at your physical church gathering location Jesus says the evidence of the Holy Ghost baptism is being taught and guided into all truth by the Holy Ghost according to John 14:26 in John 16:13 fifth it's wrong to declare William branham's youngest son as a prophet even if his father hoped he would be a prophet without any proof of him fulfilling the Bible's requirements for a genuine prophet this is the sin of pride exalting a man brother randoms youngest son to a position to which there is no proof of his being qualified for the Bible says proof of being a prophet is accurately foretelling the future according Deuteronomy 18 22 and revealing God's secrets according to Amos 3:7 I've asked two close friends of brother branham's youngest son for any evidence of the son being a prophet and the only proof I was given was that he discerned a person's sinful actions discernment is indeed one of the nine gifts of the spirit but not the Bible proof of being a prophet from Deuteronomy 18:20 2 and Amos 3:7 perhaps if brother branham's youngest son foretells a future event and speaks it with us saith the Lord and he will begin to be considered as being a genuine prophet but until then he cannot be emphatically declared as a prophet sixth it's wrong to make a tape Church mandate meaning every Church should play the audio recordings of William Branham instead of having their pastor or evangelist or teachers preach because it deletes three folds of the fivefold ministry and we are not to take away one word of God Jeffersonville leadership teaches quote every Church in this message if you claim to believe this message one two or not your a tape Church if you believe this message you're a tape Church it's just the way it is there's men of God that have true callings of God on their lives they preach this message with all their heart but they got to catch the vision you got to play the tapes you've got to Amen they're the token and quote this is again the sin of pride as it exalts man's thinking above God's Word the Bible mandate for churches is for living men to preach God's Living Word commissioned by Jesus Christ himself in Matthew 28:19 and twenty mark 16:15 and Ephesians four verses 7 to 16 seventh it's wrong to redefine the fivefold ministry because it adds to and takes away from the Word of God Jeffersonville leadership teaches quote the correct way for the fivefold his or Joshua's messengers Tait boys were what the fivefold ministry that fivefold ministry went in they're being told what to do so that's the fivefold ministry what did the true fivefold ministry preach then they played her Rahab a tape that's what the fivefold ministry's supposed to do end quote the tape church movement adds tape boys men who try to start new churches by playing audio sermons of William Branham but they themselves do not preach into the fivefold ministry which replaces or deletes or even redefines pastors evangelists teachers and apostles who preach the gospel of Jesus Christ in closing I hope you'll view this video series in its entirety so that you can know the truth and hopefully help someone else to believe the truth about the Ministry of God's profit brother Branham again brother Branham is a definite genuine prophet of God and I believe that with all my heart if you have any questions or concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and make Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
