TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but to me the Bible is the infallible word of Goden and I believe that God has watched over his word that there's not one punctuation out of place greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ welcome to part three of the Bible versions podcast my brother cam Smith and I have been working on this podcast series has aimed to raise our faith that God has one perfect infallible translation of the Holy scriptures and that's the King James version Bible by the grace of God just as God promised in Psalm 12: 6 and 7 I'll read those now the words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of Earth purified seven times Thou shalt keep them oh Lord Thou shalt preserve them from this generation forever so truly it is thus sayith the Lord that God is going to preserve his pure words in every generation so there must be a pure translation with pure words and we believe that's the King James version Bible by the grace of the Lord so here in part three we're going to look at five more verses that God has helped brother cam to find throughout his studies over the past few years comparing false translations with the true translation the King James version Bible the first scripture will be revelation 22: vers 18 the second scripture will be acts 238 the third scripture will be Revelation 1:20 the fourth scripture will be Revelation 2 and6 and also Revelation 2:15 and the final scripture will be Genesis 6:2 so notice the attacks of the enemy on the pure word of God here in part three with Revelation 22:18 Satan will be attacking the Holiness of scripture and the severe punishment for those who take away from the word Satan wants to try to lessen that punishment second the attack on acts 238 is really an attack on the three works of grace and the baptism of the Holy Ghost third the attack on Revelation 1:20 is an attack on the seventh angel brother brandom and of course the other six Church age Messengers the fourth scripture Revelation 2:6 and then Revelation 2:17 is again attack on the seven Church ages and Jesus's hatred against the Antichrist spirit so the enemy is trying to lessen Jesus's hatred on the Antichrist spirit and then Fifth and finally it's Satan's attack on the serpent seed Satan has tried to convince some people that the Nephilim were the result of angels marrying human women of course that's a lie the real truth is the truth of the serpent seed as God revealed to his Prophet brother William brandham so friends I trust you'll really enjoy this podcast here it's a deep dive into the scriptures by the grace of God and remember part two if you haven't listened to that I encourage you to listen to that where Satan attacked Matthew 4:4 that was an attack on living by every word and loving Jesus by obeying every word of God Satan attacked Revelation 10:7 that's an attack on our seventh Church age messenger so we see another attack on the seven Church age messenger in part two Satan also attacked Genesis 4: 1 and 2 another attack on serpent seed and then Satan attacked the measure of equality with God the baptism of the Holy Ghost in Philippians 2: 5-7 Colossians 1:26 and 7 and 1 John 3:9 and lastly from part two s attacked hair length 1 Corinthians 11 1-16 also friends recall that I do believe people can get saved with the false translations because there is a lot of Truth in there regarding salvation but I don't believe those people reading from false translations can ever get to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the revelation of the message of this hour because Jesus said in John 16:13 the Holy Ghost will guide you into all truth so if people are trusting in a false translation they're not going to have the full truth of God's word so God can't lead them any deeper into the word of God because all these major doctrines foundational Bible truths especially on the baptism of the Holy Ghost are all attacked by Satan in these false translations so again friends remember God's word cannot fail Psalms 126 and 7 says God has to preserve his pure words in every generation and this podcast has helped show that that Satan has perverted many of the words of God now we're up to 10 scriptures that Satan has attacked trying to get the people to believe some false teachings some false doctrines but God's bride will be in the word all the way as brother Ram said in the church age book that's one of the signs she's baptized with the Holy Ghost she's in the word all the way make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed multitudes fail right there and when they fail to go on in that word their names are taken off the book of life and also at the end of this podcast I put those four or five quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham that I put in part one brother R said a genuine faith in God will never add or take away from the word of God so think about that friends all these false translations have words taken away brother Bram said if you had genuine Faith you wouldn't do that in the next quote brother Bram said he wanted to teach exactly the way it is in the Bible not one word taken away not one word added so that's what we aim to do and the third quote brother Ram said he preached what Paul preached exactly the way Paul preached it so that means every word he believed every word Paul wrote preach it the same and yet these false translations take many words of Paul away and that last quote from spoken word original seed that's one of my favorites March 1962 brother random said faith can only take its resting place in the word of God and brother brandom said the Bible is the infallible word of God God has watched over his word there's not one punctuation out of place so I believe that as well and I know there's quotes from Brother brandom different quotes on both sides so what do we do we go back to the word of God and that's where Psalm 12:6 and7 is so important also revelation 22 18- 19 we live by every word of God every word is pure God will preserve his words God has and he will continue to preserve his word for every generation so now let's get into part three we're thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ revealing his truth to us also I'm very thankful for my brother Cam doing these studies over the years truly I can see it was the Holy Ghost guiding brother cam to study this topic because we see all these attacks from Satan on the true word of God attacking the seven Church age messenger the baptism of the Holy Ghost serpent seed hair length all the these very important topics by the grace of God so hope you enjoy part three friends please let me know if you have any questions or concerns God bless you God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your host Pastor Jesse Smith in today's podcast we're going to do a part three on the Bible versions debate and we've had the privilege of having my brother in the natural and the spiritual Pastor Cameron Smith with us on the first two podcast and he's again joining us here on the third podcast as well just a reminder the first podcast we looked at a very brief but powerful history on the Bible versions debate and then in the second part we covered five topics Bible topics that modern Bible versions pervert or change and we know if anyone's trying to pervert or change the word of God that would be Satan and they were the first one was living by every word of God from Matthew 4:4 and then the second one is Revelation 10:7 the verse about our Prophet The Late William Marin brandham third was serpent seed out of Genesis CH 41 and two and the fourth was our equality with God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost a measure of the Holy Ghost uh in Philippians chapter 2 and Colossians 1: 26 and 27 and the fifth and final topic was hair lengths from 1 Corinthians 11: 1-16 so we're excited for this uh recording here by God's grace we'll try try to cover as many uh topics as we can in about an hour and an hour and a half and after the edits it might be down to 45 minutes or more we'll kind of see how that goes we're just excited to record again and remember a very powerful statement brother Cam said in the last podcast was that why would message Believers want to use a Bible that actually attacks the messenger in reference to Revelation 10: 7 so that was just I felt a very inspired statement inspired of the Holy Spirit uh if God has sent us a prophet to finish the mystery of God why would we want to use a Bible that attacks his ministry and actually changes revelation 10:7 of course we wouldn't uh we believe what the Bible says in Psalms 12:7 Thou shalt keep them oh Lord speaking of the words of God Thou shalt preserve them from this generation forever and so Cam and I were talking before this podcast recording just if there is no Bible currently that is a perfect infallible perfect inter ation of the word of God then God's promise in Psalm 12:7 has failed but we know it cannot fail the word of God is forever settled in heaven and God will move all Heaven and Earth just to fulfill one of his words of promise and of course every word of God will be fulfilled so with that I'm going to hand it over to brother cam he can just give us an introduction or kind of give us his initial thoughts before we get into these uh topics here by the grace of God it's so wonderful to have our brother back so brother cam we love you God bless you and uh we're excited to have you back all right God bless you brother Jesse uh thanks for having us once again um we appreciate the Lord's uh opportunity to to do this again uh knowing that uh uh this is actually a very very important topic uh to all believers not just message Believers but uh all those who believe in the Bible and uh you know as we've covered in the last uh uh two podcasts we we find that it was actually uh it was actually a move of the the devil to always pervert the word and uh the issue is if you have many different um words that are different that are placed in Bibles you come into different doctrines you come into different understandings and uh what that means is that now there's almost like if you could say a kaleidoscope of different ways that you could come to God instead of one way uh and that's as you opened up that's exactly what we're looking at we're looking at a God who actually gave us an interpretation that's perfect with that King James Bible so that we can all come the common way and uh that's kind of what we're looking at uh in regards to making it to eternal life there has to be a way Jesus Christ said in John 14:6 I am the way the truth and life no man come to the father but by me so who is this Christ who is this Jesus uh John 1:1 says that in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God so Jesus was that word so uh how can we say that Jesus being the word uh that there would be many different understandings of who he is so now that you actually see that Christ is the word how can it be so sporadic how can it be so different with so many different um takes that you can take on it so many different ways to Christ uh when Jesus is single uh he's a person just like you or I uh he has a specific resemblance of who he is and that's what we see in his word so as you opened up with brother in mark 13:31 it says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away and uh the word of God has the ability not even as the Heaven and the Earth uh does because the Heaven and Earth can pass away but God's word can never pass away and in opening and understanding this uh in proverbs 30 uh verse 5 it says every word of God is pure uh he is a Shield unto them that put their trust in him add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar so notice God gives These Warnings in his Bible about adding or taking away from the word and with great reason because uh that is what we have watched over thousands of years of human existence is as God re has revealed himself in written language by his word uh there have been those who have altered that or changed that uh from a human perspective from the leading of the devil uh to try to pervert who God is and uh God doesn't like that so of course uh there's repercussions for that now in Deuteronomy 4:2 it says ye shall not add unto the word which I command you uh neither shall you diminish ought from it that you may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you uh so the area brother if it's possible what we'd like to do is uh begin to go uh and show a few of these little changes and let's see if they actually make a difference in how we believe or U maybe it would make it stronger towards a judgment or it would make it something that we would be a little bit more fearful of as we approach our uh our entrusting our Salvation to Jesus Christ so uh with that uh I hit the ampi a lot the ampi Bible was actually written by a presbyterian minister's wife um and she interpreted the Old Testament and uh of course the way that they have tried to portray the Amplified Bible as they have actually tried to say that um it actually uh they actually try to make sense of the Greek words and with a better understanding of the Greek words okay now uh you can better serve Jesus Christ because you know more uh the Amplified Bible has actually become very important uh uh to many preachers in the message circles uh but uh in a careful observance I think that we can see that there's actually some issues there let's start with an example here uh let's go into the King James Bible to Revelations 22:18 and 19 and I I want to hit this area because this is of course very important about what we do with the word of God uh it was actually the serpent that took one word out and it caused all the pain and suffering our our hair falling out our gray hair our uh our our inability to to speak all uh our inability to live right uh and all that actually came from twisting one word of God uh so in Revelations 22 the very end of the Bible um it says in the 18th verse for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book so if we were going to move to the Amplified Bible uh let's take a look and see what that would say in Revelations 20218 it says uh I testify and warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book uh and of course it it does a lot with brackets trying to explain words it says it's predictions consolations and admonitions uh if he adds anything to them God will add to him the plagues or afflictions calamities which are written in this book now listen this this gets very interesting it says and if any one takes away from or distorts the words of the book of this prophecy God will take away from that one his share from the Tree of Life and from the holy city New Jerusalem which are written in this book uh so here it is the the warning about adding and taking away in the King James Bible it tells us that if if any man would take away from the words of this prophecy God is going to take away his part out of the book of life he'll be blotted out of The Book of Life uh which means what there's nothing left but damnation uh but the Amplified actually changes that and it says if anyone takes away or distorts from the words of this book of this prophecy that he will only lose his share from the tree of life it's a huge difference so now where one would actually uh say wow I'm going to get cast into the Lake of Fire if I uh if I take away and distort the word from this book now the aite actually changes it and says you're only going to lose your share his share from the Tree of Life not the Book of Life the Tree of Life um now why is that important because remember uh working with serpent seed and the in the original creation um there was a tree of life there but nominal Christianity believes that that tree of life was an actual tree there's been much debate over it whether it be apple apricot pear but they believe that uh Eve ate a natural fruit and therefore um that caused all the fall which for some reason and somehow that showed them that they were naked uh so here it it is it is completely lessen so I'm just going to lose a couple bites out of a fruit that's all I'm going to lose out of this so a very good difference as we begin this brother wow brother that's an amazing verse you know again I just I can I Can See Clearly how the Holy Ghost has anointed you to spend time you know and even has directed you brother cam to go to these certain topics this is an amazing perversion of the word of God because it allows these people who take away from the Bible the true Bible version it allows them to have eternal life just lose a little bit of reward or use or lose a little bit of partaking of some uh spiritual benefits in the future home but in reality God takes away eternal life they do not get eternal life because we know verses like uh Revelation 13:8 say that having your name in the book of life means you have eternal life and if your name's not in there then you don't have eternal life you'll worship the Beast system so Revelation 138 says all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so this is such a perversion of God's word in the Amplified Bible and just returns us as brother Cam said so wonderfully returns us to the fear of the Lord we should fear God so much of course with love but also with reverence uh we must keep the fear of the Lord and not add one word to God's word nor take it away that's what the bride of Christ will do we know Jesus had that anointing of the fear of the Lord in the book of Isaiah says that he had all those anointings that's what we need we want to reverence every word of God respect every word of God so great one to start with brother cam that's the sixth one it's a much lesser punishment for taking away the words of God but we know there is an eternal damnation for taking away words of God it's taking your name out of The Book of Life so as we continue uh you're going to find that uh sometimes it's just one word and it's amazing because it's literally right back uh to the Book of Genesis and how this all started out and uh the individuals who are interpreting these Bibles uh of course by copyright they have to change it a little bit they have to make it different um but sometimes the way they change it it it's actually making a tremendous distinction between truth and false uh let me do this so uh of course one of the greatest and most important things to our faith uh of course is the revelation of water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ it is of course by the scripture uh it is the pathway uh to receive the Holy Spirit um but once again I want to head a little Direction with that that Amplified Bible and I'm I'm going to work just with acts 238 here so here it is you know the Holy Spirit falls on them um and and everyone's like okay they're drunk and Peter said it's only the third hour of the day we're not drunk this is that which was spoken of by Prophet Joel right and uh you know he of course brings them to the place where okay uh they say to Peter they said men and Brethren what shall we do and Peter says in Acts 238 he says then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ now here it is one word for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost all right amen so now I'm going to take you back to the Amplified because this is what a lot of message Believers are believing this is what they're reading now to to give them a better understanding of the Bible uh it says in the Amplified it says Peter said to them reent brackets change your old way of thinking turn from your sinful ways accept and follow Jesus as the Messiah and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ but watch this it says because of the Forgiveness of your sins and you you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit now so so Jesus said he said whosoever believeth and is baptized shall be saved but now watch what the Amplified does so in the King James version it says be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins it joins that you need to do both of these for the remittance of your sins but in Acts 238 and the Amplified thank God it kept in be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but it says uh that you want to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because of the Forgiveness of your sins so where Jesus joined them together the Amplified now separates them and says well the only reason you're actually getting baptized is because of that forgiveness so uh what we see is there's actually a distinction where Jesus said uh he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but now we find in the Amplified that it actually says uh repent it's all done right there and then be baptized because of your forgiveness so it doesn't say that your forgiveness is linked to both it says that your forgiveness is only linked to that initial repentance where Jesus actually United them together yeah very good point you take that also with Mark 16:16 about where Jesus said you must be baptized he that believeth and is baptized AP ized shall be saved and this helps support the truth where a lot of people say well I don't need to be baptized and right the thief on the cross wasn't baptized well that's a totally different circumstance he didn't have the chance to be baptized but every other person in the book of Acts that was not on a cross had a chance to be baptized at least recorded in the scripture so yes this uh this is an awful change the Amplified is an awful change to acts 238 and remember even in Acts chapter 10 pet commanded Cornus and his house to be baptized it wasn't a suggestion you might want to do that uh it was a commandment you must be because you have the Holy Ghost again as the Bible says Jesus fulfilled all righteousness so even the Lord Jesus was baptized as an example to the Believers he didn't have to repent but of course he did it as an example and he also did it because the lamb had to be washed before being presented we know that's a type of the Old Testament The Book of Leviticus the the burnt offering had to be washed uh before it was presented so Jesus of course had to be baptized numerous reasons the Lord Jesus was baptized so we have to understand that all these scriptures tied together and uh it also requires the individual to make that decision right uh they're not getting baptized because they're forgiven they're getting baptized for forgiveness so great uh very good uh point there brother I never noticed that so anything else you want to share about that no I I think you added exactly what was needed to be said There Brother um but it it shows how it just one word one word and and it it changes the entire meaning of what's going on and uh I guess if I could add this as it's coming to my mind is that we have to remember that nominal Christianity uh not not Pentecostals but nominal Christianity Evangelical and so forth uh they believe as soon as you repent you get the Holy Ghost that's right good yes so they believe that it is not enjoined together they don't understand so when brother brandham told us about the baptism he said that when they get baptized in the name of the father son Holy Ghost they're actually getting baptized into the Catholic church so uh we understand that God actually he'll save us because we have the answer of a good conscience towards God and get baptized showing that we're bu bued with Christ and we have risen up uh in the likeness of Christ beautiful brother great points there again connecting this topic to the three works of Grace that was a very beautiful point there brother uh yeah denominations say you just got to get baptized and you get the baptism of Holy Ghost but what they do is they're wrong they all deny the three works of Grace justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost so yeah as you're talking as you're talking this reminds reminds me of the importance of free moral agency and how there's two perspectives on it there's God's perspective right and then there's our human perspective brother Ram talked about this James says you got to have faith that acts right James says uh faith without works is dead right we're saved by faith and our works and brother M tells us and I think it's F works as Faith expressed that this is from uh man's perspective James is talking about what man sees our free moral agency our faith in action so we we repent but then we get baptized in water and then because of obedience to the further commands of God we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's backed up by acts acts 5:32 God only gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him so that's why these denominational people they never get the baptism of the Holy Ghost because they don't get Sanctified uh they don't stop watching uh porn or they don't stop watching dirty movies or they uh they continue living in sin they don't get Sanctified so God's not going to fill with the Holy Ghost uh but of course brother M says the book of Romans is God's perspective you know uh we're saved by grace well of course that's Ephesians chapter 2 but the book of Romans also talks about how Abraham wasn't saved by works right James says he is saved by works and brother said they don't fight against each other they both go together because you have God's perspective and you have man's perspective right so so that brings us and that's why we're hitting the Amplified version because um if an individual is putting faith fath in a specific Bible then of course what will they do there's actually subtly being seeds implanted in them by what they're reading so they're actually setting themselves up for an opinion of man that has now been treated as if it's the word of God and what we're finding is that that's actually a doctrine that they're trying to implant in the people so I I'll do one more about the Amplified and just show that and then we'll we'll kind of get into more of the other versions as well so the next one I would like to go to is Revelations 1 120 and here's another example of the amplifi before we get moving into some other things um it says in that 20th verse it says the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the Seven golden candlesticks uh the Seven Stars are the angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches this is to show you that they're putting their preconceived Doctrine in it now the Amplified of course from a a presbyterian perspective uh them interpreting or at least one who claims to be one of them uh in the 20th verse he says as for the mystery of the Seven Stars which you saw in my right hand and the Seven golden lampstands it says the Seven Stars Are are the Angels and it has in parentheses Divine messengers of the of the seven churches and seven lampstands are the seven churches so this example here uh here they are we know what we have been taught by uh the scripture and by the prophet um and Angel is a man it can be a man it can be both uh uh from uh an angel in heaven uh it could be Jesus Christ as an angel uh but yet we have seen in the Book of Revelations how an angel could be a prophet so here uh in Revelations 1:20 we have been taught by our Prophet that those uh Seven Stars those seven angels are seven men uh who will be to each dispensation of the seven Church ages but notice in the Amplified it doesn't say that they're Messengers it says they are Divine Messengers so now it's making it completely appear as if those are Heavenly Angels uh that are going to give messages to church is and who are they where are they coming from so uh a huge distinction because now this will affect the way we believe excellent point there brother yeah I just was studying on that recently um I kind of wrote about that in my 2021 book there's four reasons why these seven angels in Revelation 120 have to be human preachers or human Messengers and the first one is the most obvious why would Jesus tell John to write a letter to a Heavenly Angel at leoda when does God ever want a human to give a message to an angel it's the other way around right God always sends the angel to tell the human something and why would a Heavenly Angel need a handwritten letter so that's just one of the four reasons that makes no sense at all um and then like you said brother you said it so right you know Paul was called an Angel by the Galatians David was called an angel uh twice once in 1st Samuel once in 2 Samuel and the word angel means a messenger so John the Baptist is called a messenger by the Lord Jesus so he's likened into an angel a burning and Shining Light right so he's a he's a man Anointed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost well John didn't have it in his soul but he had it in his Spirit he was anointed on fire preaching the word of God he was a messenger of the Covenant so excellent point there excellent point yeah so of course it affects message Doctrine exclusively to us um we have to remember that most nominal Christians have uh have been exhorted by their pastors exhorted by by these preachers that uh and I've had this witnessed to me before is that you can't understand the Book of Revelations so you can read it but don't don't expect much uh it reminds you of of when brother Brandon was dealing with that man in his his experience and and uh he was reading about John uh in the Book of Revelations and he said he must have got some hot peppers and and just kind of lost his mind and brought forth this book and brother Bram said that you know kind of rebuked him and he said he could have lost his job but uh he rebuked him and said he said that was the written word of God God that was divine that was an inspired word that God was doing so yeah it's it's very important that's awesome brother as you're talking it you know just opens up more and more um so this eighth one Revelation 1:20 that's an attack on the seven Church ages and it's also an attack on brother brandham as the seventh Church age messenger so why would we want to use a Bible the Amplified Bible if it attacks the doctrine that brother brandham gave to us of course we wouldn't and then I was reminded you know on the seventh one with acts 238 that was an attack really on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the three works of Grace so all of our core biblical Fundamental Bible revelations that God has restored at the end time are being attacked of course by Satan as he perverts the word of God and produces these false Bible translations wonderful brother right so the next example we would like to give is actually working with uh the the nanism of the four spirits of antichrist that would actually face the church and uh in Revelations 2:6 it says but in the King James uh but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nians uh which I also hate so it tells us in that Ephesus Church that they had uh this nianis uh that was actually uh something that the early church hated it's very interesting here because Jesus only says twice in the King James version in the seven Church ages of something he hates this is the first time he says it and he says he hates the Deeds of the nicians okay now the other versions are are fairly close to that but when we go to uh Revelations 2:15 a few Church ages down uh we see that coming up again and in Revelations 2:15 the King James version it says so as thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians now here it says now watch this he says which thing I hate so Jesus said in Revelations 26 he hated it the church hated it but now in Revelations 2:15 he doesn't say that the church hates it anymore but he does express and say I hate it so Jesus never changes that he hates nianis okay so in the Amplified in the 15th verse it says ye also have some who in the same way are holding to the teaching of the nicians period and IV says likewise you also have those who hold to the teaching of the nicians period so in the new versions uh it actually takes out where at first it says the church hated and Jesus hated but now in Revelations 2:15 uh the new versions actually take out that Jesus uh has that type of hatred for the nians now we of course we see in the King James the church didn't have that hatred anymore uh so this is very important because uh what we see is according to the teachings of brother brandham is that the Antichrist Spirit of organization is actually fourfold um it is given in the Deeds of nians the doctrines of the nians uh the teaching of balum and then the teaching uh of Jezebel so we see by our interpretation that brother brandham gave to us that nianis in being broken down to Greek form actually means to conquer the Ley um it is the deception uh where Man by humanism begins to blend uh a way of leading the church by his own human will and therefore deposing the spirit of Jesus Christ being the full leadership to the church now of course uh Jesus the only time he talks about nanism he says he hates it the doctrines of the nicians actually was when it became the unbending way for man to have this hybrid leadership over the church the church accepts it and there therefore uh the church is doomed because of that it it does nothing but actually causes the church to move to the next form which is balam ISM so what we see in the new versions is and and and this is why it's important to us message Believers also is because uh that is the revelation of the seals it was a white horse and then it Blends into a red horse the White Horse being deception which is exactly what nickan ISM was it was actually now taking the leadership of the Holy Spirit out of the church which that's what Jesus hates he can't even be the husband to his wife he has to share that with carnal man and Jesus doesn't want to do that he wants his leoty uh to be conquered by him to be led by him he wants his minister to be led by him but uh according to these new versions uh we see that they actually take away that Jesus hates the progression of that Antichrist Spirit wow brother that's very good yes Jesus lays out that four-step Antichrist process and this false Bible version takes out Jesus's hatred for sin so the equivalent to this would be like going to Proverbs where it says you know six things the Lord doth hate right and taking those out of the Old Testament right that would be the maybe like a Old Testament equivalent to it of course we would never do that we want to hate what God hates of course with a Divine or holy hatred uh and we want to love what God loves we want to have the heart of God we want to be a bride after the heart of the Lord Jesus and I love what you said brother Braham said it started off as a sang but then it became the unbending way right the second stage the the doctrines of the nickan the instruction of the nicotin so around the message uh we got to be very careful what new instruction people start adding to their preaching trying to make it an unbending way uh in in regards to separating the leoty from the clergy or we'd say the preachers from the congregation we got to be very careful that we don't uh add our own man-made doctrines because that would already be the second step that Jesus hates he hated the First Step At the beginning he hated just the saying of these uh false doctrines before they became doctrines so excellent point there brother I never saw that before yes and uh maybe just to add one point is uh here we are we are coming in at the very end of the disp the Gentile dispensation and uh due to that fact uh we have a different challenge perhaps than all the other ages uh because now God has actually brought the restoration of the word through the seventh angel um but here you and I uh we weren't here in the 60s we we weren't here at that time but those that actually followed uh after brother bram's passing um they have also established many different doctrines and uh of of course they are not in unity with others doctrines so it therefore puts the church into a spot it puts us preachers in a spot that we realize that there are differences so we need the leadership of the Holy H spirit because he is actually the only one who can rightfully bring us the true Revelation um so um if I could give an example uh an extreme one uh there are those who believe in polygamy and of course they get that from quotations uh while I I believe you and I and by the example of Our Lives we believe a man should have one wife uh and children and so forth um so what would make one right and one wrong well obvious ly this man that interpreted uh basically a legalizing of polygamy um even in message ranks uh he is taken on an anti- position because he doesn't have the revelation of what that is so that's what nickan is actually doing he's now bringing not just uh actions but he's also bringing it under a word interpretation to be a lord over God's people and of course what we we've seen many lives destroyed because of even that Doctrine and confusions yeah no doubt a lot of confusion a lot of uh lustful Spirits in there that's just one good example brother excellent example uh as you were talking I thought about the four-step process that works out through the church ages right you know through the the so the fourth step the depths of it was actually in that fourth Church age th tyan right but then also this four-step process it does happen in every Church age individually with every Ministry because this four-step process is also the four steps to sin and spiritual death like James 1: 1314 and 15 say God doesn't tempt any man but we can see those four steps just like the four horse riters just like the four bugs uh we can see them uh right listed here it's uh lust enticed is the first so that that would be equivalent to the the Deeds of the nicians the second would be lust conceived that would be the equivalent to the doctrine of the nicians then you have sin which would be equivalent to the doctrine of balum and then the fourth would be death which would be equivalent to the spirit of Jezebel or The Jezebel the four step The Jezebel religion so God yeah and so you stated it very plainly brother wow even since brother Bram died 1965 now from 1966 on we've seen all these people come after brother brandom and if they started their Ministries with pure hearts if they didn't protect it if they didn't keep hating the spirit of organization then these four stages would produce themselves and they'd Fall Away in those individual lives and Ministry uh but we just can't point at them we got to look at our lives too and make sure we're keeping the pure word of God so this is another great scripture brother I had never thought about this I had never heard that I never seen how the Amplified did that so excellent point there anything else you want to say on that brother well that is the what message people would like to call the Pinnacle of the Revelation that was given to us was the opening of the seals so you know this is just taking out one portion as far as just saying okay well uh he doesn't hate that anymore he doesn't like it a little bit but he doesn't hate it but uh to us it is actually this four stage horse rider is actually what destroyed the church and you said it very wonderfully um that we're all going to fight this so we need the purity of the word given by the leadership of the Holy Spirit and we need to hate especially nanism because that is the deceptive one Jezebel is not necessarily the the most deceptive Jezebel just like okay we the prophets I'm going to kill them and she put that doctrine of of of death out uh so uh yeah it's it's very important and especially for us as message Believers because you know Jesus will have an un organized bride completely uh there's a I believe there's a quote where brother BR talks about not one Speck of denominationalism so that that's what we want to be so let let us hate it like Jesus hates it Hallelujah absolutely yeah we we got to agree with every word of God it goes back to that first Doctrine you talked about you know uh Matthew 4:4 we must live by every word of God and we're not claiming uh Perfection but it's our desire of course uh we what I mean is we sin every day but it's our desire to want to fulfill every word of God to to be obedient to every word of God and like you said this is this can be very deceptive uh in message ranks or even in general churches or if they miss Satan's deception and they don't hate false doctrine that separates um you know clergy or preachers from the leoty if they don't catch that then they start becoming exalted preachers they start magnifying themselves they start calling themselves the greatest of all time which we have a video about that we've taught about that preached on that and that is a real manifestation I believe in my humble opinion that's a real manifestation that the Deeds are certainly in the works and if they if they would continue to preach Doctrine and try to use verses to support their own prideful statements then to me that would be an obvious sign that they have allowed the enemy to give them the doctrine of the nicians yeah one one more thing to add brother um the church age book goes into this which is very powerful but uh just as you were saying it it built four stages into the four Church ages um of course in the fourth Church ages it went to Jezebel but uh in the church age book it actually says that then it started going back the other way with restoration so when Jezebel was removed um then bism set in and then the doctrine of ncol uh the doctrine of Nicol they were coming out of that so our specific age is actually the age where it's so close it would deceive the elect if possible or that white horse riter as far as resisting what that is to get back to the effective word uh because that's what the church first church had so they had to be free of nianis in order to manifest the fullness of the word which we are coming to our the hearts of the children turn back to the Pentecostal fathers and the same works and power and Leadership so uh yeah it's a very important topic so but you're exactly right uh that is what uh you've done those videos um and and this is the issue is that once nickol aism is accepted they actually start if a minister in the message uh accepts nianis they go to the doctrines they go to the Deeds uh the uh excuse me the the doctrines and then they go to bmismart and so what we'll find is exactly like Jesus when Jesus was crucified it was actually those who actually stood against him those who we came to they actually became a Jezebel spirit to him to kill him off so those that will be in that ministry that's so close they themselves will turn and they will become a Jezebel spirit unto those who are actually going to the fullness of the word that's a great thought yeah that got me thinking brother uh beautiful point I had forgotten about that where the four stages now go in revers because God's restoring the church that makes total sense with Martin Luther John Wesley isua and here we are wow uh brother Ram's ministry here at the end time beautiful point there so this is again attack on the revelation of the Seven Seals great point there and then as you said that um I was thinking you know if we're being restored we'll battle that first step right the deed yes the Deeds of the nicians because we're being restored back exactly right and and that's that is the restoration because you and I we must be 100 submitted to Jesus Christ to for the leadership to take a local body into a Rapture right and that's what Enoch would have had right Enoch was raptured because he walked with God he pleased God he was pleasing in all of his deeds of course all of his Doctrine as well right right and brother one more thing too you know I thought two more things to add to that you know we're battling the Deeds right but we also have the eagle anointing to do it because of the force seal so the eagle the prophetic anointing uh feeding on the the fresh carcass Jesus said where the carcasses the Eagles would be gathered so if we have the anointing to be on the fresh word and Fly Above the things of the world we fly above the Deeds of the nians will be flying around in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and then we also have the seventh step on the Statue of perfect man brother Ram said it applies to the individual but brother R said also applies to the church age so that means brotherly brotherly kindness will be a major factor in overcoming the Deeds of nickol in so as brothers we want to love each other as sisters Brothers and Sisters in Christ we want to love each other we'll never want to divide we'll never want to put our own thoughts and opinions in it and be led by man the brotherly kindness uh inside of us by the Holy Ghost will want us to treat everyone as a a brother and sister in Christ and not exalt ourselves above others right Amen brother that's exactly right um and of course when you you get into some of that wording uh I didn't plan to go this way but uh when you look at how the the new versions actually talk about the stature of a perfect man uh so you know we would find that in uh the King James it would say brotherly kindness uh that that root word of course in the Greek is is actually Philadelphia which is Brotherly Love um but you know if you look in the NIV it doesn't say brotherly kindness it actually says Mutual affection so you see when you start changing the wordings you'll find in these different versions now your stature of a perfect man actually has exclusively changed now it's not brotherly kindness It's actually Mutual affection well that's very vague in every sense of those two words Mutual does not say brother it says Mutual so when what does that mean when you're around someone else uh you want to show affection uh so it it doesn't uh signify what the King James says because the King James says that the issue and the challenge would be amongst brothers and that the overcoming Spirit of that adding to it would be to love your brother it would be able to show them kindness and the NIV of course would change that to a mutual affection instead so it's a different uh requirement completely right that reminds me of Jesus when he was there teaching and uh his mother and the the his Brethren come and say uh we want to talk to him and said who are my brothers who's my family that these who are sitting right here with me so uh those who obey the fresh word of God the the true revelation the present truth as Peter said yeah mutual affection is so broad it's so General Jesus is referring to the brothers right like he said in Matthew 25 as you did it to the least of these my brethren you did it unto me and brother said the foolish virgin we not his Brethren uh the the Brethren are those who are born again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost again getting back to the three works of Grace justification sanctification and baptism Holy Ghost so yeah great point there brother that might be a whole another topic you know or whole another subjects that we can cover in this uh it' be great to study on the Statue of perfect man amen so this is another one brother I would love to turn here and uh this recently last several years here uh has been really big on my heart because uh there there's actually a movement that's it's been advertised actually not even advertised proclaimed to be almost this unbending Revelation that explains everything that we're dealing with and what's getting ready to happen and uh what I have found out that that this Doctrine uh of the Nephilim um is actually uh it is the perfect counterfeit to serpent seed and uh I would like to go through this in the new versions uh I I have a whole bible study on this I and actually kind of go through the history and some of the things on that uh but uh I would like to show you what the Bible says um so if you actually go into the Old Testament you'll find that uh the statement or the phrase sons of God uh it doesn't really happen a lot but in job6 the King James Bible actually says now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them okay now in the Amplified and hopefully we can go into some greater depths with this but it says now there was a day uh when the sons of God parentheses Angels Came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan uh parenthesis adversary accuser also came among them then IV says one day the Angels Came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan also came with them uh so in job6 uh we find that the King James version uh it says sons of God and and this is very important because uh what actually happened is uh there's a modern doctrine of the Nephilim uh which people actually believe that Angels came down and procreated with women uh and therefore uh created this race of Giants and uh I've heard even message believers they said brother cam there are giants hiding in the in the caverns of the Earth getting ready to come forth and uh in this Doctrine they say that at the very end time that these Giants will come out and take over the Earth and so forth um but this is what happened in Genesis 6 it talks about the condition Before the Flood and it said that the sons of God saw that the the daughters of men were fair and they took for them as wives what we find is is that the new versions are actually changing the meaning of the phrase sons of God to actually mean Angels they found all these manuscripts uh and they found out that in these ancient manuscripts soal called that they actually say sons of God are actually Angels well in our first reading in job 1:6 we find that the new versions actually tells us that sons of God are angels uh so that of course is uh not true from what we know but what they're saying is is that there's a counterfeit human hybrid race that actually has come forth uh from the procreation of angels now the scripture tells us and this is why you know a Bible believer you you'll always look at the word of God but in Hebrews 1:5 it says uh For unto which of his angels said he at any time Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and again I will be a father be to him a father and he shall be to me a son so the Bible tells us that when did he ever call an angel a son when he say unto them Thou Art my son so this Doctrine which has come forth now the new versions are actually telling us that there is this human hybrid race but we as message Believers we of course know that that actually went back to Genesis 3 uh with the Affairs that Eve had with the serpent so basically now there's a whole different doctrine that has come forth and the new versions actually are telling us that the these angels actually have a hybrid race on Earth right now amongst us which word in the English is Nephilim in the Hebrew that's what I forgot so the word Nephilim actually uh it's only stated uh I believe twice in in the Old Testament uh Nephilim uh that would be in Genesis 6 and and then it comes back around and and talks about uh the Giants uh in Joshua's time so and and looking at the land so it only says that twice but what they've done is they've actually talked about this new interpretation of that Hebrew word uh and actually it's it's Ben L so sons of God so they're actually saying that that actually means Angels though it's never interpreted that way if we had time and and like I said I did a Bible study of it but you'll find that there are other occasions in the Old Testament where these sons of God presented them themselves before God and it words that in the King James version accordingly it says they presented themselves before the Tabernacle unto God but what they do is they will uh actually now come up with this whole separate idea uh in Genesis 6 and ver first verse it says it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took wives of all which they chose and the Lord said uh my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he is also flesh yet his days shall be 120 years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them and the the same became Mighty Men which were of old men of Renown uh so now because they can interpret they interpret that these sons of God in the Book of Job are angels so they come back and say well look there were sons of God here that took Daughters of men and they produced Giants okay so when I studied this out uh because that sounds very plausible but the King James version only says sons of God well I wonder if uh Genesis 6 would actually fit with the understanding of serpent seed that we have and because we know that brother brandham told us that uh the Giants were actually a production of Cain's seed hybrid with the woman's seed uh so if you go to Genesis 64 again it says there were giants in the earth in those days and then you have your semicolon and it says and also after that when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men so it actually will back up what brother Brandon brought as serpent seed because it actually says that before the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men there were already Giants in the earth in those days so what we have is and they said it was actually the uh a Jewish sect that came up with that belief um that the Angels actually corrupted themselves with human uh women this is an attack then on the serpent seed teaching is that right brother cam absolutely because uh what what the revelation of serpent seed is it is a hybridism with the true seed of God uh with a seed that is not a son of God's seed which we understand that the serpent was created uh to be almost like man brother brandom said he was hairier he was bigger but yet appealing to Eve uh in the knowledge that he was trying to bring her which is of course uh the the advances of um of sex so what this Doctrine actually does is it tries to explain this giant hybrid race not from the serpent it actually makes it from demon Angels Fallen Angels who came down and turned somehow created a flesh for them to live in because angels are ministering spirits and created a flesh somehow which can an angel a fallen angel or even Satan create no they can only pervert we never see that Satan can create flesh uh if think about it if Satan as demons could create flesh uh wouldn't they be living right amongst us right now so uh it's not even biblical in any sense but this is what uh of course false doctrines and twisting the word of done and now the new versions have changed uh these rendering to make this the belief of how hybridism uh actually got in and caused a false genetics in the uh in in a hybrid human race that lives amongst us which we know that it was the serpent that actually came forth and brought forth his seed into Eve produced twins with Adam's seed and of course uh there we find two offsprings one of a hybrid human and the other of a son of God's seed and of course that hybrid seed of course became just like Satan he was a murderer he was a liar uh he was evil so this of course uh shows where they're trying to take the people now they're they're trying to get them they'll look and they'll say uh oh that this the serpent had uh uh sexual relations with Eve that's insanity but they'll at the same right they will say well fallen angel came down made himself a flesh and took a human woman to be his wife so that means that they had they had actually marriage processions and that angel lived on Earth with that woman and produced Giants from that well was the angel a giant there it just it just does nothing but add confusion and unanswered questions which tells you that you know God is not a bringer of confusion uh God is a bringer of Truth uh so here it is we have these things that they're putting into the newer Bible versions that were not part of the original script amen excellent observation there brother I never knew that about the Nephilim and the new Bible versions you know brother Ram said serpent seed doesn't save you he said he said but it sure does bring more light on the truth we're all trying to see so that false Bible translation I think I made a video one time on this you know uh the Nephilim is so close to the truth but so far away uh it's so clo it's so close because there is a hybrid race right it's the human race right uh so there is a hybrid between uh human and beast it's not the angel and human hybrid it's the serpent and human hybrid and uh like you said brother very well uh Genesis 3:15 it's thus sayith the Lord there's two kinds of offspring God said that it's not brother brandom it's not you or I not any other preacher God said there's hatred between uh thee The Serpent and the woman between thy seed her seed so God recognized there's two different offsprings now of course we know they've all intermarried around the time of the flood and so all of our flesh uh is born in corruption and so that's why we need we need a Heavenly birth you must be born again John chapter 3 and 1 Peter 1:23 you must be born again of The Incorruptible seed the word of God so we all need a new seed it's a spiritual seed but uh excellent point you you said it perfectly like brother brandom said it Satan is not a Creator Angels cannot create themselves a physical body to procreate with human women and yeah that's such a funny statement to think like Angels come down and had wedding processions like that's just ridiculous it it's hard to believe what these people actually believe and the depths of their confusion or deception that that they actually go to um demons can only transform like uh Paul said about Satan he transforms himself into an angel of light uh but Satan and his demons cannot create physical bodies in order to procreate or else like you said there would be a bunch of demon human hybrids here running around right now why would he stop procreating right he'd want to overtake the Earth right and kill all the Christians and and so forth like that so again excellent point brother we see this attack against serpent seed it falls flat it takes away from the word of God and we always want to stay with the word of God yeah Satan never had the ability to come in flesh himself but when uh when it came time to betray Jesus the Bible said Satan entered Judas well why wouldn't Satan just come himself as and make his own flesh he didn't do it uh then you you come down to our age where where we see that uh the Antichrist will basically he'll take leadership over the Earth well why don't Satan just come himself and do this if he's cast out of heaven so we see a great inconsistency uh with the very fact that Angels never have the ability to make or create a flesh for themselves uh and the issue is uh mainly is that from Alexandria we have what they call the Book of Enoch and and the Book of Enoch uh there was a man I believe his last name is Wy in the uh right early 1900s and he put together a book of Watchers a Book of Enoch there's there and it's actually it's called a pseudepigrapha and it's a gathering of of different writings to make one book and he made um This Book of Enoch from five different renderings of This Book of Enoch and he put them all together and made one Book of Enoch so it was never accepted by the King James fathers even though it was there uh but they also found that there was never a Hebrew rendering of the Book of Enoch so once again you have you have corrupted manuscripts from Alexandria uh you know just like the Westcott hortex the sinicus and they actually bring them out and they try to infuse this into the church as true Doctrine wow excellent point I never saw that about Judas you know Satan filled his heart just like ananas and safire Satan filled their bodies right filled their hearts and then the future Antichrist will be filled according to 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 filled with Satan excellent point why didn't Satan just create his own human body excellent point I love what brother Ram teaches us you know if it's the Revelation if it's the true revelation of God it always points you back to the word of God and it won't contradict anything in the scripture excellent amen so it seems like you know regarding the Book of Enoch it just takes a little bit of historical research and you'll see why the church you know especially around the time of the King James version 1600 then the revised version was it 1818 but you know we we know why they did not include the Book of Enoch as an inspired text right yeah and and and honestly brother the five books hadn't been put together yet which one do you choose so it's just like the Apocrypha you know what I mean they go against the Bible and and there's really not a 100% proof of the authorship or the inherency so and and then you're you're talking about a time when they were backslid people you know the the books that have been given to us were were people moved on by the Holy Ghost but I mean you read the book of mccabes and some of these other places I mean it might be hisor to some sense but but the worshiping of angels and things like that that that ain't an inspired word praying to the dead and things like that you we don't that's obviously not inspired absolutely yeah like we've heard you know the reason these Apocrypha books and other books Book of Enoch are rejected uh because they totally contradict all the other inspired the reeded texts yeah it's exactly right and I and I would say this uh brothers that uh when you look even with what we covered last time and this time um it is a deliberate attempt of Satan to try to so spread out Truth uh so to say that uh it makes it so only the elect will be able to to see what truth is and and actually work on it you know there was something that that Drew us you know when you when you read that and you seen a scripture not in the Bible and it's this different version you there's something that says why is that the idea is it looks like Satan what Satan is trying to do is is he's trying to make all these little small changes but actually it destroys the interpretation that leads to Perfection and that's what we're looking for we're we're looking to uh believe exactly what he said so you know as brother brandom said he said one word off one word off uh when we all and this case of Brotherly kindness we all ought to be seeking the Lord for leadership Even in our disagreements as far as if someone believes us or someone believes that so it requires uh the place that it should be pointing us to is Lord we need a greater leadership from you a greater unfolding of yourself amen very well said yeah the elect cannot be deceived you know these little issues Satan brings out you know uh the Bible said we're not ignorant of his devices so the ways he deceives and he deceives by just changing Little Words Right little uh brother Ram say he's not going to come out and right away do some awful easy to detect deception it's a small thing first and in these five examples we've seen how Satan's try to convince people there's a lesser punishment for changing the word of God that was the sixth Doctrine the the seventh was attacking the three works of Grace in relation to the water baptism and influencing people that they're already born again when they're not so that even attacks the baptism of the Holy Ghost in Acts 238 the eth one was Revelation 1:20 the attack on the church ages and the attack on brother brandom as the seventh Church age messenger and then the ninth was the attack on the revelation of the Seven Seals and brother Ram's Revelation on the four-step process of the Antichrist uh but thank God for the four-step restoration process of the Holy Ghost and then 10th the attack on the revelation of the serpent seed God's truth will prevail the hybridization of Beast and Humanity uh and also the then the necessity today for the spiritual seed the seed of the word of God The Incorruptible seed the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen well we've come to the conclusion of this third podcast very thankful again for brother cam uh donating his time here and uh sharing What the Lord Has revealed to his heart I feel very inspired I'm very encouraged by these wonderful Revelations and truths our brother showed to us we thank God for the Holy Ghost guiding us into all truth giving us uh confidence that he's preserved his word to this generation as Psalm 12:7 says and this reminded me of uh Matthew 24:4 Satan's deception will be so close that it would deceive the verel if it were possible thank God it's not possible now we have 10 examples of course Lord willing if the Lord allows we'll get to the rest of them with of course there's many more uh but now we can see 10 clear examples of Satan slightly intelligently brother Ram said Satan's a genius at his job he's a genius to try to just change one little word uh emphasize something a little less take away from the serpent seed or the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the church ages or the Seven Seals but the elect cannot be deceived so again we're thankful for this opportunity and our faith is more solidified on the King James version as the infallible word of God and so we'll let our brother cam say a few things in closing here by God's grace thank you brother cam for being with us in this podcast yeah we thank you as well brother we appreciate that hard work that you're doing and get truth out to God's elect wherever they would be and uh I agree with all of that wholeheartedly brother it's it's the hour where uh the more you're looking the more God is revealing uh the more you feel that pole to to get in and eat the word uh it is God's desire to show in every case in every point every Doctrine uh that he is the Living God in that Doctrine uh in that point of view so uh we're so glad that uh you know what here it is God has revealed to our eyes that uh we found truth and uh we believe that with all of our hearts and uh what we see is every angle that God sets us at we see that there are answers there there proof evidences to show us you know even with these Bible versions they're showing us that that this Bible is not this Bible they are different and thank God for eyes to see the differences and the reasons why uh so once again we we appreciate all the listeners and everyone who who are interested in this type of a topic because it's it's a little bit deeper but yet it's very rich and uh the distinctions are made very clear by the Lord Jesus Christ in a genuine Faith Of God will believe in God and God is the word it'll never add nothing should the Bible tells us if we add one word or take one word away our part will be taken from The Book of Life Revelations 22:18 the last closing chapter I stand before him I want to be found innocent I've ever trying to add one thing to that word or take one for play just exactly the way it is teaching people to right up to it the Bible says this I can't help what anyone else says I got to stay right with that and here was those people standing around like that when I said will Paul have to be judged for the gospel he preached said yes I said I preached every word just exactly the way he did and the millions screamed out we are resting on that that's way I wanted to be on the cross there I want to be that way just like that just what Paul said I don't want to add one thing to it take one thing away from it just what the Bible said that's just way I want to keep it going and of course you keep it like that you got the to have somewhere that faith can take its resting place and to me I don't know how you feel about it but to me the Bible is the infallible word of God Amen and I believe that God has watched over his word that there's not one punctuation out of place and so we want to thank our listeners thank you for your
