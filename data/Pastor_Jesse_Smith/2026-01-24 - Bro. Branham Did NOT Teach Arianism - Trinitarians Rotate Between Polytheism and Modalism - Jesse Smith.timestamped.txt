[0:03] And she said, "WELL, NOW HOW COULD HE be
[0:05] divine and weep?" I said, "That was the
[0:07] man part weeping."
[0:10] &gt;&gt; Right? You failed to see he was
[0:12] Emmanuel. HE WAS BOTH MAN AND GOD.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; GREETINGS, FRIENDS, in the matchless
[0:19] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[0:22] purpose of this video is to defend God's
[0:24] prophet, Brother Brandham, as a faithful
[0:26] Bible teacher regarding the Godhead.
[0:30] Recently, Brother Brandham has been
[0:31] accused of being a believer in Aryanism.
[0:35] And that's a false accusation. That's a
[0:37] lie. Brother Brham simply revealed the
[0:40] true understanding of the one person in
[0:42] the Godhead. And he denounced the false
[0:45] heretical polytheistic threeperson lie
[0:48] of the Trinity dogma. I was requested to
[0:51] make this video by a precious brother
[0:53] who saw this accusation. So, I
[0:56] appreciate the brother's desire to
[0:58] defend God's prophet, Brother Brandham.
[1:00] Brother Brham was a Holy Ghostfilled
[1:02] prophet of God, a faithful Bible
[1:04] teacher. And the truth is that
[1:05] trinitarians always have and always will
[1:08] add to the Bible. They'll be guilty of
[1:10] adding to the words of this prophecy.
[1:13] Some more than others. Some Trinitarians
[1:15] add more than others do to the Bible.
[1:18] And of course, Aryanism contradicts the
[1:20] Bible as well. Both trinitarianism and
[1:24] Aryanism are false. They contain
[1:26] contradictions against the scripture. So
[1:29] that's why in the thumbnail of this
[1:31] video, I showed how true believers have
[1:34] only one creed and that creed is Christ
[1:37] and Christ is the word of God.
[1:40] just like to remind you that some
[1:41] trinitarians go so far as to say that
[1:44] they must rotate between modalism and
[1:47] tritheism. Those are not my words. Those
[1:50] are the words of a prominent evangelical
[1:52] trinitarian scholar named Miller J.
[1:54] Ericson. I have his book.
[1:57] And he said, "We must quote, alternate
[1:59] between modalism, one God who changes
[2:02] appearance, and tritheism, three gods."
[2:04] End quote.
[2:07] Any true Christian will understand that
[2:09] he should not rotate between any air and
[2:13] truth. Christians should only believe
[2:15] and confess the truth of the word of
[2:17] God. Jesus said, "Thy word is truth."
[2:20] And yet millions, if not a billion or
[2:23] more trinitarians will rotate between
[2:25] the truth of God's word and tritheism.
[2:28] So it shows the shame and folly that
[2:30] should be on all trinitarians. But thank
[2:33] God for the truth of the word of God.
[2:35] Thank God for sending a prophet to
[2:37] finish the mystery of God. And one of
[2:39] those mysteries is the Godhead. So this
[2:41] is essentially a Godhead video. The
[2:44] Bible calls the Godhead a mystery in
[2:45] Colossians 2:2. And so that mystery was
[2:48] finished through the seventh angel,
[2:50] God's prophet, brother William, Mary,
[2:52] and Brandon. Let's go through four
[2:54] important points here by God's grace.
[2:57] First, we don't label ourselves
[2:58] trinitarians, aryens, modalists, or
[3:01] anything because all those labels have
[3:04] beliefs that limit God and limit his
[3:07] word. We're simply holy ghostfilled
[3:09] Christians who believe only the word of
[3:11] God. Last year, I had supper with a
[3:13] trinitarian pastor and we got into a
[3:15] debate right there in front of both our
[3:17] families. It was a kind debate, but it
[3:19] boiled down to this. I do not add any
[3:22] words to the Bible, yet he would freely
[3:24] add to the words of the Bible. I would
[3:26] call him a brother. He would not call me
[3:28] a brother. I would shake his hand and
[3:30] hug him. He would not shake my hand and
[3:31] want to hug me. So that shows the evil
[3:34] spirit that's on some Trinitarians, not
[3:36] all Trinitarians. Real Christians do not
[3:39] take labels that are man-made labels.
[3:42] They're simply Holy Ghost fil believers.
[3:44] Second, we believe every word in the
[3:46] Bible about the Godhead. The problem is
[3:48] that trinitarians add to the Bible.
[3:51] Arenism adds to the Bible or takes away
[3:53] from the Bible. Remember creeds and
[3:55] dogmas limit the holy one of Israel as
[3:58] Psalm says and they make the
[4:00] commandments of God of none effect
[4:02] especially the first commandment about
[4:04] worshiping only one God. Trinitarians
[4:07] again rotate between one God and three
[4:09] gods. That's according to their
[4:10] prominent scholar not according to me.
[4:13] Matthew 15 spoke of this verses 3 and
[4:16] six. Jesus said why do you transgress
[4:18] the commandment of God by your
[4:19] tradition? Trinitarianism, Aryanism are
[4:22] traditions of men and therefore they
[4:24] transgress the word of God. Verse six
[4:26] says, "You have made the commandment of
[4:28] God of none effect by your tradition."
[4:31] So anytime a creed or dogma about the
[4:33] Godhead is created, it makes the
[4:36] commandments of none effect. The word of
[4:38] God does not affect the people in a good
[4:41] way. The creeds actually hurt the
[4:43] people. As we'll see, one of the main
[4:45] sins is pride that comes from these
[4:47] false doctrines. And that's the third
[4:49] point. These creeds actually produce the
[4:51] pride of life, which is an antichrist
[4:54] spirit. Of course, pride is an
[4:55] antichrist spirit and it's the
[4:57] antichrist spirit, a pride because it
[4:58] starts out as a deed. It's just a deed
[5:01] of the nickelans. Then it turns into a
[5:03] doctrine or the unbending way. And
[5:05] that's what we see. Trinitarians are
[5:06] unbending.
[5:08] They will just hold on to their creed
[5:09] that adds to the Bible. And the next
[5:12] step is the doctrine of Balum. And Balum
[5:14] was uniting unbelievers with believers.
[5:17] And that's exactly what happens in many
[5:18] of these trinitarian churches. They have
[5:20] unbelievers and believers sitting there.
[5:23] Fornication was the sin of the feast of
[5:26] bale pior. And that's exactly what we
[5:28] have in trinitarian churches. Many of
[5:30] them, not all, but many of them have
[5:32] fornicators sitting in there. And
[5:33] especially adulterers letting people
[5:35] marry two times, three times. That's
[5:37] basically the modern feast of Baal Peor
[5:40] right there in trinitarian churches. And
[5:43] again, it's so self-righteous. It's so
[5:45] prideful to say I can add three persons
[5:47] to the Bible. I can rotate with
[5:49] tritheism. That's the sin of pride. And
[5:52] think friends, this pride of life goes
[5:55] to all this effort to have these
[5:56] councils as we'll see with the council
[5:58] of Nika and so forth and now all the
[6:01] modern councils. They go to all these
[6:04] great lengths and efforts to defend
[6:05] their man-made religion, their
[6:08] commandments of men. They'll fight to
[6:11] the death for their creeds, their dogmas
[6:13] rather than the word of God. As one time
[6:16] an accuser, Brother Brandham said,
[6:17] "Don't you believe the giants of the
[6:19] faith?" And he was quoting trinitarians.
[6:21] That was such a sly, deceptive
[6:23] statement. No, the giants of the faith
[6:25] are the men who wrote the Bible. And
[6:28] they were never led to write God was
[6:30] three persons. So that was a sly,
[6:32] deceptive lie. Satan, but the Holy
[6:34] Spirit discerned that. The giants of the
[6:37] faith are those who wrote the word of
[6:38] God that never added to the word nor
[6:40] take away from the word of God. And the
[6:43] fourth point is remember there's eight
[6:44] problems with the trinity dogma. I have
[6:46] a two-part video series on this
[6:49] and I have numerous other video
[6:51] resources about the godhead. I wrote an
[6:53] entire chapter on the godhead in my 2021
[6:55] book. It's chapter 1. I have videos
[6:57] about Genesis 126. Let us There's also a
[7:01] video about the positive uses Brother
[7:03] Ren has of the word trinity when it does
[7:05] not mean three persons. So please let me
[7:08] know if you have other questions about
[7:09] the Godhead. Perhaps I have a video
[7:10] about it already by God's grace. Next,
[7:13] let's look at quotes from brother
[7:14] Brandham about the godhead. Brother
[7:16] Brandham believed both in the full
[7:18] humanity of Jesus and the full deity of
[7:21] Jesus. For example, there's four quotes
[7:24] that say God, very God. Jesus was God,
[7:28] very God. So let's look first at the
[7:30] divinity of Jesus. It was fully God. Now
[7:33] there's four of them. I'll just read one
[7:34] of them. If people really want the
[7:36] truth, they'll go read all four. But
[7:38] Ram's talking about Jesus. He said,
[7:40] quote, "That which is right, for he
[7:42] bought that church with his own blood.
[7:44] That blood is the blood of God. The one
[7:45] who owns that church is God, very God.
[7:48] He is the first and the last. That title
[7:50] spells eternity. He was dead and is
[7:53] alive." End quote.
[7:55] So friends, that quote shows that could
[7:57] only be speaking of Jesus because God
[7:59] the father could never die. Brother Ram
[8:02] said Jesus Christ is God, very God. He
[8:05] was fully God, fully man. There's 38
[8:07] quotes where brother Ram talks about
[8:09] supreme deity from 1954 all the way to
[8:12] the end of his life 1965 even in the
[8:14] church age book. I'll just read one of
[8:17] them. I'll read one of them from again
[8:18] the church age book about the supreme
[8:20] deity of Jesus Christ. Brother Ram says,
[8:23] quote, "Before he reveals the
[8:24] characteristics of the last age to us,
[8:26] he gives us one final look at his own
[8:27] gracious and supreme deity, this is the
[8:30] capstone revelation of himself. Thus
[8:32] saith the amen. Jesus is the amen of
[8:34] God. Jesus is the so be it of God." End
[8:38] quote. So we see brother Ram fully
[8:40] taught, clearly taught the supreme deity
[8:43] of Jesus Christ. Brother Ram even said
[8:45] Jesus was not a lesser God. He said this
[8:48] in 1959 conference with God. He's
[8:52] talking about Catholics. He said, quote,
[8:53] "But when you try to make Jesus a little
[8:56] lesser God than God, make him a lesser
[8:58] God, you cut his feet off, bring him
[9:00] down just a little bit under the head of
[9:01] God and make him a lesser God, you are
[9:03] so wrong. Jesus was man. He called
[9:06] himself the son of man." End quote. So
[9:09] clearly, Brother Ram said Jesus was not
[9:11] a lesser God. And all the other quotes
[9:13] say Jesus was God, very God. Now, I'll
[9:16] just read one quote to show how brother
[9:18] Raman believed in Jesus's full humanity.
[9:20] But it wasn't the same humanity as our
[9:22] humanity because our humanity is sinful.
[9:24] Jesus's humanity had a word nature, not
[9:27] a sin nature. Therefore, Jesus never
[9:29] sinned. So although he was fully man,
[9:32] fully human, he had a word nature unlike
[9:35] us. So his humanity is different than
[9:38] ours in that aspect. His nature was the
[9:41] word nature. In John chapter 1, the
[9:43] Bible says, "The word was made flesh and
[9:45] dwelt among us." It's a very important
[9:48] point to make. Let's look at this quote
[9:49] from a super sign 1962. Brother tells a
[9:52] story often of a Christian scientist
[9:55] woman who tried to tell him that Jesus
[9:57] was not divine because he wept at the
[10:00] grave of Lazarus. Brother Ram's
[10:02] preaching about the super sign from
[10:04] Isaiah, which was God coming in the
[10:07] flesh in his son. Brother Ram said,
[10:09] quote, "Born in a dirty, stinking
[10:11] stable. Little Jehovah, not laying in a
[10:13] pink basket in a hospital room.
[10:16] Emmanuel, the creator of heavens and
[10:17] earth with swaddling cloth on.
[10:20] Hallelujah. Little Jehovah playing as a
[10:22] kid." End quote. So, Brother Ram's not
[10:24] calling Jesus a second person. He's
[10:26] calling Jesus Jehovah. And then he went
[10:28] to the story about the Christian
[10:30] scientist woman talking about how Jesus
[10:33] wept. She said, "You brag too much on
[10:35] Jesus. You make him divine." Brother Ram
[10:37] said he was divine. She said, "Well, now
[10:39] how could he be divine and weep?"
[10:41] Brother Ram said, "Quote, that was the
[10:44] man part weeping." That's right. You
[10:46] failed to see that he was Emanuel. He
[10:48] was both man and God. He was a man going
[10:51] to the grave weeping. But when he pulled
[10:53] them little shoulders together and said,
[10:54] "Lazarus, come forth." And a man that
[10:57] had been dead four days and stinking
[11:00] come forth and lived again. That was
[11:02] that took more than a man. Right? End
[11:04] quote. So the first example brother Ram
[11:06] shows of humanity and deity is Jesus at
[11:09] the grave of Lazarus. We see both the
[11:11] man part and the God part. Then brother
[11:14] Ram gives three more examples. The
[11:16] second example was when Jesus fed the
[11:18] 5,000. He said quote he was a man when
[11:20] he come off the mountain that night
[11:22] hungry looking on a tree to find
[11:24] something to eat. But when he took five
[11:26] biscuits and two fish and fed 5,000 that
[11:28] was more than a man. That was the
[11:29] creator Jehovah. Right? End quote. So
[11:32] that was the second example. In the man
[11:34] part, he was hungry, but then the God
[11:36] part could create and multiply creation,
[11:40] multiply food. The third example, quote,
[11:42] he was a man when he was lying on that
[11:44] ship that night and 10,000 devils of the
[11:46] sea swore they would drown him, looked
[11:48] up and said, "Peace be still. That was
[11:50] more than a man. That was God who could
[11:52] steal the waves of the sea." End quote.
[11:55] So the third example is Jesus speaking
[11:57] to the storm, saying, "Peace be still.
[11:59] He could control nature." So we see the
[12:01] man part sleeping. Then we see the God
[12:03] part controlling nature. And the fourth
[12:05] example was Jesus on the cross. Quote,
[12:07] it was a man that cried for mercy at the
[12:09] cross. My God, why hast thou forsaken
[12:11] me. But on Easter morning when he broke
[12:14] the seals of death, hell, the grave, and
[12:16] rose up again and said, I am he that was
[12:17] dead and alive forever more. That was
[12:19] more than a man. That was God and his
[12:21] son. End quote. So the fourth example is
[12:24] Jesus's humanity could be forsaken by
[12:26] the deity of Jesus, which was God. And
[12:29] like what brother Ram said, every man
[12:31] that's ever amounted to a hill of beans
[12:33] believe that. Hallelujah. The same is
[12:36] true today. Every man that'll mount to
[12:37] hill of beans believes in both the
[12:39] humanity of Jesus and the divinity of
[12:41] Jesus, the supreme deity, God, very God,
[12:44] God in Christ, reconciling the world
[12:46] unto himself. Now friends, let's go
[12:48] through two sources here to prove
[12:50] brother was not into aranism. The first
[12:53] source is from the encyclopedia of
[12:55] Britannica online. I just search
[12:58] Aryanism on the website. So, let's go
[13:01] through this and I'll bring out my
[13:02] points. I basically copied and pasted
[13:05] the text onto this file. So, I'll put
[13:08] this on the screen. You can see the text
[13:10] from the website Britannica is in white,
[13:13] but then my thoughts are in yellow
[13:16] highlight. Now, again, remember with
[13:18] trinitarianism and Aryanism, you're
[13:20] going to have some things true, some
[13:21] things false. I'll begin here. What is
[13:24] Aryanism? Arenism a christoologgical
[13:27] position in Christianity originated in
[13:30] the early 4th century with Aras and
[13:32] Alexandrian preser. It posits that Jesus
[13:36] as the son of God was created by God not
[13:39] of the same substance. Now let me stop
[13:41] right there and share some thoughts
[13:43] here. Friends, trinitarians fail to see
[13:46] that Jesus as a man had three parts just
[13:49] like 1 Thessalonians 5:23 says, body,
[13:52] spirit, soul. And they also fail to
[13:55] identify which part of Jesus's existence
[13:58] they're referring to. In other words,
[13:59] are are they referring to the existence
[14:01] of Jesus before the foundation of the
[14:03] world or during his earthly life when he
[14:06] was in flesh or his life after the
[14:09] resurrection now that he's in a
[14:10] glorified body? But regarding Aryanism
[14:13] saying Christ is not of the same
[14:16] substance, that's true in one way. God
[14:18] is a spirit. So the flesh of Jesus
[14:21] wasn't the same substance proven by the
[14:23] fact that the body of Jesus could die
[14:26] but the spirit of God cannot die. But
[14:29] Jesus and the father had the same
[14:31] nature. They had a holy nature again
[14:34] because the father's holy. Jesus prayed
[14:36] to the father and said holy father. And
[14:39] Jesus' nature was a holy nature. He had
[14:41] a word nature not a sin nature. So
[14:44] Jesus's body was created by God along
[14:46] with Jesus's human spirit. But the soul
[14:49] or nature of Jesus was not created
[14:52] because it was God's spirit because
[14:54] that's where the spirit dwells in the
[14:56] soul. And the Bible said Jesus was the
[14:59] fullness of the Godhead bodily. That
[15:02] fullness was in his soul. Now notice
[15:04] that fullness was not in his mind
[15:06] because Jesus even said, "I don't know
[15:08] the day or the hour, nor do the angels
[15:10] know. Only the father knows the day and
[15:12] the hour of my return." Of course,
[15:15] Jesus' flesh, while he was alive, before
[15:17] he died, did not have the fullness of
[15:19] the godhead body because again, Jesus'
[15:21] flesh could die, but God's spirit can
[15:23] never die. Now, let's go to the points
[15:26] on Arenism from Britannica. There's five
[15:29] points we'll read here. First, Aryanism
[15:31] stresses God's uniqueness, setting him
[15:33] apart as self-existent and unchanging.
[15:36] That's true. There's nothing wrong about
[15:38] that. God the Father is self-existent
[15:41] and unchanging. Now second views the sun
[15:44] as mutable. So aranism views the sun as
[15:48] mutable. Now friends, Jesus' flesh was
[15:51] able to change. Mutable means able to be
[15:54] changed. To deny this is to deny the
[15:57] Bible. Jesus' flesh increased in wisdom.
[16:00] The Bible said his flesh of course grew
[16:03] from a baby to a child to a teenager to
[16:07] an adult. His flesh then died and then
[16:10] his flesh was raised back to life. So
[16:13] his body was mutable. His human body,
[16:16] even his human spirit was mutable. For
[16:18] again, he did not know the day and the
[16:19] hour of his coming. His will of his
[16:22] human spirit was different than the
[16:23] father's will because he prayed in the
[16:24] garden of Gethsemane, "Not my will, but
[16:26] thy will be done. His human spirit could
[16:29] be tempted, but God's spirit could never
[16:31] be tempted." But now that Jesus is in a
[16:34] glorified body, his human spirit can no
[16:36] longer be tempted. So see friends, the
[16:39] son was mutable in some ways.
[16:42] Now the second point of aranism is the
[16:44] son created from nothing. Now friends
[16:47] that's true. The body of Jesus was
[16:49] created from nothing. God's spirit
[16:51] overshadowed Mary and created the body
[16:54] of Jesus. Anyone that denies that denies
[16:57] the Bible. Now the spirit of God in
[16:59] Jesus' soul was uncreated because that's
[17:02] God's spirit. Now the next part says and
[17:05] not having direct knowledge of the
[17:07] father. Well, this is the one part of
[17:09] Aaronism that is heresy. Jesus
[17:12] specifically said he had glory with the
[17:14] father before the foundation of the
[17:16] world in John 17:5 and also Matthew
[17:20] 11:27 which shows Jesus already knew the
[17:24] father. The son is the only one who
[17:26] knows the father according to Jesus
[17:28] again Matthew 11:27.
[17:31] The third point here on the Bratannica
[17:32] website is Aaronism was denounced as
[17:35] heresy at the first council of Nika in
[17:36] 3:25 which affirmed that Christ is of
[17:39] one substance with the father. End
[17:41] quote. Now friends, the truth is only
[17:44] Jesus' soul anointed with the fullness
[17:46] of the godhead bodily was of one
[17:48] substance with the father. To deny that
[17:51] is again to deny the Bible. It denies
[17:53] Jesus' flesh and Jesus's human spirit
[17:56] while he was alive on earth before his
[17:58] death. Jesus' flesh could not be the
[18:01] same substance because it could die and
[18:03] be tempted. But we could say Jesus flesh
[18:06] shared the same nature as the father.
[18:08] For Jesus's nature was sinless. If
[18:11] trinitarians deny this, they deny the
[18:13] Bible, which some of them will freely do
[18:15] in order to justify their sinful
[18:17] man-made creed. They love the creed more
[18:20] than the word of God. The fourth and
[18:22] fifth points I'll just read. Aryanism
[18:24] was popular throughout much of the
[18:25] western and eastern Roman empires even
[18:27] after it was denounced as a heresy. The
[18:30] christologology of Jehovah's Witnesses
[18:32] can be considered a form of Arenism.
[18:35] There's one more part I copied from the
[18:37] Bratannica. One more paragraph. It says,
[18:39] "What did Aerys teach about Jesus? Aris
[18:41] taught that Jesus Christ was created by
[18:43] God and thus had a beginning." Now,
[18:47] here's what I want to say about that.
[18:49] Jesus Christ in one way did have a
[18:51] beginning. Even the visible light logos,
[18:54] the celestial body that was visible had
[18:58] a beginning. It was when God said, "Let
[19:01] there be light." And when God said, "Let
[19:03] there be light," that wasn't the light
[19:05] of the sun or stars. Because we find
[19:07] that later in Genesis 1, those lights
[19:09] were created later. Plus, Jesus's
[19:12] physical body and human spirit had a
[19:14] beginning since even Jesus's human
[19:16] spirit grew or waxed strong in spirit
[19:19] according to Luke 2:40, which means it
[19:21] was not equal to the father. So Jesus's
[19:24] human spirit while he was a child, while
[19:26] he was alive, before he died, was not
[19:29] equal to the father because God cannot
[19:32] increase his strength. To deny that, any
[19:34] trinitarian that would deny that would
[19:36] deny the Bible. Now let's go back to
[19:38] this paragraph here about Aras. So he
[19:42] taught Jesus Christ was created by God
[19:43] and thus had a beginning differing from
[19:45] God's unique self-existent and immutable
[19:48] nature. He stressed God's uniqueness
[19:50] suggesting the son was not eternal or of
[19:53] the same essence of the father. This
[19:55] view was considered a heresy by the
[19:56] early church because it undermined the
[19:58] concept of the trinity and of the full
[20:00] divinity of Christ. Now, regarding this
[20:02] point where it says Aaronism said the
[20:06] son was not eternal or of the same
[20:08] substance as the father. Well, that's
[20:10] true in one way and trinitarians would
[20:12] have to admit this because Jesus flesh
[20:14] did not have the same essence of the
[20:16] father because Jesus' flesh could grow
[20:19] and learn and didn't know all things and
[20:22] could die. But God the father could
[20:25] never grow, learn, lack knowledge or
[20:28] die. So if trinitarians deny that
[20:31] they're denying the Bible. So it all
[20:34] depends friends. What part of Christ are
[20:36] you talking about? Are you talking about
[20:38] his human body, his human spirit, his
[20:40] soul? Are you talking about how he
[20:43] existed as the logos before the
[20:45] foundation of the world? Are you talking
[20:47] about why he lived on earth before he
[20:49] died? Or are you talking about his
[20:51] current state now in a glorified body
[20:53] after the resurrection sitting at the
[20:55] right hand of the majesty on high?
[20:58] So hope that was helpful, friends. Let's
[20:59] go to the Aanian creed, which is the
[21:01] second source. I quoted this a couple
[21:04] times in my 2021 book. And again, in the
[21:06] Athanian creed, some things are true,
[21:08] some things are false. And this creed is
[21:10] so confusing, which is so different from
[21:13] the Bible. The Bible's so plain. The
[21:14] Bible's so easy to understand. But these
[21:16] creeds are so confusing. No wonder
[21:19] because the creed came from the mother
[21:20] harlot, the Roman Catholic Church, and
[21:23] the mother harlot, mystery Babylon.
[21:26] Mystery confusion. So rather accepting
[21:29] the word of God which is simple easy to
[21:32] understand they create their own creed
[21:34] which causes so much confusion. I think
[21:36] I have six points in my book where I
[21:38] disagreed with the Aanian creed which
[21:42] was the 6th century trinitarian
[21:43] confessional. First the creed says we
[21:46] worship God in a trinity but Jesus said
[21:48] we worship God in spirit and in truth.
[21:51] The Bible never says we worship God in
[21:53] trinity. When Jesus was asked about God,
[21:56] he went back to the shima. Deuteronomy
[21:59] chapter 6. Here, O Israel, the Lord our
[22:01] God is one Lord. It never said here, O
[22:04] Israel, the Lord our God is three
[22:06] persons. So, we do not worship God in a
[22:09] trinity. We worship God as one person.
[22:13] Second, the creed says the son
[22:15] uncreated.
[22:16] But again, the Bible says the flesh of
[22:19] Jesus was created or made of a woman.
[22:22] And Jesus even calls himself the
[22:24] beginning of the creation of God. So how
[22:26] can the creed call him uncreated when
[22:28] Jesus himself said he was the beginning
[22:30] of the creation of God? Jesus said
[22:33] before Abraham was I am the great
[22:35] uncreated I am dwelt in the body of
[22:38] Jesus of Nazareth. So again the body was
[22:41] created. The spirit of Jesus which was
[22:44] the spirit of God was never created.
[22:47] Thirdly, the creed says the sun
[22:48] unlimited. But the Bible says Jesus's
[22:51] human knowledge was limited for it did
[22:52] not know the identity of the woman with
[22:54] the blood issue who touched him. Nor did
[22:56] he know the day and hour of his second
[22:58] coming to earth.
[23:00] The fourth point is the creed says the
[23:02] son is of the father alone. But the
[23:04] bible says Jesus' body was conceived of
[23:05] the holy ghost not specifically naming
[23:08] the father in the womb of Mary. So the
[23:11] creed denies the Holy Ghost as the
[23:13] father of Jesus which anols Matthew
[23:16] 1:20.
[23:17] If the creed is true then Jesus has two
[23:20] fathers since the one who conceives a
[23:22] child is the father. So the truth is
[23:25] that the Bible reveals the father and
[23:26] the holy ghost as the self-same person
[23:29] not two separate persons. Fifth the
[23:31] creed says none is greater or less than
[23:33] another but Jesus declared different in
[23:35] John 14:28. He said the father is
[23:37] greater than I. So the truth is that the
[23:40] flesh of Jesus was mortal during his
[23:42] earthly ministry, but God the father is
[23:43] a spirit and has been and always will be
[23:46] immortal.
[23:47] And six, and finally, the creed says,
[23:49] "God is three persons, but the Bible
[23:51] never uses that language to describe God
[23:53] because he is one person." Hebrews 1:3
[23:56] says, "The son is the express image of
[23:58] the person of God." Notice one person of
[24:00] God. I always point Trinitarians to that
[24:02] verse. It never says Jesus was the
[24:04] second person. He's the image of the
[24:07] person, the one person of God. As
[24:09] Colossians 1:15 says, Christ is the
[24:11] image of the invisible God, not a second
[24:14] person, but the visible image of the one
[24:16] person of God. In closing, friends, hope
[24:20] this video was a blessing by the grace
[24:21] of God. I don't want to go too long on
[24:23] this, but just want to quickly prove by
[24:25] God's grace that Brother Ran was a
[24:26] faithful Bible teacher, a true prophet
[24:28] of God. God revealed to him the mystery
[24:31] of the Godhead, that God is one person,
[24:33] not three persons. I hope you can see
[24:35] plainly that brother Ram did not teach
[24:37] aranism. Brother Ram taught Bible
[24:40] doctrine. Brother Ram taught the Bible
[24:42] in its purity. Both trinitarians and
[24:46] Aryans add to the word of God and take
[24:49] away the word of God. So there's awful
[24:51] repercussions for that. As the Bible
[24:53] says, "Add thou not to his words, lest
[24:55] thou be found a liar." As Proverbs 30:es
[24:58] 5 and 6 says, friends, brother Ran
[25:00] wasn't perfect. He didn't preach
[25:01] everything precisely right. And again he
[25:04] did grow in revelation. Remember 1952 he
[25:07] said that the third person the trinity
[25:09] burned in their hearts and he was so
[25:11] happy about it. But then by 1960 he said
[25:14] three persons was of the devil. So he
[25:16] grew in his revelation. He's grew in his
[25:18] knowledge of God. Just like the Bible
[25:19] said grow in grace and knowledge of the
[25:20] Lord. But by the end of his ministry he
[25:22] had the revelation exactly right on the
[25:24] Godhead. God is one person not three
[25:27] persons. People will keep trying to
[25:28] slander God's prophet brother Brandham.
[25:31] But friends, heaven and earth shall pass
[25:32] away, but God's word will never pass
[25:34] away. The word of God, brother taught,
[25:36] will not pass away. So, we thank the
[25:38] Lord for that. Thank God that we receive
[25:41] the seventh church age messenger, the
[25:43] forthcoming of the spirit of Elijah, a
[25:45] son of man revealing the son of man, a
[25:47] prophet messenger to the Gentiles before
[25:50] the return of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[25:52] the rapture. If you have any other
[25:54] Godhead questions, please let me know by
[25:55] God's grace. We'll pray about it and see
[25:56] what the Lord leads us to do as far as
[25:59] videos in the future.
[26:01] If you have any questions or concerns or
[26:02] testimonies about this video, please
[26:04] contact me.
[26:06] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[26:08] the desire of your heart.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[26:13] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[26:16] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[26:19] good news that Jesus raised from the
[26:21] dead, living among man today, his
[26:23] church. The same Jesus that was
[26:25] yesterday will be today and forever.
[26:29] is never fails.
