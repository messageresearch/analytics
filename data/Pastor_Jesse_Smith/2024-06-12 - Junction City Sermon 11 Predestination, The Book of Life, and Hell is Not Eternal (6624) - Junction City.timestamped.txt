[0:01] so by God's grace we'd like to look at
[0:02] predestination tonight if we have time
[0:04] you know the book of life and then I
[0:06] want to look at how hell is not Eternal
[0:09] so I want to look if we can cover those
[0:11] three topics I think that'd be wonderful
[0:14] uh by God's grace I got a whole list of
[0:15] topics I'd like to preach to you so I
[0:17] know we're we're so blessed to hear the
[0:19] word of God
[0:22] hallelujah brother brandom said when the
[0:25] uh when the scriptures were revealed to
[0:26] him when the Seven Seals were revealed
[0:28] he said the Bible became a new Bible and
[0:31] that's what I find in my life you know I
[0:32] just go back over some topics and it
[0:34] feels like it's brand new again uh the
[0:36] revelations you know our human Minds
[0:38] can't remember everything so it's so
[0:40] good to go back over things that we've
[0:41] heard before and it refreshes us the
[0:44] Bible says all you children know about
[0:46] all you uh children know about cooking
[0:48] right you like to stir things up right
[0:50] the Bible says stir up your pure Minds
[0:52] by way of remembrance so God wants you
[0:55] to stir up all those good thoughts right
[0:58] and get it moving in your mind and you
[1:00] want all the word of God constantly in
[1:03] your thoughts praise God hallelujah
[1:05] Romans chapter 8 uh just on a side note
[1:09] Romans chapter 8 is one of the most
[1:10] beautiful chapters in The Bible if you
[1:12] haven't read that lately I would
[1:13] encourage you to do that I mean it
[1:14] starts off with there's no
[1:16] condemnation um and then it goes uh uh
[1:20] into how we've received the spirit of
[1:21] adoption already we're already adopted
[1:24] with the Holy Spirit we're already God's
[1:26] children uh and then it says all things
[1:29] work together together for our good uh
[1:31] no one can condemn us God's Justified us
[1:35] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:37] God this is a power packed chapter
[1:40] Hallelujah so if you have not read that
[1:42] lately I encourage you it always stir me
[1:44] up and encourages Me by God's grace so
[1:46] Romans
[1:47] 8 we'll start at verse 28 so I want to
[1:50] look at predestination uh and forn
[1:53] knowledge here tonight and then Lord
[1:55] willing like I said go to the Book of
[1:57] Life and then if we have time we'll do
[2:00] hell is not Eternal uh I'll take
[2:02] questions of course at the end I'm going
[2:03] to try to watch my time hopefully I
[2:05] Don't Preach two hours here tonight but
[2:07] uh you know you never know if you're
[2:09] pulling on the word of God you know it
[2:11] might go
[2:12] fast Hallelujah I'm just a teeny bit
[2:15] horse we had a good service last night
[2:16] but I was shouting and screaming so much
[2:19] that I'm a little bit horse here so uh
[2:22] forgive me Romans
[2:26] 8:28 I'd like to um hear your voice too
[2:30] you know so let's read uh 28 together
[2:32] okay if we can read that on three 1 2 3
[2:35] and we know that all things work
[2:37] together for good to them that love God
[2:41] to them who are the called according to
[2:44] his purpose now I'll read verse 29 28 is
[2:48] very familiar how many take comfort in
[2:50] that verse no matter what happens God is
[2:54] going to use that to work out for your
[2:56] good right and what would be your good
[2:58] it would mean that you would love God
[3:00] more right that's what's good right
[3:03] whether we get more money or not or
[3:04] whether we get better clothes or not or
[3:06] a better house or not that might not be
[3:08] to your good but what is good is when
[3:11] you love the Lord Jesus Christ with all
[3:13] your heart soul mind and strength
[3:15] Hallelujah that's the greatest command
[3:17] is to love God with all your heart
[3:19] Hallelujah now verse 29 says for whom he
[3:23] did for know he did also predestinate to
[3:25] be conformed to the image of his son
[3:27] that he might be the firstborn among
[3:29] many
[3:31] Brethren moreover whom he did
[3:33] predestinate them he also called and
[3:35] whom he called them he also Justified
[3:37] and whom he justified them he also
[3:39] glorified so I don't know if you saw it
[3:41] but there's five steps in there that God
[3:45] uses uh for our for his purpose for our
[3:48] existence everybody catch that there's
[3:50] five in there so we'll go over that but
[3:52] before we do that let's have word of
[3:53] prayer if you have a need on your heart
[3:55] let's just make it known unto God you
[3:56] can raise your hand or you can just bow
[3:57] your heart God sees your desires let's
[4:00] pray father God we thank you for these
[4:02] songs that we can sing and praise your

[4:54] from the word of God as well we'll be
[4:56] happy and grateful when we leave this
[4:58] place in Jesus Christ name and the
[5:00] Saints said amen amen God bless you as
[5:02] you're being seated
[5:09] Hallelujah so again it's a privilege to
[5:11] be here I look forward to you know this
[5:13] summer uh this is my first week of
[5:14] vacation so I've been enjoying it I've
[5:16] been studying a lot more I've been
[5:18] enjoying that uh and look forward to
[5:21] this summer you know if you have any
[5:22] topics you'd like me to preach on just
[5:24] let me know uh I probably at some point
[5:28] already preached on it I've already
[5:30] probably written about it or made a
[5:31] video about it and it's a good place to
[5:33] start by God's grace so I want to take
[5:36] these three topics
[5:38] uh you could you know you could take a
[5:40] whole sermon on each one of these but I
[5:42] want to make sure I get through a lot of
[5:44] things here uh this summer by God's
[5:46] grace and I told Brother Irvin too I
[5:48] said if you want me to come on a Sunday
[5:50] if you need a preacher just let me know
[5:52] just give me a couple weeks heads up so
[5:53] I can find somebody to cover for me I
[5:55] just want to make myself available so
[5:58] everybody can hear the word word of God
[6:00] I remember what it was like when I first
[6:02] came in the message I couldn't wait for
[6:03] the next service I always wanted to hear
[6:05] more I always had all these questions
[6:07] Hallelujah and I just couldn't wait till
[6:09] the next service so I'm sure you feel
[6:11] like I do hallelujah amen now uh
[6:15] predestination the word predestination
[6:17] means to
[6:19] predetermine to determine before or
[6:22] limit in
[6:24] advance so we know God has
[6:27] predetermined uh our lives
[6:30] hallelujah amen and here's the five
[6:32] steps now it's in verse Romans
[6:34] 8:29 the first step of predestination is
[6:37] for
[6:38] knowledge brother brandom said God
[6:41] fornew you in his mind and because he
[6:45] had for knowledge about you then he
[6:47] could predestinate events in your life
[6:51] so it all starts where where does it all
[6:52] start in the mind of God
[6:56] hallelujah that's where you started and
[6:58] brother Braham said you started as a
[7:01] thought of God right and if he said he
[7:03] said if you're a thought of God then
[7:05] you're a part of God right and God's
[7:08] thoughts are just as real as God is
[7:11] hallelujah amen so there's a when the
[7:14] Holy Ghost comes in you it's a part of
[7:15] God right it's Christ in you it's a part
[7:18] of the holy spirit that was the part
[7:20] that was in God before the foundation of
[7:22] the world brother raham said you are you
[7:25] are attribute in the thoughts of God
[7:27] brother raham dramatized it he said it's
[7:29] like in God mind he had a photo album
[7:31] and all the Christians all the Believers
[7:33] all the Jews before the in the Old
[7:34] Testament all the Believers had a
[7:36] picture in God's family album and God
[7:38] knew when you were when he was going to
[7:40] manifest you on the earth he sent Adam
[7:43] at the right time he sent Enoch and Noah
[7:45] at the right time then he sent you know
[7:48] uh Moses and Joshua he sent all of them
[7:50] but then it came to your turn hallelujah
[7:52] amen and brother Ram said you look just
[7:55] like God's thought that was in God's
[7:57] photo album before the foundation of the
[7:59] world Hallelujah you were a thought in
[8:01] the mind of God he fornew you and that
[8:04] way he could predestinate you now keep
[8:08] your spot there but you you you probably
[8:09] know this verse right Ephesians 1 4 and
[8:13] 5 so here's your start your start is in
[8:16] the forn knowledge of
[8:19] God that's why brother Ram says there's
[8:21] a part of you that's just Eternal as God
[8:24] because you're a thought of God you're
[8:26] an attribute of God you're a child of
[8:29] God the Bible says you're his offspring
[8:31] Hallelujah we are his offspring so
[8:34] Ephesians
[8:36] 1 verse we'll just read verse four
[8:39] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[8:41] when before the foundation of the world
[8:45] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[8:47] before him in love so when did he choose
[8:51] you he chose you in his mind before the
[8:53] foundation of the world I was chosen in
[8:55] Christ Hallelujah so that's where church
[8:58] that's where you start God had for
[8:59] knowledge God had all this plan in his
[9:02] mind about the 6,000 years of human
[9:04] history and uh the first 4,000 without
[9:07] Christ and then sending Christ and now
[9:09] having the church ages right he blinded
[9:11] the Jews and now he's getting a gentile
[9:12] bride and then after the Rapture then
[9:14] he's going to go back and he's going to
[9:16] uh seal 144,000 the Jews are going to
[9:19] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[9:21] after the Rapture hallelujah amen God
[9:23] had this great plan in his mind and God
[9:26] knew this would be the time that you
[9:27] came on the scene Hallelujah
[9:30] so the first step is for
[9:32] knowledge the second step is
[9:34] predestination according to Romans 8:29
[9:38] the third step here is in verse 30 then
[9:43] he predestinate he did also call now the
[9:47] word call is the same word for election
[9:50] or choosing Hallelujah so first you were
[9:54] forn and then God predestined the time
[9:57] you'd be here and then when you got here
[9:59] then God called you hallelujah amen
[10:02] hallelujah and I was I was happy to see
[10:04] I was right there when you got called
[10:05] Hallelujah I was just about a year ago
[10:07] by God's grace I saw it Hallelujah God
[10:10] called you amen you were elected you
[10:13] were chosen to receive the word of God
[10:15] when others didn't receive it others
[10:17] turned their back on it you received it
[10:19] Hallelujah because God called you amen
[10:22] and you recognize God's call for your
[10:23] life
[10:24] Hallelujah and then when you did that
[10:26] the fourth step there in verse 30 is
[10:28] whom he he called he justified and
[10:31] remember that means declared righteous
[10:33] as you wish to be Hallelujah so you have
[10:38] because you accept Jesus Christ his
[10:39] sacrifice now he's declared you
[10:42] righteous he took your sin and he gave
[10:45] you his righteousness and now you are
[10:48] Justified you you have the righteousness
[10:50] of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and there's
[10:53] no condemnation to them that have the
[10:55] righteousness of Jesus Christ Heaven
[10:57] holds nothing against you how could it
[10:59] amen because you were in God's mind
[11:00] before the foundation of the world
[11:02] hallelujah thank you Jes heaven doesn't
[11:04] hold anything against you you're a child
[11:06] of God hallelujah amen it's glorious
[11:10] amen and then what's the last step
[11:11] church after all this what's the fifth
[11:13] step whom he has Justified he's also
[11:17] glorified brother Ram said that's your
[11:19] rapture why because you get a glorified
[11:21] body that's what the Rapture is death
[11:24] this this body of death is swallowed up
[11:27] with a new body it's swallowed up in a
[11:29] glorified body and so that's why brother
[11:32] says the Rapture is already in you amen
[11:34] because it's already part of the
[11:35] five-step process here it was for
[11:38] knowledge right and then it was
[11:39] predestination then election then you
[11:42] were Justified and just as sure as you
[11:44] were Justified you will be glorified
[11:46] Hallelujah Oh Glory
[11:49] Hallelujah it it's it's set up this is
[11:51] God's plan he set it up this way
[11:54] Hallelujah and if you've been Justified
[11:56] of course if you've been forgiven then
[11:58] it's just as sure you're going to go got
[11:59] a glorified body Hallelujah cuz this is
[12:01] God's
[12:03] steps amen now go to acts 17 there's a
[12:07] beautiful verse here I've used this all
[12:09] throughout my life since I was a
[12:11] Christian and it lets me know God wanted
[12:14] me to be an acran it lets me know God
[12:17] chose me to be an
[12:19] akran and God chose you to be here in
[12:22] Junction City God already knew that it's
[12:25] not well just it was luck or it was just
[12:27] a chance no God brought brother Irvin
[12:29] here hallelujah right didn't y'all y'all
[12:32] left some other place right and come to
[12:34] this place right what state did you
[12:36] leave Michigan where you were from
[12:39] Michigan Michigan and Nebraska is where
[12:40] Michigan Nebraska where did Brother re
[12:43] where did you come from homes count okay
[12:46] Glory we're both from
[12:48] Ohio amen acts
[12:54] 17 verse 26 and hath made of one blood
[12:58] all nations of men for to dwell on the
[13:00] face of the Earth and hath what
[13:02] determined God determined the times
[13:04] before appointed and the bounds of your
[13:07] habitation hallelujah amen see God
[13:11] already predetermined this this was
[13:12] already set up in God's mind God wanted
[13:14] you to live in Ohio so you can hear the
[13:16] message hallelujah amen glory and then
[13:19] God determined this is the year right
[13:22] this is the year 2024 but God determined
[13:24] last year would be the year that you
[13:26] received it God determined all this time
[13:29] God didn't want you to live 2,000 years
[13:31] ago God didn't want you to live 6,000
[13:32] years God wanted you to live right now
[13:35] because you he built you in a certain
[13:36] way that you would manifest Christ for
[13:39] this generation hallelujah amen
[13:42] hallelujah I'm kind of glad I'm kind of
[13:44] glad I didn't have to be Noah I'm glad I
[13:45] didn't have to go through the ark you
[13:46] know what I mean amen I'm kind of glad
[13:48] about that I'm I'm glad to live in this
[13:50] day hallelujah amen I'll say like this
[13:52] I'm glad to live in this day because
[13:54] even Mar uh Martin Luther would drink a
[13:56] lot of alcohol and he would smoke cigars
[13:58] and you know he didn't really live a
[14:00] clean life I'm glad I get to live a
[14:02] clean life Hallelujah God could have had
[14:04] me get saved in the 1500s I could have
[14:06] been there with Martin Luther you know
[14:08] it's 1517 when he nailed those 95 thesis
[14:10] to the church door
[14:12] 1517 you know I'm glad I got to live in
[14:14] 2017
[14:16] Hallelujah because uh you know God's
[14:18] revealed more of his word now and now I
[14:20] can live a holy life a more holy Life by
[14:22] God's grace right does that make sense
[14:24] Hallelujah so see church we got to
[14:26] remember God determined you would live
[14:29] right now and you determine which state
[14:31] you'd live
[14:32] in Ohio Hallelujah of all places thank
[14:36] you brother I appreciate God would
[14:37] reward you sir thank you
[14:40] Hallelujah now why did God determine
[14:42] this look at the next verse uh sister uh
[14:44] Ruth do you want to read verse 27 would
[14:46] that be okay sister Ruth that they
[14:48] should seek the Lord if half they might
[14:51] feel after him and find him though he be
[14:54] not far from every one of us amen so why
[14:57] did God determine 20 24 and Ohio so you
[15:00] would seek after him Amen in other words
[15:03] God put you in the best place to hear
[15:05] the word of God and then seek his face
[15:08] wow are you with me everybody with me
[15:10] amen amen this is God's plan God put you
[15:13] in the best place to hear the word of
[15:16] God to come to know God and to seek
[15:18] after God hallelujah amen hallelujah God
[15:21] couldn't have set it up any better for
[15:23] you right God determined this before the
[15:26] foundation of the world he fornew you be
[15:29] here he predetermined all these events
[15:31] of your life and what does he want you
[15:33] to do he wants you to reach out and try
[15:34] to know him oh hallelujah amen glory to
[15:38] God thank you Jesus verse 28 for in him

[15:52] offspring remember friends we're not
[15:54] he's not far from us
[15:56] hallelujah is that in the next verse
[16:00] though he be not
[16:02] far 27 okay so we already read that yes
[16:05] yes yeah we because he's not far from us
[16:08] so you know we we don't need to feel
[16:10] like God is some way far off you know
[16:12] God and he's not interested he's really
[16:14] the Bible said he's nigh to us right
[16:16] he's close to us he's determin the steps
[16:19] of your habitation I'm going to just
[16:20] tell this story real quick uh if you've
[16:22] been up to our church in akan you've met
[16:24] probably the sarpong family they're from
[16:27] uh they're from Africa
[16:29] they're the uh family from
[16:31] Ghana okay so they were raised you know
[16:34] uh they they they come in the message
[16:37] right and they had a family uh and then
[16:41] they got the chance to come to
[16:43] America and one of the Saints uh a
[16:45] sister there was was concerned and she
[16:47] was a little nervous she she'd seen a
[16:49] lot of Gans come to America and lose
[16:51] their faith in God because of all the
[16:52] Temptations right money and pleasure and
[16:55] all these
[16:56] things and uh she was really
[16:59] uh just nervous about it and she said oh
[17:02] Lord you know am she's just wondering am
[17:04] I going to leave the message once I get
[17:06] to America so when she got here God sent
[17:09] her to akan I looked it up it's over
[17:11] 5,000 miles unal she flew 5,000 miles
[17:16] across the ocean and she's like where I
[17:19] don't even know if there's a message
[17:20] Church in akan she's like I don't even
[17:23] know if I'm going to be able to live the
[17:24] word of God can I even live the message
[17:26] in America hallelujah amen but see God
[17:29] before she even flew over here God had
[17:31] already set up a message Church
[17:34] wow God had already prepared a place
[17:37] because God predetermined that
[17:40] Hallelujah and so when she got here she
[17:42] reached out is there you know she called
[17:43] the the the most local pastors and they
[17:45] say yes there's a message church right
[17:47] there in akan and our church is
[17:48] literally 10 minutes from her
[17:52] house and she said she said that verse
[17:54] right there in Acts 17 has helped her so
[17:56] much because God determined she wasn't
[17:59] sure should I go to America or not
[18:00] should I am I going to Lose My Faith or
[18:02] not but she she said Lord she she said a
[18:05] she set a fleece before the Lord like

[18:45] our good amen all things work together
[18:47] for our good
[18:48] hallelujah oh it's beautiful
[18:51] Hallelujah now there's another verse
[18:52] just so you know 1 Peter 1 ver2 brother
[18:54] John you want to read that 1 Peter 1:2
[18:57] here's another verse that says the for
[18:59] knowledge of God there's only two in the
[19:01] whole Bible right brother Ram said God
[19:04] predestines based upon for knowledge God
[19:07] forew who you'd be what you would be
[19:10] like uh where you'd live what time you'd
[19:13] live and based upon that for knowledge
[19:15] he could predestinate events of your
[19:16] life Hallelujah so brother John want to
[19:18] read that elect according to the forn
[19:20] knowledge of God the Father through
[19:23] sanctification of the spirit unto
[19:25] obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
[19:27] Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be
[19:30] multiplied all right thank you brother
[19:33] so everybody can see that what do we
[19:34] elect what are we chosen to we're chosen
[19:37] uh according to the for knowledge of God
[19:39] that's the first step God's for
[19:41] knowledge God forne we be here God
[19:44] fornew Us in his
[19:46] thoughts and because of that then he
[19:48] could predestinate us he could elect us
[19:50] he could choose us he could call us and
[19:52] then he could justify us and then he
[19:54] will glorify us amen hallelujah think of
[19:57] that brother Ram I'm sorry think of that
[19:59] you know Jesus already has a glorified
[20:01] body hallelujah amen amen oh it's it's
[20:04] glorious hallelujah we're going to get a
[20:05] glorified body as well Hallelujah and a
[20:08] glorified body brother B says a is a
[20:10] glorified condition of your physical
[20:12] body and it's a glorified body can also
[20:15] eat food as well brother Braham said it
[20:17] can walk through walls because Jesus
[20:19] would they had their door shut after the
[20:20] resurrection and Jesus walked right
[20:22] through the door so your glorified body
[20:25] can walk right through these atoms right
[20:26] here and these molecules you can just
[20:28] walk right through it Hallelujah it can
[20:30] appear or
[20:31] disappear uh the glorified body uh is an
[20:34] eternal body hallelujah it's a glorified
[20:37] condition
[20:40] Hallelujah now uh there's a lot of good
[20:42] scriptures on here um I'm just going to
[20:44] hit the
[20:48] highlights because there's so much to uh
[20:51] to show here by the grace of God now
[20:53] each person has free moral agency right
[20:56] uh we're not going to have to read all
[20:57] these but um
[20:59] you know Cain was given or Adam and Eve
[21:01] was given a choice the tree of life and
[21:03] the tree of knowledge good and evil God
[21:04] bless you brother Howard good to see you
[21:06] sir nice beard there brother looking
[21:07] good there
[21:08] Hallelujah right and then Cain had a
[21:10] choice God said if you do well in
[21:12] Genesis 4:7 won't you be accepted but he
[21:16] says but if you don't sin lies at the
[21:17] door right Hallelujah god Set life and
[21:21] death before Israel in Deuteronomy 30:
[21:24] 15-20 Joshua told Israel choose you this
[21:27] day whom you will serve
[21:30] so there is an there's an element where
[21:31] everybody has a choice brother B calls
[21:34] it free moral
[21:36] agency brother Ram said God had to give
[21:38] free agency or else people could come up
[21:40] to God and say God you made me go to
[21:43] hell so you know you can't send me to
[21:45] hell because you made me go to hell
[21:47] brother said God can't do that God has
[21:49] to give everybody free more agency right
[21:52] Hallelujah but because he forn knows
[21:54] what you would choose then he can
[21:56] predestinate you to receive the word of
[21:58] God
[21:59] amen said he knows the choice you'll
[22:01] make Hallelujah that's in the sermon uh
[22:04] 1965 uh just give me a moment there it's
[22:08] what message is that oh thirst yeah
[22:10] thirst listen to thirst 1965 it's a
[22:13] beautiful message this is It's A
[22:14] Beautiful message about the soul and how
[22:16] your soul has a thirst and God gives
[22:18] Every Soul a thirst to know him David
[22:21] said my soul thirst for the Living God
[22:23] Amen
[22:25] Hallelujah so we see it we we have to
[22:28] have uh we have to have this
[22:30] understanding of God to know God is fair
[22:32] God gives everybody free more agency and
[22:35] I love what Jesus said Jesus said the
[22:36] Holy Ghost is to any man how many know
[22:39] uh John 7 uh 37 Jesus said If any man
[22:43] thirsts let him come to me and drink
[22:46] Hallelujah If any man see how the Holy
[22:48] Ghost is available to anybody If any man
[22:52] thirst do you ever check you ever check
[22:54] this Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the
[22:57] bride say come

[23:00] him that's a thirst come and whosoever
[23:03] will let him take the Water of Life
[23:06] freely everybody say whosoever will
[23:07] ready whosoever will If any man
[23:10] whosoever will see the the Waters of
[23:12] Life the Holy Ghost are open to anybody
[23:14] any can anybody can receive it right
[23:17] Judas could Cain could have anybody
[23:19] could receive the uh the word of God
[23:21] it's it's free more age it's your choice
[23:23] thank God you made the choice hallelujah
[23:26] thank God I made the choice Hallelujah
[23:27] to drink of the Waters of Life
[23:30] Hallelujah now that I drink of this
[23:32] water brother Irvin I'll never thirst
[23:33] again I'm talking about spiritual
[23:36] water right we'll never thirst for the
[23:39] things of the world we'll never go back
[23:40] to the world and and leave Christianity
[23:42] no way we we we've had Living Water
[23:45] Hallelujah and the Bible said it bubbles
[23:47] up inside of us and it overflows
[23:50] sometimes and such Joy such shouting
[23:52] such worship such prayers amen it just
[23:55] overflows it's Living Water hallelujah
[23:58] oh my
[23:59] thank God hallelujah thank you
[24:01] Jesus it's to anyone now look at 2 Peter
[24:05] 3:9 Sister Sarah do you want to read
[24:07] that one when you get a chance 2 Peter
[24:11] 3:9 2 Peter 3:9 said God wishes uh I'm
[24:16] sorry God's not willing that any should
[24:19] perish this shows God's forn knowledge
[24:21] right this shows God's mercy so whenever
[24:25] you're ready sister uh 2 Peter 3:9
[24:38] amen see God Is So merciful he gives
[24:41] each person free more agency he wants
[24:44] them to be saved but of course he knows
[24:46] few there be that find
[24:48] it okay so I just want to show you this
[24:50] other side and church there there is the
[24:53] other side where you know God told Jesus
[24:56] or Jesus said I won't pray for the world
[24:58] remember that in John 17 he said I pray
[25:00] for my followers I pray not for the
[25:02] world like there came a time when when
[25:04] when Jesus was instructed to the father
[25:06] because he said I only do what the
[25:07] father shows me there came a time when
[25:09] he didn't pray for the Pharisees anymore
[25:11] right right because God must have gave
[25:12] the understanding these are serpent seed
[25:14] they're beyond Redemption they're not
[25:16] going to receive it right but God was
[25:19] merciful to them God God let them hear
[25:21] Jesus's preaching they had a chance they
[25:23] had the free more agency but it got to
[25:26] the point where like brother said they
[25:28] pass pass the line between mercy and
[25:29] judgment the Bible calls it the
[25:31] reprobate mind when a person gets a
[25:33] reprobate mind they'll never come to
[25:35] Christ that's in uh Romans chapter 1
[25:38] they they've gone past that they've gone
[25:40] past the opportunity to receive him and
[25:42] that's what happened to the Pharisees
[25:43] that's why Jesus said I pray not for the
[25:45] world but I pray for those who will
[25:47] believe on me through their word
[25:49] hallelujah amen oh
[25:51] my oh it's beautiful now you you don't
[25:55] have to read this but first Peter 2 ver4
[25:58] the Bible said who will have all men to
[26:00] be saved and come unto the knowledge of
[26:02] the truth that means he wishes in the
[26:04] Greek doesn't mean everybody's going to
[26:05] be saved it means god wishes to have all
[26:08] men to be saved just like our sister
[26:10] read thank you sister
[26:12] Sarah did you know this one Ezekiel 3311
[26:16] says as I live sayeth the Lord I have no
[26:19] pleasure in the death of the wicked
[26:21] anybody ever remember that remember that
[26:22] verse God doesn't Delight when Sinners
[26:25] die God doesn't because that they're
[26:27] missing out on eternal life
[26:28] right God doesn't Delight in
[26:31] that it it wasn't a delight when Judas
[26:34] betrayed Jesus you remember what Jesus
[26:35] called him he called him a friend the
[26:38] night he was betrayed he called him a
[26:40] friend right yo this this shows the
[26:44] heart of God the love of God God wants
[26:46] these people to be
[26:49] saved but in God's mind of course Church
[26:51] in God's mind does he know what they're
[26:53] going to choose yes and that's why he
[26:56] calls us vessels of Honor and he calls
[26:59] the Sinners vessels of
[27:01] Dishonor right that's Romans chapter n
[27:04] he said I made Pharaoh as vessel Of
[27:06] Dishonor but so I could show my power to
[27:09] Israel hallelujah amen glory to God Amen
[27:13] so see God because God forn knows what
[27:15] they're going to choose he could Harden
[27:17] Pharaoh's heart 10 times right he could
[27:19] Harden his heart 10 times and show his
[27:21] power to Egypt and also to Israel
[27:25] because he fornew what was in Pharaoh's
[27:27] heart he knew it wasn't in Pharaoh's
[27:28] heart to repent so he could use him as a
[27:31] vessel Of Dishonor oh but he knew what
[27:33] was in Moses's heart Hallelujah he knows
[27:35] what's in your heart hallelujah amen
[27:38] because he's got four knowledge he knows
[27:41] you Hallelujah he determined where you'd
[27:43] live he determined when you'd live
[27:45] Hallelujah he knows that you'll love and
[27:46] serve him hallelujah amen yall remember
[27:49] Jeremiah chapter 1 right let's read
[27:51] let's turn
[27:55] there this is just comforting to know
[27:57] that whatever God has called you to be
[28:00] it was before you were before you were
[28:02] even formed in the womb God had already
[28:05] determined what you would do right verse
[28:07] four Jeremiah 1 ver4 then the word of
[28:10] the Lord came unto me saying before I
[28:11] formed thee in the belly I knew thee oh
[28:14] there it is hallelujah there's that form
[28:16] knowledge

[28:21] product of a conception in your mother's
[28:23] womb before that I already knew you oh

[28:38] you and before thou camest out of the
[28:41] womb I Sanctified thee and ordained thee

[28:51] a prophet amen hallelujah God him
[28:55] already ordained that just like Jeremiah

[29:16] The Bridge says I know how the story
[29:18] ends we will be with him
[29:21] again oh Hallelujah God gives us
[29:25] understanding of his for knowledge
[29:27] Hallelujah we already know how it ends

[36:23] not have crucified him if they known
[36:24] what was going to happen he sent the
[36:26] Holy Ghost amen and then The Same Spirit
[36:28] that was in Christ is now in the
[36:29] Believers amen he didn't know that so it
[36:32] was a mystery but God God hid that
[36:35] mystery from
[36:36] them
[36:40] now brother R said this I love this
[36:42] quote it's from a 1960 brother BR said
[36:44] by four knowledge God saw that I would
[36:47] love him so he made a propit through his
[36:50] own son that through him I might go from
[36:54] a sinner to a he said a grain of wheat
[36:58] all you Farmers here hallelujah isn't
[37:00] that wonderful amen hallelujah so
[37:03] brother said before the foundation World
[37:05] God knew William brandham would love
[37:07] Christ so God sent Christ for William
[37:10] brandham God sent Christ for junson City
[37:13] Church hallelujah amen God sent Christ
[37:16] for me amen because he knew I would love
[37:19] Christ that's what brother B said
[37:22] hallelujah oh it's
[37:25] wonderful now that's just a very very uh
[37:28] quick teaching there on predestination I
[37:31] like to move to the book of life because
[37:32] it all kind of goes together I'm only uh
[37:35] 20 I guess I'm 33 minutes into the
[37:38] sermon Hallelujah the first 33 minutes
[37:41] but i' like to uh transfer over now to
[37:44] the Book of
[37:45] Life Hallelujah brother R said the book
[37:47] of life he says is now he says different
[37:50] things but by the end he said the book
[37:51] of life is like one book and he says
[37:54] there's a section he said that's like we
[37:57] would say the Lamb's Book of Life
[37:58] section like this kind of like the old
[38:00] New Testament and then he said the rest
[38:02] is The Book of Life it's like a book
[38:05] with two
[38:06] sections okay but then there's also yeah
[38:09] there it's kind of like that and he says
[38:10] it in the church age book if you want if
[38:12] you want a really solid teaching read
[38:14] chapter 7even of the church age book how
[38:15] many you read to the church age book
[38:17] already okay two three praise God
[38:20] hallelujah I'll tell you'll be blessed
[38:22] if you read that church age book listen
[38:24] to the church age I'm sorry read the
[38:25] church age book and listen to those
[38:26] Seven Seals you're going to be blessed
[38:28] that's that's my life is founded on
[38:29] those right when I come in the message
[38:30] the first thing I did was read the
[38:31] church age book it's given me a solid
[38:34] position in Christ Hallelujah now you
[38:37] moms maybe can read it to your children
[38:39] during the Bible times
[38:41] Hallelujah that'd be a good thing to do
[38:43] I we've done that we read through the
[38:44] church age book as a family we read
[38:46] through uh the Bible as a family you
[38:48] know in our family devotion times that'd
[38:51] be a good thing to to to train the the
[38:53] children on that amen all right
[38:56] now now here's here's the mystery about
[38:58] the Book of Life the mystery is that
[39:01] some people's names can be removed not
[39:03] us because I told you you were chosen in
[39:05] Christ before the foundation of the
[39:08] world only people that the Bible says
[39:11] that forfeit or Cast Away or trample on
[39:15] the gospel only those people will have
[39:18] their names blotted out of the book of
[39:20] life and they can only be blotted out of
[39:23] the book of life section the book of
[39:26] life section but brother Ram said if
[39:28] your name was on the Lamb's Book of Life
[39:31] your name can never be blotted out and
[39:33] that's you and I hallelujah amen thank
[39:36] you Jesus our names can never be blotted
[39:38] out right because we never worship the
[39:40] Beast system right we won't bow down to
[39:43] Rome and say oh yeah I want your MK I
[39:46] want your cup of grape juice and I want
[39:48] your wafer that's going to and then
[39:50] church they actually believe that's the
[39:51] Holy Spirit they believe that the spirit
[39:54] and the body and they believe as long as
[39:55] that food is in their body then they
[39:57] they're under the anointing of God and
[40:00] so when they use the restroom and you
[40:02] know all all the digestion goes then
[40:03] they got to go have mass again to get
[40:05] the anointing back I'm glad we can get
[40:06] it back by just by praying Hallelujah
[40:09] I'm glad we can get the anointing back
[40:11] just by worshiping just by reading our
[40:13] Bibles amen amen it's not in a literal
[40:16] wafer or a or a little cup of grape
[40:20] juice or something like that the Bible
[40:22] said when we sin we grieve the holy
[40:24] spirit that means we offend the Holy
[40:25] Spirit brother says like a dove that
[40:26] flies away and'll set up here until
[40:29] you're ready to say Lord I'm sorry and
[40:31] then when you say when you repent he
[40:32] comes back and anoints you imagine that
[40:35] little Dove sitting on your shoulder
[40:37] there Hallelujah the sweetness of the
[40:40] Holy Spirit what said the sweetness and
[40:41] the tenderness of the Holy Spirit but
[40:43] when we get upset or we we say something
[40:44] mean that anointing just leaves our mind
[40:47] right and God's waiting for us to say
[40:50] Lord I'm sorry forgive me I love you I
[40:52] didn't mean to do that and then
[40:54] sometimes we got to go to that person
[40:55] and say I'm sorry you forgive me brother
[40:58] John will you forgive me I didn't mean
[40:59] to say that about you and then he said
[41:01] yes of course brother you're my brother
[41:03] and then that sweet Holy Spirit comes
[41:04] back well let me give you a hug brother
[41:05] you know how can I help you can I do
[41:08] anything for you amen hallelujah praise
[41:12] God thank the Lord now the book of life
[41:15] there's a lot of good verses we'll just
[41:16] hit the
[41:17] highlights now I want to prove to you
[41:20] um that people
[41:23] can they can receive the word but then
[41:26] they can lose the word right how many
[41:29] remember Luke 8:13 the parable of the
[41:31] four uh four grounds brother Howard you
[41:34] want to read that Luke 88:13 brother
[41:36] Luke
[41:37] 88:13 It's A Beautiful Parable remember
[41:39] I showed you those four grounds this is
[41:41] a while ago you probably forgot but
[41:42] listen there's four grounds there's four
[41:44] classes people can fall in there's the
[41:46] wise version the Holy Ghost filled
[41:48] that's the Lamb's Book of Life there's
[41:50] the foolish version that's the book of
[41:52] life that are saved and then there's the
[41:54] Judas scar group that's one we're going
[41:56] to read about now then their names are
[41:57] blotted off the book of life and then
[41:59] brother said that fourth group they they
[42:01] never believed in the beginning their
[42:02] names were never on the book of life he
[42:05] said like
[42:06] Pharaoh Pharaoh's name was never on
[42:08] there because he never believed in
[42:09] Moses's message right
[42:12] right is that amazing there's four
[42:15] groups there so brother Howard Luke
[42:17] 88:13 now this speaks of like a Judas
[42:20] who he believed for a while but then he
[42:23] he forfeited and he threw away he cast
[42:25] down eternal life and he didn't want it
[42:27] anymore so go ahead brother Luke
[42:30] 8:13
[42:32] on they
[42:40] receive all right everybody say the word
[42:43] for a while can you say that for a while
[42:45] for a while they believe but then they
[42:47] fall away and in the parable it's like a
[42:49] seed the S SED a seed and it grows up
[42:52] but then something comes around and
[42:53] snatches it up the Bible say Satan does
[42:56] that Satan will snatch up the word of
[42:58] God that was placed in someone's heart
[42:59] like Judas think about that church for 3
[43:02] and 1/2 years he served Jesus the Bible
[43:05] said he cast out Devils he cast out
[43:08] Devils but then at the end he got filled
[43:10] with Devils right he could cast out
[43:12] Devils he could pray for the sick but at
[43:14] the end he so wanted money so bad that
[43:17] he sold out Jesus for that money and
[43:19] then Satan filled his heart and then he
[43:22] of course committed suicide it's it's
[43:24] just it's just so sad he had the word of
[43:28] God and that's a good lesson too no
[43:31] matter how good your pastor is some
[43:33] people are just not going to believe
[43:35] because Judas had the best pastor there
[43:36] ever was amen right right some people
[43:39] blame the pastor some people blame the
[43:41] preachers but really it boils down to
[43:42] you amen amen boil is down to you right
[43:46] Pastor can't force you to do nothing a
[43:47] preacher can't make you to do nothing
[43:49] right right they're there the preacher
[43:51] is supposed to be the
[43:52] example right I'm supposed to be a
[43:54] servant to my church which I am I try to
[43:56] serve them
[43:57] I'm not I'm not the Lord over them I'm
[43:59] the servant to them hallelujah amen I'm
[44:01] the minister to
[44:04] them so see there's the verse people can
[44:06] receive the word of God but then if they
[44:10] don't uh if they're not careful they can
[44:13] forfeit the word of God okay
[44:17] now there's a lot of good
[44:21] scriptures the Bible said You Must
[44:23] Believe to the saving of your soul
[44:25] that's Hebrews 10:39 words you must
[44:27] believe your entire
[44:31] lifetime the Bible said in John 17:12
[44:33] Jesus said none of the disciples were
[44:35] lost but the son of
[44:37] predition so Judas was trusting to be
[44:39] saved for a while but then he forfeited
[44:42] his salvation you'd be surprised most
[44:44] churches believe once you're saved
[44:45] you're always saved
[44:47] right but what's the truth of that
[44:49] brother Iran the truth is once you're
[44:51] sealed you're always sealed amen
[44:55] hallelujah amen cuz Ephesians 4:30 says
[44:58] you're sealed not to the next Revival
[45:00] not to the next year but you're sealed
[45:02] until the day of your Redemption
[45:03] hallelujah amen that's the baptism of
[45:05] the Holy
[45:06] Ghost that's how you know you're sealed
[45:09] that's how you know you'll never lose it
[45:11] because you're sealed unto the day you
[45:13] get a brand new body Hallelujah the
[45:15] Bible says This Old House will be put
[45:17] down and you get a new house amen you
[45:19] get a new Tabernacle Hallelujah not made
[45:22] with man's hands it's Eternal in the
[45:24] heavens hallelujah amen thank you Jesus
[45:26] oh Glory
[45:29] Hallelujah now let's read uh I want you
[45:32] to see this here people can lose their
[45:35] part from the book of life it's
[45:36] Revelation
[45:38] 22:19 Revelation
[45:41] 22:19 sometimes I look around and
[45:42] brother John can you read that
[45:44] Revelation
[45:45] 22:19 and if any man shall take away
[45:47] from the words of the book of this
[45:49] prophecy God shall take away his part
[45:52] out of the book of life and out of the
[45:54] holy city and from the things which are
[45:57] written in this book amen can ever see
[46:01] that if you take away something from the
[46:03] gospel God will take your name out of
[46:06] the book of
[46:07] life right that's why we preach
[46:09] everything in here I'm not afraid of one
[46:11] verse I might not understand it but I
[46:13] know it's true Hallelujah I know God's
[46:15] right I know God doesn't lie
[46:18] Hallelujah that's that's why we got to
[46:19] preach the whole gospel that's why we
[46:21] need to meet on Thursday nights that's
[46:22] why we got to meet on Wednesday nights
[46:24] because we need to hear more of the word
[46:25] of God it's transforming right the Bible

[46:30] your mind what does it do it transforms
[46:32] you by the renewing of your mind amen

[50:07] leave it there Hallelujah Revelation 3:5

[54:17] book of life that means people will
[54:20] claim to have life Judas claimed to have
[54:22] life he claimed to be a disciple but
[54:25] then at the end he he forsook it he
[54:27] didn't want it anymore he'd rather have
[54:29] money than have Christ and so his name
[54:32] was blotted off the book of life and
[54:34] brother BR teaches us all the way
[54:36] through the message all the
[54:39] way all right Exodus
[54:44] 32:32 but Daniel you got that brother
[54:47] could you read
[54:50] 3232 yet now if thou will forgive their
[54:52] sin and if not BL the I pray the out of
[54:56] thy book which thou Hast written amen
[54:59] who wrote the book Jesus amen Jesus
[55:01] wrote the book and Moses you know the
[55:04] Israel had sinned so Moses said Lord
[55:06] blot me out and let the people be saved
[55:08] doesn't that sound familiar that's what
[55:10] Paul said in Romans 9:10 he said I wish
[55:13] I could be cursed so my brethren could
[55:14] be saved that's how you know you got the
[55:16] real Spirit of Christ you wish you could
[55:19] be lost so other people could be saved
[55:21] but you're going to be saved don't give
[55:23] up your salvation it's just it's just
[55:25] that desire I just I would do anything
[55:27] to see my family saved I do anything to
[55:30] see my loved one saved Hallelujah that's
[55:32] the spirit of Christ amen but don't
[55:35] forget verse 33 and the Lord said unto
[55:37] Moses whosoever ha sinned against me him
[55:40] will I blot out of my
[55:42] book see it's those who sin against God
[55:45] those are the ones God blots out all
[55:48] right is that clear now can everybody
[55:50] see names get blotted out in the Old
[55:52] Testament and the New

[59:47] all these different thoughts but I
[59:48] thought well I'm going to I feel led I
[59:50] was as I driving down here I felt led to
[59:51] preach on this one here all right now
[59:56] I'm just at a oh I paused it oh
[1:00:00] man
[1:00:02] sorry okay now we'll try to finish up
[1:00:05] here on the Book of Life here section
[1:00:09] okay now
[1:00:12] um in Exodus uh 32 we're not going to
[1:00:15] read it but um yeah we already read it
[1:00:18] God said whoever sinned against me their
[1:00:20] names will be blotted out right and then
[1:00:23] church did you know this Dan and
[1:00:24] ephraim's names were blotted out under
[1:00:27] Heaven did you know that it's in the
[1:00:28] church age book brother preach it in the
[1:00:30] seventh seal the tribe of Dan and the
[1:00:33] tri tribe of Ephraim set up
[1:00:35] Idols in in in the holy land and God
[1:00:39] blotted their names
[1:00:41] out right brother teaches it their names
[1:00:45] were there when they come out of Egypt
[1:00:47] um but brother but brother shows their
[1:00:49] names are not listed in Revelation 7
[1:00:52] right they're not listed there so in in
[1:00:56] the future when the 144,000 Jews get the
[1:00:58] Holy Ghost Dan and Ephraim won't be
[1:00:59] there but strangely and supernaturally
[1:01:03] their names are back in in the
[1:01:05] Millennium Temple which is what I'm
[1:01:07] going to preach maybe next time by God's
[1:01:08] grace so they get blotted out for their
[1:01:11] idolatry but then God lets them back
[1:01:14] in that talk about
[1:01:16] Mercy
[1:01:18] Hallelujah God blots them out under
[1:01:20] heaven for their adultery but they must
[1:01:22] repent at some place I don't know and
[1:01:24] they get back and then in the millennium
[1:01:26] there will be one of those tribe there
[1:01:27] be both tribes will be back you can look
[1:01:29] it up it's in Exodus I'm sorry it's
[1:01:31] Ezekiel 44 you you'll see
[1:01:33] it so we have in other words we have
[1:01:36] examples in the Bible where names are
[1:01:38] blotted out yeah all
[1:01:41] right um the other one did you know at
[1:01:44] Jesus crucifixion some of those people's
[1:01:47] names were blotted out because they
[1:01:48] blasphemed Jesus as he was being
[1:01:50] crucified did you know that that's
[1:01:52] Psalms uh 69 go to Psalms 69 I want you
[1:01:55] to see this
[1:01:58] here Psalm
[1:02:02] 69 we'll read 21 and
[1:02:06] 28 Psalm
[1:02:08] 69 21 and 28 now here's how you know
[1:02:11] it's talking about Jesus look at verse
[1:02:13] 21 they gave me also Gall for my meat
[1:02:16] and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to
[1:02:18] drink that sound familiar Jesus said I
[1:02:20] thirst I thirst and they put the sponge
[1:02:22] up there right with vinegar and he
[1:02:23] wouldn't take it
[1:02:26] now go down to verse
[1:02:28] 28 God said let them be blotted out of
[1:02:31] the book of the living and not be
[1:02:32] written with the
[1:02:34] righteous this was at the cross now look
[1:02:37] at this at the cross Jesus said father
[1:02:38] forgive them so they don't even know
[1:02:40] what they're
[1:02:41] doing but the Bible says some of their
[1:02:44] names were blotted
[1:02:45] out so what do we see we see as always
[1:02:48] there's a mixed multitude amen there's
[1:02:51] Sinners there's Saints there's people
[1:02:53] receiving Grace and there's people
[1:02:54] rejecting Grace in the same
[1:02:57] place Hallelujah so which one are you
[1:03:00] going to be I'm the one that's going to
[1:03:01] receive Grace Hallelujah so are you
[1:03:03] Hallelujah because you love God you love
[1:03:05] the word of God you love Jesus you love
[1:03:08] to worship God your heart is to do
[1:03:10] what's right
[1:03:12] hallelujah amen so I just gave you three
[1:03:15] examples from the Old Testament where
[1:03:16] names are blotted
[1:03:20] out
[1:03:22] amen Judas is scar of course is the type
[1:03:25] of the his name we believe was blotted
[1:03:27] out brother B says it was blotted
[1:03:29] out um he had a great ministry of the
[1:03:32] Holy Ghost but then he forfeited it at
[1:03:34] the end of his life the Bible said he
[1:03:35] went to his own place he went to hell
[1:03:38] he's called son of predition which means
[1:03:40] Son Of
[1:03:41] Destruction he was made to be
[1:03:44] destroyed he didn't overcome sin so
[1:03:46] Jesus said if you don't overcome
[1:03:48] remember in Revelation 3:5 Lally read it
[1:03:50] in Revelation 35 if you don't overcome
[1:03:51] I'll blot your name
[1:03:53] out okay
[1:03:57] Hallelujah so remember you can believe
[1:03:59] for a while people can believe for a
[1:04:01] while but they got to believe to the
[1:04:03] saving of their soul the Bible
[1:04:05] says
[1:04:07] hallelujah now brother Ram brother Ram
[1:04:09] takes uh much time in the church a book
[1:04:12] to show that God is Not compiling names
[1:04:14] right
[1:04:15] now God already wrote the names before
[1:04:18] the foundation of the world for
[1:04:19] salvation but I want to show you God
[1:04:22] does record names for rewards right now
[1:04:26] go to Malachi 3:15 how many remember

[1:04:37] down Daniel's name and Miriam got saved
[1:04:40] God's not writing God already wrote that

[1:05:12] them that fear the lord and that thought
[1:05:14] upon his

[1:07:41] 876 brother baham brings us out in the
[1:07:44] church age

[1:07:50] interesting I you know this might deal
[1:07:52] with uh the Millennium as well
[1:07:59] 876 brother Ram said there will be a
[1:08:01] future writing of names it's probably
[1:08:04] all the people that are born during the
[1:08:06] Millennium that come up to the house of
[1:08:08] God yes there's going to be people born
[1:08:11] there's going to be children born in the
[1:08:12] Millennium there's going to be death in
[1:08:14] the Millennium yeah the Bible says it
[1:08:17] yeah the Bible is plain on this brother
[1:08:19] Braham said sin doesn't end until after
[1:08:21] the great right Throne judgment brother
[1:08:22] Braham said there's sin before the
[1:08:24] Millennium during the millennium and
[1:08:25] then after the
[1:08:26] Millennium the final the final sin is it
[1:08:30] must be right before the great white
[1:08:31] Throne judgment right right before that
[1:08:34] oh yeah that's right the final sin is
[1:08:36] the Battle of go and
[1:08:37] Magog at the end of the Millennium
[1:08:40] that's the final sin Satan gathers all
[1:08:42] the world all these people that that
[1:08:44] were living for a thousand years Satan
[1:08:46] gathers all them deceives them they come
[1:08:48] against God and Jerusalem but God sends
[1:08:50] down Holy Fire the Bible said the holy
[1:08:52] spirit will be a wall of fire around us
[1:08:54] amen
[1:08:56] Hallelujah the Holy Ghost protects us
[1:08:58] now and then at the Battle of God and
[1:09:00] God the Holy Ghost will protect us there
[1:09:02] as well Hallelujah with a wall of fire
[1:09:04] around us
[1:09:06] amen oh it's beautiful Psalms
[1:09:10] 876 my wife always says that you say
[1:09:13] everything's beautiful brother Jesse I
[1:09:15] know I just that's my word
[1:09:18] hallelujah now look at verse six Psalm
[1:09:21] 876 the Lord shall count and he shall
[1:09:24] writeth up the people
[1:09:26] that this man was bornn there saah this
[1:09:28] speaking of the Glorious City if you
[1:09:30] look up in chapter I'm sorry in verse
[1:09:32] three the city of
[1:09:34] God so all the people that were born in
[1:09:37] Jerusalem the city of God in the
[1:09:39] Millennium it looks like their names are
[1:09:42] going to be written down there as well
[1:09:44] but don't forget your name was written
[1:09:47] before the foundation of the world in
[1:09:49] the Lamb's Book of
[1:09:50] Life because you will not accept the
[1:09:53] Beast system you to accept the kingdom
[1:09:56] of Jesus Christ that's what you have
[1:09:58] accepted amen Now give me maybe 15 more
[1:10:01] minutes let's finish with this thought
[1:10:03] on hell is not Eternal I was sharing
[1:10:04] with brother iring he gave me a good
[1:10:05] smile so I thought well I'll finish with
[1:10:07] this by God's
[1:10:09] grace when I see him smileing know that
[1:10:12] must be a good Revelation you know CU he
[1:10:14] gets happy at Revelation so do
[1:10:16] I now we don't have we have to go all
[1:10:18] the way through this but
[1:10:22] um we'll hit the highlights
[1:10:25] so go to 1 John
[1:10:28] 3:15 because this really I mean this
[1:10:30] might have confused us a little bit but
[1:10:32] it's not we'd say like a major teaching
[1:10:34] the major thing brother BR said is get
[1:10:35] saved right and the Holy Ghost those are
[1:10:38] the majors brother BR said even Divine
[1:10:40] Healing is a minor he said you can't
[1:10:42] major on a minor right that's what
[1:10:45] brother B says in other words your main
[1:10:47] emphasis should be getting people saved
[1:10:48] filled with the Holy Ghost and then if
[1:10:50] they're sick yes pray for the sick
[1:10:53] brother man you can have Services just
[1:10:54] dedicated to Healing sick like he did
[1:10:56] like with perfect faith in
[1:10:58] 1963 uh desperations 1963 he had all
[1:11:01] these services for cuz he had a lot of
[1:11:03] sick people in his church but he said
[1:11:05] you can't major on those things you have
[1:11:08] to Major on getting people saved getting
[1:11:10] people filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:11:12] amen Now 1 John 3:15 let me read
[1:11:17] that and this if you just think about
[1:11:20] this you'll catch the Revelation so
[1:11:23] almost every Church says
[1:11:26] Sinners will burn eternally how many
[1:11:28] have ever heard that raise your
[1:11:29] hand and I I believe that too before I
[1:11:31] heard the message once I heard the
[1:11:33] message I was like how could I miss
[1:11:35] that what were you thinking you that
[1:11:39] that's what that's right I wasn't
[1:11:40] thinking I was just thinking about
[1:11:41] denominations I just thinking about uh
[1:11:44] uh you know the their simple lessons
[1:11:46] they never took us down deep in the word
[1:11:48] and I found out later the Roman Catholic
[1:11:50] Church started that Dogma did you know
[1:11:52] that I wouldn't know it the Roman
[1:11:53] Catholic Church started father son Holy
[1:11:55] Ghost they started transubstantiation
[1:11:57] which is that bread and wine turning
[1:11:58] into literal body and blood and they
[1:12:00] also started this that people burn
[1:12:03] eternally they were trying to scare
[1:12:04] people into becoming part of the church
[1:12:06] so they said if you don't come a part of
[1:12:08] our Catholic Church you're going to burn
[1:12:09] eternally oo I guess I'll give my money
[1:12:12] to you preacher or priest right right
[1:12:15] they tried to scare him into serving God
[1:12:19] but God does not give us a spirit of
[1:12:20] fear but a power and love of a sound
[1:12:23] mind Hallelujah
[1:12:25] you've been a good audience tonight God
[1:12:26] you're always a good audience H 1 John
[1:12:29] 3:15 whosoever hateth his brother is a
[1:12:31] murderer and now here here it is and you
[1:12:34] know that no murder hath eternal life
[1:12:37] abiding in
[1:12:39] him there's the
[1:12:42] Revelation now what's the
[1:12:45] Revelation anyone who dies as a murderer
[1:12:48] without confessing their sin and being
[1:12:50] forgiven they don't have eternal life so
[1:12:53] what does that mean if you have eternal
[1:12:55] life you can't burn eternally
[1:12:59] right right in order to burn eternally
[1:13:03] Without End you got to have a life that
[1:13:06] can help you to burn
[1:13:08] eternally right in that beautiful right
[1:13:12] and the Bible says we are now the sons
[1:13:14] of God we already have eternal life
[1:13:17] hallelujah amen when you got the Holy
[1:13:19] Ghost you've already got a portion of
[1:13:21] eternal life in your soul because God is
[1:13:24] life God is love God is a spirit if you
[1:13:27] got the Holy Spirit you got a portion of
[1:13:29] eternal life Hallelujah plus you got
[1:13:31] your name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:13:33] amen my name is in the book of life amen
[1:13:35] I heard a preacher one time say it was
[1:13:37] just made me laugh he said God wrote a
[1:13:39] great book one time and he called it one
[1:13:41] word
[1:13:43] life I was like Glory I like that God
[1:13:46] wrote a book before the foundation world
[1:13:48] and it was one word on the front
[1:13:51] life I'm glad my name's in The Book of
[1:13:54] Life I'm glad he gave me his life
[1:13:57] hallelujah oh
[1:13:58] my now we're not going to read it but
[1:14:00] Revelation 218 says no murder will I'm
[1:14:04] sorry it says murderers will not have
[1:14:06] any part in the holy
[1:14:08] city so see anyone that murders or
[1:14:10] adultery or fornication these sins if
[1:14:12] they don't repent of that they'll have
[1:14:14] no part in God's Eternal City amen and
[1:14:18] no murderer has eternal life right so
[1:14:22] brother Ram tells us plainly he says
[1:14:25] unbelievers do not have eternal life
[1:14:26] therefore they can't burn
[1:14:33] eternally now let me read
[1:14:36] uh I got to find this quote brother Bram
[1:14:38] gives us a beautiful quote from the
[1:14:39] church age book
[1:14:43] here look brother R say it's a beautiful
[1:14:47] thought brother R says quote now if a
[1:14:50] sinner is going to go to hell and then
[1:14:52] suffer the same as you are going to to
[1:14:55] heaven and enjoy heaven then he has the
[1:14:57] same kind of life you have
[1:15:00] already that's why I told Brother Irvin
[1:15:02] and he had a good smile there before
[1:15:04] service in other words if a sinner is
[1:15:07] going to go to the Lake of Fire and
[1:15:08] suffer the same amount of time as you're
[1:15:10] going to go to heaven enjoy blessings
[1:15:12] The Sinner already has the same kind of
[1:15:14] life you have as a
[1:15:16] Believer right if he if a sinner is
[1:15:19] going to burn eternally he's already got
[1:15:21] the same kind of life that I've got well
[1:15:23] then why did I need eternal life I mean
[1:15:25] I'm still either way you're going to
[1:15:27] live eternally right right and that
[1:15:29] shows the ridiculous uh the
[1:15:31] Ridiculousness of that false Doctrine he
[1:15:33] can't burn eternally because he doesn't
[1:15:35] have eternal life he never received
[1:15:37] Christ but if you receive Christ you
[1:15:39] have eternal life
[1:15:42] Hallelujah you'd be surprised people
[1:15:44] look at us say you don't believe they
[1:15:46] burn eternally how can they burn
[1:15:48] eternally they don't have eternal
[1:15:50] life right amen it's just it's so
[1:15:53] obvious
[1:15:56] amen
[1:15:59] hallelujah and I've told people too you
[1:16:02] you see you call God a god of love and
[1:16:04] then a god of love is going to let
[1:16:05] somebody burn for unending years when
[1:16:08] they only let's say let's say they died
[1:16:09] at 50 they only had 50 years as a sinner
[1:16:11] and you God's going to punish them for
[1:16:13] unending years for just 50 years of
[1:16:16] crimes no no no no judge would do that
[1:16:19] in this world
[1:16:21] right if if you were just caught
[1:16:23] jaywalking would a judge give you a a
[1:16:25] life sentence just for one thing of
[1:16:27] course not that judge has common sense
[1:16:30] and if that judge has Common Sense how
[1:16:32] much more does God have amen the Bible
[1:16:35] said God is a just recompensar of all
[1:16:38] sins he's fair right God's not going to
[1:16:41] give you uh let's just say 10 trillion
[1:16:44] years like that's we can't even fa God's
[1:16:46] not going to give somebody 10 trillion
[1:16:47] years of burning in hell just for 50
[1:16:50] years of
[1:16:51] sinning does everybody understand that
[1:16:54] right
[1:16:55] and and they say we don't believe God's
[1:16:57] a god of love I'm like you're the one
[1:16:59] that doesn't believe God's a god of love
[1:17:01] you believe God's going to punish people
[1:17:02] unending for just 50 years I believe in
[1:17:06] the god of love and mercy hallelujah
[1:17:08] amen I believe
[1:17:10] that now I want to actually I want to
[1:17:12] say this as well
[1:17:16] uh hell is not the same as the Lake of
[1:17:19] Fire how many know that hell's not the
[1:17:22] good good hell's not the same hell is uh
[1:17:25] the place of Torment it's a prison house
[1:17:27] Jesus talks about it in Luke 16 right
[1:17:29] the rich man and Lazarus die both go
[1:17:31] down to Hell right and there was the
[1:17:34] paradise there was the Believers and
[1:17:35] then there was the Sinners and the the
[1:17:38] rich man said I'm in this flame so he
[1:17:40] says a flame like one flame and he said
[1:17:43] uh send Lazarus to get me a drop of
[1:17:45] water from my tongue right
[1:17:48] right and the but then the Bible said
[1:17:51] Jesus went and preached to the souls
[1:17:52] that were in prison so Jesus went down
[1:17:54] down and it's a prison house but when
[1:17:57] Jesus went down he didn't he didn't come
[1:17:58] up by himself he brought all the saints
[1:18:00] up out of the heart of the Earth the
[1:18:02] Bible said he changed Paradise he
[1:18:05] changed Paradise to the heart of the
[1:18:06] earth and then he ascended on high and
[1:18:08] he led them up to heaven now Paradise is
[1:18:11] in heaven because we've got the blood of
[1:18:12] Jesus Christ aren't you glad church if
[1:18:14] somebody dies here a Christian they
[1:18:16] don't go down they go up hallelujah amen
[1:18:20] the the Lazarus was taken down by the
[1:18:22] Angels but now we don't go down we go up
[1:18:24] Hallelujah we go up to heaven cuz we've
[1:18:27] got Precious Blood amen amen oh precious
[1:18:29] is the flow that makes me white as snow
[1:18:32] no other Fountain I know nothing but the
[1:18:35] blood of Jesus
[1:18:37] hallelujah oh thank you
[1:18:39] Lord now I'm trying to find a spot to
[1:18:42] close
[1:18:44] here yeah go to Revelation chapter 20
[1:18:47] I'm going to prove it to you because
[1:18:48] this is what I told brother uran too the
[1:18:50] Bible says hell gets cast into the Lake
[1:18:53] of Fire
[1:18:55] so does death yeah right the angel of
[1:18:58] death the death angel we talk we hear
[1:18:59] about that the death angel in Exodus the
[1:19:02] death angel came to get all the
[1:19:03] firstborn right right so uh Revelation
[1:19:08] 20 13- 14 Revelation 201 13- 14 and the
[1:19:12] Sea gave up the dead which were in it
[1:19:14] and death and Hell delivered up the dead
[1:19:15] which were in them and they were judged
[1:19:17] every man according to their Works see
[1:19:19] their free more
[1:19:20] agency verse 14 and death and Hell we're
[1:19:25] cast into the Lake of Fire this is the
[1:19:27] second death all right so that that that
[1:19:31] that place that prison house in the
[1:19:33] heart of the Earth is going to be taken
[1:19:35] and thrown into the Lake of Fire and the
[1:19:38] Lake of Fire will destroy everything
[1:19:43] Hallelujah all right brother bam said
[1:19:45] hell had a beginning he said but you and
[1:19:48] I never had a
[1:19:50] beginning we were chosen in God before
[1:19:53] the foundation of the world
[1:19:55] amen you you are a part you're a thought
[1:19:58] you're a child of the Eternal one amen
[1:20:01] hallelujah the Jesus said hell was
[1:20:05] created or prepared for the devil and
[1:20:07] his angels hell had a beginning heaven
[1:20:10] I'm sorry God never had a beginning
[1:20:13] God's that that's that's what Eternal
[1:20:15] means you never had a beginning you
[1:20:16] never have an ending and you were chosen
[1:20:18] the mind of God before the foundation
[1:20:20] world you you brother says you're a part
[1:20:23] of the Eternal one amen glory Jesus all
[1:20:28] right now that's uh Matthew
[1:20:31] 25:41 then shall you say also unto them
[1:20:33] on the left hand depart from me ye curse
[1:20:36] into Everlasting fire prepared for the
[1:20:38] devil and his
[1:20:40] angels okay so see hell had a beginning
[1:20:43] but God never had a beginning and you
[1:20:46] were in God you were chosen the mind of
[1:20:48] God before the foundation of the world
[1:20:51] let me find some last few scriptures
[1:20:53] here
[1:21:00] I wanted to uh
[1:21:01] show uh Jesus
[1:21:04] said uh let's go over how uh Jesus said
[1:21:08] uh people will be destroyed and then
[1:21:10] Satan has an ending the Bible says Satan
[1:21:12] has an ending thank God for that how
[1:21:13] many you looking for to that day amen no
[1:21:15] more Satan no more devil no more tempter
[1:21:18] Hallelujah
[1:21:20] so uh Jesus said be be aware of the the
[1:21:23] one who can destroy your soul and Body
[1:21:26] in hell so let me look that one up I
[1:21:28] can't find it in my
[1:21:31] notes if you know it you can uh shout it
[1:21:33] out but it's uh Matthew 10:28 let's read
[1:21:36] that Matthew 10:28 brother Dani you want
[1:21:37] to get that Matthew 10:28 and I'll look
[1:21:39] up
[1:21:41] uh about Satan he'll have an
[1:21:45] end so whenever you're ready brother you
[1:21:47] can read
[1:21:50] that and fear not them which kill the
[1:21:53] body but are not able to kill the soul
[1:21:56] but rather fear him which is able to
[1:21:58] destroy both soul and body and Hell amen
[1:22:02] destroy bring to an end
[1:22:07] Hallelujah the B brother man calls it
[1:22:10] Annihilation Satan uh hell death all the
[1:22:14] demons all the Sinners will be
[1:22:16] annihilated and there'll be no
[1:22:18] more I don't know how that works but God
[1:22:20] must have some type of recycle bin right
[1:22:22] we got we on our phones we got recycle
[1:22:24] you delete it it's it's gone I don't
[1:22:27] know where it is God's got to recycling
[1:22:30] he's got to
[1:22:31] delete he created it he can delete it he
[1:22:34] could create matter and he can destroy
[1:22:35] matter amen we can amen but God can
[1:22:38] create it and God can destroy
[1:22:42] it all right now I'm looking to uh
[1:22:46] Ezekiel

[1:22:52] we'll finish with this you've been a
[1:22:53] great audience thank you for your
[1:22:54] patience I don't know how long I preach
[1:22:56] uh probably long enough by God's
[1:23:00] grace
[1:23:04] uh now this score speaking of Satan in
[1:23:07] verse uh 2813 thou has been an e in the
[1:23:09] garden of God that's we know Satan
[1:23:11] possessed The Serpent and the serpent
[1:23:13] had adultery with Eve right we preached
[1:23:15] on that verse 14 said Satan used to be
[1:23:17] the anointed cherub the the angel that
[1:23:20] covered the The Mercy Seat of God in
[1:23:22] heaven the Throne of God I believe there
[1:23:24] was two angels I can't prove this but I
[1:23:26] believe one was Michael and one was
[1:23:27] Lucifer cuz that's what Moses had Moses
[1:23:30] had the Ark of the Covenant there was
[1:23:31] two angels right there that's what I
[1:23:33] believe but I could be wrong I'm not it
[1:23:35] doesn't really matter it doesn't deal
[1:23:36] with
[1:23:38] salvation now look at verse 15 Satan was
[1:23:41] perfect in the in the ways from the day
[1:23:43] that he was created till iniquity was
[1:23:45] found in
[1:23:47] him but look at verse 17 thine heart was
[1:23:50] lifted up because of his Beauty so you
