[0:03] Now if he is our absolute there can be
[0:06] no other absolute.
[0:09] Greetings friends in the matchless
[0:11] [music] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:13] The purpose of this video is to answer
[0:15] the question would you rather have
[0:17] [music] the tapes of William Brham or
[0:19] the Bible? Recently I was thinking about
[0:21] this subject and just noticing how
[0:23] brother Brandham received revelation
[0:24] [music]
[0:25] from God. He did not receive revelation
[0:28] from God from his own tapes. [music] He
[0:30] received revelation from God according
[0:32] to the Bible. So, I'm [music] sure most
[0:34] of you who know me know my stance. If
[0:36] I'd rather have one or the other, I'd
[0:38] rather have the Holy Bible. [music]
[0:40] Thankfully, by God's grace, we don't
[0:41] have to choose between the two. We can
[0:43] have both. But the Bible is the
[0:45] absolute. Brother Brandham said his
[0:47] absolute was the Bible. Brother Brandham
[0:49] said God's absolute [music] is the
[0:51] Bible, and there's only one absolute,
[0:54] and there can be no other.
[0:56] But God's absolute is his word. He gives
[0:59] it and heavens and earth will pass away,
[1:01] but it shall never pass away. I like
[1:04] that. When we got one absolute, and
[1:07] that's the word of the living God, that
[1:09] settles it forever. No matter what
[1:11] anyone else says. Now, if he is our
[1:15] absolute, there can be no other
[1:17] absolute. You can't have say, "WELL, MY
[1:19] MY church is my absolute. My creed is my
[1:22] absolute." If Christ is your absolute,
[1:24] you believe Christ's word. There's no
[1:26] other way to do it.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; So, it is an undeniable fact that the
[1:31] Holy Bible is the absolute, God's
[1:34] absolute. That means it's the absolute
[1:36] of the universe and every true believer.
[1:38] The tapes are not the absolute. So, I'll
[1:41] leave a link in the description to the
[1:42] videos I've made about how the Bible is
[1:46] the absolute. I trust those will be a
[1:47] blessing to you by the grace of God. So,
[1:49] this video also exposes the complete
[1:52] idolatry of those who worship Brother
[1:54] Bram's tapes, such as those at the
[1:56] current Brandom Tabernacle who believe
[1:58] every word on tape is thus sayith the
[2:00] Lord. That's heresy. That's idolatry.
[2:03] And what they've done is they've
[2:04] worshiped the creature instead of the
[2:06] creator as Romans 1 25 and 26 say. They
[2:11] changed the truth of God into a lie and
[2:13] worship and serve the creature more than
[2:15] the creator who is blessed forever.
[2:17] Amen. For this cause God gave them up
[2:20] unto vile affections.
[2:22] If people will not repent of worshiping
[2:25] humans, whether prophets or tapes, God
[2:29] will give them up to their own devices.
[2:32] Friends, brother Brandham also said, "If
[2:34] I die in my tracks, my absolute is the
[2:37] word of God." He did not say, "If I die
[2:39] in my tracks and my and I'm at the point
[2:41] of death, my tapes are the absolute."
[2:45] Brother Graham also said, "My words will
[2:47] fail." And yet the Bible itself says,
[2:50] "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
[2:52] God's words will never fail. They'll
[2:54] never pass away." Brother Ram said,
[2:56] "It's also one of the most awful things
[2:58] to say that every word he says is
[3:00] infallible."
[3:02] Now, over the years, I've heard people
[3:04] say around the message that they've
[3:05] heard preachers hold up a Bible and
[3:08] quote books from Brother Brandham and
[3:10] raise the quote books higher and say
[3:12] they'd rather have the quote books of
[3:13] Brother Brandham than the Bible. Again,
[3:15] that's absolute heresy. That's a
[3:17] disgrace. That's a shame. That is the
[3:20] mark of a heathen. Alls one has to do is
[3:23] think, how did Brother Random get his
[3:24] revelations? Did he get his revelations
[3:26] from listening to his own tapes? No. He
[3:29] got revelation from the Holy Bible as
[3:31] this video will show here by the grace
[3:33] of God. But first, let's listen to a
[3:35] quote from Convinced and then Concerned
[3:37] 1962.
[3:39] Brother Ram said, "People are falling
[3:41] away and not interested in the Bible.
[3:44] They're falling away from the
[3:45] fundamental facts of the Bible." Brother
[3:47] Ram said, "I think all ministers who
[3:49] love the word of God and know that
[3:51] that's the only standard in which we can
[3:53] be assured that we're right. Not upon
[3:56] some theory like press play and obey,
[3:58] but upon the word of God. That's the
[4:00] only basis," Brother Random says. And
[4:02] then he tells a story of a black brother
[4:04] who said, "I'd rather be standing on the
[4:07] Bible than standing in heaven." And he
[4:09] was asked, "How would you think that?"
[4:11] He said, "Because heaven and earth will
[4:12] pass away, but my word won't pass away."
[4:15] Brother Ram said, 'I think he had
[4:16] something there. He said, 'If you're
[4:18] standing in heaven, it might pass away,
[4:20] but the word of God will never pass
[4:22] away. So, that's a good place to stand.
[4:24] And then he quoted Tommy Osborne, who
[4:26] said he wouldn't want to be
[4:27] sacriiggious, but he'd put down his
[4:29] Bible and stand on it to show that I'm
[4:31] standing there on the Bible. Brother
[4:33] Bram said that was rather very cute. And
[4:35] then he says, "People are getting away
[4:36] from their interest in the Bible." And
[4:38] isn't that true? Tape worshippers, alls
[4:40] they think about is tapes. They're
[4:42] disinterested in the Holy Bible. and
[4:44] they won't let anyone tell them
[4:46] different. That's why they isolate
[4:48] themselves, sit at home, don't go to
[4:50] church physically, isolate themselves
[4:52] away from the body of Christ and real
[4:54] men of God who preach the word of God by
[4:57] the anointing of the Holy Ghost. Let's
[4:58] listen to the quote.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; We find today that there is such a
[5:02] falling away.
[5:04] It seems to be that people are not
[5:08] interested like they used to be.
[5:11] They are falling away from the the
[5:14] fundamental facts of the Bible.
[5:18] They are seem to be drifting. And I
[5:21] think all ministers who love the word of
[5:24] God and know that that's the only
[5:27] standard in which we can be assured that
[5:29] we're right is not upon a someory but up
[5:33] on the word of God. That's the only
[5:36] basis.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; Right? as I don't want to say this
[5:40] sacriiggious but in the south it was
[5:43] told that a colored brother once packed
[5:45] a Bible under his arm and could not read
[5:48] and uh his boss asked him said why do
[5:51] you pack it he said because I believe it
[5:54] and he said I believe it from kiver to
[5:57] kiver and kiver also for it's got a holy
[6:00] bible and he said I want to say another
[6:02] thing I would rather be standing on that
[6:05] Bible than be standing in heaven And the
[6:08] man said, "How would you think that?" He
[6:11] said, "Because heavens and earth will
[6:13] pass away, but my word won't pass away."
[6:17] I think he had something there. And both
[6:20] heavens and earth would pass away. So
[6:22] you're standing in heaven. It might pass
[6:23] away. In the earth, it will pass away.
[6:25] And but the word will never pass away.
[6:28] So that's a good place to stand. You're
[6:30] in Chicago one night. I heard brother
[6:31] Tommy Osurn, our gallant brother, say if
[6:34] it I believe this word. is that if it
[6:36] wasn't sacriiggious, I'd put it down and
[6:38] stand on it to show that I was standing
[6:40] there. Thought that was rather very
[6:41] cute. Today we find oh that people get
[6:45] away. They get away from the word. Get
[6:48] away from the interest. There seems to
[6:49] be not very much interest in it.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; Now let's look at three stories from
[6:54] brother Bram's life. Just three that I
[6:56] thought of briefly where he got
[6:58] revelation from the Bible and not from
[7:00] his tapes. Uh but first member in
[7:02] desperation September 1st 63 brother
[7:05] Brandham said the seven seals was his
[7:08] regular commission. He said it was
[7:10] directly the word of God. So we'll first
[7:13] see how did brother Random get the
[7:14] revelation of the seven seals. Did he
[7:16] get it from his tapes? The answer is of
[7:18] course no. He got it from the Holy
[7:20] Ghost, the pillar of fire that would
[7:22] visit him every day during that
[7:24] wonderful week of March of 1963.
[7:27] I'll use a quote from the fourth seal
[7:29] and the seventh seal. Brother Random
[7:31] said in the fourth seal that he would
[7:33] sit there and the vision would go to
[7:34] breaking forth. He'd pick up his pen and
[7:37] start writing and maybe stay there for
[7:39] hours till the vision gets finished. And
[7:42] then he'd go back and say, "Well, looks
[7:44] like I've seen that somewhere." Get my
[7:46] concordance. Go looking back. And then
[7:49] he says, "Here it is right there. There
[7:52] it is over here again." Then I just tie
[7:54] it right in. I know that's God. as long
[7:56] as it's comparing scripture with
[7:57] scripture. Notice he did not say I know
[8:00] it's God as long as it's agreeing with
[8:02] all of my tapes. Brother Ram said that's
[8:04] the way it has to do. Just putting a
[8:06] building together. The stones has to fit
[8:08] stone by stone. So taking scripture upon
[8:11] scripture is building a foundation.
[8:14] Building a building [clears throat] and
[8:15] a foundation based upon the word of God
[8:18] that the storms of life will not
[8:20] overthrow. That's why the storms of life
[8:22] will overthrow the faith of tape
[8:24] worshippers because they're not building
[8:26] their faith upon the word of God only.
[8:29] Let's listen to this quote from the
[8:30] fourth seal.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; Just go up there and take the Bible and
[8:34] sit [snorts] down and sit there until
[8:36] when it goes to breaking forth like
[8:38] that. I pick up my pen and start writing
[8:41] and just stay there maybe for hours till
[8:44] it gets uh it gets finished. Then I go
[8:46] back and I find out as I see where he
[8:49] said this. I thought, well, looks like
[8:51] I've seen that somewhere. I get my
[8:54] concordance, go look back. There's
[8:55] something like that. And here it is
[8:57] right here. And then here it is over
[8:58] here again. Here it is back here and
[9:00] down here and over here. Then I just tie
[9:02] it right in. I know that's God. As long
[9:03] as it's comparing scripture with
[9:06] scripture, that's what it has to do.
[9:07] It's like putting a building together.
[9:09] The stones has to fit stone by stone.
[9:12] Then from the seventh seal, brother Ram
[9:14] would say when he was waiting for the
[9:15] revelation of the seals, he'd walk up
[9:17] and down the floor, kneel down, go back
[9:18] and pick up the Bible, not his tapes,
[9:22] sit down and read. And then all of a
[9:23] sudden, when he got quiet, the vision
[9:25] would unfold. He'd grab a pen, quick,
[9:27] write it down. And then he'd say, "I
[9:30] take the rest of the day and trace this
[9:32] out and see if it tied all the way down
[9:34] through the scriptures, then prove all
[9:36] things." So he quotes 1 Thessalonians
[9:38] 5:21. Brother Bram proved all of his
[9:40] revelations from the Holy Ghost, from
[9:42] the pillar of fire, from God, from the
[9:44] Lord Jesus by the Bible, not his own
[9:47] tapes. Brother Bram said, "If it's
[9:49] contrary to the word, leave it alone,
[9:52] not contrary to the tapes." Let's listen
[9:54] to the quote.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Well, what is it, Lord?"
[9:57] I walk up and down the floor a while. I
[9:59] kneel down, pray, go back, pick up the
[10:01] Bible, sit down, read, walk back and
[10:03] forth. Then all of a sudden, when I got
[10:05] quiet, it just unfolded like that. Then
[10:08] I grab a pen right quick. Go to writing
[10:09] it down like that. Whatever I was seeing
[10:11] and doing, watch it like that. I got it
[10:13] wrote down. Then I take the rest of the
[10:15] day and go down and chase this out and
[10:17] see if it tied all the way down through
[10:19] the scriptures. Then it prove all
[10:21] things.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; I got this shirt. I think now there's
[10:25] many people had visions. There's many
[10:26] been revelations. If it's contrary to
[10:28] the word, leave it alone.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. Leave it alone. Second,
[10:32] brother Ram said this numerous times in
[10:33] numerous ways, but he said, "Whenever
[10:35] the angel of the Lord that was
[10:36] commissioned to him for his ministry
[10:38] would give him an instruction. It was
[10:40] always perfectly in line with the Holy
[10:44] Bible. It always agreed with the Holy
[10:45] Bible." The one time he said this that I
[10:47] liked was speak to this mountain,
[10:49] November 23rd 59. He said, "That's the
[10:51] reason I know it's the angel Lord
[10:53] because he bears record of his word of
[10:55] God's word, the Holy Bible, not brother
[10:57] Ram's tapes. And if the angel told me
[11:00] one thing that wasn't scriptural, I
[11:01] would not believe him. It has to be with
[11:03] the word first. God's word is eternal.
[11:06] Notice he didn't say it has to be with
[11:08] my tapes because my tapes are eternal.
[11:10] He never said that. And then he quotes
[11:13] Galatians 1:6-12. If an angel come and
[11:15] preach something else, Paul said that
[11:17] wasn't right. But if it's the word of
[11:18] God, the angel of God will verify that
[11:21] word every time to be the truth. If it's
[11:24] a true angel from the Lord, if an angel
[11:26] comes and speaks and says just exactly
[11:28] what the word says, not the tapes, then
[11:31] that's the angel from God. Beautiful
[11:33] quote. Let's listen to the quote.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; When he stands before me in that light
[11:37] that you see on the picture, and reveals
[11:39] it, it every time is perfect with the
[11:42] scripture through and through. That's
[11:44] the reason I know it's the angel of the
[11:46] Lord because he bears record of his
[11:49] word. And if that angel told me one
[11:52] thing that wasn't scriptural, I wouldn't
[11:54] not believe him. It has to be with the
[11:57] word first. God's word is eternal. Cuz
[12:01] an angel could come and preach something
[12:03] else. Paul said that wasn't right. But
[12:05] if it's the word of God, the angel of
[12:08] God will verify that word every time to
[12:11] be the truth. If it's a true angel from
[12:13] the Lord,
[12:15] if it's something off color, then don't
[12:18] you listen to it. But if an angel comes
[12:20] and speaks and says just exactly what
[12:22] the word says, then that angel's from
[12:25] God.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; Third, and finally, I want to play this
[12:27] quote from Seed of Discrepancy, January
[12:29] 1865. Brother Ram told this story many,
[12:32] many times of how he got the revelation
[12:35] of the anointed ones at the end time.
[12:37] Right after he visited Mishuaka, he used
[12:40] his discernment gift to discern the
[12:42] spirits of these two men who were
[12:44] speaking in tongues and then giving
[12:46] interpretations. One was a genuine
[12:48] Christian, but one was an adulterer. And
[12:50] then brother Ram went into his cave. And
[12:52] how did God show him the revelation of
[12:55] the anointed ones of the end time? By
[12:56] listening to his tapes. No. God sent the
[12:59] natural wind three times to blow his
[13:01] Bible to the same text, Hebrews chapter
[13:04] 6. God wanted brother Ram to read
[13:07] Hebrews 6 so he would understand the
[13:08] anointed ones at the end time. And
[13:10] remember, Jesus Christ is the same
[13:12] yesterday, today, and forever. If Jesus
[13:15] was ever going to reveal something to
[13:16] somebody, it would line up with the Holy
[13:18] Bible. That is our absolute. It's God's
[13:21] absolute. It's the eternal absolute.
[13:24] Let's listen to the quote.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; So, I I got to talk to one of them and I
[13:28] asked him a few questions and he was a
[13:31] real genuine Christian. There was no
[13:33] doubt about that. That man was a real
[13:34] believer. And the next man, when I
[13:37] talked to him, if I ever met a
[13:39] hypocrite, that was one of them. That
[13:41] man was actually he his wife was a
[13:43] blond-headed woman and he had children
[13:45] by two children by a blackheaded woman.
[13:48] And I thought, well, now what? Here it
[13:50] is. I'm I'm all mixed up. I'm a
[13:52] fundamentalist. It must be the word or
[13:54] it isn't right. And here's that spirit.
[13:56] One rang out according to all I know
[13:59] genuine and the other was no good at
[14:01] all. And spirit fallen on both of them.
[14:03] Now, how can that be? I had me puzzled.
[14:06] Two years later, I've been praying in a
[14:08] cave where I'd go to pray. got dusty in
[14:11] the cave and one afternoon I walked out
[14:13] laid my Bible on a log and the wind
[14:16] blowed open to Hebrews the 6th chapter
[14:18] which said uh that in the last days how
[14:21] it would be if we fell away from the
[14:23] truth and renewed ourselves again unto
[14:25] repentance there was no more sacrifice
[14:27] for sin and how the thorns and thistles
[14:29] which is n to rejection whose end is to
[14:31] be burned but the rain cometh upon the
[14:35] earth often to water it to dress it but
[14:38] the thorns and thistles would be
[14:39] rejected Ed, but the wheat would be
[14:41] gathered. And I I thought, well, it just
[14:43] the wind had to blow that open. Well, I
[14:45] just laid the Bible down again, and I
[14:47] thought, well, now I'll just And here
[14:49] come the wind and blow it open. That
[14:50] happened three times. And I thought,
[14:52] well, now that's strange. And then I was
[14:54] raised up. I thought, Lord, why would
[14:56] you open that Bible for me to read that?
[14:58] I when I get down to that word thorns
[15:00] and thistles, which is nine to
[15:01] rejection, whose end is to be burned. I
[15:04] thought, why would you open that to me
[15:05] there? and is looking out across. Now,
[15:08] these real visions come without pulling
[15:11] into any gear. That's this God. See,
[15:13] &gt;&gt; in closing, friends, hope this video was
[15:16] a blessing by the grace of God. Remember
[15:18] Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ is the same
[15:20] yesterday, today, and forever. Heaven or
[15:22] earth shall pass away, but the words of
[15:24] Jesus will never pass away. The Holy
[15:26] Bible is our absolute. We're so thankful
[15:28] for that and thankful that Brother Ram
[15:30] pointed us back to the one only
[15:32] absolute. There could be no other, the
[15:34] Holy Bible. We'll keep praying for tape
[15:37] worshippers that they repent of their
[15:39] heresy and their idolatry. And again,
[15:42] we're thankful we have both the Bible
[15:43] and the tapes. The tapes point us back
[15:45] to the Bible. The ministry of the
[15:47] seventh church age messenger, Brother
[15:49] William Brandham, was essential. It was
[15:51] prophesied by numerous prophets. It had
[15:54] to come. Praise God. It came. And the
[15:57] purpose of it was to turn our hearts
[15:59] back to the apostolic fathers to preach
[16:01] what Paul preached. Just like brother
[16:03] Brandham preached what Paul preached,
[16:05] not to add one word to the Bible, not to
[16:07] take one word away from the Bible. And
[16:10] for those who idolize the tapes, if
[16:12] you'd rather have the tapes, would you
[16:13] rather have the 1952 book called Early
[16:16] Spiritual Experiences that said the
[16:18] third person of the Trinity burned in
[16:20] Brother Ram's heart, or would you rather
[16:21] have the Bible that never says God is
[16:24] three persons? That's just a simple
[16:26] humble question that ought to humble the
[16:28] tape worshippers and get them to repent
[16:30] on their knees weeping and crying
[16:32] because brother Brandham also said
[16:33] trinitarianism is of the devil. So of
[16:35] three persons is of the devil according
[16:37] to the Bible and according to brother
[16:38] Brandham. So this shows the folly of
[16:41] tape worshippers. They'd rather have the
[16:43] tapes than the Bible. Perhaps they might
[16:45] not say it out loud but that's how they
[16:47] act. And if they exalt the tapes being
[16:49] equal with the Bible, it's the same sin.
[16:52] They're still adding to the word of God.
[16:55] And God will add to them the plagues
[16:57] that he promised he would either in this
[16:59] life or the life to come. We do not add
[17:02] one word to the Bible. We do not take
[17:04] one word away from the Bible. Thank you,
[17:07] Jesus, that we have the Bible. Thank
[17:09] you, Jesus, that we have the absolute,
[17:12] the Holy Bible, the word of God. Brother
[17:14] Ram said we can hang our souls on every
[17:16] word of the Holy Bible. Friends, let's
[17:19] be interested in the Bible. Let's make
[17:21] sure our interest is on the holy word of
[17:23] God. And yes, then we'll still listen to
[17:24] tapes of Brother Brandham, but they'll
[17:26] point us to more Bible study and prayer.
[17:29] If an angel ever visited you or if you
[17:31] ever had a dream from God, it will point
[17:32] you back to the Bible, for the Bible is
[17:35] our absolute. Thank God for an absolute,
[17:38] the Holy Bible. If you have any
[17:40] questions, concerns, or testimonies
[17:42] about this video, please [music] contact
[17:43] me.
[17:45] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[17:47] the desire [music] of your heart. Very
[17:50] happy to be here this afternoon and
[17:52] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[17:54] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[17:57] good news that Jesus raised from the
[17:59] dead, living among man today, his
[18:01] church. The same Jesus that was
[18:04] yesterday will be today and forever
[18:08] is never failed.
