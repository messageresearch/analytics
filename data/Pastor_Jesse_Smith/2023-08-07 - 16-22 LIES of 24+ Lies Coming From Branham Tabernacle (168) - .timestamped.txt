[0:06] that's just
[0:08] made it read s
[0:13] and yes
[0:17] [Music]
[0:32] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:35] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:38] this video is to continue the series
[0:39] about the lies coming out of Branham
[0:43] Tabernacle located in Jeffersonville
[0:44] Indiana USA please see the previous
[0:48] videos for lies number 1 through 15.
[0:52] the 16th lie coming out of Branham
[0:54] Tabernacle is that brother Branham is
[0:57] their pastor
[1:00] the evidence of this lie is an audio
[1:02] clip from a preliminary from a Branham
[1:05] Tabernacle service in this quote you'll
[1:08] hear Brandon Tabernacles Pastor say that
[1:10] during the squeeze they will still have
[1:13] their Pastor even though they can't
[1:14] physically gather and of course they're
[1:16] referring to brother Branham let's
[1:18] listen to the LIE thank God for that so
[1:21] it's important to have our home tape
[1:24] churches when the rest of the churches
[1:26] who don't know what to do we do because
[1:30] that we've been in training and when it
[1:32] happens we won't lose our church
[1:35] or our pastor
[2:00] thank you
[2:10] [Applause]
[2:12] friends the reason this is a lie is
[2:14] because the Bible never teaches that
[2:16] dead men can Pastor living men
[2:19] if you do a simple Bible Search the word
[2:21] Pastor is used nine times the word
[2:23] Bishop is used six times
[2:26] and there is not one Bible verse that
[2:28] says a dead Pastor or dead Bishop can
[2:32] Pastor living believers
[2:35] and as I put on a recent video about the
[2:37] five parallels between the Roman
[2:39] Catholic church and Branham Tabernacle
[2:41] this seems to be some sort of
[2:43] spiritualism because Roman Catholics
[2:45] claim to contact the dead Saints through
[2:48] prayer and so Brenham Tabernacle seems
[2:50] to be acting like they can contact
[2:52] Brother Branham through their tape
[2:55] Services you can find examples of
[2:57] Branham Tabernacle tape services and
[3:00] they will invite brother Branham to come
[3:01] preach and yet brother Branham is dead
[3:10] for me to be able to welcome God's
[3:13] proper messenger come and brings the
[3:15] message of the hour
[3:17] for truly we say we believe that we was
[3:19] predestinated to be played for us
[3:21] tonight God knew that we were going to
[3:24] be listening
[3:25] so let us open up our hearts hear the
[3:28] message of the hour here's God's problem
[3:31] [Music]
[3:35] and remember the Bible verses for this
[3:37] Joshua 1 verses 1 and 2 Deuteronomy 31
[3:40] verse 14 numbers 27 15-21 all these Old
[3:46] Testament verses show that when God was
[3:48] going to take one of his servants in
[3:50] this case Moses off the scene God had a
[3:53] living man ready to take his place of
[3:55] course that was Joshua and Jesus Christ
[3:57] is the same yesterday today and forever
[3:59] even II Timothy 2 verse 2 Paul says
[4:03] teach Faithful Men the word of God so
[4:06] that they can teach others the word of
[4:08] God
[4:10] more evidence that Branham Tabernacles
[4:12] wrong is quotes from Brother Branham
[4:13] brother Branham said I won't always be
[4:15] your pastor so let's play those quotes
[4:18] back to back
[4:19] random Tabernacles lie and then brother
[4:21] Rams quote and when it happens we won't
[4:24] lose our church
[4:25] or our pastor
[4:28] what's been long and hot but people
[4:32] we won't always be standing here
[4:36] I won't always see your pastor
[4:40] a second quote is from 1957 Hebrews
[4:42] chapter 7 part 2 brother Brandon said
[4:46] quote I have nothing to do with what
[4:47] brother Neville does here end quote so
[4:50] in this quote brother random makes it
[4:52] seem like he is not the pastor of
[4:54] Branham Tabernacle
[4:55] I know there's other quotes that talk
[4:57] about brother Neville being an associate
[4:59] pastor but if Branham Tabernacle says
[5:02] every quote is thus saith the Lord
[5:04] there's no mistakes on the tapes then
[5:07] Branham Tabernacle is contradicting this
[5:09] quote because in this quote brother
[5:11] random makes it plain he is not the
[5:13] pastor of random Tabernacle brother
[5:15] Neville was the pastor of random
[5:16] Tabernacle so let's listen to the quote
[5:18] and when it happens we won't lose our
[5:21] church
[5:22] or our pastor
[5:24] but the full and complete authority of
[5:28] the church is the pastor
[5:30] read that in the Bible see if that's not
[5:32] Bible order that's exactly right there's
[5:35] no one above the Elder I have nothing to
[5:37] do with what brother Neville does here
[5:39] that's up to you and brother Neville
[5:40] your brother never wanted to preach
[5:42] Jehovah Witness doctoring that's up to
[5:44] him and you see if he wanted to preach
[5:47] anything he wanted to that's between you
[5:50] and him
[5:51] that's all if the congregation votes for
[5:53] him in there to preach that that's all
[5:55] right that's up to him the only thing
[5:57] that I do just as owning the property
[5:59] much more could be said about these
[6:01] topics but I want to move on the 17th
[6:04] lie is that worshipers at Brenham
[6:06] Tabernacle can have home Tafe churches
[6:08] and they do not have to gather
[6:10] physically at a church
[6:13] so the evidence of this lie is from
[6:15] Brenham tabernacle's blog posts on
[6:18] Sunday March 15 2020 random Tabernacles
[6:21] Pastor announced they're going to have
[6:23] our home tape services and not
[6:26] physically gathered due to coveted
[6:28] restrictions
[6:29] but even when those restrictions were
[6:32] lifted random Tabernacle has not
[6:35] gathered physically for over three years
[6:36] now due to construction so friends
[6:39] Branham Tabernacle has been breaking the
[6:41] word of God for nearly three years they
[6:43] haven't physically gathered together
[6:44] what's sad is that even denominational
[6:47] churches went against the covet
[6:49] guidelines and gathered more as they saw
[6:52] that day approaching
[6:53] so that's a shame and rebuke upon
[6:55] Branham Tabernacle not having the faith
[6:57] to obey the word of God rather than obey
[7:00] men
[7:01] and here's a screenshot of random
[7:03] tabernacle's website showing they're not
[7:06] Gathering due to construction
[7:08] so the reasons this is wrong this is a
[7:10] lie is because Hebrews 10 verses 24
[7:13] through 25 says gather more as we see
[7:16] that day approaching and they are not
[7:18] Gathering more than they've been
[7:19] Gathering less as we see the day
[7:21] approaching of Jesus's return
[7:23] so this is complete Disobedience to the
[7:26] word of God
[7:27] second brother Branham never stopped
[7:30] Gathering people together even during
[7:32] their construction there was a
[7:33] construction project in 1963 before the
[7:36] seals that brother Branham never stopped
[7:38] the people Gathering From worshiping so
[7:40] again we see Branham tabernacle's
[7:42] current leadership doing things that
[7:43] brother Branham did not do
[7:45] friends brother random even said go to
[7:47] church
[7:48] physically even if you only get one
[7:50] slice because the Bible commands you to
[7:53] fellowship with believers
[7:55] and questions and answers part 164
[7:57] brother Graham said and you go to church
[8:00] brother Brandon said if I went to a
[8:01] certain church that I know there's only
[8:03] one thing them people ever said that I
[8:05] believed they said they believed Jesus
[8:08] was the son of God I'd go hear them say
[8:11] that
[8:12] notice brother Ram says I'd go hear them
[8:14] say that
[8:15] and yet Branham Tabernacles people sit
[8:18] at home for over three years
[8:20] they're not doing what brother random
[8:22] did they're not doing what brother
[8:23] Branham said to do I know they put a
[8:26] pressure on you want your charm but you
[8:27] don't have to join but put them kids in
[8:30] Sunday school somewhere
[8:32] and you go to church don't sit at home
[8:34] go fishing hunting and things like that
[8:35] on Sunday
[8:37] you say well I'm not a legalism well you
[8:39] better be in that manner for a while
[8:41] dishonoring the resurrection of Christ
[8:42] you go to church somewhere if I if I
[8:46] went if I couldn't get if I went to a
[8:48] certain church that I know there's only
[8:49] one thing then people ever said that I
[8:50] believe they said they believed Jesus
[8:52] was the son of God they said it I doubt
[8:53] it
[8:54] but I go hear him say that
[8:57] maybe say that's this church May the
[8:58] next Church be something like the
[9:00] Baptist they say yeah I believe you have
[9:02] to have an experience I'll go with him
[9:03] that then I believe Jesus Christ the son
[9:05] of God I believe you have to have an
[9:06] experience then brother Ram said if
[9:08] there was an Assemblies of God church
[9:09] and he could eat about three or four
[9:11] slices with them he'd go with them all
[9:14] right then maybe there's a
[9:18] there's a now I can eat about three or
[9:19] four slices of bread with them see if
[9:22] you can't go if you can't come here to
[9:24] Tabernacle get some church somewhere go
[9:27] to it
[9:28] you don't have to take all they do what
[9:30] part of bread they're serving you serve
[9:31] the bread well they got the garlic while
[9:33] you just leave it alone see
[9:36] Ryan I can't make them you know that's
[9:38] attack sure you go to church wherever
[9:40] the church door opens you take off as
[9:41] hard as you can go if they don't believe
[9:43] well you don't have to partake don't
[9:44] join them don't join any of them
[9:46] churches but go to them fellowship with
[9:49] them how do you know it's not the Lord
[9:50] he said he'd make everything work
[9:51] together for the good and maybe it is
[9:53] soul in there or to be saved and you can
[9:55] Shine the Light to them
[9:57] see go on down there don't go irrigate
[10:00] go sweet the people can say that's such
[10:02] a Christian woman a Christian couple
[10:04] that's this Christian boy a girl
[10:06] I like that boy they really act like
[10:09] they got something see and say what is
[10:11] here it is then tell them
[10:12] would you just be salty they'll get
[10:15] thirsty
[10:16] and then brother Branham said in
[10:17] convinced then concern 1962 he said you
[10:20] cannot be as good of a Christian if you
[10:23] stay at home people say I can stay at
[10:25] home be just as good a Christian as I
[10:26] can at church you can
[10:28] the Bible said not forsake or assemble
[10:30] ourselves together and that much more as
[10:32] we see the time coming if you're a
[10:34] Christian you long to go where other
[10:35] Christians are in fellowship with other
[10:37] Christians so you cannot stay away from
[10:39] church and live the same life it can't
[10:41] do it because it's like I I I'm hungry
[10:45] but I'll never go to a table I just I'll
[10:47] never eat I just ain't go to do it see
[10:49] you've got to go and feed on the word of
[10:50] God and fellowship one with another we
[10:53] need one another more now than we ever
[10:55] did need each other is now
[10:57] when you get yourself singled out from
[10:59] the rest of them making yourself just a
[11:01] little different you don't want to
[11:02] associate with them because they believe
[11:04] this and don't want to show shape with
[11:05] that you're getting on Dangerous Ground
[11:07] right then it's keeping away from church
[11:09] find the one of your choice and remain
[11:11] there and be a Christian brother to all
[11:13] of them that's the way to be a real
[11:14] Christian and we got Fellowship
[11:16] protection people love you and pray for
[11:18] you brother Graham said if the holy
[11:20] spirit is in you you hunger for God he
[11:23] said you've got the wrong Spirit if it's
[11:25] trying to keep you away from the church
[11:27] he said the spirit of God will run you
[11:29] right straight to the church every time
[11:31] the door opens for Fellowship let's
[11:33] listen to the quote if it's hard
[11:36] for church and press yourself to come to
[11:38] come when the church is open there's
[11:40] something wrong with that spirit it's
[11:42] trying to keep you away from God the
[11:44] spirit of God will run you right
[11:45] straight to the church ever time the
[11:47] door opens for Fellowship yes sir
[11:50] more could be said but let's move on to
[11:52] the 18th lie
[11:54] the 18th fly is that life only comes
[11:56] through the tapes the evidence is from
[11:58] July 17 2022 the blog post says quote
[12:03] there's nothing that can satisfy us and
[12:05] give us life but the spoken word of God
[12:07] on tape it is the only way life can come
[12:10] through his spoken word the voice of God
[12:12] for our day end quote
[12:14] so the first reason this is wrong is
[12:16] because the Bible said Jesus Christ is
[12:18] the life and Jesus Christ is not a tape
[12:21] so many verses that could be used John
[12:23] 14 6 John 3 16 John 3 36 first John 5
[12:28] verse 13 Believing on Jesus Christ is
[12:31] life
[12:32] so life comes through believing in Jesus
[12:35] Christ the spiritual Act of believing
[12:37] Jesus's word
[12:39] now let's look at brother random quotes
[12:40] brother Brandon said you can listen to
[12:42] tapes and still not be quickened
[12:44] Tabernacle you listen to taste and yes
[12:48] the spirit is never Quicken you to
[12:49] either follow the word of God
[12:51] another quote from 1953 healing line
[12:54] brother random said only life can come
[12:56] through Christ who died in your stead
[12:58] end quote
[13:00] now your faith in God will what will
[13:02] make you well
[13:03] and both of you in dying condition
[13:05] [Music]
[13:07] only life can come through
[13:09] Christ who died in your stand
[13:13] questions and answers 1959 brother
[13:15] Braham said quote when the Holy Spirit
[13:17] has created in him a Living Hope of
[13:19] eternal life which only comes through
[13:20] the Holy Ghost end quote
[13:23] he isn't converted until his old life is
[13:28] dead
[13:30] and he is buried in Christ
[13:33] and is risen with him and the
[13:36] resurrection of newness of life
[13:39] when the Holy Spirit has created in him
[13:43] a Living Hope of
[13:46] eternal life which only comes through
[13:48] the Holy Ghost
[13:50] 1863 there's only one way provided by
[13:54] God for anything brother random says
[13:56] quote but the only eternal life comes
[13:59] through God's word that's that's the
[14:01] only seed that can produce eternal life
[14:03] end quote
[14:05] but the only eternal life comes through
[14:08] God's word that's that's the only seed
[14:11] that can produce
[14:13] eternal life
[14:14] Investments 1963 brother Ram said quote
[14:17] and life comes only through obedience to
[14:20] Christ he is the life end quote our
[14:23] heavenly father
[14:25] as many are on their feet
[14:29] they signify by this that they won't lie
[14:33] and life comes only through obedience to
[14:37] Christ
[14:38] he is lying he has a condition that we
[14:42] must need
[14:43] so friends there are no quotes that say
[14:45] life only comes from the tapes so again
[14:47] Branham Tabernacle is saying things the
[14:49] Bible doesn't say and things brother
[14:51] Branham never said and then brother
[14:53] Branham tells us life only comes through
[14:55] living members of the body of Jesus
[14:58] Christ and the examples he gives are
[15:00] from the book of Acts he uses Acts
[15:03] chapter 8 Philip preaching to the eunuch
[15:06] he said the germ of Life had to come
[15:08] through the body Philip and then Acts
[15:10] chapter 10 life had to come through
[15:12] Peter to cornelius's house and then
[15:14] ananias prayed for Paul the scales fell
[15:17] from his eyes life came through ananias
[15:20] to Saint Paul otheran said quote but the
[15:22] life come through the body of Christ end
[15:24] quote
[15:26] although an angel
[15:30] Philip tooing
[15:32] but the germ of Life had to come through
[15:36] the body Philip amen
[15:39] amen
[15:45] now listen the same thing took place in
[15:48] Acts 10 48.
[15:50] Peter was on the housetop an angel
[15:52] directed in the cornelius's house
[15:56] but where did the word come from the
[15:59] body
[15:59] [Applause]
[16:03] I feel pretty good
[16:07] Angel directed it
[16:10] but the life comes through the body of
[16:11] Christ
[16:13] Paul on his way to Damascus
[16:15] evasion directed him but ananas had to
[16:20] turn amen
[16:23] you have to worry
[16:26] so here brother random says the eternal
[16:28] life comes through living men and women
[16:31] that are born again of the Holy Ghost it
[16:33] does not only come through tapes as
[16:36] Branham Tabernacle is falsely claiming
[16:39] the 19th lie is that God's program is to
[16:42] play tapes and have the fivefold
[16:44] ministry stop Ministry
[16:46] this comes from a November 20th 2021
[16:50] blog post random Tabernacle says quote
[16:53] 56 years ago God began his program to
[16:56] gather his bride together so they could
[16:57] hear him speak through his mighty Angel
[16:59] all at the same time he even had his
[17:02] five-fold ministry stop ministering and
[17:04] gather their people together and place
[17:06] the hook up in their churches as he
[17:09] wanted his bride to hear his voice all
[17:10] at the same time his great plan had
[17:13] begun end quote
[17:15] so again we see the subtle lie of the
[17:18] enemy claiming brother Branham had this
[17:20] secret plan to have the fivefold
[17:22] ministry stop preaching and have
[17:24] everybody just listen to him on phone
[17:26] hookups now of course we know this is a
[17:28] lie because the Bible says Jesus Christ
[17:31] is the same yesterday today and forever
[17:33] and Jesus Christ gave the gospel to
[17:36] Saint Paul to preach it and teach it
[17:38] Romans 2 16 says we'll all be judged by
[17:41] the gospel Jesus revealed to Paul and
[17:44] God's program is the fivefold ministry
[17:46] very plain very simple to understand
[17:48] Ephesians 4 verses 8 through 16 the
[17:52] Bible says the fivefold ministry brings
[17:54] Unity to the church and will bring the
[17:57] church to Perfection which means the
[17:58] Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[18:01] the Bible never says the fivefold
[18:03] ministry stops preaching at the end time
[18:05] so Brandon Tabernacle is saying things
[18:08] the Bible doesn't say they're taking
[18:10] away from the Bible they're taking away
[18:12] the five preaching gifts and they're
[18:13] adding their false program to the Bible
[18:16] so they're guiltyable taking away and
[18:18] adding to the Bible
[18:20] remember the quotes from Brother Branham
[18:21] brother Brown said don't change a thing
[18:23] about your Evangelistic services and of
[18:25] course that relates to the faithful
[18:27] Ministry evangelist is one of the five
[18:30] gifts the ram said don't change a thing
[18:32] the Branham Tabernacle is saying change
[18:34] it
[18:35] good evangelists continue on the field
[18:40] in this hour of course what they mean
[18:42] certainly
[18:43] by all means don't change the thing
[18:46] if Jesus is coming in the morning Preach
[18:49] Today like if it will be 10 years from
[18:51] today but live life's going to be a
[18:52] desire
[18:54] don't don't get scrupled up now that's
[18:56] why I'm trying to warn you about see
[18:58] just don't be odd peculiar don't change
[19:02] nothing but if you're doing something
[19:03] wrong or doing evil repent
[19:06] okay come back to God continue on your
[19:08] Evangelistic service just as you always
[19:10] did
[19:11] also 1964 questions and answers they
[19:14] asked brother Branham are you the only
[19:15] one that should preach and brother
[19:17] Brandon said of course not I'm just one
[19:19] Pebble on the beach he says we need
[19:21] preachers
[19:30] we have seen
[19:32] your we have seen you ordained man we do
[19:38] don't believe you would do that if there
[19:42] were not that they were not to preach
[19:45] Mercy brother sister ever who told you
[19:49] nobody's priest with me a hot sure if
[19:50] you have four subjects of gods with all
[19:52] that no every manner that feels a call
[19:56] of God upon his life get into the
[19:59] ministry start preaching we need them
[20:02] man of God or anointed all over the
[20:04] world to preach the gospel
[20:06] I'm just one little Pebble on the beach
[20:09] among many big stones
[20:12] see so
[20:13] any man that's called or God needs to
[20:15] preach the gospel in 1959 my new
[20:18] ministry brother Branham said preaching
[20:20] is his program and he says God has so
[20:23] arranged that his program cannot move
[20:25] without you and I so Branham Tabernacle
[20:27] says tape playing as God's program
[20:29] brother random said preaching is God's
[20:31] program
[20:41] live God has soaring that his program
[20:45] cannot move without you and I
[20:49] and as long as we're not doing what God
[20:52] needs us to do we're paralyzing his
[20:54] program
[20:56] but when the church moves while the
[20:58] anointing of the Holy Ghost then we are
[21:00] in God's will doing his program
[21:03] the Philadelphia Church age 1960 brother
[21:05] Brandon said it's his program the
[21:08] commission of the church is to preach
[21:09] the gospel
[21:11] God never did dollars to build churches
[21:13] never did tell us to make Schools
[21:16] they're all right hospitals and so forth
[21:18] God knows we need them at this program
[21:20] but the commission of the churches that
[21:22] preach the gospel and God hiding himself
[21:25] in Simplicity March 17 1963 brother
[21:29] Graham said God won't leave his program
[21:31] he ordained men to preach the gospel not
[21:34] Machinery Mechanical Devices or any
[21:37] Angelic being it was man
[21:39] God won't lead his program that's the
[21:42] reason we know that this day it's got to
[21:44] be civil amen now he always works in
[21:48] Simplicity yes but God in the beginning
[21:51] that could have made the son preach the
[21:54] gospel are the winds preach the gospel
[21:56] or an angel preach the gospel but he
[21:59] ordained man for that purpose and he
[22:02] never changes it he never already he
[22:05] never ordained denominations he never
[22:07] ordained groups of any ordained man the
[22:10] preach the gospel not Machinery
[22:13] Mechanical Devices or any Angelic being
[22:17] it was man so much more could be said
[22:19] but let's move on to the 20th lie which
[22:23] is Brenham Tabernacle falsely claims we
[22:25] are now in the wedding ceremony this is
[22:27] from a blog post from September 24 2022.
[22:32] Brenham Tabernacle says quote we are now
[22:34] in a wedding ceremony with the
[22:36] bridegroom and we'll soon be leaving for
[22:38] our wedding supper and our honeymoon end
[22:40] quote
[22:42] so this statement completely contradicts
[22:44] brother random statement in Oneness
[22:46] 1962. brother said quote now the church
[22:49] now is engaged to Christ for the wedding
[22:51] the wedding has never been performed yet
[22:54] it will be at the wedding supper of the
[22:56] Lamb end quote so Brenham Tabernacle is
[22:59] completely contradicting brother Branham
[23:01] random Tabernacle says we are now in a
[23:04] wedding ceremony and brother Brandon
[23:06] says the wedding has never been
[23:08] performed yet it will be at the wedding
[23:10] supper of the land
[23:11] the branch said the church is now
[23:13] engaged to Christ for the wedding but
[23:16] the wedding has never been performed yet
[23:17] let's listen to the quote
[23:20] down
[23:21] the church now is engaged to Christ
[23:26] for the wedding
[23:27] the wedding has never been performed yet
[23:30] it will be at the wedding supper of the
[23:33] land
[23:34] so we see that the church is now engaged
[23:38] like a man engaged to his wife
[23:42] or could be said but the 21st lie
[23:45] is the tapes are God speaking lip to ear
[23:48] to Branham Tabernacle
[23:50] so this lies from December 3rd 2022
[23:54] Brenham Tabernacle says quote come join
[23:57] us at the only place you can hear the
[23:59] Vindicated voice of God tell you lip to
[24:01] ear who he is who we are and where we're
[24:05] going press play end quote
[24:08] so the first proof this is wrong is that
[24:10] if we look to the Bible there are no
[24:12] scriptures in the Bible that say lip to
[24:14] ear
[24:15] also there are no Bible verses that say
[24:17] play tapes and at the end of the Gentile
[24:20] dispensation if you just play tapes
[24:22] it'll be God speaking lip to ear to you
[24:24] and you won't need the fivefold ministry
[24:27] also the Bible says God spoke to Moses
[24:31] mouth to mouth that's in numbers 12
[24:34] verse 8 with him will I speak mouth to
[24:36] mouth even apparently and not in dark
[24:38] speeches in the similitude of the Lord
[24:40] shall he behold so the Bible terminology
[24:43] for this is mouth to mouth and not lip
[24:46] to ear so the Bible proves the lip to
[24:49] ear claim is false coming out of Brandon
[24:51] Tabernacle
[24:53] and second brother Ram said God never
[24:56] spoke to any other man like that as he
[24:59] did Moses brother Graham said God talked
[25:01] lift your ear with one prophet and
[25:04] brother Graham said never was a man that
[25:06] God ever spoke to like he did Moses
[25:08] outside of Christ
[25:10] so Branham Tabernacle is saying we get
[25:12] to hear lip to ear from God but brother
[25:15] random says the opposite God never did
[25:17] speak lip to ear
[25:19] except to Moses and Jesus
[25:22] brother Brown said God only talked lip
[25:24] to ear with one Prophet referring to
[25:26] Moses brother Brown said God never spoke
[25:29] like he did to Moses to any other man
[25:32] let's listen to the quotes
[25:34] and God spoke to him God spoke to Moses
[25:38] face to face lip to ear now he never
[25:42] spoke to any other man like that as he
[25:44] did Moses I hope it goes way down
[25:48] Moses greatest Prophet ever lived
[25:52] outside of Jesus Christ never was a man
[25:56] that God ever spoke to like he did Moses
[25:59] outside of Christ he talked left to ear
[26:03] with one prophet and spoke to the other
[26:06] prophet he had no control at all and
[26:07] spoke to his lips
[26:09] a 20-second lie coming out of Branham
[26:12] Tabernacle is that when they listen to
[26:14] tapes they hear from God just like
[26:16] Abraham heard from Melchizedek in
[26:18] Genesis 18. this lie was found on the
[26:21] blog post from December 10 2022 the blog
[26:25] post says quote we will all be gathered
[26:28] together from around the world listening
[26:29] to that same great Melchizedek speak to
[26:31] us a person who had no father no mother
[26:34] no beginning of days or ending of life
[26:37] God and morphe speaking to us through
[26:39] human lips just how he did
[26:41] that day to Abraham end quote
[26:45] so Branham Tabernacle claims
[26:47] God was going to speak to them just as
[26:50] he did to Abraham
[26:52] of course this is a lie
[26:55] the Bible proof is from Hebrews 7 1-4
[26:57] Bible mentions Melchizedek without
[27:00] father without mother and then in verse
[27:02] 4 now consider how great this man was so
[27:05] Melchizedek was a man brother tells us
[27:08] it was God's spirit come down to the
[27:09] Earth and he borrowed flesh he took the
[27:12] dust of the earth and created a flesh
[27:14] body and Melchizedek was God in a flesh
[27:17] body and that body had no sin that body
[27:20] was never born and that body never died
[27:23] so from Bible proof alone Brenham
[27:26] tabernacle's line they did not have
[27:28] Melchizedek in a human body preaching to
[27:31] them through a tape at their service in
[27:34] December 2022 that's impossible God
[27:37] never said he was going to send the body
[27:39] of Melchizedek again in December of
[27:41] 2022. there's quotes from Brother
[27:43] Branham of course that contradict
[27:45] Branham tabernacle's current lies
[27:47] brother random said in reference to
[27:49] Melchizedek quote then later we never
[27:51] heard no more Melchizedek because he
[27:54] became Jesus Christ end quote
[27:56] so brother random said Melchizedek will
[27:58] never come again in a body like he did
[28:01] because he became Jesus Christ so
[28:03] Melchizedek in his flesh body was not at
[28:06] the Branham Tabernacle in December 2022
[28:10] and now I realize I don't even think
[28:12] they were gathered at Branham Tabernacle
[28:14] physically so the physical body
[28:16] Melchizedek did not physically appear to
[28:18] each and every person in their home tape
[28:20] church services in December 2022 because
[28:24] Melchizedek was never more heard of as
[28:27] brother random said let's listen to the
[28:29] quote
[28:30] now the difference between him and you
[28:33] as a son see he was at the beginning the
[28:40] word and in morphed body he came in and
[28:43] lived in that in the person of
[28:44] Melchizedek
[28:46] then later we never heard no more
[28:48] Melchizedek because he became Jesus
[28:51] Christ
[28:52] Melchizedek was a priest
[28:55] but he became Jesus Christ
[28:59] please recognize that Branham
[29:00] Tabernacles propagating 100 idolatry
[29:03] they say playing the tapes in their home
[29:06] is the same as Abraham hearing from
[29:08] Melchizedek so they have essentially
[29:10] exalted the tape being equal to
[29:13] Melchizedek
[29:14] which also means brother random is equal
[29:17] to Melchizedek brother Branham and his
[29:19] tapes are equal to God this is 100
[29:22] idolatry they are not hearing the same
[29:25] as Abraham heard from Melchizedek
[29:27] Melchizedek had a body that was never
[29:29] born and never sinned
[29:32] brother branham's body was born of a
[29:34] woman
[29:34] and he said he sinned every single day
[29:36] he said he made thousands of mistakes in
[29:38] a year and he said he was not worthy to
[29:41] live
[29:42] not fit to live and he said he wasn't
[29:44] saying that to be humble
[29:46] and also based upon previous quotes God
[29:49] will never leave the five-fold preaching
[29:51] program according to brother Branham and
[29:53] according to Saint Paul
[29:54] remember friends brother Ram said in the
[29:56] church age book the seventh Church age
[29:58] Messenger will not change one iota of
[30:00] what Christ gave to Paul
[30:02] and Bradham Tabernacle has repeatedly
[30:04] changed numerous doctrines and teachings
[30:07] that Jesus Christ revealed to Paul
[30:09] therefore they are false as the church
[30:11] age book says
[30:13] in closing
[30:15] friends I hope this video was a blessing
[30:17] the holy spirit always guides us into
[30:19] all truth I'm trying to shorten these
[30:21] videos a little bit because I feel
[30:22] burdened to move on to other projects to
[30:25] help the Saints by the grace of God so

[30:49] tape church people stop worshiping the
[30:51] tapes may they be delivered from the
