TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Well, that's the same way with preaching divine healing or anything else. &gt;&gt; As you go along, you begin to learn. If you don't learn, there's something wrong. See, you've got to learn. And you've got to learn how to accept God and what it really means. &gt;&gt; Greetings, [music] friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to show how God's prophet, brother William Marin Brham, [music] grew in his understanding of divine healing as he stated in his November 26, [music] 1965 sermon, "Works is faith expressed." Over the years, I've shared this [music] particular sermon with numerous brothers and just told them, "In my humble opinion, I believe this is brother [music] Brandham's masterpiece on divine healing." Brother Ram specifically said, quote, "Then [music] all this we learn by." End quote. &gt;&gt; Then all this we learn by. &gt;&gt; Then Brother Ram said, "Quote." Well, that's the same way with preaching divine healing or anything else. As you go along, you begin to learn. If you don't learn, there's something wrong. So, you've got to learn, and you've got to learn how to accept God and what it really means." End quote. Well, that's the same way with preaching divine healing or anything else. &gt;&gt; As you go along, you begin to learn. If you don't learn, there's something wrong. See, you've got to learn. And you've got to learn how to accept God and what it really means. &gt;&gt; So, friends, learning is not a bad word. As some preachers might say, learning is the result of revelation. The word revelation means unveiling. So once something is unveiled, we learn what is underneath the veil, we might say. So that's all learning is. It's understanding what was unveiled. Jesus used the word learn in Matthew 11:28 through30. Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I'm meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. So the Lord Jesus Christ invites all who are weary to come to him to learn. So there can be nothing wrong with learning as long as it's learning spiritually with a sincere pure heart. Brother actually quoted this verse in 1953. His wife was asking about all the people that were in line. He said up to four city blocks away. He said they were standing. My wife said, "You don't mean all those people come to hear you preach." Brother Ram said, quote, I said, "No, they come to learn of Jesus." End quote. &gt;&gt; There was about four city blocks up. The people were ready for a revival. They were standing. My wife said, "You don't mean all those people come to hear you preach." I said, "No, they come to learn of Jesus." Brother Random recognized as he preached the word of God, it was revealed to the people and therefore they learned or understood what brother Brandham was preaching. There's also a verse brother Ram used in the church age book to show the evidence of the Holy Ghost was being able to be taught of God. It's John 6:45. It is written in the prophets, and they shall all be taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me. So the only way to come to Jesus was to hear learn of the father then you could come to Jesus. So learning was essential to come to Jesus. Brother Ram uses this in the Smyrnan church age chapter 4. He said, quote, "To further bring out what we have just said and to also use a scripture that should be born in mind as we talk about who it is that is baptized with the Holy Ghost, see what Jesus says in John 6:45. It is written in the prophets, and they shall all be taught of God." When someone is taught something, they learn what was taught. Belram goes on to quote Isaiah 54:13, "And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord." So Jesus was referencing Isaiah 54:13 in John 6:45. Brother Bram goes on to say, "The all of God are the children of God. Thus it is that the evidence of being a true child of God, he whom the spirit has come upon and indwells is again set forth as one taught the word by the Holy Ghost." So the evidence of a bornag again holy ghostfilled believer is that he or she can be taught the word of God according to John 6:45 the words of the Lord Jesus Christ. And he was quoting Isaiah 54:13. There's numerous other New Testament verses that speak of learning. I'll just hit a few here. Romans 15:4. And whatsoever things were written a four time were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. So there's at least three effects of learning the Old Testament scripture. We get patience, comfort, and hope. Perhaps that's why many believers, even message believers, don't have those patience, comfort, or hope because they don't believe in learning. Even the Lord Jesus had to learn obedience through the things he suffered. If Jesus had to learn, friends, how much more do we have to learn? He was sinless, were sinful, were sinners saved by grace. He was the divine sinless son of God, the lamb of God. Hebrews 5:8. Though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. So here's the outline for the video. By God's grace, first we'll look at First, we'll look at four important points. Second, we'll look at brother Ram's testimony about learning from works is faith expressed. Third, we'll look at the 20 paragraphs in works is faith expressed where brother Ram emphasizes the need for revelation for divine healing. Fourth, we'll look at the correct approach to divine healing. Fifth, we'll look at five issues with divine healing you have to keep in mind. And then sixth, and finally, we'll look at various helpful quotes from brother Brandham. I think you really like these quotes. They've been golden nuggets to me over the years by God's grace. So let's begin with important points. The first important point is divine healing is a minor and we should grow or learn as brother Ram said about both major and minor teachings. I made a video about this last year. Jesus called them weightier matters of the law. So there are major matters of the word and less major or minor matters of the word of God. And brother Ram repeatedly said never major on a minor. So, it's clear some churches, even method churches, have majored on divine healing and miracles, but it's not a major, it's a minor. Second, we also know divine healing is the bait on the hook, so to speak, because it's promised in Mark 16, and it's an important element of the gospel because Jesus said, "These signs shall follow them that believe." Paul said he did not come preaching in word only, but in power in 1 Thessalonians 1:5. It's also recorded that Jesus did so many supernatural works that the world could not contain the books that could be written about all that Jesus accomplished in John 21:25. So we want to keep a balance as Paul told the Corinthians, follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy. That's 1 Corinthians 14:1. And also I love this one. 1 Corinthians 12:31, but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way. So that's the balance. We have to have supernatural but we can't major on it. So while we major on salvation, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the major weightier matters of scripture, we must also desire the minor things or covet holy covetousness. Covet earnestly the best gifts and the best gifts are prophecy and most likely wisdom because wisdom manages all the gifts and prophesying edifies the most people. The third point is sadly I've heard many message preachers in the open book group and sometimes I refer to them as the go group because they publicly call themselves the greatest or among the greatest preachers of all time. These preachers lean towards the prosperity gospel with a promise that God always wants to heal. And the saddest part, I think, is that I've never heard any of these openbook preachers say that the sick need to find the will of God first. I've never heard one of them say that. And this is so wrong because the preachers simply say, "God is going to heal." And then on at least two occasions, I've seen preachers declare that someone was going to be healed and then they die. But then they still say, "God healed the person by giving them a theophony or a celestial body." But that was not the expected outcome that all the listening believers were expecting, nor the outcome that was implied. It wasn't the outcome that they were cheering for, shouting for. Nobody thought the two sick people would be dead and go to heaven. They believe the two sick people would be healed and continue living on the earth. And fourth, and finally, it is not always God's will to heal. as brother Ram taught in numerous occasions. In one particular case was the death of Sister Stad's baby from Germany in which brother Random got a clear-cut decision from God that it was the hand of the Lord to not resurrect the baby from the dead. The Bible clearly teaches this as well. It's not always God's will to heal. Paul had the thorn in his flesh, a satanic buffeting messenger, and he was not healed, although he saw it three times according to 2 Corinthians 12:es 1-9. Timothy is not recorded as being healed. He had stomach ailments that continued, and he was to manage them through drinking a little wine for his stomach's sake. In 1 Timothy 5:23, Trophamus had an illness in Malum. He was not healed according to 2 Timothy 4:20. The Old Testament prophet Elisha was not healed of his final illness according to 2 Kings 13:14. And remember friends, he did twice as many miracles as Elijah. But Elijah was raptured, he was not, although he did twice as many miracles and had a double anointing. And then the Old Testament patriarch Jacob had a dislocated hip and he limped for life. As far as we know, he was never healed of that limp. according to Genesis 32 24-31. Let's move on to the second part here. Let's look at brother Random's height of his learning regarding divine healing. And this pinnacle of his learning was that we must first receive a revelation for healing. So we'll look at numerous paragraphs here from works as faith expressed. This subject starts around paragraph 92 and goes to paragraph 105. In paragraph 92, Brother Ram's talking about people misunderstanding divine healing. He said people gets emotion. They try to work on emotion, but that won't work. Brother Ram talks about he and brother Gerholtzer, we're old men. We've been in divine healing a long time. We've seen the pros and cons and everything and praying for the sick around the world and seeing the disappointments of people, seeing the hallelujah from every side. Then all this we learn by. So, Brother Ram says, "We learn by those that get healed and we learn by those who don't get healed." And he said, "When they first started preaching divine healing, it was like learning to swim." Brother Ram said when he was young in divine healing, he would walk out on the street night after night to try to get himself around to himself. He said it's like a little kid splashing the water, seeing visions, you know. He said when he first prayed for the sick, he hadn't slept for several days and didn't know he was talking to a man. And then he started crying saying he's going home. And the brother said, 'You can't go home. There's a meeting going on down there. Then brother Ram replied and said, 'Well, I'll be ready in a few minutes to go home. He said he was just beyond beside himself almost. He was a boy then in preaching divine healing. Then brother Ram said, "It's like learning to swim. When you first swim it, you splash the water and go across the pool. But after you learn to swim, more graceful is the stroke. It don't wear you out so much." See, that's it. that you learn how to do it and cut every corner, make it better, and that's more of an ease. See, just like a little boy learning how to walk, he says he might fall down a dozen times and get worn out before he gets there, but an athlete could walk right down the aisle, never even notice doing it. And he said, "That's the same way with preaching divine healing or anything else. As you go along, you begin to learn. If you don't learn, there's something wrong. See, you've got to learn. And you've got to learn how to accept God and what it really means. So notice, friends, something's wrong if people are not learning about the gospel, the majors and the minors. If preachers just preach the same thing year after year and they're not learning, something's wrong. We've got to learn. We got to grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. In paragraph 100, Brother Ram says, "Sometimes we say, well, this guy didn't have enough faith. This guy didn't do this and this. There's a reason there for that. There's a reason. Sometimes it's unconfessed sin. So it's true. Sometimes people don't get healed because of unconfessed sin. Sometimes they don't have enough faith. But the Ram said, "You could pour a gallon of oil on a person and scream till you got horse. It'll never move that devil." No, sir. You've got to confess that. That's what the discernment does. Say, "Go make that right. Bring that out." Paragraph 101. But it's so slow doing that. Then the rest of them get impatient and they say, "Ah, I never got prayed for." So there's another reason people don't get healed. Impatience. Then brother Ram says, "But we want to find a way." Now what takes place, the real basis of divine healing, and remember friends, it's going to be the revealed will of God. The basis for divine healing is finding first the will of God. Then brother Ram says, you can't base your eternal destination on gifts. You can't major on a minor. Satan can impersonate any gift God's got. He talks about how demons shout, demons speak in tongues. He said, "And people sometime who don't know the difference declare this to be real when it isn't real." He says the same thing with divine healing in paragraph 104. They think, well, it's a hocus pocus or something like that. It isn't. It's a genuine unadulterated faith in what God said to be the truth. And that anchors and when it anchors, there's nothing going to move it. It's going to stay there. And then he gets to the second time he uses the word revelation in this sermon. Now faith is a revelation from God. That's where I want to stay there just a moment. It's a revelation. He has revealed it to you by his grace. Now notice these words. This is so powerful. It's nothing you did. So some people think I have to do something to get healed. Brother Ram said it's nothing you did. You didn't work yourself up into faith. You ever have faith, it's g to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you. Therefore, faith is a revelation. And the whole church of God is built upon the revelation. So, this is brother Ram's summary of what he learned about divine healing. Divine healing, he says, is by grace. It's not something you did. You didn't work yourself up into it. You have faith because God gave it to you by grace. And that faith is a revelation. Before leaving this section, I found there's 68 quotes where brother Ram talks about a positive mental attitude toward any divine promise of God will bring it to pass. So, it seems to me that this is what brother Random thought previously to November 1965, it seemed like early in brother Ram's ministry, he simply taught just take a positive attitude, a positive mental attitude toward any promise of God, and God will bring it to pass. But friends, after the seven seals were preached, there's only one quote where brother Ram talks about the positive mental attitude. The last quote was in June 6th, 1963, show us the father. Quote, if you can take the right mental attitude toward any divine promise of God, he will bring it to pass. End quote. Now, friends, I'm open to correction, but that's what I found. And this ties in perfectly again with the Sister Stad example from Germany. Brother Random said, "Sister Stadcliffe had great faith, but yet it was God's will, God's clear-cut decision to take the baby home." God told Brother Ram, "Don't rebuke that because it was the hand of the Lord. Don't rebuke the fact that God let the baby die and took the baby home because it was the hand of the Lord." So, Sister Stadf could have tried to have a right positive mental attitude toward the promise of God that he raises the dead, but it would not have mattered because it it was the will of God to take the baby home. &gt;&gt; There was something moving in the room. I jumped up and I said, "Lord, what would you have your servant know?" said, "Do not rebuke that. That's the hand of the Lord." So, I got her on the phone. I said, "No, God has called your baby." And so when she come over to see us and I left her at the house when I left yesterday, she said, "What was it, brother Benam? My my weakness of faith." I said, "You have great faith. You prayed for your baby. You and your husband held on to God to raise that baby and he refused to do it because he knows what's best." And still you love him. That's real faith. &gt;&gt; Anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith, but let it go backwards one time and see how it works. That's when you prove whether you got faith or not. Every son that cometh to God must be chasened in trial of God. So remember our tri trials works patience and patience works hope and so forth. This Lutheran minister said, "Why don't you wait till you get a clear cut decision from God like brother Brandon did and then you know what you're talking about." Now that is it, brother. If we'll just not jump at conclusions and wait and get a clean clear cut decision from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this shows the growth in brother Ram's ministry in the beginning and throughout his ministry. He thought just any positive mental attitude would bring any promise of God to pass. But he found out later first you must find the will of God for each situation. Let God reveal his will for every situation. And then God will bring his will to pass as we yield to his will. And friends, a lot of the prosperity message preachers that I've heard and of course other Pentecostal preachers, they often use this quote just have a positive mental attitude toward any promise of God and God will bring it to pass. But again, we don't see Brother Bram emphasizing this after the seven seals. Only one time after the seven seals did he make this quotation. Friends, we've come to the end of part one of this video series. It seems like this is going to be a longer video here by God's grace. So, I'll stop here with part one. Hope it's been a blessing by the grace of God. We thank God for the revelation on divine healing to first find the will of God for our situation. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus [music] Christ be the desire of your heart. very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. [music] The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed.
