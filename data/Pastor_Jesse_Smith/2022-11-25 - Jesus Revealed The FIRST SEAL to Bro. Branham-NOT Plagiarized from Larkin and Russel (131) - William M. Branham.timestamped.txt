[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:13] the purpose of this video is to prove
[0:15] hopefully by God's grace once and for
[0:18] all that brother Branham received the
[0:20] revelation of the first seal from the
[0:23] Lord Jesus Christ
[0:24] and did not plagiarize it from Clarence
[0:26] Larkin Charles Tays Russell nor Uriah
[0:30] Smith
[0:31] so by the grace of God we'll begin a
[0:34] series on the Seven Seals and the
[0:36] revelations that the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:38] revealed to his Prophet brother William
[0:40] Branham
[0:42] earlier this year I did a podcast it was
[0:44] our third podcast and showed how brother
[0:47] Bram did not plagiarize Charles Tays
[0:49] Russell and Clarence Larkin so you can
[0:52] listen to that podcast if you'd like
[0:55] but then I also wanted to go a step
[0:56] further and show how brother Ram did not
[0:58] plagiarize from Uriah Smith either
[1:00] by God's grace we'll show screenshots of
[1:03] each of The Minister's books and
[1:05] writings on the Seven Seals
[1:08] and hopefully this gives our viewers and
[1:10] our listeners undeniable proof without
[1:13] brother Branham did not plagiarize
[1:14] either of these three ministers
[1:17] this will also show how these so-called
[1:19] researchers today or accusers of brother
[1:22] Branham missed the truth that was laying
[1:24] right before their faces
[1:27] and in most cases the truth was just a
[1:29] few lines away from what they were
[1:31] reading many times on the same page or
[1:34] on the next page
[1:35] this proves brother Ram's accusers who
[1:38] say they are researchers were either
[1:41] incredibly shoddy or weak with their
[1:43] research
[1:45] or were honestly ignorant of what
[1:47] brother Ram taught on the Seven Seals or
[1:50] were dishonest on purpose in order to
[1:53] slander God's Prophet brother Branham
[1:55] while denying the truth that laid right
[1:59] before their faces
[2:01] before getting into the first seal let's
[2:03] begin with hyperbole or exaggeration on
[2:07] everything brother Branham read of other
[2:09] people
[2:10] friends brother Brandon's accusers use
[2:12] the following quote to make brother
[2:13] random out to be a liar because he said
[2:16] everything he read from other ministers
[2:18] was different than what came to him in
[2:21] the room as he studied for the Seven
[2:23] Seals but obviously this quote from
[2:25] Brother Branham was hyperbole or an
[2:28] exaggeration let's listen to brother
[2:30] Ram's quote
[2:31] now I want to make this real clear every
[2:35] time
[2:36] every time that these seals has come to
[2:39] the place everything that I ever
[2:42] believed on him and has read of other
[2:44] people has been contrary to what come to
[2:46] me in the room
[2:49] obviously this statement from Brother
[2:51] Branham was an exaggeration or Hyperbole
[2:54] and notice brother M did not say thus
[2:57] say the Lord in this statement
[2:59] he did not say thus saith the Lord
[3:00] everything I ever thought was different
[3:03] from these men
[3:04] if you actually keep listening to
[3:06] brother Ram's statement here he said his
[3:08] mind was weary from the week of study
[3:10] because it was a long week of strain of
[3:13] studying and preaching let's listen to
[3:16] these quotes
[3:17] then this morning I'll never forget this
[3:20] morning the grace of our savior to his
[3:22] tired weary servant when I answered a
[3:26] poor person's question and the best of
[3:28] my mind
[3:30] and all of a sudden as if I'd taken
[3:33] something away from a child
[3:36] so it's clear to me and every other
[3:39] honest person that brother random was
[3:40] just exaggerating in this statement from
[3:42] the seventh seal
[3:44] a simple comparison of brother Ram's
[3:46] quotes on each of the Seven Seals shows
[3:49] brother random use some or a little bit
[3:51] of the teachings from Larkin Russell and
[3:55] Uriah Smith as we'll show in this series
[3:58] but as we'll also show brother Ram's
[4:00] Revelations were different from all
[4:02] three men
[4:03] now one simple example of this is from
[4:05] the seventh seal as brother Ram's
[4:08] accuser showed regarding the seven seal
[4:10] Clarence Larkin said quote the seven
[4:12] seal extends down to the ushering Inn of
[4:15] the Millennium to illustrate a rocket
[4:17] fired into the air May burst into Seven
[4:19] Stars and one of these Stars into seven
[4:22] other stars and one of the second group
[4:25] of stars into a third Group of Seven
[4:27] Stars end quote
[4:29] now let's listen to what brother Branham
[4:31] said of course brother random used some
[4:32] of the same terminology saying the
[4:34] ushering Inn of the Millennium and
[4:37] firing a rocket into the air
[4:39] let's listen to the quote
[4:47] [Music]
[4:51] it's just like fire rock
[4:55] and that rocket explodes here and it
[4:57] goes up then explodes again it puts out
[5:00] five stars one of those Stars exploded
[5:03] pulls out five stars submit
[5:06] Stars explodes moves out five stars
[5:09] cement see
[5:14] and Friends remember in 1964 brother
[5:16] Branham admitted that he read Larkin and
[5:19] other ministers writings about the Seven
[5:21] Seals as this quote from the Feast of
[5:23] trumpets clearly states let's listen to
[5:25] the quote
[5:33] leaving as much as I possible with them
[5:36] on the things that they had drawn up
[5:39] their conclusion uh I read the book of
[5:42] Mr Smith your eyes Smith which is the
[5:46] Adventist a teacher and um I read his uh
[5:50] his thoughts on it and I read Mr Larkin
[5:53] I'd read all so many different ones of
[5:56] their commentaries on this but
[5:59] somehow or other I thought I had a
[6:03] little view of it myself that might be
[6:05] of a piece is different
[6:10] but in every seven seal sermon except
[6:12] for the fifth and sixth seals which
[6:14] brother Reina mostly agreed with Larkin
[6:16] on but not completely brother Branham
[6:19] taught each seal differently in regards
[6:22] to the timing of the seal and or the
[6:24] identity of the writer of the horse
[6:27] and or the identity of the four beasts
[6:30] and also the identity of the souls in
[6:33] prison
[6:34] so the statement that everything brother
[6:36] Branham ever thought about the seals was
[6:38] different was just hyperbole it was an
[6:41] exaggeration it was not a thus say the
[6:43] Lord statement
[6:44] and of course brother Branham admitted
[6:46] he usually exaggerated numbers
[6:48] and we know he exaggerated certain
[6:50] statements
[6:51] but he was a man he was fallible all men
[6:54] do that all men make exaggerations and
[6:57] hyperbole so let's remember that as we
[6:59] move on into the Seven Seals
[7:02] the first seal
[7:05] let's begin with the accusation
[7:08] there is a four minute and 36 second
[7:10] video from April of this year 2022 that
[7:15] accuses brother Branham of stealing the
[7:16] first seal from Clarence Larkin and
[7:18] Charles Tays Russell of course this is
[7:21] not true brother random did agree with
[7:24] some of Larkin and Russell's work but
[7:26] not all
[7:27] the false accusation of plagiarism on
[7:29] the first seal is as follows quote
[7:32] what is clear is that William Branham
[7:34] did not have a special revelation of the
[7:36] first seal he stole it from Clarence
[7:38] Larkin and Charles Tays Russell and
[7:40] passed it off as though it was something
[7:42] brand new that he got directly from God
[7:44] a revelation that had been hidden before
[7:48] the foundation of the world
[7:49] but this is clearly not true end quote
[7:54] another sad part about this untrue
[7:56] YouTube video accusation is that brother
[7:59] Ram's accuser used Jeremiah 23 verse 30
[8:02] to say God condemns brother Brandon
[8:05] because he stole his teachings from
[8:07] Larkin and Russell
[8:09] it's so sad that these accusers of
[8:10] brother Branham are condemning him for
[8:12] something he's not even guilty of
[8:15] and so brother Brandon's accusers are
[8:16] condemning him for something he's not
[8:18] guilty of what does that mean for them
[8:20] what kind of character do they have if
[8:22] they're falsely condemning someone
[8:24] of course that doesn't speak well to
[8:27] their character
[8:28] of course this accusation is false so
[8:31] let's begin by comparing brother Branham
[8:34] with Clarence Larkin
[8:37] so here's a screenshot of the accusers
[8:39] video where they try to say brother
[8:42] random plagiarize from Clarence Larkin
[8:45] as you can see on their screenshot they
[8:47] have three statements from Larkin this
[8:49] writer has a bow no arrows mentioned
[8:52] you can find this on page 53
[8:55] of Larkin's book dispensational truth
[9:00] the next statement is this white horse
[9:02] rider is the Antichrist
[9:04] and you can find that on page 54 of
[9:06] Larkin's book
[9:10] the third statement is this white horse
[9:12] rider will be Satan Superman and that is
[9:14] also on page 54 of Larkin's work
[9:19] as you can see all these quotes from
[9:22] Larkin are accurate and brother Branham
[9:24] did use some of these quotes from Larkin
[9:27] but the difference between Larkin and
[9:29] brother Branham is brother branham's
[9:31] timing was nearly 2 000 years prior to
[9:34] Larkin's timing
[9:37] so here's the proof here you can see the
[9:39] screenshot of page 54. you can see the
[9:41] two places where brother Graham's
[9:43] accusers quoted Larkin but in between I
[9:46] have highlighted the portion brother
[9:48] Ryan's accusers left out
[9:50] now how could they point out two things
[9:52] Larkin said but ignore everything in
[9:54] between
[9:56] it seems the reason they could ignore
[9:58] everything in between the two statements
[10:00] is because they're trying to slander
[10:01] God's genuine Prophet brother Branham so
[10:05] let's read what Larkin said about the
[10:06] white horse rider
[10:08] quote in other words this white horse
[10:09] rider is the Antichrist he is the prince
[10:12] who is to come of Daniel's vision of the
[10:15] 70 weeks and who will confirm the
[10:17] Covenant for one week the last or 70th
[10:20] week with Daniel's people the Jews end
[10:22] quote
[10:23] now notice Larkin said the white horse
[10:25] rider is to come it was future tense
[10:28] brother Branham said the white horse
[10:29] rider was past tense 2000 years ago
[10:33] let me keep reading Larkin's work quote
[10:36] Daniel 9 27 this Covenant will probably
[10:39] be the privilege to return to Palestine
[10:41] and rebuild the Temple and re-establish
[10:43] their sacrificial form of worship and
[10:46] National existence in exchange for the
[10:48] financial assistance of the Jewish
[10:49] Bankers of the world in his schemes of
[10:51] establishing worldwide Commerce and the
[10:54] formation of a gigantic Corporation with
[10:56] its commercial center in the rebuilt
[10:58] city of Babylon so that no one can buy
[11:01] or sell unless they have his Mark the
[11:03] mark of the beast Revelation 13 verses
[11:05] 16-17 for we are told in Daniel 8 verses
[11:09] 23-25 that through his policy also he
[11:13] shall cause craft
[11:14] manufactories to prosper in his hand end
[11:17] quote
[11:20] now let's listen to brother Ram's quotes
[11:21] about his timing of the first seal
[11:23] brother Ram said the white horse rider
[11:26] started writing during the first church
[11:28] age
[11:36] brother Ram said the white horse riders
[11:38] started writing during the first church
[11:40] age which was either 30 A.D 33 A.D or 53
[11:44] A.D depending on which coat you use from
[11:46] Brother Branham but either way 30 33 or
[11:50] 5380 is completely different to a time
[11:53] that's 2 000 years in the future
[11:55] let's listen to the quotes
[12:09] that was the birth of the church on the
[12:12] day of Pentacles
[12:15] then after the Ephesian Church age from
[12:18] 1853 I
[12:20] am A.D 170 then started in the Samaria
[12:24] Church
[12:27] now Jesus Messiah wrote Into the City of
[12:32] Jerusalem Triumph on the back of a white
[12:35] View
[12:36] on Palm Sunday April the 2nd 80 30.
[12:42] Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday
[12:45] 80 30.
[12:49] also brother Brandon said this white
[12:51] horse rider rode until the Roman
[12:53] Catholic church had power to kill with a
[12:55] sword which was around 385 A.D let's
[12:58] listen to brother Adam's quote from the
[12:59] second seal from 1963.
[13:02] power
[13:09] from the innocent wife to a bloody red
[13:14] watching now has come
[13:19] remember he's got a
[13:20] suit he's going for
[13:22] a sword in his hand riding red horse
[13:25] waiting to the blood of everybody who
[13:27] disagrees with him how do you understand
[13:29] it yeah how many understands what that
[13:31] seal is now all right
[13:38] but guys
[13:43] you can do
[13:48] some Stratos wow
[13:55] yeah it really arrives
[13:57] oh sure now he's giving great power and
[14:00] a great sword to kill
[14:03] now let's look at the identity of the
[14:05] writer
[14:06] Larkin said it was a literal person of
[14:08] the Antichrist
[14:10] on page 54 of Larkin's book he said the
[14:13] white horse rider is the literal person
[14:15] of the Antichrist to come in the
[14:17] tribulation he said quote in other words
[14:19] this white horse rider is the Antichrist
[14:22] he is the prince who is to come of
[14:24] Daniel's vision of the 70 weeks and who
[14:27] will confirm the Covenant for one week
[14:29] the last or 70th week
[14:31] with Daniel's people the Jews Daniel 9
[14:34] 27 end quote
[14:37] then in the next paragraph Larkin says
[14:39] the rise of the Antichrist will be
[14:41] some years before the Rapture because he
[14:44] has to reach a position of power to make
[14:45] a covenant with the Jews beforehand
[14:47] Larkin Roe quote the rise of this white
[14:49] horse rider necessarily antidates the
[14:52] beginning of the 70th week or the seven
[14:53] years of his Reign for he must have
[14:55] reached a position of power to make a
[14:57] covenant with the Jews at the beginning
[14:58] of the week but he does not become the
[15:01] Beast as described in Chapter 13 1-8
[15:03] until the middle of the week that is
[15:05] until after Satan is cast out of the
[15:07] heavenlies
[15:08] and incarnates himself in him his rise
[15:12] to power and the rebuilding of Babylon
[15:13] will take time so the Rapture of the
[15:15] church will doubtless and to date the
[15:17] beginning of the week by some years end
[15:19] quote
[15:20] two paragraphs later Larkin wrote quote
[15:23] this white horse rider will be Satan
[15:25] Superman the scriptures clearly teach
[15:26] that there is some day to arise a human
[15:30] being who will be the embodiment of all
[15:32] satanic power end quote and remember
[15:35] this is different from Brother Branham
[15:37] brother Branham said the white horse
[15:38] rider was the Antichrist Spirit or the
[15:41] nicolaidan spirit not a literal man at
[15:44] first
[15:45] brother Ram said different brother Ram
[15:47] said the identity of the writer was the
[15:49] nickel Aiden Spirit or the Antichrist
[15:51] spirit
[15:52] here in the second seal by the ram said
[15:54] he was the nicolete in spirit to begin
[15:56] with let's listen to the quote
[16:01] [Music]
[16:11] in a man and that he was crowned
[16:15] and receive the throne
[16:18] and was crowned
[16:22] and Friends noticed brother Ram said
[16:23] this white horse rider was the
[16:25] Antichrist spirit in all the false
[16:27] churches as first John 2 Verse 18 says
[16:30] and brother Branham actually cited this
[16:33] verse in the first seal
[16:35] let's listen to the quote from the first
[16:37] seal where brother ramsites first John 2
[16:39] verse 18.
[16:42] sit over here little children
[16:46] but she's already come and working in
[16:48] the children's
[16:50] what what to get the forearm in there
[16:54] the Nickelodeon Spirit to make an
[16:56] organization
[16:59] so as we conclude this section comparing
[17:02] Branham and Larkin we see brother
[17:04] Branham did not plagiarize Clarence
[17:06] Larkin
[17:07] both the identity of the writers were
[17:09] different and also the timing of the
[17:11] writers was different
[17:12] or the ram said the writer was the
[17:14] Antichrist Spirit or Nickelodeon spirit
[17:17] Larkin said the writer was the literal
[17:18] man of the future Antichrist
[17:21] brother Graham said the timing was
[17:23] either 30 33 or 53 A.D
[17:26] compared to Larkin who said it was still
[17:28] in the future it hadn't happened yet and
[17:30] we can see Larkin's timing for the first
[17:32] seal was almost a 2 000 year difference
[17:34] than brother branham's
[17:36] so brother Ram's accusers are false
[17:39] brother Brown did not steal the first
[17:41] seal from Clarence Larkin it is
[17:43] undeniable
[17:45] now let's compare William Branham with
[17:47] Charles Taze Russell
[17:50] here's a screenshot of brother Ram's
[17:53] accusers video where they claim brother
[17:55] Branham stole the first CEO from Charles
[17:57] Tay's Russell
[17:59] quote and behold a white horse and he
[18:01] that sat on him the bishop of Rome the
[18:04] embryo Pope the personal representative
[18:06] of Satan end quote
[18:08] that's from Charles Tay's Russell's book
[18:10] The finished mystery 1917 or 1918
[18:14] depending on which source you use
[18:17] now friends let's see where brother
[18:18] rand's accusers got this reference it's
[18:20] from page 106 of Russell's book now you
[18:25] can see the two red arrows pointing to
[18:27] the two quotes brother Ram's accusers
[18:29] used but notice in between they left out
[18:32] the truth about what Russell really
[18:35] taught
[18:37] again this doesn't speak well to the
[18:40] research abilities and character of
[18:41] brother Ram's accusers they're picking
[18:44] and choosing which statements to cite
[18:46] from Charles Tay's Russell rather than
[18:48] looking at the whole of Russell's
[18:49] teaching
[18:51] Billy Graham said the White Horse
[18:52] represents a power a charger
[18:55] brother Brandon makes the White Horse
[18:57] and the white horse rider one in the
[18:59] same it's the Antichrist it's the
[19:01] Antichrist spirit
[19:03] but very good uh uh exclamation of it
[19:06] what a great event and he said I hear
[19:08] some white horse
[19:10] a white horse is a power
[19:12] charger and said the man that stood on
[19:15] that was the the White Horse or the Holy
[19:18] Spirit
[19:19] he said you have the books his hand in
[19:21] there who was the white horse rider
[19:26] hey
[19:27] so it wasn't the Holy Spirit
[19:31] white horse rider went out they went
[19:35] his mighty
[19:37] it is Conquering power it's a great boat
[19:41] it is Conquering power
[19:44] if you want me to tell you who he is
[19:45] he's the Antichrist
[19:47] that's exactly what he is
[19:49] now because you see if a Antichrist
[19:54] Jesus said that the two would be so
[19:56] close together and so it would just see
[19:58] the very elected divide is targeted
[20:02] Antichrist it's the Antichrist spirit
[20:07] now let's take a look at page 106 of
[20:10] Russell's work notice what brother
[20:12] Brown's accusers left out they left out
[20:14] this statement quote Behold a white
[20:18] horse the doctrine's teachings of the
[20:20] Lord and the apostles recognized as The
[20:23] One and Only Rule of faith and practice
[20:25] of God's Church end quote
[20:28] so Russell said the White Horse was the
[20:30] true doctrines and teachings of the
[20:32] Apostles brother random did not say that
[20:34] brother Branham made the writer and the
[20:36] horse the one in the same Antichrist
[20:39] power
[20:40] so why didn't Brothers accusers read
[20:42] that part of Russell's research
[20:45] it seems like they knew it didn't agree
[20:46] with brother Adam's teachings and they
[20:48] were trying to purposely slander brother
[20:49] Branham
[20:51] now we can see how brother Branham and
[20:53] Russell did not agree on the identity of
[20:55] the white horse
[20:59] now let's look at the identity of the
[21:01] writers
[21:02] Russell said the writer was the bishop
[21:04] of Rome the embryo Pope
[21:10] but again brother Rand said the writer
[21:12] started out as the Antichrist spirit
[21:13] that Saint John warned was already in
[21:16] the world in first John 2 verse 18.
[21:19] so the difference is Russell said it was
[21:21] the bishop of Rome one person
[21:23] and brother random said it was the
[21:25] Antichrist Spirit deceiving many during
[21:27] the first church age
[21:28] so this is not plagiarism
[21:32] let's look at the timing of Charles
[21:34] Tay's Russell's first seal now according
[21:36] to Russell's own writing Russell's first
[21:39] two seals started in 325 A.D and lasted
[21:42] to 539 A.D
[21:45] and now here's one more visual of how
[21:48] brother Ram did not plagiarize Russell's
[21:50] timing on the first seal brother
[21:52] random's first seal lasted from either
[21:54] 30 33 5380 to 385 A.D
[21:59] so it was well before Russell's first
[22:01] seal took place
[22:03] Russell's first two seals were from 325
[22:05] to 539 A.D
[22:08] now what's interesting is that Russell
[22:10] places the timing of the first seal and
[22:12] second seal as nearly identical
[22:18] in the next two screenshots I will show
[22:20] how Russell said the first and second
[22:22] seals begin at the same time in 325 A.D
[22:26] here are the first screenshot shows how
[22:28] Russell said the first seal was beyond
[22:30] John's epic and of course John's epic
[22:33] was
[22:34] 73-325 A.D meaning the first seal began
[22:37] after 325 A.D quote and I saw John be
[22:42] held envisioned the first range and
[22:44] wonderful feature of the divine plan for
[22:46] the permission of evil as it related to
[22:48] epochs of the church age Beyond his own
[22:51] epic that of somernia end quote
[22:55] and notice here also Russell said the
[22:57] first seal began under the reign of
[22:59] Constantine which is again on page 106
[23:02] of his book The Finnish mystery Russell
[23:04] said quote was given unto him under the
[23:07] reign of Constantine who murdered his
[23:09] own son in the same year in which he
[23:11] convened the Council of nice
[23:14] the opposition of the Empire to
[23:16] Christianity gave way to favor and the
[23:18] Imperial pontifus Maximus became the
[23:20] patron of the profess but really
[23:22] apostate Church of Christ end quote
[23:26] here in the second screenshot this shows
[23:29] Russell saying the second seal began in
[23:31] 325 A.D as well
[23:34] here's a quote from page 107
[23:37] and Russell speaking of the second seal
[23:39] he says quote this period beginning with
[23:40] the year 325 A.D and extending to the
[23:43] year 539 was appeared in a formation of
[23:46] Creed's end quote
[23:48] so it's difficult to understand what
[23:49] Russell meant but he clearly said the
[23:51] first seal was beyond John's Epic
[23:55] and so the first and second seals have
[23:57] to begin at the same time according to
[23:59] Russell which was completely different
[24:01] from Brother Branham
[24:04] so here's a visual we can see John's
[24:07] epic which Russell said was Smyrna
[24:10] lasted from 73 to 325 A.D
[24:16] and here's pictures of Russell's book
[24:18] from page 27 where he says Saint John
[24:22] was the messenger to the Sumerian Church
[24:24] age which of course differed from
[24:26] Brother Branham
[24:27] and remember two things first brother
[24:29] Branham never made Saint John the Divine
[24:32] a messenger like Russell did
[24:35] and second brother Brandon made iranius
[24:37] the messenger to the Sumerian Church age
[24:39] not Saint John the Divine
[24:42] so there's two more proofs brother
[24:43] Braham did not plagiarize Charles Tays
[24:45] Russell
[24:47] Russell said quote to the second epic of
[24:50] the church was Saint John himself he was
[24:53] the one whom Jesus specially loved end
[24:55] quote
[24:57] and then a few paragraphs under a quote
[24:59] of the church in Smyrna as applied to
[25:02] the history of the church from A.D 73 to
[25:04] 325 is particularly appropriate end
[25:07] quote
[25:08] so you can see from Russell's own words
[25:10] the first seal was beyond John's own
[25:13] epic and there's a screenshot if you
[25:16] want to see that again
[25:19] I want to make an additional conclusion
[25:21] on the first seal brother Brandon's
[25:23] first seal showed the early church was
[25:25] anointed by the line anointing and
[25:27] brother Brandon said it was thus saith
[25:29] the Lord in the fifth seal 1963. let's
[25:31] listen to the quote
[25:37] remember all the days of your life see
[25:41] these feasts are correct it's thus saith
[25:45] alone
[25:48] brother Ram said the line anointing
[25:50] empowered the early Saints to save the
[25:52] world but Russell said the first seal
[25:54] was God apparently forsaking his church
[25:57] yet the Bible says God cannot forsake us
[26:00] in Hebrews chapter 13.
[26:03] Russell said God forsook his church when
[26:05] infinite Justice or the lying Beast was
[26:07] defeated by the ecclesiastical system
[26:10] let's read Russell's quote and show it
[26:12] on the screen
[26:13] quote thus we see the apparent defeat of
[26:15] an infinite Justice in this first epic
[26:18] apparently God forsook his church having
[26:21] jeopardized all its interests by placing
[26:23] the power in the hands of a self-seeking
[26:25] ecclesiastical system but worse things
[26:27] are coming end quote
[26:31] this is incredibly ridiculous of Russell
[26:34] to say that God would forsake his church
[26:36] and that the white horse rider the
[26:38] bishop of Rome could defeat God's line
[26:41] anointing and of course Russell was
[26:43] wrong
[26:44] but why didn't brother Ram's accusers
[26:45] share this about Russell's teaching
[26:48] if they're such great researchers such
[26:50] thorough researchers such honest
[26:52] researchers why didn't they share all
[26:54] these details from Russell's book
[26:56] because of course that would go against
[26:58] their narrative to slander God's Prophet
[27:00] brother Branham
[27:02] so the conclusion on Russell versus
[27:04] brother Branham regarding the first seal
[27:06] is that brother branham's first seal
[27:08] started
[27:09] nearly 300 years before Russell's first
[27:12] seal started
[27:14] and again in conclusion brother Brown
[27:15] said the writer was a spirit and then
[27:17] became a pope Russell said the writer
[27:19] was a man the bishop of Rome Russell
[27:22] never mentioned the Nickelodeon Spirit
[27:23] as the writer you can search his
[27:26] writings on page 106 107 and Beyond he
[27:29] never mentioned the nicolaitan spirit
[27:31] brother Graham said the White Horse was
[27:33] a deceiving Spirit while Russell said it
[27:36] was the exact opposite the doctrine of
[27:38] the Lord Jesus and the apostles
[27:41] so the conclusion is brother Brown did
[27:43] not steal the first seal from Charles
[27:44] Hayes Russell that would just humbly say
[27:47] shame on brother Brown's accusers for
[27:49] making such statements
[27:52] now let's compare brother Branham with
[27:54] Uriah Smith
[27:57] now we've already heard a lot about
[27:58] brother Brown's first seal so let's go
[27:59] right to Uriah Smith's writings
[28:02] this is from page 403 and Uriah Smith's
[28:06] book called Daniel and the Revelation
[28:09] 1897 page 403 quote the first symbol a
[28:13] white horse and the writer who Bears a
[28:15] bow and to whom a crown is given and who
[28:18] Goes Forth conquering and to conquer is
[28:20] a fit emblem of the triumphs of the
[28:23] Gospel in the first century of this
[28:25] dispensation the whiteness of the horse
[28:27] denotes the purity of faith in that age
[28:30] and the crown which was given to the
[28:32] writer and his going forth conquering
[28:34] and to make still further conquests the
[28:37] Zeal and success with which the truth
[28:39] was promulgated by its earliest
[28:42] ministers end quote
[28:45] so just for good measure friends I want
[28:47] you to see that the timing of your eyes
[28:50] Miss first seal was the same as brother
[28:51] branham's it was the Gospel in the first
[28:53] century
[28:54] but the identity of the writer is the
[28:57] exact opposite
[28:59] your eye Smith said the writer was the
[29:00] earliest Ministers of the gospel and
[29:03] we've already shown brother Ram said the
[29:04] writer and the horse was the Antichrist
[29:07] spirit
[29:08] so the conclusion on the timing and
[29:10] identity of the writer was brother and
[29:13] his first seal started the same as your
[29:15] eyes but brother Rams lasted much longer
[29:17] while the Rams first seal lasted to
[29:19] about 385 A.D Uriah Smith's first seal
[29:22] acid to the first century or about 100
[29:25] A.D
[29:27] also brother random said the writer was
[29:29] the Antichrist spirit and then became a
[29:31] man and then a pope Uriah Smith said the
[29:34] writer was opposite from Branham a group
[29:36] of literal men the Holy Ghost filled
[29:38] Apostles during the first century
[29:41] so our conclusion is brother Ram did not
[29:43] plagiarize the first seal from Uriah
[29:45] Smith
[29:47] in closing
[29:50] friends I believe this video proved
[29:51] beyond a shadow of a doubt that brother
[29:53] Branham received his Revelation on the
[29:55] first seal from the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:57] brother Ram did not steal the revelation
[30:00] of the first seal from Clarence Larkin
[30:03] Charles Hayes Russell Nori Rai Smith
[30:06] we want to first thank the Lord Jesus
[30:08] Christ for the truth that he gave to his
[30:10] servant his true Prophet brother William
[30:12] Branham but we also want to pray for
[30:14] brother man's accusers so they'll repent
[30:16] of their dishonest research whether
[30:19] they're ignorant of it or whether it was
[30:21] purposeful
[30:22] so let's pray for them
[30:24] father God in all humility I just pray
[30:26] for these accusers of brother Branham
[30:29] or something's happened to them perhaps
[30:31] they have a complex
[30:33] or some evil spirit or lying Spirit has
[30:35] come upon them I pray Lord God they
[30:37] could recognize their faults and repent
[30:41] of their lives and their false
[30:42] accusations and their slandering Lord
[30:45] Jesus let the spirit of Truth come upon
[30:47] them and may they repent of their sins
[30:50] may they be honest about the truth that
[30:52] you revealed to your humble servant
[30:54] brother Branham Lord Jesus we're asking
[30:56] you to do it let thy perfect will be
[30:58] done and we ask this in the name of the
[31:00] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[31:04] looking forward to the second seal next
[31:06] by the grace of God
[31:08] friends if you have any questions
[31:10] concerns or testimonies about this video
[31:12] please contact me
[31:15] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[31:18] the desire of your heart
