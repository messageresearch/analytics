TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your co-host Pastor Jesse Smith and I'm amen Lee we're thankful to be having another podcast by the grace of God and today we're bringing a new testimony from a Believer our sister Hua but before we get into the testimony I just want to say thank you for all the positive feedback I've received numerous comments on YouTube and numerous emails thanking our church for these wonderful testimonies from Sister Naomi to brother Austin and to brother amen and my own and so we feel like this has been a great encouragement to the people we're almost at a thousand downloads now um so we can see how God is using these podcasts to help people all around the world so we're grateful for that and also I want to let the listeners know at some point I would like to address some of the more recent accusations where uh the accusers of brother Branham are bringing out all these claims that brother random was racist or he was a polygamist or even worse claims of course we know those are wrong of course we know that's presumption but I just want to let the listeners know I'm aware of them I listen to almost all those podcasts so that I can be prepared to give answers later on and I have answered some of those emails some people have asked me directly through email about some of those accusations and I've tried to answer them and at some point I hope to address those by the grace of God but now we want to transition here into our testimony from our sister Hua and of course she's brother amen's wife and God has made amen and sister Hua just pillars in our church over these years and we're excited to learn about how God has called our sister and all the testimonies that God has done in her life okay we're about to ask the first question what was your childhood like when you heard about God so I grew up going to church All My Life um going to a Baptist church and then going to the CMA church right afterwards I mean at a very young age I didn't really know much about God because it was not really spoken at home and it was not really taught and it was just oh you go to church and you just learn it from the Sunday School teachers there and then when the preacher is preaching you don't really have a clue what he is saying because you're young and you're like a little child and all you want to do is just play so that was that was typically me and then you know throughout the years growing up being in the youth group you just start learning more about God there but then it wasn't like stable it wasn't stable stable where I was completely Anchored In wanting to know more about Jesus you know it's just more of going there to just hang out with your friends and just talk about random topics subjects that had nothing to do with Jesus yeah that sounds a lot like my childhood at least with my experience like I was raised in church my whole life but really it was more social for me I just wanted to go play with my friends or my brothers outside afterwards was there any time as a child that you felt like a great interest in God or was there any time you experienced any Supernatural with God practically wasn't only because it wasn't taught at home at an early age so it's more of you just go to church and you learn from there but then being at such a young age you know they they don't ingrain that into your like brain like you know you need to love God you need to seek or search for God and get to know God it was just it was just very dry yeah I appreciate you sharing that you know unfortunately that's the condition of a lot of churches here in America and probably around the world a lot of dry experiences where a lot of people that go to church that's the only time they think about God that's the only time they actually care to hear God's word and so it's a great lesson you can learn from a young age that wow God in the Bible have to be more than just talked about at church whatever you learn about God has to be brought home so the reality of the Christian's life is that they talk about Jesus at church they sing about Jesus at church but then they also allow his Spirit to come home with them and govern the rest of their lives yeah tell us more about the youth group what was the overall attitude towards God was it did they have some fear of the Lord or was it just a a dry experience to go and talk about about God I know in my life I had some fear of the Lord but once I left the church I was back into my rock and roll and my rap once I got out to the car so I'm just curious to know like in your youth group was it were there some sincere people that seemed to want to serve God or was it more just because you said there was really no stability or where the majority of them only there for social purposes some of the youth members I know they they would draw closer to to God but their lifestyle didn't represent that and their teachings I mean it was really really dry things that you you probably know but just can't relate to and um I mean their their life explains their belief in Jesus and there were some very sincere people there because they they would help or they would try their best to explain to us what Jesus meant to them or how Jesus can mean to us if we if we just seek him out I like to add I think Will's really trying to say is it's hard to explain something you have no experience in so they're describing something that they don't have and they're trying to teach something that they don't have and that's what we experience at these churches yeah I agree with both of you 100 you keep bringing up that word dry what's the opposite of dry wet what's that make us think of Living Water right Jesus says when you're born again he said the Holy Ghost will be like Living Waters flowing out of you so you have people talking about the water talking about the The Life of Christ but don't have any water to show for it okay and so that's what the ministry of brother Branham did and of course John Wesley and Martin Luther and the Saints the day of Pentecost they preached the reality of Jesus Christ and people had a real experience and they just didn't talk about the water but they experienced the Waters of Life flowing from their own bellies as Jesus said so in other words we can see how the church you were raised in and even mine lacked the baptism of the Holy Ghost and by God's grace we experienced that today by his Mercy well it's a huge difference coming out from a denominational Church to The Message Church you know I I experienced more of God and I pretty much know more about God and The Messengers than I do in a denominational Church it's like in a denominational Church our mind just isn't your mind's on Jesus yes but it's not up there like where you need to know about Jesus like really really get to know him compared to when you come into the message you're like okay I know this I know that it's like you just know your rights from wrongs yeah I can totally relate to that you know I was raised in church in a Pentecostal church and really I didn't know anything other than maybe John 3 16. that's probably all I knew and if you if anybody want to ask me any question about salvation or Roman Catholicism or the holy ghost or Miracles I would have had nothing to say because alls I knew was John 3 16 and of course that was partly my fault too because I wasn't seeking God but if I would have it still would have been limited by denomination we know God sent this message to bring his people out of denominations the mother Harlot Roman Catholic church and all the daughter harlots as well right and we hear at least on this podcast we're all a part of denominations we're all part of the the mother-daughter system so thank God he's called us out of those systems and now God's not limited we do not limit the Holy One of Israel but we allow him to move in our lives as he wants to foreign we're moving on to our second question when and why did you finally surrender to Jesus and repent or in other words uh when was the moment you received Christ as your savior and the Bible says then you're justified by faith so it was during my high school years when things just went out of hand and went whack that I started praying more and I usually didn't do that but every night it was just constant prayer every single night um and then it it led me out throughout the throughout my high school year I I started seeking more of God I I wanted to know the truth of God and so that's what I did throughout High School I it was like self-teaching myself the word and and just being in prayer and then right after high school after I graduated well let me let me say during my last during my junior my senior year I can't recall which but it was when I was introduced it to the message through my sisters and then I I knew that things were getting real and I knew that guy was real and so I I just listened to my sisters and their their experiences of being in the message and then right then after high school was when I wanted to get baptized just like them that's great and I'm starting to see the whole picture of your testimony sister that's really good because I remember all this as far as I remember meeting you so it looks like by God's grace God was drawing you before we met and before your sisters introduced you to the Bible revelations that God gave to brother Branham so it's awesome to see God was drawing you in advance through consistent prayer seeking God studying the Bible yourself God was drawing nigh unto you as you were drawing nigh into him and then at the moment you wanted to be saved God had your sisters witness to you about the water baptism and then I remember that beautiful day where you and your siblings come down to Portage Lakes and we baptize you and buried you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we got pictures to prove it was such a great time in the Lord you were so happy so full of joy praise God yes can you tell us kind of what your sisters talked to you about at first do you remember what they were saying and then what led to your baptism and ultimately being saved um I I don't really quite remember the words they uh used but I think I'll just paraphrase they came home almost every single Sunday well I was still attending the night the denominational churches they were already in the message and they would come almost every single Sunday and they would just teach and tell me things of the Bibles that I I never even knew sins that were wrong you know the revelations behind every every story of the Bible and you know it was just eye-opening and I'm like oh I never knew that was a sin I didn't know we were wearing earrings was a sin and so you know they would just come home every single day and telling me how great of an experience they had and you know I wanted to experience that myself so I I thought a lot about it prayed a lot about it and that's what led me to want to get baptized the same way as them that is awesome you know I was never there at your house during those meetings but I was there at the services I was preaching to your sisters and cam was preaching to your sister Simon was brother Randy was preaching to your sister so it's awesome to see that they were soaking that in absorbing and what a great lesson for our sisters and even Brothers even if Brothers even if you're not a preacher you can go home and testify about what the Lord said at church and everybody said that's beautiful I wouldn't do the same thing I want to go home and talk about what the word of God was about and what God did oh God heard Lena's prayer God heard God answered Naomi's prayer God heard brother William's prayer like I love that your sisters were hearing the testimonies hearing the revelations being taught the word of God and it's Purity going home to testify and that proved you had a seed of God on the inside of you because when the word of God started coming to you you just instantly received it it drove you to more prayer drove you to more Bible study so it's beautiful to see how God used our little Ministry a really humble tiny small little Ministry and then your sisters to share the word of God with you kind of like how Simon heard the revelation of the message and then came and testified to me about it for months until he had a chance to sit down with me and share the word of God with me so wonderful beautiful testimony is there anything specific like right after you were baptized and out of high school you want to get into next now this stage of life you're repented you're baptized anything like after that you want to share about I was in a a relationship that wasn't God's will if I can just put it that way and you know a guy really opened up my eyes and he's like and and I was you know you get that feeling like I shouldn't do this and I shouldn't do that and so I I knew I had to just stop I had to just stop doing what I used to do and just just turn turn myself away from such sins and uh that specific person didn't really quite understand what I was saying and I specifically told this person that you know I at this point I feel like God was really dealing with me harshly and he didn't want me to be in this kind of relationship like I had like it was such a huge burden on me like him telling me get out like get out get out of this relationship like you shouldn't even you shouldn't be in this kind of relationship you know and so I I had to make a cut decision and so I you know it was between listening to God or just being my old self and just going on with with life and so I I made a cut decision and I obeyed God and left the relationship and it was the best decision ever it really was that's a beautiful story you know you get saved and you get baptized you're forgiven and then instantly the Holy Spirit starts dealing with you like you said it was just undeniable God's voice telling you you've got to end this and this is not my will and what a great testimony that you were a child of God because you obeyed and you listened and you're willing to forsake everything in the past leave it all behind and walk in the newness of Life the Bible says and the Beautiful part about Christianity is the Bible said through the blood of Jesus Christ all of our sins are forgiven all the trespasses are forgiven all the sins are remitted thrown away and they're tossed in the sea of forgetfulness praise God and then the Bible says we're new creatures in Christ Jesus the Bible says old things are passed away behold all things are become new so God was doing something new on the inside God was making you a new creature and so the next step is for God to clean you out and you listen to the Holy Spirit what a great testimony praise God and I remember um the night when I went ice and ship and I ended it that I went to my sisters and you know I I had to confess and they were they they were really sweet to me and they they helped me through that time and I remember crying and praying that night repenting to God to ask him for to forgive me for such was such a thing and so and I was very thankful too because I was in college too and I didn't have class the following mornings I was able to sleep in for the time being but wait yes and I mean the following morning when I woke up after I repented you know I felt so much better like the chains were off you know like I felt like I was really set free from it and it it didn't bother me ever since you know it's awesome to hear about um your genuine repentance sister you know and how you woke up feeling totally free I mean that's exactly what the gospel is supposed to do the gospel is good news right and when we confess our sins the Bible says Jesus is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness so look at the just look at the beautiful power of confession like Lord I'm sorry it was my fault and then you wake up feeling like a brand new person and you don't have school the next day so God gave you some he showed you some favor there and gave you some rest so you could sleep in um but then also God provided you know your sisters there like the Bible says gave you good comforters you know God gave you some good comforters there are some people that would lead you into prayer and support you and be with you when you really needed somebody to pray with you and and someone to just be with you in a moment of repentance to me it's also beautiful too like God gave you numerous Witnesses of your repentance you know that's a great thing to have you know in mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established and so another reason it makes me happy is because I see your constant love for God you know you'll come up for prayer every couple weeks or every couple months and it's undeniable you have a heart for Jesus Christ you know you just keep coming up at different times for prayer requests it's almost like I can see through your actions you know a genuine sincerity a pure love for Jesus Christ pure love for God and so I can see and easily understand how you know that moment was a great moment you know your the chains are broken from an unhealthy relationship you've obeyed the word of God and God set you free I'd love to hear about that because I I we can see the fruits of that decision today how you're walking in the beauty of Holiness you're walking with God so dedicated to God serving God with all of your heart it's beautiful to hear about that and then to see the fruits of that decision so many years later and also this testimony is important for anyone who may be in a relationship now that you know is not the will of God you know what's beautiful is that brother Bram said your decision about marriage is the second greatest decision in your life and so you were in a relationship that you know God showed you was wrong you step right out of it and now God's given you the right relationship praise God and so what a great testimony this is to anyone who may be struggling with the will of God now or not sure about the will of God for relationship so we can learn that just draw night to God through like your prayers you're talking about your Bible reading you know searching the Bible yourself we have that confidence then that if we're seeking God and we're reading the word and we're praying God is going to give us the right relationship we can trust God he will guide us maybe out of a relationship and he'll give us the right relationship so what a great lesson your testimony is for others that they can learn that same thing if you seek God with all your heart you'll find him if you want to do the perfect will of God he'll give it to you foreign yeah so building off upon that testimony of how you came out of an unhealthy relationship it was still a desire of your heart to find the right man the man that God had for you for marriage and so can you tell us about that how God LED you to the right man that he wanted you to marry and how God Vindicated it to you and how you knew it was the perfect will of God so after leaving the unhealthy relationship I remember praying one night asking God for a good loving God-fearing husband I I wasn't specific about how the way this person will look how tall this person would be but as long as this person had a heart to do God's Will and to obey God in everything and word and indeed that that will be the one that God would want me to marry and so from 2007 all the way to 2014 I said this prayer in 2007 I completely forgot about it for a few years and throughout those few years I've I've courted people but the relationship just didn't go right that there was nothing that was gluing me to these people that I was courting like there was always something that was off like a red flag and it just didn't work out and in 2011 at the CMA Church uh I was introduced it to my spouse which is right now and I I didn't know he was going to be my spouse I all I remember was you were doing fresh and ready but throughout the years you know I I only see my spouse as a friend and and nothing more until we had a youth gathering at someone's house and this is when my spouse was newly introduced into the message and when he got baptized but he didn't know that I was baptized the exact same way and we were at the stairs talking while we were eating and you know I I was introducing him to serpency I didn't know much about serpency because I wasn't in the message to to really know about it and I had to learn it so I can teach others about it but I I just gave this simple and the basic information or what I knew about serpent seed and you know he he was like shocked like really he had to go home and do some research himself to make sure that was it but from the from that night when we we found out that we were both you know baptized correctly and we both were believing almost the exact same thing as what Drew us together and the connection was just there and so that was like seven years and then it was like 2014 was when God brought it back to my remembrance and and I remember the prayer that I said back in 2007 like what I asked for and a husband and I knew I received it then it's awesome to see how God gave you a husband as a direct answer to your prayer again showing how God is so personal and if you delight yourself in him he'll give you the desires of your heart what your testimony is a beautiful Vindication of that promise from God that if you are true worshiper worshiping God and spirit and truth and you ask something from the Lord the Lord is going to give it to you and that reminds me of you know earlier this year you know you had a a difficult uh life situation and then the Lord reminded you how you had to wait for the right husband a godly man a man that loved the Lord with all of his heart so maybe can you share a little bit about that how God had to remind you that even though you had to wait for the right husband God gave you the right one a more honorable husband than other brothers and then how God used that to encourage you to keep waiting for more Promises of God to be answered in your life so it was the beginning of this year uh I I was growing a bit impatient but I knew I had to to wait and see what God has in store for me and I remember it was after service that I went up for prayer for a debt situation for a house for children and uh my pastor prayed over me and I went back to uh my seat and while I was worshiping a voice spoke and said remember when you prayed for your husband and remember when you waited for seven years for your husband didn't I give you the desires of your heart that you asked for and I thought about it and I and I'm like yes like yes God you you did answer that prayer you know I'm thinking about it while I'm hearing the voice and he said don't you want to wait for um your your prayers to be answered just as you waited for your your husband that you pray for and he he brought a song to my remembrance um it's uh a promise of a lifetime I forgot the band who who sung that song okay but that song came to me in my mind and and uh it just gave me courage and it just made me feel a lot better to know that God has everything under control and that he will bring to pass what I ask for in prayer as long as it's in his will to do so and The Voice also spoke he mentioned you know didn't I give you the good loving God-fearing husband like didn't you ask for this husband and I gave you the best one that would be the one that God would want me to marry and you know it took me a while to think about it and I'm like yes because look where I'm standing now I'm I'm still I'm still believing this message I'm I'm still doing what God is asking me to do I'm still obeying the word and you know I just see the fruit of it and I just see God's hand and everything in every situation that sounds like a very scriptural voice because you know God would tell Abraham is anything too hard for the Lord you know and then David would recall if God help me with the to defeat the bear and the lion then surely he'll be with me in this situation so it seems like a very scriptural voice God reminding you if I gave you the desire of your heart related to the choice of your husband and I gave you the best husband for you who was more honorable than other brothers than surely I'll still answer your other prayer requests in my time and season it's just like God how God Is So merciful it matches God's character that he makes everything beautiful in his time God gave you the right marriage relationship in his time and we're going to trust God is going to answer all these other requests in his time because it sounds like a very scriptural voice that's the end of the first part of this testimony and I hope that you guys come and listen to the rest of this testimony and yet you would be blessed by it yeah we're certainly blessed by part one looking forward to part two and it's just special for me because sister I've seen I've seen you and your family come in the message one by one over the last 20 years and so I was there when you were baptized I had the blessing of being the one who baptized you and since then we've just I've just seen you grow in faith over all these years and getting these stories behind the scenes is really wonderful and this has been really encouraging for me because I get to know more about what was going on and how God was working behind the scenes in ways that I didn't see so we're looking forward to part two next time by God's grace and we appreciate you listening to this podcast and downloading it God bless you friends as the Holy Ghost anoints you to defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ as Paul also said in Philippians 1 verse 17 he said knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel [Music] [Music] foreign
