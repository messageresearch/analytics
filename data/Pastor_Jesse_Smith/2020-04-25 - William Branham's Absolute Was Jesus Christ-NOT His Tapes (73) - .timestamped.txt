[0:07] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:12] this video is to prove that William
[0:15] branham's absolute was the person of
[0:18] Jesus Christ and not his tapes yes you
[0:22] could say William branham's absolute was
[0:24] Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost the Word of
[0:28] God and the Bible but he never said his
[0:31] tapes were the absolute as the tape
[0:33] church movement in Jeffersonville
[0:36] erroneously teaches I first want to
[0:39] express my gratitude to God for brother
[0:42] branham's tapes because brother
[0:44] branham's tapes direct us to the
[0:46] absolute Jesus Christ as I listen to
[0:49] brother branham's tapes
[0:50] I'm directed to the absolute and through
[0:52] prayer I contact the absolute the Holy
[0:55] Spirit but William branham's tapes are
[0:58] not the absolute the tapes are not Jesus
[1:01] Christ we thank God for sending william
[1:04] branham to preach his sermons which were
[1:05] recorded on tape and I believe his tapes
[1:08] have more revelation on them than any
[1:10] other preacher but William Branham never
[1:13] said every word on the tapes was
[1:15] infallible or equal to Jesus Christ
[1:18] again I believe William Branham was a
[1:20] genuine prophet whose ministry fulfilled
[1:23] revelation 10 7 Malachi 4 5 & 6
[1:27] Luke 17 30 also Matthew 17 11 acts 3 21
[1:33] and revelation 3:14 this video is a
[1:36] third video in a series aimed at rightly
[1:40] dividing the word of truth regarding the
[1:42] seven false teachings coming out of the
[1:45] Jeffersonville Indiana Tape church
[1:48] movement you can do the other two videos
[1:51] on my youtube channel their titles are
[1:53] overview video 7 false teachings of the
[1:57] Jeffersonville tape church movement and
[1:59] the 2nd is not every word William
[2:02] Branham said was thus saith the Lord
[2:06] friends please know I have reached out
[2:08] to the Jeffersonville leadership in love
[2:11] I have sent emails letters in the mail
[2:14] and also made a private YouTube video
[2:16] for the leaders in Jeffersonville I've
[2:19] received two letters back but it seems
[2:22] the leaders do not want to receive
[2:23] correction for me as I was bringing it
[2:26] through God's Word so in Christian love
[2:28] we must pray for the leadership in
[2:30] Jeffersonville hopefully one day soon
[2:32] they will repent of their false
[2:34] teachings and simply teach the truth of
[2:37] God here's the outline for this video
[2:39] we'll start by defining the absolute and
[2:42] then see how God is the absolute and his
[2:46] Bible and His Word is the absolute we'll
[2:49] prove how brother branham's absolute was
[2:51] Jesus Christ only after that we'll look
[2:54] at the tape Church's false doctrines
[2:57] about the absolute then we'll see more
[3:00] quotes on how brother branham's absolute
[3:02] was Jesus Christ and at the end we'll
[3:05] look at one often misunderstood brother
[3:08] branham quote so let's begin with
[3:11] defining the absolute a modern
[3:14] definition is free from imperfection
[3:19] brother branham's definition from his
[3:21] Webster's dictionary was similar see
[3:26] power perfect in itself and it really is
[3:31] the word brother branham's own words
[3:37] disprove jeffersonville's beliefs that
[3:40] every word of brother branham is the
[3:42] absolute as you'll soon see based upon
[3:46] these definitions only God or Jesus
[3:49] Christ can be the absolute scripture
[3:52] says the Lord God omnipotent reigneth
[3:55] which means almighty ruler of all
[3:59] revelation 19:6
[4:01] and I heard as it were the voice of a
[4:03] great multitude and as the voice of many
[4:06] waters and as the voice of mighty
[4:08] thunderings saying hallelujah for the
[4:11] Lord God omnipotent reigneth brother
[4:15] branham plainly says he is not perfect
[4:17] so that disc ludes him and every single
[4:21] word of his as being the absolute
[4:25] [Music]
[4:35] [Music]
[4:43] remember an absolute is unlimited in
[4:46] power and Jesus had all power
[4:49] this proves Christ is the absolute
[4:51] Matthew 28:18 and Jesus came and spake
[4:55] unto them saying all power is given unto
[4:57] me in heaven and in earth on the other
[5:01] hand brother Branham admits he has no
[5:04] power just like all of us have now when
[5:08] Jesus Christ heals the sick I would say
[5:11] they'd be healed I can tell you that
[5:13] remember I have no power to heal I don't
[5:16] have power you don't have any power none
[5:19] of us does we have authority
[5:21] how many understands that
[5:25] next God's absolute is himself and his
[5:29] word there is only one absolute and that
[5:33] is God himself and his word Romans 3:4
[5:37] says God forbid yay
[5:39] let God be true but every man a liar one
[5:44] said well where do we the absolute does
[5:45] that we're the absolute gods absolutely
[6:02] makes it right
[6:05] Jesus says God's Word is the absolute
[6:09] saying heaven and earth shall pass away
[6:11] but my words shall never pass away in
[6:13] Matthew 24:35 this is the scripture
[6:17] brother Branham uses in reference to the
[6:19] absolute it's almost gotten to a place
[6:23] like it was the days of judges
[6:25] everybody has her own absolute but it
[6:27] all feels like the Pharaoh was and so
[6:30] forth but God's absolute is his word he
[6:33] gives it in heavens and earth to pass
[6:34] away they shall never pass away I like
[6:38] that
[6:40] friends if God himself and his word is
[6:44] the absolute how can the words of a man
[6:46] be the absolute they cannot as brother
[6:50] Branham quoted Romans 3:4 as proof that
[6:54] God is the absolute
[7:09] now let's listen to four statements by
[7:12] brother Branham that prove his absolute
[7:14] was only Jesus Christ and there can be
[7:17] no other absolute and there is only one
[7:20] absolute always the absolute is a person
[7:25] an eternal person and not a collection
[7:28] of audio mp3 files that's the only
[7:49] splitter for human life and Christ is
[7:52] the word notice William Branham never
[8:04] said his tapes were the absolute listen
[8:07] as brother Branham says there is only
[8:09] one absolute and there is no other
[8:12] absolute and it was in his tapes and
[8:15] cannot be as tapes because there are no
[8:18] other absolutes
[8:31] now if he is our absolute there can be
[8:35] no other absolute you can't hash-table
[8:38] not my church is my absolute my Preet is
[8:41] my absolute if Christ is your absolute
[8:43] you believe Christ word is no other way
[8:46] to do it
[8:48] yes sir he is my absolute not making
[8:51] your absolute pay in the time of my
[8:56] trouble he's always absolute
[9:01] brother branham's personal absolute was
[9:04] the word the Bible my absolute is the
[9:08] word the Bible and as a pastor here of
[9:13] the church my absolute is the word the
[9:18] truth is brother Branham preached about
[9:20] the absolute Jesus Christ who is the
[9:23] Word of God or the Holy Ghost next
[9:27] here's three false beliefs of the tape
[9:30] Church move regarding the absolute
[9:32] leadership at Branham tabernacle
[9:35] erroneously teaches and I quote I
[9:38] believe everything brother Branham says
[9:40] is thus saith the Lord this message has
[9:43] to be my absolute end quote
[9:46] this statement makes every word of
[9:48] brother Branham thus saith the Lord or
[9:51] infallible additionally they teach and I
[9:56] quote it must be all or nothing I have
[10:00] to believe that everything on tape is
[10:02] thus saith the Lord and the absolute the
[10:05] token for our day and I must
[10:07] unquestionably believe every word of
[10:10] brother Branham on tape end quote
[10:13] this is a dangerous false doctrine and I
[10:17] humbly believe it's the spirit of
[10:19] idolatry the danger of these statements
[10:21] is deifying William Branham by making
[10:25] every word he said the absolute when not
[10:28] every word he said was from God as he
[10:31] admitted himself on numerous occasions
[10:34] in 1958 by faith Moses brother Branham
[10:39] said in regards to his 1977 prediction
[10:41] it was not the Lord saying it which
[10:44] means it was not thus saith the Lord and
[10:47] that I predict now this is not the Lord
[10:50] saying this the other about the woman in
[10:52] his is the Lord but I predicted in
[10:55] nineteen and and thirty 33 that the
[11:00] world would be total annihilation before
[11:02] 77
[11:06] William Branham also said it was a very
[11:08] awful thing and tommyrot
[11:10] to make him infallible they claimed a
[11:13] year that some brethren up there that
[11:15] does it on sent them up there and
[11:17] they're preaching that man should leave
[11:19] their wives and hunt for their spiritual
[11:21] mate and at the that I am perfectly
[11:25] infallible that there's nothing and all
[11:28] some of the office things you've ever
[11:29] heard and if this church knows that we
[11:32] don't stand for no such tommyrot is that
[11:37] thirdly jeffersonville teaches only the
[11:40] true seed of Abraham believed every word
[11:43] on brother branham's tapes are thus
[11:45] saith the Lord which excludes everyone
[11:48] else from being the Royal seat of
[11:50] Abraham and I quote but God's prophet
[11:54] told us there would be a group of people
[11:55] that would believe every word they are
[11:58] the real living seed of Abraham and
[12:00] quote friends notice the pressure of
[12:05] fear this movement is using they say
[12:08] falsely if you don't believe every word
[12:11] of brother Branham on tape as thus saith
[12:14] the Lord you are not the real royal seat
[12:16] of Abraham the truth is real believers
[12:20] the real seat of Abraham do not exalt
[12:23] every word of William Branham to be
[12:25] infallible or thus saith the Lord this
[12:29] is because they know brother Branham
[12:30] says a true prophet and true leaders
[12:33] won't hold you to their own words in
[12:35] fear but will point you to the Word of
[12:38] God church age book chapter nine
[12:41] Laodicean Church age have you ever
[12:44] noticed how the people who lead others
[12:46] astray bind them closely to themselves
[12:49] by fear they say that if the people
[12:51] don't do what they say or if they leave
[12:54] then destruction will follow they are
[12:56] false prophets for a true prophet will
[12:59] always lead one to the word and bind the
[13:02] people to Jesus Christ and he won't tell
[13:05] the people to fear him or what he says
[13:07] but to fear what the word says
[13:11] thankfully as you listen to more of
[13:13] brother branham's tapes you find the
[13:15] truth that he made human mistakes yet he
[13:18] was a genuine prophet brother Branham
[13:21] said he was not infallible
[13:30] brother branham said profits are not
[13:32] infallible people brother branham said
[13:43] there were mix ups on his tapes think
[13:45] about like the other day I got something
[13:47] leased up I happen to hear yes I called
[13:49] it right there it's on the tape now I
[13:50] probably hear from it but if you happen
[13:53] to catch that on your tape remember look
[13:54] in the vial
[13:56] brother branham said prophets make
[13:58] mistakes and every prophet made their
[14:01] mistakes now all I could say I'm a man
[14:06] my words can just failed it's like any
[14:08] other man all of us I prove to you
[14:10] tonight that ever prophet everything
[14:12] else they've made their mistakes but God
[14:14] makes no mistakes his word is a truth
[14:19] brother branham said he made thousands
[14:21] of mistakes each year
[14:39] brother branham said every prophet must
[14:41] be tested by the word and we must test
[14:44] and prove all things we all must speak
[15:08] the same thing then we must speak not
[15:12] contrary but exactly with this word
[15:16] that's how a true prophet is tested
[15:19] whether he's got the word the Bible said
[15:21] if their testimony is not according to
[15:22] the law office there's no light in them
[15:25] it's got to be according to the work
[15:31] now here is the time that everything
[15:34] that I've said has got to be proven to
[15:37] be right or wrong don't divide what they
[15:39] prove all things the whole face then we
[15:45] must prove all things by the scripture
[15:49] not what if it's contrary to my faith
[15:53] and yet the scripture says though the
[15:55] scriptures right and I'm on the the
[15:58] scripture is always right and only way
[16:00] you can do anything is come back to the
[16:02] scripture the remember it's the elected
[16:07] is the only time that'll catch it what
[16:11] do you say how do you know what you're
[16:12] not right then catch me by the word
[16:15] contest your denomination by this word
[16:18] that's even if I prove all things the
[16:20] Bible
[16:22] don't stop getting the tapes just stay
[16:25] with it search it by the word and see if
[16:27] it's right the Bible said prove all
[16:29] things I know it's done poppers told
[16:31] Jesus told was the method Darwin also
[16:35] brother branham said be very careful
[16:37] listening to him to know when God was
[16:39] speaking or when brother randoms human
[16:41] side and his own opinions were being
[16:44] expressed which could potentially be
[16:47] fallible see I always asked you to be
[16:53] careful what you're listening to think
[16:56] there's so much of it that it's just the
[16:59] human side but always if there is
[17:02] something that goes forth it will speak
[17:05] it it's thus saith the Lord even to
[17:08] visions or anything I could be
[17:11] altogether wrong am i thought about
[17:13] Martin Luther King I don't know I can't
[17:16] say if that's just my opinion
[17:20] now let's look at more brother branham
[17:22] absolute quotes and remember brother
[17:25] branham never says I am the absolute or
[17:28] my tapes are the absolute listen to
[17:33] these numerous quotations from brother
[17:35] Branham in which he describes the
[17:37] absolute you will discover there are
[17:40] numerous synonyms for the absolute but
[17:42] they really are one in the same thing
[17:44] the person of Jesus Christ
[17:48] brother random calls the absolute Jesus
[17:51] Christ from one place to another but if
[18:07] you just take the real absolute
[18:13] he slays me yeah trust me
[18:17] haha my anchor holds within the veil
[18:20] I had a absolute I tied myself to his
[18:24] word and his word before him he is my
[18:27] absolute I found out all these other
[18:30] things may fail but Christ can never
[18:33] fail now when you become like Paul had
[18:39] the same absolute that he had a
[18:42] christ-centered life is a different life
[18:45] than what you want
[18:50] but he helped to and was not disobedient
[18:53] he carried it out to the minute or it
[18:57] was an absolute and any christ-centered
[19:00] life that's your absolute
[19:05] how happen to one we were reading about
[19:09] he had a christ-centered call that was
[19:14] his absolute
[19:17] and as a closing of this meeting I'm
[19:20] trying to tell you the reason that I
[19:23] acted and said the things I did because
[19:26] long ago I've taken Christ for my
[19:29] absolute
[19:31] there's none of these things bother me
[19:34] or he was hired to an absolute price
[19:37] never true achievement is tied to an
[19:40] absolute absolute is the word and
[19:45] everybody else's that's really bored of
[19:48] the fish the absolutist brother branham
[19:54] calls the Word of God the absolute has
[19:58] got to come to one final absolute and my
[20:02] absolute is the word the Bible and as a
[20:07] pastor here of the church my absolute is
[20:11] the word
[20:14] so forth but God's absolute is his word
[20:17] he gives it in heavens and earth will
[20:19] pass away that shall never pass away I
[20:22] like that
[20:24] now if he is our absolute that can be no
[20:28] other absolute you can't have stable
[20:31] mine my church is my absolute my Creed
[20:34] is my absolute if Christ is your
[20:35] absolute you believe Christ word is no
[20:38] other way to do it
[20:42] the sweetest voice I ever heard my life
[20:43] said don't fear to go anywhere and don't
[20:46] fear to do anything for the
[20:47] never-failing presence of Jesus Christ
[20:49] is with you wherever you go
[20:55] absolute my eager whole Jenner because
[20:58] it's a word of the Living God
[21:02] and only one thing dude you have to stop
[21:05] by yourself first the thing in the name
[21:07] of long-stay where when you're you say
[21:11] but brother rather you make people hate
[21:13] you love
[21:14] that's not absolute Kate rest older door
[21:18] my flesh you got us to learn
[21:23] brother branham cause the Holy Spirit or
[21:26] the Holy Ghost the absolute best our
[21:30] heads just move but you haven't got that
[21:32] absolute down get it if you'd like to
[21:37] have that absolute that assurance in
[21:39] your heart of the Holy Spirit raise your
[21:41] hand say I want something out of
[21:43] punctuate the Word of God I see the word
[21:45] of God maiden minimus
[21:48] that's it mother when a man comes to
[21:51] Christ you don't want to take some
[21:52] preachers word some secretaries work
[21:54] some something else you Protestants
[21:56] don't take this better go to that
[21:58] absolute again and feel with the Holy
[22:05] Ghost in your CD the Bible being
[22:07] manifested of humility love through your
[22:10] life oh then that's your absolute and
[22:14] brother branham calls the pillar of fire
[22:17] and God and the Holy Spirit the absolute
[22:23] but it didn't work
[22:25] it failed Moses had that absolute Paul
[22:29] had to say an absolute the same pillar
[22:32] for the second Holy Spirit the same God
[22:35] now the hours will be them present it's
[22:41] always
[22:44] based upon all these quotes we can
[22:47] conclude that there is one absolute and
[22:49] that is Jesus Christ before we finish
[22:53] let's look at one often misunderstood
[22:55] brother branham quote the one absolute
[22:59] quote about brother Branham that some
[23:01] misunderstand is found in the church
[23:04] order sermon from December 26 1963
[23:08] brother Branham says you kind of look to
[23:10] me to be your absolute it's got to come
[23:15] to one final absolute and my absolute is
[23:20] the word the Bible and as a pastor here
[23:24] of the church my absolute is the word
[23:28] and I know your brothers you kind of
[23:31] look to me to be your absolute to want
[23:34] as long as I follow God as Paul said in
[23:36] the scripture you follow me as I follow
[23:39] Christ and then I expect you brethren at
[23:43] any time that you see me to get away
[23:45] from this scripture to come to me
[23:47] privately and tell me or I'm wrong I
[23:49] don't care if you're one of the trustees
[23:52] of you're the janitor whoever you are
[23:54] you're duty-bound to me as a brother in
[23:57] Christ to tell me when I'm wrong
[24:00] scripturally if it's a question let's
[24:03] set out and solve it out together
[24:07] after listening this quote let's take
[24:10] into consideration the context in which
[24:12] brother Branham was speaking in first he
[24:15] was having a meeting with his Deacons
[24:17] and brothers in the church as well as
[24:19] the pastor brother Ormond Neville and he
[24:22] was setting the gifts in order like
[24:24] tongues prophecy and interpretation
[24:27] brother Branham began though by saying
[24:29] his absolute was the word and then he
[24:32] says the brothers kind of looked to him
[24:34] as an absolute please know that brother
[24:37] Branham never says Jesus is kind of the
[24:40] absolute brother Branham never hesitated
[24:44] about Jesus Christ being the one and
[24:47] only absolute so this means brother
[24:50] Branham was using a different definition
[24:52] of the word absolute he was using the
[24:55] definition that means in control or
[24:58] complete authority because he's speaking
[25:02] to the local church in Jeffersonville he
[25:05] said someone had to be the head or
[25:07] leader and this agrees with other quotes
[25:09] brother Branham made when he said the
[25:11] pastor has the complete or supreme
[25:14] authority of the local assembly
[25:31] but the full and complete authority of
[25:35] the church is the pastor read that new
[25:38] Bibles hit that's not bad Lord to be
[25:42] sure we're right brother branham then
[25:44] gives a scriptural reference for what he
[25:45] means that he's kind of an absolute he
[25:48] quotes first Corinthians 11 verse 1 in
[25:51] which Paul says to follow or imitate me
[25:54] as I imitate Jesus Christ so it is clear
[26:00] Paul did not want to be worshipped when
[26:02] he said follow me as I follow Christ nor
[26:05] did Paul want every person that heard
[26:07] him to exalt his every word to
[26:10] infallibility this is true because of
[26:13] two scriptures 1st Corinthians 7 12 Paul
[26:17] says but to the rest speak I not the
[26:19] Lord so here's a case where Paul
[26:22] differentiates his own word from God's
[26:25] Word a second example is in Galatians 1
[26:28] verses 6 to 12 Paul says there's a curse
[26:32] upon anyone who adds or takes away from
[26:35] the gospel he first preached and he said
[26:38] if we or an angel so Paul puts himself
[26:41] in that category so Paul says there's a
[26:44] possibility that he could say something
[26:46] wrong so Paul is saying that even he
[26:49] cannot change the revelation that Jesus
[26:51] Christ gave him at the beginning when
[26:54] understood correctly brother Branham is
[26:57] saying the Brethren wanted to follow him
[26:59] like believers followed Paul yet even
[27:01] every word Paul said was not thus saith
[27:04] the Lord
[27:04] Paul says follow his Christ centered
[27:07] life like he tells the Thessalonians to
[27:10] follow the examples of other godly
[27:12] churches in the book of 1st
[27:14] Thessalonians where Paul told the church
[27:17] in Thessalonica to follow the example of
[27:20] the churches in Judea and Friends
[27:24] remember brother branham's message was
[27:26] to restore Paul's teaching not to change
[27:29] it we are resting on that in closing I
[27:36] hope you can see the evidence from the
[27:38] Bible and brother Rams own words that
[27:41] Jesus Christ is the one and only
[27:43] absolute friend brother randoms tapes
[27:47] are not the absolute but they do direct
[27:49] us to the absolute the unlimited
[27:52] all-powerful person of the Lord Jesus
[27:54] Christ I'll leave you with this quote in
[27:58] which brother branham prays for us to
[28:00] look away from him and see the
[28:03] omnipotent one Jesus Christ the Son of
[28:06] God that Christ might become the
[28:08] absolute to the entire congregation best
[28:13] of Trustees that man who stood with me
[28:16] so gracious in this great dark time that
[28:20] have been through stand with the church
[28:22] who prayed with me and stood behind me
[28:24] in times of trouble lord I love them and
[28:28] I offer my prayer that they will look to
[28:31] You Lord may they look away from this
[28:33] moral play of a service may they look to
[28:37] him who is the omnipotent who is and we
[28:41] know Lord that we are finite no matter
[28:43] who we are we're still mortal but not
[28:47] the messenger but the message granted
[28:50] Lord that's where we point to Jesus
[28:52] Christ the Son of God grant that he'll
[28:54] be so real to everyone here today even
[28:56] to the little children that he'll become
[28:58] the absolute of the into our
[29:01] congregation we asked in Jesus name Amen
