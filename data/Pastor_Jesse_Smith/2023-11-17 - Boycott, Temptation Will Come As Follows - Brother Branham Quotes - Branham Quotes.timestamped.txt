[0:01] I predict that the two denominational
[0:04] groups Pentecostal and the Evangelical
[0:08] groups will work together in a
[0:11] denomination will unite themselves
[0:13] together and will become a member all of
[0:16] them of the Federation of the council
[0:18] churches or the council churches they
[0:21] already belong to it all of them and
[0:23] there will come through them a forcing
[0:26] or a
[0:27] boycott that'll stop everything but what
[0:30] belongs to that Union of
[0:32] churches that's what a the Bible said
[0:35] that there would be a boycott even in
[0:38] such a way would cause people to not buy
[0:40] or sell unless they had received this
[0:43] the mark of the beast which is
[0:46] romanism and the image of the Beast
[0:49] which is
[0:50] protestantism that the image of the
[0:52] Beast had Power Authority to give the
[0:55] image life to speak and it did and
[0:58] that's the Confederate ation of churches
[1:01] when they Confederate themselves
[1:03] together I many young people here I
[1:06] don't know Jesus may come this afternoon
[1:09] he may come next year I don't know when
[1:12] he'll be coming but if
[1:15] remember if I do not live to see that
[1:18] day of his coming which I hope that I
[1:20] will and somehow believe I will now if I
[1:24] do not see it do not let this word ever
[1:28] depart from your ears in your heart just
[1:32] remember I speak in the name of the
[1:36] Lord now I believe with all my heart
[1:39] that's the way it'll wind up there will
[1:41] be like a union a a boycott all such
[1:46] places as this here will be closed down
[1:49] and you'll not be able to speak unless
[1:50] you got a A permission or a license from
[1:54] this Federation of churches to hold a
[1:56] service it's almost as shows that does
[1:59] that now even even in the denomination
[2:01] it shows where it's at yeah so you have
[2:03] to have it and that's where it'll wind
[2:06] up at that's my prediction as the
[2:08] servant of Christ through the
[2:10] understanding that I have of the word
[2:12] and the inspiration that's where it will
[2:14] come the all signs are pointing to the
[2:17] end I just got through speaking on that
[2:20] and it's even to
[2:27] the remember there will be such a
[2:31] denominational Gathering pretty soon
[2:34] it'll be
[2:35] terrific and they will bring themselves
[2:39] together into this Federation of
[2:42] churches and then this kind of a church
[2:46] will be put out of operation as far as
[2:49] they
[2:50] know it's at that time that Jesus will
[2:54] appear and he will show which is bride
[2:57] amen and which is not and remember
[3:00] Christian friends I'm a man I can make
[3:04] mistakes but God being God cannot make a
[3:08] mistake all the words that's been
[3:11] written must be fulfilled Jesus said so
[3:15] so we've got things here in the
[3:17] scripture that must be fulfilled and
[3:20] that is one of the things this boycott
[3:22] to come but before this boycott can come
[3:25] of the marking of the Beast there has to
[3:27] be a seed sold for God to take a church
[3:31] out of it amen you understand now a seed
[3:35] has to be sold a denominational seed and
[3:38] there to make a farm or an image to the
[3:41] Beast the Church of Rome and there has
[3:43] to be a true bride and we understand
[3:47] that the so-called bride is
[3:52] rejected I will keep thee from the hour
[3:54] of Temptation which shall come upon all
[3:57] the world to try them that dwell upon
[4:00] the Earth this verse is not a
[4:02] declaration that the true church will go
[4:04] into and through the tribulation if it
[4:06] meant that it would have said that but
[4:09] it said I will keep thee from the hour
[4:11] of
[4:12] Temptation this temptation is exactly
[4:15] like the Temptation in Eden it will be a
[4:18] very inviting proposition held up in
[4:20] direct opposition to God's commanded
[4:22] word and yet from the standpoint of
[4:24] human reasoning it will be so very right
[4:27] so enlightening and lifegiving as to
[4:28] fool the world
[4:30] only the very elect will not be fooled
[4:33] the Temptation will come as follows The
[4:36] ecumenical move that has started on what
[4:38] seems such a beautiful and blessed
[4:40] principle fulfilling Christ's prayer
[4:42] that we all might be one becomes so
[4:45] strong politically that she Bears
[4:47] pressure upon the government to cause
[4:49] all to join with her either directly or
[4:51] through adherence to principles enacted
[4:53] into law so that no people will be
[4:56] recognized as actual churches unless
[4:58] under direct or indirect domination of
[5:00] this Council little groups will lose
[5:03] Charters privileges Etc until they lose
[5:06] all property and spiritual rights with
[5:08] the people for example right now unless
[5:11] the local Ministerial Association
[5:12] approves in many if not most cities one
[5:15] cannot rent a building for religious
[5:17] services to become chaplain in the armed
[5:20] services hospitals Etc it is now almost
[5:23] mandatory to be recognized as acceptable
[5:25] to The trinitarian ecumenical
[5:27] groups as this pressure inre increases
[5:29] and it will it will be harder to resist
[5:32] for to resist is to lose privilege and
[5:35] so many will be tempted to go along for
[5:37] they will feel it is better to serve God
[5:39] publicly in the framework of this
[5:41] organization than not to serve God at
[5:43] all publicly but they er to believe the
[5:47] devil's lie is to serve Satan even
[5:49] though you may want to call him Jehovah
[5:52] but the elect will not be
[5:54] deceived furthermore the elect will not
[5:57] only be kept but as this move becomes
[5:59] the image erected to the Beast the
[6:02] Saints will be gone in the Rapture and
[6:05] this little delightful Winsome movement
[6:07] that started out in fellowship at
[6:09] Ephesus will become the monster of Satan
[6:11] that defiles and deceives the whole
[6:13] world for the church system of the Roman
[6:16] Catholic and the Protestant in coming
[6:18] together will control the whole wealth
[6:20] of the world system and force the whole
[6:22] earth into its religious trap or will
[6:24] kill them by refusing them the privilege
[6:27] of buying and selling whereby they would
[6:29] make a living this will be accomplished
[6:31] simply for the harlot's daughters are
[6:34] all but gone back to her in the meantime
[6:37] Rome has acquired nearly all the
[6:38] supplies of gold the Jews have the bonds
[6:41] and all the paper at the right time the
[6:44] Harlot will destroy the present day
[6:46] money system by calling in all the paper
[6:48] and demanding gold with no gold the
[6:51] system Falls the Jews will be trapped
[6:53] and come into the alliance and the
[6:55] Harlot church will take over the whole
[6:58] world
