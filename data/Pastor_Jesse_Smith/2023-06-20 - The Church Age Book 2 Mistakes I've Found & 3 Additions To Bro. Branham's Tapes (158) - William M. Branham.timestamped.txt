[0:00] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:03] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:05] this video is to show the two mistakes
[0:08] and three additions to the church age
[0:11] book that I found and of course this
[0:13] video is an answer to a viewer's
[0:15] question I had yesterday
[0:17] and also this video is meant as a
[0:19] conversation starter to start looking
[0:21] more deeply at the church age book it's
[0:24] a book I love as I've talked about
[0:25] before
[0:27] and before we look at the two mistakes
[0:28] and at least three additions to the
[0:30] church age book I just want to state
[0:32] five reasons I love the church age book
[0:34] and of course there could be more
[0:35] reasons but first the book is organized
[0:38] by chapter and verse
[0:40] second it's easy to read due to the
[0:42] edited grammar third most of the content
[0:45] is from Brother random's 1960 series on
[0:48] the seven Church ages
[0:50] fourth there are many scriptural
[0:52] citations proving brother Brandon
[0:54] pointed us back to the Bible
[0:55] and then fifth there's numerous sections
[0:58] that address important biblical topics
[1:00] and doctrines like water baptism the
[1:03] godhead serpent seed The Book of Life
[1:06] and many more
[1:09] so here's the first two mistakes that I
[1:11] found and of course there could be more
[1:12] mistakes
[1:13] the first mistake is on page 355 the
[1:16] book says quote now this false church
[1:19] has Zeal make no mistake about that her
[1:21] Zeal has literally been that of the Jews
[1:24] John 2 verse 17 the Zeo of thine house
[1:27] hath eaten me up but it is a wrong Zeal
[1:30] end quote
[1:31] and the reason this is wrong is because
[1:33] John 2 17 is about Jesus's Godly and
[1:37] holy Zeal not the Zeal for creeds
[1:41] Jesus's Zeal was the right Zeal the
[1:43] sinful Zeal of the Jews would be found
[1:45] in Romans 10 verse 2 which says for I
[1:48] bear them record that they have a Zeal
[1:50] of God but not according to knowledge
[1:53] so I believe Lee Vale here cited the
[1:55] wrong verse because John 2 17 speaks of
[1:58] Jesus's holy righteous Zeal and not the
[2:02] wrong zeal
[2:04] the second mistake is found on page 236
[2:07] this section says quote Satan and his
[2:10] satanic religion are in both of these
[2:11] beasts in Revelation 14 the the Beast
[2:14] that was wounded unto death but lived
[2:16] again is Imperial Pagan Rome that fell
[2:18] to the onslaught of the barbarians and
[2:21] thereby lost her temporal power end
[2:23] quote
[2:24] the reason this is wrong is because Lee
[2:26] Vale wrote down the wrong scripture
[2:28] reference the Beast that was wounded
[2:30] unto death but lived is not in
[2:32] Revelation 14 it's in Revelation Chapter
[2:34] 13 Verse 3. so this is just a wrong
[2:37] scriptural reference by Brother Vale
[2:40] and I'll read Revelation 13 Verse 3 and
[2:43] I saw one of his heads as it were
[2:44] wounded to death and his deadly wound
[2:46] was healed and all the world wandered
[2:48] after the Beast
[2:50] foreign
[2:55] the interruption I'd like to remind our
[2:58] listeners about two resources that that
[3:01] will greatly strengthen your faith
[3:03] according to my humble opinion in 2019 I
[3:05] wrote the book called restoring
[3:07] Christian modesty it's over 120 Pages
[3:10] showing the Bible foundations for a
[3:13] modest and holy appearance
[3:15] it covers all the guidelines for modest
[3:18] clothing and also covers bracelets
[3:21] necklaces Rings earrings nose rings
[3:25] and many more topics
[3:27] one of the most useful parts of this
[3:29] book is the chapter that shows the
[3:32] history of the United States and how
[3:34] they slowly rejected modest clothing and
[3:37] it Chronicles all these changes decade
[3:39] by decade from the 1800s to the present
[3:42] and the second resource is my 2021 book
[3:45] it's an 812 page book about the 12 New
[3:48] Testament Mysteries that brother Branham
[3:50] finished according to Revelation 10
[3:52] verse 7 brother random said the seventh
[3:55] Church age messenger would finish all
[3:56] these mysteries in the sermon called is
[3:58] this the sign of the answer from
[4:00] December 1962 friends this is an
[4:03] extensive Bible teaching on the major
[4:05] doctrines that brother Brenham gave us
[4:07] proving he was the seventh Church age
[4:09] messenger a genuine prophet of God and
[4:12] the Elijah Prophet to restore all things
[4:14] in a time when so many people are
[4:16] falling away from the message I feel
[4:18] these two resources will strengthen your
[4:20] faith if you want God to draw closer to
[4:22] you you've got to draw closer to him and
[4:24] many times that's through prayer Bible
[4:26] study worship so I know these two
[4:28] resources will be a great help to you
[4:30] they're available on Amazon I'm not a
[4:32] book salesman so if you can't afford
[4:34] them I'll gladly email you the free PDFs
[4:37] you can read them on your phone or
[4:39] tablet or print them off if you like
[4:41] recall acts 17 verse 11 seven the brains
[4:44] were more noble because they searched
[4:45] the Scriptures Daily to prove the things
[4:47] that Paul taught were true and so we
[4:50] must do the same thing today if we're
[4:51] spiritual nobility if we're spiritual
[4:54] royalty in the family of the Lord Jesus
[4:56] Christ the family of King Jesus then we
[4:58] should search the Scriptures Daily to
[5:00] prove brother Brown's teachings were
[5:02] thus saith the word of God thank you for
[5:04] your time now back to the content
[5:07] foreign
[5:11] now let's look at the three additions to
[5:13] the church age book and of course there
[5:15] could be more additions to the church
[5:16] age book that brother Brown never
[5:18] preached but as I said earlier this
[5:20] video is kind of like a conversation
[5:21] starter and I can build the list but
[5:23] again remember I love the church age
[5:25] book there's many wonderful revelations
[5:27] in it but it must be rightly divided
[5:30] because the book is not equal to the
[5:32] Bible just like brother random sermons
[5:33] they must be rightly divided as brother
[5:35] Ram told us prove all things try every
[5:38] Spirit test everything by the word of
[5:40] God every Doctrine must be Genesis to
[5:42] revelation
[5:43] addition number one is that some will
[5:45] enter eternal life solely on the grounds
[5:48] of being good to the Brethren this is
[5:49] found on page 281 I cannot find this
[5:53] statement on brother branham's tapes
[5:55] I hope to do an entire video on this
[5:57] subject I also call it the perhaps
[6:00] Nicodemus and gamalia subject of God
[6:03] possibly granting eternal life to those
[6:05] who were not Christians on the basis
[6:07] they were kind to Christians during
[6:09] their lifetimes
[6:11] there's four Witnesses about this
[6:13] possibility being legitimate the first
[6:15] one is according to brother Ram's
[6:16] Revelation on the fifth seal Jesus will
[6:19] grant the souls under the altar who are
[6:21] blinded Jews
[6:22] eternal life because they kept the
[6:24] testimony of the word of God yet during
[6:26] their lifetimes they never confessed
[6:28] Jesus Christ they were never Christians
[6:31] second in Joshua chapter 9 God granted
[6:34] mercy and forgiveness to the gibeonites
[6:35] because they did not fight against
[6:37] Joshua in Israel God forgave over 440
[6:41] years of their iniquity in a moment's
[6:43] time because they didn't fight against
[6:45] Israel and remember Hebrews 13 8 Jesus
[6:48] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[6:50] forever we see him forgiving people in
[6:53] Joshua and then also in the facile
[6:56] the third witness is from a brother
[6:58] random quote from questions and answers
[7:00] 1964. it's from Part Two Brother Branham
[7:04] was asked if people that had been
[7:05] married and divorced and remarried how
[7:07] can both or one of them be in the
[7:09] Rapture brother REM said I don't know he
[7:11] gives the scripture from First
[7:13] Corinthians 6 where adulterers will not
[7:16] inherit the kingdom of heaven but then
[7:18] he says there is places in the Bible he
[7:20] says where there might be a chance of
[7:23] you getting in he cites David eating the
[7:25] shoe bread and also how the priests
[7:28] would blaspheme on the Sabbath by
[7:30] working and yet they're still found
[7:31] blameless brother Graham said a greater
[7:33] than the Sabbath was here
[7:35] a fourth witness of course is Matthew 25
[7:37] verses 31-46 it's Jesus's story of the
[7:42] white Throne judgment
[7:43] of course the Bride of Jesus Christ the
[7:45] holy ghost-filled Saints will be sitting
[7:47] with Jesus on the Judgment Throne during
[7:49] this time and then the Saints will judge
[7:51] the Earth the Saints will judge the
[7:53] world all people who ever live will come
[7:55] before Jesus Christ and the Saints and
[7:58] Jesus Will separate the sheep from the
[8:00] goats and notice those like the Sheep
[8:03] being saved are surprised at being saved
[8:06] Jesus told them they did six acts of
[8:08] kindness to him but really they did the
[8:12] acts of kindness to Jesus's people and
[8:14] they were surprised at being saved
[8:16] of course any Christian who truly
[8:19] understands the word of God would not be
[8:21] surprised about being saved at the white
[8:23] Throne judgment so this scripture makes
[8:25] it look like people can be saved who are
[8:27] not Christians during their lifetimes
[8:29] just because they were good to
[8:30] Christians but again this is a perhaps
[8:33] statement not a for sure statement just
[8:36] like brother Branham said there might be
[8:38] a chance of you getting in
[8:41] a second edition is Joel 2 verses 23-26
[8:44] being thus saith the Lord that the
[8:47] fullness of Pentecost will be in the
[8:48] bride and that's on page 379 this
[8:52] prophecy is not on the tapes but I see
[8:54] how it fits with Joel 2 verse 28 and
[8:57] Acts chapter 2 with the initial
[8:59] outpouring of the Holy Ghost and then
[9:01] Joel 2 23-26 seems to be the final
[9:03] outpouring of the Holy Ghost before the
[9:05] rapture which brother random calls the
[9:07] latter rain and brothers spoke on this a
[9:10] couple times saying the Dynamics for the
[9:13] Rapture will be a refilling of the Holy
[9:15] Ghost and Friends remember that brother
[9:16] Branham went through at least a couple
[9:19] revisions of the church age book he said
[9:21] that indoors indoor 1965 he said quote
[9:25] and then after he got through sent it
[9:27] back a couple times for more statements
[9:29] which the book is going to press now
[9:31] after about three or four years end
[9:33] quote
[9:34] so it seems brother Brandon would only
[9:36] allow a thus saith the Lord's statement
[9:38] to be in this book if he approved it
[9:40] because he went through it a couple
[9:41] times
[9:43] the Third Edition I found is that the
[9:45] elect cannot persecute the elect that's
[9:48] found on page 359 now two simple Bible
[9:51] examples came to my mind first Saint
[9:53] Paul was elect and yet he persecuted
[9:56] Christians before he was a Christian
[9:58] also King Saul was saved we know he
[10:01] repented right before he died and the
[10:04] prophet Samuel said he would be with him
[10:05] in Abraham's bosom so King Saul was
[10:07] elected to eternal life
[10:09] yet he persecuted David
[10:13] so friends I hope this video has been a
[10:15] good conversation starter I look forward
[10:17] to the comments below and perhaps I'll
[10:18] do another video in the future
[10:20] and Lord willing I'll put these two
[10:22] videos from this week in a podcast
[10:24] hopefully I'll get that out today or
[10:25] tomorrow
[10:27] if you have any questions concerns or
[10:29] testimonies about this video please
[10:31] contact me
[10:32] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[10:35] the desire of your heart
