[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] It's too bad. I wish I had the means to
[0:05] let that boy go to school for an artist.
[0:09] I mean, God is an art. Don't you God is
[0:11] in music. God is an art. God is in this.
[0:14] And it's too bad to see a talent like
[0:15] that wouldn't be uh uh developed. More
[0:20] he does, the more developing it'll be.
[0:23] Greetings, friends, in the matchless
[0:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[0:27] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:29] viewer's question about college. The
[0:32] viewer asks, should a Christian go to
[0:34] college? So, by God's grace, the answer
[0:37] is a Christian should only go to college
[0:40] if the Lord leads the individual there.
[0:43] Each individual must find the perfect
[0:44] will of God for his or her life. So, I
[0:48] have four sections to this video here.
[0:50] The first section is the balance on
[0:52] education. So first of all, yes, most
[0:55] educators are sinners because Jesus
[0:58] said, "Few will find the narrow road."
[1:00] So most teachers or instructors or
[1:02] professors are sinners. And yes, most
[1:05] educational institutions push wicked
[1:08] woke ideologies which is of the devil.
[1:11] But at the same time, when you or I need
[1:14] a surgery or glasses or a veterinarian
[1:17] or any other service that requires a
[1:21] degree, a college degree of some sort,
[1:23] then we are thankful for their knowledge
[1:25] and expertise. Even yesterday, I took my
[1:28] daughter to the dentist and I was very
[1:30] thankful for his expertise to fix her
[1:32] tooth. And I want to also say, brother
[1:34] Brandham placed a big importance on the
[1:38] education of his children. I have a
[1:40] quote here from March 1963. God hiding
[1:42] himself in simplicity. And brother Ram
[1:45] said only he came back to Jeffersonville
[1:48] for the opening of the seven seals. Now
[1:50] consider that brother Ram's wife and
[1:52] children all missed the revelation of
[1:54] the seven seals which was the
[1:56] fulfillment of Revelation 10 1-7. his
[2:00] whole family missed the fulfillment of
[2:02] Revelation 10 1-7 because he was
[2:06] emphasizing the importance of education
[2:09] for his family. Let's listen to this
[2:11] quote.
[2:13] I'm bringing you this morning greetings
[2:15] from my wife and my children who long to
[2:20] be here at this time for this
[2:22] dedicational service and these a week of
[2:27] consecration to
[2:29] Christ. But the children are in school
[2:32] and it's hard to get
[2:34] away and they have about worn away from
[2:38] their homesick feeling for the house.
[2:42] But we will never wear away the feeling
[2:45] for your people. Hallelujah.
[2:49] Hallelujah. But you don't wear that
[2:51] away. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:55] High polish worldly wisdom educated
[2:59] always misses him. Amen. Right now, I'm
[3:03] not here and there I know there's school
[3:06] teachers, two or three that I know of
[3:07] sitting in here and I'm not here to
[3:10] contradict school and education and try
[3:14] to support illiter. I'm not here for
[3:17] that. But what it is the people as so
[3:21] placed so much upon
[3:23] that until they're even in the
[3:26] seminaries and so forth, they're missing
[3:28] the very thing that God has put before
[3:31] them. Amen.
[3:33] Next, Brother Brandham said he wished a
[3:35] young man could go to art school to
[3:38] improve his art skills. This is from the
[3:40] sermon, the restoration of the bride
[3:42] tree, 1962.
[3:44] Jerry Stephy painted this beautiful
[3:46] picture of Brother Brandham, which I've
[3:47] seen. It's still hanging in Brother
[3:48] Brandham's office there at the Brandom
[3:50] Tabernacle. And Brother Brandham said,
[3:52] "It's too bad. I wish I had the means to
[3:54] let that boy go to school for an
[3:56] artist." And if I'm not mistaken, this
[3:59] young man was a teenager or perhaps
[4:01] young adult. And brother Bam wished he
[4:03] had the money to send him to an art
[4:05] school to better his talent. Let's
[4:07] listen to the quote.
[4:09] Brother Jerry
[4:12] Steppy painted that
[4:14] picture. God bless that
[4:16] boy. Hallelujah. That's very fine.
[4:19] Jerry, if you're here this morning,
[4:22] it's too bad. I wish I had the means to
[4:25] let that boy go to school for an artist.
[4:28] I believe God is an art. Don't you God
[4:30] is in music. God is an art. God is in
[4:33] this. And it's too bad to see a talent
[4:34] like that wouldn't be uh uh developed.
[4:39] More he does, the more developing it'll
[4:41] be. And I I pray that God will bless
[4:43] you, Jerry.
[4:46] And also remember friends, Daniel and
[4:48] his three friends were the most
[4:49] intelligent scientists in all of
[4:51] Babylon. They were yielding their gifts
[4:53] to God Almighty. Daniel 1:4 said, "They
[4:57] were well-favored, skillful in all
[4:59] wisdom, cunning in knowledge and
[5:02] understanding science." And they had the
[5:04] ability to teach the learning and tongue
[5:07] of the Chaldans. So the fact is we must
[5:10] all find our gifts and talents that are
[5:12] given to us by God Almighty and then use
[5:15] them for his
[5:16] glory. So that's the balance on
[5:18] education. Now let's look at how to find
[5:19] the will of God for one's life. The most
[5:22] important part for the will of God is to
[5:24] do the perfect will of God. Romans 12:1
[5:28] and2 says just that we must get a
[5:30] transformed mind in order to find the
[5:33] perfect will of God for our life. We
[5:35] never want to take the permissive will
[5:36] of God. We want to take the perfect will
[5:39] of God. That's God's first word, God's
[5:41] first command on any situation. We saw
[5:45] Hezekiah took the permissive will of God
[5:47] by wanting a longer life. Balam took the
[5:49] permissive will of God by going down
[5:51] with Bao when he should not have because
[5:53] God's first word was don't go. God's
[5:56] first word to Hezekiah was set your
[5:58] house in order. You're going to die. But
[5:59] God gave both of them the permissive
[6:01] will of God. Remember friends, let's use
[6:03] the fear of the Lord to find the perfect
[6:06] will of God. Proverbs 3:7 and of course
[6:08] there's numerous other scriptures that
[6:10] say something similar. Fear the Lord and
[6:12] depart from evil. The perfect will of
[6:15] God will always take us away from evil,
[6:17] not into evil. But then the balance is
[6:20] with college is that you, at least in
[6:21] America, you can do online college where
[6:23] you don't even have to go live with a
[6:26] bunch of sinners or you can commute to
[6:29] campuses. You don't have to live with
[6:31] sinners on campus. And friends, even if
[6:34] there would be a case, let's say, where
[6:35] someone was forced to go to college
[6:37] perhaps by their parents or something,
[6:39] and they felt they were following God's
[6:40] will for their life, even living amongst
[6:43] sinners, a Christian can overcome.
[6:45] Again, just like Daniel and the three
[6:47] Hebrew children, it's not for everyone.
[6:49] I believe there are rare cases. But if
[6:51] God allowed Daniel and his three friends
[6:54] to go right into the heart of Babylon
[6:56] and overcome, well, surely we can
[6:58] overcome because greater is he that's in
[7:00] us than he that's in the world. And I'm
[7:03] not advocating for people to go into a
[7:05] sinful situation if they know it's
[7:07] wrong. Again, we're looking at the
[7:09] calling of God on people's lives, such
[7:12] as in the case of Daniel and his three
[7:14] Hebrew friends. Also, remember to find
[7:17] the will of God, you have to ask, seek,
[7:19] and knock and cry aloud out to God. And
[7:22] then God will reveal his perfect will to
[7:24] you. Proverbs 2:es 3-6 say, "You have to
[7:28] cry after God's knowledge. Lift up your
[7:31] voice for understanding. You got to get
[7:32] alone with God. Cry out to God from the
[7:35] depths of your soul. You got to seek for
[7:37] the truth. You have to search for God's
[7:39] perfect will. And then you understand
[7:41] the fear of the Lord. Proverbs 2:5 and
[7:44] find the knowledge or the will of
[7:47] God. Matthew 7 7 and 8 of course say,
[7:50] "Ask and it shall be given unto you.
[7:52] Seek and you shall find. Knock and it
[7:54] shall be opened unto you." And then you
[7:57] have the promise. While you pray, you
[7:58] can have that promise. I know God's
[8:00] going to answer me because everyone that
[8:01] asks receives. According to Matthew 7:8,
[8:05] he that seeks finds and when people
[8:07] knock, it shall be open. You can say,
[8:10] Lord, that's your promise. You're going
[8:11] to open it to me. That's thus sayith the
[8:14] scripture. So the third point is that
[8:17] the predestination of God or God's
[8:19] sovereignty gives us peace. Brother Ram
[8:22] tells us this in the sermon, Come Follow
[8:24] Me, Tucson, Arizona, June 1st, 1963.
[8:28] Brother man was saying he wished he
[8:30] could have kept his kids out of the high
[8:31] schools and he wished he could have sent
[8:33] them up into an Indian reservation or he
[8:36] called him an Indian camp. He wished
[8:38] they didn't have to go to the high
[8:39] schools. They could have just went up to
[8:40] some quiet Indian reservation where
[8:42] there was no people. But then brother
[8:44] Random goes to the sovereignty of God.
[8:46] Brother Ram's mind goes back to the plan
[8:48] of God for their life, the
[8:50] predestination of the seed that's inside
[8:52] of every believer. Brother Ram said,
[8:54] "But here is what it is. What's in the
[8:57] kid is going to come out. No matter
[8:58] where it is, it's got to come out. So,
[9:01] Brother Ram says, "The seed in the
[9:03] individual will come out. No matter if
[9:04] they're in a sinful high school or if
[9:07] they're up in an Indian camp, in a
[9:09] reservation with nature supposedly
[9:11] closer to God, whatever's in the
[9:13] individual is going to come out." Let's
[9:14] listen to the quote.
[9:17] and a father and mother with the praying
[9:19] constantly that that their son would not
[9:22] turn out just an ordinary man that he'd
[9:23] be an extraordinary man. All parents
[9:27] want that. Did you hear Jesus refer to
[9:29] that commandment? Honor the father and
[9:31] mother and
[9:34] stop. And that's the ambition of any
[9:36] parent to do the best for their children
[9:38] they can educate them give them things
[9:41] maybe that they wasn't able to get.
[9:44] That's the way I feel about my children.
[9:46] I think sometime in going to
[9:48] school now. I think send Becky and Sarah
[9:51] and Joseph into these high schools and
[9:53] things where all this go on's at. I
[9:57] think I'll take them and get back into
[9:58] the mountain and and raise them up there
[10:00] at the like the Indians live. But here's
[10:04] what it is. What's in the kids going to
[10:07] come
[10:08] out and no matter where it is, it's got
[10:11] it's going to come out. If it's evil in
[10:13] there, it'll come out in the Indian
[10:14] camp.
[10:16] is good in there, it'll come out in any
[10:18] camp. See, it's what's in the kid, the
[10:20] makeup of the
[10:22] kid, what's on the inside of you. And
[10:24] what you are now is what you're probably
[10:26] be the rest of your life. You're on a
[10:28] changing spot. Do you know
[10:31] what? 86% of the conversions to Jesus
[10:35] Christ is done before 21 years
[10:38] old. Shows the statistic shows it. 86%
[10:42] that come to Christ come before they're
[10:44] 21. you be if you pass that age you
[10:47] become more molded or set in your ways.
[10:50] Well, it's possible surely they come 70
[10:52] 80 years old but it's very rare that you
[10:56] make yourself when you're young. You set
[10:58] your ambitions to what you want to do
[11:00] and what you're trying to achieve in
[11:02] life. You think of it and as you think
[11:06] of course your mind it's presented into
[11:08] your mind by an unknown something and it
[11:11] it dominates your mind and then when it
[11:13] becomes in your mind then you speak it
[11:15] that you're going to do it and then your
[11:16] ambitions drive you to it. And the final
[11:19] section is just my personal testimony.
[11:21] Some of you know I'm a public school
[11:23] teacher. I've taught elementary
[11:24] education now for 21 years. When I first
[11:28] went to college in 1999, I was not a
[11:30] Christian. I was running from the Lord.
[11:32] And then I got saved in January 2000, my
[11:35] first year of college. The message came
[11:37] to me almost two years later in November
[11:40] 2001. But even when I got saved, even in
[11:43] a denomination in January 2000, I
[11:46] instantly threw away all my worldly
[11:48] music. I was sold out to Jesus. I was
[11:50] doing my best and I was able to overcome
[11:52] almost all the temptations there in my
[11:55] dorm during my freshman year surrounded
[11:58] by sinners with a sinful roommate that
[12:00] would bring his girlfriend into the room
[12:02] and I was able to overcome and live
[12:04] above sin even as a denominational
[12:06] Christian by the grace of God reading my
[12:08] Bible every day going to church
[12:11] faithfully. But then when the message
[12:13] came to me, I was already moved out my
[12:15] second year in college. I was moved out
[12:17] of the dorms into a house with other
[12:19] Christian athletes, soccer players,
[12:21] football players. Of course, they're
[12:23] denominational. But when I received the
[12:25] message, God gave me the grace to live
[12:27] higher and live above the denominational
[12:29] teachings. I just stayed away from the
[12:31] TV. I tried to spend as much time at the
[12:33] library or with the saints from the
[12:36] message churches that I possibly could.
[12:38] Twice during the week, Thursday night,
[12:39] of course, and Sunday when we had our
[12:42] meetings throughout the week by the
[12:43] grace of God. And I didn't feel led to
[12:46] quit college when the message came to me
[12:48] in November 2001. I felt to continue
[12:50] going on and I'm very thankful I did.
[12:53] Now, because I'm a school teacher these
[12:54] 21 years, I get more time with my
[12:56] family. I get more holidays off. I get
[12:59] the summers off. We have great insurance
[13:01] for my eight and almost nine children.
[13:04] And I can pastor a church and work
[13:06] full-time as an educator. I can do both
[13:09] by the grace of God. And I've had
[13:11] numerous families over the years from
[13:14] the school where I work tell me that I
[13:17] was an answer to their prayers for their
[13:19] children. So I just take that as a sign
[13:21] that I've done God's perfect will for my
[13:23] life. I've only wanted to do God's
[13:25] perfect will. I've never wanted to do
[13:27] just my will. And also for the past 10
[13:30] years or so, a friend and I have been
[13:32] able to teach Bible club either after
[13:34] school or before school. So for the last
[13:36] 10 years, we've taught about Jesus.
[13:39] We've worshiped Jesus. We've danced in
[13:41] the classroom. We've prayed together.
[13:43] We've prayed for kids with cancer. We
[13:44] prayed for teachers with cancer. In
[13:47] other words, we've turned those
[13:48] classrooms into sanctuaries by the grace
[13:51] of God. So, that's just a brief summary
[13:53] of my testimony in education. And I've
[13:56] had to get, of course, a master's
[13:57] degree. And now I'm at over 40 credits
[14:01] beyond a master's degree. And now I can
[14:03] really slow down with the number of
[14:05] courses I have to take. Now, it's only
[14:07] about a couple courses every 5 years I
[14:09] have to take. And so the load of work
[14:11] has definitely decreased. So I'm
[14:13] thankful for that by the grace of God.
[14:15] But another benefit of being in
[14:16] education is that I was able to write
[14:18] two books. The Restoring Christian
[14:20] Modesty and the 12 New Testament
[14:21] mysteries. In fact, the first book,
[14:23] Restoring Christian Modesty, a lot of
[14:25] those sources about how modesty had
[14:27] changed in the United States came from
[14:29] books that I found while I was in
[14:31] college. In fact, the book, What
[14:33] Americans Wore, was a book one of my
[14:35] instructors held up. And I knew at that
[14:37] moment that's the very reason I'm in
[14:39] this college and in this course was to
[14:42] get the truth about how modesty had been
[14:45] forsaken by Americans, but how God
[14:48] wanted to restore it in the bride of
[14:50] Jesus Christ. That's a wonderful part of
[14:51] my testimony. I knew God had placed me
[14:53] there for a time and season. And so I
[14:56] rejoice in the plan of God for my life.
[14:58] In
[14:59] closing, friends, if you have any
[15:01] questions or concerns about this video,
[15:03] please contact me. I know I could have
[15:04] done a lot more quotes on this topic.
[15:07] Undoubtedly, there's lots of quotes that
[15:09] I didn't use on this topic. So, perhaps
[15:11] I can do a part two, but I just want to
[15:12] get a video out on this topic to answer
[15:15] the dear person's question by the grace
[15:17] of God. Friends, for your life, seek God
[15:20] with all your heart, soul, mind, and
[15:21] strength. Love God with everything you
[15:24] have. And if you ask, you'll receive. If
[15:27] you seek, you'll find. If you knock,
[15:29] surely the Lord will open his will unto
[15:31] you.
[15:33] If you have any questions, concerns or
[15:34] testimonies about this video, please
[15:36] contact
[15:36] me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ
[15:39] be the desire of your heart.
[15:43] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[15:45] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[15:47] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[15:50] good news that Jesus raised from the
[15:52] dead, living among man today, his
[15:54] church. The same Jesus that was
[15:57] yesterday will be today and
[16:00] forever. He never failed.
