[0:11] the bible gives us types or
[0:13] foreshadowing of the three works of
[0:15] grace that god has now implemented in
[0:17] the new testament the first example is
[0:20] the earth and how god has and will use
[0:23] three works to redeem this earth and
[0:25] will eventually dwell on this earth just
[0:27] as he has redeemed man in order to dwell
[0:30] in him
[0:31] the first step was the water in noah's
[0:33] flood which is a type of the water
[0:35] baptism that follows justification by
[0:38] faith
[0:39] next the earth was sanctified by
[0:41] christ's blood when jesus was on the
[0:43] cross and his blood poured out on the
[0:45] earth after the soldier pierced his side
[0:48] with a spear
[0:49] the third and final step will be the
[0:51] fire baptism to come upon the earth
[0:54] after the battle of armageddon spoken of
[0:56] by saint peter in saint peter 2 chapter
[0:59] 3 verse 12
[1:01] looking for and hasting unto the coming
[1:03] of the day of god wherein the heavens
[1:05] being on fire shall be dissolved and the
[1:08] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[1:10] notice that this fiery baptism
[1:12] experience allows jesus to return to the
[1:15] earth as son of david and reign for a
[1:17] thousand years
[1:19] this coming of jesus to dwell in the
[1:20] earth is a type of how the holy ghost
[1:23] comes to dwell and abide in our souls
[1:26] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:28] here are four more clear examples from
[1:30] nature and the old testament that
[1:32] testify of the three works of grace in
[1:35] the new testament
[1:37] the natural birth of a baby from the
[1:39] womb of a pregnant mother types the
[1:41] three stages of the new birth by the
[1:43] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:45] in the natural birth first the woman's
[1:47] water breaks which types water baptism
[1:50] and justification
[1:51] second there is a bloody show before the
[1:53] child is born which types sanctification
[1:57] third the actual birth of the baby takes
[1:59] place and the spirit of the baby cries
[2:01] out after it enters this world this
[2:03] types the new birth or the baptism of
[2:06] the holy ghost
[2:07] first john 5 8 and there are three that
[2:10] bear witness in earth the spirit and the
[2:12] water and the blood and these three
[2:14] agree in one
[2:16] the nation of israel leaving egypt under
[2:18] the ministry of moses and then
[2:19] possessing the land of canaan the
[2:21] promised land
[2:22] also types the three works of grace in
[2:24] the new testament
[2:25] first israel was brought out of egypt
[2:28] and passed through the waters of the red
[2:29] sea which types water baptism and
[2:32] justification
[2:33] second israel was proved or tried by god
[2:36] in the wilderness for forty years which
[2:38] types sanctification
[2:40] third israel entered the promised land
[2:42] to dwell there permanently and possess
[2:44] the land which types the new birth and
[2:46] how the holy ghost permanently dwells in
[2:49] our bodies
[2:51] god foretold of the three works of grace
[2:53] in ezekiel chapter 36 verses 26 and 27
[2:57] a new heart also will i give you and a
[2:59] new spirit will i put within you and i
[3:01] will take away the stony heart out of
[3:03] your flesh and i'll give you and heart
[3:05] of flesh
[3:06] and i will put my spirit within you and
[3:08] cause you to walk in my statutes and ye
[3:11] shall keep my judgments and do them
[3:14] the new heart represents justification
[3:16] the new spirit represents sanctification
[3:19] and god's spirit or my spirit types the
[3:22] baptism of the holy ghost that comes
[3:23] upon a believer as the third work of
[3:26] grace
[3:28] abraham's life itself also foreshadowed
[3:30] the three works of grace
[3:32] first he was called by god to come out
[3:34] from his nation family and house in
[3:37] genesis chapter 12 verses 1 through 3
[3:39] which types justification and leaving
[3:42] the things of the world
[3:43] next the entire time afterwards was his
[3:46] time of sanctification or second work of
[3:48] grace because we know the third work of
[3:50] grace and abraham's life would have been
[3:52] the token or sign of the circumcision in
[3:55] genesis chapter 17 verses 9 through 14.
[4:00] the token of the circumcision in
[4:01] abraham's life represents the baptism of
[4:04] the holy ghost in the new testament
[4:06] because the new testament teaches this
[4:08] in the following scriptures
[4:10] romans 2 verse 29
[4:12] but he is a jew which is one inwardly
[4:14] and circumcision is that of the heart in
[4:17] the spirit and not in the letter whose
[4:19] praise is not of men but of god
[4:22] philippians 3 verse 3
[4:24] for we are the circumcision which
[4:26] worship god in the spirit and rejoice in
[4:28] christ jesus which have no confidence in
[4:31] the flesh
[4:32] galatians 3 14 that the blessing of
[4:35] abraham might come on the gentiles
[4:37] through jesus christ that we might
[4:39] receive the promise of the spirit
[4:40] through faith
[4:46] here are three clear examples of real
[4:49] bible characters from the new testament
[4:51] who experience the three works of grace
[4:53] in their lives saint peter cornelius and
[4:56] the believers of ephesus
[4:59] first saint peter experienced
[5:01] justification at some point prior to
[5:04] matthew chapter 16 verses 15-19 because
[5:07] jesus told him that he had already
[5:09] received revelation that jesus was the
[5:12] messiah the son of the living god from
[5:14] god himself
[5:16] the moment peter received that
[5:17] revelation was the moment he believed
[5:19] and recognized his salvation from god
[5:23] peter then experienced sanctification
[5:25] during the entire time that followed his
[5:27] revelation of jesus as the messiah unto
[5:30] the end of acts chapter 1.
[5:35] this is obvious because jesus prayed
[5:37] specifically for peter and all the
[5:39] disciples to be sanctified in john
[5:42] chapter 17 verses 17 through 20.
[5:45] sanctify them through thy truth thy word
[5:48] is truth
[5:49] as thou has sent me into the world even
[5:52] so have i also sent them into the world
[5:55] and for their sakes i sanctify myself
[5:58] that they also might be sanctified
[6:00] through the truth
[6:01] neither pray i for these alone but for
[6:03] them also which shall believe on me
[6:05] through their word
[6:07] acts chapter 2 showed peter received the
[6:09] third step of grace when he was born
[6:11] again on the day of pentecost
[6:15] the holy ghost filled each of the 120
[6:17] disciples that were in the upper room
[6:19] according to acts chapter 2 verses 1
[6:21] through 4
[6:23] and they were all filled with the holy
[6:24] ghost and began to speak with other
[6:26] tongues as the spirit gave them
[6:28] utterance
[6:29] a second example is that of the italian
[6:31] centurion named cornelius in acts
[6:34] chapter 10.
[6:35] like peter we don't have the exact
[6:37] moment of his justification but we are
[6:39] told of it in acts chapter 10 verses 36
[6:42] and 37
[6:44] the word that jesus was israel's messiah
[6:46] was published and declared to cornelius
[6:49] and he believed
[6:51] the word which god sent unto the
[6:52] children of israel preaching peace by
[6:55] jesus christ he is lord of all
[6:58] that word i say ye know which was
[7:00] published throughout all judea and began
[7:03] from galilee after the baptism which
[7:06] john preached
[7:07] from the moments after cornelius first
[7:09] believed he no doubt entered into the
[7:11] second work of grace sanctification
[7:17] during this work we are told he learned
[7:19] to pray faithfully give alms in secret
[7:21] and also fast in secret as well
[7:24] according to acts chapter 10 verses 4
[7:26] and verse 30. the third work of grace
[7:28] that took place for cornelius and all
[7:31] those that heard peter's preaching was
[7:32] in acts chapter 10 verse 44 when the
[7:35] holy ghost fell and filled the souls of
[7:37] those that heard and believed his
[7:39] preaching a third example is in the
[7:41] lives of the twelve ephesian church
[7:43] members of acts chapters 18 and 19.
[7:47] acts 18 verses 24 through 28 show the
[7:50] justification of the ephesian believers
[7:52] as the preaching of apollos mightily
[7:55] convinced them to believe that jesus was
[7:57] the christ
[7:59] after those moments of first believing
[8:01] the ephesians then entered
[8:02] sanctification the second work of grace
[8:06] the third and final work of grace took
[8:08] place in acts chapter 19 verses 1 1-7
[8:12] saint paul came to their church and
[8:14] found that the ephesians had not even
[8:16] heard of the baptism of the holy ghost
[8:18] or the third work of grace
[8:21] so paul re-baptized them in the name of
[8:23] the lord jesus and prayed for them to
[8:25] receive the holy ghost the holy ghost
[8:28] then fell and came upon them and they
[8:30] spoke with tongues and prophesied
[8:41] we pray this teaching on the three works
[8:43] of grace has thoroughly proved that god
[8:46] uses these three works to fully dwell
[8:48] and fill the soul of the christian
[8:51] please know also that even after the
[8:53] third work of grace is complete the
[8:56] baptism of the holy ghost god's love
[8:58] will continue the work of continual
[9:00] sanctification through the entire life
[9:02] of each christian as saint paul taught
[9:05] in 1st thessalonians chapter 5 verse 23
[9:09] jesus himself experienced this continual
[9:12] lifelong sanctification as well as the
[9:14] bible teaches the holy ghost abode in
[9:17] him and remained in him after the river
[9:20] jordan as we noted earlier from john
[9:22] chapter 1 verse 32 and 33
[9:26] but we find jesus praying for more
[9:28] sanctification well after this towards
[9:30] the end of his earthly ministry hours
[9:33] before he would bear the cross of
[9:35] calvary
[9:37] john 17 verse 19
[9:39] and for their sakes i sanctify myself
[9:42] that they also might be sanctified
[9:44] through the truth
[9:45] we also want to recommend an order of
[9:48] viewing the teaching videos on our
[9:50] website as it may help you much in your
[9:52] christian experience
[9:54] we suggest that you watch the following
[9:56] videos before the others
[9:58] first we recommend you starting with the
[10:01] true repentance video series because a
[10:04] christian must be sure they started
[10:06] their walk with god correctly
[10:08] the christians should start with a
[10:10] sincere repentant heart
[10:12] if not their entire walk with god may be
[10:15] in vain if they denounce the faith at
[10:17] some point like judas iscariot the son
[10:20] of perdition
[10:21] second we recommend viewing water
[10:23] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[10:25] christ
[10:26] immediately after someone believes they
[10:28] should be baptized or totally immersed
[10:30] in water calling upon the name of the
[10:32] lord jesus christ
[10:34] the title's father son holy ghost should
[10:37] not be called upon because jesus said
[10:39] there was one name not names to the
[10:42] father son holy ghost
[10:47] and the five baptisms in the book of
[10:49] acts prove what is that one name the
[10:52] lord jesus christ
[11:00] we believe these two foundational videos
[11:02] will help you start right with god
[11:05] if your foundation is sure if your house
[11:08] or tabernacle is built upon a rock of
[11:10] truth
[11:11] then you can stand straight and tall
[11:13] overcoming all attacks of the devil
[11:15] through the grace of our lord jesus
[11:17] christ
[11:19] if you would like more bible scriptures
[11:21] about the three works of grace god uses
[11:24] to fully dwell inside a believer's soul
[11:26] please contact us
[11:28] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[11:31] the desire of your heart
[11:50] you
