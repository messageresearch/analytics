TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] as we begin part two please be sure to listen to part one of this series on marriage and divorce so you can understand the Bible definitions of important terminology that pertains to marriage and divorce remarriage and divorce the perfect will of God is for one man to marry one woman and be faithful to one another until death according to Matthew 19:6 and Romans 7 verse 2 the Bible teaches that married couples are bound to one another until death and are not free to marry anyone else while their first spouse is living all those who do so are committing adultery and without repentance will not inherit the kingdom of God according to 1st Corinthians 6 9 through 11 remarriage is only allowed in two cases the first case is that a widow or widower may remain another believer who does not have a living spouse this is because a widower is no longer bound to their previous spouse because that spouse has died and they're free to marry again but only in the Lord or only another Christian first Corinthians 7 verse 39 the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the Lord Romans 7 verse 1 no you're not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband sir lamb as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while husband liveth she be married to another man she should be called no doctorís but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man the second case for remarriage is that a man only not a woman according to Jesus may put away his wife in divorce and marry another if she did not confess any fornications she committed before they were married according to Matthew 5:32 and Matthew chapter 1 verses 18 through 21 because the revolving gage 'men to dis artisty as clearly seen through the Bible example of Joseph's potential divorce or putting away from Mary as at one point he believed she had committed fornication but we know God revealed the immaculate conception to Joseph before he put her away here is what Jesus taught in Matthew 5 verse 32 but I'm saying to you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery so I repeat Jesus and Saint Paul taught that divorce and remarriage with a living spouse is only allowed in this one and only case unconfessed fornication before marriage some may question why Jesus said only a man marry marry for fornication and the answer is simple the woman Eve was the cause of all sin in the human race because she was first deceived by the serpent and then commanded to be under complete obedience to her husband because she was the one who initially fell into sin god forbid surgery mode with a living husband as well as God even forbidding women to preach the gospel according to 1st Timothy 2 verses 11 through 15 the only way a woman can remarry second or more time is if her first husband has died which loses her from the law of her husband God has displayed this pattern all through our Bible history such as in the days of Abraham David and Solomon the man could have multiple lives but the woman could not have multiple husbands all due to the fact that Eve was deceived in the beginning by the serpent and death entered the human race through her being deceived you must know that God allowed polygamy in the Old Testament even though it was not his perfect will but today in the New Testament God does not allow polygamy according to the teachings of Jesus Christ in Matthew chapter 19 verses 1 to 12 Matthew chapter 5 verses 31 to 32 mark chapter 10 verses 1 to 12 and Luke 16 verse 18 our Lord Jesus taught we New Testament believers are to go back to the beginning with one man being fully committed to only one woman adultery and separations concerning adultery contrary to popular opinion in many churches adapter II when one spouse has a sexual relationship with anyone else who is not their spouse is not an acceptable cause for divorce and remarriage this is true because there are no New Testament Bible examples of any believer being allowed to remarry because their spouse committed adultery on them adultery does not lose someone from the law of their marriage vow if adultery takes place in a marriage the couple must seek forgiveness and remain together for if they separate and marry anyone else they have committed adultery if a doctor one spouse once the divorce and does so and remarries another the remarried spouse would be living in adultery but the divorce spouse must remain single or else he or she will be an adulterer as well this is the hard truth but Jesus specifically said fornication not adultery is the only cause for divorce and remarriage many churches have in st. paul's words in first corinthians 7 verse 15 which state but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases but God have called us to peace this scripture cannot contradict what st. Paul wrote in verses 10 and 11 because those verses already gave the only two options for couples who divorce or separate they must either remain unmarried or be reconciled notice that after verse 15 st. Paul rather instructs the believing spouse to remarry anyone else and that is because a spouse who is diverse or separated cannot marry anyone else according to the Word of God the true interpretation of verse 15 is that a believing spouse who has an unbelieving spouse who divorces or leaves them is not to be under bondage or slavery to continue to meet that person's needs for example if an unbelieving man leaves his believing wife the wife is not to remain a slave to the man and try to go to his new house and continue to cook his meals clean his house or serve Him in any other way because he left her she is not bound to meet his needs any more if he divorced her but she cannot remarry another spouse because st. Paul gave her two options in verses 10 and 11 she must either remain unmarried or wait and see if she can be reconciled to her first husband who has left her she is third bound to the law of her husband according to st. Paul's words in Romans 7 verses one through three concerning separation a married couple can separate or divorce for sound reasons other than fornication and adultery but their only options are to remain separated or reunite according to 1st Corinthians 7 verse 11 couple who separates in their divorces and then remarries any other person other than their first spouse is living in adultery and must repent or they cannot inherit the kingdom of God according to 1st Corinthians 6 verses 9 and 11 and Galatians 5 verses 19 through 21 the will of God for your marriage some of our viewers may be wondering what the will of God is for their current marriage situation as the Bible teachings that have heard in this video series have probably enlightened them to truth on marriage and divorce here is our sincere plentiful and godly advice for our viewers first if you find yourself in the perfect will of God meaning God is pleased with your full and complete obedience to God's Word in regards to your marriage relationship stay happily in your current state and seek not to be loosed from your spouse and children second if you find yourself in the permissive will of God meaning God is not pleased with your disobedience probably fornication or adultery and God has allowed you in your own free will to disobey His Word despite his desire for you to walk in obedience recognize first if you are or are not a follower of God's endtime message sent through his prophet William Branham if you are not a fire of God's message given to William Branham though we encourage you to see godly counsel from your pastor before making any marriage decision if you are living in fornication or before you make any family altering decision if you're an adulterer we pray that your first seek to remain in your current marriage and family situation for God hates divorce and is deeply grieved when children are left motherless or fatherless if you're a father of God's endtime message sent from william branham that we encourage you to contact your pastor and seek his Bible based wisdom on the will of God for your marriage and seek not to be loosed from your spouse and children we want to close by remembering the notable and inspired words of brother William Branham that he spoke by permission from God to the followers of his message who were caught in the permissive will of God bill in their second or third marriages yet having living divorced spouses from their first or second marriages God told his prophet William Branham that those caught in adultery second or third marriages were given permission by God to remain in the current marriages and not to break up their homes and families and to go on serving God God commanded them to never divorce and remarry ever again and he told those parents to teach their children to never live in adultery never divorce a spouse and then remain another spouse for that would be teaching their children to commit adultery now I'm speaking to our followers only who's following me and this message only not the outside bury me record this before God just to this group only now you believe this to be true and believe it to come from God and by the vindication of his cloud and his messages brought me this far should not God up on a mountain permit me to do the same thing to suffer you to go on the way you are and do it no more so is your riser limousine for the hour is late the coming of the Lord is at hand we haven't got time to break these things up don't you dare try to do it again I'm speaking only to my congregation but if you are married and God bore me witness of that on the mountain I could say this a supernatural revelation to call to the opening of the seven seals and this is a question you not word let they want and as they are and single horn so under the modern condition I command you to go to your home with your wife now if you are happy with her live with her raise your children in the emanation of God but God be merciful to you if you ever do that again you teach your children to never do a thing like that bring it up in the emanation club and now that you are as your let us go now to late evening hour that we're knitting and press towards the mark of the high calling inside for all these of the impossible if you like more bible scriptures and quotations about marriage and divorce please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
