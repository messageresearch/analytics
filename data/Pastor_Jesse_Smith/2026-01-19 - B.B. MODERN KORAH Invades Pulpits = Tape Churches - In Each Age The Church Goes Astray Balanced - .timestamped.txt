[0:03] And they say the gifted ministry of
[0:04] Ephesians 4:10-13
[0:07] that God gave the church has failed. So
[0:10] they are taking over. Here we are right
[0:12] in the midst of the fulfillment of
[0:14] prophecy called the gains of Kora and
[0:17] they don't even know that they have
[0:19] fulfilled it.
[0:21] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:23] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:26] this video is to show the tape boys
[0:28] favorite church age book quote that they
[0:32] like to twist and misconstrue and then
[0:35] show how if taken into context along
[0:37] with other quotes from the church age
[0:39] book about the five-fold ministry
[0:42] actually proves they are the core
[0:44] movement of this day. Recently, this
[0:47] thought came to me as I've been reading
[0:48] through the church age book another
[0:50] time. And I've honestly felt as I've
[0:52] read through the church age book that
[0:53] the church age book is a complete
[0:56] repudiation of the false doctrines
[0:58] coming out of the current brand of
[0:59] tabernacle leadership. And that's
[1:01] because the church age book is a
[1:03] complete repudiation of the antichrist
[1:05] spirit which starts out as deeds of
[1:08] nicicoatans
[1:09] and then turns to doctrine of
[1:11] nicicoatans and the doctrine of balum
[1:14] and then finally the Jezebel spirit. So
[1:16] our biblical foundation is Ephesians
[1:19] 4:es 8-16
[1:22] that establish the five-fold ministry of
[1:25] living men preaching the living word.
[1:27] Not dead men preaching the word, but
[1:29] living men preaching the living word of
[1:31] God. And it will be in place according
[1:34] to Paul until we all come in the unity
[1:36] of the faith. That's still happening.
[1:38] This message is still going around the
[1:39] world, converting souls, saving souls,
[1:42] filling souls with the Holy Ghost. So
[1:45] the Holy Ghost is still bringing unity
[1:46] to the body of Christ around the world.
[1:49] And brother Bram said, "We are to preach
[1:51] until Jesus returns." As a recent video
[1:54] showed, by the grace of God, the Bible,
[1:56] and brother Bram never said, preachers
[1:58] are going to sit down and just press
[2:00] play at the end time. There's no Bible
[2:02] verse that says that, but thank God, the
[2:04] Bible says, "The five-fold ministry will
[2:06] bring the bride to the unity of the
[2:08] faith and the fullness of the stature of
[2:10] the measure of Jesus Christ." So, let's
[2:13] read the first quote that the tape boys
[2:16] love so much that they even sing about
[2:18] it as I put in a video and I'll leave a
[2:20] link to that in the description as well.
[2:22] In the video from Brandom Tabernacle,
[2:24] someone sings a song special and uses
[2:26] this line from the church age book to
[2:28] condemn the five-fold ministry and the
[2:30] leadership of Brandom Tabernacle is
[2:32] they're clapping, singing, and going
[2:33] along with it. Sadly, we should have
[2:36] pity on them as brother Brandham says in
[2:38] the church age book. So we must always
[2:41] have our filter on in this deceiving
[2:45] day. For in every age the leoty and the
[2:51] clergy goes astray.
[2:54] So Ephesians 4 is not enough to bring
[2:58] this bride in shape. But the voice of
[3:02] the chief shepherd is on tape.
[3:07] And that's why we persuade and obey
[3:11] for.
[3:19] But here's the two sentences that they
[3:21] like to misconstrue. It's from page 252
[3:24] in the old blue church age book. Nor is
[3:27] it even enough that we see the five-fold
[3:30] ministry of Ephesians 4, apostles,
[3:32] prophets, teachers, evangelists,
[3:33] pastors. For in each age the church goes
[3:36] astray and is not just the leoty but the
[3:38] clergy group. Shepherds are wrong as
[3:41] well as sheep. End quote.
[3:44] &gt;&gt; For in every age the leoty and the
[3:48] clergy goes astray.
[3:51] &gt;&gt; So tape boys will take this simple
[3:54] phrase for in each age the church goes
[3:56] astray and they will use that to say
[3:58] that no one should preach anymore
[4:00] because the preachers have all gone
[4:01] astray. So sad. So ridiculous. Such an
[4:05] antichrist statement to lump all the
[4:08] preachers as going astray. And yet the
[4:12] word of God doesn't teach that. Brother
[4:13] Brandham never taught that every single
[4:15] preacher will go astray and the
[4:17] preachers should just sit down and press
[4:19] play. That's a lie. That's heresy.
[4:21] That's nonsense. That's a false
[4:23] doctrine. Now, let's read the full
[4:25] context of the quote here. Let's go up a
[4:28] few sentences earlier. Thus, when we see
[4:30] that the messengers are in his hand, we
[4:32] see the Lord identifying himself with
[4:34] these men and granting them his power.
[4:37] It is not enough that he has associated
[4:39] himself with the whole church, which we
[4:41] saw when he was seen standing amongst
[4:43] the seven golden candlesticks. Nor is it
[4:46] even enough that we see the five-fold
[4:48] ministry of Ephesians 4, apostles,
[4:50] prophets, teachers, evangelists,
[4:51] pastors. For in each age the church goes
[4:54] astray and is not just the leoty but the
[4:56] clergy group shepherds are wrong as well
[4:58] as sheep. Now I'm going to pause right
[5:01] there. So brother Ram sets it up as in
[5:03] every age the church goes astray. That's
[5:05] true. And he's connecting that with the
[5:07] seven church age messengers. Now notice
[5:09] the next sentence gives the full
[5:12] context. So let's read that quote. Then
[5:15] God brings himself on the scene as the
[5:18] chief shepherd in the ministries of
[5:19] these seven men to lead his people back
[5:22] to the truth and the abundant power of
[5:24] that truth. End quote. So we see an
[5:27] order that brother Brandham gave in this
[5:29] quote. First the church goes astray,
[5:31] then God sends the messenger. So let's
[5:35] apply that to brother Brandham's day.
[5:37] The Pentecostals went astray. So what
[5:38] did God do? God sent a messenger named
[5:40] William Brandham to bring the church
[5:43] back to the truth and the abundant power
[5:45] of the truth. So Brandham Tabernacle has
[5:48] completely misconstrued this quote. This
[5:51] quote actually proves that we as the
[5:54] true bride of Jesus Christ with the
[5:56] five-fold ministry are restored back to
[5:58] the truth because we have the apostolic
[6:00] truth and the power of the Holy Ghost.
[6:03] So this proves tape boys are not
[6:05] preachers. They have no gift to rightly
[6:07] divide the word of truth. They can't
[6:08] even understand one paragraph. If they
[6:11] can't understand one paragraph of the
[6:13] church age book, how are they going to
[6:14] understand one sentence in the Bible?
[6:16] They're not going to. And their fruits
[6:18] have proven that they're corrupt fruits.
[6:21] Now, also on top of that, you have the
[6:23] scripture that says, "God never leaves
[6:24] himself without a witness." Acts 14:17,
[6:27] "Nevertheless, he left not himself
[6:29] without a witness." So, this Bible verse
[6:32] proves Brennham Tabernacle is
[6:33] misinterpreting this church age. a quote
[6:36] random tabernacle saying God has no
[6:38] witnesses that are preachers. So that's
[6:40] why we just press play and obey. But
[6:43] that's a lie. God never leaves himself
[6:45] without a witness. There's 10 times
[6:47] brother Ram said always had a witness.
[6:50] You can look it up. Brother Ram says
[6:52] this 10 times God always has a witness.
[6:56] That means someone has been faithful.
[6:57] Not everyone has gone astray. There's
[6:59] someone who's faithful in every age at
[7:02] all times and all seasons of that church
[7:04] age.
[7:05] There's 10 quotes on this again, but I'm
[7:07] going to read just one where brother Ram
[7:08] says, "There's many hundreds of
[7:10] witnesses alive in 1950."
[7:13] Quote, "God has never left himself
[7:15] without a testimony. There's always been
[7:16] somebody somewhere that God could put
[7:18] his hand and say, "Here's my servant.
[7:21] He's always, it's gotten down to
[7:22] sometimes just about one left, but God
[7:24] has always had a witness." You believe
[7:26] that, don't you, Noah? and and down many
[7:29] times through his prophets and so forth,
[7:30] but he's never left himself without an
[7:32] earthly witness that he could work
[7:34] through, speak through, who would go out
[7:36] in the midst of criticism and declare
[7:38] him. That's right. And I'm thankful that
[7:39] he's got many, many hundreds of servants
[7:42] now he can work through just before the
[7:44] coming. End quote. Beautiful, powerful
[7:47] quote here from God's prophet, Brother
[7:48] Brandham. Notice he doesn't even make
[7:50] himself the only witness. He says
[7:52] there's many, many hundreds of witnesses
[7:56] Jesus Christ still has on the earth. And
[7:58] that's true. So that must be true today
[7:59] as well because according to the church
[8:01] age book quote, now we have the truth
[8:04] and the abundant power of the truth
[8:06] because the messengers already came. And
[8:08] that lines up with Ephesians 4:es 8-16
[8:12] on the purpose and ministry of the
[8:14] five-fold ministry. So now let's see
[8:16] what else did brother Ram say about the
[8:18] five-fold ministry in the church age
[8:20] book. I would like the tape boys to know
[8:22] this. So if you go to page 129 in the
[8:25] old blue book, brother Ram said, quote,
[8:27] "If you don't think this is true, just
[8:29] listen to this. All over the world in
[8:30] both Pentecostal and fundamental groups,
[8:32] they are organizing the businessmen.
[8:34] They have invaded the pulpit without a
[8:36] call from God. They have styled
[8:38] themselves as the fishers of men and the
[8:40] founders of a move of God. And they say
[8:42] the gifted ministry of Ephesians 4 10
[8:45] through13 that God gave the church has
[8:47] failed. So they are taking over." End
[8:49] quote. Friends, who is saying the
[8:51] five-fold ministry has failed? It's the
[8:53] Brandham Tabernacle. It's the Tate Boys.
[8:56] And they even sing songs about it.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; For in every age, the leoty and the
[9:03] clergy goes astray.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; Who's the one that says preachers have
[9:07] to catch the vision? They have to play
[9:09] the tapes and sit down and just press
[9:11] play. That's Joseph Brandom.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; But they got to catch the vision. You
[9:16] got to play the tapes. They're the
[9:19] token.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; Who is saying the five-fold ministries
[9:24] failed? It's the current Brandham
[9:26] tabernacle. Let's keep reading. Quote,
[9:28] "Here we are right in the midst of the
[9:30] fulfillment of prophecy called the gang
[9:32] sayings of Kora, and they don't even
[9:35] know that they have fulfilled it.
[9:36] They're blindly going on preaching
[9:38] experience for truth." End quote. So,
[9:40] brother Ram says, "Whoever says the
[9:42] five-fold ministries failed, are the
[9:44] modern-day Kora." The gang sayings,
[9:46] which means opposition or rebellion of
[9:49] Kora, Core rebelled against Moses and
[9:52] Aaron. Not just Moses, but Aaron as
[9:54] well. Brother Brandham is represented by
[9:56] Moses. Aaron represents the five-fold
[9:59] ministry because Aaron had five sons and
[10:01] that represents the five-fold ministry.
[10:03] So according to brother Brandham,
[10:04] whoever says the five-fold ministries
[10:06] failed and invades the pulpit, in this
[10:08] case with tape players is the modern-day
[10:11] Kora that fulfills Jude 1:1. Woe unto
[10:14] them for they've gone in the way of Cain
[10:16] and ran greedily after the heir of Balum
[10:18] for reward and perish in the gang saying
[10:20] of Kora. So brother Ram says this
[10:23] prophecy means someone is telling others
[10:26] that the five-fold ministry has failed.
[10:28] That could only be Brandham tabernacle.
[10:30] And which church is one of the richest
[10:31] churches in the world in the message?
[10:33] Brennan tabernacle. So the Bible calls
[10:35] it greedily after the heir of Balum and
[10:39] Kora. The rebellion of Kora. And again,
[10:43] that's not me saying that. That's
[10:44] brother Brandham saying that in the
[10:45] church age book. If you don't think this
[10:47] is true, just listen to this. All over
[10:50] the world in both Pentecostal and
[10:52] fundamental groups, they are organizing
[10:54] the businessmen. They have invaded the
[10:56] pulpit without a call from God. They
[10:59] have styled themselves the fishers of
[11:01] men and the founders of a move of God.
[11:03] And they say the gifted ministry of
[11:05] Ephesians 4:10-13.
[11:08] But God gave the church has failed. So
[11:10] they are taking over. Here we are right
[11:13] in the midst of the fulfillment of
[11:15] prophecy called the gain sayings of
[11:17] Kora. And they don't even know that they
[11:19] have fulfilled it. They are blindly
[11:22] going on preaching experience for truth.
[11:25] May God have pity on them. May their
[11:27] eyes be opened before it is too late.
[11:30] Oh, listen to me. When did the prestige
[11:33] of money, social leadership, business
[11:35] ability, or sheer mental prowess ever
[11:37] qualify a man for spiritual leadership,
[11:40] or give any weight to the word of God.
[11:43] And when in any way materiality or human
[11:46] values begin to show as the media by
[11:48] which God works instead of the Holy
[11:49] Spirit alone, then we are fighting
[11:52] against God, not for him.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Let's continue reading. quote, "May God
[11:56] have pity on them. May their eyes be
[11:58] open before it's too late. Oh, listen to
[12:00] me." End quote. So again, we want to
[12:02] pray at the end of this video uh that
[12:04] God will have pity on these people who
[12:06] say the five-fold ministries failed and
[12:07] the ones who are invading the pulpits
[12:09] with their tape players. Let's keep
[12:12] reading. Quote, "When did the prestige
[12:13] of money, social leadership, business
[12:15] ability, or sheer mental prowess ever
[12:18] qualify man for spiritual leadership or
[12:20] give any weight to the word of God? And
[12:22] when in any way materially or human
[12:25] values begin to show as the media by
[12:27] which God works instead of the Holy
[12:29] Spirit alone, then we are fighting
[12:31] against God, not for him. End quote. So
[12:34] see friends, the tape church ministry is
[12:36] fighting against God, not for God.
[12:38] They're the ones saying the five-fold
[12:40] ministry has failed.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; For in every age, the leoty and the
[12:46] clergy goes astray. And no doubt Voice
[12:49] of God and Random Tabernacle put out
[12:51] great quality products. But just because
[12:54] they have the prestige of money and
[12:56] business ability doesn't mean they can
[12:58] invade the pulpit, which they have done
[13:01] and continue to do around the world by
[13:03] telling preachers to sit down and just
[13:05] press play. Let's continue on this quote
[13:08] here. Let's continue on the quote a
[13:10] little bit further down. quote, "But
[13:11] when you see a social or financial
[13:13] structure come into the church that
[13:14] divides the folks in any way, that is
[13:17] not of God." End quote. So, Brandham
[13:20] Tabernacle has divided the folks because
[13:22] they don't gather more as they see that
[13:24] day approaching. Remember, divide in any
[13:27] way. So, notice Brandom Tabernacle has
[13:29] divided them away from the five-fold
[13:30] ministry and now even divided the
[13:32] members of Brandom Tabernacle away from
[13:34] each other. Let's keep reading. quote,
[13:36] "It is another sign of the time in this
[13:38] physically rich but spiritually
[13:40] impoverished Leodysian age which we are
[13:42] now living." End quote. We'll skip down
[13:45] a little further here. Quote, "Yes, it
[13:47] is the rich, powerful organization that
[13:49] has the wealth and always pushes out the
[13:51] little people that serve God." End
[13:53] quote. So, which organization is rich
[13:55] and powerful? It's Brandham Tabernacle.
[13:57] And see how they're always pushing out
[13:59] the little preachers that serve God?
[14:02] I've seen it of course when I went to
[14:03] South America and it continues to go
[14:05] around the world. Voice of God and other
[14:08] tape boys will come into little churches
[14:10] and convince the pastor just to sit down
[14:12] and press play. And that's what brother
[14:14] Brandham said the antichrist spirit is
[14:16] doing. Brother Ram says, quote, "The
[14:18] little flock always loses out to the big
[14:21] organization." End quote. That's true.
[14:24] Some little flocks might lose out, but
[14:26] the true little flock, the true bride of
[14:27] Jesus Christ will not lose out. They'll
[14:29] stay with the word of God because they
[14:31] have the restored word and the restored
[14:33] power of the Holy Ghost. Let's look at a
[14:36] third quote now from the church age
[14:38] book. I thought it went well with this
[14:40] topic. This is page 125 in the old blue
[14:43] book. Quote, "But when the church itself
[14:45] destroyed the word of God, it was
[14:47] tantamount to premeditated murder. There
[14:50] is your hybrid religion. Wake up America
[14:52] before it's too late. When the church
[14:54] gets away from the word, it will believe
[14:56] anything. It is like Eve." End quote.
[14:59] Now, I just bring out this quote to show
[15:01] how the tape church movement is a hybrid
[15:04] religion and they will believe anything
[15:06] that their pastor says or associate
[15:08] pastor says because they've gotten away
[15:11] from the word of God many scriptures,
[15:13] not just the five-fold ministry
[15:15] scriptures in Ephesians 4. And brother
[15:17] Bram goes on to quote 2 Timothy 4:4. And
[15:19] they shall turn away their ears from the
[15:21] truth and shall be turned unto fables.
[15:24] And I mentioned this in a previous
[15:25] video, but tape boys will believe
[15:28] anything their false leadership says, no
[15:31] matter how much of a fable it is.
[15:34] Remember, there's 25 lies coming out of
[15:36] current Brandom Tabernacle. So, they'll
[15:38] believe all these 25 lies or 25 fables.
[15:41] Like the first one saying every word on
[15:43] Brother Ram's tapes are thus sayith the
[15:44] Lord. That's a fable. They say the tapes
[15:47] can never be wrong. That's a fable. They
[15:49] say the tapes have no mistakes. That's a
[15:50] fable. When brother Ram plainly said
[15:52] there are mixups on the tapes, they
[15:55] believe the fable of just unquestioning
[15:57] believe every word on the tape. Even if
[15:59] brother Brandham lied. That's according
[16:00] to Joseph Brandham, not me. He said, "I
[16:03] don't care if it's a barefaced lie.
[16:05] We're still going to believe every word
[16:06] on tape."
[16:08] &gt;&gt; What did that angel of the Lord say? Get
[16:10] the people to believe you. So when
[16:13] they're trying to make you doubt, well,
[16:14] the prophet didn't say this and didn't
[16:15] say this, and he made a mistake here,
[16:17] made a mistake here. I don't care if
[16:18] it's a barefaced lie. The world can
[16:20] prove it. I believe it. I don't care if
[16:23] it's a barefaced lie. The world can
[16:25] prove it. I believe it.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; The angel said, "Get the people believe
[16:30] WHAT YOU SAID." AMEN. We believe it.
[16:36] They believe the fable that tape boys
[16:38] are the true five-fold ministry. They
[16:40] believe the fable that brother
[16:41] Brandham's soul and spirit is identical
[16:43] to Jesus's. They believe the fable that
[16:46] brother Brandham's followers are the
[16:47] greatest of all time. They believe the
[16:49] fable that brother Brandham is the
[16:51] greatest prophet of all time and they
[16:52] don't say except for Jesus. They believe
[16:55] the fable that brother Brandham is their
[16:56] pastor even though brother Brandham's
[16:58] dead and said he won't always be their
[17:00] pastor. They believe the fable that they
[17:02] can sit at home and deny Hebrews 10:24
[17:05] and 25 about gathering more physically
[17:07] as we see that day approaching. And
[17:09] those are just a few of the fables
[17:10] they'll believe. But notice once they
[17:12] get away from one scripture, they'll
[17:14] believe anything. They'll believe all
[17:16] these lies or fables. Let's do a fourth
[17:18] and final quote here from the church age
[17:20] book. It's just a simple principle here
[17:23] that woe to the man that declares an
[17:26] evidence that is not found in the word
[17:27] of God. Brother Ram's talking about how
[17:28] speaking in tongues is the evidence is
[17:30] not in the word. He says quote once more
[17:33] we're anxious to know where this is
[17:34] found in the word. If it isn't there
[17:36] then God has not spoken it and woe unto
[17:38] him who would add to that word. End
[17:40] quote. Remember Brandon Tabernacle says
[17:43] the tapes are the token. In other words,
[17:45] they're saying the tapes are the
[17:47] evidence of the Holy Ghost. They also
[17:48] say going to a tape church is the
[17:50] evidence of the Holy Ghost, which is a
[17:52] lie. Those are both lies. The token is
[17:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[17:55] soul. It's the seal unto the day of
[17:58] redemption, as Hebrews 4:30 plainly
[18:00] teaches. And brother Ram taught
[18:01] repeatedly and faithfully throughout his
[18:03] entire ministry. So notice again,
[18:05] brother Ram says, "Woe to any man who
[18:06] makes an evidence other than what the
[18:08] Bible says." So that's what Brandham
[18:10] tabernacle has done. So woe unto them.
[18:12] They make a false evidence of the token.
[18:15] And again, where are all those fables
[18:17] found in the word of God? They're not
[18:19] found in the word of God. Never says
[18:21] God's going to stop having living
[18:22] preachers. It never says to sit at home
[18:24] and don't gather more as we see that day
[18:26] approaching. It never says dead men can
[18:28] be your living pastors on the earth. It
[18:30] never says brother Random is the angel
[18:32] of Revelation 22 because brother Ram
[18:34] teaches us there's no pre-existence of
[18:36] souls. So, brother Ram did not pre-exist
[18:38] in order to reveal the book of
[18:40] Revelation to St. John. That's a fable.
[18:42] That's a lie. So, we thank God for the
[18:45] truth in the church age book and again
[18:47] see plainly how Brennham Tabernacle has
[18:49] misconstrued it, twisted it to their own
[18:51] shame. In closing, friends, I hope this
[18:54] video was a blessing by the grace of
[18:55] God. This thought was quickened to me a
[18:56] few weeks ago and this morning after
[18:58] prayer and reading the Bible and the
[19:00] church age book, I thought I'd make a
[19:02] video on this. Hopefully, it strengthens
[19:04] the people's faith in the word of God.
[19:06] The church age book again is brother
[19:07] Ram's teaching and commentary. He called
[19:09] it his commentary on the church age
[19:11] book. And that points us back to the
[19:12] Bible. Let's not be the core group
[19:14] saying the five-fold ministry failed.
[19:16] Let's be the group that's with Moses and
[19:19] Aaron. Hallelujah. In type. Let's be
[19:21] with brother Brandham and the five-fold
[19:23] ministry. The way we know we are is if
[19:25] we obey the word of God rather than
[19:28] rebelling against the word of God. As
[19:30] brother Brandham said, this is very
[19:31] simple. Give everyone the word test. We
[19:34] must give Brennham Tabernacle, the
[19:36] current Brennham Tabernacle, the word
[19:37] test. And when we do, they fail the word
[19:40] test every time. Give
[19:42] &gt;&gt; it the word test.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; That's way to tell where it's right or
[19:46] wrong.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; That's just just give it the word test.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; See what it says about the word. Any
[19:53] spirit, see what it says about the word.
[19:56] If it denies the word, it's not of God.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; No matter what it is, if it denies the
[20:01] word, it's not of God.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Look, give it the word test and see what
[20:04] happens.
[20:06] But that shouldn't surprise any true
[20:08] believer because they're businessmen.
[20:10] They're not preachers. If they were
[20:11] preachers, they would preach. They'd
[20:12] rightly divide the word of truth. So, as
[20:14] time goes on, friends, we see the
[20:16] evidence of the Holy Ghost. It's
[20:17] receiving the word of God for your day,
[20:19] being in the word all the way. Like
[20:22] brother Ram said in the church age book,
[20:23] it's another quote I don't have right in
[20:25] front of me, but he says, he said, they
[20:26] substitute experience instead of the
[20:28] word. So, see, they have these
[20:30] experiences. says, "Oh, I listen to all
[20:31] these tapes at home and I'm getting so
[20:33] close to God, yet they're denying all
[20:35] these scriptures." That's a lie. We're
[20:37] not taking experience over the word of
[20:39] God. The word of God is the absolute.
[20:41] The word of God will produce the right
[20:42] experience, an experience of obedience,
[20:45] an experience of holiness,
[20:47] righteousness, a pleasing testimony in
[20:49] the sight of God. So, we're thankful for
[20:51] that, friends. Please share this video
[20:53] with someone you know that might
[20:54] struggle with this topic. And we believe
[20:57] the Holy Ghost will guide the believers
[20:58] into all truth. When the spirit of truth
[21:01] has come, as Jesus said, he will teach
[21:02] you all things and guide you into all
[21:04] truth. That's the evidence of being a
[21:06] true holy ghostfilled believer. You can
[21:08] be taught the word of God by the spirit
[21:10] of God. For the spirit and the word of
[21:12] God are one. So, let's close with a
[21:15] prayer for current Brandham tabernacle.
[21:18] Dear God, I pray for the current
[21:19] Brennham tabernacle leadership. God, may
[21:21] they take warning from this if they see
[21:23] it. Lord God, we can see they have a
[21:25] cult mentality. They don't listen to
[21:27] anyone else except their pastor and the
[21:29] tapes, which means they won't accept
[21:32] correction. So Lord, I just pray their
[21:33] hearts would open. If they have true
[21:36] hearts, if they're hungry and thirsting
[21:37] for righteousness, they'll have a heart
[21:40] to hear this. And not just from me, but
[21:42] from anyone else who will speak the
[21:43] truth to them in love. Lord, you know
[21:45] this is done in love and brotherly
[21:47] kindness also as a warning. The Bible
[21:50] said them that sin, rebuke before all.
[21:52] And Lord Jesus, if you anointed Brother
[21:54] Brennham to warn those people out in
[21:56] Arizona in 1964 about their cult
[21:59] tendencies, Lord, you're the same
[22:01] yesterday, today, and forever. You'll
[22:03] anoint people to do it today. So God, be
[22:05] magnified, be glorified. We pray for
[22:07] repentance for this generation of the
[22:08] brand tabernacle. And Lord, we pray for
[22:11] a Hezekiahike revival where they'll open
[22:13] the church doors and let real preachers
[22:15] in to preach the gospel. Lord, let thy
[22:18] will be done on earth as it is in heaven
[22:21] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[22:24] If you have any questions, concerns or
[22:26] testimonies about this video, please
[22:27] contact me.
[22:29] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[22:31] the desire of your heart.
[22:36] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[22:38] again in a defense of the gospel of
[22:40] Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings,
[22:44] the good news that Jesus raised from the
[22:46] dead, living among man today, his
[22:48] church. The same Jesus that was
[22:51] yesterday will be today and forever.
[22:54] He never failed.
