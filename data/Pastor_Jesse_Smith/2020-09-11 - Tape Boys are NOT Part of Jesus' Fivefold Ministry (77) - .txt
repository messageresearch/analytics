TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to define jesus's true five full ministry and show how tape boys who do not preach themselves are not part of the fivefold ministry paul established in ephesians 4 verses 7 to 16 through the revelation jesus christ gave him according to galatians 1 verse 12. again i want to thank the lord jesus christ for being my lord and savior and that he baptized me with the holy ghost in june of 2003 and i believe god's prophet to the end time was brother william marion branham as many of my videos fully express here's the outline for this video we'll begin by correcting the tape boy false teaching from jeffersonville then we'll look at brother branham quotes about the five full ministry third we'll look at bible truth regarding rahab and the two spies to correct jeffersonville's false teachings and lastly we'll look at bible truth pertaining to revelation chapter 22 verse 16. correcting the tape boy false teaching from jeffersonville leadership leadership in jeffersonville erroneously believes and i quote the correct way for the five-fold his joshua's messengers tape boys were what the five full ministry that fivefold ministry went in there being told what to do so that's the fivefold ministry what did the true fivefold ministry preach then they played her rahab a tape that's what the fivefold ministry is supposed to do end quote please observe two false doctrines from this quote first tape boys are the true fivefold ministry or the correct way for the fivefold ministry to operate and second the true fivefold ministry is supposed to play tapes instead of preaching themselves friends jeffersonville is wrong to redefine the fivefold ministry because they are adding and taking away from the word of god the tate church movement adds tape boys men who try to start new churches by playing audio sermons of william branham but they themselves do not preach into the fivefold ministry which takes away or deletes or redefines pastors evangelists teachers apostles and prophets who preach the gospel of jesus christ here's the truth about jeffersonville's two false doctrines first tape boys are not the true fivefold ministry as the bible and brother branham never say those words and second the true fivefold ministry preaches themselves rather than playing tapes beginning with bible facts the fivefold ministry of ephesians 4 verses 7 to 16 are preachers apostle prophet evangelist pastor and teacher romans chapter 10 verses 14 and 15 define a preacher as one who publishes and proclaims something that has been done preachers use their own voice not someone else's also preachers have feet according to romans 10 verse 15 how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things tape boys fail in these two requirements they do not use their own voice and a tape player or phone or tablet that is preaching through mp3 files does not have feet the bible teaches five full ministers are living preachers for the feet of dead preachers are in the grave and cannot bring good news the bible mandate is for living men to preach god's living word commissioned by jesus christ himself in matthew chapter 28 verses 19 and 20 mark 16 verse 15 and ephesians 4 verses 7 to 16. mark 16 15 says and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature in context jesus was not asking dead men to go and preach but living men and jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever living preachers are anointed with the holy ghost who preach with their own voices and do not sit down and press play notice romans 10 verse 15 saying they preach and not him or one person not one man it's a group romans 10 15 and how shall they preach except they be sent philip the evangelist is a sound example for he was a living man using his own voice to preach and had one of the five preaching gifts acts 8 5 and acts 21 verse 8 say philip preached christ and he was an evangelist jesus anoints the preachers in the true fivefold ministry to do five works as he anoints their voices to preach and declare his good news first for the perfecting of the saints which is equipping second for the work of the ministry which is undertaking of the ministry third for the edifying of the body of christ which is promoting growth fourth the unity of the faith which is agreement of faith or beliefs and fifth unity the knowledge of the son of god which is unity of knowledge or precise truth and this is all done to make a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ or unto the portion of maturity in jesus christ moving on to brother branham's tape boy quotes he never said tay boys are the true fivefold ministry there are 25 tape boys quotes from brother branham and none of them say what jeffersonville leadership is saying according to god's prophet brother branham tay boys during his lifetime ran a tape business or society and were and still are a secondary ministry live preaching is the primary ministry or highest ministry in the gospel of jesus christ to get his message to his people i'm so happy to see these brethren here just a whole line of these recorders and what a work they're doing for the lord these recordings are being sent around the nation and they're going into homes and in the halls and so forth they even got us in a movie picture of the day to introduce these things and hundreds of people are being saved and healed right through these recordings aren't you happy that man's got the message on their heart maybe they're not preachers but they're trying to get the message to the people doctors they tell me and man of of great standing in the world or out trying to win souls for christ god can use these things in a secondary way like this may the lord jesus bless everyone who hears the message may they be saved and healed now i think and i say this from my heart that the greatest and highest form that there is for god to get his message to his people is for the people to believe his word that's right that's the highest form preaching the gospel is the highest form then if you notice the bible places it that way first apostles secondarily prophets and so forth then on down on down then into the nine spiritual gifts operating every local body branham tabernacle had a tape business or tape society which was a ministry of their own church but it never replaced the fivefold ministry as ormond neville pastor of branham tabernacle never played tapes on a regular basis he preached the gospel with his own voice and brother brahm loved his sermons you can listen to many of brother neville's sermons today here is the tape business quote i'm not a tape salesman and i don't stress those things we get them and we gotta take a business around the world here is the tape society quote we send them tapes free on a society of the church and they're translated and all out through the jungles of africa and the indian around the world goes these tapes here's the quote where brother branham love to hear brother neville preach and not push play i tell you the reason i'd love to hear brother neville speak not mainly because he's a good preacher but because i know that he lives what he preaches and i would rather you would live me a sermon than preach me one it'll be more effective let it be known as well that brother branham taught in the church age book the korah group of the last days made up of businessmen and not gifted preachers would say the true fivefold ministry failed and so they would invade the pulpit without a call from god sadly it seems the tape church movement is dangerously close to fulfilling this quote as the core groups if you don't think this is true just listen to this all over the world in both pentecostal and fundamental groups they are organizing the businessmen they have invaded the pulpit without a call from god they have styled themselves the fishers of men and the founders of a move of god and they say the gifted ministry of ephesians 4 10-13 but god gave the church has failed so they are taking over here we are right in the midst of the fulfillment of prophecy called the gain sayings of korra and they don't even know that they have fulfilled it they are blindly going on preaching experience for truth may god have pity on them may their eyes be opened before it is too late oh listen to me when did the prestige of money social leadership business ability or sheer mental prowess ever qualify a man for spiritual leadership or give any weight to the word of god and when in any way materiality or human values begin to show as the media by which god works instead of the holy spirit alone then we are fighting against god not for him in summary jeffersonville leadership is changing the fivefold ministry to include tape boys and so in essence jeffersonville is changing paul's revelation from jesus christ and have deviated from the word their worship services no longer match paul's god's prophet told us in the church age book chapter 3 that he would be in the word exactly as paul gave it and now the tape church movement is not teaching paul's gospel exactly as he gave it that original word could not change not even a dot or dash of it paul knew it was god who had spoken to him so he said even if i come and try to give a second revelation try to make one little change in what i gave originally let me be accursed you see paul knew that first revelation was correct god can't give a first revelation then a second revelation if he did he would be changing his mind but god's word can't change the seed came exactly as revealed hallelujah and see what those false apostles were doing they came with their own word those ephesians knew that word as paul had taught it they were full of the holy ghost by the laying on of paul's hands they looked those false apostles in the eye and said you are not saying what paul said you are therefore false oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it is not you that really tries the apostle and prophet and teacher it is the word that tries them one of these days there is going to come a prophet to the laodicean church age and you will know if he is the real one sent from god or not yes you will for if he is of god he will be in that word exactly as god gave it to paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iota i would also give a sincere sober warning to the tape church movement that is promoting less preaching by men since it seems they are slowly moving into the wrong spirit that wants to stop holy ghost-filled preachers this is because brother branham says the antichrist system will force the bride to stop preaching and teaching right before the rapture with this great power the church systems will persecute the true bride this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching etc her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it but before the antichrist in person takes over this complete world system of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the lord god will catch away his pride for the great marriage supper of the lamb second let's look at brother branham's quotes about the fivefold ministry knowing the bible is unquestionably supportive of the fivefold ministry i want to show how brother branham fully supported paul's standard of living preachers preaching live playing brother rams tapes never was and never is to replace god called living preachers if you watch my previous videos about jeffersonville related subjects you already know brother branham faithfully supported the fivefold ministry saying plainly no he's not the only one that should preach in questions and answers part three from 1964. also brother adam said we need them referring to the preachers with a call of god to preach the gospel in that same sermon now brother branham is it true that no one should preach but you we have seen your we have seen you ordained man we do don't believe you would do that if there were not that they were not to preach mercy brother sister ever who told you nobody has preached for me i surely have four subjects of gods with all that no every man or that feels a call of god upon his life get into the ministry start preaching we need him and he said don't change a thing in reference to evangelists continuing preaching on the field from questions and answers on the seals in 1963 should evangelists continue on the field in this hour of course what they mean certainly by all means don't change the thing if jesus is coming in the morning preach today like if it will be 10 years some day but live life's going to be at this hour don't don't get scrupled up now that's what i'm trying to warn you about see just don't be odd peculiar don't change the other but if you're doing something wrong or doing evil repent come back to god continue on your evangelistic service just as you always did the jeffersonville movement is not obeying these quotes listen again as brother branham tells us the most important thing we need today is a preacher who can rightly divide the word of truth now to bring up this faith in christ there's ministers that's the most important thing of the day is a good god-sent preacher i admire them and their gift is far beyond anything can be done in anything else is a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of god the most wonderful gift in the world is to be a minister sadly tape boys only point to tapes and do not rightly divide anything because they are likely anointed with a deity spirit that worships brother branham and exalts his every word to thus saith the lord tape boys cannot tell you which words from brother branham were inspired or not they can't tell you if the white horse rider is the holy spirit which brother branham said in 1960 or the antichrist spirit which brother branham said in the first seal they can't tell you if billy paul is the promised joseph as brother branham said in 1951 or if joseph is the promised joseph as brother random said in 1963 they cannot tell you if total annihilation took place to the united states before 1977 or not just to give a few simple examples so tape boys can't rightly divide the human side of brother branham from the inspired side like brother branham taught us to do and he cares do you care 1963 did you prophesy that there be a million negroes uh killed on the or did you just announce that there would be this happening now see i've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to something there's so much of it that it's just the human side but always if there is something that goes forth it will speak it it's thus saith the law even to visions or anything but the holy ghost in the soul of a true god-sent preacher as brother branham calls it can tell you the truth about the differences between the human side and the inspired side yes friends the tapes need rightly divided because brother branham also said there are mix-ups on the tapes in questions and answers part 1 1964 and he said he makes those kinds of mistakes all the time like when he said 700 that did not bow the need to bail rather than seven thousand now yes i meant forgive me please i and and brother you on the tape out there and friends listen i didn't mean to say that like that i i i'll administer the gospel i've many times i'll preach that i know that was seven thousand i just have to say seven hundred i didn't mean the seven hundred i mean you i just didn't read it out of scripture it just come to my mind while i was talking and i just said 700 instead of 7 000. i make them mistakes all the time and yet at the same time the tapes contain inspiration from the holy ghost and point us back to the absolute the bible and jesus christ here's a small sample of brother branham supporting the fivefold ministry the fightful ministry is to be in the church until jesus comes again so tape boys are not going to replace living preachers it's the same lord but he said some in the church teachers apostles prophets gifts of healing working of miracles and all those things are set in the church you believe that i never didn't stay for the be set out of the church he set him in the church or the perfecting of the church and to be in the church until he comes again the five full ministry perfects the church according to ephesians 4 verse 12. the fifo ministry is god's presence or god's dress where god's spirit working through man remember that's god brother branham said how god fortified his army what with himself in the form of prophets apostles teachers pastors what do you do what was god doing listen did you ever think what that offices of the church is it's god's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet a seer foresee before satan ever gets to it amen what is it god dressed up in his church these offices is god's stresswear when you see those officers pastors teachers advances what is that that's god's dress wear god's presence god's spirit in a working through man and if that office denies any [Applause] [Music] [Applause] recall brother branham's vision for the future from taking sides with jesus from june 1962 brother branham was grateful for living preachers and told them that they had to take his place and brother neville's place after they died young preachers got to fill our shoes brother branham said not you might want to fill our shoes or might just want to press play on the tapes brother branham never said you got to play the tapes like the jeffersonville leadership falsely claims today listen as these quotes go along with the quotes we referenced earlier about don't change a thing and we need more preachers and i'm very grateful that in these days i see it's got little satellites to it that i am grateful for brother uh crazier and his sellersburg group and brother back there that just taken brother snelling's place at utica and brother ruttle up here and brother junior jackson and those precious boys who are a fine man wonderful man of god they preached this message brother neville brother ronald brother chris and brother bieler and all you brother in here judy wherever you are the rest of you brother god richly bless you i see terry lynn charlie cox david a lot of you young man here god anoints you i would like to pick up a handful of uv evangelism and set you somewhere see knowing that you've come up you can stand and know the message and study to prove yourself you feel a call in your life i see two three young men in four or five sitting on the road back here and and like that you're a young man i'm getting old brother neville's getting old we're a middle-aged man if time rolls on we're gonna walk off the scene etc you've got to fill our shoes man and so it's seeing that maybe and that day even it'll be growing greater if there is a tomorrow your brother not to hurt your little churches and uh you want to you're doing our work god will reward you for that go out there preach do everything you can let all of you get together you bunch of men and have meetings and talk on deep things in the scripture and after listening to this next quote friends remember that ormond neville was there to keep preaching and take brother branham's place after he went off the scene one of my days is finished and i've done my best if i be god's servant god will raise him up another man in that day when i'm gone so there's nobody setting something around my theology is me to live and what white i have and wait on god for the next generation to come he'll have a man there when that generation comes up [Music] amen while nearly every quote from brother branham says perfection comes through the five full ministry one quote from questions and answers part 3 1964 seems to say it doesn't but when you examine this quote you can see how it does tales with many quotes in which brother branham says perfection comes through the fivefold ministry the quote in question comes from questions and answers part 3 1964. it's question number 355. brother branham was asked this dearly beloved about the scripture of ephesians 4 verses 11 through 13 do we all get the perfection of saints through the tapes or should we be here where the gifts of the spirit are operating and the different offices of the church to help perfect us our hearts have believed all the word of god now before i read the answer to this question a week earlier so seven days earlier brother branham said in questions and answers part 2 1964 that god set in the church before the perfecting of the saints the fivefold ministry and you can't divide it but the bride is the elected of god there is five offices elected of god for god has set in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors of angels god did that man has deacons and so forth and everything else but you see but god said in the church for the perfecting of the church so now let's listen to brother branham's answer to this question dearly love let's see about the scripture of ephesians 4 11 through 13 do we all see do we get all the perfecting of saints through the tapes or should we be here were the gifts of the spirit are operating and the different offices of the church to help perfect us our hearts have believed all the word of the lord now this person is from oregon now i know this person by letter by and so no they want to come here to the church for the perfecting see that we we get fellowship one with another here at the church but the perfecting comes between us and god the blood of christ is what perfects us in the holy spirit now in the church there's has the gifts operating so we are we have some of the gifts operating among us and we'll be very glad to fellowship with any of you that has a way that you're working or wants to come and fellowship with us anything we can do we're very happy about it see but now the perfecting belongs to christ notice he said no they want to come here to the church for the perfecting so it's plain to see from this quote this man from oregon thought he'd only get perfected by going to the branham tabernacle in jeffersonville as brother branham says they want to come here to the church for perfecting but brother branham says the blood of christ is what perfects us in the holy spirit and he says but now the perfecting belongs to christ so it's clear this man thought going to a certain church would bring perfection but brother branham makes it plain there's not a church that can perfect you it's jesus christ who can perfect you recall also how brother branham's last sermon he preached in jeffersonville at his home church was satan's eden from august 29 1965 preached on the evening after he sat down and listened to brother ormond neville preach and brother branham said he was led of the lord to sit down and listen to another preacher in the five-fold ministry notice brother branham did not tell them to just press play this morning i wanted to hear brother neville myself and i heard him many times and never heard him anytime but what i appreciate him but this morning a timely message i know i had the leading of the lord to listen to that this morning very fine and i see why you people like to come and listen to him also and he'll always do you good i'm sure to listen to him i hope you can see from all these quotes that brother branham believed the perfection came through the blood of christ working through the fivefold ministry and brother branham never had tape playing substitute the fivefold ministries live preaching third bible truth regarding rahab and the two spies jeffersonville's false doctrine about tape boys originates from their misinterpretation of a quote from brother branham in the token first preached in september of 1963. listen to this quote they misinterpret and let's examine their errors the word joshua means jehovah's savior so to jesus he's the savior and joshua when he knowed his messengers his mistress turned back said i have obeyed your orders and there was a woman we found when we played the peaceful we found a woman that believed and we told her that all that would come under that red sign back there the tolkien it would mean i preached that would you honor joshua i sent you to do it amen and then when that god honored it the house never shut down so here's the truth about this quote first brother bran was giving a hypothetical type of the messengers brother branham was not teaching doctrine in this quote as evidenced by his later quote from february of 1964 when he said some of them tape boys or somebody slipped into the place down there and played some tapes to them or something or another and found the predestinated there must have been some of them hate boys or somebody slipped into the police down there and played some tapes to them or something other than found their predestinated she took all of her house and used it for a church and received the messengers so this type of tape boys as the two spies was never spoken with thus saith the lord second in the three sermons titled the token from september 63 november 63 and february 64 brother branham never mentioned the words fivefold ministry this shows brother branham was not preaching a new doctrine about elevating tape boys into the fivefold ministry by just giving a modern hypothetical situation as to who the spies as a secondary ministry might represent today they were not priests apparently like the true preachers and teachers of their day the word tape is used nine times in these three sermons yet brother branham never said tape boys were the true fivefold ministry as jeffersonville claims so they are not saying what brother branham said third the true ministry of rahab's day was the aaronic priesthood as priests were teachers of the word according to deuteronomy 33 verses 8 through 10 second chronicles 15 3 and malachi 2 verse 7 in the literal story of rahab the two spies did not replace the aeronautic ministry as jeffersonville wants tape boys to replace live preachers but the true ministry of that day would have pointed rahab to aaron's ministry after they were saved out of the city this is true because rahab as a gentile would have had to be sprinkled with the waters of separation to even begin to enter into worship at the tabernacle of moses according to numbers chapter 19 verse 10. this shows jeffersonville is breaking the true type of scripture which is old testament priesthood represent the new testament priesthood according to first corinthians 9 verses 1 to 14 moses represented christ for moses stood in the gap and aaron represented the fivefold ministry for he had four sons plus himself to make five ministers in the ministry fourth in another quote brother branham types the two spies to one person the holy ghost and then in another quote brother branham types the two spies to the pastor let's listen to these two quotes now he's the same yesterday today and forever open up your house and let the messenger of the holy ghost come in and identify you by his own presence the token lord that's upon you just ask [Music] and remember this means you cannot say the two spies only represent tape boys since brother branham typed them as one person a holy divine person the holy spirit and a regular person anointed with the holy spirit a pastor fourth bible truth regarding revelation 22 16. leadership in jeffersonville falsely interprets revelation 22 16 which says i jesus have sent might angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star friends jeffersonville is interpreting this scripture as saying jesus sent his angel which is brother branham's tapes to testify unto you these things in the local churches they believe this scripture means jesus sent brother branham's tapes to be played in local churches and for fivefold ministry preachers to sit down and not preach and just press play which we know is an error because jesus jesus's fivefold ministry cannot change jeffersonville falsely teaches and i quote many critics without revelation say brother branham never said play tapes in church that's called ears but can't hear others say we just believe the bible and it don't say it in the bible neither jesus himself said play tapes in your local churches end quote this misinterpretation is complete and utter false doctrine the facts are 1. brother branham never said to play tapes in every church rather than have living god called pastors preach the gospel and two the bible only supports the fivefold ministry of living holy ghost anointed preachers and ministers with their own voices in churches just as brother branham always taught as the church age book validates he never told them to go into all the world and establish bible colleges nor did he tell them to pass out literature now these things are fine but what jesus told them to do was to preach the gospel stick with the word and then the signs would follow the very first introduction we have in the way the kingdom of god was to be preached was when he sent out the twelve in matthew 10 1-8 he commissioned and instructed them on this wise this ministry that he gave them was actually the sharing of his own ministry with them for it says in matthew 9 35-38 sadly as proof of their false teaching jeffersonville leadership cites a footnote in the scofield bible to fit their man-made creed here's a picture of that footnote friends this interpretation is not correct the word church is in revelation 22 16 has five greek definitions but cannot be limited to just the local church today the church age book and brother branham sermons both teach john's letters to the churches were prophetic to future church ages or time periods plus immediately applicable to the seven gentile churches in asia minor around 95 a.d when john received the visions on the isle of atmos jeffersonville is essentially saying jesus has changed the fivefold ministry to tape playing sadly the tape church movement must have missed the keystone revelation brother branham teaches in the church age book from hebrews 13 8 malachi 3 verse 6 and galatians 1 verses 6 through 12. god and his ways do not change jeffersonville leadership cannot change the fivefold ministry that jesus christ started and it will continue until the bride is raptured off the earth in closing friends it's an honor to earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints and continued by brother branham in our day i want to close with a few quotes the first quote says if the word is in you you don't change it or deny it how can the holy spirit that wrote the word be in you denying the word how can it deny when the very holy spirit itself said if any person shall add one word to this or take anything from it i'll take his part out of the book of life how can the holy spirit then take anything from the word or add anything to the word friends how can a born-again person change the scripture about the fivefold ministry in ephesians 4. the fact is a born-again christian cannot change it and will not change it friends we know we're part of the bride if we're saying the same thing the prophet said and the same thing the scripture says let's finish with this beautiful quote from the church age book chapter 9 that says the spirit the prophet and the bride will all say what is in the unchanging word the living preaching fivefold ministry will continue until the rapture yes listen to the authenticated prophet of god who appears in this last age what he says from god the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word they are saying it now come out from among her now and be separate the cry has gone out the cry is going out how long will the voice cry we do not know but one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last age but this message that i'm preaching uh is the true message of this day and it's the last message you see what i'm doing brother i'm putting you all the same place i am because you're just as much into it as i am you are messengers of this same message which side are you on the side that stays with brother branham's quotes about the fightful ministry and believes in lie preaching or the side that is adding to brother branham's quotes and deleting brother brown's quotes and yet the most dangerous thing is adding deleting or redefining the scripture if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
