[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] sometimes great guys get together you
[0:06] ever seen great so-and-so great
[0:07] so-and-so our great don't never do that
[0:10] there's no great ones Among Us there's
[0:13] only one great one and that's God
[0:17] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:23] this video is to continue the series on
[0:25] the 24 plus Lies coming out of Branham
[0:29] Tabernacle today by God's grace we'll
[0:31] cover the 14th lie which is that Branham
[0:34] Tabernacle claims they are the greatest
[0:36] Christians of all time and not only that
[0:40] but brother Branham was the greatest
[0:41] prophet of all time Branham tabernacle's
[0:44] current Pastor has the greatest Ministry
[0:46] and also a family member from Branham
[0:49] Tabernacle says he is the most blessed
[0:51] person on Earth because of his family
[0:56] before getting started on this video let
[0:58] me go through the 13 previous lies
[1:00] number one every word on tape is thus
[1:02] saith the Lord plus the tapes can never
[1:04] be wrong the tapes have no mistakes the
[1:07] tapes have every answer number two all
[1:10] the answers are on the tapes
[1:12] line number three we must unquestionably
[1:15] believe every word on tape is thus say
[1:17] the Lord even if brother Adam lied
[1:19] the fourth lie is there's a false Vision
[1:22] that every Church must play the tapes
[1:24] and every Church must be a tape church
[1:26] and of course this is a lie this is a
[1:29] denominational mandate
[1:31] the fifth lies that the tapes are the
[1:33] token and being part of a tape church is
[1:36] the token the sixth lie is the Tate boys
[1:39] are the true five-fold Ministry and
[1:41] tapes are number one in the five full
[1:43] ministry
[1:45] the seventh lie is brother random spirit
[1:47] and soul were identical to Jesus
[1:50] Christ's spirit and soul
[1:53] the eighth lie is that brother Brandon's
[1:55] Ministry is a living Ministry and
[1:58] Branham Tabernacle calls anyone a Demas
[2:00] who doesn't believe that
[2:03] the ninth lie is that revelation 22
[2:06] verse 16 is Jesus telling everyone to be
[2:08] taped churches as the perfect will of
[2:11] God
[2:12] the tenth lies that brother Branham is
[2:14] the angel of revelation 22 verses 6
[2:17] through 9 and verse 16.
[2:20] the 11th lies that the tapes are the
[2:22] absolute
[2:24] the 12th lies that anyone who does not
[2:27] play tapes is a make-believer or
[2:30] unbeliever
[2:32] and the 13th lie is that Branham
[2:35] Tabernacle is thus saith the Lord in the
[2:37] perfect will of God by playing tapes and
[2:40] decreasing living preachers
[2:46] now this 14th lie that Branham
[2:48] Tabernacle and brother Branham are the
[2:51] greatest of all time
[2:52] was made known on two blog posts from
[2:55] Brenham Tabernacles Pastor we'll read
[2:57] those in a moment but if you want a full
[2:59] in-depth teaching on the subject I made
[3:01] a video it's my 116th video from July
[3:04] 27th
[3:05] of last year 2022 the video is called
[3:09] our message Believers the greatest
[3:10] Christians of all time the bride Pride
[3:13] goat debate
[3:15] when I made that video it was very sad
[3:17] for me to see both Branham Tabernacle
[3:20] and then five full ministry preachers
[3:22] calling themselves the greatest of all
[3:24] time
[3:25] over the course of this last year I've
[3:27] continued to watch these preachers who
[3:29] said they were the greatest of all time
[3:30] they've decreased the amount of times
[3:32] they're saying they're the greatest of
[3:34] all time but it still comes through
[3:36] for example last month in July preacher
[3:39] D went to another preacher's
[3:41] congregation and told their congregation
[3:43] their Pastor was one of the greatest
[3:45] preachers of all time
[3:47] and then sadly even a few days ago at a
[3:50] youth meeting in this area a guest
[3:53] Minister preached to the youth that they
[3:56] were the greatest youth of all time and
[3:58] of course the minister had no scripture
[4:00] for that friends it's a great detriment
[4:02] to tell our youth that they're the
[4:04] greatest youth of all time
[4:05] there's no scripture for it and it
[4:08] creates a false sense of security
[4:10] as Jesus said the greatest among you
[4:12] will be the servants friends how can the
[4:14] youth today be the greatest Servants of
[4:16] all time
[4:17] are today's youth doing anything
[4:18] different from the previous generations
[4:21] youth are today's youth praying more
[4:24] fasting more seeing greater miracles
[4:26] than any other generation before us
[4:28] so you can see it's a great detriment to
[4:31] tell the youth that they're the greatest
[4:32] of all time
[4:34] all right let's get into the actual
[4:36] evidence of this lie coming out of
[4:39] Branham Tabernacle we have we have three
[4:41] blog posts and one video on this topic
[4:44] the first blog post is from August 1st
[4:47] 2022 so exactly three years ago from the
[4:51] day this is being recorded
[4:52] Branham tabernacle's Pastor said quote
[4:55] and today he has sent the greatest
[4:57] prophet of all time William Marion
[4:59] Branham to lead his bride end quote
[5:04] get together here I'm saying great
[5:06] so-and-so great so-and-so our great
[5:09] don't never do that
[5:11] there's no great ones Among Us
[5:17] now friends Everyone's entitled to their
[5:19] opinion but again the pastor Branham
[5:22] Tabernacle gives no Bible support for
[5:24] this
[5:25] and the worst part is that random
[5:26] Tabernacles Pastor did not say except
[5:29] for Jesus Christ
[5:30] in other words Branham Tabernacles
[5:32] Pastor didn't even acknowledge that
[5:33] Jesus Christ is the greatest prophet of
[5:35] all time
[5:43] was Jesus when he
[5:46] essentially put his father brother
[5:48] Branham above Jesus Christ
[5:50] and remember friends there's quotes from
[5:52] my 116th video where brother random said
[5:55] Moses is the greatest prophet of all
[5:56] time John the Baptist is the greatest
[5:58] prophet of all time and of course
[5:59] brother Adam said Jesus Christ is the
[6:01] greatest prophet of all time as you and
[6:03] I know we have to rightly divide the
[6:04] tapes and prove everything by the word
[6:07] of God as brother Ram told us to do
[6:10] second blog post is from Saturday
[6:12] December 26 2020 quote it is the
[6:16] greatest age of all time with the
[6:18] greatest messenger of all time who is
[6:19] gathering the greatest people of all
[6:21] time end quote
[6:23] random Tabernacle is saying they're the
[6:25] greatest of all time and brother
[6:26] Randolph said don't never call anyone
[6:28] great and brother Branham said there's
[6:30] no great ones Among Us let's listen to
[6:32] the quotes
[6:34] hands great guys get together you're
[6:36] gonna say great so-and-so great
[6:38] so-and-so our great don't never do that
[6:42] there's no great ones Among Us
[6:47] so this is an extremely sad blog post
[6:50] random tabernacle's Pastor is exalting
[6:53] his congregation and all the people that
[6:55] follow him around the world as the
[6:57] greatest of all time
[6:59] friends it is a prideful sin to call
[7:02] yourself the greatest of all time the
[7:04] Bible says he that humbleth himself
[7:06] shall be exalted but here we have
[7:09] Branham Tabernacles Pastor exalting
[7:10] himself now and not humbling himself now
[7:13] and exalting his people now and not
[7:15] asking his people to Humble themselves
[7:18] here's three quotes that are helpful in
[7:21] balancing the truth about the greatest
[7:23] of all time
[7:25] remember that Branham tabernacle's
[7:27] current Pastor is saying the laodicean
[7:29] Saints are the greatest of all time but
[7:32] notice what brother random said in the
[7:34] sermon from 1960 to laodicean church age
[7:37] brother random said Jesus had complaints
[7:39] against the laodicean age he didn't
[7:42] commend this for nothing
[7:44] so Branham tabernacle's Pastor is not
[7:46] saying what brother Brandon said brother
[7:48] Branham said this age does not get
[7:50] commended for anything let's listen to
[7:52] the quote
[7:53] now the next verse would be to the other
[7:56] churches
[7:57] come in
[7:58] but he didn't commend this church
[8:01] he had a complaint against it not a
[8:02] command right amen you didn't command
[8:05] this for nothing
[8:06] this lady you'll see their age with all
[8:08] the light that they had and went back on
[8:10] it they didn't need any commanding
[8:13] and either rebuking the Gods
[8:15] he had a complaint for this church not a
[8:18] command
[8:21] second quote is from the 70th week of
[8:23] Daniel 1961.
[8:25] brother Ram said a Philadelphian church
[8:27] was the greatest age of Love we've ever
[8:30] had so how can Branham Tabernacle say
[8:33] they're the greatest age the greatest
[8:35] congregation
[8:36] when brother Branham said the
[8:38] Philadelphian age had the greatest love
[8:40] let's listen to the quote
[8:42] long come Wesley after that with his age
[8:45] we see exactly what Wesley's age what
[8:47] was it called Philadelphia
[8:48] in the greatest age of Love we've ever
[8:50] had the Philadelphian age was right
[8:54] a third and final quote was from the
[8:56] church age book page 309 brother random
[8:59] said the teaching and preaching in the
[9:02] Philadelphia Church age was the greatest
[9:04] teaching and preaching of all time the
[9:07] ram said the greatest works of Christian
[9:08] literature and teaching and preaching
[9:10] came from this era never has its
[9:12] preachers and teachers been matched and
[9:15] never will they be
[9:17] so that means the laosian age cannot
[9:19] match the literature teaching and
[9:21] preaching that came from the
[9:22] Philadelphian Church age
[9:24] now why isn't Branham Tabernacle saying
[9:26] what the tapes and the books say so see
[9:29] friends Branham Tabernacle just
[9:30] constantly contradicts themselves they
[9:33] constantly contradict brother Branham
[9:35] let's listen to the quote
[9:37] the preaching of the word was never
[9:38] greater as Satan raised up his hordes of
[9:41] free thinkers as The Originators of
[9:43] Communism rose up as liberal theologians
[9:46] spread their filthy Wares God raised up
[9:49] Mighty Warriors of faith and the
[9:51] greatest works of Christian literature
[9:53] and teaching and preaching came from
[9:55] this era
[9:56] never has its preachers and teachers
[9:58] been matched and never will they be
[10:00] The spurgeons Parkers McLarens the
[10:04] Edwards bunions muellers brainerds
[10:06] Barnes Bishops all came from this era
[10:09] they preached taught and wrote the word
[10:12] they glorified his name
[10:16] I want to remind everyone as well that
[10:18] brother Ram said the greatest message
[10:19] was when Jesus rose from the dead
[10:22] preachers today and of course Branham
[10:24] Tabernacle are saying we have the
[10:26] greatest message of all time
[10:27] but is that what brother Branham said
[10:29] brother random said it in go tell 1960
[10:32] on Easter morning the disciples got the
[10:34] greatest message that any man could ever
[10:37] get
[10:38] let's listen to the quote
[10:40] but on Easter morning when these
[10:42] disciples got the greatest message that
[10:44] any man could ever get
[10:46] what did they get
[10:48] gold tell my disciples I am risen from
[10:52] the dead death had been conquered there
[10:55] never was nobody on Earth no prophet
[10:59] and then a second quote on this is that
[11:01] brother random said the Shepherds at
[11:02] Jesus birth had the greatest message
[11:04] that Messiah is here now
[11:06] I noticed brother Ram did not say this
[11:09] message the Shepherds had was the second
[11:11] greatest message after his message
[11:14] he said they had the greatest message
[11:15] let's listen to the quote from White had
[11:17] to be Shepherds 1964.
[11:20] a great learning man King's potent takes
[11:23] monarchs
[11:25] but here he comes to the greatest of all
[11:27] the messages
[11:29] what was the message Messiah is here now
[11:34] and to make that known he bypassed all
[11:37] the trains to make it known to Humble
[11:39] Shepherds
[11:42] the third and final blog post is from
[11:44] October 22nd 2022
[11:47] it says quote I have said many times
[11:49] that I have the greatest Ministry in the
[11:50] world I get to introduce the voice of
[11:52] God to my church every Sunday end quote
[11:58] here I'm saying great so-and-song great
[12:00] so and so our great don't never do that
[12:04] there's no great ones Among Us
[12:10] you're the pastor of random Tabernacle
[12:12] says he has the greatest Ministry in the
[12:14] world
[12:15] friends which Bible character in the
[12:17] Bible said they had the greatest
[12:18] Ministry in the entire world which
[12:21] prophet of God in the Bible said they
[12:22] were the greatest prophet of all time
[12:24] and had the greatest Congregation of all
[12:26] time
[12:27] no one said that and Jesus said a tree
[12:30] is known by its fruit the fruit coming
[12:32] out of Branham Tabernacle is where the
[12:34] greatest we have the greatest current
[12:36] Ministry we have the greatest Prophet we
[12:37] have the greatest congregation and
[12:39] that's a prideful sinful state for their
[12:42] Church to be in
[12:44] we should not be seeing how great we can
[12:46] make ourselves we should be seeing how
[12:48] humble we can become the Bible says
[12:50] humble yourselves under the mighty hand
[12:52] of God and that God will exalt you in
[12:54] due season
[12:56] finally I want to show one video this is
[12:58] of a member of random Tabernacle and
[13:01] this is a son of brother Branham notice
[13:04] he says he's the most blessed person in
[13:06] the world and ask yourself why is it
[13:08] because the blood of Jesus Christ has
[13:09] forgiven his sins or something related
[13:12] to the work of Jesus Christ the answer
[13:14] is no he believes he's the most blessed
[13:16] person in the world simply because of
[13:18] the two men he's got to work with in his
[13:20] ministry his father and his brother
[13:23] so let's watch the video and then we'll
[13:25] make some comments on it
[13:27] and I said God bless me of of any man
[13:31] first of all he'll let me be his son
[13:34] he chose me
[13:36] and he didn't let me be a son of a
[13:38] prophet and to be a brother prophet and
[13:42] to have worked with both of the prophets
[13:44] in my lifetime
[13:45] surely I've been a blessed man
[13:48] all we have to do
[13:51] is push play
[13:52] and obey God bless you and remember if
[13:57] God thought it brother Branham spoken
[14:00] I believe it and that settles God bless
[14:04] you
[14:08] so notice again friends from the video
[14:10] this Branham Tabernacle member is saying
[14:12] things brother Branham never said
[14:14] brother Brown never said press play and
[14:16] obey brother Brown never said God
[14:19] thought it I spoke it you must believe
[14:21] it that settles it
[14:23] friends we must be aware of the idolatry
[14:25] coming out of Branham Tabernacle they
[14:28] are idolizing brother Branham and his
[14:31] tapes brother Branham never said every
[14:34] word I said on tape settles every
[14:36] situation and every question
[14:38] remember this is the same man who said
[14:40] brother randoms mind and soul were
[14:43] identical to Jesus
[14:45] and if you don't believe that you're the
[14:47] seed of discrepancy and of course that
[14:49] was more idolatry
[14:51] what I read about in this blessed book I
[14:55] saw come manifest in a man called
[14:56] William Branham
[14:58] he preached like the Bible preached he
[15:01] talked like Jesus he walked like Jesus
[15:03] he lived like Jesus but his name was
[15:06] William Brown the only difference is the
[15:09] Corporal body and anything I don't
[15:11] believe that is the seed of discrepancy
[15:15] anyone with spiritual understanding can
[15:17] see this is an idolatry-filled
[15:19] congregation and just to follow up
[15:21] here's a few quotes from brother Brandon
[15:22] that say opposite of what brother
[15:24] Brandon's son is saying brother said the
[15:27] Seal of God is the greatest blessing
[15:29] by LeBron's oldest son says working with
[15:31] his father and his brother is the
[15:33] greatest blessing and that's not what
[15:35] brother Brandon said let's listen to the
[15:36] quote
[15:37] last night on the greatest criminal
[15:40] there is in the world the mark of the
[15:42] beast
[15:43] and denied on the greatest blessing
[15:46] areas in the world the Seal of God
[15:49] tomorrow night I'm going to
[15:52] here's another quote brother random says
[15:54] giving to others is the greatest
[15:56] blessing in life it's not who you know
[15:58] but it's about giving to others let's
[16:00] listen to the quote
[16:02] but I would ask of you
[16:04] would be a prayer for me before you lay
[16:07] down tonight that God would keep me
[16:10] humble in my heart
[16:11] and would help me and bless me so that I
[16:14] could be a blessing to you people
[16:17] I found out that the greatest blessing
[16:19] in life is giving something out not
[16:21] receiving in but giving out
[16:24] what you do for others
[16:26] what means so much
[16:30] here's a third quote brother random says
[16:31] it's the greatest privilege if God
[16:34] knocks at your heart the greatest
[16:36] privilege is not who you work with in
[16:37] life let's listen to the quote
[16:40] see if God knocks at your heart that's
[16:42] the greatest privilege you ever had in
[16:43] all your life anybody ever did that is
[16:46] for God to give you an invitation to
[16:47] come to him
[16:50] in closing
[16:52] hope this video has been a blessing
[16:54] friends we're continuing to move on in
[16:56] this series we thank God for the Holy
[16:58] Ghost for the Holy Ghost keeps guiding
[17:00] us into all truth
[17:02] friends brother Branham modeled a humble
[17:05] life before us brother Brown never said
[17:06] he was the greatest of all time
[17:08] he never said his congregation was the
[17:10] greatest of all time
[17:11] but Iran was humble like in the seventh
[17:13] seal he said you forget anything about
[17:15] me I am your brother a sinner Say by
[17:17] Grace not fit to live that's exactly the
[17:19] truth and I ain't saying that to be
[17:21] humble that's facts
[17:23] there's nothing in me not one sound
[17:25] thing at all but the grace of God is let
[17:27] my poor dimming eyes look beyond the
[17:29] curtain of time
[17:30] end quote the Rand also said when the
[17:33] Holy Ghost comes on you it makes you
[17:35] Meek humble and forgiving he said quote
[17:37] that's what the Holy Spirit does it
[17:39] makes you Meek makes you humble makes
[17:41] you forgiving end quote
[17:43] brother Ram said quote not as we brag we
[17:46] have no brag only on Jesus Christ none
[17:48] of us we only brag on Jesus Christ end
[17:51] quote
[17:53] so friends let us continue to Humble
[17:55] ourselves and let us brag on Jesus
[17:57] Christ only
[17:58] if you have any questions concerns or
[18:01] testimonies about this video please
[18:02] contact me
[18:04] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[18:07] the desire of your heart
