TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings in Jesus Christ's name praise the name of the Lord God's message of the hour has come to akan the message of the hour is the prophecies and Promises from the Bible that God is fulfilling today right now God's message for Christians today can be summarized in three words restore reveal and Rapture before judgment strikes the Earth in a moment we'll expound on the scriptural prophecies and promises that teach us about our message of restoration Revelation and Rapture but first let's look at some Messengers God has sent in the past who had to preach the message of the hour to the generations in which they [Music] lived Noah's message for his hour was something similar to this repent and get inside the Ark of Salvation for God is going to destroy the Earth with a flood because of the continual wickedness of every man's heart Moses's message for his day sounded like this apply the token of the blood of the Lamb to your house for God has taking his Covenant people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and Into the Wilderness to prove them God wants his people to possess their Promised Land John the Baptist had the message of his hour saying repent and and be baptized and prepare the way for the Lord the Messiah our blessed savior Jesus Christ had the message of his hour saying I will be delivered into the hands of men to be crucified for the sins of the whole world but I will rise on the third day for your justification after he arose his message was receive ye the Holy Ghost T in Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high next on the day of Pentecost St pet pet began preaching the message of his hour which was the coming and filling of the Holy Ghost to the Jews first and then the Gentiles now for 2,000 years God has sent messenger after Messenger to prepare the people to live the promises of their day the promises God wanted to fulfill in their lifetimes and in their Generations the most recent Messengers may be men and movements you are familiar with Martin Luther who lived during the 16th century preached the message of his hour which was the just shall live by faith in the 18th century God used a man by the name of John Wesley to Proclaim his message of the hour which was sanctification have Holiness of heart and life the next message of the hour was preached by William Seymour during the isua Street Revival of 1906 the message of that hour was the gifts of the Holy Ghost are returning such as speaking in tongues prophecy and the the rest of the gifts of the Spirit spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12 God proved each of these moves to be genuine as Millions have experienced the power of God through Luther's justification by faith Wesley's sanctification of the spirit and Seymour's preaching on the gifts of the holy spirit but God wanted to restore more he wanted to restore the true baptism of the Holy Ghost experience that leads us up to today's message [Music] God's message for this hour is to restore reveal and then Rapture the Bride of Jesus Christ let's look at the bible promises for our message first God promised in the following scriptures to restore all things his church had lost or forfeited over the last 2,000 years since the church began on the day of Pentecost acts 3: 21-22 teaches that Jesus will be in heaven until all things are restored Jesus prophesied in Matthew 17:11 that Elijah would come first and restore all things Malachi 4 5 and 6 teaches that this same Elijah Spirit upon a prophet would turn the hearts of the children back to the hearts of the fathers before Jesus returns the Lord willing we will soon share a video about the Elijah messenger of our day who Faithfully preached our message of restoration Revelation and rapture we can see from these scriptures that that God wants to restore the hearts of the Christians back to the same condition of the hearts of our Pentecostal fathers from the book of Acts when the New Testament Church was born with the right heart we will finish the Great Commission that the early church started we will also have completely surrendered Hearts to God that want to obey every word of God the heart of Jesus's bride will want to talk holy think holy dress holy and live holy in every way just like the early church next God promised to reveal all the mysteries of the Bible before the second coming of Jesus Christ in the following scriptures Revelation 10:7 says that the mystery of God will be finished by a seventh angel who receives the Open Bible from Christ The Mighty Angel Amos 3:7 says that God will reveal his Secrets through prophets and we know from the previous scriptures that this Prophet will have the Elijah anointing some of these Mysteries which must be revealed today include the Seven Seals and the Seven Stars the godhead mystery Babylon and the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity the Rapture Israel's blindness during the church age the New Testament Church as the bride of Christ and marriage and divorce just to name a few we pray that you'll want to understand all these Mysteries as Jesus told us it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given finally God promised to Rapture his bride or Spirit-filled New Testament Church Jesus taught Parables about his second coming and likened it unto a wedding Jesus is called the bridegroom and his church is called the bride Jesus is returning to Rapture or catch away his bride off the Earth before the horrible tribulation period Jesus's bride will make herself ready by letting Jesus wash her with the water of his word in The Parables Jesus told there were symbols used to help us understand what was required for bride Believers to be made ready for the Rapture one symbol was oil as the wise virgins had oil ready in their vessels and so they could go in with the bridegroom to the wedding the five foolish virgins did not have this oil so they could not be a part of the rapture or wedding of the Lamb another symbol was the wedding garment from Matthew 22 1-14 which represents the righteousness of saints which the Bride of Jesus will wear this wedding garment shows that the bride has accepted the righteousness of Jesus's works for salvation and her garments are clean through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost one man did not have this wedding garment on so he could not be part of the Rapture the wedding and and he was cast out into outer darkness which represents the tribulation period we can clearly see that both the oil and the wedding garment represent the filling or baptism of the Holy Ghost experience Jesus taught us to receive if you've been baptized with the Holy Ghost you will be ready for the Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ and escape the tribulation in the Rapture you will meet Jesus in the air with the Saints who have gone on before us and then quickly go to the marriage supper of the Lamb so will we ever be with our [Music] Lord now that we can see what God's message of the hour is what are message Believers doing right now as stated earlier Believers are being washed and made ready by the preaching and receiving of Jesus's words Believers are also finishing the Great Commission that Jesus spoke of in Matthew 28 19 and 20 go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world Amen message Believers are also sending missionaries to take the message of the hour to All Nations once the message of the hour is preached in all nations then we know Jesus will return according to Matthew 24:14 and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come Revelation 10 gives us a vivid picture of this completion of the Great Commission Jesus Christ is the mighty Angel who comes down with an open book this book symbolizes the Bible and all its Mysteries which are now open and revealed by the seventh angel or messenger our responsibility in this hour is like John in Revelation 10: 8-1 we are to take the open book and eat the contents the truths of the Bible which will give us the strength and power to take the revelation of the Bible to many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings we pray you will eat the open book as well by listening to and believing the Bible truce God has restored back to his holy ghost filled New Testament Church the Bride of Jesus Christ we conclude by saying to you the viewer the same words that Philip told Nathaniel after seeing what God was doing on the earth during his generation come and see the message of the hour God bless you if you would like more information about the message of this hour and the messenger Anointed with the spirit of Elijah please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
