[0:02] what about the people that believe in
[0:05] the Lord now and don't and not the way
[0:09] you preach they don't have to believe
[0:11] this they don't have to believe the way
[0:12] I preach it see don't have to believe
[0:14] that but those who can accept the word
[0:17] in its fullness not me preaching it
[0:19] because it's a Bible
[0:22] sessle greetings friends in the
[0:24] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:26] the purpose of this video is to do a
[0:28] part two on answering the six questions
[0:32] from the believe the sign website and
[0:34] YouTube channel I released part one on
[0:36] April 13th
[0:38] 20124 after listening to part one again
[0:41] I felt I would expound on some of their
[0:43] questions a little more by God's grace
[0:45] and also through the comment section I
[0:48] thought I'd add some more Bible verses
[0:50] more Revelation by the grace of God hi
[0:53] friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor of bride
[0:55] of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio
[0:57] USA and I defend the Bible Revelation
[1:00] that Jesus Christ revealed to his true
[1:02] Prophet The Late William brandham 1909
[1:04] to 1965 and I also defend brother bram's
[1:07] Godly Christian character so by God's
[1:09] grace I'd like to add a little more to
[1:10] question 1 2 and three the Lord willing
[1:14] here so question one said can you please
[1:16] show us where William brandham is
[1:18] Vindicated as a prophet of God
[1:20] scripturally and so I started that on
[1:22] part one I felt in this part too I would
[1:25] emphasize Revelation 10:7 a little more
[1:28] the Bible said the seventh angel would
[1:29] finish finish the mystery of God and
[1:31] this is not a Heavenly angel with a
[1:33] Heavenly trumpet this is an Earthly
[1:36] Angel because God does not use Heavenly
[1:39] angels to save human beings many times
[1:42] in scripture humans or Godly men were
[1:45] called Angels such as David and Paul I
[1:48] have a video about this so I'll leave a
[1:50] link in the description as well by God's
[1:52] grace how the seventh angel Revelation
[1:54] 10:7 is an Earthly messenger an Earthly
[1:57] Angel it's different from the seventh
[1:59] angel with the th trumpet in Revelation
[2:01] 9 but again recall I wrote a book in
[2:04] 2021 there are 12 Bible defined
[2:07] mysteries in the New Testament there's
[2:10] the book again the 12 New Testament
[2:12] Mysteries revealed there are the godhead
[2:15] Israel's spiritual blindness The Mystery
[2:16] of the New Testament Church composed of
[2:19] both Jew and Gentile the New Testament
[2:21] Church is the bride of Christ godliness
[2:23] restored to man Christ in you the
[2:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Seven
[2:27] Stars and the Seven candlesticks The
[2:29] Mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven the
[2:30] mystery of Babylon the great the mystery
[2:33] of iniquity the mystery of God's will
[2:34] the mystery of the Rapture those are the
[2:37] 12 New Testament Mysteries and brother
[2:39] brandham gave us six of them with thus
[2:41] say the Lord so we believe the rest of
[2:43] them of course are faithful Bible
[2:45] teachings because they align perfectly
[2:46] with the other six so brother brandom is
[2:50] Vindicated scripturally in many places
[2:52] of course Revelation 10:7 Amos 37
[2:55] brother brandom revealed The Mystery of
[2:57] the revelation of the Seven Seals to us
[2:59] and on one video I showed there's over
[3:01] 110 differences between true Bible
[3:04] doctrine that we call the message cuz
[3:07] that's what the message is it's the
[3:08] Bible teachings Bible scriptures God is
[3:11] fulfilling right now versus the
[3:13] denominations and non-denominational
[3:15] churches that transgress the word of God
[3:18] they teach traditions of men rather than
[3:20] the traditions of God rather than the
[3:22] true teachings of God some of those
[3:24] teachings are brother Ram's Revelation
[3:27] on the Book of Revelation how the seven
[3:30] angels in chapters 2 and 3 are actually
[3:32] seven humans because Angels do not
[3:34] preach Doctrine to Believers how
[3:37] Revelation 13 has both the Beast out of
[3:41] the sea paple and Pagan Rome and also
[3:43] the United States of America in
[3:45] Revelation 13
[3:46] 11-18 The Truth on there's two future
[3:49] resurrections the truth on hell is not
[3:52] Eternal there are prophets after Jesus
[3:55] there is a message of the hour there are
[3:58] three works of Grace tongues are not the
[4:00] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[4:02] Ghost water baptism does not save but we
[4:05] should do it if we have the chance in
[4:07] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ full
[4:09] immersion in water we're saved by grace
[4:12] through faith in Jesus's blood men
[4:15] should have short hair women should have
[4:16] as long as hair as possible long uncut
[4:20] hair makeup is a sin high heels are a
[4:23] Sin tattoos are a Sin we must have
[4:25] separate garments for men and women
[4:28] exposing the thighs nakedness according
[4:29] to Isaiah 47 1-3 and avoid expensive
[4:33] hair and jewelry serpent seed is the
[4:35] original sin there's no women Angels no
[4:38] women preachers allowed marriage and
[4:41] divorce until death there's only one
[4:43] case where a man could divorce his wife
[4:46] and marry another Jesus said that's for
[4:48] the cause of unconfessed
[4:50] fornication tithes and offerings having
[4:52] a home Church predestination and for
[4:55] knowledge gender is stable man has three
[4:59] parts to his being Pope is the
[5:00] Antichrist and so many more wonderful
[5:02] Revelations God revealed to brother
[5:05] brandham all right moving on to question
[5:07] number two question two is why did
[5:09] William brandham change his mind on his
[5:10] doctrines through his
[5:12] ministry I thought I would emphasize a
[5:14] little more on this question about God's
[5:16] timing in brother brandom's life brother
[5:19] random changed some of his teachings and
[5:20] doctrines because he had to wait on God
[5:22] for the revelation of those subjects
[5:25] just like any other preacher 1961 was
[5:28] the right time for brother to get thus
[5:30] sayi the Lord that God is one person
[5:32] 1963 was the right time for brother
[5:34] brandom to get the revelation of the
[5:36] Seven Seals 1965 was the right time for
[5:39] brother brandom to preach the true
[5:40] Revelation on marriage and divorce and
[5:42] it's the same for every believer 1517
[5:45] was the right time for God to reveal the
[5:47] 95 thesis to Martin Luther same is true
[5:50] for Abraham 75 years old was the right
[5:53] time for God to call Abraham to separate
[5:55] from his family and then 100 years old
[5:58] was the right time for Abraham to
[5:59] receive Isaac God always works at the
[6:01] right time and season we can't question
[6:04] well why did God let Paul or Saul do so
[6:07] much damage to the New Testament Church
[6:08] before saving him and revealing the
[6:11] majority of the New Testament to him so
[6:12] he could write it and put it in print
[6:14] for us today God gave Paul the right
[6:17] Revelation at the right time just like
[6:19] he did for brother brandham God gave
[6:20] brother Bram the right Revelations he
[6:22] needed at just the right time I'd like
[6:24] to say a little bit more about the
[6:25] Trinity again in my 2021 book by God's
[6:28] grace chapter 1 is about the Trinity I
[6:31] show eight problems with the Trinity
[6:32] Dogma the first problem it's it's a
[6:35] Dogma that adds to the Bible Proverbs
[6:37] 35:6 and Revelation 2218 and 19 say we
[6:41] should not add to the Bible this is the
[6:43] most decimating argument to the failure
[6:46] of the Trinity Dogma it adds to the
[6:48] Bible so it cannot be from God second
[6:51] Jesus and his Apostles taught and affirm
[6:53] pure Hebrew monotheism rather than
[6:56] trinitarianism you'll never find Jesus
[6:59] or the Apostles preaching three persons
[7:02] it's not in the Bible third the athian
[7:04] Creed or 6th Century trinitarian
[7:07] confessional contains multiple
[7:08] contradictions to Bible teaching on the
[7:10] godhead I have six just listed in my
[7:12] book and there's no doubt more there's
[7:15] six contradictions in the Creed that
[7:17] contradict the word of God that's what
[7:19] Jesus said in Matthew 15 he said your
[7:22] Traditions transgress the word of God
[7:24] therefore they're in vain so we know the
[7:27] Trinity Dogma is in vain it's not true
[7:29] worship fourth major Bible
[7:31] contradictions and inconsistencies exist
[7:33] among trinitarians trinitarians can't
[7:36] even agree on their false doctrines
[7:39] fifth the early trinitarians did not
[7:40] affirm the Holy Spirit was divine until
[7:42] the Council of Constantinople in 381 ad
[7:47] that's extremely sad and just sinful
[7:50] that the trinitarians didn't recognize
[7:52] the Holy Ghost was divine until 381 ad
[7:56] six trinitarian images and artwork are
[7:58] often deceptive creating false
[7:59] representations of the godhead of course
[8:02] that's Satan deceiving people through
[8:03] their imagination they use false images
[8:07] to deceive these trinitarians that don't
[8:09] know the Bible seventh some trinitarians
[8:12] use two fear tactics to persuade others
[8:14] to believe in the Trinity heresy and
[8:16] hell they say anyone that doesn't
[8:18] believe in three persons is a heretic
[8:20] I've been called a heretic by believe
[8:21] the sign on their podcast shame on them
[8:24] and then some trinitarians say you'll go
[8:26] to hell if you don't believe in three
[8:28] persons exactly the opposite is true
[8:30] you'll go to heaven if you just believe
[8:32] the Bible preaching and Bible teaching
[8:34] that God is one person remember Hebrews
[8:37] 1 ver3 Jesus Christ is the image of
[8:39] God's person there's only one person in
[8:42] the godhead and eighth and finally God
[8:45] sent a prophet named William Bram to
[8:46] warn Christians about the false Trinity
[8:48] Doctrine even stating quote
[8:50] trinitarianism is of the devil I say
[8:52] that thus sayith the Lord end quote and
[8:56] one more statement on question two they
[8:58] asked about water baptism in the formula
[9:01] friends there are fewer doctrines in the
[9:03] message that are as rock solid and true
[9:06] as the water baptism full immersion in
[9:09] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'll
[9:11] show a screenshot here of my Bible with
[9:14] the notes about water baptism of course
[9:17] I have an entire video on this I'll
[9:18] leave a link to that in the
[9:21] description brother random changed his
[9:23] ideas on water baptism because God
[9:25] solely revealed to him the true water
[9:27] baptism found in the scripture Matthew
[9:29] 28:19 says baptized in the name of the
[9:32] father and the son and of the Holy Ghost
[9:34] so it was Jesus giving a revelation
[9:36] there's one name to the father there's
[9:38] one name to the son there's one name to
[9:40] the Holy Ghost and it's the Lord Jesus
[9:42] Christ the name of the father is in John
[9:45] 5:43 Jesus said I come in my father's
[9:47] name the father was called Jehovah and
[9:50] Jesus the name Jesus means Jehovah is
[9:53] salvation so that verse proves Jesus has
[9:57] the name of the father when we say Jesus
[9:59] is actually the name of the father
[10:01] Jehovah is our
[10:02] Salvation second the name of the son
[10:05] Matthew 1:21 Mary was told Jesus would
[10:08] be a son and call his name Jesus so the
[10:11] name of the son is Jesus the name of the
[10:13] father is Jesus the name of the son is
[10:15] Jesus and then Jesus said in John 14:26
[10:18] the comforter would be sent in his name
[10:21] the Holy Ghost comes in the name of
[10:23] Jesus Christ so anybody with any
[10:25] spiritual understanding any humility any
[10:29] love for the word of God we recognize
[10:30] there's one name to the father Son and
[10:32] Holy Ghost that's the name of the Lord
[10:34] Jesus Christ and also acts 236 God has
[10:37] made the same Jesus whom you've
[10:39] crucified both Lord and Christ Lord
[10:42] Jesus Christ and also as I'll show you
[10:45] in my Bible there's a great difference
[10:47] between using titles father son holy
[10:49] ghost or titles versus the literal name
[10:51] of Jesus Christ I have five points in
[10:53] there I'll just go through these quickly
[10:54] I'll probably make an entire video on
[10:56] this but all the Miracles and water
[10:58] baptism in in the book of Acts were
[11:01] performed in Jesus's name none of them
[11:03] were performed in father son Holy Ghost
[11:06] titles second it's the Antichrist job to
[11:09] blaspheme the name of Jesus and they do
[11:11] that by changing his name to titles
[11:14] that's Revelation
[11:15] 136 third I have 14 historical
[11:18] references from dictionaries and Bible
[11:21] almanacs that say the early Apostles
[11:24] only use the literal name of Jesus
[11:25] Christ at baptism fourth my brother
[11:28] Simon heard a preacher preach this
[11:31] wonderful Revelation and then Simon
[11:32] expanded on it but he said King Saul was
[11:36] a type of the denominations and David
[11:39] was a type of Christ we can see that
[11:41] plainly but after King Saul got an evil
[11:44] spirit on him he changed the way he
[11:45] addressed David he no longer said the
[11:47] name of David he called David the son of
[11:49] Jesse so it's a beautiful type of how
[11:52] denominations reject the revelation of
[11:54] Jesus Christ they disrespect the name of
[11:56] Jesus Christ and they only use title
[11:59] father son Holy Ghost it's a beautiful
[12:01] teaching like I said I'll probably make
[12:02] a video on this by God's grace and then
[12:05] Fifth and finally one of the Mysteries
[12:07] of the Kingdom of Heaven was the woman
[12:09] hiding leav in three measures of barley
[12:13] in Matthew 13:33 and Luke
[12:15] 1321 and I believe it's plainly obvious
[12:19] that this is a parable of the false
[12:21] Church the Roman Catholic Church hiding
[12:23] the LIE of three persons in the godhead
[12:27] in other words the Roman Catholic Church
[12:29] in the early stages of their Church
[12:31] injected leevan or a lie about God
[12:34] related to the godhead they called him
[12:36] three persons they change the name to
[12:39] titles father son Holy Ghost I'd like to
[12:41] add a little more to the third question
[12:43] so let's read the third question by
[12:44] God's grace can someone who claims to be
[12:47] a prophet of God have prophecies and
[12:49] visions that have failed to come to pass
[12:52] so again the answer is no and I think
[12:54] what believe the sign and other accusers
[12:57] of brother brandom are trying to say is
[12:58] that they think brother brandham has had
[13:00] prophecies that have failed and of
[13:02] course that's not true what's happened
[13:04] is there was some prophecies that
[13:06] brother brandham wasn't sure about if
[13:08] they'd been fulfilled but the accusers
[13:10] of brother brandham have jumped to false
[13:12] conclusions they cannot prove these
[13:14] prophecies did not come to pass nor can
[13:16] I but I'm just giving the best answer
[13:19] that I can see the most logical the most
[13:21] spiritual answer I can see by the grace
[13:23] of God because we don't want to jump to
[13:25] false conclusions and again it's a sin
[13:28] to revive brother brandham it's a sin to
[13:30] slander brother brandham so regarding
[13:32] this question I want to speak a little
[13:34] more about Deuteronomy 18
[13:36] 20-22 of course these are inspired
[13:38] verses but believe the sign and other
[13:41] accusers of brother brandham are
[13:42] misunderstanding these verses it's just
[13:44] like Matthew 28:19 if you just take that
[13:47] one verse face value and you don't look
[13:50] at all the baptisms done in the book of
[13:51] Acts then you'll come to the false
[13:53] conclusion that we must baptize in the
[13:56] titles father son Holy Ghost same thing
[13:57] is true about the profit qualification
[14:00] for Deuteronomy 18
[14:02] 20-22 if you just take those verses face
[14:04] value you'll misapply them you'll Mis
[14:07] understand them and again I also
[14:09] addressed this on the 70-minute brown
[14:11] bear Vision Video so I'll leave a link
[14:12] to the description for that by God's
[14:14] grace you can watch that so there's two
[14:16] reasons believe the sign and other
[14:18] accusers misapply Deuteronomy 18
[14:22] 20-22 and I put this on the podcast the
[14:25] first reason is God stayed with brother
[14:27] brandham after brother brandham failed
[14:29] the brown bear Vision the vision didn't
[14:31] fail brother brandham failed the vision
[14:33] because it was a conditional promise of
[14:35] God after brother Bram failed the vision
[14:38] he still preached the Seven Seals with
[14:40] genuine Revelation from Jesus Christ he
[14:42] did not plagiarize them any honest
[14:44] person knows that God gave him thus sayi
[14:46] the Lord our marriage and divorce
[14:48] anointed ones at the end times and other
[14:51] super important Bible revelations by
[14:53] God's grace and the second point about
[14:56] Deuteronomy 18 20-22 is that it was a a
[14:59] conditional promise of God regarding
[15:01] brother brandham and the brown bear
[15:02] vision and here's where believe the sign
[15:04] and other accusers make their mistake if
[15:06] you apply Deuteronomy 18 20-22 to Isaiah
[15:10] when Isaiah said Hezekiah would die then
[15:13] Isaiah is a false prophet because he
[15:16] spoke something in the name of the Lord
[15:17] and it didn't come to pass so accusers
[15:20] of brother brandom are taking
[15:21] Deuteronomy 18 20-22 out of context they
[15:24] have to look at other scriptures about
[15:25] prophets and prophecies second if you
[15:28] apply de 18 20-22 to Jonah Jonah is a
[15:31] false prophet because he said Nineveh
[15:33] would be destroyed and it wasn't if you
[15:36] read the Book of Jonah Jonah never gives
[15:39] any conditional element to his prophecy
[15:41] that Nineveh was going to be destroyed
[15:43] and it's obvious Jonah was speaking the
[15:45] name of the Lord because the people of
[15:47] Nineveh humbled themselves and
[15:49] immediately repented and sought God so
[15:51] this means the Bible didn't record the
[15:53] conditional element of Jonah's warning
[15:55] but of course it was conditional Also
[15:57] regarding Deuteronomy 18 20-22 I want to
[16:00] make another statement we must be very
[16:02] careful how we interpret brother Brand's
[16:04] Visions just like any other Visions in
[16:06] the Bible if you apply the false
[16:09] understanding of believe the sign and
[16:11] other accusers of brother brandham about
[16:13] Deuteronomy 18: 20-22 their false
[16:17] understanding would make God a false
[16:19] prophet if you read First Kings
[16:22] 19: 15- 17 God told Elijah he'd anoint
[16:26] three people haziel juu and Elisha and
[16:30] any honest person knows he only anointed
[16:33] one of them that was of course Elisha in
[16:36] 2 Kings 2 9-15 so again believe the sign
[16:40] makes God a false prophet if they don't
[16:44] understand Deuteronomy 18 20- 22 has to
[16:47] be interpreted by the rest of the
[16:49] scripture and not just one set of
[16:52] isolated verses and again that's because
[16:55] God said Elijah would anoint three
[16:57] people he only anointed one so again
[16:59] this goes to this amazing Revelation
[17:01] that God can interpret his prophecies
[17:03] any way he wants heel was likely
[17:06] anointed by Elisha it seems in 2 Kings
[17:09] 8:
[17:10] 13-15 and it seems a son of a prophet
[17:13] anointed juu king in 2 Kings
[17:17] 91-113 so when we interpret brother
[17:19] bram's Visions we must keep First Kings
[17:21] 19 in mind we must put ourselves in the
[17:24] shoes of those who might have known
[17:26] Elijah's Prophecy from the Lord in First
[17:28] Kings 19
[17:29] we have to remember God could interpret
[17:31] the Visions any way he wants for example
[17:33] the vision of the 300,000 in India that
[17:36] could have been just in the brother
[17:38] Ram's 1954 Gatherings where the mayor of
[17:41] Bombay said there was half a million or
[17:44] it could have been fulfilled by other
[17:45] message preachers that went to India
[17:47] after brother Brandon went off the scene
[17:49] and collectively all those meetings
[17:51] would have produced
[17:53] 300,000 it's up to God but no doubt the
[17:56] vision came to pass either way it either
[17:58] came to pass through brother bram's trip
[17:59] there in 1954 or message preachers
[18:03] preaching there after brother Bram went
[18:05] off the scene that would match the Bible
[18:07] First Kings 19: 15-1 17 God can use
[18:11] other people to fulfill his prophecies
[18:14] and of course people like believe the
[18:15] sign or other accusers of brother random
[18:17] will probably mock me and make fun of me
[18:19] for that that's fine but I'm standing
[18:20] upon the word of God that is certainly a
[18:23] possibility I don't know for sure the
[18:24] interpretation but neither do the
[18:27] accusers of brother brandham they don't
[18:28] know for sure and if they say they do
[18:30] they're not telling the truth they're
[18:32] just presuming they're jumping to false
[18:34] conclusions so we have scripture on our
[18:36] side as message believers they don't
[18:38] they're misinterpreting the
[18:40] scriptures now in the final section of
[18:42] this video I just want to address a
[18:43] comment that was left on the part one of
[18:46] this series just this is just a two-part
[18:48] series it's from a person called Jeffrey
[18:51] Porter
[18:52] 4357 he left a very long comment and I
[18:55] appreciate long questions long
[18:57] testimonies or long comments in general
[18:59] but it just takes me a while to get back
[19:00] to them because of a busy schedule so
[19:02] I'll read through little parts of his
[19:04] comment and then reply he starts by
[19:07] saying quote there's a lot left to be
[19:08] desired in this rebuttal to the BTS
[19:11] questions and from someone who is
[19:13] genuinely hoping to see a qualified
[19:14] response it's disappointing end quote so
[19:17] my response is I'm sad to read this
[19:19] jeffre Porter but I said on my video I
[19:22] made a 70 minute long video addressing
[19:24] the brown bear vision and over 10 Bible
[19:27] verses about conditional and
[19:28] unconditional bible promises and
[19:30] prophecies did you watch that Jeffrey
[19:33] Porter but you know what's even more sad
[19:36] There is a ton to be desired concerning
[19:38] believe the signs teaching on the Seven
[19:40] Seals their research is the weakest
[19:43] shoddiest research I've ever seen so is
[19:46] the weak research from believe the sign
[19:47] due to their ignorance about what
[19:50] brother random taught about the Seven
[19:51] Seals or are they purposely trying to
[19:53] deceive those that are questioning the
[19:55] message also remember jeffre Porter 43
[19:58] 57 believe the sign says there's women
[20:01] Angels that's easily disproven because
[20:03] the women with stor Wings in Zechariah
[20:06] 59 were Babylon and Assyria exiling
[20:09] Israel to their lands and then believe
[20:12] the sign falsely said brother Brandon
[20:13] pretended to speak in tongues I have a
[20:15] video that clearly debunks that but will
[20:17] they take down their false videos their
[20:20] false teachings of course not and when
[20:22] is believe the sign or any of brother
[20:24] Ram's accusers going to respond to those
[20:25] truths there's no women Angels brother
[20:28] Ram didn't pretend to speak in tongues
[20:30] there's 38 differences between brother
[20:31] brandham and Lin and Charles Tes Russell
[20:34] on the Seven Seals what about the six
[20:37] thus sayith the Lords that have come to
[20:38] pass what about the 12 New Testament
[20:40] Mysteries brother R gave us six of which
[20:42] had thus sayith the Lord what about the
[20:44] eight thus sayith the Lord Pauline
[20:46] doctrines brother Ram gave us so see
[20:49] friends there's so much more to be
[20:50] desired from Brother Ram's accusers they
[20:53] ignore all the wonderful Bible truths
[20:55] and Revelations Jesus Christ revealed to
[20:57] brother brandom I've been genuinely
[20:59] waiting for replies on all these
[21:01] subjects along with anyone from the side
[21:04] of brother Ram's accusers who read my
[21:05] two books defending brother bram's Bible
[21:08] revelations but all I can do is wait on
[21:10] the accusers to have the courage to
[21:13] respond the next section of the question
[21:15] is quote First the prophet test is very
[21:17] sadly proven in Deuteronomy 18:20 you
[21:21] may have forgotten to include that in
[21:22] your list of five but scripture could
[21:24] not be more clear in establishing how to
[21:26] know if someone is a true prophet if
[21:28] someone proclaims in the name of the
[21:30] Lord that which does not come to pass
[21:31] then God did not say it and pay them no
[21:34] mind not well this prophecy was likely
[21:37] fulfilled at that time or may have come
[21:39] to pass at this time or this was a
[21:41] conditional promise end
[21:42] quote so my first statement is you're
[21:45] right I didn't list Deuteronomy 1820 on
[21:48] my list so I'm sorry about that for some
[21:50] reason I just forgot to list that I
[21:52] believe Deuteronomy 1820 is requirement
[21:54] but if Jeffrey looked at my list it's
[21:56] assumed because I listed on number five
[21:59] you have to have the anointing of the
[22:00] Holy Ghost for Supernatural signs and
[22:03] prophecies so of course I believe a
[22:05] genuine prophet of God has prophecies
[22:07] that came to pass brother brandom had at
[22:09] least six and as I said another message
[22:11] preacher or Pastor in the United States
[22:14] has a list of 10 more prophecies related
[22:16] to healings that he's working on
[22:18] hopefully he'll share those with me when
[22:19] he's done and again Jeffrey Porter as I
[22:22] said on the podcast and also on this
[22:24] video you make Isaiah and Jonah false
[22:27] prophets if you use your
[22:29] misunderstanding of Deuteronomy 18:20
[22:31] because both spoke in the name of the
[22:33] Lord and they didn't come to pass so
[22:35] this proves a lot of brothers accusers
[22:37] are ignorant of the other Bible verses
[22:39] about prophecies they major on
[22:40] Deuteronomy 18:20 but they forget all
[22:42] the other Bible verses like First Kings
[22:44] 19
[22:46] 15-17 which prove God can interpret his
[22:49] word in any way he wants the accusers of
[22:51] brother brandom make God a false prophet
[22:53] if they literally apply Deuteronomy
[22:55] 18:20 to God's promises for Elijah to
[22:58] anoint three people in First Kings 19:1
[23:01] 15-17 but true believers do not make God
[23:04] a liar the next part of the question is
[23:07] quote which leads into the underwhelming
[23:09] response regarding the number of William
[23:10] bram's prophecies which came true how
[23:13] can we not address that not a single
[23:15] prophecy on tape was recorded or
[23:16] mentioned before the event transpired
[23:18] end quote Jeffrey Porter 4357 friend I
[23:23] have a video with six thus say the Lords
[23:25] recorded before they came to pass and
[23:28] again another Pastor as 10 thus say the
[23:29] Lords regarding healings that came to
[23:31] pass before they manifested so of course
[23:34] I'll leave a link to that in the
[23:35] description to say there's no single
[23:38] prophecy brother Ram spoke beforehand is
[23:41] total ignorance so hopefully this person
[23:44] can watch that video by God's grace the
[23:46] next part of their comment is not even
[23:48] the 1933 prophecies are referred to on
[23:51] tape or in any print material before the
[23:53] 1950s this is extremely problematic
[23:56] particularly when so many tracks are
[23:58] available prior to 1947 that document
[24:00] the early days of his ministry there's a
[24:02] lengthly trail of material available
[24:05] published by William Brenham personally
[24:06] that leads all the way back to the time
[24:08] frame those prophecies allegedly were
[24:10] given that failed to mention any part of
[24:12] them equally concerning our statements
[24:15] on tape describing how the prophecies
[24:16] would be receiving updates by his team
[24:18] where's the scriptural precedence for
[24:20] amending prophecies end
[24:23] quote friend I did not put the 1933
[24:26] prophecies on my videos about fulfilled
[24:28] prophecies because I did not have proof
[24:30] they were recorded beforehand but that
[24:33] doesn't mean they were not genuine so
[24:35] again dear friend you're jumping to
[24:36] false conclusions you're just assuming
[24:38] that the prophecies were not spoken in
[24:40] 1933 but you don't know that cuz you
[24:42] weren't there for sure and next brother
[24:44] randam was not trying to amend
[24:46] prophecies if you read the quote about
[24:49] brother random saying he needs to revise
[24:51] his prophecies he meant get them ready
[24:53] to publish and also share in his
[24:56] upcoming Church age preaching series and
[24:58] the church age book this quote was from
[25:00] November 1960 just one month before he
[25:03] preached the seven Church ages series
[25:06] brother random said we're going to take
[25:07] some of these old prophecies and dig
[25:09] them out and revise them a little or
[25:11] bring them up to date and put them in
[25:13] papers I'd like to read some things that
[25:16] I'd like for you to to this one first
[25:19] I'd like to read something to you I'd
[25:21] like to read your prophecy that was
[25:23] given I got on uh and Man by the way Mr
[25:27] Mercer and many of them are go take some
[25:29] of these old prophecies and dig them out
[25:31] and revise them a little or bring them
[25:34] up to date uh and put them in papers I'd
[25:36] like to read some things that I'd like
[25:39] for you to um to
[25:42] um this one first I'd um like to read
[25:46] something to you brother random only
[25:48] used the word revised twice in the
[25:50] entire 18 years of sermons that are on
[25:53] tape so this was not a word brother Bram
[25:55] used very much so it's most likely he
[25:57] didn't understand the full meaning of it
[25:59] it seems brother man misused the word
[26:01] revise and probably meant revisit he was
[26:03] going to revisit the old prophecies in
[26:05] order to get them ready to
[26:08] print okay the next part of this
[26:10] question was quote concerning
[26:11] progressive revelation how can that
[26:13] reconcile with William brandom's use of
[26:15] thus say the Lord throughout the
[26:17] entirety of his ministry can we simply
[26:19] wave off each contradiction from one use
[26:21] of the phrase to another by classifying
[26:23] it as growth in the ministry does God
[26:26] contradict his own word while in the
[26:27] process of revealing more truth end
[26:31] quote first of all friend progressive
[26:33] revelation is seen in Paul's life Martin
[26:35] Luther's life Abraham and more look at
[26:38] the Ephesians in Acts 18- 19 they
[26:40] received progressive revelation they had
[26:42] John's baptism and then the next chapter
[26:44] they get the baptism for the holy ghost
[26:46] from St Paul friend brother Ram's use of
[26:49] thus say the Lord throughout his entire
[26:50] Ministry was perfect I've never seen one
[26:53] of his thus sayith the Lord's fail or
[26:55] contradict any other thus sayith the
[26:56] Lord's statement now of course there are
[26:59] contradictions in brother bram's
[27:01] doctrinal statements as he grew in
[27:03] Revelation like on the White Horse Rider
[27:05] the first seal because originally he
[27:07] taught it was the Holy Spirit but his
[27:09] last teaching on it with thus sayith the
[27:11] Lord was it was the Antichrist so in
[27:14] that case the thus sayth the Lord
[27:15] statement is the accurate one and just
[27:18] shows he grew in Revelation from the 50s
[27:20] to 1963 regarding the Seven Seals and of
[27:24] course the first seal in the white horse
[27:25] rider there are no contradictions on the
[27:28] say the Lord statements that were
[27:29] literal prophecies in other words when
[27:31] brother Brandon was speaking that thus
[27:33] sayith the Lord for the first time I'm
[27:35] not referring to when brother Brandon
[27:36] was trying to remember the details of
[27:38] prophecies I'm talking about only the
[27:40] literal moment of the original first
[27:43] prophecy there were no contradictions
[27:45] with those
[27:48] prophecies okay the next part is quote
[27:50] the last concern our voice regarding
[27:51] your response pertains to the scriptural
[27:53] need for a gentile Prophet one thing I
[27:56] noticed when I made efforts to study the
[27:57] Bible without without only message
[28:00] glasses on was that the Book of Malachi
[28:02] quite clearly begins with the heading it
[28:05] was the word of the Lord to Israel
[28:07] imagine my added surprise to learn that
[28:09] Malachi 3 and 4 were not originally
[28:11] written as separate texts divided into
[28:13] two chapters and the shock of realizing
[28:15] that it suddenly made a lot more sense
[28:17] with what Jesus said concerning John the
[28:19] Baptist fulfillment of that scripture
[28:22] adding the word Apostolic to the text to
[28:23] make it fit the message translation is
[28:25] still adding to the word the rest of
[28:28] restation of Hearts referred to Malachi
[28:29] Was the removal of the need for Old
[28:31] Testament Prophet intercessors made
[28:33] possible by the sacrifice on Calvary
[28:34] that allowed for all to have direct
[28:37] communication with God once again just
[28:38] like Adam had in the Garden of Eden you
[28:40] even mentioned it yourself in this video
[28:43] the holy spirit will lead you and guide
[28:44] you to all truth that is the restoration
[28:46] described in Malachi end
[28:49] quote okay so first yes Malachi begins
[28:53] with addressing Israel but there's
[28:54] numerous Old Testament books addressed
[28:56] to Israel yet they contain promises to
[28:58] Gentiles this is a very weak argument to
[29:02] try to take brother brandham out of
[29:03] Malachi 4:5 and6 let's take one example
[29:07] Isaiah 1:1 says the word is for Judah
[29:10] and Jerusalem but if you go to Isaiah
[29:12] 25:8 it speaks of the Gentile Rapture
[29:15] because it says death will be swallowed
[29:17] up in Victory Paul quoted this scripture
[29:20] from Isaiah 258 in 1 Corinthians
[29:24] 15:54 which was for Gentiles that were
[29:28] going to be raptured so Paul says the
[29:30] New Testament Church contains both Jew
[29:32] and Gentile in Ephesians 2: 11- 24 so
[29:36] that example right there from Isaiah
[29:38] totally disproves this comment from
[29:40] Jeffrey Porter
[29:42] 4357 and again this shows how God can
[29:44] interpret his word any way he
[29:47] wants and I want to say no the
[29:50] restoration of the hearts was for the
[29:52] end of the church ages because the
[29:53] Turning of the hearts of the fathers to
[29:55] the children was fulfilled by John the
[29:57] Baptist according Accord to Luke
[29:59] 1:17 that is the scripture that you're
[30:02] ignoring dear friend John turned the
[30:04] hearts of the fathers to the children
[30:06] this means John turned the hearts of the
[30:09] Believers at Jesus first coming to have
[30:12] a burden for the Believers at Jesus
[30:14] second coming that's the only
[30:16] interpretation that makes sense now we
[30:19] say the word to the apostolic fathers to
[30:22] help give understanding to make it more
[30:24] simple or concise and of course I know
[30:26] the word Apostolic is not in Malachi 4:6
[30:30] but we know John turned the hearts of
[30:31] the fathers to the children which must
[30:33] be the Believers at the first coming of
[30:35] Christ according to Luke
[30:37] 1:17 and then another Elijah had to come
[30:40] to turn the hearts of the Believers at
[30:42] the second coming of Christ back to the
[30:44] hearts of the Believers at the first
[30:46] coming of
[30:47] Christ this is the only logical
[30:49] explanation of Luke 1:17 and remember
[30:52] there's no other verse in the Bible that
[30:54] states the literal phrase turning the
[30:56] hearts of the children to to the Fathers
[30:59] as it's spoken of in Malachi 4:6 so
[31:02] there must be some fulfillment of that
[31:04] second part of Malachi 4:6 turning the
[31:07] hearts of the children to the fathers
[31:10] and so it must be the Elijah to restore
[31:13] all things as Jesus said in Matthew
[31:15] 17:11 it must be Revelation 10:7
[31:18] finishing the mystery of God the Turning
[31:20] of the hearts of the fathers to the
[31:23] children is putting the burden on the
[31:25] Believers at Jesus first coming to help
[31:28] prepare the Saints at Jesus second
[31:30] coming to be ready for Jesus's return
[31:33] the
[31:36] Rapture and finally the last section of
[31:38] this comment is quote apologies for such
[31:40] a long response I watch this video with
[31:42] genuine interest and hope that valid
[31:44] counterpoints were going to be made but
[31:46] there's a considerable amount of dancing
[31:47] around certain scriptures and topics
[31:49] here it's unclear whether this is
[31:52] intentional or in good faith defense for
[31:54] all you've ever only known what I'll say
[31:58] is this our savior warned us against
[32:00] false prophets who would arise in great
[32:02] signs and wonders and deceive the very
[32:03] elect if it were possible the prophet
[32:06] test of Deuteronomy 18:20 is so
[32:08] important in recognizing whether we are
[32:09] being cleverly duped just like Eve who
[32:12] calls the fall of humans with one word
[32:15] being added williiam Mar and brandham
[32:17] added many words to scripture such as
[32:19] the word ages in church ages does not
[32:22] take an elite Revelation to grasp the
[32:24] Simplicity of this beautiful gospel
[32:25] which clearly instructs us against
[32:28] adding to the word God bless you sir end
[32:32] quote okay well I'd say God bless you
[32:34] sir as well but let me say when I listen
[32:37] to the accusers of brother brandom
[32:39] whether believe the sign or other
[32:42] podcasts and videos I have a genuine
[32:43] interest to see if they will show honest
[32:45] research and honest conclusions but I'm
[32:48] almost always disappointed by especially
[32:51] their weak shoddy research and false
[32:53] conclusions and assumptions false
[32:56] assumptions that they jump to in order
[32:58] it seems like they're trying to revile
[33:00] brother brandham or slander brother
[33:02] brandham and make him to be a false
[33:04] prophet when he's not a false prophet
[33:05] he's a true prophet and jeffre Porter
[33:08] Dear Sir you and the accusers are the
[33:10] ones dancing around all the Bible proofs
[33:13] that brother Brandon was a prophet like
[33:15] I listed above the 12 New Testament
[33:17] Mysteries the six fulfilled thus say the
[33:20] Lord's statements I've written two books
[33:22] about brother Ram's Ministry I have over
[33:23] 200 videos 70 podcasts and it seems all
[33:27] the accusers brother brandham just
[33:28] ignore the Bible proofs that I share so
[33:31] the accusers of brother brandom are the
[33:33] ones dancing around the scriptural proof
[33:35] and prophetic proof that brother
[33:36] brandham was a genuine prophet of God
[33:38] dear friend brother brandham never
[33:40] deceived us he pointed us to Jesus
[33:42] Christ he said Jesus Christ is the
[33:44] absolute of course many around brother
[33:47] Brandon fell into sin and idolatry but
[33:49] that's exactly what happened in Jesus's
[33:50] day of course any day whether it's
[33:53] Luther's day Luther said he hoped 10% of
[33:56] his people were saved but but brother
[33:58] William Maran brandham was a faithful
[34:00] Bible prophet and dear friend I believe
[34:03] humbly I'm saying this you are clearly
[34:05] duped on Deuteronomy 18:20 because
[34:08] you're potentially making Isaiah Jonah
[34:10] and even God himself false prophets
[34:12] because they all either spoke in the
[34:14] name of the Lord or they were the Lord
[34:15] speaking and what they said did not come
[34:18] to pass or in God's case what God told
[34:21] Elijah to do Elijah didn't do all of it
[34:23] he only did onethird of what God told
[34:25] him to do and dear friend no brother
[34:27] brandom wasn't like Eve humbly you and
[34:30] the accusers I believe are more like Eve
[34:33] because you're accepting God as three
[34:34] persons with no Bible for that you're
[34:36] letting women cut their hair with no
[34:38] Bible for that God never asked a Godly
[34:40] woman to cut her hair and Friends it
[34:42] seems like a lot of accusers of brother
[34:44] brandham are either ignorantly or
[34:46] purposely slandering brother brandham
[34:48] who was a forgiven Son of God a child of
[34:51] God by the blood of Jesus Christ and
[34:54] they're denying the true research about
[34:55] the Seven Seals and so many more topics
[34:58] regarding the church ages also I can say
[35:00] as Mercy friend you're very deceived on
[35:03] the word ages go watch my video about
[35:06] our church ages scriptural of course
[35:09] this again shows people's ignorance
[35:11] especially they're ignorant to the King
[35:12] James Bible the King James version uses
[35:15] ages many times Paul says there's ages
[35:17] of the past and there's ages in the
[35:19] future so that means there's always ages
[35:22] and of course this is the age of the
[35:23] Gentiles so we can replace Gentiles with
[35:26] a church because we're part of the
[35:27] church church so Church ages Gentile
[35:30] ages they're synonymous so anyone that
[35:33] says the church ages aren't in the Bible
[35:35] they're just ignorant of the Bible and
[35:37] lastly friend I'd say you are the ones
[35:39] adding to the word of God the accuser
[35:41] brother brandham because they say women
[35:43] can wear makeup they can paint their
[35:45] faces they can cut their hair they can
[35:47] have non-binary relationships they can
[35:50] watch Dracula and other sinful rated R
[35:52] movies they can listen to Bon joy and
[35:54] all kinds of wicked rock and roll songs
[35:56] they can get tatto tattoos and go to
[35:58] tattoo parlors and apparently they say
[36:00] it's not sinful but of course all these
[36:02] things are sinful so dear friend I hope
[36:05] you'll stop adding to the word of God I
[36:07] hope you'll reach out to these accusers
[36:08] of brother brandham that support all
[36:09] these sinful acts and dear friend are
[36:12] you speaking out against those that's my
[36:14] question to you we're not adding to the
[36:16] word as message Believers at least our
[36:17] church isn't I know some do but they'll
[36:20] be judged for that hopefully they'll
[36:21] repent of it so dear friend why don't
[36:23] you speak out against those false
