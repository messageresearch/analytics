[0:00] listen this now who against
[0:04] hope against hope all hopes is
[0:08] gone oh every time I go feeling little
[0:11] blue here's the chapter I turn to Romans
[0:15] 4 as it is written I have made thee a
[0:18] father of Nations before him who he
[0:21] believed even God who Quicken the dead
[0:23] and call those things which were not as
[0:25] though they
[0:26] were God said soise the Lord who against
[0:30] hope believed in hope that he might
[0:32] become the father of Nations according
[0:35] to that which is spoken so shall thy
[0:37] seed be now listen 19th verse and being
[0:40] not weak in faith he considered not his
[0:43] own body now dead when he was about a
[0:46] hundred years old neither the deadness
[0:49] of Sarah's womb he staggered not the
[0:51] promise of God through unbelief but was
[0:53] strong giving glory to
[0:57] God
[0:58] now uh uh we are very grateful that we
[1:03] still have a kind heavenly father who
[1:05] who looks over our mistakes and doesn't
[1:08] reckon them to us I was reading over in
[1:12] the book of of Romans the fourth chapter
[1:15] where Paul uh wrote The U the Divine
[1:20] commentary of the life of Abraham now we
[1:24] know that Abraham many times got kind of
[1:27] frustrated like we do but when the his
[1:30] commentary was written it wasn't any of
[1:32] his frustrations mentioned see never
[1:35] mentioned him at all said Abraham
[1:37] staggered not the promise of God through
[1:39] unbelief but was strong giving praise to
[1:42] God see and that's why I hope mine be
[1:45] wrote up there is not my mistakes and
[1:49] everything but just the what I tried to
[1:51] do the intention of my heart to do for
[1:54] God's people
[1:55] and if we notice he couldn't teach the
[1:58] Corinthians deep things
[2:00] they were just uh a a baby
[2:04] fashioned they they he couldn't go to
[2:06] them in the great deep the messages that
[2:10] he did to the Ephesians and he did to
[2:12] the Romans and teach to them the Deep
[2:15] things because they wasn't able to take
[2:17] it they they depended too much up on
[2:20] little Sensations and little uh things
[2:22] like that just well praise the Lord I
[2:25] got it I had a a revelation come to me I
[2:28] had a Psalm I have a prophecy
[2:30] Paul said all these things will fail see
[2:34] every one of them they're just not to be
[2:36] trusted too much and um so but what he's
[2:40] trying to get to the church was that
[2:43] anchor where we uh where we have an
[2:47] anchor in Christ where that we don't
[2:50] trust upon Sensations we don't trust
[2:53] upon Revelations we don't trust these
[2:55] things only We Trust Christ it's by
[2:58] faith that we move out there just
