[18:14] doing real good by god's grace
[18:16] let's pray for my wife and the baby i
[18:18] haven't heard anything about my dad so
[18:20] no news is good news um and i was just

[19:22] about her she's
[19:23] been healed numerous times brother
[19:25] brooks says they're still believing for
[19:26] a miracle and
[19:27] sister ruby doesn't believe it's her
[19:29] time to go home i appreciate that faith
[19:32] let's just pray let's ask god to be
[19:33] merciful we've seen a couple people come
[19:35] out of hospice

[19:40] testimonies

[25:24] the promise of god for this hour
[25:26] and it's not just thus saith ourselves

[25:49] tate boys are not in the five full
[25:50] ministry brother ram said they're a
[25:51] secondary ministry
[25:53] he said the highest form of
[25:54] communicating is live preachers but
[25:57] says that tate boys are secondary
[25:59] ministry they have their part
[26:01] but the highest communication is god
[26:03] anointing his fivefold ministry
[26:05] to preach to his wife joel 2.
[26:12] i still haven't heard back from uh
[26:14] jeffersonville so i'm kind of waiting on
[26:16] that

[26:18] six months for my email so
[26:21] they had patience with me i could have
[26:22] really kindness with them
[26:24] patience with them by the grace of the
[26:26] lord
[26:31] now just for time's sake uh i'm just
[26:34] going to read verse
[26:35] 23 because don't forget though verse 25
[26:38] i'll restore to you the years all those
[26:40] years
[26:42] that the denominations were stealing
[26:43] away the anointing i said killing the
[26:45] anointing
[26:46] god remembered all those years and he's
[26:48] going to restore all those years
[26:49] praise god verse 23 let's read that
[26:52] together

[27:24] uh different stages of the same insect
[27:27] different stages of the antichrist
[27:28] spirit okay let's go to our memory verse
[27:31] matthew 6. what a great scripture for
[27:34] this coveted
[27:35] pestilence that we're living in that if
[27:37] we seek god
[27:38] first everything else will be added unto
[27:40] us amen i'm a witness of that praise god
[27:44] as i see god he supplies everything
[27:47] got a little testimony i'll share it
[27:49] hopefully during the preaching i'll wait
[27:50] till the holy spirit brings it out
[27:55] i was just feeling sorry for myself and
[27:57] again i was gonna complain to god and
[27:58] then god had a great testimony for us on
[28:00] saturday
[28:01] so i have to share that one here i may
[28:04] wait till live streams off so
[28:06] god is good i tell you god is just so
[28:07] merciful made me weep and cry god is so
[28:09] gracious
[28:10] uh matthew 6 30 let's read 39-34
[28:14] on three one two three wherefore if god
[28:17] so clothed the grass of the field
[28:20] which today is and tomorrow is cast
[28:23] into the oven shall he not much more
[28:26] clothe you
[28:27] o ye of little faith therefore take no
[28:31] thought say what shall we eat or what
[28:34] shall we drink
[28:35] or wherewith all shall we be clothed for
[28:38] after all these things do the gentiles
[28:40] seek
[28:41] for your heavenly father knoweth that ye
[28:44] have need of
[28:45] all these things but seek ye first the
[28:48] kingdom of god
[28:49] and his righteousness and all these
[28:51] things shall be added unto you
[28:54] take therefore no thought for the morrow
[28:56] for the morrow shall take
[28:58] thought for the things of itself
[29:00] sufficient unto the day
[29:02] is the evil thereof may god add his
[29:04] blessings to ring of his word you may be
[29:06] seated praise god
[29:07] i'll write that down two testimonies at
[29:09] the end
[29:23] okay praise the lord okay can you switch
[29:25] over please malcolm thank you sir
[29:29] now kind of as i said i was talking with
[29:30] brother amen and
[29:33] he just had all these great questions
[29:35] about the rapture and the latter rain
[29:37] and
[29:37] so it made me brother amen as i was
[29:39] thinking about that
[29:41] it brought this quote to me it's from
[29:43] christ as the mystery of god is revealed
[29:45] you know what i
[29:46] just go to that then you can see it
[29:52] yeah so let me just start with this and
[29:54] lord willing sunday maybe i'll pick up
[29:56] on this lord willing
[29:58] um but this quote came to my mind after
[30:00] brother amen
[30:02] uh and i were talking christ the mystery
[30:04] god revealed this is a three hour sermon
[30:05] by the way
[30:06] it's i've never i don't think i've
[30:08] preached this whole thing
[30:11] remember a couple years ago i was
[30:12] preaching like one sermon just all the
[30:13] way through
[30:14] i don't think i preached this one i
[30:16] don't think so
[30:17] i'd like to well the graham said god's
[30:19] great mystery of how it's a secret he
[30:21] kept it in a secret nobody knows nothing
[30:23] about it even the angels didn't
[30:24] understand it
[30:25] see he didn't reveal it that's the
[30:27] reason i talk about the rapture
[30:29] under our seventh mystery when the
[30:30] seventh seal was opened there was
[30:32] silence
[30:33] right revelation 8 1. jesus when he was
[30:36] on the earth they wanted to know when he
[30:38] would come he said it's not even the son
[30:40] himself don't know what's going to
[30:41] happen remember he said
[30:42] the day or the hour knoweth no man not
[30:45] even the son not even the angels but the
[30:47] father only
[30:48] see god has this all to himself it's a
[30:50] secret and that's the reason there was
[30:52] silence in heaven for the space of an
[30:53] hour
[30:54] and the seven thunders uttered their
[30:55] voices and john was even forbidden to
[30:57] write it see
[30:58] the coming of the lord that's one thing
[31:00] he hasn't revealed yet
[31:02] of how he will come and when he will
[31:04] come
[31:05] it's a good thing that he doesn't now
[31:07] here's the here's what came to me
[31:09] as i was just meditating this week and
[31:10] listening to these sermons about the
[31:12] rapture
[31:13] but iran said he showed it or revealed
[31:15] it in
[31:16] every type that's in the bible you get
[31:20] that
[31:20] the seventh seal the coming of the lord
[31:23] is in almost
[31:24] every type in the bible now that's quite
[31:28] a statement
[31:31] therefore the entire bible is the
[31:33] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[31:37] now i i not personally this is my
[31:39] thought i don't believe
[31:40] every single type in the bible is about
[31:42] the rapture right
[31:44] personally so like i said you know
[31:48] like joseph revealing himself to his
[31:50] brother and that doesn't type the
[31:51] rapture now that's right after the
[31:52] rapture
[31:54] but see that doesn't type the rapture
[31:56] that types 144 000. so
[31:58] i think you understand what i'm saying
[32:00] now there could be a case made though
[32:03] that all even that type is related to
[32:06] the rapture right
[32:07] or related to the coming of the lord uh
[32:09] the tribulation
[32:10] right before the armageddon coming of
[32:12] the lord so there's a
[32:14] there's there's a way it could it could
[32:16] be right
[32:18] he said hum the entire bible is an
[32:20] expression of one goal god had one
[32:22] purpose he wanted to achieve
[32:23] all the acts of the believers in the
[32:25] bible has been in type
[32:27] expressing what god's great goal is and
[32:29] now in this last day he's revealed it
[32:31] and shows it
[32:32] and god's help well you'll see right
[32:34] here this morning what the lord has had
[32:35] in his mind all along
[32:37] and expressed it and you remember if
[32:38] you've heard preaching over the last
[32:41] 20 years like i have there's brother
[32:43] adam said in this sermon god has a
[32:45] threefold purpose
[32:46] so the whole bible is about these three
[32:48] purposes to get preeminence in his son
[32:50] which he did to get preeminence in the
[32:52] bride the gentile bride
[32:54] and then to restore eden right the new
[32:56] jerusalem
[32:57] okay so that's the kind of thinking that
[33:00] was coming to me this week
[33:01] uh as i was meditating on those thoughts
[33:03] now let's get back to the beginning here
[33:04] so i just want to preach just a few
[33:06] sermons on this lord willing
[33:08] um on returning to pentecost and
[33:11] returning to heaven
[33:13] okay uh and that my sub topic is the
[33:15] seven seals typed all through the bible
[33:17] so
[33:18] well lord willing we'll get to that
[33:19] maybe sunday and show how there's all
[33:21] the
[33:22] church all these women in the bible they
[33:24] all type the bride
[33:26] whether they're jew or gentile there's a
[33:27] way that all these women i mean you can
[33:30] look at
[33:30] eve even eve right she typed the second
[33:33] eve right the bride how she fell away
[33:35] but she'll be restored amen i mean you
[33:38] can take it with almost
[33:39] every woman in the entire bible and i
[33:42] love how brother just
[33:43] he says these things and they blow our
[33:44] minds but as we study the bible we find
[33:47] out that's exactly right
[33:49] he didn't have the education to say it
[33:51] so neatly like doctors
[33:52] but it but as we as we get under the
[33:54] anointing of the holy spirit we see what
[33:56] he's talking about praise god
[33:58] it goes back to the word now that was
[34:00] our text that's our vision
[34:01] and that's why i put it up here the
[34:03] bible said well there's no vision that
[34:04] people perish
[34:05] but he that keeps the law happy as he so
[34:07] look the word
[34:09] is the vision amen see they connect with
[34:12] no
[34:12] vision you perish but with the law you
[34:15] live
[34:16] so the law the word is the vision praise
[34:18] god
[34:19] so we ought to see the vision for our
[34:20] day now this vision means i like this
[34:22] divine communication if there's no
[34:25] divine thus saith the lord
[34:27] the people perish and that's right right
[34:29] if you reject mother's ministry
[34:31] without thus say the lord they'll perish
[34:33] in the tribulation
[34:34] now they might be saved right foolish
[34:36] virgin we're talking about
[34:38] but if they neglect the divine
[34:40] communication
[34:41] of the of the holy spirit through god's
[34:44] prophet
[34:44] they'll perish in the tribulation that's
[34:47] right church it is
[34:48] it has to be it was always that way now
[34:51] i love this i preached on this years ago
[34:53] uh man probably three four years ago
[34:56] habakkuk now remember chapter one is
[34:57] habakkuk he's complaining
[34:59] amen he's a prophet he's complaining
[35:01] he's like how are these
[35:02] uh sinners not judged and he's
[35:04] complaining to god
[35:05] and so god starts talking like this he
[35:07] said i will stand up or this is habakkuk
[35:09] i will stand upon my watch
[35:11] and set me upon the tower and we'll
[35:12] watch to see what he will say unto me so
[35:14] he complains on the first chapter
[35:16] and he says i'm going to stand the tower
[35:18] and see what god will answer to me
[35:20] and what i shall answer when i am
[35:22] reproved and the lord answered me and
[35:24] said
[35:24] write the vision so he's going to give
[35:26] him a vision and make it plain upon
[35:28] tables
[35:29] that he may run that readeth it amen
[35:32] what does it tell you church it tells
[35:34] you that when god gives you his word
[35:36] he wants you to be aggressive with it
[35:38] amen when god gives you a word
[35:40] he wants you to run with it he doesn't
[35:42] want you to be lazy he wants you to run
[35:44] with it praise god
[35:46] he wants in other words he wants you to
[35:47] actively
[35:49] work upon the the prophecy that he's
[35:51] given the divine communication praise
[35:53] god
[35:54] run with it in other words go tell
[35:56] somebody praise god
[35:57] go tell them amen make it known try to
[36:00] encourage somebody
[36:01] as you're running the race for christ
[36:03] amen
[36:07] he said make it plain upon the tables
[36:09] that he may run
[36:10] that readeth it so when god delivers his
[36:12] word
[36:13] divine word he wants you to run with it
[36:15] praise god that's what that's what the
[36:17] bible says we're doing
[36:18] running the race with what perseverance
[36:20] and patience amen
[36:22] we're patient we know the rapture is
[36:24] soon to come but we're patient we can
[36:25] wait next week
[36:26] if it's next week we can wait next year
[36:28] if it's next year
[36:29] god forbid we can wait if it's 10 more
[36:31] years but what if it's 50 years
[36:34] i'm thinking about that this week milly
[36:36] man you with white hair
[36:38] i see what will amen look like if he's
[36:39] sung leader with white hair what will i
[36:41] look like if my hair falls out
[36:43] because i look at i look at preachers
[36:45] brother amen that now they were younger
[36:47] but now they're older and all their hair
[36:48] fell
[36:48] out but yeah are they patient yes
[36:51] they're still running the race praise
[36:53] god they're still willing to wait praise
[36:55] god
[36:56] right because outwardly we might perish
[36:58] but inwardly we're renewed day by day
[37:01] praise god hallelujah
[37:04] so he said write it that you may run we
[37:07] got to have patience with the word
[37:09] he said for the vision is yet see every
[37:12] vision has a time
[37:13] amen it's got a time and you and i can't
[37:17] do any all we can do is run
[37:19] until it's time for that that vision
[37:21] that we're reading
[37:22] we just gotta run with that and just
[37:24] write until it's time this is the time
[37:26] that it's fulfilled praise god remember
[37:29] brothers at the rapture
[37:30] he said i won't be one second late amen
[37:33] it'll be right on time amen we just got
[37:36] to be patient and run
[37:38] but at the end it shall speak praise god
[37:42] to see when god gives a word it may not
[37:44] feel like it's speaking right then
[37:45] but just keep running keep laboring and
[37:48] then god will
[37:49] thunder from heaven amen amen hallelujah
[37:52] praise god
[37:53] it will speak it won't lie i'm so glad
[37:57] god doesn't lie amen
[37:59] his word through his prophet is the
[38:01] truth and god does not lie to us
[38:04] amen i've never seen it fail now i've
[38:06] seen my discipline i've been
[38:07] disappointed
[38:08] but i've never seen god fail amen
[38:11] see because it all depends on his time
[38:12] and season
[38:14] though at terry wait for it see wait
[38:16] church because it will surely come
[38:19] it will not tarry now this man what let
[38:21] me look at this
[38:25] habakkuk let me look at a backup real
[38:26] quick what year was this oh it's 6
[38:28] 26 uh this was oh this was a hundred
[38:32] years
[38:33] or more before ezra nehemiah and esther
[38:35] and malachi all came
[38:38] and and he's just asking for judgment
[38:40] upon uh the sinners
[38:43] and so his vision was still he wasn't
[38:45] even going to live to see it
[38:46] the church would you be happy in the
[38:48] message if you didn't live to see the
[38:49] rapture
[38:50] yes i'd be happy because i'd rather be
[38:53] in the house of the lord
[38:54] one day than a thousand days with the
[38:56] wicked amen with the tenth of the wicked
[38:58] i'd rather be here if i don't see it so
[39:01] maybe my sons will my dog
[39:03] my sons i can say that now my sons and
[39:05] my daughters will see him praise god
[39:08] amen gee it don't matter he said you
[39:11] just got to believe it
[39:12] this didn't happen for a hundred years
[39:14] but it's gonna happen
[39:16] wait for it praise god because i say
[39:19] like this
[39:20] we may not we may not see like uh the
[39:23] bride's revival like we want to
[39:25] but but it's coming but for sure
[39:28] we can see the world turning into sodom
[39:30] and gomorrah right
[39:31] and if we know sodom and gomorrah and
[39:33] noah's conditions are
[39:34] happening then we know we're ripening
[39:37] too praise god
[39:38] if they're if they're ripening and it's
[39:41] time to bundle them
[39:42] that we can see ourselves ripening as
[39:44] well
[39:46] absolutely praise god but it's all about
[39:48] our expectation right it's all about
[39:50] it's all about what are we expecting we
[39:52] got to expect what the word says
[39:54] and we got to be patient praise god it
[39:57] will come it won't be one second late it
[39:59] won't terry one second
[40:02] behold his soul which is lifted up is
[40:05] not upright see don't get prideful
[40:07] don't think you well i'll start the
[40:09] rapture
[40:11] no you're not unless god calls you to do
[40:13] it right
[40:14] but answer the rapture go from church to
[40:16] church you know
[40:18] it'll be like a wildfire but let's not
[40:20] be prideful let's just be
[40:21] serving god let's be so consecrated that
[40:24] god
[40:24] can use us in the rapture revival praise
[40:27] god that we can be
[40:28] but i love this i love this right here
[40:30] this is where martin luther got it to
[40:31] the
[40:31] just shall live by faith but listen to
[40:34] church
[40:35] see faith isn't what you think faith is
[40:37] you looking at the table
[40:39] and running and reading the vision
[40:41] praise god
[40:42] so faith is just believing what god
[40:45] wrote praise god
[40:46] we just got to say what the word says in
[40:49] order to say what brother brandon said
[40:51] when it lines up with the word and just
[40:53] keep rest and that is faith
[40:55] is trusting in god's word faith is
[40:57] assurance we're assured in what god has
[40:59] told us with us say the lord
[41:01] amen absolutely
[41:05] praise god
[41:09] see so see that's our vision
[41:12] we just got to wait in god's appointed
[41:15] time he'll do it
[41:17] now how many of us how many of us would
[41:19] honestly say like in the last 10 years
[41:20] you were ready for the rapture you were
[41:22] so on fire
[41:25] you had everything you had every devil
[41:28] under your feet who could say that
[41:31] right none of us none of us would say
[41:33] we're that ready right and then
[41:35] and but in god's eyes you know we see
[41:37] our affairs but in god's eyes he sees
[41:39] the whole world
[41:40] and he sees people that want the truth
[41:42] but it hasn't got to them yet
[41:43] amen because he's he's inspiring this
[41:45] person to be a missionary or expire
[41:47] inspiring that person to go preach to
[41:49] them and you know he's doing
[41:50] the the great commission praise god we
[41:53] just see ourselves but really we're not
[41:55] ready
[41:56] god will get us ready and god will save
[41:58] every last soul
[41:59] that wants to go to the marriage supper
[42:01] that i am amen amen remember he told
[42:03] that parable he said
[42:04] my house shall be full every chair
[42:07] every chair at that long table brother
[42:10] said we'll be filled amen
[42:12] and then jesus will serve us oh
[42:13] communion
[42:15] on oh every seat everything will be
[42:18] filled
[42:18] there won't be one person missing on
[42:20] that day praise god
[42:21] and god's got great patience for his
[42:23] harvest remember james
[42:25] james says that james 3 says that i
[42:28] don't have it on here
[42:29] now i'm going over the return to heaven
[42:31] quickly because it's not my main topic
[42:34] right you mean what do you mean return
[42:36] to heaven what i mean is that we were
[42:38] chosen in him before the foundation
[42:39] world so
[42:40] you and i came from the mind of god
[42:42] right that's what i'm saying
[42:44] but we got to return to pentecost first
[42:46] everyone the full bride every member has
[42:48] to return to pentecost so say like this
[42:50] we're there like some of us are there
[42:52] we're just waiting for everybody else to
[42:53] get there praise god
[42:54] right right praise god we're just wait
[42:57] if you've been born again
[42:59] then brother man said if you've been
[43:00] born again you can take somebody back to
[43:02] pentecost
[43:03] amen amen glory and we're waiting for
[43:07] all the bride members to get to
[43:09] pentecost
[43:09] so they can have that experience so they
[43:11] can be a witness amen
[43:13] so they can have the power and be endued
[43:15] with power from on high
[43:18] amen i'm willing to wait till my
[43:20] children get it till they act like me or
[43:22] somewhere close to me
[43:23] they have to be as fanatical as me but
[43:25] they gotta know what it's like
[43:26] to be on the day of pentecost amen i'll
[43:29] wait praise god i'll keep waiting
[43:31] i'm trusting that's gonna happen with
[43:32] all of our children all the children
[43:34] that come here
[43:35] we gotta trust and believe that they'll
[43:36] have the same experience we had like
[43:38] what sister naomi said when
[43:39] how old were you your 13 sister when you
[43:41] had that experience of
[43:43] maybe 12 i think it was like 12 or 13. i
[43:46] want to
[43:46] i want to see some of that happen to the
[43:48] children where they come to church and
[43:49] we got to carry them out because they're
[43:50] just crying or
[43:52] weeping or rejoicing we need to pray for
[43:54] that amen
[43:55] that's the same god hallelujah that's
[43:57] visited us
[43:58] the same god wants to do it to more of
[44:00] us and and more of us want to have it
[44:02] hallelujah
[44:03] amen it can happen at 12. look at that i
[44:05] mean my
[44:07] god our god is more than able praise god
[44:10] see remember god has to work with your
[44:12] will he can't force our children or he
[44:14] can't force us
[44:15] uh the adults that need the holy ghost
[44:16] he can't do that so he's got to wait
[44:18] until we're ready he's got to get us in
[44:20] condition
[44:21] and there's got to be we just got to be
[44:22] patient amen
[44:24] got to be patient we see we'll return to
[44:27] heaven
[44:28] see now the bible says we know that if
[44:30] our earthly house of this tabernacle be
[44:32] dissolved
[44:33] we have a building of god and house not
[44:35] made with hands
[44:36] eternal in the heavens that's what i
[44:38] mean when i say we're returning to
[44:39] heaven
[44:40] you say i've never been to heaven well
[44:42] yet maybe not your body but your soul
[44:44] has
[44:45] right because the bible says you've
[44:47] already got a theophany there
[44:49] so that even that theophany was in the
[44:51] mind of god amen
[44:53] right for this we groan oh i'm groaning
[44:56] oh i can't wait brother amen i get a
[44:58] body where i don't have to worry about
[44:59] sinning anymore
[45:00] all these evil thoughts and all these
[45:02] all these evil things that come out of
[45:03] my mouth be selfish
[45:05] if one person i know is selfish i met
[45:08] him it's jesse smith
[45:09] this flesh amen this flesh is selfish so
[45:12] i've got to crucify this
[45:14] so it stops thinking about me and starts
[45:16] being concerned for other people praise
[45:18] god
[45:18] i was saying that this week i'm the most
[45:20] selfish person god help me
[45:22] and i've said it not me it's this evil
[45:24] body it's this past house amen
[45:26] so selfish and it's got to be constantly
[45:29] brought into subjection to the word of
[45:31] god oh but my house over there
[45:33] it's got not one selfish fiber in it
[45:36] amen it's all love
[45:37] amen that's my eternal house
[45:41] ah thank god amen i can't wait to get
[45:43] there amen a house that don't care about
[45:45] itself anymore just cares about other
[45:46] people
[45:48] i got a foretaste of it over here but
[45:49] nothing like that we're earnestly
[45:52] desiring to be clothed upon with our
[45:54] house
[45:54] which is from heaven so i'm returning
[45:57] back to my house
[45:59] my eternal house see if our home is
[46:01] eternal it always existed in the
[46:03] thoughts of god
[46:05] now let's get to this returning to
[46:07] pentecost now i'm going to pull up a
[46:08] little note i had here
[46:12] i had some thoughts uh okay there we go
[46:17] now this is this quote this is from the
[46:20] chapter one i'm sorry chapter three of
[46:21] the ephesian church
[46:23] of the church age book he that hath and
[46:25] near let him hear what the spirit saith
[46:26] the churches
[46:27] now we know the scripture joel 2 already
[46:29] says we've got to return
[46:31] to pentecost i'll restore how tragic it
[46:34] is that the first aid did not listen to
[46:36] the spirit
[46:37] instead of listen to man the church
[46:39] let's stop right there
[46:41] lord willing i'm going to be preaching
[46:42] on the seven church ages again short a
[46:44] short
[46:45] series because i've already preached 120
[46:47] on it but i wrote that chapter and i
[46:49] want to preach it because there's things
[46:50] in there
[46:51] we have to understand when god speaks to
[46:52] the church age he's speaking to the true
[46:54] vine
[46:55] and the false vine that's what my man's
[46:58] talking about
[46:59] never think that a bride member can fall
[47:02] away
[47:02] a bride member can't because satan's
[47:04] sealed out
[47:05] and god is sealed in amen so when
[47:08] brother man says that like the church
[47:10] you know didn't listen to man he's not
[47:12] talking about the bride
[47:13] the bride doesn't listen to man the
[47:15] bride listens to jesus
[47:17] amen because she's married to him paul
[47:20] said in
[47:21] romans 7 you've died to the law of the
[47:24] flesh
[47:24] be married unto christ amen they were
[47:27] already married right
[47:29] so this is not speaking to the bride but
[47:31] thank god the last age will be a group
[47:33] rise up
[47:33] the true right last day and she will
[47:36] listen to the holy spirit and church
[47:37] brother
[47:38] said if you've got the holy spirit it
[47:39] can only point to the word of god
[47:41] amen amen amen i don't know that's why
[47:44] all these quotes from brother brahm
[47:45] they're great
[47:46] but you got to find which scripture is
[47:47] that talking about and then when you
[47:49] find that then you've got a vision amen
[47:51] then you can ride with that vision
[47:53] hallelujah
[47:54] that's right in the day of that's what
[47:57] we're seeing today gross darkness
[47:59] the light will return by pure word and
[48:02] we will return to the power of pentecost
[48:04] see that to welcome back the lord jesus
[48:07] christ
[48:07] amen a church it is getting gross dark
[48:10] all the time
[48:12] you see out there in california this
[48:14] week there they threaten more churches
[48:17] where they can't assemble now and now
[48:18] multiple pastors are
[48:20] going to court this week may even face
[48:22] jail time and these aren't even bride
[48:24] churches

[48:27] they're foolish virgins but
[48:28] thank god and church we god is just
[48:32] letting us see what's going to come
[48:35] we're just seeing a very small thing
[48:38] and these men of god are these men of
[48:40] god by god's grace
[48:41] they're standing up for their rights but
[48:43] wait till it comes to us
[48:45] we got to be ready church we got to pray
[48:47] for them god help them
[48:49] i watched a video this week i'm a man

[49:44] these are black lives matters
[49:46] organization

[49:57] they're just we're waking people up
[50:00] they're doing all kinds of evil things i
[50:01] saw a video today they they go up where
[50:04] people are eating outside of the diner
[50:06] and they'll say raise your fist to black
[50:08] live matters and get on your knee
[50:09] and people are just like they're they're
[50:11] surrounded there's a crowd
[50:12] of like a hundred people like saying
[50:14] raise your fist to black life matters
[50:16] and they're just and they're getting
[50:17] right in their face like this far away
[50:19] and they're eating and they got their
[50:21] masks on
[50:22] and doesn't that remind you of the riots
[50:24] when they're banging on lot's door
[50:26] see how close people are to getting to
[50:29] be this violent
[50:30] uh this violent mob see how close we are
[50:33] this is in america
[50:36] if we can see the gross darkness well
[50:38] then for sure
[50:39] we can see the light amen amen if we can
[50:42] see the darkness
[50:43] thank god that the light shines brighter
[50:45] in darkness amen
[50:47] our way of life our bible way of life is
[50:50] more clear
[50:51] it's more right it's more true than ever
[50:54] before amen
[50:55] as time goes on sister beatrice is going
[50:57] to get more clear
[50:59] that right brother amen because the
[51:01] darker it gets
[51:02] the brighter light shines although
[51:04] there's fewer lights
[51:06] there's still going to be bright they're
[51:09] still going to light this place up amen
[51:12] see as there as the darkness the light
[51:15] will return by the pure word
[51:18] and return to the power of pentecost to
[51:20] welcome back
[51:21] the lord jesus christ i'm so glad to be
[51:25] on god's side
[51:29] uh is trump and pence our saviors
[51:31] absolutely not
[51:32] but the bible says we should pray for
[51:34] them is that right
[51:36] i prayed for obama i didn't like it
[51:39] because of his decisions
[51:41] yeah george w bush i probably didn't
[51:44] care much about it
[51:45] at that time but see the bible says we
[51:47] should still pray
[51:48] we should still plead with god to help
[51:51] sinners repent and come to god amen
[51:55] this is the greatest country on earth
[51:56] church thank god for the liberties that
[51:58] we had
[51:59] this age started just after the turn of
[52:01] the 20th century now going back to azusa
[52:03] street in 1906
[52:05] as it was to be the age in which the
[52:06] true church would return to being the
[52:08] bride
[52:09] she was at pentecost we know that there
[52:11] must be of necessity a return of
[52:13] dynamic power praise god
[52:16] and so they started the last time i
[52:19] looked at the uh
[52:20] the documentary of azusa street brother
[52:22] amen they were praying
[52:23] five to eight hours a day so they would
[52:25] take turns you know some people go to
[52:27] work
[52:27] and when they had a day off the the
[52:30] brothers or sisters
[52:31] would pray five to eight hours a day and
[52:33] that's when god restored all the gifts
[52:36] and when it first fell it was it was
[52:37] perfect there every time there was
[52:39] interpretation
[52:40] every prophecy there was a thus saith
[52:42] the lord and it happened
[52:44] everybody they prayed for got well it
[52:46] was the real power of god
[52:48] because god loves a sincere heart amen
[52:51] amen
[52:53] so see they knew oh this is the last
[52:55] time
[52:56] there's got to be a return so they
[52:58] prayed for it
[53:00] but see god knew there had to come a
[53:01] brother branham praise god that three
[53:03] years later
[53:04] god knew there had to come a perry green
[53:07] praise god
[53:07] hallelujah god knew there had to come up
[53:10] brother isaiah brooks and a donny reagan
[53:12] and now you and i praise god god knew
[53:15] there had to become more believers so
[53:18] they patiently ran the race there some
[53:20] of them are still running praise god
[53:22] and they're they're staying with the
[53:23] vision and they're being faithful
[53:26] until it's the appointed time of the
[53:28] rapture
[53:33] thank god now church this is what i said
[53:34] before just bear with me
[53:36] we are a book of acts church do we
[53:37] baptize the same way they baptize
[53:39] yes do we get the holy ghost the same
[53:41] way they get it yes
[53:44] do we have miraculous miracles yes we've
[53:46] just heard them this last few months
[53:47] with our testimonies
[53:49] are they as dynamic maybe not like we're
[53:51] walking on water like jesus right
[53:53] turning wine uh water to wine you know
[53:56] we're never gonna match jesus right but
[53:59] church we've
[54:00] seen great things and we're thankful for
[54:02] that but we realize
[54:04] before the rapture we gotta return to
[54:06] the fullness of pentecost praise god
[54:08] amen
[54:08] and remember they had one heart they had
[54:10] one soul
[54:12] they had one mind now say like this they
[54:14] had one bank account now that's gonna be
[54:16] the hard part for some of us
[54:19] not that we ever would do that you know
[54:21] like end our bank accounts but in other
[54:23] words we have to be so generous
[54:25] we just listen to we just have to have a
[54:26] heart for other people
[54:28] i was thankful a few weeks ago remember
[54:30] i said if anybody has a need let me know
[54:31] i was thankful somebody
[54:33] emailed me and i was able to meet that
[54:34] need
[54:36] that's what i want i just want if
[54:37] there's something i can do to help out
[54:39] our people
[54:40] our little flock if i see a little sheep
[54:42] out there that need something i want to
[54:43] give it to them
[54:44] praise god that's that we need to have a
[54:46] heart like that praise god
[54:48] and the people abuse the system god will
[54:50] straighten them out don't you think god
[54:52] will the only thing god anoint me with
[54:53] some discernment if i
[54:54] if somebody's off the word and i'm
[54:56] really praying about it
[54:58] sure yeah don't i believe so and even if
[55:01] even if i get used then i'm just like
[55:02] jesus praise god
[55:04] because jesus was used and he still
[55:05] prayed for them he said father forgive
[55:07] them
[55:07] they don't know what they're doing
[55:10] see so we got to see now we are so much
[55:13] like the book of acts right
[55:16] we don't mess with these denominations
[55:18] all right we just we just
[55:19] fellowship with the saints and we're so
[55:21] scattered of brothers not many of us
[55:23] we're a dying breed as far as numbers
[55:26] but we're alive with the power of god
[55:28] amen
[55:29] but look like we're dying but we just
[55:31] started living praise god
[55:33] our numbers are shrinking but our
[55:34] power's growing our faith is growing
[55:37] our love for jesus is growing amen
[55:40] yes it is thank the lord
[55:45] there's a whole lot of things i'm going
[55:46] to get to lord willing wednesday i had a
[55:48] list here about 20 things i only got to
[55:49] maybe about five of them
[55:51] remember this is the state of the lord
[55:52] church oh sorry this is a
[55:55] sermon this is from the notes about four
[55:57] years ago when i preach this
[55:58] what about the true seat brother i said
[55:59] the false seed is being bound together
[56:01] in economical
[56:03] groups the true seed though happened
[56:05] just as we said the people of god are
[56:06] being
[56:07] made ready see i'm just each service i
[56:09] get a little more ready for god to come
[56:11] right do you i hope so by the word of
[56:14] the truth from the messenger of this age
[56:17] glory in her will be the fullness
[56:20] of pentecost for the spirit will bring
[56:22] the people right back to where they were
[56:24] at the beginning
[56:26] that is thus saith the lord amen amen
[56:30] and because that's what joel 2 says thus
[56:32] saith the lord
[56:33] now we don't know exactly what that
[56:35] means does that mean when we see
[56:36] somebody paralyzed we'll speak to them
[56:38] it may be
[56:40] we'll have something happen though no
[56:42] doubt about that
[56:43] we'll have the faith of that praise god
[56:47] because let me just say like this
[56:48] remember church like my mom being healed
[56:50] of cancer
[56:52] she wasn't hoping on that she had faith
[56:54] in other words god woke up her friend
[56:56] and said go
[56:57] tell ruby this scripture she's going to
[56:59] be healed
[57:00] like that was in other words god made
[57:02] the miracle happen
[57:03] amen and if god does miracles in our
[57:06] ministry
[57:07] he'll get the glory we won't get the
[57:09] glory it's not something we'll work
[57:10] ourselves
[57:10] into god will give it by his grace amen
[57:14] and the only way we can fail is to deny
[57:16] it and and have unbelief because the
[57:18] bible said
[57:18] they did not have many works because
[57:20] they're unbelief so we just got to get
[57:22] out all the unbelief and just say god we
[57:24] believe amen
[57:26] that's right in other words nobody's
[57:28] going to glory
[57:30] in the presence of the lord you and i
[57:32] can't force miracles to happen
[57:33] you and i can't do those things but we
[57:35] can be prepared
[57:36] we can be made ready so when god wants
[57:39] to move we're the vessels that he
[57:41] chooses
[57:42] that's right
[57:45] i was thinking about that all these
[57:47] testimonies where god did things it was
[57:49] god chose to do it
[57:51] who's going to brag and say well it was
[57:52] all me
[57:54] you have no power of your own right
[57:58] now remember all the symbols reign is
[58:00] the refreshing of the holy spirit
[58:02] yeah that's that's what we looked at
[58:03] brother amen remember when we did that
[58:04] bible study yeah
[58:05] oil is the holy spirit the joy of the
[58:08] holy spirit
[58:09] i'm sorry oil's the bats the holy spirit
[58:10] wine is the joy of it
[58:13] because you know stimulation isn't in
[58:15] the bible how many know that bible rap
[58:16] said oil is a stimulation well if you
[58:17] tell somebody stimulation they're not
[58:18] going to know what that means
[58:20] in the bible but the bible says the joy
[58:22] of the lord is your strength
[58:24] amen praise god see that
[58:27] joy is the actual word i think that
[58:28] would be the best bible word for
[58:30] simulation
[58:31] wheat of course is what you eat the
[58:33] bread and then restore
[58:35] i'll restore saith the lord now
[58:38] here's where we get uh now notice verse
[58:41] 25 joel 2 25
[58:43] why we need a restoration that
[58:45] antichrist spirit has eaten all but the
[58:47] root and bit of the stem
[58:49] now we're told all these insects are the
[58:50] one the same in different stages that's
[58:52] right
[58:53] they're antichrist spirit mystery of
[58:54] iniquity uh manifested in organization
[58:57] denomination and false doctrine
[58:59] through the ages now look that
[59:01] antichrist spirit is gonna it's gonna
[59:02] kill the the supernatural working of god
[59:06] and church don't sometimes don't you
[59:07] feel it working on you we're just trying
[59:09] to get you
[59:09] just to get comfortable in laodicea
[59:11] we've got to just knock that insect off
[59:13] praise god
[59:14] get off my branch right my wife pays our
[59:16] children to pick off
[59:18] caterpillars off of our our plants in
[59:20] the summertime right
[59:21] and the japanese beetles we just don't
[59:23] let i mean on our precious blueberries
[59:25] do you think we let those
[59:26] uh japanese beetles just take all of our
[59:29] fruits away no
[59:30] no we got the power if you we paint what
[59:33] a nickel a piece you pick off the
[59:35] japanese bead and throw it in the soapy
[59:37] water
[59:37] right was it location that did it
[59:41] we're not gonna let our pressure we're
[59:42] not gonna let this this this plant die
[59:45] we want to enjoy the fruits of this and
[59:47] god is saying the same thing
[59:49] he's going to enjoy the fruits of his
[59:51] bride tree amen
[59:52] hallelujah praise god what kind of
[59:56] what kind of farmer would you be to
[59:59] plant do all that work
[1:00:00] plant in those bushes let the devils eat
[1:00:02] away on it
[1:00:04] shake yourself up praise god get up and
[1:00:06] go to work amen
[1:00:07] yeah we you and i have to know that part
[1:00:09] of the battle
[1:00:10] is knocking off all the devils off
[1:00:12] getting them under our feet
[1:00:14] so that we can grow and become the real
[1:00:16] church of god
[1:00:17] amen he's got to knock it off
[1:00:23] poor that poor little look how god
[1:00:25] thinks of us we're just a poor little
[1:00:27] root
[1:00:28] and the stock is going to be restored
[1:00:30] god isn't going to plant a new church
[1:00:32] he's going to bring that original plant
[1:00:34] back to the original seed in other words
[1:00:35] brother said another branch
[1:00:37] out of the same root amen the same we're
[1:00:41] part of the same church
[1:00:42] same bride amen same holy ghost still
[1:00:45] believers
[1:00:46] we're just a continuation we're a fresh
[1:00:48] branch
[1:00:49] of the holy root he's doing it by what
[1:00:52] the teaching
[1:00:53] or the former reign next will come the
[1:00:56] harvest rain
[1:00:57] or rapturing faith that's thus saith the
[1:01:00] lord
[1:01:02] you know that oil types of spirit i'm
[1:01:04] going to skip that
[1:01:05] now let's look at a few quotes so church
[1:01:08] i believe mechanics and dynamics and i
[1:01:09] sent this one to amen this morning
[1:01:10] because we were he and i were talking
[1:01:12] about it
[1:01:13] so if we talk about something and i get
[1:01:14] a scripture i'll share with you too
[1:01:16] uh give ear o ye heavens and i will
[1:01:18] speak and hear o earth
[1:01:19] the words of my mouth my doctrine shall
[1:01:22] drop as the rain amen
[1:01:25] now doctrine is instruction and
[1:01:27] instruction is the order
[1:01:29] so people always wonder what is a what's
[1:01:31] doctrine order
[1:01:33] it's ordering you and i to do something
[1:01:36] and a lot of people that's why a lot of
[1:01:37] people don't like doctrine they don't
[1:01:38] want anybody telling them what to do
[1:01:40] but really if you're a christian you
[1:01:41] know it's not the preacher it's the word
[1:01:44] but look what god but see if you got the
[1:01:46] right heart god's doctrine god's
[1:01:49] instruction is like freshness of rain in
[1:01:51] other words you say oh now i know
[1:01:53] what to do praise god amen because now
[1:01:56] the order of the doctrine
[1:01:58] has told me this is what i must do
[1:02:01] that's doctrine and the bible calls it
[1:02:03] an anointing amen
[1:02:05] it's former rain hallelujah it's an
[1:02:08] anointing of orders
[1:02:09] god has to give the seed this first
[1:02:12] anointing
[1:02:12] of order so the bride knows what to do
[1:02:15] with the word amen
[1:02:17] amen see a lot of people don't like to
[1:02:19] be told what to do they just want to
[1:02:20] live their lazy lives
[1:02:22] right and just let things happen and let
[1:02:23] things go but that's not how we're
[1:02:25] supposed to live
[1:02:26] i got some quotes maybe i'm going to
[1:02:27] share on wednesday i'm sorry sunday
[1:02:30] brother branham said where is our george
[1:02:32] washington's
[1:02:34] he said where is our patrick henry's
[1:02:37] he said man that stood up for truth no
[1:02:40] matter the costs
[1:02:43] praise god that's what we need today
[1:02:45] don't we
[1:02:46] we need some men and women that stand up
[1:02:47] for the word no matter the cost
[1:02:50] all those men put their lives on the
[1:02:52] line
[1:02:53] so that's what i'm saying with this
[1:02:55] coming to california
[1:02:57] that's just shutting down the church
[1:02:58] what about when the holy ghost falls and
[1:03:00] they want to kill us
[1:03:01] right they're just trying to shut the
[1:03:04] doors
[1:03:06] see we got to be able to put we got to
[1:03:08] i'll say like this god's going to really
[1:03:10] squeeze out our true colors
[1:03:13] right vernon said when trials come it
[1:03:14] shows what you're really made of
[1:03:16] well we're going to see real quick
[1:03:18] hopefully in the next ten minute
[1:03:19] i mean five ten years whatever one year
[1:03:21] we'll see
[1:03:23] we're gonna see what we're made of right
[1:03:26] that's right so see doctrine this is the
[1:03:30] former rain
[1:03:30] that's why i believe the former rain is
[1:03:32] the mechanics
[1:03:34] ladder rain is dynamics
[1:03:38] okay so my speech is like the dew so
[1:03:40] when you hear god's word it says pray
[1:03:42] like this
[1:03:43] pray for the sick like this prophesy
[1:03:46] like this
[1:03:47] right set your morning like this act
[1:03:50] like this
[1:03:50] in the church sing your songs like this
[1:03:53] right
[1:03:54] whenever we get an order it's like fresh
[1:03:56] dew
[1:03:57] right it's refreshing it's like the rain
[1:03:59] oh now i know how to
[1:04:01] now i know how to preach and i know how
[1:04:02] to lead psalms right now i know how to
[1:04:03] pray for the sick
[1:04:04] now i know how to treat my children see
[1:04:07] it's freshness right
[1:04:08] and if you don't feel that way it's time
[1:04:09] we got the same forgive me lord
[1:04:14] it's like showers doctrine is like
[1:04:17] showers
[1:04:18] it's refreshing oh thank you lord now i
[1:04:20] know how to direct my life
[1:04:22] now i know the decisions i have to make
[1:04:25] now brother and starts comparing the
[1:04:27] former ladder rain to
[1:04:28] mechanics and dynamics like a car right
[1:04:32] now if anybody knows about cars who is
[1:04:34] dad because i know he works and bang
[1:04:36] bang works on a lot of cars he has ever
[1:04:39] since i met that guy he's been working
[1:04:40] on cars
[1:04:42] now let me ask you how much can the car
[1:04:44] run
[1:04:45] if just a few mechanics are off how much
[1:04:47] can they run by man
[1:04:49] you act you actually work a lot on cars
[1:04:50] too didn't you a little bit
[1:04:54] if your brakes are off and your
[1:04:55] mechanics are off you're going to get
[1:04:57] very far
[1:05:00] i mean all the other mechanics can be my
[1:05:02] everything's good to go
[1:05:04] got one brake line off one mechanic
[1:05:08] see people get oh i see too much
[1:05:10] mechanics too much mechanics
[1:05:12] mechanics are like rain it's like
[1:05:15] refreshing oh
[1:05:16] everything's getting in order the church
[1:05:18] is finally acting like the church
[1:05:21] hallelujah
[1:05:26] i'll tell you we had one mechanic go
[1:05:27] wrong this summer sister beatrice guess
[1:05:29] which mechanic it was
[1:05:30] the air conditioner did that how did
[1:05:34] that make us do that make us want to
[1:05:35] enjoy the dynamics very much not when it
[1:05:37] was 90 degrees out there my kids are
[1:05:39] like turn on the daddy can we leave you
[1:05:41] know i'm out talking the parking lot
[1:05:42] after church
[1:05:43] like daddy can we leave we're sweating
[1:05:44] like pigs in here
[1:05:46] one mechanic was off and nobody wanted
[1:05:48] deny me dynamics they want to get out of
[1:05:50] the dynamics
[1:05:52] see church see what this you see what
[1:05:54] we're saying
[1:05:55] people look down on the mechanics
[1:05:56] without the mechanics you ain't getting
[1:05:58] nowhere praise god
[1:06:00] without this word without a life that's
[1:06:03] pleasing to god
[1:06:04] we're not getting one inch off the
[1:06:05] ground for the rapture but with the
[1:06:07] dynamics
[1:06:08] we'll meet christ in the air amen
[1:06:11] hallelujah
[1:06:13] that's why we got to be patient lord if
[1:06:15] this mechanic is out
[1:06:16] as out of my life is out of order let me
[1:06:19] fix it lord
[1:06:20] amen i love this illustration donnie
[1:06:22] reagan
[1:06:24] he said we were astronauts right and he
[1:06:26] said before an astronaut
[1:06:27] takes off they got to sit there and just
[1:06:29] make sure check this gauge you ever seen
[1:06:31] that you ever seen the pictures
[1:06:32] there's like a million gauges and all
[1:06:34] the other pentecostals are flying in
[1:06:36] their planes
[1:06:37] we got the astronauts sitting there
[1:06:38] check check
[1:06:41] check check and he's saying that's what
[1:06:43] we're doing
[1:06:44] we're astronauts we're making all the
[1:06:46] checks they're flying here there
[1:06:48] oh but when all the checks are made when
[1:06:50] all the mechanics are made
[1:06:52] we're gonna get some dynamics amen and
[1:06:55] we'll fly way past
[1:06:56] all the pentecostal planes which i thank
[1:06:59] god for the plane rides i've been in
[1:07:01] praise god i thank god for the people
[1:07:03] sister beatrice i prayed for and they
[1:07:05] got healed thank god
[1:07:06] for those pentecostal plane rides
[1:07:10] i love flying up there amen but when it
[1:07:13] comes down to the rapture
[1:07:14] we got to sit in the shuttle praise god
[1:07:16] and make sure every no
[1:07:18] every knob every mechanic is ready and
[1:07:20] then when the appointed time comes
[1:07:23] it's going to be three two one take off
[1:07:26] i praise god so astronauts spend a lot
[1:07:29] of time in the cockpit
[1:07:32] just checking off all their other knobs
[1:07:34] and all their mechanics praise god
[1:07:37] but they can go so much higher
[1:07:39] hallelujah
[1:07:40] and you know what happens with one thing
[1:07:42] off one seal can kill all the astronauts
[1:07:44] if one seals off
[1:07:45] if one person's not born again they'll
[1:07:47] explode
[1:07:48] they'll never make it to space
[1:07:52] let me say something too this uniting
[1:07:55] time see
[1:07:56] the churches you nations uniting
[1:07:57] together it's uniting time of god and
[1:08:00] this bride
[1:08:02] and i say this with reverence and
[1:08:03] respect i believe the bride of christ is
[1:08:05] called
[1:08:05] i believe she's sealed the kingdom of
[1:08:06] god i believe the mechanics is there
[1:08:08] they're waiting for the dynamics that'll
[1:08:10] take her off the earth in the glory and
[1:08:11] the rapture
[1:08:12] i believe with all my heart yes sir we
[1:08:14] don't know how he's going to do it but
[1:08:15] he shall do it
[1:08:16] he is the dynamics now church let's just
[1:08:18] be honest
[1:08:19] this was 63 so that's what almost 50
[1:08:21] some years ago
[1:08:23] 57 years ago so obviously we still need
[1:08:26] some more dyna
[1:08:27] i'm sorry some more mechanics right if
[1:08:29] the dynamics haven't come yet
[1:08:31] and everybody we know that we think's
[1:08:33] bride is still here
[1:08:35] then we must be still waiting on some
[1:08:36] mechanics praise god
[1:08:39] see what i'm saying see how there's
[1:08:41] people that got to get their lives in
[1:08:42] order before the rapture
[1:08:43] that makes me love god more that god
[1:08:46] would wait with somebody
[1:08:47] 10 20 30 40 50 years to repent
[1:08:50] praise god he's willing to wait for them
[1:08:53] to get their mechanics in order
[1:08:55] so they can he can give them the
[1:08:57] dynamics
[1:08:59] oh god is so good praise god
[1:09:02] we just become members of the machine of
[1:09:04] his body
[1:09:06] forming ourself into his image and see
[1:09:08] him uniting himself with us now just
[1:09:10] think
[1:09:10] just within the last two years these
[1:09:12] guys got the holy ghost they got in the
[1:09:13] body
[1:09:14] before that they weren't in the body
[1:09:16] when i was being raised i wasn't in the
[1:09:17] body
[1:09:18] it took until 2003 i finally found my
[1:09:20] part in the body
[1:09:21] so the body's can you imagine the body's
[1:09:23] like not complete
[1:09:25] the body of jesus still needs more
[1:09:26] people in it it ain't going to be
[1:09:28] raptured until it gets every
[1:09:29] everybody in place praise god and then
[1:09:32] when everybody gets in place she's going
[1:09:34] up to meet the lord amen amen so let's
[1:09:37] let's be thankful the body's getting
[1:09:39] done people are getting in the body of
[1:09:41] christ
[1:09:42] amen see and we see him uniting himself
[1:09:47] with us
[1:09:49] in his works with his love gifts and he
[1:09:51] hands them to us just before the wedding
[1:09:53] supper
[1:09:53] and we're waiting watching for that
[1:09:55] their big church is to be united
[1:09:58] the dynamics of this church will be a
[1:10:00] refilling of the holy ghost
[1:10:04] that we have worked in a small measure
[1:10:06] while the headstone is coming down
[1:10:08] to unite with the body now i've said
[1:10:10] this before
[1:10:11] scripturally you can't get the holy
[1:10:12] ghost twice in your soul so for those of
[1:10:14] us who already got the holy
[1:10:16] ghost this has to be a refilling right
[1:10:18] here amen oh that means
[1:10:19] all of our thoughts are not on jesus all
[1:10:21] the time like when you first got saved
[1:10:23] you got the holy ghost
[1:10:24] right and then you know you have battles
[1:10:27] and you start
[1:10:27] stop thinking we stop meditating on the
[1:10:29] lord all the time like
[1:10:31] when you got the holy ghost it was all
[1:10:32] message all word all the time
[1:10:35] and then we just have battles right
[1:10:38] but he says he says the dynamics will be
[1:10:41] a refilling of the holy spirit praise
[1:10:43] god
[1:10:44] those that don't have it they get it in
[1:10:46] their soul those of us that already got
[1:10:48] it
[1:10:49] we finally get our minds back to the
[1:10:51] transformed condition they need to be in
[1:10:53] amen praise god
[1:10:57] but when that head and the body unites
[1:10:58] together i never set my timer
[1:11:00] i know it's getting late here let me
[1:11:01] give me a few minutes here okay give me
[1:11:03] 10 minutes
[1:11:05] the full power of the holy ghost should
[1:11:06] raise you up just exactly like that even
[1:11:08] the dead
[1:11:09] that's dead in christ for hundreds of
[1:11:10] years ago will raise the beauty of his
[1:11:12] holiness
[1:11:12] and take a flight to the skies the
[1:11:14] dynamics is the holy spirit
[1:11:16] that lines up perfectly with former rain
[1:11:18] and ladder rain
[1:11:20] we're waiting on this ladder rain this
[1:11:22] final anointing of the holy spirit
[1:11:26] okay i for uh same quote i just for i
[1:11:28] just didn't delete it
[1:11:29] now brother adam says in another way he
[1:11:31] calls it he calls the ladder rain
[1:11:32] another surge of the holy spirit
[1:11:36] he says that's the outstanding scripture
[1:11:37] he so he's preaching the token
[1:11:39] right now i'm going to skip down he just
[1:11:40] says talking about his sermon i'm
[1:11:42] looking for a time of a break forth of
[1:11:44] the spirit of god in these last days
[1:11:46] that we're now living in for another
[1:11:48] surge of the holy spirit
[1:11:50] into the church for a rapturing faith
[1:11:52] just before it comes
[1:11:55] and everything is sitting right in order
[1:11:57] for that and i believe that we're now
[1:11:58] the time
[1:11:59] when the word should have preeminence
[1:12:00] and i believe that that the time to lay
[1:12:02] aside
[1:12:02] our creeds and our thoughts and come
[1:12:04] back to the word i believe it's still
[1:12:05] that time
[1:12:08] now here's a good quote brother man says
[1:12:10] we're coming in the third poll
[1:12:12] and he talks about how many you can feel
[1:12:14] that he's just in a prayer line
[1:12:16] how many you can feel that something's
[1:12:18] happened in you
[1:12:19] since you've had hands laid on you there
[1:12:22] it is this is what we waited for this is
[1:12:24] just starting to bloom now
[1:12:25] i did this for a purpose i did this for
[1:12:27] a purpose i'm working or something
[1:12:29] i'm taking charge of faith and going
[1:12:31] right back to begin and come in to kind
[1:12:33] of raise faith
[1:12:34] in a bracket where you've noticed never
[1:12:36] noticed it that way before
[1:12:37] not a faith but a perfect faith build it
[1:12:40] up in here
[1:12:41] and watch a perfect god with a perfect
[1:12:43] heart keep a perfect promise by his
[1:12:45] perfect word
[1:12:46] which is sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:12:48] discern of the thoughts and tents of the
[1:12:49] heart see what
[1:12:50] we're coming now to the perfection
[1:12:52] because the people has to come
[1:12:54] to this in order for the rapture that's
[1:12:56] what's holding it away right now is
[1:12:57] waiting for that church
[1:12:59] to come in that perfect raptured faith
[1:13:01] remember there's a point of time for
[1:13:03] that
[1:13:05] right so in other words if you're a part
[1:13:08] of the bride and i'm part of the bride
[1:13:09] you can't get it without me getting it
[1:13:13] we're all gonna get it praise god amen
[1:13:15] right
[1:13:16] looking for it it means here's why i
[1:13:18] brought this it means a lot of shaving
[1:13:19] down for me
[1:13:22] it means a lot for you but together
[1:13:24] we'll make it by the grace of god
[1:13:26] amen remember the third poll is just
[1:13:28] jesus's ministry right
[1:13:30] it's it's jesus ministry brother branham
[1:13:33] continued
[1:13:34] first poll signing the hand actually
[1:13:36] actually is
[1:13:37] i think it was on his left hand right he
[1:13:39] took the people but
[1:13:40] i can't remember chan it was maybe his
[1:13:42] right hand
[1:13:44] he would see the dots and that would
[1:13:45] tell him what the the sickness was
[1:13:47] the second poll was discerning of the
[1:13:49] thoughts and tense of the heart visions
[1:13:51] the third pole was the spoken word amen
[1:13:54] and jesus had the same thing first poll
[1:13:56] second poll third poll
[1:13:58] and so that's what we're looking for
[1:13:59] we're looking for the power of the
[1:14:00] spoken word praise god
[1:14:02] that's what they had the day of
[1:14:03] pentecost he said whatsoever i have a
[1:14:06] gift of you
[1:14:06] rise and walk in the name of jesus
[1:14:08] christ praise god
[1:14:09] spoken word power he said i don't have
[1:14:12] silver and gold see how god's got to get
[1:14:14] our
[1:14:14] money and finances lower
[1:14:19] we have silver and gold such as i don't
[1:14:21] have silver gold such as i have
[1:14:23] i give unto you the spoken word amen
[1:14:26] the fullness of pentecost will be in the
[1:14:28] bride
[1:14:31] but brother ram said the rapture message
[1:14:33] this is he died on the 24th so this was
[1:14:35] 20 days before he died
[1:14:37] to the church the bride the rapture is a
[1:14:38] revelation to her
[1:14:40] it's revealed to her the revelation the
[1:14:43] true bride of christ will be waiting for
[1:14:44] the revelation the rapture that's what
[1:14:45] we're waiting for
[1:14:48] now while i'm waiting i'm getting shaved
[1:14:49] down brother amen i'm like a sheep
[1:14:51] i'm waiting for this great revelation
[1:14:53] but the whole time god is shaving me
[1:14:55] down
[1:14:56] he's taking off all my all my wool that
[1:14:59] i let grow i shouldn't let grow i should
[1:15:00] keep
[1:15:01] i should actually keep it shaved right
[1:15:04] but i got extra weight i got to get rid
[1:15:06] of so i can go on the rapture
[1:15:09] right and so i'm just as i'm waiting for
[1:15:11] that final revelation
[1:15:12] i'm getting shaved down right all this
[1:15:14] wool getting shaved off me
[1:15:17] right waiting for that last revelation
[1:15:20] praise god
[1:15:23] waiting for that now it's a revelation
[1:15:25] for revelation his faith remember simon
[1:15:26] talked about that
[1:15:27] he had a good thought never thought
[1:15:28] about that before i've always just said
[1:15:30] they're one and the same
[1:15:31] because that might be right i don't know
[1:15:32] i have to study that out
[1:15:34] you cannot have a revelation without it
[1:15:36] being faith faith is a revelation
[1:15:38] because it's something that's revealed
[1:15:40] to you faith is a revelation faith is
[1:15:42] something that's been revealed to you
[1:15:43] because faith means assurance so if
[1:15:45] you're sure of something it's because
[1:15:47] god has shown it to you right god gave
[1:15:49] you a promise you're sure of it
[1:15:52] like it was with abraham that could
[1:15:53] cause anything contrary to what had been
[1:15:55] revealed to him
[1:15:56] as though it wasn't so now faith that's
[1:15:58] what faith is the revelation of god
[1:16:00] the church is built upon a revelation
[1:16:02] the whole entire body
[1:16:04] amen praise god
[1:16:07] now i brought these quotes from a sermon
[1:16:09] i preached back i think in 2015.
[1:16:13] this is what i was saying earlier none
[1:16:15] of us
[1:16:17] can none of us can create the rapture on
[1:16:19] our own
[1:16:20] in other words it has to be in god's
[1:16:22] appointed time just like none of us can
[1:16:25] do divine healing at our and our will
[1:16:31] works is faith expressed now if you
[1:16:33] can't come he said wave your hand like
[1:16:34] that so they can pack you up to the
[1:16:36] prayer line
[1:16:37] now look you people i suppose
[1:16:38] you had to come early because
[1:16:40] i told him early now if you don't have a
[1:16:42] prayer see you don't have a prayer card
[1:16:44] if you've got
[1:16:44] faith like that if you've got that faith
[1:16:47] like i taught see if it's revealed to
[1:16:49] you all right
[1:16:50] if it isn't revealed no matter if you've
[1:16:52] been in a dozen prayer lines it wouldn't
[1:16:54] help a bit
[1:16:54] you know that okay so let me just get
[1:16:57] back to this and remind us
[1:16:59] how the same attitude we have toward
[1:17:01] divine healing is the same one for the
[1:17:03] rapture
[1:17:04] we've got to wait until god gives us the
[1:17:06] revelation of the rapture
[1:17:08] just like we have to wait until god
[1:17:10] shows us a
[1:17:12] miracle right or till god tells us to
[1:17:14] speak the word amen
[1:17:17] so you could go in a dozen prayer lines
[1:17:19] but if god never reveals to you that
[1:17:21] you're going to be healed it's not going
[1:17:21] to do you any good
[1:17:25] see i might pray i could do all i could
[1:17:27] i could get down on my knees that's this
[1:17:28] is what we do right
[1:17:30] we try getting on our knees right we try
[1:17:32] laying hands on people which is good
[1:17:33] that's what we're supposed to do anoint
[1:17:36] you with oil any way you wanted to and
[1:17:38] pray until god by grace reveals that in
[1:17:41] your heart that it's over
[1:17:42] then it's done you don't even have to be
[1:17:46] in the line or nowhere it's done anyhow
[1:17:50] so i was thinking about who is dad i'm
[1:17:53] not sure
[1:17:53] if any of us ever got the revelation
[1:17:56] beforehand
[1:17:59] like i spoke the word right i spoke to
[1:18:02] the word because i felt inspired
[1:18:03] but i still had mind battles from time
[1:18:05] to time
[1:18:07] i just said keep speaking live keep
[1:18:08] speaking live remember that
[1:18:10] i'm not sure if it struck bang i'm not
[1:18:12] sure when it struck
[1:18:14] we were just doing the best we could
[1:18:15] right
[1:18:17] and god eventually did a miracle and a
[1:18:19] whole church gathered to acknowledge
[1:18:21] that
[1:18:22] it was great to be there praise god
[1:18:24] because god gets all the glory
[1:18:26] see so whoever got the revelation it was
[1:18:29] god's grace
[1:18:31] right i know i felt i was going to show
[1:18:34] this i know i felt inspired on that
[1:18:35] sunday
[1:18:36] when i was preaching on the book of
[1:18:37] philippians and the prayer class
[1:18:39] i know i felt inspired i ran into my
[1:18:41] office i couldn't find it and jose said
[1:18:42] i got one
[1:18:43] right in my bible from brother branham
[1:18:46] so i think i left that one with the the
[1:18:48] boy at the hospital up and after i think
[1:18:49] i left my brother-man prayer cloth there
[1:18:53] but see i was searching for i thought
[1:18:54] well let's try that maybe that maybe
[1:18:56] that's god's way to do it
[1:18:58] and brother bang said he took that
[1:18:59] prayer cloth laid it on his dad took it
[1:19:01] back
[1:19:01] and i got another one right in my office
[1:19:03] now he said two days later he woke up
[1:19:05] so i'm not sure when it i'm not even
[1:19:07] sure bang got the full revelation
[1:19:09] but see we just all we did we just acted
[1:19:11] upon god's word
[1:19:12] we knew god could do it that's faith
[1:19:16] we know he can now we didn't know when
[1:19:18] he would
[1:19:19] but we kept speaking god's word trusting
[1:19:22] him to do it and he did it praise god
[1:19:24] amen see so is but i can't say like
[1:19:27] brother
[1:19:29] amen i i couldn't say thus saith the
[1:19:30] lord but all i could do is just
[1:19:32] with my little faith that i had to just
[1:19:34] speak the word and see if god will do it
[1:19:38] there's only been a couple times in my
[1:19:40] whole life brother amen where i prayed
[1:19:41] for somebody
[1:19:42] and i really knew they were going to get
[1:19:44] healed just a couple times
[1:19:48] and even then the the devil comes and
[1:19:49] battles you right like
[1:19:51] are you sure about that what if you're
[1:19:54] wrong that's what he always tells me
[1:19:56] what if you're wrong what if you miss i
[1:19:59] just got like
[1:20:00] shut up you know i'm gonna go do
[1:20:02] something i'll study or something like
[1:20:03] that here
[1:20:04] i'll go let me go pray you just gotta
[1:20:06] tell me shut up right
[1:20:08] yes i'm get thee behind me devil praise
[1:20:10] god amen
[1:20:11] get me behind me you're on a fence unto
[1:20:13] jesus amen
[1:20:15] like the one time sister lisa came up
[1:20:16] for prayer she was at home and john was
[1:20:19] there at the other church
[1:20:20] at waterloo she just had a miscarriage
[1:20:23] and she said i want to be healed so i
[1:20:24] can have a baby
[1:20:25] church she she was on the phone she
[1:20:28] i had my cell phone up here and i was
[1:20:30] preaching to her
[1:20:32] she hung up she drove 30 minutes up to
[1:20:35] our church up there in waterloo
[1:20:37] and came up to the altar weeping and
[1:20:38] crying and i prayed for right there
[1:20:40] and i said it out loud i wonder if i got
[1:20:42] the recording i said god heard us
[1:20:44] tonight
[1:20:45] she won another baby it wasn't long
[1:20:47] after that maybe 10 or 11 months later
[1:20:48] she had been another baby
[1:20:49] i forget which one it was maybe hannah
[1:20:51] or
[1:20:52] i can't remember which one it was
[1:20:57] not maybe not hannah maybe the one after
[1:20:58] him i'm sorry i can't remember
[1:21:02] but that was one time i i remember i
[1:21:04] really believed god heard our prayer
[1:21:08] so what am i saying a lot of times
[1:21:10] church we're just acting on what we know
[1:21:13] is true
[1:21:13] and looking to see if god does it and
[1:21:16] church there's nothing wrong with that
[1:21:18] that's what we should do right because
[1:21:21] at least we're acting on some faith
[1:21:23] right
[1:21:24] that's right and what i love about with
[1:21:27] with who is dead
[1:21:28] god honored our little he said if you
[1:21:30] just got a grain of faith
[1:21:33] it can move mountains praise god if
[1:21:36] you've got faith like a mustard seed we
[1:21:37] had enough faith right to speak the word
[1:21:39] like a mustard seed
[1:21:40] we had enough faith to go put the prayer
[1:21:42] cloth right there and have bango do it
[1:21:44] and god honored that little mustard seed
[1:21:46] of faith hallelujah
[1:21:48] i don't have enough faith to say oh i
[1:21:49] know it's going to happen i don't have
[1:21:51] enough faith to do that
[1:21:52] but enough faith to pray for the sick
[1:21:55] see
[1:21:56] until god reveals it in your heart the
[1:22:00] man says if you don't have revelation
[1:22:01] yet
[1:22:01] just keep speaking lives i'm going to
[1:22:04] skip ahead
[1:22:05] he said these people got prayer cards
[1:22:06] but that don't mean they're going to be
[1:22:07] healed all depends on their faith in god
[1:22:09] he said no matter how religious you are
[1:22:11] good or bad
[1:22:12] unless the grace of god see drops in the
[1:22:14] heart you'll never get well
[1:22:15] that's why but amen the rapture is going
[1:22:17] to be god's grace to us
[1:22:18] amen it's not because we're better than
[1:22:21] anybody it's going to be a grace of god
[1:22:23] because he revealed it to us because we
[1:22:25] desired it praise god and we did
[1:22:27] everything we could do
[1:22:28] to forsake the gross darkness and walk
[1:22:31] in the light praise god
[1:22:33] because he's got it he's got to work
[1:22:35] with our
[1:22:36] our human will he can't force us but
[1:22:39] he's got to work with our human choices
[1:22:41] and our free more agency and yet his
[1:22:43] desire to bring his word to pass
[1:22:45] he's got to find some middle of the road
[1:22:47] praise god
[1:22:48] where we finally get our we finally say
[1:22:50] okay i'm done with this world
[1:22:52] i want to go to heaven in the rapture
[1:22:53] amen and when we get to that point then
[1:22:55] the latter rain will fall praise god
[1:22:58] amen by his grace amen i'll say that
[1:23:01] if we live to see it we might get old
[1:23:04] but amen we might
[1:23:05] have gray hair pretty soon i was
[1:23:07] picturing you with gray hair singing
[1:23:10] i love that guy you know
[1:23:14] maybe it'll be that long i don't know
[1:23:16] how long it's going to be
[1:23:18] but we got to run the race with patience
[1:23:19] praise god amen
[1:23:22] it'll happen just wait it's like rapture
[1:23:24] is going to happen
[1:23:25] right i think it's the last one let's
[1:23:28] stand here
[1:23:31] i got a couple more
[1:23:35] jesus said if you could believe it it
[1:23:36] would happen if you can't believe it it
[1:23:38] won't happen
[1:23:38] see we got to at least have a little
[1:23:40] grain of mustard seed i know god can
[1:23:41] heal
[1:23:42] who is dead i know it i just believe it
[1:23:44] i don't know for sure but i believe he
[1:23:46] can do it so i can't make you believe
[1:23:49] neither can you make yourself believe
[1:23:52] oh i'm going to really work my way into
[1:23:53] the rapture today
[1:23:56] you can't do it you are going to
[1:23:57] struggle
[1:23:59] you are going to fall flat
[1:24:03] see we're depending on god we're just
[1:24:04] gonna yield ourselves we gotta
[1:24:06] do the best we can with our free more
[1:24:07] agency get shaved out as much as we can
[1:24:10] and let god's grace bring it to us
[1:24:13] because he said he would give us the
[1:24:14] desire
[1:24:15] of our hearts not your faith
[1:24:18] god's faith hallelujah your intellectual
[1:24:22] faith might be
[1:24:23] believe it fine but unless the faith of
[1:24:24] god is on your heart see
[1:24:26] just keep believing it with all your
[1:24:28] heart until god does reveal it to you
[1:24:31] just keep believing it until god does
[1:24:34] reveal it
[1:24:36] so receiving faith for divine healing is
[1:24:38] a gift it's not a labor or human effort
[1:24:40] faith is a revelation from god now faith
[1:24:42] is revelations that's where i want to
[1:24:43] stay
[1:24:44] there just a moment it's a revelation he
[1:24:46] has revealed it to you by his grace
[1:24:48] it's nothing you did you didn't work
[1:24:50] yourself
[1:24:51] up into faith you ever have faith it's
[1:24:54] given to you by the grace of god
[1:24:57] and god reveals it to you therefore
[1:24:58] faith is a revelation
[1:25:00] and the whole church of god is built
[1:25:02] upon revelation the church said
[1:25:05] amen let's have the musicians come here
[1:25:11] i just want to bring that out again
[1:25:12] church that we are looking for a rapture
[1:25:16] our job is to keep ourselves
[1:25:20] clean keep all of our growth our
[1:25:23] our sinful growth shaved off
[1:25:26] keep shaved keep clean
[1:25:30] and then in god's appointed time he'll
[1:25:33] bring the revelation of the rapture
[1:25:37] praise god
[1:25:44] i'm confident of that church are you
[1:25:46] confident of that
[1:25:48] absolutely
