TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And if a woman won't have a baby for her husband, she'll take a daughter or cat or something. &gt;&gt; She's got to mother something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a nature. But to bear a child for a husband and raise it to the service of God, that's entirely all out of her line. &gt;&gt; Mother has in the church bounty of dogs. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video [music] is to show how God's prophet brother William Brham recognized a trend amongst American women who did not want to have children as early as 1952. [music] And then the American vice president JD Vance had recognized this as well around the year 2021. God's prophet, Brother William Brandham, connected this trend with a prophecy from the Lord Jesus that's connected to the tribulation period. And so, it's a tribulation anointing that is upon women today because we're approaching the great tribulation period. And this tribulation anointing is causing them to not want to have children. Brother Brandham recognized this anointing in its seed form as early as 1952. And then this is only increasing. So, we'll look at this subject here. by the grace of God. Now, the origin of this video was a few weeks ago I was listening to the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride because it has a thanksgiving message in it and I came across again this beautiful section where brother Brandham is talking about this end time prophecy from the Lord Jesus and in that section is one of my favorite quotes where he says acts 238 youngans and that's the only kind of children the word can bring forth. It's a beautiful, memorable masterpiece type of quote, I would say, by the grace of God. And then I had remembered that over a year ago, the liberal American media was all upset at JD Vance for saying that American democratic leaders were a bunch of cat ladies. And so, I thought I'd make a video about this by the grace of God because it does connect to the scripture again with the tribulation anointing as we'll see. This is a compound prophecy from the Lord Jesus Christ out of Luke chapter 23 by the grace of God. Friends, please know that I'm not trying to support the Republican party. Of course, I have always voted Republican and only Republican, but I realize both parties are ultimately controlled by the devil. So, I'm voting for the lesser of two evils. I understand that. Matthew chapter 4 is proof of all governments being motivated by Satan. As brother Ram said with thus sayith the Lord when Satan offered the Lord Jesus the kingdoms of this world and Jesus did not correct him. So Satan ultimately has control over the majority of government workers but there are some good government workers and there are some glimpses of hope every now and then such as when Ro versus Wade was overturned. I'd been praying for that for a few years with weeping and crying at the altar at the church and God mercifully overturned Ro v. through the United States Supreme Court. So, I'm thankful for that. I'm thankful for the southern border being closed down, thankfully. And I'm thankful that our religious freedoms here in the United States have been protected by the grace of God. And there's nothing wrong with voting as long as you do the best you can by your conscience through the Holy Ghost. Brother Ram said he voted for Nixon when it was Kennedy versus Nixon, but Nixon lost. So, there's nothing wrong with voting. God's ultimately in control. But recently when I was listening to this sermon, the invisible union, I remembered how brother Bam rebuked these women for not wanting children. And then I connected that with JD Vance who was rebuking the Democratic Party. And friends, the Democratic Party even had mobile abortion clinics set up at their Democratic National Convention. So this shows they are the party of death and not the party of life. And of course, the DNC supports surgeries on children's bodies. And I'm just having to watch my words here because I'm on YouTube. And JD Vance pointed this out well before the 2024 presidential election back in 2021. I'll play a clip here of how JD Vance is explaining why he said the cat lady's comment. He said because the Democratic party is becoming anti-family and anti-child. Let's listen to the quote. run in this country via the Democrats, via via our corporate oligarchs by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made. And so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. And it's just a basic fact. You look at Kla Harris, Pete Budajage, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. This is about criticizing the Democratic has lied about this that this is not about criticizing people who for various reasons didn't have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-f family and anti-child. So with that introduction, friends, let's look at a Bible foundation of how God honors motherhood and of course fatherhood as well, but this particular video is focusing on motherhood. Read the entire chapter of Proverbs 31 and you'll see how God honors a Proverbs 31 woman. Not only does she take care of the children in the home, she provides clothing, food, but I believe even later on in life, she can get into business deals because the Bible said she'll consider a field and purchase it. And I love verse 28. It says, "Her children arise up and call her blessed and her husband also, and he praiseth her." So, motherhood is honorable. It's fruitful. It's worthy of public praise within the family and before God. Here's one of my favorite verses I found recently. And what I mean by that is in the past couple years Psalm 144 9-12 I'll just read 9 and 12 I will sing a new song unto thee oh God upon a sultry and upon and an instrument of 10 strings will I sing praises unto thee in verse 12 that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth and that our daughters may be as cornerstones polished after the similitude of a palace. So this scripture struck me and I think I preached it on Mother's Day a few years ago. the daughters of Israel would become as cornerstones. And this reminded me of the quote from brother Brandham where he said, "My wife is my backbone. She's the backbone of my family." The cornerstone is the foundation of a palace or a building. The backbone is the foundation or the stability of the human body. And so we see the scripture connect a woman to a cornerstone. And what's also very powerful is that Jesus Christ is called the cornerstone. And so here we see how God created both male and female. In the beginning, Adam was a spirit and Adam had inside of him the feminine nature. And then God pulled Eve out of Adam. And so God designed this feminine attribute to be inside of Adam and it still expresses the glory of God. So these dominant attributes and these submissive attributes, they all come from God. And here the woman is likened unto a cornerstone. She's the foundation. I could say amen to that for my family. My wife is the foundation of my life, my family, my ministry. Or as brother Ram would say, she's the backbone of my ministry and my family by God's grace. So again, look how God honors motherhood. Look how God honors mothers, calling them cornerstones, just like the Lord Jesus Christ is our cornerstone. So the value of a woman is great. I believe that's what Song of Solomon says. She's more valuable than fine rubies. It's hard to put a value on a godly, holy ghostfilled Christian woman, Christian mother by the grace of God. Isaiah 66:13 says, "As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem." So God is saying he's going to comfort Israel as a mother comforts. And this reminds us of the quotes of brother Brandham about a mother's love. Nothing is greater than a mother's love. And love is the greatest gift according to 1 Corinthians 13. If you have faith, hope, and charity, the greatest of these is charity. And in context, Isaiah 66 is speaking of the sealing of the 144,000. So now we get the idea of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. When a person receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost, it's as if they're getting a mother's comfort or God's comfort. And the Holy Ghost is called the Comforter. Isaiah 66:8 shows us this. Or shall a nation be born at once. For as soon as Zion travaleth, she brought forth her children. This is speaking of the 144,000. The nation will be born in one day. And we also see that in Revelation 7 where the 144,000 are sealed in their foreheads by the Holy Ghost. Isaiah 66:12 brings in the Gentiles. So this shows also a connection with the millennium that follows shortly after the 144,000 are sealed. For thus sayith the Lord, behold, I will extend peace to her like a river and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream. So we know during the millennium all the nations will be under the governance of the Lord Jesus Christ as he sits in the millennial temple ruling the nations with a rod of iron. So that's when the glory of the Gentiles flows like a stream. All nations will bring their glory to Jerusalem to the millennial temple. So again, God will comfort Israel like a mother comforts her child. And then we see how Timothy in 2 Timothy 1:5 had the faith of his mother and grandmother when I called to remembrance the unfeign faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Ununice and I persuaded that in thee also. So this shows the power of parenting how parents can help mold and shape the faith of their children. This is the blessing of God going from one generation to the next. And that's what God promised in Exodus 34. Not only would he visit the iniquity from one generation to the next for those who did not repent, he would also visit the blessing of one generation to the next generation. And so we see that vindicated and identified in the life of Timothy. And lastly, Psalm 127:3, lo, children are inheritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is his reward. So women having children is the reward of God. Motherhood is directly tied to God's blessing and covenant inheritance. Children are a heritage of the Lord. Children are the possession of the Lord. So God just gives us children as his reward and we just take care of them for a little time as brother Brandham said, and then they're able to walk with God themselves by the grace of God. So now let's look at brother Bram's use of prophecy regarding the trend of the United States women despising motherhood. Bar was using Luke 23 27-31. This is Jesus on his way to be crucified. And in verse 28, Jesus turned to the women which were bewailing and lamenting him. And he said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming in which they shall say, blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bear, and the paps which never gave suck." Then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry? Now this was fulfilled during the days of Roman general Titus who sieged the city of Jerusalem around 70 AD. But there's also a compound prophecy for the tribulation as well. Notice in verse 30 of Luke 23, they'll say to the mountains, "Fall on us." Well, that should remind us immediately of Revelation 6:es 15 and 16 in the section on the sixth seal. The Bible said in verse 15, "The kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, chief captains, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks and the mountains." In verse 16, "And said to the mountains and rocks, fall on us and hide us from the face of him that siteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb." So here we see the very same words, fall on us. So those who are under judgment in the days of Titus said fall on us mountains and then those who will be judged during the great tribulation will say to the mountains of rocks fall on us. And in both time periods there was this statement that the women were blessed not to have children. So if that happened in the days of Titus and it's going to repeat also in the great tribulation but thankfully the bride of Jesus Christ who is filled with the Holy Ghost will not be here on the earth. She is promised a pardon from the wrath of God. According to 1 Timothy chapter 5, the tribulation is God's wrath being poured out upon the earth, the disbelieving earth. The bride of Jesus Christ will be snatched away or caught up snatched away quickly in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and taken to the marriage supper of the lamb. Now, let's look at three quotes from God's prophet, brother Brandham. The earliest quote from God's prophet, brother Brandham, that he noticed this trend of women not wanting children was in 1952, August 10th. I am the resurrection and the life in Chicago, Illinois. He was talking about the Old Testament saints and said they had prayed for God all these years to take away her reproach and she could bear children as it was an honor for any Hebrew woman to have a child. Think of that. It was an honor to have children and for about half of America it's a dishonor but not for the believers of course. But the man said how they've changed that now. It's almost a dishonor to have a child. Now isn't that right? You might not say amen but it's the truth. The woman had rather pay $100 for a little old smashed nose dog and give it a mother's love out here than to fool with a baby. How sad that was in 1952. How sad it is now today with all the cat ladies and dog ladies who would rather have pets than children. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; I see an old man and a woman way past the age of bearing. the woman was. And she said they had prayed for God all these years to take away her reproach and she could bear children as it was an honor for any Hebrew woman to have a child. How they changed that now. It's almost un dishonor to have a child. Now, isn't that right? You might not say amen, but it's the truth. A woman had rather pay $100 for a little old smashing old dog and give it a mother's love out here than the fool with a baby. How you know that's the truth. walking down the street with a little sweater on it. And I've seen one of the biggest clinics I ever seen nearly out here was a dog clinic. I don't see it. I can't see it. All right. Anyhow, that's up between you and God. Next, in 1958, handwriting on the wall, June 18th, Brother Random said, "Motherhood is marred. The church is gone to the dogs." And I think that has both a spiritual and natural meaning because dogs in the Bible were homosexuals and sodomites. He said, "Motherhood and great principles like that is broken when mothers pay $100 for a little snotty-nosed dog and take it in the house and give it a mother's love and ride around in an automobile and practice birth control." So, Brother Ram again rebukes that. And notice even message believers today will take birth control to limit the number of children they're having. Friends, that's a sin. I have a video about that. I'll leave a link to that in the description by the grace of God. But it shows how those worldly attitudes and even the tribulation anointing gets on people who are afraid to have children or don't want to have children for whatever sinful reason they choose to. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; And it isn't communism THAT'S HURTING AMERICA. IT'S OUR OWN RIGHT AMONG US OR something that breaks the backbone of this nation. Mother has been ming the church of dogs. All the great things that we stood for, the great principles and things has rise beneath us. &gt;&gt; So it's our own boils that killed us, not communism or any other nation. &gt;&gt; Sin is a reputation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Motherhood and great principles like that is broken when mothers pay a $100 for little snotty little dogs, excuse that expression, and take IT IN THE HOUSE and give it a mother's law and ride it around in automobile and practice breast control. Any nation will shake under such stuff as &gt;&gt; amen. Not women are allowed to be stripped in the streets and walk down such things as uncensored television tests of old bugger. Four or five time married women prostitutes in the station and little girls take them for example. And here the final quote which kind of inspired this video was invisible union 1965 November 25th. It's on a Thursday night. I think it was Thanksgiving night if I'm not mistaken. Brother Ram talks in paragraph 117 about Eve didn't mean to do wrong. She was deceived. And brother Ram said that's exactly what happened to the women today. They're deceived by television. Of course, internet today, smartphones, magazines, modern girls, things they see on the street. But the Ram said, "She's dead and doesn't know it. She's far from God." Which I thought was powerful. It combines two scriptures. 1 Timothy 5:6, "But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth." Speaking of the widow woman that won't serve the Lord or runs off of some other rich man who's an unbeliever just to have financial support. So she is not born again if she does that. A woman that lives in sinful pleasure is not born again. And then brother Ram said and don't know it. I believe that's from Revelation 3:17. They say they're rich and increase with goods have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched, miserable, poor, blind and naked. This is the leosian condition of today. So, Brother Ram says, "A lot of American women today are dead spiritually. They're not born again, and they don't know it. And they're far from God. They look to the world to be influenced by the world instead of the word of God." Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; Eve didn't mean to do wrong. It wasn't willfully, but she, the Bible said in second Timothy, 1 Timothy 3, she was deceived. &gt;&gt; And deceived is not when you willfully do it. It's when you're deceived into doing it. And that's just exactly what's happened today. &gt;&gt; She's been deceived by television, by magazines, by these people, THESE ALL THESE FINE THINGS THAT THEY'RE GOING out on the street, modern girls. They look at magazines and they look at pictures. They look on the street. They see the CLOTHING IN THE SHOPS. HOW SATAN, THAT GREAT INSTRUMENT of the of hell, has come down amongst the people and deceived them into these things. &gt;&gt; And the woman thinks she's all right. &gt;&gt; And she's dead and don't know it. Amen. &gt;&gt; She's far from God. &gt;&gt; See how she lost all this and how subtle it was. &gt;&gt; Then in paragraph 119 120, brother Ram said, "Jesus spoke of this condition." And then he quotes Luke 23, he said, "Today it's a disgrace for her to have a child." Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; Today, I want you to notice Jesus spoke of it. Also, if you'd like to read it, Jesus made mention that this thing would come to pass. Did you know that in his last hours, just before his crucifixion, let's just read it. St. Luke the the 23rd chapter and just for a moment, like a Sunday school lesson, begin with the 27th verse. I believe I got marked out here. Jesus going to Calvary. Listen as I read it. All right. St. Luke 23:27. I believe that's where we have it. My notes got it that way. Yeah, here it is. And there followed him a great company of people and women, which also bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning unto them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the day days are coming that they shall say, "Blessed are the barren, and the womb that never bear, and the paths which never gave." Think today the disgrace for to have a child. Then shall they begin to say, "TO THE MOUNTAINS, FALL ON US AND HIGH AND THE HILLS, COVER US." For if they do these things in a dream green tree, what shall they do in a track? &gt;&gt; Next, in paragraphs 121-25, the Ram said Jesus was speaking of a day when the women wouldn't want children. They want a dog or a cat and she'll have an operation performed to himself or her that'll keep them from having children. They don't want no children. Jesus spoke of this. Brother Ram said, he said, "It's the coming of the Lord." So the coming Lord is the rapture, pre-tribulation rapture to snatch away the bride and then that tribulation sets in with the tribulation anointing. But Ram said they pay great sums of money for cats, dogs to mother. She must mother something because it's her god-given nature to her. That's why these cat ladies get cats or puppies or whatever they get, birds, rabbits, whatever. They have a god-given nature to be a mother. And since they won't accept children, they don't want children. They've got to mother something. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; Speaking of the day that when women would no more want children. They want a dog or a cat &gt;&gt; or something like that, &gt;&gt; but she don't want children anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? She's old Mother Hubard if she has a child. &gt;&gt; See, she don't want That's the That's the remarks of Hollywood. He don't want his woman to be an old mother hovered. So she'll he'll have some operation performed to himself or her one that'll keep her from having children. They don't want no children. JESUS SPOKE OF IT. AND WHAT DID HE SAY? AT that time they'll begin to cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on her. &gt;&gt; She practice birth control so she can go to parties. She can't be bothered with a baby nursing her. &gt;&gt; It'll disform her when she's pregnantated. It'll be disarm her. She won't look like she used to. and her husband ignorant enough to let her go that way and she won't give him a child. Jesus spoke of it and he said that when they doing this at that time they'll go to crying land for the rocks to fall on him it's coming of the Lord. Next paragraphs 126 through 129, Belram talks about the mother bear, he had observed numerous times while hunting. And he says, "If her breeding doesn't take and she don't have any cubs, she'll hunt them up, the last year's cubs, and mother them all summer long because it's a god-given instinct. She has to mother something." So, Brother Am goes to the animal world to prove a principle of motherhood and then applies it to American women who have to mother something. Let's listen to the quote. They pray great sums of money for cats, dogs to mother. That's right. &gt;&gt; She must mother something because it's a god-given nature to her. &gt;&gt; I notice a hunt big game. An old bear in the fall of the year when she has been bred to the male bear. She's got cubs that is born, they're pretty good size cubs, maybe weigh 100 pounds or better. She'll make them scat and hibernate to themselves because she's going to bring forth some more cubs. They're born in February. The bear knows nothing about it. They're born in little sacks. How that God has them open these little sacks themselves. Little like little cellophene sacks. They find their way around their mother sound asleep. She hasn't eaten anything since October. And this is February. They come around and nurse her to the middle of May. Then when she sees her cubs are pretty goodized cubs, weigh maybe 15 10 15 pounds a piece. They've nursed her. Why she gets the milk? That's God's idea. She lives herself and produces milk for the cubs. And then if her breeding doesn't take and she don't have any cubs, she'll hunt up that year last year cubs and mother them all summer long because it's God-given instinct. She has to mother something. &gt;&gt; Next in paragraphs 130 and 131. Brother Ram says that's a woman that won't have a baby for her husband. She'll take a dog or cat because it's a nature that God gave to her and she'd be disgraced if she had a child with this sin-loving society of 1965 type of women. And that's what we have today, the sin-loving society of this 2025 type of women that don't want children. They'd rather be cat ladies. And brother Ram said that's a true picture of the modern church today. The modern church doesn't want these screaming, shouting, tongue-speaking Acts 2:38 youngans around her. She don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming, "Amen. Hallelujah." Why, that would immediately put her out of her denomination. They'd throw her out real quick. Amazing, memorable, masterpiece quote. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; And if a woman won't have a baby for her husband, SHE'LL TAKE A DAUGHTER OR CAT OR SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; She's got to mother something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's nature. But to bear a child for a husband and raise it to the service OF GOD, THAT'S ENTIRELY all out of her line. She should all should she'd be so disgraced if she did by her sinloving society. This 1965 type of women, a true picture of the modern church today. &gt;&gt; NEITHER DOES THE MODERN CHURCH WANT ANY OF THESE YEARS SCREAMING, SHOUTING, tongue speaking. Acts 2:38 young ones around her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She don't want any of them &gt;&gt; moving and crying and screaming. Amen. Hallelujah. Or such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination. &gt;&gt; They had one like that in one of the churches. Why? They throw her out right quick. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU LET SUCH STUFF AS GO ALONG? NEXT, in paragraphs 132 and 133, Brother Ram said, "The church is pregnant with something, and she's bringing forth members all the time, but she doesn't want the scream and holler and blabber in Acts 2:38, miserable creatures that she thinks they are because they would embarrass her." But the true church loves that. Our church, any true church, loves when the young people scream, holler, blabber, receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, whoop, cry, scream, shout, dance, speak in tongues, whatever they do. when they get born again. The true church loves that. Brother Ram said, "The church doesn't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind of children the word can bring forth." Again, this is another memorable, powerful quote. There's only one kind of children the true church can bring forth. That's Acts 2:38. Young, screaming, crying, shouting, hollering, speaking in tongues, holy ghostfilled believers, born of the spirit of God. Brother Ram said it has the spirit of God in it. an old-fashioned sanctified, Holy Ghost-filled child screaming, hollering, shouting, praising God. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; You see, she's pregnantated with something &gt;&gt; because she's bringing forth members all the time, &gt;&gt; but she don't want them screaming, hollering, blabbering. Acts 2:38. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Miserable creatures that she thinks they are. It would certainly embarrass her. It would ruin her her educated ethical scientific society church that she belongs to throw her out at the next council. &gt;&gt; She can't have it. So she don't want to be pregnantated with THE WORD BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY KIND THAT THE WORD CAN BRING FORTH. &gt;&gt; Lord of the spirit of God. It has the spirit of God in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No intellectual church joined CREEP GOING BOBBED HAIR PAINTED FACE. There's no such a thing as THAT IN ALL. YOU DON'T FIND THAT IN the word of God. &gt;&gt; You find an oldfashioned sanctified Holy Ghost fililled child born of the spirit of God screaming, hollering, shouting, praising God. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 134 135. Brother Ram said the Jezebel society calls these painted face shortwearing women cats. He said, I think they call it cats. She claims she's married to the second Adam, but brother said she's married to the first Adam, the world. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; That's all together out of the reaches for her. She don't want that. Oh no, sir. No, indeed. &gt;&gt; What does she do that? So, she brings forth a pair of painted face shortwearing &gt;&gt; Jezy Bell Society illegitimate cats they call them, I think. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think they call it cats. Look at that cat going there. They say or something like that. You know, she was born or married or connected with her first husband, the first Adam by the adulterous wife of Eve. Adam's first wife. You say adulterous? She sure was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But oh, she claims that this Adam, this first Adam's dead. Oh, sure. He died a long time ago. I'm reborn again, she says. and I'm certainly married to THE SECOND ADAM, CHRIST THE WORD. &gt;&gt; In paragraphs 136 through 138, Brother Ram said, "Watch what the modern church loves. You'll see who she's in love with. She's in love with the church and not the word." Her own fruits prove what she is. She claims she's born the second time to Christ, but her lover is Adam because she loves the world. Bill Ram said, "If the church brings forth a child of the second Adam, he acts the second Adam's way of acting like they did on the day of Pentecost." That's the really true second Adam's children. So, I love that brother Ram always takes the baptism of Holy Ghost back to the day of Pentecost. That goes along with the thus sayith the Lord quote from the church age book where brother Brandham said, "Thus sayith the Lord, the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride of Jesus Christ before the rapture." And that's the truth. The true bride of Christ has to go back to Pentecost in order to go up in the rapture. We got to go back then we go up. Brother Ram says the worldly church has painted face, bobbed hair, women wearing men's clothes and trousers. It's a shame for her to do that. Brother Ram said that's what the word says. I'm only pointing out nature. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; Huh? Notice what she loves. Watch her lover. You don't see who she's in love with. The word says this, but she said, "My church says this." Then who she in love with? &gt;&gt; Who is her husband? &gt;&gt; Her own fruits prove what she is. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Right. Shows what she is. Notice she was born first to Adam because that's her natural birth. See, and she never left that. That's a lover of the world. She claims that she's born the second time to Christ. But her lover, notice, is Adam yet because she loves the world. AND ANOTHER ANOTHER THING, NOTICE WHAT KIND OF CHILDREN SHE'S BEARING. &gt;&gt; That tells what their papa is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was first Adam or second Adam. &gt;&gt; If the church brings forth a child of the second Adam, he acts the second Adam's way of act like he did on the day of Pentecost. That's the real true second Adam's children. See, that's right. Their nature is like his and hers. Yes, sir. her daughter's painted face, bobbed hair, wearing man's clothes, trousers. The Bible said for her not to do it. She cuts her hair. It's a shame to her. You say, "Shut up on that." That's what the word says. &gt;&gt; I'm only pointing out nature. &gt;&gt; That's what she does. &gt;&gt; And the last quotes from paragraph 139 through 141. Brother Ram said, "God never did organize a denomination. He's always been against it. His words against it." So the modern church that's organized is against the word of God and is just as illegitimate as Cain was. Let's listen to the quote. Her sons, her sons born out of her rely upon education, schooling, some Bible school socalled, some great college supposed to be a long time ago, had some out some sort of an incabator style. &gt;&gt; Denominational seekers, religious king-like, just illegitimate to the word as Cain was, &gt;&gt; just as ill illegitimate as Cain was. &gt;&gt; Denominational seekers, you see what it is? God never did organize a denomination. He's always been against it and rose against it. &gt;&gt; But they hold right on to it. So you see what they're bringing forth. That shows who their papa and mama is. Exactly. It's exactly just as illegitimate as Cain was. That's kind of a child he brought forth from Eve that got away from the word. Then you see what she brought. That's just exactly what the church has brought. The same thing. &gt;&gt; In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. But again, it raises our faith that we who believe were baptized with the Holy Ghost and are born again love godly Christian motherhood. We love the baptism of Holy Ghost as well. So we love spiritual parenthood and natural parenthood because that's what God loves. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. So Jesus Christ loved parenting, fatherhood, motherhood. Remember Jesus had at least seven siblings in his family. You find that in the Gospels. I recently showed that to some saints by the grace of God in Matthew 13:55 and 56. Jesus was the oldest child and then there was James and Joseph, Simon and Judas. Right? There's five. And then sisters, so at least two sisters, five, six, seven. So there was at least seven children in Jesus's family. So God sent Jesus into a large family by the grace of God. God loves family. God loves fatherhood and motherhood because that's what God is. God is a father. So friends, let's fall under the anointing of the Holy Ghost. It'll point us back to the word of God. We'll continue to have large families. We'll wait for the coming of the Lord or we'll have as many children as God ordained us to have. We'll obey the word of God. We won't fall under the pre-tribulation anointing. And if we do that, if we fall under the real anointing of the Holy Ghost, we'll be the elect lady, not the cat lady. Scripture calls the bride of Jesus Christ the elect lady. Let's be that elect lady, that holy ghost filled woman. And let's bring forth Acts 2:38 young and screaming, shouting, praising God. That's the only kind the word can produce. If you have any questions, [music] concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus [music] Christ be the desire of your heart. I'm very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He has never failed.
