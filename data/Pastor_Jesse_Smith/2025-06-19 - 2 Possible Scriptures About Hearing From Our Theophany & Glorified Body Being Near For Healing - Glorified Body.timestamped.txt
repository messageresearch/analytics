[0:03] You have then been formed into the
[0:06] living image of the living God. You
[0:09] heard from your theophony. If this
[0:11] earthly body be dissolved, we have one
[0:13] waiting.
[0:15] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:20] this video is to do a third video on the
[0:23] topic of the theophony body. And we'll
[0:26] look at two possible scriptures that
[0:28] speak of believers either hearing from
[0:31] their theophony or having their
[0:33] glorified body near them. And this is
[0:36] based upon the feedback in the comments.
[0:39] So I want to appreciate everyone who
[0:41] left a comment and all the brotherly
[0:42] kindness and quotes and scriptures that
[0:45] the people shared. So may God bless you
[0:47] richly. If this is the first video
[0:49] you've seen in the series, I encourage
[0:51] you to go back look at part one. We
[0:53] defined the three bodies by the Bible.
[0:56] Your terrestrial body or your physical
[0:58] flesh body. The second body is the
[1:00] celestial body. That's the topic of
[1:01] these videos. The theophony body. It's
[1:04] an angel-like body. And then the
[1:06] glorified body, which is the flesh body
[1:09] swallowed up with eternal life. And the
[1:12] glorified body is the combination of all
[1:14] three bodies. And then we saw the order
[1:17] of the manifestation of believers. We
[1:20] started with Jesus who started out as
[1:22] thought and then went to theophony form
[1:25] the pillar of fire the logos. Then he
[1:27] came to flesh body and then he went to
[1:29] the glorified body and that's the
[1:30] current body the Lord Jesus is in.
[1:33] Believers go from thought to flesh body
[1:36] to be tempted and tested by sin and
[1:38] overcome sin. Then believers go into the
[1:42] theophony after death and then they'll
[1:44] go into a glorified body throughout all
[1:46] eternity. Then in part two, we showed
[1:49] the context for brother Ram's quote from
[1:50] who is this mazdc 1965 when he said,
[1:53] "You heard from your theophony." He was
[1:55] quoting 2 Corinthians 5:1.
[1:59] And I found in this quote that the Bible
[2:02] does not say anything about hearing from
[2:04] our theophony. It doesn't say anything
[2:06] about hearing from heaven, but it speaks
[2:08] of Paul longing for that heavenly body,
[2:11] that eternal body, longing for the
[2:14] theophony. And then we showed how Jesus
[2:16] heard from other people's theophanes.
[2:19] Jesus heard from Moses and Elijah and
[2:22] King Saul heard from the theophony of
[2:24] Samuel. And even as preaching that last
[2:27] night out of 1st Samuel 28, he saw God's
[2:30] ascending up. So it seems King Saul
[2:33] might have seen other theophanes as
[2:35] well, but he talked to only one
[2:36] theophony and that was the prophet
[2:38] Samuel's theophony. Also want to share a
[2:41] few additional points to consider by
[2:43] God's grace. First, the quote about
[2:45] hearing from our theophony is the only
[2:47] quote about this subject. I've never
[2:49] heard brother Random mention that
[2:50] anytime beforehand or after. And brother
[2:54] Ram does not expound on this statement
[2:56] that you've heard from your theophony.
[2:58] He only speaks of 2 Corinthians 5:1. But
[3:01] that verse doesn't talk about hearing
[3:02] from heaven. It talks about longing for
[3:04] heaven. Brother Ram does not preach an
[3:07] entire sermon on hearing from our
[3:09] theophony. And brother Ram does not give
[3:11] thus sayith the Lord that we hear from
[3:13] our theophony body. And remember he
[3:16] cares you care. 1963 brother Ram says
[3:18] you always have to be careful how you're
[3:20] listening. There's a human side to
[3:22] brother Brandham and then there's the
[3:23] divine side which is the prophetic gift
[3:25] that says thus sayith the Lord. So to my
[3:29] humble opinion this statement brother
[3:31] Brandham made about hearing from our
[3:32] theophony is just the human side because
[3:34] I can't find any scripture for it and
[3:36] there's no thus sayith the Lord for it.
[3:38] And that's just my humble opinion by the
[3:40] grace of God. Again, I'm open to
[3:41] correction. I'm just trying to do what
[3:43] brother Ram told us to do. Rightly
[3:44] divide the word of truth. That's what
[3:46] the Bible says. Prove all things. And be
[3:49] careful how I'm listening to the sermons
[3:50] of brother Brandham. And notice in uh
[3:52] John 16:13, Jesus said, "The Holy Ghost
[3:55] will guide us into all truth. Not the
[3:57] theophony body will guide us into all
[3:59] truth." But I understand even in the
[4:01] comments that the theophony has the same
[4:03] nature as the Holy Ghost because the
[4:06] theophony is an eternal body. And
[4:08] there's only one eternal nature that's
[4:10] the Holy Ghost. So I certainly agree
[4:12] that the nature of the theophony is the
[4:15] Holy Ghost. I don't see any scripture
[4:17] that says we hear from our theophony
[4:19] body rather than the Holy Ghost himself
[4:22] or God's spirit himself. And also
[4:25] friends, every other revelation from the
[4:28] Bible that brother Ram preached to us
[4:31] has lots of scripture to support it,
[4:32] such as the water baptism in the name of
[4:34] the Lord Jesus Christ, the Godhead that
[4:36] God is only one person, the serpent
[4:39] seed, brother Ram's ministry, and the
[4:41] verses that he fulfilled,
[4:43] predestination,
[4:44] and many other Bible revelations. So
[4:47] that's why I think maybe this statement
[4:49] about hearing from our theophony isn't a
[4:52] Bible revelation. it's brother Ram's
[4:55] human side or his own opinion, but I'm
[4:58] open to it being true because I'm a
[5:00] believer in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[5:02] his holy Bible and I believe Brother Ram
[5:04] was a genuine prophet of God which I've
[5:07] preached and believe for over 21 years.
[5:09] Also, I'll share one more thing as I was
[5:11] preaching last night about the
[5:13] theophony. It seems the Old Testament
[5:15] saints who did resurrect in Matthew
[5:17] 27:es
[5:19] 51-53 did have glorified bodies. The
[5:22] scriptures say they came out of the
[5:24] graves. The bodies came out of the
[5:26] graves. So, we know Jesus raised with a
[5:28] glorified body. So, it would seem the
[5:30] Old Testament saints raised with
[5:32] glorified bodies. But again, I could be
[5:34] wrong, but the context seems to point to
[5:36] that because it speaks of bodies coming
[5:38] out of graves. Okay, so let's look at
[5:41] the two possible scriptures. The first
[5:44] possible scripture of someone hearing
[5:45] from their theophony would be John the
[5:48] Revelator in the book of Revelation. I
[5:50] want to thank the brothers for sharing
[5:52] this. Numerous brothers shared this with
[5:53] me. It's from Revelation 4:10 and 11 and
[5:57] Revelation 5:5.
[5:59] Now, without a doubt, John sees his
[6:01] theophony, but it is still questionable
[6:04] whether he heard from his theophony. So,
[6:07] we look at those verses in Revelation 4
[6:09] 10 and 11. The 24 elders fall down and
[6:12] cast their crowns before the lamb,
[6:14] before the Lord Jesus Christ, who's
[6:15] seated on the throne in heaven. Now,
[6:17] those 24 elders have to be 12 sons of
[6:20] Jacob from the 12 tribes of Israel and
[6:22] the 12 apostles of the Lord Jesus.
[6:25] Either Matias took Judas's Scariot's
[6:28] spot or St. Paul took Matias's spot. And
[6:32] then in Revelation 5:5, the Bible says,
[6:35] "One of the elders saith unto me, weep
[6:37] not. Behold, the line of the tribe of
[6:39] Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed
[6:41] to open the book and to loose the seven
[6:43] seals thereof."
[6:45] So it's possible that John's theophony
[6:48] spoke to John and it's possible John
[6:50] heard from his theophony but again it
[6:53] just says one of the elders. It doesn't
[6:55] say that John heard from his own
[6:57] theophony. We also want to notice the
[6:59] context here of this verse though the
[7:01] context is after the church ages because
[7:04] of Revelation 4:1
[7:07] says I will show thee things which must
[7:09] be hereafter.
[7:11] So I believe John was caught up by
[7:13] vision into the third heaven. That's
[7:16] noted in Revelation 9:7. And thus I saw
[7:19] the horses in the vision. So John is
[7:22] given a vision on the aisle of Patmos to
[7:25] go into the third heaven. And he sees
[7:28] things that must happen after the church
[7:30] ages. So from my understanding, the
[7:32] elders falling down, casting the crowns
[7:34] hasn't happened yet, but I could be
[7:36] wrong on that. That's just my humble
[7:37] opinion. So I believe John is seeing a
[7:40] future event because I don't believe we
[7:42] have two active beings at the same time.
[7:45] So consider that it's possible some
[7:47] people believe we have two active
[7:48] beings. We have a body, spirit, soul
[7:51] active on earth and then some people
[7:53] believe we have an active theophony
[7:55] that's worshiping in heaven casting down
[7:58] crowns or something like that. I
[8:00] personally don't believe that as I
[8:02] believe John was seeing a future event
[8:04] that once he got into his theophony he
[8:07] would participate in. But again I could
[8:09] be wrong. This is a deeper subject. So
[8:11] it's interesting to kind of think about
[8:13] these things and compare scripture with
[8:15] scripture. That's what spiritual people
[8:16] do according to the book of first
[8:17] Corinthians. They compare spiritual
[8:20] things with spiritual things. So there's
[8:22] a few reasons I don't think this is John
[8:24] hearing from his own theophony. First,
[8:26] brother Ram said a theophony has no
[8:28] spirit in it. He said that 1957
[8:30] thirsting for life. So what spirit was
[8:33] in John's theophony that was able to
[8:36] talk to John if that's what happened?
[8:38] I'm not saying that's what happened but
[8:40] some people think that's what happened
[8:42] or can a theophony talk in heaven
[8:44] without a spirit in it because brother
[8:47] Ram said there's not a spirit in it. St.
[8:49] Paul in 2 Corinthians 5:es 1-5 he seems
[8:53] to say the theophony is simply waiting
[8:55] as a building in heaven. And second is
[8:58] what do the people do who believe in
[9:00] hearing from our theophony? What do they
[9:02] do with the quote from 1957
[9:05] where brother Ram said the theophony
[9:06] doesn't have a spirit in it? Do they
[9:09] just ignore that quote or do away with
[9:11] it or say it was brother Ram's previous
[9:13] understanding but then he grew in
[9:14] revelation? So I'm just curious to know
[9:16] what they would do with that quote. And
[9:18] the third point is as some of the people
[9:19] in the comments said which was very
[9:21] humble. They said, "We can't say for
[9:23] sure John heard from himself as he was
[9:26] one of the 24 elders because it's not
[9:28] specifically stated that John was
[9:30] talking to John that John's theophony
[9:33] was talking to John's physical body."
[9:36] Okay. And then the second verse is
[9:38] Romans 8:30. Says, "Moreover, whom he
[9:41] did predestinate, them he also called,
[9:43] and whom he called, them he also
[9:45] justified, and whom he justified, them
[9:47] he also glorified." So, one of the
[9:49] saints on the comments shared this verse
[9:51] with me because brother Brandham quoted
[9:52] the end of this verse in 1954. Questions
[9:55] and answers part one. Brother Brandham
[9:58] said, "Your glorified body is right here
[9:59] at the tabernacle now. The presence of
[10:01] the Holy Spirit, which is your glorified
[10:03] condition. Your own glorified body is
[10:06] standing near you right now in Christ
[10:08] Jesus to give you a strength like a
[10:10] charge going into a battery. The Holy
[10:12] Spirit's in you. It's a charge. It's to
[10:15] charge your body to give you new
[10:16] strength to heal you from the sickness
[10:18] that you've got to make you well.
[10:21] So this quote basically says your
[10:22] glorified body is standing right near
[10:25] you to give you a charge of healing. Now
[10:28] again, does brother say this repeatedly
[10:30] time and time again. Does brother teach
[10:32] whole sermons on this? Not that I can
[10:34] find. I don't see a thus sayith the Lord
[10:37] in this statement. So this is not a thus
[10:38] sayith the Lord statement. So again,
[10:40] this is a possibility. It's a
[10:42] possibility. We hear from our
[10:43] theophanes. It's a possibility. Our
[10:45] glorified body is near us. I don't know.
[10:48] I can't say. I don't have any scripture
[10:50] that supports that. I've always thought
[10:52] Romans 8:30 just gives the four steps of
[10:55] predestination because four is an
[10:57] earthly number. On earth, we get to know
[11:00] the steps of our predestination. We're
[11:02] predestinated. We're called, justified,
[11:05] glorified.
[11:06] So, in closing, friends, again, I
[11:08] appreciate all the comments there by the
[11:09] grace of God. I'm still at the same spot
[11:11] I was when I started this little series.
[11:14] I still don't have two or three
[11:15] witnesses from scripture that clearly
[11:17] say we hear from our theophony or our
[11:19] glorified body gives us a charge of
[11:22] divine healing. But as the Bible says in
[11:24] Acts 17:11, we'll keep searching the
[11:26] scriptures daily whether these things be
[11:28] so. I certainly respect the people who
[11:30] take these quotes from brother Brandham
[11:32] and try to find biblical support for
[11:34] them. But it seems more likely to me
[11:36] that it's the Holy Ghost that I hear
[11:38] from and it's the Holy Ghost that heals
[11:41] me. And then finally on the theophony,
[11:44] since Brother Ram said the theophony
[11:46] doesn't have a spirit in it and it's
[11:48] waiting for us to enter into it, how can
[11:50] a theophony speak when it doesn't have a
[11:53] spirit? And either way, friends, as long
[11:55] as we hear from the Holy Ghost and obey
[11:57] the Holy Ghost, we're going to be all
[11:59] right. We're going to be born again
[12:00] because Acts 5:32 says, "God gives the
[12:03] Holy Ghost to them that obey him." So,
[12:06] we daily read our Bibles, pray, and obey
[12:08] the word of God, and God gives us the
[12:10] Holy Ghost. And then we have the down
[12:12] payment. We have the earnest of the
[12:14] resurrection that we'll get a glorified
[12:15] body and a theophony body. And we look
[12:18] at our lives, friends, we've heard the
[12:20] revelation on the water baptism. We've
[12:22] repented of our sins. We've heard the
[12:24] spirit tell us that the Holy Ghost, it's
[12:27] guided us to repent of our sins, be
[12:28] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[12:30] Christ, be filled with the Holy Ghost by
[12:33] the grace of God. We understand the
[12:35] Godhead. We don't add to the Bible. We
[12:37] don't add three persons to the
[12:39] scripture. We understand the mystery of
[12:41] the serpent seed, the revelation of the
[12:43] seven seals, the revelation of the seven
[12:46] church ages, the seven stars, and the
[12:47] seven golden candlesticks. We have a
[12:49] home church and we're gathering more as
[12:51] we see that day approaching. We're
[12:53] benefited from the labors of the
[12:55] five-fold ministry. It's Christ in them
[12:57] bringing us to a unity of the faith. So,
[13:00] we're so thankful that we hear from the
[13:02] Holy Ghost by the grace of God today.
[13:04] Thanks for all your feedback. Again,
[13:05] friends, I really appreciate it. If you
[13:07] have any questions, concerns, or
[13:08] testimonies about this video, please
[13:10] contact me.
[13:12] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[13:14] the desire of your heart. Very happy to
[13:18] be here this afternoon and again in
[13:20] defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to
[13:23] bring the good tidings, the good news
[13:26] that Jesus raised from the dead, living
[13:28] among man today, his church. The same
[13:31] Jesus that was yesterday will be today
[13:34] and forever. He is never failed.
