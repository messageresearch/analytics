[0:03] I'm happy to be here this morning for
[0:05] this fine gathering of of people
[0:09] especially for the young people as I
[0:11] understand that this [music] uh service
[0:13] this morning is dedicated to the young
[0:16] people of uh Sri.
[0:20] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:22] of the Lord [music] Jesus Christ. The
[0:24] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:26] viewer's question about youth meetings
[0:28] or youth camps. So, by the grace of God,
[0:31] we'll do that by the scripture and by
[0:33] some quotes [music] from God's prophet,
[0:35] brother Brandham. I received this
[0:37] question through an email from a brother
[0:38] from Central America. And to summarize
[0:41] it, there's a brother in the message
[0:43] [music] from Central America and he
[0:46] doesn't believe in youth camps for at
[0:48] least three reasons. So the first reason
[0:52] is because it's an activity promoted by
[0:54] denominations.
[0:57] Second, he said they are no longer
[1:00] spiritual but business related or done
[1:04] for business purposes. I would imagine
[1:06] money, but I don't know for sure. That's
[1:08] not written in there. But this is just
[1:10] the accusation. And then third, it's a
[1:13] pure social event. So, this precious
[1:16] brother from Central America said, "Can
[1:20] we in the message of the hour do youth
[1:22] camps?" That's a great question. I
[1:25] personally believe it is okay and can be
[1:28] very helpful and beneficial to do youth
[1:31] camps. Now, I don't do them for a number
[1:33] of reasons which I'll get to later, but
[1:36] let me quickly address these three
[1:38] reasons that this one person doesn't
[1:42] believe in youth camps. First, it's an
[1:44] activity promoted by denominations. That
[1:46] might be true, but not all activities
[1:49] done by denominations are wrong. Such as
[1:52] if denominations want to have more
[1:54] prayer, more preaching, or more singing.
[1:57] There would be nothing wrong with that
[1:58] because the Bible tells us to gather
[2:00] more as we see that day approaching in
[2:02] Hebrews 10:24 and 25. And brother
[2:05] Brandham said in the fourth seal, God
[2:08] has got children in the Catholic system.
[2:11] He's got children in the Methodist
[2:13] system. He's got children in the Baptist
[2:14] system. He said, "Now remember, there's
[2:16] people out there just like you, but it's
[2:18] a system that kills the Antichrist
[2:20] spirit that finally gets them to place
[2:22] till they till they won't hear truth."
[2:25] So, we cannot condemn the people in
[2:28] denominations.
[2:30] Now, we can condemn the Antichrist
[2:31] spirit and the Antichrist system of
[2:34] denominations, but there still are
[2:36] believers, few believers, because Jesus
[2:40] said, "Few that find the narrow road in
[2:41] the denominational system." And
[2:43] therefore, our heart goes out to them.
[2:45] Our heart echoes Revelation 18:4, "Come
[2:48] out of her, my people, that you be not
[2:50] partakers of her sins and her plagues."
[2:52] So, just because a denomination does an
[2:54] activity doesn't mean it's sinful.
[2:57] Everything must go back to the word of
[2:58] God. The word of God is our absolute
[3:00] prove all things. Try every spirit as
[3:02] the Bible says. And also, you know, some
[3:05] people might say uh youth camps
[3:07] originated with denominations. That's
[3:09] why they're wrong. That's not exactly
[3:11] right either because brother Ram said in
[3:13] the seventh seal, he was talking about
[3:16] seminaries.
[3:17] He said they just see it in the
[3:19] ecclesiastical way of looking at it and
[3:21] they see it in the way that the
[3:22] seminaries taught it. That was God's way
[3:25] at one time, but we've lived a past
[3:28] that. That's from the seventh seal.
[3:30] Beautiful quote there. Notice Brother
[3:32] Random said, "Seminaries was God's way
[3:34] at one time." And of course, he's
[3:36] speaking of the man anointing age, the
[3:39] reformation age. Brother Brandham even
[3:41] said in the church age book that the
[3:43] preaching and teaching and writing of
[3:47] the Reformation or the man age was the
[3:51] greatest preaching and teaching of all
[3:52] time. It's so sad though. Message
[3:54] preachers today will call themselves the
[3:55] greatest of all time. That's a very
[3:57] prideful spirit. So, we just have to
[3:59] pray for them. Pride goes before the
[4:01] fall. So, these men will fall if they
[4:02] don't repent of their declarations that
[4:05] they're the greatest of all time. But
[4:07] these are important quotes to see here
[4:09] from God's prophet, Brother Brandham.
[4:11] There's still children of God in the
[4:13] denominational system that have to come
[4:14] out. And seminaries was God's way at one
[4:18] time. And so youth meetings can still be
[4:20] God's way because there's nothing that
[4:23] condemns youth meetings in the Bible and
[4:25] the Bibles are absolute. And then
[4:27] thirdly, this brother said youth
[4:30] meetings are pure social events and
[4:32] there's no way to prove that. That's a
[4:35] very subjective view and it might be
[4:38] true for some youth meetings whether in
[4:40] the message or denomination. But you
[4:42] can't condemn all youth meetings just
[4:45] because some are bad. Just like you
[4:47] can't condemn all churches that don't
[4:49] have youth meetings as bad or good. You
[4:53] have to look at each one individually
[4:55] again because the Bible does not forbid
[4:57] gathering more as we see that day
[4:59] approaching. The Bible does not forbid
[5:01] youth camps, youth meetings, youth
[5:03] conventions, annual meetings. The Bible
[5:05] does not condemn any of that. All right.
[5:08] So, let's go a little bit further in the
[5:09] scripture here. There's no scripture
[5:11] against youth meetings. And in fact,
[5:14] it's a good thing because you're
[5:15] gathering more as you see that day
[5:16] approaching. Some youth camps or
[5:19] conventions or annual meetings might be
[5:21] motivated by a business mindset or a
[5:24] social mindset, but that doesn't mean
[5:26] all are motivated with the wrong
[5:28] motivations. No doubt some of them are
[5:30] motivated by pure motivations to get
[5:33] young people experiences with God, the
[5:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost, or maybe
[5:38] justification, sanctification. In other
[5:40] words, they want God to meet the youth
[5:42] people wherever they are and help them
[5:44] to grow in grace and knowledge of the
[5:45] Lord. The Bible also says, "Unto the
[5:48] pure, all things are pure." So if the
[5:50] Bible does not forbid youth camps, then
[5:52] it can be a pure thing as long as the
[5:54] hearts of the believers are pure. It's
[5:56] wrong for the brother to say every youth
[5:58] convention or youth meeting is wrong
[6:00] because he hasn't been to every youth
[6:02] meeting or every youth convention. I
[6:04] think if the brother was honest and
[6:06] could visit and could visit other youth
[6:09] conventions, he'd see that God still
[6:11] uses youth camps to save the youth,
[6:13] deliver them, heal them, fill them with
[6:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's
[6:18] undeniable, friends, in the Old
[6:19] Testament, God loved the annual
[6:22] gatherings of his people at the seven
[6:24] feasts of Israel. Remember in Exodus
[6:26] 23:17,
[6:29] 14-1 17, God said, "Three times thou
[6:32] shalt keep a feast unto me in the year."
[6:33] There are three times in the year all
[6:35] thy males shall appear before the Lord.
[6:37] Those were the three mandatory national
[6:40] gatherings. Passover, Pentecost, and
[6:43] trumpets, atonement, and tabernacles.
[6:47] Even at the feast of tabernacles, God
[6:49] told Moses in Deuteronomy 31:10-12
[6:52] that at the end of every seven years in
[6:54] the feast of tabernacles, gather the
[6:55] people together, men and women and
[6:57] children, that they may hear and that
[6:59] they may learn the word of God.
[7:02] So God even required at the end of seven
[7:04] years for everyone to come and hear the
[7:07] word of God. This was a scheduled public
[7:09] assembly, annual assembly, annual
[7:12] convention. We'd say it was for
[7:14] teaching, renewal, accountability to the
[7:16] word of God. Remember Elcana in 1st
[7:19] Samuel 1 verse three, he went up out of
[7:22] his city yearly to worship and to
[7:24] sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in
[7:26] Shiloh. And remember, Hannah went every
[7:29] year and she got discouraged because she
[7:31] didn't have a child. That's when she was
[7:32] weeping. And Eli thought she was drunk,
[7:35] but she was just pouring out her soul
[7:36] before the Lord. And then God heard
[7:38] Hannah's cry. God spoke through Eli to
[7:42] tell Hannah that she'd have a son, and
[7:43] she had Samuel. Of course, we know that
[7:45] by God's grace, but that was at an event
[7:47] of this annual temple worship, the
[7:50] annual conventions, we'd say, of the
[7:52] seven feasts of Israel. We also see this
[7:55] in the New Testament in Acts 15:36. Paul
[7:58] said, "Let us go again and visit our
[7:59] brethren in every city where we have
[8:01] preached the word of God and see how
[8:03] they do." So, this was essentially a
[8:04] scheduled review, a spiritual check-in.
[8:08] We'd say the apostles would come back
[8:10] and see at a routine time to give
[8:13] oversight to the churches that had
[8:15] started by the grace of God. And then
[8:17] even Paul from the transition from the
[8:19] Old Testament to the New Testament, he
[8:21] kept some of the feasts of Israel in
[8:24] Acts 18:21. He said, "I must by all
[8:26] means keep this feast that cometh in
[8:28] Jerusalem." So he still considered these
[8:31] feasts sacred seasons for worshiping and
[8:34] gathering. So we must keep that in mind
[8:36] as well. I believe the Bible says in
[8:38] Colossians chapter 2 that we should not
[8:40] judge others traditions, other holy days
[8:42] that people have because the Bible said
[8:45] also in Romans that one man will esteem
[8:48] a day holy. The other doesn't. So it
[8:50] doesn't matter. Give them their
[8:52] Christian liberty because the kingdom of
[8:54] God is not in meat and drink but in
[8:56] righteousness, peace, and joy of the
[8:58] Holy Ghost. So every believer has that
[9:00] freedom to consider one day more holy to
[9:04] have annual meetings, annual
[9:05] conventions,
[9:07] times to seek the Lord and worship God.
[9:09] There's nothing wrong with that. And
[9:11] even leaders coming together to consider
[9:13] matters is a godly thing. We see that in
[9:15] Acts 15:6. The apostles and elders came
[9:18] together for to consider this matter. So
[9:20] this was a assembly of the elders, the
[9:23] apostles. It was about doctrine. And of
[9:26] course, St. Paul was there. He was a
[9:28] prophet and a prophet attended meetings.
[9:31] So remember friends, the book of Acts is
[9:33] our blueprint. The book of Acts is the
[9:35] pattern we should all try to attain to
[9:38] as brother Ram said in the church age
[9:39] book. So I think that's a pretty good
[9:41] Bible foundation by God's grace. Now
[9:44] let's look at some quotes from God's
[9:45] prophet. And I'm just going to read
[9:47] them. I'm probably not going to play all
[9:48] these, but I encourage you to go study
[9:51] them yourself. Prove all things. Prove
[9:53] what I'm saying. make sure I'm rightly
[9:55] dividing the word of truth and
[9:56] understanding these quotes correctly.
[9:58] The first one is influence November
[10:01] 30th, 1963.
[10:03] Brother Ram said, "I'm happy to be here
[10:04] this morning, especially for the young
[10:07] people as I understand that this service
[10:09] this morning is dedicated to the young
[10:11] people of Shreveport." And he said it's
[10:14] a highlight, a red letter to get to
[10:17] address the boys and girls that will be
[10:19] tomorrow, if there is a tomorrow. So,
[10:21] we're happy for this. So, brother Ram
[10:22] was happy he got invited to
[10:24] [clears throat] preach directly to the
[10:25] young people. So, anyone that condemns
[10:28] youth services probably doesn't know
[10:30] this quote. Brother Ram then mentions
[10:32] how many different denominations are
[10:34] gathered there. So, Brother Ram preached
[10:37] to different young people from different
[10:38] denominations and was happy to do it.
[10:41] Now, this is only one quote about youth
[10:43] services. So, there could be more, maybe
[10:45] not. I don't know. But I never heard
[10:47] brother Ram condemn youth services. And
[10:49] if so, please show me. Can you please
[10:51] prove me wrong? He was happy to preach
[10:54] to the young people.
[10:56] I'm happy to be here this morning for
[10:58] this fine gathering of of people
[11:02] especially for the young people as I
[11:04] understand that this uh service this
[11:06] morning is dedicated to the young people
[11:09] of Sri
[11:12] and it's a very
[11:14] uh fine time in my life and a highlight
[11:19] I call it a red letter to get to address
[11:22] the boys and girls that will will be
[11:26] tomorrow if there is a tomorrow. That's
[11:28] right.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; So, we're happy for this. How many
[11:31] different denominations is represented
[11:33] here this morning in this little group
[11:34] of people? I'd say Methodist, hold up
[11:36] your hands. I just heard him say from
[11:38] denominations. All right. Baptist, hold
[11:40] up your hands. Fine. Presbyterian,
[11:44] just look. Lutheran,
[11:46] Pentecostals, and and um or Nazarines,
[11:52] Pilgrim Holiness, any other denomination
[11:54] I haven't mentioned. Raise up your hand.
[11:56] Wonder if there's Catholics in here.
[11:58] Let's see them. Raise up your hand.
[11:59] Yeah. See, would there happen to be an
[12:03] Orthodox Jew? Let's see your hand. All
[12:05] right, sir. Sometimes I believe here not
[12:07] long ago the last meeting here we had
[12:08] one of the rabbis here in the meeting
[12:11] from the Jewish Orthodox which is the
[12:15] really the mother of all this. See she
[12:18] brought forth the child the Orthodox
[12:22] church uh brought forth the Christian
[12:25] church out of of Judaism come
[12:28] Christianity.
[12:30] And so we are very happy to see you
[12:32] represented here this morning at your
[12:34] church and your [clears throat] stand.
[12:37] And I I certainly believe this that that
[12:41] God if he should come today, he would he
[12:44] would not ask that question if we were
[12:46] all going in this morning. He would just
[12:49] u take those who are ready to go. Next
[12:53] in token September 1st 1963
[12:57] brother Ram talked about he would go to
[12:59] preach annual meetings in Phoenix. He
[13:02] says then my meetings comes up in
[13:05] Phoenix in January. It's the annual
[13:07] meeting there for Christian businessmen.
[13:09] So brother Ram would go back every year
[13:11] and preach the same convention, the same
[13:14] annual meetings by God's grace. So again
[13:16] we can't condemn annual meetings God did
[13:18] in the Old Testament. Here brother Rams
[13:20] doing in the New Testament. We see the
[13:22] apostles doing it. It's a very
[13:24] scriptural thing to do by God's grace.
[13:26] Then in 1956, April 15th, the deep call
[13:30] to the deep in Columbia, South Carolina.
[13:32] Brother Ram said he was willing to come
[13:33] back the next year for meetings in South
[13:36] Carolina. Brother Ram said, "I trust
[13:37] that by God's help that next April,
[13:40] Brother Bigby told me that he would like
[13:42] for me to return back having full
[13:45] cooperation and fellowship with all the
[13:47] other churches." And there was numerous
[13:49] churches cooperating in these
[13:51] conventions here by God's grace in 1960
[13:56] June 12 speak to the rock shiake Ohio
[13:58] brother Ram said I want to say this that
[14:01] this has been one of the finest revivals
[14:02] or meetings that I've ever had. In
[14:04] paragraph one down in paragraph 11 he
[14:06] says I hope to be here again next year
[14:08] the Lord willing. Thank you. Thank you.
[14:11] And they were revival meetings. So this
[14:13] church in Shiitak, Ohio had annual
[14:16] revival meetings and brother Ram said,
[14:17] "I hope to be again here next year." So
[14:20] a yearly revival meeting. There's
[14:22] nothing wrong with that. Brother Ram was
[14:24] a part of that. He was often a part of
[14:25] that doing the work of an evangelist as
[14:28] the angel Lord told him to do. Show us
[14:31] the father in southern Pines, North
[14:33] Carolina, June 9th, 1962. Brother Ram
[14:37] says, "I love to be there and set under
[14:39] the teaching of these great servants of
[14:41] Christ. Brother Veale, Brother Parker,
[14:43] Brother Iverson, and would like to hear
[14:46] them. So, this kind of goes along with
[14:47] the video I said how brother Ram liked
[14:48] to sit down and say amen and follow the
[14:50] preachers. Here, Brother Ram says it
[14:52] again. He'd like to hear the living men
[14:55] of the five-fold ministry. Brother Ram,
[14:57] he said he loved to hear them carry on
[14:59] in that harmony. He said, "The next man
[15:01] that raises up and carries on the
[15:03] harmony, that's the Holy Spirit." So,
[15:05] brother Ram loved to be in these
[15:06] conventions where men would preach and
[15:08] there was total harmony of all the
[15:10] preachers in the convention. Brother
[15:12] Brham said, "Brother Parker graciously
[15:14] invited him next year if the Lord
[15:16] carries to come back and have a day to
[15:19] just sit and talk of my own experience
[15:22] of how meeting the spirit itself."
[15:25] And then he said, "Brother Parker, his
[15:27] great love, inviting me to come here to
[15:30] this convention and privilege of turning
[15:31] me loose on the platform to say whatever
[15:33] God would put on my heart to say." So
[15:37] again, Brother Ram attended this
[15:38] convention in North Carolina, Southern
[15:40] Pines, and was invited back for the next
[15:42] year. In presuming June 10th, 62,
[15:46] Brother Ram said it was sweet to ask him
[15:48] to come back the next year for the
[15:50] convention. Brother Parker Thomas has
[15:52] been so sweet to ask me to come back
[15:54] again next year in time of the
[15:57] convention. So again, brother Ram
[15:59] repeatedly was asked to come back and
[16:01] preach conventions revival services.
[16:05] And then in 1965,
[16:07] January 25th, this day the scriptures
[16:10] fulfilled, Phoenix, Arizona, Bill Ram
[16:12] said, "I've enjoyed this. I believe this
[16:14] convention more than any convention I've
[16:16] ever been in." He said, "More harmony
[16:19] and such real fellowship and brotherly
[16:22] love." He said, "I've met many new
[16:24] delegates of heaven, new brethren that
[16:26] I've had the privilege to shake hands
[16:27] with and talk to." He said, "Brother
[16:30] Carl announced me to be back next year
[16:32] if the Lord is willing and we are here
[16:35] on earth. And I hope to meet every one
[16:38] of you here next year again and bring
[16:41] another delegate with him and with she."
[16:45] In closing, friends, hope this video was
[16:48] a blessing by the grace of God. Again,
[16:49] we can see the Bible and God's prophet,
[16:52] Brother Brandham, supporting annual
[16:55] revival, annual conventions, loving the
[16:58] harmony of the Holy Spirit between
[17:00] different churches, all these different
[17:02] churches coming together to hold special
[17:03] meetings. Again, it's fulfilling Hebrews
[17:06] 10:24 and 25. and the other verses in
[17:09] the book of Acts where apostles or
[17:11] elders that started churches will come
[17:13] back and visit and see how everyone is
[17:14] doing, overseeing them, just making sure
[17:17] their faith is strong by the grace of
[17:19] God. There's nothing wrong with
[17:20] revivals. Brother Brandham loved having
[17:22] personal revivals as I showed in that
[17:24] last video about Samson. Brother Brham
[17:28] said he needed a revival while Brandham
[17:29] Tabernacle was having a revival even
[17:31] after the seven seals. So friends, let's
[17:34] be positive about youth meetings.
[17:37] revival meetings, conventions, as long
[17:40] as the hearts of the people are pure.
[17:42] Unto the pure, all things are pure. And
[17:45] if there are some conventions that are
[17:46] motivated by social reasons or money,
[17:49] just pray for them. Stay away from them.
[17:51] If you feel led of the Lord, I imagine I
[17:52] would, but if you feel led of the Lord
[17:54] to go to youth meetings or conventions,
[17:56] go to them by the grace of God. And I
[17:58] realize I didn't really share why I
[18:00] don't do it very often. There's a couple
[18:02] reasons I don't do a lot of youth
[18:03] meetings and youth camps. First, uh the
[18:06] financial resources are just limited in
[18:09] our church. We're just a very small
[18:10] church. Takes a lot of financial
[18:12] resources to go rent a convention or
[18:15] some type of campgrounds. It's very
[18:17] expensive. And as a small church, we
[18:19] don't have the means to do that. So, we
[18:21] don't do that. Second, I have a very
[18:23] large family, so it's hard to uproot my
[18:26] whole family with nine children and then
[18:28] go stay at a place for numerous days in
[18:30] a row. I have adult children that work
[18:33] full-time, so it's hard to get all of us
[18:35] to up and leave and also I have a
[18:38] full-time teaching job, public teaching
[18:39] job as well. So, I have to work
[18:41] full-time and then pastor full-time as
[18:43] well. So, the summer would be the only
[18:45] time I could go to conventions. But
[18:47] again, in the summertime, that's my time
[18:49] to relax. That's my time to help out my
[18:51] family. And also, as a pastor, I'm
[18:53] called to stay with the sheep. So,
[18:56] that's the burden I've had for many
[18:57] years, just stay with the local church.
[18:59] Perhaps there'll be a time and season
[19:00] where I go to more youth conventions,
[19:01] youth meetings, and so forth. But right
[19:03] now, I just feel led to stay home, feed
[19:06] the flock of God that God has given me
[19:08] oversight over by the grace of God as a
[19:10] pastor, a earthly shepherd. But of
[19:12] course, I'm under the great shepherd,
[19:14] the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm just trying
[19:16] to be faithful as a shepherd.
[19:18] Additionally, one thing I want to say as
[19:20] well is that when I came in the message,
[19:23] there was really no burden to do youth
[19:26] meetings. I came in the message at the
[19:28] end of 2001 and the emphasis I heard was
[19:32] simply being born again or receiving the
[19:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost that was
[19:36] preached constantly. I never heard about
[19:39] youth meetings. And so I believe I was
[19:41] born again in 2003
[19:45] during a regular Sunday morning service
[19:47] by the grace of God. And I've heard, but
[19:50] I can't recall that there's a quote from
[19:52] Brother Brandham that says, "The way
[19:53] you're born into the kingdom of God is
[19:56] the way you normally continue going."
[19:59] So, if you have that quote, let me know.
[20:00] I'd love to hear it. But I just heard a
[20:03] couple preachers say that quote
[20:04] generally, but I've never seen it
[20:06] myself. So that would make sense to me
[20:08] because I was born again just by daily
[20:11] seeking, reading my Bible, praying,
[20:14] longing, crying out for the Holy Ghost,
[20:16] just going to church every time the
[20:18] church doors were open, reading my Bible
[20:20] every day, praying, seeking God daily.
[20:23] But I understand how others other
[20:26] churches might emphasize these annual
[20:29] youth meetings, annual conventions,
[20:32] annual revivals, and there's nothing
[20:33] wrong with that. But the main thing is
[20:35] to get people born again. And what I've
[20:38] told people in the past too, you know,
[20:39] you don't see the book of Acts having
[20:41] youth meetings. And again, there's
[20:43] nothing wrong with them, but you just
[20:45] see the book of Acts spreading the
[20:47] revival of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[20:49] as Paul ordained elders in every church.
[20:53] Missionaries would take the gospel to
[20:54] places, cities that had no churches.
[20:57] Believers would get saved, filled with
[20:59] the Holy Ghost. churches would be
[21:01] established and then Paul or the
[21:02] apostles would move on. So again, the
[21:05] book of Acts is our blueprint. There's
[21:08] also Christian liberty for churches to
[21:10] have youth camps, youth meetings,
[21:12] revival, and so forth, conventions. So I
[21:15] think again according to my own
[21:17] experience in the message, I've just
[21:19] gone that way. That's all I've known.
[21:22] And even my children, some of my older
[21:23] children have claimed to receive the
[21:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Not in
[21:27] special meetings necessarily or youth
[21:29] camps or conventions, but just simply in
[21:32] the meetings that we already hold
[21:34] consistently by the grace of God. My
[21:37] emphasis has been to just receive the
[21:39] Holy Ghost. Not go somewhere to try to
[21:41] get it, but just in your daily life, get
[21:43] justified, sanctified, and filled with
[21:45] the Holy Ghost. So, I hope that's
[21:47] helpful by the grace of God.
[21:50] And I just want to say this too. It
[21:52] takes great sacrifices to have youth
[21:54] meetings and youth conventions. And God
[21:56] will bless all those people who
[21:57] sacrifice. I think of all the sisters or
[21:59] brothers who cook food for people,
[22:01] donate their time, money, resources.
[22:03] Those are all great sacrifices. And God
[22:05] will richly reward those people. God
[22:08] sees your labor of love and your labor
[22:10] of love is not in vain. So friends, just
[22:12] have a loving heart. Seek you first the
[22:15] kingdom of God. Gather more as we see
[22:17] that day approaching. Do whatever God's
[22:18] called you to do. Whether youth
[22:20] conventions or annual revival meetings,
[22:22] whatever God has called you to do, do
[22:23] it. Draw nigh to God. He will draw nigh
[22:26] to you. If you have any questions,
[22:28] concerns, or testimonies about this
[22:29] video, please contact me.
[22:32] God bless you. And may Jesus Christ be
[22:34] the desire of your [music] heart.
[22:37] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[22:39] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[22:41] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[22:44] good news that Jesus raised from the
[22:46] dead, living among man today, his
[22:48] church. The same Jesus that was
[22:51] yesterday will be today and forever
[22:55] is never failed.
