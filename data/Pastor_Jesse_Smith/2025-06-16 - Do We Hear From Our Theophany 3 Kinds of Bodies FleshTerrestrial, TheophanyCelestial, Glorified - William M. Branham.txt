TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives and journey and death and where we go after we die. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a question I received on email. I was asked, can we hear from our theophony? Now, my answer is I don't know because I can't find a scripture that teaches that we hear from our theophony. And I'll go through my reasons for that, of course, in this video. So, this is an excellent question. This is a question for years I've just put up on the shelf. And so, I hope to get some good feedback in the comments about scriptures that teach whether or not we do hear from our theophony. This question originates from the sermon, who is this Melzdc? Brother preached it in 1965. phenomenal message. He said, "You heard from your theophony. If this earthly body be dissolved, we have one waiting." So over the years, I've asked numerous ministers about this, and I've just said, "Can you give me one scripture that says we hear from our theophony, and I've never been given a scripture yet." So that's okay. I'm just leaving it up on the shelf. It's good to be humble and say, "I don't know if we don't know." And it's good to wait on the Lord because when we wait on the Lord, he renews our strength like the eagle. And of course, this is a minor topic. This is not a major topic. This doesn't pertain to salvation whether we hear from our theophony or not. What my answer has been over the years is that we hear from God's theophony and not our own theophony. But again, I could be wrong. I'm open to correction by the grace of God. Brother Brandham was a genuine prophet of God. He was Malachi 45 and6 turning the hearts of the children back to the fathers. He finished the mysteries of God. Revelation 10:1-7. He was a son of man revealing the son of man. He had the messiahic discernment gift. And it was thus sayith the Lord. It was the last sign to the Gentiles. Brother Ram's ministry of discernment. It was just like the ministry of the Lord Jesus to be able to discern the thoughts and intents of people's hearts. But we also know brother Ram said he was human. He said there was mix-ups on the tapes. He said, "Test me by the word. Prove all things." Brother Ram said, "I don't have all the answers, friends." So, Brother Ram was a humble true prophet of God. But he realized he was not God. He was not perfect. He did not have all the answers. And we as true Christians must take everything God's prophet said back to the Bible. As the Bible said, prove all things. Search the scriptures daily whether these things are so. So, I think I'll start with the Bible foundation. Here's a few screenshots I made uh back in 2016 when I preached on this topic. First of all, there's three kinds of bodies in the Bible. First is terrestrial or the flesh body that we live in here. 1 Corinthians 15:40 and 2 Corinthians 5:1. Second is the celestial or theophony body that's waiting for us there in the seventh dimension or might say the third heaven. According to Matthew 18:10, it's called a building of God. It's a house not made with hands. It's an eternal body. It's our house from heaven. This body doesn't eat physical food. This is according to 1 Corinthians 5:40 and 2 Corinthians 5:1. Thirdly, there's the glorified body that we get in the first resurrection or the pre-tribulation gentile rapture for the bride of Jesus Christ. This glorified body has glorified flesh and bones. It's not a spirit being since it can eat and it's needed for the wedding supper and beyond. Jesus had this glorified body at his resurrection and is still in the glorified body according to John 7:39, John 12:16, Luke 24:37 through 43 and Acts 3:13. This was so beautifully preached by brother Brandham. He said the understanding on these three bodies was the complete secret of our lives in journey and death and where we go after we die. He said that. And who is this Melzdc? Let's listen to the quote. Who is this Melzdc but God? Now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives and journey and death and where we go after we die. Also predestination is in plain view here. Now listen as we teach this closely. The stages of of the eternal purpose he had in his secret has now been revealed. Notice there is still three stages to perfection. Just like he redeems the world same way he redeems his church he redeems the people in three stages. Now look, first is justification like Luther preached. Second, sanctification like Wesley preached. Third, baptism of the Holy Ghost. That's right. Then comes the rapture. So here's some more visuals. Uh the flesh body is also called the terrestrial in 1 Corinthians 15. It eats, drinks, sleeps. It can touch and feel. It can touch and feel glorified bodies because Thomas was able to touch the glorified body of the Lord Jesus after the resurrection. The flesh body is a body of corruption under the curse of death. It has a sin nature in its members according to Romans 7. The theophony is also called a celestial body in the Bible 1 Corinthians 15. It's an eternal body. It's spiritlike. It's an angel-like body and it's waiting in heaven for us when we are here living on earth. So right now all believers have a theophony that's unoccupied according to brother Random. It's waiting in heaven and it's eternal. So it was always in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. Now these celestial or theophony bodies can touch other theophanes and can even touch humans according to Daniel 10:es 8-10 when the angel touches Daniel. In Daniel 10:10 he said and hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. So that was an angelic theophony body touching Daniel's physical body. And a theophony does not sleep, eat or drink. So right now all the saints who've gone on before like Paul, Peter, James, John, brother Brandham, they're in a theophony body now. They don't need to eat, sleep, or drink. And finally is the glorified body. This is a body that can be touched by other flesh bodies like Thomas touching Jesus. It's not a spirit body. It's a glorified flesh body. It can eat food and drink as Jesus did. He ate fish with the disciples after his resurrection. And this is a glorified body needed for the wedding supper, the millennium, and the new Jerusalem, the new city. Next, I'm going to play a quote from God's prophet, Brother Brandham, that says, "The theophony waiting for us in heaven doesn't have a spirit in it." So, this is why I think that we don't hear from our theophony. How can we hear from a body that doesn't have a spirit in it? Because that body's waiting for our spirit and soul to go to it. Brother said this in thirsting for life June 30th 1957. Let's listen to the quote. So the locust which was the son of God went up created by these great mountains of purity of God as those spirits went out and it created uh the logust and it was a body. It was in the form of what we are now, which is called in the clergy spigot of the body that doesn't have a spirit in it. It's a body that's waiting for you Christians. As soon as the life leaves this, you go into that body. When this delivery tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting of the arsonist. I think I'll show this visual as well. It's the order of the manifestation of Jesus and the sons of God. Brother Ram taught this. And who is this? Melazdc. Jesus the man went from thought. He was in the thoughts of God to a theophony or word body. And then he came in flesh through the womb of Mary into a flesh word body cuz he had a word nature. We don't have a word nature in our flesh body yet. We have a sin nature. And fourth, the Lord Jesus then went in a glorified body and that's what he's in right now. Brother Ram says we're different. He said, "We started as a thought." Ephesians 1:4, "Chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world. We skip the theophony and went to the flesh sin body in order to be tested and tempted and overcome. And third, after death, we go to the theophony, which brother Ram also calls a word body, which is also a celestial body. And fourth, we'll get the glorified body at the rapture." If we live to the rapture, brother Ram said, our flesh body will get swallowed up by glorified body and then we'll go to meet the theophony in the air. So I want to play a quote here where brother Ram says, "The theophony is spoken of in 2 Corinthians 5:es 1-5." Brother Ram quotes, "If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one waiting." He said, "That's the He said that's the theophony." Let's listen to the quote. And we if this earthly tabernacle or a body dwelling place be dissolved, we have one already waiting. And in the scriptural terms or the uh ministerial terms, it's called a theosttomy. And in this great body that we go into and wait for the resurrection of this body to come back of the dust when Sunday afternoon the Lord willing I wish to speak on the subject why must we be born again. Next I'll share a quote from Hebrews chapter 4 September 1st evening 1957. Brother Brandham said a theophony is not a glorified body. It's like an angelic body. It has a shape and a form. Let's listen to the quote. In the beginning was the same. He was that great spirit fountain where all the truness, all the love, all the peace, everything that was pure was in this fountain. It began to form a body, a theosy, the kind of body that we go to. Not a glorified body, but an angelic body like has shaped form. So in closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. I think I'll consider this video like a starter video perhaps of a series on theophanes if the comments provide some good feedback. If not, that's totally fine. We'll move on to another topic by the grace of God. But I got an email about this and it was very humble, very good question, a question I've had for many years as well. So again, I believe we hear from God's theophony because I believe our theophones do not have a spirit inside of them because our theophony is like a house. It's just waiting for us up there. It's waiting for us to move into it. Like Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5:es 1-5. But again, I could be wrong. I'm open to correction. We just want to be scriptural in everything we do as we're taught by the Bible and by God's prophet, Brother Brandham. Remember friends, we need two or three witnesses for every word to be established. So, I don't even have one witness that we hear from our theophony. So, that's why I don't preach that. I preach that we hear from God's theophony or the Holy Ghost. And perhaps this topic will lead to the topic of do we have a guardian angel? I believe we do. According to Psalm 34:7, if David had an angel encamped around him, then I believe every believer does because all those who fear the Lord have an angel of the Lord that encamps around them. Brother Ram did say that as well. So perhaps we'll get to those quotes in a future video. by the grace of God. Thank God that the complete secret of our lives in journey and death and where we go after we die has been revealed. Praise God that God showed Brother Brennham these three bodies. We're so thankful we know where we came from, the mind of God, and we know where we're going, our theophony, our eternal house in the heavens. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He is never failed. [Music]
