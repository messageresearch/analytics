[46:46] you just have to be double blessed how
[46:47] about that but anyways i just felt to
[46:50] bring this to the little church this
[46:51] morning i thought this would be a good
[46:53] thing to talk about and that is the
[46:55] ministry of angels
[46:58] amen let's look here hebrews chapter 1
[47:01] verse 6. how many believe in them
[47:02] hallelujah yes sir and their bible
[47:05] doctrine
[47:06] yes a bible doctrine even in hebrews
[47:08] chapter 1
[47:09] verse 6 and also in verse 7. and again
[47:13] when he bringeth in the first begotten
[47:14] into the world he saith and let all the
[47:17] angels of god
[47:19] worship him yes now the angels he saith
[47:22] who maketh his angels spirits and his
[47:25] ministers
[47:27] a flame of fire notice this in christ
[47:29] the mystery brother
[47:30] said so my opinion the first thing that
[47:33] he made
[47:34] was angels
[47:39] heavenly father we are so privileged
[47:42] to be gathered into the house of the
[47:43] lord like this is such an honor for us
[47:46] glory thank you lord as we have
[47:48] experienced no doubt one of the greatest
[47:52] unsettling events more that any
[47:54] christian could experience and that was
[47:56] the closing of the temporary closing of
[47:58] these church doors
[47:59] father what a privilege it is to be able
[48:01] to gather back in them lord we so thank
[48:03] you for the privilege of being able to
[48:05] gather you genesis
[48:06] thank you lord as we open up the bible
[48:07] now and begin to look at some things
[48:09] from not only the scripture but for
[48:10] brother branham
[48:11] i'm praying that you will come and
[48:12] anoint every part of this lord that it
[48:14] will be a benefit to the body of christ
[48:16] yes
[48:17] as we commit the word to you now both
[48:18] speaker and listener
[48:20] in the name of jesus christ we pray amen
[48:23] amen amen god bless you may be seated
[48:27] i'm going to shed this jacket because
[48:29] i'm a hot preacher
[48:31] and it's hot
[48:38] anyways we uh appreciate the lord but
[48:40] that's what happens when you live under
[48:41] holy ghost fire it gets hot sometimes
[48:43] amen that's right brother right
[48:46] so we appreciate the lord and just to
[48:48] let you know a little word about
[48:49] ourselves before we get started you know
[48:52] we haven't we haven't
[48:53] stopped traveling it hasn't shut us out
[48:55] and we we go about three weekends every
[48:57] month still the lord helping us to be
[48:59] able to get to little places and we're
[49:00] trying to be very
[49:01] wise just to let you know up front we've
[49:03] not been around not
[49:04] one person that has any dealings with
[49:06] coca has not been exposed to cove in any
[49:08] way whatsoever
[49:09] i wouldn't be here if i was i'd try to
[49:11] protect you all and myself
[49:13] and uh so the lord's helped us to you
[49:15] know kindly know ahead of time
[49:17] in different little places we had a
[49:18] meeting coming where uh just a day
[49:20] before the meeting or a day and a half
[49:22] for the meeting the brother called and
[49:23] said that
[49:24] some of the people had come down i ended
[49:25] up preaching over the phone to them
[49:26] folks
[49:27] and uh so we've been trying to be very
[49:29] smart
[49:30] now if you are in a condition you don't
[49:32] want to shake hands that's fine just
[49:34] wave at me and smile
[49:35] you know that's all right and uh i
[49:37] certainly understand that
[49:39] but anyways what we're trying to say is
[49:41] that the lord's blessed us throughout
[49:42] the last several months and we had we
[49:45] parked the
[49:46] van the third week of march and didn't
[49:48] move it again until the
[49:49] last weekend of may and uh you know some
[49:52] of the
[49:52] meetings they've been trickling but it's
[49:54] just because of the conditions of the
[49:55] churches and so
[49:57] uh continue to pray for us because i
[49:59] usually speak to you about mission work
[50:01] and some of the things we're doing in
[50:02] missions and what we've got going for
[50:03] the jesse now
[50:05] is we're working with some different
[50:06] brothers who's trying to do some virtual
[50:08] things to go out into those other
[50:09] countries since we can't
[50:11] physically travel and uh so you pray the
[50:14] lord will help us in that because
[50:16] if we can connect the zoom meetings and
[50:17] those type of things skype a lot more
[50:19] you know it's all free of charge and
[50:20] there's no cost associated except for
[50:23] you know somebody's internet bill or
[50:24] something like that but anyways we're
[50:26] trying to do that in the work of
[50:28] missionary we did make it to egypt this
[50:30] year as i told you
[50:32] great and uh god really blessed that
[50:33] meeting it was a wonderful time
[50:35] myself for the jason mars and who was
[50:37] the host of the meeting and brother
[50:39] dale smith and we went in there with
[50:41] brother ken
[50:42] um uh uh
[50:46] ken well kenny cats no not brother kenny
[50:50] no
[50:51] oh he's gonna hear this view and going
[50:53] to say how'd you forget my name anyway
[50:54] i used to go to lyman many many years
[50:56] ago and
[50:57] i see his face but i can't get a
[50:59] passport you see that's what happens
[51:02] hey man i rolled over to bed the other
[51:03] day and i said i i um you
[51:16] something like that anyway i'll think of
[51:18] it i'll call you all at 2 30 in the
[51:19] morning when i remember
[51:21] but anyways real quickly we're just
[51:23] we're just working that in for mission
[51:25] and we've done a
[51:26] few conventions this year uh virtually i
[51:28] participated in an international
[51:30] convention this year
[51:31] that went into about i think they said
[51:33] 16 or 17 nations around the world
[51:35] i had a great response out of that so
[51:37] you know just little things we're trying
[51:39] to do for the lord as we move forward
[51:40] into these things
[51:41] so if you pray for us if you will always
[51:43] continue to pray for the family we
[51:44] need it
[51:45] and as you can see my wife's not here
[51:48] but jesse knows what that's all about
[51:49] it's school time
[51:50] and she's she's working on her master's
[51:53] degree now she's trying to get to
[51:55] graduate school
[51:56] because the hope is to move up into an
[51:58] administrative type position
[52:00] after some years of teaching she got a
[52:02] couple more years to go before she gets
[52:03] what they call a professional license
[52:05] once she gets that then she can just go
[52:07] anywhere around the country and teach
[52:08] and wonderful
[52:09] so you all pray for her she's got quite
[52:11] the load because she has to teach both
[52:13] virtually and in person and
[52:15] it's double duty it's quite a bit and uh
[52:18] but anyways we're we're happy in the
[52:20] lord and very thankful for the way god's
[52:21] been
[52:22] moving for us and i sure appreciate you
[52:24] all his prayers and your support of us
[52:26] through the years and
[52:27] appreciate the opportunity to be here
[52:28] with you like we are right now
[52:30] all right that's all i wanted to show
[52:32] especially
[52:34] all right now let's go back to the
[52:35] scripture there and let's look at
[52:37] hebrews
[52:37] one and six now i just want to take that
[52:39] first verse for a moment
[52:41] and i just want to kind of introduce to
[52:43] you my setting as it was
[52:44] because uh initially when paul
[52:48] begins to bring this scripture together
[52:50] he starts speaking about
[52:52] the first begotten in the world and if
[52:54] you'll notice the first begotten end to
[52:56] the world
[52:57] was not the physical body of the lord
[52:59] jesus christ because we know that
[53:01] brother
[53:01] tells us in questions and answers that
[53:04] the
[53:05] son or the logos that proceeded out of
[53:08] god
[53:08] that was the first light or the first
[53:11] what we would say
[53:12] begotten out of god in other words this
[53:14] is the theophany or melchizedek
[53:16] that would later be seen as melchizedek
[53:18] that proceeds forth comes out of god
[53:20] it is in a way of saying the first
[53:23] begotten
[53:24] of the world and we know that this
[53:26] begotten this melchizedek
[53:28] then becomes jesus christ and now it's
[53:30] not one or two
[53:31] it's not a trinity or trinity but it's
[53:33] one god manifested
[53:35] all in all amen notice that the
[53:38] scripture that paul introduces here
[53:40] is that let all the angels of god
[53:43] worship him so then all of the focus of
[53:46] the angels of the lord then
[53:48] was upon worshipping almighty god now
[53:51] notice that
[53:51] angels then will be made spirits and his
[53:55] ministers
[53:56] a flame of fire so notice how paul kind
[53:58] of puts this together
[54:00] and then here we have another brand in
[54:01] christ the mystery so my opinion
[54:03] the first thing he made was angels so
[54:06] then we know that
[54:07] if god created this community of angels
[54:11] then the purpose
[54:12] behind this creation was not for eternal
[54:15] life and it was not for the purpose of
[54:17] having a uh just because god wanted as
[54:20] they say uh
[54:21] uh to build up his ego and wanted
[54:23] somebody to worship him
[54:24] but there was a purpose in the creation
[54:27] of these angels and you'll notice
[54:29] that the angels of god g-o-d
[54:32] which is an object of worship so not in
[54:35] the eternal form or the unseen form that
[54:38] could not be seen
[54:39] was not officially or considered to be
[54:41] god at that moment because
[54:43] as an object of worship he was not in an
[54:46] object form
[54:47] that could be worshiped so when god
[54:49] creates these angels
[54:50] and then moves into this logos then with
[54:53] jesse
[54:54] the angels hallelujah praise the lord
[54:56] now he is an object
[54:57] of worship so we see a picture now of
[55:01] how that god began in creation
[55:03] with these angels of the lord and how
[55:05] that he came into his own being
[55:07] in god because of these angels of god
[55:10] now peter tells us that
[55:12] there are elect angels so all of these
[55:14] angels that were created
[55:15] there would be a population among these
[55:18] angels
[55:18] that would be elect that could never
[55:21] fall that could never walk away from
[55:22] their position in god
[55:24] and there would be a community of them
[55:25] or a population of them amongst this
[55:27] community
[55:28] that would absolutely fall as satan
[55:30] would become
[55:32] through lucifer's deception and how that
[55:34] he changed everything in heaven and
[55:36] tried to
[55:37] pervert and switch the program around
[55:39] then lucifer the light bearer
[55:42] then becomes the devil then jude records
[55:44] to us
[55:45] that then these angels that once
[55:47] regarded in heaven
[55:48] now they fall and as they fall down from
[55:51] heaven
[55:52] hell is then created to house these
[55:55] demons
[55:56] so hell was not something created
[55:57] initially but then we know the bible
[55:59] said
[55:59] hell was created for the devil and
[56:02] his angels god's angels but his angels
[56:06] so we understand that according to jude
[56:09] then
[56:09] that there was real estate that each of
[56:11] these angels had
[56:12] had had possessed in heaven and all of
[56:15] them had a
[56:16] portion or something say a potion of
[56:18] real estate in heaven
[56:19] and this real estate was something that
[56:22] god had positioned them this is your
[56:24] place
[56:24] i will say on a one to ten scale if the
[56:27] angel was a nine or an eight or a seven
[56:29] whatever
[56:30] powers and gifts that was offered to
[56:32] this angel
[56:33] when he fell from heaven he did not lose
[56:36] sonship
[56:36] he did not lose relationship with god
[56:39] but he left the real estate or as jude
[56:41] says it
[56:42] their first estate that was in heaven or
[56:44] the first condition of these angels
[56:46] so then after falling from heaven if
[56:48] there was an eight or a seven or a one
[56:50] or a three or whatever there was
[56:51] they never lost their creative uh uh
[56:54] being what they were created to be
[56:56] whatever powers or abilities they had
[56:59] when they fell from heaven they come
[57:01] right on down and
[57:02] initially they kept all the same power
[57:04] and
[57:05] and ability that they had but yet now
[57:08] reserved as jude said under chains of
[57:11] darkness and this is why
[57:12] when brother bran would enter into the
[57:14] discernment he'd be standing on the
[57:15] platform and he'd look out over the
[57:17] platform maybe the patient on the
[57:18] platform
[57:19] and he would say i see a dark streak
[57:21] running between you
[57:22] and this person over here and them
[57:25] demons he said
[57:26] are calling for help so once they fell
[57:28] from their first estate
[57:30] and then fall into this place hell of
[57:32] the fifth dimension
[57:33] or the regions of the lost or on the
[57:35] countdown but then call it the horrible
[57:36] dimension
[57:37] then these demons take upon them a
[57:39] shroud of darkness these angels
[57:41] now go from being light and from light
[57:43] bearing now there's a shroud of darkness
[57:45] that falls upon them
[57:47] and now they're identified by this
[57:49] gifted prophet to see that dark streak
[57:51] that dark
[57:52] shadow the woman that had the cancer
[57:54] that was shadowed to death had the black
[57:56] hood
[57:56] over her now that signifies a separation
[58:00] from god because god is light
[58:02] and once they separated from god then
[58:04] there's no darkness in the lord so once
[58:06] they separate from the light
[58:07] then they fall under this shroud of
[58:10] darkness hallelujah
[58:11] that bastard listen to that slow amen
[58:15] now remember that once these angels then
[58:18] are housed in this
[58:19] fifth dimension now these angels that
[58:22] were holy and never smoked never drink
[58:24] never cursed
[58:25] never done any of these things now these
[58:27] demons
[58:28] have separated themselves from their
[58:31] position in god
[58:32] and their only end is the lake of fire
[58:35] remember an angel
[58:37] has no redemption whatsoever
[58:40] an angel cannot be saved an angel cannot
[58:42] be born again
[58:44] an angel cannot be convinced to change
[58:46] their ways
[58:47] whatever they are and whatever choice
[58:49] they make that's what they are even to
[58:50] this day right now
[58:51] yeah so all of those spirits over 6 000
[58:54] years ago if you want to say it that way
[58:56] or ever how many tens of thousands of
[58:58] years ago it might have been
[58:59] this population of angels decided to
[59:02] follow
[59:03] lucifer and all of his lives i want you
[59:05] to think about something
[59:06] we talk about our battles and our trials
[59:08] down here in time
[59:10] but do you realize the actual first
[59:12] rebellion that ever
[59:14] what was constructed or put together the
[59:16] first protest if you want to say
[59:18] actually began in heaven amongst the
[59:21] angels of god
[59:22] right the first rebellious attitude the
[59:25] first rebellious spirit the first
[59:26] rebellious nature
[59:28] it manifested itself in heaven amongst
[59:31] these
[59:31] angels the first war that was ever
[59:34] thought
[59:34] between good and evil took place amongst
[59:37] these angels
[59:38] the first sin that was ever committed
[59:41] actually did not begin on the earth
[59:43] but sin actually began in heaven
[59:47] i'm bigger i'm brighter i'm better than
[59:49] everybody else and you know i'm so much
[59:51] like god
[59:52] i can handle this business all by myself
[59:55] some people still got that kind of idea
[59:56] themselves right
[59:58] but anyhow we need the lord's help no
[59:59] matter amen amen amen
[1:00:01] let me just be very plain to you i used
[1:00:03] to think when i was a boy i'm a new
[1:00:05] christian
[1:00:05] 1415 that uh you know i reach a spot in
[1:00:08] my life that i would come to the place
[1:00:10] to where
[1:00:11] i'd be able to handle the business and
[1:00:13] the closer i got to god the less i would
[1:00:15] need him and
[1:00:16] i'd have more authority and more power
[1:00:18] and i'd come to a place to where
[1:00:20] god wouldn't even have to step in i just
[1:00:21] have it all by the tail and know how to
[1:00:23] handle it i'm coming to find out
[1:00:25] amen been 30 years of the pulpit this
[1:00:27] coming june and 30 years serving the
[1:00:29] lord i've been
[1:00:30] saved going on 32 years but i received
[1:00:32] the holy ghost
[1:00:33] about 30 years ago and in that 32 year
[1:00:36] span that
[1:00:37] even going back to when i was six years
[1:00:39] old when i first felt the touch of the
[1:00:40] lord
[1:00:41] i can honestly tell you from a baby all
[1:00:44] the way up to right now a 43 year old
[1:00:46] man
[1:00:46] that i not only need him more and even
[1:00:49] more so than i thought but there's not a
[1:00:51] day of this life that i live in this
[1:00:53] life
[1:00:55] i can't wake up and say lord help me i
[1:00:57] can't go through the debt lord
[1:00:58] i need your strength i need your help i
[1:01:00] need your grace i can't live without it
[1:01:03] he's my focus on my purpose amen amen it
[1:01:06] should be ours as well don't you agree
[1:01:08] lord and i think so now remember that
[1:01:10] these angels of the lord them
[1:01:12] have certain characteristics about them
[1:01:14] that have been thoroughly
[1:01:16] identified in the bible though slowly
[1:01:19] hinted
[1:01:20] at throughout scripture i'll give you an
[1:01:21] example of what i mean we know pardon me
[1:01:24] that the angels of the lord
[1:01:26] can take on a natural characteristic
[1:01:29] and we didn't know this until later on
[1:01:32] but just look for example at the serpent
[1:01:34] when the serpent was standing there in
[1:01:35] the garden of eden
[1:01:36] we know that the devil actually took
[1:01:38] this being over
[1:01:40] and after using this serpent to convince
[1:01:42] eve
[1:01:43] to break the word of god then satan
[1:01:46] moves off of this serpent and then just
[1:01:48] goes right on to the next task of the
[1:01:50] next thing that he added his ambition
[1:01:52] so satan lucifer who was an
[1:01:55] angel actually took on a human form
[1:01:58] to speak to eve and to try to convince
[1:02:00] eve of what it was thank you
[1:02:03] of what it was that god was trying to
[1:02:05] hide from her as he said
[1:02:07] that god's trying to keep things from
[1:02:08] you you'll be as a god you'll know good
[1:02:10] and evil
[1:02:11] so it was an angel or lucifer or the
[1:02:13] devil
[1:02:14] taking a human form and coming down and
[1:02:17] manifesting himself through the serpent
[1:02:19] in his life then we know of course that
[1:02:22] in genesis 19 verse 1 that the two
[1:02:25] angels that moved down to sodom to go
[1:02:27] visit lot of course there's three angels
[1:02:29] initially
[1:02:30] the ones that uh come to abraham and
[1:02:32] when he sees those three
[1:02:34] he looks at three and calls him lord
[1:02:37] amen
[1:02:37] that's the true revelation of the god
[1:02:40] and i don't care what these critics and
[1:02:42] what these defectors and these people
[1:02:44] are trying to say and
[1:02:45] and i watched some of the debate the
[1:02:47] other night i was very thankful to the
[1:02:48] lord that somebody's speaking up against
[1:02:50] this nonsense
[1:02:51] but i don't care what that bunch is
[1:02:52] saying the very fact that you deny the
[1:02:55] very godhead of jesus christ you're a
[1:02:57] trinitarian
[1:02:58] you're a heathen and you need to repent
[1:02:59] and get saved amen and actually my
[1:03:01] message if i would have a message to
[1:03:03] send
[1:03:04] over to the critics of the defectors is
[1:03:05] this brother jesse let's not talk
[1:03:07] doctrine let's not talk brother brad
[1:03:09] let's not talk scripture
[1:03:10] let's talk about y'all getting saved
[1:03:12] because you behave like a bunch of
[1:03:14] humans live like a bunch of humans
[1:03:16] your life is not even scripturally right
[1:03:18] according to the bible
[1:03:19] i say i call you to repentance get saved
[1:03:21] get born again
[1:03:22] amen because you need the baptism of the
[1:03:24] holy ghost like one preacher that left
[1:03:26] this message said well it's not about
[1:03:28] what wine i drove about drinking wine it
[1:03:30] says about choosing which one i like the
[1:03:32] best
[1:03:32] you need to repent that's right some of
[1:03:34] these men cut their hair and wearing
[1:03:36] pants oh that's old testament yes but
[1:03:38] the scripture that they report all the
[1:03:39] time
[1:03:40] about brother branham being a false
[1:03:41] prophet his old testament
[1:03:45] amen so let's just be honest today amen
[1:03:47] what is it it's demon power
[1:03:49] it's the devil that moves on human
[1:03:51] beings to try to convince them just
[1:03:54] as satan the first angel did yeah the
[1:03:56] first demon did
[1:03:57] convince eve against the word so is
[1:03:59] these spirits in the last day doing the
[1:04:01] same things
[1:04:01] right amen amen i don't call men and
[1:04:04] things that have
[1:04:05] denied the message i listened to a man
[1:04:06] my mother and i was listening to a man
[1:04:08] this morning the one that wrote
[1:04:09] god's generals and he praised brother
[1:04:11] branham and put him on a very high
[1:04:13] pedestal and talked about
[1:04:14] what a great man he was and the gifts of
[1:04:16] god he said oh but when he got into that
[1:04:18] teaching of course they're trinitarians
[1:04:20] and they're baptized in trinity right
[1:04:22] all that of course they don't like that
[1:04:23] teaching because this is a bible
[1:04:26] doctrine that god is one not three yeah
[1:04:29] he is one
[1:04:29] yeah praise the lord thank you amen and
[1:04:32] if they plan on grabbing this clip and
[1:04:34] throwing it on their website so be it
[1:04:36] but i
[1:04:36] i'm not afraid to stand up for what i
[1:04:38] believe is bible christianity
[1:04:40] amen i believe in my heart that if a
[1:04:42] woman is a woman a man is a man we ought
[1:04:44] to dress like it act like that's like
[1:04:52] jesus
[1:04:57] have mercy like it amen so we realized
[1:04:59] then that these angels then took this
[1:05:01] human form
[1:05:02] and when these two angels then appeared
[1:05:05] down to lot
[1:05:06] lord said my lords that's a plural on
[1:05:09] that if you didn't get that
[1:05:10] amen and then notice that they were the
[1:05:12] angels of the lord
[1:05:13] that visited lot down in sodom all right
[1:05:16] now don't forget
[1:05:17] when you say well that's old testament
[1:05:19] seems to be the battle cry of people
[1:05:20] these days and
[1:05:21] they read the old testament well that's
[1:05:22] old testament yes but it's the bible
[1:05:24] yes and we believe in the old testament
[1:05:26] we know what yes if you want to
[1:05:28] understand the old testament
[1:05:30] you must filter it through the apostle
[1:05:31] paul that's god's filter for the new
[1:05:33] testament yes amen and paul was to teach
[1:05:35] us about
[1:05:36] mixing our clothing and about not eating
[1:05:38] you know animals with hor
[1:05:39] uh uh a a fort hood for food something i
[1:05:43] said
[1:05:43] amen poor tools or things of that like
[1:05:45] pig or something like that
[1:05:47] amen paul would have dealt with it in
[1:05:49] the new testament that was god's filter
[1:05:51] that was god's bridge
[1:05:52] to tell us what we were going to carry
[1:05:54] over and what was it
[1:05:56] amen the apostle paul come right over
[1:05:59] the new testament and teach a woman how
[1:06:01] to dress and how to be here
[1:06:07] amen he talked about marriage and
[1:06:09] divorce he talked about the difference
[1:06:10] between a woman and a man
[1:06:12] he said from the beginning it was not so
[1:06:14] that is a law now there's something to
[1:06:17] be carried over
[1:06:18] right amen they tell us what it's
[1:06:20] supposed to be so we say well paying
[1:06:22] tithes you know this is a thing an
[1:06:23] argument about
[1:06:24] well paying tithes is an old testament
[1:06:26] doctrine i understand what they're
[1:06:28] trying to say
[1:06:29] i get what they're trying to say but the
[1:06:31] silence of the scripture the fact that
[1:06:33] the new testament
[1:06:34] nor paul peter john or none of the rest
[1:06:36] of them condemn
[1:06:37] the offering of tithing into the house
[1:06:40] of god their
[1:06:41] silence is permission to what we're
[1:06:42] supposed to do today amen we're supposed
[1:06:44] to offer our tithes
[1:06:46] offer our offerings and give it into the
[1:06:48] storehouse
[1:06:50] that's not just one building in indiana
[1:06:52] that's wherever you get your passport
[1:06:54] right that's what the holy spirit amen
[1:06:58] amen amen that's right it's not supposed
[1:07:00] to go to new york or to go to arizona or
[1:07:02] go down here they're
[1:07:03] supposed to come where you get your
[1:07:04] father
[1:07:06] that's the pastor that preaches to you
[1:07:08] that's right now notice again
[1:07:10] angels can take on this human form and
[1:07:12] even did so in the new testament would
[1:07:14] you like to see that
[1:07:15] hebrews chapter 13 verse 2 now notice
[1:07:18] what the apostle paul said
[1:07:19] we believe the writer of hebrews is paul
[1:07:21] because his language and so forth is
[1:07:23] so much the same yes and notice he said
[1:07:26] be not forgetful to
[1:07:28] entertain strangers all right well paul
[1:07:30] tell us why
[1:07:32] for thereby some have entertained
[1:07:35] angels unawares now you know in this day
[1:07:38] and age if we walked out here we saw a
[1:07:40] big ufo going
[1:07:42] through it'd be on facebook tweeting we
[1:07:44] tweeted we twitter it we knew everything
[1:07:46] in the world
[1:07:46] it'd be all over the world before
[1:07:48] midnight we saw this unidentified flying
[1:07:51] object but i wonder sometimes if we
[1:07:53] don't miss the mark a little bit
[1:07:55] by god when he sends into the church
[1:07:57] house unidentified flying visitors
[1:08:01] right maybe to check and see what our
[1:08:03] attitude perhaps might be
[1:08:05] toward those individuals that will just
[1:08:06] come in unannounced maybe we'd have
[1:08:08] a type of spirit toward him to show him
[1:08:10] grace show him mercy show him love
[1:08:13] because remember the church is supposed
[1:08:14] to be a hospital
[1:08:16] where if you're sick you can come and
[1:08:18] find healing amen this is the
[1:08:20] the good the the parable of the good
[1:08:22] samaritan it is that pastor that brings
[1:08:24] them into the end
[1:08:25] and begins to bind up their wounds and
[1:08:27] bring them back to perfect
[1:08:28] amen amen the church is supposed to be
[1:08:32] a hospital but the church is also
[1:08:34] supposed to be a judgment seat
[1:08:36] then if the body of jesus christ
[1:08:38] assembled together as jesus said where
[1:08:41] two or three
[1:08:42] are gathered here in my name i'll be
[1:08:44] right here in the midst of that
[1:08:46] then not only is the forgiver here but
[1:08:48] the judge is also
[1:08:49] president setting up the door watching
[1:08:52] the motives and the objectives of the
[1:08:54] church
[1:08:54] remember that in the old testament the
[1:08:57] holy spirit said
[1:08:58] he would send evil angels among those
[1:09:01] people to test them
[1:09:02] and remember the prophet tells us in
[1:09:04] christ is the mystery that once the body
[1:09:06] of christ
[1:09:07] gathers as it were or collects himself
[1:09:09] around the message of the hour for their
[1:09:11] day and for their time
[1:09:13] he said that it goes good for a while he
[1:09:15] said but then all of a sudden
[1:09:16] evil angels or fallen angels he called
[1:09:19] it will come and get into that message
[1:09:21] and try to stir up all kinds of chaos
[1:09:23] and nonsense
[1:09:24] all right listen friends i'm going to be
[1:09:26] honest with you it does
[1:09:28] i i when i look at the people that have
[1:09:29] left this message and they deny the
[1:09:31] message and they think it's a bunch of
[1:09:32] nonsense
[1:09:33] i don't blame some people for being
[1:09:35] offended at the way they are
[1:09:37] i mean they've gone to churches and they
[1:09:38] have been so mistreated and
[1:09:40] and and judged and made fun of and all
[1:09:43] kinds of filth and things
[1:09:45] i circled through our ranks but listen
[1:09:47] to me don't blame that on william
[1:09:49] branham don't blame him
[1:09:52] [Applause]
[1:09:54] amen it's the devil of good evil
[1:09:56] influences that
[1:09:57] stirred up all of this mess that's got
[1:09:59] us in the condition we're in today amen
[1:10:02] that's why we need men of god to call it
[1:10:03] out
[1:10:04] that's right praise god we need a holy
[1:10:07] ghost
[1:10:07] son of god that's got a gift in his life
[1:10:10] that can step here in this platform
[1:10:12] and when he sees the devil moving
[1:10:13] identify it yes
[1:10:19] simply just identify the truth of what
[1:10:22] is amongst us whether it be good whether
[1:10:23] it be bad
[1:10:24] if we would simply take time to identify
[1:10:27] the spirit of god and the spirit of the
[1:10:29] devil then the people
[1:10:30] can rightly judge which way is which
[1:10:31] hallelujah yes
[1:10:34] one or two opinions many times brother
[1:10:36] because we don't have the right kind of
[1:10:38] orders from the pulpit yes sir and when
[1:10:40] we blend these things together and just
[1:10:42] preach happy messages and good
[1:10:43] one-liners and make everybody feel good
[1:10:45] and they go home
[1:10:46] they go home not knowing what the devil
[1:10:47] looks like that's right brother right
[1:10:49] it's the lord and you've got to identify
[1:10:51] it you've got to call these things out
[1:10:53] unless the people don't know what right
[1:10:55] and wrong looks like
[1:10:56] yes i mean i live in a world where every
[1:10:58] day of my life it is day and then this
[1:11:00] night
[1:11:01] yeah and yet when it comes to the pulpit
[1:11:03] we're supposed to preach the day and
[1:11:04] never talk about the night
[1:11:06] but yet i live in a world where there is
[1:11:16] somehow when it comes to the house of
[1:11:17] god we're just supposed to preach about
[1:11:19] red roses and pink bunnies
[1:11:21] amen the house of god is a judgment
[1:11:35] the two spirits would be so close as
[1:11:37] jesus remarked and he said but yet we as
[1:11:39] the bride in the last day
[1:11:41] would not only call it out but we would
[1:11:43] withstand what's the most
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:50] and it's not just sin because william
[1:11:52] branham said it was sin it's not just
[1:11:53] sin because me or brother jesse or some
[1:11:55] other preacher said so
[1:11:56] it is sin because god in his word
[1:11:59] declares
[1:11:59] what is right and what is wrong amen now
[1:12:02] notice again
[1:12:03] in psalm chapter 8 verse 5 notice the
[1:12:06] bible speaking about jesus
[1:12:08] identifying that he was made a little
[1:12:10] lower than the angels
[1:12:12] now i'm going to take this in a certain
[1:12:14] way and i hope you understand my meeting
[1:12:16] i'm going to try to be very very gentle
[1:12:17] as i say this next remarks because
[1:12:19] we've got younger ears sitting in the
[1:12:21] church this morning but there is a
[1:12:22] reason
[1:12:23] that the lord jesus was made differently
[1:12:26] than the angels of god
[1:12:27] in other words there were no glands to
[1:12:30] make children and
[1:12:31] and and reproductive systems to make
[1:12:34] children
[1:12:34] in angels an angel cannot propagate
[1:12:37] their species
[1:12:38] right an angel has no ability amen to
[1:12:41] feel the call of being a father
[1:12:42] a man to marry a wife fall in love with
[1:12:44] a girl and
[1:12:45] and have a household full of kids you
[1:12:47] know three or four or eight or 12 or
[1:12:48] whatever
[1:12:49] whatever the likes of the number is and
[1:12:52] i i laughed to myself when i think
[1:12:54] uh about i i saw on facebook the number
[1:12:57] eight coming i laughed at myself and
[1:12:58] samantha when she lived in pennsylvania
[1:13:00] up there in albion
[1:13:02] you know there was a lady she was an
[1:13:03] amish lady that had 17 children
[1:13:05] amen and i got to laugh at it i told sam
[1:13:08] when i saw the announcement i said
[1:13:09] brother jesse's halfway there
[1:13:12] and then he's working he's working his
[1:13:14] way up jacob's lap
[1:13:16] that's right but oh you know may god
[1:13:18] bless you with a hundred more just like
[1:13:19] it i
[1:13:20] you got some good kids sitting here they
[1:13:22] love the lord and they try to serve the
[1:13:23] lord thank god for them thank you
[1:13:25] man they're little treasures yes he
[1:13:28] looks little but he's bad
[1:13:41] amen but if it meant defending his
[1:13:42] family maybe so who knows
[1:13:44] but however we see the holy spirit then
[1:13:47] banging into this understanding about
[1:13:49] angels that angels have no
[1:13:50] reproductive system within them now
[1:13:53] notice
[1:13:53] jesus then was made lower than the
[1:13:56] angels now let's catch this trail
[1:13:58] coming from the top moving down to the
[1:14:00] bottom the angels of god were made
[1:14:02] they had no glands in their lips they
[1:14:04] had no sexual reproductive system
[1:14:06] and so when they angel right and then
[1:14:08] jesus was made the angels
[1:14:10] he was made lower than the angels were
[1:14:13] they uh
[1:14:14] human type people sure they have like a
[1:14:17] uh
[1:14:17] physiology about like a man would have
[1:14:19] uh they have arms they have legs you
[1:14:21] know they can speak they have hair
[1:14:23] brother venom talked about when he saw
[1:14:24] the angel of the lord
[1:14:25] uh you know he didn't talk about the
[1:14:27] colors of their eyes and you know
[1:14:28] different things like that
[1:14:30] but yet they're not men in terms of
[1:14:32] there is no tree of knowledge of good
[1:14:34] and evil for an
[1:14:35] angel to partake of but a man was made
[1:14:38] jesus then was created under this sexual
[1:14:41] order all right now follow my thought
[1:14:43] now notice that in matthew chapter 22
[1:14:46] verse 30
[1:14:47] notice then that the bible now we went
[1:14:49] from the top to the bottom now we're
[1:14:51] going from the bottom back to the top
[1:14:53] now the bible said that once we are born
[1:14:55] again of the holy spirit
[1:14:57] then our bodies will be changed going
[1:15:00] back up now watch this
[1:15:01] from the resurrection though neither
[1:15:02] merit nor given in marriage
[1:15:05] now we understand what that means but he
[1:15:07] said as are the angels of god
[1:15:10] in heaven so notice that the angels of
[1:15:13] the lord
[1:15:14] i just want to take this for just a
[1:15:15] moment that the angels of the lord don't
[1:15:17] know what it means to fall in love
[1:15:19] they don't know what it means to as us
[1:15:21] brothers you know lay your eyes on that
[1:15:23] pretty girl and
[1:15:24] there's a little jump that takes place
[1:15:26] on the inside of it
[1:15:27] amen brother adam talked about that he
[1:15:29] said that whenever adam first looked at
[1:15:31] eve he said there was a little
[1:15:33] that moved in he said that set a strain
[1:15:34] down to humanity
[1:15:36] amen and and i remember you know the
[1:15:38] first time i had a little
[1:15:40] with sam you know i i i i just fell in
[1:15:42] love with her
[1:15:43] and and and i thought about her all the
[1:15:45] way home lieutenant went from
[1:15:46] tennessee back to ohio i thought about
[1:15:48] it the whole time couldn't get it off my
[1:15:50] mind
[1:15:50] amen it was just a a wonderful
[1:15:53] experience
[1:15:54] and and but an angel doesn't understand
[1:15:56] that they don't know what it means you
[1:15:57] know
[1:15:58] to long to have a conversation or want
[1:16:01] to sit down and talk to him a little bit
[1:16:02] more find out a little bit more about
[1:16:03] him angels don't get that
[1:16:05] but a human being is made with a certain
[1:16:08] physiology
[1:16:09] that their systems are under the order
[1:16:11] of the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:16:13] evil which we know is the sexual program
[1:16:15] right now remember even brother branham
[1:16:17] said because our whole
[1:16:19] system is made up under this order under
[1:16:21] these
[1:16:22] these orders of god that the day you eat
[1:16:24] there is the day you die remember
[1:16:26] that our bodies also bear because of
[1:16:29] reproduction
[1:16:30] it bears in our body the marks of
[1:16:34] iniquity that has come from generations
[1:16:36] of our family
[1:16:37] yeah so in my cells right now in my dna
[1:16:40] it is not only the sins of my father but
[1:16:43] it would be my grandfather and then all
[1:16:44] the way back
[1:16:45] so many generations come back to adam
[1:16:47] from the very beginning
[1:16:49] all of that sin chases down it branches
[1:16:51] out in many different fingers and
[1:16:53] splinters in different directions right
[1:16:55] until there is a a a combination of
[1:16:58] those things
[1:16:58] that have fallen into my body why
[1:17:01] because of the
[1:17:02] tree of knowledge of good and evil there
[1:17:04] are aspects of my temper
[1:17:06] that is probably just me but there's
[1:17:07] aspects of my temper
[1:17:09] that would be my granddad and my
[1:17:10] great-granddad and aunt suzabel and aunt
[1:17:13] lucy and uncle owen and
[1:17:14] whoever else is around amen and now i
[1:17:17] want you to pay attention now
[1:17:18] that the angels of the lord don't
[1:17:20] understand that they do not know what it
[1:17:23] means to be a
[1:17:24] product of generations of sin or
[1:17:26] disgrace or whatever it might be
[1:17:28] blessings on the other side so the
[1:17:30] angels of god them brother jesse
[1:17:32] have never smoked never drank never
[1:17:34] cursed never lied never committed
[1:17:36] adultery
[1:17:37] never had one sin that has been poured
[1:17:40] into their system
[1:17:41] through a reproductive system lord of
[1:17:43] those angels
[1:17:44] understand what it means to wrestle with
[1:17:46] mommies and patients
[1:17:48] right right or that is whatever his is
[1:17:51] you know
[1:17:51] they don't understand what that means
[1:17:53] now watch this
[1:17:54] to talk about justification as a child
[1:17:57] of god
[1:17:58] once i receive the holy ghost my soul is
[1:18:00] justified
[1:18:01] i am forgiven how as though it never
[1:18:04] took place
[1:18:05] in the beginning but when my body is
[1:18:08] changed watch what jesus said
[1:18:10] then i will be made just like the angels
[1:18:13] which are in heaven
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:17] amen
[1:18:24] amen
[1:18:30] [Applause]
[1:18:38] our bodies will be justified in such a
[1:18:40] manner that you won't have great
[1:18:42] granddaddy's impatience
[1:18:43] yes amen and if you struggle today we'll
[1:18:46] say with like temper you know i'm just
[1:18:48] using
[1:18:49] common average things but if you
[1:18:50] struggle with temper today that's not
[1:18:52] just your temper your fight
[1:18:54] that's years of generations of temper
[1:18:56] and anger and things that's been poured
[1:18:57] into you
[1:18:58] right brother scientists call it the
[1:19:00] grab bag of human life
[1:19:02] what a gift package and all of this that
[1:19:05] lays inside of you it's not just you
[1:19:07] that's battling
[1:19:08] yourself but you're battling generations
[1:19:10] of things but
[1:19:11] jesus said we would be made like the
[1:19:13] angels of god in heaven
[1:19:15] and did you know some of you boys and
[1:19:16] girls sitting here and i just say this
[1:19:18] for your benefit as much as the older
[1:19:20] ones here but
[1:19:21] you know brother man talked about not
[1:19:22] even a boy and girl kissing
[1:19:24] you know i read a study here the other
[1:19:26] day uh from some experts that were doing
[1:19:28] some scientific research
[1:19:30] about dna the passing of dna they took
[1:19:33] two individuals that were
[1:19:34] you know elementary school sweethearts
[1:19:36] or whatever they was
[1:19:38] and they took these individuals and they
[1:19:40] took swabs out of their mouth and so
[1:19:42] forth like that
[1:19:43] and they've done some testing to break
[1:19:45] down to see if they could
[1:19:47] catch the swapping of dna and if that
[1:19:49] dna still existed
[1:19:51] and so they took these two individuals
[1:19:53] they swabbed them out and they
[1:19:55] confessed you know that they had their
[1:19:56] first kiss maybe when they was 10 or 12
[1:19:58] or what it was
[1:19:59] 40 years later they could still find the
[1:20:02] dna from the other person
[1:20:04] in their mouth 40 years later brother
[1:20:07] branham said it's a potential sex act
[1:20:10] it's potentially committing adultery and
[1:20:12] these people out here that say
[1:20:14] brother branham didn't know what he was
[1:20:15] talking about i'm sorry
[1:20:17] you don't know what you're talking about
[1:20:18] all right if science even proves
[1:20:21] some of these things are absolutely the
[1:20:22] truth that if a man or woman
[1:20:25] was to kiss one another remember brother
[1:20:27] battle said a man does that he's morally
[1:20:29] obligated to marry that woman and he
[1:20:31] should be
[1:20:32] he should be morally obligated to marry
[1:20:34] her morally now we're not talking
[1:20:36] scripture now
[1:20:37] but morally why because it is the
[1:20:39] passing of these genetics
[1:20:41] the dna showed up 40 years down the road
[1:20:45] 40 years they still had each other's dna
[1:20:48] in their mouths
[1:20:49] amen it goes to prove that our systems
[1:20:51] our bodies because we're made
[1:20:53] under the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:20:55] evil we are made
[1:20:56] to house the generations that's been
[1:20:58] poured into us
[1:21:00] amen and if that be the case i'll say
[1:21:02] this in a veiled way
[1:21:03] but what about all these men and women
[1:21:05] on friday nights and saturday nights and
[1:21:07] after football games and after uh bar
[1:21:10] nights and
[1:21:10] all of that what kind of a mix and
[1:21:12] conglomeration you think is going on in
[1:21:14] america
[1:21:15] today right right not to mention around
[1:21:17] the world what kind of things are being
[1:21:19] swapped and shared and all around
[1:21:21] and they might carry on about all of
[1:21:23] their their their great securities of
[1:21:25] how they protect themselves but brother
[1:21:27] at the end of the day it's more than
[1:21:28] just a physical act they're actually
[1:21:30] swapping out today right
[1:21:33] yes don't tell me there's not a
[1:21:35] hybridization going on that's going on
[1:21:36] right before our eyes
[1:21:38] yes sir i mean they advertise it they
[1:21:39] put it on billboards they show it
[1:21:41] because it's a tree of knowledge of good
[1:21:43] and evil but i like this in luke chapter
[1:21:45] 20 verse 36
[1:21:46] jesus said that we cannot die anymore
[1:21:50] amen because we are equal unto the
[1:21:53] angels
[1:21:54] why our bodies then will be changed now
[1:21:58] watch
[1:21:58] and are the children of god being the
[1:22:01] children
[1:22:01] of the resurrection so our bodies then
[1:22:05] are changed into that infinite condition
[1:22:08] where there has never been one cell swap
[1:22:12] except for god amen god god god
[1:22:15] god god amen praise god praise god
[1:22:18] oh bless the lord and hallelujah amen
[1:22:21] bless the lord o my
[1:22:22] soul notice now angels do not have
[1:22:25] infinite knowledge yes did you know that
[1:22:28] yes sir
[1:22:29] look here in mark chapter 13 verse 32
[1:22:31] but of that day and hour no man knows
[1:22:34] not the angels which are in heaven
[1:22:36] neither the son
[1:22:37] but the father all right so jesus said
[1:22:41] the angels don't know the day nor the
[1:22:44] hour here's another one in revelation
[1:22:45] chapter eight verse one when he opened
[1:22:47] up the seventh seal there were silence
[1:22:48] in heaven about the space of a half an
[1:22:50] hour
[1:22:50] and brother adam said the reason that
[1:22:52] took place is because the angels of god
[1:22:54] went completely mute
[1:22:56] because they never heard the mystery of
[1:22:57] god that was going forth like what they
[1:23:00] heard
[1:23:01] and they noticed that even if an angel
[1:23:02] would have flooded a wing might have
[1:23:03] given away a secret
[1:23:05] it's a god when he hollered out that
[1:23:07] lion roared out there
[1:23:08] everything went silent and they sat in
[1:23:12] all
[1:23:12] as they listened to the revelation
[1:23:14] coming forth the mystery that was going
[1:23:15] to break
[1:23:16] from that silence amen from the lion
[1:23:18] roaring and from the thunders and
[1:23:19] sounding their voices to break forth the
[1:23:21] revelation
[1:23:22] of what it was amen the angels of god
[1:23:24] kept themselves completely still and
[1:23:26] quiet
[1:23:27] now if they don't know the day nor the
[1:23:29] hours jesus said in matthew 24 36
[1:23:31] no man knows the day nor the hour not
[1:23:34] the angels that are in heaven
[1:23:36] then you and i right now this very
[1:23:38] moment should be rejoicing
[1:23:40] until we lose our breath to know that
[1:23:42] satan who was an
[1:23:43] angel does not have perfect knowledge
[1:24:01] but because the angels don't know it
[1:24:03] they don't know what to do with them
[1:24:04] [Applause]
[1:24:09] it opens up the channel there to realize
[1:24:11] that that dumb old devil only knows what
[1:24:14] god lets you know
[1:24:16] hallelujah amen and safety with all of
[1:24:18] his wisdom
[1:24:19] still don't understand the great
[1:24:20] mysteries of this bible all right
[1:24:23] all right
[1:24:26] amen let me tell you something friends
[1:24:28] one reason that i get up here and preach
[1:24:30] like i preach and say the things that i
[1:24:32] say is because to me
[1:24:33] this message in this bible is more than
[1:24:36] a bunch of catchphrases and cliches
[1:24:38] right to me the message of the hour is a
[1:24:40] revelation of secrets
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:54] i believe those secrets are being
[1:24:56] revealed to us hallelujah
[1:24:58] amen and then these fellows they stand
[1:25:00] up oh you know brother brown just
[1:25:01] plagiarized larkin and that's all the
[1:25:03] message was to you you needed to get out
[1:25:05] that's right amen it's not just the
[1:25:07] repeating of a bunch of doctrinal
[1:25:08] phrases shame on you
[1:25:10] that's right i don't know better than
[1:25:11] that about the message of the hour i
[1:25:12] don't care who you are
[1:25:13] what your name is but let's learn the
[1:25:15] revelation you don't run a revelation
[1:25:17] god reveals himself yes
[1:25:20] there is
[1:25:32] amen unless god reveals it it's more
[1:25:34] than a collection of catchphrases
[1:25:36] yes sir this message is more just than
[1:25:38] just a well brother random he pulled
[1:25:40] from this and he pulled from that yes he
[1:25:41] did same as i do same as you do
[1:25:44] which one of you sisters in here hey man
[1:25:46] when you go to cook
[1:25:48] make cookies or bake a pie or do some
[1:25:50] kind of a recipe i don't know some of
[1:25:51] your brothers may cook too
[1:25:53] i don't know about you but when i pull a
[1:25:55] recipe i i go to find somebody that's
[1:25:57] done something with it
[1:25:58] i want to see what they've done amen and
[1:26:01] while i've got it in my hands i may
[1:26:03] realize they use too much lemon juice
[1:26:05] so i may tweak it the flavor may not be
[1:26:07] right with that much lemon juice i may
[1:26:09] change that around i would use less
[1:26:10] lemon juice
[1:26:11] that's all brother branham did he took
[1:26:13] all of these great mysteries of god that
[1:26:14] tasted good for the age
[1:26:17] they was all right i enjoyed
[1:26:21] amen but to them the flavoring of the
[1:26:23] hour of what jesus christ longer healed
[1:26:25] brother man would take him recipes and
[1:26:27] he would change them up so they'd have
[1:26:29] the right
[1:26:41] [Applause]
[1:27:01] and it tastes good before i couldn't
[1:27:04] read it with the right flavor that's
[1:27:06] right
[1:27:07] i think god was mad at me right remember
[1:27:10] brother
[1:27:10] said the same thing he said i used to
[1:27:12] think god was mad at me and jesus loved
[1:27:14] me until i realized they were the same
[1:27:15] thing
[1:27:16] what happened the recipe
[1:27:22] you know sometimes when you take a
[1:27:23] bitter taste and a sweet taste
[1:27:25] you think well that bitter taste is
[1:27:27] awful i'll give you an example who likes
[1:27:29] chocolate in here
[1:27:31] yeah you ever tasted cow coffee
[1:27:35] it's as bitter as almost chewing on the
[1:27:36] back of that that chair right there
[1:27:39] but you put some milk in it you put some
[1:27:40] sweetener in it and that bitter taste
[1:27:42] becomes what you were shooting your hand
[1:27:43] up about it
[1:27:47] because the recipe doesn't always mean
[1:27:49] that everything tastes good at the time
[1:27:51] so here you have martin luther he would
[1:27:53] serve up the dish he would have certain
[1:27:55] things that were right
[1:27:56] certain things that were wrong yes yes
[1:27:58] but the master chef of the last hour
[1:28:01] took all of the recipes
[1:28:14] [Applause]
[1:28:19] was it a good revelation
[1:28:29] right yes sir sometimes you have to
[1:28:30] understand that this
[1:28:32] messenger of god was not sent to come
[1:28:34] here and and and bring
[1:28:36] something new that wasn't brother
[1:28:37] branham's purpose he spent the first
[1:28:39] majority of his ministry we'll look at
[1:28:41] it this afternoon but he spent the
[1:28:43] majority of his ministry in the
[1:28:44] beginning
[1:28:44] just restoring back to the church
[1:28:47] hallelujah
[1:28:48] i want to give him a few years to really
[1:28:50] dig into the things that need to be done
[1:28:51] that's right brother yes and then he
[1:28:53] didn't fully do that himself he said i'm
[1:28:54] hitting the high spot he said you young
[1:28:56] people take this revelation dig into it
[1:28:58] bring it to revelation later what i'm
[1:29:00] trying to say hallelujah
[1:29:02] man when you stand up and say i've got
[1:29:03] 12 or 13 pages of notes left i believe
[1:29:05] with all my heart that's what we're
[1:29:06] getting now
[1:29:08] that's right
[1:29:13] of course but the same revelation hey so
[1:29:15] here the devil did not have
[1:29:17] infinite understanding of you and me
[1:29:19] that's right
[1:29:20] praise god praise god oh i thank the
[1:29:22] lord he studied me since i've been a boy
[1:29:24] he's watched me from birth all the way
[1:29:26] up to this time in my life now and he's
[1:29:28] trying to figure out every way in the
[1:29:29] world how to get me turned out that's
[1:29:30] right brother you don't know how to
[1:29:31] fight you don't know how to wrestle
[1:29:33] because every time he gets me in the
[1:29:34] corner jesus gets me out of
[1:29:37] infinite it god himself could not get me
[1:29:39] out of the troubles i was in
[1:29:41] but the dumb old devil oh yeah you say
[1:29:44] say that quietly no he's a dumb old
[1:29:46] devil you heard me i said louder he's a
[1:29:47] dumb old devil
[1:29:49] yes he is and this satan that we fight
[1:29:52] this
[1:29:52] all this super smart being he's as smart
[1:29:55] as dumb
[1:29:56] amen because here's the thing about it
[1:29:58] how in the world could god almighty
[1:30:01] how in the world could god almighty
[1:30:02] project his losing
[1:30:04] soul vividly and yet he still goes on
[1:30:06] today
[1:30:07] to me it's a dumb old devil amen now
[1:30:09] let's look here for just a few moments
[1:30:11] first peter chapter 1
[1:30:12] verse 12. i'm not going to hold you
[1:30:14] alone this morning because we've got
[1:30:15] this afternoon coming
[1:30:16] amen and i i'm going to try to take this
[1:30:18] real slow now and just catch the whole
[1:30:21] meaning of this today in the message
[1:30:22] now watch in first peter chapter 1 verse
[1:30:24] 12 peter then speaking about the
[1:30:26] ministry
[1:30:27] yes well she said unto whom it was
[1:30:29] revealed that not
[1:30:30] unto themselves in other words
[1:30:32] revelation didn't come because i read
[1:30:33] the bible
[1:30:34] yes yes hold on saying i went out there
[1:30:35] to study the scripture matter of fact
[1:30:37] paul spent all that time with gamalia
[1:30:39] and still had it wrong yeah that's right
[1:30:40] right in his own words he said i have
[1:30:43] paul he's nice
[1:30:44] assault sat at the feet of gamalia he
[1:30:47] learned
[1:30:48] all there was to know in that word he
[1:30:49] knew the upside down side left side
[1:30:51] right side
[1:30:51] but yet when it come to the revelation
[1:30:53] of the hour he went out to arabia for
[1:30:55] three years just to get all straightened
[1:30:57] out when he decided camellia and learned
[1:30:58] goodbye one hand cannot give another man
[1:31:01] of revelation
[1:31:02] praise god praise god one woman can't
[1:31:04] give another one vice versa
[1:31:05] okay revelation comes from almighty god
[1:31:08] so now watch they ministered
[1:31:09] unto us the things which are now
[1:31:11] reported unto you by them
[1:31:13] they have preached the gospel unto you
[1:31:16] with the holy ghost sent down from
[1:31:17] heaven
[1:31:19] all right i want you to notice that this
[1:31:20] is real preaching
[1:31:22] preaching is not reading right
[1:31:25] preaching is not speaking preaching is a
[1:31:28] ministry
[1:31:29] to the body of jesus christ amen in
[1:31:31] other words if i'm preaching to you
[1:31:33] i am a ministry unto you yeah not just
[1:31:37] reading quotes
[1:31:38] that's right brother right a lot of
[1:31:40] people have got this wrong
[1:31:41] they think that ministry has standards
[1:31:47] i could take my scriptures out here and
[1:31:49] ask this brother to come and just read
[1:31:50] them for us that's not preaching
[1:31:52] right brother right he might have a nice
[1:31:53] speaking voice i might enjoy hearing his
[1:31:55] way of approach but
[1:31:56] that's not preaching right what you have
[1:31:58] is you have a lot of these individuals
[1:31:59] that are stepping into the pulpit now
[1:32:01] with a with an excited enthusiasm
[1:32:05] about what they know and what they
[1:32:06] believe but there is no ministry of the
[1:32:08] holy ghost behind
[1:32:10] amen amen that's what we're seeing yes
[1:32:12] amen good one miners is not gospel
[1:32:14] preaching that's right brother
[1:32:16] yeah i mean i've done all that i guess
[1:32:18] everything get saved get the holy ghost
[1:32:20] we're the bride we're going in the
[1:32:21] rapture
[1:32:22] glory to god same people that did all
[1:32:24] that glory to god stuff there's
[1:32:26] about half of them are backslid today
[1:32:28] most people know the bible
[1:32:30] right right they don't even understand
[1:32:31] the message of the hour yes sir
[1:32:33] unless they couldn't take their bible
[1:32:34] leave nobody how to get saved because
[1:32:35] they don't know how to get saved
[1:32:36] themselves
[1:32:37] that's right all that stuff is just
[1:32:38] intellect that just proves you can read
[1:32:40] yes sir that's all it is amen but a
[1:32:42] revelation from the holy spirit
[1:32:44] sent down from heaven watch which things
[1:32:47] the angels desire to look into
[1:32:49] yes amen and the word look that peter
[1:32:51] uses here
[1:32:52] is actually to stoop or to bow or to
[1:32:55] bend down
[1:32:56] in order to look at a thing so these
[1:32:59] angels of god that have watched over you
[1:33:02] your entire life
[1:33:03] yes hasten your birth yes with you
[1:33:05] remember brother and talked about that
[1:33:07] little sweet spirit that come near your
[1:33:09] mom
[1:33:11] i realize that was you but it was also
[1:33:12] these angels of the lord
[1:33:14] good heavenly presence and remember
[1:33:16] everybody has this
[1:33:17] yes sure when they come to this world
[1:33:20] everyone has an angel
[1:33:22] that watches over them until they come
[1:33:24] to the age of accountability
[1:33:26] once they come to the age of
[1:33:27] accountability and they step before god
[1:33:29] and god
[1:33:30] sets them like zacchaeus as the brothers
[1:33:32] said their brother cams the other day
[1:33:33] you know
[1:33:34] you talk about zach is sitting in those
[1:33:35] trees he said the place where two pla
[1:33:37] that
[1:33:38] point where two places meet you know he
[1:33:40] had to make a decision comes out of god
[1:33:42] glory but god commissioned these angels
[1:33:45] to serve
[1:33:46] right now i want you to think about
[1:33:47] something for a minute how in the world
[1:33:49] then
[1:33:52] if god is omniscient meaning that god
[1:33:54] cannot be everywhere but god knows
[1:33:56] everything
[1:33:57] how does the lord help us if you can't
[1:34:00] be everywhere at the same time
[1:34:01] i always used to wonder about this
[1:34:02] another who preaches things he's on
[1:34:05] omnipotence he called her a nepotin is
[1:34:07] the word and i've been being
[1:34:09] you know omnipotent or as he would say
[1:34:11] omnipotent
[1:34:13] you know and and he knows the end from
[1:34:15] the beginning how does god help us then
[1:34:17] well here's the way the angels of the
[1:34:19] lord yes
[1:34:20] he sends his help to the angels of god
[1:34:23] amen now
[1:34:24] i want to show that to you these angels
[1:34:26] of the lord in matthew chapter 4 verse
[1:34:28] 11. i've read this to you before but i
[1:34:29] want to bring this back in light of what
[1:34:30] we're talking about
[1:34:31] notice when jesus is in fights that's
[1:34:34] plural fights i said
[1:34:36] he's on the mountain next time he's down
[1:34:38] here and he's over there he's on the
[1:34:38] pinnacle the temple is everywhere
[1:34:40] now the angels of the lord if you'll
[1:34:42] notice them they come
[1:34:44] after the devil leaves him notices the
[1:34:46] devil leaves him
[1:34:47] and that's a pretty good thing and the
[1:34:49] devil leaves yes yes and behold the
[1:34:51] angels
[1:34:52] came and ministered unto him this word
[1:34:54] minister
[1:34:55] means to wait at a table and offer food
[1:34:58] and drink
[1:34:59] to guests so the angels of the lord are
[1:35:03] like your waiter
[1:35:04] yeah anybody ever been to a restaurant
[1:35:07] and somebody walks up there
[1:35:08] hello my name is juan or my name is
[1:35:10] julio or my name is
[1:35:11] jessie or whoever you are you know i
[1:35:13] just want to say uh
[1:35:14] welcome to our place and you know and so
[1:35:16] forth and can i take your order
[1:35:18] well the angels of the lord the same
[1:35:20] word that jesus
[1:35:21] that matthew uses here about the angels
[1:35:23] ministry is the same word we would use
[1:35:25] for a waiter
[1:35:26] now notice if that be the case then
[1:35:29] the angels of the lord are acquainted
[1:35:32] with our lives but they don't fully
[1:35:35] understand redemption
[1:35:37] so peter said they look
[1:35:41] what's going on with those people it's
[1:35:43] something that they see you on a bar
[1:35:45] stool or in a church house or everywhere
[1:35:47] you was
[1:35:48] maybe on a football field or you know
[1:35:49] whatever you used to on a track or some
[1:35:51] kind of thing
[1:35:52] and they've watched you your whole life
[1:35:53] and they see your ambitions and what you
[1:35:55] got your focus on
[1:35:56] and then you get saved amen and then you
[1:35:59] get born again
[1:36:00] amen the little revival that we had here
[1:36:02] a number of years ago
[1:36:04] and and and you folks were coming to the
[1:36:06] message of the hour you know and
[1:36:08] and receiving the lord as your savior
[1:36:10] and receiving the holy ghost and gifts
[1:36:11] and things falling amongst the body
[1:36:13] them angels just went
[1:36:17] wow no wonder god give him that good
[1:36:21] throwing arm
[1:36:21] he's going to have to throw that holy
[1:36:23] ghost seed out there all that
[1:36:26] but they watched you right brother i
[1:36:29] understand what you're all about
[1:36:30] but they don't understand the redemptive
[1:36:32] part of you yes
[1:36:34] because they're made to serve yes sir
[1:36:37] they don't understand
[1:36:38] what redemption is wonderful yeah i had
[1:36:40] a couple tell me some time ago
[1:36:42] about this they said brother man that
[1:36:43] makes me nervous i don't like to be
[1:36:45] watched
[1:36:46] i said what if i'm in the bathroom or in
[1:36:48] the shower or something like that i said
[1:36:49] that
[1:36:49] you the lady and her husband asked me
[1:36:51] some of the angels watching this while
[1:36:52] we're
[1:36:53] you know uh washing our hair and things
[1:36:55] like that i said listen sister
[1:36:56] i said she was the nervous one about it
[1:36:58] i someone asked you a question she said
[1:37:00] yes
[1:37:00] i said do you ever go into a restaurant
[1:37:02] and the waiter takes your order and then
[1:37:04] you start entering into a serious
[1:37:05] conversation i said does the waiter
[1:37:07] stand over the top of you and listen
[1:37:08] take notes
[1:37:10] she said no it doesn't i said what does
[1:37:12] he do he goes back in the corner and
[1:37:13] minds his own business until he's needed
[1:37:16] because he's a servant i said amen many
[1:37:18] of these angels of god
[1:37:20] are not created in a way to understand
[1:37:21] romantic things or
[1:37:23] or you know the physiology of a body
[1:37:26] they could not relate with what it means
[1:37:27] that's right for the urgency of need to
[1:37:29] go to bathroom
[1:37:30] yes sir but it's made in such a way to
[1:37:31] even understand that that's right so
[1:37:33] even if they were looking right at you
[1:37:34] they ain't got no clue what's going on
[1:37:36] that's right but they don't because they
[1:37:38] have that gentlemanlike nature given by
[1:37:40] the holy spirit
[1:37:41] and they don't move until they're called
[1:37:43] forth
[1:37:44] amen i remember what the bible said you
[1:37:47] have none
[1:37:49] yeah good brother because you ask not
[1:37:51] good so if you're a little low on
[1:37:53] spiritual holy ghost juice
[1:37:56] or if you're sitting at the table of god
[1:37:58] and you ain't got no fork and you ain't
[1:37:59] got no straw
[1:38:00] all you gotta do is call for these
[1:38:02] servers i need more i need a refill of
[1:38:05] the whole
[1:38:05] amen i need a refill of joy i need a
[1:38:07] refill yes
[1:38:08] hallelujah we only do this because it's
[1:38:11] the service of god
[1:38:12] not because it's a worship of angels
[1:38:14] hallelujah we do not worship angels
[1:38:17] yes sir would you like to see that
[1:38:18] that's in colossians chapter 2 verse 18.
[1:38:21] paul said let no man beguile you of your
[1:38:23] reward and a voluntary humility
[1:38:26] and worshipping of angels we do not
[1:38:28] worship angels
[1:38:30] but we do give credit where credit is
[1:38:32] due
[1:38:33] yes sir yes sir these angels of the lord
[1:38:35] were created to meet as you say
[1:38:37] well there must there's a lot of people
[1:38:38] seven billion people in this world or
[1:38:40] eight billion whatever it is
[1:38:41] and all these people in the world how
[1:38:43] all of these angels
[1:38:44] we've run out of angels oh i'm so glad
[1:38:46] you said that to me
[1:38:48] amen remember that when these demons
[1:38:50] fell from heaven
[1:38:51] that there were two hundred thousand
[1:38:53] thousand demons remember that
[1:38:55] two hundred thousand thousand demons but
[1:38:57] then when paul speaks about
[1:38:59] the angels of the lord in hebrews 12 he
[1:39:01] said we are in
[1:39:03] incompass i can't ever get that word
[1:39:05] right but we are we in other words they
[1:39:07] surround us
[1:39:08] they they they watch over us a great
[1:39:10] cloud
[1:39:11] and he said there was an innumerable
[1:39:13] host of those amen
[1:39:14] amen amen and who set the rule to say
[1:39:17] god can't create glory
[1:39:20] and we don't know right on every
[1:39:22] population that comes along the lord may
[1:39:24] speak a whole another population of them
[1:39:25] at all we don't know exactly
[1:39:27] but we know this that there's an angel
[1:39:29] of the lord said jesus that beholds my
[1:39:31] father's faith on my behalf
[1:39:33] always on my behalf watching over my
[1:39:35] life good hallelujah
[1:39:37] amen praise the lord jesus now
[1:39:40] notice as we go into this just a little
[1:39:42] bit about the servitude
[1:39:44] of these angels of the lord notice that
[1:39:46] it is because these angels
[1:39:48] are called of god in the service to the
[1:39:51] bride let me go a little bit further
[1:39:52] let's try to yeah this up and pick it up
[1:39:54] the afternoon
[1:39:55] but notice in the service of god that
[1:39:57] these angels of the lord then
[1:39:59] are commissioned to minister unto the
[1:40:02] body then paul
[1:40:03] connects that servitude with the
[1:40:06] ministry did you notice that
[1:40:08] he takes these angels of god and said
[1:40:10] did not he make his ministers flames of
[1:40:12] fire
[1:40:12] now this is in the message greatest
[1:40:14] battle ever thought brother adam said
[1:40:16] that the ministry of spirits he said
[1:40:18] these angels he said glory
[1:40:20] hallelujah he said ministering spirits
[1:40:22] go forth the minister of the word of god
[1:40:24] so in other words while i'm standing
[1:40:26] here on this platform or the gesture
[1:40:28] into the man of god
[1:40:29] as he stands here the gift of the lord
[1:40:32] when it cuts into operation
[1:40:34] then the angels of god that are sent to
[1:40:36] minister through that brother
[1:40:38] come to bring the anointing of the holy
[1:40:40] spirit to minister through that man of
[1:40:42] god you ever wonder why a preacher gets
[1:40:44] off his notes
[1:40:45] yes because if you have a need and not
[1:40:48] your need
[1:40:48] in my notes because that angel's called
[1:40:51] to serve
[1:40:52] he will swing that anointing in the way
[1:40:54] of service yeah
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:40:58] on the gift of god i don't care how dry
[1:41:00] the service
[1:41:01] how dead the service how dead you are
[1:41:04] how tired you are
[1:41:06] always pulling on that word
[1:41:10] [Applause]
[1:41:11] amen that angel is called to serve you
[1:41:17] even yeah in your direction that's right
[1:41:19] hey man let somebody just annoy the
[1:41:21] singer come up here and get on a piano
[1:41:22] or pick up a guitar or something like
[1:41:24] our brother
[1:41:25] in the solo service and and and these
[1:41:27] young people as they play
[1:41:29] i mean just just look at how the holy
[1:41:30] spirit will pick up the anointing on it
[1:41:32] that's right right and listen let me
[1:41:35] tell you something
[1:41:36] when you're playing this music over here
[1:41:38] and you don't really realize how you
[1:41:39] made that note you've got an angelic
[1:41:41] anointing
[1:41:41] [Laughter]
[1:41:49] yes sir you're scared of that you scared
[1:41:51] your bottom lips equipment i'm going to
[1:41:52] mess this song on the pieces but let the
[1:41:54] anointing fall
[1:41:56] that's angels of the lord
[1:42:12] hallelujah outside of that you've got a
[1:42:14] good talker
[1:42:16] he's an industrial speaker right brother
[1:42:18] if the angel of the lord does not
[1:42:20] accompany that man to the platform i
[1:42:21] don't care how many quotes he reads how
[1:42:23] many times he says the prophet's name
[1:42:24] he is not called minister he's just an
[1:42:26] exhorter that's right brother because a
[1:42:28] called preacher
[1:42:29] is anointed by the angels of the lord to
[1:42:31] bring the gospel
[1:42:33] it's the holy ghost of course but the
[1:42:35] angels of the lord are commissioned to
[1:42:36] deliver these gifts to the people
[1:42:38] amen amen absolutely amen and and i just
[1:42:41] say it like this
[1:42:42] you know we we uh as i was listening to
[1:42:45] this morning about
[1:42:46] some of the testimonies that brother
[1:42:47] branham and his meetings they said when
[1:42:49] the angel of the lord would show up now
[1:42:50] this is not on tape but this is
[1:42:52] testimony from people in the meetings
[1:42:53] said that the angel of god while brother
[1:42:55] brandon be praying would sometimes leave
[1:42:57] his hand
[1:42:57] lay his hand on some of their shoulders
[1:42:59] and said they would leave a glowing
[1:43:00] imprint that would fall around the rest
[1:43:02] of the meeting the rest of the night
[1:43:04] that was testimony for some of the
[1:43:05] people of brother venom's meetings amen
[1:43:07] amen he talked about one of the ushers
[1:43:09] that was standing there and said brother
[1:43:11] branham walked in
[1:43:12] told him what his name was talk to him
[1:43:13] as though he'd been with him all day
[1:43:15] long
[1:43:15] and said he turned around and got his
[1:43:16] hat started to go to the platform he
[1:43:18] stopped to run but his hand and shoulder
[1:43:19] said
[1:43:20] your wife had that disease today when
[1:43:21] she went to the doctor but she's healed
[1:43:23] of it don't you worry about that
[1:43:24] said he goes home that afternoon and so
[1:43:26] that evening sits down and talks to his
[1:43:28] wife and said honey
[1:43:29] what about that she said i didn't want
[1:43:31] to tell you i didn't want to scare you
[1:43:32] she said but i had a certain thing said
[1:43:34] she died before him and never was
[1:43:36] plagued with that thing god completely
[1:43:38] healed her
[1:43:39] just like that i got news for you
[1:43:40] brother that wasn't a man who practiced
[1:43:42] good psychology
[1:43:43] and had plants around the tent that was
[1:43:45] the holy ghost
[1:43:46] yeah when brother bennett would walk
[1:43:48] into a room a brand new room of 50 and
[1:43:50] 60 people that called every one of my
[1:43:52] name
[1:43:53] come on why is that be spiritual that
[1:43:55] was the holy spirit
[1:43:56] it was the angel of the lord in our city
[1:43:59] and
[1:43:59] ever the evangelist of god that's what
[1:44:01] done these things brought these great
[1:44:02] manifestations of the lord
[1:44:04] hallelujah amen when i say wise up i'm
[1:44:06] not talking necessarily
[1:44:07] to you specifically i mean in general we
[1:44:09] have to be wide awake for the hour
[1:44:11] that's what it is amen just like when
[1:44:13] the cry went forth for the virgins to
[1:44:15] wake up
[1:44:15] i mean it in the way of don't be
[1:44:17] spiritually sleeping on what is going
[1:44:20] on around us we might be alone but we
[1:44:22] are never alone
[1:44:23] amen amen amen there's always something
[1:44:26] around us always something watching over
[1:44:28] us
[1:44:29] thank you jesus hallelujah
[1:44:32] amen mama when you can't get to your
[1:44:34] baby don't forget the angel of the lord
[1:44:36] can get there quicker than you
[1:44:38] amen they don't need a passport they
[1:44:41] don't need to take a gas
[1:44:43] amen all you got to do is call for them
[1:44:44] and they didn't happen we've all heard
[1:44:46] the stories about people out in the
[1:44:47] middle of nowhere
[1:44:48] you know and and there's no there's no
[1:44:50] lights there's no town there's no
[1:44:51] electrical wires there's nothing and
[1:44:53] they're out of gas they're trying to
[1:44:54] pass through it
[1:44:55] all of a sudden some man comes from
[1:44:56] nowhere the tank of gas and then goes
[1:44:58] back into nowhere
[1:44:59] we know what it is it's the angels of
[1:45:01] the lord so if they're called to encamp
[1:45:03] about us don't those same angels of god
[1:45:05] aren't they commissioned to come bring
[1:45:07] us healing and signs
[1:45:08] and oneness god uses them
[1:45:11] angels to deliver it to the servants of
[1:45:13] god amen in the bride of jesus christ
[1:45:16] remember god didn't call an angel to
[1:45:18] preach he called man
[1:45:19] that's right but the angel is
[1:45:20] commissioned to serve that preacher
[1:45:22] amen hallelujah
[1:45:26] amen listen i'm saying around the world
[1:45:29] i've played music around the world i
[1:45:31] i've i've sat in
[1:45:33] in in meetings and talked to people
[1:45:35] about the bible
[1:45:36] all my life i've spent my whole life in
[1:45:37] the christian church yeah like that i
[1:45:39] heard saying this morning i'll probably
[1:45:40] die right in the middle of it that's
[1:45:42] true
[1:45:42] i thought about that about myself about
[1:45:44] you know i was born into the church i'll
[1:45:46] probably die right in it i'm kidding
[1:45:48] and and you know i've spent my life
[1:45:50] doing them things and feel the holy
[1:45:52] spirit when it comes down on the
[1:45:53] platform and
[1:45:54] as we were singing this morning you feel
[1:45:55] the holy ghost you know i like that yeah
[1:45:58] brother jesse
[1:45:58] when i step to this platform and i open
[1:46:00] up my bible
[1:46:02] i've felt it for 30 years yes there's a
[1:46:04] presence of
[1:46:06] a being that steps on this platform
[1:46:08] right behind me i felt it just this
[1:46:09] morning
[1:46:09] when i started to read my scripture to
[1:46:11] you i felt that change come right back
[1:46:12] behind me
[1:46:13] what is that what brother branham said
[1:46:14] the angels of the lord are the ministers
[1:46:16] of spirits the minister of the body of
[1:46:18] jesus christ yes that's the reason why
[1:46:20] we should not take church lightly
[1:46:21] amen amen because the angels of the lord
[1:46:23] are amongst us said the reason he didn't
[1:46:26] like auditoriums he said because it took
[1:46:28] him days to preach all his devils off
[1:46:29] the rapture set up everything
[1:46:31] sports events he said wrestling boxing
[1:46:33] all that stuff going on
[1:46:34] concerts and what more and he said but
[1:46:36] he liked the church he said because
[1:46:37] that's where the angels of the lord
[1:46:40] amen amen that's right why don't we have
[1:46:43] more visitations from it because our
[1:46:45] lives and our atmospheres are not a
[1:46:47] place
[1:46:48] for heavenly beings to feel comfortable
[1:46:49] in yes yes
[1:46:51] think about that just a moment how can
[1:46:52] an angel of the lord visit us and we not
[1:46:54] be able to see it
[1:46:56] i know wouldn't it be great if we could
[1:46:57] say well i had a visitation from the age
[1:46:59] of the lord
[1:47:00] sure but just because you don't see it
[1:47:02] don't mean it wasn't there that's right
[1:47:04] have you ever been praying and you know
[1:47:07] you get done praying and you you feel
[1:47:09] like there's a supernatural thing which
[1:47:10] is not certain
[1:47:11] maybe not the holy spirit exactly but
[1:47:14] you knew he was in a heavenly realm
[1:47:15] well that's because jesus said that
[1:47:17] these angels of god would be witnesses
[1:47:19] in judgment they're good note-takers
[1:47:21] yes you think you take good notes in
[1:47:23] church they do better than you
[1:47:25] because they take all the thoughts and
[1:47:26] intents and they catch all that stuff
[1:47:28] they see actions if you put your eye in
[1:47:30] a certain way nobody else might see it
[1:47:31] but they
[1:47:32] that's why judgment may not be anybody
[1:47:34] could be able to escape not one thing
[1:47:36] that's right you have to do is call for
[1:47:37] the angel's homework record and
[1:47:39] what you've done and so forth like that
[1:47:40] and cause the whole night from teachers
[1:47:42] you know
[1:47:42] jesse will say all right bring your
[1:47:44] homework children you know
[1:47:45] hey listen i ain't got it the dog ate it
[1:47:47] not on that day
[1:47:49] amen the angels of the lord have got our
[1:47:51] record up well that ain't me i didn't do
[1:47:53] this all right call the tape up let's
[1:47:54] prove this
[1:47:56] you won't be able to escape it because
[1:47:57] the angels of the lord are taking notes
[1:47:59] and keeping records did you ever stop to
[1:48:01] think that when you're in your prayer
[1:48:03] closet
[1:48:03] and you don't feel the holy ghost you
[1:48:05] get discouraged and you think god's not
[1:48:07] even listening but you didn't stop to
[1:48:08] consider
[1:48:09] maybe the angel of the lord was taking
[1:48:11] your order
[1:48:13] amen it may not even be that you feel
[1:48:15] the holy ghost at that time just have
[1:48:16] faith in the process
[1:48:18] yes have confidence in the program that
[1:48:20] god established and when you're talking
[1:48:22] to the lord
[1:48:22] and you don't know whether god heard you
[1:48:24] or not just remember the angel of the
[1:48:25] lord took your order
[1:48:27] he's taken it up to the kitchen to make
[1:48:29] sure the chef prepares it right
[1:48:31] and i don't know about you but i would
[1:48:33] much rather have a well done meal than
[1:48:35] just some old mcdonald's process thing
[1:48:37] any day of the week
[1:48:38] they could pop them out on a
[1:48:40] manufacturing thing you know and
[1:48:42] get you a stack of cheeseburgers in a
[1:48:44] few moments time but let me tell you
[1:48:46] when a real chef gets that meat and he
[1:48:48] packs it together and he
[1:48:50] seasons it just right maybe he sticks it
[1:48:51] in a marinade goes overnight like that
[1:48:54] i meant to wait a little longer but all
[1:48:56] the results are so much that's right all
[1:48:58] right
[1:48:59] there's a way with the angels of the
[1:49:00] lord if we can only understand that
[1:49:02] they're commissioned by god to make sure
[1:49:05] you are all your needs are met yes
[1:49:08] yes they're taking your order well you
[1:49:10] say i don't feel god
[1:49:12] but hold still you don't have to feel
[1:49:13] god yes remember jesus never said did
[1:49:16] you feel it
[1:49:17] he asked you if you were all right amen
[1:49:18] amen amen
[1:49:20] that's right if you don't feel it all
[1:49:22] the time maybe it's because the holy
[1:49:24] spirit may not be resident right there
[1:49:26] in your in your
[1:49:27] prayer closet or in your car yes
[1:49:29] remember if he's
[1:49:30] if he's omniscient and he can't be
[1:49:32] everywhere at the same time
[1:49:34] listen there were moments even though
[1:49:35] the the pillar of fire dwells within us
[1:49:38] by the seal of god remember
[1:49:39] there were moments that the prophet of
[1:49:41] god would say i'm waiting on him to show
[1:49:42] up
[1:49:44] that showed us that there were times
[1:49:45] that god almighty and his ever
[1:49:47] whatever manifestation you'd like to
[1:49:49] identify and the pillar of fire
[1:49:50] in the logos call it what you want but
[1:49:52] that shows us there were times
[1:49:54] that the holy ghost was coming from one
[1:49:56] place to another
[1:49:58] yes he may not be right in your
[1:50:00] residence right at that moment he might
[1:50:01] not be on your neighbor in your
[1:50:03] neighborhood or on your block at that
[1:50:04] moment
[1:50:05] but don't forget if you call for god's
[1:50:07] help the servers are there taking the
[1:50:08] order amen
[1:50:10] amen that's why we should ask in faith
[1:50:12] not a miss
[1:50:13] yes believing god speaking the word
[1:50:17] you promised it lord this is what you
[1:50:18] said yeah the man likened it to a
[1:50:20] cashier check
[1:50:22] you know that yes he said sometimes then
[1:50:24] angel cashiers might get busy
[1:50:28] he said but the check would be cash sure
[1:50:30] enough you said the bottom of it jesus
[1:50:32] name is wrote at the bottom of every
[1:50:33] check

[1:50:35] know what you want the old song
[1:50:37] call him up call him up tell him what
[1:50:38] you want
[1:50:40] amen we may not always feel the holy
[1:50:42] spirit in those moments but that doesn't
[1:50:43] mean
[1:50:44] that god's provision isn't being made
[1:50:46] for you and i yes hallelujah notice in
[1:50:48] genesis 28 12
[1:50:50] he dreams a dream talk about jacob he
[1:50:52] sees a ladder set up on the earth and
[1:50:54] the top of it reached up into heaven
[1:50:55] and the angels of god were ascending and
[1:50:57] descending on i love to say this
[1:51:00] in our minds we think heaven is just a
[1:51:02] quiet
[1:51:03] peaceful like a library you know we got
[1:51:06] right in our mind
[1:51:07] you know that everything's just you know
[1:51:09] people are just strolling leisurely down
[1:51:11] you know down to the rolling fields of
[1:51:14] bluegrass but
[1:51:15] i want to point your attention to
[1:51:17] something we'll pick it up tonight
[1:51:18] that heaven is a beehive of activity yes
[1:51:22] heaven is a metropolis of activity ever
[1:51:24] been to a busy city
[1:51:26] i don't i don't mean africa amen
[1:51:30] that's a little town compared to new
[1:51:31] york in places i'm talking about a
[1:51:33] metropolis i mean it's a busy
[1:51:35] city of uh of movement and motions and
[1:51:38] activity
[1:51:39] i'll just call your attention that
[1:51:40] whenever brother branham crossed from
[1:51:42] this realm
[1:51:43] into the other the very moment he
[1:51:45] crossed between that
[1:51:46] that time veil once you look what was
[1:51:48] taking place he looks back on the body
[1:51:50] he sees his bed
[1:51:51] he turns one direction and millions are
[1:51:53] running and screaming our precious
[1:51:54] brother
[1:51:55] it is a beehive of activity amen i would
[1:51:58] just advise you that if you ever get
[1:52:00] in a place to where you think maybe that
[1:52:02] things are moving too slowly
[1:52:04] i'll just tell you to close your eyes
[1:52:06] and use your faith in your long-range
[1:52:08] vision and look in that realm
[1:52:10] and picture in your mind the millions
[1:52:12] upon millions of angels of the lord
[1:52:14] that are buzzing back and forth in and
[1:52:15] out of that busy kitchen
[1:52:17] serving the children of god and how much
[1:52:19] activity is taking place
[1:52:20] you might be 17 on the list but wait
[1:52:22] your turn yes
[1:52:24] yes wait your turn because all that
[1:52:26] activity is being
[1:52:27] stirred up for the benefit of the body
[1:52:28] of jesus christ amen
[1:52:30] amen heaven is not a place of folding
[1:52:32] our hands a little slumber a little
[1:52:33] sleep
[1:52:35] heaven is a metropolis of activity
[1:52:37] there's always something
[1:52:38] moving over there if you don't think so
[1:52:40] just look at when john got a view of it
[1:52:42] yes yes he looks around at the throne of
[1:52:45] god
[1:52:45] and the angels are singing i mean at the
[1:52:48] very time that the very seals are
[1:52:50] getting ready to come open
[1:52:52] and god opens up his eyes to look in
[1:52:54] that dimension and see that hour
[1:52:55] that the lamb is getting ready to take
[1:52:57] the book look there's a call going all
[1:52:59] around heaven like you be in a shopping
[1:53:00] center
