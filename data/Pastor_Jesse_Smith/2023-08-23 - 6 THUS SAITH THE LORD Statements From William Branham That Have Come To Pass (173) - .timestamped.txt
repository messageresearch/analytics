[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] well the thing for you to do is to
[0:05] remember that I speak to you in the name
[0:08] of the Lord
[0:10] be prepared or you don't know what time
[0:12] something can happen
[0:15] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:20] this video is to show six thus saith the
[0:23] Lord statements by God's Prophet for
[0:25] brother William Branham that have come
[0:27] to pass or are in the process of coming
[0:30] to pass
[0:31] there's a few reasons I wanted to make
[0:33] this video first I want to update my
[0:36] sixth video called three Prophecies of
[0:38] brother Branham in order to give more
[0:41] proof about William Branham being a
[0:43] genuine prophet of God
[0:45] another reason to make this video was
[0:46] because I had a question about brother
[0:48] Brown's Ministry five months ago and I
[0:51] was asked could you advise what are the
[0:54] thus say the Lord statements that did
[0:56] come to pass
[0:57] give the date the prophecy was made what
[1:00] tape and how it came to manifestation
[1:03] so I thought I would make a video about
[1:05] my answer to this viewer's question
[1:08] and friends before we get started please
[1:10] share any thus saith the Lord statements
[1:13] that can be verified through personal
[1:14] testimony from the tapes of brother
[1:17] Brenham that have come to pass I would
[1:19] love to update this video make another
[1:21] video about that as encouragement for
[1:23] people to truly believe brother Branham
[1:25] was a genuine prophet of God pointing us
[1:27] back to the Holy Bible to the Eternal
[1:30] truths of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33] I want to say also that in Chapter 13 of
[1:36] my 2021 book The 12 New Testament
[1:38] Mysteries revealed I covered 30 thus
[1:42] saith the Lord's statements from Brother
[1:43] Branham on pages 751 to 762. I started
[1:49] with six thus say the Lord's statements
[1:51] brother Branham gave about Mysteries and
[1:54] that was the foundation of my book there
[1:56] are 12 New Testament Mysteries the Bible
[1:58] defines as Mysteries and brother Branham
[2:00] gave us six of them with us say the Lord
[2:03] and then I showed eight more thus saith
[2:05] the Lord's brother Brandon gave us on
[2:07] Doctrine bringing the total to 14. then
[2:10] he gave to thus saith the Lord's
[2:12] statements that came to pass to Florence
[2:14] shakarian and Florence Humes that brings
[2:17] a total to 16 and then I listed three
[2:20] thus say the Lords that are in the
[2:21] process of coming to pass or have come
[2:23] to pass that was also what my sixth
[2:27] video was about three Prophecies of
[2:28] William Branham so that brings a total
[2:30] to 19 thus saith the Lords and then I
[2:32] showed eleven thus say the Lord future
[2:34] Prophecies of brother Branham that
[2:36] haven't happened yet but we believe will
[2:39] happen because these other prophecies
[2:41] have come to pass that brings it to a
[2:43] total of 30 thus saith the Lords
[2:45] friends this is just one reason we know
[2:47] brother Brandon was a genuine prophet of
[2:49] God because we do not know anyone else
[2:51] who has spoken so accurately with us
[2:53] saith the Lord in fact I've never heard
[2:55] of any other man any other preacher in
[2:58] any of the New Testament history
[2:59] prophesying with thus saith the Lord and
[3:02] having it come to pass other than Saint
[3:04] Paul agabus from the book of Acts and
[3:07] other New Testament authors by the grace
[3:09] of God
[3:10] and one more thing before we get started
[3:12] there are some questionable thus saith
[3:14] the Lord's people wonder about from
[3:15] Brother Branham and I addressed numerous
[3:17] of these on my 107th video called the
[3:21] brown bear Vision was a conditional
[3:22] promise plus brief responses to other
[3:25] accusations I cover these at about the
[3:28] 43 minute and 40 second Mark I showed
[3:32] over 10 Bible examples of how thus say
[3:34] the Lord's statements are sometimes
[3:36] conditional which is why the brown bear
[3:39] Vision God gave to brother Branham
[3:40] wasn't fulfilled because brother Branham
[3:42] didn't meet the conditions and yet he
[3:44] can be a genuine prophet of God because
[3:46] other prophets didn't meet the
[3:48] conditions of conditional Promises of
[3:50] God in that portion of the video I
[3:52] showed how I believe the tent Vision was
[3:55] fulfilled when brother Brandon preached
[3:57] the Seven Seals I showed how I believe
[3:59] the Ohio Municipal Bridge prophecy was
[4:02] fulfilled because it ultimately comes
[4:04] down to brother Brandon's word against
[4:06] brother Brown's accuser's word I covered
[4:09] the vision of the 300 1000 in brother
[4:12] Brandon's meetings and I believe that
[4:13] was fulfilled in Bombay India in 1954.
[4:16] the mayor Bombay told Brother Branham he
[4:18] estimated there were over 500 000 people
[4:20] in those meetings
[4:22] and the last one was the Arizona cloud
[4:24] from February 28 1963 twice brother
[4:27] random said thus saith the Lord or in
[4:29] the name of the Lord about the vision of
[4:32] the seven angels that was in December of
[4:34] 1962 and then it came to pass two months
[4:37] later in February 1963.
[4:40] so now let's get into the sixth thus
[4:42] saith Lord statements that have come to
[4:43] pass I'll go in chronological order the
[4:46] first is from 1958 the queen of the
[4:48] south in a prayer line and discernment
[4:51] line brother Ram told Marilyn Hickey
[4:53] thus saith the Lord go home and receive
[4:56] your child God will give it to you if
[4:57] you believe and if I'm not mistaken
[4:59] Marilyn Hickey is still alive of course
[5:01] she's a woman preacher with short hair
[5:03] and that goes against the Bible
[5:05] but either way God gave her a thus saith
[5:08] the Lord if she believed and it came to
[5:09] pass ten years later you can easily find
[5:11] her testimony online if you'd like to
[5:14] view it she was a stranger to brother
[5:15] Branham and brother Branham discerned
[5:17] her condition and gave her thus saith
[5:19] the Lord and it came to pass
[5:21] let's listen to the prophecy given to
[5:23] Marilyn Hickey
[5:27] I don't know you and you don't know me
[5:32] [Music]
[5:33] watch your ear claw
[5:37] you know something's going on
[5:39] that's the scene between you and I stand
[5:42] that line you're moving from and you're
[5:44] moving way away
[5:46] I can tell you right now you're not from
[5:48] around here because you're from a woody
[5:50] country where it's much heavy Timber and
[5:52] wood
[5:53] and you're suffering with a female
[5:54] trouble and you've got a desire in your
[5:56] heart to have a baby and you can't have
[5:59] the baby and you come from Denver
[6:00] Colorado just stay at the Lord
[6:04] that's right go home and receive your
[6:06] child God will give it to you
[6:12] the second thus saith the Lord was from
[6:14] May 19 1961 sirs we would see Jesus or
[6:18] the brand said thus saith the Lord you
[6:20] will never no more Gentile Church age
[6:24] ever see any sign to succeed this go
[6:26] greater this is the last sign to the
[6:28] church
[6:29] and of course that has come to pass it
[6:32] has been 58 years since brother Brandon
[6:34] passed away and there has been no
[6:36] Christian Gift prophetic gift or
[6:38] discernment gift
[6:40] and come close to brother random's
[6:42] gifted discernment let's listen to the
[6:44] quote
[6:45] is right here among you you'll just
[6:48] remember it thus saith the Lord you will
[6:53] never in any or more Gentile Church age
[6:56] ever see any sign to succeed this
[7:01] go greater this is the last sign to the
[7:04] church
[7:06] the third thus saith the Lord's
[7:08] statement is from February 11 1962 the
[7:11] sermon Oneness brother Brown was
[7:13] speaking about the condition of women in
[7:16] the last days and he said I've got thus
[7:18] saith the Lord God told him that the
[7:20] strain of women would come so immoral
[7:22] imputed in the last days they'd be the
[7:24] most defiled thing on earth
[7:26] shall continue to strip herself so by
[7:29] the ram said thus saith the Lord that
[7:31] women would continue to strip themselves
[7:32] and here we are 61 years later and
[7:35] that's what we witness in warm weather
[7:38] some women hardly wear any clothes they
[7:41] basically wear bikinis with yoga pants
[7:43] and even less clothes than that
[7:45] so clearly this thus saith the Lord has
[7:47] come to pass let's listen to the quote
[7:49] from Oneness
[7:50] you're wondering why a rapid women
[7:57] I've got
[8:02] the ministry he told me that the strain
[8:04] of women would come so immoral and
[8:06] imputed in the last days to be the most
[8:08] defiled thing on the Earth
[8:11] right she started at the beginning and
[8:13] Satan user at the end and look what is
[8:15] happening look down through the ears
[8:16] said she'll continue to strip herself
[8:19] and said there'll just be a little tiny
[8:21] group of the very elected it's
[8:23] predestinated we'll Escape that
[8:27] the fourth thus saith the Lord is the
[8:29] vision of the church in the United
[8:30] States dancing to rock and roll this is
[8:33] from January 24th 1965 brother Graham
[8:36] said now it's thus saith the Lord
[8:38] he saw the American Church come up it
[8:40] was the office I ever seen
[8:42] painted faces short bob hair twisting as
[8:46] they walk to rock and roll and friends
[8:48] I've shared this in numerous places but
[8:49] my mother was raised in the Assembly of
[8:51] God Church she was born in 1950 and she
[8:54] saw the progress all the way up to about
[8:56] the year 2000 2005 when she would go to
[8:59] the Assembly of God youth conventions
[9:01] and that's when they started introducing
[9:03] rock and roll rap hip-hop so my mother
[9:06] in denominations has literally seen this
[9:08] come to pass and now almost every mega
[9:10] church has rock and roll hip-hop or some
[9:13] type of worldly music just as division
[9:15] was told to brother Branham and not only
[9:17] do these churches celebrate rock and
[9:19] roll but most of their women Bob their
[9:21] hair wear makeup wear sexy clothes so
[9:24] let's listen to The Prophecy from
[9:25] Brother Branham
[9:27] vision
[9:28] notice just
[9:32] that's what led me to say this
[9:35] as thus saith the Lord
[9:38] the man would say that
[9:41] without putting it in his own thinking
[9:43] he'd be a hypocrite and should go to
[9:45] hellhart
[9:48] some of the dirtiest looking things I
[9:50] ever seen in my life and when the
[9:53] American Church come up
[9:55] it was the office I ever seen the
[9:58] heavenly father is my judge they had on
[10:01] these
[10:03] tattle-tailed gray skirts like one of
[10:06] these bar room girls would go back on it
[10:08] up here hold it up like a great looking
[10:10] piece of paper and like hula dancing
[10:13] paint short bobbed hair smoking
[10:16] cigarettes and twisting as they walked
[10:19] to rock and roll and I said is that the
[10:22] Church of the United States and the
[10:25] voice that yes it is
[10:29] a fifth prophecy is the death of
[10:31] Florence shakarian from 1965 brother Ram
[10:33] told us that on February 17th
[10:36] 1965 he said he had to go to Florence
[10:39] shakarian's family with thus saith the
[10:41] Lord that their daughter is going to die
[10:43] now I don't know the exact date of her
[10:45] death but by September 11 1965 she'd
[10:48] already passed away her brother Brandon
[10:51] Ford told the shakiran family a few
[10:52] years before she passed it she was going
[10:54] to pass
[10:55] now brother Adam's accusers will say
[10:56] it's not hard to prophesy of a person's
[10:59] death when they have stage four cancer
[11:01] and most of us would probably agree to
[11:03] that but the reason it was Supernatural
[11:05] is because all the preachers surrounding
[11:08] Florence you Karen were saying she was
[11:09] going to be healed with us saith the
[11:11] Lord so brother Adam was one of the few
[11:13] voices and the only voice would thus
[11:15] saith the Lord that was going against
[11:16] all these other false prophets who were
[11:18] saying thus saith the Lord she was going
[11:20] to be healed so we have all these
[11:22] prophets saying thus saith the Lord
[11:23] she's going to be healed and we have one
[11:25] Prophet saying thus say the Lord the
[11:26] Lord's going to take her home and who is
[11:28] right brother Brandon was right and
[11:30] friends it's scriptural for prophets to
[11:32] foretell deaths like in Second Kings 1
[11:34] verses 1 to 18 Elijah foretold King has
[11:38] the eye's death and of course Elijah had
[11:40] the spirit of Elijah just like brother
[11:42] Branham had the spirit of Elijah let's
[11:44] listen to the quotes
[11:46] that I had to come to that family with
[11:49] thus saith the Lord their daughter is
[11:51] going to die too
[11:53] Florence
[11:56] I saw her in a vision it's our goal
[12:00] and I know she's going
[12:02] and I said pray just pray you know
[12:04] there's a prophet one time that's told
[12:06] to go tell a king to put his house in
[12:08] order and he prayed and he spared his
[12:10] life 15 years longer I said pray but
[12:16] so it'll put it just informants you'll
[12:18] know what we're speaking of and it's
[12:20] thus saith the law
[12:23] true as it was when the scene our sister
[12:26] Florence before she went away several
[12:29] years it's the truth
[12:33] and the sixth and final thus saith the
[12:34] Lord that's come to pass as brother
[12:36] Branham said in July 25th 1965 no
[12:39] denomination will ever break up and come
[12:41] back to the word this is an astounding
[12:43] statement here we are 58 years later and
[12:46] no denomination has ever broke up its
[12:49] denomination and come back to Saint
[12:51] Paul's gospel the original word the
[12:54] Bible Revelation that we call the
[12:55] message
[12:56] and so we Rejoice that we have thus
[12:58] saith the Lord we have a genuine Prophet
[13:00] who gave us thou saith the Lord and as
[13:02] message Believers we're so thankful we
[13:04] have the revelation of God's word
[13:06] brother Adam said God can always give us
[13:08] more information about the same
[13:09] Revelation but God is not going to give
[13:11] us a different Revelation for example
[13:13] there will never be a revelation
[13:15] different on the water baptism it's
[13:17] always going to be in the name of the
[13:18] Lord Jesus Christ but God could give us
[13:20] more scriptures backing that up
[13:22] regarding the godhead God's only one
[13:24] person God will never change that
[13:26] Revelation to God's two persons three or
[13:29] any more but God will give us more
[13:31] scripture more information about the
[13:33] same Revelation so let's listen to the
[13:35] quote from the anointed ones of the end
[13:37] time
[13:38] is predicted that they're going to do it
[13:40] and they're going to do it
[13:43] or just stay at the water they're going
[13:45] to do it
[13:46] you think them nominations will ever
[13:48] break up their denomination come back to
[13:50] the word it's thus saith the Lord they
[13:52] won't
[13:53] will they go into the Antichrist exactly
[13:56] it's the faith the Lord they will
[13:59] so what are you saying about I have to
[14:01] be a witness and so are you
[14:04] all believers
[14:07] now that I've gone through those six
[14:08] thus Faith the Lord's statements I just
[14:10] want to read a little bit of the comment
[14:12] that kind of inspired this video
[14:14] after I reply to this person's comment
[14:17] with these six prophecies their reply
[14:19] was quote none of it is super convincing
[14:22] end quote so my reply was simply Mercy
[14:25] six thus say the Lord statements are not
[14:28] convincing to you I just said I feel
[14:30] sorry for you how often do you hear
[14:32] people speak the future with us say the
[14:34] Lord and it comes to pass
[14:36] humbly say it may be your cognitive
[14:38] dissonance that is keeping you from
[14:40] recognizing the supernatural prophetic
[14:42] Ministry in brother Brandon's life and
[14:45] this person also commented that they
[14:46] didn't like the If part of some of my
[14:48] brother Adam's prophecies
[14:50] I told the person that's God's way
[14:52] sometimes sometimes God makes the
[14:54] prophecies conditional and I said it's
[14:56] scriptural Jesus Christ himself said in
[14:58] Mark 9 23 if thou can't believe all
[15:02] things are possible to him that
[15:03] believeth and these were people
[15:05] believing for healing from demonic
[15:07] possession and we know there's other
[15:09] scriptures in the gospels that say Jesus
[15:11] could not do many mighty works because
[15:12] of people's unbelief so it just shows we
[15:15] need the humility of the Holy Spirit we
[15:16] have to recognize God works differently
[15:18] with each person depending on their
[15:20] spiritual condition some people will get
[15:22] thus say the Lords and it's
[15:23] unconditional but other thus saith the
[15:25] Lords are conditional so we need to be
[15:27] humble as Christians we need to be
[15:29] teachable by the grace of God and so I
[15:31] ended by saying hope this helps you God
[15:33] bless you
[15:35] in closing
[15:36] friends I hope this video was a blessing
[15:38] I love making videos like this I love
[15:40] looking at the Supernatural Ministry God
[15:41] gave to William Branham I'm so thankful
[15:44] I can preach his bible-based message I
[15:46] preached it for the last nearly 19 years
[15:48] along with 17 years of pastoring
[15:50] numerous times I preached a sermon
[15:52] called we have thus saith the Lord and
[15:54] what a comfort that is to us thus saith
[15:56] the Lord takes away all the doubts thus
[15:59] saith the Lord is what the church is
[16:00] built upon the revelation of Jesus
[16:02] Christ because any thus saith the Lord
[16:04] is thus saith Jesus Christ so again
[16:06] friends if you have any of us say the
[16:08] Lord's statements on tape that can be
[16:10] verified as coming to pass whether it's
[16:12] healing or prophecy please let me know
[16:14] I'd love to do an updated version of
[16:15] this video and as always thank you for
[16:17] your support your prayers please pray
[16:19] and see if you feel led to share this
[16:21] video with people that need to be
[16:22] strengthened regarding the message of
[16:23] the hour recently in the last few weeks
[16:25] I've gotten numerous emails about how
[16:28] our podcasts and our videos are helping
[16:30] people to stay with the message believe
[16:33] the message understand the message and
[16:35] that's what we're here for part of my
[16:36] test testimonies I feel that I was born
[16:38] to defend this bible-based message that
[16:40] God gave to William Branham each of us
[16:42] have a purpose in this life and we want
[16:44] to find God's purpose for our life and
[16:46] do it as brother Brandon said if you
[16:49] have any questions concerns or
[16:50] testimonies about this video please
[16:52] contact me
[16:54] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[16:56] the desire of your heart
[16:59] foreign
