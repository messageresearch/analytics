[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:11] of the lord jesus christ
[0:13] the purpose of this video
[0:15] is to show that brother branham's
[0:16] statements about
[0:18] 1977
[0:19] were predictions only
[0:21] and 1977 was not a prophecy
[0:25] as we listen to brother branham very
[0:26] carefully we can find at least three
[0:28] reasons why he thought the year 1977 was
[0:32] significant
[0:33] and those three statements along with
[0:35] the 21 mentions of this subject point to
[0:38] the fact that this was just a prediction
[0:41] and not a prophecy
[0:43] and of course i could be wrong this is
[0:45] my opinion based upon the quotes that i
[0:46] can hear
[0:47] and i'm always open to correction
[0:50] so i believe believers would greatly
[0:51] benefit from hearing all the quotes on
[0:53] this subject
[0:54] as i've talked with different ministers
[0:56] recently and i think this video would be
[0:58] a help to many by god's grace
[1:00] and if there are any quotes about 1977
[1:03] that you don't hear on this video please
[1:04] share them with me and no doubt they'll
[1:06] help me or enlighten me by the grace of
[1:08] god
[1:10] here's the outline for the video first
[1:12] we'll look at the timeline
[1:14] and the content of the 21 mentions
[1:16] brother branham gave
[1:17] about 1977
[1:19] and this includes 19 times
[1:22] he said this was a prediction
[1:25] second we'll look at the three reasons
[1:26] why brother branham thought 1977 was
[1:29] divinely inspired as he said in the
[1:32] church age book and of course there
[1:33] could be more reasons but i found three
[1:37] and lastly we'll refute the two
[1:39] incorrect explanations about 1977.
[1:44] the timeline of all 21 mentions about
[1:47] 1977.
[1:50] the first three mentions of 1977 were in
[1:53] the sermon teaching on moses from may 13
[1:56] 1956
[1:57] you'll hear brother branham say the word
[1:59] predict three times
[2:01] and also specifically say
[2:04] i don't say the lord told me this let's
[2:06] listen to the quote
[2:08] and remember i predict
[2:11] that before the great
[2:13] total annihilation which i
[2:16] don't say the lord told me this but i
[2:18] believe there will be something happen
[2:19] either between now or at that time and
[2:23] 77 it may come back without but between
[2:26] now and 77
[2:28] i predict that either a great
[2:30] destruction or total annihilation of the
[2:33] empire earth
[2:34] between now and 77 i predicted it in
[2:38] 1933
[2:42] the fourth time he mentions 1977
[2:45] is in the sermon by faith moses july
[2:48] 20th 1958
[2:50] brother branham again says the word
[2:52] predict twice in this quote
[2:54] and he specifically says this is not the
[2:57] lord saying this let's listen to the
[2:59] quote
[3:01] and then there will come a total
[3:02] annihilation the entire nation will be
[3:04] wiped out and that i predict now this is
[3:08] not the lord saying this the other about
[3:10] the woman in his is the lord but i
[3:12] predicted in 1933
[3:17] that the world would be total
[3:19] annihilation before 77.
[3:23] i'd like to point out that this was the
[3:25] quote where brother brandon predicted
[3:27] total annihilation in the united states
[3:30] with just tree stumps left before 1977
[3:35] so this statement clearly proves brother
[3:37] brandon was just predicting
[3:38] because total annihilation did not
[3:40] happen before 1977. there was never a
[3:43] time in the united states before 1977
[3:46] when only tree stumps were left it seems
[3:48] brother brandon was just greatly
[3:49] convinced a world war iii type of war
[3:52] was going to take place in america
[3:54] before 1977
[3:56] and of course that did not happen but
[3:58] that's okay brother i'm still a prophet
[4:00] he never said thus saith the lord
[4:03] the fifth mention is from the sermon
[4:06] condemnation by representation
[4:08] from november 13th 1960 brother branham
[4:11] specifically said predict let's listen
[4:14] to the quote
[4:16] i remember lord that's what the lord
[4:18] showed
[4:19] but i predict this will take place
[4:22] before
[4:24] 1977.
[4:27] this prediction our base because
[4:31] of the
[4:34] all-rushing slot that's coming
[4:36] now
[4:38] how fast it was moving how long it'll
[4:40] take until this nation
[4:42] meets its place
[4:46] the sixth mention is from the sermon
[4:48] conference from november 25th 1960
[4:52] brother ram said the word predict
[4:54] and he specifically said not in the
[4:56] trance
[4:57] this statement is very important as
[4:59] we'll see later in this video
[5:01] it seems from brother brown's tapes
[5:03] brother adam never had a vision about
[5:04] 1977.
[5:06] let's listen to the
[5:08] i turned to quote and i've seen in the
[5:10] united states as a smoldering
[5:13] something that burned up
[5:16] and down beneath there i said not in the
[5:19] trance but i predict
[5:21] remember this i guess this is taste too
[5:24] i predict
[5:26] that these things will take place
[5:27] between now 19 and 33
[5:30] and 19 and 77
[5:32] which will give us 16 more years if not
[5:35] prediction tracks right
[5:40] the seventh mention was from the sermon
[5:41] the ephesian church age from december
[5:44] 5th 1960
[5:45] brother brahm said the word predict once
[5:48] and he also said not the lord told me so
[5:51] the lord did not say anything about
[5:53] 1977. that was brother ham's own thought
[5:56] let's listen to the quote
[6:07] [Laughter]
[6:15] but i predicted according to a vision
[6:17] that was shelby some
[6:19] uh years ago that five of those things
[6:21] as i was seven has already taken place
[6:24] about
[6:27] the eighth mention is from the fire tier
[6:29] and church age december 8th 1960 brother
[6:33] branham said the word predict
[6:35] let's listen to the quote
[6:38] his stumps are burning rocks blowed out
[6:41] the whole united states is like
[6:44] as far as i could see where i was
[6:45] standing and i said i predict according
[6:48] to the way time is moving it'll be
[6:51] sometime between this year 33 and 77
[6:56] and it'll have to squeeze a little hard
[6:58] to get through there
[7:01] the ninth and tenth mentions are from
[7:03] the sermon the laodicean church age from
[7:05] december 11 1960.
[7:08] brother branham said predict four times
[7:10] in these quotes
[7:12] and said three important statements he
[7:14] said i don't say it will be
[7:16] he said i could miss it a hundred years
[7:19] and he said i could be wrong
[7:21] the fact that he said i could be wrong
[7:23] proves there was no prophecy related to
[7:25] 1977 because thus saith the lord could
[7:28] never be wrong and the year 1977 was
[7:31] never spoken with thus saith the lord
[7:34] let's listen to the quote
[7:36] we believe that the lady ocean church
[7:38] started
[7:39] in 80
[7:41] 1906.
[7:44] i predict
[7:45] i remember
[7:47] predict especially
[7:48] today
[7:50] i don't say it will be
[7:52] but predict that it will end by 19 and
[7:55] 77.
[7:57] that the
[7:58] church will go completely into apostasy
[8:01] and shall be ousted out of the mouth of
[8:03] god
[8:04] and the second coming or the rapture of
[8:06] christ might come anytime
[8:09] and i can miss that a year i can miss it
[8:12] 20 years i can listen 100 years i don't
[8:14] know where but i just predict that
[8:17] according to a vision he showed me and
[8:19] taking the time the way it's progressing
[8:22] i'd say it'll be sometime between 33 and
[8:24] 77
[8:26] at least this great nation is going to
[8:29] strike a wall
[8:30] that's going to glow into bits see
[8:34] now that's pretty close
[8:37] awful close i could be wrong
[8:45] in the next sermon the 70th week of
[8:47] daniel we have the most times brother
[8:49] branham ever spoke about 1977 in one
[8:52] sermon
[8:53] there are eight mentions of 1977 in this
[8:55] sermon preached on august 6
[8:58] 1961.
[9:00] brother branham says predict three times
[9:03] and he specifically said don't
[9:04] misunderstand and say brother branham
[9:07] said jesus will come in 1977.
[9:10] let's listen to these quotes
[9:12] now
[9:13] counting the time
[9:16] we find that we have exactly listen
[9:21] 17 years left
[9:24] and we will have the same span of time
[9:27] given to us as god dealing with us in
[9:30] the power of the holy spirit since 1833
[9:33] until 1977
[9:36] the same span of time of 1954 years god
[9:40] deals with us the same as he did with
[9:42] the jews amen amen
[9:45] how about that
[9:46] hallelujah
[9:48] from the first jubilee of leviticus 25 8
[9:54] and 1977
[9:57] will be the 70th jubilee making exactly
[10:00] 3 430 years
[10:05] we got 17 years left
[10:09] until 77
[10:11] will be the 70th jubilee since the
[10:14] beginning of jubilees
[10:16] and what will it be
[10:18] oh brother watch close now don't miss it
[10:21] it'll be the jubilee of
[10:24] the going up of the gentile pride and
[10:26] the return of christ to the jews
[10:29] when they go out of bondage
[10:33] that was in
[10:34] 1933 and i predicted that there would be
[10:37] some great tragedy happen to this united
[10:41] states before or by the year of 1977.
[10:45] how many remembers me saying that look
[10:47] at the hand
[10:49] i'll predict at the time i don't know
[10:51] why i'm saying it but i predicted
[10:53] that'll all happen between
[10:55] right now 19 and 33 and 19 and 77
[10:58] and not knowing it god knows my heart i
[11:00] never know it until yesterday that 1977
[11:03] is the jubilee and exactly the same
[11:06] amount of time run out that you give
[11:07] with israel and everything at the end
[11:12] i do not want anyone to go away
[11:14] misunderstanding this
[11:16] hate's still plain
[11:18] i don't want anyone to misunderstand
[11:20] don't misunderstand that i'd say brother
[11:21] bannon said jesus will come in 1977. i
[11:24] never said no such thing amen jesus may
[11:27] come today
[11:29] but i have predicted that between 33 and
[11:33] 77 something would take place
[11:37] this sermon in particular the 70th week
[11:40] of daniel
[11:41] is the sermon where brother branham
[11:42] gives us two reasons why he thought
[11:44] 1977 was significant and of course i'll
[11:48] speak on that in the next section of
[11:50] this video
[11:51] i also want you to notice the seventh
[11:53] week of daniel was the last time on tape
[11:55] brother branham said the year 1977.
[11:59] that's quite significant so that
[12:01] includes 1962 63 64 65.
[12:05] the next four years of brother iran's
[12:06] ministry he never mentioned the year
[12:08] 1977.
[12:10] and then in the book the exposition of
[12:12] the seven church ages brother brandon
[12:14] mentions 1977 three times
[12:18] in the church age book brother branham
[12:20] said the word predict three times
[12:22] for a total of 21 mentions throughout
[12:24] his entire ministry
[12:26] he specifically wrote i did not say
[12:28] prophesy
[12:30] and i do not prophesy let's listen to
[12:33] the quotes
[12:35] the laodicean age began around the turn
[12:37] of the 20th century perhaps 1906
[12:40] how long will it last
[12:42] as a servant of god who has had
[12:43] multitudes of visions of which none has
[12:46] ever failed let me predict i did not say
[12:49] prophesy but predict
[12:51] that this age will end around 1977.
[12:54] if you will pardon a personal note here
[12:56] i've based this prediction on seven
[12:58] major continuous visions that came to me
[13:01] one sunday morning in june 1933.
[13:06] based on these seven visions along with
[13:07] the rapid changes which have swept the
[13:09] world in the last 50 years i predict i
[13:13] do not prophesy
[13:14] that these visions will have all come to
[13:16] pass by 1977
[13:19] and though many may feel that this is an
[13:21] irresponsible statement in view of the
[13:23] fact that jesus said that no man knoweth
[13:26] the day nor the hour
[13:28] i still maintain this prediction after
[13:30] 30 years
[13:31] because jesus did not say no man could
[13:34] know the year month or week in which his
[13:36] coming was to be completed
[13:38] so i repeat
[13:40] i sincerely believe and maintain as a
[13:42] private student of the word
[13:44] along with divine inspiration that 1977
[13:47] ought to terminate the world systems and
[13:49] usher in the millennium
[13:53] the three reasons brother branham
[13:55] possibly thought
[13:57] 1977 was divine inspiration
[14:01] based upon the quotes i've read and
[14:02] listened to it seems there are three
[14:04] reasons brother branham strongly
[14:06] emphasized
[14:07] 1977
[14:09] but of course there could be more and
[14:11] i'm open to receiving other quotes from
[14:13] viewers if i'm not aware of them
[14:15] notice i'm only using quotes from the
[14:18] tapes and not personal stories that are
[14:20] not recorded on tape
[14:22] i'm using brother rams recorded words
[14:24] only
[14:26] before sharing these three reasons i
[14:28] must point out two truths about the 1977
[14:32] prediction that many fail to understand
[14:35] first brother ram said he did not know
[14:37] why he said 1977 after he first received
[14:40] the seven major visions of 1933.
[14:43] this means brother branham did not have
[14:45] a vision about 1977
[14:47] for if he did he would have known why he
[14:49] made a 1977 prediction
[14:52] he specifically says i don't know why
[14:54] i'm saying it so brother ram didn't seem
[14:57] to know why he said 1977. let's listen
[14:59] to the quote
[15:01] i said the way progress i got back to
[15:03] one of their wall and run to the other
[15:05] wall i said the way progress is going on
[15:08] i'll predict at the time i don't know
[15:10] why i'm saying it but i predicted
[15:11] that'll all happen between
[15:14] right now 19 and 33 and 19 and 77.
[15:18] secondly
[15:19] 1977 was not in the trance wherein he
[15:23] saw the seven major visions
[15:25] this quote proves again that the 1977
[15:28] prediction was not part of any vision
[15:30] from the lord jesus
[15:32] let's listen to the quote and notice he
[15:34] said not in the trance
[15:36] then our time to look and are seen in
[15:38] the united states as a smoldering
[15:41] something that burned up
[15:44] and down beneath there i said not in the
[15:47] trance but i predict
[15:49] remember this i guess this is take two
[15:52] i predict that these things will take
[15:55] place between now 19 and 33
[15:58] and 19 and 77.
[16:02] so we conclude brother branham never had
[16:04] any visions at least recorded on tape
[16:06] related to the 1977 prediction
[16:09] reason number one why brother branham
[16:11] emphasized 1977
[16:14] brother random seemed to think that jews
[16:15] and gentiles would have the same amount
[16:17] of time to receive their covenants
[16:21] in the quote you'll soon hear from the
[16:23] 70th week of daniel brother branham says
[16:25] the jews and gentiles each got
[16:28] 1954 years
[16:30] to receive the covenants from god
[16:32] brother brahm said from the time
[16:34] god gave the covenant to abraham in
[16:36] genesis 12 verse 3 until the time of
[16:39] jesus's
[16:40] rejection in a.d 33 he said that time
[16:44] was
[16:44] 1954 years
[16:46] and then brother adam said from 33 a.d
[16:49] to 1977 would be
[16:52] 1954 years
[16:54] now of course if you do the math
[16:56] 1977
[16:58] or 1977 minus 33 or 80 33
[17:03] is 1944
[17:05] so it seems brother band was 10 years
[17:07] off in this calculation so this
[17:09] miscalculation again shows how
[17:11] this 1977 prediction was just that it
[17:14] was a human prediction
[17:15] and of course if i've done anything
[17:16] wrong on my math or anything please let
[17:18] me know
[17:19] i'm always open to correction
[17:21] let's listen to the quotes
[17:23] a striking statement
[17:25] from the time god
[17:27] made the promise to abraham
[17:30] don't miss this
[17:31] from the time god made the promise to
[17:34] abraham
[17:35] genesis
[17:36] 12 3
[17:38] to the time of christ being rejected in
[17:41] 1833
[17:43] by the jews
[17:44] according to galatians 3 16 and 17
[17:49] and according to usher's
[17:52] ushers ursus chronology
[17:55] of the hebrews
[17:57] the power of god was with the jews
[17:59] exactly
[18:01] 1954 years
[18:05] god dealt with the jews
[18:08] 1954 years
[18:10] according to the chronology of the jews
[18:12] and according to galatians 3 16 and 17
[18:15] it got many more scriptures but just did
[18:16] that
[18:18] then after they rejected christ he
[18:22] turned to the gentiles to take a people
[18:25] for his name
[18:26] do
[18:33] now
[18:35] counting the time
[18:37] we find that we have exactly listen
[18:42] 17 years left
[18:45] and we will have the same span of time
[18:48] given to us as god dealing with us in
[18:51] the power of the holy spirit since 1833
[18:55] until 1977
[18:57] the same span of time of 1954 years god
[19:01] deals with us the same as he did with
[19:03] the jews
[19:04] amen
[19:06] how about that
[19:10] reason number two
[19:12] brother branham thought 1977 was the
[19:14] time god would return to the jews
[19:17] because it was supposedly
[19:19] 3430 years since the first jewish
[19:22] jubilee
[19:24] in the same sermon the seventh week of
[19:26] daniel brother branham said the first
[19:28] jubilee took place
[19:30] at about 1453
[19:32] bc and this was spoken of in the bible
[19:35] in leviticus 25 verse 8.
[19:37] and so if you do the math
[19:39] 70 jubilees would be 70 times 49 or
[19:44] 3430 years and if you add the years from
[19:47] 1453
[19:50] bc to 1977
[19:53] that matches the
[19:55] 3430 years that it would take to cover
[19:58] 70 jubilees
[20:00] so in other words brother branham was
[20:01] saying god had to return to the jews
[20:03] after the 70th jubilee and of course
[20:06] that was brother iran's prediction
[20:08] that did not come to pass the jews are
[20:10] still blinded to the new covenant but it
[20:12] shows again how brother ben was trying
[20:13] to use math and historical biblical
[20:16] dates to predict the year that the lord
[20:18] might return brother branham may have
[20:20] been using math and dates because as
[20:23] you'll recall brother branham said in
[20:25] the church age book that jesus did not
[20:27] say we could not know the year
[20:29] month or week of his coming
[20:32] and notice also in this next quote
[20:34] you'll hear brother branham say he
[20:35] learned about the 70th jubilee from
[20:37] historian named paul boyd which again
[20:40] shows brother branham was not a
[20:41] plagiarist
[20:43] let's listen to the quotes
[20:46] now
[20:47] mark down in your book
[20:49] a little scripture here i want to give
[20:50] you leviticus 25 beginning with the
[20:53] eighth verse
[20:55] god called the jubilee every 49th year
[20:59] the 50th year was a jubilee we know that
[21:03] we understand that
[21:05] from the first jubilee of leviticus 25 8
[21:10] and 1977
[21:13] will be the 70th jubilee making exactly
[21:17] three thousand four hundred and thirty
[21:18] years
[21:21] jubilee means
[21:24] release
[21:26] oh we're watching for the coming of that
[21:28] glad millennium day when our blessed
[21:31] lord shall come and catch his wedding
[21:32] brought away
[21:34] oh the world is growing crying for that
[21:37] day of sweet release when our savior
[21:39] shall come back to earth again
[21:42] did you get that yes
[21:46] god has dealt with us exactly the same
[21:49] amount of time that he dealt with the
[21:51] jews from the time he gave abraham the
[21:53] promise until the rejecting of the
[21:54] messiah in 80 33.
[21:58] was 1954 years and now we have 17 years
[22:04] left
[22:05] we had about
[22:07] 1930-something years we got 17 years
[22:11] left
[22:13] until 77
[22:15] will be the 70th jubilee since the
[22:18] beginning of jubilees
[22:21] and what will it be
[22:22] oh brother watch close now don't miss it
[22:25] it'll be the jubilee of
[22:28] the going up of the gentile pride and
[22:31] the return of christ to the jews amen
[22:33] when they go out of bondage amen
[22:36] don't you see
[22:37] from all the world together there for
[22:39] that day
[22:42] hallelujah
[22:47] see where we're at
[22:48] we don't know what time it might happen
[22:50] oh brother we're at the end of it now
[22:53] listen to your old timers here in the in
[22:55] the church has been here for a long time
[22:58] i want you to notice something i never
[23:00] learned this until yesterday i picked it
[23:02] up from historian paul boyd
[23:05] and
[23:06] then
[23:07] i traced it back to the scriptures
[23:09] picked up these other dates here and so
[23:11] forth and got it and run it traced it
[23:13] through
[23:16] before moving on to the third reason i
[23:18] also want to show a quote from the end
[23:20] of this sermon the seventh week of
[23:21] daniel
[23:22] wherein brother branham said this 1977
[23:24] prediction was a scriptural teaching he
[23:27] said just absolutely perfectly
[23:29] scriptural proof
[23:31] so based upon these two
[23:33] numerical predictions
[23:35] that pointed brother branham to the year
[23:36] 1977 although the first one was off by
[23:39] 10 years
[23:40] brother random made it sound like it was
[23:42] a vindicated bible-based teaching
[23:44] as you listen to the quote notice
[23:46] brother random is convinced the end is
[23:47] so close he says we may never live to
[23:50] get back again tonight to the evening
[23:52] service there on august 6 1961. so again
[23:56] this shows how a bible-based prophet
[23:57] like brother branham could believe
[23:59] something was just absolutely perfectly
[24:01] scriptural and be wrong but that's okay
[24:04] brother branham said i could be wrong
[24:05] about the 1977 prediction he said that
[24:08] numerous times
[24:10] let's listen to the quotes
[24:12] little children
[24:14] we never know
[24:16] we may never live to get back again
[24:17] tonight
[24:19] we may never live to see one another
[24:20] again
[24:21] i don't know
[24:22] but the end is so near
[24:25] the end is so close
[24:28] here's the scripture there's this
[24:29] absolutely perfectly scriptural proof
[24:32] now if there's something you didn't
[24:33] understand write me a note let me know
[24:34] about it see say something some of your
[24:36] brethren out there on the tapes and the
[24:38] other parts if there's someone i can
[24:39] help you let me know
[24:43] reason number three
[24:44] brother branham thought no democracy had
[24:46] ever lasted 200 years and therefore
[24:49] thought the united states of america
[24:51] could not last 200 years after the year
[24:53] of its inception
[24:55] 1776
[24:57] which 200 years later would have been
[24:59] 1976.
[25:01] in this masterpiece quote from july 5th
[25:03] 1964 brother ram said no democracy had
[25:06] lasted 200 years
[25:08] i haven't studied this extensively but
[25:10] it seems accurate as the ancient greeks
[25:13] had a democratic rule for almost two
[25:15] centuries
[25:16] according to the encyclopedia britannica
[25:18] website
[25:19] and the ancient greek golden age of
[25:21] democracy
[25:22] was around 430 bc
[25:25] but again we can clearly see how brother
[25:27] ram felt the nation would not survive or
[25:30] live to see 1977.
[25:32] let's listen to the quote
[25:34] as we see the days darkening as we see
[25:37] the shadows falling
[25:39] when i predict it's just a few more
[25:41] turns of the sun this nation's gone
[25:44] do you know yesterday
[25:48] fourth of july
[25:51] thomas jefferson
[25:53] had signed the declaration of
[25:55] independence him and the other uh lord
[25:58] that was with him
[25:59] and the liberty bell rang and we was
[26:01] declared an independence as a nation
[26:04] according to history there has never
[26:05] been a democracy at any time last over
[26:08] 200 years that was 17 and 76 july the
[26:12] 4th
[26:14] and we're
[26:15] just 11 years left
[26:18] will it make it
[26:20] no
[26:22] can't
[26:23] 11 years
[26:24] if it does it'll break all history
[26:28] so i believe these are the three reasons
[26:30] why brother branham wrote his prediction
[26:33] about 1977 was with divine inspiration
[26:36] in the church age book
[26:39] first he thought the jews and gentiles
[26:40] would have the same number of years to
[26:42] receive their covenants
[26:44] 1954.
[26:46] he thought 1977 would be the
[26:48] 70th jubilee for the jews and god would
[26:50] return to the jews
[26:52] and third the historical fact that no
[26:54] democracy had lasted over 200 years
[26:58] remember brother branham felt he had
[26:59] bible verses to support his prediction
[27:02] namely the historical dates related to
[27:04] abraham in genesis 12 3
[27:07] galatians 3 verses 16 and 17 and acts 15
[27:11] verse 14. and he had scripture for the
[27:14] historical dates related to moses and
[27:16] the jubilee in leviticus 25 verse 8.
[27:20] and then thirdly he had the historical
[27:22] dates related to the ancient greeks
[27:24] before finishing this section i want to
[27:26] share one more brother random quote
[27:28] related to predicting the end of time
[27:31] in november 1963 brother graham said our
[27:34] calendar said there were 36 more years
[27:37] for the work to be over
[27:38] he was finishing his sermon the three
[27:41] kinds of believers
[27:42] trying to get every person to be saved
[27:44] and said the end would be either 36
[27:46] years 15 years or 20 years which would
[27:49] be 1999 1978 and 1983 respectively
[27:56] it's clear brother branham was doing
[27:57] everything in his power to influence
[27:59] young and old to repent and be saved
[28:02] before it was their time to die
[28:04] and meet god or before the great
[28:06] tribulation period set in
[28:09] brother adam lived in a tumultuous time
[28:11] politically as he mentioned atom bombs
[28:13] and president kennedy's assassination in
[28:16] this quote
[28:17] he even prayed and asked god for
[28:18] forgiveness for his mistakes
[28:20] asking for strength to make the gospel
[28:22] more plain to the ears
[28:24] let's listen to the
[28:28] the power to quote like enoch and not
[28:31] have to die but just take an afternoon's
[28:33] walk and go home with him
[28:35] but god i do believe that it will happen
[28:38] because i know there's to be a rapture
[28:40] in the last days and the works to be cut
[28:43] short the father so says our calendar 36
[28:46] more years
[28:48] and the work will be over
[28:50] and you'll have to come sometime within
[28:52] that or there'll be no flesh saved and
[28:54] then we're told by the chronologists
[28:58] and the people who search such things
[29:00] that we are absolutely advanced many
[29:03] many years from that many years
[29:05] on up they're telling us by the
[29:07] calendars that we're way up further than
[29:10] that maybe there's only 15 or 20 years
[29:12] left i don't know
[29:14] but i know even according to our
[29:16] calendar we're almost there
[29:19] i see where there cannot be any hope
[29:21] left for
[29:23] there is coming
[29:25] if they ever start turning those bombs
[29:27] loose on each other lord there
[29:29] will be no battlefront
[29:32] they'll
[29:33] they will destroy one another
[29:37] the lord is hanging there and yet the
[29:40] bible says the whole heavens and earth
[29:42] will be on fire
[29:44] god
[29:45] i see the hour appearing
[29:47] i think of assassination of the
[29:48] president
[29:50] and then see that other evil man come in
[29:52] without letting the man have a trial and
[29:55] shot him down in cold-blooded murder
[29:58] oh god one's as guilty as the other
[30:00] they have no right to do that
[30:02] evil in our own nation supposed to be a
[30:05] christian nation
[30:07] what a poor example we are lord of
[30:09] christians
[30:10] forgive us lord of our sins
[30:13] help us oh god
[30:15] especially your church
[30:20] i
[30:20] i'm only trying to do this because i
[30:23] feel your commission is for me to do it
[30:25] so father here i am doing the best i can
[30:28] with forgive my feeble
[30:30] mistakes lord i pray that you shall
[30:33] grant me strength i'll be able to make
[30:35] it more plainer to the people
[30:39] refuting two incorrect explanations
[30:41] about 1977.
[30:44] i've heard numerous interpretations
[30:46] about the 1977 prediction but two of
[30:49] them i've heard most often
[30:52] and i believe both are clearly wrong
[30:54] first some say the 1977 statement was a
[30:57] prophecy or divinely inspired
[31:00] and that the world literally changed in
[31:02] 1977
[31:04] both naturally and spiritually
[31:06] this is the more widely held belief of
[31:08] the two beliefs
[31:10] so was 1977 a prophecy i believe the
[31:13] answer is no
[31:14] 19 times brother branham said it was a
[31:16] prediction plus he said the following
[31:19] quotes about this prediction
[31:21] quote i don't say the lord told me this
[31:23] this is not the lord saying this
[31:25] not in the trance
[31:27] not the lord told me i don't say it will
[31:29] be i could miss it a hundred years i
[31:32] could be wrong
[31:33] don't misunderstand and say brother
[31:35] branham said jesus will come in 1977. i
[31:38] did not say prophesy
[31:40] i do not prophesy end quote
[31:43] again brother brahm said i could be
[31:45] wrong about 1977.
[31:48] prophecies spoken with thus saith the
[31:49] lord could never be wrong so this again
[31:51] proves 1977 was just a human prediction
[31:55] and not a prophecy
[31:56] also did the world literally change in
[31:58] 1977
[32:00] well in one sense it did but in another
[32:03] sense there was no significant change
[32:05] that was unlike any other year
[32:07] what i mean by that is that i think it's
[32:10] safe to say the world changes every year
[32:12] with 2020 being a prime example of how
[32:14] quickly the world can change
[32:16] especially regarding the shutdowns and
[32:19] the mask and vaccine mandates
[32:21] so i don't think the position is valid
[32:23] to say 1977 changed the world unlike any
[32:27] other year some have said that 1977
[32:30] changed the world because the apple
[32:32] company began and also elvis died and a
[32:35] few other reasons but the same can be
[32:37] said for other years what about 1973
[32:40] when abortion became legal never before
[32:42] had millions upon millions of babies
[32:44] been aborted
[32:46] some would say that was a more drastic
[32:47] change than anything that happened in
[32:49] 1977.
[32:50] didn't the murder of millions upon
[32:52] millions of unborn children change the
[32:54] world for the worse didn't the world
[32:56] change when the amazon company began in
[32:58] 1994
[33:00] without a doubt didn't the world change
[33:02] in 2015 when the supreme court ruled
[33:04] homosexual marriages were legal of
[33:06] course that was a change for the worse
[33:08] but yet wasn't it a more significant
[33:10] change than elvis dying or the beginning
[33:12] of the apple company
[33:14] also people have asked me what about the
[33:16] supposed vision brother branham had
[33:18] about 1977
[33:21] it's been spread abroad about a supposed
[33:23] vision brother branham had of 1977 and
[33:26] in his vision it was pitch black
[33:28] after or around 1977 but friends there
[33:32] is no quote from brother branham on tape
[33:34] about this supposed vision
[33:37] some who hold this position do not seem
[33:39] to realize what they're doing they're
[33:41] actually contradicting themselves
[33:43] for example some of these same believers
[33:46] say say what the tapes say
[33:48] yet those who say say what the tapes say
[33:51] are in the case of 1977 saying don't say
[33:54] what the tapes say related to 1977 say
[33:57] what an unknown or unnamed brother said
[34:00] about a supposed conversation he had
[34:02] with brother branham
[34:04] in my humble opinion i cannot support
[34:05] this blatant contradiction
[34:08] how can we say say what the tapes say
[34:10] in some cases and in other cases we can
[34:13] say don't say what the tapes say say
[34:15] what this brother from another country
[34:16] said
[34:18] and then there's a second contradiction
[34:19] as well
[34:20] some of these same believers say you
[34:23] can't correct a prophet
[34:25] and yet they are correcting brother
[34:26] branham's words that clearly state 1977
[34:30] was not a prophecy and just a prediction
[34:32] and that brother brahm did not know why
[34:34] he said 1977.
[34:36] so again they say you can't correct a
[34:38] prophet but when they speak about 1977
[34:41] they are trying to correct a prophet
[34:42] they're trying to make his words a
[34:44] prophecy yet brother adam clearly said
[34:46] they were just a prediction
[34:48] remember i've already shown in this
[34:49] video the three reasons brother branham
[34:51] gave for believing 1977 was an end date
[34:55] for the united states of america and two
[34:57] of them come from the 1961 sermon
[34:59] daniel's 70th week wherein brother
[35:01] branham explained by dates and counters
[35:03] why he was amazed the dates of both
[35:05] abraham's covenant and moses's jubilee
[35:08] years seemed to work out to 1977.
[35:11] the second less-held view is that the
[35:14] 1977 statement was a prophecy and we are
[35:17] now in the millennium due to the church
[35:19] age book quote about ushering in the
[35:21] millennium as you heard earlier
[35:24] this is the less held view friends
[35:25] brother branham clearly said the
[35:27] laodicean church age goes on until the
[35:30] rapture of the church
[35:31] let's listen to the quotes
[35:33] brother branham have you made statements
[35:35] recently concerning that
[35:37] church age has ended ladies
[35:41] no
[35:41] i never said it's ended if i did you
[35:44] misunderstood it i said it wrong it is
[35:46] this is the last church age it's the end
[35:49] of church ages the lady will see it it
[35:52] hasn't ended
[35:53] when it ends the church is gone so as
[35:56] long as the church is here it hasn't
[35:57] ended i think
[36:01] a church has ended and as
[36:04] blacked out the bride is called we have
[36:07] already
[36:08] entered into the tribulation period no
[36:12] no
[36:12] no you i wish i could just have more
[36:15] time on that thing see
[36:18] the bride
[36:19] when she's taken from the church
[36:23] then
[36:24] the church age will cease
[36:27] lady asea goes into chaos
[36:30] the bride goes to glory
[36:33] and the tribulation period sets in upon
[36:35] the sleeping version
[36:37] for three and a half years while israel
[36:40] is getting its prophecy
[36:42] then tribulation sets in upon israel and
[36:45] then comes the battle of armageddon
[36:47] which destroys all things and then the
[36:51] bride returns back with the groom for a
[36:53] thousand years the millennium reign
[36:55] after that comes a white throne judgment
[36:57] after that comes the new heavens and new
[36:59] earth and the new city coming down from
[37:01] god out of heaven eternity and time
[37:04] blends together
[37:07] also the rapture is the time of the
[37:09] church ages being capped off with christ
[37:12] coming
[37:13] brother brandon may have taught the
[37:14] capstone was already put on but then he
[37:16] changed it in 1961 brother branham
[37:18] taught the capstone was the rapture
[37:20] here's the quote
[37:22] daniel said he watched this gentile age
[37:25] until a stone
[37:27] come out of the mountain that wasn't cut
[37:29] with hands
[37:30] they have never put a capstone on that
[37:33] pyramid
[37:37] [Music]
[37:42] you see it
[37:44] and what did it do it hit the image
[37:47] right smack in the feed
[37:49] and broke it to pieces
[37:54] hallelujah amen
[37:56] what happened at that time the coming of
[37:57] that stone
[37:59] up with the church in the glory
[38:01] at the rapture cause it ended
[38:13] and then in 1965 brother graham said the
[38:15] capstone had still not come
[38:17] let's listen to the quote
[38:19] sometimes the capstone will return the
[38:22] head of all of it
[38:23] and receive the writing to himself which
[38:25] the woman is taught from the man a part
[38:28] of the man
[38:31] next if 1977 was the end of the united
[38:34] states that means daniel's 70th week
[38:37] began in 1977
[38:39] so that means the first half of the
[38:41] seven year tribulation period lasted
[38:43] from 1977 to the middle of 1980 and then
[38:47] the second half of it lasted from the
[38:49] middle of 1980 to 1984.
[38:52] so does this mean we're now in the 38th
[38:54] year of the millennium
[38:56] the answer is no
[38:58] also if we're in the millennium where is
[39:00] the video proof of the two jewish
[39:02] prophets preaching during the last three
[39:04] and a half years of the great
[39:05] tribulation period which would have been
[39:07] from 1977 to the middle of 1980.
[39:11] where's the video proof they turned
[39:13] water to blood
[39:14] and ceased the rain for three and a half
[39:16] years and the proof that they died
[39:18] resurrected and went in the rapture to
[39:20] heaven as revelation 11 declares
[39:23] of course there is no proof because this
[39:24] never happened yet
[39:27] in this next quote brother branham said
[39:28] a thousand years of peace has not
[39:30] happened and this was spoken in 1964.
[39:34] brother brahm said there would be no sin
[39:36] during the millennium
[39:37] anyone who believes we're in the
[39:38] millennium is totally deceived because
[39:40] they sin every single day and brother
[39:42] branham and the bible say there'll be no
[39:44] sin in the millennium because satan is
[39:46] bound
[39:47] in the bottomless pit and he cannot
[39:48] influence people to sin let's listen to
[39:51] the quote
[39:52] so sin will still be on the other side
[39:54] of milan but not doing the millennium
[39:57] see doing millennium is peace
[39:59] see but sin will be dealt with the other
[40:02] side of millennium and then time fades
[40:04] out and now the opening of the seven
[40:06] seals that was given by the holy spirit
[40:09] the seven seals only was to make knowing
[40:12] what had been left off in the
[40:15] dispensations behind us
[40:18] also notice in the next quote from 1953
[40:21] brother branham says we'll reign here
[40:22] with christ for a thousand years
[40:25] if we're in the millennium where is
[40:26] brother branham currently physically
[40:28] ruling and reigning here on the earth
[40:31] the answer is he's not because we're not
[40:33] in the millennium let's listen to the
[40:37] has done quote
[40:38] the
[40:39] penalty of death done been taken off and
[40:41] now we just go right into his presence
[40:43] and someday return back and be made
[40:45] immortal and live on this earth
[40:48] a thousand years of jesus christ amen i
[40:51] believe that
[40:52] i'm strictly a millennial i believe in
[40:54] the millennium i believe all these
[40:56] hebrew prophets and through the ages
[40:58] spoke on the golden age of millennium
[41:00] coming and i believe we're gonna have it
[41:03] and we'll reign here with him a thousand
[41:09] in closing
[41:11] friends i hope this video has been a
[41:12] blessing
[41:13] over the years i've been asked about the
[41:14] 1977 prediction many many times i've
[41:18] even preached on it a number of times
[41:20] but i felt led this was the time to
[41:22] really study it out as deeply as i ever
[41:24] had and i trust by the grace of god that
[41:27] you can now see that it was a prediction
[41:29] and not a prophecy
[41:31] of course you and i are going to come
[41:32] across people we may disagree with so
[41:34] the main thing to do is have christian
[41:36] love brother branham said we ought to be
[41:38] able to disagree bitterly with someone
[41:40] but then at the end of the conversation
[41:43] think as much of them as christ thinks
[41:45] about them which christ thinks a lot
[41:47] about them because christ died for them
[41:50] so i'm going to end the video with that
[41:51] quote what this world really lacks what
[41:54] the churches lack and what the message
[41:56] lacks in many cases is divine love
[41:59] and also brotherly kindness jesus said
[42:01] because iniquity shall abound the love
[42:03] of god shall wax cold
[42:05] so if there is one place you should find
[42:07] the real love of god it should be in the
[42:09] true bride of jesus christ
[42:11] the true bride no doubt agrees about
[42:13] many things in the scripture there may
[42:15] be a few things here there that
[42:17] the members don't agree about but even
[42:19] in disagreeing they should express the
[42:21] love of jesus christ one toward another
[42:23] let's listen to the quote
[42:25] you don't want to get like
[42:27] oswald see if you can't disagree with a
[42:30] man and things then shake his hand and
[42:31] still have the same feelings towards him
[42:33] then there's something wrong with you
[42:36] if i can't disagree with the men
[42:38] bitterly from one side to the other and
[42:40] still think as much of him as as christ
[42:42] would then there's something wrong with
[42:43] my spirit
[42:45] i haven't the spirit of christ
[42:47] if he says well brother branham i
[42:50] believe that you are teaching is this uh
[42:52] all right brother let's come together to
[42:54] reason you and i we'll take it ourselves
[42:55] we'll go over here in the room to
[42:56] ourselves we'll reason out and he just
[42:58] cuts me to pieces and i have to say
[43:00] things back to him if in my heart i
[43:02] can't feel the same about him and he's
[43:04] still my brother and i'm trying to help
[43:06] him then i'll never help him
[43:08] there's no way for me to help him if i
[43:10] don't love him what's used to going over
[43:12] there
[43:13] telling the first place first brother i
[43:15] don't love you and let me get that out
[43:16] of my heart right here before we go in
[43:17] there because i can't help you until i
[43:19] love you
[43:23] if you have any questions concerns or
[43:25] testimonies about this video please
[43:27] contact me
[43:30] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[43:32] the desire of your heart
