[0:06] greetings friends in the Mattress name
[0:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:11] this video is to answer the question do
[0:14] the 10 commandments apply to Christians
[0:16] the answer is yes for two reasons first
[0:19] the Holy Ghost gives new testament
[0:22] scriptures that keep these moral laws in
[0:24] effect for Christians with two or three
[0:27] witnesses second although Christians are
[0:30] not under the curse of the law God calls
[0:33] us to be holy like he is providing us
[0:36] with His Holy Spirit to fulfill the
[0:38] righteousness of the law by his gift of
[0:41] grace the ten commandments the ten
[0:45] commandments of Moses are still in
[0:47] effect in the New Testament
[0:48] although Saturday sabbath-keeping has a
[0:50] different application for Christians
[0:52] here is the list of the Ten Commandments
[0:55] from Exodus 20 verses 1 to 17 with each
[0:58] Commandments corresponding New Testament
[1:01] scripture or scriptures the two or three
[1:03] witnesses to prove these commands are
[1:05] moral law still in effect in the New
[1:08] Testament the first commandment no other
[1:11] gods before me still in effect according
[1:14] to Matthew 4 verse 10 then G is saith
[1:17] unto him get thee hence Satan for it is
[1:19] written thou shalt worship the Lord thy
[1:21] God and him only shalt thou serve the
[1:25] second commandment make no graven images
[1:28] still in effect according to acts 17 29
[1:32] and revelation 9 24 as much then as we
[1:35] are the offspring of God we ought not to
[1:37] think that the Godhead is like unto gold
[1:39] or silver or stone graven by art and
[1:42] man's device and the times of this
[1:45] ignorance God winked at but now
[1:47] commandeth all men everywhere to repent
[1:49] and the rest of the men which were not
[1:52] killed by these plagues yet repented not
[1:55] of the works of their hands that they
[1:57] should not worship devils and idols of
[1:59] gold and silver and brass and stone and
[2:02] wood which neither can see nor hear nor
[2:05] walk the third commandment do not take
[2:10] the name of the Lord in vain still in
[2:12] effect according to
[2:13] Matthew 6 verse 9 after this manner
[2:16] therefore pray ye our Father which art
[2:19] in heaven hallowed be thy name the
[2:23] fourth commandment keep the Sabbath day
[2:25] holy this has a new application the New
[2:29] Testament Sabbath is the believer
[2:30] resting or ceasing from his sinful works
[2:33] and then doing the works of the Holy
[2:35] Ghost this spiritual rest begins when a
[2:38] person is born again of the Holy Ghost
[2:40] this is proven by isaiah 28 verses 11
[2:44] and 12 and first corinthians 14 verses
[2:46] 21 and 22 notice in isaiah chapter 28
[2:51] isaiah plainly said this is the rest the
[2:55] new rest is connected to God using
[2:57] stammering lips to speak to his people
[2:59] which is fulfilled in Acts chapter 2 for
[3:02] they spoke with tongues as the Spirit
[3:04] gave them utterance
[3:05] in first Corinthians 14 21 Paul later
[3:09] quotes Isaiah 28 verses 11 and 12 and
[3:12] connects it to the tongues that were
[3:14] given to the Jews and all the other
[3:16] nations in Acts chapter 2 God's purpose
[3:19] of Saturday Sabbath keeping in the Old
[3:21] Testament points to something greater to
[3:24] come Jesus teaches that the true rest is
[3:26] the born-again experience he proclaims
[3:29] in John 3:7 and John 7 verses 37 to 39
[3:33] in reference to believers receiving the
[3:36] Holy Ghost Jesus says you must be born
[3:39] again and if any man thirst let him come
[3:41] unto me and drink he that believeth on
[3:44] me as the scripture hath said out of his
[3:46] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[3:48] in the born-again experience a Christian
[3:52] rest or walks according to the spirit
[3:54] and does not fulfill the lusts of the
[3:56] flesh for the remainder of his earthly
[3:58] walk the spear folk Christian will rest
[4:01] or cease from doing lustful sinful
[4:04] habits and will do the works that please
[4:06] God now that's a true rest I would much
[4:09] rather rest for my sinful works every
[4:11] day of my life than just relaxing on
[4:14] each Saturday but continuing sinful
[4:16] works thankfully if we receive the true
[4:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost and rest from
[4:22] our sinful lives we will actually have a
[4:25] physical day of rest built into our week
[4:27] which is Sunday how great is the wisdom
[4:30] of our God just as the early Christians
[4:32] met on the first day of the week
[4:34] according to Acts chapter 20 verse 7 so
[4:37] we meet every Sunday to honor the
[4:38] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[4:40] true Christians will not forsake the
[4:42] assembling of the Saints on the first
[4:44] day of the week because sincere weekly
[4:46] meetings provide spiritual meat
[4:48] edification comfort consolation and more
[4:52] the New Testament Sabbath is the
[4:55] believer resting or ceasing from his
[4:57] sinful works and then doing the works of
[4:59] the Holy Ghost Hebrews chapter 4 verses
[5:02] 1 to 12 also support this teaching
[5:05] specifically verse 9 there remaineth
[5:08] therefore a rest to the people of God
[5:10] for he that has entered into his rest
[5:13] he also hath ceased from his own works
[5:15] as God did from his let us labor
[5:18] therefore to enter into that rest lest
[5:21] any man fall after the same example of
[5:23] unbelief Matthew 11:28 come unto me all
[5:28] ye that labor and are heavy laden and I
[5:30] will give you rest take my yoke upon you
[5:33] and learn of me for I am meek and lowly
[5:35] in heart and ye shall find rest unto
[5:37] your souls the fifth commandment honor
[5:42] thy mother and father still in effect
[5:45] according to Ephesians chapter 6 verses
[5:48] 1 to 3 children obey your parents in the
[5:51] Lord for this is right honor thy father
[5:53] and mother which is the first
[5:55] commandment with promise that it may be
[5:57] well with thee and thou mayest live long
[5:59] on the earth the sixth commandment thou
[6:04] shall not kill still in effect according
[6:06] to Galatians 5:21 envyings murders
[6:10] drunkenness revellings and such like of
[6:14] the which i tell you before as i have
[6:16] also told you in time past that they
[6:18] which do such things shall not inherit
[6:20] the kingdom of god the seventh
[6:23] commandment thou shalt not commit
[6:24] adultery still in a fact according to
[6:27] 1st Corinthians chapter 6 verses 9 and
[6:29] 10 know ye not that the unrighteous
[6:32] shall not inherit the kingdom of God be
[6:34] not deceived neither fornicators nor
[6:36] idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate
[6:40] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[6:42] nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards
[6:45] nor revilers nor extortioners shall
[6:48] inherit the kingdom of God the eighth
[6:51] commandment thou shalt not steal
[6:53] still in effect a corner 1st Corinthians
[6:56] 6 verse 10 nor thieves nor covetous nor
[6:59] drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners
[7:02] shall inherit the kingdom of God the
[7:06] ninth commandment thou shalt not bear
[7:08] false witness still in effect according
[7:11] to Ephesians 4 verse 25 wherefore
[7:14] putting away lying speak every man truth
[7:16] with this neighbor for we are members
[7:18] one of another the tenth commandment
[7:22] thou shalt not covet still in effect
[7:24] according to 1st Corinthians 6 verse 10
[7:27] nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards
[7:30] nor revilers nor extortioners shall
[7:32] inherit the kingdom of God
[7:36] Christians are not under the curse of
[7:39] the law Paul's writings from Romans and
[7:43] Galatians teach that we are not under
[7:45] the law meaning we are not saved by our
[7:47] individual works or by our own
[7:49] righteousness according to Romans 4
[7:51] verses 1 to 16 Romans 6 verses 14 and 15
[7:55] Galatians 2 verse 21 and Galatians 3
[7:59] verse 23 and Galatians 5 verse 4 the law
[8:03] has the power to curse anyone who does
[8:05] not keep every single Old Testament
[8:07] commandment in contrast New Testament
[8:10] believers are saved by grace through
[8:12] faith in Jesus Christ for Christ bore
[8:14] the curse of God for our sins on the
[8:17] cross of Calvary while we are not under
[8:20] the curse of the law God still desires
[8:22] that his children Christians be holy
[8:25] because he is holy Peter says God wants
[8:28] to fashion or pattern his children after
[8:31] his holiness and not patterned after
[8:33] lusts 1st Peter 1 verses 14 through 16
[8:37] as obedient children not fashioning
[8:40] yourselves according to the former lusts
[8:42] in your ignorance but as he which hath
[8:45] called you is holy so be ye holy in all
[8:48] manner of conversation because it is
[8:50] written be holy for I am holy
[8:54] so you see friend a study into New
[8:56] Testament teaching will help you
[8:58] understand that we are to fulfill the
[9:00] righteousness of the law according to
[9:02] Romans 8 verse 4 that the righteousness
[9:04] of the law might be fulfilled in us who
[9:07] walk not after the flesh but after the
[9:09] spirit the Old Testament law is
[9:12] righteous and God desires that New
[9:14] Testament believers walk in obedience to
[9:16] the Holy Ghost which automatically
[9:19] fulfills the righteousness of the law
[9:21] Christians should willingly choose to
[9:23] obey God's Word obeying the will of the
[9:26] Holy Spirit
[9:27] Paul caused this the law the law that we
[9:30] are currently under the law of the
[9:31] Spirit in Romans 8 verses 1 and 2
[9:34] there's therefore now no condemnation to
[9:37] them which are in Christ Jesus who walk
[9:39] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[9:41] for the law of the spirit of life in
[9:44] Christ Jesus hath made me free from the
[9:47] law of sin and death
[9:50] this law of the spear is the same law
[9:52] that Jesus Christ walked in according to
[9:55] Luke 4 verse 14 and Jesus returned in
[9:58] the power of the spirit into Galilee and
[10:01] there went out a fame of him through all
[10:03] the region round about this Holy Ghost
[10:07] law or leading will never lead us into
[10:09] sin but rather into complete obedience
[10:12] to the Word of God Jesus walked in the
[10:14] law of the Spirit his entire life
[10:16] because the spear abode upon him the
[10:19] spirit led Christ into full obedience to
[10:21] the Word of God and so the Spirit will
[10:24] lead our lives the exact same way in
[10:28] closing if you have any questions about
[10:30] how the Ten Commandments still apply to
[10:32] Christians or if you like more
[10:34] information about how to rightly divide
[10:35] the word of God or the Old Testament for
[10:38] the New Testament Christian please

[10:45] Christ be the desire of your heart
