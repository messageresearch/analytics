TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to do a book review on Brother Kyle Morton's book it's from 2021 called some thoughts about balance in the message here's a screenshot of the book I've never met Brother Kyle but he and I have exchanged voice messages on our phones and another sister in the message got me in touch with his ministry which I'm very grateful she did as soon as I started listening to brother Kyle's videos I could tell he had a genuine love for the Lord Jesus Christ and Brother Kyle did not ask me to do this book review this is something I just wanted to do because I've been so blessed by both reading and listening to his book as I've read and listened to his book I have loved his dedication to the scripture and comparing the quotes of brother Branham to the scripture as brother bran taught us to prove All Things by the Bible there's numerous times in his book when he gives his motive an objective one example is on page 18. Brother Kyle said to Simply encourage Believers to live a Godly Balanced Life in Christ Jesus this is a wonderful Godly motive and so I appreciate brother Kyle's desire to help Christians live more balanced before getting into each chapter or movement as Brother Kyle calls them I want to say I've Loved brother Kyle's dedication to scripture his sense of humor his desire to grow his faith his transparency and desire to help others grow in their faith and obviously as with any book you or I might read I personally didn't agree with everything in brother Kyle's book and I say that kindly and humbly because I know he'll probably watch this video and a couple examples are with using Bible translations personally I would only use a King James Version secondly I myself would probably be more harsh on the Tate Church movement because I do believe they're into deep heresy as they exalt every word of brother Branham to thus saith the Lord and also even preachers that say there's no mistakes in the message or the prophet never made any mistakes I believe those types of statements are heretical and it's possible Brother Kyle believes that too I don't know and there's a few other topics where I might have a different opinion on but most of the content in the book I agree with I can say a hearty Amen to and I loved his motive and objective to get people more balanced in the scriptures one more thing before I get started in each movement or chapter I would summarize brother Kyle's book as strong meat to the believer and of course that's out of Hebrews chapter 5. verses 12-14 for the time ye ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are becomes such as have need a milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a babe but strongly belonged to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercise to discern both good and evil I believe that's what Brother Kyle has done in his book Brother Kyle has addressed many many subjects related to the message of the hour and he's bringing more balance to them which is a mature thing to do he's trying to discern between Good and Evil on all these subjects surrounding the message and that's a Godly thing to do that's a mature thing to do it's immature of a lot of message Believers to ignore these topics but Brother Kyle has showed his maturity wanting to grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord wanting to prove all things that's a sign of being a mature believer and again according to the writer of the book of Hebrews which we believe was Saint Paul it is mature Christians Christians who feed on the meat of God's word who want to discern good and evil in their daily lives so now begin highlights by movement or chapter the first section is the introduction and Brother Kyle does a wonderful job introducing his book and I want to play one quote from Brother Branham that Kyle uses it's the Golden Days quote where brother Brown talks about he and his friends disagreeing on the scripture but they go about it in a fun way they go about it in a respectful way let's listen to the quote I can remember coming across the desert the other day I told my wife back there I said here's where brother Jack said in the back of this little Chevrolet brother Brown he had argued all about the the original creation well that was done in six days or what was it in six million years that was a good one they get so hard again they get out and get a handful of rocks and want to get behind one hold one another and throw rocks at one another just sorry they couldn't sell it that way say I can outrun you down the road they go to brother Jack a little short fella just the hardest he can twist and brother young with them long leggings I don't rely so much in my life man brother Jack got back in the car and pulled off his shoes brother shared to give us a big sack of orange isn't he had cleaned him up before he got the streets you know all those golden days old yesterday are golden days I know it sounds jokey funny but it's the truth but we there's something about that as you get older then begins to linger on your mind you think of those days that you wish you could live again it's right our younger days as we get old they all become pictures I'm so glad it was pure and holy brotherly a fellowship and love knowing that we're going to a land where we'll never get old or that great land under or we'll never never grow old or never die the fat Brother Kyle uses this quote from Brother Branham shows his sincere desire that he just wants to have honest humble conversations about these subjects that surround the message of the hour he doesn't want to offend anybody he doesn't want to hurt anybody's feelings but he knows it's important to talk about subjects and not to ignore them and truly it's the desire of every Christian who's really filled with the Holy Ghost to be guided into all truth according to John 16 verse 13. moving on into movement one or chapter one I'll just hit a few highlights that I really enjoyed this movement is called long run for a short jump Brother Kyle gives disclaimers about why he's writing the book and as Christians we should remain teachable I like how Brother Kyle defined message terminology that's very helpful and he admits his book doesn't have perfect grammar I thought that was a humble Godly thing to do and then he goes through seven nut shells or seven themes that are important to discuss the second one in particular I enjoyed brother Branham wanted to accomplish one thing from the church age book and that was to produce a true relationship between God and man let's listen to the quote not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men for in man become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart then Brother Kyle says he's trying to stay in the middle of two extremes and of course these are the same extremes I'm trying to stay in the middle between one extreme is the Tate Church movement which worships brother Brands tapes to me that's a heretical movement The Other Extreme is people that leave the message and deny the message is true this is the group I call the accusers of brother Branham because Satan is the accuser of the Brethren this is the group that gets distracted and they focus on brother Branham too much rather than focusing on the message God sent to brother Branham and I think I would add in here it's even important to say again that there's lots of preachers that lean towards the side of the tape Church movement and say everything on the tapes is thus say the Lord prophets don't make mistakes and these preachers are completely unbalanced so again I love our brother Kyle's desire to stay in the middle of the road just as brother random said in movement number two or chapter two it's called the Plumb line and Brother Kyle gives balance on a lot of significant topics such as the absolute showing how brother Brandon grew in his understanding of the white horse rider he showed brother Brandon was human and made mistakes he wrote about a cherry pits section which proves brother Branham taught us to be careful how we listened to his tapes and not everything brother Branham said was thus said the Lord there's a great section on rightly dividing there's a great quote on how we follow Jesus's bloody Footprints as brother Brandon said there's a great section on Rebecca loving Isaac more than Ellie easer and John the Baptist was not Jesus showing brother Branham was not Jesus Brother Kyle then defined the message then he showed the sermon books of brother Branham are not Jesus Christ but they point us to Jesus Christ and then Brother Kyle gave an awesome section on the token simplified and this section meant a lot to me because my first sermon as Pastor in 2006 was literally called majoring on the token and this may be my favorite portion of the entire book because it emphasizes the baptism of the Holy Ghost then there's a section on we should not be lazy biblically a section on the balance of brother Brandon's statement the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation a section balancing the bleeding word quote a section that balances say what the tapes say and then Brother Kyle made a humble statement are we trying to win arguments or help someone along the way and that was on page 102. moving on to Movement 3 or chapter three it's called Dangerous topics and this section deals with the accusations from believe the sign and similar websites who attacked brother Branham Brother Kyle encourages questions because the elect cannot be deceived which I thought was a tremendous point we're not afraid of questions because we have the truth and Brother Kyle gives simple Common Sense answers on topics like the brown bear the bridge prophecy the man from Windsor the Arizona cloud the supposed plagiarism of the Seven Seals misogyny accusations and others and Brother Kyle even says it's okay to say I don't know if you and I don't know answers but we know the Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth and eventually he'll give us the right answers movement 4 or chapter four is called the kitchen sink this chapter gives answers on many random topics such as wisdom for ministers balancing the quote about staying with your pastor because we don't want to worship the pastor we don't want to exalt the pastor above Jesus Brother Kyle encourages us to be unified on scripture then he shows how brother Branham was open to correction and Brother Kyle dealt with the fallacies where people say there's no truth outside the message or all education is of the devil or missionaries are always in the will of God he gives a great balance on Revelation chapter 10. more balance on the quote brother Branham said I'm God's voice to you he showed how the Seven Seals were revealed to brother Branham but also in the Seven Seals series we see brother Ram's humanity and times God had to correct him I love when Brother Kyle uses Philippians 2 and says let the mind that was Christ be in you and Brother Kyle correctly emphasized how Philippians 2 is speaking of the Mind of a servant so Brother Kyle is saying let the mind of a servant be in you that's what we need more preaching about how we can be better servants there's a great section called screen time section that emphasizes Godly Family Life a health section on taking care of your body and encouragement to take care of our physical bodies as well as our spirits and of course make sure our souls are baptized with the Holy Ghost in movement 5 or chapter 5 the title is a few attempts to land Brother Kyle encourages Godly mentorship and he gives a touching tribute to his father-in-law he reminds us Jesus is the principal theme of Our Lives and how we're supposed to have a Mystic walk with god with everything filtered through the Bible that's such an important statement I really enjoyed that section he shows how salvation is Jesus alone then Kyle says why he is staying with the message on pages 206 and 207. Brother Kyle gives a few more disclaimers trying to help the reader understand that he is not a heretic but he's a humble follower of Jesus Christ and doing what brother random said rightly dividing the word of Truth proving All Things by the scripture being careful how we listen to brother Branham as he told us and he cares do you care in 1963 Brother Kyle said he was calling us to stay in our churches as long as our churches were healthy churches I like the section called what is the next step and he says the next step is the same as the first step follow him or follow Jesus Christ the word there's a great section called for the children's sake what will we do with all the miners in other words all the minor topics that surround the message and quotes from Brother Branham he said we've got to decide what did this Fellowship on but of course he encourages having Fellowship as much as possible with the love of Jesus Christ there's another great section on without current revelation he said without that revelation we live in a glare which is what brother random warned us about we can't live in the glare of Brothers Ministry we've got to walk in the light we've got to have a personal experience with Jesus Christ ourselves this statement by Brother Kyle reminded me of a church age Book quote where brother Brandon said God doesn't give a different Revelation than he originally did but he gives us more information about the same Revelation I believe that to be true I believe God is doing that now he's not giving us different Revelations than brother Branham he's giving us more information about the same Revelations and then Brother Kyle used a good quote about the final climax being the rapture and yet brother Branham isn't here so God called brother Branham off the scene before the final climax in other words the final great event of the Gentile Church ages Is Yet To Come and yet brother Brandon's not here but we've got the same Revelation that brother Branham had by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ so I'd like to play that quote now in the ending section of brother Kyle's book I love how he quoted Colossians chapter 1 verse 27 the main emphasis of this book is being born again being baptized with the Holy Ghost Christ in you the hope of glory and that I think it's very fitting the last quote Brother Kyle uses in the entire book is the quote from Brother Branham where he went beyond the curtain of time and the millions screamed out were resting on that brother random's followers are resting on the fact that brother Branham preached what Paul preached which is the holy word of God the revelation of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote from Brother Branham and then that Vision the Lord me some time ago when those and millions when at one speaking to me said uh you'll be judged first for the gospel you preached I said I preached the same thing Paul is and the rest of them and all those millions of voices screamed out we are resting on that today that was it right in closing friends I hope this book review has been a blessing friends you can listen to this book for free on Kyle's YouTube channel and there's other ways to listen to it as well different websites he uses again brother Kyle did not ask me to do this book review I felt led to the Lord to do it because I loved his purpose behind writing his book there's so many reasons to read this book that I thought I would share it with my viewers one great reason is to draw closer to God you redeem your time by spending your time thinking about the things of God the Bible says draw an eye to God and He will draw an eye to you another reason is to grow in Grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ I was going to say it earlier but I'll say it now there were so many quotes in this book that I was reminded of that I had forgotten about and they're so helpful in finding balance on certain topics and also I discovered numerous quotes I never heard before so I'm very thankful to Brother Kyle for writing this book all the time that he invested into it it's a great blessing to have this book because it points us to Jesus Christ if you want to contact Brother Kyle he said please email me if you have a question I would do my best to help or at least to listen Kyle morton7 gmail.com and now friends we'll bring it close to the video if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me by email God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
