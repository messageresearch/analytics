here i'd like to look at prove all things one more time i think i can finish today if the lord will help me and then lord willing tonight i'd like to look at uh blessings and cursings tonight it's quite a a huge subject in the bible and i've been uh looking on numerous websites i'm sorry yeah listening to numerous sermons and um it's a huge subject i'd like to look at that tonight by god's grace i'm really excited about that message just because it's kind of feels kind of fresh it feels kind of new it basically just boils down to uh reaping and sewing many times so we'll look at that you know whatever you sow that's what you reap so i'm just really excited about that one by god's grace um there's a lot of scriptures today i think i've uh and there's so many to go to why don't we just go to colossians two we'll just start there i mean there's many places as i said i'd like to finish this uh debate here as far as going over it i hope it's okay i've got a lot of good feedback on it different people listening and around the around the nation i guess a couple people at least around the nation and it helps me like this is where i'm at church and i you know this is one area where i've really grown had to grow in the lord to kind of address some of these questions about brother branham i never knew before before i just avoided them but uh doing this debate it's forced me to face them face to face and try to do what the bible says search the scriptures diligently right each day whether these things are so and i found their so amen the bible teachings are so the brother brethren have a human side certainly did moses have a human side no doubt abraham how about us do we have a human side that we're not always proud of certainly but i i said i told my family last night i said this is one area where i've really grown in the grace of the lord i've seen how much grace god had on brother branham but probably more so me right you put your own self in there wow god has had a lot of grace on me as well because i fall short of god's glory so i appreciate everybody's support and i hope this will be a blessing here today let's let's go to colossians two we'll just read verses one two and three uh the question we'll finish today lord willing it was the trinity question i asked our brother about but uh just for a scripture the godhead is a mystery therefore it's not um it's not a salvation issue it's a mystery issue according to the scriptures colossians 2 i'll read 1 and 2 and then we can all read verse three together so let me read one and two for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts i'm sorry that their hearts might be comforted so paul was burdened that the the saints hearts were a little bit wavering right he wanted them to feel comfort being knit together in love he wanted the saints in in their churches to feel like their hearts were connected and the only way that can be is if we all care for the same things right our greatest care our greatest love should be jesus christ amen that's how our hearts are knit together right they're sewn together they're they're bonded together by the love of christ being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding see god wants us to understand exactly what he's doing with our lives right he wants to understand what what jesus wants to do with the bride to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ notice he didn't say the holy ghost because god's not three persons those are not three separate titles for three separate persons they're all titles to the one self-same person let's read verse three together one two three in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge how many want treasure from god amen there's one place for it it's in christ amen let's have one more word of prayer you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto god heavenly father there's something about this name this name of jesus christ the lord jesus christ we know there's many jesuses in mexico texas or spain but there's only one lord jesus christ thank you lord that there is a name above all names that's the name we honor that's the name we praise that's the name we worship today the lord jesus christ so lord come in your strength and your power meet the needs of the saints today father we're glad to be in your house and let the holy spirit just control this atmosphere lord meet you in every heart be obedient to the atmosphere of the holy ghost we thank you for the song special we thank you for all the songs brother amen and the musicians lord god now just let me do my part lord to get out of your way let the holy ghost speak today in jesus christ's name the saint said amen god bless you is being seated praise god uh so we'll go to this here and uh i studied on this all day yesterday uh the morning and then this morning i studied on the blessings and curses so i'm just asking the holy spirit to remind me of all that i studied yesterday so but god is good before i start i just have one apology i got to make so this week i received a email from uh people that are supporting rod bergen and believe the sign and i i made uh a false statement so i need to apologize about that to you as well um so let me references okay so brother rod left his message church because of child abuse and i said something wrong about it i said it was never taken to the law but apparently it was and i don't know for sure so this this individual representing um the brother rod i i debated emailed me this week and said i said something wrong so i said i'm sorry that i said i said at the moment what was the best of my knowledge so at this point i still don't know for sure but i do want to apologize if i shed any light on the situation that was negative towards brother rod he and i of course disagree bitterly but brother man tells us we need to have love even if we disagree bitterly with somebody because love is the greatest force in the universe and you can't help anybody unless you love them so i do want to apologize i'm so apparently ever you know believe the sign is watching all my sermons that's good i hope that's a blessing to them praise god it's these are things i got to just preach like i said i know people need to hear these things because it's a question in many's mind you know some people church they can just go like this they can say i don't have any questions i just believe the message and some people are genuinely that way they don't care but some people are inquisitive some people want answers to questions i'm that kind i like to know i put it off for a while you know for like eight years but you know in the meantime i was i could answer some of those questions i made a document i remember i shared it with the albion church and i had a document and i watched all the the youtube videos of believe the sign and i had a response to all of them and i shared it with i remember the brother newmer not dominic but his other brother i can't remember his name right now fine brother he still goes to the church up there uh but anyways i've always had uh a desire to know i'm that kind of a person i like to have answers the bible said a pastor's got to be ready to teach and so i want to be ready to teach if anybody had a question on those things um and so again i want to offer apology to brother rod i didn't mean to give any negative slant on you so apparently there was a child abuse case and we all condemn all child abuse we all do and the church said amen no matter which church we don't side with the church we side with the word amen but the thing is we don't know i don't know i wasn't there okay so i just want to say that in love apparently there was apparently someone took it to the law but they couldn't do anything about it and that's a shame all abuse is always wrong all the time all right so let's get started here i just want to start with that by god's grace so um let's finish up wednesday night i don't know if you saw wednesday night but on wednesday night i showed how brother branham said the blood didn't save you remember that but then he said later the blood does save you so i started with that example to show you that we have to rightly divide everything amen right if there's any question we have a duty to do that and church uh you know brother man may i don't know why brother random said that but just for a moment let's take the other side can you imagine how somebody who's against brother graham they could take that one quote where brother brahm said the blood doesn't save you and see how they can make us out to be a cult you see that but yet maybe he read something maybe he had a slip of the tongue a slip of the mind and he just said it wrong but you see how people can take they can take quotes and you can listen to it on the tape and make us look like some kind of a cult like oh you don't believe in the blood you don't believe the blood saves you that's the only thing that did save me was the blood of jesus christ right amen and god's grace to let me believe it amen amen because we're saved by grace through faith it is a gift of god amen praise god but see church i can understand how people can take some quotes when a man makes his mistake like brother man made a mistake he's just a man we all make mistakes but i can see how people can take that and if they've got the wrong spirit if they don't search it out themselves they could come to a wrong conclusion and so it behooves us to be able to have we should have an answer ready right for the hope that lies within us praise god uh so uh i'm sorry getting back i said does god have three minds uh we showed on wednesday night um how god only has uh well there's a mind of god the invisible spirit but then there was the human mind of christ and we showed how the mind of christ was limited the human mind all right uh so we looked at that and uh lord willing i'll just hit a few more things about the godhead i preached on it pretty hard on wednesday that was a i hope you enjoyed that um the true giants of the faith i want to say this the true giants of the faith never taught three persons praise god some of the giants over the last 500 years like luther well maybe more than that not luther wesley uh all these saints yeah they might have believed in three persons but they were not the bible writers the bible writers never taught three persons right and so uh the real giant so like jesus right and the bible authors only taught strict monotheism and jesus preached there's only one god there's only one person praise god mark 12 29 hero israel the lord our god is one lord praise god and i love to say this about the godhead everything the bible says about the godhead we can say amen too amen they can't i don't think they can necessarily do that as far as i i don't know i don't know for sure uh but hebrews 1 3 says jesus is the image of god's one person so the invisible person has a visible image praise god now i want to just let you know this if you haven't watched the the debate when we're in the middle of this trinity debate the one brother and i love him he's a nice brother he he he kind of stops the debate and he says jesse are you a father i said yeah i said jesse he said jesse are you a pastor i said yeah jesse are you a son and i thought what's he he's trying to prove to me the godhead by using a the the same thing that we believe and i started smiling and he said that's how i that's how i see the godhead yet he's a trinitarian so he uses a modalistic argument which there's many titles to one person to try to convince me of the trinity so he uses a non-trinity argument to convince me of the trinity and rod stopped him and said no no that's a modalistic belief and he said he knew that he told rod he said no i know that he said i know i'm using a oneness argument he said but that's the only way i can understand god now isn't that something and i found that in my readings too even strict trinitarians they know god is one they know god just changes his mask but they use it whenever it fits them conveniently but when they want to say oh there's three persons that jesus baptism then they inject tritheism into that so they rotate from the truth to air from truth to error but we just stay with the truth praise god amen all right uh so i just thought it was so striking that they're trying to use uh oneness arguments to promote the trinity but you can't do that because it adds to the word of god now remember church we're not modalistic because modalistic makes every person totally equal i'm sorry motorism makes each of the manifestations totally equal well jesus's body human body was not equal to god it was a form of god but it wasn't equal to god so that's why someone asked you are you a modalist no but does god change his mask yes that's right but we are not modalistic by definition we're holy ghost filled i guess we'll just call it like that uh holy ghost fieldest i'm not sure how to say that we're not modalists we're a christianist or just adding that is on the end of the word uh and then but our brothers now he got the last word on it because uh i never got to respond if you ask the question you don't get the last word on it in the debate so he his last word was god died upon the cross not jesus or not uh not anything less and i disagree god's spirit did not die on the cross the god's image died on the cross because god's spirit could never die amen okay and so i and so i just disagreed on many things there uh and i just i wish i would emphasize this because the bible says if you add to the word god's gonna call you a liar in other words these people can be saved but on that day uh and when the books are read remember brother man said the books will be read the bible says you'll be judged by your works one of their works will be they lied about god but yet they'll still be saved because the bible says every man will be judged by his works those that are saved on the right hand of jesus those that are rejected on the left but as part of their testimony they'll be called a liar but church we'll have none of that praise god right because all of our sins are forgiven praise god amen they're under the blood of jesus christ they won't nobody be calling us a liar we're the bride of jesus christ amen because we already confessed them but they died these people many some of these people not all of them some of them will die and they'll be clinging to these lies that they know it's not the bible and so on judgment day it'll all be seen yes they were saved but they believe lies and they'll be judged they'll have to be judged by that so see we don't want to uh have any lies in our beliefs right we want we just want the truth of god praise god all right now uh yeah the theologians do the same thing whenever it's convenient they use tritheism three gods whenever they when it's convenient then they'll use our our understanding of god and you can't do that you can't rotate okay now like i said i'm going to try to go quick because we only had five questions for the debate so his fourth question to me was how can you justify god requiring the save like martin luther and john wesley to believe false doctrine like the like the trinity so actually his question was how how how can how can god require you to believe satanic doctrine to be saved because brother adam said the trinity is of the devil and it is right three persons is of the devil because it's a lie and so my reply i didn't just put it up here no i'm sorry i didn't put up there so let me just check my notes uh so my reply on number four was this uh i said i don't believe god requires anybody to believe false doctrine to be saved all god requires you to be saved is repentance because you're saved by grace through faith it is a gift and not of works lest any man boast and i use the thief on the cross he was casting rebukes in jesus face at the beginning while he's hanging on the cross but the holy spirit turned his heart the bible said he cast the same in jesus teeth the thieves also cast the same in his teeth and all that jesus required was for him to say sorry and recognize that jesus was innocent and they said remember me lord in your kingdom and jesus said you'll be with me in paradise praise god so i said that's all that's required is repentance for salvation and i said as for messengers of the trinity god doesn't save by the godhead doctrine he saves by grace through the blood right and i just i went on to show how the bible says there had to be restoration so the church ages had to lose revelation right the saints lost some revelation because they had to battle the depths of satan so as satan went to the very depths the saints would lose revelation but then god would restore praise god he would he would begin reforming in martin luther and john west and john wesley was the age of the open door there was never a greater missionary age than john wesley so god was restoring praise god but the bible said there must come a restoration praise god and so we're glad to be a part of it how many know that's scriptural restoration is a great part of this day amen and then i said i said brother but there's a wise and foolish version for every age and went down through that there's always four kinds of vessels there's two saved two lost four kinds of ground it's clearly seen all through the scripture now his reply to me was i was implying a lot so my verses about wise and foolish were making a lot of implications and yet the whole time i only quoted the scripture it's funny how they can say all those accusations but it ain't true and all i'm using is scripture uh so he doesn't believe in wise and foolish virgins well then you don't believe in jesus right you don't believe in all of jesus said jesus said there's wise and foolish praise god now he's and he shared this quote i'll read it in just a moment he says but brother branham said if you anyone who doesn't believe the messenger perished and then he shared a quote uh brother branham a vision of the plum and apple trees both trees were found on the cross and then he he shares a quote that he thought contradicted it okay so let's go through the quote so let's read this here by god's grace probably this is proving his word here's the one about you're not saved unless you follow the messenger now remember the message of noah's time was only by faith not a scientific proven but today the message is according to the word of god and scientifically proven elijah come first doing miracles not doing any preaching just going from place to place doing miracles the next time he come in the form of john the baptist he came doing no miracles just preaching and the third time he comes there's both miracles and preaching see how it is watch how in the continuity the scriptures run we just could spend plenty of time on that but we won't we'll admit it because i believe you get the idea how many got the idea in other words the elijah anointing it manifests differently each time you've got to look to the word to see how it manifests now he did that in the age just as he did in all ages and like he will do just as he promised to do god promises anything then he comes down and proves his word to be right all that believe all that believed the message of that age come in and was saved so it will it be in any age all who did not believe the message and the messenger perish now he's talking about noah if you disbelieve noah's message were you saved you're lost lost but what type was that that was the type of the what tribulation yeah so this is speaking of not soul perishing but body perishing right because we know there's going to be souls in the tribulation who have to die in the tribulation their bodies perish but they'll be saved on the judgment day so it depends how you apply the quote right in noah's day anyone who rejected noah died physically okay could there be soul saves and from nose i don't know looks like they're all lost because jesus was preaching to the souls that were in prison and rebuking them for not believing noah noah seems a type the foolish virgin right but we know there's other ages of course where people can perish physically but they can be saved right they can be saved spiritually praise god just like the fifth seal so all those saints uh that died in the holocaust six million six million souls church don't forget that six million died in this in the world war ii in the holocaust but the jesus promises them white robes right if they lived true to all that they knew so they may have perished physically they rejected christ they rejected brother man's message they rejected everything but yet they can still be saved and brother man said the fifth seal is thus saith the lord okay now i'm going to skip that because he just goes on to say more about it now later in the same sermon church he says lot escaped so he says again uses the foolish virgin escapes okay so that quote has to be balanced with the other one any who did not believe the message and the messenger perished okay so lot didn't follow abraham but yet he escaped right he escaped destruction uh so his his soul was saved in that case his body was saved because he typed the foolish virgin okay so i just feel like our brother misunderstands the quotes now here's a quote they asked brother brand what about people that believe in the lord and and not the way you preach the man said they don't have to believe this they don't have to believe the way i preach it see for the last day message will they be saved yes if they believe the lord praise god hallelujah and then he says this he says if they disagree and say i don't believe the word i don't believe this is right i don't believe in the baptism of the holy ghost that shows where they're headed for the tribulation period and that's what all these one works of grace believers believe did you catch that i didn't say three works of grace i called them one works of grace or one work of grace rather that's what our precious friend rod and many denominations they they believe there's only one work of grace and then you've got everything done they believe as soon as you come out of egypt you're in the promised land no sir you've only come out of egypt only you've only got one word there's two more works that must be done praise god there's two more works of a proving ground of your faith do you really want to possess the land do you really have faith in god's promise amen will you will you persevere and possess the land amen that's right see they don't believe in the baptism they just believe in one work of grace he says shows where they're headed for the tribulation period but those who that's what jesus taught right those who didn't have the oil tribulation those who can accept the word in his phone it's not me preaching it because as the bible says so those who accept is free because the word's already been judged so see what they do church they take one quote against another and they try to make brother brahm contradict himself now we know there's times he does contradict himself but we got to take it back to the word praise god all right now the vision of the apple and plum trees i'm not going to read all of it because it's it's from 1933 apparently from what i understand it brother saw the vision on the same morning that they laid the cornerstone for the tabernacle apparently if i read this right so he's talking about the morning i laid the the cornerstone in this tabernacle i was thinking of this great time the lord was going to give me a tabernacle so can i just dramatize brother brandt was excited they're going to go lay the cornerstone oh it's the morning our church is going to be established and brother man thought now i've got a church i've got a tabernacle where i can preach and what the angels say the angel comes to correct him he said i was so happy standing behind the boat and saying god how good you are to give me a tabernacle and at that time the angel lord spoke to me and said but this is not your tabernacle see what they're still trying to do today they're trying to make it brother branham's tabernacle it was never his to begin with the angel said that and they say they believe every word he said i believe the angel praise god and brother branham praise god it was never his because he was he had a different ministry he had a prophetic ministry and he was going to do the work of an evangelist in other words he had multiple gifts he had to minister he was so excited oh i finally got a church i finally got a pulpit i finally got a place to preach and the angel said it's not your tabernacle and then he had this vision now in the vision it's a little a little long but let's just read it he's taking me up in the spirit set me in a grove so trees and way down the grove was two rows of trees just setting level about 20 feet 30 feet tall and they looked like fruit trees and were uh in great big green buckets i'm gonna skip down a little bit so i can see okay and then he says uh and i notice in my right hand to my left hand there was an empty bucket on either side and i said what about these and he said you're to plant them so i pulled a limb from the tree to my right and placed it in the bucket on the right side and a limb on the left hand and placed in the bucket on the left side quickly they growed all the way to the skies and he said hold out your hands and gather the fruit thereof so they grew up and he had to gather the fruit and in one hand fell a great yellow apple mellow and ripe and the other hand fell a great yellow plum mellow and ripe and he said eat the fruit thereof because it's pleasant and i ate from one from the other very delicious you know the vision it's wrote in one of the books i think life story prophet visit south africa and just then i held up my hands and was shouting the glory of god and all of a sudden that pillar of fire come down over the tops of the trees and the roar and the lightnings flash and the winds blew real hard and the leaves began to blow him from the trees and i looked way down here's to the shape of this tabernacle the way it sets now so this is i think 1962. and at the end where the pulpit would be there were those trees and those three trees taking the shape of three crosses i noticed both plums and apples were gathered in clusters around the middle cross and i ran real fast screaming to the top of my voice and fell down upon this cross or by the cross threw my arms around it amen and the winds began to shake and the fruit from the cross had fell all over me and i was so happy just rejoicing i said eat the fruit thereof because it's pleasant amen in other words we should rejoice in any soul saved praise god amen in fact the most people brother bang that have told me i've helped lead them to the lord they go back to denominations but according to this we should rejoice as long as they are real as long as they're a real fruit of god amen as long as they're saved we should rejoice in any fruit break hallelujah because he interprets it later it says these are oneness and trinitarian souls that are saved not at the tabernacle right they were outside in other denominations and then this circling of fire caught out the harvest is ripe and the laborers are few he said now when you come to yourself again read ii timothy 4. let's read that so after he sees the vision of the of the the the tree plants the trees they grow up he catches all the fruit then he goes to the cross and there's more fruit there from those those trees those souls and i charge you therefore before god the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead as at his appearing in his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long suffering and doctrine for the time will not will come when they will not endure sound doctrine no that's not like today they can't even do or endure a simple teaching right from scripture from doctrine but after their own lust shall they heat to themselves teachers having itching ears like one of these women after the debate she emailed me and said oh no it's okay for women to cut their hair because uh in the nazarite valley how do you remember the nazerite vow it gives a woman a right to cut her hair at the end of the nazerite vow i said that's true i said but show me one woman that ever did do the nazirite vow can you think of one i can't think of one woman with a nazrite vow that never ever cut the hair and i asked her this brother bang i said i said is that why you cut your hair at the end of a nazrite vow is that why all those millions of christian women who cut their hair is that why they cut their hair because god fulfilled the vow and now they're they're rejoiced because god answered their prayer and i didn't hear anything back because it's a lush it's a lush for the things of the world right they want teachers uh that will itch their own ears right that turn away from the truth and be turned into fables see they don't want to get in dedication to god they don't want to fast before god they don't want to make a promise to god they don't want to be honest with god they don't want to diligently serve god amen see when i brought it down to what the word says if you're in a deep dedication of a bow and they they did it then they could do it but we don't see any examples of that in scripture and brotherhood tells in the new testament he said it is a woman's nazarite vow to not cut their hair he said so we so the women keep the vow to keep a separation and show that they're under the full headship of husband and then christ and god amen so my man shows us the real spiritual meaning of it just as samson grew out of his hair he had the power that was the type of the church right to let the hair grow and just let it grow as long as they didn't cut off the things of god amen as long as they didn't cut off any of the word god's power would be with them praise god amen they shall turn away their ears from truth say they'll stop listening to the preaching and shall be turned to fables they'd rather believe a fairy tale about god but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry see that's what we're doing right now proving all things amen praise god now probably in 1963 standing in the gap he says all wrote in the books then years ago i seen i never crossed up the oneness in trinity i stood between them and planted these trees and they were the only two trees that had fruit all the trees grew up about 30 and stopped these went plum into heaven look at that they went into heaven the trees of truly oneness went into heaven broke off the same branch one on one side one or the other broke them you remember the vision it's wrong books and my life story and all and they went plum up to heaven quickly and he said hold out your hands for the fruit and then i found the same fruit in the cross when i run down there and he said do the work of an evangelist make full proof of your ministry and the time will come when they'll not ensure endure sound doctrine don't quit them then keep going so brother bram knew these people are not going to receive all that i'm preaching but some of them will be saved praise god there will be some genuine ones glory that recognize the healing ministry praise god they can rejoice in the healing ministry and maybe they'll get saved just because they recognize there's a gift of divine healing brother man said don't stop going to the god don't stop keep going to them just try to save them because there's wise and foolish go out and try to save the foolish as well that all come to my mind he said and so then brother rod brings up this quote uh i think i got it on here let me see so the brotherhood has a vision so this is what they're trying to do they're trying to say see brother man had a vision and trinity and oneness were saved but then here and what in anointed ones at the end time he says they're lost so the brother man contradicts himself and i said no i said you got to take the quotes back to the word of god i believe that vision was right brother fang you believe that i believe trinity how many eternity can be saved absolutely if not then luther wasn't saved i believe oneness can be saved how many believe oneness can be saved they got the wrong you know they make jesus his human body fully god that's not right you know god can't die god the holy spirit can't die and so i told brother ryan i said i said this anointed ones quote we're going to read here i said you've got to take this back to the word and brother man may mean something but it just doesn't come out the right way he may mean the truth but then it just doesn't come out and so it sounds wrong i don't know for sure i wasn't there i can't ask him about it the brother is talking about faith what is faith it's a revelation of the will of god churches today don't even believe in revelation he says i'm going to skip ahead because i think you understand the quotes and he talks to a preacher the preacher said we don't accept revelations he said then you have to refuse jesus christ for he is the revelation of god amen he said and unless you see it you're lost now that may be true for some people uh it depends what he means it's like a muslim if a muslim clearly says jesus is not uh the son of god and then they blaspheme every christian they're lost they didn't do any good to any christian there's no hope for them at all they'll be lost because they rejected that revelation and jesus said except you believe that i am he you die in your sins he's the revelation of god the spirit of god revealed in human form if you can't believe that you're lost you put him a third person second person or any other person besides god you're lost so see see how they can they can twist this and make it sound but that may not be what brother random meant okay so that he says except you believe that i'm he you'll die in your sins of revelation now remember the the writer of you know john in first john said anyone that says jesus did not come in the flesh is the antichrist right so we know it's an antichrist spirit that will deny that the son of god even came in the flesh oh god didn't come in the flesh but the holy spirit says yes god did come in the flesh the word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us amen so that may be what brother is talking about people say well muslims say well jesus is just a man no he's more than a man his flesh was different it was the word made flesh it didn't have a sin nature praise god see that's what we believe so see they're trying to quote or place this quote against the vision and say they contradict well they might or they might not it depends what he means but i told him this i said okay i said brother i said i take that back to the scripture i said i used colossians 2 i said the godhead is a mystery the godhead is not the salvation doctrine praise god because if you do that then martin luther wasn't safe because he believed in three persons john wesley see what you get into see man you get pretty deep in smith wigglesworth raise the dead and yet he's going to hell because he's a trinitarian and god you know he's a servant of god and larkin larkin was a three-person uh teacher so there's there's so much to take into consideration but we cannot be afraid perfect love casts out all fear praise god if there's a question there must if there's if there's a lot of questions and it looks all foggy then it must be a revelation and it is it is and we've got the answer we got the revelation of the mystery of god amen it's one god in three manifestations all right let me keep going here i'm gonna do it on time pretty good okay my so my fourth question is you stated brother branham is a liar but i've never heard you share any real proof because i was trying to say you're only assuming and jumping to conclusions based upon your own opinions and so he said um so these are the examples he gave in 1953 brother braham said he went to confucius's grave muhammad's grave buddhist and he said he said that was a lie but he gave no proof there was absolutely no proof and that was my whole point what proof do you have he didn't show any there was none the vatican brothers he went to the vatican and saw vacaris filet day on a three a triple crown he said that's a lie i said well show me some proof he had no proof he said brother man told a story of eaglets on their mother eagle's wings and the eagle would take him up and brother the brother brother rod said that's scientifically impossible i said well there's no proof there's no proof and then he gave many more stories of brother branham and no proof that i saw now the donnie morton when i need to research that i haven't researched that brother ram apparently told donnie morton a young boy that he'd be healed and they say he died so i got to search that one out i will i just didn't have time to do that yesterday i'll do that by god's grace because some of these other ones i did search out okay so my response was i don't believe brother branham was a habitual liar he admitted when he lied to the irs he brother ham admitted he exaggerated sizes of crowds um and i said newspapers and government papers can be wrong like if you watch the pattern of the exodus they show how egypt has no record of moses but yet we know moses went to egypt and i said brother i have lots of questions but there's no way for me to know i said there are conspiracies how about jfk's assassination remember when trump said he was going to release those papers and he had to do a 180 because the government wouldn't let him do it we still there's still no really no one really knows there are real conspiracies out there right there are and so you can't trust the government right they're not the absolute i said what about 9 11. i told you on wednesday i met brothers from yvonne karen church that were there when the towers fell and they say it wasn't the planes were real but they had explosions set up and you can hear it on the video they have explosions to bring that those buildings down that wasn't just a plane that was planned out but they they make it today like oh the plane took that those that was down what are you going to believe you believe cnn or can leave the people that were there you can't make newspapers and uh these things uh absolutes so i said ultimately it comes down it's your word against brother branham's word so he went on his second response he claimed brother branham pretended to speak in tongues that's not true i studied that one yesterday and then he says he says see this is proof jesse i said it's not proof because brother adam uh oh yeah here's the let me read the quote so here's the quote brother rams giving discernment in 1959 and he said there's a little woman there suffering with high blood pressure she's not from here she's a finn she's from finland if you believe sister you receive your healing joomla raise up to your feet and accept your healing and be made well god bless you ketos jesus hallelujah what was i saying if thou can't believe so rod reads this and he says brother ram was pretending to speak in tongues when he said jumila ruma and kitos that's not what brother brown was doing brother ram had been to finland and he knew those words okay he was not claiming to speak in tongues he was emphasizing what was i saying if thou can't believe so so brother man was preaching on if thou can't believe so let me uh go ahead here again yeah here we go so earlier i'm just going to go quickly through here earlier in the quotes here bubblegum was preaching and they said if thou can't believe radio audience so he's trying to raise their faith this is what he's trying to get them to do he says it again if thou canst believe do you not know these people i've never seen them in my life what is it friends now don't go thinking something mysterious it's the promise of god jesus said so brother ahm was twice teaching on if thou can't believe he wasn't pretending to speak in tongues the next day brother adam tells a story about speaking to a woman who her brother branham in her own language as took place at pentecost so it wasn't the finished woman plus brother ram never told the finnish woman her name so brother rod reads this quote and brother rod thinks that brother brown was pretending to speak in tongues but she couldn't understand me because she was from another country a finished woman and then the holy spirit to show he's no respected person spoke through here called her name and told her to bless god spoke in a language i didn't know and called the woman give who she was something to the lord's blessing upon her in finnish language i don't even know english let alone finish so goes to show that god speaks in all the languages and all human beings belong to him now brother brahm later admits in when he was talking about this it wasn't exactly a finished woman so i can again see how the brother rod confuses these quotes brother man says how do we hear every man in our own tongue where we were born god is still god now when i begin to say those words within myself she didn't understand it at all the holy spirit speaking english was interpreting her to spanish so brother and says i'll be preaching right in english and they'll hear in spanish praise god you'll be talking in english and somebody can hear it in mong right or some other language that's what brother rahm's talking about now look what he says next and i just want to put it there in blue so you can see and if we could only grasp that this afternoon his goodness to that little woman finnish or whatever she was so brother rand mixes these women up okay earlier he said it was the finished woman that i spoke in another language to but then he said i'm not sure whoever she was he says now many times we see happen in the foreign countries i'll be standing speaking it'll turn right back around and use my language to call people in their names and everything just like it does here in their own native language that's what i call pentecost i believe it's the holy spirit all right so here's my conclusion again they jumped to conclusion brother ram never called the finished woman's name so it wasn't her story brother adam was referring to he just mixed them up because he said a finish or another woman there's three women he called their name in the prayer line and my opinion it was mrs allen so let me read that one just so you you got it but i don't know for sure he's discerning he says here look this way just a moment right over this direction i see a little woman i do not know her but she's praying she's wearing a little flat hat she's suffering over here over her stands that light she's suffering something's wrong with her eyes and ears i'm afraid the woman's not catching who i'm speaking of lord god say something or do something that she won't miss it her name is mrs allen all right do you believe that you'll be healed then rise and be made well in the name of the lord jesus now be thankful that's the way to do it okay so i believe this is the one brother i was referring to this is a woman she she couldn't hear for some reason uh but then brother he prays god do something that she won't miss it he calls her name and i believe this is the one where the woman uh brother man was speaking in english and she heard it in her native language okay i know that's a that's a deeper one here so let me move on here i just want you to see that look how close to this church look how close it is and it boils down to this if there's a question we got to keep reading and the church said if you have a question and you're not sure if there's a supposed contradiction keep reading but that's what people don't want to do right they don't want to keep studying they already got a predetermined idea right brother they're going to persecute brother branham and everybody the message so they stop reading they jump to a conclusion but if you keep reading brother graham said it could have been finished or it could have been another woman and brother i never said i was speaking and i was speaking an unknown tongue they have a uh article on their website that says brother rand pretends to speak in tongues nonsense nonsense if you keep reading right if you say in the message if you keep reading he says it wasn't that i was speaking in tongue he said i was speaking in english and the woman heard in her native language so it's totally wrong and if they would they would have got it right if they just keep reading so this is the next one i'm going to email the brother okay so then he can see it hopefully he'll repent of that one so my his last question to me uh i've experienced no love in message churches now let's let's take a little bit of uh let's take a little uh examination of our lives and make sure we love one another here and the people that have left us amen because if you really love them you'll try to go after them or at least pray for them you might not church let me say like you might not feel led to go after them because you might be a little anxious about them attacking you or but somebody should have the spirit of meekness to try to bring them back to god right and you should desire for the you should let me say like this you should desire the best for them no matter what they say no matter if they persecute you and call you out and make fun of you then you should still desire the best for them not hell right no not hell but heaven you should still desire heaven for them so this was his last question for me how can be the seven church age messenger if there's so much corrupt fruit among his followers so my reply and i just said i'm sorry if you haven't found love in the messed churches then those people haven't obeyed the bible but i said i wasn't there in your situation i can't speak for others i wasn't a witness of your problems and i said this i said i hope and i said i believe there's some people in that church that have divine love right there's got to be some but i use galatians 6 let's go to galatians 6 1 2 then you can read it and see it for yourself because church we never know if someone leaves us again or if someone comes in and leaves us we need to have divine love for them there's no excuses right you got to have divine love if you don't it shows you're not born again you can't even love your enemies that's exactly what jesus and stephen did that was the proof they had the love of god that they could love their enemies that was their dying wish right forgive them lay it not to their charge that was their dying wish and that was paul's desire in romans 10 he said i wish that i could be cursed for my brethren's sake well look at that tonight can you imagine that wanting a curse on you so other people could go to heaven can you imagine it that's the kind of love paul had he couldn't do it but he said god if only if i could be cursed that these people could be saved i don't want to see them lost that's sincerity to me church that's really god's divine love galatians 6 1-2 now isn't this interesting church look at chapter five what's in there the fruit of the holy spirit paul's saying either walk in the flesh if you walk in the flesh you can do the things of the flesh right but if you walk in the spirit you'll do the fruits of the holy spirit and then he starts right after that he says brethren if a man be overtaking the fall ye which are spiritual see you got to be spiritual when you try to correct somebody restore such and one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted so church it is bible command you need to be cautious when you try to correct somebody because that spirit might jump on you that's what happened with a lot of these message people uh sister naomi they rejoice oh we we brought hundreds of people out of the message now what's happened is these people that come to correct them that spirit that was on these people that have left it jumps on them and they see all the human mistakes of brotherhood what about all the right bible teachings what about all the healings and what what about all the good things don't look at the bad things what if somebody only looked at your bad things in your life what would you say oh you say oh please don't look at the look at the good things the bad things under the blood look at what god did that was good in my life nobody wants you to just look at their bad things see you got to be careful when you go to people you got to wait for the right time in the season because you might be tempted and uh tested as well verse two bury one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ so if someone's overtaken you have a burden to see them delivered right how many have a burden to see somebody delivered from their sins or anything that's the law of christ when you see somebody fall short you want to try to help them out now it's going to be their choice ultimately right brother man you can't how many people we wish we could force them to be delivered but if they love that spirit and worship that spirit they're not going to be delivered but you can try to bring correction to them if you got the love of god if you're walking the spirit and if you're called to do it but you have to be called to do it verse three for if a man thinks himself to be something when he's nothing he deceives himself so see if you're just going there i'm gonna i'm gonna blast that person you're not even trying to help them like the man said people have to feel your love first before you can help them they have to know that you love them first verse 4 let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not another see it's good to rejoice oh other people have good testimonies but see you need to be you and i need to be obedient so we can rejoice look what god has done in my life praise god and just rejoice and give god praise verse 5 for every man shall bear his own burden so see ultimately we have our burdens we must bear and if you're led by the holy spirit then you can go help somebody who's overtaken they're weak they've stumbled over the stumbling stones satan not a place they're stumbling with black whatever it is but you got to have compassion to bear their burden but don't forget you've got to bear your burdens too it's an absolute command for those who are spiritual but you got it it's got to be the right time in season two like remember brother randy remember randy bernstein he's coming here in a couple weeks praise god he was away from the message for four years wouldn't call me back i called him a couple of times and he was watching simon's facebook page right there was a time and season simon knew he was watching so he said we had all tremendous revival services and we did brother brooks and i preached those meetings cam cam church it was so powerful people got healed and delivered and everything and as soon as he posted it it's like he said it's like pentecost randy come back at the right time in season see so it's you gotta figure out how to deal with that you got to be led by the holy spirit in each case i tried to reach out i never got a call back that's okay keep trying keep trying go to them if you're if they're over and taken over taking a fall go to them and try to relieve their heavy burden now i said another reason people didn't go to your brother rod is because some of them are not born again i said few there be that find it this this clearly says only the spiritual can help those that are fallen the carnal believers cannot help them right carnal people that sin and message churches and aren't spiritual they can't help anybody because they can't even help themselves it's got to be somebody's spiritual society amen this is what you and i and your wife that's what we've been talking about when people fight against us it we have to be led by the holy spirit and it's got to be we have to be spiritual recognizing this is a battle not with them but with spiritual place or spiritual wickedness in high places and we got to be very cautious and we got to have love we got a desire to see them delivered we got to have love but we got to watch ourselves too that we don't go into it trying to fight but we go in at trying to take their burden off them lay this down lay this down and it's got to be at the time the right time in season but if people aren't born again they're not spiritual so they won't do any good if they try to help them out they'll just go attack them or join them right they'll either attack them or join them and i told by the right i said many are afraid rod and i said i was i admitted on the debate it's got over uh four thousand five thousand views now i'm probably exaggerating it's probably like 4 500. but i said i i was afraid to debate you because i never studied a lot of these questions i'm just being honest that's one thing church i want to be honest before god and man i want to be honest that's why i apologize at the beginning i'll just not i'm just being honest i never studied them i said i had to wait for the time and season i said brother rod some people have the right not to go to you because the bible said if if someone's causing division avoid them see you got some you got the right not to go to them but the people that are spiritual that means led by the holy spirit not everybody's led by the holy spirit to bring reconciliation many times it is the pastor's job many times then you go to them but i still think we should go to our brothers in love right because galatians 6. i said brother brandon's message has not failed miserably because i see it working in my life i see it working in those around me i said in all my mistakes i found restoration with people if they wanted it in other words i went and confessed my sin and they forgave me but i said brother also the prophecy says there will be little love in the end time because iniquity abound the love of many shall wax cold evil seducers will wax worse and worse because of rejecting love many message church members go into iniquity now here's his reply he said jim jones the guy that went to guyana and killed 900 people with the kool-aid he said he was under obama's brother man's ministry i said i don't know about that i never heard of that he said leo mercer he was one of the tape boys was indicted in california for child abuse i've heard of that i can't prove it um joseph coleman and lee vale brother ram ordained both of them i don't know if he was ordained he baptized the veil i know he ordained joseph coleman these guys went off into some really crazy stuff uh and really hurt a lot of people and so his question for me was he said jesse why didn't god give brother around discernment of all these people my response was that's between god and brother branham and i just had this thought yesterday i was suddenly as brother rod my precious brother rebukes brother branham for lack of discernment then why didn't he have discernment for 40 years if the message was wrong see and i say that love they're attacking somebody for not having total discernment do you and i have total discernment over every situation where we can judge everything right no we don't let's be let's be honest and i said at the last supper 11 saints couldn't even discern judas's spirit only jesus could and he was the son of perdition why because he was doing it in secret right he was doing his sin in secret they couldn't see it they couldn't see the the bitterness or the the greed in his heart for money they couldn't see they couldn't see his deal when he slipped off and went to the temple and said let's make this deal because it was in secret but he had a nice religious iniquity right a iniquity mask on masking his iniquity rather and i said this i said how do you know right i said was brother vail or mercer maybe they were living true why brother branham was alive and maybe they fell later that's a possibility but i said i said don't look at the bad fruit i said look at the good fruit praise god right you if you want you can look at judas and say my look at that bad fruit gee what was wrong with jesus's ministry nothing was wrong with it i'll say it like this to me there's nothing wrong with our ministry praise god there's nothing wrong with it it's right with the word praise god that's my opinion and there's bad fruit around it well i'm doing all i can to try to get people to be connected to christ so the fruit is good fruit praise god because a good tree can only produce good fruit praise god when they're attached to the vine the life of jesus christ and jesus said it i said it's going to be a little flock it's prophecy there's only going to be some good fruit there's not going to be a ton of good fruit there's only going to be a little bit of fruit okay i'm trying to finish up so my final question for him was are you willing to admit three prophecies were spoken before the fact that's that's his big thing there's no prophecy spoken before the fact and so i gave him three for my video but man saw the usa church vision that was foretold smoking dancing cut hair immoral clothes i said brother man said no greater ministry to the gentiles than brother braham's gift and denominations won't return to apostolic ministry so his answer was no he said that's my plain answer no those were not prophecies before the fact i disagree i believe they were and his his reason was the cdc says 67 percent decline in smoking because my man talked about how the church would be smoking and he says see there's a decline in smoking the church is not a bunch of smokers but that's not what brother branham said well the ram never said the whole church would be smokers he just saw the church smoking dancing to rock and roll immoral he didn't say how many would be smokers and my opinion is they don't preach on it anymore how do you know because i went to a church where they didn't preach it anymore that's how i know they don't preach against it because they'll lose members right but aren't you glad you go to church where they preach and those evil spirits have to go amen i'm so thankful for that so we're going to say it by the samuels church by the brooks's church and now our church we preach and those spirits they're not allowed to stay here because they're cast out in jesus christ's name to those who believe now he said this and i used wendy as an example uh he said see that vision was wrong because he's brother said the asian church was a filthy church and he said see there's 266 million uh asian christians in 2015. and what did i say oh i said this i said i said overall the asian church is filthy i said i gave the hong kong example so wendy knows a lot of people that just they go to catholic church but they don't live it right sister yeah that's most people right that she knows that's just one little microcosm but if what the bible says is true there'll be very few that find it in asia right how many how many message churches in hong kong was there they're not even hong kong yeah that's two and how many millions of people in hong kong almost eight million there's two churches and there's some doctrinal questions we have about some of them i remember you said like with women and authority but god bless their hearts you know at least they're trying to serve the lord so i i just said i disagree brother most asians do not serve god well no 4.6 billion people in asia and he's saying 266 or million are believers that's not even one percent so to me that vision is right if you have 300 million people and not even one percent are really believers then i think brother bran's vision is right he said the american church was filthy he said the asian church was filthy most denominational churches are filthy and then he said no greater ministry to the gentiles his argument was brother ram is fading away and he said historians say fewer people were healed and reported god has done much greater things in the church than brother banner's ministry my response was all asia rejected paul so he was looking at the number brother man's numbers are going down well that doesn't that's normal when you're a real prophet of god the whole world doesn't repent right the whole world rejects you yeah so i wasn't talking about the number brother bang i was talking about the greater gift brother said there'll never be a greater gift to the gentiles so he didn't you don't understand the quote and i said brother brown's gift is clearly unmatched there's nothing that even comes close right next i'm almost done here i appreciate everybody's patience i just want to finish this today by god's grace it's been a long hard battle a lot of questions but god's given me many answers i appreciate you having patience with me and i said brother i said denominations will never come back to the word his response was all churches say this there's no way to prove it one way or other so my response was i said brother the apostolic fathers never called god three persons they only baptized using the lord jesus christ formula it's clear to me this prophecy is being filled which denomination do you see coming back to the word of god you don't see it and the other thing was all their leaders are becoming homosexual and married two three times i said this ain't returning to the bible word of god it's falling away it's getting worse right we know that okay so his reply to me was jesse has to disprove everything they have about brother brand to prove he's a prophet he says i've not shown any real proof of prophecies made before the fact but i disagree i believe i have and then we close so i'll close this in my closing i thanked everybody i said brother brown wasn't a scholar it's hard to remember all those details of visions when you get a hundred letters a week a hundred phone calls a day right you and you have to do sick calls all day there's no way you can remember all those details and i looked at him brother i said my youtube channel is expression of my love to you i've spent at least a thousand hours on that channel at least and the whole reason by the bang was to give people overseas teaching that i can't go preaching them because i want to take care of my family that was one of the reasons to give my family a chance that won't come to church give them a chance to hear the message so if you feel led to share my videos with your family do it just do it that's why i made it if you feel led right if you feel led and the third one was believe the signs started theirs in 2012 i started mine in 2013. because i thought if they're going to come against the message i'm going to show where the message is right so one of my first one of my first videos was women angels and women preachers because they said there's such a thing as women angels and i showed that to you a few weeks ago there ain't so i told him i said brother rod my youtube channel is an expression of my love to you i put a thousand hours in at least to show that i love him but what i really mean is i love the word of god and if i love the word of god then i love all my friends and my enemies i love jesus christ with all my heart and so at the end i cast my neck i said get saved repent you're filled with the holy ghost god will lead you to a message church then you'll uh faithfully gather more as you see that day approaching you'll pay your tithes you'll recognize your gifts you'll try to win souls you'll send missionaries and you'll love the lord your god with all your heart soul mind and strength amen amen and his last casting of his net was thanks to all he said go to my podcast fulfill this uh search the scriptures daily rather than be so go to my website that's fair that's what i did too i i gave my youtube channel that's fair he said examine all the evidence about brother brown that's what we do his conclusion brother braham is not a prophet his love compels him to go after message believers there's some true christians in the message he said some are not of course and then there's another oh then the host he's a message believer he said this is an important vital conversation either god sent a prophet or he didn't and he said hopefully we'll have more conversations i think the word of god proves clearly god had to send a prophet before the end time amen because of we needed restoration we needed our hearts turned back to the word of god i'm so glad my heart's been turned back to the apostolic fathers praise god amen and church as i said i'm happy to have more debates and more discussions hopefully i have more time to study for him too that'd be good i'd appreciate that and right before he closed that brother who left donnie reagan's church he stopped it it was such a sweet moment if you haven't watch it go to that mark it's so precious he said brother jesse i said i just want to tell you i admire you for your research he said i can feel your incredibly genuine faith and love of scripture and honesty i almost started crying because i thought wow my enemies are telling me they can feel my love for me or for them rather right they can feel my love for jesus his word and feel my love and so i said brothers i said i feel the same i said i love you with the love of jesus i said pray for me i'll pray for you because it's all about love that's what that's the only thing i can do to help people is to love them now here's a few follow up let's stay into our feet here look just one more that's the last one here's i wish i would have challenged a little more like this and maybe going forward we'll do this we'll see what the lord does i wish i would have challenged and said give me one scripture where god asked godly woman to cut her hair where god and she actually cut it because church what does it come down to we either got thus saith the lord or we don't like either god has god either has clear bible teachings or god contradicts himself i believe god is a god of no contradictions i wish i would have labored on uh we have five water baptism examples from acts can you show me one that was in the titles father son holy ghost i wish i want to challenge a little more on homosexuality this is a reprobate mind this is in other words this is insanity right homosexuality is literal mental insanity a reprobate mind god has given you up and said i'll give you over to believe a lie now of course people have been delivered out of that there's numerous people right brother that's with ryan maybe maybe he'll tell us about that when he comes i got to remind him and then i wish i would have challenged them on any other doctor musicians if you'll come by god's grace so i'm finished is everybody happy amen you're not half as happy as i am and i i don't know if you remember church but when i preached on the philippians series i got one more message on there the holy spirit struck me that day and paul said i was set as a defense for the gospel and i started preaching brother bang and i believe it i was born to defend the message that's my purpose in life to preach and as soon as i said that we started worshiping brother bang i got an email from their podcast saying we're coming back on we look forward to debating people and i'm here praising god and i look down and i get an email pop up oh they want to debate me now okay and i just preached that i was born to defend this message amen i've had numerous people say wow they were so amazed they thanked me there was the holy spirit that debated that man it was the holy spirit it was god's nature that debate of that person in church i hope now just like you i hope the seeds that i've sown have fallen onto good ground and i hope the holy spirit can start rooting up some of those weeds in these in these hearts of these men and women and they'll start saying oh this guy really has love this must be the word of god because they have love that is my desire church remember brother brown he was in at least three debates i don't know if you heard my message a few wednesdays nights ago by the bank he debated a person about tongues of the evidence second he debate debated a person on divine healing who said oh uh people can't be healed going to witch doctors and brother graham said they don't think it's a witch and they think it's god or them so they can be healed because god heals by faith that's that's really something i still can't understand it but i believe it and then brother said the holy spirit told me to go down it was him against 300 ministers in that cafe and he challenged him on water baptism and serpent seed and he said come to you he said one of you come stand before me and hold that bible and show me where i'm wrong he said as the quietest group you ever saw and then that was that was three that at least he participated in at least himself but then he went to support brother bosworth in 1950 at the houston coliseum and that's where the pillar fired jesus christ come down and took a picture with this prophet bless my heads for a moment here uh you know every time i say that i feel like i want the holy spirit to show me which thoughts from the message do you want me to remind the people though so we can pray about them how about divine love how about going to people that have i'll say like this ties in with tonight going to people that have hurt you face to face think about anyone you know that's overtaken in a fault and maybe you felt like you should go talk to them maybe not that was the first thought that came to me when i said let's close jesus the holy spirit will many times bring things from the serpent [Music] he which are spiritual we just take a moment and think about [Music] those of you who are walking in the holy spirit that means you're not doing the things of the flesh if we live in this mirrorless walk in the spirit if we do that you'll see brothers or [Music] sisters let's have just a moment of prayer and think to ourselves [Music] let's ask jesus christ say god let me be spiritual and do i need to go and help [Music] humility [Music] a soft answer [Music] um [Music] thank you for the word of god [Music] [Applause] [Music] you know we want to be open today [Music] spiritual knock on that heart [Music] all this can only be done if we're walking in the spirit when i pray for myself [Music] this [Music] stay with us guide us direct us if we're to take action sometimes lord we do avoid god guide us if we're supposed to take action we're the one that is [Music] i want to thank you [Music] because i had nothing to write about [Music] help me to learn how to love people instead of myself i just
