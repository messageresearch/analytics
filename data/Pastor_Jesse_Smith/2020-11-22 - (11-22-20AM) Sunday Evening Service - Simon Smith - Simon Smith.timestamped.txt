[35:50] let's go to
[35:56] uh first John 3:7
[36:47] okay all right sounds good praise the
[36:50] Lord um let's head to uh First John 3
[37:08] First John 3 verse
[37:11] 7 I read these scriptures by the grace
[37:13] of
[37:14] God we go into a little subject tonight
[37:18] 1 John 3:7 says little children let no
[37:20] man deceive you he that doeth
[37:22] righteousness is righteous even as he is
[37:25] righteous he that committeth sin
[37:28] is of the devil verse
[37:31] eight uh for the sin sinth or from the
[37:34] devil sinth from the beginning for this
[37:36] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[37:38] that he might destroy the works of the
[37:40] devil whosoever is born of God do not
[37:41] commit sin for his seed remaineth in him
[37:44] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[37:46] God in this the children of God are
[37:50] manifest and the children of the devil
[37:54] exactly ties in Matthew 133 with the
[37:58] parable there yes and the
[38:00] interpretation uh whosoever does not
[38:03] righteousness is not of God neither he
[38:06] that loveth not his brother for this is
[38:09] the message that you have heard from the
[38:11] beginning that we should love one
[38:14] another not as Cain who was of that
[38:16] Wicked one and slew his brother and
[38:19] wherefore slew he him because his own
[38:22] Works were evil and his brothers
[38:24] righteous man say say a word of Prayer
[38:28] Yes dear father Lord Jesus Lord we
[38:31] certainly come humbly Lord and
[38:32] reverently before you Lord Jesus Lord
[38:34] and Lord we thank you Lord for all that
[38:37] you've done Lord and Lord Jesus Lord the
[38:39] we are extremely happy Lord for the
[38:42] exceedingly precious promises you have
[38:45] for your bride in this last day Lord as
[38:47] many as the prophet uh spoke and how he
[38:50] said that if there's one day he want to
[38:51] live it be this day and Lord Jesus and
[38:54] that's because Lord You're Going to
[38:55] manifest Lord uh like you want to
[38:58] manifest Lord there will be a group of
[39:00] people Lord on the face of the Earth
[39:01] here God who be so yielded God and so uh
[39:05] Desir us Lord of your will that Lord
[39:08] they become dead to themselves literally
[39:11] Lord and and Lord they just walking
[39:13] vessels Lord walking tools for you Lord
[39:16] little Christ Lord little jesuses
[39:19] Messiahs Lord God that want to do your
[39:21] will Lord and fulfill your last uh bit
[39:23] of your plan for this hour and for this
[39:26] uh dispensation Lord and Lord just bless
[39:28] all the saints Lord for showing up Lord
[39:30] and uh we pray Lord you just be with the
[39:32] service Lord Speak Lord how you would
[39:34] want to speak God lord may we yield for
[39:36] it in the name of Jesus Christ amen you
[39:38] may have your seats
[39:47] there so this evening and it's evening
[39:51] because it's dark
[39:52] out when it's dark I get sleepy even if
[39:56] it's 4:00 and have
[39:57] [Laughter]
[39:59] my wife
[40:01] knows yeah that son is
[40:04] [Music]
[40:04] [Laughter]
[40:05] powerful um so uh want to thank brother
[40:09] Jesse for the kind words there after
[40:11] service and that was very fine
[40:15] uh um but I believe that brother Jesse's
[40:19] a very very gifted brother and I've
[40:23] never heard it quite so plain put his on
[40:25] his debate the brother was on his Sid
[40:27] side Jesse pretty much leads in the
[40:29] Apologetics of the message he has tape
[40:33] and video after video after tape after
[40:35] tape breaking down
[40:38] doctr as best as possibly can be done
[40:41] and we're thankful for that then if
[40:44] anyone in the message has a question on
[40:45] Doctor how many Souls have been touched
[40:48] by those videos I watched many of them
[40:49] even in Thailand just to refresh on a
[40:51] certain subject before I teach it
[40:54] and may God bless brother Jesse there's
[40:56] a lot of of uh a lot of uh riches that
[41:00] there'll be you'll see on the other side
[41:02] for those
[41:03] things U anyhow we're going to get into
[41:06] the topic
[41:07] here we read the scripture here just
[41:10] dealing obviously with Cain um and God's
[41:13] children the devil's children uh so we
[41:15] want to dive back in here to maybe the
[41:17] The Trail Of The Serpent and we'll have
[41:19] the the sub chop topic is Children of
[41:24] what so um you'll see at the in here
[41:28] it's uh very very
[41:30] simple but we want to let the Lord speak
[41:33] and amen there might be a little graphic
[41:36] things we're going to share tonight
[41:38] because we're heading down this Trail
[41:39] there's nothing good on this
[41:41] Trail there's absolutely nothing good on
[41:44] this Trail I mean literally I
[41:46] mean I mean the other Trail we could
[41:48] follow maybe the trail of the Lamb which
[41:50] is Christ and his children the Sheep
[41:53] Trail the trail of
[41:56] sheeps wool growing up like this 70 lbs
[41:59] of wool on me just cut me off and then
[42:01] I'm back to thin again so it's um
[42:04] garments clothing everything is made out
[42:05] of wool keeps you warm all those things
[42:08] I don't know maybe brother Jess will
[42:10] pick up on that um so we're going to
[42:12] deal with the trail of The Serpent
[42:15] and uh I want to hit this scripture
[42:18] because I noticed uh you know we know
[42:20] that when um God had dealt with Cain and
[42:23] Abel there and and then Cain to do did
[42:26] what he did and then uh God comes to
[42:29] Cain and um you know Cain never killed
[42:33] or God never killed Cain he just put a
[42:35] mark on him and and treat him treated
[42:37] him you know like a vigilante like a
[42:40] prisoner you know he was he was guilty
[42:42] and God made him feel like that he
[42:44] actually carried past a sentence and and
[42:47] he did those sort of
[42:49] things um but I want want you to read
[42:52] this here and we'll hit that last
[42:54] scripture there Matthew 13: 24
[42:58] another Parable put he forth saying unto
[42:59] them Kingdom of Heaven the Kingdom of
[43:01] Heaven is like unto a man which SED good
[43:02] seed in his field but while men slept
[43:05] his enemy came and so tears among the
[43:07] wheat and went his way right he says but
[43:10] when the blade was sprung forth and
[43:12] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[43:14] tears
[43:17] also so the Servants of the householder
[43:20] came and said to him sir did thou not so
[43:23] good seed in thy field from whence ha
[43:25] then hath the tears and he said to him
[43:27] an enemy has done this the servant said
[43:29] unto him wilt thou then that we go and
[43:31] gather up but he said nay lest we while
[43:34] lest while we gather up the tears ye
[43:36] root up also the wheat with them now no
[43:38] look look look what he says here in
[43:39] verse 30 let both grow together until
[43:44] the
[43:46] end God does not even kill the tears he
[43:50] allows them to
[43:53] grow there's no judgment passed here
[43:55] there's nothing that says kill them
[43:57] Angels take them out shed their blood
[44:00] wipe them out of all existence no God
[44:02] says let them both
[44:07] grow there's no anger with Christ here
[44:10] there's no judgment
[44:12] here and in the time of harvest I will
[44:15] say to the Reapers Gather ye together
[44:16] the first the tears and bind them in
[44:18] bundles to burn them but gather the
[44:20] wheat into my bar amen sure yes uh
[44:24] now as we jump obviously to the
[44:27] interpretation Jesus said to him he that
[44:29] Seth The Good Seed is the son of man the
[44:30] kingdom is the world the good seed are
[44:33] the children of the Kingdom but the
[44:34] tears are the children of the Wicked on
[44:35] so we see we have two sets of seed lines
[44:37] here we know the serpent seed and God's
[44:39] seed right absolutely yes um so now um
[44:44] there's many prophecies uh and and
[44:46] things said about this seed line um and
[44:50] we're going to cover some of these by
[44:51] the grace of God tonight notice in John
[44:53] 16:1 says these things have I spoken
[44:55] unto you that you should not be offended
[44:58] they shall put you out of the synagogues
[45:00] y the time cometh that whosoever kth you
[45:03] will think that he doeth God serves
[45:06] right think of the very mindset someone
[45:09] has to the the the amount the level of
[45:12] deception that someone has to come under
[45:15] a delusion that someone must come under
[45:17] to actually think
[45:19] this right you think of hunters you
[45:23] think of uh men uh looking for big game
[45:26] uh they are they are going to get a
[45:28] prize right if I was hungry back 150
[45:31] years ago I would have to go hunting for
[45:33] like maybe a raccoon or or or a beaver
[45:36] in America a deer you know whatever but
[45:39] I would be hunting it and I would have
[45:41] to kill it to eat it right now this kind
[45:45] of this kind of killing is not uh to to
[45:48] to uh suffice
[45:50] hunger outside of a bloodthirsty hunger
[45:54] this here is they literally are con
[45:57] vinced by Satan himself by the Devil by
[45:59] them demons that that that they are
[46:01] doing the very will of
[46:04] God right sure they're not to eat there
[46:08] but they think that they are performing
[46:10] a religious Duty a religious act
[46:13] something a service to God that no one
[46:15] else but them can
[46:17] do no one it's their personal
[46:22] revelation I know what it looks like
[46:24] it's it's it's disgusting it's bloody
[46:26] but it's a revelation it's it's what
[46:28] we're supposed to do is take out these
[46:33] Heretics and these things they they do
[46:35] unto you because they have not known the
[46:38] father nor
[46:40] me if it goes this far to where they
[46:43] take someone's life they have never even
[46:45] met God right
[46:49] amen amen sure now look what the Bible
[46:52] says here in Isaiah 591 he says behold
[46:55] the Lord's hand is not shortened that it
[46:58] cannot save neither his ear heavy that
[47:00] it cannot hear but your iniquities have
[47:02] separated between you and your God I'm
[47:05] not talking about this church I'm just
[47:06] talking to to the loss in general he
[47:08] says and your sins have have hid your
[47:11] his face from you and he will not hear
[47:12] you hear you for your hands are defiled
[47:15] with blood and your fingers with
[47:17] iniquity your lips have spoken lies he
[47:19] says your tongue have muttered
[47:22] perverseness none call for judgment or
[47:24] sorry Justice nor any pleading for truth
[47:27] they trust in vanity and speak lies he
[47:30] says they conceive mischief and bringeth
[47:33] forth iniquity this is all part of their
[47:36] little seed line there right right sure
[47:38] he says they hatch cockatrice his eggs
[47:42] and weave a spider's web so they bring
[47:45] forth these eggs and they start weaving
[47:48] what Spider's webs and those webs are
[47:50] what for traps to catch prey to devour
[47:54] he that eateth their eggs dieth notice
[47:57] it said they bring forth these eggs and
[47:58] someone if they were to eat these eggs
[48:01] they would actually die then that which
[48:03] is crust breth out into a v a Viper
[48:07] right but notice what I like how Barnes
[48:10] hits this he says he that eateth their
[48:12] eggs dieth that is he who partaketh in
[48:16] their counsels or in their plans which
[48:17] they form Shall Perish right Calvin said
[48:20] to the meaning says that whatsoever had
[48:22] that whosoever had anything to do with
[48:24] them would find themselves in
[48:25] destruction and wow whatever word that
[48:28] is similar phrases comparing the plans
[48:30] of a wicked of the Wicked with the eggs
[48:33] and The Brood of the serpent are common
[48:35] in common in the East it is said uh says
[48:39] Roberts speaking of India of the plans
[48:41] of a decidedly Wicked and talented men
[48:44] we're not dealing with people who are
[48:45] not intelligent or people that just some
[48:47] bum off the street but these are the
[48:49] high esteemed in society these guys got
[48:52] degrees and and Men of renown and those
[48:55] sort of things he says look he says
[48:57] these men he says no talented and wicked
[48:59] look what is said of them that wretch he
[49:02] hatches Serpent's eggs seeing a saying
[49:05] in the
[49:06] East Beware of the fellow his eggs are
[49:09] nearly
[49:10] hatched he says Ah my friend touch not
[49:14] Affair that Affair meddle not with that
[49:16] matter there is a serpent in the Shell
[49:18] these are sayings over there in the East
[49:21] dealing with serpents and their eggs
[49:24] absolutely sure
[49:27] So reading that once again he says they
[49:30] cat they hatch the these ideas and plans
[49:33] what and these ideas are plans for traps
[49:36] and then people decide to to do these
[49:38] things and whatever he says and then
[49:39] once and if it's and if one is crushed
[49:42] and it brings forth a serpent sure
[49:44] nothing but Bad Evil to from Evil to
[49:47] evil to evil to evil sure yes he says
[49:50] and their webs shall not become garments
[49:52] they don't want themselves to get in the
[49:54] Trap but they're sending them traps for
[49:56] others
[49:57] he says neither shall they cover
[49:59] themselves with their works if they do
[50:01] this evil thing they don't want have it
[50:03] even reflecting upon
[50:05] them as the Bible says in in proverbs 30
[50:09] and 20 it says the the adulterous women
[50:12] wipe their mouth and says I've done no
[50:14] wickedness they don't want to take any
[50:16] blame for anything they've done Oh
[50:18] my he says their works are works of
[50:21] iniquity and the act of violence is in
[50:23] their hands their feet run to evil and
[50:27] they make haste to shed innocent
[50:31] blood and their thoughts are thoughts of
[50:34] iniquity wasting and destruction are in
[50:37] their paths wherever if you could follow
[50:41] these people all you'll see is a ruins
[50:43] yes everything's destroyed wastelands uh
[50:46] howling forest or or deserts and fires
[50:50] everywhere it's just destroy them these
[50:52] people right the way of peace they know
[50:55] not and there is no judgment in their
[50:57] going they have Made Them Crooked pass
[51:00] whosoever goeth there shall not know uh
[51:03] shall not know peace amen sure now look
[51:07] what it says here in Romans 3
[51:10] and12 he says they are all gone out of
[51:12] the way and there they are together
[51:14] become unprofitable there is none that
[51:16] doeth good know not one the Bible says
[51:19] right says their Thro is an open SE
[51:22] culture with their tongues they have
[51:24] used deceit the poison of Ashes their
[51:26] lips their mouth is full of cursings and
[51:29] bitterness their feet uh are Swift to
[51:33] shed blood look murder is always right
[51:36] there taking innocent life is always
[51:39] there he says destruction and misery are
[51:42] in their ways and the way of peace they
[51:45] have not known there is no fear of God
[51:48] before their eyes right right right what
[51:52] kind of children are these they're
[51:53] destructive right they're just yes
[51:58] and the only thing that separates us is
[51:59] the seed right that's it we have a seed
[52:02] of God within us and that is what does
[52:04] the
[52:05] SE
[52:07] God that's it through thousands of years
[52:10] these two seed lines have mingled in and
[52:12] out mingled this way mingled that way
[52:14] form this and more that and now we don't
[52:16] know who's a who we don't know what we
[52:19] we we can't even
[52:21] distinguish anything but what the word
[52:24] of God always makes manifest
[52:27] yes when the word of God is presented
[52:29] the truth is presented to someone they
[52:30] have now a choice to say well that's
[52:32] true or that's not right yes sir and a
[52:35] lot of time that's their choice right
[52:37] there yes sir uh but Jo jumping here to
[52:40] Matthew 23 and
[52:43] 13 it says notice this is the very first
[52:46] woe woe number one I had a dog and
[52:51] sometimes she would bark and she'd go
[52:53] whoa whoa whoa whoa
[52:55] whoa that's just how she spoke W wowow
[52:59] wowow CH
[53:03] relax that's just
[53:05] something in Matthew 23:13 he says but
[53:09] woe unto you scribes and Pharisees
[53:11] Hypocrites he says look notice one of
[53:13] the first things they do for ye shut up
[53:15] the Kingdom of Heaven against men what
[53:18] was one of the first things the Catholic
[53:20] Church did they shut up the kingdom of
[53:24] heaven
[53:26] if you get baptized wrong you're going
[53:28] to have the wrong results if you believe
[53:31] in a false god you'll never make Heaven
[53:33] oh
[53:34] my first thing they did was shut the
[53:36] Kingdom of Heaven yes right why would
[53:40] they change baptism because that baptism
[53:42] guarantees the Holy Ghost and when you
[53:43] get the Holy Ghost you'll start living
[53:45] the Christian Life and displaying Christ
[53:47] on the scene and destroying the devil's
[53:50] Kingdom and they had to figure out how
[53:52] to shut it down so they switch what the
[53:54] baptism name for titles
[53:57] right simple and how many have they
[54:00] killed this way spiritually right
[54:03] billions upon billions upon billions I
[54:08] just last month I had just listened to
[54:11] 50 years in a church in Rome on the way
[54:12] to work uh I I was driving an hour one
[54:15] way and an hour back and I was able to
[54:16] get through that entire
[54:17] book listen to it Charles
[54:21] Chinle saints of
[54:24] God the Catholic that that church is
[54:30] just you can't there's nothing good to
[54:32] say about it yes there's literally
[54:35] nothing good to say about
[54:38] it you know your mom always said hey uh
[54:41] if you ain't got nothing good to say
[54:42] don't say none at all you have that is
[54:44] pretty much what it
[54:46] is what did Christ say in the first
[54:48] seven Church ages Revelations 2 and
[54:50] three about that situation he said
[54:53] nothing good
[54:56] right yeah right right he said for a spa
[55:00] I even gave he said God said he I even
[55:02] gave her a space of time much
[55:04] longsuffering that she could repent but
[55:06] she repented not right what if God
[55:09] waited a thousand years after
[55:10] persecution after persecution after
[55:12] persecution and God waited for the her
[55:15] repentance he never did yes
[55:19] sir amen it goes through eight woes the
[55:25] seventh woe
[55:26] and then of course the eighth goes back
[55:28] to the beginning
[55:30] right you know what took place with Cain
[55:33] and that's the beginning the eighth woe
[55:37] woe unto you scribes and Pharisees and
[55:40] hypocrites because you build the tombs
[55:42] of the prophets and garish the sub
[55:44] cultures of the righteous and say if we
[55:46] had been in the days of our fathers we
[55:48] would not have been partakers with them
[55:50] in the blood of their prophets now
[55:52] Christ is saying this has come out of
[55:54] your mouth that this is your testimony
[55:57] that these were your daddies and your
[55:59] masas and your great grandpas and all
[56:01] those things this is your seed line yes
[56:04] yes he's obviously quoting
[56:07] them he says wherefore ye be Witnesses
[56:09] unto yourselves that ye are the children
[56:12] of them which killed the
[56:16] prophets Christ is blasting out their
[56:20] seed line he's blasting out the trail he
[56:23] says just look at your GE geology or
[56:26] genealogy how Bloody are is your
[56:30] family but notice look at that he said
[56:33] that's good he said he said you your
[56:35] your fathers have done an absolutely a
[56:37] horrible
[56:39] job and that's right but now look what
[56:42] he tells them he says fill ye up the
[56:44] measure of your
[56:46] fathers if your daddy's going to do it
[56:49] you're going to do it
[56:52] too and then he calls them what Adam
[56:54] should have said when Eve called Cain a
[56:58] man from the Lord you know Eve said I've
[57:01] gotten a man from the Lord and the first
[57:03] Adam was silent he never corrected his
[57:06] wife but when the second Adam come he
[57:09] calls him exactly what it is yes amen
[57:11] amen he says ye serpents ye Generation
[57:14] of Vipers how can you escape the
[57:17] damnation of hell they could never be
[57:19] saved right yes now notice here he says
[57:22] ye serpents you generation how can you
[57:23] escape the damn Nation now wherefore
[57:25] behold I sended you prophets and wise
[57:28] men and scribes and some of them you
[57:30] shall kill and crucify and some of them
[57:32] shall you Scourge in the synagogues and
[57:34] persecute them from City to city or from
[57:37] church age to church
[57:41] age this is he what he says he he say
[57:44] behold I send unto you prophets amen
[57:47] that's future tense absolutely they ran
[57:50] him all the way from Ephesus all the way
[57:52] to right now and theyve persecuted him
[57:54] exactly as Christ said yes sir amen that
[57:57] upon you may come all the righteous
[57:59] blood shed upon the Earth from the blood
[58:01] of righteous Abel unto the blood of
[58:05] Zacharias son of
[58:06] barakus whom he slew between the temple
[58:09] and the altar all that blood was
[58:14] compounding year after year after year
[58:17] on that seed line yes uh I think brother
[58:20] Jesse and brother cam had actually
[58:21] started preaching on curses and
[58:23] blessings at the exact same time without
[58:25] even kn the
[58:28] other and I watched the man he said he
[58:31] said you know generational curses start
[58:34] from one person in your seed line one
[58:37] daddy or one Mama that hates God and
[58:40] that takes on a curse and that curse
[58:42] then is passed on to the next Generation
[58:45] until maybe a seed of God comes up and
[58:47] stops the curse but this seed line that
[58:50] servant SE like continues to go on and
[58:52] on and on and on curses piling up the
[58:56] Bible says in second Peter calls them
[58:58] cursed children right right
[59:00] sure he says ver say to you all these
[59:03] things shall come upon this generation
[59:05] in other words he said they've killed so
[59:07] much there's coming a stopping
[59:11] point the Jewish people have killed
[59:14] God's prophets and and all and scribes
[59:16] and all those holy men he sent them for
[59:18] thousands of years he said then there's
[59:20] coming a stopping point when and I
[59:22] believe the historians say this is when
[59:24] what Titus or Nero however uh come in
[59:26] and Destroy Jerusalem it's done
[59:29] fulfilled right then and he wiped them
[59:31] out and they've been uh homeless for
[59:33] almost 2,000 years and now that God is
[59:35] restoring them back amen so now as I was
[59:40] listening to 50 years in the Church of
[59:43] Rome you know the the church the
[59:47] Catholic church is the
[59:49] absolute it's not even uh uh the priests
[59:53] it's not even the the monks
[59:56] or the arch Bishops and Cardinals it is
[59:58] the holy fathers they
[1:00:01] say and their teachings go all the way
[1:00:04] back to the original holy
[1:00:06] fathers and as Chinle was looking at the
[1:00:10] they said they said chin you're leaning
[1:00:12] too much you sound like a
[1:00:14] Protestant he's like I'm just reading
[1:00:16] the Bible he says well you need to quit
[1:00:18] reading that to read the Holy fathers he
[1:00:20] says and say what they say so chally put
[1:00:22] down the Bible he started reading the
[1:00:23] holy fathers you know what he found out
[1:00:25] about the fathers none of them agreed on
[1:00:29] anything and he told them he told he was
[1:00:32] pretty bold to his uh upper guys he said
[1:00:34] he said hey they don't even agree with
[1:00:36] one another he said well well then they
[1:00:38] dive off into another Rabbit Trail they
[1:00:40] always bypassed or sidestep the question
[1:00:44] right right like they always
[1:00:47] do but as he was reading the holy
[1:00:51] fathers I'll say like this why would why
[1:00:53] would the Catholic Church be such murder
[1:00:56] why would they why would the Jesuits and
[1:00:58] all those things exist so prevalently
[1:01:02] right because one of the Holy fathers
[1:01:04] was Thomas aquinus quinius or whatever
[1:01:06] you're called he says so according to
[1:01:08] this Thomas guys the issue at stake is
[1:01:12] the defined doctrines and the dogma of
[1:01:14] the Roman Catholic church if you
[1:01:16] knowingly contradict the papacy and
[1:01:18] doctrines of the Pope as the pope
[1:01:20] defines them then you are classified as
[1:01:21] a heretic okay so how many Heretics we
[1:01:24] have in here right all absolutely will
[1:01:27] always be following the following are
[1:01:30] four possible observations that that
[1:01:33] about tolerating Heretics they actually
[1:01:36] tolerate
[1:01:37] us the reason they did not take over in
[1:01:39] the 1800s in the in in Canada was
[1:01:41] because they were outnumbered by the
[1:01:45] Protestants and they've had many many uh
[1:01:48] the Protestants have had even the
[1:01:50] Catholic people themselves have had many
[1:01:52] many overthrows of priests and Catholics
[1:01:55] and those sort of things so they had to
[1:01:56] watch they could only go so far because
[1:01:59] and Chin kept warning the priest they
[1:02:01] said guys if we keep doing this if you
[1:02:03] guys keep doing this they're going to
[1:02:04] kill
[1:02:05] us because they did it in France they
[1:02:08] did it in this country they did that
[1:02:09] country because the people get tired
[1:02:11] right right nobody likes living under a
[1:02:15] dictator no people like their freedom
[1:02:18] people like to be happy people like to
[1:02:20] have joy in their
[1:02:22] life
[1:02:24] right yes
[1:02:28] with the question now whether Heretics
[1:02:29] should be tolerated here's what he
[1:02:31] answers it seems that Heretics ought to
[1:02:33] be tolerated for the Apostle says in
[1:02:35] second Timothy the servant of the Lord
[1:02:37] must not Wrangle or with modesty admin
[1:02:40] them with that resist the truth if
[1:02:42] pre-venture God may give them repentance
[1:02:44] to know the truth and they may recover
[1:02:47] themselves from the snares of the devil
[1:02:49] now if Heretics are not tolerated but
[1:02:51] put to death they lose the opportunity
[1:02:53] of repentance they use the same same
[1:02:56] scriptures we use therefore it seems
[1:02:59] contrary to the apostles command oh so
[1:03:02] they have tolerance with us he says
[1:03:05] furthermore whatsoever is necessary in
[1:03:07] the church should be tolerated now
[1:03:10] heresies are necessary in the church
[1:03:12] since the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians
[1:03:14] 1 or sorry 11 and 19 uh there must be
[1:03:17] heresies uh that they who are uh
[1:03:19] reproved uh may be made manifest among
[1:03:22] you therefore it seems Heretics should
[1:03:23] be tolerated okay okay there's another
[1:03:26] scripture further the master commanded
[1:03:29] his servants in Matthew 13 and3 to
[1:03:32] suffer the cockles to to grow until the
[1:03:35] Harvest so they're calling us then see
[1:03:37] see look it shows that God what has has
[1:03:40] uh or that they should as God let them
[1:03:42] grow that we should let them grow as
[1:03:45] well he says therefore Heretics should
[1:03:48] be tolerated on the contrary the Apostle
[1:03:51] says Titus 31011 a man that is heretic
[1:03:55] after the first and second admonition
[1:03:56] avoid knowing that he such a one is a is
[1:04:01] subverted okay so this is how they dial
[1:04:04] in whether somebody's a
[1:04:06] heretic I seen you didn't bow down to
[1:04:08] the pope
[1:04:11] yesterday's like yeah that's
[1:04:14] right and I call him out one time and I
[1:04:16] go back and say the next day like hey
[1:04:19] Mass you didn't down B down to the pop
[1:04:21] again I gave him two admition
[1:04:23] admonitions boom you're out of here I'm
[1:04:24] not going to talk to you anymore
[1:04:26] and that's how they that's how they did
[1:04:28] they did things right so and then at
[1:04:31] that time then you would be declared a
[1:04:33] heretic
[1:04:34] okay I'm just picking you know it's just
[1:04:38] story so once a heretic is is
[1:04:42] determined now they come to the question
[1:04:45] now what these what these holy fathers
[1:04:47] are is a bunch of books his books are
[1:04:49] specifically are like a bunch of
[1:04:50] questions and he answers each question
[1:04:52] it's like questions
[1:04:54] Q&A yeah
[1:04:56] now Thomas a queen's opinion on what
[1:04:59] should be done with
[1:05:01] Heretics
[1:05:02] this every
[1:05:05] priest everyone moving into the clergy
[1:05:08] of the Catholic Church reads
[1:05:11] these this is what they must do this is
[1:05:15] their Viewpoint they must listen to The
[1:05:18] Holy
[1:05:19] fathers I answer that with regards to
[1:05:24] regard to Heretics two points must be
[1:05:27] observed one on their own side the other
[1:05:30] on the side of the church on their own
[1:05:33] side there is the sin whereby they
[1:05:36] deserve not only to be separated from
[1:05:38] the church by
[1:05:41] excommunication but also to be severed
[1:05:43] from the World by
[1:05:46] death for it is much Graver matter to
[1:05:49] corrupt the faith that quickens which
[1:05:51] quickens the soul than to forge money
[1:05:54] which supports temporal life
[1:05:56] wherefore if forgers of money and other
[1:05:58] evildoers are forth with condemned to to
[1:06:02] death by the secular Authority look how
[1:06:05] look how slickly how they bring this a
[1:06:08] natural criminal is put to death what
[1:06:11] about the spiritual most important
[1:06:13] spiritual thing in the world
[1:06:18] is much more reason is there for
[1:06:21] Heretics as soon as they are convicted
[1:06:23] of heresy to not only be commuted but
[1:06:26] even put to
[1:06:27] death and this is what chinik admit even
[1:06:31] put it in his book this is what they are
[1:06:34] taught from day
[1:06:37] one but they cannot do it a lot of times
[1:06:40] out in the open or in public because
[1:06:43] they're just
[1:06:46] outnumbered on the part of the church
[1:06:48] whether there is Mercy which looks to
[1:06:50] the conversion of The Wanderer whether
[1:06:53] she condemns uh she condemns not at once
[1:06:56] or after the first and second admonition
[1:06:58] as the Apostle directs after that um if
[1:07:02] he is yet stubborn the church no longer
[1:07:04] hoping for his
[1:07:06] conversion when do we give up on people
[1:07:09] we never give up on
[1:07:13] Souls unless the Holy Spirit allow
[1:07:16] Quicken something to us don't pray for
[1:07:18] him right there's a time I our old
[1:07:20] Pastor brother Brooks he was talking to
[1:07:22] a certain brother and the Holy Spirit
[1:07:23] said that's a serpent and he left them
[1:07:25] alone
[1:07:27] let's read
[1:07:28] hold he says after that if ye if he is
[1:07:32] yet stubborn the church no longer hoping
[1:07:34] for his conversion looks to the
[1:07:35] Salvation of others by excommunicating
[1:07:38] him and separating from the church and
[1:07:40] furthermore delivers them to the secular
[1:07:43] tribunal a worldly one but I thought the
[1:07:45] church was supposed to
[1:07:47] judge oh my to be exterminated therefore
[1:07:51] thereby from the World by death for
[1:07:53] Drome come there's another church father
[1:07:55] Jerome right commented on Galatians 5
[1:07:58] and9 a little 11 says cut off the
[1:08:01] decayed flesh expelled The Mangy sheep
[1:08:04] from the fold lest the whole house the
[1:08:06] whole Pace the whole body the whole
[1:08:09] flock burn perish die
[1:08:13] rot twisting the
[1:08:16] scriptures completely distorting
[1:08:19] misinterpreting the word of God how in
[1:08:23] the world can you get that from this
[1:08:26] when the Bible says to deliver such a
[1:08:28] one up to Satan amen and let what Satan
[1:08:31] deal with his flesh what that his soul
[1:08:33] might be saved amen they they take one
[1:08:35] scripture but they leave the rest out
[1:08:37] they can't even rightly divide the word
[1:08:39] of God right
[1:08:41] amen God
[1:08:43] help now we're going to move into this
[1:08:46] here there's in in a couple slides
[1:08:48] you're going to see
[1:08:49] something and uh if if the tactics are
[1:08:53] the same the tactics will remain in
[1:08:55] it'll happen exactly now let's just go
[1:08:57] into this a little bit here on August
[1:08:59] 24th
[1:09:02] 1572 the bloody St Bartholomew Massacre
[1:09:06] began this was to be the final blow to
[1:09:08] destroy the Protestant movement in
[1:09:10] France the king of France had cleverly
[1:09:12] arranged a marriage between his sister
[1:09:14] and Henry of nvar head of the Protestant
[1:09:17] Army so they arranged this without
[1:09:20] anyone knowing there was a great feast
[1:09:23] with much celebrating after four days of
[1:09:25] Fe in the soldiers were given a signal
[1:09:27] and an hour before Dawn all the houses
[1:09:29] of the Protestants in the city were
[1:09:31] forced open at once Admiral so and so
[1:09:34] the chief Protestant leader was killed
[1:09:35] his body thrown out of the window into
[1:09:37] the street his uh head was cut off sent
[1:09:39] to the pope uh everything and he was
[1:09:42] hung outside the
[1:09:46] city is the Catholic Church the same or
[1:09:49] has it
[1:09:52] changed this morning we talked about a
[1:09:54] trap being set
[1:09:59] they also slaughtered many well-known
[1:10:01] Protestants in the first three days over
[1:10:03] 10,000 were killed the bodies were
[1:10:05] thrown at the river blood ran through
[1:10:07] the streets into a river until it into a
[1:10:09] river until it appeared like a stream of
[1:10:11] blood so Furious was their rage that
[1:10:13] they even slew their own
[1:10:16] followers if they suspected they were
[1:10:18] not very strong in the faith in the
[1:10:22] Pope I had just witnessed to a young man
[1:10:25] or a I'm sorry a Catholic man in June
[1:10:29] and we sat together at lunch and we' go
[1:10:32] back and
[1:10:33] forth and he'd question me and i'
[1:10:35] question him and it was fun because I
[1:10:38] not fun but it was it was interesting we
[1:10:40] got
[1:10:41] to lock swords and I said sir I said
[1:10:46] would you bow down he goes he he made a
[1:10:48] comment he say I'll never bow down any
[1:10:49] man and then the next day I brought it
[1:10:51] up and I said you said you wouldn't bow
[1:10:53] down to would you ever bow down to the
[1:10:54] pope he said absolutely not he's just a
[1:10:57] man he'd be killed right right he's not
[1:11:00] a solid cat right
[1:11:04] right
[1:11:06] ruthless cold
[1:11:10] blood from Paris the destruction spread
[1:11:13] to all parts of the country over 8,000
[1:11:15] more people were killed very few PRS
[1:11:17] escaped the fury of their
[1:11:21] persecutors now watch this watch this
[1:11:23] next one here
[1:11:27] this one's this one
[1:11:29] is a similar Massacre occurred in
[1:11:33] Ireland in 1641 the conspirators picked
[1:11:36] October 23rd the Feast of ignacius lyola
[1:11:41] the founder of the Jes order did you
[1:11:43] know igna or what's it
[1:11:47] called Ignatius Loy lyola he actually
[1:11:51] had to he actually developed a system
[1:11:54] for the Jesuits in in which he would
[1:11:56] work himself up into like a into like a
[1:11:59] fleshly carnal uh spiritual kind of
[1:12:02] Rage or just some kind of thing where he
[1:12:05] was like in a
[1:12:07] Euphoria and that's how they train their
[1:12:09] Jesuits you you have to read the book
[1:12:11] but uh it's pretty interesting how they
[1:12:12] he got into
[1:12:14] that he says they planned a general
[1:12:17] Uprising for the whole country the
[1:12:19] entire
[1:12:22] country at Mass
[1:12:25] they would secretly talk to each other
[1:12:27] the around the entire
[1:12:29] country send letters to
[1:12:31] Catholics all done
[1:12:35] secretly all Protestants would be would
[1:12:38] be killed at once to throw them off
[1:12:41] guard while the plan was being made
[1:12:43] extra acts of kindness were shown to
[1:12:49] Protestants
[1:12:52] using sweetness
[1:12:55] man they are really good people he just
[1:12:58] gave me two pieces of pie strawberry
[1:13:01] even and a
[1:13:03] cake and last week he gave my children
[1:13:07] little Trinkets and
[1:13:12] toys early in the morning the
[1:13:14] conspirators were armed and every
[1:13:16] Protestant they could find was
[1:13:17] immediately murdered they showed no mer
[1:13:19] no mercy from children to the age they
[1:13:22] were killed even invalids were not
[1:13:24] spared they were caught by complete
[1:13:27] surprise a trap was sprung a
[1:13:34] snare was happening they had lived in
[1:13:37] peace and safety for years and now found
[1:13:41] no place to run they were massacred by
[1:13:45] neighbors friends and even
[1:13:51] relatives not trying to bring it down
[1:13:52] I'm just letting you know the severity
[1:13:55] we better make sure we have the baptism
[1:13:57] of the Holy Ghost yes sir that is the
[1:14:00] way out you will escape all these things
[1:14:05] if we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:08] amen now look the prophet say he said
[1:14:10] now don't be confused and start thinking
[1:14:12] that the Church of Rome has repented
[1:14:14] over her Slaughter of the Saints because
[1:14:15] she is attempting to unite the
[1:14:17] Protestants by making her Creeds to line
[1:14:19] up with Protestant Creeds not once has
[1:14:21] she ever apologized and said she was
[1:14:23] wrong for mass murders and she won't
[1:14:25] either and no matter how mellow and
[1:14:28] sweet she appears at this particular
[1:14:31] time he says she will yet to rise to
[1:14:34] kill for murder lies in her evil and
[1:14:36] unrepented
[1:14:39] heart we can say you know thus say the
[1:14:41] Lord for
[1:14:42] that because we know the Book of
[1:14:45] Revelations we know the laws that are
[1:14:47] going to be passed we know the exactly
[1:14:49] what's going to take place right
[1:14:52] amen now
[1:14:56] I don't know if any of you guys are
[1:14:57] familiar with this the Church outline of
[1:15:00] History by the church of centuries maybe
[1:15:01] brother Jesse he brought this out maybe
[1:15:04] I'm sure you have
[1:15:07] um saints of God do you think it would
[1:15:10] be possible that there would be a law
[1:15:13] come up in
[1:15:14] America that if you don't believe the
[1:15:16] Trinity you'll be
[1:15:21] killed I'll say like this there already
[1:15:23] is a law
[1:15:26] and it's in
[1:15:31] Maryland close to the Virgin
[1:15:37] Nia remember this brother just the law
[1:15:41] of Maryland concerning
[1:15:44] religion
[1:15:45] Maryland who's
[1:15:49] Mary this is
[1:15:51] from 1649
[1:15:58] 16:49 he says that whosoever person or
[1:16:01] persons within the Providence in the
[1:16:04] islands where to belonging shall
[1:16:06] henceforth blashe God that is
[1:16:08] to curse him and shall deny Our Savior
[1:16:12] Jesus Christ to be the Son of God or
[1:16:14] shall deny the Holy
[1:16:18] Trinity the father son holy ghost or the
[1:16:20] godhead or any of the three-fold persons
[1:16:23] of the Trinity or the UN Unity of the
[1:16:24] the
[1:16:25] godhead uh or
[1:16:28] shall utter any reproachable Spees words
[1:16:31] language concerning the Holy Trinity or
[1:16:34] of the said threefold persons thereof
[1:16:37] shall be punished with death and
[1:16:40] confiscation of foreclosure of all his
[1:16:42] lands Goods
[1:16:46] property everything's taken
[1:16:49] America 1649
[1:16:56] unreal right it's already
[1:17:03] there killing because you don't believe
[1:17:06] the same
[1:17:08] thing that's
[1:17:10] literally what happens every day in
[1:17:12] America husband and wife start fighting
[1:17:14] and this and that and one wants this way
[1:17:16] one this way and one kills the
[1:17:21] other two brothers I heard there was a
[1:17:23] story over uh near my way two brothers
[1:17:26] were arguing about something one one and
[1:17:28] they're both living at home one took a
[1:17:30] gun and shot the other over a
[1:17:33] disagreement a
[1:17:36] disagreement a
[1:17:38] disagreement on what they want to
[1:17:40] believe it is so petty it is so minute
[1:17:43] it's just unreal what's now this is this
[1:17:46] one's from brother Jesse
[1:17:48] here unbelievers living just lives will
[1:17:52] be
[1:17:53] saved here back there and was it 2000 no
[1:17:56] yeah 2000 Pope John Paul II whatever
[1:18:00] said the gospel teaches that those who
[1:18:02] live in accordance with the Beatitudes
[1:18:03] the poor in spirit loving heart those
[1:18:05] who love bear lovingly the sufferings of
[1:18:07] of life will enter God's kingdom all who
[1:18:10] seek God With Us in your sincere heart
[1:18:12] including those who do not know Christ
[1:18:15] and his church contribute under the
[1:18:18] influence of grace to the building of
[1:18:20] his kingdom they'll all be saved any
[1:18:22] good person will be saved look at they
[1:18:25] lock the Kingdom of Heaven up to

[1:18:32] not uh uh other than
[1:18:34] this who I just heard a brother brother
[1:18:37] or somebody preached this one of the
[1:18:38] greatest deceptions in the church today
[1:18:40] is that they allow people to come and
[1:18:43] join church and tell them you're good to
[1:18:45] go you have arrived right pay your ties

[1:23:51] testimony here uh or his account The
[1:23:56] Franciscan and I bet to see who would
[1:23:58] kill more prisoners in one night the
[1:24:01] killing began and after an hour I killed
[1:24:04] many more than them I felt in the
[1:24:06] seventh

[1:24:24] to kill
[1:24:26] 1,100 people while the others were
[1:24:29] weren't even close and then as I was
[1:24:32] experiencing my grandest ecstasy I
[1:24:34] noticed an old peasant standing quietly
[1:24:36] watching me as watching me as uh as I
[1:24:41] killed my victims and them that had died
[1:24:43] with the greatest of pain some old man
[1:24:45] was just
[1:24:46] watching I know this is a little rough
[1:24:48] for the young ones but uh uh he looks
[1:24:51] and sees this old man watching while
[1:24:52] he's doing his thing
[1:24:55] um that look struck me in the middle of
[1:24:57] my greatest ecstasy and suddenly I froze
[1:25:01] and for a while I could not
[1:25:02] move he's killing just going insane and
[1:25:06] sees an old man just staring at
[1:25:08] him and he stops and he can't take his
[1:25:10] eye
[1:25:14] off then I approached him and discovered
[1:25:16] that he was from the village
[1:25:18] of and that his family had been murdered
[1:25:21] and sent to this Camp after work having
[1:25:25] having worked in the
[1:25:27] forest he spoke with me with some he
[1:25:30] spoke to me with some incomprehensible
[1:25:33] peace that affected me more than the
[1:25:35] heartbreaking screams All Around Me
[1:25:37] suddenly I felt a need to destroy his
[1:25:39] peace Through Torture and thus through
[1:25:41] his
[1:25:43] suffering I could restore my state of
[1:25:46] ecstasy in order to continue to pleasure
[1:25:48] of inflicting pain
[1:25:54] I pulled him aside and made him sit with
[1:25:56] me on a log I order him to shout long
[1:25:58] live this guy H or I cut your ear off
[1:26:02] the man did not speak I ripped out an
[1:26:04] ear I said say it again or I'll rip your
[1:26:08] other ear out I ripped the other out he
[1:26:09] shouts uh he shouts this or I rip your
[1:26:13] nose out and then I will uh told him the
[1:26:15] fourth time to shout that and threaten
[1:26:17] to pluck his heart with my knife and
[1:26:19] look what this man says he looked at me
[1:26:22] and in his pain and agony said do your
[1:26:25] work
[1:26:27] creature he didn't even call him a human
[1:26:29] he called him a
[1:26:31] creature a beast a natural brute
[1:26:35] Beast those words confused me froze me
[1:26:39] and then he goes on to finish his job
[1:26:43] but he says something broke inside me
[1:26:45] that I could not kill anymore that night
[1:26:48] and The Franciscan Petro brisna won the
[1:26:51] bet because he had
[1:26:52] killed uh so many prisoners and I paid
[1:26:55] without saying a
[1:26:57] word this is
[1:26:59] sick this is the
[1:27:02] Trail of a serpent or the serpents I say
[1:27:05] like this it's nothing but
[1:27:07] Bloodshed hatred and they like
[1:27:11] it it does something for
[1:27:14] them now ever know who this guy
[1:27:19] is schmucker's glorious Reformation I
[1:27:22] have this book in this fact I took
[1:27:24] pictures of it did you know the Catholic
[1:27:26] Church actually has their own
[1:27:28] Bible written according and they've
[1:27:30] changed
[1:27:32] scriptures he says
[1:27:35] uh now notice it says here says merely
[1:27:38] on the priests or kept as a secret among
[1:27:40] them in other words they have this
[1:27:41] little secret Bible they call the real
[1:27:43] Bible and they pass it amongst the
[1:27:45] priests in secret and they change the
[1:27:49] scriptures in order to carry on
[1:27:52] persecution the mass of the people must
[1:27:54] be at least in some degree prepared for
[1:27:56] it and therefore the only copies of the
[1:27:59] scripture which were permitted to be
[1:28:00] read by the people the the D Bible and
[1:28:05] The ramish Testament have so falsified
[1:28:08] the sacred volume as to make it teach
[1:28:11] some the same Doctrine and breathe The
[1:28:13] Same Spirit of hatred and blood against
[1:28:15] Protestants thus the latter has the
[1:28:17] following comments in other words this
[1:28:18] is he's now diving into the secret book
[1:28:20] he had come into Matthew in Matthew 3
[1:28:24] Heretics must be punished and suppressed
[1:28:27] and may an ought by Public Authority
[1:28:29] either spiritual or temporal be
[1:28:30] chastised or executed that's in Matthew
[1:28:33] 3 the secret Catholic
[1:28:36] Bible Galatians 1 and8 Catholics should
[1:28:40] not spare their own parents if they are
[1:28:43] Heretics that's not what my G Colossians
[1:28:45] say Hebrews 5:7 the translators of the
[1:28:49] Protestant Bible ought to be abored to
[1:28:52] the depths of hell
[1:28:55] that's not what my Hebrews 5 and7
[1:28:58] says mine starts out in the days of his
[1:29:02] flesh Revelations uh and then he goes on
[1:29:05] how that's uh Protestants say that this
[1:29:07] is them and of course it is revelation
[1:29:11] 17:6 drunken with the blood of the
[1:29:13] Saints Protestants says the comment
[1:29:15] foolishly expound this of
[1:29:17] Rome for that they put Heretics to death
[1:29:21] and allow and allow of their punishment
[1:29:24] in other countries he says but their
[1:29:27] Butchery
[1:29:29] of 15 millions of Indians in South
[1:29:31] America Mexico and Cuba by uh Spanish
[1:29:35] papis so know words he's kind of showing
[1:29:38] right there that uh that's what they are
[1:29:41] the Catholic church is drunken with the
[1:29:42] blood of the Saints and martys of Jesus
[1:29:44] Christ as I was thinking of this South
[1:29:48] America 15,000 of Indians in South
[1:29:51] America why are all these what you ever
[1:29:54] see those uh those stories of they go
[1:29:57] like people are exploring down by the
[1:29:58] Amazon and they they fall upon this big
[1:30:00] giant city that was covered by and they
[1:30:03] say well where did these people go so
[1:30:05] mysterious how they just disappeared or
[1:30:06] they came Mur murdered by the Jesuits
[1:30:09] back in the 1400s and
[1:30:19] 1500s now it's recorded in Smuckers go
[1:30:22] Reformation the Catholic church has
[1:30:24] guilty of 68 million Protestants okay
[1:30:26] right and you know where he got that
[1:30:28] number from he got that number from a
[1:30:30] man called William brownley okay now
[1:30:33] William brownley started he was actually
[1:30:35] adding up and calculating what actually
[1:30:37] the number could possibly
[1:30:39] be the population of Europe from 1100 to
[1:30:43] 1500 averaged about 65 million people if
[1:30:46] 1% of the population was sometimes burnt
[1:30:48] as witches per year one can assume that
[1:30:51] on the average of half a percent on the
[1:30:53] average half a percent of the population
[1:30:55] was slain each year as hers altogether
[1:30:57] this would amount to the average of
[1:30:59] about 300,000 persons killed per year
[1:31:02] for 400 years or 200 million persons
[1:31:05] totally killed during 400 years and most
[1:31:08] of those done was probably by the
[1:31:09] Catholic Church they ruled during Dark
[1:31:14] Ages you know that you remember how the
[1:31:16] test of the witch
[1:31:17] was that person's a witch oh yeah the
[1:31:20] test of a witch was to bind the person
[1:31:24] throw them in the
[1:31:26] water and if they floated they weren't a
[1:31:34] witch these figures do not even consider
[1:31:37] those killed in the new world and the
[1:31:39] non-christians killed in Europe and Asia
[1:31:41] for example referring to Bishop of uh
[1:31:44] Chap's account of the cruelty of the
[1:31:46] Spaniards in in
[1:31:48] America
[1:31:50] uh truly they went a a great way to make
[1:31:54] this remark literally true with regard
[1:31:57] to the new world when first found out
[1:32:00] for according to the account of one of
[1:32:02] their own Bishops in the space of 40
[1:32:04] years they destroyed 50 million of
[1:32:06] people in the new
[1:32:11] world a Catholic priest admitted
[1:32:15] that and Smucker's low low estimate of
[1:32:19] 68 million is absolutely nothing it's
[1:32:21] just a small random number adding in
[1:32:25] these deaths might explain the commonly
[1:32:26] quoted figure of eight of a 100 million
[1:32:29] killed by the papacy adding in
[1:32:31] non-christians killed in Europe might
[1:32:33] explain some of the higher figures
[1:32:35] adding in the total killed assumed to
[1:32:37] the half of a percent killed in per year
[1:32:39] in Europe for 400 years but now you have
[1:32:41] about 200 million total
[1:32:45] killed omitting those killed in the new
[1:32:47] world would yield about uh 150 million
[1:32:51] this might explain why many common
[1:32:53] quotes figures come from in other words
[1:32:54] the people are saying oh oh oh Smucker's
[1:32:57] way low and they threw out these and
[1:32:59] this and this guy is saying yeah that's
[1:33:00] probably they're probably closer than
[1:33:01] smucker is smucker being very uh well he
[1:33:06] said those that are
[1:33:08] recorded there is another compulation
[1:33:11] that yields a 100 million killed by the
[1:33:13] papacy in Rish in the light of the
[1:33:15] prophecy and history it is its final
[1:33:17] downfall and the Triumph of the Church
[1:33:19] of Christ Brown Lee quotes a figure of
[1:33:22] 68 and a half milli killed by the papacy
[1:33:25] composed of 50 million Christians in
[1:33:27] Europe 15 million in Indians in the new
[1:33:29] world 15 million were killed by the
[1:33:34] Catholics I didn't even know
[1:33:36] that I thought they were starved out by
[1:33:38] the American Rich guys riding railroads
[1:33:40] shooting
[1:33:41] Buffalo no that wasn't even close to
[1:33:44] happen them or who knows
[1:33:47] what 1.5 million Jews in Spain and
[1:33:50] elsewhere and two million Moors in Spain
[1:33:52] then he writes then then this uh
[1:33:54] brownley writes and oh merciful Father
[1:33:57] in Heaven this does not include the
[1:33:58] millions of their own people and her
[1:34:01] enemies which fell in her Crusades and
[1:34:03] wars and massacre here 30 millions and a
[1:34:06] half would be a moderate calculation of
[1:34:09] their own people and saints of God how
[1:34:11] many nuns have died in in nunneries how
[1:34:14] many monks have been killed and and
[1:34:16] babies and all those things saints of
[1:34:17] God were into the probably billions
[1:34:20] let's just be honest
[1:34:24] 100 million of the human race by her
[1:34:26] bloody Reign by her bloody
[1:34:30] religion what does it say here in
[1:34:32] Revelations 18 and in her was found the
[1:34:35] blood of prophets and of saints and of
[1:34:38] all that were slain upon the Earth of
[1:34:42] all that were slain every we know every
[1:34:44] war was instigated by like CH chinu says
[1:34:48] the majority of all wars were started by
[1:34:50] the
[1:34:51] Jesuits for gain for division to lower
[1:34:56] populations so that they could come back
[1:34:58] in and bring what they did was they
[1:35:00] after the Civil War they recruited a
[1:35:02] whole bunch of Catholics from overseas
[1:35:03] and to them
[1:35:07] reproduce I overpopulate
[1:35:10] cath exactly
[1:35:12] right I just talked with a certain
[1:35:14] brother yesterday and he said what do
[1:35:16] you think the Baby Boomers were the
[1:35:18] priest went in after the war and said
[1:35:20] start populating many men have died
[1:35:23] populate populate and now the the
[1:35:26] households went up to 8 10 15 children
[1:35:30] in the
[1:35:34] household and her was slain upon all the
[1:35:38] Earth so what are we getting at
[1:35:41] here what kind of children are
[1:35:44] these bless
[1:35:46] you in Exodus 20 and 13 the Bible says
[1:35:51] Thou shalt not kill
[1:35:55] amen Thou shalt not kill
[1:36:04] yes that is a commandment yeah amen
[1:36:07] Christ did not come to do away with the
[1:36:09] law but to fulfill the law did Christ
[1:36:11] kill anyone not one he didn't even kill
[1:36:16] Satan he let him
[1:36:20] live or any of the Demons he let him
[1:36:22] live
[1:36:25] what kind of children are
[1:36:27] these and you have he quickened who were
[1:36:30] dead in trespasses and sins whereof in
[1:36:32] times past you walked according to the
[1:36:34] course of this world according to the
[1:36:36] prince of the power there the spirit
[1:36:38] that now worketh in the children of
[1:36:42] Disobedience yes if there's ever a
[1:36:44] scripture that says to do one thing a
[1:36:46] certain way they will always do it
[1:36:49] Opposite amen they will fail to hearken
[1:36:53] to the word of God they are children of
[1:36:56] Disobedience
[1:36:58] yes among whom also we had our
[1:37:00] conversation time passing the lust of
[1:37:02] the flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[1:37:03] Flesh and of the mind and were by nature
[1:37:05] is the children of Wrath even as
[1:37:09] others Ephesians
[1:37:11] 5 and six let no man deceive you with
[1:37:14] vain words for because of these things
[1:37:16] cometh the wrath of God upon the
[1:37:18] children of
[1:37:21] Disobedience what is the main I like
[1:37:24] this if you had to follow this seed line
[1:37:26] the main characteristic would they would
[1:37:28] always disobey the word of God Cain
[1:37:31] disobeyed the word of God even when
[1:37:33] revealed to him amen bam knew not the
[1:37:37] curse and yet he still did what he did
[1:37:40] yes complete
[1:37:42] Disobedience Esau when he found out this
[1:37:45] then he went married someone that he
[1:37:46] shouldn't even have married complete
[1:37:48] Disobedience as M wasn't even happy
[1:37:51] yes right does it say twice no what it
[1:37:54] says three times in the scripture the
[1:37:57] Bible calls them children of
[1:38:00] Disobedience mortify Therefore your
[1:38:03] members which are upon the Earth
[1:38:04] fornication and cleanliness in ordinate
[1:38:06] affection evil concupisent and
[1:38:08] covetousness which is idul for these
[1:38:11] things sake the wrath of God cometh upon
[1:38:14] the children of
[1:38:17] Disobedience what is Disobedience much
[1:38:19] like iniquity yes what is Iniquity
[1:38:22] knowing to do right but not doing it
[1:38:25] what is what is Matthew 7 Lord Lord have
[1:38:28] we not done this and have we not done
[1:38:29] that and the Bible says he says I never
[1:38:31] knew you workers of iniquity that's
[1:38:33] right and yet these knew to do right
[1:38:36] they know it's wrong to do this it's
[1:38:38] wrong to do that they know
[1:38:40] it
[1:38:42] yes in which ye also walked sometimes
[1:38:46] when you lived in them thanks be to God
[1:38:49] we're out of that by the grace of God
[1:38:51] Amen let's just give our Lord and savior
[1:38:57] thank you for saving us Lord hallelujah
[1:38:59] thank you
[1:39:00] Jesus
[1:39:03] now now that's the natural that's
[1:39:06] absolutely natural and you can go
[1:39:08] through history I I just Dove a little
[1:39:10] bit on the internet just looking at
[1:39:12] things I I spent probably half an hour
[1:39:13] an hour maybe that's it just finding
[1:39:15] those little
[1:39:16] things what if we actually really just
[1:39:19] dove into it the the evidence is over
[1:39:23] overwhelming what the Catholic church
[1:39:25] has done yes I did read a couple
[1:39:27] Catholics and they oh that was that's
[1:39:29] just hearsay that's
[1:39:33] a Liars lie lie lie I'm to the point
[1:39:38] where you you look at everything in the
[1:39:39] news you look at everything I I question
[1:39:42] everything now literally even even the
[1:39:44] history that was taught uhh even science
[1:39:47] I I I question everything now what is
[1:39:50] truth you know what's truth is the word
[1:39:52] of God
[1:39:54] if there is a scientific theory that
[1:39:56] does not line up the word of God it is
[1:39:59] false straight up if there's anything
[1:40:02] that's contrary to the world this is is
[1:40:04] that's contrary to this it's a lie yes
[1:40:07] right this is our filter the word of God
[1:40:09] amen amen
[1:40:12] sure now the end result is always the
[1:40:16] Bloodshed but everything works up to
[1:40:22] it and you people with these sawblade
[1:40:25] tempers it's always spouting off of the
[1:40:27] mouth that somebody can't put up and
[1:40:29] things like that be careful he says he
[1:40:32] says you're guilty if you speak one word
[1:40:34] against your brother that's not
[1:40:38] right not just go around and tear go
[1:40:41] around and tear it down you don't have
[1:40:43] to stick a knife in a man's back to kill
[1:40:45] him you can break his character and kill
[1:40:50] him he says kill his influence speak
[1:40:52] against your pastor here say something
[1:40:54] bad about him you just might as well
[1:40:56] shot
[1:40:57] him the Bible says touch not my
[1:41:00] anointing
[1:41:04] amen that's why communion is so he say
[1:41:07] communion is so important not Discerning
[1:41:09] the body of Christ what is the body of
[1:41:11] Christ you right
[1:41:14] right we must speak well to one another
[1:41:17] brothers and sisters

[1:41:23] the
[1:41:25] same told something that wasn't right
[1:41:28] about him well you just killed his
[1:41:29] influence with the people and things
[1:41:30] like that and you're guilty of what
[1:41:32] Jesus
[1:41:34] said there as brother Jesse mentioned
[1:41:36] this morning there's something took
[1:41:38] place a year
[1:41:40] ago and it was literal spiritual an
[1:41:43] assassination it was a martyrdom a
[1:41:45] spiritual martyr I called the brother
[1:41:48] says brother I may not have suffered In
[1:41:50] the Flesh he says but I've been
[1:41:51] spiritually martyred I said absolutely
[1:41:54] brother and these men are guilty of
[1:41:57] bringing that brother
[1:42:00] down I don't know where he's at now but
[1:42:03] when I called him a year ago he had not
[1:42:06] said anything that was said about
[1:42:09] him
[1:42:11] amen got to be very very careful yes now
[1:42:14] look what the Bible says here he says if
[1:42:16] you have heard that hath been said an
[1:42:18] eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth but I
[1:42:19] say unto you that you that ye resist he

[1:42:45] resist and fleas and he said he stuck
[1:42:47] out his neck and says I'll see the Lord

[1:42:51] blew those two men back to the wall and
[1:42:52] they took got repented at his feet and

[1:47:07] we ought to lay down our lives for our
[1:47:09] Brethren where's that scripture
[1:47:12] again yes amen
[1:47:15] amen praise be to God now let's stand
[1:47:18] here we're wow we're hour 10 let's stand
[1:47:20] here just a little run through
[1:47:23] here of that
[1:47:26] trail I hope you got to see what kind of
[1:47:28] trail that
[1:47:30] is and obviously I I
[1:47:33] I I did bring some stuff there that was
[1:47:36] a little maybe
[1:47:38] harder it's not be it's not a beautiful
[1:47:41] thing it's U it's
[1:47:46] reality it's what our forefathers
[1:47:50] fled many of them came to America
[1:47:53] running from that
[1:47:54] stuff running from real persecution
[1:47:57] wanting Freedom wanting those sort of
[1:48:00] things and uh as the prophet said he
[1:48:02] says they will rise again to
[1:48:09] kill and saints of God they are children
[1:48:11] of
[1:48:12] Disobedience that's constantly
[1:48:14] disobeying the word of
[1:48:19] God but saints of God if they are
[1:48:21] children of Disobedience that makes us
[1:48:23] the children of obedience amen amen when
[1:48:26] we read the scriptures when we read the
[1:48:27] word when we listen to tapes when we
[1:48:29] study when we think on the Lord we want
[1:48:31] to be obedient to the voice of God Amen
[1:48:35] we want to be obedient to the word of
[1:48:37] God we want to continue Lord give me
[1:48:40] more strength increase my faith yes show
[1:48:43] me what you'd have me to be glory
[1:48:45] because Christ himself had to learn
[1:48:48] obedience what is obedience laying down
[1:48:50] your own will
[1:48:56] not brother what brother Simon wants to
[1:48:58] do you don't want to do
[1:49:01] that you want to do what the Lord Jesus
[1:49:03] Christ wants you to do amen amen yes and
[1:49:08] being made perfect he became the author
[1:49:10] of eternal life sorry the author of
[1:49:12] Eternal salvation unto all them that
[1:49:15] obey him so the way one of the ways to
[1:49:18] eternal life is through obedience amen
[1:49:21] amen and children these other children
[1:49:24] can never receive eternal life because
[1:49:25] they are not
[1:49:27] obedient
[1:49:31] yes that's
[1:49:35] simple the god of our fathers raised up
[1:49:37] Jesus whom you slew on a hang and hanged
[1:49:39] on a tree him ha God exalted with his
[1:49:42] right hand to be a prince and a savior
[1:49:43] for to give repentance to Israel and
[1:49:45] forgiveness of sins and we are his
[1:49:47] Witnesses of these things and so is also
[1:49:50] the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to to
[1:49:52] them that obey him amen and when they
[1:49:57] heard when they heard that notice what
[1:50:00] realm it hit their flesh realm went to
[1:50:03] their
[1:50:05] hearing and it quickened
[1:50:08] something and they were cut to the heart
[1:50:10] and took counsel to slay them just by
[1:50:13] hearing this word of God just hearing
[1:50:16] hey we have to you all you have to do is
[1:50:18] obey the word of it's the same thing God
[1:50:21] told Cain just obey and do as your
[1:50:23] brother says here they said just obey
[1:50:26] and you'll get the Holy Ghost and that
[1:50:28] made them upset
[1:50:38] right now them that are such uh are such
[1:50:41] we command command and exhort by our
[1:50:44] Lord Jesus Christ that with quietness
[1:50:46] they work and eat their own bread but ye
[1:50:49] Brethren be not weary in well-doing and
[1:50:51] if any man obey not not our word by this
[1:50:54] epistle note that man and have no in
[1:50:57] other words hey guys he will not he
[1:51:00] refuses to do this the Bible says to not
[1:51:03] him make a mark of him just yeah that's
[1:51:06] that's the guy he says and have no
[1:51:09] company with him that he may be ashamed
[1:51:11] yet count him as not as an enemy where's
[1:51:13] this on the Catholic church yet count
[1:51:15] him not as an enemy but admonish him as
[1:51:17] a brother treat him like your own
