Description:
Two scientific publications from 2015 and 2017 declare snakes have DNA that once support limbs. This discovery helps prove William Branham's "Serpent Seed" teaching was Biblically accurate because he taught the serpent was an upright, standing creature before God cursed him and made him go upon his belly.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] but remember god told him that his legs would come off and he'd go on his belly and you can't find one bone in a snake it looks like a human being and that's reason science is lost greetings friends in the matches name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to share more evidence that the serpent seed teaching is the eternal truth of god i'll reference two publications also review the nine proofs of the serpent seed teaching and again define the trees and fruits from the garden of eden and genesis chapter 3. the two publications are first an article called blueprint for limbs encoded in the snake genome from the university of georgia 2015 and the second publication is national geographic kids september 2017. in october 2015 the university of georgia discovered snakes once had legs researchers reported snakes have dna that controls the development and growth of limbs so seven years ago when i saw this article i was very pleasantly surprised because it lines up with the bible revelation about the serpent before the fall the serpent was an upright creature before the fall because after the fall in verse 14 of genesis chapter 3 god curses the serpent to go on his belly the rest of his days so originally the serpent was likely an upright creature between something like a chimpanzee and a man but closer to a man because he was standing upright and able to carry on in intellectual conversation with the deceived eve two years later my children were reading a national geographic kids magazine in september 2017 and one of my children brought the magazine up to me and showed me this picture which i'll show it to you right now and the article said snakes once had legs so it's likely national geographic kids magazine was referencing this article from the university of georgia friend god's word and his revelation are eternally true even in regards to snakes and the serpent seed so again before the fall the serpent was an upright standing creature the bible said he was more subtle which means shrewd slyer crafty than any beast of the field that the lord god had made he was the only beast god made with the ability to talk with intellectual reasoning when satan observed those human-like characteristics in the serpent satan selected the serpent to possess him so he could deceive eve because remember the scripture says satan was present in eden in ezekiel 28 13. the bible is clear the serpent originally had legs he stood upon but because he submitted to satan and then deceived eve god cursed him took off his legs changed every bone in his body as god's prophet brother branham but taught god told him that his legs would come off and he'd go on his belly and you can't find one bone in a snake it looks like a human being and that's reason science is lost but there he is hid it from the eyes of the wives and prudent and promised to reveal it to the sons of god in the last days when the sons of god be made manifest he said serpent now he was a reptile then he was able to settle with all the beasts in the field and he said kirsten is you and he took his legs from him and up on his belly and go all the days of his life that should be as neat and he hated that's where he is today let's review the nine proofs that the serpent seed teaching is correct evidence number one the bible supports the serpent seed doctrine from genesis to revelation moses jesus paul peter and john all support the serpent serpent-seed teaching through their writings or their words evidence two the two trees in the midst of the garden were not literal trees because the tree of knowledge of good and evil was not good for food genesis 2 verse 9 says every tree out of the ground was good for food proving the tree of knowledge of good and evil was not a regular tree because when eve partook of its fruit sin and death occurred two truths about this evil tree are evident first it didn't come from the ground and its fruit was not good for food any tree whose fruit will kill you isn't good for food evidence three the tree of life was jesus's spirit because there is only one way to eternal life evidence 4 the serpent seed explains the purpose of the virgin birth of jesus evidence 5 adam and eve covered their loins after eating of the forbidden fruit evidence 6 god's punishments for eve's sin centered on her sexual reproduction and longing for adam evidence 7 the serpent was human-like before the fall this proof was discussed earlier in the video evidence 8 cain was the serpent's son and not adams in evidence number nine the seed of the woman was a literal man jesus and so the seed of the serpent was a literal man cain now we'll define the trees and fruits from genesis chapter 3. the two trees in the midst of the garden known as a tree of life and tree of knowledge of good and evil were symbolic of the two spirits of jesus christ and satan these two trees were not literal trees like all the other trees in the garden as proven by genesis 2 verse 9. god's prophet brother branham said jesus christ is the tree of life in the church age book he said satan was a tree of knowledge of good and evil the scriptures prove this to be true because there are numerous verses that call jesus life or eternal life such as first john chapter 5 verses 11 and 20 and then john 14 6 says jesus is the only life and jesus said satan is the father of lies and a murder from the beginning and he only comes to steal kill and destroy so satan must be the father or tree of death now you could also call the tree of knowledge of good and evil the antichrist spirit or the spirit of death or the spirit of unbelief these are just synonyms for what satan is all about these are the characteristics of satan's spirit and of course the opposite of satan is jesus the tree of life eternal life the forbidden fruit that he part took of in genesis 3 verse 6 was an act of sexual adultery with the serpent not a literal apple as some erroneously believe proverbs 30 verse 20 and song of psalm 4 verses 12 through chapter 5 verse 1 clearly teach that eating can be symbolic of sexual relations proverbs 30 verse 20 such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith i have done no wickedness song of solomon 5 verse 1 i am coming to my garden my sister my spouse i have gathered my myrrh with my spice i have eaten my honeycomb with my honey i have drunk my wine with my milk eat oh friends drink yay drink abundantly o beloved there are other verses as well that show the eating of fruit was symbolic of sexual intercourse such as second corinthians 11 verses 2 and 3 and romans chapter seven verses one through five a fruit is the end result of a seed and the serpent's lie to eve that she would not surely die if she partook of the fruit was a spiritual seed or thought that was planted in her mind that lie or seed that was planted in her mind eventually came into fruition and produced the fruit of an adulterous act with the serpent which god recognized by stating that the serpent's seed would have hatred against the woman's seed so eve partook of this fruit with the serpent the fruit of adultery and then shared this fruit with adam who also partook of the fruit i had a good question on an email saying what fruit did adam partake of and the answer is unlawful sexual relations adam was rebelling against the word of god that was already written in heaven in relation to marriage and divorce we know psalm 119 verse 89 says forever o lord thy word is settled in heaven so god had a law for marriage already written in heaven and we're not sure whether adam knew it or not but adam broke that law and that law is actually recorded in deuteronomy 22 verses 22 and 23 if a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto a husband and a man find her in the city and lie with her then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city and he shall stone them with stones that they die the damsel because she cried out being in the city and the man because he hath humbled his neighbor's wife so thou shalt put away evil from among you so here's the scripture that shows adam's rebellion against the word of god so according to god's word adam was not to take eve back because she'd already had sexual relations with the serpent so again the fruit adam partooka with e was unlawful sexual relations and friends brother and taught us in the church age book in chapter three let's listen to the quote now i know when answering one question another one is apt to come up and people ask me if eve fell that way what did adam do for god lays the blame on adam that is simple the word of god is forever settled in heaven before one speck of stardust was made that word god's law was there exactly as it is written in our bible now the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man she is an adulteress and is no longer married and the husband is not to take her back that word was true in eden as it was true when moses wrote it in the law the word can't change adam took her back he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyway she was a part of him and he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself he would not let her go so eve conceived by him he knew she would he knew exactly what would happen to the human race and he sold the human race into sin that he might have eve for he loved her so friends now you see that eve should have died for her adulterous act but adam loved her so much and knew that she was a part of him so he took her back yet it was a rebellion to the word of god but god was gracious and merciful and allowed this to be a type of christ in the church because any human in eve situation or adam's situation would have done the same all humans would have fallen short of the glory of god and sinned and god wanted to express his attribute as a redeemer of the fallen sinful humanity so just as adam saw his wife defiled yet could not put her away so christ knows the church would be defiled but still took her back because she was a part of him as the bible says we were chosen in christ before the foundation of the world we were in the mind and the plan of almighty god notice adam willingly sinned with eve so redemption story is seen in eve's life first in adam willingly sinning adam knew he would die if he took of the forbidden fruit but he loved eve too much to live without her she was a part of him so he took her sin upon himself trusting god's mercy to redeem them eve was deceived in her sin but adam wasn't according to first timothy chapter 2 this is allegorical of christ willingly taking all sin upon himself and dying on the cross for our redemption remember jesus is called the last adam in first corinthians 15 verse 45 because he is the true faithful adam where adam failed jesus conquered so if jesus is the last adam then the bride church the holy ghost-filled church must be the last eve the obedient one desiring only her husband and she will not be deceived in closing i hope this video has been a blessing friends as i said recently i've received numerous emails asking questions about the serpency teaching so i thought i'd make a video to help people with these specific questions also those two publications are important and i didn't know how many people had seen them so i wanted to share them as well friends god's word is true and his revelation is correct the serpents see doctrine doesn't save but it does shine more light on the gospel truth we're all trying to see and the seed of the serpent that's the killer many people don't believe that but if you'll just read in genesis the bible said that the serpent had a seed and i'll put enmity between the serpent seed and the woman's seed so the serpent had a seed and the serpent seed was spiritual thing jesus was not a man so the woman's seed was spiritual they both had seeds and the enmity is still there a serpent had a seed and if you just take your bible and get out and be a real reverend before god i believe god will reveal it to you and if you do not understand it i'm i'm available any time to do my very best to help you by a letter or by or by personal interview or anything that i could do to help you of course we realize that that doesn't save a man neither does it condemn a man but it only brings light upon the subject that we're all trying so hard to get the people to see it only brings life if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
