[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] many of you strangers perhaps hear these
[0:05] men get up and make make these remarks
[0:06] about a message of this hour and so
[0:09] forth what they are getting at is God's
[0:12] promise of this hour that he promised
[0:14] what he would do and we seem
[0:16] scripturally vindicating just exactly
[0:19] what he said he would do in the same
[0:20] manner foretold it's just exactly
[0:24] perfectly each time because it's God
[0:26] saying
[0:27] it greetings friends in the mattress
[0:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:31] purpose of this video is to give my top
[0:34] 10 Bible revelations that should be
[0:36] taught to new message Believers recently
[0:38] I was asked which teachings from the
[0:41] Bible I would recommend to a new message
[0:43] believer so I thought I'd make this
[0:44] video by the grace of God hi friends I'm
[0:47] Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ
[0:48] Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I
[0:52] defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ that
[0:54] he revealed to St Paul and then had to
[0:56] restore through his late Prophet William
[0:58] Marian brandham 190 9 to 1965 and I also
[1:02] defend brother Ram's Godly Christian
[1:03] character so it was difficult coming up
[1:06] with this top 10 list I used two top 10
[1:09] lists to kind of help me make my top 10
[1:11] list the first top 10 list I used was
[1:14] from Brother Jason dears he's another
[1:16] message Minister he's preached at our
[1:18] church before he has a podcast and
[1:20] YouTube channel that defends the message
[1:22] I really appreciate his ministry one of
[1:24] his recent podcasts he listed his top 11
[1:28] teachings to introduce them message and
[1:31] then in the email request I received to
[1:33] make this video this new message
[1:35] believer mentioned the Wikipedia list
[1:39] about bromism and of course I don't
[1:41] believe in bromism I'm just a holy ghost
[1:43] filed Christian but that Wikipedia site
[1:46] has about nine doctrines so I'll leave
[1:48] links in the descriptions to both of
[1:50] those lists Jason dear's podcast and
[1:52] then the Wikipedia bromism list but
[1:56] let's begin my list my first teaching
[1:58] from the Bible is water bap AP ISM in
[2:00] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[2:02] reason I put this first is because
[2:03] brother brand often said salvation is
[2:06] Major brother BR would say certain
[2:08] doctrines don't pertain to Salvation of
[2:10] course water baptism is the moment
[2:11] you're saved or right around the moment
[2:14] you're saved many scriptures teach this
[2:16] such as Mark chapter 16 he that
[2:19] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[2:21] Acts 2
[2:23] 36-38 Men and Brethren what shall we do
[2:26] Peter said repent and be baptized every
[2:27] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:30] we also see in Acts chapter 8 with
[2:32] Philip and the unic the unic asked what
[2:35] hinders me to be baptized and Philip
[2:37] said if you believe with all your heart
[2:38] you can be baptized so he was
[2:40] immediately baptized upon the Revelation
[2:43] that Jesus Christ is the Son of God the
[2:45] propit for sins and of course we must
[2:48] use the literal name of the Lord Jesus
[2:50] Christ I had a video about that recently
[2:52] about the power and the name of the Lord
[2:54] Jesus Christ Colossians 3:17 says do all
[2:57] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:58] Christ so we must baptize in the name of
[3:01] the Lord Jesus Christ cast out devils in
[3:03] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ do
[3:04] miracles in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:06] Christ pray in the name of the Lord
[3:08] Jesus Christ everything is done in the
[3:09] name of our Lord Jesus Christ and of
[3:12] course here's that chart for five water
[3:15] baptisms in the book of Acts and they
[3:16] all use either Lord Jesus Jesus Christ
[3:19] or Lord and so we can see the Revelation
[3:21] for the one name of the father son Holy
[3:23] Ghost is the Lord Jesus
[3:25] Christ remember it's Satan's job to
[3:28] blaspheme the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:29] Christ we see that in Revelation 13:6
[3:33] the three-fold blasphemy he blasphemes
[3:35] the name of God the Tabernacle of God
[3:37] and the saints of God so that's what the
[3:39] Roman Catholic Church did they changed
[3:41] water baptism from the literal name to
[3:43] the titles father son Holy Ghost they
[3:45] call Rome the Eternal City that's
[3:47] blasphemy the Eternal City is the New
[3:49] Jerusalem and of course they blasphemed
[3:51] the Saints by teaching billions of
[3:53] people to pray to the dead Saints
[3:54] there's only one mediator between God
[3:56] and man the man Christ Jesus I recently
[3:59] heard about random say in the breach
[4:01] 1963 that when John was weeping and no
[4:04] man was worthy to come and look at the
[4:06] book and take the book brother raham
[4:08] said John did not see a thousand
[4:10] Catholic saints mediators John saw the
[4:13] lamb the me the one mediator between God
[4:16] and man the man Christ Jesus he didn't
[4:18] see St Cecilia St Joseph and all these
[4:21] other Saints to mediate and pray for
[4:23] people he saw Jesus Christ what's he
[4:26] been he's been an intercessor
[4:29] no other person tell me where Mary can
[4:33] make intercessions then
[4:35] amen what could Mar offer what could St
[4:40] Francis St aisia or any St Cecilia
[4:43] brother or any other Human
[4:47] Being John never saw a thousand saints
[4:50] come out from the mediatorial he saw a
[4:58] lamb Hallelujah
[5:00] a lamb that have been slain
[5:03] bloody I don't care how many Saints have
[5:06] been slain there were all do it every
[5:10] one of them like the thief said at the
[5:11] cross we've sinned and we were doing
[5:13] this but this man's done
[5:16] nothing he was the only man that was
[5:19] worthy remember friends I have 14
[5:21] references from encyclopedias britanicas
[5:23] almanacs all saying the same thing that
[5:26] water baptism was initially performed in
[5:28] the literal name of the Lord Lord Jesus
[5:30] Christ but then around 100 AD water
[5:33] baptism began being changed by the
[5:35] deceived people into the titles father
[5:37] son Holy Ghost and when a new believer
[5:40] gets started off on justification they
[5:41] want to start the right way using the
[5:43] name of the Lord Jesus Christ of course
[5:46] I'll leave video links in the
[5:47] description to teachings about water
[5:50] baptism second I recommend the godhead
[5:54] teaching how there's one person in the
[5:55] godhead not three in my 2021 book I show
[5:59] eight prop problems with the Trinity
[6:00] Dogma it's a man-made Dogma the Trinity
[6:03] Dogma was formed around 300 years after
[6:06] the apostles had died so it was not
[6:08] formed by the apostles it wasn't
[6:10] established by St Paul it's a
[6:12] non-biblical false Dogma remember the
[6:15] warnings in Proverbs 530 and 6 and
[6:17] Revelation 22:18 and 19 we cannot add to
[6:20] the Bible the Trinity Dogma adds the
[6:22] words three persons to the Bible real
[6:24] Bible Believers will not add anything to
[6:27] the word of God of course I'm entire
[6:29] chapter on this in my 2021 book it's
[6:31] chapter 1 because God gets preeminence
[6:34] God is first in our hearts and this
[6:36] Trinity Dogma is also seen in Matthew
[6:39] 13:33 Jesus told a parable about how a
[6:41] woman would add Le to three measures a
[6:43] meal and that's what the Roman Catholic
[6:45] Church did it added the sin of a false
[6:48] Doctrine into God's
[6:51] tri-unity his three manifestations of
[6:53] father son Holy Ghost and look what that
[6:56] leaven has done to the entire Catholic
[6:58] dogma or Catholic Doctrine a little leav
[7:01] leavens the whole lump now the entire
[7:03] lump of Catholic teaching is completely
[7:06] sinful it's completely corrupted and of
[7:09] course I'll leave links in the video
[7:11] description to this third I would
[7:13] introduce brother Ram's prophetic
[7:15] Ministry I have an entire chapter
[7:16] dedicated this in my 2021 book is
[7:18] chapter 13 there are six portions of
[7:21] scripture that brother Brandon fulfilled
[7:22] acts 3:20 and 21 Matthew 171 and 12
[7:27] Malachi 45 and 6 Revelation 101 1-7 Amos
[7:31] 37 and Luke 17:30 the reason I put this
[7:35] third is because if you're going to a
[7:36] message church if you're a new message
[7:38] believer you're going to hear people say
[7:40] especially the preacher say brother
[7:41] random said just like if you lived in
[7:43] the 16th century you'd hear a lot of
[7:44] people say Martin Luther said cuz he was
[7:47] the messenger for that hour brother
[7:49] Ram's Ministry was so powerful so
[7:51] instrumental to millions of Believers
[7:53] including me my life has been literally
[7:56] transformed by the Holy Ghost through
[7:57] brother Ram's Ministry his Revelations
[8:00] from the Bible which are from Jesus
[8:02] Christ are what I base my entire 18
[8:04] years of pastoring ministry upon plus I
[8:07] preached two years before that as a
[8:09] teacher and evangelist in my first home
[8:11] church so I've been preaching 20 years
[8:13] and I based my entire Ministry on this
[8:15] bible-based ministry of William brandham
[8:18] I'll leave video links in the
[8:19] description I have five videos on
[8:21] brother brandham as the messenger to
[8:22] this age six thus sayith Lords that have
[8:25] been fulfilled proving brother random
[8:26] was a prophet future Prophecies of
[8:28] brother brandham that are yet to be
[8:29] fulfilled the brown bear Vision explains
[8:32] how God deals with prophets and Visions
[8:35] that's a very important video and again
[8:37] the audio book to my 13th chapter in my
[8:41] 2021 book on the 12 New Testament
[8:43] Mysteries
[8:44] revealed fourth the baptism of the Holy
[8:46] Ghost I have entire chapter dedicated to
[8:48] this mystery it's called a mystery in
[8:50] Colossians 1:26-27 Christ in you the
[8:53] hope of glory now the chapter is chapter
[8:55] 6 in my 2021 book this is such an
[8:58] important chapter it's hard to
[8:59] overemphasize the importance of this
[9:01] teaching from the Bible here you see the
[9:03] three parts of man body Soul and Spirit
[9:05] from 1 Thessalonians 5:23 you also see
[9:08] how Jesus said the Holy Ghost can only
[9:10] be given in the soul after he was
[9:12] resurrected according to John 7:37
[9:15] through 39 and also Matthew 11
[9:19] 28-30 Jesus would give rest for the soul
[9:22] in the Old Testament they had rest for
[9:24] the mind and the body but not for the
[9:25] soul that's because the blood of bulls
[9:28] and goats could could not take away sin
[9:29] but now because of the blood of Jesus
[9:31] Christ it can take away sins and now the
[9:34] Holy Ghost can abide and seal our souls
[9:36] until the day of redemption this chapter
[9:38] also includes the evidence for the
[9:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's being
[9:42] guided into all truth of course that
[9:43] means having the fruits of the spirit it
[9:46] means receiving the word for your day
[9:48] and of course if you're guided into all
[9:50] truth you'll receive all the Revelation
[9:52] in the Bible for your day so the
[9:54] evidence of the Holy Ghost is a very
[9:55] important topic I have a video on that
[9:57] as well I'll leave that in the
[9:58] description and also here we see that
[10:00] there's one ceiling for the soul there's
[10:03] one filling for the soul there's not
[10:05] many ceilings for the soul there's not
[10:07] many feelings for the soul some people
[10:09] are confused about that that's according
[10:11] to Ephesians 4:30 and Romans 8:23 we're
[10:15] sealed unto the day of our Redemption
[10:17] which is the day we get a brand new body
[10:19] either theophany or glorified depending
[10:22] on if we live to the Rapture or not and
[10:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[10:26] soul is so important it's the token or
[10:28] ticket to the pre-tribulation Rapture I
[10:31] didn't put the Rapture in this top 10
[10:32] teaching because what's most important
[10:34] is that you receive the token for the
[10:36] Rapture the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[10:39] and then it doesn't matter if you
[10:40] understand everything about the Rapture
[10:41] or not as long as you've got the spirit
[10:43] of Christ in you you'll go in the
[10:44] Rapture so we must focus on getting the
[10:46] oil or the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[10:49] we're prepared for the Rapture and of
[10:51] course I'll leave video links in the
[10:52] description for this topic as well the
[10:55] fifth topic is the three works of Grace
[10:57] this is also known as the stature of
[10:58] perfect man I have an entire chapter
[11:00] devoted this in my 2021 book it's
[11:02] chapter 5 the Bible calls it the mystery
[11:04] of godliness brother Rand said it's
[11:06] godliness restored to man how has
[11:08] godliness restored to the man it's
[11:10] through God adding to you Faith virtue
[11:12] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[11:14] brotherly kindness and then charity to
[11:16] cap off the stature of the person the
[11:19] stature of the Holy Ghost filled
[11:21] Christian there's a very helpful chart
[11:22] in my 20121 book it's figure 14 and it
[11:26] shows all these Bible proofs of three
[11:28] works of Grace not four works of Grace
[11:30] Three works of Grace so I'll put that on
[11:33] the screen here you can pause that and
[11:34] look at that I'm trying to conserve time
[11:37] the three works of Grace is so important
[11:38] it guards you against false conversions
[11:41] many accusers of brother brandom and
[11:43] also just regular denominational people
[11:45] they make the great mistake of saying
[11:47] there's only one work of Grace and they
[11:49] deny all these Bible truths Bible
[11:52] revelations like the chart they deny
[11:54] scores of Bible verses that's what
[11:56] chapter 5 is devoted to in my book
[11:58] giving all the Bible verses that teach
[12:00] the three works of Grace and it's a
[12:01] shame it's so sad these people accusers
[12:03] of brother brandom and you know
[12:05] denominational people will say there's
[12:06] only one work of Grace so for example
[12:08] when a six-year-old will repent of their
[12:10] sins and be baptized and get saved
[12:12] they'll tell that six-year-old you're
[12:13] already filled with the Holy Ghost and
[12:15] of course that six-year-old is not
[12:16] filled with the Holy Ghost they're
[12:18] simply Justified they've started their
[12:20] walk with God but they got to learn to
[12:21] be Sanctified and then they got to have
[12:23] an experience where they're filled with
[12:24] the Holy Ghost this chapter is also
[12:26] important because it shows people can
[12:27] fail Grace or for fit salvation and
[12:30] their names are blotted out of the book
[12:32] of life there are numerous Bible verses
[12:34] about this I just preached on this to
[12:36] The Junction City Saints I'll try to get
[12:37] that sermon up soon but God said he
[12:39] would blot out names of people that do
[12:41] not overcome he'll blot out names of
[12:43] people that blaspheme he'll blot out the
[12:45] names of people that sin against him and
[12:47] don't repent so of course I'll leave
[12:50] video links in the description of this
[12:51] subject number six is Modesty and
[12:53] Holiness this is a sanctification
[12:55] teaching in other words after you get
[12:57] saved God will move you into this area
[12:59] so you can be Sanctified which means
[13:01] purified and set apart from profane
[13:03] things and of course a person knew the
[13:05] message will see right away when they
[13:07] walk into a sanctuary how different the
[13:09] sisters look so modesty and Holiness is
[13:11] the most visible public difference
[13:13] between Christians especially wise and
[13:15] foolish virgins I wrote a book on this
[13:17] in 2019 restoring Christian modesty I
[13:19] wanted to fully prove by the Bible and
[13:21] history that is God's perfect will for
[13:24] us to obey these Bible commands about
[13:27] modesty Holiness and the outward
[13:28] appearance
[13:30] one chapter in particular is so powerful
[13:32] it shows the historical events that led
[13:34] to Western Society rejecting these Bible
[13:37] Holiness standards decade by decade
[13:40] remember friends it's dishonorable for a
[13:42] woman to cut her hair a Christian woman
[13:44] and dishonorable means repulsive in the
[13:46] Greek which means disgusting so it's a
[13:49] disgusting thing for a woman to dishonor
[13:52] a husband by cutting her hair that's
[13:54] thus sayith the scripture that's 1
[13:56] Corinthians 11:5 and my challenge to
[13:59] accusers brother random and of course
[14:00] any person is show me one scripture
[14:03] where God asked a Godly woman to cut her
[14:05] hair there is no Bible verse God never
[14:09] asked a Godly woman to cut her hair so
[14:11] of course I'll leave video links uh in
[14:13] the description to these subjects and
[14:15] also include makeup and the Bible that's
[14:18] my most popular YouTube video over these
[14:20] last 10 years makeup is a worldly thing
[14:23] it's a sin only evil women wore makeup
[14:26] in the Bible there's four or five verses
[14:28] on that as well
[14:30] seventh is the teaching on the serpent
[14:31] seed this is part of the mystery of
[14:33] iniquity from 2 Thessalonians 2:7 it's
[14:36] in chapter 10 in my 2021 book there's
[14:39] nine evidences that support the serpent
[14:41] Seed doctrine and I've never seen anyone
[14:44] disprove even one of them because
[14:46] they're all based upon the Bible and
[14:48] friends this is not a racist Doctrine at
[14:50] all at the beginning of time the serpent
[14:53] seed was a natural seed but then by the
[14:57] time Noah and his sons got into the ark
[15:00] and then God repopulated the Earth the
[15:02] natural seed of mankind had all been
[15:04] corrupted through the serpent seed so
[15:05] now God has to do a spiritual seed which
[15:08] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's
[15:10] the word of God it's Christ in you the
[15:12] hope of glory according to 1 Peter 1:23
[15:15] and of course Colossians 1 26 and 27 God
[15:18] must give us a spiritual seed to be in
[15:20] his family the natural seed line natural
[15:23] DNA doesn't matter anymore and I love
[15:25] serpent SE because it's taught literally
[15:27] from Genesis to Rev ation and recently
[15:30] God gave us a great Revelation on that
[15:32] we see serpent seed in the Seven Seals
[15:34] we see it in Revelation 5 the only one
[15:37] worthy to take the book of redemption
[15:39] and reveal it was the one who'd been
[15:41] born by virgin birth that's because sin
[15:44] came into the world through adultery and
[15:46] adulterous act so Redemption had to come
[15:49] in the world through a virgin birth God
[15:51] had to bypass the way that sin came into
[15:52] the world it's a beautiful Revelation
[15:54] brother B preached it in the breach 1963
[15:57] so this teaching explains why Jesus had
[15:59] to be born of a virgin birth and of
[16:01] course I'll leave video links to this in
[16:03] the description number eight is the four
[16:06] classes of Believers I taught on this in
[16:08] chapter 8 my 2021 book it's part of the
[16:10] mystery of the kingdom of God from
[16:12] Matthew 13: 3-9 and 18 through 23 this
[16:16] is another teaching that's Genesis the
[16:18] Revelation it's a beautiful Revelation I
[16:20] have a simple figure on this on page 504
[16:22] of my book it's figure number
[16:26] 21 this is so important because it
[16:28] explains how every person in human
[16:30] history falls into one of these four
[16:32] classes you have wise virgin foolish
[16:35] virgin make believer unbeliever and
[16:37] brother Ram caught the revelation of
[16:38] this throughout his entire Ministry but
[16:40] really taught the clear teaching on it
[16:42] in the church age book released December
[16:45] 1965 and of course for us the most
[16:47] important aspect of this is making sure
[16:48] we're wise virgin and not foolish virgin
[16:51] Peter tells us to make our calling and
[16:52] election sure and as Jesus parable says
[16:56] in the wise and foolish virgins Matthew
[16:58] 25 1-13 we must prepare the oil we must
[17:01] prepare our hearts to have the baptism
[17:03] of the Holy Ghost the Bible says we do
[17:05] that by obeying him Matthew 5:42 I
[17:08] believe or 43 says God gives the Holy
[17:11] Ghost to them that obey him we must
[17:13] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[17:14] and we shall be filled according to
[17:16] Matthew Chapter 5 so Abraham and lot are
[17:19] a type of the wise and foolish Virgin of
[17:21] course David and Saul Jesus and the
[17:23] saved thief on the cross and then Paul
[17:26] says gold and silver are like the wise
[17:28] and foolish virgins and then St John in
[17:30] revelation 22 says holy and righteous
[17:33] the holy are the Holy Ghost filled
[17:35] Saints the righteous are the foolish
[17:37] virgins so of course I'll leave video
[17:38] links to these topics in the description
[17:41] number nine is the five full ministry in
[17:43] the local church we see this in
[17:45] Ephesians 4: 8-16 Paul ordained the fful
[17:49] ministry decades after Jesus had already
[17:51] ascended and then he never changed it he
[17:53] said the fivefold ministry would
[17:54] continue until we all come in the unity
[17:56] of faith of course the bride of Christ
[17:57] is not unified in everything in the
[17:59] faith but she will be by the grace of
[18:01] God before the Rapture of course this
[18:03] teaching shows the fallacy of the tape
[18:04] Church movement it exposes the heresy of
[18:07] saying press play and Obey only listen
[18:09] to brother brandom shame on those people
[18:11] I have many videos about that trying to
[18:12] correct them hopefully some people can
[18:14] be corrected by God's grace we also see
[18:17] the five benefits of the five full
[18:18] ministry in Ephesians 4: 8-16 so people
[18:22] that reject the five full ministry miss
[18:23] out on those five benefits of course and
[18:26] then people that don't go to church or
[18:28] people that reject the five full
[18:29] ministry they're in danger of fulfilling
[18:31] 1 John 2:19 they went out from us
[18:33] because they are not of us this may
[18:36] prove someone is a foolish virgin or a
[18:38] serpent seed in the spiritual realm of
[18:40] course remember this was established the
[18:43] fivefold ministry was established in
[18:44] Acts 2 42-47 The True Believers love the
[18:48] doctrine of the Apostles they love
[18:50] fellowshipping with the apostles
[18:51] breaking bread praying from house to
[18:53] house taking communion you only do this
[18:55] with the five full ministry as brother
[18:57] Ram said every Christ should have a home
[18:59] Church a pastor pay tithes and offerings
[19:02] to the local church to support the
[19:04] ministry and that's a new testament
[19:05] teaching in First Corinthians chapter 9
[19:07] I'll leave uh video links to that in the
[19:09] description as well and this is part of
[19:11] chapter 11 of my 2021 book on the
[19:14] mystery of God's will God's will is for
[19:16] you to have his perfect will for your
[19:18] relationships your vocations your jobs
[19:22] location so you live in the right place
[19:24] and of course that includes your local
[19:25] church your Ministries which Ministries
[19:28] you participate in in your local church
[19:30] and your gifts the gifts that you
[19:32] exercise in your local church such an
[19:34] important subject and finally uh 10th is
[19:37] the mother Harlot and the mother Harlot
[19:40] is taught in chapter 9 of my 2021 book
[19:42] of course it's the Roman Catholic church
[19:44] but she has daughters according to
[19:47] Revelation
[19:48] 2:23 and of course the daughters are the
[19:51] Protestant churches that hold many of
[19:53] the Catholic Church's false doctrines
[19:54] like the Trinity Dogma brother Ram
[19:57] teaches plainly and of course the Bible
[19:58] does as as well that we're warriors
[20:00] we're soldiers in the army of the Lord
[20:02] Brother Ram Likens boxers to having to
[20:04] study their opponents and so in the
[20:07] Bible we're likened unto soldiers and
[20:08] soldiers have to fight they have to know
[20:10] their enemy and so that's why I would
[20:12] include the teaching on the mother
[20:14] harlot in the top 10 subjects I would
[20:16] teach new Believers 1 Peter 5'8 says we
[20:19] must be sober and Vigilant because the
[20:20] enem is like a roaring line seeking whom
[20:23] he may devour so if our enemy is around
[20:25] us we need to be aware of the enemy and
[20:27] the Bible says we must must not be
[20:29] ignorant of the enemy's devices or ways
[20:31] that he tries to trap us or trick us
[20:33] destroy us steal or kill from us
[20:36] According to second Corinthians 2:11 of
[20:38] course John chapter 8 the enemy comes to
[20:40] steal kill and destroy so we've got to
[20:42] study our enemy in order to overcome our
[20:44] enemy and we've got the greatest weapon
[20:46] there ever was the word of God it is
[20:48] written Jesus overcame Satan by saying
[20:51] it is written time and time again that's
[20:53] how we'll overcome as well so in chapter
[20:56] 9 there's 11 proofs the Roman Catholic
[20:57] Church is the mother Harlot Jesus said
[21:00] few there be that find the narrow road
[21:01] very few people will overcome this Beast
[21:04] system and her daughters of course you
[21:07] see this uh Antichrist Spirit through
[21:09] the four horse riders and the Seven
[21:10] Seals that's really important we know
[21:13] the name of that Rider is death so death
[21:15] starts out as a white horse rider a
[21:17] deceptive false Doctrine then it turns
[21:20] into the red horse rider killing and
[21:23] attacking its opponents then it turns
[21:25] into a money-making Ministry the black
[21:27] horse rider then turns into spiritual
[21:29] death the pale horse rider also in this
[21:31] chapter the mark of the beast is taught
[21:33] the image of the Beast the number of the
[21:35] beast's name the future Antichrist so
[21:36] many important topics that we need to
[21:38] know about as Believers and of course
[21:40] I'll leave video links in the
[21:42] description for this topic in closing
[21:45] friends I hope this has been a helpful
[21:47] video by God's grace since I was asked
[21:48] about it I wanted to respond to this
[21:50] person's question he was a new message
[21:52] believer and he wanted some
[21:54] recommendations on topics so these are
[21:55] my top 10 I'm not saying they're perfect
[21:58] but after meditating on this for a few
[22:00] study sessions I felt these would be my
[22:02] top 10 I also tell people when I first
[22:04] came in the message I read the entire
[22:06] church age book that's the foundation of
[22:08] my Ministry my faith in the word of God
[22:11] along with the Bible of course because
[22:13] that's what the church age book is just
[22:14] one big Bible study taking us back to
[22:16] the word of God of course giving
[22:17] historical links and so forth on the
[22:19] seven Church ages and so of course
[22:21] there's many honorable mentioned
[22:22] subjects that could be in here such as
[22:24] the seven Church ages such as the Seven
[22:25] Seals predestination hell's not eternal
[22:29] having a Godly home life with your
[22:31] family Divine Healing Miracles and so
[22:34] forth perhaps I'll do a part two of this
[22:36] if I get some comments in the
[22:37] description and I feel led of the holy
[22:39] spirit so feel free to leave me some
[22:40] comments what other topics would you
[22:42] include what would your top 10 be
